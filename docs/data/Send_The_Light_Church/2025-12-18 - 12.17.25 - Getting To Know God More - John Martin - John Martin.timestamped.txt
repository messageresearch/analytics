[35:28] you, Lord, to come in this part of the
[35:30] service, Lord. Would you cleanse us of
[35:32] our sins and our iniquities
[35:35] and any unbelief that would stand in the
[35:38] way of knowing you a little bit more,
[35:42] Lord.
[35:44] Father, we ask that you would bless your
[35:46] people now. Inspire us with revelation
[35:49] from above. Take these lips of clay and
[35:53] Lord, speak through them. and we'll give
[35:56] you the praise and honor as we commit
[35:57] the service and all of our lives into
[35:59] your hands in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[36:03] Amen. Turn with me if you would to the
[36:05] book of uh Psalms for we have just one
[36:09] scripture to read.
[36:12] Psalms chapter 46.
[36:16] Psalms chapter 46.
[36:20] Um,
[36:21] brother Alex uh was, if I could say it
[36:26] like this, was right in line with what
[36:28] we were studying before he came.
[36:32] And he ministered on seeing him who is
[36:35] invisible.
[36:37] And it's hard to know a God who's
[36:40] invisible. You have to find other
[36:42] senses. Right? when you lose one of your
[36:45] senses, we're told that other senses
[36:48] come to the forefront
[36:50] &gt;&gt; and um when we can't use our eyesight to
[36:53] see God, then we have to by faith is
[36:57] that sense we see him. And so we want to
[37:00] talk about getting to know God more.
[37:04] And so I know brother Ron had had uh
[37:06] prayed that we'd be encouraged. So, if I
[37:08] could say it like this, if there be an
[37:10] encouragement to anyone that wants to
[37:11] know God, I think we have some
[37:13] scriptures that could point us in the
[37:16] right direction. Amen. Psalms chapter
[37:19] 46, we're going to read verse number 10.
[37:22] Be still and know that I am God. I will
[37:26] be exalted among the heathen. I will be
[37:29] exalted in the earth. Amen. God bless.
[37:32] You may be seated.
[37:35] Well, there's no shortages of opinions
[37:38] who God is. Everybody has an opinion. I
[37:43] don't care if you're at the barber shop.
[37:45] I don't care if you're at the
[37:46] chiropractor. I don't care if you're at
[37:48] the store. Everybody has got an opinion
[37:51] who God is.
[37:54] I have had people claiming to be an
[37:56] atheist telling me their opinion about
[38:00] this unknown power.
[38:03] There are churches with different
[38:04] beliefs, various denominations.
[38:08] We've got pro uh podcast and lectures
[38:10] and conferences and Bible colleges and
[38:13] books and books and books telling us who
[38:16] God is.
[38:19] Did you ever talk to someone who wasn't
[38:21] actively serving God,
[38:24] but they wanted to tell you about God
[38:28] &gt;&gt; or they wanted to tell you what you need
[38:30] to be doing?
[38:32] So it's not hard to find someone who's
[38:35] got an opinion who God is and about God.
[38:39] Jesus said, "Many will come to me in my
[38:41] name saying, I
[38:44] uh I am Christ." In other words, I am a
[38:47] Christian. I am Christlike. I'm the one
[38:50] that you should be listening to. And
[38:52] what Jesus said, "And will deceive
[38:55] many."
[38:57] the person who says
[38:59] they're from Christ, they're going to
[39:02] talk to you and what they're going to do
[39:04] is they're going to deceive you. Many
[39:08] Jesus said, "So, it's important that not
[39:12] all people that say that they know God
[39:15] that you should listen to." I'm so glad
[39:18] that we have a Bible to know the truth.
[39:23] And uh as brother Ron was saying in his
[39:26] prayer, I believe that you that we we
[39:29] have the right doctrine. We have the
[39:31] truth here, but you understand we're
[39:34] we're not in church 24/7. We talk to
[39:36] other people. And and they and and and
[39:40] we know that the devil is always trying
[39:42] to get us to compromise. What is the the
[39:44] the hardest spirit in this age? It it's
[39:48] Leodysa. And the spirit of Leodysia is I
[39:51] don't I'm in need of nothing. I don't
[39:53] need to do any more than what I'm doing.
[39:55] I'm just fine. Thank you. But Jesus
[39:58] looks at those people with that
[40:00] mentality. And he says, "You're blind.
[40:04] You you you don't you don't see
[40:06] spiritually. You're you're not even
[40:08] clothed with my righteousness."
[40:11] And and so you're naked and you're
[40:13] you're not where you need to be. And he
[40:15] says, "You need to get your eyes for
[40:18] your eyes. is you need to um you need to
[40:22] get my spirit inside of you so you can
[40:25] truly know me.
[40:29] People who serve God in their own way,
[40:32] if I could say it like this, are serving
[40:34] God in vain.
[40:37] There's a way that seemth right unto
[40:39] man, but the end but the end of that man
[40:41] or the end of that way is is not God's
[40:44] way. And it's no different with people
[40:46] who worship God in their own way. I'm
[40:49] not talking about worshiping God from
[40:51] the dictates of your heart. I'm talking
[40:54] about people who worship God. They just
[40:56] want to do it their way. Well,
[41:00] Jesus said, "You don't even know what
[41:02] you worship."
[41:04] In other words, you're worshiping
[41:07] someone unknown to you.
[41:10] And he says, "In vain do they worship
[41:13] me." So, we can worship God in vain. We
[41:16] could worship uh u the the unknown God
[41:20] and not even know him.
[41:23] Jesus said in John 4:23, "But the hour
[41:25] cometh, and now is that the true
[41:28] worshippers shall worship the Father in
[41:31] spirit and in truth. For the Father
[41:34] seeketh such to worship him. For God is
[41:36] the spirit, and they that worship him
[41:38] must worship him in spirit and in
[41:42] truth." So, if I could say it like this,
[41:44] if our goal is not to come into church
[41:47] and worship God in the spirit, in the
[41:50] spirit of the Holy Ghost and in the
[41:52] truth that you know him, then God's not
[41:55] going to receive our worship.
[41:59] It's in vain
[42:01] because God has a requirement. And see,
[42:04] but but the spirit is it doesn't matter
[42:07] what you do. It doesn't matter how you
[42:08] worship. It does it does matter.
[42:11] It does matter if God doesn't come and
[42:15] uh
[42:17] uh his presence doesn't come and from
[42:19] our depths of our heart and honesty and
[42:22] truth and humility worship him then it's
[42:25] in vain.
[42:28] It takes pure humility to worship God
[42:32] correctly.
[42:34] Pure humility.
[42:37] Many people think they know God but they
[42:39] don't.
[42:40] Jesus said in Matthew 7:22, "We've often
[42:43] quoted. Many will say to me in that day,
[42:45] Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
[42:47] thy name, and in thy name cast out
[42:49] devils, and in thy name done many
[42:51] wonderful works, and then will I profess
[42:53] unto them, I never knew you."
[42:58] Here are people that use the name of
[43:02] Christ. They work. They've done works.
[43:06] They've been recognized. They've even
[43:09] got gifts. Speak in tongues, prophesy,
[43:13] uh, interpretation of tongues. And God
[43:16] saying, you know what? We didn't have a
[43:18] personal relationship.
[43:20] And this is the hardest thing for
[43:22] people. And look, this happens at the
[43:23] end. Jesus said, many shall say to me in
[43:26] that day, why do we want to wait till
[43:28] that day to find out we were wrong?
[43:32] &gt;&gt; I'd rather find out on this side.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; That way, I have a chance to make it
[43:36] right.
[43:38] Brother said and why it had to be
[43:40] shepherds. He says so they did not
[43:42] recognize him because it didn't fit
[43:44] their interpretation.
[43:46] See every man is right in his own eyes.
[43:48] This is the way I see God. This is what
[43:50] I believe. Like that matters. It don't
[43:52] matter what I believe.
[43:55] It doesn't matter my opinion. I should
[43:58] say what matters is that I agree with
[44:00] the word of God.
[44:03] That's what matters.
[44:05] We will never ever know God outside of
[44:08] genuine humility
[44:10] because God hides himself from the wise
[44:13] and prudent. God resists the proud. The
[44:16] Bible says that God confounds the wise
[44:18] and the mighty. Now there's scriptures
[44:20] for all these things.
[44:23] So we need if we want to know God more.
[44:25] How many wants to know God more?
[44:28] We've got to get dressed with humility.
[44:31] It's a must. Isaiah 57:15, if you want
[44:35] to write that down, those of you that
[44:37] are taking notes, uh Isaiah 57:15, for
[44:40] thus saith the high and lofty one, the
[44:45] one that inhabitth eternity, so we're
[44:48] speaking of God now, whose name is holy,
[44:52] I dwell in the high and holy place with
[44:56] him also
[44:58] that is of a contrite
[45:01] and humble spirit.
[45:03] Notice no pride in there, no arrogancy,
[45:07] just a true
[45:10] broken and and humble spirit.
[45:14] And his goal is to revive the spirit of
[45:17] the humble and to revive the heart of
[45:20] the contrite ones. So God, we have to
[45:24] get in this condition
[45:26] if we want God to dwell with us. So
[45:30] notice the word is dwell. God will come
[45:34] and bless his enemies. The rain falls on
[45:36] the just and the unjust. God will bless.
[45:39] But when it comes to dwelling,
[45:42] that's another story.
[45:45] You got to maintain humility. You got to
[45:48] maintain the right spirit, the right
[45:50] attitude.
[45:52] We have to be humble enough to find our
[45:55] answers in the word of God. Jesus said
[45:58] in John 5:39,
[46:00] "Search the scriptures.
[46:04] Search the scriptures for in them you
[46:07] think
[46:09] you think you have eternal life."
[46:13] But the scriptures are what testifies
[46:18] of whether you got eternal life or not.
[46:21] So in other words, Jesus is saying here,
[46:24] "Your opinion don't matter. My opinion
[46:26] don't matter. What matters is that we
[46:29] search the scriptures and we find out
[46:30] whether we got eternal life or not.
[46:34] And ye and look what he says in verse
[46:36] 40. And you will not come to me that you
[46:40] might have life. Now why was that? Why
[46:42] is that? Why will not people come to
[46:44] Jesus that they may have life? Because
[46:46] of pride.
[46:47] They don't want to be told they're
[46:49] wrong. They want they they they they
[46:52] would rather stay with where they're at.
[46:55] But Jesus said, "Search the scriptures."
[46:56] So, let's take a moment and search the
[46:59] scriptures. We're talking about knowing
[47:01] God more. Let's look at 2 Corinthians
[47:04] chapter 5.
[47:06] 2 Corinthians chapter 5. People assume
[47:09] that they know God.
[47:11] But we know to assume is to venture
[47:13] without authority. And that's very
[47:14] dangerous. That's why many of people
[47:16] come in that day and say, "I thought I
[47:19] thought I knew you."
[47:21] And here's the evidence that I knew you.
[47:23] all these wonderful things that I did,
[47:26] but that doesn't constitute knowing God.
[47:29] And it's it's it takes real humility to
[47:32] say, "Well, maybe I don't." No, like I
[47:34] should maybe I don't maybe I really, you
[47:38] know, Paul, this man was learned above
[47:41] he was learned by the best in his age,
[47:43] the greatest teacher, Galia.
[47:46] He said, "I had to give up everything I
[47:49] knew to know God."
[47:53] Now that took a lot of humility.
[47:56] That took a lot of humility.
[47:58] 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 14. The
[48:03] Bible says here, "For the love of Christ
[48:07] constrainth us, because we thus judge
[48:11] that if one died for all, then we're all
[48:15] dead." So what does that mean?
[48:17] like God saved us.
[48:21] We're we're in debt to God.
[48:26] We're dead. We're debt to doing our will
[48:28] anymore.
[48:30] Right? He paid a debt. We He didn't say
[48:33] pay the debt. Go do what you want to do.
[48:37] And this is what I like about this
[48:38] verse. It says, "The love of Christ
[48:40] constrains us because we thus judge."
[48:43] We're making a judgment call right here.
[48:44] Christ died for us at Calvary. We we are
[48:48] now in debt to him.
[48:52] And I like it. It's a judgment call. We
[48:54] don't we don't need to go through it
[48:55] anymore. So now he begins to describe
[48:58] this in verse 15. And that he died for
[49:01] all that they which live should not
[49:06] henceforth live unto themselves,
[49:09] but unto him which died for them and
[49:12] rose again. So there it is.
[49:15] We no longer are supposed to live for
[49:18] ourselves. Just because Jesus died on
[49:20] the cross, he wasn't a Santa Claus.
[49:24] He becomes our our savior, our Lord,
[49:27] and we don't live for oursel anymore. We
[49:30] live on him. Now, how do I live for him?
[49:32] Search the scriptures. It tells you how
[49:33] to live for God.
[49:36] Wherefore, henceforth know we no man
[49:39] after the flesh. Yay, though we have
[49:42] known Christ after the flesh, yet now
[49:46] henceforth know we him no more. We're
[49:48] not looking to the outside. The only way
[49:50] you we can know Christ is in the spirit.
[49:54] And the thing is, God is not obligated
[49:58] to come to you or me
[50:02] just because we want him to.
[50:05] We have to get in an atmosphere of I'm
[50:07] unworthy.
[50:10] Lord, I need you, a an atmosphere of
[50:14] humility.
[50:17] And then God
[50:20] God will come
[50:23] because God is faithful. But he resists
[50:25] the proud. If we're like, I don't care.
[50:27] It's just service. It doesn't matter.
[50:30] You know, God is not going to honor
[50:31] that. God God will never honor that. God
[50:35] honors those that are are are true in
[50:38] their heart. They're sincere in their
[50:40] heart and they're they they know their
[50:42] place. They're in debt to God.
[50:46] So we know God after the spirit.
[50:49] Therefore, in verse 17, if any man be in
[50:54] Christ,
[50:55] he is new. He's a new creature.
[51:02] Old things are passed away. Behold, all
[51:05] things have become new. Now, a new
[51:06] creature, I'm telling you, that's two
[51:08] different things. That's the difference
[51:09] between a cat and a dog.
[51:13] It's not a different type of dog. It's
[51:16] it's a it's it's a new creature.
[51:19] But this is why when you see a a a a a
[51:24] Christian that he's sold out, he's an
[51:27] oddball to the to the church world, to
[51:29] the world. Because most
[51:32] churches out there,
[51:35] they just want you to believe what they
[51:38] what they're presenting, this doctrine,
[51:40] but you live pretty much any way you
[51:42] want to. and and and so therefore
[51:47] uh old things are really not passed
[51:49] away. In other words, no matter what
[51:52] church you go to, you act the same way.
[51:55] But when you come to Christ
[51:58] and Christ comes into your heart, he
[51:59] changes your nature
[52:02] and the old nature goes away. So the old
[52:05] things that you used to do, they just
[52:07] don't happen anymore.
[52:09] Behold, all things are become new
[52:13] and all things are of God. So this is
[52:17] the true evidence whether you have
[52:20] eternal life right now. This here is the
[52:23] scripture that tells you you got eternal
[52:25] life. Not just I believe and I've been
[52:28] baptized.
[52:31] you. It's not just saying you believe
[52:33] and you got baptized
[52:35] because this scripture is telling you
[52:37] that old things have to be passed away.
[52:40] There has to be a a bornag again
[52:42] experience to where you can look back
[52:45] and say, "I used to do this, but now I'm
[52:47] like this." And it happened not because
[52:50] I chose it, but because I let the Holy
[52:53] Ghost in my life and it just happened
[52:56] organically. Oh, isn't that beautiful?
[52:59] All things are of God who have
[53:01] reconciled us to to himself by Jesus
[53:04] Christ and had given to us the ministry
[53:07] of reconciliation. There it is. You no
[53:11] longer live for yourself.
[53:14] That's what we read at the beginning of
[53:16] the scripture
[53:17] that if Christ died for me, we no longer
[53:20] live for ourselves but we live for
[53:22] others. That is the ministry of
[53:23] reconciliation. God makes us ambassadors
[53:26] and we start bringing others to the
[53:28] knowledge of Christ. We start showing
[53:31] them the way of the new nature, the way
[53:34] to really become born again.
[53:38] Knowing God is becoming God in nature.
[53:44] Knowing God is becoming God in nature.
[53:48] That's the whole thing about letting the
[53:50] Holy Ghost inside.
[53:53] No wonder Paul was saying after 33 years
[53:57] I haven't attained yet. I haven't
[53:59] apprehended yet
[54:02] because he saw that there was more in
[54:05] his life that needed to die out and
[54:09] there was more in his life that he
[54:10] needed to attain to. He never was at the
[54:13] place, yeah, I'm there. I'm the model
[54:15] Christian.
[54:17] You you'll look at me.
[54:19] I mean, he was a leader. He did say,
[54:22] "Follow me as I follow Christ." But if I
[54:26] ever tell you anything different than
[54:28] I've already told you, don't you listen
[54:30] to me. I don't care if an angel tells
[54:32] you something different. I know what
[54:34] I've told you is the truth.
[54:37] But see, the spirit that he had was he
[54:40] wanted to get to know God more.
[54:44] He wanted all the old things to pass
[54:46] away. He wanted all things to become
[54:48] new. And he wanted his whole life to
[54:50] become God. I believe he had the same
[54:52] spirit that that Job had when Job said,
[54:55] "I will not be satisfied until I awake
[54:58] in his likeness. I want to be in the
[55:00] image of God completely." And and and
[55:03] Paul was never satisfied.
[55:07] He was serious. He really wanted to get
[55:09] to know God more. And I wish we could
[55:12] say all we got to do is go to church and
[55:14] we're going to get to know God more. I
[55:16] wish that was all we had to do. I wish
[55:18] all we had to do was read the Bible and
[55:20] we'd know God more. But what it really
[55:22] takes is the giving of your spirit and
[55:24] your heart to God.
[55:26] You got to say, "God, come inside of
[55:28] me." There's a reality to God.
[55:32] Paul said, "All that I might know him
[55:34] and the power of his resurrection and
[55:37] the fellowship of his sufferings being
[55:39] made conformable unto his death." He
[55:41] said, "I press toward the mark for the
[55:44] prize of the high calling of God in
[55:47] Christ Jesus." Something inside of Paul
[55:50] was just excited about serving God 33
[55:53] years later than he was on the road to
[55:55] uh Damascus when God met him.
[55:59] Be still
[56:01] and know that I am God.
[56:07] God gives us a ministry of
[56:08] reconciliation.
[56:11] And Paul and David said,"I will be
[56:14] exalted among the heathen. I will be
[56:16] exalted in the earth." Then how is that
[56:18] going to happen? God is going
[56:22] um
[56:24] the uh uh the fields are white unto the
[56:26] harvest, but the laborers are few. The
[56:29] way that that people get to know God is
[56:32] through the disciples who go and tell
[56:33] others who don't know God, this is the
[56:35] way walking in it.
[56:38] I remember there was a time in my life
[56:40] that I did not know God.
[56:44] People tried telling me about God. I
[56:47] even went to church, brother Ron, but I
[56:49] didn't know God.
[56:53] But you know God is here right now.
[56:57] God is here right now.
[57:01] All we have to do is number one, believe
[57:05] that he's here.
[57:08] And simply number two,
[57:12] believe
[57:14] that all you have to do is follow what
[57:16] the word tells you to do because he
[57:19] gives the Holy Ghost to them that
[57:23] obey him.
[57:26] So there we have to just we have to do
[57:28] more than say God is here, but now we
[57:30] got to listen to what the word is saying
[57:32] and walk in it.
[57:35] Now, this is really what prompted this
[57:37] whole service today is Acts chapter 17.
[57:41] We're going to do it like a lengthy
[57:42] reading here. Acts chapter 17.
[57:46] We want to start with verse 16.
[57:58] He's happy to be a Christian.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:03] How many is happy about saying amen?
[58:08] &gt;&gt; All right, starting with verse number
[58:10] 16.
[58:13] Now, while Paul waited for them at
[58:16] Athens, his spirit was stirred inside of
[58:20] him. And when he saw the whole city just
[58:24] given to idolatry, he walked into the
[58:27] city and they were all just into
[58:29] idolatry.
[58:31] Therefore disputed he in the synagogues
[58:34] with the Jews and with the devout
[58:36] persons
[58:38] and in the market daily with them that
[58:42] met with him. In other words, he was
[58:44] going around to everybody and he was
[58:47] talking to them about their situation
[58:49] because they were um worshiping and
[58:53] serving idol gods. And Paul is trying to
[58:57] say, "No, this is this is not going to
[58:58] get you to heaven.
[59:01] Then certain philosophers of EP
[59:05] epicurans
[59:07] and of the Stoics
[59:12] encountered him and some said, "What
[59:15] will this babbler say?" He was a
[59:18] prophet. They're calling him a babbler.
[59:20] others some other some he seemth to be a
[59:26] setter forth of strange gods because he
[59:30] preaches unto them Jesus and the
[59:32] resurrection. So, he's walking into an
[59:35] area that they don't know Jesus
[59:39] and they're looking at him as they're as
[59:41] he's speaking strangely to them.
[59:46] And they took him and brought him unto
[59:51] Arus,
[59:53] saying, May we know what this new
[59:56] doctrine whereof thou speakest is?
[1:00:00] For thou bringest certain strange things
[1:00:02] to our ears, we would know therefore
[1:00:06] what these things mean. For all the
[1:00:09] Athenians and strangers which were there
[1:00:12] spent their time in nothing else but
[1:00:16] either to tell or to hear some new
[1:00:18] thing. You know what this sounds like?
[1:00:20] This sounds this sounds like the old
[1:00:22] Google,
[1:00:24] the old internet. you know, let's just
[1:00:27] let's just find out something new,
[1:00:30] something to occupy our time like in
[1:00:33] vain, right? Just learn new new things,
[1:00:36] but it doesn't matter.
[1:00:39] Verse 22, then Paul stood in the midst
[1:00:42] of Mars Hill and said, "You men of
[1:00:47] Athens, I perceive that in all things
[1:00:51] you are too superstitious.
[1:00:54] where I have passed by and beheld your
[1:00:57] devotions and I found an altar with this
[1:01:01] inscription
[1:01:03] to the unknown God
[1:01:07] whom therefore you ignorantly worship
[1:01:10] him declare I unto you.
[1:01:15] So here's Paul coming in to this group
[1:01:18] of people trying to tell them who God is
[1:01:22] because they didn't know. They said to
[1:01:24] the unknown God and they tried to
[1:01:26] worship the unknown god and Paul is
[1:01:29] saying you can know this God. You can
[1:01:31] know him because he's here.
[1:01:36] He's here.
[1:01:37] God that made the world and all things
[1:01:42] therein
[1:01:43] seen that he is Lord of heaven and earth
[1:01:47] dwelleth not in temples made with hands.
[1:01:50] Neither is worship with men's hands. As
[1:01:53] though he needed anything seen, he
[1:01:56] giveth to all life and breath and all
[1:02:02] things,
[1:02:04] and have made one blood all nations of
[1:02:07] men for to dwell on all the face of the
[1:02:10] earth, and have determined the times
[1:02:13] before appointed and the bonds of their
[1:02:16] habitation. So here it is. They're
[1:02:18] describing God who created the whole
[1:02:20] earth and all the different
[1:02:22] nationalities, all the different
[1:02:24] nations, all the different people. He's
[1:02:27] made them all one blood. It's ma he's
[1:02:29] made it possible for all of them to know
[1:02:32] God. That's what he's saying here at the
[1:02:35] appointed time. Because we are all
[1:02:37] called at different times to know God.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; That's why he says at the appointed
[1:02:41] time. And maybe today is the appointed
[1:02:44] time that you could get to know God
[1:02:46] more. Maybe it is. It's I believe it's
[1:02:49] all what what happens inside of you.
[1:02:53] Now, verse 27, that they should seek the
[1:02:59] Lord. Here's here's the antidote right
[1:03:01] here to get to know God more. That they
[1:03:05] should seek the Lord if happily they
[1:03:10] might feel after him.
[1:03:13] Feel after him. So, just imagine you've
[1:03:17] all done this. You've all woke up in the
[1:03:20] middle of the night. The lights are off.
[1:03:22] You're trying to walk somewhere and you
[1:03:25] can't see, but you're going like this.
[1:03:29] You know what I'm talking about.
[1:03:31] So, we don't see this God because he's
[1:03:34] invisible.
[1:03:36] So, we have to with our faith feel after
[1:03:39] him.
[1:03:41] Are you with me? that they should seek
[1:03:44] the Lord, if happily they might feel
[1:03:45] after him and find him, though he be not
[1:03:49] far from every one of us.
[1:03:55] He's here.
[1:03:57] He's not far.
[1:04:02] But we have to do our part to seek after
[1:04:05] him,
[1:04:06] to feel after him, to say, "God, I know
[1:04:11] you're here. I just got to get in
[1:04:12] contact with you. Brother Brandon talked
[1:04:15] about that we have TV waves going
[1:04:18] through the room, radio waves going
[1:04:21] through the room, but we don't know what
[1:04:23] they are. They're invisible. We can't
[1:04:25] see them. But if we had a receiver and
[1:04:27] then we could display it called a TV or
[1:04:30] a radio, then we could know what waves
[1:04:32] are going through the room. Well, God is
[1:04:35] here.
[1:04:36] We just need a receiver.
[1:04:39] And that receiver is Lord, I am
[1:04:42] hungering and thirsting to know you.
[1:04:46] There's
[1:04:48] there's more of you. I'm not satisfied
[1:04:51] with just, oh, I got baptized and and I
[1:04:53] just, you know, I go to this church and
[1:04:55] I'm saved. That is not it. It's about a
[1:04:58] personal relationship.
[1:05:00] I want to know you more, Lord. Oh, I
[1:05:04] just love this scripture. That verse is
[1:05:06] what popped the whole message to me.
[1:05:10] Verse 28. For in him, for in God we live
[1:05:15] and we move and have our being. As
[1:05:19] certain also of your own poets have
[1:05:22] said, for we are also his offspring.
[1:05:26] Notice how he just takes what they don't
[1:05:28] even know really what they're just
[1:05:31] ignorantly worshiping this unknown God
[1:05:33] and how he makes known to to them who
[1:05:36] the true God is. And that's what we've
[1:05:39] been blessed with. We've been blessed
[1:05:41] with the truth and we should be able to
[1:05:43] tell others the truth that we know.
[1:05:46] Amen. For as much then as we are the
[1:05:51] offspring of God, we are the offspring
[1:05:54] of God, we ought not to think that the
[1:05:58] Godhead is like unto gold or silver or
[1:06:01] stone or graven
[1:06:04] uh a graven by art and man's device. For
[1:06:08] the times of this ignorance, God wked
[1:06:11] at, but now God commandeth
[1:06:15] every command all men everywhere to
[1:06:19] repent. Isn't that something?
[1:06:22] All men God has is commanded to repent
[1:06:25] and and and get get right with him. I
[1:06:29] love those scriptures. Love those
[1:06:30] scriptures. Be still and know that I am
[1:06:35] God.
[1:06:38] Now
[1:06:39] what is really required first to know
[1:06:42] God is stillness.
[1:06:45] That's the first thing. Get still.
[1:06:50] No wonder God leads his sheep beside
[1:06:52] still waters. Psalms 23 verse1. The Lord
[1:06:55] is my shepherd. I shall not want. He
[1:06:58] maketh me to lay down in green pastures.
[1:07:02] He leadth me beside still waters.
[1:07:06] God is interested in us being still in
[1:07:10] our heart, in our spirit, in our mind
[1:07:13] that he may teach us his way.
[1:07:17] Now, I remember I'll never forget this,
[1:07:19] but
[1:07:23] I was asking brother Brandham's uh son
[1:07:27] um
[1:07:29] what did brother Brand because we had at
[1:07:31] that time, well, we still do. We just
[1:07:33] had seven little ones that were just,
[1:07:35] you know, running around and having
[1:07:37] their way.
[1:07:39] And it's uh when you've never been
[1:07:42] taught, you know, how do you have order
[1:07:44] in the church? you uh you just want all
[1:07:47] the advice you could get. And I knew
[1:07:49] that
[1:07:50] um Brother Brandham probably heard from
[1:07:53] God how to handle his home.
[1:07:57] So I asked his son, "What did your dad
[1:08:00] do when you guys were being bad?"
[1:08:05] And this was his answer. I've shared it
[1:08:07] before. He said he would just get us and
[1:08:10] he would set us down. and he would just
[1:08:13] settle us down
[1:08:16] and he would just settle us down.
[1:08:21] That's all he said.
[1:08:25] He was stilling the spirit
[1:08:29] so that he could bring order to what was
[1:08:32] going on.
[1:08:34] Be still. That's the first thing we need
[1:08:36] to do if we really want to know God more
[1:08:38] is be still. get away from the busyiness
[1:08:42] of our mind, our thoughts, what we're
[1:08:44] doing, what we want to do, and get our
[1:08:47] mind clear, like a like a blank state,
[1:08:52] so God can speak. Because God doesn't
[1:08:54] want to have to shout over everything
[1:08:57] because God's is a still soft voice.
[1:09:00] He's not one that just, you know, yells
[1:09:02] all the time. He He wants us to want
[1:09:05] him. And so we need to be still.
[1:09:10] And so I say this, if you want your you
[1:09:12] want uh things to be have more order in
[1:09:14] the house, the thing to do is still the
[1:09:17] spirit.
[1:09:20] Be still from the busyiness of your
[1:09:22] mind, your life, your goals, your plans,
[1:09:25] your dreams. How many has gone hunting
[1:09:28] before?
[1:09:29] Hey, keep your hand up for just a
[1:09:31] second.
[1:09:33] Okay. Well, I I I'm just going to use
[1:09:35] you, Joy. when you've gone out hunting.
[1:09:39] I I'm imagine it was your dad that you
[1:09:42] went out with. Okay. Do you remember
[1:09:45] your dad saying, "Now, you need to be
[1:09:46] quiet.
[1:09:49] You need to be still.
[1:09:51] You don't want to spook the deer."
[1:09:56] Because, you know, God is timid.
[1:09:59] That's why we need order in church.
[1:10:03] He's not all for this getting up and
[1:10:05] leaving and just, you know, drawing and
[1:10:07] having lots of do whatever you want to
[1:10:09] do in here while church is going on. God
[1:10:11] is not pleased with that.
[1:10:15] And so, just like we need to be still
[1:10:17] hunting,
[1:10:20] we need to be still if we want to know
[1:10:22] God.
[1:10:24] What that one Indian used to say,
[1:10:27] walk once, look them twice or board five
[1:10:30] times or whatever that is, you know,
[1:10:32] before you take your next move because
[1:10:37] it just it's a requirement if you want
[1:10:40] to see deer. You can't be just, you
[1:10:41] know, playing your boom box
[1:10:44] and uh, you know, just they're not
[1:10:47] obligated to come. Deer are not
[1:10:49] obligated to come to your blind.
[1:10:53] If you if you do not be quiet, they're
[1:10:55] not going to come. And I'll just say it
[1:10:57] like this. If you're not going to be
[1:10:59] still before God, don't expect to know
[1:11:01] him more. It's a requirement. It's like
[1:11:04] a reverence that he's he's wanting from
[1:11:07] us.
[1:11:09] So, in order to know God more, we must
[1:11:12] come out of our busy mind and still our
[1:11:15] thoughts. Keep our mind stayed on him.
[1:11:17] Look for him to speak in the stillness
[1:11:20] of your thoughts.
[1:11:23] Look for God to speak to you. Because
[1:11:24] here's the thing, God is here. He made
[1:11:28] it. Paul made it real clear that he is
[1:11:31] here. He's not far from every one of us.
[1:11:32] I don't care where we live, what city we
[1:11:34] live in, what state, what country, God
[1:11:37] is there.
[1:11:40] So, we can know God, but we got to steal
[1:11:43] ourselves and be serious about God.
[1:11:46] speak to me.
[1:11:48] There are so many things to gain when we
[1:11:50] still ourselves before God. Isaiah 40 29
[1:11:55] says, "He giveth power to the faint, and
[1:11:58] to them that have no might, he increasth
[1:12:01] his strength. Even the youth shall faint
[1:12:04] and be weary, and the young men shall
[1:12:06] utterly fall. But they that wait upon
[1:12:09] the Lord, they shall renew their
[1:12:11] strength. They shall mount up with wings
[1:12:14] as eagles. They shall run and not be
[1:12:15] weary. They shall walk and not faint
[1:12:18] by just waiting.
[1:12:21] Just be still and wait on God. And all
[1:12:24] of a sudden, you got spiritual strength
[1:12:26] that you didn't have prior to going to
[1:12:27] prayer.
[1:12:31] God honors
[1:12:34] when you spend time with him.
[1:12:37] Just in the simplicity,
[1:12:39] you know, the whole world, the whole
[1:12:42] world wants God to come and just meet
[1:12:45] all their needs without a relationship.
[1:12:48] That's how the attitude of the world is.
[1:12:52] And God's saying, I I want a
[1:12:53] relationship. The reason you got these
[1:12:55] test and trials is so you start calling
[1:12:57] on me.
[1:12:59] Is so you start looking to me and say,
[1:13:02] uh, I need your help, Lord.
[1:13:04] So if we don't steal ourselves from our
[1:13:07] own carnal mindset, then we're going to
[1:13:10] really miss out on knowing God. 1
[1:13:13] Corinthians chapter 2:14
[1:13:16] says 1 Corinthians chapter 2:14, "But
[1:13:18] the natural man," that's that's all of
[1:13:21] us here. The natural man receiveth not
[1:13:25] the things of the spirit of God. What
[1:13:29] does that tell you?
[1:13:31] We're all natural, right? We're all
[1:13:33] natural and we're all spiritual. I mean,
[1:13:36] we're a natural and a spiritual, but the
[1:13:38] natural part of us receives not the
[1:13:42] things of the spirit of God, for they
[1:13:44] are foolishness unto him. What? I got to
[1:13:46] spend time praying to get strength.
[1:13:48] That's foolish. I got to pray before
[1:13:51] service. I got to prepare my I got TO
[1:13:53] STEAL MY NO, I GOT I'm so busy. I don't
[1:13:55] got time for that. It's foolish.
[1:14:00] Neither can he know them because they
[1:14:03] are spiritually discerned. So if we just
[1:14:07] take that one verse for a second, if the
[1:14:10] natural man cannot receive
[1:14:13] the the things of God which is here
[1:14:16] right among us,
[1:14:18] that means I need to get out of the
[1:14:20] natural man. I need to get out of that
[1:14:23] atmosphere and get into the spirit that
[1:14:27] I can receive from him because he's
[1:14:29] here.
[1:14:32] We don't need
[1:14:36] We don't need great music and a great
[1:14:39] ministry to know that God's here.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; What we need is just faith in the word
[1:14:45] of God.
[1:14:46] And if if the word of God says I can't
[1:14:50] receive from him spiritually, then then
[1:14:52] what our our goal should be to try to
[1:14:55] enter into the spirit. Worship God with
[1:14:57] all of our heart. Put our heart into
[1:14:59] worship. Don't just well, however, no.
[1:15:02] Put your heart into it. Because if you
[1:15:05] want to meet God, you you you've got to
[1:15:09] express that with your whole being.
[1:15:12] Look at verse number 11 of of 1
[1:15:14] Corinthians chapter 2:1 says, "For what
[1:15:17] man knoweth the things of a man, save
[1:15:20] the spirit of man which is in him, even
[1:15:22] so the things of God knoweth no man, but
[1:15:28] the spirit of God." So we need God to
[1:15:31] show us. We can't depend on our ability
[1:15:34] to figure out things. We need God to
[1:15:37] show us. If the natural man cannot
[1:15:40] receive the things of God, then the
[1:15:42] natural man must learn to be still
[1:15:50] because a man at his very best is all
[1:15:52] vanity. He can't know God on his own. So
[1:15:57] he must learn to be still so that the
[1:16:00] spirit can begin to speak to us and we
[1:16:02] can really really know God. Now you know
[1:16:04] it's by revelation. So we got to we got
[1:16:07] to cast out all understanding. Lean not
[1:16:10] to your own understanding, your own
[1:16:12] intellect, your own way of thinking. You
[1:16:14] got to get it out of the way because his
[1:16:16] thoughts are higher than our thoughts.
[1:16:18] And it it it takes that stillness to let
[1:16:21] God come in and and just reveal himself.
[1:16:25] The natural man must steal his
[1:16:28] reasoning, his memory, his conscience,
[1:16:30] and all those gates, imagination and
[1:16:32] affections. The natural man must be
[1:16:35] still because the spirit of God wants to
[1:16:38] speak to us. He does. We How How many
[1:16:42] remember brother Brandham said that God
[1:16:44] wants to give us the Holy Ghost more
[1:16:46] than we want it?
[1:16:50] We think that's that's weird. I really
[1:16:52] want it. What do you mean he wants to
[1:16:54] give it more? We want it, but then we'll
[1:16:57] go days and we won't even think about
[1:16:58] it.
[1:17:01] But God, don't stop thinking about it
[1:17:04] because what is the Holy Ghost? What is
[1:17:06] the Holy Ghost?
[1:17:08] It is God. It is God himself.
[1:17:13] God wants to fill you with himself more
[1:17:16] than you want to get filled with God.
[1:17:19] In order for you to to really make it
[1:17:22] happen, you've got to you got to be
[1:17:24] willing to die out because that's the
[1:17:26] only way the Holy Ghost will come in.
[1:17:29] And that's why he could say, brother Bam
[1:17:31] could say that he wants to give it to
[1:17:32] you more than you want it yourself.
[1:17:37] Jesus was talking to Peter and to his
[1:17:41] disciples and he said, "You rub
[1:17:42] shoulders with everybody in the
[1:17:44] marketplace." And Jesus asked him, "Who
[1:17:46] do men say that I the son of man?"
[1:17:49] And everyone was busy giving their
[1:17:52] carnal opinions. Some would say thou
[1:17:55] John the Baptist, Elias, Jeremiah or one
[1:17:57] of the prophets. In other words, they
[1:17:59] were just, you know, given their opinion
[1:18:01] of who God was. No different than today.
[1:18:06] Who do men say that that Jesus is? Well,
[1:18:09] he's a Baptist, Methodist, Catholic,
[1:18:12] apostolic, church, church of God,
[1:18:14] Assemblies, Lutheran, or he's an
[1:18:16] independent.
[1:18:20] These are people who are learning what
[1:18:22] others got to say about Jesus. That's
[1:18:26] what this is.
[1:18:29] But notice Jesus is not building his
[1:18:32] church upon what other people say about
[1:18:34] him.
[1:18:37] We've got to know Jesus ourself and
[1:18:40] we've got to be still so God could speak
[1:18:43] to us.
[1:18:46] And I believe God is asking us as
[1:18:49] individuals, but whom say ye that I am?
[1:18:52] Peter heard all the different opinions
[1:18:56] who Jesus was, but nothing settled in
[1:18:58] his heart. And he got this revelation,
[1:19:00] thou art the Christ, the son of the
[1:19:02] living God. And Jesus said, "Blessed art
[1:19:06] thou, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and
[1:19:08] blood has not revealed this unto thee,
[1:19:10] but my father which is in heaven, God is
[1:19:12] the only one who can really tell us who
[1:19:14] God is."
[1:19:16] But we need to be still long enough that
[1:19:18] we might know God more. And he said,
[1:19:19] "Upon this
[1:19:21] rock I will build my church, and the
[1:19:24] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[1:19:26] it." Here's the thing. If somebody can
[1:19:29] talk you into who God is, that means
[1:19:31] somebody can come along and talk you out
[1:19:34] of it. Knowledge, the only thing
[1:19:36] knowledge ever does is puff you up.
[1:19:40] If you do not have a heart to really
[1:19:43] want God, your knowledge will end up
[1:19:47] hurting you
[1:19:50] because people get knowledge and they
[1:19:52] think it's suffice.
[1:19:54] Knowledge should take you to knowing God
[1:19:57] by revelation.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Right? So we got we got the knowledge of
[1:20:01] predestination.
[1:20:03] The prophet said, "I'm predestinated."
[1:20:05] Got that knowledge.
[1:20:08] So the devil takes that knowledge that
[1:20:10] you got and makes you sit real
[1:20:12] comfortable.
[1:20:15] But God gives you a revelation, says
[1:20:16] you're predestinated. You need to get to
[1:20:18] you need to be in the image of this
[1:20:20] book. YOU NEED TO PRESS IN. YOU need to
[1:20:22] become more like me because you've been
[1:20:24] predestinated. See, showing that
[1:20:26] revelation gives a different inspiration
[1:20:29] than just knowledge.
[1:20:32] And that's why knowledge is dangerous.
[1:20:36] When Saul was on the road to Damascus,
[1:20:40] God had to eject him off his high horse
[1:20:43] and said, "Be still, Saul. I've got
[1:20:45] something I need to tell you, but you
[1:20:48] haven't been listening to me because
[1:20:50] you've been way too busy.
[1:20:53] And Saul said, "Who art thou, Lord?" He
[1:20:56] didn't even know who he was. And the
[1:20:59] Lord said, "I'm Jesus. I'm the one
[1:21:01] you're persecuting.
[1:21:06] You you you think you're doing this for
[1:21:08] me, but you're you're doing it against
[1:21:10] me."
[1:21:11] And he literally had to kick him off his
[1:21:13] high horse and say, "Be still."
[1:21:17] And know God. Know me. I'm Jesus. I'm
[1:21:21] the one that you've been persecuting.
[1:21:26] I wonder sometimes if we just get so
[1:21:28] busy that we're really working against
[1:21:32] what God is wanting us to do
[1:21:35] when God is just calling us to be still.
[1:21:39] Look, when Moses saw the burning bush,
[1:21:42] God said to him, "Take your shoes off.
[1:21:44] Don't come any closer." In other words,
[1:21:47] stand still, reverence me, and know that
[1:21:50] I am God.
[1:21:53] Says, "I am the God of thy father and
[1:21:56] the God of uh of Abraham and the God of
[1:21:59] Isaac and the God of Jacob." And Moses
[1:22:02] hid his face, for he was afraid to look
[1:22:06] upon God.
[1:22:09] You know that is really what happens,
[1:22:10] brother Ron, when people come into the
[1:22:12] presence of God. It humbles them.
[1:22:17] It puts them in the place of reverence
[1:22:19] and respect.
[1:22:21] And I I I believe we just need we need
[1:22:26] to see God more. Moses speaking in uh to
[1:22:29] God in Exodus 33:13.
[1:22:32] He says, "Now therefore, I pray thee, if
[1:22:34] I have found grace in thy sight, show me
[1:22:37] now thy way that I may know thee." Yeah,
[1:22:42] I want that one up there. Write that
[1:22:44] down. That he he he's saying here, "Show
[1:22:47] me your way that I might know you." In
[1:22:49] other words, I'm not going to know you
[1:22:51] unless you reveal yourself to me. I I
[1:22:54] can't figure you out, God. I just become
[1:22:57] like everybody else who's got an
[1:22:59] opinion. But if you speak to me, I know
[1:23:01] that I will become more like you.
[1:23:06] God is close to us, much more closer
[1:23:09] than we realize. Think about this
[1:23:11] scripture Jesus speaking in Matthew 18
[1:23:14] 20. He says, "For where two or three are
[1:23:16] gathered together in my name, there am I
[1:23:20] in the midst of of them."
[1:23:23] How many times you've been talking to
[1:23:25] somebody
[1:23:31] But you didn't realize that God was
[1:23:33] there. But his word is even declaring
[1:23:36] that he is there in the midst.
[1:23:39] What about the two that walked on the
[1:23:41] road to Emmas? Luke chapter 24. Let's
[1:23:44] read a few verses there. Starting with
[1:23:46] verse number 14.
[1:23:48] The two that were walking on the road to
[1:23:50] Emmas, they were
[1:23:54] uh very disheartened because Jesus was
[1:23:57] crucified
[1:23:59] and uh it was the third day and um
[1:24:05] there was no sign of Jesus. And the
[1:24:08] Bible says in verse 14, "And they talked
[1:24:10] together of all these things which had
[1:24:14] happened. And it came to pass that while
[1:24:16] they communed together in reason that
[1:24:20] Jesus himself drew near and went with
[1:24:24] them. Now look at verse 16.
[1:24:27] But their eyes were holden that they
[1:24:31] should not know him.
[1:24:35] Showing us that God can be right here
[1:24:37] with us and our eyes are holden and we
[1:24:41] don't even know that he's here.
[1:24:44] And he said unto them, "What manner of
[1:24:46] communications are these that that you
[1:24:48] have one with another as you walk and
[1:24:50] are so sad?"
[1:24:52] I'm just I'm just wondering today how
[1:24:55] often our eyes are being holding because
[1:24:58] we're just too busy talking about
[1:25:00] problems in our life rather than saying,
[1:25:02] "God, I know you're going to help me
[1:25:04] with my needs."
[1:25:07] I wonder sometimes when we're not
[1:25:10] entering into the worship or the word if
[1:25:12] we're not recognizing God's presence.
[1:25:14] You know, sometimes we just come in the
[1:25:15] church and we kind of sit there and
[1:25:17] sometimes we don't even come into the
[1:25:18] church. Sometimes we're we're in the
[1:25:20] back and we're just kind of waiting
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; like like like we're here to meet God.
[1:25:27] I mean, this should be important. I tell
[1:25:28] you what I used to do when I used to
[1:25:30] play hockey.
[1:25:31] Hockey was important to me.
[1:25:34] And what I would do is I would prepare
[1:25:37] myself for hockey, brother Bman. I I
[1:25:40] would do this. I I would I would make
[1:25:42] sure I would start in the summertime and
[1:25:44] I would I would get in shape way before
[1:25:46] hockey ever started. So when I came, I
[1:25:50] didn't have to work on getting in shape.
[1:25:51] I could work on my skills.
[1:25:54] And every time there was a game uh or
[1:25:58] practice, I would come home and I would
[1:26:00] take a nap.
[1:26:02] So when I got to practice or the game, I
[1:26:05] was all in.
[1:26:07] I I wasn't tired. I wasn't sleepy. I I
[1:26:10] was ready because it meant a lot to me.
[1:26:13] And And sometimes you got to make
[1:26:15] sacrifices if you got to if you want to
[1:26:17] meet God, right? Sometimes you got to
[1:26:19] you got to stop early. You you got to
[1:26:21] get to bed the night before. You got to
[1:26:23] be prayed up. You got to get God. I want
[1:26:25] to know you more.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And God sees that that sacrifice willing
[1:26:30] to to to to do more for you. Brother
[1:26:34] Brandon said, people are always looking
[1:26:36] at what God has done in the past or what
[1:26:40] God is going to do in the future, but
[1:26:42] they fail to recognize what God is
[1:26:45] presently doing around them right now.
[1:26:47] What God is doing. God is the I am God.
[1:26:52] Moses asked one time to to to to God,
[1:26:56] who should I tell them is sending me
[1:26:59] down into Egypt, and he replied,"I am
[1:27:03] that I am." And he said, "Thus shall
[1:27:06] thou say unto the children of Israel, I
[1:27:09] am have sent me unto you." In other
[1:27:12] words, God always identifies himself as
[1:27:15] the I am God.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; He's a present help in a time of
[1:27:19] trouble. God is here to meet our needs
[1:27:22] now. He wants us to have faith in him
[1:27:24] now. He wants us to know him as a God of
[1:27:27] now. He's a present tense God. And
[1:27:30] you'll find in John 8 uh 58, if you want
[1:27:33] to write it down, that Jesus said,
[1:27:36] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, before
[1:27:37] Abraham was, I am."
[1:27:41] Amen. I am. We're getting ready to close
[1:27:44] real quickly. Paul said to them that
[1:27:48] didn't know Christ or simply wanted to
[1:27:50] know Christ more. So I'll say this like
[1:27:52] this. Wherever we're at, wherever we're
[1:27:55] staying with God, if you want to know
[1:27:57] God more, if you feel like, I really
[1:27:59] don't quite know him,
[1:28:02] know that if we just seek the Lord.
[1:28:06] Spend time seeking him. Set time aside
[1:28:09] to seek him, to feel after him. The
[1:28:12] Bible says that we will find him though
[1:28:15] he be not far from every one of us.
[1:28:18] Christ is here. He's not far off. Faith
[1:28:21] opens the door.
[1:28:24] And faith is taking a step towards God.
[1:28:26] And when we take a step towards God, the
[1:28:28] Bible says, "Draw nigh to God and he'll
[1:28:30] draw nigh to us." Jeremiah 29:12 and 13.
[1:28:35] Very familiar scriptures. Then shall ye
[1:28:38] call on me, and ye shall go and pray
[1:28:41] unto me, and I will hearken unto you. So
[1:28:44] when you go and you pray, you're getting
[1:28:46] still before God. And when you get still
[1:28:48] before God, God's going to hearken. But
[1:28:50] if you're too busy and you just got to
[1:28:51] kind of slide into church and slide out
[1:28:54] of church, and you know, you're you're
[1:28:56] not going to get to know God. You know,
[1:28:58] you you you've got to have a heart that
[1:29:00] you got to be willing to sacrifice, pay
[1:29:02] the price. Verse 13. And you shall seek
[1:29:05] me and find me when you search for me
[1:29:08] with all your heart.
[1:29:15] All your heart. All your heart. Here's
[1:29:18] the the beautiful thing that if you do
[1:29:21] come with all your heart, you will be
[1:29:23] rewarded.
[1:29:25] Jesus said in John 6:37, you want to
[1:29:28] write it down. All that the Father
[1:29:30] giveth me shall come to me, and him that
[1:29:34] cometh to me, I will in no wise cast
[1:29:38] out. There's a promise right there that
[1:29:41] if you come to God with all your heart,
[1:29:43] he's not going to cast you out. What a
[1:29:46] promise.
[1:29:49] Hebrews 11, we can stand together.
[1:29:51] Hebrews 11:6, but without faith, it's
[1:29:54] impossible to please him. For he that
[1:29:56] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:29:59] and that he's a rewarder of them that
[1:30:01] diligently seek him.
[1:30:05] Praise the Lord. I believe we can know
[1:30:08] God more. And I don't I don't think we
[1:30:11] have to rely on anybody. This is between
[1:30:14] us and God. This is us just getting
[1:30:17] still, being real with God. God, I want
[1:30:20] to know you more. Amen. Let's sing that
[1:30:22] chorus. I want to know you more. I want
[1:30:25] to know more.
[1:30:31] Amen. That's it.
[1:30:33] Oh, I want to know you more.
[1:30:38] Deep within my soul, I want to know you.
[1:30:43] Oh, I want to know you to feel your
[1:30:48] heart and know your mind.
[1:30:52] Looking in your eyes stirs up within me
[1:30:56] cries that say I want to know. I hope
[1:31:01] you feel those cries. Oh, I want to know
[1:31:05] you more.
[1:31:09] Oh, I want to know you more.
[1:31:14] Deep within my soul, I want to know you.
[1:31:19] Oh, I want to know you and I would give
[1:31:24] my final breath to know you in your
[1:31:28] death and resurrection.
[1:31:32] Oh, I want to know you more.
[1:31:38] Oh, I want to know you more.
[1:31:44] Oh, I want to know you more.
[1:31:49] Deep within my soul, I want to know you.
[1:31:54] Oh, I want to know you. To feel your
[1:31:58] heart and know your mind.
[1:32:02] Looking in your eyes stirs up within me.
[1:32:06] Cries that say, "I want to know
[1:32:11] you."
[1:32:13] Oh, I want to know you more. more.
[1:32:19] Oh, I want to know you more.
[1:32:23] Deep within my soul, I want to know you.
[1:32:28] Oh, I want to know you. And I would give
[1:32:33] my final breath.
[1:32:36] Know you in your death and resurrection.
[1:32:41] Oh, I want to know you more.
[1:32:47] Oh, I want to know you more
[1:32:52] when I look into your holiness.
[1:32:56] Amen.
[1:32:58] You know, the more you know God, the
[1:33:00] more you love him.
[1:33:04] Amen. He's a good God.
[1:33:07] He's a good God.
[1:33:10] Hallelujah. when I look into his
[1:33:13] holiness. Let's let's take a look. We we
[1:33:16] just
[1:33:18] we just read his word.
[1:33:20] Now, let's just enter in with our heart.
[1:33:22] Amen.
[1:33:24] When
[1:33:27] when I look into your holiness,
[1:33:34] when I gaze into your loveliness,
[1:33:41] when all things that surround me come
[1:33:45] shadows in the light of you.
[1:33:52] When I found the joy of reaching your
[1:33:56] heart,
[1:33:58] when my will becomes enthroned in your
[1:34:02] love,
[1:34:05] when all things that surround me become
[1:34:08] shadows in the light of you,
[1:34:15] I worship you.
[1:34:19] Amen. In spirit and truth, I worship
[1:34:22] you.
[1:34:27] The reason I live
[1:34:31] is to worship you.
[1:34:36] I worship you.
[1:34:41] I worship you.
[1:34:48] The reason I live
[1:34:52] is to worship you.
[1:34:55] Amen. What a message.
[1:34:58] When I look into your holiness.
[1:35:05] When I gaze into your loveliness.
[1:35:12] When all things that surround me come
[1:35:16] shadows in the light of you.
[1:35:22] When I found the joy of reaching your
[1:35:26] heart.
[1:35:29] When my will becomes enthroned in your
[1:35:33] love.
[1:35:35] When all things that surround me come
[1:35:39] shadows in the light of you,
[1:35:45] I worship you.
[1:35:50] I worship you.
[1:35:56] The reason I live
[1:36:00] is to worship you.
[1:36:06] I worship you.
[1:36:11] I worship you.
[1:36:17] The reason I live
[1:36:21] is to worship you.
[1:36:27] Amen. Amen. Let's just bow our hearts
[1:36:30] and go before the Lord in prayer.
[1:36:35] Maybe there's some things on your heart
[1:36:38] today. Let's just keep that before the
[1:36:40] Lord as we we go. I believe your your
[1:36:44] desire is to know God more. I'm not
[1:36:46] going to ask you to lift your hand, but
[1:36:48] I am asking you to lift your heart
[1:36:52] before the Lord
[1:36:54] just to believe with me as we go to him
[1:36:56] in prayer. Our heavenly father,
[1:36:59] thank you first for not being far from
[1:37:03] any one of us here today
[1:37:06] that you are very close to us. Just to
[1:37:09] have that
[1:37:11] that that knowledge or that that knowing
[1:37:15] it's encouraging that
[1:37:18] you haven't left us, you haven't
[1:37:20] forsaken us.
[1:37:22] and that Lord, whatever we have need of
[1:37:26] is very close to us because you're close
[1:37:28] to us
[1:37:30] and that you want to bless us above all
[1:37:35] that we could ask or even think
[1:37:38] and to know that is in our reach.
[1:37:43] Father, I pray for every brother here,
[1:37:45] every sister, those that are watching on
[1:37:48] the live stream, perhaps anyone that
[1:37:49] might be watching the archive down the
[1:37:52] road.
[1:37:56] Lord, I pray that you would bless each
[1:37:58] of us with a more
[1:38:02] stillness of a spirit that we could get
[1:38:05] before you, spend that time in prayer
[1:38:10] alone, waiting for you to come and speak
[1:38:14] to us, Lord,
[1:38:16] to reveal to us who you are in a greater
[1:38:20] measure because we want to know you
[1:38:22] more, Lord. We want to know you like the
[1:38:25] prophets of old. We want to know you
[1:38:27] more than in any other church age
[1:38:29] because this is the church age that will
[1:38:32] become just like you.
[1:38:35] Lord, I pray that you'd help each one of
[1:38:37] us to steal our minds, steal our
[1:38:39] thoughts, steal our our busy schedule,
[1:38:44] and just to get alone in prayer and to
[1:38:46] think on this one thing. God, I want to
[1:38:50] know you more.
[1:38:52] Bless your bride, Lord, because she's
[1:38:55] your wife.
[1:38:57] And and and
[1:38:59] the wife wants to know what her husband,
[1:39:03] the mind of her husband. And Lord, your
[1:39:05] prophet said that that the bride knows
[1:39:10] what she is to do with the word from her
[1:39:14] husband.
[1:39:16] And Lord, I pray that you'd help us to
[1:39:17] apply your word to our lives. Bless each
[1:39:21] one with this desire. They want to know
[1:39:23] you more, Lord, in their heart as they
[1:39:25] lift their heart to you and they say,
[1:39:27] "Yes, Lord, I want to know you more."
[1:39:30] May you begin to unveil yourself to
[1:39:33] them. And Lord, as they make the
[1:39:35] sacrifices, spending time with you, not
[1:39:38] just next service,
[1:39:40] but even tonight when they go home,
[1:39:43] tomorrow when they wake up.
[1:39:45] May they express that I want to know
[1:39:48] you, Lord. Spend that time being still.
[1:39:52] Lord, I pray as they diligently seek
[1:39:54] you, may you reward them according to
[1:39:56] your word. You're faithful. Lord, we
[1:39:58] love you. We commit ourselves to you. We
[1:40:01] thank you for all these things. We
[1:40:02] humbly pray.
