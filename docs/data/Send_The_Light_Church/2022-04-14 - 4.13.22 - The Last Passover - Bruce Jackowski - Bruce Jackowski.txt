TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] all things are possible only believe we believe it lord i receive lord i receive all things are possible [Music] lord i receive lord i receive lord i receive all things are possible lord i receive amen praise the lord amen turn with me uh this evening we want to just read one scripture here in luke chapter 22. amen just going to read one verse here verse 1. now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh which is called the passover amen let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer dear lord jesus heavenly father we're counting on you lord you said wherever two or three are gathered in your name lord you'd be in the midst so lord jesus we pray that you'll just reveal yourself to each and every one lord sometimes you can be here and and we miss you the lord we just pray tonight that none will leave but all will say it was good to be in the house of the lord i just pray you'll come and break the bread of life with us lord may you just walk with us lord through your word in jesus christ's name we ask it amen amen you may be seated amen so it's good to see you with your bibles don and i specifically were talking about that the other the other day and uh so we're gonna we're gonna do a little bible study tonight um and and it's gonna particularly be in matthew and luke and mark so it would be to your advantage to follow in your bible when we get there amen so i'd like to speak to you tonight about the last passover amen so we know in the religious world today we're in a most holy week is what they call it because we know that um next sunday or this coming up sunday is easter so that makes friday good friday i don't know why they call it good because they crucified him on that day and so that means last sunday was palm sunday and now we're in that week so a little bit of history the naming of the celebration we call easter easter's nowhere in the bible it's not even in the greek it's not in it's not the word easter goes back to the name of a pre-christian goddess in england esther who was celebrated at the beginning of spring so so easter really is rejoicing over the birth of esther or the birth of spring easter is celebrated on the first sunday after the full moon that occurs on or just after the spring equinox so if the full moon falls on a sunday then easter is on the next sunday so when we look i used to always laugh with my friends at work you know because just think about it we're all born we all have a birthday and if we've ever put somebody in the ground we have a day that we put them in the ground if you go and look at a tombstone it has a birthday and an end it looks a beginning date and an end date so we all know in the religious world jesus was born on the 25th of december right that's when we celebrate him at his birthday what is his death day it moves it moves and the reason it moves is that we're worshiping the birth of the son of the of the of spring the the spring equinox which happened this year um was on march 20th and the equinox is when the earth has the sunlight is the same amount during the day as it is at the night and the nicean council decided that well they wanted to make you know a lot of the pagan things come in to the church let's get you know to get the the unbelievers to become believers so they said they decided that the first full moon that occurs on or after the spring equinox the next sunday will be easter so the full moon for this year after the spring equinox which was on march 20th is this saturday so easter is this sunday so easter can float all the way from march 22nd all the way to april 25th now you think of thanksgiving thanksgiving is what always the third weekend or the third friday thursday and friday of november it's always then so if your argument is well we should we should have a celebration of the resurrection of christ which we should have and if we think why don't we just make it always the third weekend in april but they don't it's based on phases of the moon when i first was talking to a a catholic girl that was a good friend of mine when i told her that she said oh oh she said bruce she says the pope's gonna get you for this and then when we got close because most people even if you look in the newspapers and you look at everything there is nothing talking about the resurrection coming up this weekend lowe's having its spring sale target's having its spring sale everything is about the spring sale it's not about the resurrection of christ but we just believe it and when i think about it this this goddess who turned into diana in different cultures and that is the goddess of fertility and that's why there's eggs just as sister cheryl she told my wife she's getting 20 eggs a day from the chickens the chickens are laying like crazy so a chicken is a thing of of a fertility now i like peeps and i like chocolate candy i like all that stuff but as we progress because most all of us will spend time with our family this weekend it may become something that you be very careful with because you'll get eggs thrown at you but you'll you'll see the world is lost in the book of revelation it said the great she said she has become the she's made the nations of the world drunk with her doctrine her wine and and then her also her commerce and everything is all about generating money you know that's why that's the reason why culver's is having fish fries on friday night this is the only time of the year that culvers and burger king and everybody all they push fish all their commercials all change the fish they get it all on the outside and it's all based on the celebration of easter they want some of that money too amen so i really appreciate the resurrection if we don't have a resurrection on sunday if we don't celebrate the resurrection every day with our lives but you know the res without the resurrection we are totally lost if we don't have the sacrifice that takes place on friday evening we're lost there has to be these things amen so our opening scripture said so so we're going to take a little walk through the bible so it says the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh which is called the passover brother branham preached a message called the indictment and he said he quoted luke 23 33 where it says in there it says there they crucified him and brother branham said so there the greatest religious city they the most religious people crucified the most shameful death him the most precious person and that that if that ain't enough to condemn this generation their the most religious organization the biggest of all the churches gathered together in its one place and we're going to see it in the scriptures they the most religious people of all the races the people who were supposed to be the very worshipers of god they gathered in the greatest holy feast that they got the cleansing or the the passover when there was brought from bondage into liberty and there in that time they at that time the most religious people the most religious feast at the most religious place brought upon the prince of life the most shameful thing that could be done to strip a man and hang him on a tree because cursed is he says the law that they worshipped by cursed is he that hangs upon a tree and he was made a curse for us stripping his clothes beating him and mocking him the very god of heaven taking his clothes from him nailing him nailing him to a cross there they crucified him amen amen praise the lord let's start let's look here at saint john 12 amen so we're going to read here from verse 1. so we realize we're gonna just walk right into this we know that friday night they're gonna crucify him we know that we know that what happens in the garden the prayers in the garden and and the priests coming and getting him and him going in the judgment hall that happens tomorrow which is thursday but today we're at wednesday so the the scriptures opens up in saint john 12 1 it says then jesus six days before the passover and the passover lamb was going to be sacrificed on friday so six days before that which would have been last saturday he came to bethany where lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead amen and there they made him a supper and martha served but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him and then took mary a pound of ointment of spikard very costly and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment then saith one of the disciples judas iscariot simon's son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 pence and given to the poor thus he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and he had the bag and bare what was put there in then said jesus let her alone against the day of my burying she hath done this for the the poor always you have with you but me you have not always and much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there so this is important here even on saturday this brother branham in the indictment he said it was the greatest religious feast that they'd ever had and we're going to see that in the scriptures so there was many people had all come together pick to lazarus house because they wanted to see this man that had been dead four days four days he'd been dead and he was raised up and many people had come in and seen it and they'd heard about jesus and they heard about him breaking the loaves and the fishes and feeding the five thousand and feeding the four thousand and healing them the halt and then blind and and all these different ones they they saw that and then it attracted them amen so he says much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for jesus's sake only but they might see lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also to death because that by the reason of him many of the jews went away and believed on him amen amen i want you to notice there's a very particular thing that happens here at lazarus house dr schofield and if you've got a scofield bible he puts this note in there he says take a look at the three characters you have martha you have lazarus and you have mary you have martha who stands in a type as a servant she's waiting on all of them they've done this meal as a as a re as a respect and out of honor to jesus christ so martha stands and she serves them lazarus is sitting at the table that's what the scripture says and he types the believer who is having communion at the table and mary mary comes in and she's got this alabaster box and she pours it on his feet and she starts to wash his feet and with her tears and also to wipe it with her hair and that shows the real worship of the real believer the real believer comes to his feet and worships him many people came to his feet but all they wanted was something from him they came to his feet and said oh do this for me come to my you know the all this but mary at this meal she types the believer's true worship amen amen praise the lord amen so we see on saturday night jesus is there mary's there martha's there lazarus there the 12 disciples are there there's a great multitude has come in you know and they've all come to see who is this man jesus christ amen so in john's gospel when you get to verse 11 it says because now they're they're talking about how this gathering together even on saturday made the pharisees mad they didn't like it and they said they're going to get together and it says oh it doesn't it didn't even say the pharisees it just says the chief priests consulted how they might put lazarus to death because by reason of its many of the jews went away and believed on jesus verse 12 says on the next day much people that were come to the feast when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem remember brother branham said he said it was the most religious people coming to the most religious feast but this feast the next setting of scriptures cannot take place without some very key things happening amen brother branham in the attraction on the mountain he says what is the attraction the attraction is the predestinated seed of god who can't do nothing else but follow the attraction means mortal life to us take our lives but you can't take that what is the attraction god as usual he's fulfilling his word he is fulfilling the word of zachariah again of the prophet zechariah so let's go back here to zechariah 9. amen zachariah 9 verse 9 says rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a cult the fowl of an ass so zachariah gave this prophecy and identified jesus not as a rabbi it doesn't say behold the rabbis coming he said your king's coming your king's coming amen brother branham said he says so he says when i read on the ninth verse as a while ago when jesus entered his temple riding or entered into jerusalem writing on a little white donkey the prophecy was fulfilled that zachariah said here it is rejoice greatly o daughters of zion shout o daughters of jerusalem behold thy king is coming unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly riding upon an ass and upon the cult of the fowl of an ass that's what the attraction was at jerusalem at that religious headquarters amen so let's take a look here at matthew 21. and i'm looking through my bible too so matthew 21 verse 1 says and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to beth edge unto the mount of olives then sent jesus to disciples so you want to see so saturday they have this feast they have it at lazarus house but jesus had already if the prior scriptures and the other the prior places in the gospels had already said his eyes he was steadfast to go to jerusalem so he stopped off at lazarus house they hang in his on his way to jerusalem and he has to make a stop he has to make a stop look at mark 11 1. so mark 11 1 says and when they came nigh to jerusalem unto beth edge and bethany at the mount of olives so he comes to the mount of olives and then he stops he stops he has to stop at the mount of olives look at luke 19. let's go over there now am i going too fast okay roger says i'm not going too fast so we're all right now we're going to be down at verse 28 and when he had thus spoken he went before ascending up to jerusalem and it came to pass when he came nigh to beth edge and bethany at the mount called the mount of olives he sent two of his disciples why why did he stop there brother branham said he said in he says so now he had been a very weary nervous day it was an unusual day and we find jesus here coming up to jerusalem ready to attend the passover and the passover is where the paschal lamb was to be killed and the blood would be spread upon the mercy seat for the atonement of the people and he had come to from bethage and had come to the top of the mount of olives which looks down upon another little hill where jerusalem was built and as he looked he know that this was his final visit now john john records he he just goes he says okay the priest got all mad the next day he's on the donkey but there's something that god has to do here we're starting at verse 29 in luke 19 verse 29 he says and it came to pass as he was nigh to bethage in bethany at the mount called the mount of olives he sent two of his disciples saying go ye into the village over against you and the witch that you're entering in you shall find a colt tide whereon yet never a man set loose him and bring him here and if any man ask you why do you loose him thus show you saying to him because the lord hath need of him and they that were sent went their way and found even as he had said unto them and as they were loosing the cold the owners thereof said unto them why lucie the cold and they said the lord hath need of him and they brought him to jesus and they cast their garments upon the cult and they sent jesus thereon so i want to read all three of these before i tell you let's go back now to luke 11. you'll notice that mark 11 in in luke 19 he doesn't talk about the the donkey and the fool of the donkey but zechariah was very specific he was very specific in mark 11 it says um we started verse and when they came nigh to jerusalem unto beth edge and bethany at the mount of olives he sent forth two of his disciples and he said unto them go your way into the village over against you and as soon as you be entered into it you should find a cold tide whereupon never a man set loose him and bring him and if any man say unto you why do you do this say ye that the lord hath need of him and straightway he will send him here and they went their way and they found the cult tied by the door without in a place where two ways meet and they loose him and certain of them that stood there said unto them what do you loosen the coal and they said unto them even as jesus had commanded and they let them go and they brought the cult to jesus and cast their garments on him and he sat upon him amen so let's go to matthew 21 and see how matthew records this matthew 21 starting with verse 1. so he says and when they drew nyan to jerusalem and they had come to beth edge unto the mount of olives then sent jesus two disciples so you notice that in all three of these when they got to the mount of olives jesus stopped jesus stopped he turned to two of his disciples and he said i want you to go into a city i want you to take a little walk i want you to go down there and well let's go to verse two it says so saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway you shall find an ass tide and a cult with her loose them and bring them unto me matthew sees that there's two and if any men say odd unto you you shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them and all of this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughter of zion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sitting on an ass and the colt the fowl of an ass and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the colt both of them and put their clothes on them and they said him aren't there on they said him thereon jesus comes up to brother branham and things that are to be says god in the beginning being the infinite god he is he is infinite rather and we're finite his mind is so much greater and we in our little finite minds we can't understand his great infinite wisdom his ways are past finding out but therefore when he speaks anything it may seem very strange to us to hear him say a certain thing in the scripture but then it's got to happen i believe that his words will never pass away and therefore i believe that god knowing that we are in our own little finite minds and we cannot interpret his his great mind he interprets his own word then he doesn't need any interpreter he interprets his own word by vindicating that word in its season after zechariah prophesied there was many men who thought they could buy a a donkey and then have a fall of a donkey and place any religious leader on it and say behold your king but that would not have been zechariah's prophecy because god's word has to be fulfilled in its season at its right time brother branham says we can't even comprehend god's ways of doing things so jesus being the word of god when he came up to the mount of olives he could have walked all the way into jerusalem but the word of god constrained him the word of god zechariah one day when he was out and he's maybe he's at church maybe he's in the parking lot i don't know exactly where he was at but the spirit of god fell on zechariah and he prophesied and when he prophesied the thoughts of god was now being revealed but the word being spoke is not the same as the word being fulfilled so the word was spoken by zechariah the prophet jesus being the god prophet they went to him many times and said why isn't this one healed why don't you do this why don't you go over here if you're this or that you know like the devil took him to the top of the of the temple and he showed him he says look he says if you're the son of god he says just cast yourself down doesn't the word say that your feet will not dash against a stone that angels will lift you up he said aren't you hungry turn these stones into bread jesus had the power to do that because he took two loaves and five fishes and fed five thousand so he could have done that but he said no the word of god has to be fulfilled in its season in its time jesus said he said i can do nothing unless the father shows me first amen so jesus saw a vision and he picked two of his disciples and the disciples being men who didn't understand god in their midst they weren't converted yet they never understood jesus he was a mystery to them they they here they are there's two brothers he calls them aside he said this is what i want you to do i want you to go into a city i want you to go this city over here it's near us he says when you get to the city he says you will find a cult and the foul you'll find a donkey in a in its offspring you will find them tied up and he says and when you find them i want you to loose them and bring them here and he says and he says if anybody comes up to you and asks you why are you doing this this is what you should tell them the lord hath need of these and straightway they will let you come these brothers only had jesus's words that's all they had but jesus had the mind of the father and when they started to walk and they walked into the city and found the cult just exactly like he said they started walking right into the thoughts of god and god's thoughts were now being manifested by these men and when they got to the cult you'll notice that the one gospel evangelist that's what they call him mark said he says he found him at the corner of two ways belief faith and unbelief because when they got to the cult they must have said wow this is this is exactly what he told us and now they're they're in between because the owner of the cult comes out and says hey hey hey hey you know what are you doing and now they're going to make up their mind god won't ever reveal anything to you that won't bring you to a place of decision where you have to make up your mind are you going to believe the word of god or are you going to walk away from it they could have said well well i'm sorry i didn't mean it i didn't mean it bye maybe i misunderstood maybe i didn't maybe i didn't get the message right you know and they could have left but they said no he told us what to say and when they said exactly what jesus told them what to say the men said god bless you and they took the cult and the foul they took them and they brought them back to jesus and they put the things they put their garments on them and now zachariah zechariah's prophecy could be fulfilled because now jesus is at the mount of olives jerusalem's the next mountain down and zechariah's prophecy said behold thy king cometh riding on a donkey and the fall of a donkey and he said rejoice saying hosanna in the highest amen and he could not move until all those scriptural things were in their right place amen praise the lord praise the lord brother branham said see it may be strange to us to hear him say a certain thing in the scripture but you see it's got to happen and i believe that his word will never pass away therefore i believe that god knowing that we are with our little finite minds and we cannot interpret his great mind he will interpret his own word he doesn't need any interpreter he'll interpret his own word by vindicating that word in its season praise the lord so in matthew 21 because that's what we're at let's continue on so in verse seven it says and they brought the ass and the colt and put him on set their um put on them their clothes and they sent him there on and a great multitude spread their garments in the way and others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way and the multiple two that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and when he was coming to jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this because whenever jesus comes around you have the elect you have the unbelievers you have the make-believers everybody the whole city was moved when they heard all this noise and him coming down the mount and there are the religious leaders standing there watching him and he's coming down and everybody is screaming saying hosanna to the glory to god in heaven amen because zachariah said they said oh this is the son of david which is the king and they knew that was the king and he was coming down to the passover amen amen let's take a look at mark 11. so we read matthew 21 let's see how mark 11 talks about the same thing mark 11 starting at verse 8 and many spread their garments in the way and others cut down the branches of the tree and straw them in the way and they that went before and they that followed cried saying hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord blessed be the kingdom of our father david that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and jesus entered into jerusalem and straight away went into the temple and when he had looked around and bound upon all things he came down he went directly he didn't go to the palace he didn't go to where herod was he went to where his throne was he went down there and you'll notice that in mark he just quotes the people that are saying hosanna blessed be the name of the lord matthew quotes the make-believers because they don't know who he is they go who is he who is this guy and of course the pharisees the sadducees and herodians and all the denominations they didn't know who he was anyway so so let's go here to luke let's look at luke 19. praise the lord amen so in luke 19 starting with um verse 36 well let's start with verse 35 and they brought him they brought the colt and the fowl the the the baby they brought him to jesus and they set their garments upon the colt and they led jesus there on and as he went they spread their clothes in the way and when he was come nigh even now to the descent of the mount of olives you see why he had to stop he had to stop right there he had to be at the right place at the right time the word of god has to be fulfilled amen and it says when he started to descend out of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest and the unbelievers some of the pharisees which were among the multitudes said unto him master rebuke your disciples tell them to be quiet you see in all three of these different settings in the bible you see a different set of people they're all worshiping god but some are saying i don't know who he is who is he the pharisees and sadducees and they're going no no no this is this you know you shouldn't be like this out outside of the temple you shouldn't even do this telling them to be quiet and jesus answered and said unto them i tell you that if they should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out amen praise the lord amen amen and go tell my disciples when jesus came walking into jerusalem and they cut down the palms and they begin to scream and cry and carry on like that some of those starchy pharisees they said make them hold their peace why they give us the shivers oh how them people are screaming and carrying on and he said to them he says if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out something has to come when life comes amongst death there is a resurrection there's bound to be amen so when jesus come down the mount the believers got fired up because they saw the word of god being made manifest amen the make-believer said i don't get it the pharisees said i get it he's not right they saw it right away amen praise the lord and who do you say this is brother brethren says so now watch now here he comes writing into the city and just exactly what the word said he would do riding on a little donkey coming into the city and those who were not looking at the creed and not looking at the temple not looking at these other things not looking at the priests whatever they had to say those that believed him they were standing there with their palm on their in their hand just waiting the first move you never heard them say who is this no because they knew who he was they knew what the word said and the other class you see them back there in the city and then when they heard the noise hosanna to the king hosanna to the king that comes in the name of the lord hosanna hosanna and all the screaming and the priests run out there to see what the religious commotion was all about and the people said who is this what what were they there for friends they had all come together for a religious feast the very god that had them to ordain this feast told him that he was going to come to the feast and they didn't know who he was they didn't know amen now we're still in luke right so if you look at luke 19 so in verse 40 and he answered and so he's speaking to the pharisees to the unbelievers i tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out and when he was come near he's still coming down out of the mount of olives as he comes down and approaches jerusalem and he sees the city he weeps saying if thou hast known even thou at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes because they could not place the word of god in its rightful place and because they rejected him as a king look what he says in verse 43 he says for the day shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee encompass thee round and keep thee in on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation amen amen they couldn't see it blessed are your eyes for you see praise the lord amen amen so um so look at what happened so he's he's coming down he's coming down off the mount of olives and now he gets to verse 45 and where does he go he goes right into the temple and when he gets to the temple because remember we read the out of the scripture i believe it was in mark and it said when he got there he got to jerusalem he went to the temple he looked around and he left but the scriptures here says when he went to the temple and he began to cast them out that sold therein and them that bought saying unto them it is written my house is the house of prayer but you have made it a den of thieves and he taught daily in the temple but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him you know when the word of god is being made manifest people that don't agree the pharisees didn't agree with the sadducees they didn't agree with the herodians they didn't agree with the scribes they didn't agree but when they saw jesus and the influence that the word of god had when it was made manifest they could all come together and agree on one thing we're getting rid of this guy we've got to get rid of him amen praise the lord amen and they could not find a um but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him and could not find what they might do for all the people were very attentive to hear him so how far have we come we know that saturday he went down to bethany and he was at lazarus house this is the very next day this is just sunday and he's already caused all this commotion and when he gets to the temple the very first thing is he cleans it out but the bible says that he's continue in the temple teaching daily so now you got monday he's teaching tuesdays he's teaching wednesday he's teaching he stays there right amen praise the lord let's take a look at what mark 11 says about this thing amen hopefully you're seeing a nice picture praise the lord mark 11 starting at verse 15. and you'll see here and they came to jerusalem and jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple and he taught saying unto them it is it not written my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayers but you have made it into a den of thieves and the scribes and the chief priests heard it and they sought how they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people were astonished at his doctrine and when even was come he went out of the city amen amen so every night we're going to see in the scriptures that every night so he went in on sunday he came down he came riding in on on the donkey and we and he he went and he went straight to the temple and when he got to the temple he cleaned the place up and then he went back out to lazarus house then he comes back the next day and he's teaching in the temple and then he goes back out to lazarus house and then he comes back and he teaches in the temple and then he goes back to lazarus house because you'll see that in every one of these scriptures he always goes back to bethany and beth edge amen praise the lord so we read mark so let's take a look at matthew 21 amen matthew 21 starting with verse 12. and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all of them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves and he said unto them it is written my house should be called the house of prayer but you have made it a den of thieves and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them see he was even doing healing services in the temple praise the lord praise the lord amen and when the chief priests and the scribes saw these wonderful things oh they got really mad and the children crying in the temple saying hosanna to the son of david they were so displeased amen they were not happy with that and they said unto him hearst now what these people are saying and jesus said unto them yea have you never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings that was perfected phrase praise and he left them and went out of the city into bethany and he lodged there you see so he keeps going back out so he comes out and remember that when he came to jerusalem at this feast was the only time that he came to jerusalem as behold thy king before he came as rabbi before he came as you know some other office but when zachariah prophesied said behold thy king and the king came malachi 3 verse 1 says and the king will suddenly appear at the temple he will come suddenly and the king came and the king came and judged the temple and what did he find did he find a house of prayer a place of worship did he find what the temple in jerusalem was supposed to be i will only meet you in the place where my name is that was that was the promise to solomon and everybody else you know jonah when jonah said i will now turn my eyes towards thy holy temple and when i pray you'll hear me and when jesus the king came on the donkey and he fulfilled the scriptures and he came in and he came and he looked around he said this is not what my word said it should be and he left he cleaned it out and then he left and verse 17 so we're still in matthew and he and he left them and he went out of the city into bethany and he lodged there now in the morning and we don't know whether it's monday or tuesday or wednesday but we know it was morning and when it was morning he returned into the city he was a hungered and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing there on but leaves only and he said unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforth forever and presently the fig tree withered away amen amen i want you to look at mark uh no i got here i suppose all right let's and when the disciples saw it they marveled saying how soon is the fig tree withered away and jesus answered and said unto them verily i say unto you if you have faith and doubt not it shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing you shall receive amen but why is he picking on the fig tree at mark 11. amen amen mark 11 verse 12. now mark the way he records this is different than the way matthew recorded it because verse 11 says and jesus entered into jerusalem and into the temple and when he had looked around about upon all things and now it was evening time he went out onto bethany with the twelve and on the morrow when they were come from bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the times of figs was not yet and jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever and his disciples heard it and look what he does he goes to the jerusalem goes to the temple and what does he find a fig tree with no fruit let's go to luke 21 amen luke 21 verse 29 and he said he spake to them a parable saying behold the fig tree and all the other trees but the fig tree was his his bride israel is my firstborn israel this is my people that's who the fig tree is the fig trees jerusalem the fig tree is israel fig tree is abraham's children that's who i'm coming for i'm your king don't you know who i am and when you come to the fig tree look at what jesus says he says behold the fig tree and now when it when it now shall shoot forth you see and know it is your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand so likewise when you see these things come to pass know that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand when what did jesus say he told him he says when he lamented over israel right they rejected him as king and he said if you'd have recognized the day of your visitation it would have been well with you it would have been well with you if i came and you hadn't desecrated the temple amen the leaves on a fig tree indicate that summer was nigh and that fruit might be reasonably expected especially since a fig tree bears fruit before leaves why don't you just shrivel up the vine i mean right i am the vine you're the branches isn't that that's not figs that's a wine grapes so when he came down to jerusalem why didn't he say oh look there's there's a vineyard here oh and there's no grapes when he comes down off the mountain and he and he goes out he comes back matthew said when he came in he looked around and he said i cannot believe you call this my house and he walks out he comes back he cleans the place out he walks out he comes back sees the fig tree and because it's got leaves on it he's expecting fruit on his tree and when he comes and he looks and he sees there's no more fruit he already knows he's been judged unworthy of his kingship he rejects israel right there amen praise the lord amen when you go back and look at this you'll see that mark splits the death of the tree between the entry and the cleansing of the temple matthew just kind of puts it in there he puts it in there amen amen praise the lord and when he curses the fig tree he goes back in and you know his message kind of changed after the fig tree died because he went and if you go and take him we're not going to do it tonight but you go home tonight tomorrow and now you probably got good friday off you should have good friday off because it's a good friday right but see the world doesn't even believe in easter anymore we just we're just thinking about bunny rabbits and cadbury eggs and and you know kit kat candy bars and and peeps love peeps you know you're just thinking about all these things but brother and sister this is supposed to be the the time for us to worship god because god is getting ready to fulfill his word amen amen and we only got to wednesday it started on saturday he started on saturday at lazarus house and i'm showing you he came up the very next day the scripture says it very next day very next day very next day it says there in in john 12 he says six days before the passover which is thursday right and they killed the lamb on friday amen amen praise the lord amen judgment's preached jesus's authority is questioned and if you go and look at all the scriptures you start with with matthew 26 and read the next couple of chapters the very first thing that the the religious leaders they all band together oh they couldn't agree on anything before the god had ah baptism they can't agree on nothing but once jesus started to do the things that he did oh okay yeah we can we can get together on this guy he's a little bit too much for our taste amen he rebuked all the religions in jerusalem it's in matthew mark luke john every one of them right after palm sunday going look right after palm sunday he's preaching judgment judgment judgment judgment judgment because they rejected him as he came down out of the mount of olives because they rejected him as their king amen because they rejected him as malachi 3 saying behold thy king will suddenly appear at his temple amen amen and also in all that time when he's preaching those things he starts preaching about the gentiles and what they're going to do and the gentile kingdoms and everything else amen amen praise god praise the lord amen amen let's go to matthew 26 amen so now during this short time matthew 26 verse 1 amen look at how this is written verse one it says and it came to pass when jesus had finished all these sayings he said unto his disciples you know that after two days is the feast of the passover so it's today he tells them today's the day guys and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified you remember when i read that quote brother branham said our finite minds can't understand god we can't figure him out at all he's telling them exactly what's going to happen and they didn't believe him even when they were running away and hiding he told him that in the garden he says you know what he says the shepherd's going to be smote and you guys are all going to run away and they said not me i ain't running away nope nope peter said i got a sword i'll stick it out oh i promise jesus looked at him and said peter you know what they that live by the sword die by the sword by the time the crows he said you'll deny me three times and peter said not on your life not on your life i'm not going back on this well yeah that's a whole nother message but yeah they all ran away they didn't they could not understand god's word until after pentecost when the god that was that wrote the word came into their hearts to live the word amen because you can't live this thing without it amen you know that after two days the feast of the passover and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified then assembled don't you see look he says then assembled together the chief priests the scribes the elders under the palace of the high priest who was called cahiaphus and they consulted how they might make jesus take jesus by subtility and kill him how do you sneak up on this guy he's the god of heaven he's the god of heaven how do you sneak up on him by subtility huh let me tell you let me see how that works out praise the lord amen 26 okay so it's so they decided they said well we don't want to do it at the feast day which is friday don't do it friday lest there be an uproar among the people because everybody's here brother branham said the most religious people the most religious city the most religious feast everybody's here let's not let's not do it then we got it because when they took him was thursday they didn't take him friday they took him thursday and they took him by subtility they took him in the garden when he was in prayer it wasn't out in the open they didn't you know because at one time they came and they confronted him and he said look he said didn't i teach daily in the temple and none of you touched me and they are sneaky politicians they said well we got to do stuff in the dark because that's where we live amen now i want you to notice so now when jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper so now we found in in saint john 12 that before on saturday jesus was at lazarus house and on saturday martha was there mary was there and lazarus was there and we told you how the types of the believer and the worshiper and and the servant they were all there amen and so now it says in jesus was in bethany at the house of simon the leper so so one of his trips back out of the city i don't know on monday or tuesday or wednesday when he went out he goes to simon the leper's house and there came into him or unto him a woman having an alabaster box a very precious ointment and poured it on his head not on his feet before this whole drama started mary came and anointed his feet and after all this has taken place the fig tree being cursed and all of that he goes to simon the leper's house and some other woman comes in and anoints his head it's very specific it is very specific because i went back and looked at it i said wait a minute i okay because the theologians all say that this is the same mary lazarus sister because martha and mary and lazarus were brothers and sisters but this mary is not that mary because the other one is very specific john says it's her feet and here it's not even in the same house it's very specific and it's on her head his head but when his disciples saw it they had indignation and saying to what purpose is this waste for the ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor and when jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye this woman for she hath wrought a good work unto me for you have the poor always with you but me you have not always for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial verily i say unto you wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done to be told for a memorial of her amen amen let's go to mark um 14. let's take a look here praise the lord i haven't worn you out yet have i amen mark 14. starting in verse 1 it says in two days was the feast of the passover and an unleavened bread okay so this is two days before the feast of the passover so we know that's well we know the passover that was the meal that was thursday night so thursday night tuesday night say an hour on tuesday night and the chief priests and the scribes saw it how that they might take him by craft and put him to death but they said not on the feast day unless there be an uproar of the people so that's the exact same recording we wrote read elsewhere and verse 3 says and being in bethany in the house of simon the leper as he sat at me there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spiker very precious and she break the box and poured it on his head and there were some that had ignation within themselves and said why was this waste of the ointment made see they were believers but they were still upset they were upset for it might have been sold more for more than 300 pence and could have been given to the poor and they murmured against her and jesus said let her alone why trouble ye her she hath wrought a good work on me for you have the poor with you always and wheresoever you will and whensoever ye will you may do them good but me you have not always and she has done that what she could she has come beforehand to anoint my body to the bearing verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world this also should be done shall be spoken as a memorial of her amen amen praise god amen so let's go to matthew 26. praise the lord so we see we see that this whole week started on saturday with a feast and everybody was there all the believers were there and a whole bunch of other people that were just curious were there and then jesus got up the next day and he he walked up he got close to the mount of olives he got to the mount of olives and he said oh wait a minute there's scriptures that have to be fulfilled i can't just go down with zechariah standing there because those are my thoughts and my thoughts have to be fulfilled praise the lord i just when i think of that it just makes me happy when i think i'm free from sin and death that makes me happy too and if i get a bunny rabbit out of it too then i'm okay with that amen you see god is trying to show us something amen so in matthew 26 starting at verse um 17 amen now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus so it's during this period of time they come to jesus saying unto him where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover and jesus said go into the city to such a man go to a specific man see he says that to such a man and say unto him the master saith my time is at hand i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples and the disciples did as jesus had appointed appointed them and they made ready the passover okay now let's look at mark 14. praise the lord mark 14 verse 12 and on the first day of unleavened bread when they killed the passover his disciples said unto him where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover and he saith he sendeth forth two of his disciples and he saith unto them go into the city and there shall you meet a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him and wheresoever he shall go in say to the good man of the house the master saith where is the guest chamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples and he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared there make ready for us and his disciples went forth and came into the city and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover amen so now let's go to luke 22. amen praise the lord let's go to luke 22. god's so wonderful he's got all these little nuggets he just all these then came the day of unleavened bread when the passover must be killed and he sent peter and john before just said two of his disciples but now in luke he says these are the guys that i'm sending i'm sending peter because i trust him and i'm sending john because i love him and i'm sending them go and prepare us the passover that we may eat now if you were paying attention and you remember what we said before this could not happen without jesus seeing a vision and when he spoke the word to them they were at a crossroads they had to believe him or doubt him but because they're believers they believed him right they believed him and they in they said unto him well where where are we going to go tell us what you want us to do and he says unto them behold when you are entered into the city this is jerusalem there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water follow him into the house where he entereth into and you shall say unto the good men of the house this is the second guy the master saith unto thee where is the guest chamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples and he shall show you a large upper room furnished their make ready and they went and they found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover amen amen they went into this city and they started looking you know in all the bible and all the bible and all the scriptures you can look anywhere you want brother mark there are no men with pictures of water rebecca went out to the well the woman that had seven husbands went out to the well there's no men with a pitcher of water what a strange thing to go into a city and find a man with a pitcher of water and he's singing it shall be light about the evening time the path to glory you will surely find the waterway is the light today baptized in the name of jesus christ young and old repent of all your sins the holy ghost will surely enter in the evening time has come it's a fact that god and christ are one when was the passover the evening time who is the man with the water pot amen you know if you didn't find the man with the water pot you can't go into the good man in the house you know the good man of the house is the householder the guy that owns the house but if you don't get your baptism right you can't go the next step if you still and under father son and holy ghost or under sprinkling or something else and you haven't heard the man singing the song you can't go in you can't go in they went down they found the man with the water pot and they went and when they got there they found they found that's what brother branham said he says i have come and introduced you to the good man of the house i have introduced you to jesus christ not a creed not somebody's idea not somebody's interpretation he said i have given you the word amen amen and when they found the good man of the house what did they find they found an upper everything is prepared for you a new body all the prayers your health your job your family it's all prepared they didn't have to do nothing they didn't have to bring anything they don't have to go oh what is jesus going to want i don't think there's probably a couple of buckets of wine maybe we need to bring bread maybe we need you don't have to bring anything just find the man with the water pot find the man with the water pot follow the water pot he'll get you there he'll get you there he'll get you to the holy ghost and when you come in fellowship with the holy ghost you will find an upper room completely prepared everything that you have need of brother branham said everything you have need of to get you from here into that new body is already written in the word amen praise god praise the lord amen amen brother branham said it shall be light about the evening time god's only chosen place to worship not out in the denominations anymore because they got a water pot we got a man with a water pot we got a man that knows the path we've been lost all these years we've been worshiping easter bunnies and and all these other things in santa claus and all of a sudden something all of a sudden one day we saw a man with a water pod amen amen and when you receive his message it becomes part of you and you're no longer walking in darkness but your eyes even though you were blind now you can see amen praise the lord praise god all with a message to come what is he going to do in his day he shall be light at the evening time and what to welcome his children back home to the true promised land by the same pillar of fire that led the children of israel through the wilderness god's chosen place of worship where in the upper room amen and that's what it said said go to the good man of the house and ask him where shall we meet he said he'll take you in an upper room and he says and when you get there you'll find everything you need everything you need just ask ask and you believe that's what you said when they saw the fig tree whether or not they said oh oh this is a bad thing he said look he says when you pray believe and believe that you receive the things that you ask for amen he says if you ask anything in my name i'll do it amen amen we're in that upper room now amen praise the lord amen god's chosen place of worship jesus christ that's the only place there is that's the only name god has for salvation that's what he has named the family of heaven and when
