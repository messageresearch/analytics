========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Applause] [Music] like [Applause] the my hands I lift up my hands to the Lord singing I Love You Lord singing I Love You Lord singing I Love You Lord I love you in moment like PE I sing out a song I sing out a love song to [Music] Jesus in moments like these I lift up my hands I lift up my hands to the [Music] Lord I love you Lord singing I Love You Lord I love you Lord I love you amen and it's brother Ron open in a word of prayer amen love amen amen you may be seated amen so I want you to feel that presence so when you come in the sanctuary that's why we come early and pray because this is a sacred place and every part of the service is sacred and whether you're doing songs or your leading songs or you're doing a special or you're praying over the service it's a very special thing and Satan is always looking for just a little crack where he can slip in and cause confusion and raise questions and do terrible things so we saw that Wednesday and my motive even no matter how much you pray there's always he's looking for a little sliver just a little place so I just want to say I'm sorry that I cause confusion and rais questions and doubts that's not my motive or my ideas or so I just want to ask everyone all of you to forgive me and that's just it's something that that's the reason why it's so important to come and pray but that's not a guarantee either you have to Be watchful he said Be watchful he says for your adversary who's not your brother or your sister but your adversary the devil he sneaks around you know a roaring lion the if he yells he's already got you cuz you're not going to move you know anything about lions so please pray for Brother John and anyone the song leaders all of us that have a part in the service because

amen amen um would you mind uh just just remaining stand just for a minute or you can be seated if you want we'll stand here I just wanted to show some some pictures from um the Philippines that we've been praying we sent some money down for the food um for the need there and our sister uh Chi-Chi had gave us some pictures we want to share those she said sharing with you some pictures of the pastor in bico Providence as he distributed sacks of rice to some families in his church please pray for them as another typhoon is set to hit the Providence this week now it did get diverted but where it went to it's starting to cause some flooding and havoc in areas that they really hadn't seen before so she wants us to continue to pray for them each sack of rice is about 55 to 60 pounds prices have become exorbitant because of the lack of Supply he was able to distribute 12 families and will buy some more for the families that were not home part of the money went for the bags of rice and some went to the people in the neighborhood and gave out rice and canned goods to about 119 families so we just praise the Lord for that there's a little one minute video or so we're going to show and then we'll it's wonderful that we have Avenues to get this to the needy without getting to amen amen praise the Lord also this morning I want to thank God for his goodness this morning amen he is good to us let's look to the Lord in prayer and then we'll enter into the scriptures here in Mark chapter 12 for message this morning our heavenly father we want to thank you that you're still Lord of lords and king of of Kings you're still greater than all Lord we want to thank you for being the very head of this church Lord that there's still Hearts here Lord that want you to be the head of their lives Lord we just pray that You' bind up any spirit that would try to crevice its way inside our minds our thoughts that you'd remove every doubt and Lord that we could become one with you one with your word fully believing and holding to your word which we know cannot live it is forever s to heaven and we love your word we love your word Lord we love you may you feel our heart as we not not only say Amen to your word but we receive that engrafted word today help our lives that when we would leave here we could SA aured that your word affected us it had an effect on our life and that we're taking it home with us and we're going to apply these things that we have heard this morning into our personal homes father we'll be grateful if you do this work of Grace for each one of us today commit the service and ask your blessings and the word now in Jesus Christ name we thank you amen amen Mark chapter 12 Mark chapter 12 as you're turning there we uh we want to just uh do part two of our last Sunday service on admiration and we want to entitle this message respect and admiration respect and admiration and we're going to just take our opening text here in Mark 12 starting with verse number [Music] 13 and they send unto Jesus certain of the Pharisees and of the heronian to catch him in his words and when they were come they said unto him Master we know that thou art true and carest for no man for thou regardest not the person of men but teaches the way of God in truth is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not and shall we give or shall we not give but he know knowing their hypocrisy said unto them why tempt ye me bring me a penny that I may see it and they brought it and he saith unto them who is this image and sub uh superscription and they said unto him Caesars and Jesus answering said unto them render to Caesar the things that are Caesars and to God the things that are gods and they marveled at him God bless you may be seated they marveled they saw respect they saw admiration even for Caesar who was the Emperor or the ruler of Rome now Jesus could have called out all the negative stuff that Caesar did we know we just read history that there was nothing there was so much cruelty and evil and persecution and and robbing and and they use people they murder people all for their own gain and they were allowed to do that because they their Emperor but Jesus chose not to say that he could have easily gave reason to not respect Caesar to not respect and not to have admiration but he said instead render to Caesar the things that are Caesars right amen I just I love that he wasn't trying to cause some problem you you and he could he's God he's the only one that Vengeance belongs to and be right about it but we see here the nature of God and that he he is he is a real gentleman at all times he's a real gentleman just because he used the whip he's still a gentleman amen just because he called certain people out he was still a gentleman but he's God and he I believe his wife has the same kind of respect that he does am now it doesn't mean the churches are but I believe God's wife is Jesus believed in submission to Authority Romans 13 says render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom Fear To whom fear honor to fear oh no man anything amen if somebody deserves if somebody needs to be honored then you you honor them if they need to be tributed if there's a custom you you give them what you know just come somebody comes up to you and smile what are you going to do frown at them you're going to smile back you're going to give back to them oh no man anything but in but to love one another right for he that loveth one another has fulfilled the law am I think about this this great subject the word respect is a feeling of deep admiration for someone and God is wanting us to have that and it's really hard to find that sometimes when you're fighting with somebody or you don't believe in something that they're doing admiration is to feel respect and approval for someone and it's hard to do that when you really have a problem with somebody but there's always something that you can find here's an example I found in the dictionary I've always admired her for her generous spirit I admire his courage and determination so if you could look at the things that are good and not allow the things that are bad to stand in front of you because that's what gets us to a place where we begin to lose respect as soon as you lose respect you really lost it for yourself the very fact that you cannot you cannot find something with somebody is showing that you aren't because to the pure all things are pure right but to the evil and undefiled all they see is negative stuff that's there's a difference between a negative mindset and a positive mindset but we're not just going to go home and all of sudden be respectful and and and and and and give to everybody their dues if we don't determine that's what we need to do and so we we need to be here today with a with a a heart of humility and say God I want what you want me to be I don't want to do this because brother John's saying this but I really want to be your wife I really want to to to sit with you I want to I want to have that honeymoon with you I want to be with you because most of the church world isn't even thinking about they're not thinking about the rest they're not thinking about coming to the Statue of a perfect man or being in His image or being just like him they're not interested in that for some reason they're just looking to get by God is not going to grab a b a bride who's just getting by amen so you know it's our attitude that that needs to be sure it's important as most unconverted people are they have to find something that they think uh they're another person is worthy of before they're going to actually respect them that's how they that's how we're brought up you know well they were nice to me I'm going to be nice to them they respected me I respect to them they did this for me I'm going to do that for them you scratch my back I'll scratch your back that type of thing right amen but to the converted Soul you scratch some's back when they don't scratch yours you respect them when they don't respect you amen because you have a different Spirit about you amen acts 10 says that Peter opened his mouth and said of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of persons that's right but in every nation he that fearth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him so notice no matter how how much a sinner is a sinner if you can just like say that statement No matter how bad we think somebody is all they need to do is turn towards God and God will accept them you know God does not look at people the way we look at people the Bible also teaches us to respect and honor others before we honor ourselves and in fact to even honor them more than we honor ourselves Philippians says let nothing be done through Strife let nothing be done through vain Glory but in a loneliness of our mind let each of us esteem the other person better than ourselves now you you just that that scripture does not apply to those that are better than you you understand this applies to everybody so that means you've got to hunt for the person you think is lower than you and esteem them amen look not every man on his own things take a minute for for you to look on the things of others so much we come to church and we want want want want how about come to church and help help help help because that's what it's really about that's what God's about he come here to help us amen imagine if we're all helping one another how happy we'd be amen coming to church CH and you want want want I don't know think about this there's only so much money to go around you can't help everybody right so everybody could come in and say you know I want 500 bucks today but you're going to run out you know after about a half a person but imagine everybody come in and said I want to give you understand how how this is how it works you can't outgive God you can't outr God but you can certainly fall into this self-righteous I I got everything figured out I know where everybody's at I know everybody's faults and flaws and problems and you know I'm the you know I'm not gonna carnal amen so carnal but Paul said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus so Jesus himself esteemed others better than himself amen he looked on the things of others and and and the thing is why would we leave here thinking to be any different because because we don't really come we're not really catching the message that God has called us to be like him am not just to to kind of know what this religion is but to have a relationship that imagine imagine you married somebody that they hated everything that you liked you you couldn't agree on what kind of car brand to get what kind of food to eat what kind of where to live I mean nothing just total agree disagreement now I'm going ask you a question would you want to be with that person would you want to choose that person God does not want to choose me because you know he thinks I'm you know different than him and special and you know I'm attracted to him no he wants to be with a spirit that he feels comfortable with amen as Spirit you know there are spirits that grieve the Lord amen he just feels uncomfortable with it so we're we're here today because we want to grow and be like Christ we want to be more respectful people we we want to have uh admiration for everybody not just certain ones in the church and then the others are real bad no we don't think like that amen because why don't we think like that because we have the mind of Christ amen and I'd rather have that mind than any mind last week we talked about David's Mighty Men had great admiration for their leader David they put their lives in danger just to get them a drink of water and yet at the same time um David David had the same admiration for his men and poured that water out and we can see here that this this this the set of scriptures that we read showed that there was no respect to persons David didn't put himself above his men right he didn't he felt Unworthy of his men that served him and we need to feel Unworthy of those that are underneath us yes come on the more we can get into this word you know the faster we can get it done unless you want have a part three you know Jesus said the greatest one that would be among us ought to be the ones that are serving the least the mindset serve serve right amen instead of exercising Authority he said exercise respect amen appreciation admiration high regard start exercising that I don't feel like it I'm not in the mood well you know get on your knees get the Holy Ghost get a hold of God get something in you that does you know God doesn't have to to try to respect am he doesn't have to force himself or get in a good mood or you know wake up on the right side of the bed he is what he is he said I am what I am and this is what he is amen we come here to find out where we're at in this honestly are we like him we left off in 1 Corinthians 12:24 if you want to turn there 1 Corinthians 12:24 for our comely Parts have no need have no need but God have tempered the body together and give more abundant honor to the part which lacked right so when you look at your your your spouse you look at your children or you look at your parents or you look at your brother and sister or you look at your pastor or Pastor you look at your congregation and if you see them that are lacking it is your job to help them and the most in other words we should all be Busy Bodies helping one another not busy body getting in one another's business but busy helping those that would be least or lacking God is wanting more admiration more abundant honor given to the parts of the body that are needful honor well well they're not even doing their job admiration well they're not even act like they give it you don't you I'm not saying you get there and you put them on and you walk around for you know 10 days with horn saying this person is great this person is great but take a few minutes and honor them that's what the Holy Ghost would do that's what the word tells us to do well you know my feelings just don't feel like doing it you know if I'm not going to do it from my heart wonderful Get Your Heart Right amen that's great I love that I would you know I would God loves a cheerful Giver the thing is do you want to become the word or do you want to become some um uh fake right to me the denominations you I'm not talking about the people now but we got to get people to Christ to a relationship to a change nature verse 25 that they should be that there should be no schism in the body if I hear of one's gism I've got scripture to deal with it and to deal with it until it's out but that the members should have the same care one for another as soon as as soon as someone begins to care less about somebody you know what happens that opens the door for Schism now what that word really means it means uh no Schism means no splits in the church no gaps no divisions no tears or rents in the body none and other words you would not want me or anybody to come and take part one of your organs out of your body it needs to stay there and so whatever we think about somebody and we want to just kind of rip them out of our Circle brother B says draw a bigger Circle bring them in because this is the nature of Amen we're here because I want to be like Jesus I truly truly want to be like Jesus and whether one body suffers all the members suffer with it because there's that care or one member be honored then all the members Rejoice with it amen this is what is practiced by believers who are filled with the Holy Ghost because it's the nature of God now unbelievers don't practice this right make Believers practice it occasionally but usually what they got in mind is some Advantage are you with me but real Believers will practice this continually because they just love one another there's a spirit inside of them that just loves they have the spirit of God in them and it's just automatically they respect they have admiration they they're they're a thousand miles away from a respect to persons because God is and you know people want to claim I I'm a Christian I love God I want to be like God but they they look at this and they say I don't want to spend any time thinking about this right let's get on to something else okay you don't don't this a dead horse I mean it's like there ought to be a love inside of us for God that we want to be like him to be able to go through the fire and truly love somebody anybody can say yeah I love God and I got God but who who can love him enough to actually live it I mean don't you want that I want that I want to be so much in me that I could actually he said come by me go tried in the fire that's what I'm wanting I want about about tried in the fire and come out respect and admiration is of god even though God is the almighty one the one that inhabits eternity he humbled himself and still does today he's humbling himself today to serve us amen do you know that he is here to serve us he still condescending to Men of low estate his life has proved over and over he has respect and admiration and there's no respected person think about this he came to you didn't he that sums it up right there I wasn't worthy of him I'm I'm more Unworthy of him today than I was then because I failed him just like David and his men they had respect admiration for one another you know they literally served one another David's men served him and then David served as men Galatians 5:13 Galatians 5:13 for Brethren you and I have been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the Flesh in other words use your Liberty by love to serve one another so think about that we live in America we can do what we want act like we want treat anybody like we want you got Liberty God's given you Liberty we're not under the law but some of us act like God hasn't written his law in our hearts right we take this Liberty and we use it for our fles I don't have to do this I don't have to I don't have to listen to you I don't have to do this I don't I don't got no headship using your Liberty for but he said use your Liberty to serve one another hey you're on my heart I was in prayer you came on my heart I just want to know if there's a special need I'm going to be praying for if not I'm just going to pray for you in general when's the last time you met God and God did that we shouldn't have to oh yeah call somebody and tell them you got a need let God speak it to you yes get that close to God Amen do you know Lucifer had been called to Liberty am he had Liberty but he used it for himself I don't want to have Liberty and use it for myself brother B said power without character is satanic and to me Liberty is a power that God has given us he I've given you this power now serve one another amen we shouldn't use it as an opportunity to appease our flesh but to serve one another honor one another respect one another admire one another esteem the other better than yourself verse 14 for all the law is fulfilled not in one word even this one word thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself we're so stuck on you know you know what before we ever got to church we're thinking about what we're going to do today amen what our plan is I'm going to do this I'm going to do that you can't hardly call somebody and say can you stop what you're doing just get on your knees and pray with me right now one word thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor because you would want somebody praying for you if you needed help God gave respect to the whole world when he died for the whole world he showed his respect and love to the whole world when he died he gave everybody a chance I think that's beautiful I think that's what he wants us to be amen we should give one another a chance every day every day never give up but what happens when you get into the flesh verse 15 but if you bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed of one another did you ever get in such a fight that you just kind of felt like [Music] nothing I mean yeah you're mad you're angry but you there was just nothing left over there was no care there was no love there was no respect there was nothing you just you're consumed I don't want you you're not my friend anymore how many times has some brother or some sister bothered you and you just kind of Drew a circle left them out of your circle some family member some neighbor some coworker and all the reason is it's not because they're how bad they are because you're missing the love right amen that's the only reason amen it you it's it's see you feel Justified when you put the blame on them amen but God would never put anything on you that you could bear he will always provide a way of escape and to me that way of Escape is be so full of God you walk in the in the spirit you not fulfill the lust of the flesh amen right right this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh when we're truly walking in the Holy Ghost the ghost inside of you you will respect and express it but when you're walking and you are not respecting there is an evil ghost in you I'm say it there is an evil ghost in you has nobody put chains on you and made you say and act the way that you do or did there's a different ghost anointing you that's right the goal that should be in you is literally esteeming that person give him a soft answer it'll turn away the Wrath to start putting the word into practice into human flesh manifest it again amen that in our longing what is what are we looking for we're going to make peacocks here we're going to become perfect peacocks we're going to dress in search a way where people think we're a Christian but really we don't got the goods a form of godliness God help us to just what if this is a real simple message it's just called respect and have admiration for one another that's to me that seems like a simple thing to do and and not only does it seem simple to do it seems so minute to us that it doesn't seem to be that big thing that we should have to put so much attention to it but in reality it is the thing that has caused all of our problems S I don't care what what problem your is you're talking about that is what happens well brother John I I got car problems I got financial problems I got I am telling you most everything is because we lost respect somewhere and did not take care of things you know they used to say if uh you go to buy a house and they want to know how you keep the house they they they say look in their car am I saying that right look in their car and see how they kept their car and you're going to know how they kept their house is that a true statement you've heard of that in other words a person is a person who they are they they don't they don't just well over here I have disrespect but over here I have respect it don't work like that you you how you are is how you are that's right and that's why this is such an important message this morning that we we we we take upon ourselves a determination to begin to build respect in our own lives you you can't respect somebody if you don't respect yourself if you don't respect yourself enough to say I'm going to respect another person and you're going to find you're going to let Satan get in that crevice and show you some fault about somebody and give you a reason not to respect them at that moment what you're really doing is indicating that you don't have enough respect to stop The Devil Inside you that's the truth you've got to learn to respect yourself first amen respect one another in the fear of the Lord be subject one to another in the fear of the Lord Ephesians chapter 6 verse one how many can say I love this message this morning amen there's something for all of us here we're going to get into it here Ephesians 61 children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor your father and your mother which is the first commandment with promise now that it may be well with you and that you may live a little longer in life than you would normally be living what what what a statement right there what a statement amen so when you obey what you're really doing is respecting yes you're honoring you're looking at your your father and your mother with admiration now this is really hard to do for a child because a child always looks at their parent in such a way that when they're told to do something that they're the bad guy right that that's it's it's the truth I mean at work the boss is the bad guy the pastor He's the bad guy the parents they're the bad guys you know who the good guys are the good guys are my friends you know hey Mom hey Dad you know they get to do it at their house why can't we but look at we're hearing the word of God we are not hearing an maybe an idea of a way to live we're hearing from God Almighty that's telling us to to honor our father and our mother and you do that by simply obeying don't question them do not question the decision that they made as if they're wrong because your feelings want it different amen the very fact that you would step into that arena is you've left respect and I'll just say this as parents parents you need to teach your children how to respect and I'm going to tell you how you do that you learn to respect them you show them how to respect you can't treat them like dirt and expect them to respect you it don't work like that verse four and ye fathers provoke not your children to getting upset to getting bad to angry and bothered to wrath a father has the capability of getting under the children's skin amen they've got to be careful how they handle situations they can't just say hey I told you to shut up you don't shut up I'm GNA throw you over there wow what did you just teach them what did you just teach them you taught them not to respect you so this is a real serious situation fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture in the admonition of the Lord so if you yell at them and you get angry and your your whole spirit is throwing them against the wall do you really think that's the nurture and admonition of the Lord no that's you being the boss of the home instead of God being the boss of the home look it is my desire that God is the head of this church but he will never be the head of this church unless I yield to him to be the head of the church same in your homes as much as you want God in your home he's not going to be the head of your home until you bring yourself under subjection to the word of God and then you allow him to be the head of your home and when he becomes the head of your home he can change the character of your family I believe that David and his men had this same relationship not provoking one another but nurturing them in the admonition because David he taught his unruly men how to serve God did you know that how to put God first he took a people who didn't want spent time with him and said he's the way he's going to be our refuge he's going to be our provider we read the Psalms we know David's testimony of God but he actually took time and parents we need to take time to get our children and really teach them and bring them up in the ammunition and we need to love God today in our home how is the last time you said that to your children you can't expect Church to do that you can't expect the 30 minute Bible study to do that it's a life that's lived in front of them you do it every time there's a problem they need to see Jesus Christ I love you Lord written all over your forehead yes how you handle things with your every situation well brother John you're like asking too much whoa whoa whoa whoa whoaa look do you want God in your life in your home or do you just want to have this distant relationship that you just want them for when you need them you want to be in that category of a thief and a robber I I really when I look at my children I already want them to become like Christ even when they're out of the Arc of safety right and they've already made that decision you know I just I don't feel like you know giving my all there all the more my heart wants them not just do some works and no but to really have a love for God Amen and so I'll say this to you that have children that are under 18 you're not going to have them forever you've only got a certain time to really bring them up in the admonition of the Lord don't wait till they're Hardy molded into some nature monstrous nature that you're not happy with take more time today to spend with them and I'll say it like this it's Pro you need to spend more time with than what you think it you're we're out of balance we think this is because I don't got time look they need you they don't got five sets of parents to choose from they need you bring them up in the nurture and the ammonition of the Lord don't provoke them just because you're their Authority you listen to me I'm going to teach you to listen to me accept their wrong accept their weakness learn how to help their condition their heart get into them well brother John I don't know what to do I just I don't know what to do well how about this let's start this how about if we get under our knees shut the door go pray and ask God can we do that first amen how do you expect God to help you with anything if you don't humble yourself before God well I don't got time for that I just want them to listen to I'm going to put the fear of God in them you know you're going to to put the fear of you in them you're going to teach them to manipulate and fear others to get what they want our goal should be to train them to teach them to nurture them to show them that God see son see daughter God is first in my life I put him there and this is what you need to learn to do too you're coming to the age you're going to be making decisions on your own and I'm just going to say like Paul said you follow me as I follow Christ you put God first in your life and God will bless you from there you just can't say you shouldn't do that you know this and you know better and you're not teaching them to respect you're not respecting them you know the children are God's inheritage they're not ours they belong to him God has made you a steward over them yes one day we'll answer don't just tell them they're wrong show how to help them couple of scriptures 1 Timothy 5:17 let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor oh boy double double I got to give twice as much especially they who labor in the word and Doctrine whoa chapter 6 verse one let as many servants as are under the Yoke Count Their Own Master worthy of all honor that's right that the name of God and his Doctrine be not blasphemed now most people who work for somebody have a problem with them that's just all there is to it but see you are a son and daughter of God and it don't matter how bad they are God has called you to represent him under that person and so you're supposed to honor all honor worthy of all honor all right 1 Peter chapter 2 turn with me there 1 Peter chapter 2:1 17 we're going to put it up real important scripture here honor all men right this is the good one honor everybody honor all men love the Brotherhood fear God and honor the king honor means to prize that is to value or fix a value upon to Reverend you ever have somebody talk to you as if they had no they looked at you with no value and in 1 Peter 2 17 it says that you know we need to Value everybody all men am that means we have a hard job like with our children we have a hard job with oursel and it is find Value and other people find Value amen it shouldn't be hard one Souls Jesus said one Soul you could gain the whole world lose your soul every human being has a soul and God values that Soul at least one world right just according to the scriptures so you should better fix a value on that person because there's a soul inside of them you should have enough love of God in your heart that you could sit there being crucified by them and say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing that's right now you can't do that but God in you can do that he's the same yesterday today and forever and I'm here to testify God is alive amen God is alive so let's get to the place where we can love one another amen Jesus loved and honored Judas Jesus honored Judas to be The Treasure of his own church amen honored Judas with a power to remove the powers of the enemy out of other people he honored Judas with scriptural teachings sat in church as he taught his other dis disciples Judas was honored to be one of the 12 disciples he chose them Jesus loved and he honored Jesus Judas but what is Judas always remembered for betrayal but we need to fix our eyes on who the character of God really is Right amen and how can we think that we're not going to be like Jesus I I just H you know brother Den I happen to be stupid enough dumb enough to believe that I could be like Jesus amen I I because I don't got the smarts to figure out how to do it I just don't I am pretty dumb but I just have this belief that Christ in me can come out of me Christ in me can come out of me that I could I could on he prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies I should be able to love my even my worst enemy the one that's going to portray me at the very end amen we need to learn to honor and have admiration for every human being amen and that's what the Holy Ghost does inside of believers they practice that it's a practice don't wait till you think you can okay I'm good enough I'm gonna do it no do it try it fall get up do it again do it again try try get and get to a place where you can look back two weeks and say you know what I'm here today because I started trying two weeks ago the problem is we're just waiting for some feeling to happen what needs to happen is a faith inside of us that we believe the word that's being preached to us that it's not the word of a man but it's a word of God and it's finding a hiding place inside of us Verse 18 servants be subject to your own masters with all fear not only to the good and the gentle to the good guys but also to the forward they got a mouth on them you ever work for somebody who you thought they were not worthy to be reverenced with all fear oh yeah fact you talked about that person to somebody because you didn't know how to handle it and I'm telling the word's telling you how to handle it it's not your job justy them out it's your job to demonstrate Christ to them under that atmosphere you don't have to wait till they straighten up and respect you and honor you and look at you and say you're the greatest thing send sliced bread before you decide to respect them anybody can do that publicans they can do that shake hands with those that agree with them how about being punched in the face would you turn the cheek you know what I'm saying respect and admire not just the good and the gentle but those that got a mouth on them you ever you know I've been so accused because I respect people I've been accused because people think I don't know who they are you let them use you you're blind you're just so naive what they do to Jesus he could have prophesied every bad thing they did when he was blindfolded God is calling us to be like him I I just had this desire I want to be like Jesus and I'm so glad that there's nothing that's standing in the way from that happening you just got to get away from well brother John they're not treating me well it just does something gets under my skin you know what needs to happen under your skin is get little the Holy Ghost into that skin because that will take care of the other thing that's under your skin amen verse 19 for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience towards God his conscience is for God towards God he endures grief suffering wrongfully and we I hope you understand what this scripture means that means you just been accused of stealing $1,000 out of the church and they came to you and they just started accusing you you stole $1,000 and you really didn't you didn't know $1,000 were there but you're being accused of it are you going to be the type of person that walks out I'm never going to step front of that church again I can't believe they accus me or are you going to endure that grief suffering wrongful in other words you're trusting that God is going to really prove this out you know what that takes it takes love because love is patient it's longsuffering it's not about proving anything it's about living the light that everybody can see we written Epistles read of all men this man is living the word this man is not this man this woman is demonstrating the power CHR this man is demonstrating the power of the flesh that's it it's not about tricking or hiding it's about being real and you know we ain't got much time to get ready we must just take advantage of this time verse 24 what glory is it if when you're buffeted for your faults and you take it patiently yeah you're right but and anybody can do that right yeah you're right I did take the last cookie and I should asked first but if when you're accused of taking the last cookie and you didn't but if when you do well and you are suffering as if you didn't and you take it patiently this is what is acceptable with God Amen and I want to be accepted of God honor amen it's completely in order to respect those that don't respect you it's completely admirable to go ahead and be accused by somebody knowing you're right and don't treat them bad I'm telling you you know what this is a gospel and if this hurts let it hurt because this is the word of God the problem is we don't have any desire we're not even thinking about being this amen and we should have this yearning every day God shine Through Me Shine through me let me be a light to the world Amen how how else are we going to be a a lighthouse what we need to be shining is the life manif the word manifested in the flesh not just quoting the scriptures and we need to be a light to oursel us in God in that prayer room and we need to be a light to our family and our homes am and we need to come here and help the body of Christ amen and then we go out and bring others in verse 21 for look here's your calling for even here un two were you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps in other words Christ did not do anything wrong and he suffered for us he suffered wrongfully who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth he didn't have to give the last word before he walked out who when he was reviled he he reviled not again when he suffered he didn't threaten I'm going to tell you this is your last warning but he committed himself to God he's the one that judge righteously who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousness and by whose Stripes we've been healed for we were as sheep gone astray but now we return to unto the shepherd and the bishop of our souls we were sheep that just trying to justify every bad action that we do blame it on somebody else just wandering thinking that we're better and Jesus says you know what there's none good none you must just get that thing straight you need to return back to the bishop of your soul let God be the head of your soul in your patience possess you your souls that's right you got to let God in the nature of your of your life you if you don't have a desire for more of God don't worry you're not getting it brother B says well you know I don't believe in that I don't I I I'm not I I don't believe in that don't worry you're not be it unto you according to your faith now I'm just saying to you he is coming back for somebody that's in His image amen and we don't we we can't just wait here to a Rapture Day and say oh yeah this day said I've been faithful come to the church I'm going to be in his his image it don't work like that we have an opportunity every day to to to draw closer to him to to try how to crucify the flesh to deny ourselves and say God I really want to be like you I want to cry out to you and God sees that says that's what I'm looking for that's what I'm looking for somebody who fears and respects and honors my word amen that knows that's the kind of that's the kind of man I am and to him will I Look to Him will I give of my spirit he's not going to write his laws in your heart if you don't want them you got to want them all right how are we doing on time see we're um you know what we're in the exact same spot we were last service last Sunday oh can we at least do one more oh this is this is a long one just try to go through these quick here First Peter chapter 3 again first Peter is such a good one if you really really want to know about the nature of God Amen 1 Peter chapter 3 vers verse one I really want to get to this one because you know I want to talk to you know the wies on this you know what I'm saying likewise ye wives be subject to your own husband that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives now this is your behavior your behavior your behavior needs to be according to the gospel that when your husband who is not really be fully engaged with God sees the way that you handle yourself according to the word that they become pricked in their heart whoa there's a gospel being lived in front of me while they behold your chased conversation your chased behavior that that that word conversation means Behavior innocent modest clean pure perfect coupled joined together with respect and admiration and fear when they see that you have this I could be wrong but I see the Bible is telling me to do this anybody can say nobody's going to tell you're not going to treat me like that what is your belief what is your belief it's not the gospel see it's not the gospel the gospel tells us what the true gospel is amen search the scriptures Amen in them you think you have eternal life but they are they that testify of the nature of God and we're reading it right here who's adorning let it not be after the outward adorning the plating the hair and the wearing of the gold or the putting on the Peril but let it be the hidden man of the heart in which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God a great price you ever think about that I mean you go to the store and you buy outfits and you buy things and you want to wear these and you want the best shoes and you got all those things that you want to have right to you you treasure what you have you ever wonder what God really Treasures what's a great price to him it's the spirit that's right that's why the prophet said I'd rather have the right Spirit yes amen because it's a great price the the right spirit will lead anything that's wrong back to where it needs to be it's not about proving who's right and wrong it's about having a right Spirit and the right spirit is it's it's a respectful Spirit a it's it's admirable when you got a right Spirit you you can't but nothing respect that for most times unless you're so over if unless the devil's really on you verse five for after this manner in Old Time the holy women also who trusted in God they adorned themselves being subject unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement in other words Trust God I would never tell my wife trust me anybody that knows me I don't say those words trust me you it trust God Amen he's the one that will never fail amen all right verse seven wives you can take a break now this is where you say Amen likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge well my my my wife's you know she's just you know kind of you know local dwell with them according to knowledge I don't care what knowledge know that we have about our wives I love what it speaks here give giving honor unto the wife yes so no matter what you think it doesn't say that certain wives get honor and some don't all wives get honored and it is the Perpetual responsibility of the husband to give the wife honor amen dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto them well they're not acting right that doesn't matter it doesn't matter they deserve to be honored right and and I'll tell you this we need to start treating our wives the way we want them to Live come on I got I should have got the whole church to say Amen to that one we need to treat our wives the way way we want them to be you know God treats you the way he wants you to be amen he says I forgive you you're clean you're washed you're pure he doesn't do that so you could just you know keep doing it giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel it's understandable they're not upward you're at but you still honor them as being heirs together of the grace of God that your own personal prayers be not hindered that's right yes in other words God's watching how you're treating your wife amen how you're honoring her amen you honor her and support her or do you just call her blah blah blah blank blank blank how can we expect God to hear our prayers for our children or anything if our prayers are being hindered all because of the way that we're treating our wives let's respect them weaker vessel let's respect them let's let's let's honor them let's have admiration for our wives amen John amen John amen John uh I'm going to start I don't I'm not an amen my own self but you know right now I need to because I just didn't hear any amens and I I that's the word of God all right finally be of one mind husband wife having compassion one for another love his Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing in a contr a blessing when somebody's being evil give them a blessing amen when they're reved give them a blessing knowing that you are there unto call that you should inherit a blessing and I'll say a blessing from God you be the first one to be mature knowing you're doing the right thing and God will bless you for that we are called to respect people who do not respect us that's a high calling but that's what we're called to so we need to learn to grow in respect for one another that when people we feel don't deserve it just respect them because there's a spirit that gets on us that doesn't want to respect them and that's because we got a spirit of Pride that's the only thing we think we're better than them like did God never made you better than anybody you're not better than anybody but when you humble yourself you realize you're not better than anybody then you can respect others when you're not being respected all right Jesus said to love our enemies to bless them that curse curse us and and and and to pray for them that displate F use us so he showed us him own self how to respect others that are not respecting Us by calling them their enemies and even the prophet said get to the place where you can love everyone even your enemies and I wonder who's even working on that I wonder wonder who's even working on that we think that's going to happen because well you know Sunday I'll come to church Wednesday I'll come and it's no it don't happen like that when you really want that God puts allows a test to come into your life and to see if you're really going to pass this real small test and you start to exercise you know I want to love them right now God you know this and you slip you fall you get back up you try it again and before you know it you got more character than you did last month amen that's how it happens verse 10 for he that will love life and see good days let him reframe his tongue from evil and let his lips and his lips that they speak no G zipple NADA never you want to know a good way to do that is don't think it have the mind of Christ the mind of Christ will have you honestly look for ways to respect them let him excute evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it for the eyes of the Lord over the righteous his ears are opened unto their prayers for the face of the Lord is against them that don't respect right that do evil when you don't respect somebody that's evil that means you have respect to persons they don't deserve it and who is he that will harm you if you actually be followers of them which are good let's stand together we've been called to this High Calling to be like Christ amen to respect others just like Christ does to give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar to know to owe no man anything everyone deserves to be loved to be respected to be loved so I just say today as we leave God's house let's dedicate ourselves to the word of God with the determination that I really am going to start to control my mouth control my my thoughts I'm not going to think I'm right all the time but what I'm going to do is I'm gonna humble myself and I'm just going to respect everybody everybody my my my children my mom my dad my brothers my sisters my co-workers I'm just going to respect you know you know even the you know just not getting into politics here but the Bible does say pray for those in the in the government right it doesn't say pray for those that you agree with in government that's right amen so he God just wants us to follow through amen just have yourself be Christ that's just respecting everybody we can do that we can do that let's sing that that song um be exalted be exalted I will give thanks to thee Oh Lord among the people I will sing praises to thee among the Nations for thy steadfast Love is Great is great to the heavens and thy faithfulness Thy Faithfulness to the CL be exalted oh God
