real peace that i have dear lord is in your amen can you say amen to that amen as the world is getting darker uh we're getting more frustrated and we're coming to realize that we have to look to the lord for all for all the peace for all the strength to to help us in in in our life situation definitely we're just 20 21 we're encountering things that we've never faced before we we've we may have thought well i'm glad that the civil war is over world war ii is over world war one's over all these wars are over i'm glad we didn't go through the great depression and probably many things we can look in history and say i'm glad that we're not going through that but i say that we're coming into yet the hardest time that our nation has ever faced and it uh it was very hard at the birth the birth when it came forth from our founding fathers but the the destruction and the death will be worse it'll be greater and we really need to be so much into christ it's the only peace that we have amen god bless you today it's good to see everyone that made it out our brother bruce and sister donna they they went uh about 15 minutes it took him 45 minutes and so they had to turn around and they're just watching we appreciate them trying god god be with you in your home may god bless you and for the marty sister kathleen it's so good to have our brother jason here back with us praise the lord turn with me if you would to the book of first peter chapter one for opening scripture i know you've been standing here for a little bit so we'll read these verses of scripture and ask god to bless them to our hearts amen first peter chapter one starting with verse number 13 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ as obedient children that's where we are not fashioning ourselves according to our formal desires and things and our own ignorance but as he which have called us has called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be holy for i am holy amen let's bow in prayer heavenly father lord as we come before you once more in prayer today lord we all have needs in our lives lord we all have desires we all the lord want lord the holy ghost we all want to please you i want to fulfill this scripture and be holy lord but we can't do this on our own lord we can't even understand what it means to be holy without you revealing it to us we pray today that the holy spirit would move amongst us not in the reasoning of our minds so much but in the in our hearts meet with us lord reveal this precious word to us and lord give us the grace to fulfill the desire in our heart to be more like you and if holiness is what we're lacking in holiness is what we're desiring lord if we're out of order we want to be in order i also pray lord that you would bless all the other needs that there would be in our lives lord father for we come to our heavenly father one who is able to meet needs that our natural father just cannot do lord you said in your word that you would do exceedingly above all that we would ask or even think for we serve almighty god today we humbly ask that you would give us faith to take this word that you give us lord today and apply it to our lives that we might manifest it lord in this late hour for as lord we know it's getting darker and darker the news is getting worse and worse but we've come this morning to hear the good news that we might be encouraged and strengthened and know that lord that you have provided a way for your your people that have chosen the straight neural path we commit ourselves to you today we commit ours our spirits our souls this service into your hands might you receive honor and glory in each one of our lives as we glorify you and receive your word today for we ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you you may be seated thank you for your long standing um last sunday we ministered on the call of becoming holy the call god has a call that goes out how is recognizing god calling you to become more holy amen amen amen i know in our men's meeting we were able there was a number of testimonies that even though this all has stemmed off of church order um so many of us god has been revealing to us that in order to have church order we have to have order in our lives amen it starts with our lives because this church is a culmination of what we are in our homes what we are in our lives and when our lives can become more pleasing than we can uh uh respect god's house more amen the bible says as he which have called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation meaning behavior for it is written be holy for i am holy now that's a a very tall order as it were and we cannot do that in ourselves but that's why god gives us the holy ghost and the realness of god's spirit lives in us then we can do all things through christ amen this morning we like to entitle this message responding to the call of becoming holy so the call was as it were last sunday and we want to respond to that call and for a subject bringing order to our lives and we got a lot of quotes that we're going to be uh speaking of here uh later in the service but last sunday our subject was entering into his holiness and becoming holy entering into his holiness we've heard you know going to church doesn't make you a christian if it did then going into a bar would make you a horse but there is something that transpires when you enter god's holiness as we recognize the holy spirit is dealing with us and we don't harden our heart we will become more holy amen now i'm not speaking more of a long-term effect it will happen in a long-term effect if your seed because every seed brings forth of its own kind but if you're not then the change that happens will be short-term it's limited but i want to say this that you cannot stand in the presence of holiness and it not be affecting you even in short term [Music] isaiah did not have a choice he didn't say i'm not used to this i'm not you know what i just i don't think i'm going to partake in this this holiness he was faced with on how unholy was and uh i think it's okay to come to church and to enter into a place with a faith and believing that god is so much in that place that it causes you to respect god more amen holiness can be all around you and you not even know it not even feel it not even sense it because it has to do with his holy presence meeting you in your heart and not your flesh not your mind not your reasoning not your senses but it's inside isaiah chapter 57 verse 15 says for thus saith the high and lofty one the one that inhabits eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit see where god's meeting you in your spirit in your spirit that's why you got a deep go deep inside when you come to church you got to enter in you got to prepare because god meets you in your spirit and it has to be a humble spirit it can't be a proud spirit it can't be an arrogant spirit it can't be an i know it all spirit it has to be a contrite humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble to revive the heart of the contrite ones that's where god's holiness dwells and god promised to meet you right there you don't got to be rich you don't got to know god for 10 years you just got to come with the right spirit to church and you will meet god's holiness notice it's not a holy person but a humble person because holiness will come holiness will come to you our nature is not to be holy our our nature is to be unholy but a humble spirit will allow the holy spirit in someone who has allowed their pride to be crushed contrite god's spirit will come in did not jesus say learned of me for i am meek and lowly learn of me god's nature is meek and lowly a humble person will become more holy when we humble ourselves and give the holy spirit liberty his holiness can have its way inside of us it will affect us it will affect our life but it must go through the channel of free more agency first it just has to we have to want it a lot in other words we all want it but we've got to want it a lot holiness has to do with his presence meeting inside of us now i've said it and i just want it to register and i know it's hard because revelation can only come from the lord not just around our bodies but inside of our hearts we need to invite him inside to take a boat inside the holiness has to come in here not our minds not our thoughts but inside our hearts it has to do with the desire john 14 verse 19 saint john 14 verse 19 yet oh a little while and the world seeth me no more the way this world is going it just going its head right to hell it's becoming more and more like hell the shows are becoming more and more like and now it sits down at such as fast pace yet a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me because i live you shall live also at that day there is a day that you shall know that i am in the father and you and me and i in you so in order to see god's holiness it's going to be inside of us there's a meeting place it's not out here in the learning curve it's not a school this is not a school building there's not a professor up here it's not somebody with degrees amen when we consider our bodies being the tabernacle of god the sanctuary of god remember the tabernacle was in three parts and god dwelt on the inside of the inside amen exodus chapter 25 verse 22 exodus chapter 25 verse 22 and there and there i will meet with thee it wasn't on the outside wasn't in the holy place it was in the most holy place and there i will meet with thee and i will commune with thee from above the mercy seat and from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony of all the things which i give thee in commandment unto the children of israel so god wants to reveal his holiness to us in our heart but if we say no not no thank you you know i'm going to just kind of do my own thing live my own life and you know just call the shots well then you know god isn't going to meet that there's not a chance of giving revelation there's only a chance of bringing more confusion to your mind and trying to figure out that there's another way to serve god and not have to go this way there is no other way i'm just i'm trying to express that if we really want to get a hold of the reality of order and holiness we we've got to invite god inside as we continually come in contact with god's holiness inside of us we will undoubtedly change we're going to walk away with his commandments just like when god met moses and he walked away with god's commandments and then moses told the people the the children of israel so did god in this age send a messenger amen with the word for the church in this age to make a rapture all the commandments of god and we need to receive them second corinthians chapter 3 verse 15. second corinthians chapter 3 verse 15 but even unto this day when moses is red the veil is upon their heart so this is what i'm saying you can have a veil right here in your heart and in your mind be intellectually thinking about what's being spoken and not even hear from god not even not even see god not even know god it's like sitting in watching some youtube video because it's here there's a veil here and this this veil is your desire you've got to open it up you got to say lord come inside you're in charge of that veil god will not come down and rip your heart open and say i'm coming in he's a gentleman he would never do that he didn't do it to lucifer he won't do it to you he'll do it to nobody on the day of judgment those that make were those that said lord come in and those that didn't make and say lord i didn't want anything to do with you and he says okay nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord notice your heart being turned towards the lord the veil shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty you give you give liberty right here in your heart the lord is in your heart you give liberty up here in your mind you just think about whatever you want to think about but we now look at what happens when you come into the presence of the lord but we all with open face be holding us in the glass the glory of the lord are changed amen are changed into the same image from glory to glory even by the spirit of the lord every time we come into the presence of the holy ghost the glory of god and we give god liberty we are promised the word promises that we will be changed we've all experienced how hard it is trying to live the word outside of the holy ghost it's a burden too heavy to carry you try and you get discouraged and you can't do it and the devil knocks you down and he says see you're not a christian and it goes on and on and on and on and the thing is we just want to seek the holy ghost because god has power god has power to make these bones live we don't have to try to do it we just need to seek the holy ghost let him in that's what holy get it ghost it's holy already it doesn't try to get holy there's a song course we sing often when i look into god's holiness when i when i gaze into his loveliness when all things that surround me become shadows in the light of you when i found the joy of reaching your heart when my will becomes enthralled in your love now for some reason it's sung it's in the words is when my will becomes enthroned in your love and i'll tell you i don't want my will thrown in god because it will corrupt god's love anything anything of my will it must die to god's will we may want to change that when my will becomes enthralled in your love now that word enthralled means i am captivated by and submitted to god's love and when our our will becomes uh captivated by god's love and submitted to god's love when all things that surround me becomes shadows in the light of you then we can worship god properly in spirit and in truth what kind of son would i be if only time i want to reach god's heart is if i want something i need something i mean i'm okay with that but it's time to grow up it's time to let her husband be our husband of our life it's time to let him call the shots in her life now our carnal nature can look at this church order as legalistic or this is the law of this church it's do's and don'ts of the church the carnal nature will look at this as it's not that necessary but the nature of the holy spirit simply doesn't want things out of order and we just need to come to grips with the realization that this isn't church order it's god's order in the church just like it's not the acts of the apostles it's the acts of the holy ghost in the apostles in 1963 it was a very special year for brother branham's ministry he preached mighty messages he preached the message absolute three times he preached god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself the same he preached the breached he preached the seven seals and then he preached god hiding himself in simplicity again showing that we don't want to miss god we may think this is not a big thing we want to get onto things that make us feel good things that you know we feel like get us ready for the rapture he preached standing in the gap the flashing red lights of his coming the third exodus humble they sell paul a prisoner of jesus christ he preached he cares do you care he preached that great message christ the mystery of god revealed he preached how can i overcome he preached perfect faith the token which he said was the highlight of his ministry he preached desperation the souls that are in prison he preached three kinds of believers he preached that message why little bethlehem these were mighty messages and then he preached church order and then he preached church order the church of god's prophet was out of order the very next message that he preached after church order was there's a man that could turn on the light and he turned on the light of church order brother brahman said in that message church order he said it he's speaking of his church he said it is one of the most spiritual places was his church he'd been to a lot of churches a lot of places but his church was one of the most spiritual places yet it was out of order think about what i'm saying order can have nothing to do with how spiritual it is i'm just trying to get us to open our eyes brother branham says it's been a long time a long prayer of mine and i and a desire sense a boy to see the church put in order and kept in order now when we dedicated the church i told you a little later now this is two years now before he passes away a little later that i had something to talk to you about how to set this thing in order the way that it should be run and you started off after leaving here we had ministers and so forth so there was people that came and go but now brother neville being just young among us come among us i thought it'd be better for brother neville to get better established in the faith before i presented such things as i'm about to do now but now after i find out that he is getting well established in the faith and he understands what doctrine is and has played the part of a faithful witness to christ and holding for what we believe to be the truth i think it's the hour and now would be a good time to approach him and among you elders and things here in the church that you would take these orders and remember them that the best of my knowledge before god and i'm looking to you to carry these things out the way that i'm saying them because somebody's got to be the head around here we just want to carry out what was spoken amen this church order wasn't preached the first year of his ministry and you really didn't know everything didn't know what he was talking about and you know that's not how he felt later in his ministry i just want to squash out any thoughts that we may have of the importance of having church order this is not carnal church order is not legalistic it may be to a carnal mind but it is not to a spiritual mind it is the order of god amen and we need to keep it that way two years before god took him off the scene the holy spirit led him to make the church more holy is what he was doing not more spiritual more holy so god taught the church his order it wasn't brother branham teaching his order it was god teaching the church his order and brother branson said that she says you go back to this tape and play it before service if somebody isn't listening now you certainly don't want me to be playing parts of the tape here before service because you know how long our services can be so we want to take this thing seriously god is teaching us order here and this order that he's teaching us here if we respond to the call it will change us god is in the business of changing us now our carnal nature doesn't want to suffer enough to change now that's the battle brother branham taught us that we have to lay in the presence of the s-o-n and get ripened is that what he said that's why our hearts invite his presence in here we have to let this this heart lay in the presence not our mind not our reasoning i mean if we're completely out of it yes come let us reason together got to get our attention but if we've accepted the word that you open your heart and you lay there in the presence and god will reveal his word to you any natural seed cannot be ripened by just a picture of a son and we're showing me i believe it was yesterday this picture of the sun so beautiful but it was just a picture the sun has light and heat that germinates the seed and a picture doesn't give that and coming into a church sitting in a natural a natural church naturally listening to the word is not going to germinate a spiritual seed warmth comes from your heart he said i'll meet you there you've got to be in love with jesus you've got to say lord i'm interested in what's being spoken i hear the call i'm responding to the call let let the light of your word be revealed to me i'll tell you the seed inside will begin to change you change your life but just come to church and listening you'll be here for years and never change and yet in the presence of god because you've got to get the presence here you've got to get real with god you got to be willing to be broken you got to be willing to cry out you got to be willing to open up take the veil off and say lord jesus come into me come in lord come in amen jesus said my words are spirit and their life but if they're up here they're here i'm telling you it's just a dead letter it won't change a thing in your home it won't change a thing in your life it won't change a thing in your relationship it won't change a thing in your prayer walk it won't change a thing but when that word becomes living it becomes real to you you know you may not feel it right this minute i'm okay with that but i'm not okay with an attitude that says lord i guess it's just not for me because i don't feel it you to step in and say god i want this i want this lord something inside of every one of you sitting here this morning but something is there's bearing witness that this word is the truth if it's not you wouldn't be here so we've already crossed the line we've already called out this is god now open your heart to it be changed be changed in other words let the scriptures ring loud harden not your heart let your heart be hardened because god can't god can't do that he can't work through that we've got to let the word inside it'll change it'll change you we've got to meet god inside our our hearts not our heads but our hearts that's how we respond to the call of god's holiness truly holy true holiness is not putting on a dress for women it's not cutting hair in men because there's a lot of men out there that have short hair and i don't think they know what the word holy means and i believe that there's women out there that have a dress on that don't know how to act holiness if we meet god inside our hearts he will lead us to become holy he will lead us to put a dress on he will lead us our brothers to to cut their hair because that's the job of the holy ghost god's not up in heaven with a bunch of do's and don'ts oh yeah here's someone coming to me oh yeah make sure i'm going to lead them to cut their hair here's a there's a woman i'm going to lead her to put a dress on it's not do's and don'ts god is leading his children to become holy god is holy he wants us to become holy not do's and don'ts not rules not regulations but to become holy in other words it's the heart and desire of god for each one of us to be like he is and if we don't start saying amen more i'm going to start saying amen to my preaching you don't want that do you first peter chapter 3 verse 1 likewise he wives be subject to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives isn't that beautiful in other words a woman doesn't need to preach the gospel with her lips because that word conversation means behavior it means behavior it's the same word that's used in first timothy chapter 3 verse 15 but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou altest behave thyself in the church of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and the ground of the truth behavior it means more than just how you act in church it's more than just what you speak but it's how you behave in every situation how you handle every situation holiness has an effect now i don't stand here before you as a holy person i stand before you here as one of you wherever you put you just put me a little bit underneath you i don't care who you are where you think you stand just put me a little bit underneath you but i'm still one of you i'm just reading the word get back to first peter chapter three verse one you wives be subject to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the lord be won by the conversation of the wise while they behold your chaste conversation now notice it's coupled with fear i could be wrong any time that we're speaking but that's good step away from that because it's clearly identified it's not the right spirit while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear who's adorning let it not be the outward adorning of the plating of the hair the wearing of gold or the putting on of apparel in other words that's not what holiness is but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god a great price can you imagine that we all have things in our life that we consider valuable and things not so valuable god considers a woman with a meek and quiet spirit to be a valuable to him amen wow if i was a woman i know what i'd go for come on i believe as a man i can have that same spirit i'm going to talk about a feminist spirit but moses was a meek man i believe that god was pleased with that amen chose him even jesus himself is meek amen i want to be meek brother i want to be more meek and i know his holy spirit in me will teach me to act the right way and you know what it'll do the same thing in you because he's the same yesterday today and forever and i'll say it like this i do not want to be a professor of god without the power to be meek and humble i want the power to live it amen for after this manner after this manner of a right spirit a meek spirit a quiet spirit in the old time the holy women also who trusted god adorning themselves being subject to their own husbands i want to say this when you have the right spirit you'll dress right you don't put dress before the right spirit but you can have all these things on the outside and think that is god on the inside and think it's it's god but god and the inside will work on the outside that's the song we sing amen even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters you are in this church as long as you do not want you do well and that you're not afraid with any amazement don't be afraid in other words trust god trust god trust god why trust god i don't trust my husband that's not trusting god trust god that is with you and your husband well he just doesn't know as much as me so and do you think and do you think i'm up here because i know more than you i tell my men at work i tell my son i don't know as much as you know it's not about what you know it's about who you trust it's about your relationship with christ it's not your ability to get somewhere it's your it's your relationship with christ likewise your husbands dwell with your wives according to knowledge giving honor unto your wives well i'll give her honor when i feel she deserves it that is not what the scripture says if it wasn't for the mercies of god today none of us would be here you know one thing that we lack in this age is we lack thankfulness we have the hardest time come on up here come on up here now look at look at this brothers isn't this time match perfect doesn't it seriously isn't it perfect and don't you think this time match is good seriously did you know when i walked in the door today that i had that tie on me i put that on this morning and when he walked in he had this tie on and he said this is your tie i said i think it much better on me and this mine would match better on you let's switch we need to honor one another be more thankful for one another especially our wives well i'm afraid she'll get a big head bro john it ain't your job to pop it it ain't your job to keep it small it's your job to honor let god deal with that give honor unto your wife as unto the weaker vessel as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered finally be all one mind having compassion one for another love is brother and be pitiful be courteous courteous not rendering evil for evil we can identify the evil somebody does to us but for some reason we have a hard time covering we want to set things straight the only thing you're setting straight is the nature that you're being led by amen not rendering evil free or railing for railing but contour-wise contour-wise wise however you say that brother marty where are you blessing give a blessing for evil give a blessing when somebody rails on you knowing that ye are there unto cold you know that's why a lot of people have a hard time living the life they haven't received the call yet they haven't recognized the call yet same thing with holiness when you recognize you've been called to holiness you'll get serious with it when you realize there is no other out the christian way is harder you have to bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them that despitefully use you that's the call there and too are you called that you should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from speaking things that are not holy and his lips that they speak no guile let him excu evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open to their prayers but the face of the lord is against them that do evil so we see right here in the scriptures real plain the kind of life that god is looking for us to have now what we're hearing about is what we need to do when we leave here this whole thing that we read if you want to be you want to remind yourself if if you're interested in this you don't know if you go back and read it go back and read it when you get home look at it tonight read it together as a as a family as a husband as a wife you you want your prayers not hindered you you you you want the eyes to be the eyes of the lord would be on you well this is what to do you you you want god's eyes to be on you you've got to cover somebody else's evil you just got to think about this in life god every person on the planet is sinning and god's holding up back his blood why is it because his people and his bride are a little bit more righteous than the others no because there's a blood there there's the blood the life of the holy spirit taking this sin away that's what puts us in harmony with god that's why it's important the holy ghost living inside of us amen brother brandon said in the message dedication of the building and he's dedicating the building to the lord he says there was aaron's rod butted something that was dead an old dry stick off the desert in in the holiest of holies took new life and bloom blooms and sprouted out and brought leaves how it was laying in the presence of the holiest of holies so we want new life let it let it be more than just church coming here just your your oh got to get there half hour early i noticed none of you slept i know it takes time to change habits but look we'll keep pressing on but it's more than just getting to church more than just getting into this place is getting to the holiest of holies it's letting the holy spirit inside and you entering into that that's where life comes forth that's where a dried old life with hardly nothing going on no victory no joy that's where life will come forth he says you can take a dead sinner rotten carnal in his mind and in his thinking a criticizer of the power of god and bring him into the presence of the holy ghost and there will be something happen to him amen sure entering into the uh lonely place with god he dwells moses said in the next chapter in the thickness of darkness there's where god dwells that's where life stays is in the midst of the rotten corruption where does it life stay in the seed after it's rotten when it dies to itself it brings forth new life the message identification of christ in all ages brother bratton says and when moses was called it took 40 years of schooling then 40 years to get it out of him again well brother john i've been serving the lord now for this long and i still got problems okay let me ask you a question how long were you serving the devil how long were you compromising you know we want more and more and more we want things to happen i understand my my advice get more serious with god today get more serious with god today and i i say i say this encourage you you were not living in the home of the greatest corruption in the planet like moses was it was so filthy religious has so many gods everything that was said was so away from the realness of god you weren't that bad of shape have faith in god all things are possible to him believeth i'm just saying don't get negative with god if it hasn't happened yet believe believe it can happen that's where god dwells that's where the life stays amen when a man is in the presence of god then he knows something he said he knows something when he's in the presence of god so before you think you know something do me a favor labor to enter in his presence get in his presence and you want to know something no matter what you know what everybody will witness is a spirit of meekness contriteness because that's where god said he would dwell not he can't learn he says not he can't learn in books you can't learn god by books education you you say he's a ddd a phd for the man says that just takes him that much farther from god to me you don't know god by education you know god by faith faith in other words you hear the word of god being preached and you say i believe that's how you know god all right we're finally ready to start going through some of these things we'll just we'll just stop sooner if we have to you know how i am with the foundations the reason i believe in foundation so much it just makes it so much easier to receive the word and brother brandon has some strong words here in the message serpent see brother brandon says a woman supposed to be a woman and she's supposed to dress like a woman when god made a man he made him one thing and he made a woman something else and when god dresses a man he dressed him one way and the woman something else now the bible says it's abomination for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man that's scripture i think about i don't know if it's a woman or a man that's in our a public affairs office brother mike you would probably know but it sounds to me like it's someone that doesn't know who they are i want to ask brother mark did you ever battle if you were a woman but why some people have a hard time it's real you talk to some people i've seen guys talk like women act like it i just feel uncomfortable around them it's the perversion of satan the confusion in somebody's mind i'm so glad god sent a prophet to straighten me out to not be confused by someone who says i know that god called me to be something different he just made a mistake god didn't make a mistake but that's what people do when they try to make things different i'm going to destroy and kill this baby because god made a mistake did he see man is beginning to take his own order and when he takes his own order we're out of god's order brother man says there's only two orders gods and mans the mark of the beast is the same as the mark of the number of men 666. and you women putting on those little pants and things and wearing them out here and said this is for ladies i said no you're mistaken ladies don't wear them things he said women might but not ladies that's right the bible said it's an abomination for a woman to put on a garment for a man to put on a garment that pertains to a woman and men is becoming more sissified every day and women are becoming more masculine you ever see some pictures of a woman that's going like this oh my goodness exactly exactly he said what's the matter we're going to find out in a few minutes by the bible women ain't woman no more i don't mean you christian women i'm talking about the general run they want to act like men they want to cut their hair like men they want to put their hand on a bar like that and sing god bless america with a cigarette cigarette out of the corner of their mouth in the message the arrow of god's deliverance shot from a bowl brother brahm said seeing some of you women begin to wear your makeup and stuff like that the rest of the like the rest of the women in the world that nearly killed me and i walked in here the other day and i saw that look there's only one woman in the bible that ever paint your face you don't paint your face to meet god you do it to meet man and the woman that did that god fed her to the dog so when you're going to wear that just remember god turned you over to some dog meat when you see anybody doing that now keep away from that sean the very appearance of evil you might think i'm giving you a scorching but brother i believe it needs to be done here there's something that is wrong now i don't want you i don't want you to get angry with me i'm your brother i'm gonna make and god's going to make me answer before you at the day of judgment that's right the whole pentecostal world if they if they do let down don't you do it you stay true to god amen pray up live right associate yourself with god and his people and come out from among the worldly the ungodly things the bible says the holy spirit calls the people out no matter what your neighbor does and how good she is what this fellow does don't associate yourself with unbelief it'll leap right on to you just by associating yourself with it he said come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and i will receive you how hard would it be for the angels of god to be here in this room right now or free to this room how hard would it be for the angels of god to be in a bar right now with a bunch of sin going on and their nature to change more like the bar how hard would that be huh the the angels the angels of god no i don't mean to have trick questions maybe we should answer these i should probably say that ahead of time but the angels of god wormwood and and just uh gabriel and they they came into a bar how hard would it be for those angels to just change and become more corrupted see their their their very nature is of god it's holy it would be hard for them and it's hard for us when we're stuck in this nature satanic nature that we were born with to become holy now we can't do it with our efforts we just simply got to learn to die out learn the thing of denying self yielding to the holy ghost and saying these words lord fill me with your holy ghost fill me with your presence make me more like you then these everything will just fall into place brother adam said in the message a wedding supper he said now if eisenhower would send you an invitation how happy you would be and another thing i wouldn't think that you would try to go as an insult to mr eisenhower's supper by wearing your old greasy clothes would you think so all dirty and an old pair of hob nail shoes on whiskers all over your face or something or another you wouldn't go out and say hey look here i want to tell you something eisenhower told me i could come and i said oh that would be a disgrace to eisenhower and how much more disgraces it you who claim to have the invitation to the wedding supper and walk around with makeup on and act like the world smoking and drinking and carrying on clean up if you're going to the wedding supper he says you don't want to do that you you you get out of it see act like you're going somewhere i believe if you really got an invitation and accept it you will do it amen can you imagine my i'd clean all the dirt off from under my fingernails and clean everything else and and every little old dirty thing that's hanging on to you let us lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily beset us and run with patience the race that's set before us looking to the author and finisher of our faith oh my what an example he gave what ought we to do then we're going somewhere to a wedding supper and this is god speaking to the heart did you just hear what he said it was not brother branham speaking we've got to either believe that what we hear is god or it's brother john amen or some man that god's that brother john's reading about amen look i can fill this room with books of people that want to tell you about god i've never had an interest to read any of them never i'll stay with this message i stay with what the prophet said [Music] i why would i want to sit and read another book that i got to decipher is it is it makes sense with the messenger doesn't it i don't know the message enough to know whether something can be slid in there this message is all i need amen amen i'm all i'm not against other things i'm just i'm just saying i know that this is god speaking to the heart he says you don't realize what this is that you turn down each night in service when god knocks at your heart and said child i'm inviting you to come to me tonight come by the way of the cross where my precious son paid the price come in the come in at the door i'm inviting you and then you turn it down i imagine you wouldn't turn down mr eisenhower one time but you're turning down god think about that but god is long-suffering not willing that any should perish and he said come let us reason together saith the lord come let me talk it over with you oh i just love it come and let's sit down uh in the church tonight and forget about all the day's work and let us reason to the come let us reason together saith the lord think that god wanting to reason out your problems and in showing you and in so and in soul showing you where you're wrong by the preaching of the word he pretty much told us why we come to church right there and then giving you an invitation to come to his house for eternal life and you turn it down can you imagine that well that's what people do now they don't stand up and say i'm not coming you know what they do it's the same thing we ought to get so serious with god we don't care who's watching what's happening we need to get serious because i will say this you even know this someday it's going to be over amen well brother john i just don't think it's right now and i've got time okay okay but who is to say that you know that from god because not even the angels are told that so what you're doing is you're gambling with your souls god is calling us god is calling us where we're not unless you want to stand up and say i've arrived then i'm going to let you up here and i'm going to come sit down i i appreciate everybody's holiness here i do but we need more just not so much it's not the dress but it's your desire to to get a hold of this thing your behavior how you act when the going gets tough anybody can act right when you're getting patted on the back you're a good guy yeah but let somebody punch you talk behind your back curse at you then show me how you're going to act until until brother branham says until you have perfect love until you can get to the place where you can love every enemy no matter what they've done to you lay aside the rest of your life and go get perfect love get to that place because that's behavior that's behavior so i say today every one of us should feel i got to really dig into this not well i really think this is for you know this is for this is for brother bob you know he's a newbie no it's for brother john he's an old bee i need it just as much as bob and you do too you do too just got to open your heart let god show you what's going on in the message former and letter reign brother branham said the bible says it's an abomination for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to man all these things they walk right in just as wide open with their eyes as they can be stumbling in gross darkness think about that they know what they're doing but they're still blind and stumbling see there they know naturally what they're doing but spiritually they're blind that's why we have the gospel it's light the gospel is light and it shows us what's right wrong people who calling themselves christians women and men smoking cigarettes drinking and going to cocktail parties wearing shorts bobbing their hair wearing makeup manicure whatever it is on their face and walking right on exactly right and you scream out and you say brother brandon you're an old foggy foggy that's true there's only one g brother branham you're an old foggy you'll remember this someday take heed god sets up his tower he put somebody up there your pastor will scream out against it and if you're full gospel man and baptist and presbyterian and whoever is filled with the holy ghost will scream out against it no matter who it is he's a man of god his spirit will be like the holy spirit because it is part of the holy spirit and the holy spirit wrote the word and the holy spirit confirms the word everything he promised he takes care of it certainly it has to be we're in the last days and we're at the end time abraham said in the rejected king he says let me tell you something ladies i'm not making fun of you this is no place for that this is the place where judgment goes forth and judgment has to go right and judgment by the word of god lookie there was one woman in the entire bible that repaint her face one woman she never painted her face to meet and she painted and she never painted her face to me god she painted her face to meet a man to try to vamp him to vamp him jezebel he says you know what god did for her he fed her to the dogs that's exactly right so you see woman wearing makeup and those things you say that's miss dog meat that's exactly what it is before god he fed her to the dog so that's all she stood for were dogs he fed her to the dogs how many knows that to be the truth amen now here's the thing i know this is this sounds like a story and it's kind of like oh why are you talking about this look it's scriptural god is hidden in simplicity and our nature is to come to church do our duty and go home it is god's business to try to attract the attention of the bride that change can take place now i'm okay if you if you say you know what this is not for me i'm okay with that but you must say i'm not bride because this is the word of god this is not a word from man amen and when you begin to say well i'm not bride you know what you're what you're doing you're setting yourself up for tribulation we've got to get serious with this word god could come any minute i don't always come and never expect a preacher to ever tell you when he's coming amen everybody that i know that ever passed away god didn't tell him you're gonna pass away in this day at this time and this is what's gonna happen so get ready he may warn you about the season don't expect god to come to you to your low down i don't care enough to live for you with all my life to tell you when he's coming we heard the preaching of god it is it's it's our duty to put everything we got into god and to serve him with all of our lives today is the hour now is the hour to start walking in holiness well brother john i don't wear makeup and i don't smoke cigarettes and i don't wear shorts well praise god what are you doing somewhere down the line the shoe is fitting somebody at some time somewhere don't be a person that comes in the church and say you know the shoe never fit me today i'm afraid you brought your pitchfork and you forgot the rake one more and then we'll quit i can't get all done brother brahms said in the message thy siege shall possess the gate of the enemy he said women with their cut here wearing shorts and makeup and still professing to have the holy ghost depending on the evidence of speaking in tongues or jumping up and down or shouting he said they fail that still small voice of the word the word keeps you balanced to the cross how important it should be for us to love the word to love the word i'll say there's things in the word that when i read it hurts it cuts i want to read by fast buy it i don't want to preach about it come on i'm telling you the human nature brother random stayed away from things that he didn't understand didn't know how to to just handle but the thing is it's the word of god we need to come in love with all of it we need to come to grips with all of it somewhere down the line we've got a change and don't wait take this hour to respond to the call just accept the word well brother john my mom and my dad never taught me this i understand your mom my mom and dad never taught me this either but we're not this church is not the church of your mom and dad this is a church of god god is teaching us his word we're changing to become like him so we heard the call and now it the simplicity of responding to the call is where god has spoken to your heart personally he said this is what i'm calling you to do you say amen and you take that first step and if you fail before the day is over get back up and keep walking but if you don't take that first step god does not see your faith is that is that right it wasn't until abraham abraham believed god has counted him to righteousness but it wasn't until he brought back that fork that fork that knife that spoon and he was ready to slay isaac then god stayed his hand and says now i know god saw his faith by his works faith without works is dead so i'll just say it like this take a stand confess it this is your direction i'm going let the chips fall where they're going to fall i'm going to become more holy because god is holy well brother john i don't what's going to happen to my spouse what's going to happen to my boss what's going to happen to my it does not matter because this is serious business between you and your soul take a stand maybe if you take the right stand you'll be helping your soul and soul out by faith amen let's stand together praise the lord we can say praise the lord to the word of god amen let's let's bow our heart in a word of prayer maybe with every eye closed just trying to focus our thoughts for just a moment on what god has spoke to us personally one thing collectively god has spoken to all of us to become more holy and today god is has showed us how to respond to that call and if you've you've heard that still small voice something speaking to you you believe that it's him and you want to respond to that call now you don't have to lift your hand you don't have to to show publicly as if that's the answer but if you believe this is god speaking to you maybe you're here and you're desiring god's grace that you could respond to that call and you want me to pray with you you want god to see your need just lift up your hand and i'm going to pray with you god bless all these hands every hand every hand is lifted in this room praise the lord what a beautiful response we are all witnessing the beauty of the lord in this home in god's home the bible says he that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out so as we have come to him as we have lifted our hands as we are surrendering in our heart god promised that he would draw nigh to us he would give grace to the humble and we have humbled ourselves before him today and we can expect him to do mighty things in our life amen heavenly father we come to you just as humbly as we know how lord your word has had a profound effect in our life lord we have entered into your holiness and we feel the effect of it taking place in our life and we are responding with have thine own way with us lord have thine own way you are the potter we are the clay lord you saw not only the hand that defied gravity but you saw the deep desire inside every heart lord that desires the strength of the holy ghost and lord you're you're not asking any one of us to go out and live a life that we cannot live you're asking us to seek you that you could come in and live what you've asked us to live and i pray lord that you would [Music] bless every believer here every heart here as their hand was lifted that you would come into their vessel come into their heart that little chamber that place that you promised to meet them above the mercy seat and that you would give them that portion just a small portion of that holy spirit of yours that they could walk in the light that you've given them to stay and lord we know you'll have more for us so much more that we could all get to the place that we could be filled with that perfect love lord on rapture mourning [Music] will not be standing with works that we've done things that we've accomplished words that we've spoken sermons that we preached [Music] but we'll be standing knowing that we have the character of jesus christ manifested in a way that my all men shall know to have love one for another like you've loved us all when we're unworthy of it lord bless each heart may each one continue in their way in their homes in their workplaces when they're driving when they're in the supermarkets to be pressing towards perfect love to bring about lord the type of order that you want in our lives a holy order we thank thee oh lord for these things and we also thank you for what you're doing in our little church lord we're feeling your presence more and more we thank you for last prayer meeting lord you blessed us in an amazing way lord help us all to pray more that we can have more of these meetings lord feel your great presence lord to have our faith raised to the place lord that someone gets delivered right in the middle of the preaching someone gets filled with the holy ghost right in the middle of the preaching receiving the word of god for their lives oh god let there be a great unity amongst us keep us from saying anything negative one about another we love you we thank you for these things now lord we humbly pray them in jesus christ precious name amen we give you the glory for it or we give you the honor for it and we're in debt to you for these things now jesus amen amen let's sing to have thine own way lord have thine own amen just yield to our lord have thy known when thou art the power [Music] hold me
