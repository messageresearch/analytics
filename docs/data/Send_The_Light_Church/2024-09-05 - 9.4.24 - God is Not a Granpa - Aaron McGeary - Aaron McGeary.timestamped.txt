[28:04] out of numbers
[28:07] 23 and just taking one verse there verse
[28:11] 19 happy to be here and small crowds
[28:15] don't intimidate me and I know it's in
[28:18] the the DNA of this church to start with
[28:21] nothing and uh and just watch the Lord
[28:23] grow it over these many years and uh
[28:26] we've had a similar experience ourselves
[28:27] start starting a church from scratch and
[28:30] so I believe God's always faithful to
[28:32] meet us and truly if just one person is
[28:36] impacted by the word every effort has
[28:39] been worth it and so I do want to full
[28:43] disclosure my wife picked out my tithe
[28:46] this evening from among all of brother
[28:47] John's ties in his collection and uh we
[28:51] may have to ceremony burn it Friday
[28:54] night uh as this is burnt orange
[28:58] uh and so go Blue to anybody who's
[29:01] wondering why in the world I'm wearing
[29:02] this tie on the eve of a game against
[29:05] University of Texas but it was her
[29:08] choice uh I think mishy may be a little
[29:11] colorblind but we love you all like
[29:13] family it's so good to be here and as we
[29:15] have opportunity to minister Lord
[29:17] willing Sunday morning and' be wonderful
[29:19] if we just met in the air and didn't
[29:21] have to worry about it but if we are
[29:22] still here and God's will we'll be
[29:23] ministering so we'll send we'll just
[29:26] spend more time and greetings on Sund
[29:28] morning numbers 23: 19 it says God is
[29:32] not a man that he should lie neither the
[29:35] son of man that he should repent hath he
[29:38] said and shall he not do it or hath he
[29:40] spoken and shall not make it good amen
[29:43] if we could just bow our heads together
[29:45] now gracious Heavenly Father tonight as
[29:47] we have this opportunity to be together
[29:50] there's certainly uh more than enough
[29:52] for the mathematical requirement of two
[29:54] or three and Lord I do believe that
[29:56] we've gathered in your name in that
[29:57] character with this expectation and Lord
[30:00] You've blessed us with your presence
[30:02] through this song service you've also
[30:04] said that you inhabit the Praises of
[30:06] your people so Lord there have been
[30:07] Praises that have been lifted up and
[30:10] Lord we fear your name so we know that
[30:12] your angels are en kempt about us so
[30:14] father we're certain tonight that
[30:15] there's more present than we see and
[30:19] that there's things that are much more
[30:21] significant than what we could count or
[30:22] what we could perceive with our feelings
[30:24] Lord I pray tonight that you take this
[30:26] word that we've already read and bless
[30:28] it take those things which are upon our
[30:30] heart Lord make them alive to us as they
[30:32] are ministered make them alive To Us by
[30:34] your spirit as only you can we commit
[30:36] all things to you now in the name of the
[30:38] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you could be
[30:43] seated my my title tonight is God is not
[30:46] a grandpa and if uh if anyone thinks
[30:50] that this might be some sort of
[30:52] statement in the presence of the grandpa
[30:54] to my children uh it is not you'll
[30:58] understand just exactly uh where we're
[31:00] coming from as we continue but something
[31:02] I've just been studying on something
[31:04] that I've been uh prepared to minister
[31:05] on at home and coming here it's like
[31:07] home so I'm ministering something here I
[31:10] haven't ministered back at home and uh
[31:12] just as long as you don't push it out on
[31:14] social media they might not be any the
[31:16] wiser uh By Me ministering it here but
[31:19] the title in is uh this would be a part
[31:21] one of God is not a
[31:23] grandpa and uh this other slide I have
[31:27] here is um you may not be able to see it
[31:30] but there's a title of an article here
[31:32] that says God has no grandsons and it's
[31:35] exclamation point you'll find in the
[31:37] story itself that it's kind of bolded
[31:39] and made uh uh very profound and you
[31:44] this is an article written by David dupi
[31:46] in the Full Gospel men's voice it's in
[31:48] July August of 1960 the article is just
[31:52] two pages long but here's just a a
[31:54] little scan of it so you can see it and
[31:57] I'll just briefly condensed the article
[31:59] the article he says he was laying in bed
[32:01] it was early in the morning and a loud
[32:03] and clear voice was ringing in his head
[32:06] God has no grandsons and he said it just
[32:08] kept uh very clearly and he was inspired
[32:11] to check that with the scripture and he
[32:13] went to Romans 8:14 and he went to 1
[32:16] John 3:2 he went to Galatians 4 4-7 and
[32:19] he's reading everywhere where it's God
[32:21] is a father and we are his sons and we
[32:23] are the children of God and then he went
[32:25] to the Old Testament he searched through
[32:27] and he was just going through his Bible
[32:29] uh uh anywhere that he could find some
[32:31] sort of connection between God and a
[32:34] grandson and he concluded according to
[32:37] the Bible God is nobody's grandfather
[32:40] and he made the he wrote this in this
[32:41] article he said it was about 5: in the
[32:43] morning I switched off the light and put
[32:45] on my thinking cap what have I
[32:48] discovered nothing new I always knew God
[32:51] is our father in Heaven he is the father
[32:53] of all believers and Believers are in
[32:56] Christ Believers in Christ are called
[32:58] the sons of God so what I have only
[33:02] found a new way of saying an old truth
[33:05] God is nobody's grandfather only father
[33:09] and I know as I read this is very
[33:11] familiar to all of us and we know that
[33:12] brother brandham gave Brother David
[33:14] duplicity uh credit often when he quoted
[33:16] it but God brother brandham quoted this
[33:19] and referenced it many times he said God
[33:21] has no grandchildren God has no
[33:23] Pentecostal grandchildren and he often
[33:26] referred back to Brother David D
[33:28] as saying it and brother brandom
[33:31] mentioning it as frequently as he has
[33:33] and and using it in the context that he
[33:35] did I think it's a statement that's
[33:37] worth
[33:38] considering and brother brandom uses it
[33:40] to express the truth that God's seed are
[33:42] born directly from God that if you're
[33:44] going to be a seed of God you don't come
[33:47] through some other channel you come
[33:48] directly from God and that to be related
[33:52] to God that there's only one
[33:53] relationship and that's of a father to a
[33:56] son so you are if you're a related to
[33:59] God you're a direct descendant from God
[34:00] there's no intermediary God did not
[34:03] birth the son and then that son birthed
[34:05] the son and then God have some sort of
[34:07] loyalty or allegiance to it uh by virtue
[34:10] of the children giving birth but rather
[34:12] brother brandom shows over and over
[34:14] again that in order to be related to God
[34:16] you must be a child of God and if he has
[34:18] no grandsons he has no cousins or
[34:20] nephews or anything else you must be
[34:24] directly uh come you must directly come
[34:26] from God
[34:28] and I was thinking of I'm kind of maybe
[34:31] inverting in something and looking at it
[34:32] from this standpoint laying a foundation
[34:34] for Sunday morning but I think it's a a
[34:36] profound and necessary truth that's kind
[34:39] of hidden in something very simple as
[34:42] Brother David concluded he just says
[34:44] well I I've just learned a new way of
[34:45] saying an old truth and truly it is kind
[34:48] of just a it's nothing new in the Bible
[34:50] it wasn't a real profound Revelation but
[34:53] he just found a unique way to express
[34:55] something that we had always known and
[34:57] in the article he goes on to tell a
[34:59] story of how he sat next to a Catholic
[35:01] priest and he used this
[35:03] particular um Revelation to him or
[35:05] quickening to him that God has no
[35:07] grandsons to really challenge this
[35:09] priest's notion of Salvation and
[35:12] relationship so he saw a deeper meaning
[35:15] and connection with It ultimately but I
[35:17] want us as Believers to ponder the
[35:20] implications of the truth that God is
[35:23] not a grandpa now some of you may say
[35:25] grandpa or Grandpa or gr burger or
[35:29] something you might have some name Papa
[35:31] Opa different things that you might use
[35:33] for your grandparents uh but I'm just
[35:35] using Grandpa God is not a grandpa so
[35:38] think of this now as we go through some
[35:41] scriptures and just Fellowship on this
[35:43] for a little bit and I will I can
[35:46] testify that I am not abbreviating
[35:48] anything we're ministering tonight for
[35:50] the sake of our drive that we have later
[35:52] on I feel that the word should have
[35:54] preeminence but it is if it is brief
[35:56] it's only that we've laid the necessary
[35:58] Foundation to continue on Sunday morning
[36:01] in Hosea 11: 8 and9 God is speaking how
[36:06] shall I give thee up Ephraim how shall I
[36:08] deliver thee Israel how shall I make
[36:10] thee as adma how shall I set thee as
[36:13] zeum my heart is turned within me my
[36:17] repenting are kindled together these are
[36:20] pretty uh outstanding statements and he
[36:22] says I will not execute the fierceness
[36:25] of my anger I will not return to destroy
[36:27] Ephraim for I am God and not man the
[36:32] Holy One in the midst of thee and I will
[36:33] not enter into the City and God is uh
[36:38] raising these questions how can I give
[36:40] the up how can I how shall I deliver you
[36:42] I won't make you by like this or how can
[36:44] I make you like that my heart's turned
[36:46] my repenting are kindled together and it
[36:48] seems like maybe the musings or the
[36:50] thoughts or the emotions of a man but he
[36:53] says I will not destroy and in doing so
[36:56] he says my my wrath is kindled within me
[36:58] but I'm not going to destroy and so he
[37:00] makes this statement I think to kind of
[37:02] suggest that if I was man I could be
[37:04] given to this if I if I was a jealous
[37:07] person after a human sort I may not be
[37:10] able to control myself he says I am God
[37:12] and not man and I think that's a good
[37:15] place to start in thinking about the
[37:17] fact that God is not a grandpa is
[37:19] starting with the fact that he is God
[37:21] he's the Holy One and he's not man and
[37:25] man is a created being and he's created
[37:27] with a a body and we could say that's
[37:29] the flesh and blood it's the the
[37:30] physical part and he has a spirit that's
[37:33] the the mental and the intellectual and
[37:35] the emotional part and then he has a
[37:37] soul and though we see God expressed in
[37:40] a Triune way and we can see God
[37:42] manifested in threes perfected in threes
[37:44] uh God is not three in that he has a
[37:47] body spirit and soul God is not man and
[37:51] man is I want to make this very clear
[37:53] and it may seem to be the obvious and so
[37:55] this isn't uh a new truth but maybe just
[37:58] a new way of expressing an old truth but
[38:01] man is Humanity solely and so he has a
[38:04] distinct way of feeling he has a
[38:06] distinct way of thinking and perceiving
[38:08] and observing things and calculating
[38:10] things and in that he has a certain way
[38:13] of acting and God is making that
[38:15] distinction I I won't destroy Ephraim uh
[38:18] because I'm not man I'm God and and he's
[38:20] saying I want to be measured by
[38:23] something different than just the way a
[38:24] man would act in James chapter 5:1 17 it
[38:29] speaks of Elijah he says Elias was a man
[38:31] subject to like passions as we are and
[38:34] he prayed earnestly that it might not
[38:35] rain and it rained on on the Earth by
[38:37] the space of three years and six months
[38:40] and it's talking about the fervent
[38:41] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[38:44] and there was some belief amongst the
[38:47] Jews that perhaps Elijah was not man
[38:49] that he was somehow a different being or
[38:51] something elevated or something greater
[38:53] and so he's saying that Elijah as a man
[38:55] just like you I prayed and that fervent
[38:58] prayer and righteous man availed much
[39:01] and it's this phrase subject to like
[39:03] passions as we are that I want to use to
[39:07] cause us to think a little bit about the
[39:08] fact that we are human we're man when it
[39:11] says subject to like passions as we are
[39:12] let's not just think of men When God
[39:14] says I'm not a man we're not just
[39:16] thinking male but we're thinking
[39:18] Humanity I'm not
[39:19] human and Elijah was like a man both in
[39:24] mind and body just like anybody else hey
[39:27] had thoughts like all people have
[39:29] thoughts he had sicknesses and
[39:30] weaknesses and things in his flesh like
[39:33] we all do he had physical pain he had
[39:35] hunger he was weary in his flesh he also
[39:39] experienced emotional pain and anxiety
[39:41] he comes to a place in his life where he
[39:43] says it is enough and he wanted to die
[39:45] requested to die so we could say that
[39:47] even in an emotional sense he's subject
[39:49] to these thoughts of ending his life and
[39:52] uh uh emotional exhausting because these
[39:54] are the passions that humans experience
[39:58] and then it says of Jesus Christ in
[40:00] Hebrews 4:15 for we have not a high
[40:02] priest which cannot be touched with the
[40:05] fing of our infirmities but was in all
[40:08] points tempted like as we are yet
[40:10] without sin and this brings Christ uh
[40:13] God in relation to man through Christ
[40:16] where in Christ as the Son of God is now
[40:19] a high priest who can be touched by this
[40:21] phrase the feeling of our infirmities in
[40:23] other words he has experienced some of
[40:26] these same Passions that we experienced
[40:28] he's felt pain he's felt hunger he's
[40:31] been through things that provoked
[40:33] emotions that humans experience in a way
[40:35] that God himself cannot experience them
[40:38] even as it says here he was tempted like
[40:40] as we are but yet without without sin
[40:43] though he was subject to the same
[40:45] passions of hunger and weariness and
[40:47] emotional uh pain and rejection he did
[40:50] not uh sin in the Sin of impatience or
[40:54] the sin of unbelief or the sin of fear
[40:57] but he was yet human and as humans we
[41:00] have infirmities as humans we have
[41:03] temptations as humans we have passions
[41:06] in 1 Corinthians chapter 2: 11 Paul is
[41:10] this is a a really neat chapter to read
[41:12] together he says but for what man
[41:14] knoweth the things of man say the spirit
[41:16] of man which is in him in the 23 years
[41:19] I've been ministering here I've probably
[41:21] used this example maybe 23 times but uh
[41:24] many times we look at our dogs or we
[41:26] look at our pets and we just can't get
[41:27] our heads around the fact why are they
[41:29] acting the way that they're acting uh
[41:31] because we don't have the spirit of a
[41:33] dog inside of us to get in the side of a
[41:35] dog's head and relate to why they do the
[41:38] things that they do but yet another dog
[41:40] may look at Sophie and say Sophie I'm
[41:42] with you I love what you're doing there
[41:44] I would do the same thing if I had the
[41:46] opportunity and they kind of Nod or bark
[41:48] knowingly at one another because the
[41:50] dogs get it and what Paul is saying is
[41:53] that we know the things of man and we
[41:55] can relate to Man by the Spirit of man
[41:57] that is in Us in other words James is
[42:00] even appealing to that he says Elijah
[42:01] was a man just like us and subject to
[42:04] like passions like us so we can get
[42:06] Elijah Elijah could relate to us we
[42:08] should be able to relate to Elijah but
[42:10] he says even so the things of God
[42:11] knoweth no man but the spirit of God so
[42:14] he's making this distinction and
[42:16] dividing between the spirit of man which
[42:18] knows Humanity which knows flesh knows
[42:20] blood know knows the the mind of man and
[42:22] the thoughts of man when someone comes
[42:25] to you and says I'm I'm feeling down
[42:27] today you can immediately begin to
[42:28] relate in some way in your life to what
[42:30] it's like to feel down if somebody says
[42:32] man I'm so excited it's like Christmas
[42:34] morning even if you never celebrated
[42:36] Christmas or know what a Christmas
[42:38] morning's like you know uh the emotions
[42:40] that they're trying to conjure up or at
[42:42] least express to you because those are
[42:44] things that just relate to
[42:46] man but Paul is drawing this dividing
[42:49] line saying that but you can't know the
[42:51] nature of God through the nature of man
[42:54] he even go so far as to say that the
[42:56] natural man is enmity with God and the
[42:57] human mind is opposed to God so God is
[43:01] distinct in himself he is a being unto
[43:04] himself and we cannot know him just by
[43:07] relating solely to human
[43:10] characteristics now in Acts chapter 14
[43:13] verses 11 to 18 this is um a little bit
[43:17] not really maybe a lengthy reading but
[43:18] it's a longer story that uh I'm only
[43:21] just trying to pull a couple things out
[43:23] of and it says and when the people saw
[43:25] what Paul had done they lifted up their
[43:26] voice is saying in the speech Loni uh
[43:30] lonia they're they're now they've seen
[43:32] these Miracles they say the the gods are
[43:35] come down to us in the likeness of men
[43:39] now notice just what these Heathen or
[43:41] these Idol worshippers responses were
[43:43] their response was to something
[43:45] Supernatural something Beyond themselves
[43:47] and so they I want you to kind of catch
[43:49] this human instinct because even though
[43:52] we may not be Idol worshippers they're
[43:54] still kind of this is the human thought
[43:56] the gods are come down and now are
[43:58] manifesting themselves in men and so
[44:01] they said they called Barnabas Jupiter
[44:02] and Paul mercurius because he was the
[44:05] chief speaker so they're seeing that
[44:07] these are Jupiter and Mercury that are
[44:09] come down in the flesh then the priest
[44:11] of Jupiter which was before their City
[44:13] brought oxen and garlands unto the gates
[44:16] and would have done sacrifices with the
[44:17] people which when the apostles barnabus
[44:21] and Paul heard of they rent their
[44:22] clothes and ran in among the people
[44:24] crying out and saying s why do ye these
[44:28] things we also are men of like passions
[44:32] with you so this phrase subject to like
[44:36] passions or we are men of like passions
[44:39] with you is to bring them down out of
[44:42] gods that have come down or out of deity
[44:45] that ought to be worshiped and to make
[44:47] this connection with them to say we are
[44:49] human just like you and in some ways it
[44:53] should be regarded that we are only
[44:55] human just like you
[44:57] and and maybe there's times you know
[44:59] maybe uh Eliza might have some Idols of
[45:02] hers when it comes to artist and it may
[45:04] seem to be a god of art or Preston may
[45:06] have some Idols when it comes to fishing
[45:09] a and it may be that they might be Gods
[45:11] to them and but yet we got to realize
[45:14] they're all human we should never
[45:15] Elevate somebody above somebody else we
[45:17] should never make somebody out to be uh
[45:20] more than who they are and not to
[45:22] elevate them to gods or idols and so
[45:24] Paul is saying we are humans just like
[45:27] you men of like passions we're not Gods
[45:30] we're not deity in some uh sense that we
[45:33] ought to be worshiped and things brought
[45:34] to us uh to honor us he says and we
[45:37] preach to you as these men that you
[45:39] should turn from these vanities unto the
[45:41] Living God turn from Jupiter turn from
[45:43] Mercury turn from these false idols and
[45:47] unto a living God which made Heaven and
[45:49] Earth and the Sea and all things that
[45:51] are therein when time pass suffered All
[45:53] Nations to walk in their own ways
[45:55] nevertheless he left not himself without
[45:57] witness in that he did good and gave us
[45:59] rain from heaven in fruitful Seasons
[46:01] filling our hearts with food and
[46:03] gladness so he's attributing even those
[46:05] things that we enjoy naturally as having
[46:07] come from God and with these sayings
[46:09] scarce restrained they the people that
[46:12] they had not done sacrifice unto them so
[46:16] if we're just focusing with us and again
[46:18] we're not going to have a lot of time so
[46:20] uh if if you're taking notes maybe that
[46:23] might be a good way pressing Eliza just
[46:24] use your pens and paper uh to to take
[46:27] notes and write these scriptures down
[46:29] and and not be distracted but these are
[46:32] things that we're wanting just to kind
[46:35] of catch the thought that as men we have
[46:38] human Tendencies we have human needs we
[46:40] have human wants we have ways that we
[46:42] conduct ourselves and each one of these
[46:44] scriptures has shown us that there's
[46:45] human passions there's human wants
[46:47] there's human perceptions there's human
[46:49] needs and God himself said I am God and
[46:55] not man
[46:57] so God is not like man despite any
[47:00] similarities uh that might be ascribed
[47:03] to him uh or there might be ways that he
[47:05] has manifested himself to where he seems
[47:07] humanlike or or there is ways that are
[47:10] attributes that God has as a father or
[47:12] God loves or God is jealous even though
[47:15] God may have certain things in a
[47:17] language we use to describe him God is
[47:19] not man he says of himself in Isaiah 55:
[47:23] 8 and9 for my thoughts are not your
[47:25] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[47:28] saith the Lord uh brother Jonathan
[47:32] that's Emma's dad he said he sent me a a
[47:34] meme one time and it was two Cowboys
[47:36] around a campfire and the one Cowboy's
[47:39] kind of looking up and he says do You
[47:40] Hear What I Hear the other Cowboy said
[47:43] no I Hear What I
[47:44] Hear and in some ways this is kind of
[47:49] what God is saying but I would say it's
[47:51] much bigger than that and that he says
[47:53] you don't think like I think and he said
[47:55] well yeah I know your thoughts are not
[47:56] my thoughts you think your own thoughts
[47:58] and I I I have my own ways and you have
[48:00] your own ways but he said my thoughts
[48:01] are your not thought not your thoughts
[48:03] and my ways are not your ways in other
[48:05] words you're human and you behave in a
[48:07] human manner my ways are higher for as
[48:09] the heavens are higher than the earth so
[48:11] are my ways higher than your ways in my
[48:13] thoughts than your thoughts God is
[48:16] distinguishing among human emotions and
[48:18] his own emotions he's distinguishing
[48:20] among human processes and thoughts and
[48:23] perceptions from uh his own thoughts
[48:26] saying that you ought not to think and
[48:29] even as he says you ought not think like
[48:31] the godhead is liken under things that
[48:32] are fashioned by man and crafted by by
[48:35] human beings and so we shouldn't think
[48:37] God operates within the manner of man I
[48:41] I know for me one thing that became a
[48:43] tremendous victory in my life is to
[48:44] recognize just how subtly I took uh my
[48:48] experiences in being loved and my
[48:50] experiences in loving and quietly and
[48:54] subconsciously Associated that with the
[48:56] love that God had for me as if to say
[48:58] that all love is the same love and
[49:00] therefore I love somebody and I can
[49:02] mistreat them I've Been Loved by people
[49:04] who mistreated me and so you kind of
[49:06] build into love this tendency to be
[49:10] perverted or to be harsh or to be cruel
[49:11] or to be distant or to punish us it but
[49:14] God's love is not like our love God's
[49:17] thoughts are not like our thoughts God's
[49:19] ways are not like our ways I think in
[49:22] Hosea it's exactly what he's saying is
[49:24] my heart is turned within me my
[49:25] repenting are kindled together together
[49:27] I'm not going to execute my wrath and my
[49:29] anger and pour it out upon Ephraim
[49:31] because I'm not a man and that's what a
[49:33] man would do but I'm God and I won't do
[49:37] it and as we read in numbers 23: 19 just
[49:41] notice again how specifically this is to
[49:45] the difference between God and man God
[49:47] is not a man that he should lie neither
[49:49] the son of man that he should
[49:51] repent we find that God repents if the
[49:54] scriptures speak of God's repenting
[49:55] being kindled together God repented that
[49:57] he ever made man we recognize that it is
[50:00] not as a son of man or a human or a mere
[50:04] mortal that God would do so because God
[50:06] is not man that he would lie God is not
[50:09] the son of man that he would ever need
[50:11] to repent whatever he says he will do he
[50:14] does it and he if he's spoken he'll make
[50:16] it good is what uh balum is saying and
[50:18] what he is expressing and we've heard
[50:20] the phrase God is not man that he should
[50:22] lie we have the the principle let every
[50:25] man's word be a lied let God's word be
[50:27] the truth why because God is not man
[50:30] that he should lie we should think of it
[50:33] this way God does not operate like a man
[50:36] he's not subject to the same passions as
[50:39] a man he's not subject to the same
[50:41] instincts as a man is subject to them 1
[50:46] Corinthians chap 2:14 having already
[50:48] read verse 11 it says but the natural
[50:50] man receiveth not the things of the
[50:52] spirit of God for they are foolishness
[50:54] unto him neither can he know them
[50:56] because they are spiritually discerned
[50:58] the things of God are not known by
[51:00] living a human experience we cannot even
[51:03] say well God is a father therefore I as
[51:05] a father can relate uh perfectly to God
[51:08] no we can't we can't say well God is a
[51:10] Creator so if you created something or
[51:12] you're an artist or you're a fabricator
[51:14] you can't then begin to uh uh lift
[51:17] yourself up to say oh I'm something like
[51:19] God is or discern the nature of God he
[51:22] can only be known through the spirit the
[51:25] natural man can not receive the things
[51:27] of God because they're foolishness to
[51:30] him even in the way that what man calls
[51:32] great God calls foolishness and what God
[51:34] calls great man thinks its foolishness
[51:36] so the things of God in many ways are
[51:38] beneath man he thinks himself better and
[51:40] higher than even these things because
[51:43] the natural man is not God and God is
[51:46] not a natural
[51:48] man in 1 Corinthians chapter 10: 12 13
[51:51] and 14 he says wherefore let him that
[51:55] thinketh he standeth take ke lest he
[51:58] fall and then he uh there's this I would
[52:02] let me just back up and say we ought not
[52:05] to he says he that thinks he stands and
[52:07] so he's really maybe calling out the
[52:08] fact that you don't actually stand but
[52:10] if any man thinks he stands on his own
[52:12] accord his own effort his own discipline
[52:14] his own choices take heed lest you fall
[52:17] for if we stand we're standing in Christ
[52:19] if we stand it's by his grace and he
[52:21] says there hath no temptation taken you
[52:24] but such as common to man again I think
[52:27] this relates to we are subject to like
[52:30] passions as Paul and Barnabas out say
[52:32] said out loud uh to the people and uh be
[52:35] we have feelings of infirmities and we
[52:37] are tempted as mortal men and and we're
[52:40] subject to like passions as we are as uh
[52:42] James wrote so there's this I think this
[52:44] statement is in the same vein there's no
[52:47] temptation that you fight with that you
[52:49] wrestle with but such as common to man
[52:52] there are things that are common to man
[52:54] in other words it's commonly found among
[52:56] men we could actually go so far as to
[52:57] say then that there are things that are
[52:59] not only common to man but exclusive to
[53:02] man and then he says but God and I'd
[53:06] like for that just to kind of linger a
[53:07] little bit that there are things
[53:08] Temptations feelings passions desires
[53:11] thoughts ways that are common to man but
[53:14] God but God is different God is not like
[53:18] man that he should like God is not like
[53:20] man that he would be subject to these
[53:22] different Temptations and passions but
[53:24] he is faithful who will not suffer you
[53:26] to be temped above that you are able but
[53:28] will with the Temptation also make a way
[53:30] to escape that you may be able to Bear
[53:32] it and then this I would say a
[53:36] curious notation wherefore my dearly
[53:38] beloved flee from
[53:42] idolatry and there's a lot that could be
[53:44] said here but in the context of how he
[53:47] is saying this he that thinks he stands
[53:49] take heed lest he fall because you're
[53:52] tempted just like every other man no
[53:54] matter how righteous you may feel that
[53:56] you are no matter how disciplined you
[53:58] may be no matter how much you've claimed
[54:01] to uh avoid or uh not be uh fall to he's
[54:06] saying there's no temptation but has
[54:07] taken you but such as common to men all
[54:10] men are subject to passions subject to
[54:12] Temptation so he says my dearly beloved
[54:15] flee from
[54:16] idolatry flee from and and idolatry be
[54:19] turning something that is in fact not
[54:21] God into a God uh you you cannot turn
[54:25] God into an idol because he's the one
[54:27] true God you cannot worship God in
[54:29] spirit and in truth and that be idolatry
[54:31] you cannot worship uh God as he is and
[54:34] see him as he is and ascribe to him
[54:36] greatness and glory and that be idolatry
[54:38] but you can ascribe deity to inherently
[54:41] human characteristics and that be
[54:44] idolatry or you can also give ascribe uh
[54:48] deity to human in or you can ascribe
[54:50] human intellect and human emotions to
[54:53] God in that be
[54:54] idolatry and other words to justify your
[54:57] own anger or your own jealousy as a
[54:59] Godly jealousy or a godly Vengeance to
[55:03] act out in in some sort of fanaticism or
[55:06] some sort of emotion or even some
[55:08] intellect or some cold inform formal way
[55:10] and ascribe that to God idolatry can be
[55:12] on all those different spectrums where
[55:14] you either ascribe human traits and
[55:17] characteristics to God to deify the
[55:19] humanity or you bring God down into
[55:22] Humanity by saying that some human
[55:25] thought proc process or emotion is
[55:29] God but God is not a grandpa everything
[55:32] we've shared to this point has been to
[55:34] establish this distinction that there is
[55:37] God and then there is man so then now as
[55:40] we examine we've made this difference
[55:42] between God deity the Divine the Eternal
[55:46] Elohim the Holy One and Humanity man
[55:49] flesh son daughter mother Grandpa
[55:51] grandfather Grandma you name it anything
[55:53] that's Flesh and Blood God is not a
[55:57] grandpa brother Bram pointed to him many
[56:00] many times as Brother David duplicity
[56:02] said he has no
[56:04] grandsons and let me say something that
[56:06] might shock you nor does he want
[56:12] them this may seem and I would say in
[56:15] general this is in congruent with human
[56:18] experience and just even our emotional
[56:20] Instinct how many grandmas and grandpas
[56:24] do we have here tonight just raise your
[56:26] hand know the house is just full of
[56:28] those that have experienced this so it
[56:33] is a for you to think that God would say
[56:38] say God do you have any grandchildren
[56:40] says no I have no grandchildren and you
[56:42] might think
[56:44] a and he'd say well no don't awe me I
[56:48] don't even want
[56:50] them and for human beings I could say
[56:53] this and I'm really speaking out of turn
[56:55] because I haven't personally only
[56:56] experienced this but the thought of
[56:57] having grandchildren I have maybe
[56:59] experienced this thought the the you
[57:01] don't have the thought of having
[57:03] grandchildren early in life I imagine if
[57:05] I was to ask Jack have you given any
[57:06] thought to your grandchildren he'd say
[57:08] no if I ask Preston the same Elliot the
[57:10] same and and you ask young people you
[57:13] know are your thoughts on grandchildren
[57:15] they like I think you're skipping some
[57:16] steps there brother Aaron there's a ways
[57:19] I would have to go before I could start
[57:20] looking forward to her thinking about
[57:22] grandchildren so the idea of being a
[57:25] grandparent or having grandchildren
[57:26] isn't something that comes up early in
[57:28] life nor is it even something that comes
[57:29] up in marriage but once children come
[57:32] there is a point in a parent life where
[57:36] they begin to look forward to
[57:38] grandchildren and I may try to come back
[57:40] to that particular thought uh later on
[57:42] on Sunday or later on on Sunday morning
[57:45] but we there's maybe a point where now
[57:48] having had children or grand children
[57:50] you start thinking about the idea of
[57:54] what of now being a Grand parent and not
[57:56] just a
[57:58] parent and in looking forward to having
[58:01] these little ones uh this is this is
[58:03] human nature this is this is the
[58:05] evolution of things and I believe
[58:08] scripturally that parents there should
[58:10] be some thought given to uh the future
[58:13] that you should have your future the
[58:15] future in mind as you raise children I
[58:17] maybe I could back up and say you should
[58:18] have the future in mind when you marry
[58:20] brother Braham said when a man chooses a
[58:21] wife it says something about the his
[58:23] future home so the future is in mind
[58:26] when we choose to court when we choose
[58:27] to marry and we ought to act with the
[58:30] future in mind we plant our potatoes as
[58:33] if there's going to be a harvest we we
[58:35] act and we do things now that we
[58:36] wouldn't regret later and so we're
[58:38] always in this mindset of of living out
[58:41] our lives as if there's going to be some
[58:43] sort of future and so scripturally
[58:45] parents as they raise their children
[58:47] should not only just have the future in
[58:49] mind but they should have their
[58:50] grandchildren in mind not just their
[58:52] children but even their children's
[58:54] children because proverbs 13:22 says a
[58:57] good man leaveth an inheritance to his
[59:00] children's children and the wealth of
[59:02] the sinner is laid up for the just in
[59:03] other words a sinner is just going to
[59:04] squander it anyways and it'll only go to
[59:06] the just and the upright and so it says
[59:09] a good man leaves an inheritance for his
[59:12] children's children anybody know a way
[59:14] that they could write that where it uses
[59:15] fewer words leaves an inheritance to his
[59:19] grandchildren your children's children
[59:21] are your grandchild so it say A Good Man
[59:24] is a grandfather who Lee has left an
[59:27] inheritance to his
[59:30] grandchildren in 1 Timothy
[59:33] 5:4 a very specific admonishments that
[59:36] are taking place here but just want to
[59:37] isolate this one it says but if any
[59:39] widow have children or
[59:41] nephews and it kind of does seem a
[59:44] little odd that it would talk about
[59:46] children also just single out the
[59:47] nephews we might begin to think about
[59:48] what about our nieces and what about
[59:50] cousins but this word here actually is
[59:53] also and could have been translated to
[59:54] grandchildren it's the same word that
[59:56] would have been used for grandchildren
[59:58] so if a widow has children or
[1:00:01] grandchildren let them learn first to
[1:00:03] show piety at home and to requite their
[1:00:07] parents for that is good and acceptable
[1:00:09] before God so the Bible is bringing a
[1:00:12] grandchild up no doubt when Brother
[1:00:15] David duplicity went through the
[1:00:16] scripture and started trying to find any
[1:00:18] instance of a gr grandpa or grandfather
[1:00:21] he might have find a reference to
[1:00:22] Timothy's grandmother Lois he might have
[1:00:24] found this reference to a children's
[1:00:26] children which would be grandchildren
[1:00:28] maybe even here in Timothy that a widow
[1:00:30] who has children or grandchildren let
[1:00:33] the let the grandchildren and the
[1:00:34] children show piety and Grace to her at
[1:00:37] home let not the Widow be a burden to
[1:00:39] the church but let the family take care
[1:00:42] of her and require requireed their
[1:00:44] parents in other words take care of them
[1:00:46] in their old age in their widowhood just
[1:00:49] as they had and pay them back for how
[1:00:51] they took care of you so this is God
[1:00:54] observing the natur or God knowing the
[1:00:56] natural Order of Things Paul having
[1:00:58] wisdom in the natural Order of Things
[1:00:59] saying that the Widow who has children
[1:01:02] or grandchildren let her be taken care
[1:01:04] of at home so the Bible isn't just
[1:01:09] ignoring the dynamic of grandchildren or
[1:01:12] the the responsibility of a parent to
[1:01:14] children and therefore by extension
[1:01:16] grandchildren or even the obligation of
[1:01:18] a grandchild to a grandparent it it
[1:01:21] acknowledges it
[1:01:23] scripturally but let me say this if God
[1:01:25] has no grandsons to be a
[1:01:28] grandparent and to have some sort of
[1:01:31] responsibility to a grandparent or as a
[1:01:33] grandchild have a responsibility to a
[1:01:35] grandparent this is purely a human
[1:01:38] responsibility it's purely a human
[1:01:41] phenomena it is something that I'm qu
[1:01:44] I'm just speaking out of turn and don't
[1:01:46] correct me right now in public but as
[1:01:49] far as I know there's there's not a lot
[1:01:51] of uh grandparent relationships within
[1:01:54] nature uh the you'll find certain uh
[1:01:57] areas where breeding habits may take
[1:01:59] place and there may be certain
[1:02:00] responsibilities within larger packs and
[1:02:03] flocks of animals H within a murder of
[1:02:06] crows I don't know there might be a
[1:02:08] grandparent within them but typically
[1:02:10] you find the uh multiple generation of
[1:02:12] mother to child and then that one goes
[1:02:15] off and it starts itself and there's all
[1:02:16] these relationships that are parent to
[1:02:18] child but then within human nature
[1:02:21] within our human uh classes and
[1:02:23] societies and ethnicities there's this
[1:02:25] responsibility in relationship of among
[1:02:28] family members and in particular a
[1:02:30] grandparent to a grandchild but God has
[1:02:33] no grandsons so that relationship is
[1:02:36] inherently human it is a human
[1:02:39] responsibility is a human phenomena that
[1:02:41] God himself doesn't have the same
[1:02:43] obligations there's nothing in the
[1:02:45] scripture to say that God is required to
[1:02:48] look after his grandchildren because God
[1:02:49] say I have none you could never prove it
[1:02:52] with DNA you can never prove it with the
[1:02:54] family tree God has no grandchildren
[1:02:59] right he is in fact not a
[1:03:02] grandpa and he doesn't want to
[1:03:05] be and the fact that he is not a grandpa
[1:03:08] and nor does he even want to be a
[1:03:09] grandpa may seem to be
[1:03:15] antihuman and I'm sure the grandparents
[1:03:17] are thinking yeah this kind of an odd
[1:03:19] put me in an odd spot here imagine
[1:03:22] brother John's thinking thanks
[1:03:23] son-in-law
[1:03:26] all my efforts to be virtuous as a
[1:03:28] grandpa to be Christlike and you're
[1:03:30] proving that as a grandpa I'm completely
[1:03:32] ungodlike that's not what I'm asserting
[1:03:35] God is not a
[1:03:37] grandpa and I'm I'm just going to be
[1:03:39] wrapping this up here in just the next
[1:03:41] few moments we don't have a lot more to
[1:03:43] share um I didn't anticipate just how
[1:03:46] long sometimes I'm when I'm ministering
[1:03:48] here you you all pull so much out of me
[1:03:50] that I could take just a page of notes
[1:03:52] and go three hours and you think I'm
[1:03:53] long-winded well I don't want to be a
[1:03:55] long-winded preacher
[1:03:57] but God is not a grandpa so then we have
[1:04:00] to ask ourselves why is it he's not a
[1:04:02] grandpa why is it that he has no
[1:04:05] grandsons or what is it that maybe we
[1:04:07] could get in put our thinking cap on and
[1:04:10] then look at what brother brandham had
[1:04:11] to say when he took this statement by
[1:04:13] Brother David duplicity and and took it
[1:04:15] to say say teach us something by it and
[1:04:18] so me I'm just kind of going to say this
[1:04:20] based upon what I believe brother bandam
[1:04:21] emphasized often when he used this this
[1:04:23] statement the chief lesson
[1:04:26] is there is no relationship to God
[1:04:28] unless you have been born of his Spirit
[1:04:31] no relationship to God you may be human
[1:04:34] you may be Earth you may be animal you
[1:04:36] may be all these different things but
[1:04:38] the you only relationship that they
[1:04:40] would You' have to God in that respect
[1:04:42] would be the created and he would be the
[1:04:43] Creator but there's no love relationship
[1:04:47] there's no bond there's no Affinity
[1:04:49] there's no relationship in terms of uh
[1:04:52] uh not to be created by a as something
[1:04:55] fabricated but to come from there's no
[1:04:57] relationship or chain back to God unless
[1:05:00] you have been born directly from God by
[1:05:02] his
[1:05:03] spirit so I may be ending up in the
[1:05:05] obvious place but if we could just read
[1:05:07] John chapter 3 veres 1 to9 I'd like to
[1:05:11] read this just to express to you the
[1:05:14] idea this Chief lesson of why God is not
[1:05:18] a
[1:05:19] grandpa says there was a man of the
[1:05:21] Pharisees named Nicodemus the ruler of
[1:05:23] the Jews the same came to Jesus by night
[1:05:25] and said unto him Rabbi we know that
[1:05:27] thou art a teacher come from God for no
[1:05:29] man could do these Miracles that thou
[1:05:31] doest except God be with him here is
[1:05:34] Humanity recognizing something Beyond
[1:05:37] Humanity that he must come from God
[1:05:40] there must be some a connection with God
[1:05:43] because he's doing things that only God
[1:05:45] could do and some ways we could say it's
[1:05:46] the same thing that these men of lonia
[1:05:49] had themselves recognized but them
[1:05:50] worshiping Jupiter and Mercury wanted to
[1:05:52] say that the gods have come are in the
[1:05:54] likeness of man and wanted to worship
[1:05:56] him but Nicodemus being a Believer he
[1:05:59] comes and he says we know that you must
[1:06:02] be from God if you're able to accomplish
[1:06:05] these
[1:06:06] things and the answer that Jesus has I
[1:06:09] think is kind of interesting considering
[1:06:11] the prompt acknowledging that you must
[1:06:14] come from God and God must be with you
[1:06:16] and it kind of a confession this
[1:06:19] affirmation of believe for Faith and
[1:06:21] then Jesus uh almost goes right past
[1:06:24] that to the real heart of the issue and
[1:06:25] he says verily verily I say unto thee
[1:06:27] except a man be born again he cannot see
[1:06:31] the kingdom of God Nicodemus had been
[1:06:33] making observations he had witnessed the
[1:06:36] supernatural he says no man can do the
[1:06:38] things that you do no man can do these
[1:06:41] Miracles unless God be with you so I
[1:06:44] believe you are a teacher that has come
[1:06:46] from God so having made these external
[1:06:49] observations Jesus says unless you're
[1:06:51] born again you cannot understand the
[1:06:53] kingdom of God you can observe speculate
[1:06:56] as to whether or not something has come
[1:06:57] from God you could even rightly conclude
[1:06:59] that this is Supernatural this is a
[1:07:01] miracle but you cannot understand what
[1:07:03] God is doing unless you're born again
[1:07:06] amen you can believe and you can
[1:07:09] experience and you can enjoy and you can
[1:07:11] have association with and even be
[1:07:13] touched by but you're never going to be
[1:07:15] able to relate to it and be a part of it
[1:07:17] and know what it is unless you are born
[1:07:20] again amen well this statement confounds
[1:07:22] Nicodemus who says how can a man be born
[1:07:25] born when he's
[1:07:26] old can he enter the second time into
[1:07:29] his mother's womb and be
[1:07:31] born and let me let me just say let me
[1:07:34] read verse n quickly and he answers to
[1:07:37] Jesus again how can these things be so
[1:07:40] Nicodemus being a man and understanding
[1:07:43] how births work I don't think he's being
[1:07:46] a smart alec I didn't I don't know
[1:07:48] Nicodemus maybe he was a a pretty funny
[1:07:50] guy but he says how can a man be born
[1:07:53] when he's old
[1:07:55] that Jesus again is saying something
[1:07:57] unless you be born birth from above and
[1:08:00] it it must have put Nicodemus in the
[1:08:02] mind of a babe coming forth the language
[1:08:06] that he uses would be unless you're
[1:08:07] ushered forth from above unless you are
[1:08:09] born again from heaven and you come
[1:08:12] forth uh a new and again you cannot
[1:08:16] understand the kingom of God he says
[1:08:17] well I've been born I've lived this life
[1:08:18] I'm an old man how is it that I can come
[1:08:20] through the birth canal again how is it
[1:08:21] I can come forth as a babe again Jesus
[1:08:24] say verily verely I thee he says except
[1:08:27] a man be born of water and of spirit he
[1:08:29] cannot enter into the Kingdom of
[1:08:31] Heaven that which is born of the flesh
[1:08:34] is flesh does that sound familiar
[1:08:36] subject to like passions no temptation
[1:08:39] but such as common to man these are God
[1:08:42] is not man God is not flesh this
[1:08:45] statement that which is born of the
[1:08:46] flesh is flesh man understands the
[1:08:48] things of man because he is man this
[1:08:51] scripture just summarizes what we read
[1:08:53] in James and in Hebrews and Corinthians
[1:08:55] and acts and and numbers and all these
[1:08:58] and even Isaiah this summarizes it flesh
[1:09:01] is flesh if you're born of a woman you
[1:09:04] think as a human your flesh is flesh but
[1:09:06] that which is born of the spirit is
[1:09:09] Spirit Marvel not that thou hearest the
[1:09:12] sound says Marvel not that I say unto
[1:09:14] thee ye must be born again don't
[1:09:18] Marvel that which is born of the flesh
[1:09:20] understands fleshly things but you must
[1:09:22] be born of the spirit to understand
[1:09:24] something super natural and spiritual
[1:09:26] you must be bornn again so now it is not
[1:09:29] just well unless you unless you're born
[1:09:31] again you can't understand the kingdom
[1:09:32] of God now we saying it's not just a
[1:09:34] matter of whether or not you understand
[1:09:36] it's a
[1:09:37] must the song says there is a must my
[1:09:41] friend you must be born
[1:09:43] again the wind bloweth where it listeth
[1:09:46] and thou hearest the sound thereof but
[1:09:47] th cannot tell when it cometh and
[1:09:49] whether it goeth so is everyone that is
[1:09:52] born of the
[1:09:53] spirit if we turn back on Nicodemus is
[1:09:56] first question I I know that you're a
[1:09:58] teacher come from
[1:10:01] God and you do these Miracles and you
[1:10:03] couldn't do them unless God was with you
[1:10:05] and well the wind blows and you hear the
[1:10:09] sound you've he you you've heard the
[1:10:11] wind
[1:10:12] blow you you've felt its
[1:10:15] Breeze but unless you're born of the
[1:10:17] spirit you really don't know what it
[1:10:20] is so Nicodemus walks away saying how he
[1:10:24] answers and said unto him how how can
[1:10:26] these things
[1:10:28] be you must be born
[1:10:32] again this is what is at the heart of
[1:10:35] these new even as the article expresses
[1:10:39] how that Pentecost had been come down to
[1:10:41] this condition where it's by tradition
[1:10:44] and it's by the experience of doing
[1:10:46] these different things and and that's
[1:10:48] what made you a part of it so you're
[1:10:49] just born into it and born into it and
[1:10:51] born into it now you just have
[1:10:52] generations of people that are piling up
[1:10:54] within churches who are Pentecostal by
[1:10:56] natural birth by natural right they're
[1:10:58] they're messaged Believers because their
[1:11:00] parents were messaged Believers and
[1:11:01] that's the way they were raised and so
[1:11:03] God is not a grandpa to say that you
[1:11:05] cannot be a Christian you cannot be a
[1:11:07] child of God unless you have been born
[1:11:09] again regardless of who or what your
[1:11:12] parents in their experience are or what
[1:11:15] they've had you need one
[1:11:19] yourself and thank God for some of us
[1:11:21] had parents who had no identity in
[1:11:23] Christ nor experience in Christ
[1:11:25] and it didn't condemn us to a life of
[1:11:27] not being experienced in Christ and in
[1:11:29] the same way that you're not bound by
[1:11:32] the the the lack of experience in your
[1:11:34] parents you're not liberated by your
[1:11:36] parents experience from
[1:11:38] sin and let me say this it's a great
[1:11:40] blessing to be a child of a child of God
[1:11:45] I testify that for me being born to
[1:11:47] parents that love God that serve God
[1:11:49] that were Christians my dad being a
[1:11:51] minister of the message my mom being a
[1:11:53] faithful wife to him and supporting him
[1:11:56] and being raised in a home first
[1:11:58] generation uh really first generation
[1:12:00] Christians and first generation message
[1:12:01] Believers it's a blessing to have been
[1:12:04] raised in that
[1:12:06] family and I say that there are many
[1:12:08] benefits to be a child of a child of
[1:12:13] God but there is no lawful
[1:12:16] inheritance and there would have been no
[1:12:18] lawful inheritance for me though my
[1:12:21] parents being in joint heirs with Christ
[1:12:23] by their own experience with God that
[1:12:25] the will and the reading of the word of
[1:12:26] God and the way that the law the
[1:12:28] testation would work and and the way
[1:12:30] everything was drawn up there I wasn't
[1:12:32] written into the will I couldn't be a
[1:12:34] joint Heir because they were
[1:12:37] right you cannot be a joint Heir with
[1:12:41] the Privileges of a son or daughter of
[1:12:43] God by natural birth and again I will
[1:12:46] say there are blessings that a child of
[1:12:49] a child of God can receive and I believe
[1:12:51] that there are many great Supernatural
[1:12:53] things that a child of God can claim for
[1:12:55] their children and there's power that is
[1:12:57] available to us as parents who are
[1:12:59] believers seal with the Holy Ghost but
[1:13:01] to our children or to those that might
[1:13:04] suppose that they can be somehow tangent
[1:13:07] related to the power of God because of
[1:13:09] natural birth God has no
[1:13:14] grandsons and God is not a
[1:13:17] grandpa but let me leave you with this
[1:13:20] as we will be closing on this thought I
[1:13:24] believe that there is is not a greater
[1:13:26] truth but a deeper
[1:13:28] truth because this new birth holds great
[1:13:31] significance to the nature of
[1:13:34] God why would Jesus say You must be born
[1:13:39] again and in the expressing of it
[1:13:41] Nicodemus I think is as I like to say
[1:13:44] he's picking up what Jesus is laying
[1:13:45] down he doesn't kind of make it kind of
[1:13:47] an analogy or he's not just making it
[1:13:49] you know oh I got to relate to this a
[1:13:51] different way immediately thinks how can
[1:13:52] I enter into my mother's womb and be
[1:13:54] born again cuz Jesus is conveying the
[1:13:56] thought of a rebirth a regeneration to
[1:13:59] come forth as a
[1:14:01] babe and God has set forth The Plan of
[1:14:05] Redemption from the beginning in such a
[1:14:07] way so that we could understand
[1:14:08] something about his nature even in the
[1:14:11] very beginning when God is unfolding
[1:14:13] creation and he arrives at the man and
[1:14:15] the man is now given a commandment to be
[1:14:16] fruitful multiply and replenish the
[1:14:18] earth and the woman comes forth from
[1:14:20] that man uh with the Testament and uh of
[1:14:23] to bring forth life and then the
[1:14:25] prohibition to not touch the tree of
[1:14:28] knowledge of Good and Evil that Satan
[1:14:30] must have known that the woman had
[1:14:32] something to do with bringing forth
[1:14:34] godlikeness and bringing forth the image
[1:14:36] of God so he attacked the woman and
[1:14:39] brother brandham says that when Satan
[1:14:41] worked forth uh set forth and did that
[1:14:44] which was necessary in the garden to
[1:14:46] fulfill the plan of God God all along
[1:14:49] has been allowing things to happen so
[1:14:51] that we can understand something about
[1:14:53] his nature because God wants to make
[1:14:56] himself known to us and in revealing
[1:14:58] himself to us he wants us to understand
[1:15:00] something about
[1:15:02] ourselves sometimes in life people begin
[1:15:05] to experience sicknesses and diseases or
[1:15:07] certain situations and they want to find
[1:15:10] out what's wrong and they find out maybe
[1:15:11] they were adopted or they had another
[1:15:13] parent uh that didn't raise them and
[1:15:15] they go to find them and hunt them down
[1:15:17] because maybe it may solve this medical
[1:15:19] mystery it might solve some sort of
[1:15:20] emotional problem they have by finding
[1:15:23] out who their parent is
[1:15:25] and so by God setting forth and telling
[1:15:27] us that there's to be a new birth and to
[1:15:30] be born from above it's telling us
[1:15:32] something about
[1:15:34] God this concept and idea of a birth has
[1:15:38] a rich Foundation from which that we we
[1:15:41] can get anchored in but then this
[1:15:43] purpose that it builds
[1:15:45] from we must understand the nature of
[1:15:48] God as a heavenly father not solely a
[1:15:53] human father
[1:15:56] but
[1:15:57] yet human relationships are a type just
[1:16:02] as there's a relationship of the
[1:16:03] bridegroom to the bride and it's
[1:16:05] understood between the love that a man
[1:16:07] would have for his wife and the the the
[1:16:09] respect that a wife would have for her
[1:16:10] husband and Paul admonishes the
[1:16:12] Believers in that regard he says
[1:16:14] husbands love your wives as Christ loves
[1:16:16] the church so the greater thought it's
[1:16:19] almost as if our marriages are an
[1:16:20] analogy and a type not the not the the
[1:16:24] truth we're the shadow of the real thing
[1:16:27] and so there can be something gained in
[1:16:30] understanding this
[1:16:31] Shadow there can be Lessons Learned in
[1:16:34] in seeing the symmetry of God's
[1:16:36] relationship to his bride or a man's
[1:16:39] relationship to his wife or God's
[1:16:40] relationship to his children but we must
[1:16:43] come to understand what it TR genuinely
[1:16:45] in its truth means in the Heavenly and
[1:16:48] that God has no
[1:16:50] grandchildren in 2 Corinthians 12:14
[1:16:53] Paul says behold the third time I'm
[1:16:54] ready to come to you and I will not be
[1:16:56] burdensome to you he had told him I am
[1:16:58] your father in The Gospel he says for I
[1:17:00] seek not yours and what you have and
[1:17:02] your possessions and your money but you
[1:17:04] I'm concerned about
[1:17:06] you your heart your spiritual well-being
[1:17:09] he says for the children ought not to
[1:17:11] lay up for the parents but the parents
[1:17:13] for the children what an incredible
[1:17:17] statement so parents responsibility over
[1:17:19] their CH children as they're reared and
[1:17:22] as they are are taught he he says the
[1:17:25] par the children aren't laying up and
[1:17:27] saving and looking out after and
[1:17:29] providing and giving their money and
[1:17:31] giving their time and laying it up for
[1:17:32] the parents but the parents gladly spend
[1:17:35] and are spent for the children the
[1:17:38] parents are giving they have
[1:17:39] responsibility over the
[1:17:41] children and Paul is saying this as a
[1:17:45] spiritual father to the
[1:17:47] Corinthians drawing on their experience
[1:17:50] in the flesh and how that uh the parents
[1:17:52] strive and they give and they yield
[1:17:54] thems they take their yield and they use
[1:17:56] it for the benefit of their children he
[1:17:57] says that's how that it ought to be not
[1:18:00] the other way
[1:18:02] around and then jesus takes this in Luke
[1:18:04] chap 11 says after he's even taught the
[1:18:07] disciples how to pray which begins with
[1:18:10] Our Father which art in
[1:18:13] heaven and ask for forgiveness and daily
[1:18:16] bread and drawing in a spiritual sense
[1:18:18] and even relating in the natural way our
[1:18:21] dependency and our looking to God as a
[1:18:23] father and in verse 9 it says I say unto
[1:18:26] you ask and it shall be given you seek
[1:18:28] and you shall find knock and it shall be
[1:18:30] opened unto you for everyone that
[1:18:34] askthe findeth and to him that knocketh
[1:18:38] shall be
[1:18:40] opened and then for Jesus to drive this
[1:18:43] thought home he comes to a natural
[1:18:47] relationship if a son shall ask bread of
[1:18:50] any of you that is a father will he give
[1:18:52] him a stone
[1:18:55] or if he ask a fish will he for a fish
[1:18:58] give him a serpent or if he shall ask an
[1:19:00] egg will he offer him a
[1:19:03] scorpion kind of a a a really
[1:19:07] interesting pattern to say that well
[1:19:11] when you ask for bread does the dad give
[1:19:12] you a stone you ask her fish does he
[1:19:14] give you a snake you ask for egg does he
[1:19:15] give you a scorpion and and the answer
[1:19:18] to each one of those rhetorically should
[1:19:20] be no no and even in the dramatic sense
[1:19:23] that Christ is expressing and he's
[1:19:25] saying in general the right way an
[1:19:26] upright father one that loves his
[1:19:28] children would not give evil when one
[1:19:30] has asked for a necessary thing or made
[1:19:33] the right request and so there something
[1:19:35] to be gained even in the way that Jesus
[1:19:36] is uh wording this it doesn't say if a
[1:19:39] man ask his dad for a Lamborghini does
[1:19:41] he get a you know a cruise you know does
[1:19:44] he get a fort Pinto um what does he get
[1:19:47] and so he doesn't he's kind of shown in
[1:19:49] in there some sort of reason here and
[1:19:51] and this uh the way that he's phrasing
[1:19:53] it I think is for reason he says if ye
[1:19:56] then be an
[1:19:57] evil human subject to passions weak
[1:20:03] infirm complexes know how to give good
[1:20:07] gifts into your children how much more
[1:20:11] shall your heavenly father give the Holy
[1:20:13] Spirit to them that ask
[1:20:15] him and that's what I I want to end on
[1:20:17] is this thoughts thought if a a dad or a
[1:20:20] mom has a heart for their children and
[1:20:24] would do good things to their children
[1:20:26] and should have this vision for their
[1:20:29] child and should have a a desire to
[1:20:32] provide for them and to uh to give to
[1:20:34] them and to lay up for them and that a
[1:20:37] good man is not only looking out after
[1:20:39] his children in responsible way to
[1:20:41] enrich their lives but he does so in a
[1:20:43] manner which impacts and benefits his
[1:20:45] grandchildren's life if the Bible is
[1:20:48] instructing that Widow who has children
[1:20:50] and grandchildren to benefit from their
[1:20:53] piety and their very requie and in their
[1:20:55] love then it says something about how
[1:20:57] that we as natural people even without
[1:21:00] Christ look out after our children
[1:21:02] instinctively and give them good things
[1:21:04] and raise them in a way that we can even
[1:21:06] benefit later on as grandchildren or
[1:21:10] grandparents he says how much
[1:21:13] more how much more your heavenly father
[1:21:17] and all parental
[1:21:20] aspects and I say therein lies the
[1:21:23] secret as to why God is not a
[1:21:27] grandpa and God has no
[1:21:30] grandsons because how much more your
[1:21:33] heavenly
[1:21:34] father that means he has a very specific
[1:21:38] Vision he H has something that's very
[1:21:41] pre it's precise for his children and
[1:21:43] his involvement transcends anything that
[1:21:46] we would know in general about a
[1:21:49] relationship of a grandparent to a
[1:21:52] grandchild
[1:21:55] amen could you stand with me tonight as
[1:21:56] we
[1:21:58] pray God is not a
[1:22:02] grandpa I was telling my children
[1:22:04] recently I think it
[1:22:06] was Jack or one of them said that
[1:22:09] brother John my dear friend my
[1:22:12] father-in-law and friend he said said
[1:22:14] that he was the best grandpa in the
[1:22:16] world and I looked at him said your days
[1:22:19] are
[1:22:20] numbered CU one day when they have
[1:22:23] kids beleving that I'll assume the title
[1:22:27] is the greatest grandfather in the
[1:22:30] world but I could say that my children
[1:22:33] are blessed with the best
[1:22:36] grandpa that one could ask for because
[1:22:38] of the heart he has for the Lord the
[1:22:40] genuine nature that he has to see you
[1:22:44] succeed but even in that even in that
[1:22:47] this truth how much more your heavenly
[1:22:50] father to know to know that God is more
[1:22:53] personal more intimate more
[1:22:55] involved yes I give you a little bit of
[1:22:57] a sneak peek there's a lot of things
[1:22:58] that we say about grandchildren we say
[1:23:00] they are a reward for surviving your own
[1:23:04] children they're a reward for keeping
[1:23:06] your children alive but many of them
[1:23:08] Express the thought and the idea that
[1:23:11] there is a difference that we have the
[1:23:13] relationship
[1:23:15] between a grandchild and a grandparent
[1:23:18] and God doesn't know what that's
[1:23:20] like and it's for a reason just pray for
[1:23:23] us as we will continue Sunday morning
[1:23:25] Lord willing and go deeper into this
[1:23:26] truth let's bow our heads in prayer
[1:23:29] gracious Heavenly Father tonight Lord as
[1:23:30] we have been able to I believe
[1:23:33] thoroughly
[1:23:34] cover a very simple subject in just a
[1:23:37] short period of
[1:23:40] time through the benefit of your
[1:23:42] scripture Lord which just covers it so
[1:23:44] beautifully Lord myself having been
[1:23:46] instructed by the messenger of the hour
[1:23:48] and just pouring over the things that he
[1:23:50] had to say about it even being a student
[1:23:52] of what he taught on the new birth Lord
[1:23:54] Lord and God's desire for us to mature
[1:23:57] and to grow Lord I'm just filled with so
[1:23:58] much inspiration on this
[1:24:00] subject and Lord I've chosen and just
[1:24:03] felt impressed to use a title that kind
[1:24:04] of catches our attention that God has no
[1:24:09] grandchildren because Lord I I I I feel
[1:24:13] that it's so important today to
[1:24:15] emphasize two great
[1:24:17] truths that we must be born
[1:24:20] again that we're to be babies in Christ
[1:24:24] that we're to begin to desire the
[1:24:26] sincere milk of your word but then also
[1:24:29] Lord that we must
[1:24:31] grow we must grow we cannot remain
[1:24:35] children
[1:24:37] forever and Lord There's Something About
[1:24:40] That season of life when one begins to
[1:24:42] look forward to grandchildren
[1:24:44] and whether it be as a parent to with
[1:24:48] children starts to look forward to the
[1:24:49] time when they can assume a different
[1:24:52] role or even when
[1:24:55] the grandparent now anticipation with
[1:24:57] the oncoming baby looks forward to that
[1:24:59] moment and that time when grandchildren
[1:25:02] enter their life Lord It's it speaks of
[1:25:05] a
[1:25:08] season Lord where even as one writer put
[1:25:11] it that the
[1:25:13] responsibilities and the obligations are
[1:25:16] just enough removed so that real genuine
[1:25:19] friendship is
[1:25:22] possible but Lord
[1:25:25] your desire for us is not to remain in
[1:25:28] the cuddle stage in the toddler
[1:25:32] stage in that stage where many parents
[1:25:35] love holding their babies and don't ever
[1:25:37] want them to grow
[1:25:38] up that stage where grandparents enjoy
[1:25:41] those they can just really get a kick
[1:25:44] out of the terrible twos and the
[1:25:46] nonsensical language and the cute little
[1:25:48] things that are done without the
[1:25:49] frustrations of it happening on a daily
[1:25:52] basis or the lack of obedience Lord in
[1:25:55] that season where maybe some
[1:25:57] grandparents like oh I hope they never
[1:25:59] grow up you've never had that thought
[1:26:02] Lord you've never had that thought Lord
[1:26:06] you can appreciate when we're green and
[1:26:08] we dance and the spirit and the wind
[1:26:10] moves and we can move with your spirit
[1:26:12] and but yet Lord you desire that we grow
[1:26:14] up to be a fruitful tree and ourselves
[1:26:15] bring forth fruit is not your desire
[1:26:18] Lord that we grow old and lose our
[1:26:20] leaves and groan and Quake and uh and
[1:26:24] shutter when the wind is breezing
[1:26:26] through the young saplings Lord you
[1:26:27] don't want us to end up like that but
[1:26:29] Lord you don't want us to be green
[1:26:30] forever you want us to grow up and Lord
[1:26:34] I believe that is at the
[1:26:37] heart of why you have no
[1:26:40] grandsons and I thank God that you're no
[1:26:42] grandpa thank you Lord so I yield myself
[1:26:45] to you Lord as son thanes do with me as
[1:26:48] you see fit as my Godly parent my
[1:26:50] heavenly father we love you Lord we
[1:26:53] commit ourselves to to you now we just
[1:26:55] pray your blessing upon your people as
[1:26:58] they worship you Lord as our hearts
[1:27:00] remain fixed upon you in the name
