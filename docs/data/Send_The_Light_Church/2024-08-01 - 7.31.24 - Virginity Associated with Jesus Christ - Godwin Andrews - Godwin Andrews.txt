just want to say get be the word because the word is what changes us amen it's not how it's delivered right we don't got to run from this side to this side it's the word that changes us not the delivery of the word but the word amen so we just want to welcome our brother to come and give us the bread of life oh believe only [Music] all things are possible only [Music] shall we turn to our Bible Ephesians chap 5 beginning with verse 25 to the end of the chapter verse 33 Ephesians chap 5 beginning with verse 25 five husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word amen that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having a spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loves his wife loves himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes even as the Lord God the church for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife and they two shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his holy word amen shall we bow our heads in prayer our gracious loving Heavenly Father this is our privilege that you have enabled us to gather together in the name of Jesus Christ to worship you and to ponder over your words which are a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our part and father we pray that you will help us as David said in Psalm 119 verse 11 that I have hid your word in my heart that I sin not against thee father we pray this evening that you will help us that we may hide your word in our hearts that we walk a life which is worthy in your sight for we know that our life on this Earth is coming to an end pretty soon and Lord your coming is very near so we want to lead a life which is holy and perfect and biblical in your sight Lord that through our Lives Many people who have not known this truth who are walking in darkness amen may know the name of Jesus and come to the light and receive the life Everlasting amen Jesus we commit each one of us into your hands we pray that you will sanctify every heart and prepare our heart to receive your word word in Jesus name we pray amen you may be seated I de it a great privilege for me to be able to come to this fellowship and the body of Christ which is a part of the body which is bur over and I'm very certain that the Lord has given me a good health even at the age of 87 and Lord has enabled me to travel to various places in my own country and I have preached the word practically all of India and we have many congregations in different states that are functioning under uh 45 Pastors in a state called Andra Pradesh which is part of central India and we have nearly 200 churches in that particular State uh and in other parts of India we have uh here and there and in the city of Kolkata of course I'm very sorry that I have been there in that City for for a long time I came to Kolkata in 1969 and as a pastor and district superintendent of the Methodist Church at that time I did not know the message but the message came to me in 1974 and I was given this s churches book by a minister from the salvation Army he believed the message but because of circumstances and difficulties faced by the financial difficulties faced by the ministers he still stuck to the Salvation Army because in a denomination you have the guarantee of your salary but when you are not in a denomination there is no guarantee so anyway he gave me the book and that convinced me and I started preaching the same message in the Methodist Church and people were very disturbed because since 1969 until 74 everything was peaceful but since I started preaching the message uh the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ godhead and all that people started writing letters against me to the bishop and Bishop wouldn't say anything but Bishop was not present in Kolkata the whole of India was divided as regards the Methodist Church was concerned in four divisions and our division was the Eastern Division and the headquarter of the bishop was about uh 600 miles away from Kolkata so once in a blue moon he would come to Kolkata so when he came to Kolkata he showed me the letters which were written by my congregation people and he said these are your love letters read them so I read them and I felt that it is people are not to be blamed because it is their ignorance they don't know the scure and we should teach them the Bible so our service would begin at 10:00 in the morning I Chang it to 9:00 I said from 9 to 10:30 we will have the church service regular church service and from 10:30 we will have a Bible study class every Sunday up to to 12:00 midday and people were very excited that this was something new which was being started in the church never done before so I said you cannot me when I'm on the ppit you have to listen to me but when I'm across the table you can ask me any question you want to and I will give you the answer from the Bible that way people were satisfied that my steps were correct and I was taking this stand on the Bible not on the denominational Constitution and all that the denominational Constitution says you have to bapti children but the Bible doesm bapti children so I sto baptism and that was one reason people were angry that he has sto the child baptism so I told Bishop you are bishop and you know more Bible than I do and I would like you to show me at least one verse in the Bible supports the child baptism and he so he realized he was on a wrong foot so he said well you are a minister you know how to control your congregation I it to you so whatever you think is right do it I'm not against you that the bishop me permission toe whatever IED to pre and then things subsided and because of the Bible study after 2 years nearly 12 people got ready to be baptized in the name of the Lord and it was July 7th 1978 when we were baptized in the name of the Lord and I was the first one then my wife followed and the other members and five others stood up right there when the baptism ceremony was going on they said we also would like to be baptized so in a lot 17 were baptized all together Lord and this was by a pastor from New Zealand maybe I don't know whether you know brother Regional sh from New Zealand he was an old man and in 1978 when he came to Kolkata he said his age was 72 years old at that time so in 78 and his wife was also there so he was ministering somewhere in nor and the Holy Spirit spoke to him and him go to Kata anded times he said ibody inata he hearkened to the voice of the Lord and he decided to change his Ro from way to New Zealand he came Kata he came to Kata and he looked for me because in one of his diary he had my name I had written him one letter once only because of the track which he had written what baptized so I had acknowledged and told him that I agree with your teaching and I'm quite satisf what you have written in this pamphlet so that way he had my address in his diary so he wrote me a letter from Norway that this thing has happened with me the holy spirit is telling to go to Kata but I don't know why I should go to Kata but I'm coming to Kata and I'm coming by such and suche I will do my all hotel bookings you don't worry about that but I will be there for 3 days and so we received him and at the airport and uh we hired a taxi to come to the city it's about 10 mil away from the city the airport so in a taxi he still says I have come but I don't know why I have come then I told him the whole story how people are ready for baptism in the name of the Lord and we didn't know whom to call because I not known to any end time believer so we were praying Lord s somebody and you are the answer to our prayers amen so he was very happy we arranged some meetings for him for 3 days and on the third day we had requested a Baptist Church to Lear their baptistry because in the meist church we didn't have the provision for immersion baptism so that Pastor of course there is a long story for that also how he with great difficulty agreed because I had shared that pamphlet of brother sh to him also he was sitting in his porch and I was there request him to give his Baptist so I just handed over that track to and when he saw that I giving a track on baptism to a Baptist minister so he laughed and he said thank you very I said taking his name he was a doctor of theology reti reg of the University of theological college and I took his name I said Dr if you go through this track a genuine than you will come out of your m not a sarcastic way of thank you as you have he said is it so I said yes I'm going to it now said go ahead sit here he through and he just reved how can this be this is talking only in Jesus name he is avoiding the father avoiding the Holy Ghost how can we avoid it I said he not avoiding anybody he including the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost the name is one that is Jesus Christ anyway he wouldn't agree with the track but he said you write an application give me to to the committee I will present it and if the committee agrees then you will get the baptistry so while writing the application I said if I write that we are going to be baptized according to acts 238 they may not give us so I said Lord what should I write in this application so I wrote you will bead to know because they are happy with the immersion baptism the Methodist CH doesn't do that so if you do an emotion baptism they are happy because it is something like their baptism they did not know the difference between acts 238 and Matthew 2819 so I wrote in the application you will be glad to know that certain Methodist people have decided to be baptized according to the scripture that way they could not catch what we intended to do so they considered the application and they said all right we will give you the baptistry and so the baptistry was very nice you know uh they had the old baptistry right here in front of the pulpit but they had made a new baptistry which was in the wall over here so the whole congregation could see the whole process of going how the baptism is taking place right here on the top so while sated everybody could see and hear what the question is being asked from the candidate and what answer he is giving so that way our baptism took place on 7th July 1978 and theref until I left the Methodist Church in 82 nearly 80 people were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Lord continued to bless me and of course after I left the Methodist Church I had to leave my Bungalow and every facility that was given by the Methodist Church and I didn't have a place to go so some brother who was a faith brother so he helped me to get a place which is also still a Methodist property but it was under his control so he gave me Methodist CH was again angry that I occupied their property so I said you have not given me this property it has come to me from second so anyway that is a different matter but uh I got rid of the Methodist Church in July June of 1982 and ever since the Lord has been very gracious to me to uh help me to preach the word of God in different parts of India Punjab and in South India Punjab is the west and Kata happens to be the eastern part of India so many congregations have been established and the people are growing in the Lord but at the same time as we know that the coming of the Lord is very near I'm going to share this evening a very different subject which you may not have heard before and the subject is virginity virginity you understand what virgin means virgin is undefiled by human beings how virginity is associated with the life of Jesus Christ amen how virginity is associated with the life of Jesus Christ and how virginity is associated with your life that will be the final thing because as we have read this scure in Ephesians 5 here the the illustration of the husband and wife is a type of the church and Christ yes and therefore the relationship has to be maintained that we become one with each other if you consider the whole Bible if we take the whole Bible in account what could be the central theme of the entire Bible if if we look at from Genesis to revelation there is a problem in the book of Genesis and that problem runs through the whole Bible and solution is found in the New Testament and through that solution we have come to this stage now we are going to see what was the problem the problem was of relationship amen relationship if you read Genesis chap 3 and verse 8 Genesis 3 verse 8 says and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the G Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God Among the Trees of the garden now this verse tells us that God used to have fellowship with man amen that was the sole purpose of the creation of man he had his angels with him even before the Man was created but he created in his Ownage to have fellow with that was the purpose of the but something happened and the sin entered their life we know the story how the sin enter their life and the relationship was broken the relationship was broken and they could not God could not have fellowship with a sinful man because God is Holy and he wants our lives to be holy then only we can have fellowship with God and Adam and Eve had sin in their life so they were asked to leave the place get out of the of Ed and it appears the very purpose for which Man was created is lost was The Fellowship God is Not defeated God has his mind prepared from the even before the foundation of the world how he is going to save the Lost Humanity amen and that is the story that runs throughout the Bible in the Gospel of John Chapter 2 we we find the first miracle that Jesus performed in the can of Galilee that is turning the water into wine we we all know the story very well and how this happened this was a place of marriage and it appears the poost was very popular and let us imagine that he invited 100 people but 150 came so Arrangement is for 100 and 150 people have turned up so naturally the wi is going to be was over but this was aity and shame what of an arrangement made which important part of the marriage is over so if everybody comes to know they will laugh at him at him so it was a matter of prestige for him but luckily Jesus was there and his mother was there and so she said they have no wine and we know what Jesus did she told theant do what he says so there were six jars of water pots containing about 27 Gall each such a bigus told them to fill the jars with water and they filled it up to the brim and now Jesus tells take it to the marri Govern of theast the Govern tasted that which had into wine he said to The Host to the bridegroom everyone gives bestality in the beginning and have drunk then which is of lower quality but you have kept the bestality Until the End am you have kept the best quality until the end now this speaks of the message of the hour amen the message of the hour has been given in every age God has given the message to that particular age what was required the best was kept for your age amen and God has given us the best of the wine that we have drunk in this age am but I'm going to take the illustration of the six jars I'm speaking on the relationship you know and the relation has to be restored now this is the AG of restoration all lose ends have to be brought in Perfection am and restoration so God had a means of restoring that lost Fellowship which was in the Garden of Eden how is he going to do it different ways now these pictures or these vessels which were laid there in which the water was filled they represent the six means of purification is mentioned there these jars kept according to the man of purification of the juice and these jars represents the six ways of God's relationship with the Lost Humanity he didn't want to lose them he had them for his fellow so first thing that he gave to Moses on SI the two taets of stones and each Stone had five Commandments on each five Commandments on each taet and it was nearly 40 days when Moses was on the mountain and down in the valley people said what happened to the man who brought us out of the land of egyp he appears to have died because 40 days have passed and he not yet to return so they built a CF of gold and started dancing and saying this is our leader who brought us out of the land of Egypt and he lead us now God says to Moses go down and see what is happening in the valley and when Moses comes he sees what is happening and he very angry he thre those two taet of stones with the 10 commandments and that taets were broken and the fire came out of it and and consumed everything they who were dancing they were all dead now when Moses returns back to the mountain again to the Lord he said bring me two taet of stones again and he brings two taets of a stone and God again writes five on this one five on this one because this Commandments is the G of the whole Bible the Commandments is the G of the Bible how it talks right relationship the first four Commandments your right relationship with God this is vertical from fifth to the 10th is horizontal man to man that makes the cross you see that your right relationship with God first four Commandments you know all the Commandments not repeat it so the first four Commandments deal with your relationship with God vertical and fifth to the 10th to should have a right relationship because it is a of relationship that has to be restored so the 10 commandments were given to restore back the relationship that also people did not care so he appoints priests priests now the priest were in between the congregation and and God the priest were s of link to the congregation to represented congregation to God and God to the congregation I'm going very fast because it will take long time you know I'm going very fast so this was another link that kept the relationship God and man together through the priest that also did not work the Third comes then he appointed the judges the judges were a link between God and the congregation you see they were all Anointed with the oil they were all Anointed with the Holy Spirit you know they were chosen people of God to be a link between the congregation and God so the third thing first we found the 10 commandments second the priest third the judges fourth comes the uh Kings after the judges is the Kings now when the Israelites were settled in land of Canan found different communities different communities and they had all Kings the Amit and thees Andes and all that they had owns but they that they don't have KS so they asked Samuel we want a king like other people have KS we also want to have a King Samuel was very angry you read that in the 1 Samuel 7 and 8 and the Lord said to Samuel so we know the story how was uh selected to be the first king of Israel so he becomes the fourth link then that also did not work then the fifth link is through the poal books five books you have been your Bible beginning with the Book of Job Psalms Proverbs Ecclesiastes and the Song of Solomon these are five books in your Bible which have the wisdom literature so through the wisdom literature you are advised how the relationship should be maintained in a cordial manner between God and man now the thing this also did not work comes the prophets the sixth J represents the prophets and they were also the sanctified people filled with the Holy Ghost and spoke in the guidance of the spirit of the Lord now we have 17 of them in our Bible beginning with Isaiah to Malachi but this is also divided in two parts Major Prophets and the Minor Prophets The Major Prophets are five Isaiah Jeremiah lamentation eel and Daniel these are the five Maj prophets and beginning with Hosea to Malachi we have 12 Minor Prophets but these are the six jars of communication a link between the Lost humanity and God you see this this is how it runs we know the story how brother also us that there are certain numers in the B their own significance number six number three number you find number s manytimes in the Book of Revelation and we have in the book of Kings also in the book of Samuel also and many books have the set of Sev so seven is a number of completion the six is a number for man because Man was created on the sixth day so number six is an incomplete number amen and this marriage host had only six jars but there needs to be a seventh one also and here is the seventh one the seventh one is Jesus Christ himself look from him Comes This ordinary water which is being filled in these six jars turning into the best quality of wine any man no matter how sinful he might be if he comes in contact with Jesus is going to turn into the best quality person that is the message of the hour today amen that is why God our Lord needs a virgin bride that is why we are considering virginity virginity virginity and we are seeing how virginity is associated with Jesus first of all we find that Jesus was born of a virgin Bo Isaiah 7 verse 14 says that therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel so the birth of Jesus was a virgin birth amen no human being has ever born of a virgin birth except Jesus so he is the first to be born of a virgin womb then second thing we find where did he come from he come from a place where no human has ever reached he's talking to Nicodemus in 3 and know that Nicodemus ACC tose 1 John 3 verse 1 he was the ruler and political leader of the Jewish Community he was a leader so why did he come in the night to Jesus he should have come in the daytime but he scared of his position he doesn't want to be exposed to people that people will think otherwise why this fellow is going to this Jesus who is not of us and he is a mean he not a good why this fellow is going and meting him soodus knew that he was from God so he comes and Praises him and says Lord we know that you are from God because no no can do all these Miracles which you are doing now the Bible say in 1 Corinthians 1 verse 22 why did Nicodemus Talk of the miracles of Jesus you see this is the speciality of the Jews for the Jews require a and the Greeks seek after wisdom now this is the characteris of the Greeks and the Jews Jews are interested only in the signs show us a sign sign theyed sign and Jesus said the evil and this generation which is evil seeks a sign but no no sign will be given except the of Jonas as Jonas was three days and three nights in the heart of the belly of the veale so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth sign they were seeking sign they were only interested in sign but what has the sign to do with your life how it is going to save you signs were there many miracles Jesus performed but the Miracles did not have life it was only help for the physical bodying the sck or raising the dead healing the blind and death and all that all kinds of human ailments they were only a means of attraction to Jesus Christ now through the Miracles Jesus attracted the attention of the people and when they gathered he gave them the message of the hour what was the message of the hour the kingdom of God how can you be the part of the kingdom of God right amen and that is exactly what the whole Bible is teaching about how man can be restored back to the kingdom of God and that is the goal before us we want to be the part of the kingdom of God and so are many Christians trying to reach the kingdom of God but how will you reach without being a virgin you cannot you have to be a virgin you have to be a virgin because Jesus is associated with Virgin virginity now we are going to see seven points of virginity which is associated with Jesus so first we found that his birth was from the virgin boom amen secondly talking to Nicodemus in the 13th verse of John 313 it says no man ever ascended to Heaven except he who came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven you see man has not been able to defile even heaven heaven is pure I come from that pure place so Heaven is a virgin place where we all want to go to heaven amen and if we are Unholy we cannot go to heaven now there is a which I would like to share with you in Psalm 94 verse 20 and it's says shall the Throne of iniquity have fellowship with you there is a question shall theone of iniquity have fellow with you which frames Mischief by a law the answer is no God cannot have fellowship with iniquity that's God cannot have fellowship with sin God is Holy and he tells Moses in Leviticus 19 1 ver 1 and 2 if I read that it says here and the Lord spoke to Moses saying speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel and say to them ye shall be holy for the Lord your God am Holy the holy God cannot have fellowship with Unholy one if you want to have fellowship with God you have to be holy and this Heaven is Virgin the tomb was virgin and now the ministry of Jesus Christ the ministry is a virgin Ministry no man on the face of this Earth has done the things that Lord Jesus Christ has done amen be it Islam be it Hinduism it any Rel religion which is found on the face of this Earth no one has ever done such things now we have two witnesses about this ministry first is the the witness of Jesus Christ himself he says in Psalm John 15 verse 23 and 24 Jesus answered and said to him if man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come to him and make our AB with him verse 24 he that loves me he that loves me not keeps not my saying and the word which you hear is not mine but the father's which sent me that is 14 I misre it chapter 15 verse 24 yes if I had not done among them The Works which no other man did now these are the of Jesus himself if I had not done among them The Works which no other man did they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father right amen this is the testimony of Jesus himself he's talking about now you know the Pharisees and the rulers of the society the high priest and all that they did not like Jesus they wanted to kill him so they sent some SE and some leaders to catch hold of him and bring him to the office we find that in the seven chapter joh how these people are to catch of him and here in the sth chapter of John we find that verse 37 we will read and see in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man TR thirst let him come to me and drink he that believes on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this spoke he of the spirit which they had that believe on him should receive but the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified now here the preaching of Jesus is going on and the officers have sent the men to catch hold of Jesus and bring him and verse 46 let us leave all the rest and read 46 the officers answered never man speak like this man now this is the testimony of the soldiers who sent to catch of him they have not C hold of him they returned empty and the priest ising why did not him what the you have arrested him him now this is the answer they never a man like this man no human being has ever spoken like what he spoken hising witness andr theyr him they have return empty offic spoken this we areed you will read it that they are angry with them and say you areed haveed have the Pharisees also believed on him and so many questions are there so the ministry of Jesus is a virin Ministry no one on the face of this Earth has done those things Jesus has done now number four the ministry is over now it is a time for him to be taken into custody and put to death so as it is mentioned in the book of Old Testament we have the prophecy of Jesus riding a c so he riding a c and we read in the Gospel of Mark 11 verse 2 and when they came near to Jerusalem to be and Bean at the Mount of Olives he sends forth two of his disciples and says to them go your way into the village opposite you and as soon as you be entered into it you shall find a cold tide where on never man sat you see over on never man sat lose him and bring him am a virgin cult was not defiled I'll go little because time is running out and now we come to the death of Jesus Christ now the death of Jesus Christ is a virgin death no man on the face of this Earth has died for others except Jesus Christ am no man has ever given his life for the sake of others but Jesus Jus died for all you see in the book of Timothy we read let me find out in the book of Timothy chapter 2 verse 3 1 Timothy 2:3 for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior who will have all men to be saved now here it is mention that it is his will that all should be saved but are all men going to be saved no but he his will is that all should be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth for there is one God and one mediator between God and the man Christ Jesus in the fourth chapter we find that he is the savior of the whole world world I'm not able to find it now but it is in the four chapter somewh that he is not only the savior of the ones who are saved but he the savior of the whole world his sacrifice is for all but only those who believe on him shall be saved not all and Jesus came only for his own if you read Matthew 1 verse 21 it is written there that Joseph was not willing to bring Mary his wife because she was with a child and the angel of the Lord appears to him in the dream and says Joseph don't be angry with yourself now this whatever is in the womb of Mary is from the Holy Ghost she is going to Bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus for he shall save now this is important which nobody notices and all the churches who read this verse never give Credence and thought to this verse what is written there and he shall save his people not all people he shall save his people from their sins amen so Jesus comes for his own people amen and you are one of them amen you have to be virgin then only you are going to have fellowship with him now we found the fifth thing that his death was a virgin and how it was a virgin that let me see we find in the gospel of Mark 10 verse 45 Jesus giving the definition of his own life why did he come on this Earth he says in the 1045 Mark 10:45 for even the son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many no one has given his life for many Jesus says I have come for that purpose so in this way the ministry and the death of Jesus Christ is a virgin death I have written several verses over here but I'm not going to read all these Romans chap 5: 6 to 10 you can write and 10th chapter 6 to13 we'll deal with this uh portion of the Virgin death of Jesus Christ now let us take number six Jesus Is Dead Ain death now he is going to be placed in a tomb and that tomb has to be a virgin tomb amen Luke 23: 53 Luke 23 verse 23 53 Luke 23: 53 and he took it down and wrapped it in a linen and laid it in a Seer that was H in stone where in never man before was laid Amen in this tomb no man was ever laid am this was a virgin tomb now number seven comes his resurrection his resurrection is a virgin Resurrection how can you prove it let us see Matthew chap 27 Matthew chap 7 2752 53 Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up The Ghost and behold the veale of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent and the grapes were opened now notice here and the grapes were opened and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose arose and came out of the graves when after his resurrection am not before after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many you see when he gave up the ghost on the cross the graves were opened and they became alive but they did not come out of the graves until Jesus came out of the Grave so he became the first born Romans chapter 8 let us see Romans chapter 8 verse 29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren yes he is the first born he the first one in Resurrection amen so his resurrection is a virgin Resurrection all these seven things brothers and sisters relate how the life of Jesus was associated with virginity now comes the last he coming to receive a bride and that bride has to be a virgin bride unless you are virgin how can you be virgin be found in him let the spirit of God lead you this evening we were sitting in the uh men's meeting and we found that uh the things many things that we are claiming to be Christians denominations are also claiming to be Christians how are we them but we are we know that we are a Baptist also says he a Christian a Methodist also says he a Christian a Pentecostal also says he a Christian difference difference must know who the what the difference is and the difference is that you should know that position is a very special position and that is found in First Peter chapter 2 verse but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peul people that you should show forth his Praises of him who has called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light right brothers and sisters this message has done great things for us and this Bible which is a closed book to the denominations amen and this evening I was telling there are two words in Greek regarding this Bible everybody reads this Methodist also read it Pentecostals also read it the Roman Catholics also are now allowed to read it but do they get what is written in it no so this Bible is a Remar to them it is just like any ordinary book like you can read any book and so you read Bible also like way because you don't get out of it what it says but what did Jesus say to his disciples you remember he always preached the kingdom of God but according to Matthew 13 verse 34 and 35 let us see what uh the Bible says about the ministry of Jesus Christ how he did it Matthew 13: 3435 all these things spake Jesus to multitude in Parables and without a parable speak he not to them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came to him saying declare us the parable of the tears of the field and he explained to them now he has spoken only in Parables why why did he speak in Parables if you read verse 16 of this chapter it says but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for the here for verily I say to you that many prophets and righteous have desired to see these things which you see and have not seen them and to hear these things which you hear have not heard them here therefore the parable of the now if you see the Book of Revelation 2 and 3 every one of you know these are the seven letters to the seven Church ages and in the end of every letter it is written let him hear who has the ears to hear yes and Jesus calls his disciples blessed are your ears that they can hear and blessed are your your eyes that can see you remember the eyesight of David it was that with one stone he killed the he was CED all over only this and the first stone that he hising out of theing it went andit his head and gol was down he had a sharp he had a sharp eye and the same David says open thou eyes that I may behold the wondrous things out OFW Psalm 119 verse 11 he is praying to open his eyes not these eyes but the eyes of the heart the eyes of your heart must be open and if the eyes of your heart are open brothers and sister you will see great things hidden in this Bible and verse 105 says Psalm 119 verse 105 your word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my PA and I have hid your word in my heart that I sin not against you you have to become a virgin bride because Jesus is coming to receive you very soon unless you are a bride he not going to take you home virginity is associated with Jesus Christ so virginity must be associated with your life yes God bless you God bless [Applause] you praise the Lord thank you thank you brother that was such a rich
