doors of your house being opened again once again Lord and father we just come with such great Thanksgiving and gratitude Lord towards you that you'd want to meet us here Lord I pray you just take this little word that you placed in My Heart Lord and you just speak it to your people Lord may you Lord just have your perfect way maybe you have your preeminence Lord we give you Lord the control Lord just let your perfect will be done and we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen let's turn to Hebrews 10 uh chapter 10 read verses 19 through 25 and then I'll have you be seated so Hebrews chapter 10. verses 19 through 25. very familiar scriptures we just definitely encountered an honor and a privilege to be here and letting brother John just giving us opportunity to be here and um we'll start verse 19. having therefore Brethren boldness tender to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus verse 20 by a New and Living Way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God verse 22 let us draw near with a true heart and full Assurance of faith having a heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise and that is considered one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as a manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much to more as you see the day approaching you may be seated so the little title of this uh sermon is engulf me so something we want the Lord to be able to do is engulf our life we can get engulfed in so other things so many other things but the main thing we need to be engulfed in is the Lord and so let's go to verse verse 20. so it says by a newly Living Way which he hath consecrated so I looked the word up consecrated means separated for a common to Sacred use devoted or dedicated to the service and worship of God so you have to dedicate and devote yourself to God every day because his mercies are new each day each day is a brand new day you can't write the coattails of yesterday or last week but you got to dedicate and as soon as you get up in the morning you got to dedicate yourself because it the Devils this is real is God and he wants to come and Sidetrack you he wants to come and stop you destroy you any way he can and so we got to recognize that we have an enemy and we have to fight the enemy the right way which is dedicate yourself to God and so verse 22 it gives you the word Assurance so we'll read that let us draw near with a true heart and full Assurance of Faith so notice that word Assurance means the act of assuring or making a declaration in terms that furnace ground of confidence as I trusted to his insurances or the act of Furnishing any ground of full confidence so you got to have full assurance that God is going to answer that need in your life full assurance that God is who we say he is and so that Assurance has to be coupled with faith it has to be together because you can't have faith if you're wavering so you gotta have full assurance that God is going to move in the exact need that you need him to move in but first just seek him first and then let him fulfill that need and they'll go to verse 23 it says profession so profession is an open declaration a public a vow or acknowledgment of one's sentiments or belief as professions of friendship or sincerity a profession of Faith or religion so you could have profession that Jesus is your high priest so you gotta not just somebody else's high priest but he's your high priest personally and he knows how you feel he knows the thoughts that you go through and you got to believe that with all your heart now look the word up in golf says to flow over and enclose to surround and cover something or someone completely just like a body of water and it surrounds everything and ghosts everything and that's how Jesus needs to be in our life but you have to give him the okay the go-ahead to be able to do that he's a gentleman it's like in Revelations 3 it says he knocks at the door and he's waiting for the believer to let him in and so so in order for something to engulf your life you have to give a permission it could be issues in life problems in life whatever it is but you have to first give it permission to engulf your life so let's go to James chapter 4. amen so you must see in order to something engulf your life you must make it a priority in your thoughts see it all starts in your thoughts whatever you're thinking about the most is going to be what you're going to become so if you're if you have bad thoughts negative thoughts if you keep feeding on those things you're eventually going to slowly start becoming those things so go to James 4 and we'll read chapter verses seven through eight very familiar scriptures so it says submit yourself therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you so for having negative thoughts the devil is bombarding us the first thing we need to do is to what does it say submit yourselves therefore to God that's the key that's the math equation you want to say that's the formula if you want to have over if you want to overcome anything the devil's throwing at you you first have to submit yourself therefore to God and then it says resist the devil and he will flee from you so God so the devil has to flee in the presence of God every time we saw when Jesus met with Legion they bowed down and say why do you come to torment me before my time so anytime you get in the presence of God every devil has to Bow before you because it's the god it's God not because it's you but because it's God and so go to verse uh seven or verse 8 and it says draw an eye to God and He will draw an eye to you see God has hidden Simplicity he doesn't make it hard but he says if you're really drawing nine to him then he has to draw knights in you because his word declares that and God is not a man that will lie so I think a lot of times we make it so hard but yet God is hid in Simplicity God wants to make it so easy for us but you have to make the choice by three more agency to draw an eye to him and the quicker you can draw an eye to him the quicker you will forget about all those negative thoughts all those problems in your life because you'd be focused on him you got to get in that Channel with him amen so draw an eye to God and He will draw an eye to then it says we have a part to play cleanse your hands you Sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded so you can't come to God with uh with unbelief without you got to believe that God if God says that right there then he is going to draw an eye to you so we can't have a double mind in anything anything you're asking of God it says in Hebrews 11 you got to believe that who God is and you can't be wavering you got to ask in faith so then we'll go to Romans 6. Romans 6 chapter 6. 6 verse 6. and so the more you seek God the more he has preeminence in your life and the more he has Primus in your life the more he can engulf your life the more you won't be thinking about yourself but you'll be thinking about others and and that's the key what God wants us to think about others because what was the Holy Ghost given for to what anybody all right it was continuing the works that Christ could not do at that time because you and I weren't here and Christ wants to use you to win lost souls to to find the ones whose names are written in the palm of his hands and so we got to be we don't know who those people are so that's why we got to be a servant to everyone Paul said I became all things to all men that I might what win some so Paul knew he wouldn't win everybody but he knew he would win some amen so we'll go to Romans 6 and we'll read verses 6 through 23. amen verse six knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin so Jesus Christ gave us a way that we don't have to serve sin anymore we don't have to be bombarded we don't have to be Shackled anymore verse 7 for he that is dead is freed from sin so you can see the importance of crucifying daily verse 9 knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death have no more dominion over him you can see why Paul could say death wears out stain grave or is I victory verse 9 knowing that Christ being raised from the dead diet No More Death has no more dominion over him verse 10. friend that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God verse 11. likewise reckon he also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through who Jesus Christ Our Lord verse 12 let not sin therefore reign in your moral body that you should obey it in the lust thereof so it has given us so we have a choice every day if we let sin reign in our life in our life so we have to make that choice and the first choice is made we can get up first thing in the morning verse 13 neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness so just because you're saved and filled with the Holy Ghost does not mean you can't yield your body to unrighteousness because once again we're still in flesh and we still have uh desires we still have uh goals and all these things that can get in the way of our walk and so we got to be careful who we are yielding our members to our instruments to says but yield yourself unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God so it's given us a we need to make that choice to yield our vessel to God because then what we yield our vessel to God the more God can move in your life he can direct your path he can give you the overcoming Victory you want I know we all want victory in our life but we got to do it the way that God has set forth and this what he set forth is we have to yield first we have to submit first amen verse 14 for sin shall not have dominion over you so Christ died so sin will not have dominion over you so I said this statement before don't let a defeated creature defeat you I'll say that again don't let it defeated creature defeat you the devil only had you can only give the devil power if you let him have the power that's the only way so don't let don't let a devil who has been defeated his Stinger's been taken out defeat you because amen so it says for you're not under the law but under grace What then shall we say because we are not under the law but under grace God forbid know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but verse 17 says but God be think that you were the Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that from the doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin you became the Servants of righteousness I speak after the man of a man because of the affirmity of your flesh as you have yielded your members servants Towing cleanliness and to iniquity unto iniquity even to iniquity unto iniquity that's a lot to say even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holy so Paul has given us a challenge even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto Holiness so Paul has given us each one of us that challenge uh to to do that amen verse 20. for when you were a Servants of sin you were free from righteousness what fruit had you then and those things where if you are now ashamed for the end of those things is death but now being made free from sin and become servants to God you have your fruit into Holiness and the unto the end of everlasting for the wages of sin is death but of the gift is eternal life through Christ Jesus our lord so we see just because we're Christians doesn't mean we can't fall in the category so each day we have to make that hard choice of taking the straight and narrow way it's the harder way yes but the harder way will always pay off in life see Satan likes to paint a picture of of fake life but it's really death so don't yield your member to him because the thing is you can yield your member to Satan still because we're still in these fleshly bodies and these fleshly bodies are fickled all these other things that they are so let's go to John chapter 4. first John uh yeah first John Chapter 4 verses one through four so we're talking about a men's meeting how many thoughts you know come into our head and I looked it up one time we get thousands of decisions we have to make thousands of thoughts that come into our head and we got to be able to recognize which are from God and which are not from God because the devil likes to come as God as well and we got to be able to identify what voice is speaking to us at that very moment and we'll go to verse chapter one or verse one in uh first John 4. beloved believe not every spirit so it's telling us don't believe every voice that you hear and says but they but try the spirit so it's giving us a challenge but we got to try that thought whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God verse 3 and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist where if you have heard that it should come and even now already it is in the world verse 4 year of God little children and have overcome them because greater is in in he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen amen and so we really got to just take we got to realize that the devil chose the mind and God chose the heart so the devil's job is to get you confused to bombard you to distract you with all kind of thoughts he doesn't it can be a thought from left field but if he gets you just to contemplate and think upon that thought then you start to begin to manifest that thought so it's so important to keep our minds clean because you can't stop the devil from coming but you can stop him from entering in and so in any way he can get us to doubt the word of God that's that's his whole goal is to get you to doubt in one in any kind of fashion whether it's one percent two percent or a half a percent but that's his job and he's really good at it so we have to be in our a game we got to be sober we got to be vigilant so it's so we got to stop letting our problems engulf us because a lot of times we'll let our situation we're in or trial we get into this engulfs us and we started we start to weaken so we can't let the world's condition engulf you we got to realize that this world isn't going to get any better it's going to get worse every day and brother Branham said this statement you could put Abraham Lincoln and George Washington in every position you could think of and it still wouldn't stop this country from going the way it's going and so we can't let that just down on us we can't let that kill our walk because each day is a step closer to the Rapture so we got to give all that we have to Christ stop letting your past mistakes engulf you stop letting your current situation engulf your thoughts see a lot of times we'll get sold caught up in our current situation and why it's like this how it ended up like this that we lose our Focus off Jesus and that's the devil because the devil wants you to get so bogged down with their problems with their trials and then you start to get bogged down you start complaining you start murmuring and you lose what gratitude you lose the attitude of gratitude and we got to really catch ourselves when we get in that situation because it comes so subtle then it becomes into such a uh something so little becomes so big so that's why it's so important to try what you're thinking think where'd that thought come from because whatever you're thinking is going to be what you're going to become as a man thinketh in his heart so is he amen so don't let your current situation and go for your thoughts see let's start looking to the Lord that's where our strength comes from your strength comes from the Lord not negative thoughts because if you keep doing the same old thing you get the same old result every time let's go to Isaiah 26. so this is the key right here if you want to live an overcoming life I believe this is part of the key right here in Isaiah 26 3-4 and now we all know this and we got a client like brother Beckman said that this is this is my word this is me and so you got to just claim this word for yourself claim it for your life claim it for your family amen verse three and Retail verse four so it says so check this out thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on he doesn't say thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is State on negative thoughts it doesn't but it says that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on the look what it says because he trusted in me and what a verse 4. trust ye in the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehovah look what it says is Everlasting strength the news isn't going to give you strength uh your best friend is going to give you strength but it says the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting I think a lot of times we're looking for strength in all the wrong places it could be our favorite song it could be our favorite preacher but the thing is your strength comes from God the joy of the Lord is your strength amen see we want peace we all want peace right but oftentimes we aren't willing to pay the price of what that piece requires see it pray it pays what the the slow down what the price we have to pay is is a consecrated life we have to deny ourself we have to stop waiting for God to wave some magic wand God doesn't always wave some magic wand but you gotta press you gotta dig in to get that peace because the devil doesn't want you to get that peace he wants to distract you from that peace he wants you to fall short of that peace because he knows when you get into that the peace of God then he can't bombard you anymore he can't distract you because your focus is no longer on the situation but your focus on God and how he's going to carry you through because he promised to carry you through he has to because he promised it amen so the thing is we don't keep our mind constantly on him that's why we don't get that perfect peace we got our mind and so many other things I got to do this today I got to get this done today and you know I got a busy week this week and I'm a pencil guide in here but no you got to keep your mind stayed on him if you want that peace you got to keep your mind stayed on him don't look at what's going wrong but look at God amen and we can't forget one of the Lord's redempt his name the names is Jehovah Shalom the God of Peace So I think we forget what kind of God we serve and we'll go I love the book of Psalms we'll go in Psalms 121. in reverses one through eight amen so David said in the Book of Psalms verse 1 I will lift up my eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help so David recognized where his help coming from it didn't come from um a king in this area didn't come from his best friend but it came from God says my help coming from the Lord which made Heaven and Earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he he that keepeth thee will not Slumber so he recognizes the situation you're in he knows you're going through pain he knows you're going through sickness he knows all these he knows these things but behold he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep The Lord Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy shade upon thy right hand the son shall not smite thee by day nor the Moon by night the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil notice that all evil not just some but all evil he shall preserve thy soul the Lord shall preserve that going out and thy coming in from this time forth and forevermore let's go to Psalms 23. verses 4. amen yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death notice there's light in that Valley because it has to be their shadow I will fear no evil notice that for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff comfort me so we walk through that trial just recognize that God's right there with you you've got to recognize it may not seem like he's there but he's there let him comfort you with his his rod and his staff and then go to Psalms let's go to Psalms 91. the more we can recognize that God is a present God and a present help the more we would we're gonna benefit in the situation that we're in because we recognize that God is always there he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the same God that was part the Red Sea he's the same God that led Joshua he's the same God that wants to lead you so you got to have faith and confidence that God knows how to lead your life see a lot of times we try to lead our own life and we wind up frustrated but if you let God do the leading then that frustration won't enter in because God is ordering your steps but you got to believe that he's ordering your steps you got to be willing to walk in the way that he's ordering your steps that's the key 91 and reverses one through two he that dwelleth in a secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my what my refuge my Fortress my God and him will I trust so we got to be able to claim that for ourselves you gotta be able to say that he is my refuge that he is my Fortress and he's my God and what is a refuge it's a shelter or protection from danger or distress that which shelters or protects from danger distress or calamity a stronghold which protects by its strength or a sanctuary which secures safely by its sacredness any place take us out inaccessible to an enemy one more time any place inaccessible to an enemy that's what shelter is if you're sheltered in Christ the enemy can't even get in he's locked out because you're in that Fortress of of Refuge I looked at the word Fortress it's any fortified place a fort or a castle remember back in the day when the kings and queens had these castles they couldn't enter in because it was guarded and protected but we have an even better Fortress not made by man's hands but as spiritual Fortress that the enemy can throw any kind of Dart he wants but it won't get in because you're fortified in Christ amen let's go to uh Psalms 46. in Reverse over verse 1 through 11. I'm sorry I didn't put that on there it came to me while I was studying back there so God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will we not fear though the Earth be removed notice that therefore will we not fear though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea verse 3 though the waters therefore Roar and be troubled though the mountain Shake was swelling thereof Selah so we could we could put ourselves in a situation though the worst trial we've ever been through our best friend doesn't want to be our friend anymore you you feel like you lose your job whatever the water heater goes out whatever you fill in the blank but it's telling me I'm like you're not going to be removed you can't be moved because you're in God verse 4 there is a river the streams where shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high you know that's what it says right here God is in the midst of her you got to recognize that God is in the midst of your trial he's there she shall not be moved God shall help her and net right early though the Heathen rage and the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice in the earth melted look what says right here the Lord of hosts is with us the Lord is with you you got to believe that the god of Jacob is our refuge amen come and behold the works of the Lord watch desolations he hath made in the earth he maketh Wars to cease unto the end of the Earth he breakth the bow and cutteth the spear in the Sunder he burneth a chariot in the fire but check this out be still and know that I am God stop getting so busy that she don't have time to hear his voice get still before God and know who he is get to know him more get to know what he wants in the situation in your life ask him Lord what are you trying to show me in this trial what am I lacking in this trial I want to do exactly what you want me to do in this trial be more sincere be more personal stop complaining about the trial and to see God what are you trying to show me I want to be able to see exactly what you need me to see Lord give me I spiritual eyes just to recognize verse 11 the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge amen go to Psalms 18. amen I will love thee O Lord my strength so it's another my my strength the Lord is what my rock so notice all these things David is doing he's saying these things personally because that's what the Lord is personally to him and he's experienced these things personally in his life so you have to be able to experience these things be able to really claim that so you can't just read it but you got to say Lord You Are My Rock You Are My Fortress you are my deliverer You Are My Strength and claim me say no to say it because it sounds good but claim it because you know this word is true that he is he's all these things to you since the Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my deliverer there's no situation too big or too small for him to delivery out of amen I will trust my Buckler and look another one my Buckler and the Horn of what my salvation and my high tower look how many my eyes are in here and the word the word buckler is a kind of Shield or a piece of defensive armor anciently used to support or defend so notice that he's your Shield he told Abraham that in a Genesis that he's just he's just Buckler amen amen so we just see these things that whatever situation you're going through you got to claim these things personally in your life because the devil wants you not to claim these things he wants you to start bickering and complaining why I'm why am I in the situation God why am I ask what the devil wants us to do and we're going to let's go to Psalms 119. amen verses 47 through 50. amen says and I will Delight myself in thy Commandments which I have loved see the more we can fall in love with the word of God it's gonna it'll carry you through your situation because when you fall in love with the word you believe that it's all the truth that you that this promise that you're reading is for me that I'm reading this written personally just for me it's written personally just for my situation and I'm going to claim it so you got the more you fall in love with the word because the more you really fall in love with the word you fall in love with God because God in his word are one you can't separate the two you got to have both of them so the more you can fall in love the more you can worship the word the more you can thank the Lord in advance for what he's going to do the more you're gonna be not looking at the negative but looking towards the positive verse 48 my hands also will lift up to thy Commandments which I have loved and I will meditate in thy statutes verse 49 remember the word unto thy servant upon which thou has caused me to Hope this is my comfort and my affliction from that word has quickened me so the word was going to comfort you in your affliction no matter what you're going through read the word you got to read it don't just read it just to read it but really read it to embody it we're talking about manifesting the word you got to have such a desperation in the Lord this word that I'm reading I want to manifest it in my life I want others to be able to see you and not me amen I go to Second Corinthians chapter one three through four read a quote first though hidden life in Christ I think the key is really a hidden life in Christ brother Brown says a statement in 1956 February 13. Christianity is a sacrifice life a hidden life with God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost amen go second Corinthians um to chapter one three through four amen so it says in verse three blessed be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of all no it's not all comfort read that again blessed be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of All Comfort who come forth I love this says who cometh Us in all our tribulation notice that not just some not just parts of it but it says all that we may be able to comfort ah notice that that we be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the Comfort worth we ourselves are comforted of god notice the motive behind him give me that comfort so you can go Comfort somebody else I love God how God thinks that way it's not just about you you you but when he gives you something he wants you to be able to bless somebody else like when God gives you a gift it's not just for you to Harbor and use but it's for you to use somebody else so God can use you to bless somebody else and that's the what a gift really is for amen 1956 the hidden Life of Christ again that's what the real Christian Life consists of not how well you can do this or how well you can sing that's all right now how well you can preach that's fine but that isn't it it's a hidden life consecrated the veil curtains dropped around you so that's what we're talking about really engulfing that's what a engulfing is is a hidden life in Christ it's no more you living but it's Christ Living inside of you so our life must be hit in Christ Our Life must be devoted and dedicated to Christ daily as we said we cannot let the things that we're going through affect our love relationship with Christ in fact it should get stronger I believe your love relationship is what's going to get you through that's the only thing that's going to get you through Is Your Love relationship with Christ we have to be feeding on the right things the right kind of thoughts the right articles the right news all these things we got to be feeding on the right things we need to be hid in prayer hidden the word of God and hitting the message of the hour and I promise you if those three things that you're hidden then you're going to live an overcoming life you have to because you're hiding and you're not just reading it but you're really the the desire the motive is Lord I want to see you more in everything that I do in your word and your profit uh in prayer all these things is going to be what's gonna the key for you to overcome it amen got a couple more quotes but the man who entered in and the veil fell behind him he didn't depend on the sunlight nor the Starlight nor the Moonlight or the seven golden candlesticks he moved up to the altar under the interlocked wings of the cherubim the Shekinah glory of the Lord was in there a smooth light and he lived and was there all the day and night he walked in the light of the Living God Amen and that's what prayer does that enters you into that Veil whether the clouds was going on whether the rain was falling whether the Thunder was rolling whether an army was coming it didn't mean a bit of difference to him he was protected and that's what a hidden life in Christ is you're not worried about what's going on out here what's here or this there you're not worried about what the boss is going to say but the only thing you're worried about is pleasing Christ the only thing you're worried about is Lord am I living the life that you're calling me to live Lord I want to be on this Earth what you want me to be that's what a consecrated life is amen he was protected he was in a Shekinah Glory living in the presence of God hallelujah you think I'm a Holy Roller maybe I am amen come on the inside let the world howl and carry on let the preacher fail then everything else failed that don't stop you a bit stay in there you're living by the pot of manna when you'll eat in it when you'll eat it anytime you get hungry you don't have to worry about the weather it's going to happen or this is going to happen see we're in Christ you're not worried about oh is this going to happen it's going to happen oh man is this going to work out that way you're not worried about those things you remember what says in Romans 8 28 let's go to Romans 8 28. foreign so it says and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose I'm gonna say that one more time maybe somebody's going through a situation right now and we all we know that all things work together for the good to them that what love God and what else to them who are the called according to his purpose you got to believe that scripture personally to you maybe you made a mistake maybe you did something but you got to believe that God is going to work that to for your good he's ha he's going to I promise you and the thing is a lot of times we look at a situation and we don't remember the scripture and we got to remember what we're called for and look between a lot of people stop it at verse 28 but look what 29 says for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn of Our Winning brother moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified whom he justified them he also glorified so he has called you to be an overcomer and there's no enemy there is no whatever you fill in the blank that can stop you unless you do it yourself because you're your biggest enemy you are your biggest enemy will even go to verse 35. it's telling us right here who shall separate us from the love of Christ it's asking you a question what are you going to let separate from the love of Christ are you gonna let tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or parale or sword are you going to let those things affect your love relationship with Christ are you going to let those things affect your well-being because those things can and will affect your well-being if you so let it what things have you been thinking about like what things have you been pondering on lately as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter maybe you look in your life and say this mountain in front of me is too big for me to move that's not what my God says that's not what the word of God says that mountain is going to move but you got to believe it you can't doubt you can't waver that mountain has to move if you have faith to believe that Mountain's gonna move it's gonna move that's what Jesus said amen nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us verse 38 frying persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come no future trials past mistakes we could say that nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord I think Paul gave us all the things that could affect us but he's saying these things should not affect us so let's stop making excuses let's stop complaining let's just look at the god that we serve that he's going to carry you through you just got to Play Your Part even talks about we talked about last time in Hebrews about the how there's a arrest given to the people of God and we all can enter into that risk God's not a respecter of persons that's your rest it's my rest and it says and Paul said we gotta labor in to that rest and when we says labor you gotta fight to stay in that rest you got to pray your way into that rest because when you're in that rest you're not worried about anything anymore necessarily you're not worried about the outcomes of things you're just worried about pleasing God that's your biggest worry Lord I want to please you with all my heart I don't want to waver one bit amen oh come on the inside brother brahm's giving us that invitation get in the presence of the King live there day and night notice that he don't want you to wander around be tossed about you're dissatisfied with these men and coming to church and get a little old I want it day and night don't just wait to church to get your manna and the thing is we if you're waiting just to go to church chances are you're going to leave what you heard at church there because it's not following you see uh with a debt with a Christian Life is it's a hard rugged life every day that when you're going it's like a for instance you have your car and you have to fill it up right every however many times so a lot of times what people do is they just fill up a church then they they get on E by the time they get back to church so the thing is you got to constantly fill up your tank your spiritual tank you gotta be constantly be praying constantly be reading and don't wait till when don't be a Wednesday and Sunday Christian you'll be an everyday Christian see this world is filled with so many this Wednesdays and Sundays Christian it's like for instance it's like it's like you uh God's speaking to you on Sunday if you're going to the club the next day that's what it's like and a lot of people do that they just they forget about what God said they leave it there and they wonder why not live in an overcoming life they wonder why they're struggling they wonder why they're barely making it into church because you're not taking what God spoke to you and apply it in your life and saying Lord I want to become what I heard on Sunday I want to become what I heard on Wednesday I want to become what I heard the prophet say I want to become what I read in Isaiah chapter one today you fill in the blank that's a lot of times why people can't live and stay in the presence of the king because they're not willing to pray the price they're not willing to do what it takes they're not willing to crucify their flesh you're not willing to just be all what God wants them to be that's the key amen what's the matter with the Church of the Living God today who's promised that same blessing what's the matter with us today because we can't get our we can't get enough together to group ourselves together to come into the holiest of the holiest and and their state hide yourselves from the things of the world and live a look at this a full surrendered consecrated life for the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's what it is coming into the Glorious light of the gospel and in doing so you receive it amen this other quote I guess from why are people so tossed about says did you ever meet a person that's been in there and he's tasted and living on this Manna you can meet him on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday cloudy day Bright Day gloomy day that's going right wrong he's always sweet always full of love never to talk or do anything wrong he's living under the glory of God he never gets hungry he he he he never has to go to church to get built up notice that he's just always full of God see Church shouldn't be just a some like some pit stop or or some uh a filling station of the empty but the thing is it should just top off the tank you know how you're not all you're always full but you want to top it off that's what church should be it should be uh just to give you more gas to go even further in your journey and a lot of times we use churches um we use churches like like some Hospital like we're just beat down and we're barely making it or crawling on a crutch and obviously Church you know it can be that for some some things you know go through hard things a lot of times we make it such a habit of making a church is just some hospital where we got to be maimed and we got gunshot wounds and stuff but we can't make church that way we got to make Church as it's more of like a it gives you a more of a running you're running it's like a relay you know you get that baton and you're running faster and we got to look at churches that way because God has something for you to receive he wants to speak to you personally you take that word and it should be it should build you up it shouldn't it should encourage you it should say Lord I want to be that Lord I'm coming to church because I want to see where I'm at with you I'm not coming I want to hear my favorite scripture or my favorite song sung but I'm coming because I know that you have something personal for me and Lord if I receive that I promise I'm going to walk in it I'm gonna do everything I can it is to walk in what you're speaking to me and notice the desperation the attitude right there it's all about attitude you got to ask yourself when you walk in those doors or even when you're driving the way there why am I going to church ask yourself that because if you really if you're really real with yourself you're going to find out what the real motive is a lot of times we got these mixed Motors oh I just I need some encouragement I'm going through this no no no no don't come for that reason say God I'm here to meet with you that's the only reason I'm here to worship you I'm here to lift you up I'm here to praise your name I don't care how I'm feeling I don't care what kind of day I had I'm here for you and you alone and I'm I'm singing these songs of Zion with all my heart I just want to come here to make love with you and if you have that motive I promise Lord is going to meet you he's going to meet you every single time because he sees your heart's desire he sees your hearts intent amen no it's the same manner that was eat out in the course was eat also in the holies of the holies but this man out here give out quickly you've met people like that would he out there and say well brother Brandon I've I had the same thing I did this and I did that just like they did but I've met that woman she's always on the housetop notice that there's never a worry in her mind notice that I met the man wherever he's got a big smile on his face and saying praise the Lord how you feeling wonderful every time he gets sick the preacher comes and prays for him brother he's out and gone the next day amen he's just wonderful I I can't hold my blessing somehow see it's the place you're abiding it notice that it's the place that you're abiding in if you're abiding in your negative thoughts what are you going to get death every time but if you're abiding in Christ if you're abiding in this is um in Jeremiah the thoughts that I think towards you to give you an expected end so you gotta be thinking in that that situation and don't let your current situation discourage you because if you abide in discouragement then you got to take your mind off of God every time man you won't have that perfect peace so it's the place you're abiding in it's where you're at oh I want you to get this close remember that's many times on the campground these blessings run out you're eating the Manna the correct manner but you haven't consecrated your life really one more time you're eating the Manna the correct manner but you haven't consecrated your life and went into a place like Aaron behind the holiest of the holiest when he was in there nothing he he didn't hear the world anymore so a lot of times we're waiting for a Revival to come waiting for a fiery Evangelical Brothers Andrew to come you don't have to wait for them to come for you to be consecrated for you to be on fire for God don't wait because if you're waiting for that that fire is going to die right away I remember oh I never forget the one says men's meeting a couple years ago and it was I think it was Saturday night going to Sunday night and they're doing a devotion and he said this statement he's don't let what you've heard this weekend stay here he said the devil is going to come Monday and he's going to bombard you with all these things because the devil is kind of like he raised his drawbridge up because he knows he can't get you during the weekend because you know that you forgot about your problems there and you're coming for God but he knows if he can get you Monday morning then all that you heard Friday Saturday and Sunday is going to be in vain but he said you gotta let you get take that word with you you got to bring it with you all the things that amen praise the Lord you got to take that with you so don't let Thursday tomorrow come and it's like you never went to church but you take what you heard what God spoke to you take it with you you think about it you claim it you read the scriptures read your notes I I got a bad habit sometimes you'll take notes you'll read them but take time in the morning we wake up in the morning when you pray take time when you're studying your word read the notes you wrote down say the scriptures that you wrote down because that's how you got to constantly David said I kept the lord always before me and that's all you got to always keep the Lord before you always and I promise if you do that always then God is going to be more he's going to be preeminating your life you're going to be living an overcoming life you're going to be feeding on that Manna on in the holiest of the holiest amen amen praise God we'll stand to our feet praise God amen so he said before don't abide in your negative thoughts anymore don't let the devil have victory in your life don't let the devil have any preeminence in your life because the devil is fighting for preeminence and God wants preeminence you you are the one who chooses who has the preeminence it's a white dog and a black dog in you as we heard that many times before so whatever dog you feed the most is what's going to come out on top so you feed that white dog whatever you're going through don't wait until to get desperate when you're in a bad situation but get desperate no matter what Mountaintop or valleys get desperate always and I believe if we just get desperate then God is going to be so much more real to us he has to become more real to us every day don't just wait till church for him to come real this give them your all every day if God gave you his all you give them your all right amen can we sing his strength that's perfect [Music] his strength is perfect winter strength is gone he'll carry us when we can carry on raised in his power the weak become strong his strength is perfect [Music] his perfect just sing that to him this morning strength is perfect winner strength is gone he'll carry us when we can't carry on your raised in his house the weak become strong his strength is perfect
