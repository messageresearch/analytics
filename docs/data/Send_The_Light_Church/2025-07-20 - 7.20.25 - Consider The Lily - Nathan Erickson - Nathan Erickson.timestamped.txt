[5:58] I said, "I'm doing great."
[6:00] He said, "Wow." He says, "That's that's
[6:03] wonderful." I said, "Two years ago, I
[6:06] said, I went into the doctor and he
[6:07] said, you got two bad valves. You're
[6:09] going to die."
[6:10] I said, "I've had open heart surgery.
[6:12] Every day is a blessing from here on
[6:14] out.
[6:17] And you don't have to have that to to
[6:20] want to say every day is a blessing.

[6:32] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, thank you so much
[6:34] for
[6:37] &gt;&gt; blessing us with another
[6:43] &gt;&gt; kindness of our heart. May just
[6:47] feed us with the word today.
[6:57] &gt;&gt; I would ask Lord that you just speak to
[7:01] each and every person here who's
[7:08] whatever it may

[7:45] through. Amen.
[7:48] Lord, I have started to walk in the
[7:52] light shining upon me from heaven so
[7:57] bright. I'll take the world and its
[8:01] folly is a do. I've started for Jesus
[8:06] and I'm going through.
[8:09] I'm going through. Yes, I'm going

[8:17] others do. I'll take away with the
[8:22] Lord's despised view. I'm going to
[8:25] Jesus. Yes, I'm going through. Oh, there
[8:30] are many who start in this race, but
[8:35] with a light refuse to keep pace. Others
[8:40] accept it because it is true. But not
[8:44] very many expect to go through. I'm
[8:49] going through. Yes, I'm going through.
[8:54] I'll pay the price. Whatever others do,
[8:59] I'll take the way with the Lord's
[9:02] despised view. I'm going to Jesus. Yes,
[9:06] I'm going to
[9:09] rather walk with Jesus alone.
[9:14] Have for a pillow like Jacob a stone,
[9:18] living each moment with his face in
[9:22] view. then shrink from my pathway and
[9:26] fail to go through. I'm going through.
[9:30] Yes, I'm going through. I'll pay the
[9:34] price whatever others do. I'll take the
[9:39] way with the Lord's despised view. I'm
[9:43] going to Jesus. Yes, I'm going to. Oh,
[9:48] brother. How will you take up your
[9:52] cross? Give up the world and count it as
[9:56] cross. Sell all thou hast and give to
[10:01] the poor and go through with Jesus and
[10:05] those who endure.
[10:08] I'm going through. Yes, I'm going
[10:11] through. I'll pay the price. Whatever
[10:15] others do, I'll take the way with the
[10:20] Lord's despise you. I'm going to Jesus.

[10:56] I'm sisfied
[10:59] with
[11:01] just a cottage below.
[11:07] A little silver
[11:11] and a little gold.
[11:16] But in that city
[11:19] [Applause]
[11:20] where the ransom will shine,
[11:25] I want a gold one.
[11:30] that silver line.
[11:35] I've got a manion
[11:39] just over the hilltop
[11:44] in that bright land where
[11:49] we'll never grow old.
[11:54] And someday yonder,
[11:58] we will never more wonder,
[12:03] but walk on streets that
[12:08] are purest gold,
[12:12] though often temped,
[12:17] tormented and tested.
[12:22] And like the prophet,
[12:26] my pillow a stone.
[12:31] And though I find here
[12:35] no permanent dwelling,
[12:40] I know he'll give me
[12:44] a mansion my own.
[12:49] I've got a mansion
[12:54] just over the hilltop
[12:58] in that bright land where
[13:03] we'll never grow old.
[13:08] And someday yonder
[13:12] we will never more wonder
[13:17] but walk on streets that
[13:22] our purest gold.
[13:26] Don't think me poor or
[13:31] deserted or lonely.
[13:35] I'm not discouraged.
[13:40] I'm heaven bound.
[13:44] I'm just a pilground
[13:49] in search of a city.
[13:54] I want a manion,
[13:58] a harp, and a crown.
[14:03] I've got a man
[14:05] chair
[14:07] just over the hilltop
[14:12] with great land where
[14:16] we'll never grow.
[14:21] And someday
[14:25] we will never more wonder
[14:30] but walk on streets that
[14:35] are purest gold.
[14:40] Amen.
[14:42] Amen.
[14:45] And in case you don't know,
[14:47] that's your new body.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a carnal house,
[14:52] &gt;&gt; but it's a new body. Amen. I know who am
[14:55] I believed. Amen.
[14:59] I know not why God's wondrous grace to
[15:05] me he hath made known
[15:09] nor why unworthy Christ in love redeemed
[15:16] before his own.
[15:19] But I know whom I have believed in and
[15:24] am persuaded
[15:26] that he is able
[15:29] to keep that which I've committed
[15:34] unto him against that day.
[15:39] I know not how his saving faith to me he
[15:45] did impart
[15:48] nor how believing in his word brought
[15:53] peace within my heart.
[15:57] But I know whom I have believed in and
[16:02] am persuaded
[16:04] that he is able
[16:07] to keep that which I've committed
[16:11] unto him against the day.
[16:16] I know not how the spirit moves,
[16:21] convincing
[16:23] men of sin,
[16:26] revealing
[16:27] Jesus through his word, creating
[16:32] faith in him.
[16:35] But I know whom I have believed in and
[16:40] am persuaded
[16:42] that he is able
[16:44] to keep that which I've committed
[16:49] unto him against that day.
[16:54] I know not what of good or ill may be
[17:00] reserved for me.
[17:03] of weery days or golden days before his
[17:09] face I see.
[17:12] But I know whom I have believed in and
[17:17] am persuaded
[17:19] that he is able
[17:22] to keep that which I've committed
[17:26] unto him against that day.
[17:31] I know not where my Lord will come at
[17:36] night or noon day fair,
[17:40] nor if I will go with him or meet him in
[17:47] the air.
[17:50] But I know whom I have believed in and
[17:54] am persuaded
[17:56] that he is able
[17:59] to keep that which I've committed
[18:03] unto him against that day.
[18:08] But I know whom I have believed in and
[18:13] am persuaded
[18:15] that he is able
[18:17] to keep that which I've committed
[18:22] unto him against that day.
[18:27] Amen.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[18:42] request and that's for Sister Linda
[18:44] Helms. She's not feeling well. Just pray
[18:47] the Lord will just bless her, keep her.
[18:51] Amen.
[18:52] Remember the believers around the world,
[18:56] Ukraine and Poland and Russia, also in
[19:00] Israel, that God will just keep them,
[19:02] keep them safe. remember those that have
[19:05] lost loved ones in Texas and uh I was
[19:10] telling Sister Donna this morning on the
[19:12] way here uh Alaska had an earthquake of
[19:16] 7.3 this past week.
[19:19] Kind of things you don't see.
[19:22] So
[19:24] God is faithful.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; That's the thing that I like about that
[19:28] song. He said he's faithful. Everything
[19:30] that I've committed to him
[19:33] &gt;&gt; that's my life.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; So I know whatever comes my way,
[19:38] &gt;&gt; I've committed it to him.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; And then he's allowed it. He's allowed
[19:43] it. We don't like to think of that, but
[19:44] he's allowed that.
[19:46] &gt;&gt; He knows all things and he's just trying
[19:48] to make us more in his image. Let's all
[19:50] stand together this morning. Let's just
[19:52] join our voices together. Amen.

[21:27] &gt;&gt; And then we have brother Aaron McGary
[21:30] this coming Wednesday. So make sure you
[21:32] come back. You know, it's kind of
[21:34] discouraging on a Wednesday night to
[21:35] only have five people here.

[24:11] blessing. Each moment he crowns

[26:30] Said, "We've had enough with this guy."
[26:33] But he was hid in the cliff of the rock.
[26:35] Just walked right through them. They
[26:37] didn't see him. Aren't you glad for
[26:40] people mad at you all the time and God
[26:41] just put you in the cliff of the rock,
[26:44] &gt;&gt; walk right through them. They don't even

[35:05] pastor this morning? Amen.
[35:08] Amen. We love you, brother John. And
[35:10] it's just uh it's just real really
[35:12] special and really an honor to be here
[35:13] and want to just thank the church for
[35:16] for uh your friendship over the years
[35:18] and especially for taking good care of
[35:20] Grandpa Johnson uh in uh in these last
[35:23] few years of his life. I know he was
[35:25] just well loved and well taken care of
[35:27] here and always talked about how much he
[35:29] enjoyed coming here. So we thank you
[35:31] all. Thank you brother Bruce and
[35:32] everybody who just uh just been friends
[35:34] with my family and so we love you. just
[35:37] want to be a blessing today and a and a
[35:39] help and an encouragement if we can try
[35:41] to bring something that'll just uplift
[35:42] the church and and let you know that
[35:44] we're behind you and with you on life's
[35:46] journey. So, uh greetings from everybody
[35:49] back home from uh Brother Wayne, Brother
[35:51] Ray, and all the saints back at Truer
[35:52] Tabernacle there in Ohio. And also, uh I
[35:55] hate that my family can't be with us.
[35:57] They came all the way to Ann Arbor with
[35:58] me last night. And then uh my little
[36:00] man, who a lot of you haven't met yet, a
[36:02] little man got a fever last night. So,
[36:04] uh, mama stayed home with some sick
[36:06] babies. So, flying solo today. Uh, so
[36:09] Lord willing, next time, next time
[36:11] she'll come along. Matthew chapter 6, if
[36:13] you want to turn with me
[36:17] &gt;&gt; and verse 26,
[36:19] we'll just read the words of Jesus
[36:21] today.
[36:29] Matthew 6 and 26. We'll read down to
[36:32] verse 29 here. Jesus says, "Behold the
[36:34] fowls of the air.
[36:37] For they sow not, neither do they reap,
[36:40] nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly
[36:43] Father feedth them." Are you not much
[36:46] better than they? That's that's an
[36:48] incredible That's an incredible thought
[36:50] there. Uh, but I'd like to focus on the
[36:53] on this next type here a little more. He
[36:55] says, "Which of you by taking thought
[36:57] can add one cubit unto his stature?
[37:01] Uh, and why take ye thought for
[37:03] raignment? Consider the liies of the
[37:05] field, how they grow. They toil not,
[37:08] neither do they spin. And yet I say unto
[37:11] you that even Solomon in all his glory
[37:14] was not arrayed like one of these. So
[37:17] Jesus says we should consider the lily.
[37:18] That's what I'd like to do this morning.
[37:20] Just bring a couple simple thoughts
[37:22] today. Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[37:24] Let's just invite him into this service.
[37:26] Heavenly Father, Lord, it's it's such a
[37:29] special thing, Lord, to be here, Lord,
[37:32] with what feels like home folks, Lord,
[37:34] and family. Well, I just thank you,
[37:36] Lord, for the memories, Lord, and the
[37:39] and and the the the legacy, Lord, of
[37:41] your faithfulness that's represented
[37:43] here, Lord. And what a special people
[37:46] this is to me, Father, and a special
[37:47] church. And what a blessing they've been
[37:49] to me, Lord. Especially in the early
[37:51] years of my life, Lord. And so we just
[37:54] ask Lord that you would just come and do
[37:55] something special for a special people.
[37:57] Lord, Lord, as special as we are as one
[38:00] another, Lord, uh to one another as
[38:02] human beings, Father, how much greater,
[38:04] Lord, in your mind and in your thoughts,
[38:06] Lord, are we are we kept, Lord, and
[38:09] cared for. Lord, uh we could never out
[38:11] love you today, Father. But Lord, I
[38:13] believe I'm speaking to a people, Lord,
[38:15] that you have loved.
[38:16] And Lord, we just want to be a faithful
[38:18] servant today, Lord, to bless the
[38:20] people, Lord, that you are looking out
[38:21] for. Lord, those that you have chosen
[38:23] and elected. Father, I pray, Lord, we'd
[38:26] be able to say something that would
[38:27] encourage, uplift, Lord, and and Lord,
[38:29] and and and support today, Lord, your
[38:32] people, your bride. And so, Lord, we
[38:34] just want to invite you into this
[38:35] service. Lord, we want to be out of your
[38:37] way and ask that you take complete
[38:38] control, Lord, in the name of Jesus
[38:40] Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you as
[38:42] you're seated.
[38:51] Amen. Just want to consider the lily.
[38:53] So, just bear with me a few moments and
[38:55] we'll we'll try to lay a little
[38:57] foundation on this thought. Of course,
[38:59] you know, it's a simple thought, but uh
[39:02] but uh God is a God we know who hides
[39:04] himself in simplicity, brother Brandham
[39:06] would say. And and so, you know, God is
[39:08] simple in his ways, but just because
[39:11] he's simple doesn't mean it's not deep,
[39:13] right? doesn't mean it's not profound or
[39:15] you know that the things of the Lord are
[39:17] not something that takes a while to just
[39:19] uh to really get a handle on. Brother
[39:21] Brandon would talk about this. He
[39:22] preaches one of my favorite messages uh
[39:24] God hiding himself in simplicity. And he
[39:26] makes a statement that a man could sit
[39:28] down and look at a bunch of flowers like
[39:30] a bouquet. And he said, "You could look
[39:32] at a bouquet and study it for 30 minutes
[39:34] sincerely with all your heart and know
[39:36] more about God than if you had all the
[39:38] degrees that a Bible school could give
[39:40] you. for he says God reveals himself in
[39:43] the flower. So I think it would just
[39:45] behoove us today to to take a little
[39:47] time and begin to look at this beautiful
[39:49] type that God has put on the earth of a
[39:51] flower. And you know the story of the
[39:53] flower is the story of an overcomer.
[39:55] Jesus would use the lily to represent
[39:57] the the Christian life. And and uh and
[40:00] brother Brandham would talk a lot about
[40:01] Reverend Mr. Lily. He used to preach
[40:03] that sermon and and uh and you know a
[40:05] flower is a it's a beautiful thing. It's
[40:07] fragile. Uh but it's a it has a sermon.
[40:11] It has a it has something that it gives
[40:13] out little though it is and fragile
[40:15] though it is. It's a it's a life which
[40:18] is expressing something uh into the
[40:20] world which has meaning and it has
[40:22] purpose. Amen. And and that's uh that's
[40:25] that's uh that's what that's what
[40:27] Christianity is. A real Christian life
[40:29] that that has had a process of time and
[40:32] has gone through a season of growth and
[40:34] a season of blessing. you know, a
[40:36] Christian life comes to a place where
[40:38] where uh it's supposed to it's supposed
[40:40] to come into a maturity where it comes
[40:42] into blossom and and there's something,
[40:45] you know, when when uh in the early days
[40:47] of your Christian life, God is pouring
[40:49] so many things into you, but uh but
[40:51] there comes a time when a Christian life
[40:53] comes to a place where it begins to give
[40:54] out. Amen. It gives out a beauty and it
[40:57] gives out a fragrance and and uh and and
[40:59] and and there's a richness of a
[41:01] Christian life that has had time to
[41:03] blossom. Amen. Amen. And and so, you
[41:05] know, but uh but you look at that, it'd
[41:07] be just like you go down to a a florist
[41:09] or something like that or look at a
[41:11] bouquet and you see a beautiful flower,
[41:13] you know, and it's just uh it's just uh
[41:15] it catches the eye and it's got a
[41:17] fragrance and it's got a beauty and you
[41:18] would look at that and say, "Well, now
[41:20] how could I how could I obtain that? How
[41:22] can I, you know, how can I have that in
[41:25] my home?" You know, and so you would
[41:26] look at that and you say, "What a
[41:28] beautiful flower." But, you know, if you
[41:29] want to have a flower, you're going to
[41:31] have to start with a seed. You can't uh
[41:33] you can't just skip to the end. You'd
[41:35] have to you got to start with a seed,
[41:36] right? And it's the same with a
[41:38] Christian life. You know, as a young
[41:39] Christian, you look around, you look at
[41:41] you look at uh brothers and sisters that
[41:43] you admire and there's something about
[41:44] their life that's giving out that that
[41:46] you think is worthy and you think, you
[41:48] know, you think is uh is beautiful in
[41:51] God's way. And you look at that and you
[41:53] say, "Well, you know, but how do I come
[41:55] to that place in my life?" Well, it's
[41:57] the same thing, friends. It all starts
[41:58] with a seed. It starts with a seed, a
[42:01] predestination. A Christian life, you
[42:03] know, is something that starts with a
[42:04] birth. Amen. It doesn't uh you know, you
[42:07] don't you don't just skip from your
[42:08] birth to your adoption. There's a
[42:10] process of learning and growing and
[42:12] being led and and so you know uh you got
[42:15] to start with a seed. That's why you
[42:16] know uh brother Bram would preach so
[42:17] much especially in the final years of
[42:19] his ministry about the quickening power.
[42:22] How many know the Holy Ghost has
[42:23] quickening power? That means power to
[42:25] make something alive and make something
[42:27] you know come into life. And you know
[42:29] that's why we need we need quickening
[42:32] power in the church. We need the you
[42:34] know we can't just gather around in a
[42:36] traditional way or just to observe a
[42:38] ritual but but but Christianity is based
[42:40] around the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit to
[42:43] come into the church and with quickening
[42:45] power because God is the one who has the
[42:47] power to bring out of us. Amen. What we
[42:50] should be. And so so he sends the hol
[42:52] sends the Holy Ghost into the church not
[42:54] just to bring emotion although it can
[42:57] make you emotional or not just to bring
[42:59] excitement or although it can be quite
[43:00] exciting but but to uh but to bring out
[43:03] of the people the what is what he
[43:05] planted in them. Amen. To make people
[43:08] walk in the purpose that he has for
[43:09] their life. Amen. And so that's uh
[43:11] that's where a Christian really has to
[43:13] come to. A Christian has got to come to
[43:15] a birth. They got to be born again by
[43:17] the spirit of God. Amen. Amen. Because a
[43:19] seed, you know, you notice a seed, a
[43:21] seed isn't born when it falls from the
[43:23] branch of its parentage, right? When a
[43:25] when a seed falls off the tree, that's
[43:27] not the birth of a new tree. That's a
[43:29] that's just a, you know, that's just a
[43:30] seed falling to the ground. But but that
[43:33] seed might lay there and it might lay
[43:34] there quite a while. It might lay there
[43:36] for seasons and time and Amen. But there
[43:38] comes a point in time when that seed
[43:40] something happens to that seed. It
[43:42] becomes quickened. Amen. I love that
[43:44] word. It becomes quickened. and you know
[43:46] and uh and and and that's when the seed
[43:49] is born is when it's quick in the life.
[43:50] And so you know a a a young person or a
[43:53] Christian is not born when they join a
[43:55] church. They're not born again, you
[43:57] know, when they though it' be a good
[43:59] church. They're not they're not born
[44:00] again the first time they hear a good
[44:02] sermon or hear a message. That's not
[44:04] that's not a real quickening. But
[44:06] sometimes they'll lay there, you know,
[44:07] like me, I I grew up in church, so I
[44:09] fell from the branch of Brian and
[44:11] Lucille Ericson and laid in church for
[44:12] quite a long time. But there comes a
[44:14] time in the Christian life when the Holy
[44:17] Spirit comes your way and touches you
[44:19] and and now it it may not be some great
[44:21] dramatic moment but but the thing is
[44:23] from that time things can't be the same
[44:25] because when a seed is quickened it
[44:27] unlocks something in that seed that it's
[44:29] going it's going to start pushing toward
[44:32] a destiny. Amen. Amen. That's what a new
[44:34] birth is. It's the awakening of a seed
[44:36] of life that's in you. That's a it's a
[44:38] beautiful thing. Now, everything you see
[44:40] on the outside of that seed is a is just
[44:42] a dead husk. It's just a all it is is
[44:45] something for the life inside that seed
[44:47] to consume and push up into a flower.
[44:49] It's a it's just a husk. And it's the
[44:51] same way with us friends. You know, uh
[44:52] we love to see the we love to see a
[44:54] beautiful church building and we love to
[44:56] come together and sing the songs and
[44:58] have our fellowship one with the other.
[44:59] But if that was all it was, all those
[45:01] outward things and just all those
[45:03] external attributes of our religion that
[45:06] that in itself is not life. Amen. But
[45:09] but it's the Holy Ghost in the church.
[45:10] It's the Holy Ghost in the worship. And
[45:12] it's the Holy Ghost in the preaching.
[45:14] Amen. That that that has life and gives
[45:16] life. Amen. And so and everything else
[45:19] is just a dead husk. And that's why, you
[45:21] know, that's why there are a lot of uh
[45:23] you know, there there there are a lot of
[45:24] I've been preaching uh at home a little
[45:26] bit on a on a little series on the
[45:28] lifeline. And and you know, uh talking
[45:30] about the lifeline, how it comes from
[45:32] seed after seed and generation after
[45:34] generation. There's a there's a line of
[45:36] life. And Amen. Amen. I I believe uh I
[45:38] believe the church, the bride today
[45:40] under the message of the hour is coming
[45:41] to a place of maturity.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, but maturity doesn't mean uh
[45:46] maturity doesn't to me mean that she
[45:49] becomes dry. It doesn't mean that she
[45:50] becomes formal or cold or you know or or
[45:53] or or or or shrivels up like old husk.
[45:56] Amen. I I believe a mature tree, a
[45:58] mature plant is a plant that has come to
[46:00] the place where it's ready to bring
[46:02] forth new life. Amen. That's a mature
[46:05] plant. A mature a plant's not mature.
[46:07] you know, when it's been cut down and
[46:08] take to the burning pile and, you know,
[46:10] it served its purpose and it's got no
[46:12] life in it anymore. But a mature plant,
[46:14] a mature a mature grain, a wheat plant,
[46:17] when it comes to maturity, it's at the
[46:19] point where it's ready to to produce a
[46:21] seed that's just like the original one
[46:23] that went into the ground. And I believe
[46:25] the br the message is taking the bride
[46:28] to a place, amen, where where she is
[46:30] able to bring forth new life. She should
[46:32] be more more giving of life than she
[46:35] ever has been. She should be more able
[46:36] to reproduce the life of Christ. More
[46:39] able to bring young people and new
[46:41] Christians to uh to a new birth and to a
[46:43] new experience and bring forth Holy
[46:45] Ghost children because Amen. because she
[46:47] has come to her maturity and she's come
[46:49] to where she's ready to fulfill her
[46:51] purpose. Amen. There's a lot that could
[46:53] be said on that topic, but I'm really
[46:54] just I'm moving toward some other areas
[46:56] here. And so, you know, uh Brother
[46:58] Brandham would use a quote, and I I've
[47:00] quote it many times. I'm sure I'm sure I
[47:02] quoted it, I bet the first time I ever
[47:03] preached for brother John. But in the in
[47:05] the Easter Seal, Brother Bram says, "Are
[47:07] we really getting people to Christ or
[47:09] are we just getting them to church?" And
[47:11] that has been the passion of my life is
[47:14] to make sure that we don't take this
[47:16] beautiful glorious message which has
[47:17] come in our day and turn it into another
[47:20] dead letter of tradition and turn it
[47:22] into something that's just ritual and
[47:23] just stories about what happened years
[47:25] ago. Amen. It's good, he said, to get
[47:28] people to church, but you got to get
[47:29] them past the church and actually make
[47:31] sure people have made a personal contact
[47:33] with Christ. He said, where there's
[47:35] quickening power. Amen. In another of
[47:38] his Easter messages when he would talk
[47:39] about liies, he said, "Is there somebody
[47:41] here?" He's talking to his own church
[47:42] now. And he he would challenge his own
[47:44] church. He said, "Is there somebody here
[47:46] who doesn't have that quickening power
[47:48] in you where the sun is shining across
[47:50] you?" He said, "Now maybe you've sat in
[47:52] this tabernacle. You've listened to
[47:54] tapes." He said, "And yet the spirit has
[47:56] never quickened you to follow the word
[47:58] of God." Oh, he said, "That's a
[48:00] dangerous thing." Brother Brandham said
[48:01] one time, "The most dangerous deception
[48:03] or the greatest deception is for
[48:05] somebody to think they're a Christian
[48:06] and not be." Well, why would somebody
[48:08] think they're a Christian? Because of an
[48:10] outward appearance. Well, I belong to
[48:12] church and I dress a certain holy way
[48:14] and I act a certain way and I believe
[48:17] God sent a prophet and all of these
[48:19] things. But but that on the outside does
[48:21] is not just the evidence of life. Amen.
[48:23] But there's got to be something on the
[48:25] inside. Brother Bram said it's a
[48:26] dangerous thing to be a dead seed to be
[48:29] a, you know, a seed that's laying there
[48:30] with so much potential in it. But it's
[48:32] never made contact with something that
[48:34] could bring that seed to life and be and
[48:37] cause, Amen. And put into motion a
[48:39] growth and a maturing. Amen. That could
[48:42] bring something not just put some not
[48:43] just put blessings into you, but bring
[48:45] blessings out of you. Amen. And make you
[48:47] a real Christian that can spread the
[48:49] light to the world. Amen. He said, "Oh,
[48:52] it'd be a dangerous thing to be a dead
[48:54] seed." But he said, "There's something
[48:55] in you. If there's something in you that
[48:58] tells you, I want to rise this morning.
[49:00] I I want to rise from the state that I'm
[49:03] in. And I don't want to just be a dead
[49:05] seed and be left to dirt and driftwood.
[49:07] I want to rise." How many hear that
[49:09] little voice on the inside? I'll tell
[49:11] you what, brother, sister, you know, I
[49:13] don't know, you know, I don't know the
[49:14] conditions of everybody's life today,
[49:16] but you know, uh, you might be in a dark
[49:18] place in your life, and you may you may
[49:20] be struggling with things, or, you know,
[49:22] maybe maybe spiritually you're not
[49:24] really where you should be with the
[49:25] Lord, and maybe your heart's not really
[49:27] where it should be. And that, you know,
[49:29] that that's a that's how that's where we
[49:31] get as human beings sometimes. But but
[49:33] if there's a little voice down beyond
[49:35] lower down than the condition that
[49:36] you're in, lower down than the things
[49:38] that you're struggling with, a little
[49:39] deep calling to the deep on the very
[49:42] inside of you, a little voice that says,
[49:44] I don't want to stay here down where I'm
[49:46] at. Amen. But I want to rise this
[49:48] morning. I'm feeling pulled toward I
[49:50] don't know how I could get to a higher
[49:52] place, but something in me is saying I
[49:54] want to rise and I want to I want to
[49:56] attain and I want to I want to get
[49:58] somewhere further with God. Amen. where
[50:00] I'm closer to him tomorrow than I was
[50:02] today. And then and know that next year
[50:04] I'll be further down the road than where
[50:06] I am now. I don't want to be dead, a
[50:08] dead Christian. I want to be alive and I
[50:10] want to rise. Amen. Brother, sister, if
[50:12] you got a little voice like that on the
[50:14] inside of you, I want you to I want you
[50:16] to do something for me this morning.
[50:17] Forget your weakness. Forget what you're
[50:19] struggling with. Forget about the
[50:21] circumstances and the conditions and the
[50:23] obstacles of your life. Because if you
[50:25] got a little voice like that on the
[50:26] inside that's yearning for greater life,
[50:28] brother and sister, you got power this
[50:30] morning. And I'm I want to preach about
[50:32] a very special kind of power. You know,
[50:34] we all we we preach about power to heal
[50:36] the sick and power to perform miracles
[50:38] and power to break chains and all those
[50:40] kind of things. And all of that, all
[50:42] that's the true power of God. Amen. But
[50:44] the power I want to talk about is the
[50:46] most power. It's the most important kind
[50:48] of power that there is in the Christian
[50:50] life. It's called power to become. Amen.
[50:53] Cuz if you're a seed of God, amen, then
[50:56] uh that uh uh by by predestination, then
[50:58] you have a power in that seed. A seed
[51:01] has a has power. Now, a a seed looks
[51:04] little, a seed looks insignificant, a
[51:06] seed looks very very humble, but it has
[51:08] a power in it that given time and
[51:10] atmosphere, it will become in the image
[51:14] of where it came from, it's because it's
[51:16] got power actually in it to become Amen.
[51:19] what it's supposed to be. Uh we we we'll
[51:21] get into it a little bit. That's that's
[51:23] why something in you wants to rise
[51:25] because the there's a there's a law in a
[51:28] seed. How many know that everyone that
[51:29] God knew in the fornowledge of his mind,
[51:32] Amen, is a is a predestinated seed of
[51:34] God. He called you a a gene seed. Amen.
[51:37] Amen. Well, that you know that's not
[51:38] just accidental language. A seed is
[51:40] something very very unique and very
[51:42] powerful. Amen. Because a seed is the
[51:45] encapsulation of a law of God. You you
[51:49] look at it naturally. You take a little
[51:50] seed and that is an encapsulation of
[51:52] God's law. How many know in the days of
[51:54] Genesis, God created the heavens and the
[51:56] earth and he put a law in effect. He
[51:59] said he didn't he didn't necessarily put
[52:01] a put an oak tree on the earth or or or
[52:03] or or or put a you know an apple tree
[52:05] but he put seeds in the earth and but
[52:08] when he planted the seed he put a law in
[52:11] the seed to become what he had in his
[52:13] mind in the beginning. He was thinking
[52:15] about an oak tree so he planted an
[52:17] acorn. Amen. Oh my. But he put a law in
[52:20] an acorn. It's a law of God now because
[52:22] he said, "Let every seed bring forth of
[52:25] its own kind."
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. You ready for some deep teaching
[52:29] this morning? Ever since God said, "Let
[52:31] every seed bring forth of its own kind."
[52:33] Amen. A cat has never had puppies.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; It's never happened one time. Anybody
[52:38] ever seen it? Anybody? And a dog has
[52:41] never had kittens. It's never happened
[52:43] at one time ever since God made a law
[52:46] when he said, "Let every seed bring
[52:47] forth of its own kind." So, I want you
[52:49] to understand this morning that I'm
[52:50] talking about a law of God. Not a not a
[52:53] most of the time or not a tendency or
[52:55] not a usually, but a law God puts in a
[52:58] seed that every time when it brings
[53:01] forth life and it reproduces itself, it
[53:03] will bring forth the same kind of life
[53:05] that it came from. Amen. And there's a
[53:07] lifeline that runs down through the
[53:09] generations. Now, Amen. Now, it's a it's
[53:12] a powerful law, friends, and it's deep.
[53:14] Now, it's simple. It's a simple law, but
[53:16] it's deep. Amen. It actually is. Uh uh
[53:18] but and you can you can spend a lot of
[53:20] time looking into it. And people do, you
[53:23] know, you could spend a lot of time
[53:24] studying a seed and studying studying
[53:26] that process of life and and oh my, you
[53:29] think of you think of agriculture today
[53:31] and all of the science and all of the
[53:32] research and all the technology and
[53:34] chemistry and things that goes into the
[53:36] growing of our food, you know, and they
[53:38] they take it down to a lab and they've
[53:40] got, you know, and they they they they
[53:42] uh they they'll they'll splice genes and
[53:44] they can get down into the very DNA of
[53:46] the seed and and and and the nutrients
[53:48] of the soil and everything. And it's
[53:50] become so advanced and it's become so so
[53:52] technical and so you know so uh and it's
[53:55] it's so so deep. Amen. But at the end of
[53:58] the day, you know what happens? The
[53:59] farmer goes out in the field. He puts a
[54:01] seed in the ground and he lets God's law
[54:03] happen because you know no matter how
[54:05] much you can learn about it, how much
[54:06] you can try to meddle with it or tamper
[54:08] with it. At the end of the day, you got
[54:10] to put a seed in the ground and let
[54:12] God's law happen. And you can't go out
[54:14] the next day and dig up the seed and and
[54:16] try to see what's happening. Amen. try
[54:18] to peel it open and pull a flower out of
[54:20] it. It's got to go by God's law and by
[54:22] God's way. There's a process of time.
[54:24] Amen. But I'll tell you what, you don't
[54:26] have to worry about the process of time.
[54:28] A farmer doesn't plant corn and then
[54:30] worry that he's going to get potatoes.
[54:32] Amen. Because God has a law that every
[54:35] time you put a seed of corn in the
[54:37] ground, you'll get a a harvest of corn.
[54:40] Amen. Every time. Now uh we're going to
[54:42] try to bring it to where can understand
[54:44] the spiritual side of this. But brother
[54:45] Brandham preached a message called God's
[54:47] power to transform. Again we're talking
[54:49] about power today. God has power to
[54:52] transform. And one time I I was studying
[54:54] this message and and I thought well you
[54:56] know God's power to transform. I want to
[54:58] I want to know more about this transform
[54:59] God's power. I want to understand more
[55:01] about God's transformation you know. And
[55:04] so I began to study this message. Do you
[55:06] know the amazing thing? He spends almost
[55:07] the whole message, brother John, talking
[55:09] about a seed. And so there's a mystery
[55:11] in that. But brother man would say in
[55:13] this message, he said when he put the
[55:15] seed in the earth, let let's listen
[55:17] closely to this. When he put the seed in
[55:19] the earth, the seed can only come forth
[55:22] with the power of life within it. I I
[55:25] love that. To transform it from a seed
[55:27] to a plant or whatever it was, his
[55:30] transforming power. Now he said, now God
[55:33] put the seed in there with potential.
[55:36] Amen. That it would be what he said it
[55:38] would be. I'm not talking about acorns
[55:40] now. I'm talking about Christians. And
[55:42] as long as it stayed in its right
[55:44] category, it would be just exactly what
[55:46] God said it would be. And it had to be
[55:48] that way because he made it that way.
[55:51] And he made a channel that anything that
[55:54] stays in his channel, stays in his line
[55:56] of word, it will have to bring forth
[55:59] exactly like his word said it would do.
[56:02] Oh my. Amen. Now watch what now watch
[56:04] God's attitude toward it. He said, "Now
[56:06] then God said it's all good, so I'll
[56:09] just rest." God said, "I'll just rest."
[56:11] Amen. He remember he rested on that last
[56:14] day of creation. And he said, "And each
[56:16] of those seeds, now listen now, has
[56:18] power in itself to be to transform
[56:22] itself into the species that I desire it
[56:25] to be. That's what it must be because I
[56:29] have given every seed transforming power
[56:32] to make out of itself in its potentials
[56:35] now to make of itself exactly what I
[56:39] want it to be." Amen. Say, "Brother
[56:41] Nathan, I need power this morning. I
[56:43] need I need transforming power because
[56:45] I've got situations in my life that need
[56:47] a transformation and I I need my body
[56:50] transformed and I need my attitude
[56:52] transformed and I need some of my habits
[56:54] transformed. Well, brother, Amen.
[56:56] Listen, God has already provided
[56:58] transforming power to the Christian. He
[57:00] provided it when he put a seed of life
[57:03] within you by predestination and called
[57:05] you one of his children. Before there
[57:06] was a world, before there was sin,
[57:08] before there were struggles, God was
[57:10] thinking about each one of his children.
[57:12] Amen. But he planted them as a seed into
[57:15] this world. And when God planted the
[57:17] seed, Amen. He already knew that he
[57:19] would get out of that seed what he
[57:22] wanted it to be. Amen. He's not worried
[57:24] about it. It's us that's worried about
[57:26] it. We're worried about how we'll get
[57:28] through this next situation. We're
[57:29] worried about how we'll, you know, we'll
[57:31] get to the next level with God. We're
[57:33] worried about how we'll survive the
[57:34] tests and the tribulations and all those
[57:36] things. But let me tell you friends, God
[57:38] did not gain confidence in you when you
[57:40] came to an altar. He didn't. Amen. The
[57:42] first time you walked in the door of the
[57:43] church and Amen. and and you tried to
[57:45] turn over a new leaf and decided you'd
[57:47] be a better person. That's not when God
[57:49] gained his confidence in you. God has
[57:51] had confidence in every one of his
[57:53] children ever since he planted them.
[57:55] Amen. Ever since he carried them in his
[57:57] mind because God when he put a seed in
[57:59] you, he put a law in that seed. Amen.
[58:02] and that it can't help but become what
[58:04] he wanted it to be in the beginning.
[58:06] Amen. Cuz he put a law of life in the
[58:08] seed. He put his own life in you when he
[58:10] gave you the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[58:12] Amen. Not just for a tingle up and down
[58:14] your spine. Amen. And the 50 years of
[58:17] backsliding. Amen. No, it was to bring a
[58:20] life. Amen. Into you. Amen. That would
[58:22] begin to push up and begin to push out.
[58:25] Amen. And make you what God wanted you
[58:27] to be. There's none of God's children
[58:29] that don't have purpose. There's none of
[58:31] God's children that don't have a
[58:32] fragrance and a beauty to bring forth
[58:35] into this world. They're not the same,
[58:37] but they're all part of the bouquet.
[58:39] Amen. But listen, friends, God's not
[58:41] worried about getting out of his church
[58:43] what he wanted to get out of it. Amen.
[58:45] Cuz he put a law in the sea that in
[58:47] spite of you and me, Amen. We could not
[58:49] help, Amen. become into the image of
[58:52] what God had for us in his mind. Cuz the
[58:54] Bible says we are predestinated unto
[58:56] adoption. And it's a powerful thing,
[58:58] friends. And it gives us rest and it
[59:01] gives us peace when we understand amen
[59:03] that there's a husbandman. There's a
[59:05] there's a there's a God who knows how to
[59:07] grow a garden.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; He knows what he's doing. Friends, amen.
[59:11] See, that's God's power to transform.
[59:13] That's that power to become. Jesus said
[59:16] in John 1, as many as received him, to
[59:19] them gave he power to become the sons of
[59:22] God.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Power to become the sons of
[59:26] God. and say, "Brother Nathan, you ever
[59:28] felt weak?" I felt I Yeah, just this
[59:30] morning, actually. Amen. Every day of my
[59:33] life, we battle with of our lives. We
[59:35] battle with human weakness. We battle
[59:37] with our human frailty. We struggle. We
[59:39] make mistakes. We We often slip, as the
[59:41] song would say. Amen. But listen,
[59:43] friends. And yet, I believe that that
[59:45] somehow someway Nathan Ericson is going
[59:48] to become what God wanted Nathan Ericson
[59:50] to be. Amen. Because when I received
[59:52] Christ into my life, Christ came with
[59:55] power. And it was power to become a son
[59:58] of God. Amen. The power that's the power
[1:00:01] of a seed. And now I want you to notice
[1:00:03] it's a law, friends. Amen. Let me let me
[1:00:05] let me just put it very simply today.
[1:00:07] When God plants a seed, God expects a
[1:00:10] blossom.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. He expects it and he's not worried
[1:00:12] about it. The Bible says in Isaiah 55
[1:00:15] that the rain comes down out of heaven
[1:00:17] and he gives seed and bread.
[1:00:21] Now there's a process of seed becoming
[1:00:23] bread but the same rain brings it
[1:00:25] brother. Amen. And so and he said so the
[1:00:28] rain comes down and gives seed to the
[1:00:29] sewer. It gives bread to the eater. He
[1:00:31] said so shall my word be that goeth out
[1:00:33] of my mouth. It will not return to me
[1:00:36] void. He said it will accomplish what I
[1:00:40] please. Amen. Amen. And it shall prosper
[1:00:43] in the thing whereto I sent it. You know
[1:00:45] sometimes the Holy Ghost in your life.
[1:00:47] Amen. Things come to pass in the
[1:00:49] Christian journey and it doesn't
[1:00:50] necessarily please us and we go through
[1:00:52] disappointments and we wonder why and we
[1:00:54] ask questions. But listen, God is going
[1:00:56] to get out what he pleased. Amen. That's
[1:00:59] why he sent He sent the Holy Spirit.
[1:01:01] Amen. He sent his word. Amen. That it
[1:01:03] would accomplish. He said, "And prosper
[1:01:06] in the thing whereto I sent it." Amen.
[1:01:09] And I believe today that God has sent a
[1:01:11] message of adoption into this age. Amen.
[1:01:13] He sent us such a message, friends, and
[1:01:15] and and broke the seals off of the word
[1:01:17] of God. He sent that. Amen. And when he
[1:01:20] sent it, he was expecting manifested
[1:01:22] sons. And some people look around, they
[1:01:24] look at the state of things and the
[1:01:26] community of the message, and they look
[1:01:28] at the the negative side of things and
[1:01:30] church issues and and mistakes of
[1:01:32] ministry and and and situations and and
[1:01:35] drama, you know, good oldfashioned drama
[1:01:37] between human beings. and and they look
[1:01:39] at all those things and become
[1:01:40] discouraged and say, "Well, brother
[1:01:42] Nathan, I'm just worried about things.
[1:01:43] I'm worried that this message will just
[1:01:45] kind of fizzle out. And I'm worried this
[1:01:47] next generation won't be able to carry
[1:01:49] on the torch. And I'm worried that the
[1:01:51] influences of the world will be too
[1:01:52] great. And I'm worried because I see all
[1:01:54] these I see all these difficulties, you
[1:01:56] know, in the community." And Amen. But
[1:01:58] listen, friends, uh, Amen. God sent a
[1:02:00] message expecting a result. And God will
[1:02:03] get a result. Now, now the thing is,
[1:02:04] we're looking at the husk sometimes.
[1:02:06] Amen. People become discouraged and
[1:02:08] disillusioned because they say, "Well,
[1:02:10] we've got we've got problems in the
[1:02:12] organization." But listen friends, God
[1:02:15] didn't send a message to the
[1:02:16] organization. He sent the message to an
[1:02:19] individual. He's not just trying to get
[1:02:21] to the group, to the church. He's trying
[1:02:23] to get to the heart of a person. Amen.
[1:02:26] So he can find the seed that he planted
[1:02:28] there and bring it forth. Oh my. The
[1:02:30] message, I don't care if the message
[1:02:32] didn't work for this church or that
[1:02:33] church or or that organization or this
[1:02:35] organization. It'll work for a heart.
[1:02:37] Amen. It'll work for an individual.
[1:02:39] It'll work for you, brother, sister,
[1:02:41] because it's God's word. And when he
[1:02:43] said his word, he planted it in this
[1:02:45] world. And he wasn't worried about a
[1:02:46] bride taking a rapture. Amen. He knew it
[1:02:49] would bring forth a rapture. He knew it
[1:02:51] would bring forth manifested sons
[1:02:53] because there's a law in the seed that
[1:02:54] was planted.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; A law of life. Amen. And it'll prosper
[1:02:59] in the thing whereto I sent it. I want
[1:03:01] you to know it's a law today. It cannot
[1:03:03] fail. It's an infallible law of God. Oh
[1:03:07] my. You say, you know, Brother Nathan,
[1:03:10] well, the thing is, I'm looking at this
[1:03:12] great call of the hour. I've been
[1:03:14] listening to the message, Brother
[1:03:15] Nathan, and it's and it's painting a
[1:03:16] picture of a bride church, and you know,
[1:03:19] Brother Bam said she'd be an invincible
[1:03:20] army, and she would do the greater
[1:03:22] works, and she'd have a she'd have
[1:03:24] adoption authority, and you know, she'd
[1:03:26] she'd have all these things. And and and
[1:03:27] and I'm looking at this picture in my
[1:03:29] mind of this great, beautiful, perfect
[1:03:31] church. And then I'm looking at me,
[1:03:33] Brother Nathan, and I'm so small and I'm
[1:03:35] so humble and I feel like, it's not that
[1:03:37] I don't know the Lord or haven't had an
[1:03:39] experience with God, but I feel like
[1:03:41] I've only got a little Jesus.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; I've only got a little Jesus today. And
[1:03:45] out of everybody in the church, I've got
[1:03:47] the least amount of Jesus. Amen. Well,
[1:03:49] listen friends, the thing about little
[1:03:51] Jesus, you know, Brother Bram said, God
[1:03:53] doesn't have little weak spots in him
[1:03:56] and and great big heavy spots that are
[1:03:57] powerful and little spots that are weak.
[1:03:59] Brother Bram said, "The least touch of
[1:04:01] God is omnipotent." Another time he said
[1:04:04] that when the weakest of Christians goes
[1:04:06] to their knees, hell trembles. Amen.
[1:04:08] Amen. He said, "If you're the skin on
[1:04:10] the on the bottom of his toe," Amen.
[1:04:13] Amen. Then then you know you then you're
[1:04:15] still over every demon out of hell.
[1:04:17] Amen. There's no such thing as a little
[1:04:19] Jesus that's not a powerful Jesus. Amen.
[1:04:22] Little Jesus one day he went down to the
[1:04:24] you know, we think we don't know
[1:04:25] anything. Amen. And we don't we think we
[1:04:27] don't understand all the mysteries and
[1:04:28] things. But little Jesus went down to
[1:04:30] the temple one day and he began to talk
[1:04:32] to all of the great theologians of that
[1:04:34] time and sit down with the priest and
[1:04:36] Amen. He began to talk circles around
[1:04:38] him. Amen. Not that not because he was
[1:04:40] educated, not because he knew a lot, but
[1:04:42] because of who he was and the life that
[1:04:44] was in him and the revelation of who he
[1:04:46] was. Amen. He talked rings around those
[1:04:48] guys. That's what little Jesus did.
[1:04:50] Because little Jesus to this morning is
[1:04:53] still Jehovah Jesus. And if you only got
[1:04:56] a little Jesus, I want you to know it's
[1:04:58] still healer Jesus. He's still deliver
[1:05:00] Jesus. He's still comfort Jesus. He's
[1:05:02] still victory Jesus. He's still peace
[1:05:04] Jesus. He's everything you need Jesus.
[1:05:07] He's a provider Jesus. That's what
[1:05:09] little Jesus is. But little Jesus will
[1:05:12] not stay little. Amen. Brother Bram
[1:05:14] said, "When a man or woman gets born
[1:05:16] again, a little bit button of light," he
[1:05:18] said, "Just about the size of a button
[1:05:20] on your shirt." Just a little bit of
[1:05:22] light, a button of light comes into that
[1:05:24] person. Amen. But the thing about that
[1:05:26] little button of light, that little bit
[1:05:27] of Jesus, he says, "What happens is that
[1:05:30] little bit of light comes into all of
[1:05:31] your darkness and then it begins to grow
[1:05:34] and then it begins, oh my, you think,
[1:05:36] you think you can't do anything with
[1:05:37] that little Jesus. Get that little Jesus
[1:05:39] down to church. Get it in the atmosphere
[1:05:41] of worship. Get it under the ministry of
[1:05:43] the word. Watch what happens. Little
[1:05:45] Jesus begins to expand. And little Jesus
[1:05:47] begins to push. And you know what'll
[1:05:49] happen? All of a sudden, that little
[1:05:50] button, amen, gets big enough, it starts
[1:05:52] pushing on your depression. And it
[1:05:54] starts pushing on those filthy habits.
[1:05:56] And it starts pushing down on your on on
[1:05:58] on your bad attitude. And it just begins
[1:06:01] to take over. It begins to push out. And
[1:06:03] before you know it, it pushes out sin.
[1:06:05] It'll push out it'll push out worry. It
[1:06:08] pushes out restlessness. It pushes out
[1:06:10] anxiety. And it begins. That's what
[1:06:12] little Jesus does. Cuz brother, it's a
[1:06:14] seed. And there was a law in that seed
[1:06:16] when he planted it in your life. Amen.
[1:06:19] That it couldn't stay as little as it
[1:06:20] was. It had to grow. And if you've ever
[1:06:23] met the quickening power, you've got
[1:06:25] something that's going to grow. Amen.
[1:06:28] It's not going to stay not going to stay
[1:06:29] the same. It might have been so, you
[1:06:31] know, it seemed so insignificant when it
[1:06:33] came to life, but from that time,
[1:06:36] something was set into motion. A law. A
[1:06:38] law of life.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, uh uh uh the first
[1:06:42] house we had when we left Michigan and
[1:06:44] moved to Ohio down in Finley, Ohio, I
[1:06:47] had uh I I lived in town, an older
[1:06:49] house, and it had this ugly old fence
[1:06:51] just falling apart around the backyard.
[1:06:53] And I thought, my that's an ugly fence.
[1:06:55] And I got to do something to pretty this
[1:06:57] up, you know, and uh I couldn't I didn't
[1:06:59] want to get a new fence cuz fences ain't
[1:07:01] cheap, you know. So, I said, 'What I'll
[1:07:03] do is I'll get a nice flowering vine and
[1:07:06] I'll plant it on that fence and let it
[1:07:08] let it grow across that fence and
[1:07:10] that'll pretty it up real good and you
[1:07:11] know that'll kind of take care of the
[1:07:12] issue and out of sight, out of mind. And
[1:07:14] so, I went down to Menard's, bless God,
[1:07:17] and uh and I found a little I found a a
[1:07:20] little packet of seeds called morning
[1:07:22] glory. If any of you are gardeners,
[1:07:24] you're already laughing at me.
[1:07:27] A little seed called morning glory. And
[1:07:28] I thought I like the sound of that, that
[1:07:30] morning glory. I'm going to get me some
[1:07:31] of that. So, I bought a packet I think a
[1:07:34] couple packets of it and I went home and
[1:07:36] I read on the packet said just take one
[1:07:38] seed every 6 in. And I thought I bought
[1:07:41] tons of this stuff. So, I took that
[1:07:44] packet of seed and I went down my fence
[1:07:45] and I just sprinkled those seeds all the
[1:07:47] way down the fence row. You know what?
[1:07:50] Nothing happened that day. Nothing
[1:07:51] happened the next day. Amen. But after a
[1:07:54] little season of time, maybe a week and
[1:07:56] maybe a month, all of a sudden, signs of
[1:07:57] life begin to appear. And Amen. And that
[1:08:00] morning glory starts to come and it
[1:08:02] began to it began to grow up my fence
[1:08:03] and just in no time, brother Bruce, it
[1:08:05] had filled up that whole fence and I
[1:08:07] thought, "Praise the Lord, that's
[1:08:08] exactly where I wanted it was on the
[1:08:10] fence." The problem with morning glory,
[1:08:12] it won't stay on the fence. Amen. But it
[1:08:14] came off the fence and it began to, you
[1:08:16] know, it's just like sometimes we think,
[1:08:17] well, I'll go down to church and I'm
[1:08:19] just going to, you know, I'll go down on
[1:08:21] Sunday and then the rest of the week
[1:08:22] I'll do whatever I want to, but I I need
[1:08:24] to kind of have a nice, you know, I need
[1:08:26] to adopt a nice Christian appearance and
[1:08:28] and try to clean up my life a little bit
[1:08:30] and I'll just go down to church and I'll
[1:08:32] get a little bit of Jesus. You watch out
[1:08:33] now. Amen. It won't stay. You really get
[1:08:36] an experience with God. It won't stay
[1:08:37] where you want it. But what it did was
[1:08:39] it began to push out. It went into my
[1:08:41] yard. It went up the tree. It went up
[1:08:43] the side of my house. It went up the
[1:08:44] side of my garage and it got into my
[1:08:46] vegetable garden and it started at the
[1:08:48] bottom of my tomato plants and it went
[1:08:49] all the way to the tippy top of those
[1:08:52] tomatoes. Weeds couldn't grow in my
[1:08:54] garden. Amen. Cuz it was too full of
[1:08:56] morning glory. And brother, that's
[1:08:58] that's what God has done for his
[1:09:00] children. Amen. He planted something in
[1:09:02] you. Amen. Expecting it to take over.
[1:09:04] Amen. You we struggle with things. We go
[1:09:07] through darkness. Amen. We have trials
[1:09:09] and temptations. Amen. But there's a
[1:09:11] life on the inside, amen, that's pushing
[1:09:13] out, amen, and it's beginning to come
[1:09:15] into friction with the darkness of our
[1:09:17] life. And it won't rest, friends, until
[1:09:19] it makes you, Amen, what God wanted you
[1:09:22] to be. You can rest in it. You can rest
[1:09:24] assured. I'm convinced today, Amen, you
[1:09:27] could drop a nuclear bomb on Finley,
[1:09:29] Ohio. You could erase every memory of
[1:09:32] Nathan Ericson, but next spring that
[1:09:33] morning glory is coming back. By now, it
[1:09:36] probably took over that whole
[1:09:37] neighborhood. That's what the Amen.
[1:09:39] That's what the bride of Christ has got.
[1:09:41] It's the glory of God. Rise and shine.
[1:09:44] Your light has come.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. It's the rising of the sun.
[1:09:50] See, there's only one limitation on how
[1:09:52] far a seed can grow. That is the season
[1:09:55] that it's in.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; And I and and listen friends, we've come
[1:09:58] to a time, there's never been a day like
[1:10:00] this day. Brother Bran would say that
[1:10:03] the church has come. She's not in the
[1:10:05] season of justification under Luther.
[1:10:07] She's not in the season of
[1:10:08] sanctification under Wesley. Amen. And
[1:10:10] she's not. She's beyond the season of
[1:10:12] the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy
[1:10:14] Ghost. Brother Bram says, "Now we're in
[1:10:15] the blossom. Now it's sons coming to
[1:10:18] maturity. Now it's adoption time,
[1:10:20] rapture time. It's the end time,
[1:10:22] friends." And so in a season like that,
[1:10:25] I want you to see there is no limit.
[1:10:28] Amen. There's no limits on how far the
[1:10:30] Holy Ghost can take a genuine uh born
[1:10:33] again child of God. Amen. because the
[1:10:35] limits have been taken off. It is time
[1:10:37] to come to fullness. It's time for
[1:10:39] maturity. Amen. It's time for the
[1:10:41] fullness of adoption. Friends, we're in
[1:10:44] the blossom. It's Easter time. It's time
[1:10:46] to rise. Now, now take your idea today.
[1:10:49] Amen. Uh in your mind, you got a certain
[1:10:51] idea of of the ceiling of your
[1:10:53] potential. You got it in your mind. This
[1:10:55] is as far as I'll probably ever go with
[1:10:57] God. This is the most I'm ever capable
[1:10:59] of. This is the closest I'll ever be to
[1:11:01] him. This is the most I'll ever serve
[1:11:03] him. Let me tell you something. Throw it
[1:11:05] out today. Amen. Because we're living in
[1:11:07] a time of untapped potential. Amen.
[1:11:09] We're living in the blossom, friends.
[1:11:11] And whatever your idea is of what God
[1:11:13] can do through you, it's probably too
[1:11:15] small.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm talking about a mighty God. I'm
[1:11:18] not preaching a charismatic idea of of,
[1:11:20] you know, uh, well, you you know,
[1:11:21] everybody's got to have a worldwide
[1:11:23] ministry and drive a Cadillac and and
[1:11:25] and and all those kind of things. No,
[1:11:27] you know, or be a great big somebody.
[1:11:29] No, I'm talking about the bride. I'm
[1:11:31] talking about little nobbodyies who can
[1:11:33] do the greater works of God. Little
[1:11:35] nobbodyies who can who can bring a life
[1:11:37] in a blossom. That can be a fragrance
[1:11:39] where people don't even have to speak a
[1:11:40] word to you, but they can tell you're a
[1:11:42] Christian. Amen. Where there's an
[1:11:44] atmosphere to your life where somebody
[1:11:45] know more than take you by the hand and
[1:11:47] they feel God's presence wash over them.
[1:11:49] Amen. I'm talking about lives in
[1:11:51] blossom. Friends, that's what I want to
[1:11:52] be. That's all I want in this world is
[1:11:54] to reach my potential. Amen. and be what
[1:11:57] God thought about me before the
[1:11:59] foundation of the world. Hallelujah.
[1:12:02] It's time to rise, friends.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; It's time for liies to come forth.
[1:12:06] Brother Brandham preached a wonderful,
[1:12:08] wonderful, every Easter, he would talk
[1:12:10] about that lily just about. And uh and
[1:12:12] he I thought it was amazing. He uses
[1:12:14] that pond lily of all the liies. He
[1:12:16] takes a pond lily and talks about how
[1:12:18] that pond lily starts out way in the
[1:12:20] bottom of a pond, buried down in the
[1:12:22] dirt somewhere in a dark and filthy
[1:12:24] place.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. It's it's it's filthy. It's
[1:12:28] dirty. Talking about where some of you
[1:12:30] came from. And when you pass over that
[1:12:33] little seed, when you look at it, you
[1:12:35] can't tell the difference between that
[1:12:36] little seed and all of the earth around
[1:12:39] it. It might have been laying there in a
[1:12:41] drug den or a or an alley or a or a or
[1:12:43] or wherever it was, you know, a broken
[1:12:46] home or a broken church or whatever it
[1:12:48] came out and you looked at it. You could
[1:12:50] not tell the difference between the seed
[1:12:51] and the dirt. There was Amen. just by
[1:12:53] looking at it. But but there was comes a
[1:12:56] time where somehow someway a little ray
[1:12:58] of light bounces down through all of
[1:13:00] that darkness and strikes that little
[1:13:02] seed just right. And when it hits that
[1:13:05] seed, something happens, a quickening.
[1:13:07] Now, when that seed was quickened, and
[1:13:09] it wasn't necessarily a big explosion,
[1:13:11] it didn't necessarily heave up the
[1:13:13] bottom of that pond, you know, and and
[1:13:14] everybody, the whole world didn't take
[1:13:16] notice of what happened, but the seed
[1:13:17] knew something had happened. There was a
[1:13:20] little awakening. There was a little
[1:13:21] change. There was a Oh, there was a
[1:13:23] quickening. Amen. And then from that
[1:13:25] time, something in the seed, a little
[1:13:27] voice began to speak and say, "Higher,
[1:13:29] higher, further, upward." Amen.
[1:13:32] Something up there is pulling me. Amen.
[1:13:34] I got to find out where that little ray
[1:13:36] of light came from. And so it begins to
[1:13:38] push out. It begins to fight through all
[1:13:40] that filth. And oh, it's dirty. You
[1:13:42] know, it's down there. It's just covered
[1:13:43] in all the filthy things of the world,
[1:13:46] but it's fighting and it's struggling
[1:13:48] and it pushes and it claws until one day
[1:13:50] there's a breakthrough. Oh my. Amen. You
[1:13:54] know, the problem is sometimes
[1:13:55] Christians, they they they come to the
[1:13:57] church, they get a real experience with
[1:13:59] God, and God really really does
[1:14:01] something for them, and then the next
[1:14:02] day they turn around, they find out
[1:14:03] they're still a human being. They still
[1:14:05] got issues. They still got struggles.
[1:14:07] And then they begin to think, well,
[1:14:08] maybe there was nothing to my
[1:14:09] breakthrough. Cuz that's what the little
[1:14:11] lily did. It broke through. And then,
[1:14:13] Brother John, it was still at the bottom
[1:14:14] of a pond.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; And so, it breaks through out of all
[1:14:18] that filth. And it comes into a into the
[1:14:20] realm of sanctification. Amen. Where
[1:14:22] it's living a holy life and amen. And
[1:14:24] it's and it's trying to do right and
[1:14:26] trying to dress right, trying to act
[1:14:27] right and talk right and all those
[1:14:29] things, but it's under pressure and
[1:14:31] there's a pressure on it. And then
[1:14:33] there's there's a every time the the
[1:14:35] currents come, there's all this
[1:14:36] influence on that little lily. Amen. and
[1:14:39] all the turning of the tides and times
[1:14:41] come and go and influences of the world
[1:14:43] and it's pushed this way and then it's
[1:14:45] pushed that way and it just seems like
[1:14:47] it doesn't have the strength to resist
[1:14:49] the pressure. Amen. And you know, you
[1:14:51] know, in church it feels like a
[1:14:52] Christian and then Monday morning at
[1:14:54] school, you know, friends come up and
[1:14:56] they they say, "Well, let's go do this
[1:14:58] or let's talk about that." And it just
[1:14:59] caves to the pressure. Amen. You know,
[1:15:02] because it's under pressure. Amen. and
[1:15:04] it's looking around maybe maybe uh you
[1:15:06] know some of you live through that stage
[1:15:08] in your life and you're looking around
[1:15:09] at people around you and co-workers and
[1:15:11] schoolmates and and it seems like they
[1:15:13] don't care they just go with the flow
[1:15:16] just kind of like uh you know that uh I
[1:15:18] call it seaweed but it's fresh water but
[1:15:20] you know you go to the streams around
[1:15:21] here and stuff and you know the plant
[1:15:23] I'm talking about where the where the
[1:15:24] water's running fast and shallow and
[1:15:26] that that seaweed's just
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; you know and then then the spring rain
[1:15:32] comes and the current reverses and then
[1:15:33] it
[1:15:36] And
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; that's most people of the world. They
[1:15:37] just go with the flow. They're because
[1:15:39] they're made for shallow water. But not
[1:15:41] this lily. Cuz a lily's got a structure
[1:15:43] to it. It's got a strength. And it it it
[1:15:46] feels the influence of the tides, but
[1:15:48] something in it is saying, "No, but I
[1:15:50] belong in a higher place than this. I'm
[1:15:52] not made to be just pushed and pulled by
[1:15:54] everything that comes and goes in the
[1:15:56] world." Amen. I'm going up higher. Amen.
[1:15:58] And so it pushes, it swims, it fights.
[1:16:01] Amen. It finally gets up into the top.
[1:16:03] Amen. And feels that ray of sun. Amen.
[1:16:06] Amen. Not just a little ray of light
[1:16:08] that found it down in the dark. Amen.
[1:16:10] But but the full presence of the sun.
[1:16:13] Amen. And it begins under that
[1:16:14] influence. It begins to it begins to
[1:16:16] open up its blossom and relax and rest.
[1:16:19] And then it brings out a fragrance and
[1:16:21] everybody around the pond, amen, can
[1:16:24] enjoy the beauty coming out of that
[1:16:26] flower. Amen. Why? Because it stood the
[1:16:29] test of time and it proved what it was
[1:16:30] in the first place. Brother Bram said,
[1:16:33] "That's the overcomer." Now, now, you
[1:16:35] know, people can't look at that
[1:16:36] overcomer and say, "Yeah, but I remember
[1:16:38] what I remember what she was up to when
[1:16:40] the Lord got her." Yeah, I remember what
[1:16:42] she came from. Oh, I remember what kind
[1:16:44] of church he went to, and I remember the
[1:16:46] situations that happened. I remember
[1:16:48] what that family did back then and the
[1:16:50] way they were living. Brother Bram said,
[1:16:51] "You can't say that now. You can't say,
[1:16:54] well, you know, well, he came out of the
[1:16:55] mud." But brother Brand said, "But he's
[1:16:56] not in the mud now. He's on top." Amen.
[1:16:59] Amen. Oh my. He's an overcomer. You
[1:17:01] can't point at what he was, but what is
[1:17:03] he now? He's on top. Oh, amen. Some of
[1:17:06] you today, you fought through all manner
[1:17:08] of hell to be sitting here today
[1:17:10] worshiping the Lord. Amen. But listen,
[1:17:12] what was it that kept you? You know, it
[1:17:14] wasn't you that kept yourself, but there
[1:17:16] was a law of life within you. There was
[1:17:18] a seed, amen, that was that was craving
[1:17:21] higher things. It was craving a closer
[1:17:23] walk with God. And so, it pushed you up
[1:17:25] out of where you were to bring you to
[1:17:27] the house of God. Now, what a beautiful
[1:17:29] picture of the overcomer. Friends, who
[1:17:31] you are is not what you've come through.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Who you are is not where you've been.
[1:17:37] Amen. Who you are, Amen, is where you
[1:17:40] came from. Amen. It's the life that
[1:17:43] birthed you into this world. That's who
[1:17:44] you are.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You know, it's a powerful
[1:17:48] sermon talking about this overcoming
[1:17:50] lily. But it strikes the heart different
[1:17:54] to somebody who's down in the dirt or
[1:17:56] somebody in your life you say, "Brother
[1:17:58] Nathan, I'm identifying more with I feel
[1:18:00] like I'm under so much pressure and push
[1:18:02] this way and push that way and got no
[1:18:03] strength to stand and overcome and I
[1:18:05] feel like I'm one of those seaweed,
[1:18:07] Brother Nathan. And most some days I
[1:18:08] feel like I'm drowning. I just feel like
[1:18:11] I'm drowning trying to be a Christian in
[1:18:13] this world." But look, friends, here's
[1:18:15] what you got to get a hold of. You say,
[1:18:17] "Well, I look at this one. I look at
[1:18:18] that one and I see their life is in
[1:18:20] blossom and I can I can feel the
[1:18:22] presence of the Lord coming off of them
[1:18:23] and I see the character and I see the
[1:18:24] maturity and I look at myself, brother
[1:18:26] Nathan, I'm in the dirt. I'm in the
[1:18:28] water. I'm drowning. But listen friends,
[1:18:31] when that little seed when it was just a
[1:18:33] little when it was a little sprout of
[1:18:34] life just clawing up and just struggling
[1:18:37] helplessly against a bunch of filthy
[1:18:39] things. Amen. It was still a lily. And
[1:18:42] when it was down there in the water
[1:18:44] looking at all the seaweed and thinking,
[1:18:45] I wish I could just be like everybody
[1:18:46] else. It was It wasn't like everybody
[1:18:48] else. It was still a lily. Amen. And it
[1:18:50] was a See, it was a lily when it was a
[1:18:52] seed. It was a lily when it was a
[1:18:54] sprout. It was a lily when it was a
[1:18:55] vine. It was a lily when it's a flower.
[1:18:57] It's a lily the whole time. That's what
[1:18:59] you got to see, friends. It's the same
[1:19:01] life. Amen. It's the same Holy Ghost
[1:19:03] that birthed you in the first place is
[1:19:05] the same comforter who leads you to her
[1:19:07] adoption. Amen. The Holy Ghost that
[1:19:09] birthed you is able to help you grow.
[1:19:12] He's able to help you get through all
[1:19:13] adversity. He's help you. He's able to
[1:19:15] get you up on top if you'll trust him.
[1:19:18] He put a law of life within you. Amen.
[1:19:20] God's not worried about it. We're
[1:19:22] worried about it. But God knows how to
[1:19:24] get out of you what he put there. Amen.
[1:19:27] Don't worry, friends. On your best day,
[1:19:29] you're a child of God. But on your worst
[1:19:31] day, you're still a child of God.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. Brother Bram would say he
[1:19:36] talked about uh in the restoration of
[1:19:38] the bride tree, he talks about the law
[1:19:40] of life, you know, and uh I wish I had
[1:19:42] more time to get into it, but he'll talk
[1:19:43] about a fish, you know, a fish has a law
[1:19:45] of life in it. It's made for a certain
[1:19:47] environment.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; It's made to swim in the water. Now, he
[1:19:51] said, now that fish might make up his
[1:19:52] mind, I'm going to be I'm really going
[1:19:54] to be something. I'm not going to be
[1:19:56] like the other fish. I'm going to get a
[1:19:57] big deep breath of air and I'm going to
[1:19:58] go up there in the air and I'm going to
[1:20:00] be with all the humans. You know, he
[1:20:02] said, "Well, what'll happen? That fish
[1:20:03] will burst." because he's not made to
[1:20:05] breathe air. He's made to breathe in the
[1:20:07] water.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he's made for. And
[1:20:09] there's a law of life in him. He talked
[1:20:11] about a tree. He said a tree might
[1:20:13] decide, well, you know, I'm not going to
[1:20:14] be like the rest of the trees. I'm going
[1:20:15] to grow out in the middle of the
[1:20:16] intersection like so I can really
[1:20:18] everybody can see me and I can really be
[1:20:19] somebody important. He said, but but no,
[1:20:21] a tree is not made to grow in the
[1:20:23] concrete. He's made to grow in the dirt.
[1:20:25] And so, you know, and so watch now what
[1:20:27] I'm trying to say, amen, is that there's
[1:20:30] a law of life. And brother Bram said,
[1:20:31] we've got a law of life. And it so he
[1:20:34] said now it's not how we fight. It's not
[1:20:37] how we pull. It's not how we hurry. How
[1:20:40] many have been in a hurry to be a real
[1:20:42] overcoming Christian? You've been in a
[1:20:43] hurry. You know that people get, you
[1:20:46] know, that's what happens sometimes.
[1:20:47] People get converted and they get a lot
[1:20:49] of zeal for the Lord. Next thing they
[1:20:50] do, you know, like they they they got
[1:20:52] born again Monday and they want to be
[1:20:54] pastor in a church Friday, you know, or
[1:20:56] they want to be this or that. And so
[1:20:57] they just want to skip to the end and
[1:20:59] get in a hurry and I just go out and do
[1:21:01] really do something. But brother
[1:21:02] Brandham said it's not what we how we
[1:21:04] fight and pull and hurry and say if I
[1:21:06] don't get this and if I don't get that.
[1:21:08] That's not it. He said it's to know that
[1:21:10] the law of life is in you.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you just let go and let
[1:21:14] God. He takes it to a bird. It's not a
[1:21:16] bird says maybe if I run real fast and I
[1:21:18] just flap real hard then I'll fly. Amen.
[1:21:21] That's what a lot of Christians try to
[1:21:22] do. They say, "If I just try really
[1:21:24] hard, if I really make up my mind that
[1:21:26] this time it's going to be different and
[1:21:28] I'm really going to get somewhere and
[1:21:29] I'm really going to pull the blessings
[1:21:30] out of heaven, you know, and just try
[1:21:33] work real hard." That's not how birds
[1:21:34] fly. They got a law of life in them.
[1:21:37] They're made a certain way. They just
[1:21:38] put their wings out and catch that
[1:21:40] breeze. Amen. And it's the And the law
[1:21:42] of life lifts them up all by itself.
[1:21:44] They don't have to work and strive and
[1:21:46] struggle. Amen. They just they just they
[1:21:49] follow the law of life that's in them.
[1:21:51] Listen, friends. Amen. You just let go,
[1:21:53] Brother Brham said, and let God. And
[1:21:55] then he takes you to your healing. He
[1:21:58] takes you to the baptism of the spirit.
[1:22:00] Oh my. Or anything that he's promised,
[1:22:02] he said, any claim that he's given is
[1:22:04] yours by letting go and letting God.
[1:22:08] Amen. Oh yeah. You know, brother Brand,
[1:22:11] preach, see, it's not, that's what
[1:22:14] yielding is. Yielding isn't trying to be
[1:22:16] something you're not.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Yielding is being exactly who you are.
[1:22:20] Amen. But trusting that law of life on
[1:22:22] the inside, you get mixed up in
[1:22:24] something you know you're not supposed
[1:22:25] to be. Amen. And that law of life is
[1:22:27] speaking to you on the inside. That
[1:22:28] little voice says, "No, that's not for
[1:22:30] you. That might be for him or her.
[1:22:32] That's not for you." Amen. You're made
[1:22:34] for You're made for higher things. Then
[1:22:37] you just yield to that. You say, "Yeah,
[1:22:38] that's right, Lord. I'm going to That's
[1:22:40] the law of life on. Thank you for that
[1:22:42] voice, God." Amen. Because that's
[1:22:43] calling me up higher. Amen. That's
[1:22:46] bringing me into what I what I'm
[1:22:47] supposed to be. Amen. And it's not how
[1:22:49] much we try as Christians and worry and
[1:22:51] fret and fuss and try to muster up
[1:22:53] something. That ain't it at all.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; It's rest.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; And and rest, friends, you know, it's a
[1:22:59] there's a paradox there. Brother
[1:23:01] Brandham preached that message, Reverend
[1:23:02] Mr. Lily, he talks about it a lot. And I
[1:23:05] was thinking about it one time. He gets
[1:23:06] real real paints a real colorful picture
[1:23:09] of a lily and how that lily, you know,
[1:23:11] for it to overcome, you know, brother
[1:23:13] John, that lily has got to toil. He said
[1:23:15] it's got to fight and spin and claw.
[1:23:17] cuts up way out of the dirt and just
[1:23:19] fight and and struggle to get get out of
[1:23:22] that dirt and be a lily. Oh yeah. He and
[1:23:25] you know how this lily has to toil. And
[1:23:27] I thought, what an amazing picture. And
[1:23:28] then I went and read what Jesus said. He
[1:23:30] said, "Consider the lily.
[1:23:32] They toil not. That's right.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Neither do they spin." I thought, "Well,
[1:23:36] there's a paradox, Brother Bruce." And I
[1:23:38] began to think about it. Amen. The Holy
[1:23:40] Spirit just showed it to me in a certain
[1:23:41] way is that Yeah. Yeah. That lily,
[1:23:44] there's a struggle to its life. It's a
[1:23:46] It has things that it has to press
[1:23:47] through. It has things that it has to
[1:23:49] toil a and spin to come up out of the
[1:23:51] ground, but it doesn't have to toil to
[1:23:53] be a lily.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; And friends, that's the way it is for
[1:23:56] you. You never worked one day in your
[1:23:58] life to be a son or daughter of God. You
[1:24:00] never earned it. It was never merited.
[1:24:02] It was God's grace, amen, to make you
[1:24:05] what you are. You don't have to worry
[1:24:06] about it, friends. Just be what God made
[1:24:08] you. You can't make somebody a seed. And
[1:24:10] if they're seed, you can't make them not
[1:24:11] a seed. Amen. You cannot undo in time
[1:24:14] what God has done in eternity. Just
[1:24:16] trust the law of life within you. Oh,
[1:24:18] amen. I believe God knew when he sent
[1:24:21] the gospel that he was dealing with
[1:24:23] human beings. So, he sent a gospel.
[1:24:25] Amen. Not for angels. It's a gospel for
[1:24:28] human beings with human problems and
[1:24:30] human struggles and human issues. God
[1:24:33] knows what he's dealing with.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; He knew what he was choosing when he
[1:24:36] chose you.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; And he knows what to do with you,
[1:24:39] friends. You It lily doesn't have to
[1:24:41] work to be a lily. And you don't have to
[1:24:43] work to be a Christian. Amen. And yet a
[1:24:46] Christian works. And yet a Christian
[1:24:48] struggles. But the toil is not trying to
[1:24:51] you're not you're not trying to be a
[1:24:53] Christian.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; You are a Christian.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; And you're just a Christian that's
[1:24:57] trying to please God.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, when it that that picture
[1:25:02] you get that it changes everything
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; about the Christian walk.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Listen, if you're a son now, the Bible
[1:25:09] says now we're the sons of God. If
[1:25:11] you're a son, manifestation will come.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Because if you're his son, then you have
[1:25:16] his potential.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandaman, birth painans.
[1:25:20] That's what we're talking about. The
[1:25:21] struggle of bringing forth life. He
[1:25:23] preached the sermon birth pains. And he
[1:25:25] said that little seed bursts open into
[1:25:26] life now. But he said it can't do that
[1:25:29] until it comes through all that process.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a process, friends. It's
[1:25:34] got to come through that. And he said,
[1:25:36] "But that's what makes it." He said,
[1:25:38] "Because the sun itself is what's
[1:25:40] drawing it." Amen. And when it gets
[1:25:43] fully above the dirty waters and muck
[1:25:45] and so forth, then it's so happy. It
[1:25:47] gives its life out freely. And it's a
[1:25:49] beautiful life.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; A beautiful life when it gets in the
[1:25:53] presence of that which is drawing it up.
[1:25:55] And amen. That's the promise that the
[1:25:57] word of God makes to you, friends. Now,
[1:25:59] I know that there's so many people sit
[1:26:00] in churches and and I sat there for a
[1:26:02] long time in my life. It it ain't about
[1:26:04] whether it's a good church or a good
[1:26:06] pastor. It's just the way we are as
[1:26:08] human beings. We got to come through the
[1:26:09] process. But we sit in a church
[1:26:11] miserable. Amen. Unhappy. Amen. Just
[1:26:15] just burdened. Amen. Because, you know,
[1:26:17] we're stuck in a terrible place halfway
[1:26:20] between God and the world in a horrible
[1:26:22] place called religion. And it's
[1:26:24] miserable there. And it's work there and
[1:26:26] it's toil and it's struggle and there's
[1:26:28] burdens there. But listen friends,
[1:26:30] there's more to the Christian life than
[1:26:31] that. Amen. It's not just the outer
[1:26:33] court and an inner court of of of
[1:26:35] churchianity. Amen. But there's a holy
[1:26:38] of holies. There's a there's a place.
[1:26:40] Amen. Where God can take the Christian
[1:26:42] life. Amen. Amen. Where there's mana
[1:26:44] that's not fresh today and stale
[1:26:46] tomorrow, but it'll be fresh tomorrow.
[1:26:48] It'll be fresh the day after that. Amen.
[1:26:50] There's a light in there that never gets
[1:26:51] smoked up. Amen. But it's but it it's
[1:26:54] shining on the most cloudy day, on your
[1:26:57] worst day. You There's a light. Amen.
[1:26:59] There is a Christian life which is
[1:27:00] beautiful. Amen. So, so if your life
[1:27:03] with Christ is not beautiful, if his
[1:27:05] yoke isn't light, his burden isn't easy.
[1:27:07] Amen, friends. He promised you more than
[1:27:09] that. Amen. So, listen to that law of
[1:27:12] life within you that's saying, "No, come
[1:27:14] up higher. Come up into my presence. I
[1:27:16] don't want you to just I don't want to
[1:27:18] just be the God they talk about at your
[1:27:19] church. I don't want to just be the God
[1:27:21] of how you were raised. I want to be the
[1:27:23] God of your heart. I want you to know my
[1:27:25] voice. I want you to see my face. I want
[1:27:28] you to receive my life. I want to bring
[1:27:31] a seed to life within you and bring your
[1:27:33] life into blossom and bring you into the
[1:27:35] image of the potential that's in me cuz
[1:27:37] you're my son. You're my daughter. And I
[1:27:40] want you to know me like that.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, it's a beautiful life. Amen.
[1:27:45] When you push up out through all through
[1:27:47] all the worldliness and through all the
[1:27:49] religiousness and get into the presence
[1:27:51] of the one that's been drawing you the
[1:27:53] whole time.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of you think sometimes people
[1:27:56] think, "Well, I'm so glad I found the
[1:27:57] Lord." You never found the Lord. Amen.
[1:28:00] The Bible says no man ever sought God.
[1:28:01] It wasn't even in us to look for him.
[1:28:03] But it was him. Amen. It was the good
[1:28:05] father that came after his prodical
[1:28:07] sons. Amen. And gathered us in his arms
[1:28:10] and said, "Come back to a beautiful
[1:28:11] life."
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to You don't have
[1:28:14] to eat on these husks of this world.
[1:28:16] There's more in my house in my presence.
[1:28:21] Oh friends, I I'm in a growing process.
[1:28:24] I I got mistakes. I got weaknesses and
[1:28:26] failures. Amen. But look, I can't stay
[1:28:29] where I'm at. That's what it is. I I'm
[1:28:32] going pushing through things, but I
[1:28:33] can't stay where I'm at. Cuz there's
[1:28:35] something up higher drawing me, pulling
[1:28:37] me, and I feel a pull on the inside of
[1:28:39] me says, "No, you can't stay down there.
[1:28:41] Come up here, little eagle, and fly in
[1:28:43] the heavenlies. Amen. Rise up above the
[1:28:46] storm clouds." And amen, just rise above
[1:28:48] it all and come up into my presence.
[1:28:51] Amen. and be be shut in with me and know
[1:28:54] me as a personal God
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; and receive my power to become what I
[1:28:59] wanted you to be. I'm pushing up into
[1:29:01] his presence, friends. I'm reaching for
[1:29:03] that beautiful life.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; That's all God asks you is to be the
[1:29:08] kind of seed you are.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; You know what what happens is we try to
[1:29:11] impress God. We try to do we're trying
[1:29:13] to really earn something. We spend our
[1:29:16] whole lives just trying to earn
[1:29:17] something from the Lord when he already
[1:29:18] gave us eternal life freely. You know,
[1:29:20] and so and so we just we just trying to
[1:29:23] we're in a competition with everybody in
[1:29:24] the church. See how many liies we can
[1:29:26] stack up on the altar. Brother Bam says
[1:29:28] God doesn't want liies on the altar. He
[1:29:30] wants you on the altar.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; You're the lily. Amen. You're the You're
[1:29:34] the sacrifice. He just wants you to be
[1:29:37] what you are, but lay what you are down
[1:29:39] on his altar and say, "God, let that
[1:29:42] consuming fire Amen. and burn up this
[1:29:44] chaff, Lord, and bring a new life out of
[1:29:47] me, Lord, and let me grow up into your
[1:29:49] presence.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Let my life have fragrance. Let my life
[1:29:53] have beauty. Let give me that beautiful
[1:29:55] Christianity that could affect the
[1:29:56] person next to me.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Give me a prayer life, God. Give me a
[1:30:00] Give me Give Let me know your mysteries.
[1:30:02] Let me know you.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Let me have a relationship with you,
[1:30:06] friends.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; See, you're the guy, Brother Bram says,
[1:30:08] on the altar. We try to live a a
[1:30:11] comfortable life of religious service.
[1:30:13] We do our duty. We go to church and pay
[1:30:15] our tithes and send emissions and sing
[1:30:17] songs and we do all those kind of
[1:30:19] things. And we do it in a comfortable
[1:30:20] way, a traditional way. A and we make a
[1:30:23] convenient sacrifice sometimes. But you
[1:30:25] see, the seed won't settle for that. The
[1:30:28] seed doesn't want comfortable
[1:30:29] Christianity. Seed doesn't want to be a
[1:30:31] church member. The seed knows that it's
[1:30:33] a son or a daughter. And it's trying,
[1:30:35] amen, to come into the image of the life
[1:30:37] that it came from. Because every seed
[1:30:40] brings forth of its own kind.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And every seed serves a purpose.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Now, now everybody that's a Christian
[1:30:48] here this morning, everybody under the
[1:30:50] sound of my voice that's a that's a
[1:30:52] child of God. Amen. You have purpose.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; You have a purpose. Now, it's very easy
[1:30:59] to recognize purpose when it comes with
[1:31:00] a position. And we say, "Well, of
[1:31:02] course, the pastor has a purpose. The
[1:31:04] deacon has a purpose. The song leader,
[1:31:05] they serve a purpose. And I and
[1:31:06] everybody can see that. Everybody can
[1:31:08] see how they're serving their purpose,
[1:31:10] you know. Amen. Of course, you know, we
[1:31:12] know those of us with positions, we know
[1:31:14] that sometimes you can fill a position
[1:31:15] and not serve your purpose. Amen. But so
[1:31:18] purpose is different from position. You
[1:31:20] said you might be a what do you what
[1:31:22] whatever you know, a rank and file
[1:31:24] church member, whatever that means. You
[1:31:26] know, just a a regular, a normal, no
[1:31:28] such a thing, but just you're just a
[1:31:30] normal Christian. You don't preach, you
[1:31:32] don't sing, you don't you don't hold an
[1:31:33] office in the church. Just a a normal
[1:31:35] Christian. Let me tell you, you have a
[1:31:37] purpose. Amen. You and your purpose is
[1:31:40] just as eternal, just as significant,
[1:31:42] and just as indispensable as the
[1:31:45] minister, as the prophet, as the pastor,
[1:31:48] as whoever it is. Amen. You have your
[1:31:50] life has purpose cuz there's no such
[1:31:52] thing as a seed without a purpose.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; And there's no such thing as a child of
[1:31:57] God without a destiny. Amen. Listen, the
[1:31:59] house that you live in, the neighbors
[1:32:01] that you have, the neighborhood that
[1:32:02] you're in, the job that you got, the
[1:32:04] talents that you have, the church that
[1:32:06] you go to is all for a purpose. There's
[1:32:09] nothing on accident for a Christian, but
[1:32:11] your life serves a purpose. And the
[1:32:13] purpose of a seed is to reflect the life
[1:32:16] that it came from. And so God has given
[1:32:19] you the purpose. It's greater than
[1:32:20] position. It's greater than a ministry.
[1:32:23] It's greater than a gift or a talent. It
[1:32:25] is the purpose, amen, of manifesting the
[1:32:28] life of Christ.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; And shining your light to the world, the
[1:32:32] real light,
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; the life of Christ.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; You serve a purpose. Oh, friends,
[1:32:38] there's no such thing as a child of God
[1:32:39] without a destiny. Now, we look at our
[1:32:42] life. Amen. A and uh and what we would
[1:32:45] call the flower of life as we're
[1:32:46] preaching on the lily. And the Bible
[1:32:49] calls the the human life. It refers to
[1:32:51] it as a flower. How many know that?
[1:32:54] Amen. Job said, "Man that is born a
[1:32:55] woman is a few days and full of
[1:32:58] trouble." Ain't that right? He's full of
[1:33:01] trouble and he comes forth like a flower
[1:33:03] and he's cut down just like the
[1:33:05] dandelions in my yard. You know, they
[1:33:06] did they're there one day just pop up
[1:33:09] almost overnight, you know, for a short
[1:33:11] time and then and then the next day
[1:33:13] they're gone because either I mowed them
[1:33:14] down or my wife went out with the weed
[1:33:16] and feed and exterminated them. But that
[1:33:18] the point is they don't last. That's
[1:33:20] what the That's what the Bible wants you
[1:33:21] to recognize about your life. I want
[1:33:23] each of us to think about our own life
[1:33:25] today. It's not, you know, you know, uh,
[1:33:27] 60, 70, 80 years of life is not a long
[1:33:30] time.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I got three kids now. I
[1:33:33] understand that more than I ever did.
[1:33:34] It's not a long time to live. It's not a
[1:33:37] long time, you know, for uh to to to
[1:33:39] have a life. Now, now, what are we
[1:33:41] living it for? Amen. What are we This is
[1:33:43] just a this is a a burden of my heart
[1:33:46] is, you know, what? Because cuz uh I
[1:33:48] don't I just can't accept I don't
[1:33:50] believe Amen. that I was put here on
[1:33:52] this world and given a body and a mind
[1:33:55] and a soul. Amen. Just to live 60 70
[1:33:58] years and work a job, make some money,
[1:34:01] have a house and a wife and kids and
[1:34:02] everything and then and then after all
[1:34:04] that just die and fade away and maybe in
[1:34:06] a thousand years there won't even be any
[1:34:08] more Ericson and nothing I did will ever
[1:34:09] last and just fade into the abyss and
[1:34:12] dissolve into the void. I there's
[1:34:14] something in me and there's something in
[1:34:16] you that cannot accept that. But there's
[1:34:18] something every that a child of God has.
[1:34:20] They've got a sense of purpose. They've
[1:34:22] got a law of life on the inside that
[1:34:23] says, "Hey, listen buddy. I'm not here
[1:34:25] very long, but while I'm here, I'm going
[1:34:28] to do something in time which is going
[1:34:30] to ripple through eternity. I'm going to
[1:34:31] do something for the Lord. I'm going to
[1:34:33] do I'm going to live for others. Amen.
[1:34:35] And I I'm going to I'm going to I'm
[1:34:37] going to do something which will make a
[1:34:38] difference in eternity." Amen. I'm not
[1:34:40] here just to live a little while and
[1:34:42] enjoy myself and fade away. I believe in
[1:34:44] purpose and I feel a I feel a calling, a
[1:34:47] pulling. I feel something. What is it?
[1:34:49] It's the eternity that I came from. It's
[1:34:51] calling me back. But it says on your way
[1:34:53] back now. Do something in the world.
[1:34:55] Amen. Shine forth the light of Christ.
[1:34:57] Put out a fragrance. Oh. Amen. I want
[1:35:00] that beauty of the Christian life. Amen.
[1:35:03] Where somebody can say, "Hey, I knew
[1:35:04] Brother Nathan. Yeah, sure." You know,
[1:35:07] sure. He he he he made a living and fed
[1:35:09] his family and kept him in a house and
[1:35:11] all those kind of things. But listen, he
[1:35:12] did something more than that. He did he
[1:35:14] preached something. He said something.
[1:35:16] Amen. He he gave something. Amen. That
[1:35:18] affected me. And now I know and now my
[1:35:20] eternal destination has changed. And
[1:35:22] amen. I got a revelation of who I am
[1:35:24] because of something that son of God God
[1:35:26] did. Amen. That's what we're all here
[1:35:28] for, friends. From the preacher to the
[1:35:30] pew, we're here to serve God's purpose.
[1:35:32] We're not here very long. Amen. And
[1:35:34] that's that flower. Peter said, "All
[1:35:36] flesh is grass and the glory of man is
[1:35:39] the flower of grass." Amen. And the
[1:35:41] grass witherth and the flower falls
[1:35:44] away, but the word of the Lord endures
[1:35:46] forever. Amen. That's why God put that
[1:35:48] seed within you. Amen. It's that word
[1:35:50] seed. Amen. That when listen, this body
[1:35:53] will fade. Amen. That the things that
[1:35:55] these hands do may fade. Amen. But
[1:35:57] there's something resonating in this
[1:35:59] soul. Amen. That the fires of hell can
[1:36:02] never put out. Amen. in the eons of time
[1:36:04] can never dissolve it. Amen. It's
[1:36:06] eternity. Amen. And that's what that's
[1:36:08] what the Holy Ghost in a Christian is.
[1:36:10] It's eternity speaking. Eternity. Amen.
[1:36:13] Working. Eternity expressing itself in
[1:36:16] time in the flower of a human life.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It don't last very long. But
[1:36:21] listen, that flower has a sermon that
[1:36:23] it's preaching. Amen. When that flower
[1:36:25] comes for a few days and then it falls
[1:36:26] down, but it's preaching a sermon cuz a
[1:36:28] lily is a perennial. Amen. And so that
[1:36:31] lily, you might only see it for a week
[1:36:33] and then it fades away, but next spring,
[1:36:36] next spring, it's coming back just as
[1:36:38] perfect and beautiful as it ever was.
[1:36:40] And that's what that's what's testifying
[1:36:42] out of the Christian life. Amen. It's
[1:36:45] the voice of the resurrection. It's
[1:36:46] saying, "Look, I'm here." And yeah, the
[1:36:48] flower of this body and the flower of
[1:36:50] this life may wilt away, but there's
[1:36:52] something in me that's testifying. Amen.
[1:36:54] this. Put my body in the grave, but on
[1:36:57] resurrection morning, I'll rise up out
[1:36:59] of the earth. Amen. You could take every
[1:37:01] molecule of this body and put it in a
[1:37:03] different county, put it in a different
[1:37:05] country. Amen. But listen. Amen. When
[1:37:07] the when the life that I came from
[1:37:09] returns, it'll gather it back up and
[1:37:12] it'll restore it to perfection and the
[1:37:14] flower will live again for a millennium
[1:37:17] and for eternity. Amen. Cuz I'm not here
[1:37:19] to serve the things of time. I'm here to
[1:37:21] testify that I came from eternity and
[1:37:24] I'm going back to eternity and eternal
[1:37:26] things are being accomplished here in
[1:37:28] the middle.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I want my life to serve
[1:37:32] a purpose. Brother Bram said, "Anything
[1:37:34] that serves God's purpose has got a
[1:37:36] resurrection."
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. But it can only rise if it
[1:37:40] serves God's purpose. He said, "But you
[1:37:43] can't keep anything in the ground that
[1:37:44] serves God's purpose." Hallelujah.
[1:37:48] Hallelujah. Oh my. Yeah. The flower is
[1:37:51] fragile. But one day, Job was looking
[1:37:53] down at a flower. And all of a sudden, a
[1:37:55] revelation struck his heart. And it's
[1:37:57] been the one of the greatest revelations
[1:37:58] that the church has had. The elect of
[1:38:01] God, Amen, have held tight to that
[1:38:03] revelation ever since it struck that
[1:38:04] prophet Job. When he said the flower of
[1:38:07] faith, but in the spring, it comes back.
[1:38:09] He said, "And I know my redeemer lives.
[1:38:12] And let the skin worms eat this body."
[1:38:14] Amen. But but I in my flesh I shall see
[1:38:17] God. Amen. See, see a flower, it looks
[1:38:20] very insignificant. But under the visage
[1:38:22] of a prophet, it takes on purpose. And
[1:38:26] brother, you say, "Well, what's this all
[1:38:28] about? This prophet you're talking about
[1:38:30] and this message and and everything."
[1:38:33] Look, friends, it's purpose.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you begin to listen to to
[1:38:37] what Brother Brandon preached, when you
[1:38:38] begin to acquaint yourself with the
[1:38:40] message that he brought to the church,
[1:38:41] it'll not just give you a new church to
[1:38:43] go to. It'll not just give you a deeper
[1:38:46] understanding. It will give you purpose.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Purpose. It'll give you what your
[1:38:50] heart's really craving, it'll give life
[1:38:53] meaning, friends.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; I want my life to serve a purpose today.
[1:38:58] I want my life to serve a purpose today.
[1:39:00] Brother Brand said, no matter, you know,
[1:39:02] how beautiful the structure is, you
[1:39:04] know, talking about because because
[1:39:05] Jesus said, consider the lily. He said,
[1:39:08] you know, uh, not even Solomon all his
[1:39:11] glory was as beautiful as this lily.
[1:39:13] Brother Bram said, "That's because
[1:39:14] Solomon, as rich as he was, and he had
[1:39:16] those kingly robes and he the augustness
[1:39:18] of his person, but it was all
[1:39:20] artificial.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; It was all stuff that was tacked on the
[1:39:23] outside. And at the end of the day, he
[1:39:25] was just a man. But a lily has a natural
[1:39:27] beauty.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; A natural beauty. That's what we're
[1:39:30] after, friends. Not to get just enough
[1:39:32] religion to try to impress the person
[1:39:33] next to us.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; I want that beautiful life. I I want to
[1:39:37] be I want to just be who I am. Be
[1:39:38] honest. I'm not trying to put on a
[1:39:40] front. Just impress somebody. I I I'm a
[1:39:43] real human being, but I believe I my
[1:39:45] life has purpose. See? Amen. And so so
[1:39:48] so not just trying to dress up the
[1:39:50] outside. He said, "No matter how
[1:39:52] beautiful the structure is," talking
[1:39:53] about. This is when brother Brand was
[1:39:54] dedicating his church, his new church
[1:39:56] building. We're working on a new
[1:39:58] construction ourselves. He said, "And no
[1:39:59] matter how beautiful the structure is,"
[1:40:01] that we do certainly appreciate. Amen.
[1:40:04] He said, "But the beauty of the church
[1:40:05] is the character of the people."
[1:40:09] And and he said, "And I trust it'll
[1:40:10] always be a house of God of beauty." And
[1:40:12] I say, "Lord, let my life be dedicated
[1:40:14] to that. Let it not be about dressing up
[1:40:17] the outside to look like a good
[1:40:18] Christian, but let there be a natural,
[1:40:20] beautiful Christianity
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; coming out of me."
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Friends, God has a flower garden.
[1:40:27] And just closing in a moment here. And
[1:40:30] everyone serves a purpose. Everyone
[1:40:32] serves a purpose in God's bouquet. You
[1:40:34] say, "Oh, Brother Nathan, you know, I'm
[1:40:36] just I'm just young in the Lord. I'm
[1:40:38] just a fresh convert, you know, and I
[1:40:40] I'm not really in full blossom like
[1:40:41] you're talking about. I'm just a bud,
[1:40:42] you know." Well, Brother Bram says God
[1:40:45] sometimes needs a bud in his bouquet. He
[1:40:46] actually preached that at a funeral one
[1:40:48] time.
[1:40:49] He he was preaching uh it was either a
[1:40:51] funeral or talking about a young man
[1:40:52] that had passed, a young man passed
[1:40:55] passed away very young in a tragedy,
[1:40:57] just a terrible thing. But brother
[1:40:58] Brandham pointed to the purpose in it.
[1:41:00] He said, "See what God needed a bud in
[1:41:02] his bouquet." And that's why he plucked
[1:41:03] up that young brother's life. There was
[1:41:05] purpose in it.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; There's purpose in everything God does.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Everything serves its purpose. And the
[1:41:10] important thing is that everything that
[1:41:12] serves God's purpose, when resurrection
[1:41:15] morning comes, you can't keep it in the
[1:41:17] ground.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; It's coming up, friends.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; There is something I don't believe in
[1:41:22] churches without purpose.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't believe in families
[1:41:25] without pray. I don't I believe there's
[1:41:27] a reason God gathered a send the light
[1:41:30] outreach together. I believe there's a
[1:41:31] reason God put you in this church. I
[1:41:33] believe there's a reason we're here this
[1:41:34] morning. You believe that? There was a
[1:41:36] reason God brought you here. Something
[1:41:37] he wanted you to receive purpose. And
[1:41:41] there's something being expressed.
[1:41:42] That's what this message is all about,
[1:41:44] friends. It's the bouquet of God's
[1:41:47] expression. Amen.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; He He's He's got flowers of all
[1:41:50] different kinds. He brought people out
[1:41:51] of all kinds of different backgrounds to
[1:41:53] bring them under this light so that so
[1:41:55] that that quickening power could bring
[1:41:57] something out of you and you and you.
[1:41:59] Amen. Which would serve God's purpose
[1:42:01] and put forth a beauty. Now your the
[1:42:04] flower of your life may look different
[1:42:05] than the flower of mine, but look the
[1:42:07] friend. The point is God gathered it all
[1:42:09] together for the purpose.
[1:42:11] That's what it's all about.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I give my wife a bouquet of
[1:42:17] flowers,
[1:42:19] you know, I and I I gather a bouquet and
[1:42:22] I give it to her, she doesn't say, 'Oh,
[1:42:25] where'd you buy that? What store did
[1:42:27] that come from? She doesn't ask what
[1:42:29] field they grew in. She doesn't ask who
[1:42:32] who was working the checkout counter.
[1:42:34] She wasn't asking which credit card I
[1:42:36] used. You know, she's not in that's not
[1:42:39] what she's interested in. But what she's
[1:42:42] interested in is the expression of my
[1:42:44] heart that's being revealed in that
[1:42:46] bouquet.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Friends, that's what I'm interested in
[1:42:49] with this message. I'm not interested
[1:42:51] about, you know, who's who who who goes
[1:42:53] to what church and who's got the, you
[1:42:55] know, who's got the biggest and the best
[1:42:57] and who's the most talent and who's the
[1:42:58] most anointed and what this one's saying
[1:43:00] and that one and, you know, and and this
[1:43:01] church and that church and I'm not
[1:43:03] interested in any of that. That's not
[1:43:04] what it's about. It's not the purpose of
[1:43:06] it. The purpose is for the gathering of
[1:43:09] God's bride together. Amen. So that when
[1:43:11] you bring that bride together, Amen. out
[1:43:14] of that bouquet, Amen. that we we see an
[1:43:17] expression of the love of God.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; God has God, that's God's purpose for
[1:43:22] you is to show prove to this world how
[1:43:24] much he loves you.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And how much he loved the world.
[1:43:28] Let's all stand today.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You walk into a house, you
[1:43:34] see a bouquet of flowers.
[1:43:38] The very presence of that bouquet
[1:43:39] testifies that amen that there's a
[1:43:41] bridegroom somewhere. Now maybe maybe
[1:43:44] he's not home. Maybe he's away. Maybe
[1:43:46] he's maybe he's preparing a better place
[1:43:48] for his little bride to live. But when
[1:43:51] you see the bouquet, Amen. You know
[1:43:54] there's a love affair going on. Friends,
[1:43:56] you know, people people uh people might
[1:43:58] come into this church. People might pass
[1:44:01] cross paths with you in this life. They
[1:44:03] might never see Jesus face to face. You
[1:44:05] might be the only Jesus they ever see,
[1:44:07] but when they see the bouquet, that's
[1:44:09] right.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; When they see the flower of your life
[1:44:11] giving out its fragrance, it's
[1:44:13] testifying, amen, that the bride and the
[1:44:15] bridegroom are becoming one. I want to
[1:44:17] be a part of that. How many say, I want
[1:44:19] my life to serve a purpose.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram speaking about the
[1:44:22] resurrection, he said, he said that
[1:44:24] nothing can destroy it. It's been
[1:44:26] planted. It is the seed of God. He said
[1:44:29] it's the purpose of God to give us the
[1:44:31] blessed Holy Spirit. It's the purpose of
[1:44:34] God to show us signs and wonders and
[1:44:35] miracles. It's the purpose of God and
[1:44:37] nothing can destroy it. All powers of
[1:44:40] hell might wager against it, but it will
[1:44:42] prevail. He said, "We have God's eternal
[1:44:44] pro promise. There may be teachers.
[1:44:46] There may be isms rise. There may be
[1:44:48] great programs rise. Haven't we seen it
[1:44:50] over the years? There may be things that
[1:44:52] look like it would be destroyed, but it
[1:44:53] can never be destroyed. It's the purpose
[1:44:56] of God to see that it will prevail."
[1:44:58] Now, listen to these words as we bow our
[1:45:00] heads.
[1:45:01] Brother Ram said, ' Then it's not up to
[1:45:03] me and it's not up to you whether it
[1:45:07] will be destroyed or not. It's up to
[1:45:09] God.
[1:45:11] It's up to God. And we can rest assured
[1:45:14] on it that God will never let our
[1:45:16] heritage be destroyed for it's his
[1:45:18] purpose
[1:45:20] to give it to us.
[1:45:24] Maybe you just like to got something in
[1:45:27] your heart to respond to the word of God
[1:45:29] today. Say, "Lord,
[1:45:31] I hear that little voice on the inside
[1:45:34] calling me higher today.
[1:45:36] Lord, I want to live a life of purpose.
[1:45:40] Lord, I I want my life to come into
[1:45:42] blossom. Lord, I want to follow the
[1:45:45] leadership of your Holy Spirit and reach
[1:45:46] the fullness of my potential. Lord, I
[1:45:48] don't want to settle for something
[1:45:50] halfway." That'd be my that'd be my
[1:45:53] desire I would like to express to him
[1:45:55] today. Lord Jesus, here we are, your
[1:45:58] children, Lord. gathered here together.
[1:46:00] Lord, we thank you for a word that
[1:46:02] encourages us so much, Lord.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; As we, Lord, look at the things that
[1:46:06] we're struggling through. Lord, it
[1:46:08] discourages us and we get worried.
[1:46:12] Lord, we we so often, Lord, we lose our
[1:46:15] peace, Lord, that we were promised
[1:46:17] because we're so focused on the
[1:46:19] circumstances, Lord. Lord, you're not
[1:46:22] worried today. You're not worried for
[1:46:25] any of your children, Lord, because you
[1:46:27] trust the law of life, Lord. You trust
[1:46:29] the law of life that's in the seed that
[1:46:31] you planted in each one of these
[1:46:33] children, Lord. I just pray, Lord, that
[1:46:35] the Holy Spirit would come into the room
[1:46:37] now. Lord, as you've been as you've been
[1:46:39] dealing with our hearts the whole time,
[1:46:40] Lord, but let that let that let that
[1:46:43] presence Lord just bask over us, Lord.
[1:46:45] Let us lay in the light of the sun
[1:46:47] today. And I pray, Father, you'd bring
[1:46:49] out of each life here, Lord, a greater
[1:46:52] fullness of potential. Lord, I pray that
[1:46:53] you'd there'd be a growth, Lord. And I
[1:46:56] pray, Lord, that Lord, we would just
[1:46:57] trust that seed, Lord, that's within us,
[1:47:00] Father. Not worry and struggle and
[1:47:02] strive so much, Lord, but rest in who we
[1:47:04] are. Lord, we know the Christian life
[1:47:06] has pressures, Lord. But I pray, Lord,
[1:47:08] somebody, Lord, would get such a
[1:47:11] revelation today of your grace and your
[1:47:14] keeping power, Lord. Lord, that they
[1:47:16] would be able to let off the pressure
[1:47:18] now in your presence, Lord. those that
[1:47:20] are under stress, Lord. Those that are
[1:47:21] under worry, Lord. Those that are, Lord,
[1:47:24] just in the agony, Lord, over lost loved
[1:47:26] ones and Lord, and and uh and prodigals,
[1:47:29] Lord, I pray, Father, you would just
[1:47:31] touch hearts today, Lord. Come and come
[1:47:33] and be our comforter, Lord. And I pray,
[1:47:35] Lord, you just come and gather us up in
[1:47:37] your arms, Lord. That we could be your
[1:47:39] bouquet. I pray our worship, Lord, would
[1:47:41] be a sweet fragrance to you, Lord. That
[1:47:43] you would just enjoy us, Lord, and and
[1:47:45] we could enjoy you, Father. Lord, we
[1:47:47] want to worship you today, Lord. You're
[1:47:49] our redeemer, Lord. We know that you
[1:47:51] live. And Lord, we know this life is
[1:47:53] short, Father, but it's so full of
[1:47:54] meaning, Lord. And it's such a beautiful
[1:47:56] life when it's spent in your presence,
[1:47:58] Lord. We just thank you, Father, that
[1:48:01] for finding us where we were, Lord, and
[1:48:03] quickening us to life. We thank you for
[1:48:05] a testimony, Lord, that it's reflected
[1:48:08] in these lives, Lord. It came out of
[1:48:09] many of them dark places, Lord, but you
[1:48:11] brought them out into your light.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, you brought us this far, Lord.
[1:48:16] You're not going to leave us now. You
[1:48:17] said you'd never leave us or forsake us,
[1:48:19] Lord. And we trust in your abiding
[1:48:20] presence. We love you, Lord. Bless this
[1:48:23] church. I pray, Lord, you bless bless
[1:48:25] brother John and his family so good. I
[1:48:28] pray you'd bless send the light, Father,
[1:48:30] and all those, Lord, that work together,
[1:48:32] Lord, to minister to the people of this
[1:48:34] world. Father, what a lighthouse they've
[1:48:36] been. I pray, Lord, you'd reward, Lord,
[1:48:39] and multiply what has been poured out
[1:48:42] back to them. Father, I just pray, Lord,
[1:48:44] that that we'd be able to encourage them
[1:48:47] today, Father. And I pray, Lord, you
[1:48:48] would meet everything that's needed,
[1:48:50] Father, and continue to minister and
[1:48:52] unfold yourself, Lord, in this place to
[1:48:55] this congregation. We pray in Jesus
[1:48:56] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[1:49:00] you. I love you all in the Lord. I'll
[1:49:01] just turn it right over to Brother John.
[1:49:03] [Applause]
[1:49:11] We appreciate
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; that, brother. God bless you.
[1:49:16] How many appreciate that message?
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:49:26] Cannot say enough about that message.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; We could hear that a few more times,
[1:49:31] couldn't we?
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:49:36] I like one word, one of the things that
[1:49:39] he said. I wish you would elaborated
[1:49:40] just a little bit about on it about it
[1:49:44] and that is you have to stay in line
[1:49:47] with the word to grow.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Just as a seed comes from the acorn tree
[1:49:54] lays there in its in its season before
[1:49:56] it starts coming forth.
[1:49:59] That can happen anywhere in our walk. We
[1:50:01] can backslide for a while even though we
[1:50:04] are a seed of God. Even though we are a
[1:50:05] Christian, we got to get back into the
[1:50:08] light, get back into the word in order
[1:50:10] to keep the growing going.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; So there is that part that we play in
[1:50:16] talking about purpose. Brother Brandon
[1:50:18] said, "Some will make it
[1:50:21] because they were good to the bride."
[1:50:23] Now think about that statement. There
[1:50:26] was a purpose in them being good to the
[1:50:29] bride that put them in
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; purpose. I never heard that before.
[1:50:34] where when you said everything that has
[1:50:36] that purpose is eternal as is it it will
[1:50:40] come forth and I want us to think about
[1:50:43] in the days to come what your purpose is
[1:50:45] what God's calling you to do
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; I mean if you're thinking this message
[1:50:50] has provoked us to grow and to to become
[1:50:53] and we need that vision without a vision
[1:50:56] the people perish so think about your
[1:50:58] purpose purpose in God's kingdom and I
[1:51:00] love how our brother just shared that we
[1:51:03] we should be bringing forth life. We
[1:51:05] should be in winning souls for the Lord
[1:51:07] and in in bringing others to the truth.
[1:51:11] We have a a place a part to play. And
[1:51:14] may this word become so settled. Amen.
[1:51:17] We really appreciated this message.
[1:51:19] Amen. Let's just sing when I look into
[1:51:22] his holiness.
[1:51:24] Amen.
[1:51:27] Amen. Let's just try to worship the Lord
[1:51:29] just for a few minutes. just let go and
[1:51:31] let that you know bring water to the sea
[1:51:34] that we receive today.
[1:51:37] When I look into your holiness
[1:51:45] when I gaze into your loveliness.
[1:51:52] Let all things that surround me become
[1:51:56] shadowed in the light of you.
[1:52:03] When I found the joy of reaching your
[1:52:08] heart.
[1:52:10] When my will becomes enthroned in your
[1:52:14] love.
[1:52:17] Let all things that surround me become
[1:52:21] shadowed in the light of you.
[1:52:28] I worship you.
[1:52:33] I worship you.
[1:52:40] The reason I live
[1:52:44] is to worship you.

[1:53:25] Let all things that surround me come
[1:53:28] shadowed in the light of you.
[1:53:35] When I found the joy of reaching your
[1:53:39] heart
[1:53:42] and my will becomes enthroned in your
[1:53:45] love.

[1:55:07] to me.

[1:55:16] Your face is all I see.
[1:55:23] When your eyes are on this child, your
[1:55:29] grace abounds to me.
[1:55:34] Oh Lord, please light the fire
[1:55:40] at once burned bright and clear.

[1:55:52] burns with holy peace.

[1:56:04] face is all I see.
[1:56:09] When your eyes are on this child, your
[1:56:15] grace abounds to me.
