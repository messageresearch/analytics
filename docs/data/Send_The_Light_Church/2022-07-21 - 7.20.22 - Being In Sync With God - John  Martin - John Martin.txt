delivering and you are the god that supply of all of our needs according to your riches and glory and at this moment lord we pray that you would cleanse us of any doubts that we've had in the past lord we want you to sanctify our thoughts our minds our spirit our heart and lord we open the door to just faith today we open the door from hearing from you today that you would just fill our hearts with the confidence that he that had begun a good work and this is going to finish it lord we commit the service in your hands and ask you to bless your word to us now we humbly pray in jesus christ's name amen amen before you're seated we're just going to read two scriptures and then have you be seated we're going to show a little video if that's okay amen amen and if that's not okay um you need to tell me now or hold your hold your peace the first scripture reading is one verse in romans chapter 10 verse number 17. tonight we want to talk about being in sync with god amen being in sync with god you've all been uh uh involved with your phone being in sync with your computer your tablet things like that and when they get in sync they just all the information is shared from one to the other and that's the same thing that happens when we're in sync with god verse 17 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god amen that's a good good word amen and then ii timothy chapter four the first four verses there i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead that is appearing in his kingdom as our captain is telling us to charge and he says go preach the word and be instant in season in out of season in other words be in sync with god reprove rebuke exhort a lot of strong words there with all long suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall the heat for themselves teachers have an itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned onto fables god bless his word you may be seated before we get into this message today um we have a number of videos coming in from overseas and information and they're just piling up and i'll be honest with you there are some that we have just they've gone by we haven't been able to show them there's just and i i i keep thinking i'm going to do a service just on missions i'm going to show them all from the different countries and for one reason or another it just it doesn't get done so we're we're just going to show them as many as we can as often as we can so we don't miss as many and this one is first from uh honduras the mesquite area and uh we haven't uh we just looked at it one one time there's some repeat uh pictures there it's hard to understand her sister if she's talking she's spanish but she's talking in english but i want you to just focus on the faces these are people that have it much worse than we do in life and um these are people that if you've been supporting the missions these are people that uh you're supporting the work of reaching out to saving souls in the mesquite area is very hard to get to it takes about eight hours by boat to get there uh and it's not an enjoyable ride so um i just want to put faces to your your prayers and to know what you the church is doing for the kingdom of god amen [Music] so [Music] [Music] missionary activity in the mosquito of honduras broker from san francisco felix brother jose francisco palette was a missionary evangelist from the village of our plan kazuri in the department of europe eliza has been supporting the ministry of our brother who together with his wife and other brothers who accompany him has been assisting the missionary work in la mosquitia in honduras and nicaragua after the trips that were made to this area in 2002 with our brothers gary maldonado mia rubio and brother collins [Music] [Music] [Music] the gospel has increased in different parts of the mosquito among which some places that already have established churches such as puerto rico which is being attempted before the rafa's that house to perron which is being cared for the brother carmen ramirez gosling a church with several members but no brother in church yet [Music] [Music] [Music] missionary activity in this area is quite complicated due to access to it since there are no words that connect with this part of the country and for that reason when our brothers travel to the area to be able to move sometimes they do it on foot other times on horseback other times by both through the patucka river in the karaska lagoon or by pick-up where possible and sometimes by plane where the price of ticket is quite on yours [Music] [Music] the churches in the places that used to be great and that were already established are like a collection center where the brothers arrive that goes to spread to different communities such as stikiraya sexiwa juanpu serpi aguas bruce laguna zigzagtara and barapa to command others [Music] brother rafael black house does his work as interpreter for our brothers since he is a native of that area in the end in some places they do not speak spanish [Music] we're infinitely grateful to our brother john king martin and sandal and our rich ministry in vettel michigan usaid because without his support this would not be possible god bless you originally [Music] we beg your prayers so that our brothers can continue preaching the gospel in this community that need needed so much and still be able to fulfill what the great teacher told to us go over the wall and preach the gospel to every creature god bless you [Music] [Music] i have a vision over there to reach out for souls and one soul is worth ten thousand worlds and you can't do enough to see one soul saved and the believe the scripture tells us that without a vision the people will perish and so that's something that we want to cultivate um and and know that the mission field is is outside these doors it's the whole world and god can use each and every one of us to help uh to help bring them to christ now i'm going to be honest with you the world is lost and this is the only book that can tell us who we are who they are where they came from and where they're going it's the only book that can do that and god has placed the truth in our hearts and what uh an opportunity we have uh to to help spread the gospel overseas and locally um i will say they they put a lot of time into that and i know it wasn't clear and it wasn't exact and there's some double pictures and things like that but i thank the lord that they wanted to share with us to give us some sort of idea of the work that they're doing and the families that are going down there may god continue uh to bless them amen well as i made mention i want to entitle this message being in sync with god we can't be in sync with god unless we have faith in what god is speaking hebrews 11 verse 6 says but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must first believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him now this may sound like there's two different subjects but it's really one subject and it's called faith and i want to read it just a little bit different to kind of bring it home to us here in the church and those that would be live streaming but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to church must first believe that he is the word being preached and that he is a rewarder of them that call upon him in other words we have more to do than just be at church we've got to believe that god is here that god the word is really speaking and it's not a man speaking and that we have a responsibility that when he speaks that we're to call upon him i'm not in sync with god just because i'm a child of god i must have faith and another thing i need is i need to be in sync with god by being in the spirit i have to be in the spirit if i don't walk in the spirit the bible says that i will literally fulfill the desires of my flesh and that i'll i'll bite and devour others just like the devil the devil is seeking whom he may devour that's what happens to us when we're in the flesh we take on the nature of satan john 4 24 says god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in the spirit and in truth in spirit and in truth so we just can't worship god in the old way we want you and say god take it or leave it we've got to get out of our flesh and get into the spirit if god is going to receive our worship so being in sync with god is not something that god owes us like like you owe it to me to get me in this to get me in sync with you god don't know us a thing that's right amen god still expects us today to deny ourself to pick up his will that's the cross to pick up his will because his will is usually suffering i got some some quotes here that i wanted to read from the the church age book and last wednesday our brother jonathan we were in the men's meeting and he said brother john you know what we need is we need this quote hanging up in the church and i'm going to read this quote to you it's right here may god begin by his spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation so i just cut that out of the message and i wanted to hang that up here because there's so much into this statement and brother branham he said this he said that faith is a revelation so therefore we can conclude that revelation has substance because faith has substance it's it's it it hope is missing a substance that faith has so revelation isn't just knowledge of the truth it has a substance and that substance brings life to the person that the revelation comes for brother branham also said that revelation is the most important thing that we can pray for so i just want to read this on page 28 he says now the true revelation is god interpreting his own word by vindicating what is promise the true revelation of god is the true revelation is god interpreting his own word now remember that man can't give revelation we're all here today god is building his church on revelation and man can't give it to one another you are totally depending on the lord so you come into church and you're depending on the lord not for man to help you but for god to help you now don't let anyone be misled by what i've said and think that i do not believe in the accuracy of the word as we now have it i believe this bible is accurate jesus completely authenticated the old testament when he was here on earth and it was compiled exactly as was the our new testament make no mistakes about it we have the infallible word of god today and no man dares take away from it or add to it but we need the same spirit that gave it to teach us so coming to church and totally depending on our understanding and the ability for the human being that's behind this pulpit to bring across to you the revelation will come utterly short of what is needed it takes god through the power of the holy spirit to reveal true to you oh how we need revelation by the spirit we don't need a new bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good and i'm not against them but but we need the revelation of the spirit amen and thank god we have it have what we need for god wants to reveal his word to us by his holy spirit amen and he goes on to say this may god begin by his spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation may god begin and how is he going to do it by the preacher by his spirit you've got to be in sync with the holy ghost if you're looking for a continuous life-giving and the revelation that helps you to prevail over the trials in your life and the things that you're going through you need god to give you a revelation and i'll tell you we can't depend on church to have it we need it like 24 7 the things that we're going through we need god in the scene in our home god in this team in our workplace god in the scene in every situation that's right amen oh if the church could only get a fresh revelation and become by it the living word manifested god god doesn't always want us to speak and have a mountain moved he made the children of israel go through the fire he made daniel go through the lion's den he made job go through what he went we heard that last service sometimes we need to be so full of the holy ghost that we could just go through i'm going through i'm going through we got to manifest the word all right he says let me read that again oh if the church could only get a fresh revelation and become by it the living word manifested we would do the greater works and glorify god our father which is in heaven so god is looking for us to do greater works he that believeth on me the works i do shall he do also god is looking for us to believe to the point that god has manifested in her life romans chapter 10 uh verse verse 11. and i know we read the verse 17 but i want to just kind of go through a few of these scriptures here and i want to start with verse number 11 for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed amen i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for there is no difference between the circumcision the uncircumcision the jew and the greek for the same lord over all now notice is rich unto all that call upon him now we're this whole thing is going to be about faith but what we're going to see is that we have a part to play and i think if we don't play this part god's not going to move like we want him to move it starts out talking about believing not being in shame and then he says that he is rich to all them what that believe no to them that call upon him we got a call upon the lord we can't just sit in church and expect the revelation to come we got to call upon him we gotta we gotta we gotta express i want you lord yes amen for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved and then he says in verse fourteen how then shall they call how shall they call on him who they have not believe i want you to think now i understand we're all sitting here as believers today but when we come into the church there are certain things in our life that we just don't believe and the fact of that is is shown in what has transpired in the week before and so now we come to church and we need to hear the truth but how are we going to hear the truth if we haven't believed it if it wasn't for the grace of god and the word comes to correct us okay and then how shall they believe in him of whom they've not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher someone's got to bring the truth and then look he says right how shall they preach except they be sent so not all preachers are sent everybody preaches everybody preaches we preach to one another it may not be behind a piece of wood in front of people but we preach but we need to be sent in other words when we're speaking to one another the word of god we need to have the spirit of god with us and we need to be sent by god as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that peace uh preach the gospel peace and bring glad tidings of good things now that's a message all on its own but it sounds like that's a flowery wonderful sermon doesn't it but it's it's not what you think it is because look at verse 16 but they have not all all obeyed the gospel i mean what do you got to obey if if it's just a gospel of peace and good tidings you understand it says but how but they have not all obeyed the call the call the word that is that has gone out for isaiah's saith lord who have believed our report who's believed it it's been preached but who believes it so then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god faith comes by hearing and the correct hearing is when god speaks when god speaks by his spirit not when man speaks the word not when we read the bible not even when we listen to tapes we've got to hear god speaking to us by his spirit through the reading through the preaching through the tapes we've got to be in sync with god there were 12 spies that heard the message from god and they actually went out and they saw the truth of the report that it was a land that flowed with milk and honey they all said that not just two of them they all said that it was a true report god never did say our only problem is going to be with those giants he never even brought it up that was something that was concocted through reasoning human reasoning and their eyesight that their problem was too big for them there was something something there in ten of those spies that couldn't stay just with the word they got off the word they got off the report they didn't believe the report it was you know what it was happened that reasoning when it took place it happened during the unveiling of the word the unveiling of the promise when they went and spied out the promise that is when reasoning got in it's us sitting in church and hearing the word that reasoning gets involved i'll tell you we when we're sitting here and we're looking at the promise of god's word god's word says you can have joy you you can have joy you just got to keep my commandments you got to have peace but you got to keep your mind stayed on me you you when we're looking into the promises it's then that we begin to reason well you don't know my situation you don't know what i'm going through you don't know how hard you haven't been in my shoes like the giants of your nature are so great that you're scared you're scared to stand up like joshua and caleb and say god gave me peace god gave me joy god gave me love god gave me this the promises are to the believer but you've got to believe it if you can't feel it in and we're here depending on god's spirit to reveal it to us now the difference between the two reports that came back the ten spies they heard from moses the same thing that joshua and caleb did but the ten spies heard it only from moses where joshua and caleb heard by the spirit the bible says they were of another spirit so we could be sitting in church and not being in sync with god we could one some of us could be listening to a man and some of us could be listening from listening and hearing god so then faith cometh by hearing from god personally not hearing brother john preach the word not over and over and over and over that doesn't bring faith faith comes from god which means if we're not getting what we want from god let's call on god let's call on them more who are to say that we've done enough if you want more get desperate good enough to hear the truth of god personally from a man you must hear it directly from god i'm just saying we're just vessels if god don't go before you when you go to witness to somebody it's just you that's why jesus told him stay in jerusalem until you get in due with power from on high and you shall be witnesses after the holy ghost has come otherwise you're just witnessing we got to have god witnessing amen amen brother or in in matthew chapter 16 verse 17 if you turn there with me jesus here he testified to peter personal his personal revelation he said blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood have not revealed this or it hasn't it didn't take the cover off of it it didn't it it didn't make known unto thee it wasn't somebody standing behind a pulpit that told you but my father which is in heaven he's the one that revealed it and upon this act of revealing of this revealing uh from god himself to us as individuals i will build my church upon that and the gates of hell should not prevail against it that's why we could come to church hear the words say amen but never receive faith in it and get blown off but when you receive a revelation if the gates of hell cannot prevail against it then you tell me how you're going to backslide from it satan if he could he would destroy every one of us he wanted us to destroy job but he can't if the gates of hell can't prevail against the revelation what do we got to worry about we need to stand there on what god has spoken and if we feel that that we don't have that kind that we need to call on god for revelation that's all there is to it there is no other way no other person can give us can give us faith we're not going to receive it from a different preacher we're not going to receive it from a different church revelation comes from god so then faith cometh by hearing from god so in this context that we're speaking of today i'll say it like this through a preacher because we read how can they how can they hear unless they have a preacher who is sent by god so this faith that we're talking about i want to just bring it here to church how are we going to have faith if we don't receive god's word through the preaching of the word we've got to get beyond this this is just a man up here trying to tell us the best he can on how to live right god is in his word he's so much in his word a lot of times preachers don't even know it but god knows he knows what he's doing god is in control his word will get through the preachers and it will land into the heart that's prepared and if it's not prepared it's not going to bring forth fruit the word falls on all types of ground but it needs to be a rock-solid revelation it's not hearing the gospel alone that gives us faith it's the source in which we hear it from and i'm not talking about the preacher i'm talking about his spirit what's important uh if i can't do anything but to try to uh uh uh help us to get more prepared for the word tonight then that's what i want to do because we've been so used to just plopping into church wanting to hear from god wanting to be blessed by god but doing nothing to prepare it's like what are we we're mocking god we're making we're putting god so much lower than us what we need to do is humble ourselves underneath god and call upon him god i need you i need to hear from you there's no life in the world i've come to church to hear from you directly too much looking at this is wrong and that's wrong and what about this and what about that and i think this what about humbling ourselves to hear from god we must hear the gospel from god himself how many times do you hear me say i wish there was a veil right here so you couldn't see my body i want you to hear from god no matter how much i want you to see something have you ever tried to show somebody something you tried you tried and they just don't get it so it didn't happen because the lack of effort and when it comes to the word only god can reveal you don't strike it one out of a hundred you don't strike it at all only god is reserved revelation from above only god can reveal and a solid way to know whether or not you're really prepared for church is by analyzing your spirit and your attitude in other words every one of us come into church either like vashti or like esther we're approaching the throne we're approaching god we're approaching the word either with reverence and i'm unworthy waiting for him to hold out or we come in thinking i belong here and i deserve this you check on that you'll see whether you're prepared or not that's not just another good story in there that's for us for our admonition amen hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 let us therefore fear so what's the end result then let us therefore fear lest a promise be left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it so we can come short of entering in of entering into the spirit entering into god entering into the promises of god we come short we can want it we can desire it but we can come short and he goes on and gives us a perfect example of this in verse 2 for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that what heard it so they heard the gospel but they didn't hear from god they heard from man they heard the gospel it was preached it was even god sent men but they didn't get into the spirit they didn't feel they needed to give anything more to get there and the bible was telling us we need to fear we actually have to have a fear of i could miss this i could come short i could not be ready for the word just let that laodice let us see a spirit stay on us when we come into the church and we expect god to do this and this and this and this for us he's faithful we need to do our part the gospel itself didn't bring faith but being in sync with god is what brings faith amen that's right you know people could go to colleges and talk about bible for years and get degrees to all get out and be further away from god than when they started brother adam said but to be in sync with god you know what it's like when your wi-fi goes on and all sudden all your apps start you know uh re-updating thank you it's like uh you're not even it's doing it and when it's done is there and that's what happens when we're in sync with god when we're in the spirit when we're full of faith when we're hearing from him directly we're not allowing the devil to tell us about reasoning and all this that we don't like and what about this and what about i'm here for one thing and that's god and i need the whole world is going down the tubes and if they had the answer that jesus christ was the same yesterday today and forever if they really knew that what a difference it would be god speaks directly to all of us but we've got to be in tune just the frequencies get out of the flesh into the spirit and really it's all a condition about heart now i want to make this real clear you can be in the flesh you can be carnals all get out and god could still speak to you and he did every one of us when we were in the world and he can do it any time but to the mature believer this is not how he operates to his bride this is not how he operates if he did he would have let vashti get away with it but she was made an example and we need to learn to wait on the lord we need to stand still in our spirit and know that he is god that he's speaking and that i will be quiet until i hear but one thing i will not do is i will i will not stop calling on god my spirit my heart my desires the inside the invisible is going to be calling on god because i need him so when you're hearing the gospel and something just isn't clicking you're not really hearing from god you have a responsibility call upon him call upon him don't stop don't don't act like beshte i'm not doing nothing until i get what i want call upon him humble yourself and if you hear god speak to you you know what you have to do call upon him because that's what the gospel says either way you have to call upon him because now what he's spoken to you he expects it to be manifested and you know you can't manifest the word on your own it takes god in you there's nothing he's not going to share his glory with anybody it's either christ and it's the hope of glory or that's it either way we have to call upon the lord all right go back to romans chapter uh 17 10 17. so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god but i say have they not all heard yes verily their sound went out to all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world world so they heard the word we come to church no matter what condition we're in we hear the gospel but i say did not israel know first moses saith i will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people and by a foolish nation i will anger you and isaias is very bold and saith i was found of them that sought me not and i was made manifest unto them that asked not after me the word comes and it is christ himself here he made it real clear where two or three are gathered in my name i'll be in the midst there's we should never be doubting god's presence what we should be doubting is am i really in the spirit am i in sync with god am i ready to receive him or am i still in the flesh verse 21 but to israel he saith all day long think about this he's with us all day long i have stretched forth my hand unto a disobedient and gang-sane people now you say brother john what are you preaching that to us we're not like that you know what that word disobedient means it means disbelieving disbelieving all day long trying to get us to believe gang saying that just simply means to refuse to contradict to debate to deny and even speak against all day long that's what god's dealing with he's got a hard job convincing us that we're wrong a very hard job because you know we're so right in our own eyes going our own direction doing our own thing and nobody can tell us that's who god deals with that's why we need to fear that's why we need to call upon say i could be wrong here god speak to me reveal to me it is the most important thing that we can pray for is revelation amen god ain't gonna just hand it over to us because my name is john martin that don't mean anything to god that's just pride but he gives grace to the humble he gives more grace to donvo i think paul humbled himself so much that he got abundance of revelations and then he had to deal with the abundance of revelation but you know what i'd rather have that happen than just be without christ honestly now we may be perfectly in the will of god today which we are here at our posted duty but we need to be in sync with the word not just be here at church not be just in sync with the church attendance but be in sync with the spirit the spirit not brother john don't have to agree with me don't even have to like me honestly but you need to be in sync with the holy ghost because i couldn't give revelation if i wanted to and if i could i would and i'm so glad god's in charge of all that because he hid it from the wise and prudent didn't he brother branham said in the message revelation of jesus christ it says he is not to be known intellectually he is known spiritually by spiritual revelation now this sounds spooky and scary but you know what we got to get out of just being comfortable being in church here we've got to get out of the flesh and say god i need to be direct with you i need direct connection with you you got to shake off this lukewarmness just shake it off and you know none of us have a desire to go get lukewarm none of us no we're not guilty of that we're guilty of not keeping it off of us we're guilty of of not saying um god give me isaf to see and clean up my ears and help me to hear what the spirit is saying to the church today that's what we're guilty of we're guilty of not calling out to god and saying help me this flesh is like it just gravitates that this world not our heart not our spirit not the christian inward man that we are this outward flesh and before you know it we could be so encumbered by this giant nature we're afraid to deal with it we'd rather wander around in the wilderness just waiting for what for what the bride is making herself ready it's the only way she gets ready for rapture first corinthians chapter 2 verse 14. first corinthians chapter 2 verse 14 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for their foolishness unto him how many i remember when i first came to this truth i heard a lot of things and i thought it was kooky i thought it was foolish and i went to church for so long and nobody told me how to cut my hair nobody told me how to get rid of my worldly music and i started hearing things and they just they were foolishness to me but i didn't know him i didn't know him the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for their foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually revealed that doesn't mean we sit there in a carnal state and discern what we think is spiritual and what is not what that means is we get to a place where god can actually deal with us and show us tell us something tell us more than what we know the word the living word of god is the discerner the bible tells us the word of god is a discern of the thoughts intents of the heart but you know what it's also a discerner of and we're all looking for that the god comes he just deserves certain things that have taken place in my in my life today we all want that it's like gives you like an extra boost but sometimes he reveals and speaks something to our heart that is there and we don't want it because it's something we have to deal with and then we don't like that discernment and then we begin to reason that was brother john or that was somebody told somebody or whatever but you know that word is also the discerner of explaining it to you so we're hearing all these things we come to church for now and we hear all this word being preached and we need to get in think with it we can have confidence when we look to the lord to look to the spirit of god that that spirit is the one that can reveal it to us to discern what it really means the true interpretation of the word to your life for your life and it happens when we're in sync with him it's like you know that you know that you know and you don't even know how you know because he just made it known and you're like what just happened but it was him it was him and you and it can happen more often you believe that amen all right verse 11. go back up to verse 11. for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man that's true how many times you sit and watch birds or dogs and cats and you you ask what i wonder what they're saying to one another and you know a dog will just look at you and go you can say this and it'll just still stay there he don't understand no man understands the things of a man save a man we don't know what a an aunt is thinking we can try to think about it we can try to think about how uh uh bears are and and dolphins are and and this is probably what they're doing and that's about all we can do when we're thinking about the spirit of god what the word of god really means if we didn't have a prophet that came in this age we wouldn't know nothing hardly it takes the spirit of god to reveal the word that's being preached amen it doesn't matter what we know it matters only what's revealed to us i'd rather know half as much and have more revealed to me because nothing can happen with just knowledge there's not a tree of knowledge of good and evil there's no life on it but to be able to live more god's more pleased with me so it's not the knowledge that we're after amen it's the spirit of god okay let's finish reading it for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god our dependency is that god will come and go through this mind of humanity to reveal himself to us that's what our dependencies on it's on him god is not going to let anybody take some glory like he figured it out he's you know he's got the smarts he had to take paul who was very smart saul were very smart and then knock him off that mindset to a place that he got i know nothing except jesus christ and him crucified he had an abundance of revelations from the crucifixion from calvary praise god and that's you're not don't get away from calvary stay right there stay close to what jesus has done for you romans chapter 1 verse number 15 i just romans chapter 1 verse 15 soul as much as in me i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are in world wars i have to say this today how many is ready to preach the gospel how many is ready to be instant in season and out of season how many is in sync with god because unless he's working through you now i do believe you got to step out by faith and you got to go ye out but there's got to be a faith inside of you that your your steps are being ordered of the lord and you're moving in the direction that he wants you to for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god the power of god is in the word and it's not the written word it's the spirit that moved on holy men of old as they wrote as they penned it it was god in the men that penned this and what we're wanting is we're wanting the spirit that wrote the word well the true interpretation of what's behind it we want that living in me not to make sure that i got the right knowledge or the right take on it or the no we need it living inside of us so it's the power of god and salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and then also to the greek for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written i live by faith if you're just you don't live by anything but faith i'm just this is the gospel this is not the john martin gospel i'm reading out of the king james version called the bible the just shall live by faith so we could read it like this for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from revelation to revelation from substance to substance from the voice of god spoken to you personally to the voice of god's spoken to you personally that's why i can't i can't live by your revelation i can't live off of what you think i can only live by what god speaks to me that's why it's important to know who your head is i don't know where i'd be without a prophet i just don't know there's and i'll tell you this is why you're going to read the bible and you're going to come across things that you do not understand that do not make sense that just don't seem right that seem to be contradictory and you're going to see that same thing transpire when you read the message when you hear the tapes i thought this i thought that there's got to be an absolute somewhere you've got to have an absolute and i'm telling you until you get revelation of any subject any subject you need to be calling on god with fear i mean some people don't want to pay tithes okay don't pay dice that's between you and god in between me and you and god it's between you and god but don't just say i'm not going to do it because that's not what i think i'm literally i get taxes from people don't go to this church people that have been in this church years years years many years ago about you don't have to pay ties hey that's their business but i i i say this if you heard it preached you listened to the message you heard the prophet if you're wrestling with it call upon god humble yourself to call upon god don't don't don't just you know say i don't have to don't do that don't do that give god a greater chance and when i say that what i'm meaning is humility god can't help the proud he just actually resists it he reads just like king resisted vashti and as much as he didn't want to do it counsel told him he had to and and counsel tells us that we have to stay with the word we can't add one thing we can't take one thing away we got to stay it's our absolute all right now how can we live by faith if we don't receive it the just shall live by faith good what if i don't receive faith what if i come to church and i just feel like i'm further away than when i came you know brother brandon says when you come to church you never leave church the same way you're either further away or closer so what if i don't receive faith then how can you live by it you know i've seen this you know people don't hear they don't they don't hear what they wanted to hear so they just kind of let let everything go and they don't realize that if they didn't need that word they're going to need it and their attitude makes all the difference in it for the wrath look at this for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness in or of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness so if it's okay with you i'm just going to get right down to the living room right here do you have any ungodliness in your life that should be such an easy question to answer of course but what does the word come for it's to reveal that it's to reveal that unrighteousness so we can take the next step you know god isn't just a god to reveal to us to meet all of our needs we have spiritual needs those are more important than our natural needs as much as i would love to have another 500 000 sitting in the bank and i could use it right now i really could use it not because i want to buy things but you know i could just i need it can only borrow so much money but you know what he's more interested in seeing his life manifested in me than anything about work i just have a promise if i put him first everything else is added so don't try to figure out everything just make sure he's first all right i see sister shirl's back there and which means time we saw that video we saw the video that was about a 20 minute video 25 minute i think no no but we got a little bit more if we could go now look verse 19 because that which may be known of god is manifest in them is manifest in them for god have showed it on to them so god when he preaches the gospel everybody's going to be without excuse on the day of judgment everybody will be because it's been preached no he hasn't revealed it to them but their heart wasn't for it i mean look at cain's heart his heart wasn't for the truth but he was told if you do good you're going to be accepted and if you don't bye bye you know and and that's the thing we all we got to do is walk in the word or let the word be our head revelation will bring god on the scene to what manifests that word in her life that's the reason it's revealed the reason the word is revealed is to manifest jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever it's not so we can become an encyclopedia not so we can know the mysteries and all the knowledge is so we can live the life in front of somebody god reveals to you that he is the love of god that jesus is the love of god then you will become that love of god for everybody that's that's what that's what it's for all hell is against revelation that's why he'll distract us and do everything he can all hell is against christ being manifested again satan wants to put the manifestation the life of christ back in history you know it's not now it's back in history so if satan can stop you distract you or keep you from being prepared then he can stop the manifestation of christ in you then he don't have to worry about what's going to happen when you leave the church but if you just get one man in his hands he'll turn things upside down won't he why is satan so against revelation because that's the only thing that god said he'd build his church on he's trying to stop the building of the church we don't care if there's 5 000 people in here and in one sense i don't think satan cares but he don't want one person living it amen he don't want one person manifesting the truth why is satan so against the manifestation of christ in life because it's only through the manifestation of the word that we can literally destroy the devil in our lives the word has to come to life would we say satan get behind me it's got to come forth from the heart of faith it can't come to just head knowledge are you with me acts chapter 19 verse 13 will you just let me go on just a little bit remember the wandering vagabonds you remember i'm sure you do in acts chapter 19 verse 13 then certain of the vagabond jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus saying we adjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth in other words we want to make it clear which jesus we're talking about i'll make it real clear it's the one that paul talks the one that brother branham talks about it's the one that your favorite preacher talks about and there were seven sons of one skeva a jew a chief of the priest which did so and the evil spirits and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know and paul i know but i don't know you i don't know you here these evil spirits were requiring a manifestation of who they were no different than jesus many will come to me in that day he says i never knew you in that spiritual realm you've got to take a side because if you're just going to be in the middle even though you use the name of jesus and you cast out devils and do many wonderful works or you want to try to use the name of jesus without having the life and you know it's it's you need to cha to choose the side you're going to be on and stay there are you with me you don't want to be jesus dealing with jesus i know paul i know but who are you you don't want to be dealing with the spirit that's calling you out because he will he will it's the life behind the name that makes the demons trouble it's a life behind the name that makes the proud more humble it was god who devised the plan that in all things like a man that he would live so he could give to us the life behind the name revelation comes so the word can now become manifested that's why it's so valuable if we if we can sit and be content with knowledge and then we're not interested in manifesting christ enough we need to get back to god i need you i i'm calling upon you i'm not satisfied with the results that i've been getting when i've been going to church i need to manifest more of you remember he fills those that hunger and thirst after righteousness but if we're content without the hunger how is he going to fill us amen jesus james said the devils believe and they tremble look about this the devils believe and they tremble the weak is christian when he's on his knees the devil trembles he's not big spiritual with revelation but you know what he's doing things that we don't do getting on our knees and calling upon him you want to make the devil tremble in your life get serious with god i don't care how weak or how strong you are just get on your knees and start calling upon god and the devil will tremble at you because you're calling upon the one who's who wants to give us life-giving and prevailing revelation by his spirit god is real and we need to energize and and cultivate the life of christ inside of us first john chapter 3 verse 8 this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil now you want to destroy the devil in your life amen amen well just think about a soft answer turns away wrath okay when you manifest the word you will destroy the obstacles that are in front of you and and god wants to see himself manifested in us because god is the only one that can destroy the devil romans chapter 8 verse 19. we know that the whole creation is growing and travailing in pain until now now now there's no more time than now for this to be man for this to be manifested romans 8 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestations of the sons of god all of god's creation heaven earth angels demons everything is waiting for the manifestation of what of a million dollars of my third home my six car my financial secure business no all of god's creation is waiting for the manifestation of us now where are we at in that vision where are we at in that vision we've got to enter in it the bride is in the process of making herself ready now how is she doing that she's preparing herself for the word capstone every time she hears the word to make sure she's catching the revelation of it not just being satisfied with hearing it with these ears but being of those who mix that word that they're hearing with faith and you know what you can't make faith you can't manufacture it that comes from god alone and the only way you get that is in your relationship so when i say call upon the lord spend time praying seek god prepare your heart you know what i'm talking about i'm talking about your relationship i'm not referring to church attendance i'm talking about why are you here why did you come today what are you looking to take home with you let's stand together second corinthians chapter 3 verse 17 and 18 we got to give liberty to the holy spirit the bible says now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face as in a glass beholding us in the glass the glory of the lord we're changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord may god begin by his spirit to give continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation it's we we need to look to him for what we need through the spirit and i'll tell you it doesn't stop it's continuous life-giving you know every day we need new life we eat right we drink we eat we we need it to keep going so we need not just to read the bible but we need to receive the spirit of the word because that's where the life is at otherwise we're just gaining knowledge so may the the lord move in our hearts to start calling upon him more we do this in our homes we do it on the way to church we can we can come here and make sure that we take that half hour that we get before service and really calling the lord ready to start activating because we want god to move don't we amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer our heavenly father we come to you lord with ourselves we don't have anything else to bring we don't even have anything to offer for your word says heaven is my throne earth is my footstool what house will you build me lord the only thing that we have to offer you today is our will the will of our heart lord we're not asking you just to come and live inside of us and and take what we give you but we want you to come in and take liberty take liberty lord our our yearning and our desire is to be in your image that when the world looks at us they they don't see us they see a your nature coming out of us i know through that lord we'll have to suffer a lot we'll go through a lot but in the end your word says that the sufferings of this present world are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed as god we're all looking for that time i pray that you would bless each one here lord with the revelation of just this message that we can begin as the prophet said begin to call upon you that you may begin to give us the revelation that we have need of lord we love you we thank you for this we trust you changing our lives lord in the precious name of jesus christ we pray amen amen you love the word amen amen amen um let's sing by his word i'll prevail by his word amen by his word i'll preface by his word [Music] i'll never fail [Music] by his word i'll overcome by his word of prevails i'll overcome by his love i'll prevent [Music] by his love i'll never fail by his love i'll overcome by his love i'll prevail how
