chapter 14 Exodus chapter 14 and then I would like us to read also from the book of Second Kings second Kings chapter four so Exodus chapter 14. let's read from verse 13. and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward but live thou I up the road and stretch out that hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea amen first second Kings chapter 4 let's read the history from verse 22. foreign and said send me I pray thee one of the young men and one of the houses that I may run to the man of God and come again and she said and he said wherefore with that go to the man go to him today it is neither new moon no Sabbath and she said it shall beware then she saddle and acts and said to her a servant Drive and go forward slack not thy riding for me except IBD amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word please let's be seated so once again we are grateful to the almighty God forgiveness this opportunity to be in his house to think is praises and to hear His holy word remember the heavens and the Earth will pass away but his word will be forever and we have once again grateful to the Lord for the days in which we are living amen when we can see with our eyes prophecies being fulfilled amen for God is faithful this morning just to encourage ourselves we want to speak and go forward in faith no matter what is on the way go forward in faith and you shall see the salvation of the Lord you only see the salvation of the Lord if you go forward no matter what is on your way today no matter what you are confronted with no matter the challenges you are facing go forward go through the children of Israel in this hour after he has brought them out of Egypt and remember he selects the path we have to thrown amen amen let him choose the path for you smooth it will be a rough let him choose it if only he chooses for you he will take you through it let God choose the path for you amen let him choose for you because he knows the way and it is the way amen the Lord Jesus said I am the way and I am the truth I am the way and I am the truth I am the life yeah same minute so let him choose for you and let him lead you yes and the Bible tells us when he brought the children of Israel out of Egypt he let them by day and by night yes yes by day in the pillar of cloud by night the pillar of Fire it never took it away from them so let him lead you it might say to you oh what is he where is this but he knows the way it might not be clear to you but follow the leadership and the prophet of God said the leadership of God today is to follow the Vindicated message of the hour by the Holy Ghost the leadership of God today is to follow the Vindicated message of the hour by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah not you don't need you don't need your thoughts and you don't need your opinions right we need thus say yes the Lord amen amen we need his mind amen amen so young man young woman parents loved ones young and old let him lead us yeah Hallelujah that's why we need the mind of Christ we must tie to our own thoughts to our own ideas oh Hallelujah the prophet of God preached on the guide right and he said the guide must know the way and he said you don't argue with the guide right because the God is afraid to take you through he knows how to survive and so no matter what it will be guide he so he sent us the guide the Holy Ghost to guide us he brought him out of Egypt and he told Moses where to pass he told the leader because God's will always comes to his messenger surely the Lord God will do nothing right but Revenge is unto his servants the prophets the prophet he might not qualify to you as a prophet right but God chooses him that this is my prophet he may not quality to you but he is qualified to God chooses God a day God selects he may not be your likening but he said no no it's not qualified somebody can do it better yes somebody can do it better but God chooses this one to do it do your opinion somebody might do it better but God knows who can do it well God knows who can please him and so the scripture says know your calling not many Nobles not many mighty men but God has chosen the best things of this life to confound the mighty that is God's to see so Jesus said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you oh yes we might not qualify in the sight of people not qualified to be a Christian nobody had this one too and that one too but he choose us yeah we are his choice somebody say praise the Lord I'm glad that they choose me and thank God that he did not search for any man's opinion [Applause] amen because if he has such somebody's opinion am I not qualified that's right oh no not this one no don't choose him because he has done this and done that because it's like this and it's like that amen but thank God he did not serve any man's opinion he made that decision he made that choice yes and he decided that I am going to save you I am going to save this one I'm going to save this one and the Bible said he for new US amen before the foundation of the world he choose us in Christ yes he choose you and he wrote our names in the last book of life before the foundation of the word before and anything was formed right he purpose in himself with that consultation he didn't consult nobody that's right he did not construct he didn't even consult you didn't ask your mind he didn't ask your thoughts he didn't ask your idea he didn't ask whether you want to be saved or you don't want to be saved he decided I will save this one somebody said prison life all glory to God so he decided the time you should come in that's right the hour you should come in right right well you should come here he decided yes the prophet of God said amen it is God's choice right for you to be a Christian amen right hallelujah it's his choice yeah praise the Lord thank God that he choose us yeah we had not eat Jesus yeah yeah he pick us up amen I'm so glad and so he that began that good work in you yes and in me amen we complete it yeah amen for salvation is of the Lord amen amen hallelujah and so he brought him out he said Moses passier go by the way of the Wilderness go by the way of this place pass through the rest go here and pharaoh we think that you are stranded in the wilderness and it will come after you so before Pharaoh taught anything God knew his thoughts what you will be thinking amen and he knows our thoughts too amen amen the Bible says he see our thoughts are far off in the prophet of God said your thoughts and my thoughts sounds so loud in his presence than what we say whatever we think about he hears it he sees it may God help us that our thoughts will be his word and if there's any wrong thoughts may he take it out so that we have the mind of Christ amen like I've always said and I said to people to serve God you have to lose your mind lose your mind then you have the mind of Christ you can never serve God you can never please God amen so we need to lose our mind your reasons your feelings and your opinions lose it and get the mind of Christ because that is the only way we can please God by the mind of Christ amen amen hallelujah what a wonderful savior we are saving may God help us to surrender our way to him our choice to him our desire to heal Lord not my will right right not the way I want to live right what I want to do look how I want to do it right not where I want to work tomorrow and how I want to live but where you want me to go yes what you want me to do amen how you want it to be done let me die to my ideas and my thoughts right so that I will have the mind of Christ amen that's what the Bible told us by revelation offer them to God a more excellent sacrifice than came the Bible said God took him hey can't you see whatever has done if you want to be accepted do whatever has done amen brother Branham said but kid was too proud to Humble his pride too proud amen amen don't be too proud and forsake your way and Camp he's provided way because the race provide that way in everything yes sir that's right and the Bible says amen ask for God his ways are perfect yes right amen so we are asked to forsake our own ways and take his way that is why he says a prophet and the mind of God comes to the prophet and the prophet preaches the word of the Lord and he tells us he receives from God and then he declares the mind of God Amen he receives from God and he declares the mind of God because a prophet is raised up above an ego yes the flash so I and this is far and amen that's why the rich the Watchman on the tower amen watch man what of the night yes yes I said a Watchman has to have good sight yes amen so they get somebody that is good and so God's prophets are eagles so the gospel and they go into God and they kept the thoughts the mind of God and they bring it out hey my sons my daughters this is the way I want you to live God makes his mind know surely the Lord God will do nothing but reveal it his Secrets unto himself and the prophets amen so he sent us a prophet in our day he has done it through all generations and in our day he has done it again and he said a prophet to bring us the mind of God Amen brother Branham said I don't say these things of my own that's right I am just a voice that's right man it is what I surrendered myself to yes may God help us yes amen and when he brought him out it seems they were led into a trap it seems but it was not it was the enemies that was brought into a trap amen because when they came they came rushing and right behind them their enemies were coming yeah yeah and they begin to accuse the leader oh in the evening lost confidence in their leader they said let's make another leader and go back foreign let's go back just like today some of our breeding are going back right right they want to come back they take the leader has made a mistake the leader is not good enough but God was the one that choose that leader to lead them it was his mother's choice it was God's choice and so it wasn't brother Brandon's choice amen it was God's choice it wasn't Isaiah's Choice it was God's choice and it is not your choice it is God's choice hallelujah praise the Lord anyway don't think me to be crazy but if you think me to be crazy that's why hey because I have already told you you need to lose your mind amen amen praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah now the prophet of God said my if anytime it ever look like they ought to retreat was then but God has no retreat there is no place to retreat in God go forward [Music] the doctor says it is cancer go forward if he says it is go forward if the devil says you can't give up this go forward if your home says you are going to be a fanatic go forward yes the church takes you out go forward there is no retreating back go forward and go forward what his word and go forward thus saying the Lord and move on God brought him out of Egypt and they see they were brought into a trap but the prophet said God like to do things that way yes to give you a fire he said and as soon as they came out of Egypt God we found LED them right into a trap yes where Pharaohs Army behind them the rest see on either side and God put them to test and they got scared and it provoked God and said why do you cry to me just speak and go and God I like that notice they came to the Wilderness of sin where the waters were bitter matter why did God lead them to Bitter Waters why did God let the people to Peter what is it looks like he didn't have led them to good Waters but he led them to Bitter Waters so he could proved their faith he likes to do it amen he likes to let tribulation come to you to show he can to show he can show you his love and his power amen yes God brought them right there to give them a test to give it a trial and remember eating every one of us right has to be tested and tried yes amen none of us is with that fire right the Bible says us intestinesis he prays amen he tries amen heck he will do it but remember in my prayer will be different from your trial that's right amen amen your trial may be different from man so it is not wise to compare yourself to anybody it's not a wise thing to do and a spiritual person will never do that and you look at oh look at this one everything is fine for her everything is fine for this one that's what you are thinking it's just your thoughts right yeah at the Sun a child of God will be tried and brother Branham said the Christian Life if one is not absolutely centered on the word of the Lord right the Christian Life if one is not absolutely centered on the word of the Lord the Christian life holds a lot of disappointment amen amen it seems like that but he said just disappointments are guns with happening to us yes he said it might not look like that but it is amen so don't blame anybody that's right and don't condemn yourself why me why don't you why don't you think yourself to be oh you are why you should not be tested that's good that's good why you should not have challenges why you should not have challenges will I get sick why shouldn't you get sick that's right why shouldn't I get this easy why should you look at this easy and the prophet said The more lawyer you are the more they tested right and he said if you have a trial you find favor with God that's right amen and he said because God has confidence in you amen amen and he knows you will stand the trial amen as he had confidence in you we read about them in the scriptures we'll read about job we learn about different one of them amen amen they were men of like passing as we are amen they trusted in God so why shouldn't we trust in God if the Bible days are still here with us right the Bible is still alive amen amen God is still calling amen God is still saving God is still healing amen God is still in control they can go forward in faith no matter what is on the way right he will make a way for you yes if you look back don't just go when he said go go and the children of Israel in this difficult hour God said to Moses tell the children of Israel to go forward and if he's here today with Timothy tell them to go forward right go for it your woman go forward mothers go forward amen amen husbands go forward amen straight go forward no matter what is on the way go forward right right speak and go forward in faith and the Lord will make a way because God will never apologize for anything that he says the prophet said God is true to his promise no matter what he has to do no matter what it has to do he is true to his promise but brother you have to go forward and then you will see the Jesus Jesus and then you will see the glory of God Amen you'll see the reality of God then you will know that God is hear that coming to God Must Believe that he is and is the reward of those who diligently seeking amen those who we trust stand the trial amen those who will go forward those who hold on see the glory of the almighty God hallelujah I love it don't compare yourself to anybody don't make that mistake because we are born for different purposes amen so through the flood some through the fire Central great sorrows going through fire so through the flood yeah yeah for tribulation yeah but all throughout amen it's just like pebbles amen it's all for a purpose yes my brother my sister is off of apples he has a purpose for your life for my life there's no reason for me to compare my life to your life it doesn't make sense that's right and that's not what we have been called for you read the scripture different things happen to different believers difference is happening today John the Baptist head was cut off when he said was cut off Jesus was on the scene he could have prevented but it was very right when John was arrested and he said was cut off he was buried without his head that's a prophet of the age was a prophet of God yeah right right the one that introduced the Messiah Jesus says of all that were born of women none greater than John the practice Yeah he was buried without his head amen Our Father determines that Our Father choose that our father permitted that yes yes but thank God he will come with his head on in them [Applause] oh the prophet of God said all wrong should be made right over there I have this they call this a part of my body it does not matter what it will be caught here over there it will be made right yeah yeah there'll be nobody there with a winning hand or triple leg no what a day that will be over there amen there will not bring the body over there there'll be no leaping over there there'll be no weeping over there there'll be no tears over there there will be no sun over there there will be nothing but peace peace and pray for peace oh what a

know as our brother was talking about going forward there are times that we have to wait on the Lord because we just don't know what to do one thing we do know we are going forward we have we know that there is no stand still go sideways we are going forward but sometimes we don't know exactly how to go forward and that's what prayer is about that's what really taking time to get on your knees and and know your position right right so you can walk with confidence when you're going and a lot of times when we go forward we're going into the trial that we don't want to go into amen amen but when we get in prayer God gives us Faith to go through amen it it does not matter if you're in a trial you have to go forward it doesn't matter if you've heard the word and you don't have revelation you pray for Revelation you it doesn't matter if you've got a revelation on on on baptism uh uh and you got you've gotten baptized you have to move forward and all of us are in a process of a more Sanctified life so there's there's nothing that we can't be moving forward in it it um and and I feel that every one of us um those of us that have homes have many responsibilities right many bills many responsible many things to take care of what we as Christians have many facets faucets as it were that God wants us to do as a body it isn't just one or two or three things God wants us to move forward in many things amen just believe the word that we heard today right and don't don't hold it true just for one or two things in her life but take it for everything because God wants to take us

our brother said rededicate rededicate ourselves to him our heavenly father we come to you in your name Lord the name above every name Lord and we thank you for the your precious word that you brought to us today Lord Lord a word of encouragement but also a word of direction for our lives Lord that we cannot stay where we're at that we cannot uh Retreat back and that we can't go our own way we

For Your Glory we pray these things in Jesus wonderful name Hallelujah we thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Lord wonderful wonderful Jesus you know I'm thinking I just had a thought you know we go through trials in the children of Israel they went through a lot of Trials did you know I believe Joshua and Kayla went through more they went through more no the children of Israel they complain and murmur through their trials that seemed like they were going through too many but Joshua and Caleb they were faithful they had to remain in the church for 45 years right amongst murmuring and complaining and they all quit didn't make it or died but Joshua and Caleb they had to go through all that to take the land so if you got more trials than it seemed than you should that's okay be
