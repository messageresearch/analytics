that we can know for surely that is will never never leave us is a is a true revelation from god once you have it it's it's there but there's a there's a difference between the knowledge of the truth and the unveiling or the revealing of the truth well praise the lord god bless you let's um just say a word of prayer we're going to have you be seated after we read these scriptures father as we come to this part of the service lord we just want to take a moment and thank you lord that that the doors have been opened today and lord you've allowed us to gather together in your presence and to express our love to you lord to to give you praise and thanks and to remember all the good things laura that you've done for us for you're surely worthy of all the praise that we can give you this morning lord father i pray that you'd come and visit with us in the unveiling of the word i pray lord for every individual that's here this morning lord that you would visit them go by their their seat and lord work in their minds and in their hearts and in their conscience and lord reveal to them who they are in a greater measure let them see themselves in the scriptures today lord i pray that they could feel your presence in the unveiling of the word and lord i pray for the many hearts that could not be here today i ask lord that you would be with those that are tuning in right now lord to to receive the word lord i pray that your presence would be in their homes in the places that they're at and father that you would bless them abundantly knowing that lord that they would be here this morning if it was in their power and i just pray that you'd bless them for that lord be with brother bruce as he's ministering away lord just let him be a blessing and a help to those people in that church father we ask that uh now that you just take these scriptures lord make them real to us as we as we read them and ask that you'd give us grace to to get out of the way to only speak those things lord that would be anointed by the holy spirit this morning we thank you for these things we humbly pray in jesus christ's name amen amen two scripture readings this morning the first is the second timothy chapter two verse one and then matthew chapter 22 verse 14 and brother bruce made a mention i made mention about these screens here can can be um be more of a curse and a blessing because we can just rely on those screens to show to show us the scriptures when really we should be reading our bibles daily amen as the prophet taught us all right second timothy chapter two verse number one thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also amen thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man warth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who have chosen him to be a soldier amen and then in matthew 22 verse 14. matthew 22 verse 14 jesus said for many are called but few are chosen god bless you may be seated brother johnson i left a message on her our phone last night that he wants to say thank you for all your prayers for sister johnson and brother johnson she is doing slightly better but it's going to be a long recovery because of the fracture and to also pray that she could get uh more help there because they're short staffed and she might have to be moved to another location so brother johnson requested that we pray for her concerning that and uh i just i want to say thank you to all those that uh labored uh yesterday uh making some outreach cards here at the church and there was 42 cards made reaching out to some heart and i just if we could look at that those cards are full of love for some soul that needs more of god amen and the bible tells us they that are strong to bear the infirmities of the weak and and and to be partakers of the laborers that build the body of christ it's not just somebody else but it's it's me that needs to be laboring so we appreciate them there's a couple more uh pictures of of them working and what uh wonderful pictures and i just heard a a real wonderful testimony from my daughter ann she says in that moment when we were doing that if i could chose to been anywhere in the whole entire world i would choose to be exactly where i was because she just knew that she knew that she knew she was in the presence and the will of god at that moment and i think it's important that we know our position we know our place um and i just want to say thank you to all you that were reaching out i also want to thank brother jonathan sister gabrielle probably don't want me to to say anything but that's just the way i am um so get used to it but i appreciate them laboring to clean up the flower beds to make the house of god look look like god deserves our best amen we appreciate them very much now these uh scriptures they may look familiar to you are they do they look familiar you remember last service these scriptures were read in fact there were three scriptures read in the last service that we'll be reading today but after service i took brother bruce in the back and i often uh come here on wednesdays and study early and even though i knew i wasn't preaching they came here and i was studying and the lord had dropped something in my heart oh about a week or two ago there was a video that went was going around and um i just saw it one time a week or two ago and and then i think there was like two other people that sent me that same video it's where i got this message from this morning but i began to and it thought was quickened to me and and then i i finally began to sit down and put some scriptures to it and so when i brought brother bruce back i showed him my first page and a half of notes were the three scriptures my opening scripture was this scripture my topic was a chosen soldier and i don't believe it was ironic but i wanted to encourage him that god was working in the ministry and it's my desire that this morning that you'd not only be encouraged but that you could find your place in the scriptures you've got to find yourself in this bible you can't just i'm a i'm a christian i'm saved and that's no you've got to find your position because we're in a battle brother branham says we're in the greatest battle over fault in this great battle where it's at is in our heads it rages in our heads our our heart should be fixed it should be on jesus christ but brother branson says god or satan chose the mind and it it it it is the the the battleground we may think uh uh it the war is is raging in the world uh with chaos and confusion and there's uh wars and transgenders and and politics and socialism and in in a way versus role or whatever else is going on out there but that's not the battle they are distractions the real battle is between good and evil faithfulness and unfaithfulness remaining in the vine and trying to bear the fruit with just knowledge to the believer there's the battle the battle is here we we hear the word we've got to believe as the song we sung he is here and we've got to believe the word that's being preached so i'll say this this message um may uh be like a personal testimony of me you may think i'm bragging a little bit here as we get through this but i want if you can identify yourself in these scriptures i want you to say amen to the word find your place and and you cannot go into the army and choose not to fight you can't choose where you're gonna go you are told what to do and as long as you're in the army you have to do it as a christian it's no different it's not so your relationship isn't so personal between you and god that the only thing that matters is you do what you want to do god is our commander amen we follow his instructions we follow his word romans chapter 7 verse 19 the battle is in our mind paul said for the good that i would go to do i do not but the evil which i would not go to do that i do how many can relate to that now if i do that which i do not want to do it is no more i that do with it but it's sin that dwelleth in me not my brother not my sister not my neighbor not my employer in me i find then a law that when i would go to do good evil is present with me you can't just look on the television look on your phone see this news about some evil going on and say that's the evil you've got to identify the evil inside yourself you've got to deal with that you've got to battle that our flesh cannot escape the evil that's inside our nature and the pursuit of every christian should be the desire to get more of the holy ghost because that is the only thing that would defeat the evil in our nature the only thing not my brother it's not my sister but it's me o lord standing in the need of prayer james chapter 4 verse 1 says from once comes wars and fightings among you can they not hence even of your lust and uh the you're lost at war in your members do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us it lusteth to envy now it's hard to to admit that there's wrong spirits inside of us we like to think that there's no wrong spirits inside of us and there's just they just kind of get on us once in a while and unfortunately we we're not able to war a good warfare when we think like that the devil is constantly battling to the avenue of our selfish nature to subdue us and to bring us down ephesians 6 verse 12 says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places those high places aren't just the government it's not just the pope it's the high place in our head those places is where the spirit can get in there and anoint us and and cause us to to put our weapons down to put a shield down to to take off our armor and to relax these spirits will entice us to do whatever our flesh wants it would try to consume us with the cares of this life try to get us so busy that we become confused about things luke 21 verse 35 for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth and brother bruce was encouraged when he saw that these scriptures were written down hours before he preached this message watch ye therefore and pray always lord look at this scripture that he be counted worthy to escape all the things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man notice here it's not the blood of jesus christ that makes you worthy it's you praying without ceasing you got a job to do you just can't claim the blood when you want to you've got to keep praying and keep praying and keep praying that you can escape because it's true prayer that god reveals to you the truth because through the course of the day you're going and this is going you got this going and you think you're so right which the only time you realize you're wrong is when you hit a brick road but you get down in prayer and then that's where god can show you amen to escape we need to keep separating ourselves from this world to love not the world the things of the world don't get comfortable don't allow yourself to get conformed to this world brother bruce said gird up your loins with truth put your staff in your hands make sure your your shoes are are prepared because we are leaving here in a rapture we are leaving that means be ready soldier has to be ready now no man our opening scripture here at verse 4 no man that warth entangleth that means involve or intertwine or mix himself with the affairs of this life whoa there's a line that you do not cross you don't get involved you don't intertwine and you don't mix why that he may please him who have chosen him to be a soldier we've been chosen to be a soldier that means you can't be a soldier and entangle yourself with the things of the world christian soldiers don't involve themselves to get pleasure for self or to build self but we have been chosen to build the kingdom of god we don't want to become lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god now that war that word wareth no man wareth means warfare to serve in the military campaign amen to execute the office of an apostle with its difficulties with its duties with its responsibilities and to contend with carnal inclinations in other words the devil's coming to speak to us how many times you come to church and you didn't want to hear what you wanted to hear and the devil tried doing everything he can to get your mind on something different you're right in the middle of a battle and not even realizing it we're in a warfare whether we like it or not we can deny it and think that the only war that's going on is outside of me out there in the world or we can come to grips with the reality that the battle is actually inside each and every one of us nobody's exempt from this not our young children not the oldest amongst us the forces of good and evil are at odds with us every one of us and their goal is to bring us down god has called many to his army but he's only chosen a few i want you to catch that many are called but few were chosen i wonder why god would call somebody but he wouldn't choose him because not everyone is willing to go the straight and neural path they want to still be a christian but they want to go the broad way the way that everybody else goes the easy path jesus said for many are called fewer chosen in other words not all that say lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of god but he that doeth the will of the captain of our salvation many will come to me in that day and say i thought i was in your army prophesy spoken tongues i cast out devils i did many wonderful works but he only chose a few think about 1.8 million came out of egypt and he only chose to only two were willing to go all the way the others thought it was no problem to murder and complain and be to be half-hearted and take church lightly there's two that holy followed jesus amen holy followed the lord jesus said in luke 9 verse 62 no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for his army we're not fit to be in the army if we start out working for the lord and then we kind of look back and say well there's other things i could be doing this is you know the most important noise a lot of times you say well you can do this and that at the same time he'll find a way to bring the world in but god doesn't have anyone in his army that is looking back they're all moving forward onward christian soldiers marching as to war if you find yourself in the scriptures just say i believe luke 14 verse 25 and there went great multitudes with him and they wanted to enlist in his army and he turned and he said unto them if any man will come after me and hate not his father and his mother's wife his children brother and sisters yea even his own life he cannot be my soldier how many people in the world think they're god's soldier but they haven't forsaken a thing deceived by the master of deceit and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my soldier so likewise whosoever be of you at verse 33 sorry so likewise whosoever you be uh whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he have he cannot be my soldier god requires all of you you're bought with the price you belong to god you don't call the shots anymore you don't do what you want to do you a soldier says not my will thy will be done a a soldier of god says the uh if it would be the will of the lord we will go here we will go there we will do this we will do that because we're a soldier of jesus christ now this ain't for everybody but i'll say if you find yourself in the scriptures say amen that's for me because if you don't put the devil in his place he's going to stay in yours many have been called into god's great army but they haven't been able to get through boot camp and until you're willing to go through boot camp how can you be fit for god's army chosen for god's army i would say just about every the talk of everybody going into the army is i'm not looking forward to boot camp nobody wants to go through boot camp has anybody been in the army here no okay well it's not something that you like jump up and down for being told what to do and and and and some man trying to get all the smirks and sarcasms and your little big tough stuff out of you not fun being pumped down to being humble obedient look at jesus told his soldiers in luke 21 verse 12 they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake you talk about things that you're going to have to go through there's a reason you go through boot camp it's to toughen you up and if we're if we're getting bothered every time somebody says something to us that ain't just perfect something's wrong with our relationship with god we're not tough enough come on i love it guys i got to hear some amens amen john 16 verse 1 jesus said these things that i've spoken unto you that ye should what not be offended don't be offended they should put you out of the synagogues yeah the time cometh that whosoever killeth you they're actually going to think they're doing god a service think about it how perverted people are when they mistreat you they don't even know what they they're actually when somebody cuts you down especially from the pulpit they actually think they're doing god a service but they don't realize they're being used by the enemy it's the truth how many times have you thought oh yeah this is the lord you found out you were wrong so we can actually think we're doing god a service and find out it wasn't him at all it was just us wanting to do something paul's speaking the hardships of a true christian in second timothy chapter 3 verse 10. he says but thou has fully known my doctrine my matter of life purpose faith longsuffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at antioch iconium lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the chief captain the captain of the army he delivered me that's why we have to go through boot camp because when we go through things we've got to remain faithful we got to remain fruitful we got to remain in love with our enemy no matter what they do to us yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus are going to go through this but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and been assured of knowing of whom thou has learned them amen continue in the things that thou has learned continue to seek more holy ghost do not be satisfied with how much you got get on the side of i need more and i got to get busy getting more learn to wait in prayer for the power of what you believe in you say you got the holy ghost wait on the lord for power that's what jesus said acts chapter 1 verse 8 but you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem judea and samaria and unto the most part it sounds like when you get the holy ghost your witness wherever you go supermarket grocery store not just church you're a witness everywhere the holy ghost is not just constantly coming in and out of you like a you know door that goes open and closes all the time you know what i'm trying to say boot camp teaches us to deny ourselves that's why we got trials that's why we go through trials boot camp teaches us to deny ourselves to deny our own will that's something we don't want to do we don't want to give up self but unfortunately that nature is going to be there jesus knew that there's a difference between your thoughts and god's thoughts god's thoughts are much higher with god's thoughts it involves sufferings persecutions pain the denial of flesh faithfulness amen but your thoughts are often without that so when you think you're right just know every man is right in his own eyes remember we got to reach beyond what we're thinking and say lord show me show me because if you don't ask that question you're going to walk in what you think is right if we don't surrender our life to god we'll end up whining and complaining about everything all because we didn't surrender our life now i know this is strong word but i'm talking to the soldiers of god's great army i'm not talking i trust that i'm not talking to anybody that's just called i hope i'm talking to those who have been chosen because this ministry is not good for those who don't want to go all the way this is not the ministry god doesn't have whiners in his army i can't believe i got to do this i can't believe they're they're asking me again come on it's not an army of murmurs and complainers it's an army of overcomers an army of of obedient children amen dedicated believers that's the army we're in brother branham said the message greater than solomon is here he says and there's where we fail the church needs tonight not a soft high bred something soft and flabby like the church is now this is his definition of a ch ch chaby flabby church he says just make a confession be baptized and you're a christian although quote that scripture oh yeah he that believeth is baptized he'll be saved but that's all they'll do they'll quote that to that thing is dead and they'll they'll bypass every other thing in the word that tells them what to do and brother branham says it's a soft church he said to be a christian is self-denial that's his definition of a christian self-denial deny yourself take up your cross and follow me according jesus today it's so soft and people call themselves christians when it used to mean death to confess christ and you had to depend on on him daily for everything you need the same god lives today and i know that's to be true yesterday we were in a restaurant and as we all do uh we bowed our head and we prayed uh didn't know but the waiter was behind us and he heard a prayer and when we were done he said amen and he came over start talking he says you know i don't know so many people are afraid to to to uh mention the the name of jesus christ out in public and he's we should never be ashamed he said of our lord jesus christ in the message the seed does not air with the sha brother says the higher you go the more you can see speaking of an eagle so it's time for eagles of this day to get flying higher to dig into the promises of god so you go higher by digging deeper in the promises of god and not live on vulture food that's been killed years ago oh i believe this hey let's go forward what what what what are you eating on let me ask you a question how many watches tv in here how many don't want to be honest imagine you watching the same show over and over and over and over and over and being satisfied with it no so why do we want to have a relationship with christ that way how about just get on our knees until we hear something fresh from god get some new leadership from god amen amen he said politics voting in and out basically of the church saying this that or the other and the holy spirit has no more right of way in the church than nothing no more prayer meetings flesh don't like to go to prayer meetings no more prayer meetings no more agond agonizing with god to fulfill his word there's nothing coming out of the believer that's agonizing god i won't be satisfied until i awaken your likeness no more believing the word is still the same yesterday today and forever they just vulturalized down put their name on the book and got lazy and soft and sit back there gloating on some kind of dead carrion now that's the prophet of this age what he had to say i believe god doesn't want us in some stale army that all we do is have some label above us i believe that we should be written epistles read of all men whether we're in a home and i'll tell you you shine the greatest when there's the greatest problem that's where christ really has a chance to shine when when everything is against you and people hate you and and things are going wrong that's the time to show god to show the world and show god how much you love them jesus said in revelation chapter 3 verse 19 he says now we're talking about the boot camp okay well we got to go through it as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent now look what happens here behold i stand at the door of every heart and knock see many are called if any man will hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me and i'll say to every soldier that overcometh will i choose i will choose to sit down with me on my throne even as i've overcame and sat down with my father in his throne a chosen soldier is an overcomer he that have an ear let him hear with the spirit saith unto the churches i wonder this morning how many believes the spirit of the lord is here i wonder this morning who has a ear to hear what god is speaking this morning amen amen don't don't let the devil come and whisper in there jesus said my chosen soldiers they hear my voice and they follow my command that's the chosen now many are called but they hear different voices that doesn't mean that you don't got to do that that's not important this is the only thing that's important and they begin to be god themselves instead of allowing the word to be god to them they become god instead of they take the mark of the beast that's why the mark of the beast is the same thing as the mark the name of a man the number of a man 666. man was made on the sixth day his own will it's it's horrible we've got to get out of the world and get into the holy ghost jesus said the kingdom of god suffereth violence and the violet take it by force since john the baptist men press their way into the kingdom he said straight as the gate narrows away and only a few chosen soldiers will make it now those are just his words they're not my words it's not my take i'm just staying with the gospel god's chosen army is strong they're not babies they're strong in their minds they can take correction they can take rebukes they can take instructions without excuses we got more excuses today than ever before they can be told no and they won't get offended they have great peace because they love god and they love his code of rules that's what the bible says great peace have they that love my law and nothing shall offend them we've got to love this is the soldier's code book of order conduct and order right here and this is what every christian soldier goes by not what you want to do not what you think is right but you got to have it line up and i'm so glad god sent a prophet in this age to tell us how to dress tell us how that tell us about our hair tell us about everything because if he did it this world would be in terrible shape it is the bride right here that's holding off the wrath of god hebrews chapter chapter 12 verse 3 how many has ever been bothered because you're being corrected okay good i love honesty love honesty find yourself in the scriptures here let this encourage you and strengthen you hebrews 12 verse 3 for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be worried and faint in your minds in other words if you think you got hard which you got to go through think about what jesus had to do he was carrying the world the people of the world their sin on him and they hated him they weren't saying oh yes die for me thank you for helping me there was no bandwagon there was no uh parade there was no we're with you even his disciples left him at the end he was left all alone and he had to make this decision by himself not my will but mine be done so consider him consider him unless you think that your trial is so much hard that you can't go through it verse 5 and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as your children my son despise not the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chastened it scorcheth every son whom he receiveth and if you endure chastening god deal with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not that's a small brat right that's who that would be i remember this is a big thing you you that are parents there were times that your child was not acting the way you wanted them to act and you would say that is your child to your spouse go get your son no you go get yourself not my son that's your son look at the way he's acting you know so we got this when they're they're small and their babies oh don't they look like you know they look more like me you know they look more like me you know run to look like us but when they start acting bad no they look like you it's just weird how you know things change but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons now this is such a scorcher if you don't let god deal with your heart and conscious you're identifying yourself as being number one disconnected the scripture is saying here if you if you if you won't take correction god cannot be your father it's that simple it it's like it's like this um uh i'll just say ann ends my my my daughter and and if jonathan or brother mike or brother ron came to her and said well i want you to wash my car and i want you to get the groceries and i want you to cut the lawn and i want you to do all these things and and you better you better get to church five hours earlier and she said wait a minute you're not my father you're my father i don't have to do that and when you say i don't have to do what the words asking me to do or telling me to do this morning what you're saying is you're not my father i know this is strong but we've got to understand the scriptures there's nothing wrong with correction what what's wrong is there when there's separation between you and the scriptures that's what's wrong that's what we can't have we've got to be identified with it verse eight but if he be without chastisement we're of all our partakers then are you bastards and not sons amen first nine furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reference we had to if not we got whipped again shall we not much rather be subject unto the father's spirits and live for they verily for a few few days chasing us after their own pleasure in other words their motive wasn't right they were so mad they had to let it out that is not the right spirit of a parent you don't do that to your children you do not correct them out of anger you do not correct them because you're upset that is absolutely wrong get your spirit under control then approach helping them because that's what we're called to do but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness in other words that's why he's chasing us so we can become more holy now no chastening for the president seemed to be joyful but grievous nevertheless afterwards it yielded the peaceable fruits of righteousness unto them which say you know what i'm going to let this correction happen to me i'm going to exercise this i'm going to go to church i'm going to take the word i'm going to come subject to the word i'm going to say amen to the world i'm going to start obeying the word then you're going to get the peaceable fruits of righteousness wherefore lift up your hand lift up the hands which hang down and the feet and the feeble knees and make straight the paths for your feet god wants us to be encouraged right in the middle of his correction now we've not only been called to god's great army but we've been chosen john 15 16 you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and have ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain we went over these scriptures that whatsoever yes of the father in my name that he may give you so we've been chosen to bring forth fruit and that our fruit as a soldier should remain amen in other words at one time we used to be faithful as a soldier you need to remain faithful you can't be in the army for four years six years eight years and finally decide you're going to go do what you want to do and you're not going to do what the commanding officer told you to do and you can't go to him say hey listen i've been a christian for six years i've been in the army for six years i followed instructions faithfully for six years there's no excuse to not do it today you've got to remain faithful that's the only way you can remain fruitful amen we've been chosen to bring pleasure to the one who chose us from the foundation of the world he chose us to be a soldier in the army not just to say we're a christian to take time to tell the devil to get out of your mind take time to resist those thoughts we don't entangle ourselves with the affairs of this life we don't slough off and lay out a church and and try not to pay our tithes well we won't go and then we can save on tithes we don't give a bunch of excuses of why we're not a faithful soldier a good soldier of jesus christ is at his post of duty every time the doors are open in fact church is so much on his mind he can't wait to get there and if that's not how you're feeling you got to get back have a little talk with jesus amen a good soldier is punctual prompt and prepared for his captain's orders the three p's he goes to church to receive his commands his next deployment as it were what he's supposed to do where he's supposed to go he don't come just to learn he comes to become he comes to become not just to learn we've been chosen to be a strong soldier one that can endure hardness not easily provoked or offended or feeling sorry for ourselves a strong soldier is strongly in love with his captain's word you say you love jesus love the word love his word don't separate them they're not two different things this isn't just some book that god reads in heaven once in a while he is the word and when you believe it it becomes living in you fall in love with the word not just the feeling of his presence everybody wants to be blessed by the presence brother branham told us it ain't just the wheat that goes that the hot and dry and and want rain and the shower is a blessing but it's the weeds and when they get the the blessings they shout they're happy they're excited but they don't want to live for god and i'll tell you living for god isn't at your convenience it's hard it's a hard rugged life loving loving is hard and rugged what a revelation in that a strong soldier has so much peace in his heart that nothing will offend him think about it a soldier that becomes strong is one that has been tested brother brother bruce talked a little bit about that testing didn't he they can endure hardness they can take correction they can follow orders without having to understand the orders without having to agree with the orders can you imagine going in the army and say i am not going to do what you tell me to do until i understand why and you know what i got to make sure it's right and then if i agree with you then they'll start doing what you tell me to do but you know that's how a lot of people come to church got to understand it right there in the scriptures he didn't say if thou understandeth you got to believe it you got to take god as word this is a walk of faith if the word says that you can have confidence in it don't have confidence in your understanding if you're leaning on your own understanding then you're never going to get peace that passeth all understanding because your understanding has limits god's thoughts are higher we've got to be battle ready we got to take the word and the message of the hour we got to fight the good fight of faith i believe a strong soldier he's instant in season and he's instant the same out of season because he's he's prepared he's ready for whatever is given to him now i'll tell you if this is you find yourself in these scriptures forget about how you feel say amen to the word because it's your faith becomes the word if you don't believe it you will not become the word i mean think about it the angel lord came to mary and says you're going to have a child how is this going to happen i don't know no man she had to say be it unto me according to thy word when you say amen you're saying be it unto me according to thy word lord they've been trained by the holy ghost to know the attitude of their enemies they know they're living in the very hour where believers are not going to endure sound doctrine they're going to be constantly looking for an easier way they're not interested in the old-time gospel preaching the cleansing of the soul no but rather after their own lust and desires and beliefs they shall heap to themselves personal teachers slowly turning away their ears from the truth and turning their heads towards what an easier gospel that's what fables are an easier gospel that word fables means imaginary pretense friction like a fairy tale that's an easier gospel there is no easy gospel there's only one gospel and it's dripping with blood our flesh may not want it but it is the full gospel that brings holy ghost conviction and stirs our heart to press into the image of christ now i've been to concerts and if you go to a concert that's you know usually songs or they enter into the soul quite easy and they make you feel good when you leave you hardly leave a concert and say that was bad you always feel good you might even cry but there is a difference between feeling good and having the word come live inside you jesus didn't pawn he punches he said if you're going to follow me you got to give everything up he didn't trick him he didn't say just come you know put your name on the book get baptized and everything's okay no there was more to it than that and soldiers of the cross we must take the whole word of god we must come to church expecting to hear from god not a feeling don't wait for your feelings to get turned on i'm turned on remember remember i don't know his name i'm hooked on a feeling i'm high in believing we're not hooked on a feeling we're hooked on the word brother brandon said the those out word uh manifestations were just the bait on the hook the hook is the gospel we've got to be hooked to the gospel hook to the word paul said i have not shunned to declare unto you the whole gospel of jesus christ i'm so glad when we read the bible there's nothing missing it's all there a good soldier jesus christ has been trained to not entertain thoughts of an easier way oh my he he knows it when the he just shuts that thing right off to jump on some bandwagon that it really doesn't matter if you follow what was spoken this morning at church a chosen soldier cast down those types of imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and he brings into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ now that's what a chosen soldier does not a called but chosen and he has a readiness to write revenge all disobedience when his own personal obedience is fulfilled don't you love that god expects full obedience from us full obedience now we can't be perfect people that's not what i'm saying but what i am saying is you need an attitude of i want to please you more you don't have that you're not going anywhere a chosen soldier always has their christian armor on and i'll leave it off as i'm hanging out with my worldly friends so i'm just going to leave it off they know they're not warring after the flesh that the weapons of the warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds so a chosen soldier has to have his armor on we've been chosen to be strong in the lord and the power of his might the bible says we've been chosen to put on the whole armor of god that we're able to stand against the wiles of the enemy we haven't been chosen to stand against our brother our sister a family member the government the schools no sir we've been chosen to fight the good fight of faith against principalities powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in the high places of our mind any good soldier jesus christ knows that the it takes the whole armor of god to stand strong in this hour because more demons have been released in this hour than any other hour evil is growing worse and worse and we can't make it on knowledge we can't make it on well god knows i'm trying no you've got to take the whole word of god i believe all the people that don't make it at one time or another they tried all those people did many wonderful works and prophesied spoken tongues and cast out devils and did these things and didn't make it what about the foolish virgins that didn't take oil in their lamp they still had a sincere desire to try they still went to church they lived clean lives they hate they hung out with clean people but they didn't think they needed the holy ghost they thought they had enough you know justification is the holy ghost but it's only a part of the holy ghost and that's the problem we're not denying we don't have the holy ghost what we're denying is do we is there more for us that's that's the point in question because if we can come to grips that i need more well then we'll be seeking more and you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart don't be satisfied with where you're at dig into christ a soldier that has been chosen not just called but chosen he's always watching he's sober he's vigilant because he's aware of his adversary the devil he's walking about seeking whom he may devour you know you just look at the attitude of the people in the world the attitude of the people of the world is i'm not worried about going to hell afraid of the devil that's crazy so bring that attitude into the church i'm a christian i'm not worried about the devil oh you're an open target you've got to be strong you've got to be vigilant you've got to be watching because he's trying to creep in some way i know it looks like my my time is up but can i have just a little bit because we don't got communion i want to get i want to get to some good parts we're a chosen soldier a strong soldier doesn't play around with thoughts in his mind he will steadfastly resist the devil as quick as they come in a soldier that's been chosen is always battle ready ready to speak the truth in love ready to rebuke reprove exhort with all longsuffering to do the work of avengers to make full proof of his ministry that's what a chosen soldier does i want to see i want you to be able to find yourself in the scriptures you've got to you've got to find yourself here there's no other soldiers we're either chosen we're either strong or we're weak a soul a soldier who's made it through boot camp has been chosen to deliver the ministry of reconciliation to others he's been chosen as an ambassador for the captain they've been commissioned to go out to restore people to bring glad tidings and good news to the lost to the bound i want you to know you've got to identify do you see yourself in the scriptures today a chosen soldier is always ready to give an answer for the hope that lies within them he's been commissioned by almighty god to commit these instructions that god has given him to other men faithful men who will be able to also teach others and i wonder are we doing that do you find your place in the scriptures jesus said teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i commanded you you mean what you commanded me i got to tell others to do the same thing that's exactly what jesus said and he says lo i'm with you always even to the end of the world well by the grace of god i have run through a troop by the grace of god i have leaped over a wall because i am a chosen soldier i've made it through boot camp i can do all things through jesus christ i am a chosen soldier of the cross of love and suffering amen the cross when you look at the cross that was god's love for you but it also represented sufferings they're the same amen must jesus bear the cross alone no there's a cross for all of us and that cross is love that cross is suffering i can turn the cheek i can go the second mile i can love those who hate me why because i'm a chosen soldier i believe i'm a chosen soldier i'm a rugged soldier of love i pray with a burden for those who despitefully use me in other words i know what they're doing to me i know they're after something from me without trying to help me you find somebody that just wants to help you they don't want nothing out of it that's a chosen soldier but when you find someone they want something that you got power with then of course they want anybody does somebody that's hooked on drugs they'll get money from whoever they can they'll use them and use them and use them and use them if you're never going to get used you're never going to have the opportunity to fulfill the love of god but a chosen soldier can love somebody that uses them can continue continue moving on brother how can you do john i think it's simple i'm not my own i don't have any say so on the matter i'm bought with a price it's about learning daily to love not your life unto death it's about pressing in to perfect love it's not a gift god is not going to gift us with perfect love we got to go after it i am a chosen soldier of suffering love you know for the first time i'm hot in here and it's 69 good temperature but i'm sweating these things that they give you in the army they're hot how many likes my my army i've never worked before i was at a goodwill i don't know how many years ago i thought boy can use that sometime in the future and i thought about this message i am going to pull this out and i'm going to wear this i want something to help us remember the word today amen as a soldier as a chosen soldier i can lay down my life i choose to lay down remember jesus said the same thing no man takes it from me but i lay it down as a chosen soldier you can lay down your life you can live for others you can deny yourself your time your interests your plans in order to help somebody else get into god's army that's right by this shall all men know that you're in the correct army the life is in the blood the spirit of god brother and they said the token must be on display what a blessed opportunity we have every time we talk to somebody that's true and and to be honest with you we all when we engage with one another we're looking for that smile smile back hey how are you i'm doing good but we need to also remember that love flows so much greater than when everything's going good but when somebody's not doing good they don't want to talk to you they're avoiding you there's a time to love them in a greater measure and i believe a chosen soldier can do that they can esteem others better than themselves amen they're living for the captain of their salvation they want to follow the instructions i'll say i'm not turning back i'm not turning back for anything i'm chosen to go all the way i'm chosen for a rapture i don't need pampering baby sugar coating i long to be at my post of duty every time the doors are open i don't need popularity i don't need attention i don't need to to be noticed or to look at i keep my motives pure before the lord i don't need a reputation i don't need money i don't need to be looked at i just want to help as many people as i can get over that's all i want i don't want nothing else well brother john you don't understand the things you're saying don't don't make me feel good i'm not trying to make you feel good i'm trying to get you to believe the gospel i want to help those who are willing to live by all the word of god i can't do nothing about those who don't want to take the word you can't feel your way into the kingdom you gotta press it you gotta press you gotta suppress those wrong feelings and press into the kingdom i'm a chosen soldier and you know what soldiers don't make excuses i'm going to labor in god's army i'm going to be a peacemaker i will labor to help fallen soldiers and for those who have sown discord among the brethren in the army ranks i will discern the lord's body remember communion i will wash the dirt off my brother's feet spiritually speaking now you know if you're not part of a church you don't even understand to how to wash your brother's feet we're a local body to function like a local body together imagine if you just stayed home and listened to tapes brother bam tapes whose feet would you wash you you come you're part of the body so you can function as a body the body washes the body we function together and this is something that we're learning to do but we gotta we gotta actually get involved more don't say i'm involved enough say i need to get involved more walk further move forward you know i'm i i don't want just some cushy desk job in the army i want to get out there in the field i want to be next to my brothers and my sisters i want to help them when they're in the ditches when the bullets are frying when problems are happening i say my testimony i am a faithful soldier i claim being a fruitful soldier i will and it will remain that way to jesus comes i endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ paul said i will carry my cross every day i will deny my will i will pick up my cross for jesus christ every day i'm choosing this day and not just this day but every day i choose this day to follow the lord it can't just be one day i've chosen my habitation and my dwelling place is with the most high i've chosen to set my love upon him my affections on things above i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ i'm not ashamed of his dress code he wasn't ashamed to call me brother i'm not ashamed of him i'm not ashamed of his word i will not back down draw back or shrink or shrivel up i will look fear in the face and hold my beginning confidence steadfast to the end i'm not letting anyone or anything distract me from my calling i will not let anything keep me from getting more of the holy ghost for going after perfect love my memory may not want to bring it to my thoughts but something inside of me called the love of gods tell me go after it go after it go for more and i'll tell you i'm not a perfect soldier if i fall seven times i can tell you one thing i'm gonna get back up if someone deliberately hurts me i will forgive them if someone speaks ill of me and of my motive i will love them anyways if i offend somebody i'm gonna make it right even if it's by ex not knowing what you did offended somebody just make it right move forward if i fail i will get back up by getting down on my knees crying out to god that's how you get back up you get on your knees and you cry out to god i am a chosen soldier i will believe and obey the word i will build the kingdom of god i will hope for the best of all things i will bear all things that the captain puts in front of me because i've been chosen not just called in other words i've accepted what the captain says how many times have you heard people that joined the army i wish they wouldn't have because they think being a christian is you know easy being in the army is easy but when they realize the reason they were encouraged to go on the army is to get rid of that i'm going to do it my way attitude i don't know some people they really need that but praise god this this this army um in one sense you have to volunteer you do there's no way you're going to suffer god it has to go through three more agency amen we got to go into perfection we got to be a soldier that is looking to the author and the finisher of our faith we got to make a decision to forget those things which are behind and to press towards what god is pointing us to to his image how about you are you going to be conformed to the world my captain told me that i am not of this world i will not entangle myself with the affairs of this life that i may please the captain my salvation who has chosen me think about it he chose me to be a soldier how about you are you rapture ready will you be here at your posted duty when jesus comes i want to present my trophies to the lord i want to give back more talents to god than what he gave me i want to remain fruitful i will overcome by the blood of the lamb by the word of the testament i will choose i will choose to hate my life unto death i will study the devil's tactics i will not give in to the devil i will overcome and sit with jesus on his throne as he overcame and sat with his father on his throne i will overcome because i'm a soldier amen are you a soldier i got some questions for you have you been able to identify yourself in the scriptures this morning many are called to be soldiers but only a few are chosen there's only a few that are chosen to take the land it's not just something we agree with or even claim but it's something that we need to examine ourselves am i lining up with what i should be as a chosen soldier have i been at my post of duty have i made excuses and thinking i was only deceiving myself you know the bible says when you look at the word and you don't obey the word you're deceiving yourself now that's what the bible says you become your own enemy you actually are the deceiver of your own self have you been strong in the lord or have you been just strong in your own will last quote i want to read brother brandon was given an opportunity and we could just stand together to draw close to christ in this message called leadership he says now with our hands up i wonder how many in the building would now say would just say i'm going to stand i don't care who's sitting by you it's god talking to you and you really want to be a real christian see unless you're just impersonating i'd i'd rather go on out and be in the world in other words than just to be an impersonator i believe you would too he said he said now look he says just examine yourself by the word and by the message examine what a real christian should be rugged loving that's with only two words he used rugged loving not one of these modern christianity why a soft and flexible half dead rotten inbred see it's not real christianity live any kind of life you want to and belong to church don't you want that sweet fellowship with christ the holy spirit the conformity of your own heart to the word move right up into christ if you want that you would desire god to see you stand tonight right in this group if you'll just do it so here it is it's the end of the service what what would you like to do with this the word that god brought not the word that brother john brought the word that god brought to you to your heart do you want to do you want to move forward because when you leave the whole your whole life is going to be pulling you towards complacency it's going to be pulling you in the opposite direction of what we heard today and you got to leave here more determined to not let that happen on monday to not slip back but to keep pressing towards being that soldier is that your desire amen let's just sing must jesus bear the cross alone amen let the lord just speak to you buzz the cross alone and all the world [Music] for me [Music] shall set me free [Music] foreign [Music] with [Music] oh glorious [Music] go free [Music] amen how many feels that god is desiring you to carry the cross of self-denial it's up to us to to make the dedication that we can move forward becoming a very strong soldier now you would know someone would be strong if you could just hit him in the face and they would just stay there they wouldn't move but if you hit them and they started swearing cursing and who you think you are well they wouldn't be strong so strength is is being able to carry out the command's orders to turn that
