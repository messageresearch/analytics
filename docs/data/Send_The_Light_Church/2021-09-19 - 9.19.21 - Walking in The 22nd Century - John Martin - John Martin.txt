[Music] faith in god for the answer have faith in god [Music] amen we all have lots of questions lots of problems have faith in god for the answer amen there is no other place i'd rather go to and have confidence than in christ the only assurance that we have is is in the word and i'm grateful that he's provided for us a place where we can have confidence that we can hear the word and to think about that he chose the preaching and he calls it the foolishness of preaching that through the through man who is not perfect telling another man to be perfect god speaks to a conscious of a man and saves a man to just believing the pure word of god amen we're we're grateful that we have that confidence this morning amen turn with me if you would to the book of matthew chapter 5 for opening scripture and we'll have a just pray before we begin reading um in matthew chapter five just gonna read four verses there 13 through 16 how many is thankful to be in god's house today amen let's just ask him to come and bless this portion of the service heavenly father we thank you that you've given us an opportunity to come and worship you with brothers and sisters of light precious faith to express openly willingly just without fear and reservation um how much we love you how much we appreciate you and and thank you for the amazing grace that you've had in your life for all the things you've brought us through for your grace teaching us to fear when we didn't fear and then relieving those fears and giving us peace sublime lord we're in debt to you we thank you for this precious opportunity today that the doors are open we can come and gather together a family oh lord jesus we pray now that lord our hearts have been prepared for your word lord the ground is what it is and i pray lord that knowing that the ground will bring forth uh this the seed oh as only as far as it can lord we we all may be able to rejoice in the word as it comes forth and say amen but lord we're asking that the word would sink deep in our hearts find a dwelling place and stay with us when we leave here and go into our homes and our lives can be changed by the same word or we commit ourselves with all of our needs we know as we sung that song you have the answer lord our uh our our prayer is that we could look to you and believe that you will just meet every need in our life pray that a special blessing for those that are not here today those that are watching and that desire to be here but they cannot be i pray that you'd meet them in a very special way today lord lord we thank you for all these things now and ask your blessings lord and the scriptures everything that be spoken maybe for your honor and glory we pray in jesus precious name amen amen matthew chapter 5 starting with verse number 13 year of the salt of the earth but if the salt had lost its savior where we shall be salted is therefore it's not good for anything but you might as well cast it out and to be trodden down under everybody's feet ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works amen and glorify your father which is in heaven amen god bless you may be seated praise the lord notice they have to see the good works they cannot just see the words can't see words but you can see words manifested in your works and that's where the emphasis needs to be i'm entitled this message walking in the 22nd century that's where we're at before i get into this message i just want to say thank you again for all your prayers for the church in its progress we're grateful to the lord that he's brought us thus far i believe we got our permits at the end of july last year the end of july so it took a while to get them after we bought the building so it seems like it's been a long time and it's kind of been a long time because we're just anxious to get in there uh but it's just been over a year just a little over a year and we we did get our permit and we're we're grateful for that obviously we're trying to do just a little bit more in the areas that we're working to make it more presentable so we don't have to go in there now of course when you're going to go in there and you're going to see holes in the wall and stuff because we just do not have time to finish everything or else you know we just get it done for tribulation we take off you know it won't do us any good so our first service in the new church is going to be wednesday october 6th wednesday october 6th write that down and this service is just for us we're not allowed to invite anybody i don't want us to but the service afterwards which is sunday october 10th i want you to invite as many new people as you can to come and celebrate amen but i thought the first service would be good for just the family our family you know we've we have suffered the most we've been here for umpteen years in this fishbowl as it were and just been coming year after year after year god bless you god reward you with the rapture is my prayer um i i believe that every one of you i could be wrong but i believe every one of you are going to be blessed beyond what you think when we get there amen and you deserve it you deserve it so much well let's get into the message today walking in the 22nd century who would have ever thought we'd be walking in this in this 22nd century it's so spiritually dark brother branham couldn't see beyond going 1977. that's how much things have gone 44 years beyond 1977. paul told timothy evil would get worse and worse and we see it happening there's also at the same time that things are getting worse there's a great falling away right i thought i would never see the perversion that i'm seeing right i had my own ideas 20 years ago what was going to happen is in the days of la and it's nothing like i thought here's some 22nd century facts in this in this century there is a social media addiction addicted people are addicted in every fashion formal way to their phone they don't wake up thinking about looking at anything other than their phone first death from overdose of drugs has doubled in this century student loan crisis has more than doubled in this century there's an estimated 1.5 trillion dollars in student debt the only larger credit debt for the american is the mortgage debt which we understand you would not think that trying to get education would be such a business but it is researchers from the university of chicago call air pollution the world's top killer today it's cutting off an average of two two years of everybody's lives obesity and diabetes rates have increased according to the latest world happiness report happiness has declined in this century there's a great fear because hate for others has increased to alarming rates radical divisions political divisions and now how to handle the covid divisions there's divisions and right inside of it people all over the world feel more divided than they ever did a decade ago a survey of 27 countries from a majority of people and all but two countries feel that their society is divided siberia leads with 93 percent of the people believing their country is divided followed by argentina and chile in the u.s 84 of the people believe their nation is divided you can't hardly go anywhere and he and not hear about somebody passing away from either the colvid virus and now it's so much i'm hearing it about those that have taken the vaccine we had somebody come over a house just yesterday and told us somebody passed away it's it's happening more than what we realize it's it's causing such a fear and such a division because iniquity abound the love of many is waxing cold jesus said these things it's it's causing us to love less to love others less human trafficking has more than tripled since the last century human trafficking occurs in every country including all 50 u.s states it's plain to see the direction the world's heading straight into the greatest tribulation that has ever faced this planet death is all around us we're living in the hour of the great unknown amen whether it's spiritual death or natural death it's all around us we're hearing about it we're reading about it we're feeling it yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow death i will fear no evil why because thou art with me thyroid and thy staff they comfort me his word corrects and his word comforts and when we come to church it's okay to get some correction we know we're we're in line we want to be in line with him but his word brings a comfort to us as well he maketh me to lie down in green pastures this morning he leaves me beside the still waters and all the stuff that's going around out there in the world he leads us he causes us [Music] to just stop and hear his word he's leading us away from the turmoil the trouble the confusion and helping us to settle down amen thank god he makes makes us to sit still in church and listen amen you can see it's hard for some people brother brahms said in this message just one more time lord he said eliezer sweated it out till he found character in rebecca then he had to get her dressed up and ready let her stand still and listen at his message the trouble of it is today when you find character it's hard to make them stand still long enough to put the clothes on and get them dressed up in other words the message found the bride right but you don't want to get dressed with the word what the message is saying they're just happy to say i'm in the message what about getting dressed what about taking the word that's being preached and applying it to your life he's causing us to lie down amen still waters too often we assume that we know where we're at with god psalms 19 verse 12 says who can understand his heirs cleanse thou me from secret faults i got them amen now who can understand your heirs we think we don't got very many i'm pretty i only got this one thing verse 13 keep back thy servant also look at this word from presumptuous sense let them not have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be innocent from the great transgression amen presumptuous we're living in such an evil deceptive hour we really don't want to live presumptuously god has prepared a table for us in the presence of our carnal nature our greatest enemy we need to be hungry for god to come and show us what we're assuming is okay we need we come here to find out where we're at with god that's how come you know when we get that kind of attitude that's why we get so easily offended when we hear something true we need our our hearts anointed our cup running over because he wants to lead us in paths of righteousness amen now despite all the death that's around us we ought to be shining brighter than ever amen when jesus walked in his own physical body he said in john chapter 9 verse 4 i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work he said as long as i'm in the world i'm the light of the world now jesus is no longer in the world my question is is he in your world does he have liberty in your church or do you call the shots is your church man-made now it's harder to notice jesus in people's lives jesus was the pure word the fullness of god was in the body of jesus and look what they did to him he said how much more will they do to you it's important that we shine all the time john chapter 14 verse 19 jesus said yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye see me amen you see me the world don't see you but you see me because i live you shall live also and that that day you shall know that i am in the father and you and me and i in you praise god for a relationship with jesus christ now as we receive the living word not a dead letter but as we receive the living word we shine that word right amen but all if all we do is hear it carnally and we're not gonna we're not gonna shine it we won't manifest it so we've got to receive it matthew chapter 5 verse 14 are opening scripture jesus said no you are the light of the world i was when i was in the world but i'm going to be with you and now you are the light of the world and it's really not our light right people look at my light they're going to be in darkness that's true there's nothing there's no one good not one but we've if if there's anything good in any of us it's the light of god amen so you are the light of the world that's jesus in you a city that is set on a hill cannot be here jesus does not want you to hide in your house and say i'm a christian in the message neither do men light a can no put in her bushel but on a candlestick that it giveth light unto all that are in the house everywhere that your house goes you ought to be a light to the person you're talking to amen i don't care how much more light they have i don't care how much more spiritual they are you ought to be a light to them your modem should be shining he said let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven your works isn't necessary changing the oil or washing the dishes but your works could be changing the oil washing the dishes without complaining it's living a life so full of the holy ghost that when you're bumped nothing but love comes out my cup run is over bump it all you want you want us i mean somebody that's not filled with the holy ghost can become a very scary situation now you cannot be a light of the true gospel if you do not follow the word that's leading you out of darkness now here's the problem we come to church and we don't think there's any darkness that's right it's i don't ever come to this church and think there's no darkness in your life i will never believe that god will never believe that but you may believe that that's right right and that's why a lot of people do like coming to this kind of of of preaching because they don't want to hear about that just like you don't want to go to a funeral and hear about the person that's there made his choice that no matter what choice they make they want to go to a funeral and hear that no matter what he's going to heaven well that's not true but people want to hear that i want to hear where i'm wrong because that gives me a chance to get right and where i'm wrong is darkness and what he preaches jesus said in john chapter 8 verse 12 then jesus spake again to them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life so from the moment that he saved us from the moment that we got baptized we begin we started our journey to walk in the light amen at that moment we were illuminated amen we wanted to tell the whole world yes sir i'm saved i'm a christian but then we kept going to church and all of a sudden i got to get rid of my records i got to cut my hair i got a i can't tell dirty jokes and god began to show more darkness in our life calling us to get more serious with him and today he's still calling out of darkness calling us to walk in the light and we and as we walk in that light we now begin to manifest works of that light for instance if i just had a hot temper and i got upset every time my wife asked me to make the coffee i flew off the handle at her and i go to church and the minister is ministering and he reads the scripture uh be angry and sin not well i can either think that's just a man quoting the bible or i can believe god just spoke to me and if i believe god just spoke to me i'll go home next time my wife asked me to make coffee and i'll make it happily amen now people can behold my good works and glorify god which is in heaven it's okay that you're not perfect but it is not okay to have an attitude to be that way walk in the light in this hour i say it's the darkest hour known to mankind we ought to be shining the light for jesus more than we ever have it's the greatest darkness in the world but yet the brightest light is shining but what good is your light if it's just covered by a bushel god can use you in this hour how useful is a flashlight on a sunny day you might as well turn it off and save the batteries for night time brother sister this is the hour we need to be shining amen this is the hour god wants to use our lives to help people come out of darkness when it was at the church we have a lot of exit signs because we have a lot of doors i mean i changed 15 door handles and we still probably had another eight doors in the place we got so many doors you could tell it was just added on headed on and on but one of the things that we had to fix for our uh a final approval occupancy is we had to fix our exit signs now we have the exit signs there but they have to be illuminated and when the power goes out they need to go bright brighter so you got the little buttons you check them but the roger knows all about it and there was a sign over a cross you'll see it in the sanctuary there's one exit door and when he was pushing i really couldn't see it it just didn't look very bright with the lights on i thought well we got to change it he says no it's it's working it's fine so i went and turned off the light and boy that thing was so bright just turned the light off in the room and you could see it wow so when you're in a difficult situation and people are yelling and screaming and and uh you don't have no money to pay the bills and somebody hates your guts i don't care what's going on that's the moment you should be so bright so illuminated that they see jesus and not your flesh trying to retaliate you are the light of the world in this hour we ought to be shining a bright light in every conversation in all of our behavior and all of how we handle things that's where our light needs to shine nobody needs you to be able to tell somebody this is the way it should be we all know we've all been told i had one brother tell me this brother was telling me you know you hard to say this because i don't want to just i don't want to make mention saying not that it's bad it's not a bad thing but he just you know he made mention if you ever uh want to uh find out uh that what people who are overweight need to do just ask a person who's overweight they've been told more than anybody and it makes sense because they've been told by so many people this is what you need to do to help yourself he says that's easy i can tell you what needs to be done so when we're in our battles it's easy to say this is what needs to happen right now but what is needed is a life the holy ghost power to take care of the problem and that's what we're missing church that's why we need to come to the altar and pray for the holy ghost pray for power we don't need knowledge we don't come here to get knowledge we don't want to get pumped up with knowledge holy ghost well we're groping in darkness we ought to be shining the light bright paul wanted timothy to shine so bright that he told him think about this to be an example unto believers think about that statement it's not good enough just to be a little brighter than the unbelievers that you hang around with that you work with that you associated with that your neighbor is right amen right but let your lights be so bright that you're actually an example to other believers amen that's right wow that sounds like the lord i know this is not the hour to allow satan's lukewarm spirit to get all over you but i will say this this is satan's finest hour throughout everything this is his finest hour he spent all his time since leaving heaven to become the greatest master of deceit today he has learned throughout all the ages what works best to deceive the whole world that is true and this layout to speak this laodicean spirit to me is the crown of his deception think about it the spirit give people what they want so they don't need anything what a plan give people what they want so they don't want anything slight socialism right survey taken in 2019 they said socialism is spiking in the u.s more than 4 out of 10 americans believe that socialism would be good for the usa what in the world has happened but it'd be one of those subjects you know you don't want to talk to anybody about it you know what could cause some problems but see evil has no no qualms about pushing his self that's right and look we ain't changing it this country has already been prophesied it has already rejected the gospel of this message we're on borrow time it's now every man for himself yes for me in my house i'll serve the lord and as ambassador of christ i need to get the word to another soul forget about having a campaign about trying to get everybody behind me about how independent our country should be in our democracy is so great it's not coming back we're in the end time but we need to get souls say that's our job that's the light we need to be now satan has confused this world and they're going in every different direction made it hard for people to detect what's right what's wrong and this spirit in the church this need of nothing is actually confusing because you feel i'm okay and the preacher is just trying to make me feel bad when god's trying to get the light to you satan knows he has about a short time turn with me to revelations chapter four the laodicean spirit is the crown of his deception that's really good revelations chapter 12 verse 4 and his tale drew a third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for he for to devour her as soon as it was born you all been taught what this means and she brought forth a man-child who was to rule all the nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god into his throne now that you've got the church you've got the bride that came out of the church and she's caught up in a rapture to speak to to we will rule and reign with god amen and the woman fled into the wilderness where she have a place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and three score days or three and a half years and there was a war in heaven mike on his archangels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and that great dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world look at the power that he has the whole world not just those that don't agree with you the whole world he was cast out into the earth and the angels were cast out with him and i heard a voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god the power of his christ for the accuser of the brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night so here's satan he goes before god and he uses you and i before god but he didn't do this and they didn't do that and look at this and look at that and he's constantly accusing me and then when he gets turned down [Music] gotta put him in his place but he's still going about his dirty work he'll come to you and i and start saying things about one another yes right accusing the truth and if we say yeah that's right he did do that she did yeah they didn't yeah you're caught in that web and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb by the word of their testimony and they what they didn't care about their own life where do you stand with that where do you stand with that the only way you're going to overcome in this age is to hate your life not just today not during service not just to agree with it but until you die or to the rapture takes place because your flesh there's nothing good in that flesh and blood well not here at the kingdom of god god doesn't like it it says it's enmity with him amen that's right it gets us in trouble yes it makes us think we're something when we're not it's true amen it wants to exalt itself against the will of god therefore rejoice the heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the habitats of the earth and the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath why because he knows that he has about a short time a short time you know what is when you get somebody coming over the house or the inspector i couldn't even finish the job getting everything ready before the inspector come but i i i said i'll have it ready tomorrow so i had to get up and finish putting the door handles on i had to put the signs by the bathroom doors because i had but a short time the devil knows he has but a short time he wants to bring us down it's true and when the dragon saw that he was cast onto the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child i feel sorry for the foolish virgin who's left behind she was unwilling to suffer to lay down her life to die daily to pick up her cross and to follow christ and now she's going to have to suffer right a suffering that the bride will not have to suffer because she chose to sit in church and say lord jesus be it on to me according to your word amen mary bore the reproach we've got to bear the reproach this word is the only truth for us the devil knows he doesn't have much time left so that's why he's poured it on strong that's why we're hearing that little voice i don't need to submit to that that word isn't that important to me i don't need to be faithful to church attendance i don't really have to lay down my life god hasn't given me a burden for souls you know who's pouring that on that's satan the master of deceit speaking to our minds and we don't catch it that's right satan is pouring as loud as he has spirit on the church because he knows he has but a short time left but god is doing a short work as well matthew 24 verse 21 for then shall there be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time nor no nor ever shall be so we're talking about the great tribulation here that's right in front of us i think it's ushering in right now and he said except those days be what shorten none of us would be saved but for you and i just for the elect those days will be shortened amen we are blessed people today amen you know sure the word is hard sure this is not enjoyable but not take this over anything amen because just because we're elect if we do not get ready we do not go look about the one that got in there what did he say and i'm so sorry about moving so sorry when we get to the other place we won't have to worry about that anymore but there was someone that got into the wedding without the garment on they made it in but he didn't have the garment on and he kicked him out that's right we need this word it dresses us up [Music] we need to rejoice there's an hour where the bride will rejoice because she have made herself ready things are going to get so bad saints that god is gonna have to shorten things up while the confusing world is saying he delayeth is coming all things remain the same as he as it was from the beginning god is actually shortening up the hour for you and i he could come at any time amen then if any man shall say unto you lo here's christ or there believe it or not for there shall arise false anointings false people proclaiming christ and shall show great signs and wonders like i mean come on how can you deny it isn't this the message if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect to me the very elect has something that nobody else has they have such an intimate relationship with god they know firsthand what's what and what isn't where everybody else has what i call presumptuous sins they're assuming because i am so great because i am so alive i cannot be deceived two different spirits one is i know nothing right now without the grace of god amen amen stay humble amen god will give you more grace he promised to it's there in his word but it's nothing to be proud of it's everything to be humble i'm unworthy lord that you would call me your lack that you would protect me from deception of this hour god isn't through with israel yet he's going to do a quick work with her romans chapter 9 verse 27. romans chapter 9 verse 27 isaiah also cries concerning israel though the number of the children of israel be as the sands of the sea a remnant shall be saved for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness now i'm pretty sure that brother roger has caught wire before and he's cut it short and had to cut another piece sure brother stan has cut a board before and cut it short it wasn't long enough god is going to cut this thing short for israel but he ain't going to leave it without righteousness he's going to cut it short in righteousness he's going to get the job done because a short work will the lord make upon the earth as isaiah said before except the lord of sabbath had left us seed we had been like solemn and had been like unto gomorrah god is serious about the hour we're living in amen god is serious about what he speaks to us amen we ought to be sober we ought to be vigilant we ought to be recognizing satan trying to keep us what unprepared amen just in that state of lukewarm give you all that you want instead of all that you need right now if god is doing a short work and satan is doing her short work what ought you to be doing just kind of laying loose foot loose and fancy free you got two opposing powers that are serious about your soul yes and we're gonna walk around with the carefree i'm in the bride attitude my bible says the righteous scarcely make it right if they scarcely make it where's everybody else going to be i'd rather be fulfilling working out my salvation today with fear and trembling my confidence is in him my confidence is not in me there's the difference that's presumptuous yeah right it's true don't be presumptuous this is no time to be playing church flying under the radar as it were being lazy in the work of the lord no time to be groping around in darkness no time to allow yourself to be swallowed up with just everything that's happening in the world no time to be making excuses for missing church we should be hungering for more of the light of god inside of our beings not more knowledge right now let's just puff you up but having the knowledge of christ in your heart should we be casting off the works of darkness and walking into more obedient light i want you to think about that every one of us there's things in our life look you could just be as perfect as all get out to be when you leave here but by the next time you come to church i'm sure sure of it that god's going to want to be dealing with something in your life and that thing they wants to deal with is called darkness and when he gives us light and we become obedient to the light then we're walking in the light shouldn't we be working with haste to fight this lukewarm layout is he in spirit it's true yes and i'll tell you i say it like this it's confusing when you feel like you don't need nothing because the preaching of the gospel is telling us that we need but but the spirit that speaks from the world is telling world cain we don't need to try any harder than what we're doing that to me he's he's confusing just like what what saint did to ever god made it real clear nothing but the word you're not allowed to partake of that tree in any fashion form a way amen and satan confuse it oh yes you can you'll be just like god you'll make it nobody's perfect confusing that's why it's the most deceptive hour that's right we ought to be getting ready for the rapture amen we ought to be looking for the seed amen because that's the heart of god that's the mind of god let this mind that was in christ be in you and his mind is to get the family together well he didn't tell me he's not going to tell you you get on your knees and you want it he'll tell you i remember when god called me it wasn't until i wanted it yeah he may call you from sin you weren't looking for god but after you come to christ something inside of you wants to go tell somebody right automatically you feel in debt there is just no way in the world i can have this uh being saved and this joy and happiness and not go tell somebody but what happens to a period of time becomes all about us lose that joy lose that burden and it's until you realize that this is your purpose that you need to be getting out there it's not until that time that you begin to pray and say lord lay some soul upon my heart win that soul through me lord use me today it's at that point god will lay a burden on your heart and when he does all of a sudden the labor becomes so much easier because the joy the lord becomes your strength at that point we should be hungering to walk in more light today now more light isn't necessarily new light right it's just new to you walking in it may not be new to your knowledge it may be it's just new to your obedience you haven't been obedient to it before and that just casts out all darkness jesus said as long as i'm in the world i am the light of the world and brother branham said that there's no hope for this world jesus is gone from this world but is he in your word is he in your world have you given him preeminence have you been serious with what he spoke to you or have you quickly had presumptually said i don't need to do that we've got to follow the light of the word in order to continue to be the light of the world jesus said i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but but shall have the light of life so when we come to church we come to hear about the light that we need to walk in of course we have a choice at that point to follow that light for our lives now i can't make brother mark do it brother mark can't make me do it i hope he prays for me i pray for him but i can only choose to say no to the darkness and this flesh doesn't want to do it right so it ain't just easy choice making here you know let's play roulette you know what do you want black or red no this this is hard business i have to give up my will give up the things that are pleasing to my flesh but god is serious he's doing a short work there's no time to be playing church just you know getting by with a flowery bed of ease you know how many people are going to be left behind thinking they were okay they thought they were okay short work is being done but if you go your own way you're not following the light of the word so even though we can say oh yeah i follow jesus jesus is in his word and jesus is here whether we don't think he is or not whether we feel him see him that don't matter he's here he's hearing his word and when he gives you the word when you follow that word and you just say i'm going to do it amen you're walking in the light amen you can be in your prayer closet the same thing could be happening you'd be reading the bible listening to a tape but somewhere through the midst of that god's going to be speaking you could be watching something on tv and god's saying no right it's true amen it's up to us to walk in the light turn with me the 1st john chapter 1 verse 5. john expresses the attitude that we should have when we come to church this then is the message of course we should have it for our life which we've heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is just a little bit of darkness but why is it okay for us to have a little bit of an attitude a little bit of i don't care a little bit it doesn't matter a little bit i'm just human you got to live with it why is that okay there's no darkness in the lord that's true with that being said we see the mind of god wanting to shine the light of his word down into every one of our lives in order to get everything out of us that's not pleasing to him because in him there's no darkness at all god works very hard getting the word to us now i'll tell you the beautiful thing we come to church and he makes us to lay down in green pastures you know we hear the word still waters he gets our attention he's trying to address us if we can learn to do this on a daily basis spend some time with him in prayer spend some time in his word just be subject to him don't have your mind already made up what you want to learn what you want to speak to you about what what what what just god i need to obey you speak to me amen verse six if we say then that we have fellowship with god and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth what's what's what do we say about this we all got darkness are we all liars we become a liar to the truth when we refuse to walk in the light that he speaks to us it's true and say that yeah i'm a christian right i believe i'm in the message god is calling us liar it doesn't matter if your brother and sister calls you a liar that doesn't matter the word calls you a liar right amen there's a strong meat here but any darkness at all any darkness at all that's why we need the fear and trembling that's why we need to be serious of the short work that god's doing that's why we need to lord what is it that you would have me to do in this short time i only got a short time to get ready instead i fulfilled my job i went to church rest of the day's mind the rest of the week's mine where are we at brother sister yes we're in the message but it's evident where the message is in us amen how many people do we know that claim that they have fellowship with christ even though they refuse to walk in further light for their lives how many times we tried telling people about things and they don't want to receive it yet they oh i claim the light i walk with jesus see because they view jesus as someone where you don't have to walk in all the light honestly they just review god as someone that you don't need all the light like god understands god understands we're frail we're human but he doesn't he doesn't not he does not understand a lackadaisical lukewarm attitude that it doesn't matter he will never accept that verse 7 says it but if we walk in the light as he shows us the light that's right we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ can do its job and cleanse us from all sin amen brother breton made a statement he he he read one scripture he said this one verse here he said has enough to save your soul but also has enough to put you in hell it's a choice and every time we come to church i believe god is dealing with us with getting more of the darkness out amen that's right and that's what we should be focused on lord show me what you want me to do that's why we're ministering every even though man shall live by every word of god god may only be dealing with you with one certain thing it may not be the thing you were thinking about all week it may be something that he's preparing you for two weeks from now because the seed has to be planted right you got to water it you got to say yes lord be it unto me and then let it come to pass it's not always how we got it figured out this this scripture this verse 7 here has really challenged me scared me that if i don't walk in the light i can't even be cleansed by the blood that's powerful i've got to walk in the light not just oh yeah i got baptized i'm in the light i cut my hair it used to be long i'm in the like no the new light that he gives me the one the secret things that only you and him know the pastor don't know pastor don't want to know the thing that the ministers don't know it's an intimate relationship between you and god god wants it out amen get the darkness out yes and that's why you have to pay attention to what god's speaking to your heart and if we all do that if we all do that and we all say yes lord we will walk out of here cleansed by the blood walking in a greater light than we had when we first came here have more joy than when we came but we've got to function the way the church is supposed to function it's not a knowledge house it's not some place where we come and get more knowledge verse 8 if we say that we have no sin that means no darkness inside of us at all we deceive ourself and the truth is not even in us but if we confess our sins he is faithful just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness so when the gospel is preached to us the light of the word is preached to us if we say amen to the word so be it lord change my ways forgive me of not walking in this prayer right now that means god will cleanse us of our sin as if we never done it and our new works people are going to see somebody's going to see it and they're going to glorify the god that spoke to you what to do that's awesome amen verse 10 if we say that we have not sinned we make god a liar and his word is not even in us now each one of us must separate from all of our darkness i don't know all yours you don't know all mine but you could all have all darkness out if i don't get mine out i'm not going it's my job to encourage you what god is really really trying to do in this short hour that we're living in but i still got to take care of mine you got to take care of yours we got to come together as a family walk in the light as he is in the light amen ephesians chapter 5 verse 21 boy is it okay if you bear with me a little bit now that we're only having one service on sundays you know ephesians chapter 5 verse 21 this is a real blessing submit yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves onto your own husband as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be unto their own husbands and everything now as we're reading this paul and this is the mature church right the book of ephesians this is maturity this is for the elect he's not only talking about the natural husband and wife but he's talking about us the church in our bridegroom that that we have to be subject to christ that's the point i don't want to really speak anything on natural relationships yet because this is this is just so rich here husbands love your wife as christ also loved the church and gave himself so here it is christ gave himself for us and now we're supposed to be subject to him that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word the word cleanses us the word gets us presentable to him that that's why it's important god's word speaking to your heart there's nothing else that matters when you go to church that god speaks to you the revelation of his word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having any darkness in it not a spot not a wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish so men ought to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourish it and cherish it even as the lord the church just think about that every time god every time you come to church god is here to give you his word he's always given up he's never left us without his word in other words he's never left us without an answer for our current problems god is not going to speak the answer to your life in another church that would make god a god of confusion and we would be going we would be going from pillar to pulse looking for something right yeah that's right no god is not like that that's why we say here or there go not right you either believe god's with you or you don't amen all right for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones for his cause shall we the the people who were born in the flesh leave the carnal nature of our father and our mother and be joined to his wife and they the two shall be one flesh now he says this is a great mystery but i speak considering christ and the church so we left not only the denominations but we left the nature of darkness we left i'm going to do my own thing right and we're going to be joined unto christ in the marriage of his word this is how important it is to get married to the word amen not just the message of william brown not just the church of send the light not just a non-denominational church but we're being married to the word the word cleanses us the word washes us the word directs us is a light to our path it's the word word word that cast out all darkness that shines the light in our lives our personal lives and shows us what's going on all right no doubt my mind god speaking individually to every one of our hearts something that's going on there without it being mentioned from the prophet but he takes the word and he goes through the filter and says this is how it's applied to you and that's where that fear and trem i gotta walk out here and take care of it that's right i gotta work on this lord help us he wants us to come out of darkness ephesians chapter 4 verse 7. so separation here this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye hencefor walk not as other gentiles walk how do they walk in the vanity of their own mind vanity vein vein vein pain this is what i got going on vain having the understanding darkened see there's darkness there being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that's in them because of the blindness of their heart right so brother brandon said mission work is always in the world lord all things work together for the good to them that love the lord according to his purpose god is getting his family together god is interested in souls but where are we at in the manifestation of that where are we at how much time will we give god we got 24 hours a day i know we got to work i know we got to eat no we got to sleep beauty rest important what are we doing with the extra time are we walking as other gentiles walk it's not about why not talking about what church we go to it's about a walk are we walking in the vanity of our mind are we walking with the mind of christ the mind of christ is winning souls it's not for everybody else it's for you will you hear that call amen who being past feeling that means don't really care about somebody else's soul and have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with what greediness i want i want i want i want what do i want so i can have need of nothing what a squirrel cage but you have not so learned christ thank god for the truth people have literally fell so in love with themselves that they have missed caring about somebody else's soul they just don't got time anymore i mean it's a busyness it's just going and going i i i think the whole world is going to surpass new york in busyness god wants us to separate from everything that's in this world second corinthians chapter 6 verse 14 be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship have righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion have what light with darkness where the light of the world now and what concord have christ with baal what part of a believer with an infidel right he's trying to get us not to be connected with unbelief he's always trying god is always trying to separate the darkness out of our life and i think we ought to praise them for that not not feel bad and well i wish i wouldn't have to do that and that's just not what i want to hear verse 16 and what agreement have the temple of god with idols we probably all pack a few of those don't we awful quiet for ye are the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people but what do we have to do come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the darkness the unclean thing and i will receive you you can see if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have fellowship with one another in christ and the blood cleanses us i want god to receive more of me i will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and my daughters saith the lord almighty god is looking for us to make the first move amen to come out he's give you come to church you hear the word something speaks to you down here you make the first choice i'll come out amen and then we receive a much tighter relationship with christ [Music] the holy ghost said separate me barnabas and saul for the work unto i have called them now that's what the scripture says god is calling us to separate for a work for him amen there's a reason god gives us light amen it's not for ourselves i'm sorry it's not just for your home put it in the house top shine it wherever you go people need to see your works they need to see that god is alive today ephesians chapter one we're winding down ephesians chapter five i'm sorry verse one ephesians chapter five verse one be therefore followers of god is dear children and walk in love as christ also have loved us and given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for his sweet smelling savor isn't that beautiful all right let verse six let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things the wrath of god cometh on what the children who refuse to walk in the light the children who refuse to walk in the light be not ye therefore partakers with them so there are going to be some that say you know what i don't need it don't be partakers with them make a choice where you're going to stand for ye were sometimes darkness but now are you children but i'm sorry but now are ye light in the lord walk as children of light it's a choice that we make i got a a quote here i wanted to read brother branham said in buzz uh in in talking about david henry's prophecy it's not showing where it's at right now but he spoke about a few different places he says because thou has chosen the narrow path the heart away that was walked to thine own choosing that was pick the correct and precise decision and this is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits you not because your bride not because you're the messenger but because you chose to walk in the light of the word what a glorious decision thou has made this is that which will give and may come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine amen the pinnacle is love that's right it is right we all agree in love and i'll tell you i want to be loved by brother mark i don't want to be hit by the mark i don't want to be talked behind my back but that's not the victory that god wants to give us god wants to give us a victory that no matter if i get hit if i get talked behind my back i can where are we in that journey today because he's doing a short work he's not waiting around for us to say you know what i think i'd like to try that let's continue reading for ye were sometimes darkness but now you're light in the lord walk as children of light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto the lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them do something about it for it is a shame to even speak of those things which are done in secret but all those things but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever does make manifest is light and i'm so grateful honestly to this day i don't care what sin i've done i'm so grateful for the light that has helped me to get out amen if it wasn't for the light of the truth of the gospel i would still be in it right and today i feel in debt to god amen wherefore he saith awake you that sleep god's doing or quit work and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light amen see then that you walk circumspectly diligently completely perfectly not as fools but as wise amen redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is god is doing a short work we only got a little time to get ready and we only got a little time to win as many souls as possible were you going to be on that day when god asked for to give you ask for you an account how did you use your time amen did you walk as are the gentiles did you compare yourself with other believers in the message well i was better than them well look i don't care how good or how bad they are what i do care about is what god's called you to be god's calling you to walk circumspectly to redeem the time the days are short we need to walk in the light of the 22nd century god's given us a greater light today than last century we need to walk in the light as god reveals the light to us when we come to church we just say amen so be it and really mean it from our heart we don't want a plastic amen well i just say amen but not really mean it but that you're connected in the spirit of the word amen amen for ye were sometimes in darkness but now are ye the light of the lord walk as children of light and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them amen brother branham said the world glitters but the gospel glows man-made love is just a glitter just get your attention for a moment but love the love of god the real love of god in a human will be there when there's nobody looking that's true you i'll tell you today do you have to worry about what god says behind your back we know the thoughts he thinks towards us that's right and when we're filled and sealed with the love of god nobody has to wonder what we're going to say about them because god is the same yesterday today and forever romans chapter 13 verse 10 we're coming down to a close can you say amen to that all right i got you on recording on that one romans chapter 13 verse 10 love worketh no ill to his neighbor now we're talking about walking circumspectly therefore love is the fulfilling of the law and that knowing the time that now is high time to wake out of our sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we first believed the night is first met the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light notice god has given us grace to do this he's given us time i'm so thankful for that so thankful for that let us walk honestly as in the day not rhyming and drunk it does nothing chambered in wantingness not in his strife and envy but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision shelter comfort hide behind god's word for your flesh to fulfill the lust thereof you know you can become so religious that you use the word for you right it's true which one he didn't give jesus the desire you gotta run out prayer till you say not my will but thy will be done we need to awake out of our sleep arise from laodicea all right verse 15. see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is what is the will of the lord for your life today in the 22nd century god is wanting us to walk in the light of his word to walk with purpose when you see when you walk into a store and you see somebody that has a tag on you know they work at the store and they're just like yeah yeah hey joe what's going on just no purpose you see somebody got a name today they're walking around their shares about they're going or they're doing this they're going to their next job god is doing a short work satan knows he's only got a short time well what are we doing all right are we serious about getting ready are we serious about getting a soul in or have we had enough of church for today where's your heart i see your words i hear your words but where's your heart will you let god take it today will you let him take control and have the preeminence in you he wants to do something in every one of us but we have to literally i know we've subjected ourselves to sit here in church that's beautiful and that's wonderful and i i'm thankful to god for that but we got to give god her heart amen we've got to let him take us from when we leave here to start working on the things that he wants whatever it is you don't need to tell me you don't need to tell your brother you don't need to tell your sister no but you do need to do it with god amen amen i just i got one thing i wanted to show you if ann could show that i just don't have time to go over everything there's one more quote brother brian says whatever you do lay aside everything else till you get perfect love now we're running out of time amen there's a short work and we've got to get perfect love get to where you can love everybody even your enemy no matter if the plane is crashing or rocking the light is lightning is flashing or the guns of the enemy are upon you so these things do not matter i don't care what they do say i don't care about your enemy amen you shouldn't care about your enemy your focus should be to get perfect love to be able to love them that's shooting the guns that literally would put a knife in your back if they knew they could get away with it get to a place like able amen his blood spake spoke afterwards we're we're god's sheep it only matters that we get perfect love and we're running out of time let's stay in together we're running out of time god bless you for your patience god bless you for your patience may god give you grace to press in amen half of us can't make it without perfect love we can't we can't it's not true it's not a it doesn't matter you're still going in now that's what satan wants us to believe but we got to get there how do i know when how close i am watch how you react in your heart the next time you hear something negative that'll let you know how close you are and it's at that moment you say
