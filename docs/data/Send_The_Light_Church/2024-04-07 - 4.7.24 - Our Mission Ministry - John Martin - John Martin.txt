in this late hour in Jesus name we ask it amen you may be seated amen we have a testimony um brother Jonathan you want to give that so uh many of you know know that last Wednesday um while we were in service praying um I got a text um that my aunt Cheryl was uh had already passed away and been revived and she was asking for any and all family that wanted to see her to um come to Florida so me and my sisters jumped on a plane and went to to Florida the good news is many of you know that 14 days prior she accepted Jesus as her Lord and savior first aspect of the testimony is they kept asking her if she wanted morphine and what not to deal with the pain um her spine was disintegrated in literally a month her her spine crumbled and and disintegrated um she said no I'm fine and she was literally up until the minutes before she passed away she was joking and my aunt and other people said that can only be God literally she the pain that anybody else would be going through with their organs shutting down and their bones crumbling inside of them would be in such excruciating pain and she just kept telling the nurses and doctors no I'm fine and uh so the peace that was with her and uh you know another testimony my Uncle Ronnie's still not there so keep praying for for his soul but um he did say the day before she passed if you all remember last year my other aunt got cured of the same cancer that is uncurable there is no cure for this cancer and uh she was taking some medications and lots of prayer and uh well got healed her and my uncle Ronnie said somebody said something about the medication he doesn't believe in that and he said well it was the prayer and he just walked away for him to say that there's God's doing something and I just pray that he uh would get through the uh my uncle's mind and all the knowledge he had that would you know make God you know something else that he's you know isn't or whatever to him so I just pray that you know he gets there but the other testimony is on Friday um my wife came home with the kids and there was an eviction notice on our front door my wife called and was like what did we do wrong oh you did nothing wrong the park is just selling all the homes so no Renning great well if anybody knows the market around here it's really hard to find a rental really hard um 12 hours later God LED my wife to a um house called and all

just Lord forgive me and the Bible says that he's faithful and just to forgive us if we just confess it to him my we serve a really good God Amen i' just like you to be seated just for a second we want to show you some pictures um we have brother Boaz coming from India and he'll be with us in May 5th if you want to write that down all the way from India to be with us we appreciate that and uh brother Gideon he's another missionary that we support in Nigeria West Africa and um we wanted to show some pictures here now during this time of Easter many people come off the mountains and come down to his area and uh yeah you could just keep these going so what he'll do is he'll take advantage of all the people and he'll just start preaching and then people will start Gathering and he'll start telling about the gospel and it's a it's a a a wonderful opportunity these are ones that have accepted this is his wife um uh but uh many had uh accepted Jesus Christ and he handed out uh Bibles to them them um he had an interpreter there I told him when he listened to the video I said you need to give your interpreter one of those things so they can hear because you could only hear Brother Gideon preach and you couldn't hear the the one that was in the other language so here he had the police department come down they received Bibles and messages they all received them isn't that beautiful to have them on your side amen we appreciate brother Gideon he does sends his greetings to you this morning and appreciat your prayers for him and the work that they do there in the different countries especially locally there in Nigeria amen well I know that was a short set but we got to stand for the reading of the word today we want to welcome our visitors uh Ralph with us God bless you thank you for for coming and being with us and our sister Sharon White Shannon Shannon White thank you thank you God bless you thank you for coming and it's it's you always have to have that that courageousness when you come and uh visit a church because you really don't know what you're getting into and my prayer is that you just feel relaxed and that uh allow the Lord to to minister you know the one thing about God he he doesn't make every tree the same every flower the same every Minister the same he doesn't even speak the same but he does have a voice and he knows how to speak to his children amen but turn with me if you would to the book of 2 Corinthians uh chapter 5 2 Corinthians chapter 5 you have your Bibles amen I'm grateful for you that have your Bibles amen uh brother Dennis we have something for you so don't leave before we talk to you today after service you kind of sneak out sometimes and amen before we begin reading let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer dear father we come to you with Thanksgiving in our heart Lord so grateful that you've washed our sins away that you've taken him from the far as the east as from the West that you can't even remember oh I don't know how Lord you have that great power to not remember our sins but when they go through that precious blood they they're not even remembered in your mind and we are so grateful for that today amen we thank you for your mercy that rewrote our life we thank you for your love and your grace and Lord we thank you for giving given us your word today you watched over it through all the ages you protected it and and and and through this word we can know you Lord we can know who you really really are by this word so we want to thank you today for your word Lord we want to thank you

pray that you remember our sister Linda Lord we just ask that you would Supply every need heavenly father and break the bread of life to us today Lord may you speak to us through Thy word may you reveal it to us and may you draw us closer to you let us leave here closer to you than when we came we'll be careful to give you honor praise Thanksgiving for these things for we humbly ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen 2 Corinthians chapter 5 starting with verse number nine wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him so the way to be accepted is we have to labor if we don't labor we can't be accepted for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive of the things done in his body according to have uh according to that he have done whether it be good or bad and it's always good to labor for the Lord amen knowing therefore the terror the seriousness of the lord we persuade men or or we convince men but we are made manifest unto God and I trust also are made manifest in your conscience vers I want to drop down to verse 14 save it a little bit for the love of Christ now it constrains us it constrains us to persuade men because we thus judge that if Christ died for all then we're all dead and that Christ died for all then they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves anymore but unto him that died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh ye though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more in other words we don't know Christ through intellect through understanding through knowledge we don't know Christ like we would learn about a spaceship in a textbook or an encyclopedia we know Christ by revelation amen therefore If any man be in Christ he is a completely new creature or New Creation old things are passed away behold all things are become new and not only is it one frying pan to the next it's all things are of God so this new is just one thing it's God who have reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and given to us the ministry of reconciliation to it or after the manner that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself not imputing their trespasses upon them and he has committed unto us the word of reconciliation to do the same thing now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ dead be ye reconciled to God amen amen God bless you you may be seated want to entitle this today our Mission Ministry and our Mission Ministry is really to reconcile others amen and and it's not given by the church it's been given by God almighty this is a commission that's that has been given by God to each of us and for a subject today we'd like to talk about our responsibility in reconciling others it is a responsibility if we become new creatures in Christ then God has automatically given us the ministry of reconciliation so it is important for us that that we labor to reconcile others because um if we're going to be accepted of him we've got to take on the responsibility that he's given us because we're all going to appear before joh we're all going to have to give an account to God what we did with our time are you with me true all right so if we heard a few more amen say it won't hurt me I just want you to know it'll be completely okay am brother B says we must accept our responsibility Jesus said go out and just putting in a nutshell go you out and save Souls am that's what he told us to do brother brand said our missionary work is always in the will of God it's you no matter what you're doing for this Ministry in however you're doing it if it's to reconcile another Soul it is always you're always in the will of God and it is really the only thing that we can have confidence in yes and and the result of that is heaven rejoices amen with just one soul that comes to this is the most important thing that we can do on planet Earth now there are two ways that we can view our responsibility in missionary work and number one is give some some money into the missionary box and and it'll go towards missionaries overseas and that's all I'm going to say that because I don't want to talk about that today I want to talk about our responsibility in leaving the church today and helping others come to know Jesus Christ personally amen because that is such a great responsibility now I'm going to be asking a lot of questions and the reason I'm going to be asking these questions is because I want to prompt your thinking I want you to think about these things because the devil works very hard at deceiving people amen and the word is given to us as a as a light for our feet a lamp for our path right yes and so I'm so glad that we have the word of God today now how do people become reconciled to God if we're supposed to go out through and reconcile how do people become reconciled to God is it by putting their name on a church registry how about repeating the Apostles Creed how about burning so many candles how about saying we believe how about getting baptized how about saying you're born again how about attending a church how about giving offerings no no no no no but amazing how many people have settled for these things in thinking that they have been be reconciled to God there's only one way a man can be reconciled to God and that is through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ it is the only way amen Jesus is the way the truth and the life amen the Oxford Dictionary's definition of reconcile is to restore friendly relationships between so now God has given us this responsibility to restore friendly relationships between God and the human being that is that's an awesome responsibility now under normal circumstances let's just say these two boys were fighting right here well I would probably want to step in find out what's going on and see if we could get a compromise right settle things down try to get a compromise but when it comes to restoring a human being a soul to God God does not compromise with man that's right there's no compromising with with man I mean with God but what we do have to do is we have to persuade or convince others that God's word God's way is the only way to get reconciled to God a very difficult it's a very difficult thing to do and I believe that's why we have to get the Holy Ghost amen we do we have to become new creatures God has to take over so he can work through our lives amen so how do people become reconciled to God I got some questions here can I really get saved from Hell without being reconciled to God can I get saved without entering the straight and narrow gate no can I get saved without having to do God's will or without picking up my cross can I get saved by believing in God the way I want to believe in God can I just confess Jesus is my Lord and Savior make it no wow see these are these are some hard questions I believe but how often people who walk away from the fullness of the word and take some of these things so they can feel Justified and that they're still going to make it now if reconciliation is restoring a relationship then there are two sides of reconciliation one is the side that of of God which he so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son he shed his blood that the middle the partition that stood between man and God could be taken out of the way and the blood there is our atonement and now we can freely come boldly to God Amen but we cannot come to him with unconfessed sinsen we just can't we have to confess them we have we just have to get it out there and and and and and God's blood is there why you know Calvary was there to cover our sins so if we just confess them he can cover them and then we have that fellowship with him that Union with him now the Bible says that he died for the whole world unfortunately the whole world did not accept him does not accept him there's enough Grace out there to save the whole world but people do not accept his grace now the other side of reconciliation is for man to accept the pardon to accept his grace question can I accept his pardon which is totally separated from any works that I could do or is there something I need to do is there something I need to do because if there was nothing that I needed to do then the whole world would be free right so there is something that needs to be done you must believe in God according to the scriptures you cannot believe God the way that you think the way you feel the way it it seems the way even the way you've been taught by mom or dad or I'll say the way that you've been taught by a church because that church may have been a man-made Church it may have been man uh conception we've got to believe Christ according to the scriptures amen amen amen now can I just believe and get baptized to get my salvation well I'm going to say this yes and no I'm I'm going to give you the scriptures for yes Mark 16:16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned Romans 10: 9-13 that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God have raised him from the dead thou shall be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed amen for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord overall is Rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved amen now I I love this because this is showing me the Simplicity of how to get connected with God how to start and this process of being reconciled and how to get reconciled but understand there's there's a huge difference between believing in God the way the scriptures say and believing in God the way I want to believe everybody has their own interpretation as it were or their own belief system and this is what scar because these scriptures are meant exactly one way it is is not meant hundreds of thousands of different ways for different people it's it's just one way now James 2 verse 19 tells us that thou believest that there's one God thou doest well the Devils also believe and tremble so they have a belief system and they believe in God they I'll say I'll say the those Devils believe more in God than a lot of eight people atheists out there there's a lot of people out there that they don't even and you know the god that they do know isn't the real God so the Devils know who the real God is it's the truth they had a account a not a a in they had a little encounter that's what I'm looking for in in MA in Matthew chapter 8: 29 behold they CED these demons cried out saying what have we to do with thee Jesus thou Son of God Art Thou come hither to torment us before the time so here they are they're believers they confess with their mouth the Lord Jesus but they're not saved so it's not as easy as just saying you believe and confessing with your mouth there's more to it than that because you got to confess with your life any person that confesses with their mouth but their life does not display it it is evil it is wrong it is a wrong confession the confession has to be with your life your heart are you with me amen all right Jesus said by their fruit you shall know them all right this is the scripture I want you to write down it's John 5:39 the scripture says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they which testify of me every person should care enough about their salvation to search out their scriptures to see where they're standing to make sure that they're believing the right way I don't want to be part of that group where many come and and miss it because they had a false sense of security amen 1 John chapter 5 verse 13 says talking about the scriptures these things have I written unto you that believe on my name believe on the name of the son of God that ye may know that you have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of God so the word is written to where we can know there's no guesswork I have met God's requirements and the scriptures are the only thing that can properly identify our Salvation second Timothy chapter 3:1 15 2 Timothy chapter 3:15 and just just I believe that this is this is um God is here God is here in this message here we we um those of us that are rock solid saved we we've met God's requirement uh I believe this is a good message to help us to know how to reconcile others and and those that are looking for the way I believe these These are good scriptures here all right 2 Timothy 3:15 and that from a child thou has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus I'd rather have I'd rather have this book I don't mean it wrong I'd rather have this book and never enter a church I mean I'm thankful for a fivefold Ministry it's for my perfecting and we need it but there are the devil uses preachers of all kinds to confuse people and to get them off the get them on off off the on the wrong track amen get them off the right track on the wrong track but the scriptures will make us wise unto salvation amen the Bible says all scripture is given by the inspiration of God and it is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction how many wants correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works well these good works is we need to help reconcile others to Christ amen Jesus said in John 14:12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works I do shall he do also now that's a little bit different than what we're reading there in Romans isn't it the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to my father true sincere belief is associated with the very works of Jesus Christ but we can believe on Jesus Christ and not have those works but we're not believing properly we're not believing completely because GE we've got to search the scriptures because they are they are they which testify of who Jesus Christ is so can I really get saved from Hell without being reconciled to God I mean he died for me I I accept what he did at Calvary isn't that good enough the answer is simply no we must get reconciled to God just like everyone else who got saved Jesus said you must be born again there must come forth uh a an Evidence in our life a new creature that that all things now are are like Jesus we're we're no longer the same person and that I'll say it like this because you know trees take time to grow flowers things take time to grow we as Christians it takes time to grow now what's growing is not just the knowledge about the Bible but it's the character of Jesus Christ in our lives and that needs that's the evidence of where we're standing with God Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them now when you look up in the Greek this word reconcile it means to change mutually mutually it's got to go through free more agency both parties have to be in agreement with it that's why the majority of the world goes to hell because they are not mutually agreeing with the word they're going to climb up some other way they're going to go the Broadway a and and they're being deceived by the devil but thank God that there's a truth the ministry of reconciliation or the word of reconciliation means to exchange something in order to bring about a restoration to a soul so we were all born in sin shapen in iniquity and uh most the devil wants us to believe that alls we have to do is accept what Jesus did 2,000 years ago and we don't have to change that is basically the conception that the devil has it's called religion God gave up his life for us and we've got to give up our life for God anything short of that is short of Salvation now that's why there's going to be what's called the great white Throne judgment after that things are going to be settled but I'm so glad God gave me his word that I may know that I have eternal life I don't have to wait till the day of judgment I can have boldness the Bible says because as he is so are we in this world so can I get my soul saved without giving up anything how about this one can I be saved without my very nature changing so what is salvation is it just being saved from hell I believe salvation is when we are saved from the nature of a self-willed selfish self-centered live for myself it's all about me to where all things are about God now in my life so it's not like I'm I'm saved from a a a a a fire a a place that burn with fire and brimstone which is true that's his hell but understand hell was created for the devil and his angels it wasn't created for us that's right but if my nature continues I mean I can I can get baptized and and re go to church but if I still have that selfish nature inside of me I'm still Hellbound right amen and I know it's not a very popular Ministry or a popular preaching or something but you know what how many people do you think on the day of judgment are going to stand and look at their preacher that preached to them all those years and said I thought all I had to do was this preacher I thought all I had to do was this and you you would take care of everything there's going to be a lot Jesus said the blind lead the blind they both fall in the ditch every day we should wake up and thank God for the revelation of the word I believe that salvation is when we've been reconciled to the will of God reconciled to the will of God we're no longer fighting oh I got to do the will of God no we've accepted it for our life it becomes our life you've been born again by the word of God by the will of God to do the will of God that's what it means where All Things become of God we're no longer part of it therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things have become new and all things are of God Amen turn with me if you would to Matthew 28 when we're sharing with others Christ I believe we ought to be sharing with them the original Plan of Salvation not our ideas about it and we're going to go through a couple of scriptures here so don't leave church until it's over want you to get the whole thing here Matthew 2018 and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost and we know that the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ we know that teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even unto the end of the world so now he has given us a responsibility here our ministry ought to be to go out and teach the true Plan of Salvation to baptize them correctly and don't stop there he says this Grand statement that ought to put the fear of God in every one of us he says teach them to observe all things that Jesus commanded us wow you mean I I just don't got to just just you know lead them to to just to repent and get baptized and then and then stop and no no because we're trying to lead them to a new birth am hey re repentance and baptism isn't going to guarantee the new birth because a lot of times uh people don't understand what they're repenting of so we've got to help them we've got to help them now can I cast out Devils prophesy speak in tongues and do many wonderful works and still not know Christ that's scripture so any man that's in Christ he's a new creature he knows Christ so it's not by doing these things it's it's by living the same life that Christ lives because I can do these things and live like a devil true many will come to me in that day many are not observing all the things that Christ has commanded them you talk to people are you a Christian are you born again yeah I'm born again yeah I'm a Christian yeah I got baptized and it stops there there's no other evidence they got excuse for everything else else going on in their life but we have the responsibility as ambassadors of Jesus Christ to to teach them to observe all things that the Bible says and no they ain't going to want to hear it it's just be honest they they want they what they want to hear is you're doing a good job keep at it yet you don't have to do nothing else and that's scary I don't want to I'm lying to God I'm lying to them if I tell them the truth look the Bible says if how can you be a servant to God when you're serving man how can you please God when you're pleasing man it's not about friendship down here friends it's about getting people to Jesus Christ it is the most important thing we can do so we ought to teach others to observe all things that Jesus commanded to repent to get baptized to love others like Jesus loved us to lay down teach them to lay down their life as Jesus laid down his life for them the Bible says if you love me keep my commandments so we need to teach them to observe that to stay connected in the vine to keep bearing fruit now these are just things in the scriptures that we should be helping others to observe is that are you with me all right brother Ben said in the Mage questions and answers he says some of you oldtimers here let me ask you something you oldtimers that's been in the Tabernacle watch when I baptize people and you ministers take this for an example kind of let you know where I'm coming at here today he says I've taught those those people till they had their life cleaned up before they went into that water and then I had them believing that God was obligated to keep his promise as soon as they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit was right there to receive them amen and when they come up out of the water they receive the Holy Ghost he said that's right why you reading that brother John I'm reading that because of this next words right here he said Shepherds teach your sheep get them in the Bible here get away from that Old textbook of some church and get down here in the Bible where God taught and you won't have those troubles see if you don't lead somebody to Christ all the way you're just going to have a bunch of troubles you've got to lead people to Christ they've got to have a personal relationship to where they trust God for their life they trust God for their trials they trust God for what they're going through because everybody is going to go through test and trials and we got to hang on to God we can't hang on to one another we hang on to God he's the one that will save us through it all there's only one true baptism but there are many false ones Ephesians 4:5 said there's one Lord one faith and one baptism if someone has been baptized incorrectly it is our responsibility to teach them the correct way to be baptized a good example of that is Acts chapter 19 if you want to write it down and read that if someone needs to be baptized God is given us the word of reconciliation how to get them restored to God that's an awesome responsibility to care about somebody's soul and get them to Jesus Christ we know the right way all right Acts chapter 2: 36 are you getting something out of this am all right praise the lord it's okay to be quiet if you're getting something out of it all right Acts chapter 2:3 this is when the Holy Ghost came down they were waiting in the upper room therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly no question no doubt about it that God have made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both lord of the Old Testament and the Holy Ghost the anointed Messiah amen that same son Jesus both Lord Jehovah and Holy Ghost and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said Peter unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do how do how do we going to get saved how do we get saved and then Peter having the keys Jesus gave him the keys there in Matthew 3 16 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that is such a precious promise for the promise is not only to you but unto your children and unto all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and with many other words did he testify and them saying save yourself got to go through a few more agency save yourself from this entour generation well if that was an ENT generation then imagine what it is right now it is the worst that's ever been and it ain't getting any better and we've got to save ourselves say Amen we've got to jump in the pool we've got to come to Christ we got to get the Holy Ghost nothing short of it will work then they that gladly received the word see there's this joint working together amen they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 Souls wow that's a lot that's beautiful glory to God glory to God so what are we repenting from what are we repenting from some think it's saying sorry to the Lord for the wrong things they've done in the past like Lord I'm in a pickle I need a savior please save me I accept you as my savior and this is the concept of repentance and I I know this is such an elementary subject but we've got to get down to it we're really repenting from our old sinful lustful nature we're repenting from living our life according to our will and repentance means turn around 180° to think different and start living for God Amen that's what repentance is and that's the first step to getting saved and it is the most crucial step because if you only turn around 10 degrees if you're only sorry for your past sins but you still want to live life for yourself that's not true repentance that's why many people go back out in the world so when men and women accept Christ as their lord and savior they're accepting the will of God for their lives you take a totally different way of thinking Romans 122 we don't have time to read it we're going to have to scoot Philippians Philippians chapter 2:5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus Jesus said you must be born again this is what it means you're when you're born by the will of God you're Bor born to do his will you're not just you know when I first came to the Lord I did not understand what it meant to be born again I'll be honest with you you must be born again okay what does that mean you mean Jesus has to will me to be born okay Jesus Will me to be born here I am I I just I couldn't I didn't have the concept of what it means but when you're born by the will of God look it there ain't no parent here that would ever have a child that would want to have a child that would not listen to them not a parent here everyone that's had a child wants that child to obey them can you imagine from the year two years old till they're out of the house nothing but hell and don't want to listen to you God does not want anybody in heaven that ain't going to listen to him we're we're born to serve the Lord to obey his word brother Ron you sang that song trust and Obey that's what it means to be born again and there's a process of this you we be become Justified Sanctified and then filled with the Holy Ghost Brandon said in a message time tested Memorials of God and my daughter had this uh hang up on her her wall and I often think of it says when you come to Christ if you can't absolutely sell out Lock Stock and Barrel and come to Christ he said don't come at all if you can't turn around completely and give your life to Jesus Christ don't come because God's looking for all of our heart amen that's it if we seek to save our life we'll lose it so after true repentance comes water baptism if a person doesn't mean business with God then if he's just trying to escape hell shall we say but if he doesn't he's not real serious with doing God's will he's just going to go down into the water a wet sinner and come up a wet sinner you see there has to be a change the Bible tells us that 1 Peter 3:21 if you want to write it down water baptism does not put away the filth of the Flesh in other words it doesn't change our vile nature it doesn't regenerate our soul water baptism is only an expression outwardly that we have taken the will of God in our life amen the Bible says it's an answer of a good conscience towards God in other words water baptism does not regenerate our nature it doesn't re it doesn't produce a new birth it's an outward expression that the blood has regenerated your soul through faith in the word that something is happening inside of you Romans 6:3 says know ye not that as many as were baptized into Jesus were baptized to his death therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death that like as Jesus was raised from the dead by the glory of the father even so we should walk in newness of life we come out of that water we're ready to start moving forward All Things become new all things uh are of God and you know it never stops this is the exciting thing about serving God from your heart it's always fresh it never stops you're always growing in Christ Jesus it's beautiful brother brandham said in the message questions and answers he said there'll be thousands there that were that have been baptized in jesus' name like this you'll go down a dry Center and you'll come up a wet one he says but as as the genuine True Believer you must walk in all faith and good conscience towards God when you see it if you've been baptized but I believe that if only it's only an outward expression showing that an inward work of Grace has been done now you know people want to get baptized for various reasons we don't want to ever discourage anybody from being baptized yet at the same time we should if we're involved in wanting somebody to get baptized we should care we should really care about where they set out to be after they're baptized we just should and a good example of this is in Luke 3:7 and and this is where they came to John they wanted to get baptized then said he to the multitude that came for to get baptized of him he says oh Generation of Vipers who has warned you to flee from the raft to come so they came to John they wanted to get baptized because they knew they needed to get baptized and he said bring forth fruit meat I'm sorry bring forth fruits worthy of repentance in other words you just can't say I'm sorry yes and they wanted to get baptized they wanted they knew that there was Wrath was coming right I'll talk to you after service I will on this think I was I I will say that these are human beings Pharisee sadducee whoever and yeah Pharisee just means actor it just means an actor but yet there was something inside that they knew wrath was coming and they needed to get baptized so inside of them there was a signal going on that we need to do something and I think it's no different than some people that live today they know they need to get baptized but do they really want to give their heart to Jesus Christ do they really want to follow the straight and narrow path and he says bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have Abraham as our Father for I say unto you that God is able these stones to raise up children to AB unto Abraham and now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees every tree uh therefore which bringeth not good fruit it's going to be cast chopped down and cast into the fire if a man wants to be reconciled to God he must repent first from doing his will and start doing God's will re repent from disbelieving the word and and disobeying the word repent for that and then you're making a decision I want to get baptized and I want to start obeying every every word of God because Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God do you believe that and get we need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I know some of these things they're subjects all on their own but uh Acts 4:12 says for there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved so how can I how can we get someone to Christ without getting them Rec to God we can't when we're leading somebody to Christ we have to lead them to the word we don't want to present Jesus Christ as as as someone that it doesn't matter what what life you're living God is very interested in our life in fact he's so interested in his life he wants to have preeminence in her life amen he wants to live inside of us and you know he won't even he won't live inside a dirty vessel he may come and bless you but he won't dwell there so there we we we we've got to clean up our lives we got to become Sanctified it's part of being reconciled to the Lord Jesus Christ so knowing there for the terror of the Lord now he's not a he doesn't push he's a gentleman he doesn't Force he doesn't make people do things he's a gentleman he cares he loves but yet he'll never compromise with his word amen so we've got to make sure that we're we're following the word every part of the word and the love of Christ if you're filled with the Holy Ghost how's got the Holy Ghost okay now there along with the Holy Ghost comes this ministry of reconciliation you just care about other other people so I know when I was in the world I didn't care about other people you know I was going to be a musician I was going to be a hockey player I was going to be a doctor that's what I was going to be when I was in the world and I told my wife I wasn't going to be a machinist and I didn't have any thoughts about being a preacher I don't know if for like 20 years after I was saved but you know what God had something else in mind something else in mind when you come to Christ and he fills you with his Spirit how can you have Christ and not care about other people's Souls right so I'll say just caring about somebody's soul is a great sign that that Ministry is trying to get activated inside of us and all we got to do is yield to it it's okay if you don't know for sure what to say or how to do it or you know the when Jesus talked to that woman at the well she just went into the City and said come see a man that told me all things you know she wasn't real gifted as it were in being a speaker but she led people to the word to where Jesus was that and the word if they're connected to the word the word will lead them further amen I just if we could just stand together just for a second have a a a h a little word of prayer and then my wife she has a a testimony I wanted her to share and I stoed uh about eight minutes of her time I apologize for that but um how many how many want to be an ambassador for Jesus Christ amen amen let's let's take this before the Lord our heavenly father Lord we thank you for the truth for you told those those that believed on you there in John 8 you said you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed Lord we want to continue in your word we want to be ambassadors in this Dark Age that we're living in this age that is so jam-packed with confusion no matter what's on the TV what's on the radio what's on the news who we're talking to just seems that there's so much going on Lord to distract us God I pray for every heart here those that are live streaming and those that are archiving Lord they have this desire in their heart to to be a great witness for you to be a greater Ambassador for you to help reconcile more souls to spend more time as it is your desire I pray that you would bless them give them the heart their heart's desire give them souls for their labor may they be able to share with many on the other side because you use them and we need the Holy Ghost in US Lord to do that may you give us a greater portion of your spirit we thank you for these things now we humbly pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you may be seated just for a little bit is it is it okay if we just take a little bit of time and do a testimony yeah this is is so edifying huh yeah shery told me now I know you can't do it just 45 minutes I tried so hard weeks ago month ago John asked me if I would share something about missions I wasn't really given any instructions so you just have to bear with me it's kind of like a teacher giving you an assignment without telling you how to do it so so I read this um this quote and it says um aspire to inspire before you expire and I thought that's my goal today is just to inspire you there's a work to be done for the Lord and to me missions is just sharing the love of God with somebody that's all it is and I wanted to share some of my experiences with missions and when we've been overseas just to make it more relatable to you you really can't you've seen the missionary report was amazing I was blown away all the videos and pictures and but when you actually go there and experience things it's um it's a whole different world and I will say that in my time serving the lord you know we learned to pay ties and offerings right off the bat but if you really want to touch the heart of God it's missions that is where God really is pleased with your life and um when when um you know some of these when we had the missionary the map up here you know it was just so incredible to me all that we are doing here this the support we are supporting so many missionaries across the globe and you know I just think some of those people have become really dear friends to us and the work that they're doing is just amazing and um you know he showed those pictures of brother Gideon this morning and he hasn't been here in a while he's uh had problem getting a Visa but when he was here he was just like we'd known him forever he was just so relatable and so you just sit and talk with him and he was terrified of our dog our dog weighs 96 lbs and he was terrified of her a lot of people in Africa are afraid of dogs by the time he left he was begging her to sit on his lap and two years ago when she almost died he was literally putting in prayer requests for her in his church and anybody that knows me knows how much I love my dog and I'll never forget that but we started doing missions many years ago we were young young and um we did a candy fundraiser we sold candy bars and I think we got 50 cents for every candy bar we sold they were dollar we got 50 cents and believe it or not we were actually able to build a church in Guyana with the money and it was like so encouraging to see how far the money goes overseas you know you couldn't build a church here for the money that we had but yes that's with the youth so I'm inspiring you guys okay so then we started in 1997 there was a hurricane in Honduras and it was a devastating hurricane it sent them back 50 years in time it was so so devastating and we started sending supplies down in semi trucks chaita banana would come up here full of bananas and the trucks were going back empty so they allowed us to send supplies down we gathered supplies from the community and it was quite an undertaking we had 3 hours to load the semi and otherwise we had to pay and and anyways um one time we just sent a whole load of beans just nothing but beans down and that has kind of got the wheels turning and then in 1999 John decided that we were going to do a golf outing and we knew nothing about doing a golf outing and so I fell um we had a storm it was a winter a summer storm and this is really bad idea but I couldn't find a flashlight and I needed to go downstairs in the old basement we have a new basement and an old basement and I had to go downstairs to turn the breaker on we had a generator but you had to flip Breakers to flip the different appliances so I went downstairs with a candle and it was a really terrible idea but I went downstairs I went into the old basement and there's two steps two concrete steps up and the breaker box is right on the top which is they like really poor planning but sorry honey yeah so anyways I'm holding this candle this glass candle and I turned to the breaker box I flipped on the freezers which were upstairs so I turned to hear if they came on and when I turned I lost my balance and I fell and all I could think about is I have to hold on to this candle cuz I don't want to burn the house down you know so I held onto the candle and I heard the bones crack when I fell I broke my ankle and my leg so then I had to crawl through the old basement the new basement up the stairs and my by the time I got to the top my ankle was like this and called Jen had to go and anyways three surgeries and two years later my ankle was repaired but that first golf outing was late in September this was in July so I literally cooked steaks on crutches Marty you didn't you weren't available yet so I literally was cooking the steaks for the golf outing while I was still on crutches that was the Lord when that happened immediately when it happened and I don't know if this happens to you but whenever anything happened I immediately Wonder did I do something wrong yeah did did I do something to you know the Lord was not pleased and I broke my leg and the Lord had spoken to me in a prophecy and told me that the reason it happened was the devil was mad about what we were doing for Missions and I thought why didn't he break John's leg why do I have to go through all this's IDE it was your idea so anyways so we went to the mission field for the first time in 2001 and I've heard people say oh it'll change your life it'll you know make you live different it doesn't I have found that it either reinforces a burden that you already have in your heart or when you come back you'll just go right back to life you know you forget the hardships over there and the first time we went I literally had no expectations nobody warned me you know it was John likeed to go to the most remote areas that exist on the planet and I mean I remember driving down there and my head hit the top of the truck so many times I asked if we could ride horses the next time you know it was so incredibly the roads believe it or not there's wordss roads are worse than Michigan if you can believe that there's no traffic rules everybody just drives and um they want to turn around go the other way they just go across the median they don't stop at red lights they don't they the horns I thought I was going to have PTSD when I got back from the beeping horns because every time they come to turn or pull in front of you they just beat their horn so it was pretty crazy I could never drive in Detroit until I went overseas now Detroit is great I don't have any problem um there's no hot water first time we went to a hotel I told John I think John Wayne had a shootout in here there's like holes like bullet holes in the walls and some of the areas we went to we supported the radio broadcasts and I always thought that was kind of pointless I'm just going to be honest you know I just thought have this man in in this room all by himself speaking into this mic and but you know when we went to these remote areas and you could see that you could not reach these areas it was so difficult the travel was so difficult and you started seeing these churches popping up in the middle of nowhere and you realize the benefit of those radio broadcasts and I know one time we went to this Indian village and we were told do not eat the food you will for sure get sick so we go up there and I'm watching brother Bill Sanchez and the other brothers they're eating like they never ate before and I'm like did they not get the memo we're not supposed to be eating this food it was in the the top of this mountain it was so difficult to get there and yeah so I couldn't even communicate with the dogs over there they only understand Spanish and I love dogs you know and they just looked at me like yeah we don't understand what you're saying the second time I went I felt like I was more prepared I took my beef jerky because didn't do the food very well they took it away from me at the airport they said that we have mad cow disease here in the states and I wasn't allowed to bring it there and their food is like horrendous so we started um going to gas stations to get food because you just go in there and you look for anything packaged in America and you're like I hate this food at home but as long as it said Pakistan America it was doable so um the one trip we took two of our daughters joy and Elizabeth and this was the scariest experience I have ever had in my life it's like it was like Cedar Point in slow motion we were going up the side of this mountain John chose to walk maybe that was a better idea I don't know but this truck we were riding and there was literally this much room left after the truck took up the road before it was like this huge thousands of feet drop off we were screaming me and Elizabeth and joy we were just screaming driving with this person that doesn't speak English and it was just like the worst so we finally get to the top and I was like oh thank goodness we didn't die and then we had to walk across this bridge that was a swinging bridge and that was terrifying we get to the other side and we go to these people's house and they wanted us to eat and joy was so hungry she started eating I said Joy there's bugs in that she's like Mom I don't care I'm hungry and I was just like I'm not hungry I can't do this you can't go over there without getting sick that's like something you do and I remember one night it was before church and the church was on the side of a mountain and I just remember my my stomach was just churning and just looking across the mountains and that scripture came to me that I look to the hills once from Once cometh my help and I said Lord please just calm my stomach I don't even know where the bathroom is at it's just it was it was hard at times to you know stomach the food um when you're there you start to to Really witness the Simplicity of God there's no distractions they don't have anything you know you go in their house they have a dirt floor and and um you know a lot of them don't have refrigeration or anything and and they treat you like royalty you feel like this big cuz they will give you anything they have they just want you we went to so many places that said we've never had we've never seen an American before you know and they just treated you and it just humbles you you know and you realize these are God's children amen and we're all going to you know have the same reward when it's when it's over and I remember driving home one night and we would drive for hours on those scary roads through the mountains and I was just thinking of myself I said Lord I just I wish I had a million dollars I could just meet all these needs these people have so many needs and something just told me the gospel that we were bringing that was greater riches that provided everything they needed and you know it was worth all the struggles and you know there was uh a language barrier of course you know John and I did a lot of talking with our hands describing things you know cornflakes come with hot milk so we had to try to figure that out and U at times we were without an interpreter and and um the language barrier was was hard because you know obviously we don't speak Spanish but but you know the love of God is the same in every language and we all have the same father and you could feel so connected to different people that you never met before but you know because we share that the blood of Jesus we we could you know be the same um I I just you know somebody those were some of the things that we experienced overseas and and it was you know a time that you know I'm glad I got to go and experience those things but today you know we're in a different place and the mission mission starts right outside those doors and I just want to encourage you that you know God can speak through a donkey he can he can help any one of us to reach somebody it's just like I said missions is the heart of God if you really really want to please the Lord missions is where you do that and um there's a scripture about just a cup of cold water you know given in his name will have its reward and I believe that every one of us are capable of that and I just want to encourage you today to pray about what God would have you to do to reach out to somebody to do something for Missions you know you don't have to send a semi overseas or something but just to you're capable of doing something and just to find that you know that place where God wants you to be in his kingdom so that's that's pretty much it [Applause] amen let's stand together and sing bring them in as we get ready to dismiss I appreciate that testimony some things I never
