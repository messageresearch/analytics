the word amen hallelujah amen i just asked our sister to include the word in that because you know so often we think about we separate the word from god and we can't do that and uh i believe that uh it's appropriate to uh worship the word as it comes forth to our hearts this morning let's just stand as if we get ready to change the order of service as a brother comes and to sing only believe [Applause] [Music] all amen are possible only believe only believe only believe all things are possible only believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i read amen lord i receive all things are possible lord i received lord i received lord i received all things are possible lord i receive amen that's why we're here today and it's by the grace of god that we do receive amen we can't force it revelation is a gift of god and uh but he has revelation for his bride amen he's promised it amen well god bless you i greet you in the name of jesus today in the in the love of god amen it's good to be in god's house to be with god's people and to to be around god's presence um i want to say thank you to those that prayed this morning been praying for the service you know sometimes our labors the fruit of our labors don't come for a while but we just keep pressing on and i just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart i just feel so incapable of being able to fulfill the will of god for his bride here i've always felt that way and by you praying it just really increases encourages us and gives us faith to believe that god will take what little we have and just meet the needs that would be amongst us amen god bless you turn with me if you would to the book of saint matthew chapter seven we'll have three scripture readings today matthew chapter seven jeremiah chapter 29 in psalms 85. you know it's a privilege to hear the gospel brother branham says no man has the right to hear the gospel twice if everyone hasn't heard it once and just think about how many times we've heard the gospel in other words we have a responsibility our candles lit to go light somebody else's and it's the same thing with uh when we get a revelation as mrs bigglesworth said that we have a responsibility with every revelation i think everything that god gives us we now have a revelation we have a responsibility with what god gives us just like the prophet taught us that the gift that god has given us is not for ourselves it's for others and so god is constantly giving us things and that now yes it's to help dress us and get us ready but we also know the obligation to go share that with others and this morning we want to talk about peace and as god gives us peace i believe we have a responsibility to give peace to others to build peace with others to share peace with others and of course it's not ours it's god's to start with right yes amen let's bow in a word of prayer heavenly father we thank you for the this wonderful privilege to be in your presence today and we're still praying for more of your presence that you'd come down in a very special way to have a one of our hearts and warm our hearts with your love and your goodness to us lord we're so in debt to you lord we're so needy of you lord we can't minister your word we can't hear your word we can't live your word without you and we pray that you would come and do it all this morning lord as we're looking to the holy ghost lord we pray for your your spirit lord we also pray that lord you'd be with those that are not here this morning for various reasons we asked lord that you'd come to their homes go to their homes go to their places go to their work wherever they would be lord and just mend the bodies mend the minds mend the spirits and lord just encourage and help each one of them we pray lord we ask that you be with those that would be live streaming today lord lord that you would be in their homes and father that the word would become just as real to them there as it is to us here we thank you for this lord now we commit all these things into your hands and ask your blessings on your word today in jesus precious thing we ask amen amen matthew chapter 7 and we're going to read just two verses there verses 22 and 23 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity now this group didn't get what they expected they didn't get an expected end they didn't get what they thought they were going to get all because they never knew the true nature of god amen they thought they knew enough but they never knew the true nature of god and how important it is to know more of god that's why we come to church right amen jeremiah chapter 29 now this group gets an expected end for verse 11 jeremiah 29 verse 11 for i know the thoughts i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end this group knows the true nature of god that's the only way we can get an expected in amen amen and for us this morning this is where we're going to be at in psalms 85 verse 8 psalms 85 verse 8. the bible says i will hear what god the lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and to his saints but let them not turn again to folly amen god bless you you may be seated wonderful word god has always had thoughts of peace he is the prince of peace we can conclude that a uh a peaceful prince is always looking to make peace with with others and to to maintain it we could say that his his makeup and his nature is peaceful his motives and his objectives are peaceful we could say his end game would be one of peace it's understandable that his thoughts would be thoughts of peace and not of evil and to have a peaceful outcome and that's what god has amen you know a lot of people want peace and they want the benefits of peace but they don't have the nature their nature isn't peaceful think about the whole world wants peace because so many stickers on the back of their cars are talking about world peace and peace and get along with everybody but their own nature isn't peaceful they would like peace but they don't know spiritually how to make peace themselves currently a lot of people make peace by just separating themselves from somebody all right amen can you imagine where we would be today if that's the way that god made peace by separating himself from everyone that disagreed with him amen can you imagine he would not have a bride today without spot or wrinkle he would not even be able to take a bride out of the gentiles right just because they disagreed with him every single person that god saved disagreed with god their nature was so selfish they didn't want to give their will over to god but that isn't god's nature to separate amen i think that anytime we have thoughts about separating from someone because we don't get along with them those thoughts are not spiritual thoughts they're carnal thoughts they're not god's thoughts god is a peacemaker he makes peace where there is no peace he takes trouble and calms the storms of life he takes sickness and illness and he brings healing he takes confusion and brings clarity and understanding he takes doubts and worries and he dissolves them he's a waymaker he takes someone who's lost and he points them in the right way he leads them to truth and eventually sets them free god is a peacemaker and he doesn't do it by separating himself from others in fact he kneels down he gets his hands dirty and he washes feet now to me we all know the story we all know about but how many is practicing it you know there are so many needs that we could just be running to to help somebody but we're just too busy now god in the garden he had to separate himself from adam and eve and he put flaming swords there because he's a holy god and he didn't want them to partake of the tree of life in that condition but even at that time that god had thoughts of peace to make a way where there just seemed to be no way he had an expected end for adam and eve he certainly did and it was not of evil but of peace god loves man he created man to love god back he doesn't take pleasure in the death of the wicked or his enemies he tries to make friends out of all his enemies every man was his enemy and he made a way for every man to come back to him amen god is omnipotent he knows everything before it happens he knew that man would fall to his own will because he didn't want to obey god's will right think about it he fell to his own will that's how terrible our will is but he provided a way in his thoughts and he had thoughts of peace to give an expected end though and those thoughts became expressed in in words and and those words will not return void that god spoke amen so it's going to happen turn with me if you would to first peter chapter 1 verse 18. for as much as you know that ye were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and of gold from your vain conversations received by the tradition of your fathers but with the precious blood of the lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was for ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you so in the beginning the foundation of the world god had thoughts to bring a peace and a remedy for you and i amen who by him we do do uh i'm sorry who by him do believe in god that raised him from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in god seeing ye have purified your souls how do you do that in obeying what you hear at church when you read the bible when you listen to the tapes it isn't just a word to listen to you obey the truth through the spirit unto unfraimed unfriend love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart servantly amen it's a lot different than fake amen that's really good being born again now here it is being born again not of a corruptable seed but incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever that's what's happening to us when we hear the word and we say amen that's a living word when the holy spirit inside of you makes it real you become the word amen amen it's through faith he broke down the middle wall of partition he went and offered himself in the flesh for you and i and calvary became our way of peace back to god amen ephesians chapter 2 verse 12 says that at that time ye were without christ having no hope and without god in the world that's where we were just totally separated from god verse 13 but now in christ jesus ye were some ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by the blood of christ i can say this that that god drew a bigger circle he drew a bigger circle that's what he did amen for he is our peace who have made both one and have broken down the middle wall partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in the ordinances for us to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace god didn't want to be alone he didn't want to be separated and a part of him was separated out in the world that was his wife and he made a way for his wife to come back she was lost she was undone she didn't have the knowledge of even her condition but he showed her her condition and he made a way for her to come back he drew that bigger circle so they could take twain could be one god's interest is making us one with him and to have an expected end that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereof god comes in a human body he speaks the word a virgin shall conceive the word is spoken it comes to pass and he comes and he offers himself that he might become one with his bride again because she's been lost she's been separated and i just want to touch on this oneness here because the end game is the same game that god had at the beginning john chapter 17 verse 20 he says neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall come shall believe on me through their word that's right so he's getting ready to know he's praying for his disciples the most important thing and he says that they all may be one as thou father and me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou sent me so notice what's on the mind of god in jesus prayer is to be won this is the expected end that there would be a oneness between us and god now this should be our focus our main focus in life nothing else not just um not just saying we're in the message in the bride going to message church um is a oneness with god amen these things bring us to such a oneness with god that nothing matters to us except oneness with god and when we're truly one with god we're one with his people you remember that it is impossible to be one with god and not to be one with his people it is impossible that's what a denomination is can you imagine being in heaven i'm with jesus i don't know where all those guys are at we just got to get a oneness spirit by one spirit we're all baptized into the body that one spirit not five different spirits and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one again repeating the word one i in them and thou and me that they may be made perfect in one he doesn't even want us one but kind of one he wants us perfect in one and that the world may know that thou sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me right amen you become one with god by the word when you receive the living word not the dead letter but the word becomes so real to you that you actually unite with the word and say so be it in my life so be it let me let me live this life that you're saying my words are spirit and their life they are manifested in the flesh that's what's supposed to happen in this hour and is happening to the believer to the bride who believes god is daring us to believe to become one with his word for by one spirit the bible says in first corinthians chapter 12 verse 12 4 as the body is one and have many members yes and all the members of that one body remember our one body so also is christ showing us the same thing so it we we should be so in love with one another for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles we've bonded or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit now i just want to say this there should be no difference between me hugging any brother in this church the feeling should be the same now when our flesh it's no i got favorites it's a real thing but we need to really get out of it now i understand that there's certain callings and jesus took peter and james and they went up a little further to pray i understand all that that's god's business that's not our business our subject peace let's get back to ephesians chapter 2 verse 16 and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the entity thereby amen now what is the enmity it is the power of satan over your nature that's the enemy without the holy ghost our will is always going to prevail right amen it takes the holy spirit inside of us to carry out his will and came and god drew a bigger circle and preached peace unto you which were afar off and to them that were nigh for through him through christ we both have access by one spirit unto the father now there are four ye are no more strangers and foreigners no more you're a fellow citizen with the saints and of the household of god amen isn't it a wonderful thing when you first come into christ and you kind of feel like well this is strange everybody's you know acting like this and saying amen and loving praying out loud and they just love everybody and you kind of feel kind of like like out of place we've all felt that but then when we realize who we belong to that we're part of the same family amen we're fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone amen in whom though all the building fitly framed together growth unto a holy temple unto the lord in whom he also built it together for a habitation of god through the spirit god doesn't want any leaky windows he doesn't want any places where the wind's blowing through and the snow was coming through he wants us kind of framed together knitted together helping one another taking care of the needs in the house amen every one of you that has a house both you and your wife feel that's your house even the children feel this is our home this is where we live so each one of you feel a responsibility when there's something wrong in that house that it needs to get taken care of tree falls on the house and messes something up it's not just one person that feels oh because this is god's house and we're all responsible for god's house you know brother branham brother branham said it like this he said when he preached in church ordered he said everything is fine and dandy as everything's going real good he says but remember and he's repeating what paul said there in the book of acts that when he was going to leave that grievous wolves were going to come in other words he said satan would not leave you that way even though everything's going good he's still working on something it may take him months to do but he's working on something but what did he tell us to do he said you just come together that much stronger that much tighter because we're a house we're the house of god amen if you don't stand for for for god how is he going to stand for you it's not our brother not our sister it's the devil trying to get through amen and it's you know the devil's not gone he's still causing trouble all you got to do is look what happened yesterday in your life so he can't get through today he'll try next week he can't get through next week he'll try next month but we stay fortified in christ we're a family the family of god amen now god had thoughts for us from the beginning to give us an expected in he made a way for us to become one with him he became us that we might become him we could say like this we're a chip off the old block and god not only identifies his children as children that can love everyone but also children that make peace that's right in the beatitudes matthew chapter 5 verse 9 blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god he identifies his own children as someone that makes peace he identifies his children as being a chip off the old block god's children are peacemakers their thoughts are thoughts of peace as well their makeup and their nature is peaceful their objectives and their their motives are peaceful yes their end game is one to bring peace they lay hands on the sick and they recover that's bringing peace to the body they condensate to men of low estate why to help them not to not to separate them but to help them amen they pray for god's spiritual blessings on others in fact the bible says they're always praying supplication with perseverance in the spirit for all saints i believe they pray they support the ministry amen they restore others who are overtaken in faults and they they do it with the spirit of meekness they draw the bigger circle they don't run and go talk behind their back i'm telling you that is as far as away from the peacemakers i know could be they bear one another's burdens they wash one another's feet they lay down their lives for the brethren amen they go to their brother and their sister you know what they do they make peace with them they practice forgiving seven times 70 because they really are peacemakers just like their heavenly father their father hasn't our father has not ordained us to start proving who's right who's wrong right it's true he has our dangerous children to recompense evil for evil in fact he teaches them vengeance doesn't belong to the children he said vengeance belongs to me i will repay it's not our job to do that amen the fathers are dangerous children to live peaceably with all men he orders the steps of a good man his children walk with their feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace amen he leads his sheep besides still peaceable waters amen he prepares a table for his uh he protects the table for us in the presence of our enemies if our enemy wants to stay here fine judas you want to stay here fine doesn't matter god's a god of peace there's no fussing there's no fighting there's no arguing they don't bite and devour one another in fact if their enemy is hungry they just feed them if they want the word give them the word they want love give them love they want encouragement give them encouragement they want christ give them christ amen blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god wow something we don't think about very much do we we'll stand as i'm a child of god but we won't give two seconds to think about making peace now that just doesn't make sense to me it's it's it's so denominational thinking you know i mean this is how we believe if you believe like this you're in i just want to believe the word does the word am i believing the word or am i believing what i want to believe i don't want to call myself a child of god and not be a peacemaker that is such a lie every man's a liar but if i'm a peacemaker i don't have to call myself a child of god i'm living i'm a child of god we know that god is not a respecter person we know that he's not a god of confusion amen and when i see either of these two being manifested i do not feel a peaceable spirit of christ just as god has made peace with us when we didn't care we should be making peace with others when they don't care that's what that means well they don't want to they don't listen well aren't you glad god didn't have that opinion about you when he came to you do you have the mind of christ we need to bridge the gap jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever in his bride ephesians chapter 4 verse 1 i therefore the prisoner of the lord i beseech you that you walk worthy in other words walk as children of god amen with all lowliness and meekness with long suffering for bearing one another and i want to know the last time you did that i want to know the last time you did that i want to know the last time you did that for somebody you didn't like somebody you got a problem with now you can tell me pretty quickly the last time you separated from somebody you didn't agree with but that's not what the scripture is saying you got to walk with them forbearance include them draw that bigger circle amen be a children of god endeavoring working hard to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond to peace oh my endeavoring you know that's work that means work that means if i got a problem with my brother and he's being a little standoffish not try to draw a circle and include him in and he just kind of steps out of that circle that means i got to work again endeavor not try once and stop not try twice but endeavor just keep working at it amen i want to live the word i'm not living all the word i want to live all the word amen and i'll tell you there's like the more and more i'm honest with myself the more and more i see that i'm not living this word it's by the grace of god that we're here today that our eyes are open that we have a chance it's not about knowing it's about living amen and the only way you're going to live it is getting some hot water get a chance to prove yes there is one body one spirit even as you're called into one hope of your calling so we got to endeavor to keep the unity of the one body of christ you know what the problem is the problem is in our thoughts we don't think this person's in the body so we won't try you tell me if that's the spirit of christ i should have to do that i just you know all the only thing i want to see is the spirit of christ living in you amen i don't care how long you've been in the message i don't care what you know i want to see you loving one another i want to see you laying down your life for one another i want to see you standing in the gap and drawing a bigger circle even around me not carnally separating right be a peacemaker every one of us were enemies with god and he made peace with us yeah he paid the price but he still tugged on her heart he still showed us he loved us and he wooed us what are we doing with others i don't that's not my job that's got that's you know if it wasn't for somebody else you wouldn't be here today god used somebody to bring you here today to bring you to him we're in debt blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god amen the children of god have thoughts of peace their thoughts are peace just like their heavenly father their thoughts are are to see an expected end with the brother or the sister they got a problem with they they expect an end right not they have a humble mind about it the mind of christ they have a servant mentality i need to reach out to them they they esteem them better than themselves they don't think evil they don't think ill of their neighbor deuteronomy 27 says verse 24 curse it is he that strikes at his neighbor secretly they don't judge others in their thoughts but rather they prefer one another over themselves sometimes we end up judging others and we don't even realize we're doing it at the time and kind of be carnal like that can't we we as god's children ought to be better peacemakers by now we need to learn to to try the spirits more but you know what spirit we need to be trying is our spirit we need to have regular checkups about our motives and our objectives the prophet taught us that are we trying to make peace with others are we trying to prove that we're right or trying to prove they're wrong or trying to prove something else where is the motive where is the objective right amen try the spirit are we being critical are we tearing someone else down or are we building are we trying to make peace well brother john i just i don't want nothing to do with them that's your prerogative that ain't god's and that ain't the children of god that's all i'm saying you take it as it is i'd rather say with the word i'd rather draw a bigger circle i'd rather try to line up with the word than my feelings try to make the the message line up with me i'd rather not lean to my own understanding i want the understanding of god amen usually when someone is acting critical they're not very good at helping find solutions they're all too they're all together two totally different spirits one trying to make peace and and and one just being critical of a situation one spirit souls discord and the other soul is peace you get done one there's going to be more of a separation one there's going to be more of peace one spirit doesn't really care enough to help while the other spirit cares enough to lay down their own will because that's what you got to do to help somebody is get your will out of the way lay down your will one spirit is an expression of negativity while the other spirit is an expression of faith when god said that he has an expected end for us he knows that no matter what adam and eve go through no matter what we went through he has an expected end for us he believes but the problem is satan tries to get in our mind and doesn't get us to believe for our brother and her sister doesn't get us to believe for an expected end for them a negative spirit operates from thoughts of doubt and hopelessness what's the use nobody can help them they don't know what they're doing there you know every single person in here can help me if you wanted to amen to help me be a better christian to live this word to if you wanted to help me you could that's right every single one of you you just gotta want to it's only going to make the body better but you need an attitude of helping a positive spirit operates from thoughts of faith confidence hope and a peaceful solution i believe i can help my brother and sister i i want to reach out to them i'm going to start with prayer and i'm going to move forward now this is the right spirit but trying to accomplish it without the right spirit is just fruitless we have to have a spirit of faith it's a beautiful spirit that god operates from for he is the prince of peace he will bring peaceful outcomes through each one of us if we just yield our vessel to him that's what i'm trying to say god can use every one of you to help me so it's not a matter of me being wrong it's not a matter of your brother and sister being wrong it's we're all wrong we only got to spend five minutes with somebody we'll find a lot of things wrong with that person come on that's the truth but how many wants to take a minute and help that person homie's got enough faith to do that somebody's got enough holy ghost to do that i mean he's got a a new creation enough to do that he cares do you care [Music] i think as god's children we need to focus more on growing up amen we're at the end it's it's time to start you know when you're running a long race you don't come out of the gate sprinting hard because it's a you got to run the race with patience the bible says but we're getting right down to the end we only have a little bit more time left and we need to start as every runner raises at the end he picks up his speed we need to start getting serious about this word amen ephesians chapter 4 verse 15 speaking the truth in love wow it will get further along if we use love brother john love is corrective yes i know love is corrective but love is not hateful there's a big difference speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things that's what i'm saying the more we come to church the more we read the word the more we listen the more i see i need to grow up the thing is do i want to grow up or do i want to stay a baby to grow up in him and all things which is the head even christ amen you know we all need to grow up but some of us are still acting like babies way too much causing contentions divisions trying to prove who's right and wrong sowing seeds of discord among the brethren that will eventually manifest james said in chapter 3 verse 5 even soul the tongue is a little member boasteth great things behold how great a matter just a little fire kindleth and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so was the tongue among our members right that it defiled the whole body and set it on fire the course of nature and is set on fire of hell you ever get in just a real outright yelling match before you know it you're saying things you haven't said in years it's true that is the truth like where in the world did that come from because that little tongue that can set a fire at a blaze and make the blazes of fires in california seem like nothing that's what a little tongue can do lord help us it's time to put away our childish thinking amen and learn to become spiritual peacemakers spiritual peacemakers god is an expected end for us thoughts of peace first corinthians 13 11 says when as a child i spake as a child understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became mature i put away childish thinking it's time to be thinking like a chip off the old block how god thinks god thinks about peace not just towards us but towards your brother and sister amen he has the same desires for them as he does for you he doesn't love you more than them why do you think that why do you think that why do you think you're so special because satan has gotten in your heart and mine you're not more special than anybody and we need to start acting like in fact you want to act like somebody's that there's some sort of separation between you and somebody i got scripture for you you need to esteem somebody else better than you you want to bring a separation use that one esteem somebody else better than you in your thoughts in your thoughts in your heart your mind and expected in i see that brother in that condition that sister in that condition that fallen state i see them in a better place instead of well i don't know i've been praying for them there's nothing seems to be why don't you try loving them just try having compassion while you stay there until you your tears come out of your your eyes that are full of compassion your heart just swells up and is enlarged for that person something will happen being spirituality what you know they what where you came from hey whatever you think it's about living this word we need to hunger god's holy spirit will lead his wife which is us to peaceful solutions with everyone everyone in this church should have said amen to that one he's going to lead us to draw a bigger circle god's holy spirit has an expected end of peace for those who are around you in your life it could be your work your home your family your church hebrews chapter 12 verse 14 says follow peace with all men follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord looking diligently you ever come up to a four-way or a crossroad and you just kind of quick look and go oh i didn't see them looking diligently looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness spring up trouble you and thereby many be defiled one little root yes can eventually grow into such a powerful weapon that actually many people get defiled many and your root of bitterness isn't towards many it's usually towards one right amen but that could affect many yes right because of what it is it's it's a root of the devil amen it's a root of the first nature that we were born with right so i say this look for any root inside of you that could be better and get it pulled out quick because you don't want it coming out two years from now i'm serious it'll stay there it'll wait for the time and it'll defile many we need to get steered this is for the bride this is not for the foolish virgin this is for the bride because the bride has to deal with this we can't say i'm brian i don't have don't you be telling me i don't get no roots we're all supposed to be following christ christ came to every one of us at some time and said follow me amen we heard that that's right he is our example paul said follow me as i follow christ he says but if i preach anything that i've already preached don't follow me he said let me be a curse let's just follow paul for a moment in first peter or i'm going to read first peter chapter 2 verse 20. but we're going to follow that example i should say because we're allowed to follow anybody as long as we're following christ first peter chapter 2 verse 20 so here is peter talking about following christ for what glory is that when you're buffeted for your fault you shall take it patiently but when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with god it's hard to do that wouldn't you say that but god is saying i don't have babies don't don't remain a baby it's just it's time to grow up for even here and too where you call it even because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled he reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judge's righteous what was he doing he was making peace he was drawing a bigger circle he was not being contentious and i'm an eye for an eye and a tooth i'm going to prove the wrong it's two totally different spirits who his own self his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree now i want to ask you a question was the last time you bore somebody else's burden that's exactly what christ did there when is the last time you bore somebody else's burden christ bore our sins but we're too busy to help somebody else with their sin amen they're too low they're too out of this they're i don't like that there's a root of bitterness how brother sister you may not like me you may not like this message but this is the truth this is for the bride it's about growing up anybody can talk the talk but when you can start getting some holes in your knees because you've been spending so much time trying to help somebody amen and you know what everybody's going to see it everybody's going to see it what a glorious time it'll be you know when you get to heaven with the bride they will be manifest they manifested all this that's right brother branson without perfect love you can't enter in somebody is going to get serious about it there's many going to come to me oh lord i did this i did this i did but they didn't get an expected in because they didn't think they needed the nature of god and the nature of god is to do his will not our own amen we can't do our will and god's will because that's what they did there's only god's will god's nature born again not a corruptible seed but incorruptable by the word of god that liveth and abideth forever we should be excited about god give me one chance this week to live this help me to start building start learning how to make peace starts in your heart with god when you got peace with god i'm telling you you'll know how to be peaceful with others but i'll tell you it's hard to make peace with others when you don't got peace with god who his own self bear sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness amen whose stripes were healed for he were as sheep gone astray but now a return unto the shepherd and the bishop of your souls why because god drew a bigger circle and this is how we lead others back to christ who've gone astray we do the same thing yes god uses us god used somebody to get us god used us to get somebody well they're already in they've already rejected me how many times have you rejected christ this week and you're going to give me that excuse come on jesus said learn of me for i'm meek and lowly learned of me why did he want us to learn well he knew we needed rest for our souls and the only way we could get rest for our souls is learn of him and do what he tells us to do but the other reason he wanted us to learn of him is so we would know how to bring rest to somebody else to bring peace to somebody else to bring christ to somebody else how many people go to college seminars some sort of teaching on religion and try to find god and they're further away from god than when they started the only way that people are going to see god today is it being lived is it being lived in the bride and she's the only one that can live at this high amen as the world is growing darker our light should be getting lighter despite what's happening in the world despite what's happening in our life despite the troubles the problems the things we're going through our light should be beaming it's all that matters time is fading if we don't get interested in god i'm telling you god is moving forward amen first john chapter 3 verse 15 whosoever hateth his brother is a murder now i just want to say we do not have anybody who says i hate them but this hatred is i love less than the body of christ that's what i'm saying i love less than the body of christ because see the body of christ is one and when you love less than that you're separating so whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderers have eternal life abiding in them so if that spirit is there just rebuke it understand i'm saying just rebuke that spirit get it out of there real quick hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for you and i look we ought to be laying down our lives for the brethren real clear real clear don't make any sense why it's not happening just do it if we don't learn christ if we don't have the right understanding the right nature we could end up using our sword to actually cut somebody out we've seen it i'm going to straighten them out i'm going to tell them like it is i'm going to make them look bad feel bad because they are bad to the bone wow that's not what the sword's for the sword is not for that look paul said in second corinthians chapter six verse three giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed we're going to show you what the sword is for in a little bit but in all things approving ourselves as ministers of god in much patience in afflictions and necessities and distresses and stripes and prisoners and turmoils laborers and watchings and fastings there is where you prove your real minister not behind the pulpit not by you talking to somebody one-on-one not through the taxing no it's when you're in these situations that you prove you're a minister by how you handle what you're going through you do it by pureness by knowledge by long suffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love and friend untrained by the word of truth by the power of god by the arm of righteousness on the right hand on the left by honor and dishonored by evil report and good report as deceivers you ever been called a deceiver yet true as unknown and yet you're well known by god as dying behold we live we're chastised but we're not killed as sorrowful yet we're always rejoicing as poor yes yet making many rich i had one brother call me he wanted to tell me what the need was back there and he said god rich you bless you at the end of his message and he says well god is going to have to bless me richly if he wants me to give to give you all that you're asking for and i said i'm a little wink which poor making many rich but we do that with the word of god amen amen not money as having nothing yet possessing all things oh ye corinthians our mouth is open unto you and our heart is enlarged paul's heart was so full of love and peace that he didn't believe in bringing offense to anybody that's why he was able to suffer so much because he was following the example that jesus gave he was following his footsteps yes to the t to the t look at the very announcement of the coming of christ in luke chapter 2 the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord and he shall and this shall be assigned unto you he shall find the babe wrapped in swallowing clothes laying there in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of hosts they were praising god and look what they were saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace peace good will toward men now isaiah called jesus the prince of peace and here the angels this announcement peace people without enough spirit of god tend to see god in more of a judgmental way like jesus going into the temple and cleaning up all their selfishness with the whip you know god can do that because vengeance belongs to him but we don't have whips in here we don't act do that we let jesus do that through the word amen but we don't have any part of that we don't hold the whip we don't nothing no thoughts it's all gods all through the working of the holy ghost he keeps the church clean i've watched it many times people will use the sword to actually hurt others to prove they're right or something like that it's sad but we should never ever do that in matthew chapter 10 verse 33 i just want to show a balance in this right now jesus said but whosoever shall deny me before men him i also denied before my father in heaven think not that i come to send peace on the earth but i came i came not to send peace but a sword now what's jesus referring to here i came not to send peace but a sword here's the the prince of peace and he has come with a sword but this sword is to separate all those who will not believe him that's what he came to do to separate all those who don't care about following his word now he gives everybody a chance that's why the gospel has to be preached in all the world but he separates those who will not unite with him he doesn't take someone who doesn't want the word and swords them up and kills them the sword is against anyone who openly and willingly denies christ the word the word is what does this separate the sword is what does the separating amen but he didn't come to to bring peace to everybody even if they don't separate from the world you understand what i'm saying but the world wants a preaching like that peace to the world peace to everybody that's not the peace the only peace we have is in the word in christ he is our peace so the sword separates now verse 35 for him come to set a man at variance against his father and his daughter against his mother and his daughter-in-law against his mother-in-law and a man's full shall be of his own household and he that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me he that loveth son and daughter more than me is not worthy of me he that taketh not up his cross and followed after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it so what god is saying here the sword that god has sent is his word and the sword will will separate all that don't believe him to be number one in their life even their own will their own will their own family you have to put god first and what that means is when you hear to be a peacemaker that's putting god first and you follow that follow peace with all men amen only people who love god first are going to be there in heaven that's what brother bryan meant when he said only perfect love shall enter in perfect love is complete love for god only god he's there's no room for me amen there is room to love everyone in his kingdom because jesus said the second commandment is like the first love your neighbor as yourself right the whole the whole law is in these two commandments god has to be first amen we're not called to sword anyone the sword is for us to cut away all unbelief all doubts all fears all arrogancy all pride all of our first nature that's what the sword is for it's to cut all the world away from us that's what the sword is for amen god does all the sword work not us he uses a five-fold ministry the voice of many waters brother brahm said in the patna's vision the voice of many waters what does waters represent if you want to mark it down turn to revelation 17 15 and you'll find that the bible said the waters that thou saw is thickness multitudes and people and tongues all right voice what a horrible thing for a drifting soul on the sea of life no pilot to guide him loose floating with the tides to hear the roar of the great cataracts the falls what a horrible thing it would be to a soul drifting the voice of many waters what is his voice it's the judgment the voice of the ministers through the holy spirit that's cried out to the people in every age standing there i don't know about you but we see it every time we come to church we see god screaming out to his ministers that's how real and how much god's here that sword god uses the word to cut away the world out of our life he's not interested in cutting us away from the body he's interested in cutting the world away from us to be in the body that's the nature of god that's what we should be doing seven times seventy i've tried i've tried i've tried you haven't tried you don't even know what trying is that is right you need to work like god works you need to bend his knees as much you need to bend your knees as much as he bends his you need to lay down your life as much as he did he gave his all amen too much were respected persons i like this person because i don't like this person because that's right that's not the children of god amen that's you know what you're saying my church is a denomination i'm the denomination of john martin that's right that's what you're saying but the children of god are peacemakers john chapter 12 verse 46. when we come to church we are literally standing at god's judgment that's what brother brandon said we met we come to find out where we're at with god but god is not judging everybody no he's given time for them to make a decision amen the judgment comes at the end we gladly come to church bow our knees worship the lord say thy will be done lord so be it right but to the world their judgment's coming at the end right john chapter 12 verse 46 i am come to light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness that's why he's come that we would not abide in darkness and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not isn't that isn't that kind for i came not to judge the world but to save the world amen peace on earth good will towards men but he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words have one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day there is the sword vengeance is mine saith the lord i will repay it is god's word god's judgment amen but to us who received the word he is our peace amen the prince of peace amen if i could say today for the bride shalom for those who give their all to god there is an expected end a peace for her amen but for those who give only part of their will this is important like we read at the beginning many will come to me on that day will not get that expected in in fact he has promised tribulation now the these are church-going people they were virgins yes it's a scary thing that's what brother bran is the scary thing to to to to to be there listening to the word of god and not letting it penetrate you you know because satan knows how to harden our hearts he knows how to get our will to prevail against what's being preached soften my heart oh god soften my heart don't let satan deceive you in thinking that you own that you've given enough don't do that amen you know i have about five pages that i have to just let go so just pray for me that i want to wrap this up the bride is offering peace and salvation to those that are around her she's the only one amen amen the other church goers will not do that isaiah 52 verse 7 can will you let me go just a little bit how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bring good tidings that publish peace that bring good tidings of good and publish salvation that saith unto zion thy god reigneth god's nature is the same today it hasn't changed god inside of you will continue to draw the bigger circle god would have all men to be saved come to the knowledge of the truth right amen there's no way the prophet would have taught us to draw a bigger circle around someone who separates from us if it wasn't god's nature amen right so it is god's nature we need to practice it not be afraid not be afraid of turn down reject that has nothing to do with it draw the circle love the unlovable show them you're one with them there's a reward for those that draw a bigger circle you know the bible says all the paths that wisdom take are peaceful that's proverbs 3 17 if you want to write it down james 3 17 says but the wisdom that is from above is first pure and then what next peaceable it's gentle it's easy to be entreated it's full of mercy no judgment full of mercy good fruits without partiality right no respect to persons without hypocrisy it's just genuine amen and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace we've got to get serious about making peace don't don't walk around acting like you're at peace with everybody don't act like it be it amen be it make it don't assume you're going to assume assume you need to draw a circle there's a reward for drawing a bigger circle isaiah 32 17 and the work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance forever and my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and ensure dwellings and quiet resting places how many times have you just wish you had peace all right just keep drawing circles when you're alone you know and the devil puts a thought in your head about somebody pray for them immediately because satan will take that as an idle mind and idle time and say something negative to you as soon as you do that as soon as you do that what you're doing is you're cutting off having a peaceable habitation after you're done thinking that amen first corinthians chapter 2 verse 9. talk about an expectation the bible says i have not seen ear have not heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things that god had prepared for them that love him that's right amen now do you love him enough to draw a bigger circle amen i believe the more you give of yourself the more of heaven is prepared for you he rewards according to works it's a love affair jesus couldn't say it's not up to me you know who's going to sit on my right hand and who's going to sit on my left but i believe god's nature he wants to reward those who give their all to him amen romans 8 verse 18 for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time they're not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us so it doesn't matter how much you're suffering to draw the circle right sure draw in a circle of suffering obviously but it's not worthy to be compared what you're going to get from it the lion is going to lay down with the lamb isaiah chapter 2 verse 4 and he shall judge among the nations shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks nations shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war anymore o house of jacob come ye and let us walk in the light of the lord there will be a time of peace but god has left this peace today and i want to end with this little thought god has left us with peace today john 14 26 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i've said unto you he said peace i leave with you my peace that's the only peace i really want god's peace my peace i give unto you not as the world gives right you go along with the world everything's okay and the pressure that the world is putting on us we have a brother that's uh in in the in this message he's a doctor and he just got a report sent down from the asa or something like that that said he is not allowed to put on his birth certificates anymore whether they're male or female this world is falling apart what pressure is coming upon people who have different beliefs and standards but jesus said peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid you have heard i said unto you i go away and i and i come again unto you if i if you love me you would rejoice think about our our brother tim pruitt's wife to rejoice for her it's sad for those are left behind because i said this i go to my father for for my father is greater than i and now i have told you before it come to pass that that when it come to pass you might believe jesus answered he says do you now believe do you now believe he said behold the hours come yea has now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet i'm not alone because the father is with me these things have i spoken unto you that you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer overcome the world be of good cheer if god is living in you you have peace it is easy to draw a circle around somebody if god's in you it's harder than pushing a mountain if god's spirit isn't in you to draw a circle around somebody you got every reason in the world not to do it but if god is in you you can't stop that's what peacemakers do they shall be called the children of god so i'm saying to the bride shalom i'm going to end with this philippians chapter 4 verse 7. thank you for your patience and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus finally brother whatsoever things are true and honest and just and pure and lovely and of a good report if there's any virtue if there's any praise think on these things those things which you both learn and receive and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you praise the lord i want the god of peace to be with me it starts in our mind don't let the devil use your mind don't let him use your thoughts think on these things but john they're true they're john what the devil's telling me they're true about that they're true what that sister did doesn't matter it's not a right report it's not pure it's not lovely i want you to draw a bigger circle go help them wouldn't it be victorious for you to sit back at the end of the day and say my brother my sister had this problem but i but i went and i helped them what glory do you get if you're only buffing it for your own mistakes go in there and get buffeted try to help somebody get buffeted but help them help them you'll win them try know the thoughts i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end i will hear what god will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and his saints but let them not turn again to folly
