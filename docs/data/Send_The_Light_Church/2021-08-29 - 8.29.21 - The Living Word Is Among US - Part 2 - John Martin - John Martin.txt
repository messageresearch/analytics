crying holy holy holy nonstop and i believe that his people are holy too the bible says without holiness no man shall see the lord i believe that's what we're all striving for is to become more like him amen amen along with brother brown i want to greet you this morning in the name of jesus he may be seated just for a moment a few things we want to say before we bring forth the word um brother uh boaz had sent some pictures i want to share with you and a request is quite lengthy so i left it out a copy of it on the board but first thing i want to say is brother boaz had sent me um a report to pray for some christian missionaries who were going to be put to death the next day and it started out by saying confirmed and said well um we had a couple emails come in that uh said that it was a hulk so we sent it back to him and asked him to check it out we hadn't heard back from him but i like how one person had put at the center the email says it's always in order to be praying for our missionaries uh they're out on the front line winning souls and brother adam says it's always the work of the lord and many many many many missionaries have been put to death but we're sorry for uh getting anything across that wasn't totally 100 accurate wasn't our intention but i think you know part of us wants to send any kind of requests like that uh maybe through to brother marty he's uh he can figure i get to finding out brother mike just to see how accurate these are but it's not our intention to do that we were just passing along the information of a brother that has been doing a great work for the lord and uh we have some pictures we want to show you but uh some souls that have been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ our brother continues to work hard for the lord amen his sister anne puts puts those up brother boaz says dear brother john martin and saints that send the light thank you very much for your love your kind concerned prayer and your financial support all these years my family and i are doing okay going through storms in life and thanking god every day of our lives for one day at a time by his grace we baptized 11 people in jesus name please pray for the new converts since january of this year the lord has blessed us with 124 new souls who love the lord and this message of the hour amen i thought that was worth a praise report amen we're grateful to the lord amen is that all of them okay praise the lord we don't know these sisters these but these brothers but uh praise god we're going to meet them one day it's our family look at that isn't that beautiful just one of them is worth ten thousand worlds it's amazing how god can look to the inside of a man and see such value amen we're grateful for our brother for the work that he's doing and for all god's missionaries we've heard a good report from brother rowell that he's doing better amen we want to continue to pray for him and if anybody feels led to help in the support for the medical uh there's a need there as as you are well aware amen that's been written all right let's stand together one other thing i do would like to say about the telegram the telegram was set up not as any kind of social media i i i don't think we're going to go wrong by not by leaving it just for the information that's being given across we all have something to say about everything that's being said whether it's a prayer request hey i want that person to know i'm praying if it's a testimony we want to say you know praise the lord and i'm as guilty as anybody else here but what happens is i think it begins to get stretched and stretched and stretched and then boom something is said that you know just wasn't appropriate and the way i like to try to do it is when i hear something whether it's a prayer request or a testimony i'll send something directly to that person that's good and it it lets them know where you stand you're you're you're praying for them and that's i think that's that's an order but i'd like to try to keep keep it away from the the just the social media thing where everybody's just talking is uh uh uh about it and and again opening the door for something maybe that wasn't quite as edifying is everybody with me on that have you have you witnessed that and seen that i'm not the only one that would be feeling this well hope but i'm thankful for communication i'm thankful for the testimonies and the prayer they let me know i need to get praying right away or to rejoice um and and i'd like to us to to respect that i believe keep it as holy and pure as possible amen amen well turn with me if you would to the book of philippians and we're going to be speaking on part two of the living word is among us and we had part one before brother aaron was there and he preached two amazing services the first one no filter and i believe the lord was speaking to us just to be real be genuine be who you are don't don't don't need to to try to put on anything and then the second message invert always in very so a little sign that we had in our office about always inverting look at things differently if you always think the way you've always thought you're always going to get the same result the bible says be not conform to this world be not conformed to the way that the devil wants us to think but be transformed by the way by renewing your mind by a different way of thinking and that's what our brother brought out i should say that's what the lord brought out to our brother amen and uh i i believe it was just like the icing in the middle of a double stuffed oreo and we're gonna we had part one of the living word is among us and now we're gonna have part two the living words and i believe he the lord just inserted that there the word is with us and i believe god wants us to grow in confidence and just be ourselves and let the word change us because if we just hear a good word and we feel good about it but we don't begin to apply these things in our lives we will never change so we got that hard part to do and that's allow the word to change us amen let's before we begin reading here in verse 1 of uh philippians chapter one let's look to the author our heavenly father lord redeemer today great privilege to be in the kingdom of god we thank you for the day that you you turned our lives around you washed us of our sins you took away our past but today lord we know that we've come short of your glory lord we ask if there be any unbelief amongst us any wrong anything that's displeasing we just ask that you forgive us at this time that you cover us with your blood lord we want to be showered with your holy spirit today bless each and every heart prepare us for this word lord we're not worthy to look upon it for it is a holy word and we're not holy our eyes are not right lord but you can make them right lord you can make a heart right we want to be more like you lord we know that you've called us to this we pray father that you'd give us the revelation of the very intent of you bringing this message to us lord and help us lord that we might have more confidence in you today in this hour that we're living we commit this service and every need now into your hands pray that you'd be with those that are not here those that are live streaming lord we pray a special blessing on our sister kathleen and our sister donna lord those uh lord who are struggling or remember brother roger lord we just pray that you strengthen your bride we love you we thank you for this now for we ask it all in jesus christ's name amen amen philippians chapter one starting with verse number one paul and timotheus the servants of jesus christ to all the saints in jesus christ which are at philippi now i want us all to believe that we're in philippi today with the bishops and the deacons grace be unto you in peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ i thank my god upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which had begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ amen god bless you may be seated until the return of jesus christ to take us home the holy ghost is going to execute the work that he started in us we know we've begun a good work in us we all can testify of that but too many people are only satisfied with the forgiveness that they've gotten and not concerned about coming to the statue of a perfect man right it's not as big as concern as the initial i i want my sins washed away too many people have lost the interest in god's intentions of why he even started the work in us he wants to finish it amen ephesians chapter 5 verse 26 says that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word see the word is living enough to wash us it's alive enough to sanctify us to get us ready to be his wife verse 27 that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that it should be holy and without blemish now this is the finished work and we're still here we're still hearing the word so the word is still doing the work now if it was just as simple as well i pray that god would forgive me and it should be done then there would be no need to come and hear the word there'd be no purpose in the word there'd be no purpose in the word washing us but there is a great purpose in the word we have to become one with the word we need to remain confident that the living word is among us every time we set foot in this room it's just not uh some man trying to teach about god it's a living word we heard that we heard that through brother brother aaron the word that that came forth that was the living word and now we got to take that living word and we've got to apply it to our personal lives because the word spoken to us it may help us to tell us something about our past so maybe we might understand it when the word is being preached and the word may tell us about something about our future right but the word is to help us presently and it's us it's about us entering into it and recognizing it amen if there's ever been an hour that our confidence is being tried it's the hour that we're living in today the world is being shaken a great snare the bible says in the last days jesus said men's hearts would be failing for fear right spiritually it is the darkest hour that we've ever been in the most wicked hour the most deceitful hour and satan knows he has but a short time so he's just like ramping it up he's ramping it up the church is being shaken right along with heaven and earth but to the elect they stay humble they remain fortified prayed up building themselves up in the most holy faith because this is what we need to overcome continuing in the things which they have heard and learned and has been assured of of knowing whom thou has learned them the bride knows that her husband is the one that's bringing the word to her she knows where the word's coming from and she has a revelation that the living word is amongst her why were the disciples so bothered because the living word was leaving them right right but he's promised i'm gonna i'm gonna come unto you i'm gonna be with you in the form of the holy spirit and we need to believe the word is amongst us that when we hear the word we become one with that word and we'll have faith for whatever it is that's going on in our life because we have to overcome now no matter how much bad news is floating around the bride is remaining confident that the living word is going to see her through to the rapture she is remaining rapture ready she's remaining rapture ready i'd love to preach a message on that sometime when we come to church we must have a greater expectation not just a slight expectation but we must build this i mean a brother ron he'd get up and he'd say you know i'm i'm getting excited about the new church kind of ramp it up for the new church when we enter in it's like it's like an expectation and if we believe the rapture is right around the corner and we believe that we're ready there should be an expectation david said one thing i've desired that why i seek after that may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life he knew god would be there he promised to be there and we need to come with a greater expectation that it's him not man talking about god i know the enemy would like to present his way of looking at church but we must recognize god in the word come on somebody's i need some i don't need some amen but i need you to believe this we must recognize christ is speaking to us personally amen we must understand what it is that he wants us to do with what he's speaking he needs to be more real to us i'm sure it in our lives are personalized we wish that we would recognize god a little bit more amen amen and i think we need to just give him that reverence and respect in his house i made a statement recently in a message planting your potatoes god is alive and our relationship with christ needs to be pulsating with instructions from jesus we need to be hearing what it is that he's speaking amen you know brother brahman says uh we can make him an iron boy i just want jesus for that what about coming to church i need to know what you want me to do lord amen in other words your relationship needs to be hearing from god it's got to start from hearing from god and finally we must follow through with obedience to the living word amen keep it living inside don't let there become some sort of disconnect from what god said and you not following through then it becomes the vein our faith becomes vain our going to church becomes vain it is our responsibility now one of the things that can really shape believers is when they witness somebody else missing the mark it can really rattle someone it can even deflate them can even lose confidence in the lord not knowing what to believe i thought they were elect i thought they were closer to god than that we spend too much time judging in our thoughts who's elect and who's on that just because someone is elect it doesn't mean they're not going to fail they're not going to let you down it doesn't mean they're not going to make some major blunders doesn't mean they're not going to get out of line what it does mean is that they're going to hear the messenger say get back in line when they hear what god says they're going to do it that's what it means there's the difference you don't take it lightly now if i am going to view you today by whether you're alive or you're sleeping now we got this message the living word is amongst us how about having a living bride amongst us let's get let's get into the word i don't think we realize we don't we put too much confidence in a man too much confidence in other people and really not enough confidence in god right i'm not talking about in the ministry because this this ministry is of god amen it is a living word amen and you may question it you may doubt it you may think you have to dissect it and you may not even think it's for you but i guarantee this god is in his word giving it to his bride that is for sure any everything else i could question but either god's in it or he's not because if you have to sit here and dissect everything we need to get into the spirit of what's really supposed to be going on in the message it seems like people want you to put confidence in them when you're talking to them right it almost seems like they're they're looking for you to put confidence in them and really we should be putting confidence in the word in the message of the hour and what god is speaking and amplifying that it's better to trust the lord than put confidence in man that's what the bible says so despite what our brother and sister does or doesn't do god wants our confidence to be in christ amen no matter what happens to be assured that the living word is always among us regardless of what happens now we're told by paul that we should follow him as he followed christ but amen don't always want to be following a human being we don't want to follow brother clifford's example when he was walking on the road to emmaus saying but we trusted i had this experience with christ before but now i'm not trusting we must hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end amen the living word is amongst us he's not going to leave us god will never let you down man will no doubt about it but god doesn't we must learn this every one of us here every man is prone to lies pride arrogancy fail failures shortcomings you will see them and satan will make sure to it that you see them but god wants you to remain confident in him amen amen not man put your trust in the lord if god ever shows you something about somebody just pray for them i'll say i'm going to go a step further if satan ever shows you something about somebody pray for them let god know where you stand don't you ever listen to the devil and say oh yeah i knew it i knew it all along right now don't become a judge of thoughts god has not made us to be naked of a negative bride a positive bride to move forward when jesus said lo i am with you always to the end of the world we need to believe it that is with us to the end not until i did trust i don't want that testimony i want the testimony of my trust it doesn't matter if i failed it doesn't matter who fails what matters is i trust the living word is amongst us i believe he's here not in some dead formality either but a living word now the holy ghost is the living word amen think about that the holy ghost is the living word that's why it's important to get connected with the living word and not just a dead letter not just some words written in here it needs to become real to us now he's here to continue the work he started inside of us and we need to remain confident or convinced of this very thing that he which had begun a good uh a good work will execute it or fulfill the work that he started until the day of jesus christ he's just continuing that's what our excitement should be when we come to church that god is going to work in us god's intentions are to build our character it's the only thing that we can take with us to heaven our intentions might be to build a great to empire some life to build uh something that we want down here but god's intentions is to build our character now since character is not a gift but it's a victory decisions need to be made by you when you're in the middle of your trials amen that's why it's important when we come here that we hear personally from god we ought to walk out of here every one of us and say this is what god spoke to me i don't know what he spoke to you but this is what god spoke to me and if we're not there we need to be praying constantly god i want to hear from you i want to hear from you or coming to churches in vain amen it's made to be a living word philippians chapter 2 verse 12. so god speaking the word speaking to us on the inside you know when god speaks to my heart no one else in the world no one else in the world or in the room may even catch it that's how personal it is god don't want to blabber everything right that he's doing with you right it's personal that's what makes it so beautiful amen philippians chapter 2 verse 12 wherefore my beloved as you've always obeyed not my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god which worketh in you in you both to execute his will to will and to do of his good pleasure that's what he's interested in amen he's interested in you doing what he wants you to do so when you come to church and you're hearing the word being preached and it may not feel always uh you know good do all things without murmuring and disputings don't just say well i guess i gotta do it i'll do it but you know my heart's not in it do it without murmuring do it without disputings why that ye may be blameless it's okay when god tells you to stop doing this or start doing this it's okay there's nothing wrong with it you still will be blameless if you do what he says but if you stop to murmur you stop to complain you are not blameless amen that's right that ye may be blameless and harmless like you're not afraid that that person can hurt you blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation or we got one of those don't we among whom you shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither labored in vain it's the end result that god is looking at he sees this as the finished result he tells us i'm going to give you an expected end what we need to do is just do our part in the middle do as he tells us to do so when we come to church we come to hear from god and when we hear from god our faith grows right but we need to hear god speak to us personally that's the only way we're going to get faith if we just hear outwardly and we say yeah i agree with it no faith is going to come from that we've got to desperately get in tune with him so like the two men that came out of them a message that brother branham was preaching and one come out and he said that preacher called me a a chicken or a buzzard maybe both i don't know and the other one is are you serious he called me an eagle same message right just where the heart is at where's that what are you going to believe you've got to believe your bride and the real evidence is you take the word and you do it you follow it you live it you come back to church and instead of talking about everything else you talk about what god did for you in your home the things that are changing in your life that you're becoming more in his image that's what the word is for that's what church is about faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god it's god speaking to us personally and not collectively right not collectively he just he's not going to give us a revelation collectively brother branson says god deals with the gentiles as individuals so we we sit in church we hear all the same word but everybody obviously everybody's heart is not in the same spot and the best thing we could do is get good ground just get good ground that the word fall on good ground amen this is important brother brahm said god is not obligated to give you anything more if you haven't walked in the light that he's already given you i want you to think about this statement for a moment why would god withhold back giving you some more light when he wants you to walk in the light when he wants you to to walk in the fullness like why would he says you know i'm not going to give him anything more can you imagine giving your child the the job of taking out the garbage don't want to do it but you're going to hand the keys to your car so we can see god isn't just going to keep giving us new information just because we come to church well he may give us new information but he's not going to give us more revelation we've got to walk in the light as he is in the light and then we have fellowship with the lord amen god wants to see us love him first with the first light that he gave us if you love me keep my commandments so when he gives us something to do we've got to start expressing our love to god in the message the way to have fellowship brother graham says the only way he can have faith is to have love first he love produces faith so it's really important when we come to church that we're coming with love we all come to church we want faith we want the word to give us faith we want to we want to build ourselves from that faith we wanted that preaching to give us faith but you know what we need to have love for that word we need to have love for that word in order for it to produce faith amen i want you to ask yourself the question when you come to church are you coming why are you coming are you coming with the fear of the lord are you coming to please the lord that you just you want to hear from him what he wants you to do and that you are really dedicated to go out and doing it no matter what he says are you coming to work out your salvation or do you have it sold up in a bag are you coming with fear and trembling i could be wrong about things see i i don't think we could come humble enough to church i don't think we could come broken enough we all want to come and we want god to bless us we want him to encourage us and strengthen us lift us up but too often our spirits are proud and how can god deal with that right amen unwilling to humble ourselves so how can we expect faith to get a hold and grow in our lives when that love isn't there so we've got to to be willing to let go of that old nature that's kind of been standing in the way of of of the love relationship because it it's it's not about it's not about getting information to make a rapture it's about a love relationship this whole thing everything from the moment that god taught you what he had in mind was a love relationship when we get to heaven you know a lot of times people especially now in this age people look at relationships so much different than god does in other words you you you live together and you just you you take advantage of the other person whatever you get out of them right that's it and people are satisfied going through life like that it's the truth but god is not interested in that he wants her heart and so it's part of the relationship from the time that he calls you to the time that we go on the rapture it's all going to be about relationship right that's true so everything that you hear god's going to be streaming at your heart yeah you may not feel like doing it may be hard for your flesh but it's the living word is amongst us and he's calling us up higher to do that because if you follow that god may bless you with just something greater amen and we just never know what god will do amen but the scripture says i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble truth to revive the heart of the contrite ones so he doesn't dwell with the needy that's not what the scripture says we all got needs the whole world's got needs but he dwells with the humble and that's what we need to become we need just to knock that spirit of pride off of us say get it behind get off me satan get behind me saying get out of my thought get out of my mind amen amen and just submit yourself humbly to the word of god god will bless you for that always put your love for god first when you enter the doors put your love for god first prove the sincerity of your love for god by laying aside everything until you get perfect love amen i'm sure there's things in my life that i got last sight is there things in your life that you need light aside okay it's hard to lay those things aside that's why they're still there so what we need to do is be executing lord i need your help actually executing the humility that god wants to see in this he said i dwell with the humble with the broken with the contrite the whole world is broken they're just getting harder and harder but they're not humble in this house before the lord that's the difference the same son that made pharaoh hard as a rock humbled moses it may take 40 years you might have to work with somebody with a hot tempered yeah notice i didn't say you know husband or wife but reality god is working on our character amen we must remain confident despite whatever the lord says to us in church remain confident the living word is amongst us and now sometimes we can get so much in the flesh that oh i don't like what's being said or we might just do a cold formal amen either way our hearts not in it and our heart needs to get into it because this whole thing is between you and god any between you and the church between you and john martin it's between you and god most of the time i'll be honest with you i have no idea what god's doing brother john i don't think i want to stand and listen to you as a pastor tell me you don't know what's going on well i'm sorry i'm not building the church god don't have to answer to me the more we get the more we come to the conclusion i'm just going to do what he tells me to do and not try to figure things out the better this train is going to get down the track the faster we're going to get to the statue of a perfect man we must remain confident for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure so do everything that he tells you to do without murmurings without disputing we ought to be rejoicing in the fact that the living word is amongst us it's okay that he he brought something up to my heart and i'll be honest with you i never ever ever ever ever ever ever for a billion years would never want to know anything that god brings up to another human being in my life i never want to be aware of it i don't now if god uses us that's fine but i don't know about it it's it's an individual affair good or bad it's individual it's between god and you hebrews chapter 13 verse 5 says hebrews chapter 13 verse 5 let your conversation be without i want and be content with such things as you have if you're content with what you have it's easy for you to obey it's easy to lay aside everything and get perfect love there's too much i'm not content it's true that's why you got so many people going from church to church trying this one trying that one there's just no confidence that god is with them despite imperfections in a church it's true well i don't agree with this i don't agree with that i don't think there's a church in the world that's as perfect as you think it ought to be but when you can anchor that your will god told you to be when you can bloom where you're planted right god may be using you there for just one soul be content with such things as you have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee so it doesn't matter what you're going through so we may boldly say the lord is my helper i will not fear what man shall do unto me i'm not afraid of some human being failing right in front of me that's not going to affect me i'm not going to be moved it's better to have confidence in the lord it's better to trust the lord and put your confidence in man i will boldly say the living word is amongst us we need to boldly say i'm going to meet god when i come to church that i believe the living wordism i can boldly say that isn't not john martin can you boldly say that can you boldly say uh that wasn't aaron preaching that was god when you're listening to those tapes can you boldly say that is not brother branham that's god that's god in a man called william branham but the voice it's the voice of god it's the spirit whatever words that god uses whatever instrument god uses is god still speaking you need to have confidence in that god don't want you to be thinking it's a man ever why that he's got to lower himself to share his glory with man god's not going to do that if this whole thing is god it's god in you it's god and your brothers god and your sister it's god in you i will remain confident of this very thing that he which had begun a good work in me will execute it until the day of jesus christ verse seven so remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow consider the end of their conversation so do you see the life of christ on display in somebody's life because this is what's matter it doesn't matter how many it doesn't matter can i pick on you for just a second it doesn't matter if brother mark says jesus christ is with me consider the end of brother mark conversation yes consider the life that he's living because hebrews 13 8 says that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the word is the same so if an angel or a minister or anybody come preaching any other gospel than what's already been preached let him be accursed now i've heard from two different sources here just here of late how much of a wrong spirit there has been in this message maybe saying the same words but with the different agendas and to me when i first heard the prophet there was a spirit that came with that word a spirit and we need the spirit of this message amen not just the words or what we think is the revelation but the true revelation is going to be manifested in the spirit in which it was brought amen god is the same amen and we need to be performing the same devotion to god the same word same laying down your life one for another amen do whatever you got to do whatever whatever god tells you to do you just do it amen this is important as we are becoming more bold to believe and to say that the living word is among us we must also bear in mind that our brothers and our sisters are still human they're they're still building their relationship with the lord right so they're going to make mistakes they're going to fall they're going to that doesn't mean that the living war is not amongst us because we see it so maintain the balance and i think that's what jesus was trying to tell us he says you know why are you so worried about your brother's fault when you've got a like a much huger problem in your life much huger take care of your problem and then you'll know how to take care of it it doesn't mean you know what that really means when you take care of your problem you will be so gracious in helping your brother you will know how to wash their feet it doesn't mean you'll know how to poke them in the eye and prove that they're so wrong but you'll be able to live that that life of of christ with the spirit of meekness so don't be moved don't be bothered when you see your sister or your brother falter in the days to come don't be moved remain confident god's still with us doesn't mean well that happened behind the pulpit it doesn't matter it doesn't matter you know the flesh can get in there anytime that's why we need to pray for the ministry amen amen we need we need to pray a hedge of protection around this this this this is the heart of why we come you know we're this it's really not the man right because god's got a five-fold ministry but it's really this god using the vessels of the fivefold ministry to bring us the word amen so we need to continue praying one for another we're always prone to fail one another but the living word will never fail us we can have confidence in god's word it's not about me it's not even about having to prove that god is with me it's not about having to prove anybody anything it's about you believing that god is with you right in church that the living word is among us and that it is going to speak to us what it wants it may not be what we want to hear how many times let me ask you a question you that come to church and you just really really want to hear god talk to you about something how many times did you ever sit down with your child to correct them about something and your child stood up and said this is not what i want you to talk to me about right it doesn't matter what you'd want me to talk to you about i'm talking to you about what i see [Music] and god is allowed to come here and be god he's the potter we're the clay so we got to get our eyes off of well this is john this is god this is jud have confidence in god it's about your maturity and believing in god joshua and caleb remained confident that the living word was among them through 45 years of a church that was so messed up that the majority of the people were make believers they believe god part way can you imagine being a church for 45 years with people who would not take god all the way but they remain confident that god was with them despite where everybody else was the children of israel were led by god a pillar of fire by night and a cloud by day the bible says the pillar went before them and behind them in other words the word was all around them they the the living word was among them they were eating the living manna daily they were drinking from the spiritual living rock of christ that followed them the bible says the bible tells us that when the children of israel came out of egypt they came out of egypt as a mixed group some were unbelievers a whole lot of them were borderline believers and a few of them were full gospel full-time continue in the word all the way believers that's the mixed group now when joshua and caleb got up there and they said we're more than able to take the land it was spoken to everybody but it was only received by those who believed it think about that despite the living word was among them they were not in one mind and one accord they were they were mixed up about the situation the bible says god said i heard the cry on my people and i have come down to deliver them now this is why they were still in egypt now god remained faithful despite of their unfaithfulness and we learned in jude chapter one verse five i will therefore put you in remembrance though you once learned this how that the lord having saved the people of the land of egypt afterwards he destroyed them that believed not now these were the unbelievers and the borderline believers now the thing about a borderline believer they believe all the way up to the receiving of the holy ghost if i could say it like this all the way up to the complete nature change amen because justification is a part of the holy ghost soul is sanctification but the believer goes all the way to a nature change amen i'll say send the light we must continue in this word until our nature is completely changed hunger to hear what god wants you to do because it's your obedience that's going to bring the nature change draw nigh to god he draws nigh to you you obedient to this one little thing that really doesn't have anything to do what you think is really important has everything to do with god blessing you with a nature change life was too hard for the international borderline believers that what most people would think most people would think it's just uh too hard to go on to the promise that god had had brought him to now see see when god called him out of egypt god called them to a promised land i will give you a land but it's you know they came out that's all they really wanted they just wanted satan off their back honestly but they weren't interested and go all the way to christ and this i just say this as a church we need to be interested in what god has for us he wants our nature change we have a chance every single day to live for him just a little closer a little bit more of a change i don't know what it is that god wants you to do i am not your conscience you don't know what god wants me to do you're not my conscience but god speaks to you and you know what god wants you to do and that's what we want to focus on what happens to a lot of people when they face their trials they get all caught up in the flesh they begin to murmur complain i'll tell you what they did they murmured against moses turn with me to exodus chapter 17. exodus chapter 17. so we this word is to help us that's why this word is here now all the congregation starting with verse 1 exodus chapter 17 all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys according to the commandment of the lord and they pitched in referendum and there was no water for the people to drink you ever come to church and you just like well it just doesn't seem the spirit doesn't seem to be moving wherefore the people did chide with the leadership and said give us water that we may drink and moses said unto them why tie ye with me wherefore do you tempt the lord and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against moses and said wherefore is it that thou has brought us up out of egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst and moses cried unto the lord and said what shall i do unto this people they be almost ready to stone me he was a man that helped him there was nothing he was the meekest man in the whole earth wouldn't do anything to hurt anybody and and they wanted to stone him and the lord said unto moses go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of israel and thy rod wherewith thou smoldest the river and take in thy hand and go behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock of orb and thou shall smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and the moses did so on the side of the elders of israel and he called the name of that place messe and miraba because of the chiding of the children of israel and because they tempted the lord now look at this saying is the lord among us or not what happens when we come to church and because we don't feel the spirit we don't see things moving the way we like we don't we begin to is the lord among us do you see how easy it is to get in the same place as these children were that's why we need to be so focused i can't wait to get to the house of the lord because i know when i get there the lord will be among us he promised to be where two or three are gathered together in his name nothing about feelings nothing about emotions not about how good your day was how bad your week was nothing matters it only matters i'm going to meet the lord it's just me and the lord that's why you know too much talking about this that or the other gets you off track you know the devil would do anything to distract you from the word lord help us never to question amen we we as a church we need to stop doubting stop questioning remain confident that the living word is among us he's going to finish the work that he started joshua and canada remain confident of this very thing that he which brought them out of egypt was going to take them into the promised land and we have to remain confident that he brought us out of the world and he's going to bring us to a complete nature change that i will be able to go through that child and i will be able to manifest christ in that trial amen now give an excuse not saying it's for another day not saying it can't happen but believe because there's spirits that want to tell you that you'll never live it right amen that's from the pit of hell that is strictly from the pit of hell you've got to believe that's why jesus said if thou can't believe all things are possible i'll tell you in this hour the bible tells us that we should be coming to church all the more as we see the day approaching all the more we should be injured all the more we should be telling other people come and hear the truth amen well they're going to turn me down it doesn't matter amen what matters is what we're doing an expression back to god and offering to god it's not just about your worship here it's about your worship out here amen numbers chapter 14 verse 22 because all those men there was something different about joshua and caleb because all those men which had seen my glory and my miracles which i did in egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice now notice they seen the miracles in egypt they seen the miracles in church but because they didn't hearken to the voice surely they shall not see the land which i swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoke me see it but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him what kind of spirit was it had followed me fully him well i bring him to the land where unto he went and his seed shall possess it now that is a spiritual seed so the the message here is god wants us to follow him fully amen so just because we don't we're not excited about the word that's being preached hey this is the word that we need to follow fully you got we can't have all double stuff orioles you know but no nevertheless we must hearken to the word we must follow the word we must obey the word we don't want to be a three-quarter believer why be a three-quarter believer and say well you know look at that he's only a half believer fully believe fully believe challenge yourself do you fully believe what does god want you to do just just follow it don't step away don't not think about it don't let it go just lord show me that one part i love you that much lord your faith will grow we need men today to stand up we need men to stand up and say i'm a believer and i'm following this word fully i'm giving everything i got that's what we need we need men and we need women to stand up and say i'm going to believe the word more today than i did yesterday because i heard more of the word today not just be satisfied with church attendance and going home and think well i did my duty today god is not happy with that that's not the relationship he's going to have with his bride his bride will be building character god is among us amen my sheep hear my voice and they follow me first corinthians chapter 10 verse 1 moreover brother and i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed under the sea we're all baptized with mo unto moses and in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat all drank the same spiritual drink for they drink of the spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now i just wonder how many of this is the bible says many of them god was not well pleased does that mean god came down to every one of them individually and said listen john martin listen bob smith listen ted armstrong i'm not pleased with you is that what that scripture means no it means moses gave the word but they didn't believe it we can't expect god to come to us individually all the time and say this about the situation the word this we're taught by the prophet that this is the judgment seat of christ and that the word comes forth and the word is there to get us ready i that's what here's what's so beautiful i never ever ever ever ever ever ever want to know what god speaks to anybody it's just none of my business i do not like going up to and telling somebody i mean you have to you have to if god tells you but it just seems that people are so caught up sometimes in the devil they can't listen to but let's let's look at why these things are written and did all drink the same spiritual drink and did all all that and for they drank that spiritual rock that followed them that rock was christ for with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent that we should not desire the wrong things as they also did now i want us to ask the questions are we being overthrown in life are our trials taking us away from god or are they drawn us near god have we considered going backwards have we began to want the wrong things have we murmured against leadership these are these are good questions amen are we questioning whether the word the living word is among us are we questioning it i don't want a question i want to doubt my doubts i don't want to doubt the lord we have a rock in this weird land we don't want to stumble at the word we need to humble ourself under the mighty hand of god and get into that rock hide in that rock stand upon that rock because the living word is among us turn with me if you would to first peter chapter 2. just as christ was hid in the simplicity back then and they didn't recognize christ christ is among us he's hiding in the simplicity of the word that's how powerful the word is and i how many times you've heard me say i wish there was just a curtain here you couldn't see my face you wouldn't get distracted that you would just hear the word first peter chapter 2 verse 5 says he also has lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ the more you're built up the more you ought to be offering up spiritual sacrifices if you come in the church and just say i don't feel like it what kind of sacrifice are you going to offer god you've got to come i want to give god my very best i don't care how i feel i just want to give him my very best he deserves the very best wherefore also it is contained in the scriptures behold a lie in zion a chief cornerstone he's elect he's precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded now unto you therefore which believe the word that believe the word he is precious but unto them that be disobedient to the word the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and look it's being defined as a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them that stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed oh my my you know i remember going in school slightly i remember it's not that great but when i was very little going into like kindergarten in first grade and coming to this building that i never been before and seeing all these signs and all these kids in these classrooms and names on the outside i just didn't know where to go i felt so scared and like out of place i was wondering where i was being appointed to i don't want to be appointed to be disobedient i want to be appointed to be obedient to the word of god the same word that builds up the believer to the statue of a perfect man stumbles the borderline believer he gets offended at growing up in the word he doesn't want to follow the harder way he chooses the path of self-will the same word that builds the confidence in the believer becomes a rock of offense to the borderline believer say to the bride here remain confident saints the living word is among us he may be hiding in simplicity in this word but he's here among us but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him that caught you out of darkness into his marvelous light every time god speaks to us he's speaking to him of his marvelous light he wants us to walk in it we ought to be praising god for it not getting offended he's calling us higher his word is ministering to us in entrance how to get into the rapture amen wow we think well this doesn't this this message isn't on the rapture this doesn't seem to be giving me faith for the rapture it's ministering an entrance into your promise today the same word that ministered in entrance in the promised land for joshua and caleb became a stumbling stone for the borderline believer remember the word did not profit them because it wasn't mixed with faith when they heard it god used the ministry of the children of israel for an entrance into the promised land but what happened they stumbled at the steps to get in i want you to catch this they stumbled at the steps to get in they did not want to walk up those seven steps of perfection right they weren't interested in becoming to the statue of a perfect man they were just completely satisfied with being saved that they were out of egypt that everything was okay now their focus was on other things but i say don't stumble at the word that god is giving us those are the steps to enter into that entrance the living word is among us turn with me if you would to second peter chapter one verse 10. second peter chapter one verse and i want you to i those of you that say but this is a long service i want i want to say something i want you to be happy right now because i am passing up so many notes first peter chapter 1 verse 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling an election a sure thing for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly think about that abundantly into everlasting to the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ the living word is among us it's ministering to us in entrance to enter into the image of christ amen to being able to live the life that that's what it's about it's not about saying we're in the message we've got a great church it's not about that it's about coming in and being able to live the life in front of your brother living for yourself live in front of your neighbor live in front of your family live the life of christ that's what he's calling us to amen well brother john i feel i am come come what else am i missing lord come to church with what else am i missing lord until you got everybody in the world telling you have you seen john martin i don't see him have you seen mark i don't see him all i see is christ until everybody just sees jesus in you i'm sure there's more for us to have amen remain confident of this very thing that he which have become a good working he's going to fish it don't stop don't get lazy don't say it's not a big deal if i don't come not a big deal if i don't receive have the fear of the lord leave church with something that you didn't have don't put it on the ministry don't put it on the songs don't put it on the music don't put it on your feelings put it on your face put it on your face let your faith take you there i believe god is here regardless of what my feelings may say about the situation first john chapter 3 verse 1 behold what manner of love the father bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not so there's no surprise there beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not at this point yet appear what we shall be but we know we do know that when he appears we're going to be like him we're going to be able to see him correctly you know the life that we are living basically is the revelation that we have of god i want you to think about that the life that we're living today is the revelation that we have of god now what i'm doing is i'm calling to get you to live higher how many people have you heard this is going to happen this is going to happen this is going to happen i if i could go back whether they were in the message or not in the message i had so many people tell me they were going to go on a rapture and they're not even living anymore but you know they could be the ones caught up you know first they're part of the rapture i suppose but you understand what i'm saying it's not go by what we know let's go by what we're living what we had victory with this past week let that be our our our our testimony build off of that and stay away from what we know just get away from it get about what we're living are we laying down our life for somebody are we testifying are we are we witnessing to some soul that don't know christ are we trying to bring them in are we laying our life down for the brethren are we coming to church believing that the living word is among us are we just coming to church because it's church hoping to get something out of it lord help us amen every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure amen there's the process right there romans chapter 8 we have to hurry verse 18 for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time your suffering that you're going through is not worthy to be compared with what's going to be manifest in your life just focus on christ in you the hope of glory if you can believe christ is here when we come to church you'll have a lot more faith going through the trials in your home that christ is with you there is this a short little testimony uh but brother marty had uh sent us a little uh testimony he was telling about the situation about sister kathleen and how that afib uh started up and boy it's a that afib is like it's a it's a pretty common thing out there um there's a lot of people have it i was i was reading about it but um he's in the car taking her to uh getting ready to take her to the hospital and just said a word of prayer and it stopped and what came back what and that's what the living word is for amen for god to be with us when we need is a very present help in a time of need and we've got to believe that he's here you want to see him more believe more come pray more come dedicate yourself more amen it's not just you know come to church a few more minutes early spend time at home praying that when church does come you can bring christ with you i'll say to you that really believe that christ isn't here bring him with you bring him with you that he will be here well i think that that pastor needs a little bit more of holy ghost good pray for me lay hands on me i want it i need it i'm not going to stop it let's stand together god bless you there are so many so many wonderful scriptures hebrews chapter 3 verse 14 for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end being confident of this one thing he would started this in you years ago he's going to be working with you on a regular basis until it's finished so we we got the beginning when he called us we got the end but can we see him in the middle amen god is among us amen praise the lord so many scriptures so many incidences in the bible where people had showed confidence if you just read the book of hebrews chapter 11 you'll see many many examples of faith and i just wanted i just if i could just be like a little bit in god's economy just you know two words you know john martin barely made it or something i'll be happy but there won't be anybody that makes it that doesn't remain confident that's how important the message is remain confident it can't be just words but in your heart when when you're being tested just come to the forefront i believe i'm gonna pray this prayer of faith if it don't work keep praying keep believing don't allow the devil to minister and say well it didn't happen that just doesn't mean anything brother brandon said if he prayed for a thousand people nothing happened he'd go on praying for the next one believing you have to remain confident we don't have to explain everything we just have to believe the word amen let's go to our lord in prayer maybe there'll be someone here today that say brother john would you add me to the prayer today i want to build my confidence i want to remain confident i see things have slipped a little bit maybe maybe there's someone that uh you've allowed something to come in your life and maybe someone stumbled stumbled fell and and and it's it's really bothered you amen god sees your your heart god sees amen god he's touched by the feelings of our affirmatives amen amen god cares about every one of us amen let's believe with all of our heart heavenly father we come to you as a body amen lord we know you deal with us as individuals but there's something about it when those individuals get in one mind and one accord and they believe in the almighty god to come and move in their midst lord we pray that you would fill us with such holy ghost that nothing could shake us nothing could shake us lord from the work that you started in us we know that you're going to finish it lord we can all we all could just stand and we'd all go not just tell of those that have somebody has gotten off the track somewhere and uh have have have just kind of quit along the way but lord you placed something within us that can never go back lord we can never even look back like lot's wife lord but we're marching
