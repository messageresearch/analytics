precious name we pray amen amen praise the lord god bless you turn with me if you would to the book of saint john chapter 10 for opening scriptures and then we're going to read a few scriptures there and have you be seated how many enjoyed the service sunday what a wonderful service we had very very provoking amen to good works that is amen well we want to have a little bible study tonight on god's voice god's voice and we're just going to read a few verses here starting with verse number one jesus speaking verily verily i say unto you he that enterth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber but he then entereth into the door by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and he leadeth them out and when he put them forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him and they know his voice amen god bless you may be seated i want have to stand for all these scriptures here but i want to continue reading all 29 verses here maybe we could just have one more word of prayer amen heavenly father lord as we come before you once again lord we ask you to take these thoughts that you've laid on our heart today lord these scriptures that we will be digging into that you would help us to recognize your voice a little bit more clear that's our motive and our objective we pray that you'd come and bring the increase now and give us revelation of your word we pray in jesus name amen amen i want to continue to read this and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them then said jesus unto them verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but to steal and to kill and to destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep but he that is a hireling but he that is a hireling and not the shepherd whose own the sheep are not seeth the wolf coming leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep the hireling fleeth because he is a hireling and careth not for the sheep i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and i am known of mine as the father knoweth me even so no i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there and there shall be one foe and one shepherd therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it up again and no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lie it down i have power to take it again this commandment that i received of my father there was divisions therefore among the jews for the same many of them said he have a devil and is mad why hear him and others they are not the words of him that have a devil can the devil open the eyes of the blind now notice there's lots of one voices being spoken but it's being perceived in different ways and it was at jerusalem that the feast of the dedication was a winner and jesus walked into the temple in solomon's porch and then came the jews round about him and said to him how long does that make us to doubt if thou be the christ tell us plainly and jesus answered i've told you and you believe that the works that i do in my father's name they bear witness of me but you believe not because you're not i'm a sheep ye are not of my sheep as i said unto you my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish shoney man plucked them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand amen i want to stop right there i know i read those kind of fast but i got a lot of stuff i want to talk about today i want to get um just a lot of voices in the land there's so much confusion in the world today and it's getting worse and worse the confusion is getting greater and greater it's a non-stop uh everybody's got a voice they want to be heard and it doesn't matter if it's right or wrong i thought the world was insane before we're taught that the physical realm types the spiritual realm and there's so many voices even in the spiritual realm maybe we don't always discern or recognize each of them but these voices all stem from two trees it's either the power of god or the power of satan even though there's lots of voices lots of things lots of opinions lots of stuff going on the the sources of what voices that we're hearing are coming from one or two sources now we know that god is not the author of confusion his voice is one voice it will never contradict this word now if i don't say everything that i want to say because i don't think i'm going to be able to i want to say this we always refer to the voice of god as something we just heard something that just kind of spoke to me and we put emphasis on that that little thing that he spoke and i'm not against that at all but we have put such little emphasis on this right here this needs to become the greater emphasis because we know that this voice is correct this voice that i hear over here may or may not now just be honest with you how many times have you heard something you thought it was god speaking to you but you found out later that it wasn't many many many many times all of us but why have we put so little emphasis and i should learn from that now i believe that god the voice that that we ought to be following is this voice there's so much in here i can't keep up with it but this doesn't seem to interest us as much as you follow what i'm saying now god wants us to be faithful to this more than anything this what will bring us through this other stuff that that isn't here well there's a way to handle that there's a way to handle that just like all dreams all prophecies are handled the prophet taught us that god interprets his word by bringing it to past now this word must become manifested inside of me the voice of god is speaking to us to manifest this word that's what's important to god there ain't nothing more the devil would like to to get us to do to confuse us just like we read in the scripture today there was always a division when jesus spoke well it wasn't what jesus was saying amen it was what those voices were telling all those people when jesus was saying it right that's where the confusion came it was the other voices because god's voice is ya and amen it's one voice it's the word of god it can't change it can't move and i understand the the the time you know there's things that god has spoke to me and it has come to pass there's things that i thought god spoke to me that did not come to pass and the voices are so close i don't believe god expects me to stand here and make a decision whether what he spoke was him or not if it's him he'll bring it to pass if it's not it won't come to pass now this is so important that we focus on getting more of god's voice from the word of god brother brandon made it real clear now if i told you god spoke to me and he told me these five things are going to happen you would think i was spiritual right right a lot of people go they go for that but understand this brother brent says if you want to be more spiritual read your bible and pray because this is the voice of god stay with that that's how you become spiritual jesus is the door that opens eternal life everybody wants to live forever he said i come that i might have i i come that they may have life and that they may have it more abundantly jesus is the door he's the way he's the truth he's the life and no man can come unto the father but by him so jesus is that door where we can come to our heavenly father and receive revelation of the word of god to receive the living word he holds the key that unlocks the very life of the word in other words we read it but it's not unlocked it's it's a written word the letter killeth that's why brother brown didn't say just read he said read your bible and pray and read your bible because we need jesus to unlock the word that we're reading to unlock it to us to show us what it really means because we're saying would you tell us plainly what does this mean tell me plainly that when this when you fall in love with this word i'll say the written word when i'm saying the written word because god can speak to all of our hearts not in this word and it's just as much the word as when he is this word because it's his voice and he's alive and he can speak anytime but the thing is we need to put more emphasis on this more emphasis on this because this is sure and amen god sent a prophet to tell us that this word is just the same yesterday today and forever i want us to be focusing on god speaking to us through the word amen just like we should be hearing his voice more in service yes god can speak to us outside of service but don't be a little the path that god has made for us that is right that's why he said for satan at the assembly and all the laws we see the day approaching because we have to get ready well i'm already saved see what i'm saying we can get so twisted off in those voices out there now the first thing in our reading today in this great chapter chapter 10 jesus describes the person who doesn't come to the door as a thief and as a robber well the very first thing amazing webster's dictionary defines the thief is one that steals especially secretly a thief is someone who takes something that doesn't belong to him now this is the first thing that jesus is talking about he unlawfully takes something that doesn't belong to him a robber is one that uses violence and force to take something away and if you've been watched any of the news out there uh you you'll see that they're they're they they loot they they go in there they rob places and they use violence to to take it to be a good example robert will use some sort of threats like uh he'll he'll come in with the cashier and how to hold them up and say you better give me everything you got where a thief never has to meet their victim they stole like they stole the bracelet when no one was looking now here jesus says that's all that ever came before me these are the two characteristics that come before christ and jesus describes these individuals as wanting to be a thief or they're a thief in the robber and it's a very large group he says in verse 8 john 10 verse 8 all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers what a strong message jesus is telling us all a strong message all that ever came before me they're just thieves they're just robbers what are they trying to rob and steal from god that's right they're trying to steal life eternal life because he is the door to get there but you know what it could be a whole host of things too people like to use god for a lot of things now god is a good god and he wants to bless everyone even his enemies he's rich in mercy he's full of grace god is a god of perfect love for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son god wants to give eternal life to this large group of people that wants eternal life so what's the big deal jesus said come unto me all ye that labor and heavy laden and i will give you rest what's the big deal why doesn't god just give it to them it's because they're unwilling to take god's yoke what does that mean brother john they want eternal life while they have their selfish nature they want to live forever while being self-centered and self-serving and i and i it's all about me they want eternal life without being born again without the new birth they want eternal life without a nature change from self to it's all about god second corinthians 5 17 says therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature o thinks you're passed away behold all things have become new and all things are of god all things are of god amen so this is the hang-up all that come before the lord are thieves and robbers they want my somehow i got some extra pages in here again how did that happen all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers i remember when i came to know my sinful condition i really wanted to escape hell i was afraid of hell i didn't want to go to hell like the song that we sing it was grace that taught my heart to fear but it was also grace my fears relieved but then i began to bargain with god for cheryl i'm a thief and a robber i just didn't come to god and say god i'll surrender everything take me and i'm not going to ask one thing no i wanted to hang out in my long hair my records i was hanging on everything i could and if you're honest with yourself you can see what jesus means my flesh wanted to give up the least amount that it had to to gain salvation i wasn't interested in these things that god was wanting me to do i want to give up my music you don't know how much money and time i spent in it it was my selfish life but i still wanted salvation i still wanted to be forgiven giving up anything short of your entire temporal life for his eternal life would be an absolute insult to god it would be a slap in his face we should all be thanking god that he turned his cheek towards us a number of times when we slapped him he turned his cheek again to us and gave us another chance because we don't want to give up everything jesus would consider anyone a thief or a robber who would climb up some other way than surrendering their complete will over to him philippians chapter 3 verse 7 paul said but what things were gained to me i counted loss for christ yay doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and you count them but dung in order for me to gain eternal life which is really jesus christ he had to give up his life for god's life it wasn't a special calling everybody has to do that if we don't surrender all how is jesus going to view you and me because we're always asking for things we're always wanting things he just he just wants us to surrender amen surrender to this word my sheep hear my voice and follow me jesus is the door and behind the door is eternal life he's the good shepherd he holds the keys of eternal life he said in verse 27 my sheep hear my voice i know them and they follow me and i will give unto them eternal life he's leading us to eternal life why would he got it potentially yes potentially your son potentially always where but potentially you got to endure to the end you got to take all the scriptures that's why we need to study to show ourself approval so those other voices don't say well you've already saved you do what you want to do now his voice is his word amen and jesus said my words are spirit and their life so his voice catch this his voice is spirit in their life the very voice of god that's why we need to really hear from god when the preacher is preaching that we're not hearing from a man this thing is deteriorating excuse me i didn't know that was going to happen we got new equipment coming soon peter testified thou alone has the words of eternal life jesus gave peter the keys of the kingdom and we find out matthew chapter 16 verse 19 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you loosen her shall be loosed in heaven and peter began to exercise his authority three verses later when he rebuked the words of eternal life now peter didn't really receive the keys that very moment did he nor the following week or the following month god is not going to hand over the keys of eternal life to someone who doesn't have control brother bran said power without character to use that power correctly is satanic can you imagine peter having the keys with his selfish nature oh no jesus you're not going to cross you and i wouldn't be saved today if peter would have exercised his power with the keys that he had with his selfish nature without being born again jesus would have never went to the cross he's not going to hand over just here it is with the selfish nature we need to get serious about this more than just hearing these things out here come on amen peter's great idea would have kept jesus from dying peter did not have a vision beyond himself too often we make jesus all about us instead of living for others jesus was about living for others but peter wasn't amen when eve did her own will she did exactly what satan was taught her to do eve had eternal life but she was enticed to do her own will at the same time and when she did she forfeited her right to eternal life god put flaming swords to protect the way of eternal life while exercising her own will above god's will think about it before it was no problem you could hey here's the tree of life you just do whatever you want i'm here for you but as soon as she exercised her own will above god's will she no longer had right to the tree of life i want you to think about that how much god hates our will we've got to deny ourself amen pick up our cross and follow christ follow my sheep know my voice and they follow me let's take a look at this in genesis chapter 2 verse 9. genesis chapter 2 verse 9 and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that was pleasant to sight and good for food notice these were natural trees because you could see them they were good for sight these were natural trees the tree of life also was in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil now these were invisible trees you couldn't see these the tree of knowledge of good and evil is a spiritual tree that has the knowledge of what is good and right and pleasing to god yet chooses to do its own will instead that is that simple which will always be evil in the sight of god this is the real mix of the tree it's the knowledge of good but choosing not to do it that's called evil now the nature of this this tree is selfish obviously just by the the very fact that you do what you want to do instead i will exalt my throne above the throne of god i will be like the most high i will do my will above god's will i i i that's what this tree is and you know we're all born with this nature headed straight to hell our first birth had nothing to do with god oh yeah but god knew about it before the foundation of the world you know we'll talk about that we'll talk about being predestinated but our first birth had nothing to do with god he just knew about it that's why we have to be born again amen born according to the way god wants us born we were born to do the will of god we were born to hear his voice and follow him ephesians chapter 2 verse 3 we all had our conversations in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind we're by look at nature the children of children of wrath even as others what causes a child or even an adult to stir up wrath in their nature what is it come on simple exactly when you don't get what you want you're going to get upset about it not getting what a person really wants bad will cause them to get angry and we've got a whole world full of it just turn on the news it won't be just a few minutes turn on the tv look at the billboards i we went up north and we had heard from a few different restaurants how the people were so rude in various restaurants we heard this from the the way staff of the people is a common thing right now well we know hatred is is is going to increase but wrath comes about when you don't get what you want jesus said unless we become born again with a totally opposite nature we can enter the kingdom in other words we cannot enter the kingdom with this nature we can't be a thief and a robber when paul finally surrendered to the lord he didn't say i want this back i want this in return here's my want list we all have this want list we just need to get rid of it the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he is the good shepherd and and look we all got this battle look i'm preaching to me the lord is preaching to me we've it's a it's a a tremendous battle we we all have it but we stand in the way we we can't get by with a slightly different improved nature it's a nature change where all things are passed away behold all things have become god they become new they become of god it's no longer just going from one frying pan to the next that could be new but they have to be of god where it's no longer our will but god's will first peter chapter 1 verse 22 seeing he have purified how do you do this brother john seeing that you purified your souls how do i do that real simple in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love to the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently so this is this is so so simple yet so important take time to read your bible every day with this purpose lord show me what you want me to obey today amen we we think we already read it i already got it i need something new stay with the simplicity of making contact with god when you read the bible yes amen it worked for abraham it worked for brother branham he told us to do it stay with the word being born again not of a corruptible seed but of incorruptible by by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever so every day you you sincerely read that bible and you pray and you say lord speak to me i want to follow it you know what and you and he speaks something to you oh i've never seen that before i or you've seen that before and he's reminded you and he wants you to start doing maybe haven't been doing it the simplicity of you obeying that is the process of you becoming born again your nature changes slowly day by day drop by job all of a sudden things change in your life but if you don't yield to that you're looking always for this out here this wonderful splash in front of everybody may not happen all right let's get back to genesis here genesis chapter 2 verse 9 and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that was pleasant to sight good for food and the tree of life also was in the mid cigar in the tree of knowledge of good and evil verse 5 said that there was no man to till the ground okay so he made the garden but there was no man to till it the ground still needs to be tilled it would have been hard for brother mike and my wife and sister ann to uh actually plant the garden if it didn't get tilled it has a tendency of getting hard verse 15 and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it so he tilled it dress it keep it that was his job and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the god thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day thou eatest there thou shall surely die through all the times that satan had talked to eve he never told eve the consequences of what would happen to her if if she part if she partook of him in fact he lied about it and he said thou shalt not surely die and that's how these false spirits speak to us thou shall not surely die you don't you can do whatever you want to it's just a preacher's opinion you don't have to listen you can act any way you want you can say whatever you want to say you can do whatever you want to do and don't you worry you're still a son and daughter of god and that's how he gets us off track he takes us away from the fear of god my sheep know my voice and they follow me the importance of this word it needs to mean more to us it needs to become like our gold knox everything that we've worked for everything that we labor for everything that means so much to us that's what this word needs to become jesus said in saint john chapter 10 verse 4 and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice verse 5 and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers when somebody says something well ask that you know don't bait that's a strange voice well i don't need to do strange voice if the word says it i i recognize that voice i follow that voice we've got to take time to recognize that these things that we're hearing whether they're in our minds our imaginations our thoughts i don't care how it comes because we know as our brother said sunday that satan's coming with lying wonders right so of all the things that satan has set on the bible says the throne of god as if he is god the temple of god excuse me the temple of god second thessalonians 2 well this could be considered a temple sits in the temple showing himself as he's god but this also could be a temple i don't know what's talking about the antichrist but hear me it's the spirit is the same thing he's trying to gain control he's trying to act like he's god and how does he do it oh you don't got to do that you don't gotta you can just do whatever you want to do it's okay if you cut your hair it's okay if you wear makeup it's okay if you say those things look at those things do this it doesn't matter you'll be fine you're still you're still predestinated it's a wrong voice because there's two voices in reality in reality stemming from two voices one will be completely the word the other voices will always be mixed with part of the word that's how he got eve he did not come to eve and say your god is completely out of the wacko no in fact you're going to be just like the guy you believe in maybe just like him you know he he just he's just hold this back for this moment but once you just you know partake of me then you're going to be just like him knowing good and evil but god doesn't want us to know evil we're the ones that want to know evil we're the ones that want to feel this enticement the ones that want to feel i'm going to get so mad at her at him i'm going to show them i'm going to just i'm never going to talk to them again partake of that evil but that should be a strange voice to the right strange voice just because you're a child of god doesn't mean you won't end up listening to the devil sometime thinking it was god just because you're the elect of god doesn't mean you won't end up following the devil for a while and not even know it just because you're marching to the song of onward christian soldiers marching as to war doesn't mean you won't get out of step doesn't mean you won't get sidetracked it doesn't mean you won't forget about your calling your responsibilities or your ministry of reconciliation that god has given every one of us we can backslide we can become carnal proud selfish and not even recognize it just because we are his child doesn't mean we're never going to be deceived for a period of time matthew 24 24 for there shall rise false christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much as if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect we get tripped up and we may get tripped up a lot more but the truth will always find us and set us free he won't leave us in that condition when he the spirit of truth come he will guide you into all truth he jesus told pilate everyone that is of truth heareth my voice we will eventually hear the voice and if we are his sheep it's real easy we just follow it we follow the word of god the sheep of god follow the word of god it's not about well i'm so special i will never get deceived it doesn't matter what doctrine they throw at me i can figure it out i'm gonna know that ain't what he's talking about friends how well can you follow this word amen you know the thing is we're not even interested and making sure we're following the word that's true we get to a place where we're assuming we follow it and we ought to be seeking god more and more and more making sure turning over every rock lord am i pleasing you am i doing the right thing amen because in this laodicean spirit we don't think things matter very much but they do the serpent beguiled eve amen but what does that mean that mean that word begotten means led astray the serpent led her astray the tree of knowledge mentally deluded her mentally diluted her through the serpent he misled her mind the serpent seduced her that means persuaded her to be disobedient without knowing it thought was doing the right thing now it's no different than what the devil does say to each of us every day tries to get us to think that we don't have to do what the word tells us to do we may get begotted by a spirit that has the knowledge of truth and it will entice us it would tell us that it's not necessary to follow everything but the spirit of truth will show us will bring us back and will make us obey the word if we are his sheep because the word cannot lie my sheep know my voice and they will follow me it's got to come back to that god will not allow his own elect to stay in a condition of air so it's not about every time we fall we must not be elect i'm sorry don't you ever think that a righteous man falls seven times seven times get back up when peter asked jesus how many times do i need to you know forgive this person seven times if if if jesus was so sold on the doctrine of uh well you know we're just predestined if they fall seven times they must not be my sheep they're not following me they must be of the devil you know just you know forget after seven no no seven times seventy just live the life live the life when uh when a person be overtaking the fault you which are spiritual go to him in the spirit of meekness and fear it god is still restoring his bride amen and think about i'll be honest all the time that god has spoke to you something to do and you didn't do it but yet you'll still say i'm a child of god i'm predestined i'm the bride you'll stand firm on that but then your brother or sister will do something wrong and you'll begin to question whether they're seed or not that is not right we're all on the same ship god will send the spirit of truth to always correct the air always john 16 verse 12 i have yet many things to say unto you but you can't even handle it you can't you can't bear it you can't carry it it's too heavy for you how be it when you receive more of the spirit of god it's called the spirit of truth he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come i'll talk a little bit about that when the holy ghost is leading you he will not be leading you to you to do your will he will not testify of you not to do your own thing it's not about you it's an it's it's about christ it's all about the will of god first john chapter four verse one first john chapter four verse one we went through this with a a series not long ago beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits where they are of god because many false prophets are going out to the world what are these spirits doing they're trying to get you tripped up they're trying to get us astray lead us astray from obeying the word just like you did eve hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus has come in the flesh is of god the only way that john would testify that something was of god is when the word became manifested in the flesh and until that happens we don't know yet are you with me well what about what about this these this woman that came talking about paul this damn soul talking about paul these these be the men of god they preached us to the way of salvation they're teaching us over and over and over coming out of their mouth speaking the truth but it wasn't manifested in their flesh their spirit was not of god no ye despair try the spirit that's what paul did every spirit that won't manifest the word in flesh is not of god see the devils believe they know they tremble they certainly have the knowledge of the truth it's undeniable the reason that they tremble is they don't have enough love in their heart to obey the word and that sets every one of us we hear the word of god and we don't love god enough to obey it what does that show it doesn't matter what we claim it's all about following the word follow the word follow the word we don't follow the word by just coming to church or saying them in the message there's a lot of word in there and all you gotta do is take time to look at your life they know it the devils know they're religious enough to know the word they even have a form of it but they deny the power to live it and we're told turn away from it strangers they don't know that voice they stay away from that they don't mix with that they don't want that a part of them i'll say run to calvary and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is coming the flesh is not of god and this is the spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and now already is in the world your god little children have overcome them because something is greater that's in you that's god than he that's in the world and thereof the world therefore they speak of the world and the world heareth them but not god's sheep a stranger though not follow we are of god we know that god heareth us and that he that is not of god hearth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of air in of every voice that ever speaks to you it's either a spirit of truth or it's a spirit of air every voice the inspiration is coming from one or two trees it is and if i um told brother mark brother mark you're gonna get a brand new cadillac tomorrow it is just saying the lord it's gonna happen i know god told me he told me to tell you it's gonna happen well two days go by and the car's not there i think at this point brother mark is going to question me he's going to question me because there's an heir there now he would look at me a little bit like are you with me and he has every right to but when the devil has come to him and spoke to him something that he thought was god and it didn't happen do you see what i'm trying to say we brush off the things we think are of god and when we find out they're not but we just have a standoffish look when somebody else has done the same thing what we need to do is be interested in the things that we thought were of god and that we're not we need to be interested in that we need to be concerned about that because we're taught to try the spirit no i'm not going to probably have time to preach everything i really want to preach here and i'm sorry because there's a lot of good stuff in this world it's a teaching there are so many things that god speaks to us that is not in that word or we think there's a lot of things that god speaks to us that's not a network but i could say safely that god does speak to us things that are not in the word and we have no way to prove it there's just no way so what do we do well we know it if it's in the word it's a good sign right but if it's not written right there in the word exactly to detail what we're talking about we don't know it may be like the other things that satan told me that didn't come to pass and i thought they were oh god now remember when god he's when i was driving down the road and i've shared this many times and he told me that there was going to be a building my business was going to be right there in the middle of a field well i never told my wife i never told my pastor but i watched him bring it to pass without a loan and nobody gave me anything except god now that i can't find that in the word but i never felt this pull to let everybody know it was a secret very good god wanted to prove himself to me that's good he wanted to build my relationship with him he wanted me to have confidence in him amen you can't give that to anybody but something like that there was no way i could prove it no way no matter what i said i couldn't prove it i had to wait for it to come to pass and just he interpreted his word by bringing it to pass now say that stuff doesn't happen all the time i'm going to say this stuff doesn't happen very often he speaks it's not like that all the time that's right what he does speak every day is to follow this word that he's been trying to get across to us this means more to him i don't mean it wrong but it means more to him than trusted tool trusted two is his word not against it but understand the emphasis needs to be here he's speaking to us this word to pray for one another to to reach out to others to to forgive others to to help others it's really good to pray to read to get ready he's coming soon this is what's important that trusted tool is a tool isn't that funny he's using it in many different ways oh i'd love to testify god's voice is his word it will not return void it will accomplish the purpose it was spoken when he said let there be light let there be anything rest assured it's going to happen because he spoke it you can bank on it and then sometimes he speaks if thou doest well won't thou be accepted in other words god ain't going to deny his word if you do well you're going to be accepted but if you don't then sin lieth at the door well what sin sin is james said to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it's sin so it's important to do what we know to do i'll tell you our hands should be so full of that anything funny we shouldn't be swimming in more knowledge we need to be swimming and trying to keep up with doing what god has already showed us we're talking about really following the voice of god that we know is concrete because i don't know if truster 2 is going to be concrete i can't find it in there i don't know i gotta wait for him to bring it to pass but this word has already been vindicated we know to follow it we had a prophet come and ex break it down to us what it meant we need to follow it to a t it means to mean so much to us this is where we need to shine our light is look at me i'm the word on this word you can i can show you i'm a written epistle run of all man this is what i'm doing it's not trusted tool that's just personal you and god of course you pray for trusted too and i i pray for you and pray for one another's personal things but we need to go to seed on the word god's voice is not always going to be this thing is going to happen to you i understand the bible says the spirit will show you things to come and just like i testify to the business he showed me something to come but it's not always like that he may show you that something else is going to come like you may get persecuted persecution's on your way for taking a stand for the word he may show you that you're going to go through some hard trials he may show you that you're going to walk alone for a bit he may show you that you're going to get cold and formal if you don't pray through he may show you that you're going to lose your joy and your peace if you hold on to grudges god can show us a lot of things these things that that he shows us help are to help us to become better that's the purpose my sheep hear my voice i know them and they follow me the purpose of hearing the shepherd's voice is to follow what he says so number one we must know the difference between the voices we hear one is going to be completely scriptural the other one is going to be mixed now there are going to be those times you're going to have a business well i can't find it in the scriptures leave it there for the future leave it there watch and bring it to pass that's good well nobody's gonna know they're gonna think i i believed at the beginning it's not for everybody this is between you and god god showed you if god wanted me to be shown he'd show me pray to hear not just what you want to hear i'm looking for this it's wonderful but we need to be looking for this this is what we need to be interested show your interest to god with this don't come to church while i've already got that i already know i already believe the word priority that's why we're not getting what we need to be getting out of the message because we're coming too proud right we want to hear something new something different brother branham when you're going to get job off those ash heaps pray to hear what the spirit is saying to the church we're all sitting here we all hear the word every time it's being preached but everybody is not where you're at and if some people are falling asleep and some people can't wait till the service is over and and some people are not interested in what's being said and some people say they already know that make sure you're the one that says i'm the church and that word is for me because if you want to find favor with god stay with the word don't say your your purpose here is in vain because of x thousands of reasons sometimes god's going to see if we're going to move the bricks move the brakes what's the purpose move the bricks and move them without complaining move them without questioning me i want to tell you i don't know what my future is but the bible says that the good steps of the righteous are ordered of the lord that that he ordains the footsteps of the righteous i don't have to worry about it he's doing it i just got to fold this word he'll make sure that other things happen number two we have to obey what he says to us when we finally hear the voice of god we've got to obey it that otherwise we'll never follow christ the voice of god is the word of god we love to hear the voice of god speak to us about the things we want the things we desire the things we even think we need but the voice of god goes beyond what we desire to what the will of god is for our life the voice of god is the mind of god to us it's his word for us personally that's what i was trying to say when the word is being preached you must take this it's for you for you in other words if nobody else was here in church but you this is how much this word is for you now you're showing god what kind of relationship you're having with him in church why you're while you're here remember all that ever came before him were extremely selfish in their desires but not you not you you've learned i just want to do his will they didn't believe in coming to god to do his will they just wanted to escape damnation they just want to bargain with god oh god i'll serve you if you give me cheryl i'm so glad that god has brought that and kept that in my memory that's a thief and a robber all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers they're so recognizing they don't think about it and sometimes we we can come into church and make god some santa claus that's a thief and a robber just want god for our personal lives how about our personal lives doing what this written word says you know you want to be in the will of god i got one sure thing that will keep you in the will of god because brother branham said it's always in the will of god adventure often other things i can't say examples i just want to talk a little bit about examples of god's now this is a bible study this is allowed to go a little bit longer right all right those of you that you know don't like this idea you're you're welcome to leave but there may be someone that this is they love this there's different ways that god could speak to us and one way that we really enjoy is when god says i love you that he died for us that he's rich in mercy god loves us unconditionally but the same god that loves us conditionally un unconditionally loves our enemies and we do not mind hearing that god loves us and we're predestined we're we're we're part of the this message and we're gonna make a rapture and these are all wonderful things that we want to hear but that same voice says love your enemy that same voice says lay down your life for your brother your sister pray for them have a burden for them to go out look for my lost sheep to deny your will that same voice says deny your will and we've got to be willing to follow that as well as god is rich in mercy full of grace full of love for me we want to rejoice in all those things we want to say praise the lord well why don't we say praise the lord i'm going to live for my enemies i'm going to love man i'm going to bring shows in i'm going to die out i'm not going to do my will anymore praise the lord because it's still god's word it's still his voice see we begin to smorgasbord the message the service that's coming why we're going to say amen certain times to the word but not other times i like certain preachers but not as much as others the word is the word i'm thankful for god coming and loving me but that's all he did for me and he never said hey you got a chance to love me oh why do i do it lord how do i do it keep my commandments and i'm going to come and i'm going to speak them to you and i want you to read every day i want you to pray and i'm going to show you my commandments and as you do i'm going to quicken things to your heart and pretty soon you're going to get up and you know you're going to say you know what i can't just do what i want to do today because god spoke to me i got to go do this you're a chance to prove your love now for god so that voice goes beyond just how much god loves us cares for us it goes to a place i want you to be just like me you're my son you're my daughter i want you in my image i want you acting like me i want you being like me i want you washing one another's feet he's calling us to where we're not so of course it's uncomfortable of course it's going to seem like we're suffering of course it's not going to be enjoyable to our flesh but we don't believe in having sermons that are enjoyable to the flesh that'll never get us to heaven that'll make us feel good while we're down here on earth but it won't help us to get there turn with me if you would to joshua chapter one joshua chapter one you know we can sit in church and we can hear um uh scriptures being quoted and they may be scriptures like i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you in the palm of my hand um i'm with you and we can take those scriptures and we can apply them to only our selfish life like brother john what else would they be there for god don't only want us to be strong while we're going through our trials and courageous to to fight for what's ours but he wants us to be strong to follow all the word and it just depends how where we're at when we're listening to the word whether we're in the spirit or in our selfish nature joshua chapter 1 verse 7 only be thou strong and very courageous well that sounds encouraging right but he says that thou mayest observed to do all that i told you to do now that that's that takes courage come on now that that takes courage we got to go we got to go home and we got to get serious about being strong and be courageous to do all the word don't turn from the right hand to the left that thou mayest prosper whoever so thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate about day and night that thou mayest observed to do all that is written therein amen for them thou shalt make the way thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success this word is important for your life i understand that those other things out there that is just between you and god are wonderful beautiful and i say praise god for them but god has called us to follow this word we need to put the emphasis on this more emphasis on this and then he says in verse 9 have not i commanded you be strong be of good courage be not afraid be thou not dismayed for the lord thy god is with you wheresoever thou goest and we can take that scripture and we can just apply it to our own life about the trial that we're going through with our neighbor because you know they put the weeds on our property and it bothered me and i got upset and i'm just going to go over there and be strong and courageous and i'm not going to let them do that anymore you know we can apply the word any way we want to but god wants us to get real strong about this word he wants us to wear this word live this word amen and not be satisfied with the word that we are living but get interested in the part of the word that we're not living when you read that bible look for what you're not doing look for the parts that he's wanting to bring us up in we're not robbers we're not thieves we've been born to serve god we've been born to serve his will to follow whatsoever things that he has commanded us jesus said all things whatsoever he has commanded that's what we're supposed to teach that's what we're supposed to follow we've been called to serve the lord we've been predestined we've been elected we've been chosen to fulfill god's will and this is more important to god that i do this then trusted two that i know that was of god that's right we need to put our emphasis here trusted too is going to fail god giveth god taketh away heaven earth's going to pass away but my word will never pass away we need to put the emphasis on what's important to god we've been born to do the will of god to follow his will which is written right here it's real easy if the bible says that that that we shouldn't we should gossip we shouldn't slander we should well israel simple we just don't do that and that's the voice of god speaking well you know maybe it didn't come to you personally like you did trust it too maybe it wasn't that personal but when you read it it needs to be that person because that's what god means it to you he doesn't have to speak everything to us personally out of this come on we're not all called to be malachi 4 5 and 6 there was only one we have to believe what he said we have to believe what jesus spoke and if we take it as if he spoke it just to us do you see what that does in your relationship with god that just that just takes god's heart and he's so full of love because it means something to you his word means something to you amen let's stand together thank you for your patience i say to the bride the groom wants us to unite with his word to unite with it not in a way of i'm more united i already said i would i know that i'm not talking about that i'm talking about getting interested to know his voice more if you read the word of god more you will hear the voice of god more you also become more spiritual somebody wants that amen let's go to to the lord in prayer heavenly father we thank you for the written word of god that is your word there's no doubts and no questions when we read it that you're speaking it to whomsoever will for many are called but few are chosen lord thank you for choosing us it's by your grace lord that we've accepted you and accepted your word and accepted this message lord i pray tonight to each one that's here each one that's perhaps listening i pray that every one of us would have a greater vision a greater burden and a greater desire to get into the word as much as they are familiar with it as much as they know it lord you're still opening the same scriptures to us decades years later you're still unveiling who you are you still have a voice in that word and lord i pray that you would help us to grow in this word to grow that we can say i read in the bible this is god's voice to me speaking and i decided to follow it we could be as you testified that your sheep were my sheep hear my voice and they follow they follow me they follow my word lord we don't want to be of of a sheep count ourselves as your sheep and not follow your word but we want to follow it god i pray that you would us lord for the times that we just have missed you not our desire none of our desires to miss you lord lord teach us to say thy will be done teach us to allow you to show us by bringing things to pass help us to focus on the one thing that we can lord you've given it into our hands to follow your word to become more like your word and we know that this is an absolute i pray that you'd bless this little church with manifesting the word of god in this hour our hands are so full lord we have so much to do so much to manifest god we need your grace to be able to do it and i pray that you would bless each every one lord each one that has this desire to focus on this word lord i pray that you bless them abundantly give them great revelation we thank you for these things lord we humbly commit ourselves to you as a body lord we want to grow with you we give you the praise and honor for these things we ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you let's sing it with
