[32:24] amen
[32:26] um
[32:26] i want to thank you for your prayers for
[32:30] the new church and for the
[32:32] getting the
[32:33] occupancy permit
[32:35] um
[32:36] there are some things
[32:38] that
[32:38] we need to change
[32:40] um like the the door handles instead of
[32:43] being around like this they have to be
[32:44] levers
[32:46] and
[32:47] because it has to be ada
[32:50] compliant
[32:51] so even though the real good door
[32:52] handles that we got right now
[32:54] to change them
[32:56] and there's
[32:58] like 16 doors so there's quite a few
[33:00] doors that have to be changed
[33:03] um we have to change one of the toilets
[33:06] because we got to get the toilet handle
[33:08] on the other side and
[33:12] just in case and so
[33:14] we're going to do it
[33:16] and
[33:17] we'll do whatever we got to do
[33:19] and we're thankful honestly that we
[33:21] don't have to do more than what we have
[33:23] to do
[33:25] but it may delay and if we may not get
[33:27] in
[33:28] shall we say to the first week maybe of
[33:30] next month so we may have one more
[33:33] prayer meeting here but that'd be okay
[33:36] amen so i want to say thank you thank
[33:39] you for your prayers i
[33:40] believe in them
[33:42] amen i think when brother ron snuck in
[33:44] he didn't know i was there but i was
[33:46] there when he snuck in to see the place
[33:50] we had a whole boatload of people there
[33:52] working
[33:54] but we're thankful for everybody that's
[33:56] been attached in some way and i'll say
[33:58] it like this you've all been attached to
[34:00] prayer amen
[34:02] yeah so thank you
[34:04] um it is a great honor and a great
[34:07] privilege to have brother george smith
[34:09] with us
[34:13] it is
[34:15] really impossible to know
[34:18] all that brother george is doing
[34:21] because he's helping so many people in
[34:25] so many areas
[34:28] for so long
[34:30] but just know that when you're praying
[34:33] for brother george
[34:36] and you're giving
[34:38] for the missions for brother george
[34:42] that it's
[34:44] it's helping somebody
[34:46] somewhere amen
[34:48] amen and uh he's helping in areas that
[34:54] that and i'll just say you can see god
[34:57] orchestrating
[34:58] his missionaries because they don't all
[35:00] do the same thing go to the same places
[35:03] and all
[35:04] you know help the same person
[35:06] and um i want you just to get behind
[35:10] what our brother tells us today
[35:12] and and just ask god to open the vision
[35:15] help you to see more so when you are
[35:18] praying it isn't just you're in a room
[35:20] that's dark and doesn't seem like the
[35:22] words are going
[35:24] past the ceiling but that there's
[35:26] they're going to be affecting someone
[35:28] out there somewhere around the world
[35:31] we uh
[35:32] we appreciate brother george and that
[35:35] he's just so down to earth
[35:37] and um
[35:39] we just we
[35:41] love them and look up to him and pray
[35:44] that you're blessed this morning let's
[35:46] sing only believe as our brother comes
[35:48] to give us the word of life amen
[35:51] [Music]
[35:58] believe
[36:01] all things are possible
[36:06] only
[36:07] believe
[36:11] [Music]
[36:18] all things are possible
[36:22] only
[36:27] [Music]
[36:34] god bless you may be seated
[36:36] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[36:37] again today
[36:39] and know that he's with us
[36:41] yeah we've had a
[36:43] a restful time here in michigan
[36:46] they didn't put me to work
[36:48] but i'm not leaving until tomorrow so
[36:50] who knows
[36:52] but anyway brother john has done his
[36:54] best to uh make him comfortable
[36:56] and uh you know even the dog loves me so
[37:01] that's a lot right there
[37:02] but this morning having the one service
[37:04] we're going to
[37:06] uh take our time and and try to say
[37:09] something be a blessing to everybody
[37:12] you can't remember at all that's why
[37:13] we're making a
[37:14] you know dvd back there take it home
[37:16] chew on it some more
[37:18] but it's good to uh
[37:20] be in michigan in this time of the year
[37:21] when the weather's pleasant
[37:24] i've been here other times and you know
[37:26] but god makes us you know he makes us
[37:30] to where we can just be flexible
[37:32] yeah i'm not a fair-weather missionary
[37:35] so if you have your bible
[37:37] let's turn into psalms 143
[37:42] just for a few
[37:44] places here to get our our bearings for
[37:46] this morning's service
[37:48] the title today is my will or god's will
[37:50] yeah let's stand together as we read the
[37:51] scripture
[37:53] psalm 143 and verse 8
[37:56] where the word says
[37:58] uh 143 yesterdays
[38:01] cause me to hear thy loving kindness in
[38:03] the morning for in thee do i trust
[38:06] cause me to know the way wherein i
[38:08] should walk
[38:10] for i lift up my soul unto thee
[38:12] deliver me o lord from my enemies
[38:15] i flee into thee to hide me
[38:18] teach me
[38:20] so teaching means we've got to pay
[38:22] attention
[38:23] teach me to do thy will
[38:25] for thou art my god thy spirit is good
[38:28] lead me into the land of
[38:31] uprightness
[38:32] quicken me o lord for thy name's sake
[38:35] for thy righteousness sake bring my soul
[38:37] out of trouble
[38:39] and of thy mercy
[38:41] cut off
[38:42] my enemies and destroy them that afflict
[38:45] me that afflict my soul for i am thy
[38:48] servant
[38:50] now a few pages to the right we have
[38:52] proverbs 14
[38:55] proverbs 14 and verse 12
[38:59] where the word tells us there's a way
[39:00] which seemeth right unto a man
[39:03] but the way thereof
[39:05] are the ways of death
[39:08] so your way might not be the best way
[39:11] you know we
[39:12] nobody wants to go to hell we try to do
[39:14] right but we need to find god's will
[39:17] now way over farther we find the book of
[39:20] jonah
[39:22] it's a little ways before malachi
[39:25] one of the minor prophets here
[39:27] and we can hopefully learn something
[39:29] from
[39:30] brother jonah this morning
[39:34] jonah chapter 1
[39:36] and verse 1
[39:38] now the word of the lord came unto jonah
[39:40] the son of amitai saying arise go to
[39:44] nineveh that great city and cry against
[39:46] it for their wickedness is come up
[39:48] before me
[39:50] heavenly father we thank you for your
[39:52] mercy today we thank you that you've
[39:55] woke us up there's many people
[39:57] never got out of bed today they went
[39:59] straight to the mortuary thank you lord
[40:01] that you've put a will in us to be
[40:03] together to fellowship to worship you to
[40:05] pray to sing
[40:07] and lord to sit under the sound of the
[40:08] gospel one more time
[40:10] bless your people here today bless those
[40:12] that might hear it later on the on the
[40:13] dvd or whatever lord we're in your uh
[40:17] stead here we're trying to say what is
[40:19] right bless your people help us in jesus
[40:21] name amen
[40:23] maybe seated
[40:25] so
[40:27] what we have here our scene is jonah was
[40:30] an israelite okay he was a jew and he
[40:33] lived in a little town called geth
[40:35] hepper
[40:36] just north of nazareth up in galilee
[40:39] and he was the first foreign missionary
[40:42] now if you doubt anything i said well
[40:44] write on a piece of paper and give it to
[40:47] john he'll give you the answer but
[40:49] we have done some research and we we uh
[40:51] we try to speak what's true so he's the
[40:53] first foreign missionary and in the new
[40:56] testament that's called an apostle it's
[40:58] one that is sent out
[41:00] and even our prophet said that's the
[41:02] highest calling you know when the the
[41:04] callings in ephesians 4 11 doesn't start
[41:06] with prophet surprise surprise
[41:08] starts with missionary
[41:10] okay
[41:11] our prophet says in the message end time
[41:14] in 1954 i believe every christian is
[41:17] obligated now not so much that you have
[41:19] to go over to the old country and preach
[41:21] but if you can't go you can help
[41:23] somebody else to go
[41:26] now see i'm saying things that you guys
[41:27] have heard for years because this is the
[41:29] only church i know of it's called send
[41:31] the light tabernacle and you're
[41:33] interested in getting the light over
[41:34] there the dark places
[41:36] so we're just
[41:38] reviewing a few things he says everybody
[41:40] should hear the gospel at least once
[41:42] okay i want to do my part he says
[41:45] there's something about missionary work
[41:46] that i just love it and just to know
[41:48] that what you're doing comma you're
[41:51] doing god's will when you're giving to
[41:53] missions amen in other words you can't
[41:55] go wrong
[41:57] so
[41:58] missionary work isn't so much traveling
[42:00] you know way far away um
[42:02] you know where they don't speak your
[42:03] language and eat some food that doesn't
[42:06] you know you can't identify it and so
[42:08] forth
[42:09] uh you know now they do have kfc in most
[42:12] places in fact we were over in africa
[42:14] several years ago and my son was with me
[42:16] and
[42:17] and they had bought some kfc and i'm
[42:19] brought to the
[42:20] dinner
[42:21] and we were enjoying it
[42:23] and these poor people you know they just
[42:24] didn't know they said well do they have
[42:26] that or where you live
[42:28] yeah colonel sanders right down the road
[42:30] there
[42:31] so
[42:32] it isn't a matter of going you know just
[42:34] roughing it as such but missionary work
[42:37] is living for others right here
[42:40] now we assume because everybody's got a
[42:42] bottle in their house that
[42:44] they
[42:45] they know what's going on oh that's not
[42:47] true
[42:48] no no people don't have a clue sometimes
[42:51] so everybody wants eternal life
[42:53] all the catholic nuns want eternal life
[42:56] all the people from salt lake want
[42:57] eternal life
[42:58] and
[42:59] no one's no one wants to be uh
[43:02] eternally separated from god you know
[43:04] and they all want to go to heaven
[43:07] they just don't want to go today
[43:10] put it off you know yeah so um the
[43:13] scripture says in proverbs 28 29 18
[43:16] without a vision the people perish
[43:19] but with the vision with the missionary
[43:22] vision we're living for others you know
[43:24] we we we see farther away
[43:27] and we're not trying to make everybody
[43:29] you know a reader of william branham no
[43:31] just trying to shed the light it'll hit
[43:33] with
[43:34] with uh uh eagles
[43:36] others just bounces off i mean you
[43:39] experiencing it with your own relatives
[43:41] no matter what you say they're not
[43:42] interested so you just live your life
[43:45] that day on calvary 1960 he was just one
[43:48] man the perfect man he gave his life and
[43:51] he made an example for you now what must
[43:53] we do
[43:54] the first thing i want to say is jesus
[43:56] never lived for himself
[43:58] amen
[43:59] his life was spent for others that is
[44:02] perfectly eternal life when you say you
[44:04] go to church and do good things that's
[44:05] fine but when you live your life just to
[44:08] yourself you don't have and you're not
[44:10] expressing eternal life
[44:12] eternal life is living for others
[44:16] it proved that when he came as the lamb
[44:18] of god he lived and had eternal life
[44:20] because he lived did not live for
[44:21] himself
[44:22] he lived for others and you receive
[44:24] eternal life by receiving that day on
[44:26] calvary and you don't live for yourself
[44:28] no more you live for others
[44:31] and when you read through the four
[44:32] gospels you'll see that jesus didn't
[44:34] spend time with the high and mighty
[44:37] he spent time with people we would maybe
[44:41] not even let in this church
[44:44] hit the road
[44:47] but he spent time with those people he
[44:48] lived for others
[44:50] now the missionary work that we're
[44:52] involved in we're going to cover this
[44:54] part first
[44:55] and we'll go on into jonah but um
[44:58] in acts 11 29
[45:01] we have
[45:02] um
[45:03] where that
[45:05] we have the basis here for what we're
[45:07] trying to accomplish uh let's see acts
[45:09] 11 29
[45:13] then the disciples every man according
[45:16] to his ability
[45:18] determined to send relief unto the
[45:19] brethren that dwelt in judea that was up
[45:21] in jerusalem which also they did and
[45:23] sent it to the elders by the hands of
[45:26] barnabas and saul
[45:27] that
[45:28] is the basis for missionary work that
[45:30] we're even trying to accomplish today
[45:32] you see
[45:33] and for example we have
[45:36] i don't know how much you've read about
[45:37] it or heard about it but in venezuela
[45:40] it's right at the top of south america
[45:42] it used to be the crown and the best
[45:45] economy of entire south america
[45:48] we lived there one time
[45:50] and uh sure they had difficulties and it
[45:52] was hot and all that but they had an
[45:54] economy that was going forward
[45:57] but then in 1999 they elected a
[45:59] socialist president and
[46:03] today they're over i i don't even know
[46:06] the number today but it's well over four
[46:07] thousand percent inflation
[46:10] you can't it can't grow you can't have
[46:12] an economy like that so what happens
[46:15] um you've got people that are you know
[46:17] they've got jobs you know
[46:19] but they're paying them in the local
[46:21] currency which is basically worthless
[46:24] now a church of 150 people
[46:28] some of them have jobs no hardly anybody
[46:30] drives to church because
[46:33] the gasoline is so bad it ruins the
[46:35] injectors and the converter and
[46:37] everything else so they don't buy the
[46:39] cheap gas it used to be five cents a
[46:41] gallon
[46:42] oh that was nice yeah i drove there
[46:45] you know you got changed in the thing
[46:46] here by the in the console
[46:49] keep the change fill it up
[46:51] you didn't think about gasoline and it
[46:53] was good
[46:54] so now it's four dollars a gallon and
[46:56] it's it's not good gasoline okay
[46:59] so
[47:00] these people walk to church
[47:01] there's no bus service they walk and in
[47:04] this 150 people this is just an example
[47:06] there's there's probably in venezuela
[47:08] alone there would be over 100 churches
[47:11] but this one church just for an example
[47:13] would uh take up the tithes and
[47:15] offerings now
[47:16] when they
[47:17] uh go to buy something or pay for the
[47:19] light or whatever
[47:21] it's got to be dollars
[47:22] not that the country is dollarized
[47:24] because there's no dollars in the bank
[47:25] you can't go get dollars out of the bank
[47:28] out of the cash machine but that is what
[47:30] they trade in you know the market
[47:32] everything is in dollars so out of this
[47:34] 150 people at the times and offerings
[47:36] there might be twenty dollars worth
[47:38] we can't do much
[47:40] they've got a this one church has a um
[47:43] uh it's like a it's gonna call it a bus
[47:46] but it's like our airport shuttle you
[47:47] know a small bus
[47:48] well the bearings wore out in the rear
[47:50] tires the rear axle so i'm talking to
[47:54] the brother and
[47:56] he he wouldn't he wouldn't ask for
[47:57] anything he would never ask for anything
[48:00] but he's telling me a sad story about
[48:01] these bearings that they bought and they
[48:03] were made somewhere and they didn't work
[48:05] and you know they can't run this thing
[48:07] they would try to get some good gas and
[48:09] go get some of the people
[48:11] well anyway i said we can help you we've
[48:13] got you know
[48:15] you know auto parts right here
[48:17] so
[48:17] i got the exact number and the picture
[48:19] and all that
[48:21] and invested i think 200
[48:23] for that then we ship them to miami then
[48:26] we have a brother in miami who has a
[48:27] shipping company yeah it's a believer
[48:30] and he sends it and it'll be at their
[48:31] door within a few days
[48:33] and they can get this thing running so
[48:35] there is a solution
[48:36] so when you when you give it goes to
[48:39] things like that things that can
[48:40] actually be tangible yeah now in some
[48:44] cases we're keeping people off the
[48:45] street if we don't help them they're
[48:46] going to be sleeping under the you know
[48:47] trees
[48:49] buying food
[48:51] not everybody obviously but there's a
[48:53] few families that need help
[48:56] and so in venezuela they they they get
[48:59] together the brothers ministers get
[49:01] together once a month
[49:03] so the first monday of the month they
[49:05] get together they share their needs and
[49:07] so forth
[49:08] and um they're doing fine
[49:10] you know spiritually but we try to help
[49:13] them one brother had a uh
[49:16] he's on his bicycle and somehow he got
[49:18] hurt in an accident and his his wrist
[49:20] was you know immobile so
[49:23] he goes in
[49:25] and
[49:26] whatever operation they did didn't work
[49:27] right so now he's got infection
[49:31] and the infection's got to disappear
[49:32] before they go in and get it right
[49:35] so he goes in tomorrow check that out so
[49:37] i asked them okay how much for the
[49:38] operation because you know they're real
[49:39] careful they don't want to beg
[49:41] and but i got to get some numbers you
[49:43] know is it two thousand what is it
[49:45] six hundred dollars well fine you can't
[49:47] even get in the door here
[49:49] at a hospital six hundred dollars
[49:51] so
[49:52] so i said okay you get get the infection
[49:55] out we've got six hundred dollars ready
[49:56] to go now how do we send money to
[49:59] venezuela good question thank you for
[50:01] asking
[50:02] they don't have money gram they don't
[50:04] have anything
[50:06] it's cut off from the real world because
[50:08] they want to be like cuba i've been to
[50:10] cuba there's nothing to replicate
[50:13] it's all gray there's no no color no
[50:16] nothing
[50:17] and so
[50:19] and so since 1959 or 60 they've you know
[50:23] been cut off and they said well we're
[50:25] suffering because america well there's
[50:26] 195 other countries that you could trade
[50:28] with
[50:29] you know
[50:30] but anyway um
[50:32] the uh
[50:34] the system is is really bad because they
[50:36] want to be like cuba it's all socialist
[50:39] the only thing that keeps it running is
[50:41] a little bit of oil money because
[50:42] they've let the system they've not kept
[50:44] the pipes clean and everything
[50:46] and they um
[50:48] they have um
[50:50] drugs yeah a lot of drugstore too
[50:52] that's cash you know and that keeps
[50:54] things going
[50:56] well it's bad news
[50:57] so we're trying to help them just
[51:00] stay above water so they can at least
[51:01] breathe and um you know be able to eat
[51:07] so there's many other things we can tell
[51:08] you about venezuela but it's just that
[51:10] it's very bad and we're helping also the
[51:12] money so how do we get money to them
[51:14] so
[51:16] i have a an account with chase bank
[51:18] being a veteran we get some benefits
[51:20] and so um
[51:22] uh down there there's you know a guy
[51:25] he's a pharmacist or he has some kind of
[51:27] company he's a friend of a friend of a
[51:28] friend
[51:30] so um
[51:32] he has an american many people have an
[51:34] american bank account miami so from my
[51:36] chase account i can transfer for free
[51:38] into
[51:40] whoever
[51:41] i sure don't know him but he's trusted
[51:43] by them
[51:44] and then once i
[51:45] put the money in
[51:46] then i said okay here's the transfer
[51:48] number so much is in that account right
[51:51] well then that goes to person a or b and
[51:54] so for three percent commission well
[51:56] everybody's got to eat you know so for
[51:58] three percent they will get their money
[52:00] and they can go on with their business
[52:02] and that's how we get money in it looks
[52:04] like money laundering well thank you mr
[52:05] biden that's
[52:08] because of our sorry government things
[52:09] like that happen
[52:12] then we have for example peru
[52:14] which is very very bad with the covert
[52:17] people dying just all kinds of things
[52:21] and it's just right there i mean this is
[52:23] 21st century but see we live one way
[52:26] and you don't have to go very far from
[52:27] right here to see that people are
[52:28] suffering
[52:30] i mean when i come through the airport
[52:32] in detroit on wednesday here's these
[52:34] people you had thought we were in tehran
[52:37] i mean they're all dressed they got the
[52:39] you know 17 bags
[52:41] because there's a direct flight to
[52:43] to amman jordan yeah boom you're there
[52:47] i've been over there and so yeah peru is
[52:50] very bad as far as that we're trying to
[52:52] help some of them
[52:53] and um
[52:55] and then for example in malawi malawi is
[52:58] in the middle of africa below the
[52:59] equator it's down you know in the lower
[53:01] half
[53:02] very poor people but they're very happy
[53:04] in the lord
[53:05] and i was over there in
[53:07] uh 19 when you could still travel
[53:10] a brother from south africa came we met
[53:12] there and traveled around saw a lot of
[53:14] churches this one church
[53:17] we were in there was
[53:19] easily 500 people
[53:21] now they didn't have nice chairs they
[53:23] didn't know no backs it was it was
[53:25] blocks and a board and that's where you
[53:27] sit and nobody's moving around they're
[53:29] paying attention
[53:31] but they only had okay so here's 500
[53:33] people
[53:34] and there's no glass in the windows you
[53:35] know it's all open air
[53:37] and uh
[53:38] and they have two light bulbs one's way
[53:40] back there and one's right here
[53:42] well guess what light bulbs attract bugs
[53:45] so i'm talking through this you know
[53:47] through an interpreter so i'd say
[53:49] something so while he's
[53:51] speaking for you know five seconds
[53:54] bug comes from
[53:56] so thankfully it was while he was
[53:58] talking
[53:59] had mouth closed and he got caught in
[54:00] mustache
[54:03] but these people pay attention they're
[54:05] happy to be part of the you know of the
[54:08] gospel and so i noticed a very few
[54:10] people had bibles
[54:12] and so i asked well how come people well
[54:14] they can't afford them well
[54:16] we're going to buy them bibles
[54:17] what language do you need so they wrote
[54:20] down so many in each language went to
[54:22] town sure enough there's a bible society
[54:24] oh yeah we have those those languages so
[54:26] we bought the bibles
[54:28] every house has a bible now amen how can
[54:30] you preach to people don't have a bible
[54:33] so one by one
[54:35] another church we were in malawi uh they
[54:38] had um
[54:39] uh probably 120 people or so and the
[54:42] interesting thing is they don't put the
[54:44] babies way over there no they have a
[54:47] they have a rug right here in the middle
[54:48] of the floor
[54:49] and that's where the children
[54:51] they're right there and they're paying
[54:52] attention
[54:53] they're under the sound of the gospel
[54:55] mother's right there looking deacons are
[54:57] looking
[54:58] they pay attention
[55:00] okay interesting
[55:01] and so
[55:02] uh after i left come to find out that
[55:05] the brother that had you know donated
[55:07] the land for this church uh he wanted it
[55:10] back
[55:11] he was very militant he said this is
[55:12] mine now we're gonna do things this way
[55:14] and if you don't like this stay out so
[55:17] the majority of the people are out under
[55:18] a tree
[55:20] okay
[55:21] and so uh they wrote to me and said look
[55:23] we have uh
[55:25] their money's very different from ours
[55:27] but we've got you know two-thirds or
[55:28] more of the purchase price for this
[55:30] piece of ground we need a little bit of
[55:32] help so we can finish buying that ground
[55:34] and get church up
[55:36] and so
[55:38] they needed like a thousand dollars well
[55:40] by the time i got
[55:41] you know through shuffling and finding a
[55:43] thousand dollars the catholic church
[55:44] bought the piece of property
[55:46] okay
[55:47] i thought don't worry god's got
[55:48] something better for you you know
[55:50] and um god didn't want you downtown he
[55:52] wants you out here so they started
[55:54] looking so outside of town they found a
[55:57] place uh
[55:59] in our measurement probably like three
[56:00] acres
[56:02] and so it's just it's just rough i mean
[56:04] nothing's ever been there
[56:06] and they said yeah this this will
[56:08] probably work so we helped them that
[56:09] bought the land well then they had to
[56:11] you know scrape it off to build a have a
[56:13] building site
[56:14] and they're all excited but we're going
[56:16] to have our own place
[56:18] and so they said we're going to we're
[56:19] going to call this george smith
[56:21] tabernacle
[56:22] i said no i don't think so now
[56:24] we're going to call this walking in the
[56:26] light tabernacle ah yeah we like that so
[56:28] they went and registered the name
[56:30] and so then i mean you imagine a church
[56:32] about the size of this whole building
[56:34] here and they're out there digging the
[56:36] foundation with pick and shovel
[56:39] and we're gonna publish a letter here
[56:42] this month hopefully and show you the
[56:43] pictures but anyway they're digging the
[56:45] foundation i didn't tell them what size
[56:46] to build they know what they need we
[56:48] just said we'll help you
[56:50] and so um
[56:52] they um
[56:53] they
[56:54] dug the foundation got the concrete in
[56:56] got the bricks now they they don't have
[56:58] a uh
[56:59] when they deliver the bricks it's not
[57:00] like here the semi comes up and a little
[57:02] loader comes off
[57:04] no
[57:05] truck parks all the bricks fly off
[57:07] now you got two piles of bricks
[57:09] now these bricks are fired so they're
[57:11] not breaking but
[57:13] there's the piles and jobs over there so
[57:15] we gotta have people so they have all
[57:17] kinds of people to help
[57:18] and they got all they got it up and um
[57:21] and they got the roof on and just this
[57:24] week they're pouring the concrete floor
[57:26] and they've already done the plumbing
[57:28] the electric and it's just very
[57:29] different from what we do we don't have
[57:31] any
[57:31] officials like you guys have coming
[57:33] around
[57:34] you know change that
[57:36] you got to wonder
[57:38] but
[57:39] anyway they're they're moving along and
[57:41] that's going to be done in the next 30
[57:43] days or so only thing they got to do now
[57:45] is to uh
[57:46] put the what you call plaster on the
[57:48] walls
[57:49] and plant some trees they'll be in
[57:51] business they're very anxious to get in
[57:53] because they've been meeting under a
[57:54] tent and it's hot of course right now
[57:56] it's kind of cool over there but anyway
[57:58] they're doing fine
[58:00] and so the brother said boy it should be
[58:02] nice if we had air conditioning
[58:03] well they don't understand air
[58:05] conditioning air conditioning has got to
[58:06] be a tight building
[58:08] you're going to condition this there not
[58:10] everything around
[58:11] so i explained that to him and said look
[58:12] i know it's hot in the summertime but
[58:15] look about putting some fans on the wall
[58:17] you know to keep the air moving oh yeah
[58:19] a good idea yeah because even if you
[58:21] could afford air conditioning okay so
[58:23] let's say that this church is air
[58:24] conditioned
[58:25] well that's the only air conditioning
[58:27] they know so they're going to sit in
[58:28] this nice room but then they're going to
[58:30] go out there they're going to come back
[58:32] somebody's going to get sick you can't
[58:34] be you know going back and forth
[58:36] well anyway um
[58:38] they're um
[58:40] they're about to finish that church it's
[58:41] been a long project probably over a year
[58:43] now but they're they're very very humble
[58:45] people they're very honest and we need
[58:48] such and such so the bank transfers to
[58:50] their account
[58:51] they go build we need this much and it's
[58:54] for this huge church you'll see it when
[58:56] we get to publish but it's probably
[59:00] if you squeeze the people in you
[59:01] probably get 800 people in there um
[59:05] we're going to be under 50 000
[59:06] to build it roof and all and everything
[59:09] well
[59:10] um
[59:11] so it's out there out of town a little
[59:13] ways well the neighbors you know people
[59:15] live in the other farms around there
[59:17] they're wondering what's that building
[59:18] over there you know so they come around
[59:20] they've been baptizing people every day
[59:23] so they're going to fill it up with the
[59:24] neighbors
[59:26] yeah god you know he knows where the
[59:28] eagles are amen and we don't have to go
[59:31] you know convince some people it's just
[59:32] if it's real you know
[59:34] so the book of acts is still being
[59:36] written amen you know it's the only book
[59:37] in the bible that's not finished
[59:39] it goes on and on and on and we're we're
[59:42] a part of it now the um
[59:45] the other thing that we've been doing
[59:47] is the uh the church age book has been
[59:51] it's been around since 65. well the
[59:53] spanish translation has been out since
[59:55] about 1970. and when i translate it into
[59:58] spanish yes i'm bilingual
[1:00:00] so
[1:00:01] you know the story it's on online but um
[1:00:05] i took the liberty to to break down some
[1:00:07] paragraphs put numbers on them and bring
[1:00:09] in the scriptures so that you could you
[1:00:10] could see when you're reading it you
[1:00:12] know
[1:00:12] well that was fine everybody's been
[1:00:15] enjoying that since 1970.
[1:00:17] but then
[1:00:18] the english people started seeing this
[1:00:19] well how come our book doesn't look like
[1:00:21] that you know
[1:00:22] and so i talked to my brother-in-law and
[1:00:24] said look
[1:00:25] these people want this
[1:00:26] and he told me
[1:00:28] years ago saw that never works you know
[1:00:30] people already got the page numbers
[1:00:31] memorized we're not going to mess with
[1:00:32] that
[1:00:33] okay
[1:00:34] then about
[1:00:35] less than 10 years ago
[1:00:37] the brother some other brothers were
[1:00:38] telling me look our grandchildren are
[1:00:40] not reading this it's one long paragraph
[1:00:42] and they're not you know they're not
[1:00:44] reading it
[1:00:45] we need it like the spanish book looks
[1:00:48] and so i wrote to them again and i'm
[1:00:50] just telling you this so you'll know
[1:00:52] that we're not
[1:00:53] doing stuff under the table
[1:00:54] and i wrote to both of my
[1:00:56] brother-in-laws and i said look
[1:00:57] here's the english here's the spanish
[1:00:59] there's a demand for the english book to
[1:01:01] look like the spanish book so that you
[1:01:03] can read it easier not change any words
[1:01:06] just you know format it a little
[1:01:07] differently
[1:01:09] they said no no we're gonna leave it the
[1:01:10] way dad left it fine
[1:01:13] i said look when i initially approached
[1:01:15] him i said look
[1:01:16] uh i can get this ready and send it to
[1:01:19] you you print it and
[1:01:21] sell it
[1:01:22] or
[1:01:23] and then if if we do that then you know
[1:01:26] it's your job it's your book
[1:01:28] but or i the second choice is i can get
[1:01:31] it ready and i'll print it and i'll take
[1:01:33] you know send it out and i'll send you a
[1:01:35] dollar and a half for every book we sell
[1:01:38] well not anybody with a business brain
[1:01:41] you know
[1:01:42] no no we're not going to touch that
[1:01:43] we're going to leave the way dad left it
[1:01:44] okay
[1:01:46] well it just so happens at that same
[1:01:48] time they made a decision to go from one
[1:01:50] dollar a book that they were selling to
[1:01:52] 750 book every language every country
[1:01:56] well those people can't afford that
[1:01:58] so
[1:01:59] once they answer that way i just
[1:02:01] prayed for 10 minutes and we've launched
[1:02:02] out on our own program don't send them
[1:02:04] nothing
[1:02:05] because you know contracts contract but
[1:02:08] they didn't accept it so the book has
[1:02:10] been going out you people have seen it
[1:02:12] everybody loves it and uh brother berry
[1:02:15] coffee has contacts in china big
[1:02:18] precious you know they do volume over
[1:02:19] there so
[1:02:21] we sent him the the first was the
[1:02:23] spanish text
[1:02:25] they printed it
[1:02:26] sent initially printed twenty thousand
[1:02:28] because sent
[1:02:30] five thousand mexico city five thousand
[1:02:32] to honduras and
[1:02:34] 5 000 to colombia on the west coast
[1:02:38] another 5 000 were going to uruguay but
[1:02:40] they couldn't get their stuff together
[1:02:42] so those 5 000 went to honduras so they
[1:02:44] got 10 000 and they're distributing it
[1:02:46] they're getting it out you know
[1:02:48] happy to be a part of something
[1:02:50] it comes to them free all they got to do
[1:02:52] is distribute it
[1:02:53] and so
[1:02:54] because of covid then there was no
[1:02:57] communication with the with the
[1:02:58] countries i mean you couldn't just go
[1:03:00] over like chicago you had to there was
[1:03:01] no no passage
[1:03:03] well there's a missionary brother was
[1:03:04] down there in honduras and he was going
[1:03:07] to go to nicaragua so i said well hey
[1:03:09] since you're going how about going over
[1:03:11] there and getting you know a couple
[1:03:12] boxes of books and taken to nicaragua
[1:03:14] because they can't go through oh yeah
[1:03:16] okay so they got i think six boxes
[1:03:19] so they get to the border and they're
[1:03:21] gonna
[1:03:22] go through
[1:03:23] oh no no no
[1:03:25] you know we can't do that in fact we're
[1:03:26] gonna charge you five dollars per book
[1:03:29] just to get it in well we'll just back
[1:03:31] up and rethink this so they go back well
[1:03:33] of course the guy's on the other phone
[1:03:34] the side of the border they got cell
[1:03:36] phones they're waiting for this brother
[1:03:38] and they said well uh well we got some
[1:03:40] guys here with some horses we'll send
[1:03:42] them across the river it's not very deep
[1:03:44] and you guys can load them up and get
[1:03:46] them across that way
[1:03:47] sure enough
[1:03:48] wrap them all in plastic put them on the
[1:03:49] horses
[1:03:50] and they went through and the guys over
[1:03:52] there i think they gave them 10 cents a
[1:03:54] book to get them in
[1:03:56] so there's ways and uh so then we
[1:03:59] printed the english book and it's going
[1:04:00] to different countries
[1:04:02] that aren't going to get it any other
[1:04:03] way there's no other possible way to get
[1:04:05] this book in their hands but for us to
[1:04:07] step in get the book printed get it sent
[1:04:10] to each country that can you know spread
[1:04:12] from there
[1:04:13] and um they
[1:04:15] they're happy with the book you know
[1:04:17] so uh we have a little video clip here
[1:04:20] we want to show you this let me just
[1:04:21] tell you the books came into the west
[1:04:23] coast of
[1:04:24] of uh colombia and then they got to be
[1:04:27] sent to these other places i see that
[1:04:29] guy he's carrying two boxes of books
[1:04:31] that's uh 60 pounds worth
[1:04:33] yeah so down there someplace is the is
[1:04:36] the border and they snuck them across
[1:04:38] into ecuador
[1:04:39] and then they load them in this
[1:04:41] they're they ordered 40 boxes so they'll
[1:04:43] load them into this truck and they will
[1:04:45] be distributed throughout ecuador
[1:04:48] they don't have simple ways of doing
[1:04:49] things you've got to sneak it in pay
[1:04:51] somebody a little bit of money
[1:04:53] and um so yeah even the women were
[1:04:55] carrying them so these were these were
[1:04:57] bundled up in china sent to colombia now
[1:05:00] they're in ecuador
[1:05:02] and these guys are they're workers you
[1:05:04] know
[1:05:05] yeah they're willing to help
[1:05:07] and even though the sisters were
[1:05:08] carrying some
[1:05:09] some of those boxes
[1:05:11] but yeah they're now look they're
[1:05:12] carrying 60 pounds on their back going
[1:05:14] uphill amen
[1:05:17] i saw you carrying those
[1:05:19] bags of feed the other day this weighs
[1:05:21] more
[1:05:23] but anyway that's that's one way of
[1:05:24] getting it into the next country
[1:05:27] they don't have the facilities that we
[1:05:29] have you know so the brother in colombia
[1:05:31] he's all set up with the government with
[1:05:32] the permits and stuff so he can get more
[1:05:35] uh currently they're printing another 20
[1:05:38] 20 000 in china
[1:05:40] to send some to mexico city and to
[1:05:44] honduras and to colombia
[1:05:46] and to
[1:05:47] chile
[1:05:48] because from chile it's more of a first
[1:05:50] world country
[1:05:51] and they can print i mean they can they
[1:05:53] can ship it out to the neighboring
[1:05:55] countries
[1:05:56] so yeah these brothers are just
[1:05:57] expressing their their gratitude and
[1:05:59] they're happy to be a part of it so
[1:06:02] these are our brothers you know yeah
[1:06:04] and they want me to come down there and
[1:06:06] i can't go right now
[1:06:08] because of the situation
[1:06:10] but we can stay here and get stuff to
[1:06:13] them
[1:06:14] and so now we're working on the seal
[1:06:16] book to get it printed in china and get
[1:06:19] it distributed just like that
[1:06:21] so
[1:06:21] english and
[1:06:23] spanish it'll be it'll be a little more
[1:06:25] readable
[1:06:26] and i must add because of the fact
[1:06:30] brother branham never wanted his
[1:06:31] material to go out just verbatim
[1:06:33] word for word he knew his limitations
[1:06:36] he said what if this gets into the hands
[1:06:38] of people at princeton or somebody and
[1:06:39] think we're a bunch of ignoramuses
[1:06:41] he wants it readable you know
[1:06:43] and so uh the seal book has been
[1:06:46] reprinted several times
[1:06:48] but it just needs to be combed through
[1:06:51] take some light sandpaper and make it
[1:06:53] readable without changing any
[1:06:55] any uh meaning
[1:06:57] so that's what we're doing and thanks to
[1:06:59] brother john in his
[1:07:00] upper room where he stuck me i was able
[1:07:03] to have some quiet time
[1:07:04] except when you know the dog needed
[1:07:06] attention
[1:07:07] and
[1:07:08] so we're making some progress so pray
[1:07:10] for us on that
[1:07:12] approach to the seal book and um there's
[1:07:15] you know like say many other things
[1:07:16] going on people have emergencies and
[1:07:19] we try to help where we can
[1:07:20] and what you people have done every
[1:07:22] month has been a big help
[1:07:25] because sometimes we don't know lord we
[1:07:27] don't know the program you know
[1:07:30] we live right now
[1:07:32] and yesterday's gone we can't change
[1:07:34] what happened yesterday but we said what
[1:07:36] we did what we ate that's gone
[1:07:38] we don't know about tomorrow amen
[1:07:41] you know you don't have any guarantee
[1:07:42] get your head on the pillow tonight
[1:07:44] but we live now so we we operate in the
[1:07:46] present
[1:07:47] and that's what we're trying to do is do
[1:07:49] what we can now and god always supplies
[1:07:52] our needs
[1:07:54] okay let's get on with brother jonah
[1:07:57] because uh i'm sure you all had a good
[1:07:58] breakfast
[1:07:59] two cups of coffee
[1:08:01] and we're not in a hurry to go are we
[1:08:04] okay okay got a commitment
[1:08:06] so jonah had a direct commission from
[1:08:08] god go preach to the enemy their
[1:08:10] wickedness has come up before me i can't
[1:08:12] stand it anymore go preach repentance
[1:08:15] there was only one serious problem jonah
[1:08:17] was jewish
[1:08:19] and the people of nineveh were gentiles
[1:08:21] very serious segregation so we brought
[1:08:24] the level so that we can
[1:08:28] let's see if we make a stick here you
[1:08:30] know i was in africa one time and they
[1:08:31] gave me a pulpit
[1:08:33] and it was like a
[1:08:34] like a music stand you know
[1:08:36] solid steel
[1:08:38] and just a sharp edge like this uh what
[1:08:40] i'm gonna do well guess what this is
[1:08:42] magnetic so just stuck it on
[1:08:45] but anyway you all get the picture put
[1:08:47] it right here where you can see it um
[1:08:49] the uh
[1:08:50] the thing with jonah he was out of
[1:08:52] balance because
[1:08:54] they had very serious segregation now
[1:08:56] all through the bible i hate to say it
[1:08:58] but all through the bible they had
[1:08:59] segregation
[1:09:01] arabs lived here the jews lived here
[1:09:03] everything was fine
[1:09:04] but the great american way
[1:09:06] we're going to put them all together
[1:09:07] might work better it hasn't worked out
[1:09:09] too good
[1:09:11] so
[1:09:12] um
[1:09:13] now nineveh was the capital of assyria
[1:09:16] which is currently northern iraq
[1:09:18] they were very wicked sinful people very
[1:09:21] cruel violent city of over 120 000
[1:09:24] people a large city took three days to
[1:09:26] walk around it okay
[1:09:28] and these assyrians up there were
[1:09:30] constantly tormenting and oppressing the
[1:09:32] israelites they didn't start in 1948 it
[1:09:35] started 3 000 years ago
[1:09:37] they've been trying to put out this
[1:09:38] light ever since so god was sending his
[1:09:41] prophet right into the jaws of danger
[1:09:43] okay to face the enemy go cry against it
[1:09:47] it's time for repentance warning before
[1:09:49] judgment
[1:09:50] so god always warns before judgment
[1:09:54] when jesus was walking over in israel he
[1:09:56] went all these towns and villages
[1:09:58] preaching and healing the sick
[1:10:00] and
[1:10:01] three villagers in particular
[1:10:04] weren't paying attention they didn't
[1:10:05] realize the value they just didn't
[1:10:07] believe
[1:10:08] and so he blasted them real hard it's
[1:10:11] betsaida korotsim and capernaum
[1:10:14] okay and he said what he said life went
[1:10:17] on people you know did their thing
[1:10:20] but 60 years later when they had
[1:10:22] forgotten what he said because you know
[1:10:24] they didn't they didn't write it down
[1:10:26] and there was very few if any
[1:10:28] eyewitnesses left 60 years later god
[1:10:30] sends the earthquake and destroys those
[1:10:33] three towns
[1:10:35] the only life there is today is in
[1:10:37] capernaum because the catholics own that
[1:10:39] little piece of land and they've made a
[1:10:41] bit of a tourist
[1:10:43] thing out of it so you can come see
[1:10:44] where it was
[1:10:45] but the fact is
[1:10:46] that
[1:10:47] god does care for his own
[1:10:50] and what he says is correct
[1:10:52] even the the
[1:10:54] tour guides over there just the regular
[1:10:56] israel people
[1:10:57] they say you better believe the bible
[1:10:59] look what jesus said and those three
[1:11:01] places are a pile of rocks
[1:11:04] everything else in israel has been
[1:11:05] reconstructed you know
[1:11:07] people live there not in those three
[1:11:08] places
[1:11:10] so fast forward
[1:11:12] and we're over here in
[1:11:14] 2021 but our prophet spoke in california
[1:11:18] uh choosing a ride in 1965 and you know
[1:11:21] the blast he gave there
[1:11:23] and he says it it'd be a piece three to
[1:11:25] four hundred miles wide
[1:11:27] that's pretty big chunk
[1:11:30] 1200 miles long it's gonna break off
[1:11:34] and there's no repair no fema no nothing
[1:11:37] you know
[1:11:39] so
[1:11:40] it's coming
[1:11:42] amen
[1:11:43] so why is that important to us because
[1:11:44] in first corinthians 10 11 all these
[1:11:46] things happen to them for examples and
[1:11:48] are written for our admonition
[1:11:51] who's our who's us upon whom the ends of
[1:11:53] the world are come
[1:11:55] that's us
[1:11:56] that's not the days of paul no not even
[1:11:58] days of william brown it's our days
[1:12:00] now is the end time we are the end time
[1:12:03] generation the end of the ages is at the
[1:12:05] door
[1:12:06] so whatever we're going to do we've got
[1:12:08] to do now
[1:12:10] and so the world is falling apart
[1:12:13] jesus told us over in luke 21 uh
[1:12:15] 28 when you see these things happening
[1:12:19] look up there's no repair you're not
[1:12:21] going to fix it don't waste your time
[1:12:22] don't waste your money look up we're
[1:12:24] leaving
[1:12:25] so that's where we're at now so once
[1:12:27] again we have a message of warning
[1:12:29] before judgment okay
[1:12:31] simple and to the point
[1:12:32] only believe repent or perish with the
[1:12:35] unbelievers you have a choice
[1:12:37] okay you can choose
[1:12:39] and uh you know comply with the
[1:12:42] unbelievers and uh
[1:12:44] be careful
[1:12:45] i know you got to work but you can be a
[1:12:47] christian you know
[1:12:49] so we need a shaking we need a a
[1:12:52] to shake off the shackles of unbelief
[1:12:54] the
[1:12:55] shackles of the attitude of no concern
[1:12:56] and who cares
[1:12:58] we need a trimming off just like some of
[1:13:00] those trees over
[1:13:01] pastor's house see if i stayed another
[1:13:04] three days i'd be out there with with my
[1:13:06] buddy here and we'd get us a trailer and
[1:13:07] we'd cut some of that stuff and put it
[1:13:09] in the trailer and go burn it you know
[1:13:10] so that we can you know see out got a
[1:13:12] lot of stuff growing there
[1:13:14] but
[1:13:15] we need cutting away and cutting away of
[1:13:18] the lazy idle no interest attitude
[1:13:21] and we need a cutting away of the
[1:13:23] idolatry
[1:13:25] because it's big
[1:13:27] it's far beyond time for an aspirin or
[1:13:29] alka-seltzer a pat on the back you're
[1:13:31] going to be okay we're not going to be
[1:13:32] okay
[1:13:33] we need major surgery we need the truth
[1:13:36] not another cute little sermon no
[1:13:38] we can't afford to continue to play
[1:13:40] church
[1:13:41] it's high time that we actively seek the
[1:13:44] presence of the lord in our individual
[1:13:46] lives
[1:13:47] it's nice while we're here but we can't
[1:13:48] stay here we've got to go out there
[1:13:50] got to go face those people
[1:13:52] so we we gear up here to go out there
[1:13:55] you see
[1:13:57] so we need to get in our individual
[1:13:58] closet how we can please him and find
[1:14:01] god for god's will for our individual
[1:14:04] lives now first john 4 20
[1:14:07] says if a man says i love god because
[1:14:10] everybody loves god
[1:14:11] no problem
[1:14:13] and hates his brother or starts
[1:14:15] narrowing down
[1:14:16] if a man says he loves god
[1:14:19] and hates his brother he's a liar
[1:14:22] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[1:14:25] he can see how can he love god whom he
[1:14:27] can't see
[1:14:28] so however we treat each other believer
[1:14:31] to believer you see that's the way we
[1:14:34] treat god
[1:14:35] that's why we manifest to each other
[1:14:37] that's the way we love god
[1:14:39] okay so he's watching our reaction to
[1:14:42] these situations to these tests they see
[1:14:45] all the problems that we have in america
[1:14:47] don't worry about the rest of the world
[1:14:48] everything's going wrong right here
[1:14:50] god could solve all of that by sunrise
[1:14:52] tomorrow
[1:14:54] yeah he could get it all arranged
[1:14:57] kill these people but these people he
[1:14:58] could do it all right but he lets it go
[1:15:00] and go and go and he watches our
[1:15:02] reactions you see that's right yeah
[1:15:05] now jonah was god's man of the hour okay
[1:15:08] he had a clear cut decision from god
[1:15:12] um a commandment from god go cry against
[1:15:15] their sin
[1:15:16] and their corruption i know about the
[1:15:19] segregation i know all about your fears
[1:15:22] and your doubts go anyway
[1:15:25] verse three
[1:15:26] but
[1:15:27] oh got a problem but jonah rose up
[1:15:31] the next morning to go to tarshish
[1:15:34] from the presence of the lord and he
[1:15:36] went down to joppa down to the
[1:15:38] port and he found a ship going to
[1:15:40] tarshish so he paid the pharaoh and went
[1:15:43] down into it to go with them unto
[1:15:46] tarshish
[1:15:47] second time from the presence of the
[1:15:49] lord
[1:15:50] it's not looking too good brother not
[1:15:52] looking good now he wasn't just anybody
[1:15:54] okay he was god's prophet of the hour he
[1:15:57] was god's mouthpiece
[1:15:59] but it's looking bad
[1:16:01] he didn't break relationship he was
[1:16:04] still god's man he broke fellowship and
[1:16:07] that happens to us
[1:16:09] we stay home we start getting cold and
[1:16:11] indifferent sorry bunch
[1:16:13] you're still god's child
[1:16:15] and you will pay for that wrong decision
[1:16:17] just like he paid
[1:16:19] but if you're god's child he will bring
[1:16:20] you back if you're not we'll let you go
[1:16:22] you know
[1:16:25] so
[1:16:25] brother brahm says anointed prophets
[1:16:27] make wrong decisions
[1:16:29] sorry to break your bubble but they're
[1:16:31] humans that's true
[1:16:33] so here he goes down to the coast down
[1:16:36] where the boats are
[1:16:37] and um he finds one going
[1:16:40] the wrong way
[1:16:42] you know tarshish
[1:16:44] and so he uh he gets his money out you
[1:16:46] know pays his fare going on vacation
[1:16:49] and uh now these people operate in the
[1:16:51] boat there are no dummies they're
[1:16:53] they're watching the weather they got
[1:16:55] you know they got grain that they're
[1:16:56] taking to rome
[1:16:57] it could be the boat could be a hundred
[1:16:59] feet long
[1:17:00] carrying 300 tons of grain
[1:17:03] that's a lot of valuable stuff you see
[1:17:06] so they're if it's stormy they just stay
[1:17:07] put so it looks good they take off
[1:17:11] and they get out there a little ways in
[1:17:12] the mediterranean
[1:17:14] and the storm comes we didn't see this
[1:17:16] coming
[1:17:17] and it starts getting bad they start
[1:17:18] pitching stuff off the boat so it won't
[1:17:20] sink
[1:17:21] and uh and they said where's that
[1:17:23] tourist we got where's that guy let's
[1:17:25] see he wasn't wearing his prophet suit
[1:17:27] he didn't have you know elder or
[1:17:28] whatever no he was just he looked like
[1:17:31] the rest of them just like peter when he
[1:17:33] snuck into the yard there to get his
[1:17:34] hands warm by the enemy's fire
[1:17:36] they didn't know who he was until he
[1:17:38] said thank you for the t
[1:17:41] you're from galilee you're one of them
[1:17:42] never heard of him
[1:17:44] big liar
[1:17:46] he had the keys
[1:17:47] you know another another message but
[1:17:50] anyway
[1:17:51] um
[1:17:52] where's that tourist so they get him up
[1:17:53] there look at this mess
[1:17:55] well guys i know what the problem is i'm
[1:17:57] the problem
[1:17:59] now it's real simple you throw me over
[1:18:01] everything be fine really try it
[1:18:04] well god had a fish prepared now we're
[1:18:06] not going to worry about what size it
[1:18:07] was and what his name was
[1:18:09] but the fish was coming right along the
[1:18:11] boat he was following the boat you know
[1:18:12] god was directing him
[1:18:15] so when they threw jonah overboard he
[1:18:18] barely got wet because right into it
[1:18:21] now he's in the stomach of the fish
[1:18:23] yeah
[1:18:24] it was a special fish because it had
[1:18:26] oxygen okay
[1:18:29] that was the only benefit
[1:18:30] there was no light no nothing and all of
[1:18:33] a sudden it says right there in the
[1:18:34] bible had seaweed you know around his
[1:18:36] neck
[1:18:38] he's in bad shape
[1:18:39] okay it's soft everywhere oh man this is
[1:18:41] this is weird
[1:18:43] he didn't know how long he's going to be
[1:18:44] in there he thought might be from now on
[1:18:46] he didn't know right and so but the
[1:18:48] thing is there's no surprises with god
[1:18:51] it's a special fish
[1:18:52] and everything he touched you know was
[1:18:54] was you know
[1:18:56] soft and
[1:18:57] oh you can imagine he couldn't see
[1:18:59] symptoms were everywhere
[1:19:02] next time you think you got it bad
[1:19:04] for whatever reason
[1:19:06] get your bible out
[1:19:09] uh-huh you got it we got it pretty nice
[1:19:11] here
[1:19:12] so he had plenty of time
[1:19:15] to focus on the decisions he made in
[1:19:17] chapter three here in verse three but
[1:19:20] jonah arose to go from the presence of
[1:19:22] the lord
[1:19:24] oh now we're going to cover this don't
[1:19:25] worry we're not we're not going to leave
[1:19:26] him in hell we're going to he comes back
[1:19:29] so he learned right away to keep his
[1:19:30] mouth shut
[1:19:32] i mean you can imagine
[1:19:34] bad enough yet smell it you know
[1:19:36] and
[1:19:38] so um he decided these symptoms are all
[1:19:41] lying vanities now he could touch he
[1:19:43] could taste
[1:19:45] he couldn't see
[1:19:46] he could hear he could smell
[1:19:48] but god gave him oxygen okay
[1:19:51] and he prayed earnestly he didn't see
[1:19:54] thank you lord for the hamburger
[1:19:55] goodnight no a little more than that
[1:19:58] right no no
[1:19:59] because he was on unforeseen
[1:20:01] circumstances well i thought it was
[1:20:03] going to be different according to my
[1:20:05] calculations i mean how many times have
[1:20:06] you heard that well yeah brother john i
[1:20:09] seen the way i got it figured out well
[1:20:10] solomon said it's all vanity yeah so
[1:20:13] save the save the effort
[1:20:15] so the symptoms are very real and he had
[1:20:19] to ignore the present reality and focus
[1:20:21] his mind on the word of god
[1:20:23] he didn't have an ipad didn't have a
[1:20:25] cassette recorder didn't have spoken
[1:20:27] word book he had nothing
[1:20:30] only what he'd stored see
[1:20:33] so
[1:20:34] um he he got very serious about praying
[1:20:37] and he didn't know it was only going to
[1:20:39] be
[1:20:39] three days
[1:20:41] brother brahm says the devils tremble
[1:20:42] when the weakest of saints goes to their
[1:20:44] knees
[1:20:45] what a power and privilege has been
[1:20:47] given to the church of the living god
[1:20:50] when you fall to your knees in prayer
[1:20:52] even the devils tremble
[1:20:55] to the weakest of them think of it and
[1:20:57] the weakest christian here tonight can
[1:20:59] defeat satan anywhere
[1:21:01] anyplace anytime under any circumstances
[1:21:04] with thus saith the lord amen
[1:21:07] just believe it
[1:21:09] here god sends mighty prophet elijah
[1:21:12] into the most you know fantastic age of
[1:21:15] all ages they didn't have cell phones in
[1:21:17] but they got a lot of other stuff
[1:21:19] they had nice cars and you know
[1:21:21] 1965 had some good stuff
[1:21:23] but he sends profit with only believe
[1:21:26] that was the size of his message
[1:21:29] he didn't come to combat all the science
[1:21:32] no
[1:21:33] so why was why was jonah in this
[1:21:36] situation now it looks like so
[1:21:38] apparently is the key word key word here
[1:21:41] apparently he shirked away
[1:21:44] apparently he evaded his duty he ran
[1:21:46] from responsibility he ran from the
[1:21:48] presence of god he ran from the will of
[1:21:51] god and opted for his own will i want to
[1:21:54] do it this way you see remember my will
[1:21:57] or god's will
[1:21:58] only the fellowship was broken not the
[1:22:00] relationship
[1:22:02] so every one of you had to make a
[1:22:03] decision today amen now you're looking
[1:22:06] at one person i hope everything's
[1:22:07] straight you know but i'm looking at all
[1:22:09] the different colors some are smiling
[1:22:11] some are thinking about walmart some are
[1:22:13] thinking about lunch you know
[1:22:15] i'm not a prophet but i know people
[1:22:18] so you made a choice
[1:22:21] some people are still on the couch with
[1:22:22] their favorite friend the remote you
[1:22:24] know
[1:22:26] but we have three kinds of believers in
[1:22:27] every group
[1:22:28] so jonah made a choice and he was
[1:22:30] willing to pay the price
[1:22:32] and go his own way that's right okay now
[1:22:35] we're going to get to hear how serious
[1:22:36] it is here in a minute
[1:22:38] he just didn't have any idea how high
[1:22:40] the price was going to be
[1:22:41] see
[1:22:42] he chose to go the opposite direction
[1:22:45] okay so we're in fenton
[1:22:47] and god says go to toronto
[1:22:49] and he says
[1:22:51] i think i'll go to indianapolis instead
[1:22:54] 180 degrees
[1:22:56] basically
[1:22:57] and so um he probably thought well you
[1:22:59] know there's probably centers over in
[1:23:01] tarsus i'll go preach over there not so
[1:23:03] much hassle you know
[1:23:05] and god would have blessed the word
[1:23:07] regardless but obedience is far better
[1:23:10] than sacrifice okay
[1:23:12] and um uh i'm sure that we all have
[1:23:15] testimonies to that effect but you see
[1:23:17] if we look at the the catholics the
[1:23:19] baptist charismatics they're all using
[1:23:21] the same bible yes right you know got a
[1:23:23] little bit of twist to it but it's the
[1:23:24] same word of god
[1:23:26] and many are being blessed many are
[1:23:28] being healed there's miracles because
[1:23:30] they believe they're approaching god
[1:23:31] that's the only channel they know you
[1:23:34] know and then they see some of us our
[1:23:36] weirdo people
[1:23:37] blasted them bro around said your
[1:23:39] neighbors don't care what brother
[1:23:40] branham said they want to see the
[1:23:42] reality of the word
[1:23:44] god honors faith
[1:23:46] and he has provided a way
[1:23:49] some of us are tuned in you know so over
[1:23:52] here in thirsting for life 1960 the
[1:23:54] prophet says and this great pillar of
[1:23:56] fire the angel of god the logos that
[1:23:58] went out of god that led the children of
[1:24:00] israel to the wilderness when it came
[1:24:02] amongst the people the day of pentecost
[1:24:05] it separated itself and great looks of
[1:24:06] fire began to come down on each one as a
[1:24:08] pillar fire began to break up
[1:24:10] god dividing himself among his people
[1:24:13] oh that ought to tear the heart out of
[1:24:14] anybody god tearing himself apart that
[1:24:17] he might divide himself a little bit to
[1:24:18] each one of us
[1:24:20] so then he says he says can you see why
[1:24:23] i'm standing for the unity of every
[1:24:24] church
[1:24:25] now we know that's not exactly the end
[1:24:27] of the story that's a comma there
[1:24:29] yeah he wasn't trying to get all the
[1:24:30] people together
[1:24:32] unity of every church
[1:24:34] every full gospel church okay starts
[1:24:36] narrowing down every believer
[1:24:38] we're trying to get the believers
[1:24:39] together we ought to be of one heart one
[1:24:42] mind one accord no matter how much we
[1:24:43] differ in scriptures
[1:24:46] or our favorite quotations today
[1:24:49] he says that might be
[1:24:51] one might see it this way
[1:24:53] or that way has nothing to do with it
[1:24:56] but in principle we ought to stand one
[1:24:58] great mighty army of god marching on
[1:25:00] because each one of you in your
[1:25:03] peculiarity
[1:25:06] okay i don't have a beard
[1:25:09] john doesn't have a mustache
[1:25:11] you know the women wear dresses we're
[1:25:13] all peculiar
[1:25:15] you know i'm looking at all the peculiar
[1:25:16] you're looking at one person
[1:25:18] so he says
[1:25:19] um
[1:25:20] because each one of you in your
[1:25:21] peculiarity god has proved that is
[1:25:24] ignoring your doctrine oh man why'd you
[1:25:26] have to put that in there we made our
[1:25:28] doctrine perfect
[1:25:29] he says he can ignore it forget it
[1:25:33] he says god has proved that he's
[1:25:34] ignoring your doctrine because he gave
[1:25:36] you the holy ghost and the bible said he
[1:25:37] gave them the holy ghost that obeyed him
[1:25:40] acts 5 32 now if i obey him in my
[1:25:43] peculiar way
[1:25:44] and you obey him in your peculiar way he
[1:25:47] gave us both the holy ghost
[1:25:49] so we ought to be christian brethren and
[1:25:51] sister enough
[1:25:53] to arm up together that doesn't mean a
[1:25:54] single file that's across this way arm
[1:25:56] up together and march on for one great
[1:25:59] purpose the gospel
[1:26:01] and that's what we said in the early
[1:26:02] part about the missionary work it
[1:26:04] doesn't matter
[1:26:05] your doctrine doesn't matter
[1:26:07] you've got to be christians
[1:26:10] but see to us who who have accepted
[1:26:12] god's plan for the 21st century he's
[1:26:15] revealed to us the mysteries of the
[1:26:17] kingdom
[1:26:19] and that's that's just what
[1:26:21] it it maps out in the church age book
[1:26:23] okay there's there's truth reached time
[1:26:26] but like in the fifth age with martin
[1:26:27] luther christ alone because they were
[1:26:30] into candles and beads and all kinds of
[1:26:32] stuff
[1:26:33] we've got the same thing today look
[1:26:36] there's people in south america burning
[1:26:37] candles to william brandon's picture
[1:26:40] because they're just catholics with
[1:26:41] another you know picture
[1:26:45] so god doesn't hold those people out
[1:26:46] there accountable for what you know
[1:26:49] he has trusted you with his secrets
[1:26:52] the fullness of the revelation see
[1:26:54] god has a perfect will and he's got a
[1:26:56] permissive will okay
[1:26:58] and for every one of us
[1:27:00] brother ram says we try to work on god's
[1:27:02] permissive will and he will permit it
[1:27:05] but also if we take his permissive will
[1:27:07] though it's not right he will make his
[1:27:09] permissive will work out to glorify his
[1:27:11] perfect will
[1:27:13] he will bring you into line it's going
[1:27:15] to cost you you made a choice but he'll
[1:27:17] bring in the lamb
[1:27:19] so another place he says we must submit
[1:27:21] ourselves to his will and his and to his
[1:27:24] word
[1:27:24] don't question it believe it see we're
[1:27:27] back to only believe
[1:27:30] don't try to find a way around it just
[1:27:32] take it the way it is somebody wants to
[1:27:34] go around get some other way and when
[1:27:36] you do you find yourself going on you
[1:27:37] find yourself you find god blessing you
[1:27:40] but you're working in his permissive
[1:27:42] will and not his perfect divine will
[1:27:45] so i faced questions in a lot of places
[1:27:48] and thank god that he
[1:27:50] didn't anoint the pastor to
[1:27:52] tell me watch us have questions and
[1:27:54] answers well that'll be your problem
[1:27:56] but
[1:27:57] i've been in many places in english or
[1:27:59] spanish and they have questions one time
[1:28:02] i was speaking to a
[1:28:04] group of people it was like a fellowship
[1:28:06] meeting so at three o'clock it was my
[1:28:07] turn
[1:28:08] and it was going to be couples only so
[1:28:10] i'm supposed to give them some
[1:28:12] you know wise words since i was married
[1:28:13] 40 years surely i know something you
[1:28:15] know so we're talking and here comes
[1:28:17] questions
[1:28:18] there right now they want to they want
[1:28:19] to answer no time to go check it out
[1:28:22] what's the answer to this
[1:28:23] so the only one i remember um
[1:28:27] this sister wrote a little question she
[1:28:29] said brother george
[1:28:30] um
[1:28:31] i've been living with this man for 27
[1:28:33] years okay so they're not married
[1:28:35] strike one
[1:28:37] and um and lately he's been kind of mean
[1:28:39] to me in fact he says i've been sleeping
[1:28:40] in another room for 10 months and we got
[1:28:42] three sons two are married one's on the
[1:28:44] way out the door you know
[1:28:46] and uh okay so she's hurting and she
[1:28:48] says what shall i do
[1:28:50] well i gotta have an answer
[1:28:52] i said you go home pick your stuff up
[1:28:54] and leave you don't owe nothing
[1:28:56] there's no paper there's no you're not
[1:28:57] married
[1:28:59] i don't know what she did i said he's
[1:29:00] gonna kill you if you stay there
[1:29:02] so i don't know what she did but so i
[1:29:04] don't run from questions okay
[1:29:07] and so people ask me how can i know
[1:29:09] god's perfect will
[1:29:10] okay real simple
[1:29:13] god's word god's spirit and god's will
[1:29:16] always run in parallel
[1:29:18] they never cross
[1:29:20] god's word is his will his spirit
[1:29:22] anoints you to read it and understand it
[1:29:24] so the word the spirit and the will
[1:29:26] always run in parallel they agree
[1:29:29] and they run in harmony
[1:29:32] some people have a portion of the word
[1:29:34] memorized you know their favorite quotes
[1:29:36] right to the letter
[1:29:37] but somewhere the wires are crossed and
[1:29:39] they display a contrary spirit
[1:29:42] not good there's no harmony with the
[1:29:43] rest of the word and that results in
[1:29:46] fruit that is contrary to the word
[1:29:48] john 4 23
[1:29:50] jesus said now god is looking for people
[1:29:52] that will worship god in spirit and in
[1:29:55] truth
[1:29:57] not all spirit and not all truth
[1:30:01] we've got extremes but he wants it
[1:30:04] balanced in spirit and in truth
[1:30:07] exactly
[1:30:10] they asked brother brown a question 1961
[1:30:12] how do you feel is the best way to find
[1:30:14] the lord's will in some important
[1:30:15] matters that's a good question all of
[1:30:17] our things i mean you got important
[1:30:18] matters right right yeah
[1:30:20] facing stuff
[1:30:22] he says i tell you dear friend the best
[1:30:23] way to find the will of god in some
[1:30:25] important matters is prayer
[1:30:28] well we already knew that that's like
[1:30:30] naming
[1:30:31] water what's this i got better water
[1:30:33] where i live
[1:30:34] okay
[1:30:35] prayer now here's the way i do it i take
[1:30:38] it before the lord and it's always been
[1:30:39] my strength i wait upon the lord see
[1:30:41] what he says
[1:30:42] and i just let myself be neutral oh
[1:30:44] neutral are you kidding
[1:30:46] we want our red car
[1:30:50] we don't want no
[1:30:51] so neutral is very difficult for us
[1:30:53] especially america
[1:30:55] don't take either side so if i was in
[1:30:57] your place and didn't have these visions
[1:30:59] okay so he did have a bit of a handicap
[1:31:00] right and i didn't have these visions
[1:31:03] from the lord i would just wait upon the
[1:31:04] lord if i was you now lord you show me
[1:31:07] what to do show me what the decision to
[1:31:09] make here and then the way you feel led
[1:31:11] to do it okay so now you're aiming in a
[1:31:13] certain direction then just wait a
[1:31:15] little bit wait
[1:31:16] yes americans don't wait
[1:31:19] we want it now
[1:31:21] i know a guy down north carolina and and
[1:31:23] he's a big coffee drinker but if he goes
[1:31:26] by starbucks and there's four cars he
[1:31:28] goes across the street
[1:31:30] not gonna wait no so he says if you you
[1:31:33] pray and you start
[1:31:35] going a certain direction just i would
[1:31:36] just wait upon the lord
[1:31:38] and um and then wait a little bit longer
[1:31:41] and then wait
[1:31:42] how many times you got to wait yeah
[1:31:44] and see which side he's really leading
[1:31:46] you you know
[1:31:47] you say now father in my heart you know
[1:31:49] it doesn't matter
[1:31:51] i want to know what you want to do about
[1:31:52] it
[1:31:54] amen
[1:31:55] now you can be there's another thing we
[1:31:57] got to put in here brother brown says
[1:31:59] you can be too humble and be a tool of
[1:32:02] the devil
[1:32:03] you play thing of the devil you got to
[1:32:04] stand firm but you got to know what
[1:32:06] you're doing
[1:32:08] okay so with jonah god did make his
[1:32:11] permissive will to turn around to
[1:32:13] accomplish his perfect will it did work
[1:32:15] out
[1:32:16] this special fish delivered joan on the
[1:32:18] shore and the word of the lord came to
[1:32:21] him once more
[1:32:22] now
[1:32:24] we have heard brother brahm tell this
[1:32:25] story many times
[1:32:28] and so when i listen and you know he
[1:32:30] says now check it out with the word well
[1:32:31] i already read the book of john a few
[1:32:33] times
[1:32:34] it didn't quite add up so i thought what
[1:32:36] are we going to do here we got none of
[1:32:38] over here we've got tarshish over here
[1:32:41] and the fish is in the mediterranean
[1:32:44] now for that story to even be true the
[1:32:46] fish has got to go
[1:32:47] out through spain come all the way
[1:32:49] around africa and come up and go up this
[1:32:51] river
[1:32:54] i got a problem here
[1:32:55] so then i heard him say yeah i read that
[1:32:57] in the book oh thank you okay so you
[1:33:00] read that in the book sounds good but
[1:33:01] it's not true
[1:33:03] because over here in the bible in verse
[1:33:05] one and two of chapter three
[1:33:08] okay he's been in the fish this is
[1:33:09] already the third day
[1:33:12] and the word of the lord came into jonah
[1:33:13] the second time i see up here on in
[1:33:15] chapter 2 and verse 10 and the lord
[1:33:18] spake unto the fish yeah that can happen
[1:33:20] and it vomited out jonah upon the dry
[1:33:22] land
[1:33:24] any of you that raised kids you know
[1:33:26] what it's like when you're on a long
[1:33:27] trip
[1:33:28] and they get sick
[1:33:30] and you know it comes to stuff
[1:33:34] well that's what jonah looked like he's
[1:33:36] covered in whale vomit
[1:33:38] total i mean hair
[1:33:40] everything now
[1:33:41] on dry land
[1:33:43] now he's rolling in the sand
[1:33:47] not good
[1:33:49] the only thing he can do is go down to
[1:33:50] car wash and
[1:33:52] you know get some new clothes and go
[1:33:55] so chapter three and verse one and the
[1:33:56] word of the lord came unto jonah the
[1:33:58] second time
[1:34:00] arise go to nineveh great city and
[1:34:02] preach to it the preaching that i bid
[1:34:04] thee so if this story about the fish or
[1:34:06] what brother bran read if that was even
[1:34:09] true
[1:34:10] why would it say the golden interview
[1:34:12] he's there walked out and okay well it
[1:34:14] didn't happen that way he's vomited out
[1:34:16] close to where he got on the boat in
[1:34:18] israel now he's got to get cleaned up
[1:34:20] and go where he's supposed to go in the
[1:34:21] first place
[1:34:23] okay
[1:34:24] so
[1:34:25] um
[1:34:26] the the moral here is that
[1:34:28] he had a second chance
[1:34:30] now god could have let the fish just die
[1:34:32] you know
[1:34:34] be done with it no get another chance
[1:34:37] get yourself together go preach against
[1:34:40] the sin and so forth
[1:34:42] so you might not have a second chance
[1:34:45] see some there's decisions in life you
[1:34:47] make it once
[1:34:48] it's for life
[1:34:50] now marriage is like that that's why you
[1:34:52] got to be sure
[1:34:54] yeah when you find her be sure
[1:34:56] yeah it's for life
[1:34:58] it's not until summertime
[1:35:01] now a long time ago
[1:35:03] in um
[1:35:04] 1955 i might have said this the other
[1:35:06] night about the ten commandments
[1:35:12] okay so so anyway they watched the movie
[1:35:14] in 1955 and brother brown's taking the
[1:35:16] family home and so rebecca is like nine
[1:35:19] years old and she's crying
[1:35:21] what's the matter honey you know what's
[1:35:23] to her it was like a newsreel you know
[1:35:25] and so she said well dad you see where
[1:35:27] the where the on the film there that the
[1:35:29] moses said now all you saw on the lord's
[1:35:31] side come here it's over watching those
[1:35:32] people go well she was watching those
[1:35:33] people that stood behind and they went
[1:35:35] down you know that's what she was
[1:35:37] focusing on and they didn't have a
[1:35:39] chance he said let this be a lesson to
[1:35:41] you when god says something you do it
[1:35:43] now
[1:35:44] not when everything lines up you know
[1:35:46] take a vote now
[1:35:48] and so that's what you know jonah he had
[1:35:50] a second chance those people didn't have
[1:35:51] a second chance
[1:35:53] so after he got cleaned up he went and
[1:35:55] preached under powerful anointing you
[1:35:57] read all through chapter three it
[1:35:59] records the reaction of the people to
[1:36:01] the preaching of the word of god
[1:36:03] the greatest revival recorded in history
[1:36:07] the entire city of 120 000 turned to god
[1:36:10] stayed back the wrath of god they made a
[1:36:12] choice repent or perish with the
[1:36:15] unbeliever
[1:36:16] but guess what the other part of the
[1:36:18] story that you probably didn't know
[1:36:19] about 150 years later
[1:36:21] they entirely departed from god just
[1:36:24] like the us of a
[1:36:26] this was a different country 150 years
[1:36:28] ago
[1:36:29] way different
[1:36:31] if you want a real blessing go study the
[1:36:34] um
[1:36:35] the facts about the welsh revival
[1:36:39] it was only a few months
[1:36:42] 1904 1905 long or whatever it was just a
[1:36:44] few months
[1:36:46] very very different from today so these
[1:36:48] people 150 years later completely
[1:36:50] departed from god they forgot about the
[1:36:52] mercy the forgiveness and god permitted
[1:36:55] the babylonians to come down in the year
[1:36:57] 621 bc
[1:36:58] and utterly destroy the city
[1:37:01] now they didn't have dynamite they
[1:37:02] didn't have missiles you know bulldozers
[1:37:05] no so devastating was the destruction
[1:37:07] that the ruins were only discovered
[1:37:09] about a hundred years ago
[1:37:11] 2500 years later oh here's where nineveh
[1:37:15] was
[1:37:17] obliterated
[1:37:19] we don't know what they did
[1:37:21] and so
[1:37:22] um
[1:37:23] such a hatred to destroy even even
[1:37:25] schofield he says a lot of good things
[1:37:27] he says such is the way of god light
[1:37:29] rejected brings destruction
[1:37:32] amen now brother abraham said this over
[1:37:34] 1956 he said now this year i believe you
[1:37:36] know they're going to make a decision so
[1:37:38] forth
[1:37:39] life goes on he has a powerful ministry
[1:37:41] you know all things happen
[1:37:43] now here we are all these years later
[1:37:46] and we're seeing the fulfillment he
[1:37:48] warned back there
[1:37:49] you've lived long enough i've lived long
[1:37:51] enough to see
[1:37:52] that
[1:37:53] hey it's true he always warns first
[1:37:56] and we're seeing the prophecy fulfilled
[1:37:58] now
[1:37:59] everywhere you look you cannot look in
[1:38:01] your phone without seeing hatred malice
[1:38:04] perversion
[1:38:05] it's everywhere
[1:38:07] you know
[1:38:08] so jonah was in fact a crucial part of a
[1:38:12] very large picture
[1:38:14] now i know some of you got spare time
[1:38:16] and you like to work puzzles right i
[1:38:18] don't have that kind of time
[1:38:20] my daughter oh she loves puzzles she
[1:38:22] gets the most she'll get a you know a
[1:38:24] whole ocean in one boat you know i put
[1:38:27] that together kind of stuff
[1:38:29] i don't have the kind of time
[1:38:31] but um
[1:38:32] he was part of a much bigger picture so
[1:38:34] when you're putting together a puzzle
[1:38:36] especially one with you know houses and
[1:38:38] trees and whatever well there's colors
[1:38:40] that you don't like there's part of it
[1:38:44] okay it's part of the picture find it
[1:38:46] put it in there so he was part of a much
[1:38:48] bigger picture so much so that it was
[1:38:50] repeated by our lord once in matthew
[1:38:52] chapter 12.
[1:38:54] so
[1:38:55] when you don't fully understand
[1:38:57] why brother john chose a certain color
[1:39:00] for the walls over there
[1:39:04] just leave it alone
[1:39:07] when you don't understand an issue or
[1:39:08] something that's going on be careful
[1:39:12] it could be part of a bigger picture
[1:39:13] it's there for a reason you know
[1:39:15] and god allows these scenes to play out
[1:39:18] in order to bring our reactions to the
[1:39:20] surface
[1:39:22] be careful amen god has not called me or
[1:39:25] any of you to straighten everything out
[1:39:29] years ago when i was working over in
[1:39:31] jeffersonville with billy paul you're
[1:39:33] 75 way back there someplace
[1:39:36] uh so i forget what was going on but i
[1:39:38] said you know what really if i was god i
[1:39:40] just
[1:39:42] wipe off the whole thing and start over
[1:39:44] well it's a good thing i wasn't you know
[1:39:47] but
[1:39:48] god didn't call me to straighten it all
[1:39:49] out and and straighten out the things
[1:39:51] that i think are not in order
[1:39:53] it would seem that god's man god's
[1:39:55] prophet of the age god's anointed
[1:39:56] messenger it seemed like he was
[1:39:58] backslidden and stepped out of the will
[1:40:00] of god it seemed that way
[1:40:01] it seemed that way because we as mortals
[1:40:04] with our little bitty chicken brains
[1:40:08] we're very small creatures that we are
[1:40:10] we don't have all the facts we don't
[1:40:11] know why
[1:40:12] you know
[1:40:14] we make knee-jerk reactions
[1:40:16] with partial information amen
[1:40:19] now when you go through the airport
[1:40:20] here's people walking through the
[1:40:22] airport a little thing in there and
[1:40:23] they're just talking along there's
[1:40:24] nobody around
[1:40:26] you know
[1:40:27] but they're talking so if i listen long
[1:40:30] enough i can make a a judgment on what's
[1:40:32] going on because i've only heard half
[1:40:34] the conversation you know and that's the
[1:40:36] way we are we only know part of what's
[1:40:38] going on
[1:40:39] we make these judgments
[1:40:41] and
[1:40:42] very few people of any given age
[1:40:45] of any given generation recognize the
[1:40:47] real value of the message of god during
[1:40:49] their day okay hindsight oh you can see
[1:40:52] it all hindsight yeah
[1:40:54] simeon you know lived near the temple in
[1:40:56] fact he lived right next door in uh in
[1:40:58] the scripture
[1:41:00] and he was old and he thought he was
[1:41:03] going to die but god said to him now son
[1:41:05] you're not going to die until you've
[1:41:07] seen
[1:41:08] the salvation until you've seen this
[1:41:10] sign that i'm going to give you
[1:41:12] so every time there was baby dedication
[1:41:14] he'd go out there and he'd look
[1:41:15] no no sign today go back to bed we don't
[1:41:18] know how long it went on but one day
[1:41:19] he's out there he saw the sign that god
[1:41:21] told him to look for
[1:41:22] so he goes right up to mary so only
[1:41:24] simeon and joseph and mary knew what was
[1:41:27] going on rest of them
[1:41:29] no big deal
[1:41:30] and so he let me have the baby okay
[1:41:33] mine eyes have seen thy salvation i can
[1:41:35] depart in peace
[1:41:36] you know
[1:41:38] and um but uh he was only a few that
[1:41:41] recognized god in present tense
[1:41:45] now 1957 questions and answers
[1:41:48] this city of jeffersonville or we could
[1:41:50] put fenton or
[1:41:51] whatever city at the day of the judgment
[1:41:54] we'll answer a great price someday
[1:41:56] for there have been hundreds and
[1:41:58] hundreds of outstanding healings done
[1:41:59] right here
[1:42:01] that's right right here signs and
[1:42:03] wonders and the appearing of the angel
[1:42:04] down here at the river
[1:42:06] and the papers blasting it and still
[1:42:09] people don't believe why is it
[1:42:10] he says this is 1957.
[1:42:13] you got to get the picture here's a
[1:42:14] small tabernacle
[1:42:16] a pulpit looks like he's made out of
[1:42:17] orange crates you know
[1:42:19] and um
[1:42:20] sound system not working real good and
[1:42:23] across the river
[1:42:24] from jeffersonville was the capital of
[1:42:27] tobacco
[1:42:28] whiskey
[1:42:30] all that was going on over there
[1:42:32] big baptist seminary big presbyterian
[1:42:34] seminary big catholic seminary just
[1:42:36] across the river
[1:42:38] so here we are he says why is that
[1:42:40] someday i'm going to leave here
[1:42:43] uh i'm 48 years old this was in uh
[1:42:46] october of 57.
[1:42:49] why didn't the world recognize that
[1:42:50] picture why don't they catch those
[1:42:52] things right quick why don't they catch
[1:42:53] these other things why don't they catch
[1:42:55] these prophecies
[1:42:56] you know they can't do it but one day
[1:42:58] i'm going to leave this world and when i
[1:43:00] leave they will recognize it
[1:43:03] now those of you that know a little bit
[1:43:04] of math are coming up on 56 years you've
[1:43:06] been gone
[1:43:07] some of you young people will realize
[1:43:08] that after i'm gone
[1:43:10] this day this scripture has been
[1:43:12] fulfilled
[1:43:14] the harvest time 1964. but what did the
[1:43:16] lutherans do after the death of martin
[1:43:18] luther
[1:43:20] they met satan and made a denomination
[1:43:23] and died
[1:43:25] never did anything else just a bunch of
[1:43:27] people
[1:43:29] right down the street
[1:43:31] two tapes that you need to listen to
[1:43:33] carefully uh are the two tapes from
[1:43:38] april
[1:43:39] of 1963. this is the first time after
[1:43:42] the seals he's in a different atmosphere
[1:43:44] not the pressure of the people's
[1:43:46] christian businessmen deal he's in
[1:43:48] albuquerque new mexico april 63.
[1:43:52] world falling apart and god in
[1:43:54] simplicity i believe
[1:43:55] in the world falling apart he says you
[1:43:57] might not believe that but this is taped
[1:43:59] listen to it a few years from today if
[1:44:01] there is such and then you will know
[1:44:03] whether it's true or not whatever he was
[1:44:05] talking about just before this
[1:44:07] one day when the evening lights are
[1:44:08] breaking and it's too late then you'll
[1:44:10] say
[1:44:10] that man could have been right
[1:44:12] but it's too late then
[1:44:14] just exactly like jesus said when he was
[1:44:16] here on earth quote god sent you
[1:44:18] prophets down through the ages every
[1:44:20] time the world system religious system
[1:44:22] had fallen apart and what did you do
[1:44:23] with each one god sent the prophet you
[1:44:26] all killed them put them in the grave
[1:44:27] exactly
[1:44:28] and then in about another generation you
[1:44:30] wake up and realize that was a prophet
[1:44:32] and then what you do you garnish the
[1:44:34] tomb you know make it look nice what do
[1:44:36] you do you make a tradition of his life
[1:44:41] and that is exactly what israel had done
[1:44:43] moses they made a tradition of his life
[1:44:46] yesterday they were all in their
[1:44:47] synagogues around the world and they had
[1:44:49] a portion of moses that they read
[1:44:52] prophet said prophet said
[1:44:54] okay
[1:44:55] still going on
[1:44:57] he says
[1:44:58] moses made a tradition of his life
[1:45:00] that's the way we do with martin luther
[1:45:02] john wesley and other men huh wonder who
[1:45:04] that could be
[1:45:06] we're always looking back making a
[1:45:08] tradition of their life garnishing their
[1:45:10] tomb
[1:45:11] and their message was for another day
[1:45:14] by the time you wake up that day's done
[1:45:16] live by you're in another day the whole
[1:45:18] system has worked that way since the
[1:45:20] beginning man-made systems certainly
[1:45:23] so
[1:45:24] we got to face the music
[1:45:26] will brother brahms be like being
[1:45:28] exception to this rule i don't think so
[1:45:30] we've got people burning candles we've
[1:45:32] got people doing all kinds of things but
[1:45:34] there's a few of us that are
[1:45:36] looking at the word and we see that all
[1:45:39] this that he said is simply the
[1:45:42] manifestation of the word of god so
[1:45:44] simple you know
[1:45:45] so people just now are realizing the
[1:45:47] value of the message we've had the
[1:45:50] warning
[1:45:51] and when you don't understand something
[1:45:53] you don't have all the facts
[1:45:55] be careful
[1:45:57] psalm 46 10 be still and know that i am
[1:46:00] god
[1:46:02] so jonah was god's prophet but as human
[1:46:05] he looked for the easy way the way of no
[1:46:07] pressure
[1:46:08] everybody to agree with him yeah that's
[1:46:10] nice pat him on the back many times will
[1:46:13] god god will indicate his will to us in
[1:46:15] different ways
[1:46:16] then we go discussion with the relatives
[1:46:18] and what do you think what do you think
[1:46:20] i should do you know looking for a
[1:46:22] consensus looking for a vote people to
[1:46:24] agree with us we're looking for the easy
[1:46:26] way like jonah did
[1:46:28] brother brown says you have to struggle
[1:46:30] to do the will of god sometimes
[1:46:32] it's not always easy but it will produce
[1:46:34] the best results
[1:46:36] it's only 20 minutes 12 relax we've got
[1:46:38] time
[1:46:42] so today we have many message believers
[1:46:45] i call them book carriers
[1:46:47] a lot of people are simply carrying the
[1:46:49] books
[1:46:52] and they're willfully that is by their
[1:46:53] own self-will
[1:46:54] climbing onto boats headed for somewhere
[1:46:57] different they look like they're going
[1:46:59] in the same place it looks yeah they got
[1:47:01] the same kind of dress they look good
[1:47:04] yeah
[1:47:05] and um
[1:47:06] uh
[1:47:07] the boats are going a different way you
[1:47:09] see
[1:47:10] uh different fl from what god has
[1:47:12] ordained in his word
[1:47:15] now god told jonah to go northeast
[1:47:17] and he fled from the presence of god and
[1:47:20] went southwest exactly opposite
[1:47:23] today they're the boats that are
[1:47:25] available they're not going 180 degrees
[1:47:27] they're only one two degrees off you
[1:47:30] don't even notice it until it's too late
[1:47:32] you can't swim back you
[1:47:34] know uh go listen to anointing once at
[1:47:37] the end time you'll see that
[1:47:39] only too late are we finding out oh this
[1:47:41] is going to a different port this is
[1:47:42] yeah they're over there we're over here
[1:47:44] we've got a problem
[1:47:46] and then we begin to check out well this
[1:47:47] isn't even the old ship of messiah and
[1:47:49] it just kind of looks like it you know
[1:47:52] so
[1:47:53] we can have a we can have a leading
[1:47:56] we can have a doctrine we can have a
[1:47:58] promise right out of the pages of the
[1:47:59] bible
[1:48:00] okay
[1:48:01] but if it's not in the proper season
[1:48:04] flowing in the will of god
[1:48:06] in the economy and the plan of god for
[1:48:07] the hour
[1:48:08] you will be fleeing from the presence of
[1:48:11] the living god just one degree off
[1:48:16] thinking and believing that you're right
[1:48:18] i know a bunch of those people you'll be
[1:48:20] choosing your will
[1:48:22] and not god's will right
[1:48:24] not having rightly divided
[1:48:26] the word of truth
[1:48:27] not paying attention to the ministry
[1:48:29] that god puts in place you know
[1:48:31] and there will be a price to play
[1:48:34] so it's very dark in laodicea
[1:48:36] brother braham says over here in
[1:48:37] revelations chapter four now
[1:48:40] he says they're so um they say well we
[1:48:42] don't we don't believe in saying hell in
[1:48:44] the pulpit we need men of god who won't
[1:48:47] hold back
[1:48:48] now everybody can't be a preacher
[1:48:51] but you've got a voice
[1:48:53] if you if you're a preacher you're
[1:48:55] called to the pulpit to preach if you're
[1:48:57] not you're still a preacher just live
[1:48:59] the people a sermon
[1:49:01] let your sermon be lived and it's the
[1:49:04] voice of god that will bring reproach to
[1:49:05] them that reject it just live your
[1:49:07] sermon
[1:49:08] that's why even your sisters we don't
[1:49:11] believe in having you up here it's just
[1:49:12] scripture you know that's why brother
[1:49:14] brown left the baptist church because
[1:49:15] they wanted to put them in
[1:49:17] one of the things
[1:49:18] so as you go to the store you got your
[1:49:21] hair you got your dress you're preaching
[1:49:24] and those that you know
[1:49:26] okay they've sealed their doom right
[1:49:27] there
[1:49:29] he says the preacher is called to preach
[1:49:32] his and live it also if you can't live
[1:49:34] it then stop preaching it
[1:49:37] oh i'd like to bring that down on a few
[1:49:39] friends of mine
[1:49:40] but you're supposed to live your sermons
[1:49:43] oh how we need in jeffersonville
[1:49:45] thousands of lived voices in other words
[1:49:47] people that actually it blooms out you
[1:49:49] know
[1:49:50] he says the thunder of god thundering
[1:49:52] out in sweetness holiness purity
[1:49:55] undefiled lives walking around in the
[1:49:57] earth today without a blemish
[1:50:00] yes sir real christians that's the
[1:50:02] thunder against the enemy the devil
[1:50:04] doesn't care how loud you can holler
[1:50:06] how much you can jump or whatever but
[1:50:08] what hurts the devil
[1:50:10] to see that sanctified holy life
[1:50:12] consecrated to god
[1:50:15] say anything you want to him call him
[1:50:16] anything
[1:50:18] he's just as sweet as he can be moves
[1:50:19] right on
[1:50:20] that throws him that's the thunder that
[1:50:22] shakes the devil
[1:50:24] now a long time ago like 900 years there
[1:50:27] was a man a preacher in italy called
[1:50:29] francis of assis
[1:50:31] the people that were in the catholic
[1:50:32] church probably remember well
[1:50:35] and so even in switzerland they had him
[1:50:37] on the on the money you know so brother
[1:50:39] brown said he was a gospel preacher
[1:50:41] and he said
[1:50:42] preach always
[1:50:44] use words when necessary
[1:50:47] brother brandon said the same thing live
[1:50:48] your sermon you see
[1:50:50] so they you know we all got these cell
[1:50:53] phones we know everything just zip it
[1:50:56] just live your sermon
[1:50:58] and when they ask a question that's
[1:51:00] because it has struck a chord and then
[1:51:03] you can open your bible because you've
[1:51:04] been in this church for years and you
[1:51:06] can show them the five comings of elijah
[1:51:08] oh i hadn't seen that
[1:51:10] what's there
[1:51:12] part of god's program
[1:51:13] you know and then they ask another
[1:51:15] question and you just let it out you've
[1:51:18] been bottling up for years just let it
[1:51:20] out
[1:51:22] we got a couple of tracks back there
[1:51:24] very good
[1:51:25] so if we turn our back on the word
[1:51:28] maybe not openly you know like jonah but
[1:51:30] only by indifference maybe by a bad
[1:51:32] attitude you know like john the baptist
[1:51:35] dad you know when he was there
[1:51:37] at the church just a little bit of fear
[1:51:40] okay
[1:51:41] nine months
[1:51:43] so if we just if we turn our back on the
[1:51:45] word we're fleeing from the presence of
[1:51:48] god just slightly we'll be following an
[1:51:50] antichrist spirit and an antichrist
[1:51:53] doctrine be careful
[1:51:55] and soon you will be anointed with
[1:51:56] arrogance
[1:51:58] selfishness self-righteous respective
[1:52:01] persons none of which comes from god
[1:52:04] so if we deviate one degree off a true
[1:52:07] center
[1:52:08] we can't hit the target
[1:52:12] i was with my son
[1:52:13] in africa
[1:52:15] and
[1:52:16] he knew that those guys had guns so he
[1:52:18] didn't take a gun
[1:52:19] but they had a big hunt organized so
[1:52:21] here we are in the back of the toyota
[1:52:23] you know bouncing along through the
[1:52:24] wilderness and they see an animal okay
[1:52:27] he doesn't know nothing about this gun
[1:52:28] but we've got to try it out so he shoots
[1:52:31] well he knew that he was high
[1:52:33] animals gone
[1:52:34] so what's he do well he's a hunter so he
[1:52:37] takes piece clean x puts it on a bush
[1:52:38] out there at 50 yards comes back over
[1:52:40] here dials the scope down to what he
[1:52:43] thought it should be
[1:52:45] shoots it
[1:52:46] goes over there or they all run with him
[1:52:48] you know
[1:52:49] they've never seen anything like that so
[1:52:50] wonder they kill anything
[1:52:52] and so he um
[1:52:54] he sees okay we almost got it so he
[1:52:56] comes back he dials it again
[1:52:59] you know
[1:53:00] and now they're out and he shoots
[1:53:02] they're all going to run again so aren't
[1:53:03] you coming no i know what he knows what
[1:53:05] he's doing it hit this time i'm sure
[1:53:08] well he was the hero wow you can
[1:53:10] actually make this gun hit where you
[1:53:11] want it to hit
[1:53:13] oh man
[1:53:15] but if it but if it's not zeroed in who
[1:53:17] knows where it's going to hit you know
[1:53:19] we don't have to be 180 degrees off just
[1:53:21] one degree you see and we assume that
[1:53:24] we're right we assume that he's with us
[1:53:27] you know like mary and joseph they've
[1:53:29] been down to the to the temple in
[1:53:30] jerusalem for the bar mitzvah and
[1:53:32] because jesus was raised jewish you know
[1:53:34] just facts
[1:53:35] and um
[1:53:36] and so they're all on the way home
[1:53:38] nazareth is a long ways away so they
[1:53:40] come to the first evening and they're
[1:53:41] gonna set up camp and get things ready
[1:53:44] big family
[1:53:46] and so mary says uh uh joseph where's
[1:53:48] the boy
[1:53:50] well i don't know and it's your turn to
[1:53:52] watch him
[1:53:54] well he wasn't there they assumed he was
[1:53:56] with them
[1:53:58] but he wasn't there so they didn't sleep
[1:54:00] too good that night and they went back
[1:54:02] and they found him but see they assumed
[1:54:04] he was with him they had left him behind
[1:54:06] they ventured off into make-believe
[1:54:08] leaving behind the promise of god for
[1:54:10] the hour
[1:54:12] and many are doing the same thing today
[1:54:14] thinking god is with them because they
[1:54:16] calculated a certain way
[1:54:18] we've got to be careful
[1:54:20] now when you read that story in the new
[1:54:21] testament about mary and joseph and you
[1:54:23] know leaving jesus behind
[1:54:25] look at her sorry attitude when they
[1:54:27] when they found him
[1:54:28] she didn't hold honey we're so glad well
[1:54:30] we missed you so much no she said
[1:54:33] baby why'd you do this to me you made me
[1:54:36] look bad yeah
[1:54:38] yeah that's what it says
[1:54:40] so we're almost done here um 1964
[1:54:44] looking unto jesus it's possible today
[1:54:46] that good men
[1:54:48] fine men walking with christ reading his
[1:54:50] word still don't recognize that this is
[1:54:53] the hour that certain things of this
[1:54:54] bible must be fulfilled yes sir they're
[1:54:57] all in these big churches right now it's
[1:54:59] the hour that we're living in the time
[1:55:01] is at hand when these things must be
[1:55:02] done it's written and this must it must
[1:55:05] be fulfilled because god promised it yes
[1:55:08] our eyes must be opened to see it now
[1:55:11] you can look at the word the pharisees
[1:55:13] had that word drawn out they had their
[1:55:15] things on the wall yeah this way and
[1:55:16] messiah and they had it all figured out
[1:55:19] exactly how he was coming they believed
[1:55:21] they were right nobody wants to be wrong
[1:55:24] even if people get caught by the police
[1:55:26] out here they they
[1:55:28] well maybe he'll let me buy i think
[1:55:29] they're kind of right no they're wrong
[1:55:32] see they believed they were right and
[1:55:34] here he was born and walked amongst them
[1:55:36] and they condemned him when he told him
[1:55:38] you all need to search the scriptures
[1:55:39] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:55:41] life right amen
[1:55:43] and they testify of
[1:55:45] us search the scriptures
[1:55:47] we are moses precise disciples they
[1:55:51] could trace their lineage all the way
[1:55:52] back no
[1:55:54] and um
[1:55:55] if you would be moses disciples you
[1:55:57] would know me because he wrote of me the
[1:56:00] lord your god shall raise up a prophet
[1:56:01] like in me a lawgiver and so forth and
[1:56:03] the people will hear see if they would
[1:56:05] have known moses writings they would
[1:56:08] have known him
[1:56:09] they thought they knew moses writings
[1:56:12] but they didn't know it
[1:56:13] and they were blinded to that so just a
[1:56:16] few words from him like that what they
[1:56:17] do
[1:56:18] well who's this guy think he is he's got
[1:56:20] a devil comes to teach us what school
[1:56:22] did he come from you know all that
[1:56:25] but they failed to look and see that the
[1:56:27] very god that promised the word was
[1:56:29] vindicating it right there through the
[1:56:30] person of jesus christ he was the light
[1:56:33] of the hour he was the light for the
[1:56:34] people to walk in the only word of god
[1:56:37] and only the word of god produces light
[1:56:39] only god's word produces light it's not
[1:56:42] anywhere else not james dobson or
[1:56:43] nothing it's the word
[1:56:47] so god's word produces the sunshine
[1:56:49] god's word produces the earth god's word
[1:56:52] produces the air
[1:56:54] everything is the word of god made
[1:56:55] manifest
[1:56:56] everything that's got a reality to it
[1:56:58] amen when he was here he said i am god
[1:57:00] and besides me there is no other
[1:57:03] so when you look at this
[1:57:05] earth that we
[1:57:07] you know we take care of and we farm it
[1:57:09] and we cut it we were so in love with
[1:57:11] our environment but if you stand out
[1:57:13] here in space and you're looking at it
[1:57:15] what's holding it up
[1:57:17] this ball is is over here you know it's
[1:57:19] all working perfectly
[1:57:21] they can tell you exactly when the
[1:57:23] eclipse will start you know in 2030
[1:57:26] all this is perfect
[1:57:28] man can't do that
[1:57:30] our finest watch it goes bad
[1:57:32] so
[1:57:33] it's all god's word so look around
[1:57:37] be you know sensitive discern your
[1:57:39] surroundings be thankful for what you
[1:57:41] have
[1:57:41] you know check it up because our life
[1:57:44] our doctrine and our experience has to
[1:57:46] match god's word
[1:57:48] not your imagination not explanations
[1:57:51] because we cannot afford to live
[1:57:53] uh any longer in a glare we got to have
[1:57:56] god in reality
[1:57:57] live for today yes prepare for tomorrow
[1:58:00] from terry's because we're on a journey
[1:58:02] we're going someplace
[1:58:04] okay now this has two purposes
[1:58:06] and i hate to tell you one purpose to
[1:58:08] stay level
[1:58:09] the other one is to stay awake
[1:58:15] so
[1:58:16] um
[1:58:17] we're going somewhere there's a gate to
[1:58:19] the resurrection that's where we're
[1:58:20] headed you know we will get there
[1:58:23] so
[1:58:24] um we have
[1:58:26] certain spirits amongst our malachi 4
[1:58:29] ranks
[1:58:30] we got religious tourists okay
[1:58:32] accumulating souvenirs
[1:58:34] and
[1:58:35] arguing about the details of the text
[1:58:38] you know
[1:58:39] and burning religious candles but they
[1:58:41] have no relationship with jesus christ
[1:58:43] author and finisher of our faith
[1:58:46] and we all have a choice you can go the
[1:58:48] way of the crowd or you can stick with
[1:58:51] the word you know
[1:58:54] so what do we have here
[1:58:56] a couple more quotes here pay attention
[1:58:58] uh 1957 stand at the door and knock well
[1:59:01] that's the way it is today with people
[1:59:02] who call themselves christians
[1:59:04] you say oh i belong to church that's
[1:59:06] good but you see the reason there's so
[1:59:08] much trouble ah here we go
[1:59:10] the reason there's so much trouble in
[1:59:12] the church the reason there's so much
[1:59:13] confusion in the church so much
[1:59:14] discontentment in the church doesn't
[1:59:16] sound good does it is not because jesus
[1:59:19] is not there it is because that jesus
[1:59:22] can't gain access to the places he wants
[1:59:24] to go
[1:59:25] we have those little bitty compartments
[1:59:27] oh no don't touch that no you can come
[1:59:29] in jesus that's far enough
[1:59:31] i'll go to church otherwise i'll run my
[1:59:34] own business
[1:59:35] jesus wants to be supreme ruler of your
[1:59:37] being
[1:59:38] and the only way he can bless you is
[1:59:40] when he becomes your lord
[1:59:42] lord is rulership ownership you know he
[1:59:45] wants access to your entire life
[1:59:47] open your heart
[1:59:49] another place he says and when jesus
[1:59:51] comes in he wants to be welcomed right
[1:59:54] but we have those little secret doors
[1:59:56] little bitty doors in our heart that we
[1:59:58] don't want jesus in
[2:00:00] over to the right hand
[2:00:02] of the human heart after he gets in
[2:00:04] there's a little bitty door called pride
[2:00:06] oh i'll receive him as savior but don't
[2:00:09] tell me how i have to dress
[2:00:12] and the way i have to do
[2:00:14] if i have to let my hair grow if i have
[2:00:16] to stop smoking cigarettes or quit going
[2:00:19] to the pool hall
[2:00:21] etc etc
[2:00:22] i don't want nothing to do with it he
[2:00:24] says don't worry he won't stay too long
[2:00:28] very dangerous so you have a choice so
[2:00:31] if jesus isn't lord of all your life
[2:00:34] see
[2:00:36] he is calling you he's giving you
[2:00:37] another opportunity
[2:00:39] sunday september 12th
[2:00:42] see so all you gotta do is yield to yes
[2:00:44] yes lord i'll drop all my stuff
[2:00:47] i'll follow
[2:00:48] i'll get in the word
[2:00:50] whatever you show me you see
[2:00:52] we can pray with you he can change your
[2:00:54] will your desires and put you on the
[2:00:57] right road to fulfill his will
[2:01:00] the word says in first corinthians 2 9
[2:01:03] but it is written
[2:01:04] i have not seen ear has not heard
[2:01:07] neither has entered into the heart of
[2:01:08] man the things which god has prepared
[2:01:11] for them that love him
[2:01:14] but god has revealed them unto us by his
[2:01:16] spirit
[2:01:17] he's given us a prophet he's given us
[2:01:20] life to live
[2:01:21] and and you're healthy i mean how many
[2:01:24] people you know are sick laying in bed

[2:02:25] to become a church
[2:02:27] that's without spot without wrinkle that
[2:02:30] has been laying in the presence
[2:02:32] of the son
