[32:06] foreign
[32:11] I am blessed
[32:14] I'm already blessed amen
[32:17] it's
[32:18] wonderful to be in the presence of young
[32:22] people
[32:23] who want God in their life
[32:26] and as you know brother James was
[32:28] singing there and he was inviting us to
[32:31] come and worship with him to come and
[32:32] praise with him
[32:34] and
[32:35] I I my thoughts kept going to when Jesus
[32:38] said suffer not the Lord children forbid
[32:40] them not let them come to me I believe
[32:42] that God inhabits the Praises of young
[32:45] people
[32:47] and we just we need to recognize that
[32:50] God is God is all in all
[32:53] that's right and uh we just want to
[32:55] praise him and everything and and lift
[32:57] them up and everything and and uh I like
[33:00] our our brother Daryl said that
[33:04] our children are not the Church of
[33:06] tomorrow but they are of today that's
[33:07] right let's not wait till tomorrow
[33:09] because we may not have tomorrow
[33:11] and they can reach Souls just like we
[33:13] can amen
[33:15] and uh
[33:16] just a willing heart that's what brother
[33:18] Daryl said all we need is a willing
[33:20] heart a willing a vessel that's that's
[33:23] willing to yield to the Lord and just
[33:25] use me Lord
[33:27] well God bless you we wanted to take up
[33:29] the offering uh and what we we want to
[33:32] have take this offering for brother
[33:34] Daryl
[33:35] it's uh it's
[33:38] expensive to travel and we just
[33:41] appreciate brother Daryl
[33:43] I I don't uh wasn't there when he was
[33:47] converted don't know how he was when he
[33:49] was that young in the Lord but all the
[33:52] time that I've known him
[33:53] he's just been an extremely humble
[33:56] person
[33:57] I could say I I feel that he's he hasn't
[34:01] changed
[34:03] he's he's just as humble as at the
[34:06] beginning and he's been in great
[34:08] meetings he's been used of God in great
[34:12] ways but he's remained humble
[34:15] I could even say I believe he's more
[34:17] humble today because as you go through
[34:19] those things and you resist
[34:22] popularity you resist money you you
[34:25] resist Fame and you remain you're
[34:27] actually more humble because you've been
[34:29] tested and tried and you stayed true
[34:32] my brother was telling me just yesterday
[34:34] that he'll travel six hours driving
[34:38] just to go speak
[34:40] to a few people
[34:42] a half a dozen people
[34:45] and that's commendable amen
[34:48] amen and he's a true servant of God and
[34:50] so as we
[34:52] take up the offering today we pray just
[34:55] remember that you're given to God's
[34:57] servant
[34:58] and uh
[34:59] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[35:01] prayer we're going to ask our brother
[35:03] Johnson if he would to pray over the
[35:04] offering
[35:08] yes Lord
[35:20] thank you Jesus
[35:36] Francisco
[35:38] finally let's see
[35:46] a part of Europe
[35:49] thank you Merry Christmas
[35:52] your grace
[35:54] for your kindness
[35:56] to all of us
[35:58] questions
[36:05] amen amen praise the Lord as we remain
[36:08] standing let's receive him amen brother
[36:12] Daryl makes a statement that you will
[36:14] find him in the baptism of the Holy
[36:17] Ghost
[36:19] so I I want the baptism of the Holy
[36:22] Ghost because I want him if I got to get

[37:56] I'm so grateful that we know what to
[37:58] believe amen amen
[37:59] amen we kind of such an honor to be with
[38:01] you once again
[38:02] this morning and we just trusted what we
[38:05] have to say will be a blessing to you
[38:07] we feel like it's the direction that the
[38:09] Lord would want us to go and so whatever
[38:11] your need would be or whatever you would
[38:14] be facing just remember that no matter
[38:16] how great your sickness would be or how
[38:18] great your trial would be or your
[38:20] trouble would be it's not greater than
[38:22] your God
[38:24] it's not greater than your God and
[38:27] sometimes we have great trials just so
[38:29] that God can come and show us just how
[38:31] great he is
[38:33] you know the children of Israel if you
[38:34] think about it they came up on the Red
[38:36] Sea they had come out of bondage bitter
[38:38] bondage and those rejoices and they was
[38:41] just having a Revival and where did God
[38:43] lead them right to a ridge right right
[38:45] to the sea is that right
[38:47] brother Brandon said the water is in
[38:49] front of them the Mountain's on one side
[38:50] and here come the enemy in behind them
[38:52] but what did God do he opened up the
[38:55] water
[38:55] here they go rejoicing and praising God
[38:58] I mean what a miracle the ocean just
[39:00] opened up and the Bible said they went
[39:01] over on dry ground and here they went
[39:03] worshiping God and where did he lead
[39:04] them out into the desert the three days
[39:06] of no water
[39:08] is that not right so they find water and
[39:11] they start screaming and rejoicing and
[39:12] they go drink the water and what is it
[39:14] bitter
[39:16] bitter water but what did they do they
[39:18] cut down a tree and threw it into the
[39:19] water and turned a bit of water sweet
[39:21] and brothers said God done those things
[39:23] just to show them how much he loved them
[39:25] he loved them enough to split the Red
[39:27] Sea he loved them enough to take bitter
[39:29] Waters and make it sweet so sometimes
[39:32] the bitter Waters of her life is only
[39:33] God showing us just how much he cares
[39:36] for us that he could come amen and he
[39:39] could come and show us just how great a
[39:41] God he is How Great Is Our God he's
[39:44] worthy to be worshiped as our little
[39:46] brother saying this morning if you have
[39:48] your Bibles turn with us to the second
[39:49] book of Kings appreciate brother John
[39:51] allowing us to come I know he could have
[39:53] some great man to come and speak here at
[39:55] the church and because he allowed us to
[39:57] come and we certainly appreciate that
[39:59] and I believe you see brother Johnson

[41:00] that amen we love our little ones don't
[41:03] we we certainly do second Kings chapter
[41:06] 4 verse 25 and I'm sure brother Lindsey
[41:09] appreciate you remembering his other
[41:11] grandson his name is Josiah and he's
[41:14] just really really needs a touch from
[41:15] the Lord matter of fact they even the
[41:17] hospital said that he just needs a
[41:19] miracle to even survive so but you know
[41:21] we serve a god of Miracles
[41:23] he's got it all in control second Kings
[41:26] chapter four we want to start reading at
[41:28] verse 25 and I'm going to read a little
[41:30] bit about a child who got into some
[41:33] distress
[41:35] so she went and came into the man of God
[41:37] of Mount Carmel and it came to pass that
[41:40] when the man of God saw her afar off
[41:42] that he said to gehaza his servant
[41:43] behold Yonder is that shudamite
[41:46] run now I pray thee to meet her and say
[41:48] unto her is it well with thee is it well
[41:51] with thy husband is it well with thy
[41:54] child and she answered it is well
[41:58] when she came to the man of God to the
[42:00] hill she caught him by the feet but
[42:01] gehaza came near to thrust her away and
[42:05] the man of God said let her alone for
[42:07] her soul is next within her and the Lord
[42:09] hath hid it for me and hath not told me
[42:12] then she said did I desire a son of my
[42:16] Lord
[42:16] did I not say Do not deceive me then he
[42:20] said to gehaza gird up thy loins and
[42:22] take my staff in thy hand and go thy way
[42:24] if thou meet any man salute him not and
[42:27] if any salute thee answer him not again
[42:28] and lay my staff upon the face of the
[42:32] child and the mother of the child said
[42:34] as the Lord liveth and as thy soul
[42:36] liveth I will not leave thee and he
[42:41] arose and followed her
[42:43] you know why because he couldn't get her
[42:46] off his hands
[42:47] let us bow our heads I want to speak to
[42:50] you for a few minutes this morning on
[42:52] hold on
[42:54] hold on
[42:55] Heavenly Father
[42:57] thank you Lord for your mercy and your
[43:00] grace
[43:01] we just love you today Lord and we thank
[43:03] you for the opportunity to serve you and
[43:06] Lord we just look to you today to meet
[43:07] every need that's in our midst Lord
[43:09] because that's just the kind of God you
[43:12] are but Lord you step out of the
[43:14] darkness into the light Lord to call us
[43:16] to yourself and we thank you for that
[43:18] Lord today and Father God I pray Lord
[43:20] that you would just move upon the hearts
[43:22] of your people that when we leave the
[43:24] building did we not say within ourselves
[43:26] did not our hearts burn within us
[43:28] blessed brother John Lord his ministry
[43:30] bless the saints of God here the other
[43:31] ministers may just lose them in a great
[43:33] way Lord we pray we commit this
[43:36] congregation into your hands For Your
[43:37] Glory in Jesus name and the Saints says
[43:40] amen God bless you made me seated
[43:43] now hold on by definition
[43:46] it means to endure or to keep going in
[43:51] difficult circumstances
[43:53] you know in some phrases of that would
[43:55] have the same meaning as hold on as if
[43:57] if only they could hold on a little
[43:59] longer and similar meanings or phrases
[44:03] that has the same meaning as hold on is
[44:05] to keep going to keep on to last to
[44:09] continue to persevere to struggle on to
[44:13] carry on to go on to hang on to hold out
[44:16] to not give up to see it through to stay
[44:20] the course or as we said when I was in
[44:22] the Army to sold your own to stick it
[44:25] out to stick with it to hang in there
[44:27] those are all of the same meaning of the
[44:30] words or the phrases of hold on so
[44:33] therefore then the opposite meaning of
[44:35] hold on is to give up
[44:38] to give up and we're living in a time
[44:40] where we see so many are just giving up
[44:43] they're getting discouraged and they're
[44:45] walking away and they're they're turning
[44:47] aside and they're they're struggling off
[44:49] to this website and they're going off to
[44:51] that website and they're they're you
[44:53] know they've let the pandemic give them
[44:54] an excuse for not coming to church no
[44:56] more and people just get just getting
[44:58] discouraged and just giving up but I say
[45:00] to you Church hold on this morning
[45:03] don't give up just hold on to the
[45:05] promises God's promises are true he will
[45:08] keep every promise of his word he'll
[45:11] keep to us this morning this Cinema
[45:13] woman that we read about in the Bible is
[45:15] to me is the very definition of hold on
[45:18] because she stayed the course she did
[45:21] not give up
[45:23] the to get an understanding of what's
[45:25] going on in the scripture we've got to
[45:27] go back to where the story starts
[45:30] this woman that we read about in the
[45:32] Bible it doesn't even give her name but
[45:34] I think many times it's done that way so
[45:36] that we could put our name there that we
[45:39] could identify ourselves with those
[45:40] scriptures so the Bible doesn't give her
[45:43] name but it does tell us where she's
[45:44] from she's from uh she's a shoot-em-out
[45:47] woman from the city of Humane now the
[45:50] word Humane means a double rest so this
[45:53] woman lived in a city of a double rest
[45:56] or a places of to rest
[45:59] amen and the shootout was a city in
[46:02] escar north of Manassas about five miles
[46:05] south of Mount Tabor it's where the
[46:07] location of this city was and the Bible
[46:09] says that the great prophet Elisha would
[46:11] travel through this city on his travels
[46:13] and so it came to pass that she noticed
[46:16] this man of God that she offered him
[46:18] some bread and befriended the man of God
[46:20] and one day she told her husband she
[46:22] said I want to make room in her house
[46:24] for the man of God that he could have a
[46:27] place to stay that when he passes
[46:29] through the city of rest he could find a
[46:32] place to rest
[46:33] so she made her a room in her home
[46:37] for the prophet of God and no doubt she
[46:40] called this room the Elisha room
[46:43] I've stayed in many of them
[46:46] amen
[46:48] you know but she what sticks out to me
[46:50] about this is that she made room in her
[46:53] home for the man of God and I think that
[46:56] would be a good thing for all of us to
[46:58] do this morning is to clean some of the
[47:00] junk not out of her home so much but out
[47:03] of our lives and make more room for
[47:05] Jesus you know Elisha the prophet Elisha
[47:08] told the Kings you want water then dig
[47:10] this Valley full of ditches and he said
[47:12] the deeper you dig the more water you'll
[47:15] have and I think that's a good thing for
[47:16] us that we dig down and get some of the
[47:19] garbage and the junk and the and the
[47:20] things that don't really matter get it
[47:22] out of our life and make more room for
[47:24] the water and the holy spirit amen or
[47:27] Hallelujah because the more we can empty
[47:29] out the more he can fill us up with
[47:31] himself amen
[47:33] oh my you know and I'm not against those
[47:36] things Instagram Facebook those things
[47:38] are all right but the trouble of it is
[47:39] we spend more time on Facebook than we
[47:42] do with our face in this book let's not
[47:44] get our priorities wrong let's keep our
[47:46] priorities right amen We Don't Belong To
[47:48] The World we're not a part of the world
[47:50] we belong to God we come from God and
[47:52] we'll go back to God and we're here for
[47:55] a purpose amen then God help me to keep
[47:57] my focus and not get distracted and when
[48:00] the things of the world tries to come
[48:01] into my life God help me to clean it out
[48:04] of my life and make more room for Jesus
[48:08] the color of the world let the Holy
[48:10] Ghost come in and saturate our souls so
[48:13] she did this act of kindness for the man
[48:16] of God and the Bible said he who
[48:18] receives the prophet in the name of a
[48:21] prophet receives a prophet's reward
[48:24] and the prophet taught us that God cares
[48:26] God cares for people who cares
[48:30] God cares for those who care for him the
[48:34] Bible says as you've done it unto the
[48:36] least of these my little ones you have
[48:39] done it unto me
[48:41] and so she'd done this for the man of
[48:43] God and that the prophet said it so
[48:46] pleased him it's so pleased Elisha that
[48:49] he wanted to do something for her and
[48:51] gehaza said to his to his master Elijah
[48:54] said she doesn't have a child and the
[48:56] prophet of God said bring her here and
[48:59] he said next time this time next year
[49:01] according to the time of life you will
[49:04] have the child and just as the prophet
[49:07] said she had the child and it was a boy
[49:10] now when the boy was about 11 year old
[49:13] one day he was uh he went with his papa
[49:16] out into the fields to work during the
[49:18] Harvest Time and the public said I
[49:20] believe he must have had a sunstroke
[49:22] because he grabbed his head and he began
[49:25] to say my head my head and he got more
[49:28] sick and more sick so the father being
[49:30] real busy he sent a servant with the boy
[49:33] to take the boy home so he takes this
[49:36] boy home who's complaining with a
[49:37] headache and lays him upon his mother's
[49:39] lap and the Bible says about new
[49:41] noontime the life went out of the child
[49:45] and he was dead
[49:48] the poor little boy died
[49:51] but I want you to notice what she did
[49:53] she took him and laid him on the
[49:56] prophet's bed
[49:58] now there's a real revelation
[50:01] that's a wonderful Revelation for us
[50:03] this morning notice she didn't take the
[50:05] boy to his bed neither did she take him
[50:07] to her bed or to the father's bed but
[50:10] she took him and laid him on the
[50:12] prophet's bed in the
[50:14] in the chamber where he slept because
[50:16] she knew that whatever that Prophet
[50:19] touched was blessed
[50:22] oh did you catch it this morning
[50:24] whatever that Prophet touched was
[50:26] blessed Church came we realized this
[50:29] morning how blessed we are our lives
[50:31] have been touched by the hand of God we
[50:34] are a blessed people this morning he's
[50:36] gave us life in the time of Darkness
[50:38] he's gave us peace in the time of
[50:40] trouble he's gave us rest in the time of
[50:42] unrest he's gave us Revelation in a time
[50:45] of insanity
[50:46] as I said last night there's so many
[50:49] questions today that may be true but
[50:51] we've got something they don't got we've
[50:54] got the answer
[50:56] or the prophet said Jesus Christ is the
[50:58] answer for everything you're going
[51:01] through
[51:02] amen
[51:04] glory be to God
[51:06] you may not have a hundred dollars in
[51:08] your pocket but we're rich this morning
[51:11] we have riches Untold we are blessed
[51:14] because our lives have been touched by
[51:17] the master
[51:20] and she says to her husband
[51:22] give me a servant let him settle up with
[51:25] you and go forward with me
[51:27] instead you told this service and now I
[51:29] don't even want you to stop and salute
[51:31] anybody or nothing go straight to the
[51:33] man of God up to Mount Carmel and the
[51:35] prophet said well that's it set your
[51:37] eyes on the go and don't look back
[51:42] what did the prophet tell us to look at
[51:44] in this day he didn't say look at the
[51:46] trouble he didn't say look at finances
[51:48] come on somebody he didn't say look at
[51:50] Fox News but he said look to Jesus
[51:54] get your eyes on the go and don't look
[51:56] back don't get sidetracked don't stop
[51:59] don't listen to doubters we've got
[52:01] plenty of doubters they'll always be
[52:03] here
[52:04] but just keep going
[52:06] but her husband her husband sometimes
[52:09] the greatest discouragement doesn't come
[52:12] from out there it'll come from right
[52:14] among our ranks
[52:17] is that not true
[52:18] they was 12 but over a spot out the land
[52:20] 10 of them came back and said we can't
[52:23] take it it's too great there's Giants in
[52:25] the land there's wild cities
[52:28] huh
[52:29] and the Bible said there was two million
[52:32] came out of Egypt and by that night that
[52:36] negative report we can't do it went
[52:38] through the whole camp and the Bible
[52:40] said there was weeping and wailing in
[52:42] the camp
[52:43] how fast negativism will go through a
[52:46] church but Lord God let positivism go
[52:49] through it like that let us be like
[52:51] Caleb and Joshua when he stood up and
[52:53] said give me my Mountain amen
[52:58] I will not fear when Giants come calling
[53:01] my name my God Is Bigger amen
[53:04] [Applause]
[53:06] Hallelujah
[53:08] sure she was wanting to get to this man
[53:11] of God and her husband said you're
[53:13] wasting your time it's neither new moon
[53:16] it's neither Sabbath he won't be there
[53:18] you're wasting your time he's not there
[53:21] it's over just forget it the boy's dead
[53:26] the doctor says it's too far alone the
[53:28] doctor says it's the worst case he ever
[53:30] saw
[53:32] let me tell you something this brother
[53:33] sister every time you start to make a
[53:36] move towards God you're going to have
[53:38] discourages
[53:40] you're going to have hindrances you're
[53:42] going to have obstacles to try to turn
[53:44] you back to try to try to discourage you
[53:47] to try to get you to keep to give up but
[53:50] I say to you just keep going don't
[53:52] listen to the critics just keep writing
[53:55] get the hold on get to where the word of
[53:57] God is being manifested when you find
[54:00] the word for your day being manifested
[54:02] you have found Christ amen
[54:06] Hallelujah
[54:08] amen hallelujah
[54:10] amen and when she got to worry like she
[54:13] was and he seen her coming
[54:16] and he says go ask her
[54:18] is it well
[54:20] with a husband
[54:23] just had a fight with him
[54:26] you know brother told me one time
[54:28] I hope this ain't true here but her
[54:30] brother told me one time sometimes it's
[54:32] hard to say Amen when you fight with
[54:33] your wife on the way to church
[54:41] she just had a big fuss with her husband
[54:43] about whether to go or not go
[54:47] is this thing on y'all hear me
[54:50] you look at me like you never had a fuss
[54:52] with your wife in your life
[54:55] come on Friends yes we're all human we
[54:58] all need grace even preachers come on

[55:03] but the prophet of God he said go ask
[55:06] her is all well with her husband
[55:09] you know he's a silent listener of every
[55:11] congregation hating God knows everything
[55:13] that's happening in your life at any
[55:15] moment come on somebody
[55:17] foreign
[55:21] is it well with my boy is it well with
[55:25] thee
[55:26] her son was laying dead on the prophet's
[55:30] bed she had had a disagreement with her
[55:32] husband on whether to go or not go
[55:35] but she said oh God
[55:39] she said it is well
[55:42] oh I like that all is well why because
[55:46] she was in the presence of the prophet
[55:49] and it's all thank you Lord if she had
[55:52] that much confidence standing in the
[55:54] presence of a prophet how much more
[55:56] confidence can you and I have this
[55:58] morning standing in the presence of the
[56:00] one who sent the prophets
[56:03] Amen brother Brandon ain't here but
[56:05] Jesus Christ is here this morning where
[56:08] two or three are gathered in my name I
[56:10] will be in their mystery man
[56:13] [Applause]
[56:15] Hallelujah
[56:17] [Music]
[56:19] standing in this water we are in the
[56:21] presence of the one who sent the prophet
[56:24] oh saints of God
[56:26] I say to you this morning all is well
[56:31] you may be having trouble but all is
[56:33] well
[56:34] you make me sick but all is well
[56:38] you may be having great difficulties I'm
[56:41] not belittling that
[56:42] I'm just trying to tell you all's well
[56:46] because we're in the presence
[56:48] of Jesus Christ
[56:50] and when she came to the man of God to
[56:52] the hill
[56:53] she called him by the feet now here she
[56:55] got even God as we say she got to the
[56:58] church service
[57:00] and the devil's still
[57:03] didn't stop trying to discourage her
[57:06] oh my
[57:09] God you're talking about a good
[57:10] adversary he's a good adversary we need
[57:12] to be as good a Christian as he as an
[57:13] adversary come on somebody she got to
[57:17] where she wanted to be and she got to
[57:19] the foot of the Prophet but here come
[57:21] gehaza
[57:23] and the Bible said he tried to thrust
[57:25] through it get off of him
[57:30] get off of him leave him alone
[57:33] but the man of God said to Gaza leave
[57:36] her alone her soul is vexed within her
[57:39] and the Lord hath hid it for me and he
[57:42] hath not told me
[57:46] so you see
[57:47] prophets don't know everything
[57:51] amen they only know what God will allow
[57:55] them to know

[58:42] of God she said did I desire did I come
[58:46] to you and ask you for a son

[59:17] Lord liveth and that's our soul liveth I
[59:20] will not leave thee

[1:00:03] huh
[1:00:06] how many times does he have to do it
[1:00:09] before we believe him

[1:00:16] light or some Goosebump or when are we
[1:00:19] going to get mature enough
[1:00:21] to take God
[1:00:23] at his word

[1:00:45] her and the prophet of God said if
[1:00:47] you'll just stay with the Holy Spirit
[1:00:49] like she stayed with Elisha she grabbed
[1:00:51] me by the feet she wasn't letting go she
[1:00:54] was holding on she was Otis has it he
[1:00:56] said you stay on Jesus hands like that
[1:00:59] to think of it if he loved us enough to
[1:01:01] save us if he loves us enough to come to
[1:01:04] us if he loves us enough to send us
[1:01:06] Elijah then does not he love us enough
[1:01:08] to bless us and save us and heal us and
[1:01:10] change our bodies amen then stay with
[1:01:13] the one who gave the promise
[1:01:18] been God so good when I was on the
[1:01:20] mountain I was shouting and hollering
[1:01:21] amen but here I am in the valley listen

[1:01:25] him that's the time to really serve him

[1:01:40] well brother you don't know how long
[1:01:42] I've waited really
[1:01:45] Comics Congressman Upshaw remember him
[1:01:47] yeah he fell off of a haywagon when he
[1:01:49] was a young boy
[1:01:50] and broke his back and he was paralyzed
[1:01:54] and he was in a wheelchair anybody
[1:01:56] remember how long
[1:01:58] 62 years I believe it was I thought it
[1:02:02] was 66 but I looked it up I believe it
[1:02:03] was 62 years
[1:02:05] really after 60 years does it really
[1:02:08] matter whether it was one or two or
[1:02:10] three or four the men had been in a
[1:02:12] wheelchair for a long time but my point
[1:02:14] is this how many people
[1:02:17] gave up
[1:02:18] that he would ever walk again
[1:02:21] huh
[1:02:23] if it didn't happen in 60 seconds or 60
[1:02:25] Minutes or six months
[1:02:29] 62 years
[1:02:31] in a wheelchair
[1:02:34] you know people that's paralyzed you've
[1:02:37] been around some of them they're limbs
[1:02:39] they shrink
[1:02:40] because there's no nerves there's no
[1:02:42] stimulation for the muscle so they all
[1:02:43] swivel up
[1:02:46] I've seen people you know my daughter
[1:02:47] when she was in the accident had a
[1:02:49] severe brain injury it left her
[1:02:50] paralyzed like that she had no control
[1:02:52] over her body and just a few days her
[1:02:54] feet was starting to drop down and they
[1:02:55] was putting things on to try to keep
[1:02:57] them up here was a man that was in a
[1:02:58] wheelchair 60 some years
[1:03:01] can you imagine what his legs look like
[1:03:04] can you imagine how small they were oh
[1:03:07] God but when God said stand up
[1:03:12] Hallelujah
[1:03:14] I know what that is when Jessica was
[1:03:16] hurt they left her you know as I said it
[1:03:19] left her paralyzed but it also left her
[1:03:20] blind she couldn't see and everything
[1:03:22] came back she started walking again she
[1:03:24] started talking again started eating
[1:03:26] again and all the things that they said
[1:03:27] she'd never do
[1:03:29] but one thing it was it was slow coming
[1:03:31] back was her vision and they were
[1:03:33] telling us she will always be blind she
[1:03:34] has a condition called cortical
[1:03:36] blindness I believe it was and said
[1:03:37] she'll always be blind
[1:03:40] and I remember people calling and they
[1:03:43] was with us and I thank God please don't
[1:03:45] understand me I thank God for every
[1:03:47] phone call we got
[1:03:49] and people would call and say how's she

[1:03:53] said is she seeing I said no she's not
[1:03:56] seeing you well praise God she will

[1:04:19] seeing yet no well brother Daryl
[1:04:22] God bless you buddy
[1:04:24] and it got to the point that I told my
[1:04:26] wife I said I don't want to talk to
[1:04:28] people
[1:04:29] who try to discourage me
[1:04:32] I don't need their sympathy I need their
[1:04:34] prayers
[1:04:37] how soon we give up if it don't happen
[1:04:39] when we want to but you know there's a
[1:04:41] quote look it up there's a quote with
[1:04:42] the prophet of God said the outside
[1:04:44] world wants you to believe as soon as
[1:04:46] you lay your hands up on that crippled
[1:04:47] leg it should strike now and the people
[1:04:49] should jump for joy he said the problem
[1:04:51] of it is Jesus never said that
[1:04:55] but the world wants to believe that so
[1:04:57] when it don't happen what does it
[1:04:59] produce discouragement
[1:05:00] come on somebody but he never said that
[1:05:03] he said lay hands on the sick and they
[1:05:05] shall recover he never said when
[1:05:08] he never said when just be found
[1:05:10] believing amen
[1:05:14] with the stomach trouble in the corner
[1:05:16] and they was up there in the meeting in
[1:05:17] Chicago and they passed through the line
[1:05:19] and the angel Lord pronounced them both
[1:05:20] well and they go back to the
[1:05:22] neighborhood they live close to one
[1:05:24] another
[1:05:24] and the woman with the stomach trouble
[1:05:26] was testifying to everybody that God had
[1:05:28] healed her but she was still sick
[1:05:31] and her husband said I want you to stop
[1:05:33] your embarrassingness you ain't no
[1:05:35] better I want you to quit testified
[1:05:37] she said listen dear that man didn't
[1:05:40] know me and he told me my name he didn't
[1:05:42] know where I lived and he told me where
[1:05:43] I lived he didn't know what was wrong
[1:05:45] with me and he told me what was wrong
[1:05:46] with me and then he told me I was healed
[1:05:53] so I'm just going to keep on testifying
[1:05:55] yeah because if he knew all that he
[1:05:58] knows this
[1:06:00] she got up one morning weeks and went by
[1:06:02] and she got up one morning the kids left
[1:06:04] some oatmeal and they didn't eat it and
[1:06:06] they went off to school and she ate
[1:06:07] something it didn't hurt she ate some
[1:06:09] toast it didn't hurt she drank some
[1:06:10] coffee it didn't hurt she got excited
[1:06:12] maybe we got a little Pentecostal
[1:06:16] but I tell you when God gets real

[1:06:51] reaction amen

[1:07:01] and she went running in and the prophet
[1:07:04] said she was shaking the sheets looking
[1:07:06] for the corner and he said what was it
[1:07:08] he said it was the angel of the Lord
[1:07:10] passing through the neighborhood
[1:07:11] confirming the blessing amen let me tell
[1:07:15] you if you've been prayed for believe
[1:07:16] God believe that the angel is on the way

[1:07:41] if we could take a hold of God's agent
[1:07:42] if we could just take a hold of God's
[1:07:44] agent God's agent then he said was
[1:07:46] Elisha
[1:07:47] but God's agent today is the Holy Spirit

[1:07:53] contact and you feel the Holy Spirit on

[1:08:25] kind of faith
[1:08:28] hold on to him stay all night if you
[1:08:31] have to you see her faith wasn't in the
[1:08:33] staff it was in the prophet
[1:08:36] so she said as the Lord your god-liveth
[1:08:38] and never dies and your soul never dies
[1:08:41] I'm not going to leave you I'm going to
[1:08:43] stay right there with you and he said if

[1:08:50] out of it hold on Amen
[1:08:55] amen I think I told you here before
[1:08:57] somebody was John about it there's a
[1:08:59] girl over in Romania years ago I was
[1:09:00] over there preaching the ucamp
[1:09:03] a young gypsy girl about 18 year old
[1:09:05] came up on a crutch she had no rights
[1:09:07] hip socket was born without a hip socket
[1:09:09] on the right side and her leg just swung
[1:09:11] like this it was shorter than the other
[1:09:12] one and it just swung like this when she
[1:09:14] walked and when she walked up and
[1:09:15] stopped she'd have to take this hand and
[1:09:17] stop her leg from swinging because it
[1:09:19] just swung just
[1:09:20] so she comes up on a I believe it was on
[1:09:22] a Friday night if my memory serves me
[1:09:24] right
[1:09:24] and she wanted to repent of her sins
[1:09:27] you see where I told her I said this you
[1:09:29] can stand right here and ask Jesus into
[1:09:30] your heart but that wasn't good enough
[1:09:33] she worked that leg brother John until
[1:09:35] she got down on her knees
[1:09:37] and repented
[1:09:39] and I thought my God how many people in
[1:09:41] America's got two good knees will never
[1:09:43] bow
[1:09:45] so the next morning you know what she
[1:09:47] done after service on Saturday morning
[1:09:48] she goes out to an icy River
[1:09:52] and goes into that water with that
[1:09:54] crutch and was baptized in Jesus name
[1:09:57] she comes back to church that night and
[1:09:59] she comes to the Altar and she says I
[1:10:01] want to be healed
[1:10:03] she said I want to be a mother I want to
[1:10:05] have children I want to have a husband
[1:10:08] but who would marry me
[1:10:09] like this
[1:10:11] and I told her I said sis you know what
[1:10:13] I do if I was you I quit asking God for
[1:10:16] my healing and I would just accept it
[1:10:20] and I said here's what I want you to do
[1:10:21] I said you take this handkerchief
[1:10:23] and you keep it with you and when God
[1:10:26] heals you you send it back to me as a
[1:10:28] testimony of what he done for you and I
[1:10:30] said I want you to take a bar soap and
[1:10:32] write on your mirror thank God for
[1:10:34] healing me and I said when you get up in
[1:10:36] the morning you thank God for healing

[1:14:31] recover
[1:14:32] y That's the promise of his word
[1:14:35] amen amen
[1:14:37] amen God said they shall as I said he
[1:14:41] just didn't say when
[1:14:44] is that right
[1:14:46] like Elijah and Elisha Elijah and Elijah
[1:14:52] Elijah laid his hands on Elisha another
[1:14:54] story
[1:14:56] always get those two confused about you
[1:14:58] it's just they're so close together
[1:15:01] get tongue-tied but you know what I'm
[1:15:02] talking about Elijah laid his hands upon
[1:15:05] Elisha that's a lot better
[1:15:07] he ladies they laid that man on Elisha
[1:15:09] while he was plowing in the field and
[1:15:11] the mantle did not fit Elisha but Elisha
[1:15:15] wanted the mantle so what did he do he
[1:15:18] took off after Elijah he held on he
[1:15:21] wasn't leaving Elijah till he got that
[1:15:24] mantle
[1:15:26] he laid that man up on Elisha and it
[1:15:29] wouldn't fit
[1:15:30] but Elisha held on how many knows how
[1:15:33] long did Elisha you remember how long
[1:15:35] did he follow Elijah
[1:15:37] to get that mantle
[1:15:39] 10
[1:15:40] years
[1:15:42] we can't wait 10 minutes
[1:15:46] you know the Pony Express we live in
[1:15:48] such an age of such impatience
[1:15:51] as soon as the light turns green the guy
[1:15:53] behind you blows the horn
[1:15:57] I was over 60 year old I got to move
[1:15:59] this leg
[1:16:03] but people are so it's true they're so
[1:16:05] impatient do you realize many many years
[1:16:08] ago the Pony Express you would write a
[1:16:10] letter Way Out West to somebody and
[1:16:12] you'd say hey John how you doing hope
[1:16:14] the cops are good and you give it to a
[1:16:17] guy on a horse and he rode and gave it
[1:16:18] to another guy on a horse and another
[1:16:20] guy on a horse and another guy on a
[1:16:21] horse and about a month later John got
[1:16:23] the letter
[1:16:24] and he opened it up and he read it hey
[1:16:26] John how you doing how's the Harvest
[1:16:28] John writes back good
[1:16:33] gives it to the rider to another Rider
[1:16:35] to another Rider to another Rider and a
[1:16:38] month later
[1:16:39] after the letter has been gone some
[1:16:41] three months
[1:16:42] you get the letter back from John and
[1:16:44] you carry it open and John says good
[1:16:53] but now if we send a text and it don't
[1:16:56] go through instantly we're smacking our
[1:16:58] phone
[1:17:00] you might as well say hey man that's why
[1:17:02] you've got a screensaver
[1:17:07] amen
[1:17:08] but notice Elisha it was 10 years but
[1:17:12] God never cut the man on the fit Elisha
[1:17:15] but he mowed it and shaped Elisha to fit
[1:17:18] the man and God will never you might as
[1:17:21] well say amen he will never cut this
[1:17:23] message to fit our petty ideas
[1:17:27] but he will cut us and mold us and shape
[1:17:30] us to fit this message amen
[1:17:34] and you know the story they got down
[1:17:35] there to the river and stuck the water
[1:17:37] parted across and Elijah turned Elijah
[1:17:39] said what do you want notice what he
[1:17:41] said he didn't say I want what you got
[1:17:43] it's good man you've got a real Ministry
[1:17:45] but he said I want more it's like the
[1:17:47] fella eating watermelon he said that's
[1:17:48] good they got to be some more somewhere
[1:17:49] all right
[1:17:52] right he just didn't want what Elijah
[1:17:53] had but after 10 years of walking with
[1:17:56] that prophet
[1:17:58] he said what do you want from me he said
[1:18:00] I want a double portion of your spirit
[1:18:04] oh the prophet said that's it that's the
[1:18:06] way to do it don't ask God for little
[1:18:08] things ask God for big things
[1:18:11] he's had the trouble of people today is
[1:18:13] let's say I asked the father for so much
[1:18:15] he said oh my don't be scared to ask him
[1:18:17] ask all you can ask he likes to give you
[1:18:20] just as much as you've got faith to
[1:18:23] receive
[1:18:24] don't you see my brother my sister when
[1:18:26] we ask God for big things we're telling
[1:18:28] God I believe you're a big God
[1:18:32] when we ask God for miracles we're
[1:18:35] telling God I believe you're a miracle
[1:18:37] working God
[1:18:40] hey man hey man well I'm afraid afraid
[1:18:44] God ain't gonna run out
[1:18:46] he got plenty of blessings
[1:18:48] just hold on to the promise
[1:18:50] amen Elisha got that medal he goes back
[1:18:53] down to the same river with the same
[1:18:55] metal struck the same water and he said
[1:18:57] where is the god of Elijah he wasn't
[1:18:59] asking a question he was making a
[1:19:01] statement
[1:19:04] where is the god of Elijah he will tell
[1:19:06] you he's here
[1:19:12] the man who was his
[1:19:13] and the prophet said Elijah and Elisha
[1:19:16] is a type of Christ in his church and
[1:19:18] Jesus said the things that I do shall
[1:19:20] you do also and More Than This shall you
[1:19:23] do what was he telling the church a
[1:19:25] double portion
[1:19:27] now you can't do nothing greater than
[1:19:29] raise the dead but the war you see what
[1:19:31] Jesus done in his ministry it was one
[1:19:33] man it was God working through one man
[1:19:35] doing signs and wonders but now it's a
[1:19:38] greater that was in the bridegroom but
[1:19:40] now it has moved over into the broadest
[1:19:42] we looked at last night and now all
[1:19:44] around the world signs and wonders what
[1:19:46] God was doing through one man now he's
[1:19:48] doing through a many membered body doing
[1:19:51] what making Saint John 14 12 a reality
[1:19:54] today they shall lay their hands on the
[1:19:56] sick and they shall recover
[1:19:59] Hallelujah on the day what did Jesus do
[1:20:02] on the day of Pentecost he pulled off
[1:20:04] that mantle and let it drop down to his
[1:20:06] disciples
[1:20:08] where is the god that was on Jesus
[1:20:10] Christ where is the power of his
[1:20:11] resurrection it's in the church today
[1:20:14] amen
[1:20:15] these promises were true let's hold on
[1:20:17] to them
[1:20:18] sold your own
[1:20:20] keep pressing on
[1:20:22] don't give up Don't Turn back don't let
[1:20:26] go
[1:20:27] I'm just so discouraged but hold on to
[1:20:31] Jesus the doctor says it's bad but hold
[1:20:34] on to Jesus don't look at the situation
[1:20:37] look at the solution
[1:20:40] as long as you look at the situation
[1:20:42] that's all you'll ever see
[1:20:45] don't just look at the symptom look at
[1:20:47] the Cure
[1:20:49] Look to Him grab a hold of the promise
[1:20:52] let that black girl did down in Memphis
[1:20:54] she was blind
[1:20:57] and they're hurting the radio that God
[1:20:59] had opened the eyes of a blinded man up
[1:21:01] in Jonesboro Arkansas the man lived from
[1:21:02] up in Kennett Missouri and he come over
[1:21:04] to Jonesboro the prophet God talked
[1:21:06] about that meeting he said I was on the
[1:21:07] platform eight days and nights and I
[1:21:09] made a vow he said that I would pray for
[1:21:11] everybody that was sick but he said
[1:21:13] after eight days of just staying at the
[1:21:15] platform drinking orange juice you know
[1:21:16] just just just the Necessities that a
[1:21:19] man needs to do but stay in there
[1:21:21] praying for the sick he said at the end
[1:21:22] of eight days there was this many to
[1:21:24] pray for as there was the first day
[1:21:28] and he said I was there and they come
[1:21:30] and got me said brother Brenham there's
[1:21:31] a woman out in an ambulance that's dead
[1:21:33] so I said I went out and I went around
[1:21:35] through the crowd this way and got up in
[1:21:37] the ambulance maybe maybe you remember
[1:21:38] the story if you've never heard the
[1:21:39] story go to a message called testimony
[1:21:41] preach the Los Angeles California 1959
[1:21:43] it's about 21 minutes long but man gives
[1:21:45] this testimony it's just that's the
[1:21:47] title of it it's a testimony I don't
[1:21:49] know if you've ever heard it or not but
[1:21:50] I always listen to it right before I
[1:21:51] pray for the sick and just always list
[1:21:52] my faith for some reason
[1:21:55] but he said I went around I called up in
[1:21:56] the Emerson I prayed for the woman and
[1:21:58] she raised up so I came out of the
[1:22:00] animals and they said brother we'll
[1:22:01] never get you back in the way you came
[1:22:02] we're going to have to bring you around
[1:22:04] this way
[1:22:05] so he was passing through the crowd
[1:22:07] going this way and he heard this girl
[1:22:09] now her father they got the money and
[1:22:11] chartered a bus from from Memphis up to
[1:22:13] Jonesboro Arkansas
[1:22:16] and here her father says now you stand
[1:22:18] right here and I'll get the Healer for
[1:22:20] you
[1:22:21] but while she was standing there so many
[1:22:23] people on the outside trying to get in
[1:22:25] they bumped her and caused her to move
[1:22:26] and she couldn't see so she lost her way
[1:22:29] and she was out there in the crowd and
[1:22:31] she was crying out Mercy with someone
[1:22:33] have mercy on me I'm blind I can't see
[1:22:35] and I've lost my papa
[1:22:37] amen now brother Brandon was going
[1:22:40] around this way
[1:22:42] and he said you see how God locks things
[1:22:45] in just exactly right
[1:22:47] he said why did he have me to go around
[1:22:49] this way instead of the way I came
[1:22:53] and here he was passing through the
[1:22:55] crowd
[1:22:56] then I was sharing this with Brother
[1:22:57] John was talking the other night as we
[1:22:58] drive into the room
[1:23:00] that as I was looking at this and this
[1:23:01] this just dumped out at me that big
[1:23:04] brother better come out of the animal
[1:23:05] and he was walking through the crowd now
[1:23:06] that crowd was there for one reason that
[1:23:09] was to get brother Branham to pray for
[1:23:10] him
[1:23:11] but they didn't know brother Brennan
[1:23:12] from Adam
[1:23:13] they have no monitors like we got they
[1:23:15] couldn't see what was going on inside
[1:23:17] all they knew there was a man in there
[1:23:18] praying and God answered his prayer
[1:23:21] I hope I'm not too long this morning
[1:23:25] so he's passing through the crowd
[1:23:27] and no doubt you know him I said stepped
[1:23:29] on somebody's foot back said he said
[1:23:30] excuse me I I didn't mean that I'm
[1:23:32] trying to get around this way I'm sorry
[1:23:33] I hope you're okay and they might have
[1:23:35] said would you get out of my way I'm
[1:23:36] trying to get in there and see the
[1:23:37] Healer
[1:23:38] and the Very one that was wanting to see
[1:23:40] was passing right through
[1:23:43] and they didn't recognize it
[1:23:45] and as I was looking at I thought how
[1:23:47] many times
[1:23:49] has Jesus that's right
[1:23:51] passed right through our congregation
[1:23:53] yeah
[1:23:55] and we failed to recognize it
[1:23:57] right because maybe it wasn't the our
[1:23:59] favorite preacher
[1:24:04] oh my God what would it be that day to
[1:24:05] realize how many times
[1:24:07] he sat right beside you
[1:24:10] and you failed
[1:24:12] to recognize it Superman said I got to
[1:24:15] where she would bump into me
[1:24:19] and he said do you need something she
[1:24:22] said you know the story how many knows
[1:24:23] the story she she said I I've lost my
[1:24:26] papa so I can't find him he said we came
[1:24:29] up from Memphis we got the money got on
[1:24:30] the bus came up here to see the Healer
[1:24:32] he said the watch he said the Healer
[1:24:35] he said surely you don't believe that
[1:24:38] he said as many fine doctors as we have
[1:24:40] today she said but you see sir they
[1:24:43] can't help me
[1:24:45] they can't help me
[1:24:49] and he said do you believe that that man
[1:24:52] prayed for you that you'd see again she
[1:24:54] said I tell you what sir if you'll get
[1:24:56] me to the Healer I'll find my daddy
[1:24:58] myself
[1:25:03] and I looked at her and I said maybe I'm
[1:25:05] the one you're supposed to see he said
[1:25:07] you see how God locks things exactly
[1:25:09] right why was I taken back that way and
[1:25:12] she grabbed me by the lapels of my coat
[1:25:14] like that and she said are you the
[1:25:15] Healer
[1:25:16] and I said no sister I am not of just
[1:25:19] your brother
[1:25:22] Jesus Christ is the Healer
[1:25:25] she said I want to see the Healer and I
[1:25:28] said I hope that you see him someday and
[1:25:30] I believe you will and she said what's
[1:25:31] your name
[1:25:33] he said brother Bradham she said use the
[1:25:35] one I want to see
[1:25:39] he said now no one knows me I'll pray
[1:25:41] for you but but don't let it be known
[1:25:43] take your hands off he said and I
[1:25:45] couldn't pull her hands off of my lapel
[1:25:47] she was holding on for dear life praise
[1:25:50] God and I said I can pray if you'll
[1:25:52] believe I can pray if you'll believe and
[1:25:55] she said that's all I ask you to do
[1:26:00] and he said we bowed our heads and we
[1:26:01] were praying and while we were praying I
[1:26:03] heard a scream and she ran out into the
[1:26:05] lot throwing people one way or the other
[1:26:07] way and she fell on the ground screaming
[1:26:08] I was once blood
[1:26:12] I could now see
[1:26:14] he said a few weeks ago I got a letter
[1:26:15] from her her eyes are 20 20. she don't
[1:26:18] even have to wear glasses or nothing he
[1:26:21] said it's the amazing grace of God that
[1:26:23] does these things it's something that
[1:26:25] Jesus Christ gave to his church to enjoy
[1:26:28] the Privileges of good health and when
[1:26:31] those people saw that young girl with
[1:26:33] her sight that stood an old man with a
[1:26:35] club foot with a club and a twisted foot
[1:26:37] and he said I know who you are brother
[1:26:38] Brandon
[1:26:40] I've been standing here three days in
[1:26:43] the rain
[1:26:44] and if you'll just ask God
[1:26:47] will heal my foot
[1:26:51] not three minutes brother
[1:26:53] about 30 minutes I've been standing here
[1:26:56] three days
[1:26:58] in the rain
[1:27:02] you talk about holding on
[1:27:04] you talk about not giving up
[1:27:06] not turning back
[1:27:09] three days
[1:27:19] the brother said what can be done at a
[1:27:21] time like that
[1:27:23] and I said here my brother if you
[1:27:24] believe that Jesus died and Rose on the
[1:27:26] third day to make these things possible
[1:27:28] hand me your club and when he handed me
[1:27:30] that club he wasn't kidding he meant it
[1:27:32] I seen with my own two eyes that Twisted
[1:27:35] club foot come straight and he jumped up
[1:27:38] in the air and began to scream and four
[1:27:40] men rushed around me people with mothers
[1:27:41] with their babies tried to get in close
[1:27:43] enough just to touch that old raggedy
[1:27:45] coat it was and God was healing them it
[1:27:48] wasn't a ragged coat nor was it the one
[1:27:50] wearing it right
[1:27:51] it was the Lord Jesus that's here this
[1:27:54] morning harder in their faith and I say
[1:27:56] to you if he honored their faith he will
[1:27:59] honor our faith
[1:28:03] if your faith can only declare
[1:28:05] that he's here for you
[1:28:07] you know her brother biscos say
[1:28:09] something one time but always stuck with
[1:28:10] me is just a young man
[1:28:12] but brother bisco he was preaching down
[1:28:13] our way and he said one time he said
[1:28:15] Jesus Christ will be just as real to you
[1:28:18] as your faith can declare him to be
[1:28:23] and I thought that's right brother John
[1:28:24] some people see Jesus every time they
[1:28:27] come to church and some people never see
[1:28:29] him because their faith cannot declare
[1:28:31] that he's here
[1:28:35] oh God
[1:28:37] oh God
[1:28:39] amen
[1:28:41] if your faith can only declare that you
[1:28:43] see her then what should we do this
[1:28:45] morning let's let our faith go
[1:28:47] let's just let our faith go let's just
[1:28:49] believe him
[1:28:50] let's just start accepting that let's
[1:28:52] just start receiving it let's just start
[1:28:54] thanking him for it Hallelujah he said
[1:28:56] but what if I do that and it won't work
[1:28:58] let me tell you something it'll never
[1:29:00] work if you mix doubt with your faith
[1:29:07] brother Brennan said he always comes
[1:29:09] where he's asked but he'll never come
[1:29:12] where he's doubted
[1:29:15] he'll never come where he's doubted then
[1:29:18] let's don't be found doubting but no you
[1:29:21] just don't know what I'm going through
[1:29:22] maybe you don't know what I'm going
[1:29:23] through with
[1:29:24] but that don't matter
[1:29:26] it don't matter whether it's the worst
[1:29:29] case the doctor ever seen or whether
[1:29:30] somebody look at it and say you mean
[1:29:31] that's bothering you it means something
[1:29:33] to God God cares amen
[1:29:37] brother remember since he cared he cared
[1:29:39] so much he raised think about this God
[1:29:41] cares so much he raised the bluegill who
[1:29:44] was dead floating on the Dale Hollow
[1:29:46] Lake he raised that fish from the dead
[1:29:48] the prophet of God said he's done that
[1:29:50] to show us he cares for the little
[1:29:52] things
[1:29:55] he said I had a meeting of a
[1:29:56] child on my prayer list and God raised a
[1:29:59] little fish that didn't even have a soul
[1:30:00] from the dead
[1:30:02] to let us know he cares for every aspect
[1:30:05] of Our Lives
[1:30:08] the littlest thing in your life God
[1:30:11] cares
[1:30:12] oh that'll make a Baptist out
[1:30:16] just let your faith hold on to God
[1:30:18] for your need this morning don't worry
[1:30:19] who's Beside You Jesus is here just
[1:30:23] reach out to him you need healing ask
[1:30:24] him you need forgiveness asking you need
[1:30:27] Deliverance ask him you need answers you
[1:30:29] got to make decisions ask him he's an
[1:30:32] ever-present help in the time of trouble
[1:30:36] Vietnam and as we close can you imagine
[1:30:40] can you imagine how it was that night
[1:30:43] at the house
[1:30:45] of the shooter Mike woman
[1:30:47] with her boy who that that afternoon was
[1:30:50] dead laying on the prophet's bed was
[1:30:52] sitting at the table eating SpaghettiOs
[1:30:58] I'd say there was some shouting
[1:31:00] I'd say there was some singing
[1:31:02] I'd say there's some rejoices
[1:31:05] oh in just a small way I remember how it
[1:31:07] was when we came home from the hospital
[1:31:09] with Jessica when all the doctors had
[1:31:11] told us she would never live but the
[1:31:12] lord gave her back to us and I remember
[1:31:14] when we came home that day after being
[1:31:16] gone 67 days in the hospital and we came
[1:31:19] home and all the there was news people
[1:31:20] out there WJHL WCYB for the local TV
[1:31:23] stations was out there film and Jessica
[1:31:25] coming home and they had banners said
[1:31:26] the miracle girl and all the people were
[1:31:28] there
[1:31:29] but when all the people left
[1:31:32] we closed the door
[1:31:36] it was such Joy
[1:31:39] because Jesus had come to our home
[1:31:43] I gave my little girl back to us
[1:31:45] he wasn't long after that she's about
[1:31:47] six-year-old I'm closing he's about
[1:31:48] six-year-old and we were she was out in
[1:31:50] the front yard playing about a few she's
[1:31:52] only three when she got hit by the train
[1:31:55] and so a few years later she was out in
[1:31:57] the front you're hard playing and I was
[1:31:58] over on the side raking leaves we live
[1:32:00] out in the country I could hear the car
[1:32:01] coming down the road and it started
[1:32:03] slowing down you know this day and age
[1:32:04] when your kids is out in the yard and
[1:32:05] the car slows down you kind of want to
[1:32:06] see who it is you know so I kind of
[1:32:08] eased up into the front yard this guy
[1:32:10] slowed down and he saw Jessica he tooted
[1:32:13] the horn she looked up from playing and
[1:32:15] he waved at her like this and he gave
[1:32:17] her a thumbs up and then he saw me
[1:32:18] brother John and he waved at me and he
[1:32:21] gave me a thumbs up and I gave him a
[1:32:22] thumbs up back and he went on down the
[1:32:23] road and I began to think that the same
[1:32:26] Lord Jesus who touched blind Bartimaeus
[1:32:29] is the same Lord Jesus that went to
[1:32:31] jairus's house and gave his daughter
[1:32:33] back to him is the same Lord Jesus that
[1:32:35] went to that black girl down in
[1:32:37] Jonesboro Arkansas and opened her eyes
[1:32:39] it's the same Lord Jesus who opened the
[1:32:42] eyes of my uncle
[1:32:47] that was singing and they were shouting
[1:32:49] and there was rejoicing the boy that had
[1:32:52] laid dead on the prophet's bed was
[1:32:54] sitting at the table eating separated
[1:32:56] because she said she held on and she
[1:32:59] would not let go
[1:33:02] All Saints don't never give up don't
[1:33:06] never turn back don't never let go
[1:33:10] amen do you love him this morning
[1:33:14] let us bow our heads
[1:33:16] Hallelujah
[1:33:19] Hallelujah
[1:33:21] oh thank you Lord Jesus
[1:33:24] your promises are true Lord you're the
[1:33:26] same yesterday today and forever God I'm
[1:33:28] so glad we don't have to go all the way
[1:33:31] back into the Bible days and we don't
[1:33:32] have to go all the way back into the 60s
[1:33:34] when your Prophet was here to find that
[1:33:35] she was doing something but that same
[1:33:37] Lord God is doing things today people
[1:33:40] being healed cancers disappearing Lord
[1:33:42] as we've done in Cottonwood Arizona just
[1:33:44] a few months ago a sister there with a
[1:33:46] tumor on her chest was putting an
[1:33:48] ointment on in the stuff of seeing a
[1:33:50] doctor about it and sitting there in the
[1:33:51] service just rejoicing as we were
[1:33:53] sharing some of the things we've seen
[1:33:54] the Lord Jesus do and she was just
[1:33:56] rejoicing not even prayed for Lord but
[1:33:58] she goes home and took off her blouse
[1:33:59] she said to put some ointment on that
[1:34:01] tumor that was on her chest and when she
[1:34:03] took off her blouse the tumor was gone
[1:34:04] it had disappeared during the service oh
[1:34:07] that's the kind of God we serve that's
[1:34:09] the kind of God you are Lord like he did
[1:34:11] for brother James Tidwell over at the
[1:34:12] byc camp a few years ago when he had a
[1:34:14] tumor in his ear been there for three
[1:34:16] years and he would scab over and bleed
[1:34:17] and scab over and bleed but that night
[1:34:19] in the prayer line when we had everybody
[1:34:20] to lay hands on one another and pray for
[1:34:22] the needs of the people and brother
[1:34:24] brother James Tidwell just lay his hands
[1:34:25] on those young Brothers there and prayed
[1:34:27] with those young brothers and he went
[1:34:28] and laid down that night Lord and went
[1:34:30] to sleep when he woke up in the morning
[1:34:31] looked in the mirror that tumor that had
[1:34:33] been in his ear for three years was gone
[1:34:35] wasn't even a scab or nothing that's the
[1:34:37] kind of God you are Lord just like you
[1:34:39] did for our sister down there in
[1:34:40] Russellville Kentucky who had that tumor
[1:34:42] on her breast and it disappeared during
[1:34:44] the service that's the kind of God you
[1:34:46] are Lord as you did for Scott Smith's
[1:34:47] mother over in North Carolina who had
[1:34:49] the torn rotator cuff and right there at
[1:34:50] the end of the service you came down
[1:34:52] among the people she couldn't even raise
[1:34:54] her arm was up for surgery but she moved
[1:34:56] up on brother Scott's mother and the
[1:34:57] spirit of God moved upon her and healed
[1:34:59] her completely of a torn rotator cuff oh
[1:35:01] my how the roar went through the
[1:35:03] congregation when they saw Lord or the

[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:40] amen
[1:51:43] I wonder is there someone here
[1:51:47] that you
[1:51:48] you
[1:51:50] really wanted to come up for prayer
[1:51:55] but there was just something
[1:51:57] bothering you because you felt that it
[1:52:00] just wouldn't happen because with the
[1:52:02] expectation that it's got to happen now
[1:52:04] or it's not faith
[1:52:08] because that's the biggest trick of the
[1:52:10] devil
[1:52:12] if it don't happen right now
[1:52:15] then we think it's not Faith but we were
[1:52:18] told today that there's no limit to the
[1:52:22] promises of God as far as time is
[1:52:23] concerned
[1:52:25] so that should increase our faith to be
[1:52:28] able to come get prayed for and believe
[1:52:30] regardless of how we leave the building
[1:52:33] today it's going to happen
[1:52:36] and that we are to continue
[1:52:40] rejoicing in what we have been promised
[1:52:44] amen as if it did happen
[1:52:47] that moment even though it may not
[1:52:49] happen for two years we still got to
[1:52:51] testify of it every day we don't have to
[1:52:54] leave here feeling that we didn't have
[1:52:56] faith
[1:52:58] because it becomes a
[1:53:00] a trick of the enemy
[1:53:03] um
[1:53:04] you're trying to muster up Faith and
[1:53:05] feel defeated and we just got to leave
[1:53:08] here believing regardless of how we feel
[1:53:13] maybe we've just been letting doubt
[1:53:14] creep in because it didn't happen as
[1:53:16] fast as we wanted it
[1:53:18] God knows we want it God wants us to see
[1:53:21] us keep rejoicing maybe we just need to
[1:53:23] Rejoice more
[1:53:25] we need to take uh the attitude that we
[1:53:28] heard today through the scriptures and
[1:53:30] just hold on
[1:53:32] hold on to the promise Deliverance
[1:53:35] healing more the Holy Ghost more the
[1:53:38] character of God these are what God has
[1:53:40] promised all of us
[1:53:43] and let's just believe for it
[1:53:45] and and one thing something happens we
[1:53:48] want a testimony
[1:53:50] we want to sin and testify of it because
[1:53:52] it will increase all of our other faith
[1:53:55] amen yes
[1:53:58] yes pray God
[1:54:08] very very difficult dark dark days and I
[1:54:11] know I'm not the only one I know I'm not
[1:54:13] the only one
[1:54:14] but for a held on for about over three

[2:06:19] brother Daryl was telling me the older

[2:06:25] important things that we should be doing

[2:06:29] the time that we have and there's
[2:06:30] nothing more important than sharing
[2:06:32] Jesus with somebody amen amen
[2:06:37] um did anybody have any uh

[2:07:03] like
[2:07:06] you guys
[2:07:07] together we're just
[2:07:15] a small generator from Brother Johnson
[2:07:16] hey Ben
[2:07:22] come in here and enjoying the services
[2:07:24] amen well let's welcome our precious
[2:07:27] sister

[2:07:37] may we always make one another feel like
[2:07:41] they're best friends
[2:07:43] they're best friends yes straight has
[2:07:46] had something that was on my heart it
[2:07:47] has been for the last service but I
[2:07:50] never want to fail to hand out roses
[2:07:52] This Side of Heaven and it really spoke
[2:07:55] to my heart but I wanted to thank
[2:07:56] Brother Bruce
[2:07:59] when he came up and he gave that special
[2:08:01] he could have come up and did it perfect
[2:08:04] but I've heard him play Perfect yeah I
[2:08:06] know what he's capable of
[2:08:08] but to see him come up here
[2:08:10] and persevere amen and to see him be
[2:08:13] determined
[2:08:15] and to do it anyways yes it encouraged
[2:08:17] me because I know how difficult it is
[2:08:19] playing a mouth instrument and how any
[2:08:22] emotion that gets in there can
[2:08:23] completely throw off everything
[2:08:25] but I'll tell you the presence of the
[2:08:27] Lord blessed me so much by your mistakes
[2:08:30] but your perseverance amen and I want to
[2:08:32] thank you for coming up and being real
[2:08:34] it blessed me amen praise the Lord amen
[2:08:42] amen I didn't say that exact those exact
[2:08:45] words that it was real close when I took
[2:08:47] Brother Bruce I said when you when you
[2:08:49] play because it really
[2:08:52] whipped them out playing all those songs
[2:08:53] afterwards I said well just play one or
[2:08:56] two that's it just one or two it would
[2:08:58] be a great blessing to us so let's pray
[2:09:00] for our brothers praise for us continue
[2:09:02] to pray for his heart and
