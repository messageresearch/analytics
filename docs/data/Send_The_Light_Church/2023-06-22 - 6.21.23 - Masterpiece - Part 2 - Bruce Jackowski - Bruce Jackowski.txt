amen praise the Lord man I Hebrews chapter 1. God who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom Heath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins set down on the right hand of the Majesty on high amen let's Fire Hits for word of Prayer dear Lord Jesus we're so grateful Lord that you called us Heavenly Father we were lost without that call amen and Heavenly

thee in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen amen you may be seated praise the Lord so you have to forgive me for the so we started on the Masterpiece and I found out there was way too much in it so last time we just ran out of time we just ran out of time so I stopped that's that's the honest truth I just stopped so I'd like to continue on and amen amen so we're gonna do it a little different um I spent uh I don't know eight or nine years as a Sunday school teacher down in the basement of Ann Arbor so so I'm going to do a Sunday school we and where believe me we are not going to get where I want to go we're not going to get there but we're going to get somewhere that's what's going to happen we're going to get somewhere so if uh sister Amanda I want just go back to uh Hebrews verse 2. so we'll just start here I just want to so by time we get done tonight we should have shine some light on verse two and some light on verse 3. brother Brenner made it very clear that God was a great sculptor and that he had a masterpiece that he was trying to express to the world and and the last time when if if you go back and um look at we talked about Michelangelo because because brother Brandon talked about that and how that he made this this masterpiece of Moses and the things that were important in that was that no man had ever seen Moses but Michelangelo got so inspired in his mind that it drove him to create a masterpiece and in that so in order for him to do that he had to go and find a piece of granite that that when he looked at it it didn't look like Moses when you looked at it when he went and got the rock it was just a rock but when Michelangelo looked at it he saw Moses in that rock he saw the finished product even though the outside of it didn't look anything and brother brandem in that mess in the message the Masterpiece he said he said to the unlearned well Michelangelo was beating on it with a hammer and a chisel and things and breaking it down that the unlearned looked at it and said what what is it that you're doing because you cannot see what he had in his mind so verse 2 says he says hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom Heath appointed heir of all things and by whom also he made the worlds he did that by Jesus Christ well that doesn't seem possible because Jesus Christ was born three four thousand years after the world was created so how did he do that and then in verse 3 it says who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and and if you look at Express image of this person that means the essence of God the character of God so we want to start tonight I wonder read a quote out of who is this Melchizedek so brother Brandon says so now in the beginning God dwelt Alone with his attributes and sometimes you hear words but it's a lot easier if you can see it so here's God and because he's a being can everybody can you see that okay so we're making a McLeod because well who knows we've never seen God the Bible tells us that no man has ever seen God and he's a spirit he just moves he just goes different places but in the beginning brother Branham said he said God dwelt Alone with his attributes So within this cloud we're attributes an attribute is well an attribute is a little part of you so if I have the attribute of Roy right now I have the attribute of white hair and that's part of me and and I have failing eyesight so I have glasses that's part of me but I'm also quite the prankster that's an attribute of me and those dwell within me so so in the beginning there was God and he dwelt alone he didn't have angels yet because we find out well he he didn't have anything it was just him alone with his attributes and brother Brandon then says he says his attributes that's his thoughts so we find out that God dwelt Alone with his thoughts and his attributes now I didn't put this in the in the notes but most everybody can quote Genesis 1 1. in Genesis 1 1 says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth Hebrews 1 says Jesus Christ created their heavens and the Earth but in in Genesis 1 1 it says God created the heavens and the Earth if you go and look Moses when he wrote Genesis God is is the Hebrew word Elohim and Elohim means self-existing one self-existing he he just exists in eternity he has no beginning he has no end he's just there and he's got his attributes which is his thoughts thoughts of Peace thoughts of Joy thoughts all just all kinds of thoughts and they're all in him and we find out that God is a great Sculptor so he has something already in his mind that he wants to bring into manifestation but he has no way to do that because well he's a spirit now John 1 1. says this tells us that in the beginning was the word and it says the Word was God and the Word was with God and we all know that well the word is not Elohim the word is a is a Greek word called logos and logos is the essence of God himself so as God dwelt Alone with his attributes and his thoughts before he could even create the word he had to have a way to express that word and that was the logos which came out of God it was it was a pillar of fire though at that time because there was no eyes there was no Angels there was nothing but when the logos came forth the logos was all the thoughts all the attributes of God was in that logos and that logos then was able to create the heavens and the Earth because the very next thing so brother Branham says he said so you so he says just like a great architect he sat down and in his mind he drawed out what he was thinking what he's going to build he can create well an architect can't create he could take something that's already been created and make it into a different form because God is the only one he's the only one that can create but he gets in his mind what he's going to do and then that's his thoughts that's his desires and now it's a thought and then when he speaks it it becomes the word amen so the thoughts are here oh yeah this is a much bettering thank you brother Mark the thoughts became the word now when you thinking things you're just thinking things but when it comes out of your mouth you can't take it back so like they say you know make sure all your words are got plenty of sugar on them because you don't know which ones you got to eat [Laughter] so God in the beginning so you see I'm going to use this screen over here so he gets in his mind what he's going to do and that's his thoughts that's his desires that's his attributes now it's all hid but he's a great Master Sculptor amen and then he speaks it and then it's a word then amen now the next slide so it's go ahead sister so a word is a thought when it's expressed it's a word and then a thought expressed becomes or is a word but it has to be a thought first so it's God's attributes see so the attributes if you think about it and that's why this is this is really important love joy peace long-suffering gentleness kindness those are the attributes of the Holy Spirit yet man does not possess those attributes because man is a fallen nature he has a he's a fallen creature and he's he's angry all the time most of us are angry we just we just we have thoughts but they're not the thoughts of God so he has attributes and his attributes are the same as his thought and then it becomes a thought then it becomes a word but when it becomes a word so we find out in John 1 1 he said there he said though he said so in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was with God because you can't separate the two a man is what he says he is you are what you say you are that's how a man is known by what his words are but your words are empty because what they have to do is they have to manifest so a thought a thought is just a thought you think about it you know people have all kinds of thoughts and if they keep their their thoughts to themselves they never share their thoughts so they never share their words but if they share their words their words are empty unless they can manifest their word amen somebody has a thought they say oh I'm going to build something and then I'm going to share that with somebody well you're still not a builder unless you actually build something and that is the end of this circle you have to have all of those parts so God he didn't just they're in Hebrews he says hath in these last days spoken to us by his son whom Heath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds so he made the world by his thoughts becoming word and then becoming manifest amen so God when he wanted when he back in the beginning he had he had thoughts he had he wanted a family he wanted to be a redeemer he wanted to be a Healer he he had all of these these attributes that then he he could project them unto the logos and the logos then could act on that so when he said let there be light it wasn't God saying let there be light but it was the logo said let there be light and when it became word it wasn't complete until light came into existence when he created the heavens and the Earth he said let there be and then it became and it completed all of that amen so God in the beginning he had all these things hid away praise the Lord amen so go ahead sister Amanda so um I think it's the next slide after that oh good it's a this is a little different for me because I just get up and just go but I wanted you to see it he says so maybe I'll say it make it a little plainer when God speaks the word he doesn't need a man or any woman or no one else to say this is what it means when he says he says well God meant this God means just what he says he means see go ahead do the next one amen and now does he interpret his own word see by fulfilling it so I'm not just making this up that's that's what I want you to see the quotes so the a virgin shall conceive and she did now you think about that God before the foundation of the world already saw Mary already saw his Masterpiece he already saw this whole thing planned out in his mind because the Bible tells us that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world before before the logos even came in came into existence God already already in his attributes and his thoughts he'd already he'd already thought these things now when his thought his word came forth and Isaiah under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit he got in the he couldn't just say it in himself you can't just say it and you can't just speak you just you can't no man can create things no man can can do these things unless God be with him so Isaiah when Isaiah said uh Behold a virgin shall conceive everybody could doubt it because there was it never happened and Isaiah died and all the people that signed the prophecy they all died too the priest that was there the day that he gave it the king that he uziah the king and and when Isaiah gave those prophecies and that everybody in that Court they all died because it was 700 years later that that word became manifest amen amen it has to become manifest God does the fulfilling and he doesn't need an interpreter interpretation he says let there be light and there was and that doesn't need an interpretation amen praise the Lord amen so going to the next slide sister so God in preparing this masterpiece when God created this masterpiece he had to he had to pick elements it had to be made according to some thought that he had now God because he's the author of the word and he can't be separated from his word because Genesis 1 1 said God created the heavens and the Earth and John 1 says that logos created the heavens and the Earth so we can't be separated from the two so when he goes to create a masterpiece he's already got a precedent he's already got a way that he will do that and that is by the spoken word of God everything that God does has to come back to the word if it doesn't come back to the word then it's not God so when God was getting ready to create this masterpiece he had to put it on a a foundation so we found when we when we looked at um Michelangelo and when he created Moses when when he when he did that he put it on a foundation he didn't just create this the statue and just set it on the ground he actually created a foundation to set it on and God created a foundation for his masterpiece and he says that Foundation was the Patriarchs and the patriarch Foundation the first was Abraham and then Isaac so let's see if this will erase praise the Lord so God is going to create this masterpiece and we all know the Masterpiece is Jesus Christ right but he's got to put it on a foundation so he puts it on a foundation in the four corners of the foundation is Abraham Isaac Jacob and then Joseph amen go to go to the next slide sister so Abraham was the foundation of Faith how do we know that because Abraham when he heard the word of God he acted on it he acted on it when God said Abram I want you to leave your family I want you to go to a country you've never seen before I want you to follow me and Abram had to make a decision of this unseen God that he could feel because it it caught us attention and that word was so that thought had become it wasn't the written word yet but if that thought was so imprinted on Abram till Abram finally had to manifest that and come out or the chaldees he had to come out of that and that Foundation all of us if we don't have faith then our foundation's wrong our foundation will break just think if I'm going to put a I'm going to put a a big old heavy four or five ton statue on top of this rock this thing had better be perfect It better work so I'm going to put that I'm going to put God's Masterpiece on something that can't be shaken it's got to be able to stand the test so God took Abram and he gave Abram just simple little simple commands little simple things he revealed just little things to him and Abram every time he heard it then he had to act on it and God is very patient he waits for him to act on it when he acts on it then God gives him another little little thought gives them a little more attribute and everything that Abram does then reflects the invisible God it just keeps reflecting him it says so then the foundation of love was Isaac so Abram because he loved God gave him a promise brother John was you know preaching about that on Sunday he gave him a promise and Abram they go think about it Abram came up in his own mind between him and Sarah they came up in their own mind they said well God can't keep his word the promise that he gave you isn't coming to pass so maybe you could just go and take my Bond woman Hagar and you could have the baby from Hagar and he did he went into Hagar and he had Ishmael but when he had Ishmael that wasn't the word of God it was a perverted word amen it was still the promise because it had part of Abram in it that's why God couldn't that's why he couldn't destroy Ishmael because the Covenant was with Abram and Ishmael could he had the DNA of Abram in him so God can't Cur he can't destroy Ishmael without destroying Abram and if he destroys Abram then he has to destroy himself he has to he has to start all over and he doesn't make mistakes God doesn't make mistakes he's got a plan he's already he sees the future he knows the problems we're going to have tomorrow the next day he sees him he's because before he even created the heavens and the Earth he already figured it all out praise the Lord so we're never going to come up short on this you're going to say oh oh my my car broke down does the Lord know about it yeah he does all my boss got mad at me he fired me does the Lord know about it yeah he does God knows everything about us amen so the foundation of love was Isaac because God had to train Abram say Abram no no no no no no no look this covenant's between you and me and Sarah because Sarah is your wife Hagar is not and and when he did that then God expressed his word through Abram by taking him up on the mountain sacrificing right and God God took him up on the mountain he told Abram he says Abram now you've followed me all these years and he said now I want you to destroy the only evidence that you'll be the father of Nations to see if he would believe his word and he did he went he took Isaac up there we all know the story Abram when he got ready to slay him the angel of the Lord came down and said now I know Abram that you love me above everything else and that attribute was explained it was faith and then the foundation of love was through Isaac because Isaac then became the promised son and he had Rebecca and that's why I say you get in trouble real quick we could preach four hours on that so then he went and he found Grace was Jacob and Jacob Jacob actually didn't have any redeemable attributes and neither do we none of us are good we might think we're good but when a push come to shove we're we're not will lie to save our skin Abram did will will pull all kinds of shady deals in our lives but one day when the word comes and Crosses that thought it's a masterpiece God's grace was extended to Jacob Jacob you know Jacob went off and and uh he deceived his father the prophet and and he he ran off to Laban and when he got to Laban you know your sins will always find you out that's what Bible says that it will always find you out well Jacob he was a supplanter so when he gets over to Laban you know what they say be wary what you you know be careful what you plant because what you saw you Sharif so he was kind of crooked with his dad to get the birthright and he went over here and he saw Rachel and he says oh she's hot and he went right to Laban and said hey how long can I can I and he said not a problem he says work seven years I'll give you Rachel for a wife and he said I'll do it you know because Love is Blind right and the next thing that happened to him was when he got to the marriage and you have to understand um Jewish weddings because they have a veil and all you see is their eyes and they married under a tent and the priest and when he went in to his wedding chamber that after the after the ceremony was done and he took the veil off and he said who is this God had to train Jacob and Jacob found out he went back to he says wait wait wait wait wait wait he said didn't I say I work he says yeah but he says the older sisters got to be married before the younger so he said will you work seven years more so he did but see Jacob wasn't redeemed Jacob was still he's thinking and it says you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna figure this out so he figured out a way you know to have the ring ring straight cattle and the sheep and and and he and he stole everything away and then one day the word came and started to try him it started to try him and it bothered him and and it it drove him to do something that he didn't want to do and that was go back home he didn't want to go back home but there was something in the word that that caused them to do that and then there's all kinds of problems things that happen along the way but when he got down I'm just going to call it the River Jordan because I'm not sure what river it was but he got down there and he said he said his family I mean the guy's he's what man would do that I'm gonna meet somebody who's mad at me Esau my brother so I think what I'll do is I'll send my wife my kids I'll send all my my goods I'll give him a car I was I'll send all the gold and when he sees how rich I am maybe it'll soften his heart you see his heart was wrong and when he got down to pray and the angel of the Lord came down and talked to him he had to wrestle that out until that attribute was that attribute of deceiver was completely wiped off the Slate and God could manifest Grace in Jacob that's God just building a foundation and then and then brother random said he said in the last corner he says was Joseph and he says but when God saw Joseph he said Joseph was perfection amen can you put that back up there see Joseph was perfection there is no there was where he could set his Monument upon the First Foundation the second Foundation the third Foundation but on the fourth Foundation once once he had Joseph and brother random said he said the only thing that was against Joseph is he told one little tiny lie because he told he told pharaoh well he didn't tell Pharaoh but he told his brothers he says don't tell them you're sheep herders because she produced was Abomination to the Egyptians and brother random said was the only thing that he had on him so he laid these Foundation Stones down but you'll notice that when all of this took place there was no written word there was no written word not amen so he says so now the foundation is laid through faith love Grace and to Perfection through the Patriarchs and now the Bodywork that come on this to this Great Masterpiece was then the prophets amen see the prophets not the law the prophets for the prophets was the Vindicated word so when Moses came on the mountain I want to um each paragraph I got 66 up there okay he says so this Grace was the prophets which was the word and he says I hope you can read it see the prophets not the laws but you say wait a minute but I thought the law was the word it is but if it's not manifested then it's just a it's just dead letter this the scriptures Jesus said my words are spirit and life he said if you don't eat of the flesh or the son of a son of man and drink of his blood he says you have no part with me because if the word never is manifested it's just dead amen so he says the prophet's not the law the prophets for the prophets was the Vindicated word which makes the body not the Patriarchs the prophets they were the word so there's something that took place brother Brandon was showing that God had laid a foundation in the Book of Genesis and then once he had laid that Foundation where do they end up at the end of the book of Genesis they're in bondage in Egypt Joseph has died Jacob has died Abraham has died Isaac is there have all died they got just of the 12 tribes and they have gone down into Egypt they've gone down in the world and now God is going to start building on this Foundation and the very first thing that he brings on the scene is the the law Giver Moses Moses and Moses was a prophet he was born a prophet he was born a proper child and God did miraculous things for Moses amen but Moses was flawed amen Moses was flawed so in in the message the masterpiece brother Branham talks about going to Africa to the Kimberly diamond mine so that's my that's my diamond if you're wondering what that is but a diamond is just a rock and he says you know you can't take a rock and just crush it he says you have to cut it you have to cut it and so when you cut the Rock a little piece of the rock flies off you cut another piece and it flies off cut another piece that flies off when all these little pieces come off they're made out of the same thing the diamonds made out of and brother Branham says he says you don't take these little pieces and throw them away he said you wanna know what you do with the little pieces it says you put them on a victrola needle now of course we don't have victrolas anymore but he says you put it on there and he says and you have a plastic record and he says the record when you buy it at the store if you've ever bought a vinyl record when you buy it at the store it's the the vinyl cover says this is this is a record of Symphonies well you can take that and put it up next year and everything and you'll never hear a symphony you wanna you say oh this is Beethoven's Fifth well I don't hear nothing you got to put it on a device and then you got to take a diamond that was cut from the main Diamond to hear the Unseen music man the word of God I love it the word of God is unheard music see you can you can well I don't hear any love in here when I look in here he says Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt do this not do that but it's a love story but I don't hear it you got to be cut out into the Rock you got to be cut out of the rock to play the record you can't even play the record if you're not part of the Rock amen amen praise the Lord amen I want to make our Presbyterian shout and a few of you guys should be shouting you see that is that is when when we looked at Michelangelo that's the whole point the point is Michelangelo saw the vision and he searched he searched for a rock that when he looked at it he saw Moses right now when I look at you I don't see Jesus Christ but when God looks at you he sees your part of the rock praise the Lord amen amen amen amen amen sister Amanda which which paragraph We got up there Okay so so he says so the prophets the prophets were little pieces broken off The Rock the prophets reflected little attributes of the main diamond amen but not so the law of Moses the law of Moses did not reflect the diamond because the Bible tells me that he that wants to be a slave or a doer of the law let him be a doer of the whole law or lest he be a sinner and he's and what did he say I conclude that you're all under sin and none of you can keep the law I can't keep the law anybody who says they can keep the Ten Commandments as a lie or are they deceived or they've never read them or whatever and brother Branham brother random said see he said so the Masterpiece that God was creating was out of the prophets in each Prophet was the Fulfillment of a word of God amen amen amen go to the next one sister yes so and when God by the prophets and under the law he condemned us to sin that's all the law does the Bible says that without the law he says we would have not known sin he said that but when when the law came into the world then sin was revealed don't sweat the law look and said Thou shalt not take the Lord thy God's name in vain and then I found out I was a sinner before that I didn't know it I didn't know it was wrong to drink I didn't know it was wrong to gamble I didn't I didn't know any of these things but when the law came and when the law came the law was he was he was our jailer because he could get us into prison he could take us there really fast but he couldn't get us out amen but God had profits and every Prophet when a prophet was manifest there was Grace even though they rebuked Israel for backsliding and disobeying the law there was Grace there was love there was there was a reflection off the Masterpiece that we couldn't see because it's just a little chip it's just a little tiny bit amen see he says the law has no Grace it only tells you you are a sinner but when Jesus came on the scene he was the Fulfillment he was the Fulfillment of everything that God had promised amen he was the Masterpiece that God hid from Moses he hid him from Abraham he hid them from all the Patriarchs none of them he gave the promise to Adam he told the Adam after he kicked him out of the garden and he he cast judgment on them he told him he says he says they'll be coming one someday there will be one coming and he will bruise the Serpent's head and you will bruise his heel amen but they didn't know how it was going to work they didn't know all they knew is that they had done wrong and now their Fellowship was God was gone amen he was the perfect identical image of the promise therefore all the promises of the Old Testament was met in Jesus Christ it couldn't be met in um go to the next one it couldn't be met in Moses it couldn't be met at any of the prophets but it could be met in the masterpiece because Isaiah had failures Moses had failures Jeremiah had failures David who he was even reflected God's heart think of that but because he had failures God had to reject him amen amen praise the Lord [Music] um go up till we go let's let's go to Exodus 20. I want to show you that and sister Mandy you can oh okay you got it okay praise the Lord and verse 18. so I want you to see so here's God he's reflected in Moses they see him in Moses God has displayed his mercy and Grace to rebellious stiff-necked people because they were Abraham's seed that's the only reason why they came out they didn't come out because they were good they came out because God can't break his promise and God had told Abraham back in the Book of Genesis I wish we had time to do all he told him he told him he says Abraham know of assurity that your seed your promised seed will dwell in a Strange Land for 400 years and he said I with a mighty hand will bring them up out of there and bring them right back here to this land that flows with milk and honey amen God's gonna do that not Moses Moses thought he could he thought he was he he thought oh I got my doctor's degree I'm a great General I've gone down I conquered Ethiopia I teach the science I know all about science I I teach the Egyptians things I teach them all these things he said certainly my mommy told me the promise of God how I was born and how the alligators didn't eat me and how I was miraculously brought up in pharaohs in the federal government brought right up underneath their federal law then their law said destroy all the male children but God saved you Moses you're the deliverer from the time he was just a little boy mommy was telling him that every day she said I'm not she said well let me tell you let me tell you Moses You're the One You're the One You're The One Moses found out he could have knew it he thought he could do it but he can't and neither can you and one day God sent Moses way out into the into the desert and he got out there Moses out there and he's scratching his head for 40 years what did I do wrong how'd I end up here he says I thought I was the I I mean everything that I can I can quote the message to you I can read the scriptures I can show you in my life that I fulfill this and this and this and this and this and this and and I'm out here with these sheep brother Branham said remember what we said it was a thought then it had to become the word then it had to become manifest and one day the logos the logos showed up the logos came down in a pillar of fire and Moses said I ain't never seen anything like this [Music] God has a pillar of fire to get every one of our attention amen it got Moses's attention and Moses went up there do you ever think about that he went up there to a bush that was burning and he heard in his mind do you think he heard it out here take off your shoes Moses you stand on Holy Ground now he's got to display faith in order to fulfill the foundation are you going to take your shoes off or not I think I'll just take off my hat God would have never spoke to him said take off your shoes the land you're standing on is Holy Ground and then he took Moses right back to the word and he said now I have come down I the logos I have come down but I'm not going to do the work I'm sending you because people have never seen God they don't know how God I mean what do you think the pillar of fire we go in right before pharaoh God doesn't work that way God always has a representative he always has a little chip off the diamond and he he came down and stepped into Moses and Moses went down there I mean go home and try it go cut yourself a stick down all you want and pray and fast go on a 40-day fast and throw that stick down and see if it'll turn into a snake time and there's actually no scripture saying take a stick and throw it down on the ground and it'll turn into a snake but that was God's thought then it became a word and then when Moses did it it became a snake and that's how we know it was God's word if he said put your hand inside your bosom and it'll turn into leprosy and he'd have done that and pulled it out and it didn't turn into leprosy is a lion spirit but when he did it turned into that and when he put it back in there it came back out the scripture says it was soft as a baby's that's what he said and Moses went down and then Moses fulfilled God's Commission and you mean the children of Israel fought with him every step of the way they did they fought they complained they're everything else but yet they were the they were the children of the promise and when they got to the base of the mountain which was the end of the message to Moses the message to Moses was I want you to go get my people bring him here to this mountain and I'm going to come down and I'm going to have fellowship with my offspring and when he got them to the mountain that's how we got to uh verse 18. and all the people saw the thunderings and the Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off and they said unto Moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us lest we die think about it The Ten Commandments was not the voice of God the whole Book of Leviticus is not the voice of God but when a prophet speaks the word and it comes into existence that's God's voice so what brother Branham said which just seems kind of hard to understand but if you see it you go really he said the law wasn't part of the the diamond he says because the law didn't manifest it didn't manifest anything it just told you you were a sinner that's all it manifested that you were lost there's no hope don't even try give it up now because you're not going to be able to make it you can't memorize your way but if God ever speaks to you it was so totally change your life I remember right back brother Johnson I remember when I first got saved and I was at work brother Johnson knows me after I got saved I laughed like a crazy man forever and I'm still laughing because my burdens rolled away anyway and I had one guy he was I don't know what he was he made fun of me and everything else he said what is wrong with you and I said one day I found out that Jesus Christ died for me and my sins are completely rolled away and it made me so happy I can't get over it and I can't stop the joy of the Lord is our strength amen but it can't be your strength if it's just a scripture that you've memorized because it's just death it has to be made manifest it has to go from thought to word to manifestation amen it's got you amen it'll conquer every problem you have in your life oh my praise the Lord verse 20. and Moses said unto the people see even Moses tried to convince them they were they said No No Moses you speak with us and we will hear but let God speak with us lest we die Moses said unto the people don't fear God for God has come down to prove you so yes when you get saved it's wonderful but if he's come down next to you he's going to prove that love he's going to prove whether you got it or not God came down to prove you and that his fear may be before your faces that you sin not that's why David said I have hid Thy word in my heart that I might not sin against thee because the reality of God has to be with you every single day amen I remember thinking about how that you know the children of Israel now here they were in Exodus and they saw the Thunder and the lightning and the smoke and they saw all these things and and they had this discussion with Moses it doesn't say they discussed it with God they discussed it with Moses but God held them accountable to that because God was in Moses he was hid behind the veil and they said that and after that that's why brother Branham said he said the prophets he said it's the prophets he says it's not the law the law isn't what got them to the Masterpiece it was every one of these little chips off the main diamond but these little chips because they're little chips they're not the whole they're flawed Moses had a temper amen so I have to stop amen Moses had a temper you know the people were always getting on his nerves he was getting you know okay there there's more than once they got they got there you know when they came up out of Egypt they're coming down there and I always loved this they God is very specific brother Brandon said that you know he says it'd be a very poor General to lead you into a trap but God does God took him right up to the edge of the red seed he said there was a city to the North and the city to the South and he says in the Egyptians behind them so that they had nowhere else to go but ahead everybody we want an easy way out of here but I'm going to tell you right now we're gonna have to go forward and Moses Moses not because of Moses because he he talked to God lift the ear you ever think about that it was because of the people that Moses said to God he says God what do I do if Moses didn't have all the people he'd just said okay Lord he says you got the ride go forward but the people put pressure on Moses well he didn't burst that time then they put pressure on him when they ran out of water they said ah Moses should brought us out here there's no water and you bring us out here and it's an oasis and the water's bitter and he says and we can't drink it but yet God had already with every trial and Temptation maketh a way of Escape right the tree was already there the tree of life was already there he cut the branches off the tree put it in the water and made the bitter water sweet the people were happy until they ran out of food then they were mad at Moses again and they tried him again and Moses got you know and they kept doing it and doing it and doing it they gave him water out of the rock Moses did that too but one day they got they pushed him to The Living End and he smote The Rock and God said no as a prophet you cannot magnify yourself above me and the church should never magnify themselves above the Living God Amen and it cost him it cost him but you know he did the same thing to the masterpiece in Matthew he took him out into the desert the Bible says we're not going to get to it but he took him out there the Bible says that the spirit of God LED Jesus out into the desert and he fasted 40 days and 40 nights and the devil came to him the devil looked at him and said you know what if you're the Son of God no I'm not saying you aren't but you could be but just in case I could use a little bit of proof here don't you feel like that when you pray devil sits on your shoulder and says well you know if you were a real believer God will make it come to pass go ahead come on you have need of this let's do it yeah same devil in Jesus could turn stones into bread because he turned two fishes two loaves and five fishes and I mean he fed five thousand then he fed four thousand he could do it right but see he was tied to the Unseen God he was an attribute of the Unseen God Amen amen and he took him up on on top of the Pinnacle he says cast yourself down he says here look I'll even show you where the scriptures are says lest you dash your foot against the stone his angels will pick you right up it's your Bible you do believe your Bible don't you Jesus you do believe that right and then he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and what was he trying to do he was just trying to find a flaw in the masterpiece amen but there wasn't any amen praise the Lord amen so praise God we're just gonna have to bow our heads let's all Stand Together amen amen dear Lord Jesus we are grateful we are grateful for the things that you have hidden in your word and Lord there's so much brother Brandon told us one time he said you take that diamond and he says and when you turn it in the light it'll it'll show out as seven colored rainbow and and when you turn it on one side and you see the facet you see Abraham you turn it again and and you see John the Baptist and you turn it again and you see Isaiah but lord they're all cut off of that main diamond Lord Jesus I pray I just ask that you just take this simple message this little time that you've given to us may it open our eyes father the Lord if we were a thought with you before the world was ever created then we will manifest the word when it's presented to us heavenly father I pray that you'll just let us meditate on these things and Lord may you speak to our hearts may you make our path straight and may you make our past clear to us that we can know what you'd have for us to do Lord whatever it is we just commit Our Lives we commit the Saints father into your hands for your honor and your glory in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen praise the Lord amen I was trying to think what the song is nations are breaking because that's that's the day of redemption is near and it gets the name of it but God is looking for us to yield to his word and let his holy spirit anoint it and let it live and when it lives then then you have confidence there's no more doubt after that so if he can do this let's see if if God if God could do this for me then he can take me out amen amen nations are breaking Israel's Awakening the signs at the prophets foretold the Gentile days number with Horrors in Comfort eternity soon will unfold the day of redemption is their man's hearts are failing for fear be filled with the spirit your lamb streamed and clear here look up your Redemption is here the Fig Tree is growing Jerusalem's restory her National lifelong gay throne today she is calling her letter it's falling
