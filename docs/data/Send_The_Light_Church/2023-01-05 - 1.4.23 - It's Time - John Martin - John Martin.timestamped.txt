[10:26] Ron had made mention
[10:28] of these
[10:30] couple of these verses here starting
[10:31] with verse number one two everything

[11:36] have he
[11:37] that worketh in that wherein he labereth
[11:41] I have seen the travail which God hath
[11:44] given to the sons of men to to be
[11:47] exercised in it
[11:49] he have made everything beautiful
[11:52] in his time amen God bless you may be
[11:56] seated
[11:59] our hearts will go out to brother Marty
[12:03] and his children and the grandchildren
[12:07] just
[12:10] uh
[12:12] knowing
[12:13] that separation has come and taken place
[12:19] it isn't like going on vacation or being
[12:21] separated for a little bit you come back
[12:23] and you're joined together this is
[12:27] for the rest of time while we're here
[12:31] and it is something that we as a church
[12:36] will need to uh
[12:42] continually help brother Marty
[12:46] love him hug him
[12:50] tell him how much he means to you and
[12:53] and how much sister Kathleen has meant
[12:57] to you as well
[12:59] because even though our sister is not
[13:01] going to be in church here anymore the
[13:04] memory of our sister will always remain
[13:06] with us
[13:09] I am happy to report that brother Marty
[13:13] is doing well
[13:16] um each time that we had seen them
[13:19] he is doing well he's doing so well
[13:22] today that I couldn't help but to tell
[13:24] him how well he is doing and he reminded
[13:28] me of his parents telling him when he
[13:31] was younger that he was always the
[13:34] strong one
[13:35] but his attitude helps
[13:38] and and his children it reflects off and
[13:43] their children they're doing well in the
[13:45] last
[13:47] um
[13:48] evening everyone got to be around
[13:51] a sister Kathleen that very night and it
[13:56] was wonderful and they're very grateful
[14:00] for that time that they had
[14:02] I will say that most everyone that that
[14:05] we know that knows her in some fame or
[14:09] some some fashion former way are our
[14:12] grieving to some degree
[14:14] and they will be having a memorial
[14:16] service
[14:19] um Saturday some sort of memorial
[14:21] service Saturday January 14th that's all
[14:24] we knew we just got that information
[14:26] like an hour before they had decided it
[14:29] will not be here because the church
[14:31] cannot hold the people so it's going to
[14:34] be at their daughter's church and I'm
[14:36] not sure that they're going to be an
[14:39] officiating of it I'm not sure exactly
[14:41] how it's going to go but we're all of
[14:44] course invited and it would be good to
[14:47] go and show our support amen
[14:51] our sister Kathleen had been attending
[14:55] our church for around 20 years
[14:59] and she had been faithful from the
[15:03] beginning
[15:05] she had been faithful from the beginning
[15:09] honestly from the time she stepped in
[15:11] brother Marty stepped in they paid
[15:13] tithes
[15:15] and they didn't miss a Beat
[15:18] and never had to well we'll just wait a
[15:21] month no it was never like that
[15:24] they had a revelation of ties they were
[15:27] faithful to it and the reason I'm
[15:30] bringing this up
[15:32] is uh two days before she had passed
[15:35] away were talking to brother Marty and
[15:37] sister Kathleen and she didn't have a
[15:40] lot of strength to where she could talk
[15:43] so she'd have to muster up the strength
[15:44] and to say something and she'd say
[15:47] give up the ties
[15:51] here she is I told her I said it says
[15:54] your
[15:57] in this condition
[15:59] and you're worried about your ties
[16:04] but it was to God see those ties belong
[16:06] to God
[16:09] and I'm saying this is the type of
[16:11] people
[16:13] they are this is the type of sister that
[16:15] she was she was faithful when she wasn't
[16:19] here she was
[16:21] she prayed for all of us she was a
[16:24] prayer where she was one of the prayer
[16:26] warriors of this church
[16:31] and I'm sure on the other side we'll
[16:34] we'll know all about it but she was a
[16:37] faithful member to the body of Christ
[16:38] into this little assembly here
[16:41] she loved the word of God
[16:43] and she loved the message of the hour
[16:45] amen
[16:47] she loved the five-fold Ministries she
[16:50] always expressed how thankful she was
[16:51] for the fivefold ministry here and of
[16:53] course she she loved the ministry here
[16:55] and she often wanted a a copy of our of
[16:59] of the of the notes
[17:01] and uh I felt a little funny about it
[17:05] because you know what are my notes but
[17:10] um she just loved the word and she loved
[17:13] to study the word and she would talk
[17:15] about the things that she would study
[17:16] and how often they were right in
[17:19] continuity with Sunday school as you
[17:21] know she was uh she taught Sunday school
[17:24] for years
[17:26] she believed in every promise of God
[17:29] Amen and she held to those promises
[17:33] Faithfully to the end
[17:35] she believed that God was faithful to
[17:38] his word that he had never failed one
[17:40] time of the promises of God
[17:45] she was a faithful servant of God in her
[17:47] church as well in her home
[17:53] she was the church nurse but she also
[17:56] was a nurse in the hospital and she just
[17:59] cared about people and many of us or
[18:01] some of us she you know when she talked
[18:06] to you she was concerned about you yeah
[18:09] and uh she was just faithful to do her
[18:13] very very best and she used to tell me
[18:16] about
[18:18] people not wanting to listen to her
[18:21] she would she would get up here and she
[18:23] would tell us how many times to wash her
[18:25] hands
[18:26] and to to not spread germs and to stay
[18:30] home if you were sick and
[18:32] she really cared
[18:34] we appreciate appreciate the example the
[18:37] role model I would tell her I said
[18:40] I didn't wait
[18:42] to the end
[18:44] through the years I would tell her I
[18:45] look up to you sister Kathleen
[18:48] because I believe that there's Christ in
[18:51] one another and we should be able to see
[18:54] things in one another that we look up to
[18:57] them amen amen I believe that with all
[19:00] my heart you don't want to wait till
[19:02] it's too late
[19:03] to express how much you care and love
[19:06] one another I can't I I can't express
[19:09] enough how important it is
[19:12] how much it encourages and help one
[19:15] another to let them know how much you
[19:18] love and appreciate them
[19:20] every Sunday she would come to church
[19:22] early
[19:24] she was earlier than anyone
[19:27] and of course she wanted to get ready
[19:28] for Sunday School
[19:30] prepare but she also wanted she'd
[19:33] practice uh tuner dulcimer and get that
[19:36] ready
[19:37] but what was so remarkable she wanted to
[19:40] come and pray for the service pray for
[19:44] the ministry pray for the Saints
[19:47] she took it serious and she was as
[19:51] faithful as faithful to be about you
[19:53] could I'd just be there and she'd pop in
[19:55] and right there
[19:57] just like clockwork
[20:00] and it really done something for the
[20:02] ministry when there's someone there
[20:05] who you know is Faithfully praying for
[20:08] the ministry because I believe prayers
[20:10] are the backbone of the ministry I
[20:12] believe that
[20:17] you could count on her
[20:19] she wanted to put her shoulder to the
[20:21] wheel about things
[20:24] she was always concerned
[20:27] she worked non-stop for Jesus
[20:31] she was always looking for opportunities
[20:33] to share the message with somebody she
[20:35] would tell me those different ones that
[20:37] she would talk to
[20:39] she will be greatly missed
[20:43] and I was telling brother Mark before
[20:44] service there is no one
[20:47] that will be able
[20:49] to take her place
[20:51] she'll be missed with tears shall be
[20:54] missed with sorrow shall be missed with
[20:56] great memories
[21:00] personally this is me I believe that if
[21:03] she could stand here today
[21:06] after being on the other side
[21:10] she would tell us
[21:12] to press on
[21:14] to what this message taught us
[21:19] get perfect love because nothing but
[21:21] perfect love can enter in
[21:24] and we need to press on we need to press
[21:28] on no one that's ever gone to the other
[21:31] side and has come back has come back
[21:33] with a testimony or if I could just stay
[21:35] here for a little bit longer with you
[21:37] guys
[21:39] it was why did you call me back and and
[21:42] I don't want to be here
[21:44] and and and she's in a better place
[21:47] she is free from the pain that she was
[21:50] suffering and and to sit there and watch
[21:52] her suffer brother Marty was watching it
[21:55] for months
[21:57] months and he's had I don't mean it
[22:01] wrong but he's had much time to grieve
[22:05] and his share that he lost her uh a
[22:09] while ago
[22:10] [Music]
[22:11] but we it was a shock to us
[22:15] and
[22:17] it's okay if we grieve it's okay however
[22:21] we feel
[22:22] because it's natural
[22:25] and you don't want to bottle up things
[22:28] but we need to come to the realization
[22:31] that she's doing real well today
[22:35] she's doing real well today
[22:39] I'd like to title this message it's time
[22:44] if you're in pain you hurt
[22:46] it's time to grieve
[22:48] if you're thinking of sister Kathleen's
[22:50] new body and her being set free forever
[22:53] then it's time to rejoice
[22:56] when we had opportunity to pray with her
[22:58] the last couple of days it was it was
[23:01] hard
[23:02] it's hard seeing her like this and it
[23:05] was hard for her
[23:07] but she had muster up just enough
[23:09] strength to say praise the Lord
[23:14] in that condition
[23:16] praising the Lord I believe it's always
[23:18] time to praise the Lord
[23:21] amen it's always time to praise the Lord
[23:24] she had a good attitude
[23:26] amen and to everything there's a season
[23:29] and a time to have repurpose under
[23:30] Heaven a time to be born and a time to
[23:34] die
[23:36] you walk in or drive into any cemetery
[23:39] and you'll see uh tombstones with two
[23:42] dates on them person's name and two
[23:44] dates
[23:46] and it was the time that they were born
[23:49] and the time that they died
[23:51] and when you look at those dates
[23:55] they're all ready set
[24:02] couldn't change them that was what was
[24:05] ordained to be
[24:07] all right
[24:11] and when we look back and we see those
[24:13] tombstones and we hear about a person's
[24:16] life uh
[24:17] Smith's Wigglesworth or somebody that's
[24:20] going on to be with the Lord
[24:24] there was a time that they were born in
[24:26] a time that they died and we accept that
[24:34] and when we're looking ahead
[24:38] we don't know when we're going to die
[24:43] we don't know we don't know who's going
[24:45] to be left to go on a Rapture and we
[24:47] don't know who's going to die prior we
[24:50] don't know
[24:52] but when we're in this this place called
[24:55] the middle and we see the actual end
[24:58] take place
[25:00] it shocks us as if something is wrong
[25:05] especially because
[25:09] we believed
[25:12] that our sister was going to be healed
[25:15] come on now
[25:18] and we didn't see it
[25:21] [Music]
[25:22] it didn't make it wrong
[25:30] it's in God's time God is in control
[25:36] the time to die always brings rise to
[25:40] questions
[25:41] especially why
[25:44] where is the time to be born seems to be
[25:46] more understandable more in order more
[25:48] more joyous we don't question a
[25:51] beautiful new baby being born we don't
[25:53] say why did this happen
[25:57] we're rejoicing
[26:00] but when
[26:01] the time of death comes
[26:04] about it stirs up many questions inside
[26:07] of us
[26:09] many of those questions can come into
[26:12] our minds
[26:14] and they will stay unanswered
[26:20] these unanswered questions can open the
[26:23] door for confusion
[26:25] for doubts
[26:27] for Fears
[26:28] they can affect our lives and sometimes
[26:30] even leave us scarred
[26:33] I wonder how many can raise your hand
[26:36] and say I was asking why
[26:41] amen amen
[26:45] how come why didn't she get healed
[26:51] I mean the very fact that these
[26:53] questions that come into our mind
[26:56] bring confusion and doubt and fears and
[26:59] make us angry and upset
[27:04] let us know that they don't come from
[27:06] God
[27:07] because God is not the author of
[27:09] confusion God has not given us the
[27:12] spirit of fear
[27:14] but we know the enemy is doing what he
[27:17] can
[27:18] to bring us down and to Hold Us in
[27:21] Chains and to to get us to stop
[27:23] believing in the word of God and
[27:25] trusting God that he's faithful
[27:30] one question that can pass to our mind
[27:32] as Believers is why wasn't so and so
[27:37] healed
[27:39] why wasn't so-and-so we know a number of
[27:41] of Believers that have have died from
[27:45] different diseases and different things
[27:48] Through the Ages
[27:50] it's a good question
[27:53] why was it so and so healed
[27:55] but honestly it's none of your business
[27:59] it's none of your business it's God's
[28:01] business
[28:02] [Music]
[28:03] it's God's business
[28:05] he's The Giver of Life the lord giveth
[28:08] and the lord taketh away blessed be the
[28:11] name of the Lord
[28:12] Lord has his reasons
[28:16] to everything there's a season
[28:19] time to be born a time to die we cannot
[28:22] change the season
[28:25] God chooses it for us
[28:28] God chose us out of a million people
[28:34] to be born into this life
[28:37] and by God's foreknowledge he knew the
[28:41] very year the very day the very minute
[28:45] that our time would be up
[28:52] if it's God's time
[28:55] there ain't enough doctors there ain't
[28:56] enough medicine
[28:58] and there is not enough believers
[29:06] now now listen to me
[29:08] yes God raises the Dead
[29:15] God has raised it God God will raise the
[29:18] Dead
[29:19] it is God's word
[29:22] but that doesn't mean that there's not a
[29:25] end to the season
[29:31] and we must understand that we don't
[29:33] know when the end of the season that
[29:34] somebody's life is
[29:36] but whenever that end is
[29:39] that's the end we don't change it we
[29:42] don't change God's mind we don't say
[29:45] this is the way things are going to be
[29:47] because we didn't create the life
[29:51] we didn't author their life and and
[29:53] we're certainly not one to say
[29:57] it's not time it's never time to
[30:00] separate from some but I never want to
[30:02] accept I want heaven to start right now
[30:05] I'm serious I don't want to go through
[30:07] separation and and that
[30:11] foreign
[30:17] if God raises somebody for the dead and
[30:19] brother Johnson here is testified
[30:24] that means it was not time
[30:26] the season wasn't over
[30:29] I remember when I was young I got a job
[30:33] doing a Cabinetry and I was a young
[30:37] believer in brother Johnson's church and
[30:40] I as young believers you're on fire for
[30:43] God and you want to share Jesus with
[30:45] everybody and so I was sharing Jesus
[30:48] with my boss
[30:51] and my boss was not a Believer he didn't
[30:54] believe in God
[30:57] and so he added more out for me he
[30:59] watched me real close
[31:02] but I'll never forget this
[31:05] he be he told me of a out of a body
[31:08] experience that he had he died he got
[31:10] there was an accident he died he was
[31:13] lifted up and he was up
[31:16] in in the air and he was looking down
[31:19] on his body and he was looking down on
[31:21] the men the the ambulances that were
[31:24] trying to get him to come back
[31:27] oh
[31:29] and uh and they revived them obviously
[31:32] he came back
[31:34] and here was a person that did not
[31:35] believe in God and saw this thing happen
[31:40] if it's not time
[31:43] it's not time
[31:46] but if it's time it's time and that's
[31:49] what I want to say we just got to trust
[31:52] God it's not what we want it's not what
[31:55] we feel but it doesn't mean anything was
[31:57] wrong right foreign
[32:02] we gotta tell the devil where he belongs
[32:04] he don't belong in our minds he don't
[32:07] belong in our thoughts
[32:10] right amen this message may not be for
[32:13] everybody in every area but it needs to
[32:16] go for those where it's meant to go for
[32:18] amen
[32:23] if it's not time I believe Believers can
[32:26] say to this mountain be thou removed and
[32:28] it will be removed and
[32:30] but if it's time there's nothing we can
[32:33] do
[32:36] I remember hearing brother Brandon
[32:38] talking about a lady that was
[32:40] deathly sick and she was going to die
[32:43] and they asked brother Brandon to pray
[32:45] for her and many ministers had prayed
[32:48] for her she was a a well-known uh
[32:53] person
[32:55] I can't remember the story well but I do
[32:58] remember this that there was even a
[33:00] prophecy that went out over her that she
[33:03] was going to get healed
[33:06] and brother Branham and they just wanted
[33:09] brother Branham to pray and to believe
[33:11] because he had this gift and and that
[33:13] she would be healed because they didn't
[33:14] want her to die
[33:16] and brother Brandon said she was not
[33:19] going to live
[33:21] no matter what
[33:25] because
[33:26] there is a season there's a time to be
[33:30] born and a time to die and it's in God's
[33:32] hands and it doesn't belong in the hands
[33:34] of man
[33:38] so we would like to change things and
[33:41] we'd like to control things and we like
[33:42] to say why things are and why things are
[33:45] not but you know
[33:47] we're no match for God
[33:50] we're no match for God
[33:56] amen God's will will always supersede
[33:59] our desires and our will amen when the
[34:02] time has arrived it has arrived
[34:06] brother Daryl
[34:07] told me when he was here before
[34:11] this last time and he had
[34:13] prayed for sister Kathleen
[34:16] he said that he was in the Army and when
[34:18] he was in the army that he had about 10
[34:21] or 12 commands that were given to him
[34:24] that everyone that was in the Army had
[34:26] to do
[34:27] you just had to do it
[34:29] but if a commanding officer would tell
[34:31] him to do something different
[34:35] he said that was the only time that
[34:38] those commands could be
[34:40] superseded
[34:43] is when a commanding officer said no you
[34:45] don't have to do that this is what I
[34:47] want you to do
[34:49] and he went on to explain to me
[34:51] that we have commands in the Bible they
[34:54] shall lay hands on the sick or they
[34:56] shall recover
[34:57] and to pray one for another and and we
[35:02] have these commands right here but if
[35:07] our commanding officer Jesus Christ
[35:11] says different for that situation it
[35:15] supersedes what he wants for that moment
[35:20] and we must remember it's not us that's
[35:23] got everything figured out
[35:26] God's got it figured out and we've got
[35:29] to trust him we just got to follow suit
[35:31] do what the word says and trust God for
[35:35] the rest of it
[35:38] God does everything beautiful in his
[35:40] time turn with me if you would to II
[35:43] Samuel chapter 12 verse 15.
[35:47] David had a child that suffered and died
[35:54] we know the some of us know the story
[35:56] here second Samuel chapter 12
[36:00] verse 15 and Nathan departed unto the
[36:03] house unto his house and the Lord struck
[36:06] the child that Uriah wife bear unto
[36:10] David and it was very sick
[36:14] now David therefore besought God for the
[36:17] child
[36:18] and David fasted and went in and laid
[36:22] all night upon the Earth you could see
[36:25] that David was really
[36:28] reaching out to God God will you change
[36:31] the situation for my
[36:34] my child and the Elders of the house
[36:37] arose and went to him to raise him up
[36:40] from the Earth but he would not neither
[36:43] did he eat bread with him and it came to
[36:45] pass on the seventh day that the child
[36:48] died and the Servants of David feared to
[36:52] tell him that the child was dead for
[36:54] they said behold while the child was yet
[36:57] alive we we spake unto him and he would
[37:00] not hearken unto our voice how will he
[37:02] then that's himself would we tell him
[37:04] that the child is dead
[37:06] but when David saw his servants
[37:08] whispered David perceived that the child
[37:11] was dead therefore David said unto his
[37:14] servants is the child dead and they said
[37:18] he is dead
[37:20] then David arose from the earth and
[37:22] washed and anointed himself changed his
[37:25] apparel and came to the house of the
[37:28] Lord and He worshiped
[37:30] then he came to his own house and when
[37:32] he and when he required and when he
[37:36] required they set bread before him and
[37:39] he did eat
[37:41] this is after the death had taken place
[37:44] he's just changing his old demeanor
[37:46] about the situation there was no
[37:50] grieving uh expressions of grieving
[37:53] going on there was one of them moving
[37:55] forward are you with me
[38:01] and then verse 21 then said his
[38:04] servant's unto him what thing is this
[38:07] that thou has done
[38:09] thou did as fast and weep for the child
[38:12] while it was a lie but when the child
[38:14] was dead thou did US rise and eat bread
[38:18] they wanted to know what was going on
[38:21] and then he said while the child was yet
[38:24] alive
[38:25] I fasted
[38:27] I wept
[38:29] for I said who can tell whether God will
[38:33] be gracious to me that the child may
[38:36] live
[38:37] but now he is dead therefore should I
[38:40] fast can I bring him back again
[38:44] I shall go to him
[38:47] but he shall not return to me
[38:50] amen
[38:52] I shall go to him
[38:56] we shall go
[38:59] to Sister Kathleen to those that have
[39:01] crossed to the other side but they
[39:03] cannot come back
[39:05] I just read this verse 24 and David
[39:07] Comfort Bathsheba his wife and went into
[39:10] her and lay with her and she Bears son
[39:12] and called his name Samuel and the Lord
[39:14] loved him
[39:15] I just love
[39:18] the the the the
[39:20] attitude we don't know what the Lord
[39:24] would do
[39:26] I mean we've heard through the message
[39:29] we've heard through ministers that
[39:31] sometimes sickness is allowed to be on
[39:33] people because of reasons that God is
[39:36] trying to deal with are you with me
[39:40] and God I've heard some ministers say
[39:42] God doesn't even want us praying those
[39:44] things off
[39:46] because God wants those things dealt
[39:48] with
[39:50] see this is what I'm saying this stuff
[39:52] is not our business it's God's business
[39:55] God has called us to pray for one
[39:58] another to believe the word for one
[40:00] another and what happens happens
[40:04] that's it
[40:05] that's it be a faithful servant to
[40:07] Christ just do his his bidding do his
[40:10] will
[40:13] David couldn't change the mind of God
[40:18] I had a brother who lived less than four
[40:20] days on Earth
[40:22] was that fair was that right why did
[40:25] that happen I mean the questions could
[40:28] go endless
[40:30] but God had
[40:32] his time a set time a season
[40:36] I had a father who died at the hands of
[40:39] a doctor who was just doing a routine
[40:40] biopsy
[40:44] I'll tell you when I got that phone call
[40:47] there was such a awesome peace and I was
[40:51] just a very young believer I think
[40:54] brother Johnson was out of town in a
[40:55] mission trip
[41:03] and I couldn't explain it but I knew it
[41:07] was not the doctor's fault
[41:09] all right
[41:12] because I trusted in God
[41:14] God is in control and the quicker we can
[41:18] trust God that he's in control of things
[41:19] the less we'll get bothered and upset
[41:23] because we seem to take things into our
[41:25] own hands all the time
[41:27] for what reason to show God how ignorant
[41:30] we are
[41:34] God is awesome he knows what he's doing
[41:37] and he will say sorry to no man on the
[41:39] day of judgment there will be no
[41:42] mistakes
[41:44] and the more we can under
[41:47] take that into our hearts the more we
[41:49] can walk with the trust and the
[41:51] soberness that no matter what we go
[41:53] through all things work together for the
[41:56] good
[41:57] we got to trust him
[42:01] no matter what
[42:03] I'm so thankful that God gave us time to
[42:06] pray and fast with sister Kathleen
[42:10] I am
[42:11] I'm thankful for brother Daryl and all
[42:13] the ministers who laid hands on her and
[42:15] and the handkerchiefs
[42:18] we prayed for and that she held on to
[42:21] for so long I am grateful for that
[42:26] amen I'm grateful for every brother and
[42:29] every sister that came to the Altar and
[42:31] prayed with when she could even barely
[42:34] walk to get up here
[42:35] I counted an honor to about a grab her
[42:38] arm and lift it up because she couldn't
[42:39] lift it herself
[42:41] and praise the Lord with her amen
[42:48] but what has happened has happened and
[42:51] it's in God's hands
[42:55] I'm thankful for every soldier of the
[42:57] cross that believed the word of God and
[43:00] that he keeps his Commandments
[43:03] it was God's time it was God's will
[43:06] God is in control his thoughts are
[43:09] higher than our thoughts and he don't
[43:11] have to tell us why
[43:13] you know when that happened to my dad I
[43:16] never said why when that happened to my
[43:17] brother I never said why
[43:21] no
[43:22] if God wants to tell me something he'll
[43:25] tell me he wants to reveal something to
[43:27] me he will
[43:29] I think he's looking for me to have a
[43:32] right attitude
[43:33] I think that's what he's looking for
[43:34] first
[43:39] it never seems to be our time when
[43:42] somebody leaves never
[43:44] separation will cause grief
[43:47] it'll start a roller coaster ride of
[43:50] anxiety
[43:53] persistent traumatic grief can cause us
[43:56] to cycle through different stages we've
[43:59] all heard about the different stages of
[44:01] grief and most of us have dealt with it
[44:03] at one time or another our human nature
[44:07] wants to
[44:11] fight accepting
[44:14] this current change that's happened
[44:18] and we deny certain things we
[44:22] um
[44:26] begin to uh
[44:29] we want to even bargain with God
[44:32] we're going to be a better person we'll
[44:33] do this
[44:35] a lot of things transpire when we're
[44:38] dealing with a separation
[44:41] foreign
[44:42] it can even cause us to go into
[44:44] depression
[44:48] look what happened to Peter when he
[44:50] finally had to deal with
[44:53] Jesus separating from him now Jesus told
[44:55] him ahead of time I'm going to separate
[44:58] don't let your heart be troubled I'm
[44:59] going away but I'm going to come back he
[45:02] even told him that the elders and the
[45:04] chief priests are going to take them and
[45:06] and crucify him and so he they knew
[45:08] ahead of time
[45:11] and he said I'm going to send you a
[45:12] comforter he's going to comfort you
[45:14] during
[45:15] comfort you he's going to be with you
[45:16] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[45:19] but when the actual time transpired
[45:23] and they were taken Jesus away from him
[45:26] and that separation was happening look
[45:29] at the grief that was starting to take
[45:31] place Peter started acting like he never
[45:33] acted before
[45:35] started saying I don't even I don't even
[45:37] know him denying him cursing that he
[45:39] even knew Jesus
[45:43] so I'll say it like this no matter what
[45:47] we go through
[45:50] it's okay
[45:52] it's okay
[45:54] because this flesh this human part of us
[45:58] has a hard time dealing with separation
[46:02] but just know when the dust settles God
[46:05] is in control
[46:07] and God has something for us to help us
[46:12] through
[46:13] these times
[46:15] do you believe that
[46:18] we need to keep our focus on God's
[46:21] perfect will that he's in control as
[46:23] much as possible
[46:25] God views death and much differently
[46:28] than we do
[46:30] to us it's the end
[46:33] to God it's the beginning of a life
[46:35] without sorrow without pain without any
[46:39] kind of crying and and hurt and and and
[46:45] Psalms 116 verse 15 says precious in the
[46:49] sight of the Lord is the death of his
[46:51] Saints
[46:53] precious in the sight of the Lord I'll
[46:57] tell you when I was with sister Kathleen
[46:58] I said sister Kathleen I want you to
[47:00] understand this that right now what's
[47:02] going on is something precious in the
[47:05] sight of the Lord
[47:07] and I said I want to just give you the
[47:09] John Martin version precious in the
[47:11] sight of the Lord is the crossing over
[47:13] Jordan of his Faithful Servants
[47:16] amen
[47:18] I believe it
[47:27] because God knows
[47:29] that person is going to be so happy
[47:33] [Music]
[47:34] not having to be interfered with the
[47:37] devil's thoughts and negativity and
[47:39] anxiety and burden about this no set
[47:44] free from all that
[47:46] Hallelujah
[47:47] [Music]
[47:51] God has something for us to deal with
[47:53] this new reality
[47:55] it's only found in him it's peace
[48:00] he is the Prince of Peace but he's not
[48:02] only the Prince of Peace he is our peace
[48:05] the Bible says he is our peace John 14
[48:09] verse 27 says peace I leave with you my
[48:14] peace I give unto you not as the world
[48:16] giveth give I unto you let not your
[48:19] heart be troubled neither let it be
[48:21] afraid
[48:22] it's Jesus is telling us that we have
[48:25] control of what we're going to think
[48:27] about
[48:31] look we sing that song Let the Holy
[48:34] Ghost come in
[48:35] we already know God wants to give us the
[48:38] Holy Ghost more than we want it
[48:40] with so much force and so much pressure
[48:43] but we're the ones standing in the way
[48:46] we've got to want it and we've got to
[48:48] want God's peace and we can do that by
[48:50] accepting God's will amen is accepting
[48:53] God's perfect will
[48:55] verse 28 ye have heard how I said unto
[48:57] you I go away and come again unto you
[49:01] if you love me you would Rejoice because
[49:05] I said I go unto my father
[49:07] from my father is greater than I and the
[49:10] reason I wanted to read this is
[49:12] I believe that there's a part of us that
[49:15] needs to Rejoice with sister Kathleen
[49:19] because she has gone on to be with Jesus
[49:22] she has gone on to be with the father
[49:25] and we should be rejoicing for her amen
[49:30] Hallelujah
[49:31] she's never gonna hurt she's never had a
[49:34] heartache no one's ever going to use her
[49:36] and stop and talk behind her back
[49:38] anymore
[49:39] and nothing can affect her the devil
[49:41] can't get to her
[49:43] we ought to rejoice
[49:45] and I'll say again rejoice
[49:48] think on her blessings it will help
[49:53] he promised to keep us in perfect peace
[49:56] if our mind has stayed on him
[50:00] Philippians chapter 4 verse 4.
[50:03] rejoice in the lord always and again I
[50:07] say rejoice
[50:10] verse 6 be careful for nothing
[50:15] but in everything by prayer and
[50:18] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[50:23] requests be made known unto God
[50:26] Hallelujah you know you're putting
[50:28] yourself in the hands of God
[50:33] amen that's what you're doing you're
[50:35] you're putting the situations in God's
[50:38] hands amen you're not just saying you're
[50:41] not coming to him with just uh here's my
[50:44] request and and no matter what give me
[50:47] what I want
[50:48] that don't work
[50:51] that don't work
[50:53] be careful for nothing trust God in
[50:56] every situation
[50:58] he'll work it out I believe it says
[51:01] they're in a book of uh Psalms
[51:05] um trust in the Lord with all thy heart
[51:07] lean not to thy own understanding
[51:11] and all the ways acknowledge Him and
[51:12] give you the desires
[51:14] I'm not quoting it exactly right but you
[51:16] know the scripture
[51:18] you know the word
[51:20] I just say if you just committed to God
[51:23] he'll direct everything amen now look at
[51:26] verse 7 and the peace of God which
[51:30] passeth
[51:31] all understanding you know what that
[51:34] dude that just kicks all the Y's out
[51:36] kicks all the questions out
[51:38] amen no I got peace that surpasses all
[51:42] those questions
[51:44] shall keep your hearts and I love this
[51:47] and your minds through Christ Jesus
[51:52] so you you can't just say well I got
[51:54] peace down here but this thing's going
[51:55] to mount Mill in the mouth no
[51:58] no claim the promise claim the word this
[52:02] is what the word says
[52:04] we've got to bring our faith under
[52:06] subjection to the word and then the word
[52:09] Works in our behalf amen finally
[52:12] Brethren whatsoever things are true and
[52:14] honest just and pure and lovely and of a
[52:20] good report
[52:22] if there be any strength
[52:25] if there be any praise
[52:27] think on these things
[52:33] these things which you have both learned
[52:35] and received and heard and seen in Paul
[52:37] do
[52:38] and the God of Peace shall be with you
[52:42] that's a promise Saints
[52:48] we have to put effort
[52:52] to keep our thoughts right
[52:55] yeah we can't just say oh yeah that's a
[52:57] scripture I like that scripture I wish
[52:59] it worked for me no it works for
[53:02] everybody who does it
[53:04] but if we don't do it
[53:06] and then we're wondering why we're
[53:10] caught up
[53:13] it don't work for the unbeliever amen it
[53:17] works for the believer
[53:19] and he promised to keep us
[53:23] and perfect peace all right Philippians
[53:25] chapter 1 verse 21 for to me
[53:28] for to me to live is Christ
[53:31] and to die is gain
[53:36] so are we sad I because sister
[53:40] Kathleen's gone
[53:45] and we reword that
[53:46] are we sad because sister Kathleen's not
[53:48] here
[53:51] I told sister Kathleen the lesson
[53:54] probably 26 hours I said I am really
[53:57] jealous that you're going before me
[54:07] because for her it was gain
[54:11] it was total gain
[54:16] but if I live in the flesh that is the
[54:19] fruit of my labor yet what I shall
[54:21] choose I want not for what I am for I am
[54:26] in a straight betwixt too having a
[54:29] desire to depart
[54:31] and to be with Christ Which is far
[54:34] better
[54:36] nevertheless to abide in the flesh is
[54:38] more needful for you so that's what I'm
[54:41] saying is as long as we're here on the
[54:43] Earth
[54:44] we're here for a purpose to help
[54:45] somebody
[54:46] it's for somebody it is not for
[54:50] ourselves
[54:55] sister
[54:57] Sharon the Fontaine one of her first
[55:01] albums
[55:02] uh they she sang a song I'm going home
[55:05] where I belong
[55:07] I want I want to go home where I belong
[55:10] amen all right James chapter 4 verse 14.
[55:15] I want to share this the scriptures with
[55:17] you because I want us to realize when we
[55:20] leave here don't think you've got the
[55:21] rest of your life
[55:23] we don't know what the rest of our life
[55:25] is amen verse 14 whereas ye know not
[55:28] what shall be on tomorrow for what is
[55:31] your life what is your life anyways what
[55:34] what is that end date do you know it is
[55:36] even a vapor which appeared for a little
[55:38] time and then vanisheth away
[55:41] for that y'all to say if the Lord will
[55:44] we shall live and do this and do that if
[55:48] the Lord will
[55:51] I have confidence God knows what he's
[55:53] doing I have confidence in the will of
[55:57] the Lord
[55:58] all right First Peter chapter 1 verse 22
[56:01] we're gonna
[56:03] end with this scripture
[56:07] let's
[56:10] yes let's just read it for four verses
[56:12] here First Peter chapter 1 verse 22
[56:15] senior purified your souls and obeying
[56:17] the truth through the spirit unto
[56:19] unfeigned love of the Brethren see that
[56:22] you love one another
[56:23] with a pure heart fervently
[56:28] wow
[56:30] I love this scripture this this is real
[56:34] being born again
[56:37] not of a corruptable seed but
[56:39] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[56:41] liveth and abideth forever
[56:44] for All Flesh
[56:46] is as grass
[56:48] and all the glory of man as the flower
[56:52] of the grass
[56:54] the grass withereth and the flower
[56:57] thereof falleth away
[57:00] but the word of the Lord endureth
[57:03] forever
[57:05] amen and this is the word which by the
[57:07] gospel is preached unto you
[57:11] God's will
[57:13] God's word
[57:16] if we've got breath in our lung don't
[57:18] just give God five or ten minutes of
[57:20] your day
[57:21] give them your life amen practice on a
[57:25] daily basis to give him your all
[57:30] amen
[57:32] now I don't
[57:35] did I tell you that was my last
[57:37] scripture
[57:39] it was not the last one I I wanted to
[57:41] give you another one
[57:43] and it
[57:46] I
[57:48] let's if we could read just two more if
[57:50] that's okay second Corinthians chapter
[57:53] five verse one I want to say this sister
[57:55] I asked sister Kathleen she wanted to
[57:57] give a message to the church
[58:00] in her last words to the church was she
[58:03] said tell the church
[58:05] I love them
[58:08] I love them
[58:09] that was a message from Mr Kathleen to
[58:13] each of you
[58:17] second Corinthians chapter 5 verse one
[58:19] for we know that if our Earthly House of
[58:22] this Tabernacle were dissolved
[58:24] we have a building of God a house not
[58:28] made with hands Eternal in the heavens
[58:32] for in this we groan earnestly Desiring
[58:35] to be clothed upon with our house which
[58:37] is from Heaven if so be that being
[58:39] clothed we shall not be found naked
[58:43] for we that are in this Tabernacle do
[58:46] groan being burdened not for that which
[58:50] not for that we would be uncle but that
[58:53] would be clothed upon that mortality
[58:55] might be swallowed up of life
[58:58] now we that have wrought us for the self
[59:01] same thing as God and who also have
[59:03] given unto us the earnest of the spirit
[59:04] therefore we are always confident
[59:07] knowing that while as we are at home in
[59:10] the body
[59:12] okay whether we're at home in the body
[59:15] we are absent from the Lord while we're
[59:17] home in the body if we are absent from
[59:19] the Lord so as long as we're here
[59:21] there's a part of us that is absent from
[59:24] the Lord are you with me for we walk by
[59:26] faith not by sight we are confident I
[59:29] say and willing rather to be absent from
[59:32] the body and to be present with the Lord
[59:36] wherefore we labor that whether we be
[59:39] present or absent we may be accepted of
[59:43] him now this is really really important
[59:47] there's a message in this whether we are
[59:52] absent from the body present with the
[59:54] Lord
[59:55] we as long as we have an opportunity we
[1:00:00] need to be laboring for the Lord because
[1:00:02] whether we're present or absent
[1:00:04] God's going to hold us accountable yes
[1:00:06] sir amen amen
[1:00:11] don't think your life is your life and
[1:00:13] you can do what you want
[1:00:15] you've been bought with a price you now
[1:00:17] need to ask God God what would you have
[1:00:20] your servant to do
[1:00:22] for we must all appear before the
[1:00:24] Judgment seat of Christ that everyone
[1:00:26] may receive the things done in his body
[1:00:28] according to what you have done whether
[1:00:29] it be good or bad
[1:00:33] amen I say
[1:00:35] while we have time because we don't know
[1:00:37] the end date of any of us let's spend
[1:00:40] the rest of our life living more for God
[1:00:43] than we ever have
[1:00:45] does that go along with that men's
[1:00:47] meeting
[1:00:48] amen that goes right along with our
[1:00:50] men's meeting I mean last one this is
[1:00:52] first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13.
[1:00:55] first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13.
[1:00:58] but I would not have you to be ignorant
[1:01:00] brother concerning them which are asleep
[1:01:03] that ye sorrow not even as others have
[1:01:05] that have which have no hope
[1:01:08] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[1:01:11] rose again
[1:01:12] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[1:01:15] will God bring with him
[1:01:18] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:01:20] the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:01:22] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[1:01:24] not prevent them which are asleep
[1:01:27] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:01:29] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[1:01:31] the Archangel with the trumpet of God
[1:01:33] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:01:37] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:01:40] be caught up together with them in the
[1:01:42] clouds
[1:01:43] to meet the Lord in the air and so shall
[1:01:47] we ever be with the Lord now I'll love
[1:01:50] this next verse wherefore Comfort one
[1:01:54] another with these words
[1:01:58] I'll tell you just stay with this
[1:02:01] and don't worry about all the other
[1:02:04] stuff
[1:02:06] we need to comfort one another
[1:02:10] you know when we come to the house of
[1:02:12] the Lord we don't always get what we
[1:02:15] would like to get here
[1:02:17] but we always get here what God wants us
[1:02:20] to get here
[1:02:22] so I'll say like this
[1:02:25] when we we come to the house the Lord is
[1:02:28] to find out where we are with him so we
[1:02:31] can get closer to him so we can get more
[1:02:34] ready that is the main purpose now it
[1:02:38] doesn't mean other needs can't be met
[1:02:40] but look you're in the business of
[1:02:42] comforting others
[1:02:44] you understand and if you spent more
[1:02:47] time comforting others
[1:02:49] God will bless your heart in your mind
[1:02:53] he will because what you sow is what you
[1:02:55] read that's right if you're coming to
[1:02:57] the house of God to get all your comfort
[1:02:59] and you're not getting and I say unto
[1:03:01] you spend more time trying to comfort
[1:03:03] other people and you'll see it'll come
[1:03:05] back around to you we just got to use
[1:03:07] the house of God for what it's meant to
[1:03:09] be
[1:03:12] I believe the word of God is is for
[1:03:14] Comfort but you understand I'm saying we
[1:03:16] don't want to make it something
[1:03:17] different we got scripture right there
[1:03:19] in the Bible what we need to be doing
[1:03:22] we are commissioned by God to comfort
[1:03:24] one another
[1:03:26] amen
[1:03:28] praise the Lord let's Stand Together
[1:03:31] in
[1:03:33] God does everything beautiful in his
[1:03:35] time
[1:03:46] if you just take some time in the light
[1:03:48] of this message to think about
[1:03:53] what was displayed the last two years by
[1:03:56] Sister Kathleen
[1:03:58] faithfulness
[1:04:00] to pain and suffering and trials
[1:04:05] she displayed Christ to us
[1:04:10] in a way that we didn't have an
[1:04:12] opportunity to
[1:04:14] you understand what I'm saying so this
[1:04:17] thing was not in vain
[1:04:19] God knows what he's doing
[1:04:22] and when we think of her we think of
[1:04:24] that faithfulness we think I want to be
[1:04:26] faithful to the end if he puts me
[1:04:28] through something I want to say praise
[1:04:30] God right to the end
[1:04:34] let's just trust God Amen amen let's
[1:04:38] let's bow our hearts in a word of prayer
[1:04:41] our gracious Heavenly Father
[1:04:43] Lord we want to thank you
[1:04:45] from the depths of our heart for your
[1:04:48] daughter and your servant
[1:04:51] who's been with us so many years Lord we
[1:04:57] can't think of a time not one time
[1:05:01] that she wasn't faithful
[1:05:03] and Lord we think about
[1:05:07] The Parables that you gave in your word
[1:05:10] and
[1:05:12] when you came time to that
[1:05:14] accountability of of of the things that
[1:05:17] were done with their lives
[1:05:20] like we read in your word
[1:05:23] those that carried out
[1:05:25] your will

[1:06:18] in our lives Lord May
[1:06:21] if we get discouraged may we just
[1:06:25] look to something
[1:06:28] that she helped us with in our own
[1:06:30] personal lives
[1:06:32] to help us along through our trials Lord

[1:07:04] a confidence that Lord

[1:07:45] night Lord when the enemy would come and
