believe all things are possible only believe only believe only believe all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I I believe and Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe amen praise the Lord if you could grab your Bibles I'd like to read from Genesis chapter 28 and start with verse 10 is it wonderful to be in the house of the Lord in the middle of the week man there's uh you know just we know that these opportunities we shouldn't take for granted we just have to think a few years ago when doors were closed and circumstances were such where we couldn't gather so when we have times like this I think we should just uh really really enjoy it really appreciate it and just grateful to be able to come to a midweek service I think they're getting rare and rare used to be that uh remember when I grew up playing Sports they didn't have practice or games on Wednesday night because they just expected you to go to church nowadays it sounds like practice games every day of the week including Wednesdays and Sundays and so a midweek service is getting rare and rarer so I'm just really really glad that we could be here in the middle of the week to fellowship with one another and fellowship around the things of the Lord Genesis chapter 28 verse 10 it says and Jacob went out from beeba and went toward Heron he lifted up a certain place and carried there all night because the sun was set and he took up the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and laay down in that place to sleep and he dreamed Behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land were on thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the Earth Thou shalt spread AB abroad to the west and to the East and to the north and to the South and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whether thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of and Jacob awake out of his sleep and he said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not and he was afraid and said how Dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the Gate of Heaven amen we'll just stop there you can be seated I want to give my my title as the Gates of Heaven and I I wrote down just a little note here so I'll mention it now because I meant forgot to mention it on on Sunday I just really am impressed with the library you all have I don't know if if anybody goes back there and sees but I went back there you've got church age books you got Seven Seals books got all sorts of books and I I thought man what a I appreciate brother John you making the effort to see that you you have these I know they're available digitally but um if any of these young people haven't read a church age book or if there's books that you you're looking for want they're available and so I just wanted to encourage you all got a great Library use it support it um those books aren't cheap we appreciate those who are still printing them and all the work we do to get them message out it would be a shame if we spend thousands and tens of thousands maybe millions of dollars getting the message out overseas and what we just lose our appreciation of we here and we're not feeding it the same here so brother John I really appreciate your burden and missions the care that you give over over this church it may not be readily noticed um I'm just going to say this personally I was an associate pastor for many years and uh and it's you know it's one office maybe close to almost 15 years being an associate pastor but as soon as I became a pastor I felt like I owed an apology to every Pastor I ever knew because you just don't know what goes into it you don't know what it feels like and you don't know what's demanded of it so but John you're a uh you're an example Pastor example father an example husband you do a tremendous job and I hope that you all notice just what great care your Shepherd gives over you here and just all the things he provides and things he looks out after you're tremendously blessed I I wish gives me something to Aspire to with our own church back home so wanted to say that uh Sunday and I forgot so we love you brother John very very much just so glad to be here and we love sister Cheryl too very very much I have a song maybe we'll sing later but we'll I'm just making her nervous but uh if you want to look again just to our text I want to bring the I want to take this called the Gates of Heaven and we're drawing it from there in verse 17 and let's just let's just look back at this I want to keep reading a little bit more in verse 16 and Jacob awake out of his sleep and he said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not he kind of suggesting that he arrived at this place uh and since the sun was going down he needed to to rest and it's kind almost like my circumstance I I needed to stop and I needed to no longer continue in my journey and I made myself a bed and I fell asleep and he's like this was God was here this whole time and I didn't realize it that's kind of how he phrases it Sur the Lord is in this place and I knew it not except that he appears to him in a dream God says I'm with you and he sees this this uh latter come down out of Heaven he sees Angels uh ascending the angels of God ascending and descending so this was quite a experience for him in this dream and this is how he characterizes where he was and he was afraid and said how Dreadful is this place and not maybe as a terror in that you're you fear for your life but just in the awe and the reverence that one would have to have for this place he said this is none other but the house of God and this is the Gate of Heaven that's that's quite a statement I think when he makes that statement here he is on Earth this is a place where he just slept during the night it's just a place there as he's journeying uh from be from berseba toward haran and as he's in this journey in this maybe we could say just a random place it wasn't like he was Googling a lodging and found a halfway point and decided to stay there he happens here and he says this is the house of God in the Gate of Heaven I want to come back to that here in a moment but let's just keep reading to verse 22 and Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and he set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it so here's this image as he builds up this pillar and he pours oil on it he's he's stacking these things it's a commemoration it's a memorial of what God has done and he pours the oil upon it and it's called a pillar he sets something up it's going to rise up from the Earth to signify this place he says and he called the name of that place bethl the name of the city was called L at the first Jacob vowed a vow saying if God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and give me bread to eat and reignment to put on so that I come again to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my God now he's not necessarily inventing a standard or qualifying it well if God will do this then he's my God he's really just repeating what God said he would do and so God said he would do something and he's saying the go the one that says he'll do it and does it to him is God the one that keeps his word and he says and this Stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house and all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee so there's quite quite a bit that's just in this particular passage where Jacob's dream and then his vow to God and he said this Stone now this pillar that he erected he says this shall be God's house quite a statement this shall be God's house he said earlier this is the house of God now he says this shall be God's house it's a place he's clearly wanting to identify with Elohim a place he's identifying with Jehovah and call it God's house this isn't the place that God hangs out this isn't the place where he comes by every once in a while but he say this is where God dwells and to use that phrase God's house this is even before the Tabernacle in the wilderness this is before the temple this is before God said build me a place and the place where I put my name there behind the veil in the holiest of holies will I dwell and where the shikina glory will be uh this is before those things but yet it has the same idea when Jacob's like this is none other than the habitation of God I I went to sleep here not knowing that God was here and in the night he visits me and he's with me and I see these Supernatural things and so he said this is a place where God is Not only welcome but it's where he lives it's where he resides that's what's striking him in this moment and then he says this is the Gate of Heaven I'm wanted just to amplify that tonight I think it's such a wonderful phrase but as Jacob experienced uh this dream and the supernatural he says this is the Gate of Heaven I want you to think of it as a meeting place on Earth where Heaven came down it was a meeting place where the natural meets Supernatural here Jacob's going to sleep he's going to make uh some rocks his pillows uh he's obviously getting natural rest because he's in a natural body but now in the midst of all that he has a supernatural experience and so he say this is a a natural place a normal place this is I picked it as a good spot to lay my head but this is a place where God could come down this is the place where I could have a vision of Heaven this is a place where angels are ascending and descending so he say this is a place where Heaven and Earth are meeting and the natural can experience the Supernatural and come into contact the Earthly can come in contact with the Heavenly how many calls it a gate the gate refers to an entrance and it's more than that and I'm going to use some scriptures tonight to kind of lay some things out there and as I look out tonight think everyone who's here tonight's heard me preach before so we just kind of all relax and you kind of know how I work it takes me a while to get going and I'm still learning how to preach and so you guys are just real patient with me like we've been hearing him for over 20 years now just hold on he'll get there eventually so you'll just stay with me but the gate it refers to an entrance and we would recognize that where a gate denotes where you would come into a place but it means more than that it's also a meeting place this is the ideas behind the name a meeting place and and it's also a place of authority a place of judging let's just look at a few scriptures as we consider what Gates represent or these G this Gate of Heaven in Psalms 24:7 it says lift up your heads oh ye gates and be Li be ye lift up ye Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in so there's where it speaks of an entrance where the gates are going to be lifted up and the doors are going to lift up and it's a it's a welcoming an opening and the gates would be since it's an entrance point in a lot of ways you could say it was the kind of the first impression of the city so it would it would kind of declare the glory of the city we can maybe say that if you just kind of walked we're kind of traveling and you saw this kind of raggedy wall and a broken down gate you'd say well what kind of city is this and uh maybe it wouldn't seem like there's much behind it because it's not much fortification not much watching but the so the gates will represent the Grande the power and the beauty and the glory of a city it's one of the things that God used describes the New Jerusalem it speaks of the gates being made of a single Pearl and so the Grandeur and the glory and the honor of a city is represented in the gates then in Proverbs chapter 31 verse 23 it speaking of this virtuous woman and her husband says her husband is known in the gates where he sth among the Elders of the land so it's kind of speaking of how this husband is in this rightful place of honor and to sit in the gates is a place of respect and it is uh he's there in a where he sits with the elders so it's a place of power and a place of judgment place where business was conducted you'd go to the gates to adjudicate something you'd go to the gates to deliberate and to make decisions and we find in the book of of of Ruth where they go to the gates to determine the near Kinsman whether or not he would want to uh take the land and so there's a lot of it's a place where judgments dispensed and decisions are made and things are declared the Bible even speaks about a man whose quiver is full and blesses a man who has these sons who will stand with him in the gates Amen in Proverbs chap 22:22 it says Rob not the poor because he is poor neither oppress The Afflicted in the gate why why does it speak of in the gate it doesn't mean that you can do it everywhere else except in the gate so the poor is just always trying to run to get to the gate so he won't Rob them but it means that where you're judging where you're making determinations and you're assessing the needs of the poor you're judging the poor it's it's a place where judgment Goes Forth correction is given in the gate if if you are we are to take a lot of different things we know in the Old Testament says you shall possess the gates of your enemy mentioned over and over again if you possess the gates you possess the city you control control the coming in the going out you control the city you control the economics you control the the comers so you possess the gates you possess the city this is what is represented in the gates are you thinking about this think about this with me a gate is a place of entrance it represents the glory of a city it's a place of power and Justice and judgment says in Zechariah 8:16 these are the things that ye shall do speak ye every man the truth to his neighbor execute the Judgment of Truth and peace in your Gates so Gates is a place where things are announced things are declared things are deliberated business is conducted judgment Goes Forth opinions are giv decisions are made so it says execute the Judgment of Truth and peace in your Gates so a gate properly is a place where truth should be found it's a place where righteousness should go forth a place where peace is found not a place of warfare uh it's a place where the gates should be possessed so that there can be a place of judgment and righteousness and peace if there was always constant turmoil and and fighting in the gates that would be a city under siege a city under ATT attack but it says a catch execute the Judgment of Truth and peace in your Gates that's the gates are a place where truth Goes Forth Amen in Matthew chapter 16: 18 you're all familiar just with a larger context to this it's Peter who do you say that I am Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and it says Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven hath revealed this unto you and in verse 18 and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter which means rock or stone and Upon This Rock I will build my church and that rock we know is the revelation of Jesus Christ and even in it Peter is a stone says they call you Peter so Peter is a stone in that church he's part of it he's he's a living Stone and the and the church is the the house of God there's a lot that's been in this Upon This Rock of Revelation I will build my church Stone upon Stone I'm going to build it up says and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen as I've titled this the Gates of Heaven we find if there's Gates of Hell there got there has to be Gates of Heaven and when it speaks of the Gates of Hell to a to a Jew I've just been reading in different places how the Jews had some sades that there's three gates of hell uh one in the I think the land one in the sea and one in Jerusalem so it would show that this this place of power this place of attack to the gates of hell it's the strength of hell because it's the court of hell it's the uh it's the place where his SK the schemes of Satan are where his instruments his plots his strategy go forth if Satan has a kingdom it's through those Gates that he makes his attack it's through those Gates that he he's going to enter into our realm and enter into our lives and try to fight us so the gates of hell it's a place of power place of tactics a place of strategy and so the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against this Revelation shall not Prevail against Peter shall not Prevail against the church the gates of hell then are the powers of hell so when we look at the Gate of Heaven speaks of the power of Heaven Jacob if I could put it this way he found in his own words the house of God this is the Gate of Heaven he said I found heaven on Earth I I didn't have to leave Earth I found it on Earth and I'll maybe just share this with you since we just feel at home and so comfortable last year we we preached a number of services at our church on the kingdom and kind of the way it was inspired is reading about the life of Paul and realizing that Paul uh as a Jew and bringing this from the Old Testament he wasn't trying to create this idea that one day we're all just going to go to heaven but the disciples and the Jews looked for heaven to be established on Earth that the kingdom was to be on earth and it's kind of like a Catholic con construct to where we divide Heaven and Hell and you're just kind of making your decision on Earth where you want to spend eternity you're either going to spend it in hell you're going to spend it in heaven and it it kind of loses sight of the fact that one day we're coming back to this earth to spend eternity and that really what God was always aiming for is his kingdom to be be established on Earth it wasn't just oh I just want to go to heaven I just want to go to heaven I just want to go to heaven but Heaven Come Down Heaven let the kingdom be established in Earth so to the Jews and the apostles and Paul they were looking for the kingdom to be established on Earth not just get out of here and get to heaven because really if if you look at it that way if the goal was just to get to heaven that could get kind of scary wouldn't it because we we would be only concerned about ending this life want you catch this and chew on it the goal would be to end this life not live it and that's that's the danger of all which just when we get to heaven I just want to go to heaven I just want to go to heaven that that misses the reality that God's desire is to be expressed here on Earth the kingdom to be established in Earth and so when we look at this Jacob is saying I found heaven on Earth to youe that's what they're looking for they're looking for the Kingdom on Earth the the the when Abraham was looking for a city whose uh Builder and maker was God he wasn't talking about building a rocket ship wasn't trying to find some way to travel uh through Dimensions he he looked for it on Earth and so Jacob had found heaven on Earth he calls it beel or bethl which is the house of God it comes from the the two Hebrew words Beth which is house and L which is God called a house of God is he's speaking of a consecrated place to him it was a sacred meeting place and I want you to think of it where he says maybe I could say it this way we think of the house of God and we think of church H and what we what do we do we kind of come and go and and we meet here and then we don't meet here and if there's not service maybe we just think it's just a building that's not what Jacob was thinking he's thinking a consecrated place a sacred meeting place where you can expect to see God or meet God so when he takes a stone and he wrecks these stones and he sets this pillar up and he anoints it with oil it was the act of dedicating this place he was wanting to set it up as a sign that that there would be a memorial that this is the house of God I'm going to take a pillar and I'm going to anoint it with oil and anointing it with oil I'm consecrating this place as a Dwelling Place of God and in this and and I hope I could just bring this out uh with so much that I have maybe here before me and with the with the pull on the word here and just the ease with which we can Minister sometimes we just get maybe too too long and we get caught up in some of the details so you'll have to amen and pull me through this in this image of him saying this is bethl I'm going to erect a pillar I'm going to build up this Stone I'm going to anoint it with oil and this is the dwelling place of God this is quite an image and in this image we can see the picture of the house of the Lord in all its different applications Amen in more than just one not just in a temporary meeting place as we might think Jacob found it but when he says house and even this Hebrew word Beth house it it can refer to the human body very word bth it be it speaks of the human body but then it also is the same word that's used of a dwelling place we might say a home or a house that which contains a family and it can also be used and it's used of the temple that very word Beth in the Hebrew is used of a human body it's used of a human's home and it's also used of the Temple and so what I want to kind of express to you tonight just the moments that we have together and I believe these moments are worth every every bit is to consider your body your house and this church as the Gates of Heaven and if this isn't your church I would say then your body your your house where you dwell and your church where you attend to think of them as the Gates of Heaven I I've bitten off a lot I'm not going to try to chew it all but we'll just taste it but in 1 Corinthians chapter 6:9 this is just a very quick glance at look considering your body as the house of the Lord and as the Gates of Heaven says know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own he's revisiting something that he'd already said that this your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost know you not that your body is a temple and he's revisiting here again to say this you are your body your your physical being uh Body Spirit Soul he said it is the house of God it is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which you have of God the Holy Ghost you have from God and you are not your own so he signifying the individual who's been born again which is the New Birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost and this the soul of a a Believer it makes them a temple a Dwelling Place a habitation of God's own life brother Brandon when he preaches the statue of a perfect man he makes uh similar statements to this throughout it but he called the title building the the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place the perfect man amen the living Tabernacle of the Living God where he dwells and and it's a it's a teaching on us that when we have been born again and we've been filled with the Holy Ghost that we become his dwelling place and it's how this dwelling place is built up the living Tabernacle of the Living God so our bodies are a Dwelling Place of God in 1 Peter chapter 2:5 he says ye also as light L stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ what a what a beautiful picture because in the Old Testament we had the holy of holies and in that Holy place the most holy Place one person was allowed to enter into the high priest and he was enter into that Holy place and there he would make a sacrifice and he would make this offering once a year and it was a type of Christ who Christ became what he's the high priest he's the sacrifice he becomes The Mercy Seat there's so much that's in this image the temple spoke of Christ the sacrifices all these different elements that are speaking of things and then we have been made these priest he says you are Lively Stones built up a spiritual house but not just a spiritual house also a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God as the temple of God so he's bringing these images together to where we're not just priests that enter into a temple but we are a temple and we are priests to offer up these spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God and he says you are Lively Stones when Jacob built that pillar of stones and anointed it with oil who was who was the image of it was an image of you amen not just an image of the church which God would build upon Revelation but it's the image of the individual a pillar that is a now a stone a Lively Stone with the oil anointing oil symbolizing the Holy Spirit you are built up a spiritual house amen as as Jacob said this is the house of God this is the Gate of Heaven this is what we become when we're filled with the Holy Ghost we are built up the house of God we are built up a temple of the Holy Ghost we are built up as a Lively Stone a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices brother B said and you are God's house living walking around manifesting the Living God Amen this is this is the truth amen you are God's house walking around manifesting Living God for God dwells not in temples made with hands but a body hast thou prepared me you are God's letter a written epistle God is in you manifesting himself through that's what we become we become the very House of God and as Jacob woke that night and said this is none other but the house of God he knew then if it was the house of God it became access to God it became the Gate of Heaven Heaven is where God dwells he Heaven is associated with God so he to connect us now as the house of God this body then being in the house of God in the temple of God becomes a Gate of Heaven brother brandom in the sermon why Christ speak he said but there's only one real church and you don't join it you're born in it yes and if you're born in it the Living God works himself through you and making himself known that's where God dwells in his church God goes to church every day that's right just lives in church he lives in you you are his church you are his church you are the Tabernacle that God dwells in what a what a statement I hope this is really hope you're really catching these these very weighty words by the prophet when you're born into the Church of God when you're baptized by one spirit in the body of Christ he says that's where God dwells he says he dwells in his church I love it he goes to church every day and hopefully this kind of helps Shake us a little bit to think that God that we are his church and he goes to church every day because he lives in you you are his church I had a friend many years ago that he kind of joked around if you asked him where he went to church he'd kind of say I am the church and not that we would necessarily need to borrow that people say where you go to church go I am the church but there is a reality just as brother R tells us story of the we Revival it it's not there's not an address but it's a character it's not a location but it's a person we know that the resurrection is Christ the person of Christ and therefore his church can be embodied in an individual in a person you are his church you're the Tabernacle that God dwells in you're he says you're the Church of the Living God yourself and if the Living God lives in his living being then your action is of God I kind of just tightens it down a little bit if it isn't then God isn't there I know that kind of tightens it up pretty good it's good to challenge ourselves but it tells us that if our life isn't manifesting it then something's wrong because that's what it needs to do he wouldn't make you act like that when he says in the word here his blueprint don't do it and you go do it see that's wrong when you deny it then that shows the life isn't even in you quite a heavy statement I believe but it's not to take away from your experience but to challenge you to let the experience live yes let it live out you are the house of God could you imagine if we called this a church but you came in and it was just pinball machines and pool tables and televisions up and and we're serving hot wings and different things like that and just because we want to call it church it's a church but everything goes and there's nothing sacred there's nothing consecrated there's no nothing being expressed and actually done and there's not the elements of Christ made available and that's where things are going now to where now there's a lot of so-called churches that are secular a and they're not preaching the Bible they're not teaching Christ but they recognize the power of community they recognize the beauty of fellowship and certain kind of continuity so there's secular churches that don't teach from the Bible it's just a Gathering Place and and it's becoming even more and more popular and so for ourselves likewise we must challenge ourselves uh with this what he says that the Living God has to live through us but more than that I really want to emphasize to recognize that if we have his life inside of us we are his body and therefore we are a church his church we are the temple the Tabernacle of the Holy Ghost in John chapter 14 he says if I go I prepare a place for you in my father's house are many mansions and it kind of creates this separation again in our minds that one day we're going to go we know a body he's prepared there's a body waiting this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have a body waiting for us in in the my father's kingdom are many bodies many palaces we're going to leave here and go to a body but he doesn't want us just to be seeing singly focused on leaving Earth so then he comes back in verse 23 he says if any man he says my father and I will come he says and we'll make our Abode with him if any man believes he says what my father will come and we'll make our Abode with him that word abode is we'll make our mansion with him in my father's house there many mansions if it were not so I would not told you I go to prepare a place for you so we know we have a body waiting for us there's a body that we're going to go to but in the meantime he says if you'll believe I will come and the father will make our Mansion we we're going to a mansion but first and foremost he wants to make a mansion in us he wants to make a Dwelling Place in us so we're not just aiming to make Heaven our home catch this this is a whole separate sermon I got plenty of time my flight doesn't leave till Friday but there's uh we can just we could do Uber Eats we can just have them deliver snacks in the hallway there we can just keep going and keep going but we're not just aiming to make Heaven our home but to become a home for heaven we're guaranteed a resurrection we're guaranteed this Rapture if we have the Holy Ghost Inside of us one day we're going to make in that sense Heaven our home we're going to go into the eternities but one day that eternity is going to be United with Earth and we're going to see a New Jerusalem a heaven and earth restored and redeemed but in the meantime we're not just trying to make Heaven our home but we want to be made a home for heaven and that's what our bodies are to be a Gate of Heaven and then our body is a temple of the Lord but our body is being a temple of the Lord and if if our body being then the dwelling place of God just think of the extension of how that also our home where we sleep where we dwell where we keep our valuables and our possessions and our church also should be Gates of Heaven and there is a duty just as we would have to as Paul is saying in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 that know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and we must keep it consecrated and sacred and look out after it there's a duty to consecrate your homes call them houses and we know brother said there's a difference between a house and a home and so we have a duty to turn that place where we sleep that residence that we have listed on our ad on our driver's license the the our our primary dwelling place we have a duty to make that house whether it be an apartment a basement Suite or if it's a condor or if it's a if it's a two-story house or a singl story house or we're just written a room out of a house we have a duty to make that house a home amen it's a duty to con and set aside your house is a duty and cons a duty to set aside and consecrate this church 1 Timothy 3: 5 says for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the Church of God that's quite a quite a statement uh and I think we can say that about anything in the scripture it's quite a statement that God will memorialize these thoughts in a Bible and preserve it and keep it for us but when he says if you know how to rule his own house and I know there's a much larger setting that he's using here but he's drawing a parallel of how a man rules his house and how that he would take care of the Church of God so what he's done is he said there's a parallel between the home life and the church and if a man doesn't know how to rule his own house he's saying then how if he doesn't have his house in order how is he going to keep the house of God in order or the Church of God in order and that that there's this uh and I believe that's where it should start is in our homes and you say well and my it's chaotic and it's broken and things are out of place that's great that you have a church that you can come to where you could hear the word but you've got to put into practice the things you hear and take it home and say this is where it starts because if the families never get fixed the church eventually breaks because it's where the strength of a church is is in the families and the individuals we got to we don't want this just to be a sanctuary that we escape to and like oh man I'm so glad I'm not at home tonight just happy to be in the house of the Lord you should go from this Sanctuary to another Sanctuary home should be a sanctuary so Paul says if you can if he can rule his own house then he's in the kind he's in that place to take care of the Church of God because church is just a type of our home life amen in the beginning God created a family not a church right when God first created an Eden he didn't build a church and then place man in a church he didn't create Church order and church systems and have a song service and and and build it all just right and then put man in a church he created a a paradise his garden his pleasure ground and put man there and he brought forth the family so God's ultimate was a family in this household this Gathering of a family with this vision of a man and a woman bringing for children and that was the ultimate and church serves that purpose not the other way around am and so there we could say that church is a type Church order is a type of family order I don't think I'm getting out in the weeds here but if I could just say this this that uh because we we got to be careful that we don't get so Church Centric and brother John has done a tremendous job of not making it about him so I don't think you have a problem with it being Pastor Centric but it's just kind of maybe in the uh the the lore and the DNA sometimes of message Believers to it's all about the pastor and it's all about the gift and it's all about the church when really uh it the if there is no Believers there's no church right there's no sheep there's no pastor and and I believe the people are we mutually dependent upon one another but the ultimate isn't just to serve the church the ultimate is that the church serves the family builds up the individuals that make up that family a a and if we C if you can get that part right uh then you really can grow in the family life through the work and the labor that the church provides those resources and I might just have to preach the rest of the week just to make sense of that because there's so much there but I think there's a greater it's greater to View Church as being the church order as a type of family order instead of the other way around right when brother bandam says your pastor's your husband spiritually speaking you know what he meant by that right he doesn't mean brother John's your spiritual husband that'd be a little weird wouldn't it brother Bruce to think that brother John's my spiritual husband but he meant in the home your husband is your pastor spiritually speaking right brother Beckman that's what it is a pastor in the home is spiritually he's spiritually a pastor in the home because brother John is literally the pastor in the church not spiritually he's literally the pastor that's an office that God places in the body and he's the pastor but at home you have the pastor and the associate pastor you have the pastor spiritually the husband and the Fifth Gospel the mom the wife in the home and together they rule rule their home as God wants the house of God to be ruled that's why the parallel is here a man who doesn't know how to rule his own house how can he take care of the Church of God because those roles in that church are just a type of what the husband is in his home amen because you realize there's not one office in the local church that assumes all the responsibilities that a husband does in the family and so when brother Bram said your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking you can correct this all you want brother John but I believe brother brandom meant that your the husband in the home is a spiritual Pastor not that our pastors of our church become our spiritual husbands because that's been used to abuse a lot of people and so we must then in this paril of ruling your house and being able to care for the Church of God we must rule our bodies and our homes if we want our church to be right amen our heart is a home for heaven and if our heart's a home for heaven then our house must be a home for us the house itself must be a sanctuary the house itself must be a place where the holy spirit is welcome the the home itself must be a place uh that God is pleased to come to and pleased to dwell in I I look out on the congregation tonight and I see message believers who are taught well knowing that you're at this church you get you're taught very very well and you may recall the sermon that brother Bram a story brother Bram tells I I think in a couple places about the uh the rich couple where he knew a boy who wanted to get married and is a uh he married eeve night's daughter there in the Jeffersonville area New Albany area very uh uh rich man he tells a story about how that they got married uh and when they got married they had a beautiful big huge beautiful mansion and he talked about how the door knobs or I don't know if he called them diamonds or something like that but he just talked about how it's just very very ornate in this Mansion actually went up and looked up the neighborhood that they lived in and uh the homes there beautiful uh extraordinary neighborhoods and he said he went up to visit them after they got married and he said they were just fussing and a fighting as he walked up and he and then as he knocked on the door of immediately they kind of held hands and oh brother brandham come in isn't everything wonderful a and he and he realized and this is just a big show they're just kind of putting it on cuz they were fighting and fussing and dancing with another woman the night before he's like man no matter how much money they have no matter how beautiful the house was in all its amenities it was a place of quarreling and fighting and hypocrisy because when they stood in the gate they held hands and pretended that everything was fine right and brother Bram tells that tells that part to introduce a different couple that wanted to get married he said they didn't have enough money to get married and his brother had asked him if they could marry him and here's the difference between a mer Millionaire's daughters whose door knobs are 14 karat in their home who marries this boy named Herman Holtz and they have this big beautiful home in this really nice mansion that overlooks the the valley and he talked about this boy who didn't have enough money to pay for a wedding and this girl that didn't even have hardly had shoes and hitchhike from Indianapolis or something like that and he said that they when they got married he was ask said where where are you going to live he said in a box car and but they loved one another and he talks about how that one day so after he had visited this one family in this really nice neighborhood he said well I think I'll just go find out about this this couple that lived in the Box car and he said he taken this box car and he described how they taken newspapers and put tacky buttons up anybody know what a tacky button is what part of Kentucky you from anyhow brother brandom said when he everybody said they knew what it was and he said what part of Kentucky you from but he said he brought old boxes and made tables out of them and he's describing this scene and if I could just uh maybe fast forward in a little bit he walks up on this couple now and they don't know he's there but he saying oh honey there's a there's a a dress I want you to buy and they put their arms around one another and he said the way they were talking uh um there's a little dress that hangs in this window and I can I can buy it and she's like oh no honey you don't need to buy it they're talking said I stood there be admiring this relationship between these two in this old box car you talking about what what was the house technically we could argue that the house on the hill was a house and this is literally a box car but one lived in the house one lived in a home took a box car and made it a home he said I stood there and turned around this way looked up on top of the hill and I could see the home of the other the Steeples on top of the house and I thought which is the rich man amen and he makes this statement so powerful they had taken the old box car put newspaper up and tacky buttons he said and he and he paper newspapers he brought down some old boxes and they made a table out of it he says but brother if I'd ever found a heaven on Earth it was brother if I ever found heaven on Earth it was here's this million dooll home on a hill busting and fighting hypocrisy in the gate and here's an old box car we didn't have a proper door I assume I have to slide that thing back and forth and here they live in this old box car not sure exactly what it would have looked like or how it would have been but he said brother if I ever found a heaven on Earth it was found in a box car what does that tell us not only can our hearts be a home for heaven but a home a house a box car can be made a heaven on on Earth our house then can be a home for heaven a place where God is welcome this is why we're taught about applying the token this is why we're conscious of the atmosphere that we create brother talks about fuss and stewing and fighting people get aggravated Mom and Dad fighting and aggravate it aggravates the whole atmosphere attitudes and all those things create an atmosphere so it's something we ought to be conscious of the culture we're building within our own home the atmospheres that perpetuate in our homes there's a reason why we're taught to apply the token there's a reason why that we're to be very careful about the things that we let in the things we read the things we watch the things we talk about because that home should be a sanctuary should be a Gate of Heaven where we as the pillars in the church we as the rocks and the stones that make the church live and not only where we live and we find it a sanctuary but it's where others can meet him a place where Heaven is present where our homes being set aside this is where our children begin to learn about God our our children first learn to obey God as they learn to obey us where they learn about love and they learn about respect and learning Authority as they serve us so our children not filled with the Holy Ghost they're learning about God and the things of God and the house of God and respect and nature and atmosphere right there in our homes not just church don't put all the responsibility on the Sunday school teacher don't put all the responsibility on the pastor the church exists to give you the resources and the tools to be doing those things in your home our homes our houses our dwelling places our Apartments even if it's a box car even if you're living out of your car make it a place where Heaven is welcome a Gate of Heaven that third thing we were mentioning not just our bodies not just our house but also the church 1 Timothy chap 3:15 just a little bit later in that same chapter but if I T long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of Truth you you are a pillar and the church is the pillar and ground of Truth when Jacob erected that pillar and said this is the house of God what an image when he Anointed with oil what an image we are representing that but then also the Church of the Living God which is the pillar in ground of truth that's something to think about for a while that's something to really get into and think about what does it mean that the Church of the Living God is the pillar and the ground of truth but he does something very unique here again he brings together the church just as he brought together the home life and the local church here he brings together the the Church the true church and the local church that we might know how to behave ourselves in the house of God in the local Gathering and the local Gathering is to serves the purpose of that spiritual Gathering the body of Christ if you recall brother BR preached the sermon the five definite identifications of the True Church of the Living God and no offense but this church isn't the True Church of the Living God but send the light serve the True Church of the Living God no one church is the singular or is the church True Church of the Living God why because you could be a member of this church and God could lead you to go be a member of another church amen right pastors change in True Churches they they they retire the sometimes their lives will end in their service to the Lord they'll step down or maybe sometimes they just go by way of the grave and they the pastor of a church will change but you know what there's only one Shepherd of the true church and it never changes there's no splits in the true church that's right there's no quarrels and disagreements in the true church so the local church and its government is set up to serve the true church because if there wasn't a true church we wouldn't need a local church and so when Paul says that you might know how to behave yourself in the house of God he's tells that there are local Gatherings that serve the Church of the Living God that serve the pillar and the ground of Truth and so it makes this local church this beautiful building and just how it continues uh uh to be taken care of and to grow and provide provides so many different resources and has prayer meetings and church services and youth functions this is should be a sacred place yes this should be considered a special place just look at how quickly brother John that how you labored all those years uh uh renting for almost almost 20 years renting and keeping that place together and then when finally finding a building as soon as you find it co comes and shuts down any plans of getting a permit to occupy right slows everything now then you get it all together it's a big beautiful uh uh beautiful Sanctuary with the carpet the chairs and all the details I wonder who picked the colors do we know who picked the colors I'm just kidding and and all the labor that goes into it and the woodwork you could tell brother John's a perfectionist and the detail you know I I think the these this Altar and these Pony walls are a microcosm of the the detail and the attention he gives to the sermons he studies for and the care that he gives for his people he wants to be sure it's right that's what a a pastor does he looks out after these things he watches over these things it's the just the burden and the gift that God will give a man to labor in these things and as soon as it's all done and beautiful a gas company forgets to come by and fill up the gas and it floods tens of thousands dollars worth of damage oh surely it was going to be something that would further uh hinder the Gathering but God comes on the scene look at everything you can't even tell there was ever a flood in here unless you start looking maybe at the tiles and did you ever replace those different colors see he's a perfectionist amazing but it just why why would the devil attack these things or why do those things happen to keep you from having a place like this that you could call your own because it's an important Place brother B the sermon why I'm I've run out of time I'm running out and I can take my time I'll take my time with what little bit I'm running out of but notice what brother Bram says here these are I think these are very important statements he's talking about people and their struggles and there ups and downs and and things is because there's no joy in the house of the Lord like think about your private life your personal life and the struggles you have and he says is it because there's no joy in the house of the Lord you don't have a place you can turn there's there's not a a resource he said what makes a person want to drink and run around and act like that is it because we don't have any God now do we drink do we smoke do we cuss we do all these things or do we turn to the things of the world for our Recreation for our release for our comfort because there is no God well we know there's a God we know that there's truth is it because there's no joy in the house of the Lord anymore so the the house of God should be a place of Joy brother B talks about how your children re reach a certain age where he said actually doesn't say when they reach certain age about it he says you should make home for your children a place where they're happy to be place where they're happy to bring their children make it about them and think of ways to where they feel comfortable and they feel safe place they want to invite their friends to and then it get to a certain point where they grow up and you need to be there as a friend to your children and be there someone that they can trust and have confidence in and home should be a place of Joy a place of safety and church should be a place yes of joy is it because the Holy Ghost isn't ready to bless all of us surely it is but what have we made Church he's is a challenge is there anything wrong with it but because we do it that's the reason we're cursed catch this that's the reason God puts these things upon the church this cold and dampness we're going to other places for pleasure instead of coming to the house of the Lord for pleasure this should be a place a consecrated place just like you always return home at the end of the day after work and after travel and after your journey you know eventually you're going to come back home no matter where things take you whether it be a road trip or vacation or work or you go to go to school you come back home church should be that place where you come back to he says we just go to all these other places instead of coming to the house of the Lord for pleasure but run off to ball games and movies and shows or you name it he says we go to all these other places for pleasure instead of coming to the house of the Lord for pleasure he said the house of the Lord is the joy of the Lord this is the place that God joys in he says we ought to to know how to behave ourselves in the house of God it's speaking of the local Gathering of Believers and it's a place that God finds joy he said the joy of the Lord is the joy of his people he wants you to come to church and worship him and be happy and satisfied giveing praise and honor and glory and wisdom and might and power to God he wants you to do that so he wants you to come to church and church be a place where you worship him where you're happy satisfied give him praise and honor and glory and wisdom and might and power to God that's what church should be you know it's a shame that people drag themselves to churches that they don't like being in they complain about they always run down and they always find things to criticize and when church should be a place where you want to come you want to worship and you're happy and satisfied where you can give praise and honor and Glory where wisdom might and the power of God is welcome if the if the power of God's not welcome that's no place you want to go to if the wisdom of God isn't going forth that's no place you should want to be but you God wants you to go to church where you can worship him where you can be happy and satisfied where you can give praise and the honor and glory and wisdom and might and power of God is welcome and I believe this place is that place he wants you to come to church it's a Gate of Heaven Amen brother Ram in the sermon the unchangeable word of God said the Bible says these signs shall follow them that believe God makes a distinction he gives a mark on the people if he believes these signs shall follow them back believe that's right the believer not to say that they believe not that they say they believe or not the supposed believer but the real believer he says I want to belong to a church that's got them signs and wonders following it that's where I want to have my fellowship right under the blood of Jesus Christ we're angels and Powers the Holy Ghost and God works back and forth through his church through his people showing signs and wonders notice this just as Jacob saw angels ascending and descending just as he said surely the Lord was in this place he says I want to be at a church I want to belong to a church Where Angels and powers and the Holy Ghost God works back and forth through his church through his people showing signs and wonders why it's the greatest thing I've ever known in my life it's part of Heaven on Earth amen notice how we our hearts become a home for heaven and brother bam identified a box car down on down by the river said it was a place where they had built some things and there used to be some indust things where they uh I can't remember just exactly how he described it there's a box car down by the river and they he in a Box Car by the river brother said if I ever found a heaven on Earth I found it there that day and now brother brandham says church is a part of Heaven on Earth and all these parts are working together we try to wrap this up just think about the parallel among the three gates I could try to preach as fast as I can and we could just slow the recording down down so it it's a normal speed but I'm I'm running out of time and I want to just finish here but let's just look in this kind of this uh this area here as we try to sum it all up this parallel among these three gates you have your body you have a house we have this church I believe our home life should reflect that hidden life there there's this hidden life down in our souls and it ought to be reflected in our attitudes our spirits and our bodies the way we present ourselves our home should be the same way that if we as the children of God dwell there that our home should reflect that what's on the walls what what has the preeminence what what kind of is the centerpiece I I I kind of noticed that sister Elizabeth and I have been we're Lord willing you pray for us we're building a house and in a lot of places when they build their house there's got to be this feature right that the the there's got to be a place you got to put the screen and everything has to orient that way and we don't even think about that at all as a matter of fact the more that I think about it our you know who's going to want to buy our grand room our grand living room because it's like so where do you sit to watch the TV right and so there's there's just things that we don't you don't make the centerpiece we don't make this is what we gather around there's a it's to be we want our homes to have a welcoming atmosphere because it's to be a gate to heaven and this church it exists to promote the health and well-being of those of individuals of your body and your home I think of how sister Kathleen had that Ministry to watch out over us in our in our health and to notice certain signs of certain things and she had a real burden uh how we could take care of ourselves and you know the Bible speaks so much of our health and and our bodies and taking care of our natural bodies and so this church this church exist to promote the health of our bodies of our spiritual well-being our physical well-being and to also promote the well-being of our homes and we need all three because together it constitutes that three- room house talks about a three- room house and that's all of us are a three room house he said God dwells in a three room house Body Spirit Soul the Tabernacle was arranged into those three areas the outer Court inner Court holy of holies if you took any one of those out it wouldn't be the temple it wouldn't be the Tabernacle as a matter of fact it's when they finally set up the outer wall to create the outer Court when the sh Glory came down the Tabernacle sh sh Glory came down into that holiest of holies why because God was signifying the necessity of those three parts I just don't want to have a saved saved soul and not have my spirit perfected and what and not have a redeemed body amen right God promises a total Deliverance a total Redemption Redemption of the Soul spirit and body he's going to redeem all three this is expressed in the Tabernacle in the instruments of the temple God expresses it so we are a three- room house and all are needed because together they make up what God wants us to have our soul is that innermost part that's the most private we don't see our souls but it's there where God dwells and then we have the spirit you look at that Spirit as being our house it's it it it it's hidden it's more personal but yet others can others can get to know it others know you by your personality by your spirit the things you think about the things you talk about and then you have your body which is the most visible it's the things that people see it's outward it's public and that's what this church church becomes not everybody's going to be able to go to your homes and everybody that goes to your homes isn't going to be able to go to the bedroom so we have a soul that only God enters in and he dwells but then as we invite people to our homes and our house they get to know us more personally more individually it's a place where everyone can Fellowship uh in this body in a more personal way but then this house becomes the public face and a place that welcomes The The Lost and the lonely it takes those that are hurting those that are burdened those that are sick those that are seeking and we welcome them here so they too can come in contact with god brother BR in the sermon and knoweth it not said that's three rings three circles and that's you and that's God God and a trinity is one and without a trinity he's not God quite a statement said he can be manifested he can't be manifested any other way and neither can you be manifested without being the Trinity person that you are that's Body Spirit Soul without either one of them you're not complete you didn't have a soul you'd be nothing if you didn't have a spirit you'd be nothing you didn't have a body you'd just be a spirit not a body so we need all three and that's what I'm kind of wanting to say now to you and kind of taking that thought that we've got to have not just a soul that's sealed but a house that's consecrated and a church that's set aside for the Living God that there's a place where God dwells in our hearts but then there's also a place where we dwell that's dedicated to God called a home and that we go to church and it's I I preached this on a Wednesday night to people who came to church so you could leave here going that's right I go to church on Wednesday wday nights and so we express it to you not just to encourage you but to show you're doing the right thing by coming here I don't think anybody I at our church there back in Texas would be streaming this or would know about it but I I started a series of couple years ago called kids eat free it's or a segment called kids eat free on Wednesday nights and the whole idea the whole idea just in case they do streaming I'm going to turn my mic off and I'm just going to share this off the Record because they all they don't know what it means at home they're all what does it mean kids e free but the whole concept and idea behind kids e free is we'll sometimes put our kids together put in the car and drive somewhere to eat maybe we don't even like but we do it because just tell me I can get something free and I'm there and you're making the right decision by having kid you're making the right decision by bringing your family to church your kids are eting for free they getting getting and my my vision my idea was oh I just wish the parents could catch the vision of what a benefit it is to their families when they come to the house of God on Wednesday nights they come on Sundays they make the sacrifices for youth meetings because it's such a benefit to the family and that's kind of the whole vision and that's what it means that kids eat free we have a duty to this body to your house to this church they're the Gates of Heaven we have a duty to consecrate them as homes for God we our individual persons our houses and this church become Gates of Heaven where others can have access to God I I I've preached an hour so now we got to kind of we I want you to be able to go all the way even back to the beginning start tying this all together what were gates to begin with what do we learn in the very beginning about a gate it's not just an entrance but it's a meeting place it's a place of authority a place of judging it's a place that represents the glory of a city the glory of a dwelling place it's a place of honor a place of respect a place of power and judgment it's a place where Justice is to go forth It's a place of strength a place where you to find truth and Justice so therefore as this gate was a place of business a place of transacting a place of deliberation a place where truth was to go forth a place where decisions were made a place where opinions were given then we are to be a place where others have access to Heaven a place where God is manifested a place where others can receive truth a place of God's power if it's the gate to a city that's a person's access to a city it's a place to the access of what the city has to offer I want to be a Gate of Heaven I want my home to be a Gate of Heaven for my children I want this church to be a Gate of Heaven for all that would come the Bible says that out of you would poor rivers of Living Waters and think of all those things that you become that even in your home in your house it becomes a place an entrance to Heaven a place where truth Goes Forth a place of deliberation a place where business is conducted a place where the right kind of atmosphere can be created and since this gate these Gates of the body the gates of your homes and the gates of this church are so important it's the gates where the enemy attacks where it try to makes us weak and vulnerable says that I have set the point of the sword against all their Gates here in Ezekiel 21:15 that their heart May faint their ruins be multiplied ah it is made bright it is wrapped up for the slaughter and when he refers to their Gates here he refers to the entirety of the city the palace and the houses I've set the sword against their Gates and so it's not just that you go up to a gate and go said I've set my sword against their Gates that means I'll get the city I'll get the palace I'll get the homes and that's what the devil wants to do he wants to set his sword against the gates against you as an individual against your house and against this church that's true therefore we must guard these Gates amen we must ask God to strengthen these Gates this body when I say body I mean you as a person Body Spirit Soul you as an individual strengthen our homes strengthen this church amen Proverbs 147: 12 and 13 praise the Lord oh Jerusalem praise thy God oh for he hath strengthened the bars of thy Gates Heath blessed thy children within Thee the strong the strength of the gates and fortifies the blessing of those within he strengthened the bars of thy Gates that should be our prayer that he would strengthen these Gates strengthen me as an individual that is the dwelling place of God that I could be a Gate of Heaven and Lord since I have a place I lay my head and I collect my valuables and I and I pay my rent or I pay the mortgage and there I am with my wife in my children and I invite others into it Lord strengthen that gate May that house be a a gate to heaven and Lord strengthen this church and all that consider themselves a part of it strengthen each one each member from the pastor all the way to the youngest Lord strengthen this church as we said on Sunday as I close this sister Cheryl and the musicians those that are here in Psalms 27 verse4 said one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple one thing have I desired that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life now that's David's desire and if I could just kind of peek into this God desires to dwell in you brother B said God goes to church every day he lives in his church how he lives in you the very desire that David expressed is only there because the desire that God originally expressed his desire to make your heart his home David's desire no wonder he had a heart like God's because God said I want to dwell in my people all the days of my life I want to be in them and as David said one thing have I desired that will I seek after the dwell in the house of the Lord whether he was referring to the Tabernacle in the wilderness or whether he' be referring to that Temple that one day would be built called the house of God in the Old Testament God home was that Tabernacle there behind the veil the shikan of Glory would come and dwell God's home was in the Tabernacle in the temple so we read already already tonight the New Testament this church that God builds God's home is in his church God finds rest in you and I God's Dwelling Place in the New Testament is in the hearts of his Believers it is his body and one day in eternity in the future home we're taught that God is resident with Man in Christ Christ and his bride where on Earth for all eternity in every single instance God's home is on Earth it's almost as if that Dimension that heaven that God created where he can manifest himself was just temporary because one day it's all going to be Consolidated in a new Heaven and new earth God's going to make his dwelling place on Earth so your heart matters now your home matters now this church matters now and with without any one of those you're not who you're supposed to be any one of those is out of the kilter if any one those of those is not dedicated if any one of those aren't his he says you're not complete brother brandham in the sermon God hiding himself in Simplicity than revealing himself and the same remember that's where you find God is in Simplicity that's why life is so complex so complicated really it's made to scatter us and to spread us out because God's in simplicity so if we can get spread bread then we won't find God so we got to come back to Simplicity to find God he says now I think it's our duty to make the inside right he's talking about the remodel at the Tabernacle a a and and there's this physical building but he says we have a duty to make the inside right by the grace of God to be ever so grateful to uh to God that our this will just not only be a beautiful building that we'll come to but may everyone now this is spoken of a Jefferson in Jeffersonville brandom tabernac he says may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristic of Jesus Christ in every person that comes in so there's you may it be a consecrated place to our Lord a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people so he says I trust it'll always be a house of God of beauty there's the beauty of God in his people your body the beauty of God in the church as he says I want May everyone who comes into the house of God see the beautiful characteristic of Jesus Christ in every person therefore we want this place to be a consecrated place where the beauty of the church being the character of the people may this house always be a house of God's Beauty therefore let us make our hearts a home for heaven that we might be the beautiful characteristic of Jesus Christ therefore if that's true of me then let it be true of my house that it may be made a home and may it be true of this place the house of the Lord that I call my home Church may it be a house of God's Beauty may we all be the Gates of Heaven amen could you stand together this evening thank you for your patience and allow me to just deliver that burden now don't go telling anybody what the kids eat free means we just bow our heads tonight sister Sher if you have a song on your heart just feel led to play maybe that song uh in my life Lord be glorified key of F I think in my life Lord be glorified that's what our desire is that's what God desired in creation as he desired that in what he created he would be glorified and not that just rocks would cry out or man would worship one that they couldn't see but that somehow the nature the divine nature of God could be expressed through that which he created and I believe that God wants our lives to glorify him and maybe we could just consecrate ourselves I know we make mistakes when I say we I'm not just saying the Royal we we I know I make mistakes I know you make mistakes and we can be really really hard on ourselves but just think of the grace of God to speak to us as he has through his word to say you're going to make it cuz I'm With You Jacob in all of his deceit and all of his fears and all of his problems in that moment he said I am with you and I will not leave thee until I've done that which I have spoken to thee of I God says the same thing to you tonight no matter how much doubting no matter how much conniving no matter how much falling no matter how much failing I am with thee and I will be with thee until I've done what I've spoken to thee of say Lord fulfill your promise in my life individually as a family and as a church those are the images the Gates of Heaven the individual the family and the church are to be Gates of Heaven if you need prayer just lift your hand to him as we pray our gracious Heavenly Father tonight Lord as we close this service and we'll soon be turning it over to Brother John we just ask that you'd be Grace gracious to the people who sat attentively Lord and they're not falling asleep they're not doodling lord they're listening somehow hanging on the words that are coming forth looking for you wanting to hear from you not Spellbound by you know those my grammar and the way I put something together Lord I believe in their hearts they they're hungry to hear from you so some sometimes they have to fight through my mannerisms they have to fight through the preachers Meandering but they're hungry for the truth Lord and I pray tonight that you would give them that which they have need of by quickening to them those things which they heard as from you those things which were from you to their hearts Lord may you Quicken them to them and our prayer is that you would be glorified in us that our individual lives could be a Gate of Heaven that our families could be a Gate of Heaven and that that this church would remain ever remain Lord a Gate of Heaven these beautiful Gates these wonderful Gates Lord we didn't have any one of them it just wouldn't be right Lord I pray that you make it so help us strengthen us and encourage us bless these families who sacrifice being to church on a Wednesday night with everything they have going on Lord to come to be here Lord may they be
