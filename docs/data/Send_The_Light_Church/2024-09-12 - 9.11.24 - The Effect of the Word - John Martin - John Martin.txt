amen let's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer before we approach the word dear father we thank you that you've given us health and strength to be in your house this evening and Lord we thank you for that desire that you placed inside Lord we know that this desire is literally leaving the people for you said there's a great apostasy uh taking place in this late hour where people would just draw back from you so Lord we're we counted a blessing this evening just to have the desire to be in your house today that we're Lord we're we're part of that that chosen uh elected seed that you placed inside of us before the foundation of the world and Lord It's still holding true to you we thank you for that and we pray that you would come in the the ministry of the word at this time to each of us that have that that have come and that we've gathered those that are live streaming perhaps those that would be maybe looking at the uh the archive in the future Lord I pray that the word would become a a quickened to them that they may be able to be benefited from your word because your word you sent your word to to bring healing and to meet all the needs that we could possibly have in our life and we just ask that this would become a real a a real Awakening in in US Lord that we may press on un into the rapture we thank you for these things we we're believing them now for we ask them in the name of of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of First uh Thessalonians chapter 2 and we're going to read uh a few verses there 11 12 and 13 the Bible says we're the Jesus said we're the carcasses there where the Eagles be gathered together and um you know back in the day there was a a lot of people that flocked around this message or flocked around Jesus because of all the Miracles but then as he said the word needs to be preeminent the Miracles was just to get your attention now what's really important to me God what's really important to Jesus was the word and and and and it's no different with the the message in this age it just it just seems that um we we we've just got to know where we're standing with the word amen this this today is is in one sense it may be looked at church but I want us to look at it as a spiritual Gathering amen of eagles to hear from the Lord amen first Thessalonians chapter 2 starting with verse number 11 as you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father doth his children so this is is real important that you walk worthy of God who have called you unto his kingdom and glory for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when you received the word of God which he heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of God which effectually worketh also in you that believe God bless you you may be seated we want to title this message the effect of the word the word of God is the only thing that can transform the nature of man I mean we can go to seminars we can we can do a lot of things to kind of help our lives but there's only one thing that can really change our old nature into the nature of God and that's the word of God the word of God is powerful it can it can heal our bodies it can speak to the storms uh it can speak to situations the word of God is ex is powerful if if we realize how powerful this really was um so many things that we could do but we've got to have faith in this word for us and and and and faith is is is a seed in itself but that is what activates the word and the scripture tells us here that when we believe the word that's being preached whether you're listening to a tape you're coming to church um you're reading the scriptures you must believe that it is God may not understand it may not know how it works but you must believe it's God and that if you believe it with all your heart it'll work in you it'll work but if you don't it'll actually condemn you it'll actually condemn you so this is this is the dividing line right here this is this is what separates the goat from the Sheep this is what's going to be used at the day of judgment and this is what God uses to save man is the word of God Amen and and we don't we don't want any anything else now I want to talk just a little bit about the Mana in the Old Testament everybody knows a little bit about the Mana right the children of Israel they they they really murmured because they weren't getting all their needs met like they were back in Egypt and they thought well hey look we're we're starving out here if we were back in Egypt at least they fed us and so God provided a food for them to eat and it was called Mana in Exodus 16 ver verse 14 it's described and when the Dew that laid was gone up behold upon the face of the Wilderness there was a small round thing as small as frost on the ground and when the children of Israel saw it they said one to another it is Mana for they wish not what it was in other words what is it and Moses said unto them this is the bread which the Lord have given you to eat and in verse 31 and the house of Israel called the name thereof mana and it was like a coridor a corridor seed that's about a eigh inch diameter that you know how big that is white and it taste of it was like Wafers made with honey and and this food was called man it was like what is they never like seen it before but it was everything that they needed was in that little seed every vitamin every mineral everything that they needed to sustain them for 40 years until they made it to the promised land was in that seed and it's the type of the Bride eating the word of God every day until what until they be become the word you eat the word to become the word because the word is the promised land it's it's it's our nature becoming just like God and you know God's working through a a heart with desires and free more agencies and we're constantly making decisions everybody makes a decision what you're going to eat every day what you're going to do every day how long you're going to sleep in when you're going to get up what you're going to do what you're going to accomplish and this is the same thing with becoming the word we can be satisfied with just coming to church be satisfied with just being baptized just um I'm in the message I'm I'm part of the group I I recognized the prophet I I I see Malachi and and we can become secure in those things but I am telling you that is not the promised land the the Mana was given to us to become it okay so why was it that the Catholic Church did not want to allow the Bible to get into the hands of the people back in the day because Satan does not want you to know who you are and he doesn't want you to know what you're to become amen if we don't read the Bible we're not if we don't get into it if we don't come to church and really get into the word then the word cannot come into us because it can only come through love I want this I want this for my life my flesh don't want it my flesh don't want it your flesh don't want it we don't want to sit here and and and and and and come subject to to correction and direction for our lives we'd rather just do what we want to do but it all comes down to us there's only one thing that makes it to the other side you must be born again what does that mean that means we must become the word right we become the word that's what the new birth is it's not some experience that we say we had it is something where our nature changed and that's why we see so many people come and go you know one day they're on fire the next day you don't see them they they come to church for 6 months then they're not here and they they put other things in priorities and and and it's just a a trick of Satan to get them away from what they need to become the word we need to eat the word every day you know we are what we eat right our promised land is to become like Christ so I I I believe it every every day we get up and we all look in the mirror right we all look in the mirror and when we look in the the mirror we usually say Lord help us right now it's not looking too good and we we we wash we shower we do whatever we do we we we comb we brush we we put on better clothes right we put on better clothes we we put in clothes and then we look you know better one day we're going to become like Christ and John said in 1 John 3:1 behold what manner of love the father has given us has put upon us that we should be called the sons of God and the world doesn't know who who we are because it didn't know who he was beloved now are we the sons of God if we all if we if we are Son of God we always were a Son of God we just didn't know it then but now we do know it but the scripture says it doesn't it doesn't appear it it it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear because the Bible tells us that when he shall appear we shall be like him we're going to see him as he is now this word will take an effect in our life if we believe it and if we believe it the Bible says every man that has this hope inside of him what does he do he purifies himself he says I want to do what I need to do to become Christ and if you don't have that hope if you think no no no no well then you're not going to purify yourself you're you're just how many people just come to church one way and they leave they leave church where brother Ram says you never leave the same says you're either closer or further so in other words when you hear the truth and you don't take it then you actually become worse off and how many how many's ever been in a spot where you thought wow I feel like I'm in a worse shape than I was before we've all we've all we've all battled that we've all had that and I I'll just say it like this it is possible for that to happen you know if if brother Brandon says we backslide 100 times a day just in our thoughts and in different ways you know brother Brandon would rededicate his life he was a prophet and yet he said I I I would rededicate my life at night just get down on my knees and because this flesh is at gravity pulling us away from the promised land and we've got to fight it Romans 8:29 says from whom God did for for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son so there it is again that we might be the firstborn that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren another scripture telling us that our promised land is to be like God our nature and and and this is where our Nature's changed it's not on the other side because Jesus said you must be born again to get to the other side so the nature changes Happening Here we must be serious about letting the word take an effect in our life Philippians 3:14 Paul's saying I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ he pressed towards it and other words I am going to purify myself I'm going to press in I'm going to do more than barely make it to church once in a while I just you know as much as I I know this this m message honestly is the cream of the crop it is the cream of the crop and and though people know it is the cream of the crop just being in a church where the message is honored it's preached it doesn't make the word live in us we we need to treasure the message we need to treasure the word that's being preached and we've got to say God if this is really what you're calling me John Martin to do then I must do it Romans 8:18 says for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us so yes you know to go ahead and purify yourself and pray and and and and and and and and try to get rid of the carnality and spend time with God it is suffering but that that little bit of suffering that we're that we really have to do is is not you can't compare it with eternity you can't compare it with the glory that God's going to give us for the earnest expectation of the of the creation is waiting for the manifestation of you and me there's actually something waiting on us all of creation is waiting on us Mana is a type of Jesus Christ the word and Jesus said I am the bread of life that cometh down from heaven and he that eateth this bread shall have everlasting life so we literally have to partake of the word of course we know that there were those that thought he was they were teaching some sort of doctrine that you have to be a cannibal and eat the flesh right and but the word that he was speaking his his words were spirit and they were life he was the manifestation of the word the word became flesh and he was living among the people and he was he was trying to show that you you need to listen to the words that I'm saying and believe them because if you don't the word will not have an effect so even though we're in the message we we believe it's true it it doesn't mean we're going to become it we we have to start activating the word in our life we have to activate the only way we can activate the word is to believe it and the belief that I'm talking about is not a belief of of of a mental belief because the Devils have that they believe and and they tremble and and their nature is not changed but a sinner who recognizes God is my only hope my only answer faith in the word of God can change his very nature God made it so simple that we all can be Overcomers the self- religious of that day said our fathers ate Mana in the wilderness they partook of the supernatural experience God supplied their their needs their shoes didn't wear out and God was with them every day the pillar of cloud was there they could testify that God was with them but they did not testify that God was not pleased with them and we've got to come to grips with this word needs to be life to us people people are are are are coming to the church and they're leaving and they're not taking the word serious we're because we're living in in such a terrible hour such a terrible hour but Jesus said to every one of those that they were in their testified he said they are everyone dead so it wasn't good enough that God just brought him out of the world it wasn't good enough to just be brought out of the world and and and recognize that this is the way to the promised land the message is the way to the promised land it is the way to a nature change because the message breaks down what the words really saying the Mana became common to the children of Israel they died because they murmured at eating the man in other words they got tired of it they got tired of it they murmured they complain they had everything it it had everything they needed to make it but when you complain against the word of God then the very vehicle that's supposed to take you to a nature change doesn't take you there because you're resisting what it's what it's telling you you're not eating it I'd rather go home and eat this right why why make a sacrifice why suffer and and and and and and and do these things when there's an easier way well that's just that's just the devil and and people I'm not saying you now but I'm saying that people get caught up in this this this murmuring uh and this complaining and they want something more and this this is I I so believe in bringing a fivefold ministry here and I'll tell you why because if we don't make it with a five-fold Ministry we weren't going to make it that's all there is to it I I'm not going to be the reason some of you don't make it I am not going to be the reason I may be the reason I'm not popular and I'm okay with that because I really don't care about being popular but I'm not going to be the reason that we don't make it I'd rather I'd rather tell you the truth see when you murmur and you're complaining what happens is your faith doesn't got a chance to grow if your faith doesn't got a chance to grow then all you can do is believe the word like the devils in other words it can't work in you our whole goal is to get the word to work in us if we're sick we want healing we want that word to work in us if we need deliverance we want that word to work in us we're we're looking for the word to take an effect inside of us and the only thing that can activate the word is Faith and and the faith has to be not well I I know that's not brother John that I know that's the word of God he's saying it he's preaching the prophet said it it it it can't be that what does it have to be it has to be that God is speaking to me God is speaking to me not brother John not brother brandom God is speaking to me when you know that it's God then you you you have that Faith to say it's mine until then you just have hope and and God does want us to get desperate you know brother B preach that message is desperation I mean you're not going to purify yourself unless you're desperate I mean because the devil can really he can paint a good picture you you know well you're always human you're always going to make mistakes you know you're always going to be you're always going to be so why Try right so it it just takes you away from trying to press into Christ and look we're all battl on a leoan spirit very strong but too many message Believers today they come to church they listen to the word of God but they never fall in love with the word they hear it but they don't fall in love with it they can even say Amen but they don't fall in love with it you we need to fall in love with the word it's the only thing that can save us and what happens to the message Believers today who don't fall in love with their Bible their faith doesn't grow enough to go into the promised land and what is the promised land that my nature can really be changed people start coming to church because they want their natural needs met that's all that's that's all they're interested in I got this issue I got this problem I got this i got this and really that was just to get our attention and I do believe that the word of God is powerful to meet every need I do believe that but you don't just belittle the power that it has to change our nature which really causes the majority of our needs which really causes the majority of our problems is our own nature right you step on my toe and I'm going to really step on yours right and that starts something where if I had the nature changed I would say it's okay it's okay and then the problem isn't is bad but when we're sitting here as a judge like we're we're like we're some sort of what's right or wrong when God has ordained those things to happen brother brand said that it's not the action that happens around us but it's how we react to that that is what God is looking at you notice that there's some some people they're just God put them in your life to perfect you they may never humble themselves to say I'm sorry I need to do better they the only thing they may say is you shouldn't have done what you did causing you to say I am sorry for how I reacted and you sit there and you may wonder is this not going to go any further this isn't fair this isn't right my neighbor I cannot believe but in reality God is perfecting a few bride a few bride and that bride is what he's coming back for I mean he would that all would be saved right but they're not I would say he would that all would be bride but they're not somebody's got to fulfill the foolish and the the the you know not watching you know Jesus said watch and pray and there's little to see is about I'm I'm I'm I feel like I'm okay I feel like I'm okay the time you feel okay is the time you know you're not okay because we we need to be pressing we need to be pressing I want Faith to become like Jesus turn with me if you would to Galatians Chapter 5 Verse 6 well this is this is um I only I had a few pages but already I can't even get there I'm not going to get to the end that's how slow this is going but I hope I hope it's a it' be a help to somebody lay it's kind of like a a little bit of a lengthy Foundation but Galatians 5:6 for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything or uncircumcision whether you're you know go by the law or go by what you say I don't need to do that he says but Faith which worketh by love that's I'm saying when we come to church and we hear the word of God we've got to fall in love with the word because if we don't fall in love with it how are we going to believe it it it it's it's a love affair yes God God will truly heal many people that never get saved he will he will literally save many people that don't make it whoa look if you do the first step he'll go there but the time that you say I'm not walking anymore that's your choice God ain't going to say well I saved you no matter what and see this this this concept of all these doctrines that are made up I call them doctrines of devils what they do is they take the fear of God out of people right that you know I don't need to worry about this and I don't need to worry about that and I got such security it's a false sense of security because if you really were cure you would still be pressing in to that image you would still be you you that would be God in you in control taking you to the promised land and so the these Spirits are just you know they're looking to seek who they can who can who they can get and you know you may be talking to them and and someday you may be sitting by them and shaking their hands and and and texting them the scripture says you did run well like we got to get these scripture we you did run well who did hinder you that you stopped in other words they should not obey the truth at one time you were obeying the truth you were coming to church you're trying to do the right thing I'm going to put this into action thank God he showed me this and you you went out rejoicing and and trusting and and believing and then all of a sudden you got hindered who did hinder you that you should back away from following the whole word well I still do this and I but look what about the rest of the word well God knows God understands God sees God told me really see it's a trick but I love it you did run well but something stopped you and he said that this persuasion cometh not of him that originally called you out of the world this persuasion that you're dealing with right now where that hunger and that thirst from more of God that persuasion didn't come from what you think it is from God well God understands that I got to deal with this and I got to deal with that you I remember as clear as day when I was putting the offices on at at trusted tool and I was in the office you know basically myself and uh putting the the floor in and I was just sitting there and I was listening to the war that was going on in in the in the golf and I I remember hearing that they they took out their communication like the first thing and and I'm just trying to think you know what you know why are they doing this and you're thinking well they they weren't able to communicate to one another if you notice the first thing that the devil does is he takes people away from the church he takes them away from God being able to communicate with them and you know what they do they're so proud that they think they don't need church anymore that God can still speak to them that they don't need that and you know when we start to think like that then we're disrespecting God's order and how is God G to give you faith for anything when you're not humble yourself to to to follow the word the word says forsaking not well it's it's it's it's it's my job it's it's it's this it's that give me some give me some quotes give me some scripture give me something to where I can say okay I can't say okay as a pastor we need to be in church the devil is trying to stop the communication so you don't feel the conviction and I know I'm not I'm not speaking so much you Faithful Saints it's true we can say Amen to it and we can say thank you God for showing me but we got to rest the part of the body that Satan is hindering them they at one time they did run well they were coming faithfully and I I'm not just talking about one or two families I'm talking about quite a few A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump I want us to remember that who who hindered you who hindered you that you should not obey the truth we're living in the worst time in history lukewarm is so powerful that people don't even know it's on them I mean I mean if I was pushing against your body real strong you would feel that pressure but this lukewarm Spirit you do not feel it but it is yet so powerful that it just pushes you away from pressing into God Paul told Timothy to preach the word to be instant inseason out of season to re reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come that they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own desires their own lust they shall Heap to thems teachers having itching ears just wanting to hear what they want to hear if I don't get what I want hear I'm going to go somewhere else oh I was told of a uh some things that are going on and and and and the people are just church happen again we we we we need we need God the realness of God in their life and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables now everybody knows what a fable is a fable is a partial truth there's partial truth enough to say oh yeah it it what and then all a sudden just enough to get you away the thing is a fable can't put us into the promised land it can't get the nature change the word of God is the only thing that can bring the nature change we we just got to come to grips with God your word needs to become king in my life it needs to become Supreme priority it needs to become preeminent in my life 1 Timothy 4:1 says now the spirit IR speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith given heed to seducing Spirits doctrines of devils speaking lies and hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron in other words when you try to talk to them about the word they won't even listen to you and all you're doing is speaking the word it's not your word it's God's word but they don't want to honor God's word word and the spirit that's in them will come against you uh and how do you get to a place where your your conscience isn't bothered you just resist God enough resist God enough how do our hearts become Harden resist God enough it's all through fre more agency that's why it's important that we allow the word to become real to us the word that this is important it's not how I feel it's what God wants this know also that in the last days perilous time shall come now as I speak these words I want you to just think about if you see these things in the church for men shall become lovers of their own self Covetous bolsters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce and even despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such you we've been instructed to turn away from that type of spirit ever learning but never able to come to a full maturity as brother Aaron was sharing with us what a wonderful uh services that we had about uh about becoming a mature Christian and not being satisfied with just saying I'm I'm saved I'm I'm I'm born again but but but um get up from that place of complacency and say I want to be more than what I am I want to be all that God's called me to be the word has got to become preeminent in our life amen we don't want to play church we don't want to live in lukewarm leoda Peter said I stir up your minds by a way of remembrance that you be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the Commandment of us the Apostles of our Lord and savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days the first thing scoffers and how do you know them they're walking after their own desires they're doing what they're doing because they want to do instead of just saying you know the word says that and I need to do that so you know these are people that are in the message these are people that are called message Believers and saying where is the promise of his coming if they felt the coming to the Lord was now in a week in a month the church would be filled I don't care what their jobs I don't care what their boss said I don't care what's happening in the sports I don't care about anything they would be here but because there's that Spirit of well you know it ain't going to happen for a while see it opens the door we don't realize that these Spirits can get on us get on the message Believers for since the the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation and for this they willingly are ignorant in other words I'm okay with this I'm okay with the way I'm thinking but the day of the Lord is going to come as a thief in the night the Mana became common to the children of Israel and we can't let the word become common to us we just can't we've got got to fight against that Hebrews 2:1 says therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard give heed to it less at any time it should slip how many times have we heard something and we said amen that's the truth I need that and then we completely forgot it it is our responsibility to not let things slip the important things the family altar amen prayer reading the Bible telling the family we are going to serve God taking a stand you we we just we we can't keep saying well you know how so and so is and you know this and you know that just take a stand I don't care if you stand by yourself you take a stand and you say me in my house We Shall Serve the Lord because if you don't do that Satan's going to keep work working his way and bringing everything down for unto us the Bible says was the Gospel preached as Wells unto them but the word preached did not profit them because it was not mixed with faith in them that Heard It In other words they came to church but they just heard it as the word of man they said that's just Brother John that's just a man speaking or reading the Bible or given his thoughts and that's why it's you know for people that just maybe come for like maybe four or five Services we've had a number of people that have done that they're looking for something that fits them right instead of like is this where the truth is at because the truth is the only thing that sets us free from our old nature to the nature of God truth is the only thing that can set us free and if we get if we get complacent we get tired we we don't want the truth we murmur We complain we thought we had things easier when we can do what we want to do then yes God will let us go back in the world he'll let us go get another church but I'm telling you the bride is going to stay with the word no matter what she'll stay with the word and we need to fear we need to fear that we don't miss what this word can do for our life don't come complacent the Bible says faith which worketh by love Faith which worketh by love fall in love with the word of God fall in love with the word because you're not going to get hindered if you're in love with the word if you don't love the word then any little persuasion comes by it's going to take you away from your responsibility brother baham said you need to be at your post of Duty every time the doors are open but you know what people say they're in the message but they're not the message has to be in you Amen in other words that word needs to be real to you Jude reminds us of our responsibility in Jude the very first chapter of Jude and it's also the very last chapter of Jude Jude 1 I want to start with verse 17 but beloved remember ye The Words which were spoken before by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ and he's basically speaking of the same things that we just just heard he said how that they told you that there should be mockers in the last [Music] time I don't need to go who should walk after their own Godly lust these be they who separate themselves from the body of Christ sensual what that means is natural carnal having not the Holy Ghost but you tell them they don't have the Holy Ghost and they're offended but you know what I'm here at this ppet to say if you're not walking with the word you need to be checking out what ghost you got brother bandam said the Holy Ghost feeds on the word if you got it why ain't the Holy Ghost feeding on the word here but ye beloved verse 20 these two verses I want to get to but ye beloved building up yourself on the Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keeping yourself in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life this is not the pastor's job the pastor's job is not to build you up you're supposed to build yourself up because you need to use your time to do it not my time it's your faith not my faith you need to pray in the Holy Ghost not somebody for you you need to pray you need to keep yourself in love with God I can't keep in love I can't keep you in love with God if you don't want to hang out out and get serious with real Believers and you just want to use them for what you can get out of them you're going to fall in love with God we ought to be looking for the mercies of the Lord Jesus Christ the just look at your life and you can tell whether the word of God has taken effect inside or you've lost your love for the Bible an awesome responsibility that's been been given to us turn with me in our opening scripture now in first Thessalonians chapter 2 but I want to start with verse with verse um uh um seven verse number seven an if we could get that up there it wasn't even in my notes for you 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 verse number s so notice here but we but we were gentle among you even as a nurse cheth her children now that's pretty gentle isn't it and this is talking about the the ministry now right this is Paul among the Thessalonian church so being affectionately desires of you he he goes on to express the very heart of a pastor here he says we were willing to have imparted unto you not the gospel of God only but also our own Souls because you were dear unto us so we're setting this this Foundation here that Paul really had a burden when he preached the gospel it was preaching out of love it wasn't I'm upset I'm at I'm angry at you I am bothered at you look there is one man I'm very bothered with and that's the devil because he is the one that tricks people and he needs to be called out you know the thing is we can only call him out in our life and and if we do that we can get you know we can get down to business with God and look so he goes on to to express this great love he says for you remember Brethren our labor and we travailed all the time that we spent with you for we labored day and night because you would not be chargeable unto any of you we preached unto you the gospel of God and you are witnesses and God also how holy and justly and unblamable we behaved ourselves among you that believed and you know how we exhorted and we comforted and charged every one of you as a father doth his children so you can see there's just a real heart of of love that that Paul is is having here as a father does for his children that you would walk according to what the word of God says walk worthy who have called you into the new light walk in the light as he gives you the light and for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when you receive Reed the word of God which he heard of us you received it not as it as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of God which effectually worketh also in you that believe the word of God cannot work if we don't believe the word cannot work out our problems if we're not trusting the word if we're not having confidence in the word if we're not relying on the word if we're if we're not believing the word that word cannot help us it can't help our problems we'll sit in our misery why sit here till we die the problem isn't the the the the Bible it isn't God it isn't the church it isn't the people it's our faith in the word of God this is a personal relationship between us and God the word can only be active made Al alive made powerful when we believe otherwise it's just like a brand new car sitting out there you you can't if there's no spark if there's no gas the thing will not do is potential but you put the spark you put the gas you turn that baby it starts you can get it you can drive anywhere this word will take us anywhere we want to go it'll take us to Joy it'll take us to peace it'll take us to love it'll take us to the promised land it'll take us to the Holy Ghost but we've got to believe it Saints we got to recognize the spirits are attacking our homes they're attacking our church they're attacking our minds and we need to take a stand stand for the word because it's the only thing that can save us the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it we got to mix it we got to say Amen to it we got to say Lord I want this for my life I want this for my family I want this for my children I want this at work I want this with my friends I want this Lord love the word I want this for my life I want this for my heart we don't do that it's just a dead letter we have a form of godliness we have just enough of God to to be miserable God's supposed to be a god of joy in his presence is fullness of joy but we can get to a place where we only have enough of God to be miserable right because God has an expectation that we would walk in more light than what our flesh wants to turn with me if you would to Romans chapter 10 Romans chapter 10 starting with verse number 13 For Whom Shall for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved I love this scripture it's a beautiful scripture this is the promise if we don't call on upon the name of the Lord with faith how shall God save us from any situation not just salvation but I'm talking about Deliverance I'm talking about overcoming I'm talking about anything from from problems we've got to literally we talked about a little bit this um earlier today in our men's meeting but you know this altar used to be flooded with people yes I'm a witness this altar used to often be filled with people who would come and call upon the name of the Lord who hindered you because if you don't call upon the name of the Lord with faith not just say God you know I need I'm going to believe no call call seek God is looking for us to reach out with a a hunger I need you Lord and with the promisees you shall be saved and don't be satisfied with salvation be satisfied with seeing the holy ghost in your in your home in your life verse 14 how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a Preacher Brother Dennis is a pretty good preacher out there he goes and he shares the word giving them a chance to call upon the name of the Lord how are we going to call on God if we're entertaining thoughts well we're just that's just brother John talking right now he's just like you know talking directly to me really the other people they shouldn't even came to church because he's just talking so much to me they're entertaining thoughts that is Brother John and not the word of God right we must believe that we're hearing from God through the office that God has ordained and and we don't we shouldn't be leaving the church and sitting in the in the couches amen we shouldn't be getting up and going in other Church 15 times and I know I understand I I praise God for the faithful examples but here if we want to really see things changed in life we need to get in love with the word come as close as you can to the word and say God I want to leave here change because I'm telling you God has not changed his love toward you he has not changed the word has not changed I'll say it like this the church has not changed it still has that Vision but something has hindered you that you should not OB obey the truth there's a persuasion out there trying to get us lukewarm all right verse 15 how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the free are the are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace isn't that beautiful of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good child you ever come to church and feel like you didn't hear peace and you didn't hear any Glad Tidings of good things right you ever you ever do that well I believe that verse 15 is not speaking the gospel is not the scripture is not always talking about a Feelgood Prosperity message and I'm going to try to prove that right now when the Angels appeared to the Shepherds and said fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people For unto you unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord now it was a it was Christ to the mass but it wasn't like a Christmas present for everybody and what I mean by that is when the Savior came to age the very savior that they announced the Good Tidings when he came to age and he brought the gospel he said you must be born again or you can't enter in so the very savior told us how to be saved and and if we follow the word we got peace that's that's good tidings but see the world wants peace and good tidings without sacrifice they want to feel good message they want to feel that they're not you know being challenged basically and and that's that's that's in the world that's in the worldly church that's not here we've we've got to take the word all the word we we just can't act in way we want and say I'm born again don't try to tell me different I want your life to speak to me that is born again I want to hear of your affairs that you're born again you understand what I'm saying verse 16 now but they have not all obeyed see there it is so when the when the when the gospel of peace and and the Good Tidings of good things Glad Tidings of good things when it was preached they didn't obey it for they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah says Lord who have believed our report we come to church church we preach the word but I say to us how many in this church is actually believing it who has believed the report because the report says press in the report is say be faithful the report says we need to become like Christ we're predestinated to that Direction that's what the report says but our lives are the report card they show they show and look I I don't I don't I I really don't want to be in this spot of well you know I just I just believe you know everybody's saved look that may or not be true and it's not for me to say but what we should be saying to one another is when we think that the others are not doing what they should be doing we should stand up and say the gospel says we should do this that's giving them a chance and if they say nope don't want it okay okay all the more you be faithful all the more you be faith faithful because God is definitely not going to Rapture everybody that's ever stepped into this church it's not going to but you've got to believe your bride you've got to believe you are one of the few you've got to believe that you're going to be the one that's going to be faithful to the end and I love this 17th verse so then faith comes by hearing and the hearing comes from hearing from God by the word of God not brother soul and soul but I say unto you have they not all heard Verse 18 yes they all heard their sound went out the preaching went out the word went out to the ends of the word but they have not obeyed so I say it like this you've got to mix the the word that's being preached in our church you got to mix it with faith you got to say you got to believe that you're going to become it this this this this message is to bring us into Christlike image it's not to make us feel better be better people it's to bring us into an image of Christ to where we want to do what he does and and be be be what he wants us to be the calling is so much higher than just sometimes I think what we think it is Faith is a seed it's the only thing that can make the word of God alive in our life and that's why it's so important to build ourselves up take time to build ourselves up in believing that this is God in other words there's no doubt if we took a test right now brother Mar if I had you pass out the papers and I had uh brother Luke pass out all the pens well we would and I asked the question how many believe this is the word of God we would all say yes Ace the test but the real question is which when when are you desirous to hear God speak this word to you because unless he speaks it to you how can it be Faith because faith is the voice of God spoken to you personally so it's not good enough to say I believe that's God's word I believe it that's not the test the test is what has he spoken to you what has he spoken to you because when he speaks to you it don't matter if everybody's against you you know the truth can you say Amen to that amen Jesus said my words they are spirit and they are life so if we perceive them as just letters on the paper just words in the book or historical facts or stories or or things like that then we really can't get Faith out of it we've got to believe that I'm going to hear from God personally Faith cometh by hearing God speak this word to us personally when he speaks it just understand when he speaks to you personally nobody else hears it nobody else hears it but if we're just hearing the word by these natural ears and our natural understanding we're all hearing that we're all hearing that but that that is not enough to believe the report the real faith comes when God spoke to me personally this is how much it's important to believe God's word Isaiah 5510 says for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but but WTH the Earth and maketh bring forth uh Bud that it may give seed to the so bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but sh it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto I sent it and I love verse 12 here for you shall go out with joy when you truly hear the word of of God and it sinks down in your heart it will prosper the in your life for you shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace and the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and the Trees of the field shall clap their hands because the word is real to you no wonder David said one thing if I desired of the Lord and that I seek after all the days of my life that I would Dell well I want to be where God is at I want to be where God is at Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path I want us to start coming to church I want us to start talking to others in our church those of you that are live streaming those of you that watching the archive I want us to talk about the power of the word that the word is really a light it's not a dos and don'ts it's a light to our path it shows us where to walk it shows us it shows us do we go to church every time the doors are open or don't we see it's a light does it say we can just you know uh treat people bad no it's a light it tells us how to treat Jesus said that to do unto others as we'd had them to do unto us see the word is a lamp to our feet spiritually but we got to fall in love with the word I want to please the Lord that that if that's not priority coming to church is probably not a real big interest to to people it's the truth look look the the gospel is not made to change your will if that's true then that God would have nothing but robots the word is presented to show this is God's love for you he loves you as a father does his children he he he cherish you he he nurtures you he cares but God is not going to come out of his word to have a personal relationship with you he is not going to step out out of his word go into your life to have a personal relationship with you God wants us in love with who he is he is the same yesterday today and forever he never is going to change all right it is time is filled with um lots of minutes you know that's all I'm going to say about that remember the Centurion remember the Centurion came to the Lord and he [Music] said I I I have a servant if you would just if you would heal him and Jesus said I'm I'm coming and and he said no not needed just speak the word only the faith was in the word we've got to take this because what what did Jesus say he said go thy way as thou H has believed so it be done to thee and his servant was healed in the self same hour he said verily I say to you I have not found so great a faith because he recognized that the word of God is Authority in the spiritual realm over demons and we've got to believe that this word is real if Satan can get us to just think that this is just church he's taken the effect of the word out of us we've got to believe that that that God sent me to this Church to build my relationship with God and I I'm I'm I'm going to stay the course I'm going to stay in line I'm gonna I'm going to stay right there because there's an expected end that God has faith is a substance it's a real substance and it will make the word live because God used the same thing that we need to change our life he used that same substance of faith to to create worlds to create the world we live in to create everything he used Faith the the elders obtained a good report through faith the Bible tells us that uh um that that not only the elders but but look at Enoch uh Enoch he had a testimony he he he was he was he had a testimony that he he pleased God he walked with God by by faith Noah he was a witness uh Abel was was a was a witness that that that that his Revelation was was a witness that that he truly received from God what to do and when we come to church I understand there's lots of spirits lots of things going on lots of things going on in our lives in our world we got to come to church and we got to get real serious about one thing I got to hear from God I've got to hear from God because things are going to go They're not they're not going to we don't have what we need to defeat the Devil we need God to do that in us that's that's why we got to come to church with a desperation God I humble myself before you because honestly the Rapture is going to take place brother bam said people are still going to come to the altar thinking they're getting saved this this mentality so we we just I'm so glad that we got the word that we just gota we gotta pinch our conscience brother B said you know I think we got to pinch our conscious more now than back then right because Le to see us so much stronger let's Stand Together God bless you build keep building keep building yourself keep praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourself in love with God and encourage others encourage others as you talk to them as they come to church encourage them to press in I believe that when you do that you're doing exactly what God has want you to do I believe that because God wants us all to make it and we we we need one another amen let's sing um I I love him let's just sing I love him fall love with the word I love him I love him [Music] because he first Lov me purchase [Music] my un fre
