raise up a group there in Holland amen amen um let's uh let's just take a look we'll read a few of these verses here um maybe we'll just start in a word of prayer feel to pray first amen our heavenly father Lord we thank you that you've allowed us to be in your house today that in itself is a great privilege we know Lord that this just isn't in the old building but Lord you can take any place and when two or three are gathered together you promise to be there in the midst Lord there's something special about the little uh Tabernacles that you have scattered around the world that have dedicated those places for the preeminence of almighty God lord we just pray that you would have you'd feel that Liberty this morning to come and minister to our hearts through your precious word father we pray that the message that you have for us may you open it up may you break the bread of life to us may may each one of us receive from you Lord the things that you have for us amen pray that you would uh bind the hands as it were of Satan and all the Demonic d that would try to come and stop that from happening we know we're in a spiritual battle Lord we also know greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world Amen Lord we yield oursel to you commit this service with every need that be among us bless those that are live streaming today Father we ask that you'd meet with them in their homes God that you touch their bodies Lord whatever the request would they would have may you meet that Lord through the ministry of the word we'll give give you the praise and honor but we ask these things humbly now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen well here in the Book of Ecclesiastes we know that uh Solomon was a man we he was a great man of wisdom and he wanted wisdom and I love his motive for wanting wisdom it wasn't that he could gain for his own but that he might be able to do the the job that God had given him amen the very possible best he and he he felt that insufficiency and so God uh blessed him as you know God gave him wisdom and gave him a lot more and he said his heart to know everything that was under the sun you name it he wanted to learn it he increased with knowledge but when he got all done he said vanity of vanities all is Vanity amen said what profit have a man of all his labors which he have taken Under the Sun Solomon learned that history repeated itself and he could get nothing from all his labors he wasn't taking it with him he even said that he that increaseth in knowledge increased in sorrow so when he sat back after seeking the very best that he could to understand it was all vanity amen I like to start here in Ecclesiastes 12:9 with this in mind and further by these my son be astonished oh verse nine I'm sorry and moreover because the preacher was wise he still taught the people knowledge yeah he gave good heed and sought out and set in order many Proverbs the preacher sought to find out acceptable words that which was written was upright even words of truth the words of the wise are as Golds As Nails fastened by the matter by masters of assembly which are given from one Shepherd and further by these my son be astonished of making many books there's no end in and much and much study is weariness of the flesh Amen Let Us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments amen for this is the whole duty of man amen for God shall bring every work into judgment and every secret thing uh whether it be good or whether it be evil amen God bless you you may be seated this morning we want to entitle this message God's conclusion for our lives amen God's conclusion for our lives and we want to just have a little introduction to the fear of the Lord it it's it'd be hard you could do a study and actually a number of different things that that we're going to go into today but we want to just try to focus on the fear of the Lord amen amen I I I'll say this I believe that every one of us could benefit more in our life if we had more of the fear of the Lord am and I believe we would be able to accomplish the will of God more for our lives if we had it right before we get into I want to talk about there's two types of fear one is the fear of torment and then the other is like the fear of reverence amen now these two fears come from two different Spirits brother Bram said the message Serv we would see Jesus he said there's only two Spirits One Believes and the other does not believe now James 2:19 says the devil's believe and tremble right so it's a different type of belief amen the Devils they they they shudder they quiver they shake like a leaf involuntarily as a result of their anxiety because they know what's coming amen but they've never believed with a submission to the word and I tell you that's how a lot of Believers are they believe there's a God they believe the word is true but they won't submit to it there's no than the devil's believes we know the devil deceiveth the whole world now the fear uh that is torment let me just say it like this I don't want to give the devil any credit for his ability to scare people that's right I want to say this fear of Torment is nothing but afflicting thoughts from the devil I want to keep it real simple this is the John Martin definition of where fear starts it is the afflicting thoughts from the devil that's all they are how many times have we heard there's nothing to fear than fear itself and I thought boy I don't want to fear fear I don't want to fear fear and fear is what but fear if fear is just an afflicting thought there's nothing to worry about it the devil can't hurt you afflicting thoughts can't hurt you unless you listen to them unless you yield to them right fact the Bible says perfect love cast out all fear righten perfect love for God perfect love in God will actually cast out those thoughts now when we yield to these afflicting thoughts of the devil they will manipulate this is a lot what we feel what happens and we wonder why we fear but these thoughts will manipulate intense in unbearable feelings in us that causes emotional and often times physical sufferings I'm telling you the truth amen look at Stephen for a second Stephen when they begin to Stone him of course he had a lot of afflicting thoughts don't you think Stones being stoned upon you and I believe that the thoughts that he had really brought about or or I shall say this trying to bring about some unbearable feelings because anybody throws a rock at you in an aspect to kill you because that's what they were doing they're trying to Stone him right but there was something inside of Stephen it was the love of God yes right that he could literally say at the time of going through his trial father forgive them for they know not what they do and I believe that love just cast out the devil and all that he was trying to give him the Bible says that his his countenance shine like an angel look at Paul and Silas when they were inside a prison feeling that where is God right you can see all the thoughts that could come to him but they would not yield themselves to those afflicting thoughts and if you don't yield to the afflicting thoughts that means the devil can't manipulate your feelings and your emotions to believe things that do not exist that's where you cast down all imagination and everything that exalteth itself against Christ amen they began to sing and worship and God was pleased with their faith amen amen now after the devil manipulates us into a state of emotional or physical sufferings this is what triggers feelings inside of us right a whole host of problems yes we can get angry we can get violent we can start threatening we can feel lonely we can say things and do things that we really don't mean all because we've a these emotions are real inside of us these feelings are real inside of us and then that same fear that attacks us gets on us and we begin to express yes the the the result of the fear that comes from torment amen the spirit of the devil his job is to torment us yeah that's what the devil means that mean he's a tormenter now the devil can't can't do nothing to us but if he can get us to believe his afflicting thoughts his lies then he will manipulate us amen I want you to remember this statement when we yield to the fear of manipulation that same spirit of fear on us will now begin to manipulate others yes we'll start getting angry at others we'll start pushing we'll start bullying people around we'll start saying things because we're being op we're operating from a spirit of fear we don't even realize [Music] it now God's nature never wants us to fear him like that that's right right he doesn't give us afflicting thoughts that cause us to have overwhelming feelings of Stress and Anxiety that does not come from God Amen God is not a manipulator he's a a gentleman God is a god of love amen the attributes that God has always has been he's wanted to express himself as a savior that ain't manipulative as a redeemer as a Healer these are these are uh uh if I could say it like these these are attributes that want to help not afflict us Amen to comfort us to shelter us to to be our refuge to be our provider to be one that is merciful and gracious to he wanted to express those things to us all stemming from his love and the love of God will cast out fear amen now the Bible tells us that the same God of love is also a consuming fire and I just try to bring a balance to this that the god that did create us he created us for himself he did not create us so we could do whatever we wanted to do amen the Bible says that vengeance is mine sayith the Lord Vengeance belongs to God Amen and that we all have to give an account to God one day right the Bible says every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ really is God Jesus said in John 1248 he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words have one that judgeth him the word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day so look th this does bring about I need to be paying attention Amen to God Amen now if we don't yield our life we don't yield the life that God has given us back to God here on this Earth then we're going to end up in the same place the devil goes that's right amen that that that just that's just saying like we're all heading to Hell amen unless we get saved and we know that hell was created for the devil and his angels right but remember every seed brings forth of its own kind amen and if we choose to disbelieve like the devil's disbelieve or we choose to believe only like the devil's believe then we end up in the same place Jesus said in Matthew 10:27 what I tell you in darkness that speak in light what you hear in the air that preach ye on the housetops and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him that is able to destroy both soul and Body in Hell amen now the creator of all life is the god of of love yet his eyes the Bible tells us are as a flame of fire his feet as unto fine brass that burned in a furnace and his voice is as the sound of many Waters and out of his mouth went a two-edged sword so we do know that God is a God of Justice he's a god of Truth there is only one right there is not Mayes right it's right or wrong amen the devil wants us to make Mayes the devil wants us to question well maybe I shouldn't be a boy maybe I shouldn't be a girl maybe I should cut my hair maybe I that is just the devil that you can't find that in the word if you really want to know who God is read the Bible the word you'll know exactly who God God is amen 2 Corinthians 5:10 says for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ yes that every one of you may receive the things done in his body according to it to that he have done whether it be good or bad knowing therefore look at this the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto God and I trust also are made manif EST in your conscience so there is a part of God that's real but it isn't like the terror that we would like see you know if we watched a horror film God is not like that what that really means is God is real there is a realness to God and that we didn't create our bodies I don't I don't I don't want to be you know maybe our mom and dad got together and they had sex but I'll tell you Life comes from God Amen that's right amen right amen and we we we're not going to give account to Mom and Dad on the other side we're going to give account to God and and that's what we must remember as we think about the fear of the Lord today Hebrews 12:2 8 says wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably and how do you serve him acceptably you got to have reverence and you got to have Godly fear yes for our God is a consuming fire he he you know brother brandham taught us about church order yeah and how things need to be you know we have these ideas that we can just act any old way want nothing really matters well yes it does matter it may not matter to you and it may not matter to the devil who's speaking to you but it does matter amen amen I've seen Believers serve God with all sorts of ungodly attitudes not caring what they say or who they say it to condemning judging falsely accusing others walking to church hoty arrogant he highminded proud boasting about things amen unthankful don't want to worship don't want to pray lovers of their own selves unthankful upset mad Fierce unruly uncaring without reverence and without respect to the word of God amen amen true operating under the spirit of torment and don't even know it getting up during the preaching of the word of God and think it doesn't bring a disrespect to God Amen it only proves that you're you think you're listening to some man when yet God is trying to speak to you he chose the foolishness of preaching to speak to us Believers getting satisfied with just a form of godliness but the life denies the power of the Holy Ghost living the word out we've got to grow up in the word we've got to start manifesting this this word and we're running out of time teach us Lord to number our days it is what brings the fear of the Lord to our lives the Bri said in the message influence he says you've got to give your all to God right your reverence your respect your everything that you are just be nothing amen just see how little you are and that's what God wants us to do and that's real humility that's the way the seraphim are in his presence you see with their faces in reverence covered their feet in humility I say we must serve God acceptably amen with more reverence with more Godly fear right amen we need to stop listening to the devil and thinking that we're okay because there's somebody a little bit worse than us amen I'll tell you what that means with reverence in Godly fear it means with caution it means with modesty and it means with shamefacedness you know nowadays you can't find a a sister or a brother who feels that way I'm sorry amen but it's so true everybody uh it just seems that God isn't that real to people I see when you I'll tell you what caught my attention when I was in uh brother Johnson church and I was very young in the Lord very young person coming out of a a Catholic church we had to focus more on just the things that they told you to do not even knowing a relationship with God and just spending a few services in brother Johnson's church and seeing a sister her love life of how she conducted herself brought such a Renown uh identification of the realness of God manifested never said a word there was no preaching but the life that she lived I said there has to be something about this praise the Lord I believe we need to be an all of God Amen to live that kind life but not just of God but understand of his word we can all say oh yeah I'm an awe at God look at that Sunset look at that mountain look at that water look at those animals God is awesome but can we look at the word of God the message of the hour and be in all amen because that is that's what we that's what this is God amen amen that is God's creation the Bible talks about those that worship the creation more than the Creator it was this word that created those mountains and those animals in that sea we need to be in awe of obeying the word in everything that we're doing presently presently it's really important the fear of God wants us to have the fear that is generated from him not the devil B said the message sin of unbelief he said that there's only two spirits that control a man and you think and man can literally think that he's not controlled by either but he's in control himself that's how deceptive the devil is he said there's only two spirits that control man they're either his faith or unbelief and each of us tonight is possessed with one or the other of those Spirits amen now we know faith comes from God it's a faith that worketh by love right he created everything through faith amen and fear and unbelief come from the Devil Satan perverts everything through unbelief Jesus said in Revelations 218 I just going to quote it the fear and the unbelieving shall have their part in the Lake of Fire which uh uh with the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death so the fearful and the unbelieving same place because it's the same Spirit motivated by the fear of the devil torment you you see all these people you know no fear their hats are on and you know they're just whistling the graveyard they're getting their mind on something else but as long as I don't have to think about what's going to happen that I got a give an account I can just do what I want be what I want act how I want I believe God is ashamed of us sometimes the way we act amen amen amen and then we just keep going on and thinking that it's okay it's not okay the bride will come under subjection to the word but the foolish virgin will not amen amen God hasn't sent us here to minister a good message to the foolish virgin amen I don't believe that amen it's not my calling we got to straighten up amen start fearing the Lord more don't act like well we're okay I'm just going to prove how you know what are you doing how can you stand in the presence of God with that demeanor am that's right it shows that you're not walking in his presence just because you're trying to act like something the fear of the Lord the fear that God wants us to have is reverence and respect that is generated from him what do you mean is generated from him what do you mean by that hey just read in the book of Isaiah when Isaiah went into the temple he didn't see a bunch of carrying on God's presence demand Ed respect am and all the Heavenly Host was reverencing God Almighty amen and when we're not in that that frame we need to get there amen fear God and keep his Commandments yes in other words reverence God and respect his word for it is the whole duty of man amen the whole Duty well I want to do other things well that's fine but it's the whole Duty amen that's what we've been created for right that's right we don't want to just stand for the reading of the word we want to stand for the manifestation of the word amen amen the whole duty of man our whole duty is to reverence God to respect him enough to stay within the guidelines of this book you want to read other books that's fine you want to listen to other things that's fine but make sure that it it's in the guidelines of this book amen amen because if you're if it's not Vanity Vanity all is Vanity amen now how many can say that you have said a lot of bad things in your life because you you weren't reverencing God Amen who does not want to participate in this how many can say that you've actually did a lot of bad things all because you weren't reverencing God Amen a lot now this is when you were born this is your birth this is you know you go into a cemetery and you see two dates right the birth the death or born died so every one of us has this no we have a hope in a rap that would be this date okay amen we don't know when the Lord's coming we thought he'd be here before now if I was to ask brother Johnson brother Johnson when did you think the Lord was coming I'm sure he would not be thinking it would be today it would have been much sooner than today now here is you and I this is where we're at that's right so you just told me that you've done and said a lot of things in this area right here that you did the same reason I did because we were lacking the fear of the Lord amen now we don't know how much longer we got just because you're younger than me doesn't mean you've got a lot more time than me that's true I was a middle child I had one one of my brothers die after three hours or three days one of the two and I'm sorry that I don't know but just bringing a point and I had one brother who was older than me that left this Earth before I did we don't know how much time we got I do know this that there's not a thing that you can do about your past not a thing that's what the blood of Jesus Christ is for thank God for the blood you have no promise of the future so when I talk to you this morning about the fear of God I'm talking about one thing I'm talking about where you are in your present state right this moment because that's all that matters where your mind is at your thoughts are at your intents you're at amen you fear the lord right now the only thing we can do is reverence him in the present tense amen if we learn to reverence him in our present tense that will bring about a faithful walk a faithful life When We Fear and respect When We Fear God we respect his word in all of our conversations and all of our situations that is when we grow and prosper in the things of God too often carnal Christians get caught up in the drama of only respecting those who they feel are worthy of their respect amen amen as if they're God over the word that's no different than being an unbeliever it isn't amen the Bible doesn't tell us to only respect certain people amen amen in fact I believe the Bible says under all men especially those of the household of faith I think we don't got time but if you read the I believe it's the either in Peter or Jude the Bible talks about uh these these people they just talk uh uh so arrogantly about uh Authority and and about governments and about other people when the Bible says that even the angels right would not bring an acquisation against them who were wrong to the Lord amen because they feared the actual judging somebody the actual uh bringing the truth which was not according to the word of God to God but yet we find it it's okay to say negative things feel Justified well this is where I stand well that's fine where you stand but why don't you stand where the word wants you to stand stand with the fear of God stand you got angels as your example amen well brother John we're living in a different time I'll tell you when this time is all over you'll see what the real time was all along respect and reverence for all of God's word opens the door for wisdom yes Proverbs 9:10 says that the fear of the Lord this fear here the conclusion of the whole matter fear God keep his Commandments the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom right and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding amen If any man likes wisdom let him ask of God who giveth liberally that's but I'll tell you what you're going to have to have the fear of the Lord if you're going to get it amen if we want true wisdom of God it starts with reverence and respect to his word more than what we're doing you want more wisdom respect the word more well brother John I respect the word and and I just you know I'm offended that you would say that I don't respect the word I'm offended that you think you are exactly what the word wants you to be look if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves then I will hear from God it's not about do you belong to God not belong to God it isn't about you you you do not have wisdom or you do not fear the lord sure you do but look we can't even live our life to this point and be so happy about it amen amen why not hear the message this morning amen how many wants more wisdom amen the fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom Proverbs 16:16 says how much much better is it to get wisdom than to actually get gold and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver Proverbs 4:5 get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline thine uh decline from the words of my mouth so get wisdom get understanding forsake her not and she shall preserve thee forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee right amen wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding amen exalt her and she shall promote thee she shall bring thee honor when thou Dost Embrace her amen too often we think we have wisdom and how we're going to handle something but we end up handling it carnally because what we're actually using is carnal worldly wisdom to handle our problems if we're going after Godly wisdom we're going after the nature of God in demonstration right you've got the knowledge of God and the wisdom of God and the wisdom of God puts it in demonstration it is the actual manifestation of what to do come on it shouldn't be so quiet here amen let's look at James 3 verse 13 who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with look at this meekness of wisdom so often we use wisdom but you know what comes with it yelling at some somebody getting angry at somebody come on just just love the word love the word you don't have to love me love the word but if you have bitter envy and strife in Your Heart Right amen glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but it's Earthly it's Central it's devilish for when for where envy and in Strife is there is confusion and what else every every evil work amen that's why I hate confusion amen amen I hate the the very thing it tries to pop his head up there is no fear of the Lord when we're carnally in our flesh I love verse 17 but the wisdom that is from above its first pure in other words that's not mixed with our ideas of what we're trying to accomplish our bad motives and what we want to see happen it's just totally 100% God it is pure God no partiality it's then Peaceable it's gentle it's easy to be in treated it's full of Mercy it's full of good fruits it's without partiality and without hypocrisy and I want to ask you the last times that you deal you've dealt with things not back here but here which one of these did you use look at the fear of the Lord is the beginning beginning of what we just read amen amen I could be wrong I don't want to hurt I don't want to stumble but I know I need to make this thing right I need to I need God has called me to be a peacemaker God has called me to to intervene God has called me to stand in the God God has called me to help my Fallen brother and sister God has called me God's good but I need to do it in the guidelines of the wisdom of God Amen so instead of just trying to oh I got to figure this out what you need to say is I need to fear God I need to fear God because it is the beginning of wisdom we can't even get to where we want to get to without the fear of God Amen too often we're just I'm going to show somebody they're wrong I'm going to prove I'm going to I'm going to let them know hey look people can feel if they don't get it right that second it won't be long until God shows them what spirit that was and the fruit of righteousness is sown in what peace of them that make peace right amen amen you know we can make wrath we can make turmoil we can make division we can so Discord we can got we got the power to do that if we're listening to a devil that's trying to tell us to be selfish but we also got power to bring two brothers together to bring two sisters together to make to make peace amen why because he is our peace and the Prince of Peace lives in US amen and when we yield to that you to him the fear the lord he always wants there he wants us to walk in peace I'm just going to say this the think that God does not want us to always be in peace is to say that God does not always want peace with you his very motive is that we walk in harmony with him why wouldn't his motive be for us to walk in harmony with one another in fact he's he's more for that than he is of your relationship with him brother John that's a strong statement what Jesus himself said if you come here to The Altar and offer me a gift whatever gift it is just leave it here go back and make sure things are right between you your brother and your sister amen make sure there's peace there and then when that's taken care of then you come here and give me your best but you're not giving me your best when there's something that should be made right right between a brother and sister that's right brother amen am that's good if you want the wisdom of God it will start with reverencing and respecting what the word instructs us to do with our present situations you know too often we just think well this is uh I I come to church and this is between me and God and then when I'm dealing with this person it's between me and them God needs to be the God of all of our life amen so I say I don't care what situation you're in I don't care if it has to do with with neighbors with people with family with with church members whatever your situation is if you are more reverent to what this word says God I want to do exactly what you want if it takes the height off of me God will give you wisdom to take care of it now if you don't care about taking care of it like you could care less well what you're saying is I could care less about my relationship with God I know that's strong but look I'm just going to say it like it is brother I just read a quote uh yesterday I believe it was where brother brandom saw the the these this couple they were walking to church and this woman she had a cigarette she was puffing it out like a train and she was on her way going to church and brother Brandon was there there is a a speaker and he was going to be speaking he said oh my God Lord You've you've you've called us to be ministers and to help your people and and this is this is what's coming and they don't he said they don't want to listen to me that's what he said they don't want to listen to me and brother and God just whispered a little word to brother Bram and said well if you're ashamed to speak my word to them if you're afraid to speak that word to them you're ashamed of me to seek to please men you're not a servant of his you know I do believe that we need to say it like it is amen do am and not not even behind the pulpit but we need to use meekness and love love is corrective well you know what hate traits are correct too hey the wisdom of this world tries to correct too well you shouldn't have done that and you shouldn't well how many times we've had a fight with our spouse trying to prove what's right here the conclusion of the whole matter I don't care what the fight is I don't care what it's about the conclusion of the whole matter is to fear God and keep his Commandments amen that's the conclusion amen proving who's right or who's wrong isn't doesn't mean anything amen Jesus said in Matthew 25:40 verily I say unto you in so much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me wow do you actually mean Lord that when I got upset and I just so angry in my thoughts and I just want to tell them like it was that I was actually doing that to you Lord amen that's exactly what that means but why we don't think of it is because we are not walking in the fear of the Lord we're not reverencing the word we got so religious spirit that thinks they got something special with God this fear of the Lord is not a gift it's not that's not something you can put on either times if we're not careful we can think ill of others and feel Justified about it how we think about someone talk about someone treat someone is the same way that we're doing towards God Amen wow you ever know if this has ever happened to her you ever start have somebody just testified this to me that I can witness of the same thing you're having you get a thought a negative thought afflicting thought of the devil something negative about somebody and if you yield to that thing and you say that's true and then something happens immediately has anybody ever experienced that immediately something happens I believe our thoughts speak louder in heaven than our words do unearth amen our thoughts how many times we hear the prophet say God knows exactly what you're thinking it's real this fear of the Lord is a real thing we we you know we're not coming to church to try to get some knowledge we need to get we need to better a relationship God doesn't like it when we don't respect one another amen our whole duty is to reverence God respect him enough to stay in the guidelines of the word so if the word says to respect one another to to love one another to honor one another to pray for one another to to Bear the infirmities of the weak then we respect that word and we start putting into action we don't say well you know I don't feel the leading of the Lord you know what it's because you don't have the fear of the Lord you get more of the fear of the Lord you'll feel led to do a lot more things in you're doing you know I may not know how to preach but I sure feel them I sure feel them this morning amen amen look at Mary she was the oldest sister of Moses she was probably used to help rescue Moses when he was in the N River no doubt believed in the calling of Moses yet she made fun of Moses's wife because she was in Ethiopian and you know what something negative happened to her body because she did that amen I'm sorry just don't talk negative about people you don't know what's going to happen amen am Bram send the message respects he said God demands respect right God sends his message you listen to it you reverence it I don't care what they call you a bunch of holy roles or whatever they call you let the world do what they want to but you give God respect amen don't make fun of people I don't think God's going to just sit by Idol and let you be disrespectful I'll tell you I I I want my life to prosper a lot more than it is and I don't mean financially because I don't look at myself as very Financial because whatever I get I give stay away from that stay away from it just give what God gives you amen amen but I want my life to bring him more honor and glory amen it it can't happen unless I reverence the word more right it ain't about what I know it's about what I live that's right and it it it's it's about what we live at all times not just in front of one another the Bible says that God is able to make all grace abound unto us yes yes amen you want God to do more give more amen I've been serve him the best I can would just get honest get more honest with get in prayer and just say God have I had the wrong thoughts have I said the wrong things if I have I had negativity in my mind because that is not the fear of the Lord that's being overtaken by the fear of the devil and not even know it right amen God demands respect at all times a lot of times people struggle on their life because they have a lack of respect and don't even know it Bible says when all thy ways please the Lord he'll make even thy enemies to be at peace with you you still got enemies but they're at peace with you they're at peace amen God demands respect at all times to his word you believe that revelation 22:18 says for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the Bible the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto the things to these things God shall add unto him the plagues notice that the plagues that are written in this book notice every time in the Old Testament that the Israel got out of the will of God what happened to them God pled them with their enemy but who's our enemy you know we think well that's the Old Testament God's in the new I'm telling you every time we get out of line if we are not willing to take heed to the word when it says get back in line trust me God will find a way to get your attention amen and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book in other words don't add don't take away God demands respect for the word or for his word amen and I don't feel as if I could say it like this my precious brothers and sisters I don't feel like we in our heart need to look at God and say God I I I I I want to fear you more respect you more reverence you more I don't think we're missing it there what we're missing it is is we don't think he's attached to this word enough right that's where I think we're really missing it we're not taking the word seriously when we say something about somebody you know the love of God think it's no evil we think evil and it's like not a bad big big deal we're not reverencing his word the our thought process with God our our our intent with God I mean that we yes I I reverence God but we're not taking this seriously and you can't separate God and the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God they are the same and the bride is getting dressed to become the she is becoming the Manifest Ed word yes not the quoter of the word amen the manifestation of the word amen not I know more than you look at me unpopular no that spirit is out there thank God it's not here it's out there it's really out there it's what can I do to please you Lord presently right now what can I do right now to please you it takes the fear of the Lord to make sure you know every man here's the thing the Fe our nature is I'm right my own eyes don't you tell me and the fear of the Lord is just the opposite I could be wrong so these things do these two things are are are button heads brother BR say you got a white dog and a back black dog who is winning right amen you feed the white dog you're going to want to please him when the doors are closed if you feed in your flesh It all becomes a religion like a bark on the tree amen amen God demands respect at all times don't expect to just watch your way into the church with any old attitude and expect something from God Amen yes yes God dwells in humility God helps those that are humble he rewards The Humble but those that are proud and arrogant he will resist think about God's Prophet Moses take your shoes off you're standing on Holy Ground brother R said well you know usually what we do is we take off our hat down here didn't say hat didn't say take your jacket off take your shoes off whatever God says do it best advice that his mother gave to everybody said Mary what do we do whatever he sayth do it that's right amen do what the word says because if he's telling you to do something this right here is Holy Ground this is Holy Ground and if his word says love covers a multitude of sin then you better start covering yes don't take somebody's don't take the veil off somebody's sin don't you do that Satan is the accuser of the Brethren that's Unholy ground that's the that is you know that's the fear that comes from torment amen if you can't love somebody to keep it covered you're standing on Unholy ground amen I know this is strong but I tell you we need a cleanup don't we now too often Believers miss being blessed when they come to church because they just view this place as a a stone building that may be true it is a stone building like all other buildings but the secret here is it has been dedicated to God now when I mean that I don't mean we had a dedication service what I mean is each and every day when our thoughts go to this place at least mine it is a place that's been dedicated to God and God Honors that God Honors that you can walk into some places and feel so out of place so like I got to get out of here and you can walk into some places and feel the love of God that's right I believe God honors the place that he promised to be amen look at Israel every time the children of Israel murmured and complained they actually disrespected God what happens to us when we murmur and complaint it's okay God knows God sees God believes he's you know you know he's a you know we we begin to make this this truth this this religion this church this this message like some sort of uh uh Republican Democratic belief system in other words you're on one side and the other person is on another side and unless they believe with you they're off and what we need to do is realize that we're all off and the only thing that is on is the word amen and stop acting like we're a politician about the Bible it just doesn't matter live the word live the word lay down your life love amen because that's all that's going to matter it is the whole duty of man to fear God and to keep his Commandments amen do all things without murmurings and disputings that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom you shine as lights in the world Israel feared the Giants they had these tormenting thoughts afflicting thoughts they were much bigger than than them and it began to they accepted them because they said we are like grasshoppers in our own sight to them and these very thoughts began to manipulate their feelings to where they felt scared they felt anxiety they felt overwhelming feelings and you know what they did they began to lash out against the authority of the word exactly what they did but we should have we should have we should have never left Egypt we should go back we should get a different Captain we should get someone who believes the way that we believe right Joshua and Caleb because they didn't yield to those AFF thoughts now just be honest with you they had the same thought come to them don't think the devil didn't give them any thoughts the devil did the problem is they resisted the thought therefore they never went into that feelings of in overwhelming I can't do this I'm suffering no the bigger they are the harder they fall their attitude was different it all stems with the thought that you accept as soon as you accept it then you got to sit there and you got to battle you got to think how am I going to overcome this situation how how am I going to think my way through before you know you're trying to use the worldly wisdom and I'm going to do this I'm I'm not going to shake that person's hand I'm not going to talk to the and before you're not you're walking carnally and you think God is with you but he's noten because you crossed the word a long time ago look there's a reason we feel the way we do in our past and if it's ever going to change it's got to change right now by fearing God more now amen now look at vasy she had it all sold up she was already identified as the queen of the king she was already the bride amen right message came to her she was bride but she started acting Hy y amen you know brother John I don't mean to wrong but I've seen ministers at Cy I don't get it brothers sisters that been in the message a while hoty amen arrogant amen I'm bride ashy I'm bride I can do this I can do that she was missing an important ingredient you know what that is don't you the fear of the Lord that's right she didn't fear the king that's right he didn't and the King had to put her away because he wasn't the example of the King right and who did he choose he chose someone that wasn't if I could say it like this acted like some Queen on the throne you've heard of the queen on the throne no reverence respect if it be pleasing in thy sight she waited she approached the right way the throne she waited till she was called on before she asked and when she asked she didn't ask for herself she was always asking for somebody else she was interceding for somebody else she knew her position up to half of the Kingdom but she never took it that's right amen look if I can just be next to him I can be his bride that's all I want amen she had the fear of the Lord I'll tell you Saints we've got so many examples in this Bible because obviously time is up get into the word and look for the examples of the fear of the Lord and if it's in your heart that you want to grow closer to God you'll never do it without the fear of God so seek the fear of the Lord am too many people get all this knowledge and all these Mysteries and they feel well I've got something you you know you got people that that come come to a message church and you know what their real motive is they're looking for something new I'm going to tell you something about that spirit so was Eve she was looking for something new she lusted for knowledge look the only thing I'm looking for new is to be able to live something I'm not living right now that's the new thing I'm looking for because that's what God's looking for I may be looking for you know you can have all knowledge still miss it wouldn't gain anything the Bible says but to love God to have his love to where you want to stay in the framework of the word that's what really matters amen oh my my you know there's a lot of examples just in the brother brandom's Ministry in the Bible in the ministry Abraham he lied in one sense we could say God said I don't care if he lied or not you better you better go ask him for forgiveness and have him pray over you God demands respect there's a woman that said I wouldn't give I wouldn't give your religion to my cow what happened to her we need to respect this message we need to respect this word we need to respect God one time brother Brandon was testifying to his sister about God's creative power and sister hady Wright said that's nothing but the truth you know God loves respect to his word he does the holy spirit said you just say the Holy Spirit told me whatever you say you can have brother Brandon said uh in the in in the message my new ministry and she said brother Bill my greatest desire is for the Salvation of my two boys there couldn't have been any greater thing she could ask for $10,000 she would have got it what if she would have been some millionaire she would have asked for another million God known exactly what she was going to ask for right yes I believe the whole Holy Ghost says Amen to every word of God don't you amen amen let's Stand Together wherefore let's serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear brother baham said in the message a true sign overlooked he said we should be so close together brother that we just we'd be more than real brothers and sisters that's the love that we ought to have in our hearts for one another Reverend respect the highest and I like that I like the real thing did you know the Bible said that the fear of the Lord is clean it's what cleaned you up I could be wrong okay let's get this thing right let the meditation of my heart amen amen and the words that I speak yes let them be acceptable unto thee is that your desire let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments amen for this is the whole duty of man last quote brother brand says the statute of perfect man he said let's add to our faith these things then we might come into the whole statue of Christ being joined together with Godly love the fear of God reverence in our hearts one towards another deep respect to one another brother and sister kindliness never vulgarity nothing but the purity of the Holy Spirit I'm I I am so sorry I got one more quote can you just stand a little bit this is important I'm just because it's just describing the fear of God in a greater measure brother Brandon said in the message respects he's quoting the scripture let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for it is for this is the full duty of man the conclusion of the whole matter is to fear God and when you canot have respect and when you cannot have respect until you have fear you cannot have the fear of God Solomon said in Proverbs that the fear of God is to begin the wisdom no that don't mean that you're not afraid of him but that means that you're given respect and reverence and when you respect God you fear God you fear that you might displease him in some way you fear lest you would do something wrong you wouldn't want to do that he said I fear my mother I fear my wife I fear my church I fear all of God's servants unless I should put a stumbling block somewhere in their way I fear the people I fear people of the city unless I should do something wrong and would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian you see amen you've got before you can have respect you've got to have fear and God demands it he demands respect God does he demands it and fear brings it and we know that fear brings respect respect I love that quote isn't that beautiful amen let's sing that little chorus teach us to number our days amen teach us to number our days oh teach us to number our days we don't got many left we we may apply our hearts on to wisdom Lord teach us to number our day oh teach us to number our day teach us to number our [Music] day that we may May apply our hearts on to wisdom Lord teach us to number our days one more time teach us to number our day oh teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts on to wisdom Lord teach us to number our days amen why why why why did David say that I believe he wanted to be the best pleasing that he could to God Amen let's sing that pleasing just Express back to God now what he has spoken to and I trust that God has spoken spoken to you something that would just help you with your relationship with him amen pleasing let me be pleasing to you let everything that I do be pleasing to you praise let everything I pursue be pleasing oh Lord unto you isn't that beautiful so beautiful pleas let me be pleasing to you let everything that I do be pleasing to you I'm praying let everything I pursue be pleasing oh Lord unto [Music] you oh please [Music] let me be pleasing to you let everything that I do be pleasing to you praying let everything I pursue de please no Lord unto you amen I I believe that's all of our desires I really do amen let's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer with every eye closed if there was just one thing that you could receive from the Lord just one thing outside of the Holy Ghost now just one thing that you could receive from the Lord I just have this question would you ask for the fear of the Lord in that is all now your efforts and ability to do what he wants wants us to do of course we need the help of God to do it we need the Holy Ghost to live this life but I believe the fear of the Lord really stems from our attitude and brother Brandon just said the right mental attitude can bring any promise of God to pass and I believe promises include helping our current situations when we're dealing with people and things so if that's your desire I want you to hold it before the Lord and perhaps you be here today and you have a different desire you want to be remembered and prayer just lift up your handen God sees those desires praise the Lord praise the Lord amen let's let's believe as we look to him Heavenly Father Lord we're unworthy to even approach your throne though Thy word says to come to thee what boldness Lord unless the shedding of blood is upon us Lord we cannot come boldly but Lord we come today with your blood knowing knowing the nature of our life has not always been with the fear of the Lord haven't taken you serious always just having sometimes presumptuous that you're with us forgive us of presumptuously thinking things Lord God we're here your people Lord we want to make it in the Rapture yes amen Lord we know it's an individual you deal with us as individuals and we can't tell you to choose us we can't tell you to choose somebody else you're the one that chooses the bride Lord we're not asking that you change your word for us we're not asking that you would change your standard for us we're not a asking Lord that you would kind of do the choosing on a grading on a scale because we've all come short of your glory we're not asking that but what we're asking Lord for is that we might reverence and respect you more that we might think on this one scripture what our whole duty is as your children to remember that there's always one Spirit of how we might handle every situation the correct way way God we pray that you would bring your word from cover to cover the Forefront of our heart and our mind when we enter into situations that Lord we really truly need wisdom amen May the fear of God rise up inside of us and say Lord have thine own way inside of me May it come to the Forefront Lord the very beginning of wisdom that we need for this situation may it start off with Lord I want to please you I pray that you would bless Every Soul here every soul that's listening that's praying this very moment on the live stream God may you give them the very desires of their heart to please you because I know that you are standing 100% behind that Lord there's these others that also raised their hand Lord because you spoke to them you spoke to them through the word Lord and they have a a request and Lord I am uniting with each and every one of them I may not know what those things are but your word declares if we would just agree by faith touching the throne Lord that you would establish it I pray that you'd give the desire of their heart give them the desire of their heart Lord Father for they resp respect you they reverence you Lord may you give it to them as you gave Esther because Lord they are your bride they are the ones that you've you Lord I could say it like this you blinded Israel for this for us lord lord for us standing here and your bride around the world we're so grateful that you gave us an opportunity Unity Lord but then you also taught us to fear to fear because if you did that to the Natural tree how much more could you do that to that which was grafted in so Lord May when we leave here our lives begin to change more into your image because we're choosing the fear of the Lord we're choosing your way your word for our lives make us more like thee we commit ourself to you We Believe Lord in you in us manifesting more we give you the praise we give you honor we glorify you Lord we will thank you throughout today we will thank you in the days to come we will come rejoicing to your house Lord knowing Lord that you have something for each and every one of us in the preci
