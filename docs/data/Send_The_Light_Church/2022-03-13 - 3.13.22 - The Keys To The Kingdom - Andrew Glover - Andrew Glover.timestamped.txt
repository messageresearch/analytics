[37:58] i know it's a very familiar reading
[38:02] matthew 16 and verse 13
[38:04] and just before we wreak we just bow our
[38:06] heads together for word of prayer
[38:09] let's speak to the author of the word
[38:10] heavenly father
[38:12] lord your word is true this morning
[38:15] and father we are believers in your word
[38:18] lord we know that your word will defeat
[38:19] the devil anywhere any place anytime
[38:23] under any conditions
[38:25] lord this morning it's cold on the
[38:27] outside but father
[38:30] lord there's a warmth of the presence of
[38:32] god in this building today
[38:34] now father i ask you to come may you
[38:36] take control of my voice may you take
[38:38] control of my thoughts
[38:40] lord may you not only anoint me to speak
[38:42] father but lord may you anoint your
[38:45] children to pull and to receive also
[38:47] from the gift lord
[38:49] lord may you heal our sick today god
[38:51] may you save our lost father may you
[38:54] feel with your holy spirit may you bind
[38:57] the hand of satan this morning
[38:59] father may revelation come up out of
[39:01] your word into the hearts and lives of
[39:03] your children lord
[39:05] lord may vessels that are empty be
[39:06] filled today dear god lord may we be
[39:10] made meat for your service lord may we
[39:12] be changed by your presence may you
[39:14] bless this assembly father lord may you
[39:17] come in the power of your resurrection
[39:19] today god open the eyes of our
[39:21] understanding lord and we'll be sure to
[39:23] give you all the praise all the honor
[39:26] and all the glory for to the wonderful
[39:28] name of our lord and savior jesus christ
[39:30] we pray and all the believers says
[39:34] amen and amen matthew 16
[39:37] and verse number 13 the bible here says
[39:40] when jesus came into the coast of
[39:42] caesarea philippi
[39:44] he asked his disciples saying
[39:47] whom do men say that i
[39:49] the son of man am
[39:51] and they said unto him some say thou art
[39:54] john the baptist and some elias and
[39:56] sothers jeremias were one of the
[39:58] prophets now he was not looking for a
[40:00] universal understanding he was looking
[40:02] for an individual confession
[40:05] he said
[40:06] some say thou are alas some say jeremiah
[40:08] is from the prophets but he said unto
[40:10] them whom say ye that i am.
[40:13] and simon peter answered and said
[40:16] thou art the christ the son of the
[40:19] living god
[40:20] and jesus answered and said unto him
[40:22] blessed art thou simon bar jonah for
[40:25] flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[40:28] unto thee
[40:29] but my father which is in heaven and i
[40:32] say also unto thee
[40:34] that thou art peter and upon this rock i
[40:37] will build my church and the gates of
[40:39] hell shall not prevail against it said
[40:41] that's a paradox
[40:43] he said that the gates of hell would be
[40:44] against the church but they would not
[40:46] prevail over the church
[40:48] i love verse 19 and i
[40:51] will give unto thee the keys to the
[40:53] kingdom of heaven
[40:55] and whatsoever thou shall bind on earth
[40:57] shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou
[40:59] shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
[41:02] heaven then charged he his disciples
[41:05] that they should tell no man
[41:07] that he was jesus the christ
[41:10] amen we asked the lord this morning to
[41:12] add the blessing to the reading of his
[41:13] word as you can be seated here this
[41:15] morning
[41:16] from those passages of scripture for
[41:18] just a few moments if the lord would
[41:20] help us today
[41:22] i want to
[41:23] speak to you if i titled this sermon
[41:25] today i want to speak to you on the keys
[41:27] to the kingdom the keys to the kingdom i
[41:30] was recently studying the book of john
[41:32] the third chapter which we all know that
[41:34] verse 16 that god so loved the world
[41:37] that he gave his only begotten son that
[41:39] whosoever should believe in him should
[41:40] not perish but have everlasting life and
[41:43] i found that jesus christ was god's gift
[41:46] to the world if you could recognize amen
[41:49] that christ is the gift to the world
[41:51] then you'll recognize that there's other
[41:53] gifts that christ has given the church
[41:55] that are part of himself like in matthew
[41:56] 11 he'll say i give unto thee arrest in
[41:59] matthew 16 hear he's speaking i will
[42:02] give unto thee the keys and i just want
[42:03] this morning to minister to you on the
[42:06] keys to the kingdom of heaven we realize
[42:08] that the bible will speak of the word
[42:10] key or the word keys about eight times
[42:13] you'll hear it said like this the key of
[42:14] david the key of knowledge the key to
[42:17] the bottomless pit he'll speak of the
[42:18] keys to the kingdom of heaven then
[42:20] you'll
[42:21] read about uh the keys of hell and death
[42:23] now when you hear this word key you
[42:26] automatically think what is the purpose
[42:27] of a key the prophet problem god says in
[42:29] the key to the door he says a purpose of
[42:32] a key is to unlock something it's
[42:34] something that's been locked up or it's
[42:36] something that should be locked up he
[42:39] said now there are there are many kinds
[42:40] of keys because we have many uses of
[42:43] keys there's a key to your storehouse
[42:45] there's a key to your own house there's
[42:47] a key to your automobile he said and we
[42:49] call them keys amen because they are
[42:52] keys there's a key to your house key to
[42:54] your storehouse key to your automobile
[42:56] there's all different kinds of keys and
[42:58] we call them keys because they are keys
[43:00] now we realize that there are many kinds
[43:02] of keys and there are skeleton keys they
[43:05] meant off of the original key but the
[43:07] prophet of god said that god amen has no
[43:10] skeleton key so a denominational key
[43:12] will not unlock the revelation of the
[43:15] word to the believer in the book of
[43:16] deuteronomy the 16th chapter in the
[43:19] sixth verse at the place which the lord
[43:21] god shall choose to place his name in
[43:23] there thou shalt sacrifice amen the
[43:25] passover evening at the going down of
[43:27] the sun at the season that thou came us
[43:30] forth out of egypt now i read this verse
[43:32] last night but i want to pull apart out
[43:33] of this at the place which the lord thy
[43:36] god shall choose to place his name in so
[43:39] you're not going to choose amen the
[43:41] place that god is going to place his
[43:43] name rather he's going to choose that
[43:44] place if you'll just watch he says and
[43:47] follow god's direction there's only one
[43:49] key to each door
[43:52] there's only one key to each door and no
[43:54] other key no matter how much it looks
[43:56] like it god has no skeleton key he's
[44:00] just got one key now you've got to have
[44:02] that key or the door won't unlock no
[44:04] matter how sincere you are you still
[44:07] can't unlock that door so here we're
[44:09] going to turn a corner and recognize
[44:11] amen that sincerity is not the key amen
[44:14] you can be very sincere amen but
[44:16] sincerity will not unlock the door he
[44:18] said david was anointed king anointed of
[44:21] god the greatest king israel ever had
[44:23] outside of the lord jesus which is god
[44:25] the anointed one jesus was david's son
[44:28] according to the lineage the flesh and
[44:30] he is to set on david's throne as one
[44:32] the prince always inherits the king's
[44:34] throne now notice that david being
[44:36] anointed yet with the anointing he did
[44:39] he got out of the will of the lord think
[44:41] about this david is anointed he's
[44:43] sincere yet he got out of the will of
[44:45] the lord and all the people amen not
[44:47] taking the run of the scripture or the
[44:49] key to this revelation all them anointed
[44:51] too they all got together shouting and
[44:54] praising god for the thing looked
[44:55] exactly right to bring the word of god
[44:58] back to the house of god but david was
[45:00] king not prophet see there was a prophet
[45:02] in the land to do it by and god
[45:05] dishonored the whole move because they
[45:07] never used the right key amen they were
[45:10] shouting they were rejoicing they were
[45:11] praising god they were sincere they had
[45:14] all the right intentions they had all
[45:15] the right motives they were trying to
[45:17] bring the word of god he went back to
[45:19] the house of god they were doing
[45:20] everything right except they bypassed
[45:23] they meant god's predestinated channel
[45:25] to bring the word by and that was a
[45:27] prophet and because they did that god
[45:29] dishonored the whole move amen because
[45:31] they did not use the right key he said
[45:34] see watch they didn't the door didn't
[45:36] unlock now we must remember that and
[45:37] keep that in mind every one of
[45:39] everything of god one certain way it's
[45:41] to be done and remember that amen that
[45:44] settles it god has one certain church
[45:46] that he meets the people in he will
[45:48] receive you in that church and no other
[45:50] church he said i've used this because
[45:52] many times i've been misunderstood
[45:54] people's told me are you a christian
[45:56] they'll say well i'm baptist are you a
[45:58] christian i'm a methodist they still say
[46:00] the same thing today amen are you a
[46:02] christian i'm a pentecostal he's been
[46:04] now see that doesn't mean one thing to
[46:07] god you're just broken with the wrong
[46:08] key amen so the name methodist is not
[46:11] the key the name baptist is not the key
[46:13] amen the name pentecostal is not the key
[46:16] amen the name of the lord jesus christ
[46:18] is the key he meant that there is a
[46:21] right key and god never promised to meet
[46:23] you as a baptist or a methodist or a
[46:25] pentecostal or no other denomination he
[46:27] don't even consider the denomination
[46:30] amen because they are against him he's
[46:32] been think about this then in matthew 16
[46:34] 19 when jesus would say i will give unto
[46:37] thee the keys to the kingdom of heaven
[46:40] and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[46:42] shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou
[46:44] shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
[46:46] heaven now this word key amen actually
[46:48] means he meant a king and since the
[46:50] keeper amen of the key has the power to
[46:53] open and shut think about this the
[46:55] keeper of the key has the power to open
[46:58] and the power to shut the word cleos
[47:00] there is figuratively used in the new
[47:03] testament he meant to denote power and
[47:05] authority of various kinds how many
[47:07] knows the prophet of god said we do not
[47:09] have the power amen we have the
[47:11] authority christ has the power amen see
[47:14] then christ has the power we have the
[47:16] authority amen to operate the power that
[47:19] christ has given us amen i find it a
[47:22] powerful quote in the message who is god
[47:24] he said joshua stop the son is that true
[47:27] and somebody said all things are
[47:28] possible with god nothing is impossible
[47:31] but all things are possible to you also
[47:34] amen so all things are not just possible
[47:36] to god or to the prophet or to the
[47:38] preacher amen but all things are
[47:40] possible to you also amen nothing is
[47:43] impossible to them that believe all
[47:46] things are possible brought right down
[47:47] and made you if you just know who god
[47:50] was so if you recognize who god was
[47:53] you'll realize who you are amen if you
[47:55] see who god he is you'll see who you are
[47:58] he said i'm afraid the church doesn't
[47:59] know the authority amen the authority
[48:02] i'm afraid the holy ghost born men amen
[48:04] don't realize their authority or the
[48:06] authority that god has permitted to his
[48:09] church i'll give unto you the keys of
[48:11] the kingdom whatever you find on earth
[48:13] shall be bound in heaven whatever you
[48:15] loose shall be loosed i will give you
[48:17] power over serpents over serpents i'll
[48:19] give you power over diseases and nothing
[48:21] shall harm you he says see exercise your
[48:24] faith let it loose amen i think it's
[48:27] time the church let our faith loose amen
[48:29] let god have his way and god will grant
[48:32] it to you if you will release your faith
[48:35] and god will release his desires and you
[48:38] amen if you will recognize his presence
[48:40] amen when you recognize his presence the
[48:42] prophet said you release his power do
[48:45] you realize the presence of god could be
[48:47] in this service this morning but if you
[48:49] don't recognize him amen then you'll
[48:51] leave here the way you came amen but if
[48:53] you recognize that he's the mighty god
[48:56] if you recognize that he has come down
[48:57] in this generation amen to make good
[49:00] every promise that he's made you then by
[49:02] your recognition you will release his
[49:04] power to fulfill your desires now let's
[49:06] just go the word you want to amen is
[49:08] that okay well can we go to the word
[49:10] amen let's go the word the bible says
[49:13] amen that there was a woman who made her
[49:15] way into the house of simon he met and
[49:17] there was jesus sitting in the corner
[49:19] right with dirty feet
[49:21] nobody had washed his feet nobody
[49:23] entertained him nobody had seen about
[49:25] him amen and brother said she walked in
[49:28] the house he said and there he sat with
[49:30] dirty feet he said and she recognized
[49:33] that that was jesus of nazareth she
[49:35] recognized that that was a man that
[49:37] could save her soul she recognized that
[49:39] was a man that could change her life and
[49:41] the prophet said she went over and she
[49:43] began to wash his feet he said now think
[49:45] about this she was washing his feet and
[49:48] there was religious people there amen
[49:50] that knew all the scriptures they knew
[49:52] all the cliches they knew everything
[49:54] about messiah amen and there he was in
[49:56] their midst and they failed
[49:58] oh god they failed to recognize who he
[50:00] was he said and they left in the same
[50:03] condition he said but one woman
[50:05] recognized that that's the one that the
[50:07] woman that was caught in the very act of
[50:08] adultery was stoned at his feet amen and
[50:11] he forgive our sins and he set her free
[50:13] oh friends this morning that same god is
[50:16] in the church he's in the building this
[50:18] morning he's here to manifest and make
[50:20] good his promises if we can only
[50:22] exercise our faith and recognize we have
[50:25] the authority by the word amen i find it
[50:28] amazing in the philadelphia in church
[50:29] age revelation 3 verse 8 he says i know
[50:32] thy works amen behold i have set before
[50:34] thee an open door and no man can shut it
[50:37] for thou hast a little strength and has
[50:40] kept my word thou hast a little strength
[50:43] and has kept my word i love this last
[50:45] part and has not denied my name amen can
[50:49] we say that together and has not denied
[50:52] my name amen the prophet said see he has
[50:54] got the keys to david now he can keep
[50:57] his word and put you into the kingdom
[51:00] he meant he his name had been revealed
[51:03] he meant they got out of the church that
[51:05] had a name that they were dead and now
[51:08] they got into a church that's got the
[51:10] name amen that is got life so when you
[51:12] get the name amen you get the life if
[51:15] there's no name there's no life amen but
[51:17] if there's a name then there's a life he
[51:20] said see they came out of the dead
[51:22] father son holy spirit amen name the
[51:24] father son holy spirit that don't even
[51:27] make sense see it's give therefore a
[51:29] revelation so matthew 28 19 amen was
[51:33] placed in the bible go ye in all the
[51:34] world baptize in the name of father son
[51:36] holy ghost the prophet says that was
[51:38] placed there for a revelation then where
[51:40] was the revelation coming of matthew 28
[51:43] 19 it will be found in acts 2 38 amen
[51:46] see his whole book is wrote on
[51:48] revelation that's what it is he reveals
[51:51] himself he said now go baptize the
[51:54] people in the name of the father son
[51:55] holy ghost amen matthew 28 19 now one of
[51:59] them names you're going to use which one
[52:01] are you going to use he said most of
[52:03] trinitarian people baptize the name of
[52:04] the father in the name of the son name
[52:06] of the holy ghost that's not even
[52:08] scriptural
[52:10] ask anybody it's in the name singular
[52:13] not names plural amen the name of the
[52:15] father and the son and the holy ghost
[52:17] all right father is not a name son is
[52:20] not a name amen holy ghost is not a name
[52:22] so what is it it's something that is
[52:25] dead come on now amen the name father is
[52:28] something that is dead he said see
[52:30] there's no name to it amen through those
[52:33] dead titles amen then that's why the
[52:35] churches are dead that's why they don't
[52:37] have a move of god that's why there's no
[52:38] power to cast out devils there's no
[52:40] power to heal the sick there's no power
[52:42] to raise the dead it's because they're
[52:44] under dead titles that has no authority
[52:47] or power listen friends you can say
[52:48] father all day long and the devil will
[52:50] stay right there you can say son all day
[52:53] long and the devil will stay right there
[52:55] but let a believer break out in the
[52:57] faith of jesus christ and breathe the
[52:59] name of jesus one time and every devil
[53:01] will begin to shake every demon will
[53:03] begin to back up come on friends we're
[53:05] not here under a bunch of dead titles we
[53:07] are the fully restored sons and
[53:09] daughters of god that believe in the
[53:11] name of the lord jesus christ i tell you
[53:13] what it's time to do it's time to speak
[53:15] the name it's time to speak the name of
[53:18] jesus it's time to breathe the name of
[53:20] jesus it's time to lift up the name of
[53:22] jesus we've lifted up every other name
[53:25] don't you think it's time to lift up the
[53:26] name that all power in heaven and earth
[53:29] amen has been poured into that name it's
[53:31] the name of the lord jesus christ i'm
[53:33] not talking about dead titles i'm
[53:35] talking about a living name
[53:38] amen the prophet god said like this you
[53:40] say well let me back up for a second and
[53:42] say well brother andrew i'm okay i've
[53:43] been baptized father son holy ghost well
[53:46] let me tell you what the prophet said he
[53:48] said thus saith the lord the baptism
[53:50] using the title of father son holy ghost
[53:52] is false
[53:55] well we might as well preach this
[53:56] morning
[53:58] we got up out of bed and got dressed and
[53:59] cleaned cleaned our faces off and combed
[54:02] our hair and come church we might as
[54:03] well preach that we ain't been thus
[54:04] saith the lord the baptism amen father
[54:07] son holy ghost is false thus saith the
[54:09] lord i command every one of you here and
[54:11] on tape that hasn't been baptized in the
[54:14] name of jesus christ be baptized again
[54:17] in the name of jesus christ even see if
[54:20] you want the life of christ it's going
[54:21] to come by the name of christ amen the
[54:24] bible says see the life of christ is
[54:26] revealed through the name amen i want
[54:28] you to catch something because it's been
[54:30] a debate for years on should we baptize
[54:32] according to matthew 28 19 shall we
[54:34] baptize acts 2 3 how shall we baptize
[54:37] but let's go back to a man who was there
[54:39] at both times is that okay he says by
[54:42] the life of christ he reveals and peter
[54:44] was standing right there with the keys
[54:46] of the kingdom of heaven in his hand and
[54:48] the kingdom is the holy ghost the
[54:50] kingdom is the holy ghost he said
[54:53] hanging on his side the keys the kingdom
[54:55] in other words the revelation because
[54:58] jesus told him peter was the one that
[55:00] was blessed with the revelation now i
[55:02] want you to catch this how many knows
[55:04] matthew 28 19. you know that verse do
[55:06] you realize that peter was standing
[55:08] right there and heard jesus say those
[55:10] words
[55:12] brother said peter was right there and
[55:15] heard jesus say he was the man standing
[55:18] there heard jesus say go ye therefore
[55:20] teach all nations baptizing them in the
[55:22] name of the father son and the holy
[55:24] ghost now i want you to get something
[55:25] peter standing right there heard jesus
[55:27] say that and turned around and said lord
[55:30] i got the keys here i got the revelation
[55:33] that that meant because i know father's
[55:35] no name and son has no name and the holy
[55:37] ghost just no name i know what the name
[55:39] is so i baptize you in the name of jesus
[55:43] christ amen that's right so think about
[55:45] this peter standing there amen people
[55:48] say well are you going to stand with
[55:49] jesus in matthew 28 or are you going to
[55:51] stand with peter in acts 2. how can you
[55:53] separate the two event when peter was
[55:56] standing there and heard jesus say
[55:58] father son holy ghost but by the spirit
[56:01] of revelation he received the name amen
[56:04] that it was jesus christ and he went and
[56:05] baptized
[56:07] him he went baptized him in the name of
[56:09] jesus christ which was to fulfill the
[56:11] words of acts 15 14 amen that god would
[56:15] visit the gentiles amen to take out of
[56:17] them a people for his name amen not for
[56:20] his title amen before his name the
[56:23] prophet said for in his name of the
[56:25] gentiles trust amen see the gentiles
[56:28] will trust in his name in other words
[56:30] the bride the called out ones amen
[56:33] called out of the gentiles will be
[56:35] trusting in the name of jesus christ in
[56:38] his name shall the gentiles trust amen i
[56:41] don't know about you this morning but
[56:42] i'm thankful for the name i'm thankful
[56:44] for the name of the lord jesus christ i
[56:46] am proud to be called by the name of
[56:48] jesus christ i'm proud to be identified
[56:51] amen by the name of jesus christ amen
[56:54] then whatever i do i do not do it in a
[56:56] title i do it in the name according to
[56:58] paul whatsoever you do in word or indeed
[57:01] do it all in the name of the lord jesus
[57:03] amen giving thanks to god and the father
[57:06] by him if we pray we got to pray in the
[57:09] name of jesus if we petition we're going
[57:11] to ask in the name of jesus if we walk
[57:13] we're going to walk in the name of jesus
[57:15] if we talk we talk in jesus name if we
[57:18] baptize we baptize in the name of jesus
[57:21] christ for all that we do in word or
[57:24] deed do it in the name of jesus christ
[57:28] then to think this morning amended
[57:30] denomination lost the authority of the
[57:32] name but god would send a prophet in the
[57:34] last days according to revelation 10 7
[57:37] who would say in the days of the voice
[57:40] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[57:42] to sound amen the mystery of god should
[57:44] be finished as he had declared to his
[57:47] servants the prophets the bible says it
[57:49] like this the minister mystery of god
[57:52] should be finished let me say that with
[57:54] me the mystery of god should be finished
[57:57] and this is the sign of the end sir the
[57:59] seventh angel here is sending forth this
[58:01] message to the laodicean church notice
[58:03] his type of message it wasn't to the
[58:06] first angel it wasn't given to the
[58:08] second third fourth fifth or sixth but
[58:09] the seventh angel had this type of
[58:11] message what is it amen finishing all
[58:14] the mysteries of god that was written in
[58:17] the book the seventh angel is winding up
[58:20] all the mysteries that's been laying
[58:22] loosened and offered organization and
[58:24] denomination the seventh angel gathers
[58:26] them finishes up the entire mystery
[58:29] that's what the bible said he will
[58:31] finish the mystery of the written book
[58:33] so the seventh angel's message will tie
[58:35] together all the lucians and they will
[58:38] release the faith in the church now what
[58:40] does matthew 13 11 say it says because
[58:43] it is given unto you which he was
[58:45] speaking to his disciples he meant to
[58:47] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[58:49] heaven
[58:50] but to them it is not given how many is
[58:52] familiar with the tape called sirs is
[58:54] this the sign of the end 1962
[58:56] brotherhood come the end of this minute
[58:58] or the end of the end of a second pull
[58:59] ministry and he's fixing to turn to a
[59:01] third pool and he preaches a message
[59:03] called sirs is this the sign of the ian
[59:06] and in there he's going to say these
[59:07] words a mystery is a scripture which is
[59:10] a previously hidden truth but is now
[59:13] divinely revealed but which is a
[59:16] supernatural element still remains
[59:18] despite the revelation
[59:21] now brother sister that's a mouthful
[59:23] amen a supernatural element still
[59:25] remains despite the revelation the
[59:28] greater mysteries and the greater
[59:30] mysteries are now so a prophet is
[59:32] showing you that the revelation does not
[59:34] remove the supernatural amen the
[59:36] revelation does not does not diminish
[59:39] the supernatural amen the supernatural
[59:41] remains despite the revelation in that
[59:44] message he's going to list several
[59:45] mysteries she'll list the mystery of the
[59:47] translation the mystery of the godhead
[59:49] but there's one mystery he pulls out he
[59:51] says the mystery of water baptism where
[59:54] the extreme trinitarianism has brought
[59:56] forth into titles of father son holy
[59:59] ghost he says and the mystery of the
[1:00:01] godhead being fulfilled in the baptism
[1:00:04] of the name of jesus christ brother
[1:00:06] that's another mouthful that the mystery
[1:00:08] of god is fulfilled in the name of jesus
[1:00:11] christ according to the book of the
[1:00:13] revelation that the church is to receive
[1:00:16] in this time so in other words according
[1:00:18] to the word the church is to receive a
[1:00:20] revelation in the hour we're living in
[1:00:23] which will be the time together of the
[1:00:25] loose sins of the scripture which will
[1:00:27] be the releasing of the faith for a
[1:00:29] rapture come on friends we have not come
[1:00:32] here to drive down our stakes and
[1:00:33] repealed alive and we ought to see you
[1:00:35] we have come here to let the devil know
[1:00:37] we are pilgrims and strangers we're
[1:00:39] passing through we've got a future home
[1:00:42] to possess we've got a body change to
[1:00:44] take we've got a rapture to go into
[1:00:46] we've got a marriage supper the lamb to
[1:00:48] protect us we've got streets of gold to
[1:00:50] walk uphold we've got walls of jasper to
[1:00:53] behold we've got gates of pearl to walk
[1:00:55] through i'm on church we have not come
[1:00:57] here to receive something to sustain us
[1:00:59] and to get us in laodicea we've come to
[1:01:01] receive something to take us out of
[1:01:03] laodicea and god has sent a message and
[1:01:06] then through the name of jesus christ to
[1:01:08] restore the authority to his church oh
[1:01:11] my people say well amen i'll tell you
[1:01:12] this much water baptism is some simple
[1:01:14] little doctrine amen we move on to
[1:01:16] something else well that may be okay if
[1:01:18] you don't want to really know who you
[1:01:19] are amen but if you really recognize who
[1:01:21] you are you'll see that water baptism
[1:01:23] it's not some little little doctrine
[1:01:25] that you get when you first got saved
[1:01:27] and move on to something else amen i'll
[1:01:29] tell you how important it is amen for
[1:01:31] paul would say that the eyes of your
[1:01:33] understanding being enlightened
[1:01:37] the eyes of your understanding be
[1:01:39] enlightened that you may know what is
[1:01:41] the hope of this calling and what the
[1:01:43] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:01:45] he is in the saints now how many knows
[1:01:47] there's a book called the church age
[1:01:48] book amen and i know a lot of people say
[1:01:50] well it's great let me say it this way
[1:01:52] it's the truth
[1:01:53] brother man wrote the church age but
[1:01:55] let's let's knock that devil out here
[1:01:56] it's his book amen in there he'll open
[1:01:59] up in the introduction and say through
[1:02:01] this volume will concern itself with
[1:02:02] various major doctrines such as the
[1:02:05] godhead and water baptism
[1:02:07] now right there knocks the idea out that
[1:02:09] water baptism is some little doctrine
[1:02:11] somewhere amen it will contain itself
[1:02:13] with various major doctrines amen the
[1:02:16] godhead and water baptism found in
[1:02:18] revelation chapter one through three its
[1:02:20] main theme is the setting fourth of a
[1:02:23] detailed study of the seven church ages
[1:02:25] now this is necessary in order to
[1:02:28] understand the rest of the revelation
[1:02:30] for out of the ages come the seals out
[1:02:32] of the seals come the trumpets out of
[1:02:34] the trumpets come the vows like the
[1:02:36] first burst of a roman candle the church
[1:02:38] age comes forth with a mighty initial
[1:02:40] illumination without which there could
[1:02:42] be no further line but once the
[1:02:44] brilliance of the seven church ages is
[1:02:46] given by divine revelation somebody say
[1:02:48] divine revelation by divine revelation
[1:02:51] light upon light follows until the whole
[1:02:54] of this revelation opens wide before our
[1:02:56] wondering eyes and we are edified and
[1:02:59] purified by its spirit and are made
[1:03:01] ready for his glorious appearance even
[1:03:04] our lord and savior the one true god
[1:03:06] amen jesus christ then whatever is
[1:03:09] breaking forth out of this word is not
[1:03:11] coming by divine education it is coming
[1:03:13] by divine revelation and he says it will
[1:03:16] be light upon light upon light that will
[1:03:18] move our wondering eyes to a stability
[1:03:21] and will be edified and purified by the
[1:03:24] revelation that we're receiving which
[1:03:26] will lift us into a sphere for rapture
[1:03:28] oh glory to god come on church amen we
[1:03:30] have not received a religious education
[1:03:33] we have received revelation that has
[1:03:35] come straight from god himself and the
[1:03:37] age that we're living in i said like
[1:03:39] this there is a gross error today amen
[1:03:41] that there are three gods let me let me
[1:03:43] let me put my voice with the voice of
[1:03:45] the word and say there are no such
[1:03:46] things
[1:03:48] hear o israel the lord our god is one
[1:03:52] lord the prophet said the spirit of god
[1:03:54] and john expresses their sleep in order
[1:03:56] to set forth the supreme deity of jesus
[1:03:58] christ amen to reveal the godhead as one
[1:04:01] god today there is a gross error it is
[1:04:04] that there are three gods instead of one
[1:04:06] but this revelation is i hope it's okay
[1:04:09] as given to john by jesus himself
[1:04:12] corrects that heir it is not that there
[1:04:14] are three gods but there is one god with
[1:04:16] three offices so you're not dismissing
[1:04:19] father son holy ghost you're receiving
[1:04:21] the revelation that those are three
[1:04:23] offices of one person and his name is
[1:04:25] the lord jesus christ amen there is one
[1:04:28] god with three titles he is a father he
[1:04:31] is a son he is the holy ghost he said
[1:04:33] this mighty revelation is what the early
[1:04:37] church had listen
[1:04:38] brother madam's teaching on the godhead
[1:04:40] was not something new it was already
[1:04:42] here before the dark ages it was here
[1:04:44] before denomination what happened was is
[1:04:47] the man's ideas tore down the authority
[1:04:49] of the name but it must be restored in
[1:04:52] the last days along with the correct
[1:04:54] formula for water baptism so with the
[1:04:57] restoration of the name comes a
[1:04:59] restoration of the way to baptize which
[1:05:02] comes the restoration of power in the
[1:05:04] church because there's no other name
[1:05:06] amen that power can come by outside of
[1:05:09] the name of jesus christ amen i admit
[1:05:11] that it takes a revelation from the holy
[1:05:13] ghost to see the truth about the godhead
[1:05:15] and these days when there are so much
[1:05:17] perverting of the scriptures in the mind
[1:05:19] he said but the prevailing overcoming
[1:05:22] church is built on revelation so we can
[1:05:25] expect god to reveal his truth to us
[1:05:28] amen if god expects you to overcome and
[1:05:31] prevail against the gates of hell he's
[1:05:34] got to release a revelation to you that
[1:05:36] will give you the power to do what his
[1:05:38] word is requiring you to do in the age
[1:05:40] you're living in amen now let me say
[1:05:42] this i've actually met people brother
[1:05:43] john they'll say well i'm praying about
[1:05:45] getting baptized i'm praying about water
[1:05:47] baptism i'm praying should i get
[1:05:49] baptized should i not the prophet of god
[1:05:51] said however amen you actually don't
[1:05:53] need a revelation on water baptism it is
[1:05:55] right there staring you in the face
[1:05:59] come on now it's right there staring you
[1:06:01] in the face well i'm praying shouldn't i
[1:06:03] get baptized should i and i had one one
[1:06:05] person tell me one time in the prayer
[1:06:06] line they said i'm praying should i get
[1:06:08] the holy ghost or not i said brother
[1:06:10] there are some things you ain't got to
[1:06:11] pray about amen his word is his will and
[1:06:14] what is written come on now if your
[1:06:16] daddy died and he had a wheel and he
[1:06:18] wrote things in that wheel he'd say you
[1:06:20] know let's put it this way brother john
[1:06:22] and brother seth and i were brothers in
[1:06:24] the flesh amen our daddy died and our
[1:06:26] daddy had a he had a house he had a
[1:06:28] ranch and he had a boathouse he meant
[1:06:30] well i got the boathouse and brother
[1:06:32] john got the ranch and his brother said
[1:06:34] he got the he got the the lake house or
[1:06:36] whatever you know or the house amen now
[1:06:38] look the wheel is open right amen
[1:06:40] therefore you read the wheel and i'll
[1:06:42] tell you what you're not going to do is
[1:06:43] you're not going to sit there and decide
[1:06:45] if you can receive that or not if it's
[1:06:47] wrote in the will and it is your name is
[1:06:49] in the will then you've got a right to
[1:06:51] go possess what's been left to you and i
[1:06:54] say this morning church the word of god
[1:06:56] is the will of god and whatever his word
[1:06:59] says is what he desires his children to
[1:07:02] possess and if his word said repent of
[1:07:04] your sins and be baptized in the name of
[1:07:06] jesus christ for the remission of sin
[1:07:09] and you shall receive it give to the
[1:07:10] holy ghost amen the first step is repent
[1:07:13] amen the second step is received and
[1:07:15] then the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:07:17] through a
[1:07:18] water baptism oh my would it be possible
[1:07:21] then for one minute for the apostles to
[1:07:23] be led astray from a direct command of
[1:07:26] the lord to baptize in the name of the
[1:07:27] father son holy ghost amen and then find
[1:07:30] them in willful disobedience they knew
[1:07:32] what the name was and there is not one
[1:07:35] place in scripture were they baptized
[1:07:37] any other way than in the name of the
[1:07:39] lord jesus christ amen i love how a
[1:07:41] prophet puts things he says common sense
[1:07:44] would tell you that the book of acts is
[1:07:46] the church in action and if they baptize
[1:07:48] that way then that is the way to baptize
[1:07:51] common sense would tell you if they were
[1:07:53] baptized in the name of jesus christ and
[1:07:56] was overcoming which doctors amen that's
[1:07:58] the way to baptize if they were baptized
[1:08:01] and in the name of jesus christ and they
[1:08:03] were raising a paralyzed people then
[1:08:05] that's the name to baptize him
[1:08:08] well glory to god anyhow if you think
[1:08:10] that is strong what do you think of this
[1:08:13] anyone who was not baptized in the name
[1:08:15] of the lord jesus had to be baptized
[1:08:17] over again jesus didn't go there and say
[1:08:20] well let's let's reason about this and
[1:08:21] you know no he said go be baptized again
[1:08:24] amen then don't think you're strong when
[1:08:25] the prophet said amen thus saith the
[1:08:27] lord you've been baptized entitled
[1:08:29] you've been baptized wrong amen it was
[1:08:31] the same spirit coming from the same
[1:08:34] revelation coming from the same name
[1:08:36] which is the name of jesus christ amen
[1:08:39] let's look at this if this is okay in
[1:08:40] the book of acts the second chapter and
[1:08:42] the 38th verse amen notice his name here
[1:08:45] amen it's right here in the first two
[1:08:47] words of the scripture and then peter
[1:08:50] said in them okay where have i heard
[1:08:52] that name peter at before oh that's
[1:08:54] right peter was there in matthew 28 19
[1:08:56] right that's right peter was there in
[1:08:58] matthew 16 then here he is in acts 2 and
[1:09:01] it says repent and be baptized every one
[1:09:04] of you in the name of jesus christ for
[1:09:06] the remission of sin and you shall
[1:09:09] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:09:11] somebody shout that word baptized
[1:09:14] be baptized that word baptized means to
[1:09:17] dip repeatedly to emerge to submerge a
[1:09:20] vessel sunk it means to cleanse by
[1:09:23] dipping or submerging it is to wash to
[1:09:26] make clean with water to wash oneself to
[1:09:28] bathe it is not to be overwhelmed or
[1:09:31] confused with 9 11. now amen i'm not
[1:09:33] talking about the terrorist attack
[1:09:37] i'm talking about two greek words
[1:09:40] one is is in the greek lexicon it's
[1:09:43] numbered 911 which that word means bapto
[1:09:45] b-a-p-t-o
[1:09:47] the clearest example shows that the mean
[1:09:49] of baptism now notice this there's two
[1:09:51] different types there's bapto then
[1:09:53] there's baptism bapto and baptizo two
[1:09:56] different meanings he said it's a text
[1:09:58] from the greek poet and physician that
[1:10:00] candor who lived about 2000 or 200 b.c
[1:10:03] it is a recipe for making pickles and is
[1:10:06] a helpful because it uses both words
[1:10:08] nick kander says that in order to make a
[1:10:11] pickle the vegetable should first be
[1:10:13] dipped which is baptob into boiling
[1:10:15] water and then it should be baptized
[1:10:17] which is baptizo in the vinegar solution
[1:10:22] it shall be bapto which is to dip in the
[1:10:25] water boiling water then it shall be
[1:10:27] baptizo which is means to be submerged
[1:10:29] into the vinegar solution both verbs
[1:10:32] concern the immersion of vegetables in a
[1:10:34] solution oh god somebody shout solution
[1:10:37] amen the problem is we got a pickle that
[1:10:40] needs to be changed we got a cucumber
[1:10:42] that needs to be turned to a pickle what
[1:10:44] is the solution there's got to be a
[1:10:46] solution somewhere amen the first notice
[1:10:48] this the first is temporary amen so the
[1:10:51] bapto is temporary amen the second is
[1:10:54] the act of baptizing the vegetable which
[1:10:56] produces a permanent change
[1:10:59] glory to god you can bapto it and it's
[1:11:02] only temporary but you can baptize oh it
[1:11:04] and it'll produce a change when used in
[1:11:06] the new testament amen the word more
[1:11:09] often refers to our union and
[1:11:10] identification with christ then to our
[1:11:13] water baptism he that believes and is
[1:11:15] baptized shall be saved amen christ is
[1:11:18] saying that the mere intellectual ascent
[1:11:21] is not enough there must be a union with
[1:11:23] him which is a real change like a
[1:11:26] vegetable to a pickle i'm on church you
[1:11:28] can take that vegetable and you can
[1:11:30] bapto it all day long you can dip it and
[1:11:32] you can dip it and you can dip it and
[1:11:34] there'll be no change but if you ever
[1:11:36] baptize it and you emerge it into a
[1:11:39] solution amen then the solution will
[1:11:41] produce a change i say to you tonight
[1:11:43] friends amen i propose to you amen that
[1:11:46] you can baptize a person in the creek
[1:11:48] until the catfish know him by their
[1:11:50] first name but until they receive the
[1:11:52] authority of the holy ghost there will
[1:11:54] never be a change but if jesus christ
[1:11:57] comes in that vessel there'll be a
[1:11:59] change like you've never seen before
[1:12:02] glory to god i'm not talking about a
[1:12:04] temporary change i'm not talking about
[1:12:06] going to church and shaking a preacher's
[1:12:08] hand you can do that under dead titles
[1:12:10] and you'll remain a cigarette sucking
[1:12:12] alcoholic drinking man amen but if you
[1:12:15] ever get the holy ghost if you ever
[1:12:17] receive the authority of jesus christ
[1:12:20] through his name it'll do more than make
[1:12:22] you a church member it'll do more than
[1:12:24] just make you a religious individual
[1:12:26] it'll make you a holy ghost field fire
[1:12:28] baptized devil-chasing son or daughter
[1:12:31] of god
[1:12:33] come on friends we need more than baptoe
[1:12:36] we need a baptism with the spirit of god
[1:12:38] to come in the church and to produce a
[1:12:40] change
[1:12:43] a change somebody shout change
[1:12:45] this ain't a temporary change it's a
[1:12:47] permanent change i tell you what our
[1:12:49] young people need we need to change come
[1:12:51] on our young people are facing devils
[1:12:53] that you ain't never faced before well i
[1:12:56] might as well preach i'm here hat now
[1:12:57] amen our kids are facing transgender
[1:12:59] devils homosexual devils all kinds of
[1:13:02] demons of perversion i pay what we need
[1:13:04] in the church we don't need
[1:13:06] intellectualism and we don't need
[1:13:07] psychology we need jesus christ amen to
[1:13:11] come in the church to the authority and
[1:13:13] power of his name and release our young
[1:13:15] people from the demons of laodicea
[1:13:17] release our churches from the pressures
[1:13:19] of religion into a place where god can
[1:13:22] bring a change
[1:13:24] oh god you say well preacher i don't
[1:13:26] think things need to be preached about
[1:13:28] and the very minute you quit preaching
[1:13:29] about it it's the very time it comes in
[1:13:31] your church
[1:13:32] well i might as well preach that now
[1:13:34] amen don't talk about makeup and before
[1:13:36] long the whole church will be full of it
[1:13:37] don't talk about televisions and before
[1:13:39] long the whole church will have one
[1:13:41] don't preach against high-heeled shoes
[1:13:43] and before long the whole church will be
[1:13:44] wearing them amen if there is a god who
[1:13:47] said come out from among them and be
[1:13:49] separate saith the lord i think somebody
[1:13:51] ought to get a backbone and preach the
[1:13:53] word of god until jesus comes in the
[1:13:56] church and brings a change by the
[1:13:58] authority of his name amen
[1:14:01] well i'm sorry i ain't no lip rested
[1:14:04] amen 65 preacher i am a sassafras holy
[1:14:07] ghost-filled preacher may not be popular
[1:14:09] but it's the truth anyhow i will not
[1:14:11] back up the devils i will not bow my
[1:14:13] knee to devils sin is sin and holiness
[1:14:16] is holiness and somebody ought to stand
[1:14:18] up and take a stand for the word of god
[1:14:20] and the name of jesus christ
[1:14:24] i'll tell you why all that nonsense
[1:14:25] filled up the nominations because they
[1:14:26] got a dead name they got a dead title
[1:14:29] they got no authority they got no
[1:14:30] strength ain't meant to resist those
[1:14:32] spirits that's why you got men in the
[1:14:34] pulpit that's been married three and
[1:14:35] four times that's why you got deacons
[1:14:37] with cigarettes in their pocket oh come
[1:14:39] on somebody i might as well preach that
[1:14:41] now that's why the church is full of
[1:14:42] corruption it's because there's no
[1:14:44] strength in the church because the
[1:14:46] strength comes by the name
[1:14:52] i am who i am
[1:14:55] are you hearing me there's got to be
[1:14:56] strength in the church to withstand
[1:14:58] it'll only come to the name of jesus
[1:15:00] christ i'll tell you amen now don't get
[1:15:02] mad at me amen but there's no strength
[1:15:04] to even be what god called them to be
[1:15:06] do you realize god called a man to be a
[1:15:08] man and he called a woman to be a woman
[1:15:10] and he called a preacher to be a
[1:15:11] preacher and he called a deacon to be a
[1:15:13] deacon and he called a sunday school
[1:15:14] teacher to be a sunday school teacher
[1:15:16] and he called a husband to be a husband
[1:15:18] and a wife to be a wife he didn't call
[1:15:20] the wife to be the head ship of the home
[1:15:22] and he didn't call the husband to be
[1:15:24] some penny-wasted that ain't got
[1:15:26] the courage to take a stand and lead his
[1:15:28] family
[1:15:30] it's a it's a it's a warped role you
[1:15:32] know why because there's no life in
[1:15:33] there there's no strength in there
[1:15:35] they're under titles that has no power
[1:15:38] oh come on friends amen well brother
[1:15:40] andrew word gave it here in the name of
[1:15:41] father in the name of father how many
[1:15:43] fathers are they here today well we're
[1:15:45] gathered here in the name of son how
[1:15:46] many sons are there here well we're
[1:15:48] gathered here in the name of the spirit
[1:15:49] there's all kinds of spirits in here as
[1:15:52] long as you don't put a name to the
[1:15:53] title then there'll be no identification
[1:15:56] the strength of what you're talking
[1:15:57] about but if you put a name behind the
[1:15:59] title then there'll be an identification
[1:16:01] and a strength time and i want the devil
[1:16:03] to know as for me and my house we are
[1:16:06] following the name of the lord jesus
[1:16:08] christ let there be no question what god
[1:16:11] we're following we're following the same
[1:16:13] god that peter preached about we're
[1:16:15] found the same god that paul met on the
[1:16:17] road to damascus that changed him from
[1:16:20] being a stiff net a man starching a
[1:16:22] million follower to be in a holy ghost
[1:16:25] field prophet of god to lead the church
[1:16:27] into victory
[1:16:30] glory to god hallelujah it's the truth
[1:16:32] anyhow we ought to lift up the name of
[1:16:34] jesus
[1:16:37] somebody shout jesus
[1:16:39] somebody shout jesus
[1:16:41] the name of jesus is above every demon
[1:16:43] the name of jesus is above every
[1:16:45] sickness
[1:16:47] the name of jesus will make a clean
[1:16:48] living family
[1:16:50] the name of jesus will make a clean
[1:16:52] living marriage the name of jesus will
[1:16:54] make a clean living church
[1:16:56] come on now
[1:16:57] i'm talking about the name of the lord
[1:16:59] jesus christ but the the problem is
[1:17:00] we're living at that time where there's
[1:17:01] no strength to withstand
[1:17:04] because they've denied the name that
[1:17:05] gives them the strength
[1:17:07] i remember a few years ago my one of my
[1:17:09] my great uncles his wife that i've been
[1:17:10] my great aunt we went to the funeral and
[1:17:13] it was at a methodist church we went in
[1:17:14] there and as i pulled in the parking lot
[1:17:16] there was a sign out front and it said
[1:17:18] so-and-so is a pastor i said oh i've
[1:17:20] heard that name i go to school with his
[1:17:21] daughter you know so i walked in and
[1:17:24] there was the guy stepped the door and
[1:17:25] he said well my name is so and so i said
[1:17:27] oh you must be the pastor right
[1:17:29] he said no he said look up there and
[1:17:31] about that time brother
[1:17:33] out of the office walked his wife she
[1:17:34] had a big long roll bone big old gold
[1:17:36] cross he said she's the pastor
[1:17:44] he said she's a pastor i said well what
[1:17:46] do you do
[1:17:49] if she's the pastor what do you do he
[1:17:51] said well i wash and i cook and i clean
[1:17:53] i take the kids to school i put him to
[1:17:55] bed i make the beds i thought what a
[1:17:57] warped perverted role under the name of
[1:17:59] religion
[1:18:03] i'm not a politician i'm a preacher
[1:18:05] what a warped role under the name of
[1:18:08] religion amen here is a
[1:18:10] god's order was a man to lead and a
[1:18:12] woman to follow i'm not talking about a
[1:18:14] wife abuser i'm talking about a real
[1:18:16] example she can follow can i preach
[1:18:19] are you hearing me if you want your wife
[1:18:20] to follow you set an example she can
[1:18:22] follow
[1:18:25] it's a perversion role and the reason
[1:18:27] it's a perverted role is because an evil
[1:18:29] conscience has come in the church and
[1:18:31] they've seared their conscience to the
[1:18:32] word by some dead interpretation of the
[1:18:35] devil's interpretation of the name of
[1:18:37] jesus but look what paul said he said
[1:18:39] let us draw near with a true heart in a
[1:18:42] full assurance of faith having our
[1:18:44] hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience
[1:18:47] and our bodies washed with the pure
[1:18:49] water that word prequel means shook away
[1:18:51] amen shake away our conscience with the
[1:18:54] sin problem and evil and darkness shook
[1:18:56] all that off and with our bodies we have
[1:18:59] been washed with pure water through
[1:19:01] water baptism in the name of jesus
[1:19:03] christ to walk freely and boldly up to
[1:19:06] god knowing this that the evil that i
[1:19:08] once loved has passed away
[1:19:11] well i'm preaching to you now the evil
[1:19:14] that i once loved is now passed away
[1:19:16] knowing that the life that i once lived
[1:19:18] is now ceased not because i did it
[1:19:20] because something come in me and did it
[1:19:23] itself by grace he saved me i believed
[1:19:26] him he'd give me the holy spirit and the
[1:19:29] things that i once hated i now love the
[1:19:32] sacrifice it used to be hard for me to
[1:19:34] go to church i love to go now to hear
[1:19:37] the people sing and shout and testify i
[1:19:39] used to hate it but i love it now
[1:19:42] because something has changed me then i
[1:19:45] have a new living way something is
[1:19:47] anchored here i know when i went down in
[1:19:50] the water and they baptized me in the
[1:19:52] name of the lord jesus christ i came up

[1:23:36] she's going to lay in the floor and
[1:23:38] she's going to look at that wall and say
[1:23:39] i'll climb it if it takes me all night
[1:23:43] i said what do you mean he said she
[1:23:45] going to get so drunk he said for long
[1:23:47] she gonna start claiming things that
[1:23:49] aren't hers he said like this you get
[1:23:51] somebody drunk you get somebody drunk in
[1:23:53] their in somebody else's house he said
[1:23:55] they'll go to claim and that's their
[1:23:56] house that's their car that's their home
[1:23:58] he said see what happens is when they
[1:24:00] get intoxicated it releases something in
[1:24:02] them to claim something that's not
[1:24:04] theirs or somebody says they can't have
[1:24:06] i thought oh god that's what we need
[1:24:08] today is a drunk church get him so drunk
[1:24:10] on the holy ghost if they lay in the
[1:24:12] floor brother roger and scroll and cream
[1:24:14] and cry and everything else get them so
[1:24:16] drunk till they look at this rapture and
[1:24:18] say i'll take it if it costs me
[1:24:20] everything i'll take my mountain if it
[1:24:23] cost me everything i have not come here
[1:24:25] to die and they ought to see you i have
[1:24:27] come here to live by the revelation of
[1:24:29] the name i've been baptized in amen i
[1:24:32] tell you what it's time to do it's time
[1:24:33] to quit taking satan substitutes for the
[1:24:35] name of jesus christ
[1:24:38] there is no other name whereby men can
[1:24:39] be saved so quit accepting some
[1:24:42] substitute that has no power to save the
[1:24:44] prophet said they don't give a
[1:24:45] substitution for water baptism in the
[1:24:47] name of jesus christ they said father
[1:24:49] son holy ghost another place he said
[1:24:51] don't be carried away with this hybrid
[1:24:53] stuff it's not right it's finally come
[1:24:56] to a tent and it can't go back when it's
[1:24:57] hybrid it's finished
[1:25:00] he said see they've done substituted
[1:25:02] divine healing he said with the doctor's
[1:25:04] office instead of on your knees in
[1:25:05] prayer
[1:25:06] now are you preaching against going to
[1:25:07] the doctor no brother took his kiss to
[1:25:09] the doctor i'm saying don't let the
[1:25:11] devil rob you of the power that's in the
[1:25:13] name you've been baptized in he said see
[1:25:15] they divided the word of the nightmares
[1:25:17] now i want to read this to you from the
[1:25:18] indictment he said notice they the
[1:25:21] worshipers the men who had looked for
[1:25:23] the promise the men who would look for
[1:25:24] it through the years and ages and with
[1:25:26] nothing to do but in that constant
[1:25:27] seminary but they had divided the word
[1:25:30] according to the teacher the seminary
[1:25:32] and they had missed the very truth of it
[1:25:34] he said see they the priest the minister
[1:25:36] that day there the headquarters the
[1:25:38] ministry of that day was killing the
[1:25:40] very god the very lamb the very one they
[1:25:42] claimed to be worshiping they were
[1:25:44] killing come on amen do you realize and
[1:25:46] that's what's happened today he said see
[1:25:48] the day i'm not this bunch of ordained
[1:25:50] ministers in their creeds and
[1:25:52] denominations they are crucifying to the
[1:25:54] people the very god that they claim to
[1:25:57] love and serve i indict these ministers
[1:25:59] in the name of jesus christ upon their
[1:26:02] doctrine that they claim the days of
[1:26:04] miracles has passed and that water
[1:26:05] baptism in the name is not sufficient
[1:26:08] and is not right upon any of those words
[1:26:10] that they have sister decrees for i
[1:26:12] indict them as guilty and the blood of
[1:26:15] jesus christ is upon their hands for
[1:26:17] crucifying afresh the lord jesus the
[1:26:20] second time they are crucifying christ
[1:26:22] to the public taken from them the thing
[1:26:24] that they're supposed to be giving them
[1:26:26] and they substituted something else in
[1:26:28] its place he said see a church creed for
[1:26:31] popularity so they've substituted a
[1:26:34] church creed for popularity what is a
[1:26:36] church creed a church creed is that
[1:26:38] we've got titles instead of a name and
[1:26:40] they took that in the place to be
[1:26:42] popular i'm on church but let's go back
[1:26:44] to peter who had the keys and let's see
[1:26:47] what is three three is perfection right
[1:26:49] do you realize in acts 2 he opened the
[1:26:51] jews he opened the jews at jerusalem
[1:26:54] with the right to go in the kingdom in
[1:26:56] acts chapter 8 he opened it to the
[1:26:58] samaritans in acts chapter 10 he opened
[1:27:00] it to the gentiles the three major races
[1:27:03] peter opened the kingdom to them by the
[1:27:05] revelation of the name of jesus christ
[1:27:07] and being baptized in that name oh now
[1:27:10] and i preached you for a second amen you
[1:27:12] know what peter was he was an ignorant
[1:27:14] an unlearned fisherman
[1:27:16] come on he was an ignorant an unlearned
[1:27:18] fisherman peter was a fisherman that
[1:27:20] knew nothing about god the only thing he
[1:27:22] probably knowed was how to catch fish
[1:27:24] but when he come in the presence of god
[1:27:26] and seen the great creator who could
[1:27:28] create fish when he told him to let down
[1:27:30] the net for the draw there wasn't any
[1:27:32] fish there so he just pulled his net up
[1:27:35] but he said at thy word lord i believe
[1:27:37] that you're the son of god and if i let
[1:27:39] down the net you told me you would do
[1:27:41] your word because you and your word are
[1:27:43] the same so i let down the net when he
[1:27:46] began to pull he said depart lord i'm a
[1:27:48] sinful man see a fisherman after peter
[1:27:51] met christ and we say those words
[1:27:53] together after peter met christ he was
[1:27:56] never the same anymore so peter had come
[1:27:59] from baptist he went into baptism and he
[1:28:02] had found the solution and the solution
[1:28:05] was the name of jesus christ in water
[1:28:07] baptism which would open up the power of
[1:28:10] the holy ghost he was never the same he
[1:28:13] afterwards was so true to god that he
[1:28:15] was given the keys to the kingdom come
[1:28:17] on friends quit trying to separate peter
[1:28:19] from jesus peter was standing there in
[1:28:22] matthew 28 and he was there in acts 2.
[1:28:25] he was there in matthew 16 and his
[1:28:27] revelation is right here in this
[1:28:29] building this morning if there's anybody
[1:28:31] ready to receive the power of god there
[1:28:33] is an atonement power here for you to
[1:28:35] come in this power by the name of jesus
[1:28:38] peter couldn't even sign his own name
[1:28:40] think about this he couldn't even sign
[1:28:42] his own name yet he had the keys to the
[1:28:44] kingdom of god given to him by jesus
[1:28:46] christ
[1:28:49] i'm trying to behave myself this morning
[1:28:51] he couldn't even sign his own name but
[1:28:53] yet he had the keys given to him by the
[1:28:56] name of jesus christ jesus was not
[1:28:59] looking at peter's education he was
[1:29:01] looking at peter's faith he was not
[1:29:03] looking at peter's ability to understand
[1:29:05] what he was saying he was looking at
[1:29:07] peter's ability to believe what he was
[1:29:08] saying listen i don't know how brother
[1:29:11] that a man can believe on the name of
[1:29:12] jesus christ that is so vile and so
[1:29:15] wretched and so tore up and so scarred
[1:29:17] and so full of sin i don't understand by
[1:29:20] education how he can believe on the name
[1:29:23] and be baptized and receive something in
[1:29:25] his soul that changes him forever i
[1:29:27] can't educationally prove it but i can't
[1:29:29] prove it by faith you know why because
[1:29:31] i've seen it happen and if it's happened
[1:29:33] before it can happen again i'm on church
[1:29:36] we're not on an education walk we're on
[1:29:38] a faith walk we are not walking by sight
[1:29:41] we are walking by faith it starts with
[1:29:43] faith it little faith it ends with faith
[1:29:46] come on church we are not here learning
[1:29:48] god we are believing god
[1:29:53] we are believing god peter amen believe
[1:29:56] god you realize what the bible says
[1:29:57] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:30:00] god without faith it is impossible for
[1:30:02] he that cometh to god must believe
[1:30:04] somebody shall believe that he is and he
[1:30:07] is a rewarder of them that diligently
[1:30:09] seek him can i give you a couple quotes
[1:30:11] here peter believed in such a way with
[1:30:14] such a faith that jesus gave him the
[1:30:17] keys to the kingdom
[1:30:19] and then later put him over the church
[1:30:20] another place and we noticed that he is
[1:30:23] with speaking of jesus congregation come
[1:30:24] from the poor people the outcast the
[1:30:26] ones that was probably cast away didn't
[1:30:28] have much education like the man he gave
[1:30:31] the keys the kingdom peter couldn't even
[1:30:33] sign his own name but by his faith it
[1:30:36] pleased jesus to give him the keys to
[1:30:38] the kingdom because he had revelation of
[1:30:42] him
[1:30:43] oh god it pleased god to give peter the
[1:30:45] keys because he had a revelation of him
[1:30:47] queen of sheba if you notice peter by
[1:30:49] revelation was given the keys the
[1:30:52] kingdom because god knowed that he had
[1:30:54] the revelation of the scripture before
[1:30:56] he asked his disciples and whole but one
[1:30:59] said elias others said a prophet he said
[1:31:01] but i'm asking you who do you say i am
[1:31:03] and then peter thou art the son of the
[1:31:05] liveth thus thou art the christ the son
[1:31:08] of the living god and jesus said blessed
[1:31:10] art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and
[1:31:12] blood he said see it was a revelation
[1:31:15] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:31:18] and the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:31:20] against it see then what was it it was a
[1:31:23] direct revelation can we say that
[1:31:25] together direct revelation it was a
[1:31:28] direct revelation that had been made
[1:31:30] known the apostle that he was the son of
[1:31:33] god are you ready for this i'm turning
[1:31:35] the corner we're going home in a minute
[1:31:37] okay if the church of god still exists
[1:31:40] then those in the church has come in
[1:31:42] there by spiritual revelation the same
[1:31:45] way peter came in the same way the jew
[1:31:48] and the gentile and the samaritan come
[1:31:50] in is the same way the church of the
[1:31:52] living god will come in the power and
[1:31:55] authority of god because that's how we
[1:31:57] come in the church but i'm trying to
[1:31:59] differentiate between what really is
[1:32:01] truth and what is part truth the
[1:32:03] revelation that god reveals to you that
[1:32:05] his son who died in your stead then
[1:32:08] that's the revelation who he is see then
[1:32:11] this morning you're saved amen by
[1:32:13] receiving the revelation that there's
[1:32:15] nothing you could do to save yourself
[1:32:17] there's nothing you could do to heal
[1:32:18] yourself but you receive the one who
[1:32:21] could do it and his name is the lord
[1:32:22] jesus christ
[1:32:25] then somebody say spiritual revelation
[1:32:28] how does spiritual revelation come he
[1:32:31] says when god has made him known to you
[1:32:34] as a person
[1:32:36] glory to god when god has made him known
[1:32:39] to you as a person
[1:32:40] as your savior as your god as your
[1:32:43] redeemer as your healer as your king
[1:32:45] that's how the spiritual revelation
[1:32:48] comes what did paul brother brother say
[1:32:49] peter received he received a direct
[1:32:52] revelation look at this word direct it
[1:32:55] is without intervening factors or
[1:32:57] intermediaries
[1:33:00] let me back up and say that word would
[1:33:02] make sense
[1:33:04] intermediate errors
[1:33:06] going straight to the point with no one
[1:33:08] or nothing in between it is an aim or
[1:33:10] something in a particular direction at a
[1:33:13] particular person
[1:33:15] come on now it is something that is
[1:33:17] directed at a particular direction to a
[1:33:19] particular person to give someone an
[1:33:22] official order or an authoritative
[1:33:24] instruction oh god and i have a few more
[1:33:26] minutes to receive an authoritative
[1:33:29] instruction then what does the word
[1:33:31] indirect mean it's not directly caused
[1:33:33] by
[1:33:34] or resulting from something it's not
[1:33:37] done directly it's conducted through
[1:33:39] intermediaries see so god is not an
[1:33:42] indirect god he is a direct god god
[1:33:45] directly deals with his children god
[1:33:48] does not indirectly deal with him he
[1:33:50] directly deals with them see god
[1:33:52] directly dealt with moses in exodus 3
[1:33:54] verse 1. now moses kept the flock of
[1:33:56] jethro his father-in-law the priest of
[1:33:58] midian and he led the flock to the back
[1:34:00] side of the desert and came the mountain
[1:34:02] of god even to horeb and the angel lord
[1:34:04] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[1:34:06] of the midst of a brush and he looked
[1:34:08] and behold the brush the bush burned
[1:34:10] with fire and the bush was not consumed
[1:34:12] and moses said i will now turn aside and
[1:34:15] see this great sight which that bush
[1:34:16] does not burn and when the lord saw that
[1:34:19] he turned aside the seed god called unto
[1:34:22] him come on friends moses was there he
[1:34:25] was running from god god didn't send 10
[1:34:28] different visions and dreams and gifts
[1:34:29] and prophecies god got a hold of moses
[1:34:32] and he directly led him to the back side
[1:34:34] of the desert and he directly called
[1:34:36] unto him out of the midst of the bush
[1:34:38] and said moses moses and he said here am
[1:34:41] i you realize what the prophet said he
[1:34:43] said moses had failed because he failed
[1:34:45] to find the limit the time limit of god
[1:34:48] he said when god revealed himself to him
[1:34:49] to the burning bush he found out then
[1:34:51] that they were the very thing in the
[1:34:53] burning bush was what he lacked and i
[1:34:55] think that's a hole with us today that
[1:34:57] many times we try to do the program
[1:34:58] ourselves and fail to get what was in
[1:35:01] the burden bush see the direct
[1:35:03] revelation of the wheel and the time of
[1:35:05] god we have got to have the season four
[1:35:08] so when moses found out now the direct
[1:35:11] the real direct will of god and the time
[1:35:13] of god and the revelation of everything
[1:35:15] to do now try to keep him out of egypt
[1:35:18] when he received the real revelation the
[1:35:20] direct revelation he said now try to
[1:35:23] keep him out of egypt right back to
[1:35:25] egypt he went just as hard as he could
[1:35:26] go now moses was looking first at the
[1:35:28] word and the word had promised the
[1:35:30] deliverance he knew the time was nigh
[1:35:33] now he had to have a direct contact with
[1:35:35] god to know how and when to do it he had
[1:35:38] to have a direct revelation he had to
[1:35:40] have direct contact aim to notice this
[1:35:42] to receive the direct will now we as
[1:35:44] full gospel people have made many
[1:35:46] mistakes by looking in the word and
[1:35:48] saying god said this and we fail to find
[1:35:51] the direct revelation of our life to fit
[1:35:53] in that program when we find that then
[1:35:56] things are going to happen see so what
[1:35:58] are three things we must have can i drop
[1:36:00] something to the young people we must
[1:36:01] have direct will we must have direct
[1:36:03] contact and we must have direct
[1:36:05] revelation see that we are saved amen by
[1:36:09] direct contact with god you're saved by
[1:36:11] faith not by imaginary but the direct
[1:36:14] contact with god who brings the
[1:36:16] supernatural life into your mortal
[1:36:19] beings see then when you believe on the
[1:36:20] name of the lord jesus christ you
[1:36:22] receive the name of the lord you're
[1:36:24] baptized in that name amen supernatural
[1:36:27] life for the holy ghost comes in to your
[1:36:29] mortal beings being seek then right here
[1:36:31] can i can i stop and take a quick survey
[1:36:34] how many has been baptized in the name
[1:36:36] of the lord jesus christ
[1:36:38] do you realize what you have do you
[1:36:40] realize who you are he said preacher are
[1:36:42] you trying to embarrass somebody no i'm
[1:36:43] trying to preach the word to you if

[1:37:07] this down and get you to see this that
[1:37:09] if you have been baptized in the name of
[1:37:12] jesus christ then the same life that was
[1:37:14] in him when he walked the source of
[1:37:16] galilee that was in him when he raised
[1:37:18] the widow of name son that was there
[1:37:20] when he turned water into wine that same

[1:37:38] happened it's because the same life that
[1:37:40] was in jesus christ has come into that

[1:38:35] and the direct contact that the holy
[1:38:38] spirit impressed my life with before i
[1:38:40] ever even surrendered it

[1:38:45] the name of jesus christ to the baptism
[1:38:48] of the name to receive the holy ghost he
[1:38:50] said the holy ghost had already
[1:38:52] impressed my life
[1:38:55] hallelujah he had already impressed him
[1:38:57] for as a little lad i knew there was
[1:39:00] something he had talked to me and i
[1:39:01] talked to him he had talked back to me
[1:39:03] and i began to notice that things he
[1:39:05] told me as a little lad they began to
[1:39:07] happen just exactly the way he said he
[1:39:09] would do so i knowed that it had to be
[1:39:11] true listen young people amen god has
