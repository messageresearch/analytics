seated Amen in in the last book of the Bible the last two verses of the Bible amen and then we'll have a word of prayer and have you be seated starting with verse number 20 Jesus this is the last promise given in the Bible he which testifieth these things sayith surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen amen let's just look to God In Prayer Heavenly Father we want to thank you for the opportunity that we could come into this place that's being dedicated to the purpose that you might have the preeminence of speaking and

Revelation thereof and we'll give you the praise and honor for these things for we ask them in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you you may be seated I wanted to read actually the last 16 verses um of the bi of the Bible but I just didn't want to keep you standing that long so turn with me uh there the verse number six and and I want to entitle this message coming soon and starting with verse number six and one of the seven angels from Heaven said un to John these sayings are faithful and true and the Lord God of the Holy prophets sent his Angel to show unto his servants the things must uh which must shortly be done behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the says of the prophecy of this book and I John saw saw these things and heard these things and when I heard them heard and seen I fell down to worship before uh before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things John Felt So Unworthy of this awesome presence from Heaven that he was feeling there was just nothing greater around him and it just overcame him to to want to fall down and worship it was just so real to him but praise God for the true angels of God which know that all glory belongs to Jesus Christ Jesus said for it is written thou shal Worship the Lord thy God and him alone amen then saith he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God that's good advice for every one of us amen and he saith unto me seal not the Saints of the book in other words don't seal them we want them open seal not the says of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he that is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is Holy let him be holy still now this is the angel that was speaking but the spirit of God God was so strong that actually God Jesus spoke these words and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be I am the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last and blessed are they that do his Commandments and that they may have right to the Tree of Life and may enter into the gates uh through the gates into the city for without our dogs Sorcerers hor mongers murderers adulterers idolators I'm sorry and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie I jesus sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches I am the root The Offspring of David the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that Hearth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the Water of Life freely for I testify to every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things like adding our own ideas God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy in other words ignore certain scriptures God shall take away his part of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book he which testifieth these things saith surely I come quickly these are the last words that Jesus wanted us to remember from him amen even so Lord Jesus and the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all we all want the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ to be with us amen I want to thank those of you who have wanted this day to come sooner and you had to patiently wait for our church to open we had a a sign out before the one that's out there I don't know how long it was that we had it but it was out there a while and it said coming soon now I would imagine that there were people that were going by that thought they would have been in the building by now I think most people thought we would actually be here before we did I want to ask the question today what did Jesus really mean when he said behold I come quickly when I was a teenager I was I was drawn to the Book of Revelations I I I read that book more than any other book in the Bible and I was just I was raised in a uh a a a a church and and they didn't really get into the the whole word and so I would read this book and I'll tell you this book used to scare me it really scared me if I could say it like this it it kind of put the fear of God in Me it helped me to think am I really ready to meet this God who's coming with such Vengeance I was in a helpless State I knew there was a Creator I prayed I could think he was a good God and that I was saved but I really didn't have that Blessed Assurance inside I would spend hours trying to make sense of the Book of Revelations and I I couldn't be sure what it all meant but I knew something inside of me just knew that it was true there was something inside that connected that the Bible was true I went to many churches and I Heard lots of men's ideas like John must have eaten some bad food before he went to bed that night before he when he wrote this or that he he had some bad dream and he was just expressing this bad dream but I want to share something with you today I actually found something that was missing in the Bible and that's your opinion your opinion my opinion our opinions don't mean anything to God and they shouldn't mean anything to one another If any man shall add unto the things these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in the book we certainly don't want to add our ideas even to our children we want to stay right with the words as if we don't know say I don't know and and we don't want to ignore some things that are scary or or that Jesus said that boy nobody preaches about that we don't want to ignore that because that's part of God's word right God never intended us to search out the truth by other men's opinions to know God through other men's opinions Jesus taught the people in John chapter 5 verse 39 search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me the scriptures are the only thing that anyone has in this world to know what truth is and what God really is for example have you ever wondered and I'm sure you have have you ever wondered how is God really going to judge everybody what's he G to judge Everybody by if he judges the whole world by the Catholic church then all the Protestants are lost if he judges the the whole world by uh the protest the Catholic if he judges the whole world by the the methodists by the Lutheran by the Baptists by the Pentecostals and I'm sure we've all wondered what's God really how's he gonna judge us because we all got to face that day right the Bible says it's appointed unto men once to die and then the judgment is he going to put our Good Deeds on one side of the scale and our bad Deeds on the other side just kind of to balance it out is he going to choose the church with the most members how is he going to judge us well we could get our phone out and do a Google search or we could read about some famous author or or or or listen to some scholar and see what he said oh or we can take the words that Jesus said and search the scriptures they tell us John CH 12: 46 John 12: 46 Jesus said I am come a light into the world and whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness and if any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not those are be comforting words if that was the end of the message Jesus for I came not to judge the world but to save the world that's the purpose of his first coming he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day so even though God's not down here pointing fingers and judging people and and and and condemning people to hell that's not his motive his motive was to come and save us to provide a way for us to get there yet his word is true and one day we'll have to come to accountability with this word not a different word not with somebody's opinion about the word not not works not Deeds but exactly what the Bible says and so I say what any question you have about life the answer is in the word of God opinions carry very little weight certainly it would be foolish for a man to rest his soul on the opinion of another man Even his own opinion that's probably the most dangerous is our own opinion because we have so much confidence in our opinion the problem is even when we're wrong when we find out we're wrong about our opinion we still got the same amount of confidence in our opinions like we don't learn that our opinion is just an opinion like anybody else's opinion the only thing that really matters is God's word and it's more than just an opinion Jesus said three times in the Bible Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall never pass away I think that was important for us to know that God's word is not just another opinion it's an absolute the Bible says my word shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please have you ever met anybody that if they said something you couldn't count on it and some people more than others well you can count on God's word it is never ever ever never ever failed and it can't fail because God can't fail he is the only thing that's perfect that's why we all can be in one mind in one Accord and agreeing with our Lord Jesus Christ so what did Jesus mean when he said surely I come quickly just as this building wasn't ready to move in uh when before we did Jesus will not return until every member of the body is ready to go home this church building had to get things up to cold before we could move in and the Church of the Living God needs to get things up to God's Bible cold before it can go home and that's the absolute we uh had rules and regulations I just want to say God bless the Tyrone Township who can who's here from the Tyrone Township just stand for just a second just you two I just want to say God bless you and to all the group there that takes care of our little Township they it's it's almost a thankless job because they're constantly dealing with problems trying to keep people happy they have to stay with the rules and people don't like the rules and so we're very grateful for them and grateful that they've allowed us to have this little church here but when we had to bring things up to cold here and we we thought we were done and and we got an inspector to come out and give us an inspection and he said well this needs to be changed and this this needs to be changed and this isn't right and no matter how bad I wanted to move in I couldn't because it wasn't up the cold yet and I had to fix those things and no matter how bad we want to go to heaven no matter how bad we we think we're ready if this code book says there's something in our lives that needs to get in order we need to get it in order because we can't go home before them Jesus said in Matthew 22:44 therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh he's not going to tell everybody ahead of time on the news Fox News CNN the newspapers the radio our our favorite musicians our our favorite movie stars our our neighbors our mom and dad no he gives man a chance speaks to their heart gives them a chance to get ready and it's at that point that we make a choice We Can Make A wise choice and get ready stay ready or we can take our own opinion over the word of God and say well I still got time I would imagine there are quite a few people began to lose interest about when we were going to open because they thought when you put a sign up opening soon it usually happens pretty quick maybe they were thinking well it's they're just they're taking so long it just lose interest like a lot of people wondering when Jesus is going to return or it didn't seem like very much progress was being done from the outside maybe some thought that they changed their mind something went wrong maybe some thought that they actually delayed their coming just like they thought about the return of Jesus second Peter chapter 3 vers vers one this Second Epistle beloved I write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance that ye may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of The Commandments of us the Apostles of our Lord and savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own desires and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation and I just wonder how many people in this world have read in the Bible where Jesus said behold I come quickly and they thought everything has remained the same since he said those words where is he surely I come quickly where is he the sign has been out there it's exactly where God ordained it to be Jesus said in Matthew 24:36 but of that day and hour knoweth no man not even the angels in heaven but my father only no man knows just God can you imagine if he would have told the angels all the Angels when he was going to come at the be at the beginning before the before the before a third of the Angels fell what they would have done with that information there's a reason that God had held on to it and he don't need to tell me come on and he don't need to tell you but we do need to receive the message he's coming and be ready amen that's all that matters that our heart wants to be ready that we put forth effort we search the scriptures Lord what do I need to do to be ready because it's contained in the scriptures all that we need to do to be ready I don't want us I wouldn't want I don't advise anybody to listen to a man his opinion to tell you what you need to do to get ready don't do that that's just a man's opinion you make sure that what's being spoken to you is scriptural read it for yourself in the Bible I remember when I was young playing hide-and seek and those that had to whose turn it was to find those that were hiding they would say ready or not here I come but Jesus is coming ready or not he's coming for those who are ready that puts a responsibility on us you just can't be sitting out there everybody's trying to hide and you're just out there well whatever because soon as he comes out and says ready or not and he opens his eyes you're going to be there and you're going to get caught it's a responsibility of all of us to be ready Oh Brother John how do I know if I'm ready what do I do where do I go what do I say how can I be assured this is the only book you need you spend time praying say God help me to understand because this God he hid this from the wise and prudent right but he has such a heart for those that love him he reveals it to just babes so if your heart is Lord I just want to know I just want to be pleasing not some some news but I don't want to miss it Lord the Bible Code tells us that God cannot lie God doesn't speak things halfhazard or just to get a laugh out of somebody or just vainly say things if God has spoken something you can Bank on it it's absolutely 100% true God's word is infallible it's the only book The Only book that's infallible it's the only thing in this corrupted society that man can count on the world is full of Darkness today it's falling apart very fast they're always saying new and improved products even if they knew and improved it last year they knew improved it again they want they want you to buy it because it's new and improved now they're saying they they have a new and improved government that they want to give us look at the News That's presented to us whatever news that we heard last month they're giving us new news this month which contradicts the news that they had last month by the way yet every time they're presenting it they're presenting it in such a way that it's facts that they couldn't be wrong they're ignoring the fact that they're always changing the facts and we get so warped in our thinking to think this is the way life is and you can never know and so when you read the Bible you go to church or you're you're listening to some sermon you get the same thing well maybe this is or maybe this isn't when we're hearing the word of God it is absolutely the truth when you're hearing an opinion about the word then you got to back up then you got to watch but we should all have such a confidence in the word of God God wants us to believe in him to know that he's able to protect his own word so you could have a way to make it you shall know the truth Jesus said and the truth shall make you free you can't count on what the you hear in the world you can't count on what the government's doing more and more PE the world is doubting the government they're questioning the FBI the CIA the CDC the FDA or any of man's alphabets because it's all man-made we don't want what the world is profing assigned to us it just brings confusion depression it doesn't help us at all doesn't give us any comfort any confidence we need God's true prophecy right here this is what we need we need the good news it's God's c book and it's the only book that God will go by the only one that God goes by is his word every he said every man's a liar turn with me if you would to Second Peter chapter 1 verse 19 second Peter chapter 1 vers 19 we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where unto you do well that you take heat as unto a light that shineth in a dark place and when you walk into a room it's dark you go for that light switch why because you don't want to stumble you don't want to run into something and when that light comes on behold you can see but we have a a more sure word of Prophecy right here this is the light for our lives for whatever is going on in our personal lives this is the light and the more that we we put God first in our life who cares about what do you think I got going in my life and what do you think I should do and and what do you think it does not matter trust God that he will lead and guide you acknowledge the Lord in all the ways and he shall direct thy paths until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first first that no Prophecy of the scriptures is of any private interpretation or opinion it doesn't matter what I think and I'm glad it says knowing this first let's we got to have a good foundation right who would want to go to a church that says you don't have to do anything and you're going to heaven that church would be full people the the people who are not thinking straight that is no we need a foundation and the foundation is we have no business giving our own interpretation to the word of God no opinion scripture interprets scripture you ever been reading instructions on how to put something together and if you're like me most of the time you just want to show you can do it without the instructions well I put on many falsehoods in my life and I put one on the other day and I couldn't figure out what this thing goes to and I had to go back to the instructions what good would it do to call Jason who's never seen it or ask Mark who's never put one together or ask my wife it doesn't matter what I think the scripture says now I know it may sound like boy brother John why would I want to come here you're talking like that because what I'm trying to get you to do is understand that this church is not built on a man if they can't be backed up by the scriptures we don't want nothing to do with it we got to stay with the cold book The the instructions of how to build the Statue of a perfect man we got to build properly the the foundation here the knowing this first that we can't inject our ideas to what the board says for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of a man how many times you heard this in life oh man just wrote that for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost moved how many want God to move you I want God to move in my life I want God to direct my life I want God to supply my needs I want God to move in my life if God's going to move in my life I got to get out of the way I got to die out to my thinking and and doing things what I think because God ain't going to share his glory with me that's right amen is that going to share his glory with any of us so the key to having the Holy Ghost move in US Direct our life is to Humble ourselves before him die out and say Lord open my eyes that I can see show me the way this book called the Bible is not outdated it is up to date his coming is not old news his coming is going to happen very soon surely I come quickly he's coming quickly the foundation of this church is the Bible from cover to cover not some opinion about the Bible but exactly the Bible the foundation of Our Lives ought to be the same from cover to cover and not our opinion it's so dangerous when we inject our opinion and I'll tell you how terrible our first nature is we're born always thinking we're right born from our parents and when our parents say don't do that that'll hurt you well our opinion is much better and much more accurate and if we want another cookie we know we're right and you know what we'll put our deceiving deceptive abilities to work and wait till Mom goes in the other room and then we'll get what we got to get because we think we're right if we could have no confidence in what we think about the word in our opinions and we could put all our confidence that God will show us clearly and plainly those things that we do not understand it would gain so much more in Christ now I'm not saying God has not revealed anything to us because he has the very purpose that you're here today is that you believe in God but there's so many things that have not yet been revealed to us and sometimes I know the tendency is when we only hear part of the story we want to interpret the rest of the part that's a dangerous thing what we need to do is continue to search the scriptures continue to pray continue to come to church continue to seek out the truth because Jesus said You shall search me you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all of your heart he just looking for the heart he get your heart boy you got Jesus that's the mate right there it's your heart and his heart not long ago we just we preached on a God just wanted a family he wants a family this book is the only book that tells us who we are where we came from and where we're going it's the only book that tells us the hour We're living here in 2021 what's supposed to be happening this book called the Bible is God's good news to the world it shines a light no no matter what hour we're living in that's the beautiful thing whether it's through the Dark Ages whether it's in the 18th century the the 20th century now this book tells us where we're at Paul speaking prophetically to Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter 3 verse one about the the days that we're we're living in today said this know also that in the last last days how many thinks were in last days let me see your hands keep them up there keep them up there okay praise the Lord so we're all on the same page here we're in the last days he describes the last days as perilous times perilous times Paul doesn't describe anything about a fallen economy disasters global warming deadly strains of viruses or a new world order but yet he calls it perilous times he describes it as a Godless spiritual condition that's what he describes this verse two for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous bolsters proud blasphemies disobedient to parents unthankful you ever seen a time where people are so unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers man you can't turn on the news without hearing one station criticize another station incontinent fears despisers of those that are good boy there was such a hatred I don't want to get into you know you live in the world but you see this Spirit the spirit of this all around us traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God still love God I love pleasure more these are spiritual signs of his coming as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot we are in that hour this is the condition that the church world has gotten into they have kick God right out of the church he's no longer no longer welcomed in the church think about that how can a church kick out God when you kick the word out you kick God out but they think he's still there but he's not so what is he doing he's knocking on man's heart an individual Church Affair if I could say it like that and he wants to come in but you know what if Jesus comes in he's bringing his word with him they've kicked out God and they've replaced it with man's opinion they've replaced it with entertainment they've replaced it with just come to church and feel good what about what's on God's heart they've replaced the leadership of the Holy Ghost with the intellectualism of man having Church Without God being the head of the church he said surely I come quickly God is the head of his church and not man let's drop down to verse 13 but evil men in the last days and seducers they're going to wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived now doesn't that the way that you feel in the in the world when you're listening to news right there nobody can trust anybody for the life of me I don't understand why we still watch the stuff why we're still listen toing it as if we're going to be able to make sense of it but it's not just happening in the world it's happening in the church world right The Same Spirit comes in because the devil what's the the goal of the devil to keep man from going to heaven that's it what's the what's the goal of God to to make a way that men would be saved just keeping it simple the devil's always telling man oh you don't have to follow all of God's word oh it's it's okay to partake of the tree of knowledge of goodness you're going to be just like God you're going to know everything but evil men and seduce yourself wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou has learned them and that from a child thou has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith in Jesus Christ we've got to believe in the scriptures that they are the absolute our Salvation all scripture all scripture is given by the inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works amen did not Jesus say that he's coming quickly and his reward is with him to give every man according to his works well if we follow this word and our works become this word I believe you we have a great reward amen surely I come quickly God cannot lie he's coming soon when we leave today I want to encourage you to search the scriptures to continue to search the scriptures there's biblical signs all around us that we're living in the hour of his return 1 Thessalonians chapter 4:1 16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead shall rise first the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord I love these the scriptures here wherefore wherefore Comfort one another with these words amen surely I come quickly these words should bring a comfort to us the holy spirit is saying coming but who else is saying coming the bride something inside God's people wants Jesus to come I mean let's just face it we're a natural being and we're a spiritual being we're a spiritual being that lives in a body is it really the proper way of saying it part of us doesn't want Jesus to come right now because of XY but the spiritual part of us the part that's ready to meet Jesus that submitted their life completely to him wants Jesus to come quickly in fact they're sighing and crying for the Abominations that are done in the city you just can't watch anything on TV without seeing something terrible something perverted it's no longer I Love Lucy it's I love have a good one doesn't matter but the bride is wanting to celebrate that he's coming soon Revelations 19:7 we're closing here let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready there's a celebration amen it's it's a it's a spiritual or an invisible Union taking place with the bride of Christ and Jesus himself now we're going to meet corporately in the the Bible says but before that happens the spirit that's inside man and the spirit of God are meeting and the bride's character is becoming more like Jesus all the time we're just not looking for a day that's going to happen and hope we make the date but each day that bride is looking for an opportunity that they could display more of the character of Jesus Christ we don't just believe in a day that we'll be caught up together we believe in in what it takes to get ready for that day may the Lord Jesus bless you let's stand together he which testify these things surely I come quickly even so come Lord Jesus and he says the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be be with you all how many desire the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ amen he's coming soon very soon don't let any other Spirit try to tell you that he's not or that you know more than what the word says the word is our absolute we may not be able to interpret it properly right because the word is of no private interpretation but the god interprets his word by bringing it to pass when he brings it to pass that is the perfect interpretation of the word we just believe it when Jesus was on Earth and he was talking to the people he wouldn't say do you understand do you got it figured out he say Do you believe only believe all things are possible he's coming soon leave here with the thought that he's coming soon God will take care of the rest of the thoughts that you think about he just wants us to get ready amen I believe that's why God put this little church here is to help us to get ready for his coming amen let's sing he's coming soon he's coming soon amen oh my we maybe we weren't per I also want to thank the Lord Jesus for my wife
