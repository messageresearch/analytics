all that you've done for us in our lives we worship you we praise you this morning Lord we we thank you for your presence Among Us Lord the presence of your spirit that we feel here among us all we thank you for it we praise you for it today Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord Jesus Praise You Lord Praise You amen God is good God is good to us just to to visit us with his presence and confirm he has risen and he's alive and he's here to help us and just when his presence comes it just gives us strength and we're grateful to the Lord for that may God bless each and every one of you this morning as you come to his house may he bless you real good but I pray there be a special blessing for our mothers I I it's it's hard this one day to say Happy Mother's Day when they really deserve so much and uh I just say God bless you mothers God bless you grandmothers uh Grand God because you got to step in sometimes even with the grandkids and once you're a mother you're always a mother I say God bless you fathers who step in and help the mothers when the mothers aren't there they need help and there's a place for that that motherhood uh brother uh Daniel and and brother Gideon send their greetings to you this morning and brother Gideon sent this uh uh quote and I thought I would just read it this morning in honor to the mothers and to all of us who really need to honor our mothers amen I respect and honor you there with your red roses on speaking of the mothers your mother if you want to do anything for her do it 365 days a year go to her house and offer prayer and live for God that's the thing to do and bring up your children and when your children come up they'll call you blessed after you have passed on Beyond the Veil that's the real Spirit of motherhood the real Spirit of a Mother's Day Mother's Day is 365 days a year this is the day that they sell flowers and past presents the world does if it passes if the world should stand another 20 years they'll have a Son's Day A Daughter's day and a cousin's day and uncle's day we know there's always more new days right and all of them things like that just enough to get the world in a commercial glamor that's just where it's going right into hell just as hard as it can go to destruction amen praise the Lord God bless our mothers I just want to give them a hand clapping today amen honestly it's the least we can do praise God you know sometimes we as mothers don't always feel like a mother like a good mother but you've got to deny those thoughts and know that you have done your very very best where we have failed because we're human beings that just comes with the territory just the mere fact that you get up and try it again says you've done your best amen turn with me if you would this morning to the book of First Samuel chapter 12. and before we begin reading here we should just look to the author and ask for him to bless her eyes in our hearts this morning our heavenly father we come to you this morning unworthy to stand in your presence Lord trust that we are all clothed with humility this morning just waiting upon you to come and Grant to us the request of our heart some of us Lord hear a Desiring a closer walk with you some have a a need Lord that's particular to them Lords some are looking for leadership and guided some are looking for healing some are looking for deliverance some are looking for a restoration Lord we come with various needs we Lord perhaps even the needs of someone on our heart Lord I know that you're able to meet every need according your wishes and Glory I pray through the to the ministry of the word that Faith would take a hold of whatever promise would be needed for each one this morning Lord you're able to do exceedingly far above all that we could ask or even think of you doing we're leaning upon you and trusting you this morning Lord as we've opened the your word the Bible Lord we ask that you would now open our eyes and our understanding Lord that you would help us to recognize you in the unveiling of your word and I pray that you withdraw us all closer to you this morning that when we would leave here we could all say within our hearts it was good to be in the house of the Lord today Father we thank you for these things we commit now ourselves into your hands receive Glory and Honor we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen first Samuel chapter 12 starting with verse number 22. for the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake because it have pleased the Lord to make you his people moreover as for me God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you but I will teach you the good and the right way only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he have done for you God bless you may be seated like to entitle this message amazed I just want to brag a little bit about Jesus this morning consider how great things he has done for us you know we're living in a world that makes it very difficult for us to focus on the Lord and we need to remember that we're not a part of the world Jesus said I am not of the world he said in John 18 36 my kingdom is now this worth my kingdom world of this world then would my servants fight so he made it real clear that he wasn't a part of the world even though that he loved the world he gave himself for the souls he himself is not apart God has called us out of the world to separate us he said wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the Lord so there's a calling out and Deuteronomy he says he have has chosen us to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the Earth and he said in his prayer in John chapter 17 I pray not that thou shouldest take them speaking of us them out of the world but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil so here we are he he just like he placed the children of of uh Daniel and and the three Hebrew children in Babylon he placed them in a worldly ungodly place and he didn't God's desire at that point was not to take him out of there but to leave them there and be an example amen that we can serve God in an ungodly time that they are not of the world even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou has seen set me into the world even so I also send them into the world so God wants to send us back into the world that he's not a part of that he doesn't want us to be a part of but he sends us back into the world for a purpose and that is to get those that are in the world out of the world once again Jesus is clearly identifying the separation from the world and John says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in them for all that the that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life I'll tell you every one of those we battle it's not of the father but it's of the world so notice right here inside of us is the enemy that's drawing us and trying to get our attention for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the part of life is not of the father of the world the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever we're stuck in this world some Believers are stuck in this world without a purpose and a vision and that is the most difficult thing because now you're constantly battling things with nothing to push forward into they really don't hear the voice sending them out to win a soul because if that becomes your focus now you're not as distracted you will be distracted but you're not as distracted because you're focused on a purpose this world can take a real toil on us all the pressures the problems all the things that we face we got problems financial problems sometimes sometimes we've got car problems sometimes we got furnace problems tax problems sometimes it's too hot in church and sometimes it's too cold sometimes we got marital problems relationship problems problems at work problems with the family all these problems create a pressure right right makes it very difficult to consider God service well do things to try to fix things we become overwhelmed that we just can't even see straight we need this problem taken care of and it makes it difficult to see God no matter how we try to escape we can try to outrun the pressures but they're there we can even try taking a little vacation but when we come back they're there sometimes we go somewhere and then we find out they're there where we went sometimes we'll try a little entertainment to get the stuff off our mind and that helps a temporary fix sometimes but you know after that's done we're back dealing with the pressures again this world as we know it is experiencing a pressure that is never seen before and eventually it's going to pop into the Great Tribulation fear is dominating the world men's hearts are failing for fear anxiety seems to be the new Norm in people's lives it's no longer do you have an anxiety it's how much anxiety you're dealing with the scale the love of many people is getting colder and colder that if they do find any love it's it's just a little and it's for themselves this world is spowing downward and I'll say it it's taking a lot of people with it you've all seen in a drain where things go down in the drain what's ever around can go go with that drain and we've got to fight against the grain amen even though we're not a part of the world it's still making havoc on our lives I believe we all struggle with things we're all struggling to overcome the things that we're dealing with right none of us are exempt from it I'm sure at times that we all feel that that we have at the hardest and sometimes you do for a season but just just wait a little bit and somebody's got it harder than you you don't got to look very far but when we stop to consider God that's the thing that we need to do is to stop and consider God we can't wait for things to get better in this world this world is not getting better and this world is cruel it may not get better for us but yet we need to stop and consider god consider how great he is in our lives and when we do I believe we'll be amazed count your blessings see what God have done it will surprise you when we stop and just turn Our Eyes Upon Jesus look just look into his face it melts you maybe the picture can't always be there but if you just close your eyes you'll see them when we get down to pray it and just get our minds cleared out from all the things that we've been dealing with I'm amazed of what happens on the inside of me and I'm sure you feel the same way I want you to know I want you uh it is not me breaking up here I want you to Brave with me he's uh he's your Jesus too amen but when we stop to consider God it's always amazing another he stopped long enough and consider him long enough if you focus long enough and you keep your mind on him he will keep you in perfect peace it can't be one of these quick thoughts okay I had to do my prayers I got to do this and everything's going to be okay no we're facing a devil who's attacking us and we need to keep our minds on him peace will not be gifted to anybody you can say Amen to that but it will be rewarded to whosoever will dare to slow down and consider God enough [Music] he has a peace that passeth all understanding [Music] for me I'll take peace over any knowledge I don't need to figure it out I don't need to understand why people do what they do I'll take peace any day of the week above any understanding I could get [Music] mad it seems like the devil's always there trying to say why why why why why why trying to get you to get involved in figuring out his espanage right true but all you need is peace amen amen because you don't need to figure anything out you just need to have the God of Peace With You the peace of God living in you that's what we need in this hour how many times have you try to figure something out you did figure it out and you still didn't have peace the devil's always trying to take you down a bunny trail what he's doing is he's trying to get you away from the god that can keep you he is our peace he's the Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father the counselor and he will give peace if your heart is at a place where you slow down and consider him that's always wanting he's wanting you to consider him and then he gives you peace amen you going outside of the boundary of him in any fashion formal way I I wouldn't be looking for peace to come when peace resides in my heart there's such a power that Satan's attacks do not bring you down now we've all been attacked and we know what it's like to be attacked it ain't fun and how Satan usually gets us is when something is done wrong to us and we say that wasn't right that wasn't fair this shouldn't happen they knew better and he sets this real clear aren't you with me on this aren't you with me and then of course when we say yeah that's that's true all sudden we get bothered and then and then the only way we can get peace is get the things straightened out the way we think it should get straightened out and then even after we straighten out we still don't got peace but that's the way the devil is I'll say when you get the peace of God there's such a power inside of you you are not moved you are not Disturbed you are not worried you are not concerned because you have placed yourself in the hands of God consider him don't consider your problems consider him when peace resides I'm amazed I stand In Awe I I stand back and I say God I don't understand what's going to happen I don't know how it's going to happen I don't know what my future is but God I'm amazed because of the peace of God I feel right now amen amen those Hebrew children were they were facing the furnace you talk about having to to have God on on the on the on the on the spot right it wasn't like well let's go home and think about this for a few days it was do or die you make your decision there was something inside of them I'm not sure what he's going to do but I'll tell you what I ain't bowing down there's a piece of God that's inside of me my decision has been made I'm going to serve the Lord I'm going to love him all the days of my life I will follow him no matter what and I believe that peace kept them in that hour what kept Daniel in that from going to that Lion's Den when he pushed those doors open it was the peace of God in his heart God wasn't standing there with some sort of Sword it could no It's A Love Affair true love affair I don't want a life with horrible things in it but if I have to have a life that has horrible things that happen in it I want the peace of God to keep me his choice what he wants to do you ever just been going through something and you get alone with God and you begin to cry and bathe in his presence and you're you feel so secure brother Mark you're in that Refuge Brother Joseph you're in that City of Refuge and all is well even though it's going like this on the outside in here all is well but if you don't take time to consider God God will not gift you peace because of what you're going through and if you're not feeling it it doesn't mean God don't love you and it doesn't mean God don't care but God wants to be first in your mind first in your heart first in your thoughts he wants to be represented as number one in your life Philippians chapter 4 verse 4 turn with me if you would to here we know these scriptures but it Bears repeating as we're talking a little bit about the peace of God rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice well what about what about what no read the word rejoice in the lord always and again uh say rejoice I've already done it Rejoice again just keep rejoicing keep counting your blessings keep your mind on him this is the important ingredient to going from where you're at to where God is calling you to God is calling you to be at peace let your moderation that means your mildness your gentleness let it be made known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing don't be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God do you ever notice when somebody is complaining to you there's no thankfulness in it they're just Benton they're just complaining but notice when God wants us to come to him not about when God wants us to come to him and we've got this anxious feeling he doesn't want us to be anxious because the only time you're going to be anxious is when something's bothering you is that right and he said do all things without murmuring and complaining so when he we come to God we got our needs he doesn't want us anxiously bringing the knees with complaining look what's going on in my life Lord he wants us to come to him as we know he's going to take care of it [Music] amen so we come with a Thanksgiving Lord I'm glad I'm coming to the source that can help me with my needs amen then make your request known to God so you're properly approaching God just the way that Esther would and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus not through you figuring it out not through you orchestrating the way you think it needs to go not by you intervening but by you subjecting yourself to God and trusting God we'll do the work amen he will keep you now this promise isn't that he's going to work everything out the way you want it Right This Promise is he's going to keep you through it all and I'll tell you I take that over any day over anything over every need being provided by every human being that could help me because there's things coming in our life that nobody can help us God will put you in a position that you know God is the only one that can help you and at that moment what we need is God why does God give you peace look every time there was a need God just come over and okay you need this you need this you need everything everything pretty soon which is give me give me give me don't need nothing but imagine that he gave you peace instead of giving you what you wanted what would you rather have you know they were all fronting the disciples were all frightened because Jesus was leaving he says don't let your heart be troubled look I I'm I'm I will come I'm going to send you the comforter my father will send you the comforter that he may abide in you it'll no longer be me here comforting you from the outside with a hug but praise God I'll be on the inside of you I'll be hugging your heart I'll be right there with you invisible but we know it's him I'm so glad that I'm so grateful for Calvary that today I can be with Jesus and that Jesus can be with me and is so real in my heart that no there's nothing can mind it away the peace of God is so strong in our lives that nothing can shake us gifts and callings are without repentance but peace will not be gifted to us there will need to be a strong consciousness of keeping God on your mind do you believe that amen verse 8 says finally Brethren whatsoever things are true honest just pure lovely things of a good report let there be any virtue they're in Praise think on these things the way you think your attitude your conversation has to pass a very hard exam well brother John I'm thinking up because it's true they just hit me right in the side of the face well they just used me brother John they made me go on a third mile to help them it's a true thing and I just want to think about it well is it lovely is your is it pure is there any strength about what you're thinking about does it is it giving you strength to want to serve them more does it make you want to praise God then why are you thinking on it we can't expect to let this go any way we want to go because we're in control of it and then expect God to move on your behalf on the scene we got to recognize it is the devil that's trying to bring you down it's trying to spiral you downhill and you've got to stop him in his tracks that's something that God will not gift anybody he's not going to come and just take over your mind just because you wish him to he set you out in a battle and he expects you to pick up the sword he expects you to put the helmet of salvation he expects you to put that Shield up to quench all the fiery dust of the devil and if we are going to be lazy and sit in the back and it just doesn't matter don't expect God to gift you with peace he is here he's given us the remedy but we've got to stand his soldiers and fight the good fight of faith we have to Ace this test I mean Ace it from one side to the other to have peace reside in your life those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen to me do and the God of Peace shall be with you that's right um how many can stand and testify I have felt the peace of God in my life what a testimony it's what God wants to see he's amazing God has been faithful to keep peace in my life it's all the turmoil that's happened with all the needs that I've had sometimes it just seems like there's no remedy but he's kept me not in a turmoil not in a frenzy now that I gotta call every single person I know to but something on the inside holds me it's between me and God I'm amazed at the power that there is just in the peace of God he's a very present help in a time of trouble sometimes the way the Lord helps us you know we got all these needs and we want the Lord to help us sometimes the the way that he chooses to help us is just give us peace doesn't take care of the situation the way we want it to but he gives you peace that's a present help in a time of trouble you know we're expecting God to do this that and the other and God may want to help you in another way but he's still a present help in a time of need [Music] I'm amazed of how problems in life can make us feel so overwhelmed and God then takes those problems as opportunities to give you peace to show he cares about you to show that hey I know you don't know what's going on but I've got this thing orchestrated just wait for the part of the song to come and you'll see it all come together until then I have something for you peace I leave with you not as the world give out peace unto you God has a peace that will surpass every situation [Music] the Bible says Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind has stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee you're trusting in the Lord God is ready much bigger than all of our problems I'm amazed of how God takes care of us I really am we take so much for granted whatever you have you you can have a tendency of taking it for granted people you've heard this people that actually went through the Great Depression even if they got everything paid they got lots of money finally they still live in in such a way because of how the tribulation a Great Tribulation no great depression thank you thank you I'm so grateful to you all that really know what I'm saying without me having to say it it just takes a lot of pressure off me but you see things can lay an influence on us and if it wasn't for God in our lives taking care of us we would have no anchor honestly but he has brought us through so many things and he's much bigger than all of our problems we do not have to depend on herself we have to do our job but we don't have to depend on ourselves my God shall supply all of your need according his riches and Glory forget about you having to do it you'll fall flat on your face over and over I've talked to men who have tried they have had businesses I I've spent time with people trying and telling me they're trying and things aren't working and you know what they're depending on themselves and I believe God wants us to do our part no doubt about it but God wants to be first in your life God wants us to depend on him I'm amazed at how faithful God really takes care of us I'm amazed that there's only one thing that it requires of us and that's to put him first I'll do I'll handle everything I'll do everything I'll take care of everything put me first Jesus said our heavenly father knows what you have need of but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you amen what a promise um I'm amazed that he takes my problems and produces opportunity to give me peace and to meet my needs he may not give me what I want but he gives me what I need cast all your care upon him for he careth for you you ever cast your care in somebody you almost like complain you know what I'm talking about you shouldn't have I need come on who wants to go with me on this who wants me to just bypass this part of the situ this part of the sermon God wants us to cast our cares on him he cares for you more than any other human being can care for you he's he's a friend that's ticking culture than a brother God will arrange that you have to look to him even if there's somebody that has helped you uh a thousand times in life God doesn't like it that you don't depend on him and he will arrange it he will make it to where you have to look to him amen Saul let's just take the word cast your cares upon Him He cares for you God's long suffering it's incredible how many has been a beneficiary of the long-sufferings of God he waited 120 years in the days of Noah he's waiting right now for the cup of iniquity to be full he is patiently waited for us when for us to surrender our heart even now when God wants us to do something he waits and often suffers a long time until we do the thing that we need to do and I'm amazed at how long-suffering God is to me now look back and I say what what were you thinking what were you doing what was going on Mercy rewrote my life [Music] if it wasn't for God we wouldn't be here and I know that things could be better I understand that we look at our lives we we look at our homes we look at our we haven't reached the goal of so many things have interfered but I'm telling you if it wasn't for the grace of God we would all be out just serving our own flesh in any way we we wouldn't even care about being in the house of God we wouldn't care about our brothers and sisters God's patience is amazing Jesus said in your patience possess your souls well brother John what do I need to do that for my soul was saved do you possess it you got control of what's going on possessing your soul is not easy it takes time patience learning to yield to the Lord so we need to get rid of that and I don't know the terminology once saved always say once free doesn't always predest I say you know my soul is taken care of I don't have to worry about we need to get rid of that thinking amen it has its place but as soon as you take the word out of its place then it don't keep you and what we're looking for is something to keep us in the center of his will in the center of the word in the center of pleasing him and pressing in towards that hi Colleen amen more patience is one thing that we all could benefit from do you believe that nobody likes to go through trials I understand but we do need patience right I was talking to a man just yesterday and one of the needs that he had was is that he just needed patience we all need patience from time to time we all could benefit to have more patience we all have said I wish I would have bit my tongue I wish I won the bit my lit I wish I would have bit my lip I wish I I wouldn't have said something I wish I would have just been quiet I'm amazed how God can take what we're lacking in our lives and make our lives more complete with just patience with just patience Hebrews 10 36 says for ye have need of patience how many years need of patience after that you have done the will of God you might receive the promise there is a will of God for all of our Lives amen James says knowing this that the Trine of your faith work with patience but let patients have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing God can take what we're lacking and make us whole we never think about it like that we think I can't be whole till I get what I want till I get this thing straight to this to this to this then I can be whole no you need to let patience have its perfect work and that will make you whole wanting nothing amen I'll take that any day over having to have every situation right I'll tell you I don't know how you older brothers sisters feel but I wish I had half the wisdom that I have now when I was young raising my children I think I feel like I would have did a better job but that doesn't mean I would have I didn't say that but I do know I've heard this many times I wish I had the wisdom that I have now that it that when I was younger because you could apply those things but just take the wisdom from above that's James is talking to us about just let patients have its own way amen amen it's working something working something we're so quick to straighten things up we need to be quick to trust God quick to lean on him quick to say God Have Your Way in this situation and because of that trust a peace comes into your heart I love the word of God I love that we have something to direct Our Lives I have something that can be applied to our lives to make it more real I don't want God just on the outside I want God on the inside taking care of the inside amen I'm amazed how he can take nothing and make something out of it amen he took the Earth that was without form and void and he made the beauty that you and I behold the the all the animals and the the plants and all the things we see and we look at we just take a moment we go wow that is awesome looking just taking the time to consider and it all started with nothing and that's our God he can take nothing and make something with him he can take our lives that was without form without void it was just a nature full of sin and selfishness and didn't care about anything and he can make a beautiful life out of it he can make it to where people look at you and they don't see you anymore they see Jesus Christ in you they see something you couldn't do it would take the power of God to create such a beautiful nature I love the word I'm amazed of what he's done in my life don't you feel that way it's not bragging about you it's breaking about God changing you and you need to declare it you need to publish it you need to give God thanks and glory for what he's done in your life amen that was our opening scripture we can't go back and just you know while we're saved and now we're just going to deal with everything on our own no God's now coming around before God came in our life we did everything right we paid our bills we went to work we out fought our argued we did whatever we had to do to deal with life the way we thought it needed to be dealt with but then God comes into our life he makes it beautiful he makes all things beautiful in his time we start handling things the way God handles things Ephesians chapter 2 turn with me if you would wow I'm half done with three quarters of the time gone this means not only do you need to listen real good you need to pray that it speeds up Ephesians 2 we've walked according verse 2 to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the Earth the spirit that now worketh and the children of Disobedience so this Spirit was in you that's not in you now but now it's in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversations in times past in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of our flesh and of our mind and we're by Nature the children of anger upset Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead and our sins have quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and his race is up together made us to sit in this one place in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness towards us and he's doing it through Jesus Christ for by grace are you safe through faith and it's not of yourself it is the gift of God he gives it to whomsoever will repent I believe that with all my heart it's not of Works lest any man should boast for we are the workmen we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works notice what we're created unto no longer working for ourselves but living for others which God have before ordained that we should actually walk in them now we heard a little bit about God's Great Masterpiece Jesus Christ the other night but God is a great master builder in our lives and he's building Us in that same image as Jesus Christ and are built upon the foundation the Apostles of the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building that's all of us Saints are fitly framed together amen did you you ever like something kind of like broke and you're trying to piece it back together and sometimes you could just like you know exactly how it goes back together just just like the Chinese ticket it just goes together and this is it and then sometimes we've had to pick some pieces up and try to put it together we can't quite it's just not matching you think it goes here but something's missing God doesn't want a church that's having a hard time working together well it's just not fitting into my idea well I don't care about your idea and you shouldn't really care about we need to Endeavor to keep the unity of the spirits and it it takes work I'll tell you what has made me so successful a lot in life is learning that I can yield to others I can yield to somebody else I don't have to brother Stan knows this he's one of the easiest men to work with for has been for me you don't have to do things my way but we are going to do them together so that means if I have to yield I will yield and if we learn to have that christ-like nature see God's the same way he'll give us his will he'll say this is the way walkie in it right but if you choose not to he'll let you go he'll let you build your life do your thing whatever you want to do right but somewhere down the road it's not going to work because God's way is the right way God has taken nobodies like you and I and has made somebodies can you say Amen to that I don't want to hurry by his pride here but I can testify God has taken a nobody and made somebody I myself am nothing today just like I was then then I didn't have the knowledge and I thought it was somebody today I still know I'm a nobody but he can take this nobody and make somebody for his glory he has taken lives without character and he's brought character into them Jesus said you must be born again you must be born again you can't make it without being born again your old nature must die your hate must die and your love must be born Anew his love must be born Anew in you your old nature must rot his nature must come into your life amen it's not a do's and don'ts it is a is a surrendering of your life and having God's life come inside of you now that is a reality brothers and sisters and I don't know where you want to stand with this but I'll say it like this the Bride of Jesus Christ does not stop that process until she awakes in his likeness you think about job and how great a man he was and he was great in fact he testified to Satan he was perfect and there was none like him but I'll tell you what I liked about job he never acted like he was there like he he met and I don't have to do any more here's a man that was perfect and he still kept himself humble he still wanted to please God that's what I like about Paul and that's what I like about every spirit that yields himself to God second Corinthians 5 17 therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new Creature if anybody agrees with this word say amen amen you're not don't don't worry about me don't worry about me love the word amen love the word agree with the word you want to change in your life get into the word don't just say Amen because it's time to say Amen say Amen because you want it inside of you show God your hunger show them your thirst show them you mean business with him [Music] if you don't it'll be like water going off a deck's back you'll walk out of here God help us to receive the word this morning therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new all things well I'll tell you I don't gotta look very far in my life to see I need some new things so I'm going to press into that and all things are of God who have reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and given unto us the ministry of reconciliation man is this something Brother Joseph is this some plaque that I could just put on the wall I got the ministry of reconciliation or did he actually give me a responsibility because you know what I'd rather have the plaque you are written Epistles your life is now the plaque in demonstration reaching out for someone who's not as fortunate as you someone who's not living like you're living not doing and I'll tell you what even if 98 of their life is perfect God can use you to help two percent come on the Revelation that I got is that we're Christ to all people he has given us a responsibility to help every single person I'm amazed that he took my life it was full of corruption full of sin and in his hands he did something with it I could have been stuck like the world living for myself I could have been stuck in a church living for myself but he took my life and he took out that Spirit of selfishness right right and he showed me the real beauty of life is living for others it's a Ministry and it's not a eight to five Ministry it's a Ministry he does everything beautiful in his time and if there's something in your life that you would like to see God make more of him give him some more of your time spent some time in prayer Pray more read the word more just place that there and say God you know I'm not satisfied with this in my life and I want to see the beauty of your character in me and he will do it he will do it because it is a love affair and if you want it bad enough God will take every wrong desire out he'll take every selfish thing out and he'll make your whole life for others and as long as you say I think I'm doing pretty good the way I'm at Brother John the more chance you're going to have to stay right there Psalms 92 verse 4 says for thou Lord have made me glad through thy Work through thy Work in your life I will Triumph in the works of thy hands O Lord how great are thy works and how and thy thoughts are deep very deep and thy thoughts are very deep oh my God does not a shadow thinker about us people need the Lord God wants to work in people's life God wants to Triumph through the works of his hands to help people but people are bound with demons of self and it's sad that so many people have not found the true Liberty of living for others people want Liberty to do what they want but they're bound to their desires true Liberty is living for others true Liberty is doing the will of God true Liberty is having the right balance you know what I love this word and this morning you can love it with me or you can despise the truth that's up to you I thank God that He Set Me Free From Myself it's sad when you see people they're bound with more demons than they even realize because it's all about them life is all about them he that the son is set free is free indeed I'm amazed that God can take nothing and make something with it just as the devil can't do anything unless he's got a vessel to work through God can't do anything unless he's got a vessel to work through we are his hands his feet his mouth we are the expression of his desire helping one another and his heart of expressing life to others needs to be pulsating out of us all the time because God wants to take our time and use it if we only give him a little bit he'll only take and use a little bit but God wants all of our life amen yes we got to go to work yes we got to eat yes we got to have some family time but you know what God deserves your life he deserves to take your life and do what he wants to do with it how he's thankful for for God in your life he'll give his same nature that he has to you about caring for Souls the Bible says knowing the terror of the lord we persuade men and it is the love of God in his people that constrains them to reach out and help somebody I mean there's a lot of people that say come to my church I'll tell you what you give a little bit extra in the office and I'll tell you I'll play a I'll play a double portion upon you how about the man that'll give and give and give and not ask anything for in return that's the nature of our heavenly father when that nature comes inside of us we're expressing that same Ministry we're living out that Ministry that he's given us he's made us ambassadors to reconcile the whole world or as many as Paul said I became all things to all men that I might win some of them to Christ in the message Called Love brother man says I asked my wife not long ago I said I want to ask you something honey I said what is the real true value placed on I believe I told you the other night what the true value is he said nothing but lost Souls he said that's the real true value nothing but lost souls is the only thing that's got any value to it he said money passes away homes Decay and go away everything in Earth moves away the only value lasting value he said I'd rather have one soul in glory that I've won that I've won to Christ to know and see that light of God circling around that Soul through all eternity and my name being associated with that than to have every penny of money in this whole earth because I'd lose it all but you send but what you send there is eternal amen amen and that's the reason well I'm trying God is faithful if we can just have his mind long enough to care about the things that he cares about it's easy for me to go buy my fourth house my 16th boat my 34th car and say you know what God cares about me and what I want it's easy to say that it's easy to have that attitude but I tell you what you got to put the CL you got to put the Robes of humility on the clothes of humility to say not my will Lord but thy will be done God knows the true value in life how many of you been Amazed by God's faithfulness in your life yes [Music] but she's been so faithful to us his mercies are faithful we we've all needed deliverance from all sorts of things and we still do at times do you know what God's faithful to deliver us the Bible says if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness you talk about the beauty now we can walk outside and we don't have to worry about if I make a mistake I'm going to be eternally Damned because we know we have a loving father there that when we slip and fall he sees our hearts desire we get back up and we say Lord I'm so sorry I'm so sorry Lord I want to please you and he's right there not to hold that thing over your head right that's the faithfulness of our God Psalms 86 13 for great is thy mercy toward me and thou has delivered my soul from the lowest hell we've all had Red Sea experiences where just God came in her life and he took care of the situation the children of Israel couldn't do anything in their situation they they left the world and here they were led by the spirit of God they thought they were being chased but they were being led and as they were being led they were being chased by the devil and they were cornered between some Mountains and the Red Sea and there was no way out and God delivered yes amen and God does that in every one of our lives and we need to stop and consider how great our God is and if we just did that more instead of worried about this next problem we're dealing with and then the next problem we're dealing with and the next thing we're wanting and the next place we want to go and the next thing that we're we need to take time to consider God in our life that he is amazing and that we need to give him the glory and the honor and to praise all the time and let everything else go what happens when you start worrying about your next problem well as we got to do is look at the children of Israel when they got another site they were rejoicing they were happy they were excited but the more problems they encountered the more they murmured the more they complained the more they said we should just go back to I told Moses don't you do this are you with me and I'll tell you are we staying on the side of worship are we staying on the side of Praise are we staying on the side of Thanksgiving are we really considering how great our God is are we continuing to be bothered by things now look says God is trying to take us from where we're at to a place that we live Victorious over the devil the devil is under our feet not on our inner ears and on our shoulders and trying to keep us down he is here to to lead us through remind them of the Red Sea remind them of the things he's done for you already it's a relationship limitations chapter 3 verse 22 says it is of the Lord's Mercies that we are not consumed because his compassion failed not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness I'll tell you if you just if you could pause just a moment in your life and look at all the times that you could not handle something and God took care of it for you amen amen you didn't do what you should have done and God had mercy on you and he just took care of it amen that'll make us want to come to the house of God and worship him to praise him to give him thanks you know so often we forget about the things he's done in the past and he don't want us to forget he wants us to forget about all the problems that we're having in the praise him that he's going to take care of them great is thy faithfulness I want to read a scripture and I'm not going to get to all that I want to but this scripture it Bears repeating second Timothy chapter 2 verse 13. second Timothy chapter 2 verse 13. I want you to think about how good and faithful God has been to you the scripture says if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny his own I'm so grateful that when I have denied him he could not deny me I'm so grateful amen amen that when Paul when Peter cursed denied ignored gave up forsook the Lord that God did not deny him that's right amen and I'll tell you we have come short and we have failed and we have denied to stand for the truth of this word for the mercy of God sometimes we have not wanted to be merciful to somebody sometimes we've not wanted to love somebody sometimes we don't want to lay down our life sometimes we've been so selfish with our life and God was merciful to us and we just need to stop and consider great our God is amen and when we do we'll see he we're amazed because he's amazing we're Spellbound we're as it were I'd like to use that word but I'll tell you we stand in all we stand in with our mouths wide open with our hearts just so humbled because our God takes care of us He's Worthy to be praised he's worthy to be praised well I'm going to have to just you stop eating I stop preaching that's just all the others to it but I'm telling you I always save the best for last you remember there was a man called Legion remember what happened to him even the Devils inside of him screamed out I ajure Thee I adjour Thee by God don't torment us hear the devil was using the name was using God to tell God what to do the devil's a liar and you know what he likes to do he likes to hide in people because as soon as Jesus saw him that that devil wanted to hide didn't want to have to come out but God had Deliverance in store for this man did he the Bible says that when he was delivered that he really wanted he besought Jesus oh Jesus let me just stay with you that's right I want to stay with you and what did Jesus say no he said Return to thine own house and show how great things God has done unto thee amen God wanted this man to go tell everybody how great God is God wants us to leave here and go tell everybody how great God is how he has delivered us how he has blessed us how he has set us in Heavenly places how he's changed our nature how he's done so many great things in our life Psalms 26 verse 7 that I may publish with the voice of Thanksgiving and tell of all thy wondrous Works Lord I have loved the habitation of the house and the place where thine honor dwelleth how many believe that God's honor dwells here I'm amazed that there is a way that I'm speeding up just so you know I'm still not doing all my notes so you just be thankful that's an order I'm amazed that there's a way to get the devil off your back you know sometimes you can Shout you can tell them you get mad you can rebuke them and he's still there why why you know there's a way to get the devil off your back all you have to do is submit to God amen amen to met yourself unto God then you'll have strength to resist them because you're not bigger than the devil but when you humble yourself under the mighty hand of God you submit yourself to God then you can stand there with the authority that you have met his requirements and the devil don't even want to be by you anymore there's a way to get the devil off your back we don't understand all the ways that God does things and we know his thoughts are higher and his ways are higher but everything that God does is good everything he created in the beginning when he got done Creed he said it is good and everything that he does or allows in your life is good God will never be accused will never be found guilty let me reword that on the day of judgment that he was nothing but good amen that's why we're supposed to count it all joy with our fiery trials God ain't messing up God ain't there's just God didn't come down here to build our kingdom he came down here to get us out of this place and to build his kingdom inside of us Psalms 31 verse 19 says oh how great is thy goodness which thou has laid up for them that feare thee when we stop to consider God's goodness it changes our perspective Romans 2 4 says at one time we despised The Riches of God's goodness and the forbearance and the long-suffering not knowing that it was actually the goodness of God that was leading us to repentance but today we do know it's his goodness that leads us to repentance it's a Godly sorrow that works repentance unto salvation Psalms 139 verse 17. how precious are thy thoughts unto me oh God and how great is the sum of them so we don't understand all God's lives we don't understand his ways we don't understand but we know they're very precious the thoughts that God has towards us and actually the sum of them the sum of God's thoughts to us are amazing did you ever want to know what God sums you up with how he sums you up with what he really thinks the Bible says his thoughts towards us are very precious he doesn't think ill of us he doesn't think evil of us his thoughts can be summed up you're very they're very you are very precious his thoughts of you are precious he's gentle he's a real gentleman you're the apple of his high you are the scars in his hands you are the love in his heart you are a part of him his thoughts towards you are precious in fact Jeremiah 29 11 says for I know the thoughts I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end this is the sum of his thoughts to give you an expected end that's why we know that everything is going to work to help you in the end everything is going to work to help you in the end it don't help now you may hate it now you may wish it didn't happen now but what he has orchestrated is going to help you in the end amen for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us let's Stand Together God bless you only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he hath done praise the Lord you know this temperature has stayed pretty pretty pretty steady in here you know I say to I are you called sister Donna amen say Amen say Amen
