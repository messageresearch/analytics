[35:57] father lord
[35:59] before we approach your word today
[36:01] realizing we're not worthy to even open
[36:04] the pages
[36:06] lord we know the book was
[36:09] was kind of put together by automated
[36:11] equipment and
[36:13] man was involved but we know
[36:16] the treasures inside this
[36:20] the pages of this book were written
[36:23] before the foundation of the world it's
[36:26] eternal
[36:28] and we're beings that
[36:31] are temporal we
[36:35] had a beginning we'll have an end in
[36:37] these bodies we
[36:39] learn as we go ahead in life
[36:43] today we're asking for the eternal god
[36:46] to come and give us
[36:48] revelation of what was meant when you
[36:50] wrote
[36:51] these words lord help us to get our
[36:54] interpretation
[36:56] our thoughts and our ideas out of the
[36:58] way that you may come and
[37:00] give us the wonderful words of life
[37:02] bless each heart and each life
[37:04] lord you you see the the needs inside of
[37:08] our lives and the things that we've been
[37:10] praying for and
[37:12] been seeking after and desiring lords
[37:16] whether it be health or a deliverance
[37:20] or the holy ghost or guidance for our
[37:24] lives
[37:25] lord we're asking you to come and meet
[37:26] all of our needs for your
[37:28] almighty god that can do exceedingly
[37:30] above all that we would ask
[37:32] or even think bless those that are are
[37:35] watching
[37:36] are listening uh lord to this message
[37:41] and we'll give you the praise and the
[37:42] glory for all these things now we humbly
[37:44] ask in jesus christ's name
[37:46] amen amen mark chapter 8
[37:50] starting with verse number 33
[37:56] amen
[38:00] but when he had turned and looked
[38:03] on his disciples he rebuked peter saying
[38:06] get thee behind me satan for thou art
[38:08] thou savers not the things that be of
[38:11] god but
[38:12] the things that be of men very familiar
[38:15] scripture
[38:16] and when he had called the people unto
[38:19] him
[38:20] with his disciples also he said unto
[38:23] them
[38:24] whosoever will come after me
[38:28] let him deny himself and take up his
[38:31] cross
[38:32] and follow me whosoever will save his
[38:35] life
[38:37] shall lose it but whosoever will
[38:40] lose his life for my sake and the
[38:43] gospels
[38:44] the same shall save it for what shall
[38:47] profit a man if he gained the whole
[38:49] world
[38:50] lose his soul or what shall a man
[38:53] give in exchange for his soul
[38:56] whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of
[38:59] me and of my words
[39:01] in this adulterous and sinful
[39:04] generation of him also shall the son of
[39:08] man be ashamed
[39:09] when he cometh in the glory
[39:12] of his father with his holy angels
[39:15] amen god bless you may be seated so we
[39:18] see that we have to
[39:19] kind of go through this whole life down
[39:22] here
[39:22] not be ashamed of the lord in any
[39:25] situation
[39:26] but we really don't find out how he
[39:29] feels about us
[39:30] until the end yeah
[39:33] well we just
[39:37] we kind of want to relax today and ask a
[39:39] lot of questions and just
[39:40] think about things we uh
[39:44] trust the lord to help
[39:47] us see what he wants us to see
[39:51] through doing this we want to entitle
[39:53] this message
[39:54] what would you exchange what
[39:57] would you exchange and for a subject
[40:02] we want to talk about the prerequisites
[40:04] that jesus
[40:06] gave and it's like you're going to
[40:09] college
[40:10] and you you want to become a a doctor
[40:13] or a psychologist
[40:16] you pretty much have to take the same
[40:18] prerequisite as far as some of them
[40:21] are psychology and things like that and
[40:23] certain ones
[40:24] and then as you get further you just
[40:27] can't jump in and say i want to know how
[40:28] to cut somebody open
[40:30] you have to take prerequisites to get
[40:32] there and
[40:33] and jesus has some some prerequisites
[40:36] here
[40:36] and um this all this is tonight
[40:40] uh by the the grace of god god helping
[40:43] me
[40:43] because it is kind of a more of a
[40:46] stronger subject because it
[40:47] is dealing with our souls and
[40:51] are i just i don't want you getting mad
[40:53] at me
[40:54] but i just want us to to just
[40:57] ponder the questions that jesus
[41:00] gave ponder the questions that jesus
[41:04] gave
[41:04] just because we've gotten baptized in
[41:06] the name of the lord
[41:08] and we've made a commitment to serve
[41:10] christ and to
[41:11] follow him into a relationship and even
[41:13] in to get
[41:14] to the deeper things of god the
[41:16] revelation of this message
[41:18] just because we've accepted the prophet
[41:21] made a decision to follow the message
[41:23] and just because we're we're doing what
[41:26] we're doing
[41:27] it doesn't really mean we're truly
[41:29] following
[41:30] the lord the way he
[41:34] has required amen
[41:39] and his eyes may be different than our
[41:42] eyes
[41:44] and of course satan's working very hard
[41:46] to get us off
[41:47] of the straight narrow and to get us
[41:50] more on a broad way of
[41:51] serving the lord before we actually
[41:56] follow christ each day
[41:59] jesus said that there's some
[42:00] prerequisites
[42:02] some classes that we have to pass and
[42:04] the first one
[42:05] is that we need to deny ourself
[42:09] and we need to take up the cross now
[42:11] this scripture
[42:12] has a perfect understanding for the
[42:14] person who comes to christ
[42:18] who doesn't know the lord you've got to
[42:21] be
[42:21] willing to to to give up yourself pick
[42:23] up the cross and
[42:24] you know you're gonna if you try to
[42:28] make it through and go to heaven without
[42:30] giving your heart to jesus christ
[42:32] you're going to lose everything and so
[42:35] we see
[42:36] that is a perfect scripture for that
[42:38] because
[42:39] a man is is giving his life to jesus
[42:42] because
[42:42] he does not want to exchange his soul
[42:47] for anything he wants to get his soul
[42:50] won and the only way to do it is to give
[42:51] his life to jesus christ
[42:56] but these scriptures refor refer more
[42:59] than just the beginning of our walk
[43:04] this is about us today it will be about
[43:07] us tomorrow and that's why i just want
[43:10] to go through them and
[43:11] and think about this a little bit so the
[43:14] first one here
[43:15] is that we we we need to deny ourself
[43:18] our will our way we we got to deny
[43:22] calling the shots being in control doing
[43:25] what we want to do
[43:26] this is something that must happen
[43:29] every day amen that's what jesus said
[43:33] not in this scripture but i believe as
[43:34] in perhaps in
[43:36] luke maybe that
[43:39] jesus uses the word daily so it's not
[43:42] just the beginning of our walk
[43:44] and we get so used to i'm serving god
[43:48] god's with me i'll go do what i want to
[43:52] do
[43:54] and so we don't even attempt to die out
[43:58] we just feel it's an automatic
[44:01] and as far as picking up some cross i
[44:04] mean my life's heavy enough you know
[44:06] hard enough i
[44:06] don't got time for you know any more
[44:08] problems
[44:10] but the honesty the reality i should say
[44:14] jesus doesn't even consider us having
[44:16] the ability to follow him
[44:18] if we try to follow him with our will
[44:23] we've got to give up our will right amen
[44:27] the scripture teaches us that
[44:31] they that are after the flesh they do
[44:33] mind the things of the flesh romans 8 7
[44:36] the carnal mind is enmity against god is
[44:38] not subject to the law of
[44:40] god neither indeed can be so then they
[44:42] that are in the flesh cannot
[44:44] please god so there's the scripture
[44:46] right there
[44:47] that we we just can't get up and do what
[44:49] we want to do
[44:52] we're not following the lord but see the
[44:54] devil still tells us we are
[44:58] and this is why we just got to take a
[44:59] moment and ponder these things
[45:02] and just just consider maybe i just
[45:05] been tricked by the enemy and thinking
[45:11] so if we don't pass the requirement of
[45:13] denying our fleshly will
[45:15] god views us is never being able
[45:19] to follow him
[45:22] come on there should be a lot of amens
[45:24] with this if you don't say amen a lot
[45:26] what you're going to do is get mad at me
[45:31] so he says whosoever will come after me
[45:33] let him deny himself take up his cross
[45:35] and follow me he didn't say
[45:37] whosoever come after me let him follow
[45:39] me and if you can fit it in deny
[45:41] yourself if you can fiddle in
[45:43] you know pick up a cross
[45:46] there's prerequisites to follow the lord
[45:51] of course there's a whole world out
[45:54] there that the devil
[45:55] has deceived into thinking that
[45:59] are following the lord at the same time
[46:01] of holding on to their own will
[46:03] amen and satan will give them scriptures
[46:09] to help his deception scriptures can be
[46:12] used to deceived don't think that don't
[46:14] think that
[46:16] the devil's not going to use god's word
[46:18] he does he used it against him
[46:22] didn't god promise to give you the
[46:24] desire of your heart
[46:28] didn't god say i'll never leave you nor
[46:29] forsake you it doesn't matter what you
[46:30] do
[46:32] didn't god say the elect can't be
[46:34] deceived
[46:36] didn't god say uh whatever you ask in my
[46:39] name
[46:41] you noticed brother brandon never went
[46:43] around and asking a bunch of things
[46:44] in the name of the lord for him but why
[46:47] the devil has got us to do it
[46:54] many enter into the broad way of
[46:56] thinking that they can follow
[46:58] christ and still hold on
[47:01] to their will still do what they want to
[47:04] do
[47:04] amen that's i i believe
[47:09] brother mike was sharing some some
[47:11] things in our men's meeting which you
[47:13] your brothers are going to see how this
[47:15] is just like
[47:17] fits fits right there but he's talking
[47:19] about uh
[47:22] brother brother branham there so there
[47:24] was uh
[47:25] brother brahms old nature was kind of
[47:27] sitting behind
[47:28] in in the face of an indian or uh
[47:31] and uh it it it had an influence
[47:35] on him but not a control
[47:40] and it's basically describing that
[47:43] cockaburn nature
[47:45] that we're going to have until we're out
[47:47] of here amen and to whom you yield as
[47:49] brother bill was saying to whom you
[47:50] yield your self-servant
[47:52] to a white dog bat black dog
[48:00] second corinthians 4 4 says the god of
[48:02] this world have blinded the minds of
[48:04] them which believe not
[48:06] that they have to deny their own
[48:08] personal
[48:09] will right if we if we ever
[48:13] think that we can do what we want to do
[48:18] we're not following the lord amen
[48:21] and it's a hard pill to swallow
[48:25] now just because we've started in with
[48:27] jesus it doesn't mean that we're autumn
[48:29] just because we started in the right way
[48:31] with jesus
[48:33] let me say that we got baptized we did
[48:35] the right thing
[48:36] it doesn't mean that we're automatically
[48:40] doing it every day
[48:43] denying ourself and picking up the cross
[48:45] we made commitments then we were serious
[48:47] then and after a while we go through
[48:49] trials and tests
[48:50] we get beat up we get you know rolled
[48:52] over steamed over we go through so many
[48:55] things and before you note we're just
[48:56] barely hanging on
[49:01] but we still have to deny our flesh
[49:09] look what moses had to go through for so
[49:11] long
[49:14] even when you become a christian look
[49:15] what paul had to go through
[49:18] all the sufferings he had to go through
[49:20] if he would have like
[49:21] held onto his will all the time i'm not
[49:23] doing this i'm not doing i'm not going
[49:25] over there
[49:25] i'm not going to jerusalem are you okay
[49:28] what are they gonna do to me
[49:30] i'll just sit here and write these books
[49:32] these letters
[49:36] yeah we can't have a will that's what
[49:39] being born again
[49:40] is to the will of god and it's a
[49:42] struggle for us all but
[49:45] we've got to we've got to come god's way
[49:49] now dying out is painful
[49:53] there's no pleasure in the flesh about
[49:55] it the flesh does not
[49:57] enjoy dying out how many times have you
[49:59] tried to pray
[50:01] and your flesh says i don't want to
[50:06] and you just pray a little bit enough to
[50:08] feel like you prayed
[50:12] but you still know you're going to get
[50:13] up and do what you want to do
[50:15] are you with me am i the only one that
[50:18] has experienced that
[50:21] galatians chapter 2 verse 18 for if i
[50:24] build again the things which i destroyed
[50:28] i make myself a transgression amen
[50:34] we can begin to let that old creepy
[50:37] nature
[50:38] say well you're in you're in the message
[50:40] things you're good
[50:42] look how does backsliding take place
[50:46] how are people falling away from this
[50:48] message the bible tells us there'd be a
[50:50] great
[50:51] falling away how does this happen things
[50:54] creep into people's lives
[50:55] not just not just uh drinking
[50:59] and and things like that but what creeps
[51:01] in is the idea
[51:03] that i don't have to die out
[51:07] the idea that i can do what i want to do
[51:10] well before you know it doing what you
[51:11] want to do is i don't
[51:12] i'm just going to go do what i'm going
[51:14] to leave
[51:18] for i through the law am dead
[51:22] to the law that i might live unto god
[51:26] i am crucified with christ
[51:29] so on this now paul is not stating
[51:32] something that happened at the beginning
[51:34] of his walk he's talking about the life
[51:36] that he lives i am crucified with christ
[51:38] nevertheless i live
[51:39] yet not i
[51:43] but christ liveth in me and the life
[51:45] which i now live in the flesh i
[51:48] live by the faith of the son of god who
[51:49] loved me and gave himself for
[51:52] me i believe this is what jesus
[51:55] meant when he said to deny yourself
[51:59] is to be crucified with christ amen
[52:03] daily and if you do
[52:06] that means christ lives inside of you
[52:09] but as long as you're alive and your
[52:12] will
[52:13] i'm telling you god is not going to
[52:14] share his glory with your flesh
[52:18] he just won't do it he's not going to
[52:21] kick out the devil
[52:24] you've got to want to kick him out
[52:30] and if you're having a hard time call on
[52:32] the name of the lord
[52:33] call on him let him see your desire
[52:38] but when you really kind of want to do
[52:40] what you want to do
[52:42] god won't have any robots
[52:46] don't let satan blind you from thinking
[52:48] that you don't have to deny yourself
[52:51] each and every day if you're not denying
[52:55] yourself you're probably doing what you
[52:56] want to do
[52:59] well brother john i want you to know i
[53:01] am so spiritual i'm so full of god
[53:03] that i don't have any other fleshly
[53:05] desires
[53:12] you know that would be for a higher
[53:13] class a special class of people
[53:17] right jesus requires self-denial
[53:21] before we can even follow him that day
[53:29] i i just i want to ask this question we
[53:31] haven't got to any of the questions yet
[53:33] there's a lot of questions how many
[53:38] of us really realize that we
[53:42] there are days that we don't follow the
[53:43] lord
[53:48] but we think we always follow the lord
[53:51] he'll never leave us he'll never forsake
[53:54] us
[53:55] why
[54:01] why would we why would the devil tell us
[54:04] we got hold on to all these scriptures
[54:06] and do what you want to do
[54:09] because the devil knows
[54:12] god ain't pleased with it
[54:17] and we just want to uncover the enemy
[54:20] today
[54:23] now not only must we deny ourselves and
[54:26] our will
[54:27] but jesus gave us another prerequisite
[54:30] and that is we must deny we must pick up
[54:34] the cross our cross
[54:38] we all have a job that god has given us
[54:41] to do
[54:43] and it's heavy it's uh
[54:46] it if you just picture jesus walking
[54:49] down with his cross
[54:50] it was not pleasant it was heavy it was
[54:54] hard somebody had to help them
[54:59] so when you think of your cross it isn't
[55:03] it isn't fun
[55:08] but we must pick up our cross before we
[55:11] can properly
[55:12] follow the lord
[55:16] when jesus turned around to see
[55:20] who is truly following him and who is
[55:23] not
[55:24] the only disciples that are behind him
[55:27] are the ones that are carrying the
[55:32] crosses
[55:34] those who are not carrying those crosses
[55:36] are not following him
[55:38] no matter if you're saying praise the
[55:40] lord praise the lord
[55:43] if they're not willing to do what jesus
[55:45] said i'd rather
[55:47] stay with what the word says than not
[55:49] what anybody feels
[55:51] that's why we have the word is to tell
[55:54] us
[55:59] look at peter emotionally up and down
[56:04] with his relationship to properly follow
[56:08] jesus he didn't
[56:10] listen carefully to the prerequisites
[56:12] jesus told them
[56:14] that you're going to have to deny
[56:16] yourself you can't listen to satan who's
[56:18] trying to
[56:20] tell you that you could just uh
[56:23] enjoy the things of the flesh
[56:26] is that what he said thou savers
[56:29] not the things that be of god but the
[56:30] things that be of men
[56:32] and what was of of peter's desire
[56:36] was to have a church without pain
[56:39] to have a a pastor who didn't have to
[56:41] suffer to have jesus with him all the
[56:44] time
[56:44] and jesus says i'm not only going to
[56:46] suffer you're going to have to suffer
[56:53] and people like peter still wanted
[56:56] to follow jesus
[57:00] but didn't want to take up the suffering
[57:02] so what did he end up doing
[57:05] he could only follow jesus from afar
[57:08] and his life was filled with denial he
[57:11] was
[57:12] ashamed amen he was ashamed
[57:17] even kind of pressure got real bad and
[57:19] cursed he
[57:20] no i don't know him i don't go to that
[57:21] church that's kind of weirdo
[57:23] i don't really believe in that i just go
[57:25] because i have to
[57:28] and it was because they weren't filled
[57:30] with the holy ghost
[57:35] so peter didn't exercise
[57:40] the prerequisite he thought he could
[57:43] still fall i'll go with you to the end i
[57:45] will
[57:46] i would i will fight for you i would die
[57:48] for you you don't know who i
[57:49] am here i know who you are you don't
[57:53] know who you are
[57:55] [Music]
[57:58] and god knows who we are he not even
[58:01] knows how many hairs we got
[58:03] he knows how many we're losing every day
[58:07] and how many are are transforming from
[58:11] brown to gray
[58:15] and different shades of ray
[58:20] jesus
[58:22] is still suffering
[58:27] people are still mocking christ amen
[58:30] still pulling his beard putting the
[58:33] crown on his head
[58:35] people are still swearing cursing taking
[58:38] the name of the lord in vain
[58:41] and jesus feels the denial
[58:44] of every single person that comes
[58:46] against you
[58:47] when you're trying to share christ with
[58:49] them because he's touched
[58:51] by the feelings of your infirmities yes
[58:57] we know that they are rejecting christ
[59:01] but how can you not feel it
[59:04] you're going to feel it
[59:09] so he's still suffering
[59:13] and what they've done to the least of
[59:14] these little ones
[59:17] we they do it on to to him good or bad
[59:22] now as christ is feeling all this pain
[59:25] when he looks back to see who's carrying
[59:27] the cross
[59:29] we don't want to be like peter unwilling
[59:32] to suffer
[59:33] for christ
[59:39] i can picture christ in his agony and
[59:41] his pain hanging there on the cross
[59:43] and looking over at peter
[59:48] he was suffering
[59:55] and when that rooster went the third
[59:58] time
[1:00:00] he knew peter had denied him
[1:00:03] just looking there in his pain and
[1:00:06] suffering
[1:00:07] one time he said can't you pray with me
[1:00:09] one hour
[1:00:11] he's telling peter can't you could you
[1:00:13] just stand with me and believe in me
[1:00:15] that
[1:00:15] what's happening is the will of god the
[1:00:18] suffering
[1:00:23] it's like christians don't want to be a
[1:00:26] part
[1:00:27] of suffering
[1:00:32] oh peter get the holy ghost
[1:00:35] right you've got to pick up your cross
[1:00:38] and follow me
[1:00:40] and when you're converted strengthen the
[1:00:42] brother and he said
[1:00:45] then you're going to want to pick up
[1:00:50] they're not going to want to pick up
[1:00:51] their cross either that's why you got to
[1:00:53] strengthen them
[1:00:54] that's why you gotta tell them
[1:00:59] we're not all in the same
[1:01:04] yeah we're not peter
[1:01:07] if you really love me suffer from my
[1:01:10] sheep
[1:01:11] be willing to suffer for my sheep
[1:01:14] so what he means feed my sheep suffer
[1:01:17] for them
[1:01:18] it takes it takes effort takes time you
[1:01:21] just can't go to the store and buy
[1:01:23] you know or go to costco's and get the
[1:01:25] big
[1:01:26] 15 000 box thing and say
[1:01:29] well i don't have to worry about feeding
[1:01:31] for a while just you know
[1:01:34] kind of what does the lord want you to
[1:01:36] feed
[1:01:39] peter i will get you the keys
[1:01:42] to properly follow me
[1:01:47] now jesus has some prerequisites before
[1:01:50] we follow him each day
[1:01:51] each day is a new day today is the day
[1:01:54] of salvation
[1:01:56] let's let's let's just take it as as it
[1:01:58] is he that endure to the end
[1:02:00] right i mean can you imagine these two
[1:02:04] scriptures he that endured to the end
[1:02:06] and you know predestination once saved
[1:02:09] always saved
[1:02:11] i mean what do you do with it they seem
[1:02:14] contradictory
[1:02:17] they're not but see
[1:02:21] some people want to hang on to this and
[1:02:23] ignore
[1:02:25] enduring to the end
[1:02:30] and this is part of the relationship
[1:02:32] brother adam says that we don't look at
[1:02:34] is the everyday part with the lord
[1:02:38] it's what happened in the past and
[1:02:39] what's going to happen in the future
[1:02:42] amen
[1:02:46] must jesus bear the cross alone
[1:02:50] and all the world go free
[1:02:53] no there's a cross for everyone and
[1:02:56] there's a cross for me
[1:02:58] the consecrated cross i'll bear
[1:03:01] till death shall set me free
[1:03:04] and then go home my crown to where
[1:03:07] for there's a crown for me
[1:03:10] we have a cross and it's not
[1:03:13] you suffering because of doing your will
[1:03:20] why is it so hard for people to remain
[1:03:22] faithful
[1:03:23] to go to church
[1:03:28] were they i can't brother man says can't
[1:03:31] wait till those doors are open
[1:03:35] to stand fire for god why are there so
[1:03:38] many believers
[1:03:39] up and down
[1:03:42] why so many believers
[1:03:46] aren't interested in sharing the gospel
[1:03:47] to sinners
[1:03:50] why don't you see many believers
[1:03:52] carrying
[1:03:53] the burden for souls
[1:03:56] where's the joy
[1:04:00] where's the gladness to glory
[1:04:04] in our infirmities paul said in second
[1:04:08] corinthians chapter 12 verse 10
[1:04:09] therefore i take pleasures and
[1:04:11] affirmatives and reproaches and
[1:04:12] necessities
[1:04:14] and persecutions in distress for
[1:04:16] christ's sake for when i weak then i'm
[1:04:17] strong
[1:04:21] i mean i understand that it is not
[1:04:25] enjoyable giving up your will
[1:04:28] but you need to turn right to the fact
[1:04:32] that you're going to be pleasing god
[1:04:34] today
[1:04:35] no matter the cost no matter the
[1:04:37] suffering
[1:04:39] it is the prerequisite to follow him
[1:04:41] that day
[1:04:42] [Music]
[1:04:47] speaking of church you remember some
[1:04:50] time ago i was reading a
[1:04:53] a little
[1:04:57] a little quote from grayson
[1:05:00] gilbert and it said church should be
[1:05:04] the excuse for missing everything else
[1:05:08] and i said it was a four pager and i
[1:05:11] only had tied to read one
[1:05:14] you remember that well maybe since we're
[1:05:17] talking about this maybe we could just
[1:05:19] read
[1:05:20] page two and then we'll save three and
[1:05:23] four for another time
[1:05:25] just going back and wanting to tie into
[1:05:27] the second page i want to read a little
[1:05:29] bit of the third page
[1:05:30] there is one of those areas where many
[1:05:32] people have settled in their minds that
[1:05:33] church attendance is optional
[1:05:36] now this is in the mind of people
[1:05:40] they can miss here and there without any
[1:05:42] large repercussions
[1:05:44] to their spiritual well-being
[1:05:48] and their own families will not
[1:05:51] be any worse off either
[1:05:54] now this is not the lord telling this
[1:05:57] but this is how the enemy speaks
[1:05:59] to people however the reality is that
[1:06:02] i've never
[1:06:03] known a casual attendee to
[1:06:06] thrive in any meaningful capacity
[1:06:12] i've yet to meet another pastor an elder
[1:06:14] that can testify
[1:06:16] to the exemplary faith of the professing
[1:06:19] christian
[1:06:20] who abdicates
[1:06:26] a-b-d-i-c-a-t
[1:06:29] abdicates regular church attendance
[1:06:36] i have witnessed seasons of growth from
[1:06:39] them
[1:06:40] yet i have simultaneously witnessed
[1:06:44] a stunt growth because invariably
[1:06:48] they are sporadic sporadically
[1:06:52] absent from the ordinary means that god
[1:06:55] has given them for their maturity
[1:06:58] their encouragement their perseverance
[1:07:01] in the christian faith more often
[1:07:03] than this stunted growth though is
[1:07:06] no growth at all or worse a backsliding
[1:07:10] of sorts and that's where i stopped
[1:07:11] there but
[1:07:12] i just want to read a little bit of page
[1:07:15] two
[1:07:16] part and parcel to this will be a
[1:07:20] further understanding of the importance
[1:07:21] of being part of a local manifestation
[1:07:24] of the body
[1:07:24] not simply as we feel like it
[1:07:28] but as often as we can because we will
[1:07:31] grow
[1:07:31] more dissatisfied with yoking ourselves
[1:07:33] with the world in favor of the bride of
[1:07:35] christ
[1:07:38] in essence we will begin to see the body
[1:07:41] of christ
[1:07:42] as scriptural portraits of her the
[1:07:45] spotless bride of jesus christ for whom
[1:07:47] he died
[1:07:48] we will look upon the radiance and
[1:07:50] loveliness
[1:07:51] seeing her clothe with the righteousness
[1:07:53] of christ and her dear union with her
[1:07:55] bridegroom
[1:07:56] and we will desire the same union for
[1:07:59] ourselves
[1:08:00] here then is the fullness reason why we
[1:08:03] do not
[1:08:04] absticate the assembling of the brethren
[1:08:08] we are to meet together and encourage
[1:08:10] one another all the more as we see that
[1:08:12] great day coming
[1:08:13] hebrews 10 25 in other words together
[1:08:16] as a corporate gathering we look with
[1:08:19] great anticipation of the day when
[1:08:21] christ will return to get
[1:08:23] and we get to partake in the wedding
[1:08:26] feast of the lamb
[1:08:27] if i could put it in even more clearly
[1:08:31] we gather with the saints
[1:08:34] each sunday i'll just add wednesday
[1:08:38] not simply out of obedience nor even
[1:08:41] because
[1:08:42] of all the wondrous benefits found
[1:08:44] therein we convene with the local
[1:08:47] uh church each weekend because
[1:08:50] we are betrothed betrothed
[1:08:54] not as individuals but as the body
[1:08:57] to our lord jesus christ
[1:09:01] that's why we're here
[1:09:04] we assemble together because
[1:09:07] he has assembled us together
[1:09:12] we gather while it is called today
[1:09:14] because we will be gathered together in
[1:09:16] his great halls
[1:09:17] with the believers of all time
[1:09:21] he said if you can't stomach meeting
[1:09:23] with believers today
[1:09:26] while they're too grown as they await
[1:09:29] the day of their redemption
[1:09:32] in what possible reality can you say
[1:09:34] with earnestness
[1:09:35] that you will be united with him at the
[1:09:37] end of days
[1:09:40] when we get down to it if you don't
[1:09:42] understand the importance of why we
[1:09:43] gather together each week
[1:09:45] church should come church should become
[1:09:48] the excuse
[1:09:49] you use to miss everything else that
[1:09:52] conflicts with it
[1:09:53] and not the other way around
[1:09:57] so often we got it backwards
[1:10:03] and satan tells us
[1:10:06] that it's okay it's okay
[1:10:12] we're too many people even in this
[1:10:15] message
[1:10:16] is following christ without denying
[1:10:18] their will
[1:10:19] this denying the will and picking up
[1:10:21] your cross is so elementary
[1:10:23] that they don't even think about it they
[1:10:25] don't talk about it
[1:10:27] because it's a given
[1:10:32] but according to jesus you can't even
[1:10:34] follow them without it
[1:10:36] that's why i want to just talk about it
[1:10:38] today i'm not pointing any fingers
[1:10:40] if i'm pointing any finger i'll be
[1:10:41] honest with you they're all pointing at
[1:10:43] me
[1:10:45] just kind of like get that out of the
[1:10:46] way if you want to stand up all one time
[1:10:48] and go like this
[1:10:50] at me i'm okay with it because i it's
[1:10:53] true
[1:10:56] we're on the same boat i feel
[1:11:02] the truth of the matter is god has a
[1:11:05] will
[1:11:06] for your life and satan wants you to
[1:11:09] exercise
[1:11:10] your will for your life
[1:11:14] each day you wake up you have to to make
[1:11:16] a choice
[1:11:17] it's either going to be yours or gods
[1:11:21] and gods is scary because you hand the
[1:11:23] wheel you don't even know where you're
[1:11:23] going to go that day
[1:11:26] if you do yours it's pretty simple i got
[1:11:28] this plan this plan i'm gonna do this
[1:11:30] when i get down i'm gonna go here
[1:11:34] if you're truly choosing god's will
[1:11:38] you will consciously put forth the
[1:11:40] effort of having to deny your plans
[1:11:44] pick up god's will that's your cross
[1:11:47] for that day it's not going to be easy
[1:11:51] brother man taught us
[1:11:53] god's way is hard so i got some
[1:11:56] questions for you what
[1:11:58] would you exchange for his will
[1:12:06] you can just rattle off if you want to
[1:12:08] you know you don't
[1:12:11] what is satan offering you that's more
[1:12:13] important
[1:12:14] in your life
[1:12:17] what are you exchanging daily for the
[1:12:20] cross
[1:12:26] many start off heading in the right
[1:12:28] direction but they don't continue
[1:12:30] to build they don't finish the tower
[1:12:34] it just kind of is left yeah he started
[1:12:36] he got baptized
[1:12:38] she got baptized she they started coming
[1:12:42] during the message but but but
[1:12:49] every day god gives us a chance to build
[1:12:53] that day
[1:12:57] are we trying to finish the building
[1:13:01] or are you finished
[1:13:06] are you already finished can't help you
[1:13:09] build no more
[1:13:09] not more to do you already there
[1:13:13] no no need to deny flesh
[1:13:16] is your revelation that you're there and
[1:13:18] you're in need of nothing
[1:13:23] if god gives you another day of life
[1:13:26] he's given you an opportunity
[1:13:28] to serve him to follow him
[1:13:32] in order to do that properly
[1:13:36] the prerequisite is to deny your will
[1:13:39] and to pick up your cross and then
[1:13:42] you're allowed to get to the next class
[1:13:44] which is follow him
[1:13:48] luke had a revelation of this when he
[1:13:51] said
[1:13:51] in luke chapter 9 verse 23 if any man
[1:13:53] will come after me
[1:13:55] let him deny himself take up his cross
[1:13:57] quoting jesus
[1:14:00] daily and follow me
[1:14:04] it's a daily thing i do like that just
[1:14:08] so simple you know how i do it
[1:14:10] i just get on my knees for the proper
[1:14:12] six minutes that i pray
[1:14:14] and you know that is an automatic if i
[1:14:16] get down there
[1:14:17] i have automatically denied my flesh
[1:14:22] if i can basically make it through that
[1:14:24] eight minutes i'm scot-free to do what i
[1:14:26] want to do
[1:14:32] jesus knew the tendency that every
[1:14:34] believer would have
[1:14:35] daily because we got this cockapoo
[1:14:39] nature amen it's with us to stay
[1:14:42] amen it's attached to us
[1:14:45] the only way for him not to have his way
[1:14:48] is to kill
[1:14:51] is to die daily as paul said in your
[1:14:54] notes
[1:14:57] he knew every one of us would be tempted
[1:14:59] to hold on to that nature
[1:15:02] so his answer was to deny it
[1:15:07] to crucify it paul said i'm crucified
[1:15:09] with christ
[1:15:12] that that that period of of of
[1:15:14] interaction
[1:15:15] with that bad nature has to take place
[1:15:22] if you don't interact with it like
[1:15:23] brother hankins used to say
[1:15:25] and brother bruce probably remembers
[1:15:26] this if you don't face him some
[1:15:29] sometime through the course of the day
[1:15:32] he says you better watch you're probably
[1:15:34] walking with him
[1:15:36] you're walking in the same direction
[1:15:37] he's going
[1:15:42] it's worth asking every day pondering
[1:15:45] the thought
[1:15:45] what would you exchange for following
[1:15:49] jesus that day
[1:15:52] devil has got us so intellectually
[1:15:54] programmed
[1:15:55] that no matter what our steps are
[1:15:58] ordered of the lord
[1:16:00] no matter what we do we're always being
[1:16:03] led of the lord
[1:16:06] i don't need to acknowledge the lord in
[1:16:08] all my ways he's still directing my pets
[1:16:11] no matter what all the ways
[1:16:15] are pleasing to the lord all my ways are
[1:16:18] pleasing to the lord
[1:16:22] i'm so elected it's i'm impossible to be
[1:16:26] deceived
[1:16:29] i'm so tight in the palm of god's hand
[1:16:32] that i can't possibly do anything wrong
[1:16:37] we know jesus so well that once saved
[1:16:40] we're always saved
[1:16:42] we're so predestinated we're so
[1:16:45] predestinated
[1:16:46] that there is absolutely no thought
[1:16:49] about my walk with the lord
[1:16:52] because all i'm concerned about is the
[1:16:54] end
[1:16:55] [Music]
[1:16:56] what god is concerned about every day we
[1:16:58] want god every day we want him to help
[1:17:00] us every day
[1:17:01] when i meet our knees every day why
[1:17:03] can't we be concerned about doing his
[1:17:05] will every day
[1:17:07] it's worth evaluating what
[1:17:10] are we exchanging for our time
[1:17:16] everything that we choose there's a
[1:17:17] price to pay
[1:17:19] across to bear if you want a brand new
[1:17:22] cadillac
[1:17:24] you want a quarter million dollar home
[1:17:28] you're going to pay the price you're
[1:17:30] going to bear that burden
[1:17:35] do you want to win souls for the lord
[1:17:37] jesus you're going to carry that cross
[1:17:39] too
[1:17:42] either way you're going to be carrying a
[1:17:45] load
[1:17:47] one is for your flesh and your will and
[1:17:50] one is for gods
[1:17:52] god is interested in souls that's what
[1:17:55] eternal life is
[1:17:57] he doesn't really care what i drive i
[1:18:00] care about what i drive
[1:18:01] he don't care what i drive
[1:18:06] there's no self denial for our will
[1:18:10] that makes it so much easier
[1:18:13] in other words i really want this
[1:18:15] cadillac brand new
[1:18:18] i want it i'm going to get it i don't
[1:18:21] care how much i got to pay
[1:18:22] every month
[1:18:26] i want it there's no self-denial of that
[1:18:33] but when we can't have our will we got
[1:18:36] to deny
[1:18:38] jesus knows best that's not a good
[1:18:40] choice for you that cadillac
[1:18:44] well that becomes life becomes harder
[1:18:46] now
[1:18:50] but it's the right choice are you with
[1:18:53] me
[1:18:58] we are willing to do something glamorous
[1:19:01] for god
[1:19:03] if we can get something out of it yes
[1:19:05] sir right if we can get some attention
[1:19:08] if we can get some popularity if
[1:19:10] somebody could find out about it
[1:19:14] we don't mind doing things
[1:19:17] if we get something out of it or if it's
[1:19:18] not too much of a sacrifice
[1:19:24] but what would you exchange for doing
[1:19:26] something for god
[1:19:28] the prerequisite for doing god a
[1:19:31] reasonable service
[1:19:32] is to present your body a living
[1:19:34] sacrifice
[1:19:36] amen if if
[1:19:39] not that motive it's not even a
[1:19:42] reasonable service in his sight
[1:19:45] but we want to serve god our own way
[1:19:51] instead of lord what is the way to serve
[1:19:53] you
[1:19:56] look into the book look at the examples
[1:20:00] look at what the prophet did the life
[1:20:02] that he lived
[1:20:06] turn with me if you would to luke
[1:20:08] chapter 14 verse 12
[1:20:12] then said he also to him that made him
[1:20:16] when thou make us a dinner or supper
[1:20:20] right call not they friends nor thy
[1:20:22] brethren neither the kinsmen or the rich
[1:20:25] the rich neighbors i don't cut any of
[1:20:27] those
[1:20:28] lest they also bid thee again and
[1:20:32] a recompense be made thee but when thou
[1:20:35] make us a feast call the poor the man
[1:20:37] the lame the blind
[1:20:38] and thou shall be blessed for they
[1:20:41] cannot recompense thee
[1:20:43] for thou shall be re recompense at the
[1:20:46] resurrection
[1:20:47] of the just
[1:20:50] present your body a living sacrifice
[1:20:52] that's your reasonable service
[1:20:55] amen what about the talents that god
[1:20:59] has given you what are you doing with
[1:21:01] them
[1:21:03] are you using them are you exchanging
[1:21:05] your time
[1:21:07] with those we still got to give an
[1:21:11] answer to god with those when it's all
[1:21:12] over
[1:21:14] think about it he doesn't come into our
[1:21:15] bedrooms every day and say
[1:21:17] what are you doing with the talent i
[1:21:18] gave you
[1:21:21] it's at the end it's at the end
[1:21:24] amen and we need to consider that now
[1:21:27] not the end
[1:21:29] and it just it behooves us just to spend
[1:21:32] some time pondering these things
[1:21:35] so i question for you how much of your
[1:21:37] will is god's will
[1:21:44] how much of your will should be god's
[1:21:46] will
[1:21:53] how much of your will do you give to god
[1:22:00] how much of your time is god's time
[1:22:07] how much do you how much time do you
[1:22:09] purpose for god
[1:22:13] i mean we got to work we got to eat got
[1:22:16] to sleep
[1:22:18] but how much time do you purpose for god
[1:22:23] how much of your belongings are god's
[1:22:27] brother john they're all mine because i
[1:22:29] paid ties i gave him his and the rest is
[1:22:36] mine
[1:22:38] how much of them do you give to god how
[1:22:40] much of your belongings do you give to
[1:22:41] god
[1:22:42] i mean the scripture talks about when
[1:22:43] somebody asks something you just get it
[1:22:49] god heals 10 lepers
[1:22:52] and had an expectation of all ten of
[1:22:54] them
[1:22:56] but only one fulfilled his expectation
[1:23:01] why was he why was he even bothering the
[1:23:04] one that came back to
[1:23:06] praise him to ask him
[1:23:09] about the other nine that's how much it
[1:23:12] meant to jesus
[1:23:14] brother around talking about the rocks
[1:23:15] crying out
[1:23:19] god has an expectation from us
[1:23:26] and it's a good thing to ponder
[1:23:31] do you feel in debt to god
[1:23:35] how much
[1:23:39] or do you feel indebted to your plans
[1:23:42] the plans that you've made
[1:23:47] what drives me personally is
[1:23:50] responsibility i have towards god
[1:23:53] i feel responsible
[1:23:57] to god and the reason i feel responsible
[1:24:00] is because i feel in debt
[1:24:06] i don't think i paid my debt off
[1:24:12] i feel responsible to god's purpose
[1:24:18] if our purpose is to god then we will be
[1:24:21] responsible to god but if our purpose is
[1:24:25] to ourselves
[1:24:26] then we will feel responsible to
[1:24:28] ourselves
[1:24:30] and our plans and our wishes and our
[1:24:33] will
[1:24:35] there was a rich young ruler who made
[1:24:38] his way to the top
[1:24:41] right i think brother brandon says
[1:24:43] perhaps he was a businessman
[1:24:46] had spent a lot of hours working hard to
[1:24:48] get rich
[1:24:52] let me say it wasn't really god's
[1:24:54] perfect will for him to have it
[1:25:00] because of god's will for you to have it
[1:25:02] that means you can handle it
[1:25:07] he struggled with that so it was never
[1:25:08] god's will but yet he pursued it
[1:25:10] and he wanted it and look what it did to
[1:25:13] him
[1:25:18] so after working hard to get it
[1:25:21] it became a foreign in his life
[1:25:24] and it got in the way of him following
[1:25:28] jesus
[1:25:31] now this man came running to jesus he
[1:25:34] wanted to follow him all the way to
[1:25:35] heaven
[1:25:36] what must i do to get there i want to
[1:25:37] follow you
[1:25:39] and jesus told what he needed to do
[1:25:44] but he refused he refused
[1:25:49] so my question is was it because of the
[1:25:53] money
[1:25:59] it's because he didn't do the
[1:26:01] prerequisite
[1:26:02] he didn't deny his flesh his flesh
[1:26:06] wanted that money the bible says he
[1:26:08] walked away sorrowful because he had a
[1:26:09] lot of money
[1:26:11] and he was unwilling to deny his flesh
[1:26:15] now i would probably be against any
[1:26:17] preacher that would come up here and
[1:26:18] tell you to give all your money
[1:26:22] but i'm telling you if jesus did it i'd
[1:26:25] say amen to it
[1:26:27] and jesus told him what to do
[1:26:31] but he didn't have the prerequisite to
[1:26:33] follow him he wanted to follow him
[1:26:36] with his money
[1:26:40] but why can't you just you know have
[1:26:43] this money and still
[1:26:44] follow the lord because that
[1:26:48] money
[1:26:51] would get in the way from him picking up
[1:26:54] his cross
[1:26:57] jesus said that the cross says now you
[1:26:59] just you go give all this
[1:27:01] hard-earned money that you work for
[1:27:04] and give it to the poor right amen
[1:27:08] and i'm your treasurer come follow me
[1:27:12] but he couldn't do it he couldn't do the
[1:27:15] prerequisite
[1:27:16] yet this man he followed all the
[1:27:18] commandments from the jew think about it
[1:27:20] yes amen amen people are serving the
[1:27:24] lord
[1:27:24] and doing certain things without the
[1:27:26] prerequisites
[1:27:28] well this is my time my money i'm going
[1:27:30] to do what i want to do and it's okay
[1:27:32] is it is it god's will
[1:27:36] what would you give what would you give
[1:27:37] in exchange
[1:27:46] whosoever will come after me let him
[1:27:48] deny himself take up his cross and
[1:27:50] follow me
[1:27:51] for whosoever will save his life
[1:27:54] shall lose it every day
[1:27:58] i'm making that decision friends every
[1:28:01] day i got to make that decision
[1:28:05] am i going to live for me
[1:28:09] am i going to live for my purpose and my
[1:28:11] responsibility
[1:28:13] or is it going to be about god
[1:28:18] see satan wants us all to feel that
[1:28:20] we're serving god no matter what we do
[1:28:23] you might as well take this message and
[1:28:25] just throw it out the window
[1:28:26] we wasted our time
[1:28:32] people are exchanging god's will and
[1:28:35] god's time for so many things
[1:28:42] are we exchanging our soul winning time
[1:28:44] for
[1:28:47] brother mark brought that up in our
[1:28:48] men's meeting
[1:28:52] it's just not staying out of the bars
[1:28:53] and staying off the internet
[1:28:57] god has a perfect will for each and
[1:28:59] every one of us to be doing
[1:29:01] we should better stand up and testify
[1:29:04] this is what god's been speaking to me
[1:29:05] this is what's on my heart
[1:29:07] this is what he wants me to do we should
[1:29:10] be there
[1:29:11] because of our we you know we act
[1:29:14] like we got this relationship with god
[1:29:22] well if we got that relationship then we
[1:29:25] should
[1:29:26] be giving our time to the lord amen i
[1:29:29] can't see
[1:29:30] i can't see you all have to work really
[1:29:33] really hard
[1:29:35] for me for the lord but the lord says
[1:29:38] hey
[1:29:39] take it easy to some of us
[1:29:43] you know this doesn't make sense
[1:29:47] so this is an individual walk we
[1:29:51] we don't spend any time talking about
[1:29:53] anybody's clothes line
[1:29:54] anybody's living room what's what's
[1:29:57] happening in there
[1:30:01] but i do want so much god to deal with
[1:30:04] our hearts
[1:30:07] just take this word and take inventory
[1:30:10] let the questions speak to you
[1:30:12] amen because as far as i'm concerned i
[1:30:15] love all you my brothers and sisters and
[1:30:17] your own the same
[1:30:20] place with me wonderful ball
[1:30:24] just going down the road
[1:30:27] but yet i i just believe that god
[1:30:31] is wanting to challenge us
[1:30:34] to a closer walk with him amen how do we
[1:30:37] get that
[1:30:38] how do we get that i think if we're
[1:30:40] willing to deny our flesh
[1:30:41] i'll tell you what happens when you pray
[1:30:44] when you pray
[1:30:45] you automatically your flesh goes like
[1:30:47] this
[1:30:49] it just shrinks
[1:30:54] that's why prayer is a good introduction
[1:30:57] to get going in the right direction no
[1:30:59] matter
[1:30:59] where you're at probably why brother
[1:31:01] branham said you can't pray too much
[1:31:03] because you don't get puffed up in
[1:31:06] prayer
[1:31:07] but you can get puffed up reading the
[1:31:08] bible
[1:31:11] reading the message listening to a tape
[1:31:15] because knowledge will do that to you
[1:31:18] look what i know look what you know
[1:31:20] but when you pray the very act that
[1:31:23] you're on your knees
[1:31:26] when you could be walking around doing
[1:31:28] what you want but you're humbling
[1:31:30] yourself before god almighty it's
[1:31:32] it brings a humbling presence
[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:36] brother john i have other things i want
[1:31:39] to do
[1:31:40] besides this stuff
[1:31:43] and i feel
[1:31:50] consider
[1:31:53] what would you exchange
[1:31:56] your time
[1:31:59] see your will is your time
[1:32:03] your time is your will amen
[1:32:10] you give your time you're giving your
[1:32:13] will
[1:32:15] you keep your time but you say you're
[1:32:17] giving your will
[1:32:22] we have that's how you deny yourself
[1:32:26] that first prerequisite it's hard it has
[1:32:28] to be done every day i know this seems
[1:32:30] like elementary but it's so important
[1:32:32] to to really feel i'm walking close
[1:32:34] close with the lord that i have in a
[1:32:36] long time
[1:32:39] brother brandon told us that god is
[1:32:40] hidden in simplicity
[1:32:42] and i believe that these these these
[1:32:44] messages
[1:32:46] they're they're simple but god's in them
[1:32:50] amen god is worthy
[1:32:53] of our time revelations 5 11
[1:32:57] and i behold and i heard the voice of
[1:33:00] many angels round about the throne
[1:33:02] and the beast and the elders and the
[1:33:05] number of them
[1:33:06] was ten thousand times ten thousand and
[1:33:08] thousands of thousands
[1:33:11] can you imagine going to the bank and
[1:33:12] somebody's saying that next to you
[1:33:15] that's a lot of numbers
[1:33:19] imagine yourself being there in heaven
[1:33:23] these angels around the throne and all
[1:33:26] the elders
[1:33:28] saying with a loud voice worthy
[1:33:32] is the lamb amen that was
[1:33:35] slain to receive power and riches and
[1:33:37] wisdom and strength
[1:33:38] and honor and glory and blessings in
[1:33:42] and not your time
[1:33:45] and not your will
[1:33:52] is he worthy of your time amen
[1:33:56] think about putting your time in this
[1:33:59] verse
[1:34:03] if he's really worthy give him yourself
[1:34:06] you cannot give me you cannot give one
[1:34:10] another
[1:34:11] you cannot make anybody you can't make
[1:34:13] your dad
[1:34:16] you can't make somebody give their time
[1:34:18] their will
[1:34:20] but you can't give yours you can give
[1:34:24] yours
[1:34:25] and by you doing that you can influence
[1:34:28] me
[1:34:28] inspire me because when you do that i'm
[1:34:32] not going to see you no more
[1:34:34] i'm going to see jesus
[1:34:36] [Applause]
[1:34:39] if all these elders and these angels and
[1:34:44] we're saying with a loud voice worthy
[1:34:46] can you imagine being in their presence
[1:34:48] and
[1:34:48] you're saying cool man but i'm gonna do
[1:34:51] my thing
[1:34:58] amen
[1:35:01] god is worthy of our time don't exchange
[1:35:03] it for anything
[1:35:04] isaiah chapter six verse one we're going
[1:35:06] to go through these real quick
[1:35:08] in the year that king urziah died i saw
[1:35:11] also the lord sitting upon the throne
[1:35:13] high and lifted up and his train filled
[1:35:15] the temple
[1:35:15] imagine you're there above us with
[1:35:18] seraphins each one having six wings
[1:35:20] twain they covered his face twain they
[1:35:22] covered his feet twain they did fly
[1:35:24] and one cried unto another saying holy
[1:35:27] holy holy is the lord
[1:35:29] of hosts the whole earth is full of his
[1:35:31] glory
[1:35:33] and the post of the door moved and the
[1:35:34] voice of him that cried and the house
[1:35:36] was filled with smoke you surrender your
[1:35:42] will
[1:35:46] now think about it lucifer was in that
[1:35:49] atmosphere
[1:35:51] and he would not surrender he got to a
[1:35:55] place
[1:35:56] that he would not surrender his will
[1:35:58] amen that's when iniquity was found in
[1:36:00] him he knew to do right which was to do
[1:36:03] god's will
[1:36:04] but he chose not to do it yes
[1:36:07] that's right and in this last day jesus
[1:36:10] told us
[1:36:10] that iniquity would abound right because
[1:36:13] the love of many would wax cold
[1:36:16] yes oh because iniquity went bound the
[1:36:17] love of many would wax code he said
[1:36:22] so this is not far from us this message
[1:36:26] this isn't for another group of people
[1:36:29] this is for me this is for us this is
[1:36:31] for our little church
[1:36:33] to keep it clean to keep it the way god
[1:36:35] wants it to be
[1:36:37] psalms 18 verse 2 the lord is my rock
[1:36:42] now we all can testify this my fortress
[1:36:45] my deliverer
[1:36:46] my god my strength in whom i will trust
[1:36:49] my buckler
[1:36:50] the horn of my salvation and my high
[1:36:54] tower
[1:36:54] yes amen is he worthy of your will
[1:37:00] if he's that to you will you give him
[1:37:02] your will
[1:37:03] will you give him your time will you
[1:37:05] give them just a little bit more
[1:37:08] just a little bit more will you i'll say
[1:37:10] it like this will you consider giving
[1:37:12] god just a little bit more
[1:37:15] he's worthy he's worthy of it
[1:37:18] he created you you are his creation
[1:37:23] amen why would you the clay say to the
[1:37:26] potter
[1:37:27] make me thus he wants you to be
[1:37:31] what he wants you to be with your time
[1:37:33] you want to use your time
[1:37:36] see i have a business and i've been
[1:37:39] working for me
[1:37:39] and i tell them go they go and come i
[1:37:42] tell them i tell them to do a job
[1:37:46] and if they don't do that job they're
[1:37:48] not doing me any profit
[1:37:54] why would god have subjects
[1:37:58] why would he call saul right
[1:38:02] and so i'm just going to make him suffer
[1:38:03] a lot of things for no reason
[1:38:07] no it's for the namesake it was to win
[1:38:09] souls
[1:38:12] and at one time saul's opinion of jesus
[1:38:17] was he was unworthy
[1:38:20] but when he had that interaction that
[1:38:24] communion with him that time
[1:38:27] all sudden his life began to change
[1:38:32] didn't happen overnight but it began to
[1:38:34] change
[1:38:36] and he made himself a servant all
[1:38:39] that he might gain some the purpose of
[1:38:42] god
[1:38:43] he was worthy of god's time he gave him
[1:38:46] his life
[1:38:47] the life i now live in the flesh
[1:38:50] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:38:53] friends i know this is
[1:38:54] this is a this is asking a lot but i'm
[1:38:58] not asking it
[1:39:00] it's the word the word is asking it
[1:39:05] you you can disagree with me and you'll
[1:39:07] never offend me and hurt me i'm sorry
[1:39:09] just not gonna happen but it's the word
[1:39:14] it's the word that you're disagreeing
[1:39:15] with if you don't
[1:39:18] stay with the word amen right two more
[1:39:21] verse psalms 37 verse 4 delight thyself
[1:39:25] also in the lord
[1:39:27] and he shall give thee the desires that
[1:39:30] i want to leave you with these two
[1:39:31] scriptures
[1:39:32] delight thyself also in the lord and he
[1:39:35] shall give thee
[1:39:36] the desires of thy heart
[1:39:43] you got to delight yourself in the lord
[1:39:45] make him happy
[1:39:48] we've all seen the movies were there
[1:39:51] there's the king and the dancers come
[1:39:53] out and they're trying to
[1:39:55] or herod right that's scriptural herod
[1:39:58] he wanted to see
[1:40:02] somebody's daughter dance
[1:40:06] and then he was so delighted that he was
[1:40:07] willing to give anything
[1:40:09] right
[1:40:14] think about delighting yourself in the
[1:40:16] lord
[1:40:18] it isn't just making it to church
[1:40:20] putting the offering
[1:40:21] in the i did it he's delighted in me
[1:40:26] and go do what you want to do no i'll
[1:40:28] talk about your life
[1:40:30] your walk don't exchange anything
[1:40:32] delight yourself in the lord
[1:40:34] colossians chapter 3 we're going to end
[1:40:36] with this colossians chapter 3 verse 1
[1:40:38] if you then be risen with christ
[1:40:42] if you then have the prerequisites
[1:40:46] seek those things which are above where
[1:40:50] christ sitteth on the right hand of god
[1:40:53] set your affections on things above
[1:40:56] and not on the things of the earth right
[1:40:59] for ye are dead amen
[1:41:03] you're dead you gave up your will you
[1:41:05] picked up your cross
[1:41:06] and your life is hid with christ and god
[1:41:10] when christ who is our life show up here
[1:41:12] then shall he also appear with him
[1:41:15] in glory amen god bless you let's stand
[1:41:18] together
[1:41:25] i think the lafontaine sing a song
[1:41:29] is your life worthy i
[1:41:32] every time i hear that song no
[1:41:35] no no my life's not worthy
[1:41:41] this morning i sneezed
[1:41:47] walked into the um
[1:41:50] secretary's office and she said god
[1:41:52] bless you i says
[1:41:54] says i am i am i'll i'm not worthy of
[1:41:58] god's blessings but
[1:41:59] i'll take them but i'm not worthy oh yes
[1:42:01] you're worthy of them
[1:42:02] i says oh no i'm not
[1:42:09] we're not worthy of god's grace and the
[1:42:12] more we feel in debt
[1:42:14] the more we'll give him more
[1:42:17] and the more worthy we feel the less
[1:42:21] we'll give
[1:42:24] amen is your life worthy of the gospel
[1:42:27] amen that's
[1:42:29] that's if we're denying our will
[1:42:33] i think each day is different
[1:42:36] if we deny our will we pick up that
[1:42:39] cross
[1:42:40] god says you're worthy to follow me
[1:42:45] but if we don't do that
[1:42:49] we're not doing our part of the
[1:42:52] crucifixion
[1:42:54] because must jesus bear the cross alone
[1:42:56] amen let's let's sing that
[1:42:58] just ponder these thoughts
[1:43:02] must jesus
[1:43:06] bear the cross
[1:43:10] alone and all
[1:43:14] the world go free
[1:43:20] no there's a cross
[1:43:24] for everyone
[1:43:28] and there's a cross
[1:43:32] for me
[1:43:36] the consecrated
[1:43:41] cross i'll bear
[1:43:44] till death shall set
[1:43:48] me free
[1:43:52] then go home
[1:43:55] my crown to where
[1:43:58] for there's a crown
[1:44:02] for me
[1:44:06] upon the crystal pavement
[1:44:12] down at jesus
[1:44:16] purest feet
[1:44:20] where joy i'll cast
[1:44:24] my golden crown
[1:44:27] and his dear name
[1:44:32] repeats
[1:44:34] o precious cross o
[1:44:39] glorious crown
[1:44:42] o resurrection day
[1:44:48] ye angels from
[1:44:52] the stars come down
[1:44:55] and bear my soul
[1:45:00] away
[1:45:02] amen if you continue to
[1:45:06] play that quietly
[1:45:09] must jesus bear the cross
[1:45:12] along and us
[1:45:16] go free
[1:45:20] and if i could get everybody just to bow
[1:45:22] your head and close your eyes for a
[1:45:28] minute

[1:46:27] to pray for every one of you

[1:46:54] hands

[1:47:26] place

[1:47:37] way that would cause us
[1:47:39] to consider
[1:47:43] our lives
[1:47:44] [Music]
[1:47:49] you asked a lot of questions when you
[1:47:51] walked the earth

[1:48:05] about
[1:48:06] a real important thing those

[1:48:12] for following you
[1:48:16] lord we've all gotten off from time to
[1:48:19] time

[1:48:29] we've all been off we've all come short
[1:48:32] of denying
[1:48:34] our will kind of holding on to it while
[1:48:37] trying to serve you
[1:48:40] trying to ignore the heavy cross
[1:48:44] the cross of suffering and pain that
[1:48:46] you've asked us to pick up
[1:48:49] [Music]
[1:48:50] and still trying to follow you from afar
[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:48:56] today lord we're asking that

[1:49:03] just completely
[1:49:04] cover us and cleanse us wash us and
[1:49:07] sanctify us

[1:49:11] such a portion of your holy spirit that
[1:49:14] when we all get up tomorrow
[1:49:18] and our knees hit the ground
[1:49:21] that we can look seriously more soberly
[1:49:25] and more willingly to give up our will
[1:49:27] for that day
[1:49:29] lord that's why we've come today that
[1:49:30] our lives might be better with you
[1:49:32] tomorrow
