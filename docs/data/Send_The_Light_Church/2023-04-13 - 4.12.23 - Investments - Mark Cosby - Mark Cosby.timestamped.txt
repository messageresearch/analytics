[6:01] may they hear your voice and not mine oh
[6:04] fathers have your way in Jesus Christ
[6:06] and we pray amen amen if you have your
[6:09] Bibles will turn to Mark chapter 10.
[6:12] verse 17 and read through to 25 and I'll
[6:16] have you seated after that
[6:19] when you get to your we get the place in
[6:21] the Bible please say Amen
[6:24] and you beat me to it
[6:29] amen
[6:31] so Mark 17 or Mark sorry Mark 10 17. get
[6:35] myself mixed up and we'll start very
[6:37] familiar uh scripture we all have read
[6:39] it many times
[6:41] amen and when he was gone forth into the
[6:44] way there came one running and kneel to
[6:47] him and asked him good master so we
[6:49] could say it's individual was uh he had
[6:52] he had a desperation for something in
[6:54] his heart because he was running and
[6:56] came to Jesus and asked him good Master
[6:58] what shall I do that I may in inherit
[7:02] internal life so this individual was
[7:04] looking for how he could inherit
[7:06] eternal life and we're going to see what
[7:08] Jesus says next and Jesus said unto him
[7:11] why call us thou me good there is none
[7:14] good but one that is God verse 19.
[7:18] thou knows the Commandments do not
[7:21] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[7:25] do not bear false witness defraud not
[7:28] honor thy father and thy mother look
[7:30] what the Rich Young Ruler says and the
[7:33] answer is saying to him master all these
[7:35] things have I observed from my youth up
[7:37] so this man was in a a ill-famed person
[7:42] he wasn't a thief he wasn't a robber but
[7:45] he was a man who had good morals good
[7:47] integrity and he had uh something in his
[7:50] heart that he knew he was missing he was
[7:53] lacking and that's why he came to Jesus
[7:55] and we're going to see what Jesus says
[7:56] to that and then Jesus beholding him
[7:59] loved him Jesus loved this individual
[8:03] and he knew that this individual will
[8:05] lack something in his life
[8:07] and he wanted to help him any way that
[8:09] he could that's why he the fountain was
[8:11] open for him to drink but we're going to
[8:13] see if he was willing to drink from that
[8:15] fountain
[8:16] then Jesus beholded him loved him and
[8:18] said unto him one thing thou lack us he
[8:21] didn't say you like this that and that
[8:22] but he said one thing just one thing
[8:27] go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and
[8:31] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[8:34] treasure in heaven so he had an
[8:36] opportunity to invest
[8:38] and a Heavenly treasure
[8:40] and he says and come take up the cross
[8:43] and follow me so notice this individual
[8:44] this individual in order to follow Jesus
[8:47] he had to give up one thing and then he
[8:50] could come and take up his cross and
[8:52] then follow him
[8:55] and he was sad at this saying and went
[8:57] away grieved for he had great
[9:00] possessions notice that
[9:03] and Jesus looked around about and saith
[9:05] on his disciples how hardly shall they
[9:07] that have riches enter to the kingdom of
[9:10] God
[9:11] now Jesus isn't saying that you know we
[9:13] can't have wealth but he's going to get
[9:15] a little deeper into it because there's
[9:17] Christians who have wealth but if you
[9:19] look at this individual his riches was
[9:22] his God it was something and there's
[9:24] something in his life that he couldn't
[9:26] let go of
[9:27] and that's why Jesus asked him to let go
[9:30] of it because it was something that
[9:31] would hinder his walk I won't leave you
[9:33] standing too much and the disciples were
[9:35] astonished at his words be uh but Jesus
[9:38] answers again and said unto him children
[9:40] how hard is it for them that trust in
[9:43] riches to enter into the kingdom of God
[9:46] is easier for a camel to go through the
[9:48] eye of a needle than for a rich man to
[9:50] enter into the kingdom of God you may be
[9:53] seated
[9:54] now I want to I'll search that eye of a
[9:57] needle because a lot of times we think
[9:59] it's like a needle but if somebody a
[10:01] sister man if you could post up the
[10:03] picture what Jesus was talking about
[10:05] because it's not some needle but
[10:06] literally back in the old days a camel
[10:09] had to go through this small little
[10:10] passageway and if they had all these
[10:12] things on them they would have to take
[10:14] everything off and I looked it in the
[10:16] spirit had to take all the baggage off
[10:18] to be able to get in and so that Camel
[10:21] in order to get in he has to take all
[10:22] this baggage off to be able to get into
[10:24] that small eye of the needle so when
[10:27] it's talking about an eye of a needle
[10:28] it's talking about a small passageway
[10:30] that a camel had to get through and this
[10:33] quote will read see what a curse money
[10:36] enriches is no wonder why Jesus said
[10:39] scarcely a rich man can enter into the
[10:42] Gates of Heaven like the camel going
[10:44] through the eye of a needle has to
[10:46] unload his burdens and get on his knees
[10:50] and crawl under now take that in the
[10:53] spiritual so we we have to let go of the
[10:56] baggage that is weighing us that's why
[10:59] the Lord asks us to take away certain
[11:02] things and add certain things in our
[11:04] life for a reason because he knows those
[11:06] burdens and those baggages are going to
[11:08] stop us from serving him the way he
[11:11] wants us to serve him and he can get
[11:15] there but he has to unload first so we
[11:17] gotta unload first and I know I didn't
[11:20] get the title The Sermon but the title
[11:21] of the sermon is Investments and so we
[11:24] make investments every day whether it's
[11:27] stocks markets whether it's uh your time
[11:29] whether it's working out eating healthy
[11:32] all these things are considered
[11:34] investments in our lives but we want to
[11:36] look at spiritual Investments because
[11:39] it's good to do stocks yes it's good to
[11:41] do all those things but the best
[11:42] investment we can make is our in our
[11:45] internal destination this might be the
[11:48] last opportunity we have tonight to
[11:50] invest in our internal destination so we
[11:53] don't want to squander the opportunity
[11:55] to invest while we have the chance right
[11:58] now because tomorrow is never promised
[12:00] no matter how healthy you are no matter
[12:02] how much money you have in your bank
[12:04] account no matter how big your house is
[12:05] death can come knock at anybody's door
[12:08] at any time that's when you want to make
[12:10] sure that your heart is always right
[12:13] with Jesus Christ no matter the
[12:15] circumstances don't make excuses but
[12:17] while now is now make the choice
[12:21] so I looked up the word grieve because
[12:23] it says this young man was grieved so it
[12:26] pained and Afflicted him he suffered
[12:28] because he had to give up something that
[12:30] was so dear to him but he knew that
[12:34] there was something different about
[12:35] Jesus he knew it he saw it otherwise he
[12:38] wouldn't come running and say what must
[12:40] I do and then he was expecting something
[12:42] simple that he would just have to do
[12:44] this and he'll just enter in
[12:46] but the thing was it was simple but he
[12:49] wasn't willing to let go of his will and
[12:51] give God control of the steering wheel
[12:53] he wasn't he was willing to invest in
[12:55] his own riches in his own kingdom but he
[12:58] wasn't willing to invest in his Heavenly
[13:00] riches and Jesus loved this individual
[13:03] in fact I believe it hurt Jesus that he
[13:05] rejected him
[13:06] he came to his own they received him not
[13:09] he was one of those only that received
[13:10] him not
[13:12] so then Jesus turned and said how hard
[13:15] it would be for a rich man to enter in
[13:16] the Kingdom of Heaven like a camel to go
[13:18] through an eye of a needle but that
[13:20] would be impossible with man but he said
[13:22] with God it is not possible so I want I
[13:24] want you guys to think that I don't you
[13:26] can't have nice things and you can't
[13:28] have wealth I'm not saying any of those
[13:29] things but if that wealth gets in the
[13:32] way of your your heavenly vision your
[13:33] walk with God then there's a problem
[13:35] with it
[13:36] because Abraham was wealthy Solomon
[13:39] didn't even ask for wealth and God
[13:41] blessed me you know what Solomon asked
[13:43] for how to help God's people and God
[13:46] blessed him with that money see these
[13:48] kind of riches people are looking for
[13:49] more they can't get one million they
[13:51] want two million they can get three
[13:53] million one four million and that's why
[13:55] this individual this richer ruler had to
[13:58] let go of these things in his life
[14:01] so let's follow this Young Ruler the
[14:04] next time we find him in the Bible
[14:06] he as soon as he rejected the
[14:07] opportunity to follow Jesus he was laid
[14:09] down to him pretty stiff so we see him
[14:11] later in the Bible looking up his eyes
[14:13] in Hades and he saw
[14:15] um Lazarus
[14:17] and he said can I get a drink of water
[14:19] and he said there's a gas there's a gap
[14:21] between us I can't
[14:22] and he said Kiko tell my brothers you
[14:25] know about this and he said if they
[14:26] don't hear the prophets and all the
[14:28] Commandments right then they won't hear
[14:30] a dead man coming from coming alive
[14:32] and so it's so important like you said
[14:34] we have to invest every day we have an
[14:38] opportunity to invest in the kingdom of
[14:40] God and the greatest thing we can invest
[14:42] is our time it's the greatest thing ever
[14:45] because that's how that's how growth
[14:47] happened is time if I'm in the gym you
[14:50] got to put a little time in the gym for
[14:51] in healthy time so everything we do in
[14:54] this life involves time fixing your car
[14:56] time Home Improvements time building a
[14:58] business time everything is surrounded
[15:01] by time I don't know if we remember the
[15:03] the first sermon that we ministered was
[15:05] was the world's greatest currency time
[15:07] it's something you can't get back it's
[15:10] something if you waste it for the day
[15:12] you can't get it back from yesterday
[15:13] it's something that we have to be
[15:16] investing in
[15:17] so you see we want to hold on to
[15:19] everything that we can see human beings
[15:21] our nature is to hold on to everything
[15:23] that we can and then we try to follow
[15:25] Jesus but Jesus even said in the word
[15:27] pick you got to deny yourself first
[15:29] crucify the flesh then you can follow me
[15:33] so we got to let go of our own will in
[15:35] order to follow Jesus Christ with our
[15:38] whole heart not just part but the whole
[15:40] heart it's what Jesus is looking for it
[15:43] says but sometimes Jesus wants to us to
[15:46] turn loose of everything
[15:49] so we can get both hands on him we can't
[15:53] have one hand here and one hand holding
[15:55] under this Jesus said you can't serve
[15:57] God in men at the same time it's
[15:58] impossible you can't because you'll love
[16:00] the one more than the other
[16:02] so if you notice when Jesus encounters
[16:05] individual he didn't Pat him on the back
[16:07] say oh you're a good man you're
[16:09] following these Commandments I'm so
[16:10] proud you come follow me but he gave him
[16:12] another commandment notice that he gave
[16:14] him another commandment and he choose
[16:16] not to follow that commandment which is
[16:18] called what iniquity Disobedience and so
[16:21] when God is asking us to do something no
[16:23] matter how bad it hurts in fact I think
[16:26] we can say when something hurts like
[16:28] that we know it's the Lord because if it
[16:30] hurts your flesh
[16:31] then you know that you're going down a
[16:33] straight and narrow if it's easy and
[16:36] relaxing then there's got to be a
[16:37] question I think we've got to have a
[16:39] question involved so let's go to Matthew
[16:41] 19.
[16:48] and we'll reverses 16 through 24 is the
[16:50] same story
[16:52] um we just read but
[16:53] so it says Matthews Matthew 19 16.
[16:58] I'll read it on the board and behold one
[17:00] came and said unto him good Master what
[17:02] good thing shall I do see man is always
[17:04] looking for one thing to do to get
[17:08] internal life we're looking for the Easy
[17:09] Street and this young man I believe
[17:11] thought what Jesus is going to say is
[17:12] going to be something easy well I'm
[17:14] following the Commandments sorry he's
[17:15] going to say something a little easy
[17:16] that I can follow that I may have
[17:18] eternal life verse 17 please
[17:20] and he said unto him why call us doubt
[17:22] me good there is none good but one that
[17:24] is God but if thou will enter into life
[17:27] keep the Commandments and that one
[17:28] Commandment that he said to him he could
[17:31] enter into life right then and there but
[17:34] he he chose not to enter into life he
[17:36] chose to keep following these
[17:38] Commandments I guarantee I bet you that
[17:41] he kept following these Commandments
[17:43] kept living a holy moral life and you
[17:46] can do that but the Muslims do that see
[17:49] you gotta have see it's not about living
[17:51] a good life but it's about having a a
[17:53] life behind the good life that makes
[17:55] sense
[17:56] so you got to have a good life Behind
[17:58] The Good Life something that's in here
[18:00] that is going to manifest out there
[18:02] because anybody can live a good life
[18:04] anybody cannot drink or smoke or gamble
[18:07] there's people who don't even serve God
[18:08] who don't drink gamble or smoke that
[18:10] doesn't make him any closer to God than
[18:12] uh that other person over there
[18:15] so look at verse 18.
[18:17] and he said unto him which Jesus said
[18:20] thou shall do no murder thou should not
[18:22] commit adultery thou shall not steal
[18:23] thou shall not bear false witness verse
[18:25] 19 please honor thy father thy mother
[18:28] and thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[18:30] thyself I'll go to verse 20.
[18:32] the young man saying to him all these
[18:34] things have I kept from my youth up what
[18:36] lack I yet he's probably all proud oh
[18:38] wow man I do all these things already
[18:39] I'm I'm getting pretty close to eternal
[18:41] life now go to verse 21. Jesus said to
[18:44] him if thou will be perfect knows that
[18:46] if thou will be perfect to enter into
[18:49] Perfection now I know a statement when
[18:51] Jesus said
[18:53] be be perfect as my Father in Heaven is
[18:55] perfect I believe Perfection is
[18:58] recognizing that you're not perfect but
[19:00] you're always striving to be closer with
[19:02] God because technically I mean if we
[19:05] look at it in a logical standpoint
[19:07] we can't be perfect the way we think
[19:09] what perfect is but Jesus is calling us
[19:11] to be like him so each time we walk in
[19:14] the light he's revealing to us we're
[19:16] walking I believe in Perfection he says
[19:19] go and sell all that thou has because he
[19:21] says if thou will be perfect go and sell
[19:23] that thou has and give to the poor and
[19:25] thou shall have treasure in heaven and
[19:28] come and follow me verse 22.
[19:33] but when a young man heard that saying
[19:35] he went away sorrowful for he had great
[19:38] possessions verse 23 then set Jesus unto
[19:41] his disciples verily I say unto you that
[19:44] a rich man shall hardly enter into the
[19:46] Kingdom of Heaven verse 24 and again I
[19:50] say into it it's easier for a camel to
[19:52] go through the eye of a needle than for
[19:54] a rich man to enter to the kingdom of
[19:55] God so now we have that picture of the
[19:57] camel going through instead of a little
[20:00] needle so we see that we got to release
[20:02] all the baggage that we're trying to
[20:04] carry in because you can't you can't uh
[20:06] save your life and you can't try to save
[20:09] your life and live you got to lose your
[20:11] life in order to live so you got to lose
[20:13] all that stuff first and go in to be
[20:16] able to enter in to life and then go to
[20:19] verse 23 I believe
[20:23] 25.
[20:24] let me get there myself so go verse 25
[20:27] and it says
[20:29] amen when his disciples heard it they
[20:31] were exceedingly amazed saying who then
[20:34] can be saved and notice what Jesus said
[20:37] but Jesus beheld them and said to them
[20:39] with men this is impossible With God all
[20:41] things are possible so the more that we
[20:43] surrender the more that the possible is
[20:46] going to happen what we think is
[20:48] impossible God can make possible because
[20:51] that's the kind of God that we serve we
[20:53] don't serve a God who wants to make
[20:54] everything hard but God has hidden
[20:56] simplicity
[20:57] see this Bible isn't a bunch of do's and
[21:00] don'ts see it should become love to you
[21:03] you should you should do these things
[21:04] that the Bible is telling us because you
[21:06] love God not because brother Mark said
[21:08] something or or brother Ron says
[21:10] something but because you love God and
[21:12] your relationship is so important that
[21:14] you want to invest in that see a lot of
[21:17] people invest all their money into one
[21:19] stock and then they lose everything
[21:22] but I promise if you invest everything
[21:24] into Christ you will gain everything
[21:26] even in this world to come you'll gain
[21:29] so amen
[21:32] so and then if we keep going
[21:36] verse 27 then answer Peter and said to
[21:38] him behold we have forsaken all and then
[21:40] follow thee what shall we have therefore
[21:42] so we look at Abraham he had to forsake
[21:45] all to get Christ
[21:47] he left all that he knew all his family
[21:50] all his friends
[21:52] that a voice you never heard before
[21:54] and he followed it and gave everything
[21:56] to the cause and God blessed him richly
[21:59] he was the father of all nations in fact
[22:01] he's the father of our faith and if
[22:03] Abraham could do that without having one
[22:06] Scroll of Bible without having a whole
[22:09] group of brothers and sisters then what
[22:12] excuse do we have
[22:14] I think a lot of times we invest our
[22:16] time in making excuses
[22:18] and excuses will do you no good excuses
[22:21] will get you so far down the tube you
[22:23] won't even recognize it so let's not
[22:26] invest our time and excuses because God
[22:28] doesn't want to hear excuses I don't
[22:30] even want to hear my own excuses even
[22:32] though they sound good I can make them I
[22:34] can make them sound really good and I
[22:35] can change them up I can I can fool
[22:37] myself by keep making oh I can't do this
[22:39] because of this that and that now I got
[22:41] to do this and that and that and that
[22:42] and then you finally get so busy and
[22:44] then God becomes on the back burner so
[22:46] let's kick when an excuse comes let's
[22:48] kick it out because we a lot of times
[22:50] people use this I don't have time for
[22:51] this I don't have time for that and
[22:53] instead of saying that say this you
[22:55] don't want to make time that that's the
[22:56] that's the real thing what you're saying
[22:58] say what you really mean don't sugarcoat
[23:00] it because we have time
[23:02] we just have to our priorities have to
[23:05] be set our priorities have to be right
[23:06] your number one priority has to be God I
[23:09] promise if you put God first he'll open
[23:11] up more time for you in your life just
[23:13] put in first seek his kingdom first
[23:15] that's all he's asking his Commandments
[23:17] aren't Grievous
[23:19] amen and this Rich Young Ruler actually
[23:22] let me finish this and Jesus said to him
[23:24] verily I say unto you that ye which have
[23:27] followed me in the Regeneration God is
[23:29] trying to restore us
[23:32] when the son of man shall sit in the
[23:34] Throne of his glory you shall sit down
[23:35] upon the twelve Thrones judging the 12
[23:38] tribes of Israel and everyone that hath
[23:40] forsaken houses or brothers or sisters
[23:43] or fathers or mothers or wife or
[23:44] children or lands of my name
[23:46] a hundredfold shall inherit everlasting
[23:51] life but many that are first shall be
[23:53] last and that last shall be first so
[23:55] Jesus is this is a promise if you
[23:58] forsake all these things he's going to
[24:00] bless you a hundredfold for doing it
[24:02] he's gonna it's a promise don't do it
[24:05] begrudgingly do it because you love him
[24:07] because nothing is worth holding on to
[24:09] this life that's gonna you miss eternal
[24:11] life I don't care if it's the hottest
[24:13] latest Bitcoin stock I don't care if
[24:15] it's ethereum stock all those things are
[24:17] going to crash one day you could have
[24:19] all your you can have millions of
[24:20] dollars to crash just like that Elon
[24:23] Musk can crash just like that no matter
[24:25] how big you think you are if you're Bill
[24:26] Gates it doesn't matter
[24:28] because eventually you can't take those
[24:30] things with you the Egyptians showed us
[24:32] that you can't take it with you what the
[24:35] Egyptians happened they got grave robbed
[24:36] I remember Denzel Washington said this
[24:38] one quote he said you'll never see a
[24:40] U-Haul behind a hearse so when you die
[24:43] you can't take any of these Earthly
[24:45] possessions with you I don't care how
[24:47] what you I don't care if you got a
[24:49] collection of guitars of saxophones or
[24:52] the sign records by every artist from
[24:54] the 80s it doesn't matter these things
[24:56] are going to pass away
[24:59] ruler as we call in the Bible he passed
[25:02] up a great opportunity
[25:04] he had the opportunity to put his riches
[25:06] of this world into a guaranteed plan
[25:10] but he failed it
[25:12] he didn't do it he was given the
[25:14] opportunity that he could draw interests
[25:16] on it
[25:17] it's a prophet speaking and make a great
[25:19] investment notice that but he failed to
[25:23] accept that opportunity
[25:25] so much as many of us do today and we
[25:28] find out that it's not too bad but when
[25:30] we do it now although his plan was
[25:32] offered was perfectly Vindicated that it
[25:35] was sound when Jesus came to the Earth
[25:37] he proved that he was so this restaurant
[25:39] knew that Jesus was Jesus otherwise he
[25:43] wouldn't have came to him like that in
[25:45] that manner that attitude that spirit
[25:47] when Jesus came to Earth he proved that
[25:49] he was what he said he was that he was
[25:51] God manifested In the Flesh
[25:54] for he brought it a showdown and said if
[25:57] I do not the works of my father then
[25:58] Believe Me Not
[26:00] so I looked the word investment the act
[26:03] of investing the action or process of
[26:06] investing money for profit or material
[26:09] result we can put it in a spiritual
[26:10] sense the act of investing your time in
[26:14] God to draw closer to him that's what
[26:17] that investment we're trying to get and
[26:19] it's going to pay off if you truly spend
[26:21] time with God it's going to pay off
[26:23] every time your investment is going to
[26:25] grow it's going to grow substantially
[26:29] so in order for a person to invest in
[26:31] something anything you could fill in the
[26:32] blank a decision has to be made first
[26:35] you have you have to think about it and
[26:38] see if it's going to profit you or not
[26:39] that's what that's the first person a
[26:41] thing a person does when he makes a
[26:43] decision
[26:44] your mind has to be fixed on that thing
[26:46] so this young person's mind was fixed on
[26:49] his riches that's why nobody could tell
[26:51] him any different because he was already
[26:53] fixed on his his God his God was riches
[26:57] even though he he claimed to be serving
[26:59] great Jehovah but his God was riches
[27:01] so the greatest thing that we can do is
[27:04] invest our time in the Lord and you know
[27:06] how to do that by dedicating your time
[27:09] to him by asking the Lord what Vision he
[27:11] has for your life and go to Proverbs 29
[27:14] 18.
[27:16] I'm appreciate everybody is familiar
[27:18] with that
[27:19] that scripture
[27:24] so 20
[27:26] 9 18 it says
[27:29] where there is no vision the people
[27:32] perish
[27:34] but he that keepeth the law is happy as
[27:37] he so we need a spiritual vision for our
[27:40] life
[27:42] each God has each one of us a path that
[27:45] we have to walk a way that he wants to
[27:48] use us in and your walk is going to be
[27:50] different than my walk but our walk is
[27:52] going to lead to the same thing in Jesus
[27:54] Christ it has to
[27:55] so we need to be asking the Lord what
[27:58] Vision do you have for my life where do
[28:00] you want my life to go what things do
[28:03] you want me to do for your kingdom how
[28:06] can I be a service To You O Lord because
[28:10] at the end of the day I want to be on
[28:11] this Earth what you've created me to be
[28:14] not what I think you want me to be not
[28:16] what this person says but I want to be
[28:19] what you want me to be and you're going
[28:21] to find that in the word of God the word
[28:23] of God is going to shape you and mold
[28:25] you but the but the thing is you can't
[28:27] just read this as a dead letter
[28:29] you have to let God his Spirit bring
[28:31] this word to life we got to start
[28:34] becoming the word I think I said this
[28:36] last week you can't expect the word to
[28:38] conform to your life you have to conform
[28:41] to the word say if I'm reading something
[28:43] like oh man I'm not doing this Lord help
[28:45] me to
[28:47] to live this when I'm reading I'm not
[28:48] living right now but Lord help me I have
[28:50] faith that you can help me live what
[28:52] this word is calling me to be because
[28:54] this word is going to call us higher
[28:56] every single time we read it that's what
[29:00] it should do
[29:03] time is the greatest courage like I said
[29:05] before we must use this currency wisely
[29:09] the more time we dedicate to the Lord
[29:11] the more spiritual growth will transpire
[29:14] see it's not about the it's not about
[29:17] the the quantity of the time it's about
[29:20] the quality because you can spend two
[29:23] hours of just garbage quality and not
[29:27] get anywhere and you can spend 30
[29:29] minutes of quality time and get
[29:32] somewhere see man thinks it's all about
[29:34] quantity like I can do 25 reps no you
[29:37] can do less reps and get better results
[29:38] but anyways we're not going to talk
[29:40] about that we're talking about here for
[29:41] the Lord and so it's about the quality
[29:45] of your time not the quantity
[29:49] so what you put in is what you get out
[29:51] we'll go to Galatians six seven through
[29:53] nine so we all know this about what you
[29:55] reap what you sow if I plant a garden
[29:57] and if I tend to it properly it's gonna
[30:00] it's gonna grow but if I don't it's not
[30:01] but let's just see what the word of God
[30:04] says we're not here for what I say but
[30:06] we're here for what the word says that's
[30:07] what's important
[30:10] so Galatians 6 and read seven through
[30:13] nine be not deceived God is Not mocked
[30:18] for whatsoever a man soweth that shall
[30:22] he also reap so if you sow your time
[30:26] very sparingly you're gonna grow very
[30:29] sparingly
[30:30] but if you sow all your time then guess
[30:33] what's going to happen
[30:35] you're gonna reap bountifully so for he
[30:38] that soweth to his flesh so we can we
[30:41] can doctor this flesh up we can make it
[30:43] look pretty we can handsome get haircuts
[30:45] and all these things uh anti-aging cream
[30:48] but in reality every day you're dying
[30:50] every day you're getting older I got
[30:52] more gray hair
[30:54] we we're not here to save these bodies
[30:56] yes take care of your bodies 100 eat
[30:58] healthy exercise is good it'll help a
[31:01] longevity but we can't put our Focus
[31:04] just on that because even Paul said Bob
[31:06] bodily exercise profited little
[31:10] so they profited some but it profits
[31:12] little
[31:12] so
[31:13] for he that soweth to the Flesh of the
[31:15] flesh reap corruption
[31:17] but he that sowed to the spirit
[31:19] shall of the spirit reap life
[31:22] Everlasting so that's what we're looking
[31:24] to invest our time in right there
[31:26] because we want to reap life as
[31:28] Everlasting because these bodies have a
[31:31] time a certain time and we're going to
[31:33] go away if the Rapture doesn't come
[31:34] before them and we have to be building
[31:39] our Treasures
[31:40] on the other side amen
[31:44] and let us not be weary and well doing
[31:47] for in due season we shall reap if we
[31:50] flank not so we got to keep reaping I
[31:52] know I know times are getting tough
[31:54] times are getting harder it's getting
[31:55] harder and depressing dig in but you got
[31:57] to keep digging I remember this uh it's
[32:00] this picture
[32:01] um is these two individuals one's
[32:04] digging for a diamond up top and one in
[32:06] the bottoms digging for a diamond up top
[32:08] the top individual he got so close but
[32:10] he gave up he was probably like five or
[32:13] six hits away and the individual in the
[32:15] bottom he had the he had the attitude of
[32:17] I'm gonna keep going no matter what it
[32:19] takes and so that's what it takes Jesus
[32:21] said he that endures unto the end
[32:23] doesn't matter how well you start off a
[32:25] race
[32:26] if you don't finish it it's going to do
[32:28] you no good
[32:29] so you gotta you gotta keep pressing you
[32:32] got to keep enduring because our prize
[32:34] is life eternal our prize to be more
[32:36] like him your prizes rest is peace
[32:40] and we have to be seeking after that
[32:42] because we're not here to to build an
[32:44] Earthly Kingdom down here we're building
[32:46] a Heavenly Kingdom
[32:48] amen
[32:50] amen let's go um
[32:53] so like we said before this man made God
[32:56] of riches
[32:58] even though he was claiming he made that
[33:01] his God and we can do the same thing in
[33:03] our life if we put anything before
[33:05] Christ it becomes a idol a God in our
[33:08] life so we got to make sure that we're
[33:10] putting nothing before God I don't care
[33:13] if it don't put your family before God
[33:15] don't put your work before God don't put
[33:17] your Earthly possession before God
[33:19] everything has to be in his proper place
[33:22] if God's the number one priority then
[33:25] you can have a balanced life it's all
[33:27] about living a balanced life bad
[33:29] balanced busy and focused that's the key
[33:32] in this life if we get out of balance
[33:35] then that's where God starts becoming
[33:37] number two in the number three and the
[33:38] thing is the devil's so slick about it
[33:41] he'll give you excuses to say well this
[33:45] is important I got to make money I gotta
[33:47] I gotta pay my bills I got I gotta do
[33:49] all these things and then eventually get
[33:51] so engulfed in the cares of his life
[33:53] that you get overwhelmed you get tore up
[33:56] you get overcharged surfing that's what
[33:59] the devil's goal is if the devil can get
[34:01] your eyes off of Christ and get you to
[34:04] invest your time in somewhere else
[34:06] then he's got you to compromise on the
[34:09] word of God you're compromising if
[34:11] you're not investing your time in him if
[34:13] God is not number one you are
[34:15] compromising I don't care what the
[34:17] situation is you got to believe that God
[34:18] is bigger than any problem in your life
[34:22] you gotta believe the god inside you can
[34:24] handle any situation in your life God
[34:27] doesn't make excuses
[34:29] Jesus didn't make excuses and he's our
[34:32] perfect example he kept he kept doing
[34:34] what the what please the father
[34:36] he even said not my will but your will
[34:38] be done
[34:39] and he have he invested he invested in
[34:42] God
[34:42] and he showed us what invest what an
[34:44] investment return is
[34:46] he said on the right hand of God
[34:48] amen
[34:50] amen and this restaurant ruler as we
[34:53] call in the Bible
[34:54] he passed up a great opportunity
[34:58] amen amen
[35:01] so this young man was like the great
[35:03] Rich laodicean Church Chase so we live
[35:06] in an age where everything is go go go
[35:09] go go everything is fast fast fast fast
[35:11] fast Amazon Prime McDonald's Wendy's
[35:13] Taco Bell Chick-fil-A I'm sorry I love
[35:16] Chick-fil-A but forgive me but but all
[35:18] these things is just we're in an age
[35:21] where everything is so fast paced we
[35:23] live in a neurotic age
[35:25] everybody's just going a thousand miles
[35:27] a time and nobody can sit down and just
[35:30] be still and spend time with God
[35:33] and the age that we live in they see a
[35:35] great opportunity see they see the
[35:37] opportunity they have to invest in God
[35:39] something but it's not popular
[35:42] Jesus was not a popular man in his days
[35:44] only amongst the poor and illiterate
[35:47] the church of his day the denomination
[35:48] of his day or the sectarian religions
[35:51] had nothing to do with him and they
[35:53] claim to know the word of God they claim
[35:55] to read the word of God but there must
[35:57] have been something about him that the
[35:59] rich young fellow seen in Jesus that he
[36:02] did not seen in others so he could
[36:05] recognize life inside of Jesus he didn't
[36:09] recognize life inside of his rabbis but
[36:11] he recognized life in Jesus and it's
[36:14] something that he wanted but he wasn't
[36:16] willing to pay the price so we got to be
[36:18] willing to pay the price to receive the
[36:21] life of bundling that Jesus died for us
[36:23] to have we had to be willing we have to
[36:28] that that the common good sense to come
[36:30] and ask him what he might do because he
[36:32] had seen in Jesus that there was a
[36:34] quality
[36:35] that he didn't seen anyone else but you
[36:37] see he was a very rich with the things
[36:40] of the world we have a lovely picture of
[36:42] this at the Leo the scene age in
[36:45] relations three because you say that you
[36:47] were rich and have need of nothing and
[36:50] yet know us thou not but thou wretched
[36:52] poor miserable blind and naked so we see
[36:55] this age they're miserable they're blind
[36:58] and they're naked yet they're still
[36:59] claiming that God is their savior but
[37:02] they can't truly say that he's the Lord
[37:04] of their life because if he was they
[37:07] wouldn't be looking to any everything
[37:09] else but him so we see this age this
[37:12] spirit is constantly trying to get us to
[37:14] say that Lord I'm good enough I don't
[37:16] need any more and
[37:18] they may not say that directly but their
[37:21] life is proving that that these not the
[37:24] god of their life
[37:25] and so we got to get out see we're not
[37:28] uh get our free car that this Spirit
[37:31] can't get upon us that's why Jesus said
[37:34] in his word
[37:35] be sober
[37:36] be vigilant
[37:38] because your adversary the devil walks
[37:40] about as a roaring lion seeking whom he
[37:43] may devour
[37:44] so we got to be spiritually sound
[37:46] spiritually connected to be able to
[37:49] recognize when that spirit is trying to
[37:50] get to us because we don't have like I
[37:53] said we don't have a get out of free car
[37:54] we got to be feeding on the right things
[37:59] so we said before amen but the greatest
[38:02] thing we need to be invested in is our
[38:04] Heavenly Kingdom because the kingdom of
[38:06] God Jesus said Heaven and Earth will
[38:09] pass away but my words will not
[38:12] so they'll be investing in the gospel
[38:15] that's the only thing that's not going
[38:17] to pass away
[38:18] well no matter how how well Costco's
[38:21] doing
[38:22] it's gonna fall one day see what
[38:24] happened in Sears
[38:25] they were on top
[38:27] and they fell so no matter how big you
[38:30] are
[38:31] well in a worldly sense you can fall the
[38:33] bigger you are the harder you're going
[38:34] to fall remember that same
[38:37] and a question I'm going to ask you guys
[38:39] I don't want you to answer it out loud
[38:41] what kingdom are you investing in
[38:44] or are you building an Earthling Kingdom
[38:47] or are you investing in a Heavenly
[38:48] Kingdom
[38:49] we see with Matt we'll go to Matthew 6.
[38:52] verse 19.
[39:01] so we see what it says right here Jesus
[39:03] is speaking to us speaking to us
[39:05] so it says Lane that up for yourselves
[39:08] Treasures upon the Earth
[39:10] where moth and rust does corrupt and
[39:13] where thieves break through and steal
[39:16] the Egyptians I bet the Egyptians wish
[39:18] they could have saw that
[39:20] but lay it for yourselves Treasures in
[39:22] Heaven
[39:23] where neither moth nor rust of corrupt
[39:26] where thieves do not break through nor
[39:28] steal
[39:29] for where your treasure is there where
[39:32] your heart will be also so wherever
[39:34] you're investing your time in that's
[39:37] where your heart's going to be we can
[39:38] say it that way
[39:40] so we got to stop investing our free
[39:42] time and everything else but God
[39:44] because it's only going to lead you to
[39:46] struggle you're not going to have the
[39:48] power you need to overcome the trial
[39:50] you're in
[39:51] because we're if our heart is in the
[39:53] right place in God then we're going to
[39:55] have that we sung that song we've got
[39:57] the power
[39:58] we've only got the power for connected
[40:00] to him
[40:02] if brother Roger knows this if
[40:04] something's not a properly the
[40:06] electrical wires aren't properly
[40:08] connected it's not going to turn on
[40:10] it has to be connected
[40:12] and so we have to be connected we got
[40:15] our wires have to be wired to him
[40:18] amen
[40:20] so
[40:21] let's keep going
[40:23] where for where your treasure is there
[40:25] where your heart be also the Light of
[40:27] the body is the eye if there if
[40:29] therefore that I be single that whole
[40:31] body shall be full of light
[40:34] but if that eye be evil that whole body
[40:36] shall be full of Darkness if therefore
[40:38] the light is in the
[40:40] be Darkness how great is that darkness
[40:42] no man can serve two masters free that
[40:45] he will hate the one and love the other
[40:48] he will hold to the one and despise the
[40:50] other you cannot serve God and Mammon
[40:55] amen
[40:57] amen so whatever thing we have been
[40:59] investing our time in
[41:01] is going to be what is manifesting in
[41:03] our life I'm gonna say one more time
[41:05] whatever we've been investing our time
[41:06] in is going to be what's manifesting in
[41:09] our life right this very second
[41:11] we'll set a statement one more time it's
[41:13] not just about living a good life it's
[41:14] about having a life behind that good
[41:16] life
[41:18] so one of the greatest Investments we
[41:19] can make
[41:20] is asking the Lord how can I help the
[41:23] kingdom of God lord what can I do for
[41:25] you what would you have me to do today
[41:27] for your kingdom I want my will To Be
[41:30] Your Will Lord if the way I plan my day
[41:32] out today isn't your will redirect my
[41:34] day because at the end of the day Lord
[41:36] beginning of the day I need you to be
[41:38] the captain of my ship the leader of my
[41:40] life
[41:41] because there's no other leader I want
[41:43] you to be my master Shepherd I don't
[41:45] want the world to be my master Shepherd
[41:47] I want you to lead and direct my life no
[41:49] matter what it takes no matter what cost
[41:51] I have to pay I'm willing to let
[41:53] everything go to serve you that's how
[41:55] that's how real it has to be
[41:58] I know you remember oh remember this
[42:00] song
[42:00] I'm not going to sing it you may take
[42:02] all the treasures from far away lands
[42:05] take all the riches you can hold in your
[42:07] hand
[42:08] take the pleasures that riches can buy
[42:10] but what will you have when it's your
[42:13] time to die
[42:15] only one life soon it will pass only
[42:18] What's Done For Christ will last
[42:20] only one chance to do his will so give
[42:23] to Jesus all your days
[42:27] it's it's the only life that pays when
[42:30] you recall you have but one life
[42:33] we look at we look at Abraham's life he
[42:35] was willing to leave everything that he
[42:37] knew to go follow God
[42:40] and we'll go to go to verse Luke 14. I
[42:43] believe this is mirrors Abraham's life
[42:47] Luke 14 26 If any man come to me and
[42:51] hate not his father and mother and wife
[42:53] and children now I'm not saying go out
[42:55] and use just hate people I'm not saying
[42:57] that but if if something's getting in
[43:00] the way of your walk with Christ
[43:02] Jesus said that for a reason he doesn't
[43:05] want anything to get become a God in
[43:08] your life
[43:09] so if your father like if your father is
[43:13] was against
[43:15] the Lord you serving the lord making
[43:17] that decision and kicked you out your
[43:18] house then it's time to separate
[43:20] but if you have a Godly father praise
[43:23] God don't hate him
[43:25] it's not what it's telling you to do but
[43:27] it says if any man come to me hating out
[43:29] his father and mother and his wife and
[43:31] children and brother and sister yay in
[43:33] his own life also
[43:35] he cannot be my disciple so he's telling
[43:38] us we got to forsake the things
[43:40] that are taking us away from him that's
[43:43] what he's trying to tell us in this
[43:44] passage
[43:45] and whosoever does not bear his cross
[43:47] and come after me cannot be my disciple
[43:49] that's why this Rich Young Ruler cannot
[43:52] be his disciple he had an opportunity
[43:54] Jesus gave him a opportunity his hand
[43:56] was outstretched and he slapped it away
[43:59] literally he slapped it away
[44:03] amen we're almost done now look what
[44:06] prayer does prayer changed from Death to
[44:09] life so now we want to let's turn this
[44:11] corner now how important prayer is he
[44:13] was born in profit and his words were
[44:14] true and came from God and when
[44:17] hezekiah's prayer changed the opinion of
[44:19] God oh my I like that prayer changes
[44:22] things it's the most powerful force that
[44:25] God ever put in the hands of a man is a
[44:28] sincere prayer to offer to God
[44:30] Jesus said whatsoever you asked the
[44:33] father in my name
[44:34] that I'll do it believe it try it once
[44:37] and see if it isn't true
[44:39] now notice it says a true sincere prayer
[44:42] offer to God not just a high Lord by
[44:45] Lord and I'm done praying but a true
[44:48] sincere prayer a time invested prayer a
[44:51] quality of time invested prayer I want
[44:55] to mention that like we said before
[44:56] quantity is all or quality is always
[44:59] everything remember that it's always
[45:01] about that your quality everything you
[45:04] do if you're working at
[45:06] Costco if you're working at Pratt Miller
[45:09] if you work in that trusted tool
[45:11] whatever you're doing if you're working
[45:12] at home projects put all your heart into
[45:14] it everything you do do as you're doing
[45:17] unto the Lord that's how I try to live
[45:18] my life am I perfect at it no I make
[45:20] mistakes
[45:22] every time you cut Corners I promise you
[45:24] it will come back to bite you somehow
[45:27] some way
[45:29] and my brother Bruce said his statement
[45:30] are you willing to sign your name on
[45:32] what you did remember that Brother Bruce
[45:34] so are you willing to so something you
[45:36] do are you willing if somebody asks who
[45:39] did this are you willing to say this are
[45:40] you are you kind of like
[45:42] not even saying anything so it's all
[45:44] about what you're doing if you're
[45:45] witnessing discipline
[45:47] uh cleaning
[45:50] why clean toilets I love cleaning
[45:52] toilets and bathrooms I do I want to do
[45:54] the best job I can do I know it's funny
[45:55] but I love doing it some of our just
[45:57] cleaning stuff I just love doing it I
[45:59] put my heart into it and so it's all
[46:02] about heart God is looking for your
[46:03] heart at the end of the day that's what
[46:05] God is looking for is your heart
[46:08] amen so let's talk about one other way
[46:11] we can invest our time in sometimes we
[46:13] invest our time in complaining
[46:15] is that true
[46:16] about a situation we're in see we're
[46:19] real good at complaining
[46:21] but if we become real good at praying
[46:24] it'll Trump the complaining out
[46:27] so complaining is something that will
[46:29] hurt your spiritual life it will destroy
[46:33] you because when you complain you lose
[46:35] thankfulness off of God and now you're
[46:38] complaining see the children of Israel
[46:39] they had a complaining Spirit they're
[46:41] always complaining
[46:43] but God blessed them with shoes with
[46:46] food a pillar of fire a cloud
[46:50] all water they had all the essentials
[46:52] they needed literally
[46:54] it's like they're in the think they're
[46:55] in prison but they're not they had all
[46:57] these Essentials that they had but yet
[46:59] they still found something to complain
[47:00] about my brother Brandon said this
[47:01] statement if you're looking for
[47:03] something to complain about the devil
[47:04] will show it to you right then and there
[47:07] and let's go to Philippians 2 12.
[47:11] I think we waste so much time when we
[47:13] complain we waste so much time of growth
[47:15] that we could have because we're
[47:17] complaining
[47:18] it distracts us from the Lord and what
[47:21] he can do in any situation if we believe
[47:23] who God that God is God then why are we
[47:26] complaining we should believe that God
[47:29] inside of us is going to is only leading
[47:31] us to a closer more personal walk he's
[47:34] trying to shape you and mold you in
[47:36] those hard times of struggles and when
[47:38] he shapes you and molds he's building
[47:40] you because he's he's when he died upon
[47:43] that cross he saw a perfect your perfect
[47:46] sculpture the statue of a perfect man
[47:48] he's trying to build you into that why
[47:50] are we stopping the Lord from building
[47:52] in our life he's trying to build you to
[47:54] that perfect Masterpiece when you
[47:56] complain you're halting the progress
[47:59] because God is not going to be around a
[48:01] attitude of complaining God hates
[48:04] complaining we see what the end result
[48:06] of the children of Israel was we saw
[48:08] that we saw that and others had to
[48:11] suffer around them Joshua and Caleb had
[48:14] to suffer because of something that
[48:16] somebody else did
[48:18] so your decision the things you're doing
[48:20] is going to directly impact somebody
[48:22] whether it's a good decision or a bad
[48:24] decision
[48:25] so we got to be paying attention to the
[48:27] decisions that we're making the things
[48:29] that we're complaining about let's go to
[48:31] Philippians 2.
[48:39] only verses 12 through 16.
[48:42] and we'll close wherefore my brother
[48:44] wherefore my beloved I love how Paul is
[48:46] he's speaking to us my beloved as he
[48:49] have always obeyed not as in my presence
[48:51] only but now much more in my absence
[48:55] look it says this is a person right here
[48:57] work out your own salvation with fear
[49:00] and trembling so something that we have
[49:02] to do is a personal thing that we do
[49:04] brother John they can't do it for me I
[49:05] can't do it for him but then Marty can't
[49:07] do it for me I can't do it for him so
[49:08] something that we have to work out
[49:09] ourselves no matter
[49:11] X Y or Z you have to do this verse 13
[49:14] please
[49:16] amen
[49:18] amen
[49:20] for it is God which worketh in you both
[49:24] to Will and to do of his good pleasure
[49:26] but you have to let God work inside of
[49:28] you so his good pleasure can be done in
[49:31] your life verse 14 please
[49:34] amen do all things look what it says
[49:36] right here does it say this is a sum
[49:39] it says do all things without murmurings
[49:41] and disputings it says all things
[49:43] doesn't what you pick and choose what
[49:45] you want to do but it's saying do all
[49:47] things and disputes and look it's a semi
[49:50] semicolons right there so it doesn't
[49:51] it's not a period it's it's some more
[49:53] words to come after that let's go to
[49:55] verse 15. it's giving you it's giving
[49:56] the reason why that you may be blameless
[49:59] because your life is speaking to
[50:02] somebody somebody is following you your
[50:05] example so the example that you're
[50:06] setting right now somebody is looking at
[50:09] you
[50:10] and we're living Epistles for a reason
[50:11] so if we're complaining all the time and
[50:13] somebody sees that or hears that then
[50:15] you're setting a bad example to Christ
[50:18] that you may be blameless and harmless
[50:20] the sons of God without rebuke in the
[50:23] midst of a crooked and perverse Nation
[50:25] among whom ye shine as lights in the
[50:28] world we're all lights we want to make
[50:31] sure that we're shining and we're not
[50:32] just bringing Darkness to somebody
[50:34] go to verse 16.
[50:36] holding forth the word of life we have
[50:39] the word of life that I may rejoice in
[50:42] the day of Christ that I have not run in
[50:44] vain neither labored in vain Paul
[50:47] labored to give this gospel to you he
[50:50] was Shipwrecked stoned beaten that this
[50:55] gospel could be for the furthest of this
[50:57] gospel for us
[51:00] we have all we have it good
[51:02] we have it so good in this day and age I
[51:04] know it's the hardest age to live in
[51:06] but we got so much support brothers and
[51:08] sisters we have a wonderful pastor we
[51:10] have all these things we have we have so
[51:12] many blessings in our life but we still
[51:14] choose to complain about things I'm
[51:16] talking about myself too because I
[51:18] complain I'll admit I complain all the
[51:20] time I'll admit it I need to do better
[51:23] but we need to come together stop
[51:25] complaining and recognize the god that
[51:27] we serve
[51:28] can handle it can give us a strength to
[51:30] handle any Goliath in our life anything
[51:32] in our life we can handle it I'm her
[51:35] Billy Paul I close after this Billy Paul
[51:37] they asked his uh they asked brother
[51:40] Billy Paul about his dad brother brother
[51:42] Branham was the greatest thing you ever
[51:43] seen your dad do and he said how my dad
[51:47] could handle any situation that came in
[51:49] in front of his face he said that
[51:51] because
[51:52] that brother Brandon was relying on the
[51:54] guy that was inside of him
[51:56] to be able to conquer anything that came
[51:58] in his path see brother Bram didn't rely
[52:00] on his own strength but he knew the guy
[52:01] that it was inside of him could handle
[52:03] anything and I believe we got to believe
[52:05] the same thing that that same guy that's
[52:07] on brother Branham Jesus Christ is in
[52:09] you everybody
[52:10] and we got to believe that he said I'll
[52:12] be with you and in you and to the end of
[52:14] the world because I will not leave you
[52:16] comfortless
[52:17] he said I leave you peace
[52:20] giving us peace think about that come on
[52:22] unto me all you that are heavy laid and
[52:24] I will give you rest just put his yoke
[52:26] on
[52:28] it's easy
[52:29] simplicity
[52:31] so listen closely with his rise to our
[52:33] feet
[52:35] God deserves our time
[52:37] if you want to invest in stocks invest
[52:39] in stocks if you want to invest in this
[52:41] and that but your main investment needs
[52:43] to be in Jesus Christ he's the only
[52:45] thing that's give you a true return
[52:47] value a return value that will not
[52:50] diminish it won't depreciate because we
[52:52] drive a car off a lot you can drive a
[52:55] um a hundred thousand dollar Cadillac as
[52:57] soon as you drive it off the lot it
[52:58] depreciates but when you invest your
[53:00] time in Christ
[53:02] it's only going to grow right to the
[53:04] roof that arrow is going to keep going
[53:05] up it's not never going to go down
[53:09] so
[53:10] can we sing what a date it'll be so this
[53:12] thing about this
[53:14] the decision you make now to serve
[53:16] Christ
[53:17] you're gonna be able to sing this song
[53:19] all together
[53:20] because all these trials and
[53:23] tribulations it is leading us one step
[53:25] closer into our Heavenly homes
[53:28] there's coming a day
[53:30] there is coming a day when no
[53:37] heartache shall come think about it no
[53:41] more clouds in the sky No More Tears to
[53:47] dim the eye all this peace forevermore
[53:54] on that happy Golden Shore
[53:58] what a day glorious day that will be
[54:05] think about this
[54:06] what a day
[54:11] when my Jesus I shall see when I look
[54:18] upon his face the one who saved me by
[54:23] his grace
[54:25] when he takes me by the hand leads me
[54:31] through the promised land
[54:34] what a day glorious day that will be
[54:42] there'll be no sorrow there
[54:46] no more birds burdens to bear
[54:50] no more sickness no pain no more
[54:56] parting over there and forever
[55:02] and I will be with the one who died for
[55:07] me
[55:08] what a day glorious day that will be
[55:16] what a day
[55:19] it will be when my Jesus I shall see
[55:25] when I look upon his face the one who
[55:31] saved me by his grace when he takes me
[55:37] by the hand and leads me through the
[55:41] Promised Land
[55:43] what a day glorious day that will be
[55:49] verse 2.
[55:52] we know sorrow there no more birds it is
[55:59] too bad think about it no more sickness
[56:03] no pain no more
[56:06] parting over there and forever I will be
[56:13] with the one who died for me
[56:18] what a day glorious day that will be
[56:26] what a day a day that will be when my
[56:32] Jesus I shall see
[56:35] when I look upon his face the one who
[56:41] saved me by his grace
[56:44] when he takes me by the hand and leads
[56:49] me through the Promised Land
[56:53] what a day
[56:56] glorious day that will be
