[37:33] amen I just love that we don't have to
[37:39] have a certain criteria just whatever
[37:42] you have give it to the Lord offer it to
[37:45] the Lord if he wanted you to have more
[37:47] anybody gave you more he didn't mess up
[37:49] when he made you just what you do have
[37:52] offer it back to him because that's what
[37:55] he created you for the Bible says that
[37:57] we were created all things were created
[37:59] by him and for him and he wants to use
[38:03] us amen praise the Lord amen before we
[38:08] have you stand for the reading of the
[38:10] word we just want to talk about a little
[38:14] an announcement as we're approaching
[38:19] going back to our churches I'd like to
[38:23] ask each and every one of you to share
[38:27] your your heart in and pray about how
[38:33] you feel about it a one you would like
[38:40] to start because I just want to say this
[38:42] if anybody feels uncomfortable about
[38:47] gathering together in in a room
[38:51] then especially the size of our little
[38:55] church there then I do not want you to
[38:57] feel pressured in any way of course and
[39:01] if you want to come and and wear a mask
[39:03] that's that's so much in order it's what
[39:06] however you feel but we are going to
[39:09] have to make a decision and you are the
[39:14] flock and we're not going about to meet
[39:18] everybody's need there are some they're
[39:20] itching to get back and there may be
[39:22] some that are not the one thing I will
[39:26] say is we're going to be gathering back
[39:27] in the old church it will not be the new
[39:29] church it's by far not ready I mean
[39:31] everything kind of got put on hold and
[39:34] plus we found that there's more red tape
[39:36] and permits and things that we have to
[39:38] get so it's going to take a little bit
[39:40] of time so we will be gathering in the
[39:43] old church and I don't know for how long
[39:46] honestly it could be three four months I
[39:49] really don't know but as soon as we can
[39:51] get an occupancy to the new building
[39:53] even if it's not finished and we can get
[39:55] occupancy and get in there that's going
[39:57] to be a better much bigger area to
[40:01] gather and so that's a good thing now
[40:04] the bad news is as once we start
[40:06] gathering together inside the church
[40:08] there at Leroy Street we're not going to
[40:12] be able to do the live-streaming like
[40:15] we're doing now it just there's not
[40:16] enough bandwidth and we're not going to
[40:18] be there for a long time and it takes a
[40:20] while just to get things extended so we
[40:24] might be able to do more of a of audio
[40:29] the other thing we can do is is perhaps
[40:33] tape that someone had made mention about
[40:36] taping the service and then putting it
[40:39] on on the on the website to go ahead and
[40:44] be able to watch it maybe a couple hours
[40:47] later so that's an option if you didn't
[40:49] want to go to the church but you wanted
[40:51] to be part of the service it wouldn't be
[40:54] like that would be the only thing it'd
[40:55] be just a couple hours delay so I just
[40:59] want to give you time to think about it
[41:00] pray about it and then if you could just
[41:02] you know contact us
[41:05] you know it's up to you if you want to
[41:07] do to the church app that's fine
[41:09] it certainly doesn't matter if everybody
[41:12] knows your opinion if you don't want
[41:14] your opinion to be made known by
[41:16] everybody but you you're you're
[41:17] concerned about then you just you know
[41:19] text us direct and then we'll go from
[41:22] there
[41:24] praise the Lord we're anxious about
[41:25] getting back to church or anxious about
[41:28] getting our country back going again and
[41:32] at the same time we want to do it in a
[41:34] very safe way and we certainly don't
[41:37] want to start any more any more problems
[41:41] so the Lord give us grace wisdom and
[41:44] leadership amen as we pray together
[41:46] let's stand together for the reading of
[41:47] the word this morning we're very
[41:52] grateful for our mothers and what I what
[41:59] a blessing they've been through to us
[42:01] through life and as we're gonna have a
[42:04] little little reading here as well see
[42:05] in the reading that I know like I grew
[42:08] up Maine in a single-parent home and my
[42:10] dad kind of played the role of mothers
[42:13] and fathers so you know brother branham
[42:17] talked about that one lady who just when
[42:21] she had her baby she just kind of threw
[42:23] it over the bridge or something like
[42:24] that to the water and brother Brandon
[42:26] said that the possum was more of a
[42:28] mother than that one lady or that child
[42:30] and just kind of disposed of her child
[42:32] and so we see that a mother isn't just
[42:38] you know in in in people it can be in
[42:41] animals and then also it can also be in
[42:43] in in in in men and in brothers and
[42:47] sisters you know so we all have can play
[42:50] the a role in being a mother a man let's
[42:54] just before we begin reading here in st.
[42:57] John chapter 19 if you want to find out
[43:00] that spots st. John chapter 19 and we're
[43:07] gonna begin reading with verse number 25
[43:12] amen
[43:13] Matthew
[43:13] 119 verse 25 Amen if you got your spots
[43:18] there just hold them we're gonna just
[43:20] ask the Lord to bless this Ministry of
[43:24] the word this time Heavenly Father Lord
[43:26] we thank you for this wonderful book
[43:29] it's the only book that we could that we
[43:32] can open and know of assuredly that
[43:34] there's no mistakes in it there's not a
[43:38] book that we should ever question we may
[43:40] not understand it and all the doctrine
[43:43] but it's something that we can read and
[43:45] always feel comfortable Lord we're
[43:49] blessed just about to read it lore but
[43:52] today we're asking for the deep things
[43:54] of God that you would come and bring us
[43:56] revelation today through the service
[43:59] pray that you would bless the reading of
[44:02] the word Lord all the scriptures all the
[44:04] things that would be said that would be
[44:05] around the truth of this hour may you
[44:09] come and bless each and every one Lord
[44:13] as we commit this service now into your
[44:16] hands in Jesus precious name we pray
[44:19] amen amen
[44:21] Saint John chapter 19 verse number 25
[44:26] now there stood by the cross of Jesus
[44:30] his mother and his mother's sister Mary
[44:36] the wife of Cleophas and Mary Magdalene
[44:41] and when Jesus therefore saw his mother
[44:44] and the disciple standing by whom he
[44:48] loved he saith unto his mother woman
[44:53] behold thy son then say if he to his
[44:59] disciple behold thy mother and from that
[45:05] hour that disciple took her unto his own
[45:08] home
[45:10] amen god bless you may be seated
[45:13] Amen with just a simple title today of
[45:18] happy Mother's Day 2020 you know it's
[45:23] very difficult to preach
[45:27] on the same topic year after year and we
[45:31] just don't have that in us to preach the
[45:35] same thing and well you know many times
[45:43] we've we've looked at proverbs 31 and it
[45:50] is a tremendous tremendous chapter about
[45:54] the role model of a mother and we got a
[45:57] couple young mothers in her church who
[46:01] are just starting out and I think that
[46:03] is a tremendous chapter to read proverbs
[46:06] 31 because you just can't make any own
[46:10] kind of decisions in life and expect to
[46:12] get the results of what you get from
[46:16] being devoted to the calling of being a
[46:22] mother in the way that the gospel
[46:24] teaches us to be we also have in our
[46:28] church mothers that have children that
[46:32] are not babies but they're not quite
[46:36] teenagers yet and that would be a very
[46:39] good chapter for them to read I want to
[46:42] just encourage your mothers to read that
[46:44] chapter and to pursue in glean the
[46:48] things that we could from that we also
[46:51] got some mothers in our church that have
[46:54] children that are you know in their 20s
[47:00] and I want to encourage our sisters or
[47:03] mothers to to read that chapter if you
[47:06] have children in their 20s and I just
[47:08] want to say that when I look at Mary the
[47:09] who was at the cross of Jesus at this
[47:11] time she wasn't - - olds as she probably
[47:17] was probably you know she's probably
[47:19] about 50 I would think somewhere right
[47:21] around there and she's watching her son
[47:25] die on the cross and she wasn't too old
[47:31] to be a mother in fact the words that
[47:34] Jesus spoke there that we just read was
[47:38] he was he was giving her
[47:40] a job to do when he really looked at his
[47:43] mother says woman behold thy son and the
[47:46] disciple took her home and and yeah John
[47:51] had his part to do - to take care of her
[47:53] but also she had a part to play as a
[47:55] mother and it was to the disciple so you
[47:58] can see that no matter what age we are
[48:01] we can be a blessing to mother and to
[48:04] help other people and it we should look
[48:06] at it in a in a negative way you know
[48:09] sometimes we've heard we've heard in
[48:12] Shaymin on the on the men and that I've
[48:17] said well I just don't want to be
[48:18] mothered by you you know I just I think
[48:21] that we we need to respect a man our
[48:26] mothers and it's a role that I I I hope
[48:30] that none ever do away with I know
[48:33] obviously you can raise kids and be done
[48:35] there over but you know there's so much
[48:36] more to it and and before we get into
[48:39] this message I just wanted to read a
[48:42] little tribute to the mothers today amen
[48:47] and it goes like this a mother can be at
[48:50] one and at the same time both love lore
[48:54] and counselor to a heart sick daughter
[48:59] and the and a head football coach to an
[49:03] athletic son she's got the ability to
[49:06] meet both needs phrase God a mother can
[49:09] soul the tiniest stitch in the material
[49:13] for a dainty prom dress and she equally
[49:17] can experience threading to the heaviest
[49:19] traffic with a large station wagon a
[49:22] mother is the only creature on earth who
[49:27] can cry when she's happy laugh when
[49:30] she's heartbroken and work when she's
[49:34] sick a mother is as gentle as a lamb as
[49:39] strong as a giant only a mother can
[49:43] appear so weak and help us and yet at
[49:46] the same time can put the fruit jar
[49:48] cover on so tightly that even dad can't
[49:51] get it off
[49:54] a mother is a picture of helplessness
[49:57] when dad's around but a marvel of
[50:01] resourcefulness when she's all alone a
[50:05] mother has the angelic voice of a member
[50:09] of the celestial crier as she sings the
[50:14] Brahms Lullaby to a baby how tightly in
[50:17] her arms and yet the same voice
[50:20] Kendra dwarfed the sound of an amplifier
[50:23] when she calls her boys in for supper a
[50:27] mother has the fascinating ability to be
[50:31] almost everywhere at once and she's
[50:34] alone and she alone can somehow squeeze
[50:39] an enormous amount of living into the
[50:41] average day a mother is in old fashion
[50:46] to her teenager she's just mom to the
[50:50] 3rd grader and she's mama to a little
[50:53] two-year-old there's no greater thrill
[50:56] in life to point to that wonderful woman
[50:59] and be able to say to all the world
[51:01] that's my mother amen well we want to
[51:07] say God bless all of our mothers for all
[51:09] their hard work they certainly have to
[51:12] have had and have to put up with a lot
[51:15] at whatever age we are as mothers Amen
[51:19] god bless our mothers this morning well
[51:23] let's back to her our scriptures now and
[51:25] getting into this message there were
[51:29] three Mary's at the front of the cross
[51:32] and it was a very human moment for Mary
[51:37] the mother of Jesus and really for Jesus
[51:42] too on the cross he died as a human
[51:46] sacrifice he died as a human sacrifice
[51:50] Mary had heard the crowds just chanting
[51:54] I want you to go with me if you would to
[51:56] this moment just try to picture yourself
[51:58] there if you would
[52:00] Mary had heard the the crowds chanting
[52:03] all away with him away with and give us
[52:05] Barabbas just
[52:07] mocking to save him and to save himself
[52:13] but he couldn't she heard all that she
[52:15] must have been tore up to see them nail
[52:19] her son to the cross to a piece of wood
[52:22] it must have tore her up inside hearing
[52:25] them never caring about her son
[52:28] they had no love for him at all when all
[52:33] that her son ever did was love everyone
[52:38] without respect a person's Bible says
[52:42] when he saw the multitude he was filled
[52:45] with compassion must have been hard for
[52:48] Mary to see them scold him when guile
[52:52] was never ever found in his mouth to
[52:55] watch her son be disrespected when he
[52:59] never mistreated another human being
[53:02] people spoke out abuse Lee and reviled
[53:06] him when he never ever revolved against
[53:11] anyone else
[53:14] he was so precious in the sight of Mary
[53:22] and it must have been so hard for Mary
[53:25] to stand there while all this was
[53:28] happening and to see her son die and at
[53:32] the same time having people at the
[53:35] funeral that were celebrating and
[53:37] mocking making a holiday of rejoicing
[53:47] out of her own son's death she watched
[53:52] her son suffer as a man and never
[53:54] threaten people back he committed
[53:57] himself to the father's hand what an
[53:59] example of Jesus was for us brother Brad
[54:00] said in questions and answers in 1854 he
[54:03] said he was a man when he was attacked
[54:07] at the cross as a sacrifice to take away
[54:11] her sin he was a man with nails drove
[54:14] into his hand he was a man with thorns
[54:18] over his head he was a man with
[54:20] Mackey mocking soldiers as they spit on
[54:23] him he was a man that was bruised and
[54:26] striped and wounded he was a man he was
[54:30] a man when he cried my God why is
[54:33] they'll forsaken me he was a man crying
[54:36] for help but on Easter morning when the
[54:41] seals of death broke loose there at the
[54:44] tomb that was more than a man he proved
[54:47] he was God but Mary remember Mary was a
[54:55] human mother just like all of us and as
[55:02] a mother this must have been the hardest
[55:05] time for Mary in her life not just to
[55:09] lose her son but to watch him suffer
[55:11] outside the gate the reproach
[55:15] persecution everything that she went
[55:17] through I mean can you imagine having
[55:20] anybody at your funeral
[55:21] that was rejoicing that they were dead I
[55:25] mean it's no respectful funeral no
[55:32] respectful time of death there's a
[55:36] tragedy to Mary and yet to the world it
[55:42] was a time of celebration she watched
[55:46] her son suffer and not be able to do
[55:49] anything about it I can see the devil
[55:53] taking advantage of the situation and
[55:55] through every unworthy thought into her
[55:58] mind
[55:59] I'm sure the devil must have told her
[56:02] that she did something wrong somehow in
[56:06] raising her son to cause this end of
[56:09] tragedy in her life I know we're going
[56:14] somewhere this is not a normal but I
[56:16] just want you to go with me
[56:17] I wonder Satan reminded her at that time
[56:21] when she went a day's journey without
[56:24] noticing that Jesus was even with the
[56:26] family one time when we went to
[56:34] funeral what our one daughter wasn't
[56:41] with us and we didn't realize she was
[56:45] not with us until we were driving away
[56:49] from the funeral home going to a house
[56:51] and it was rosemary most of you have
[56:53] heard the story and we had thought that
[56:57] well somebody must Alice got her cuz
[57:00] she's not with us well nobody else got
[57:03] her she was left at the funeral home and
[57:05] all locked up so we had to go back and
[57:08] get her but I can relate to you know
[57:14] even the Bible says a mother can forget
[57:17] her suckling child but God can never
[57:21] forget his children amen
[57:23] praise the Lord Luke chapter 2 verse 41
[57:28] now his parents went to Jerusalem every
[57:32] year at the Feast of the Passover and
[57:34] when he was twelve years old they went
[57:37] up to Jerusalem after the custom of the
[57:40] feast and when they had fulfilled the
[57:43] days as the return to the Child Jesus
[57:45] tarried behind in Jerusalem and Joseph
[57:48] and his mother knew not of a twelve
[57:52] years old and did not know where he was
[57:54] at I want to say we could be doing the
[57:59] will of God because they were he went up
[58:03] there for the Passover we could be doing
[58:06] the will of God and never realized that
[58:08] Jesus isn't with us but supposing him to
[58:16] have been with the company went a day's
[58:20] journey and they sought him among their
[58:22] kinfolks and their acquaintance don't
[58:25] assume that Jews that Jesus is always
[58:28] following you he's supposed to be
[58:33] leading and guiding you don't assume
[58:34] you're gonna go do your your thing in it
[58:37] he's just gonna be following somewhere
[58:38] behind in the company of your of your
[58:40] friends or family he has a purpose he
[58:46] has a will
[58:47] amen we follow him amen and when they
[58:50] followed and when they found him not
[58:52] they turned back to Jerusalem seeking
[58:55] Him that's a great thing to do when you
[58:57] realize that Jesus just as an in your
[58:59] situation it's time to turn back and and
[59:02] start seeking Him again and it came to
[59:04] pass that after three days they found
[59:05] him in the temple sitting in the midst
[59:08] of the doctors and not and both hearing
[59:10] them and asking them questions if you
[59:14] want to find Jesus you got to come where
[59:16] the Word of God is at they found him in
[59:20] the temple amen because he is the word
[59:23] of God amen and they came and they were
[59:26] seeking the truth they're asking
[59:29] questions this is what church is all
[59:31] about it's what the Word of God is all
[59:33] about Psalms 27 verse 2 read it with me
[59:36] Psalms 27 verse 2 when the wicked even
[59:39] my enemies and my foes came upon me to
[59:42] eat at my flesh they stumbled and fell
[59:45] though a hole should a camp against me
[59:48] my heart shall not fear though war
[59:50] should rise up against me in this will I
[59:53] be confident one thing if I desired of
[59:56] the Lord and that will I seek after that
[1:00:01] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:00:05] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[1:00:09] of the Lord and to enquire in his temple
[1:00:14] we go there to behold the beauty of the
[1:00:17] Lord and to enquire how can I be more
[1:00:21] like you Jesus how can I live the life
[1:00:25] that you want me to live show me open my
[1:00:28] eyes I had a minister call me and he had
[1:00:31] been it's tell me some of the things
[1:00:35] that he had been you know ministering on
[1:00:37] and trying to show the people just how
[1:00:47] to get ready for the rapture and it just
[1:00:50] made this little simple statement to him
[1:00:52] I said
[1:00:57] if people don't really have a clear
[1:01:00] vision a clear understanding of who
[1:01:03] Jesus is they will never know what
[1:01:06] they're to become this way if the people
[1:01:09] in the world they look at Jesus as some
[1:01:12] Daniel grandpa or some Santy Claus as
[1:01:15] brother branham put it then they view
[1:01:18] that's all that we need to be but if
[1:01:21] they realize properly who he is
[1:01:24] then she'll know properly who she is and
[1:01:27] that's why we need to see Jesus clearly
[1:01:30] so we know who who to become and we go
[1:01:33] to the house of the Lord to find out
[1:01:35] where we're really out with God and most
[1:01:37] of the time we're not advanced
[1:01:40] we're not advanced you know it isn't
[1:01:43] like you know you know in class in
[1:01:45] school you know there were some teachers
[1:01:48] that were in advanced classes you know
[1:01:50] they they they kind of knew more than
[1:01:52] the teachers and what you're not going
[1:01:55] to go to to to church and be more
[1:01:58] advanced than God you know I'm saying
[1:02:00] you're just not gonna do that so we go
[1:02:02] there with the humble humble spirit a
[1:02:04] humble attitude amen back to Luke
[1:02:06] chapter 2 verse 47 and all that heard
[1:02:11] with were astonished at his
[1:02:15] understanding and answers and when you
[1:02:17] come to church I'll tell you the word of
[1:02:19] God's got a word and answer for you it
[1:02:21] should establish you if you got the
[1:02:24] right spirit and the right attitude and
[1:02:26] when they saw him they were amazed and
[1:02:28] his mother said unto him son why has
[1:02:33] thou doubt with us why isn't thou thus
[1:02:38] dealt with us behold a father and thy
[1:02:41] mother have sought thee sorrowing do you
[1:02:44] ever try to do something for the kingdom
[1:02:47] of God and somebody else gets offended
[1:02:50] because that's what Jesus was doing he
[1:02:52] was doing he was about his father's
[1:02:53] business but somebody was getting
[1:02:55] offended and that's gonna happen you
[1:02:58] tried to do something for the Lord and
[1:03:00] they're gonna feel second and there
[1:03:03] you're gonna you're gonna offend
[1:03:05] something it's just part of life and and
[1:03:06] when Jesus and he Jesus said unto them
[1:03:09] how is it that you saw me
[1:03:10] she not that I must be about my father's
[1:03:12] business and look at verse forty fifty
[1:03:15] and they understood not that the sane
[1:03:18] which he spake unto them I can imagine
[1:03:21] many experiences in in Mary's past life
[1:03:25] just rushing to her mind and the devil
[1:03:27] taking advantage of her lack of
[1:03:28] understanding now trying to stir up
[1:03:31] thoughts that to make her feel that she
[1:03:34] was maybe disrespected as a mother at
[1:03:38] times er or dishonored and and the devil
[1:03:41] just trying to twist things up make her
[1:03:44] feel not much like a mother like a
[1:03:48] failure
[1:03:49] I can see Satan taking advantage of the
[1:03:51] situation and bringing all kinds of
[1:03:53] negative thoughts to her mind you can
[1:03:58] see the devil reminding her of the time
[1:04:01] that one of the sisters in the church
[1:04:04] was trying to encourage Mary and
[1:04:07] reminding her how blessed she was and
[1:04:10] then Jesus spoke up some words and just
[1:04:16] took the attention right away from her
[1:04:22] it's in Luke chapter 11 verse 27 I
[1:04:26] wonder if the devil was beating her up
[1:04:29] and making her feel so bad and so
[1:04:31] unworthy what torment and when it came
[1:04:35] to pass as he spake these things a
[1:04:38] certain woman of the company lifted her
[1:04:40] voice and said unto Him blessed is the
[1:04:42] woman that bear thee and the paps that
[1:04:45] now has such and he said ëi rather
[1:04:48] blessed are they that hear the word of
[1:04:51] God II keep it I can imagine the devil
[1:04:54] playing with her mind it's a mother a
[1:05:00] human mother feeling disrespected at
[1:05:04] times I wonder how many times Mary must
[1:05:10] have been persecuted for having Jesus
[1:05:14] without being married
[1:05:19] it was well-known among the religious
[1:05:21] people of that day they referred to
[1:05:24] Jesus as born of fornication
[1:05:27] it's what the scripture says can you
[1:05:30] imagine all her life now she had her her
[1:05:35] she and Elizabeth she had her mom too
[1:05:38] she had those on her inner circle that
[1:05:39] really knew the truth okay but then
[1:05:42] there's all those other people where the
[1:05:44] devil is able to get in their mind and
[1:05:46] begin to think things and say things
[1:05:50] that they had really no revelation of
[1:05:52] and then Mary hearing about here the
[1:05:56] backbiting hearing things that were
[1:05:58] spoken I can see at this this time the
[1:06:02] devil was just tormenting her at the
[1:06:04] foot of the cross with just so many
[1:06:06] things rushing to her and here these
[1:06:09] people after mocking Jesus looking at
[1:06:13] Mary said there's your your son that
[1:06:16] look what it came of him guess God
[1:06:20] really wasn't with him yeah I could see
[1:06:24] the devil hammering her over and over
[1:06:27] the religious people wagging there
[1:06:30] hasn't not only at Jesus but at her
[1:06:33] because she was the mother of Jesus
[1:06:38] it wasn't a beautiful Mother's Day for
[1:06:44] her Mary bore such a reproach as money
[1:06:50] looked up looked upon her in shame and
[1:06:54] disapproval of of her son thinking about
[1:07:03] all the things that Jesus said that she
[1:07:06] didn't quite understand when he said him
[1:07:09] when they were walking when he walked
[1:07:12] and he tried to teach it he just had
[1:07:14] different ways I mean the Bible teaches
[1:07:16] us that no man knows the things of God
[1:07:19] save the the Spirit of God that's in man
[1:07:22] and worker or part natural or part
[1:07:26] spiritual and there are so many things
[1:07:28] that that Mary honestly didn't
[1:07:30] understand I mean her whole thing
[1:07:32] it wasn't from the beginning doesn't
[1:07:35] very beginning didn't understand the
[1:07:37] ponder of the things in her heart what
[1:07:40] an awful time it must have been an awful
[1:07:43] time of separation for Mary there was so
[1:07:46] much division among the people the
[1:07:48] majority of the people were so relieved
[1:07:51] that Jesus was dying and yet her Mary
[1:07:55] was crying for her son as she suffers I
[1:07:59] wonder if this was the hour that the
[1:08:02] devil reminded her of her son's own
[1:08:07] words in Luke chapter 12 verse 51
[1:08:12] suppose she that I come to give peace on
[1:08:16] earth I tell you nay but rather division
[1:08:21] for from henceforth there shall be five
[1:08:25] in one house divided three against the
[1:08:28] two and two against the three the father
[1:08:32] shall be divided against the Son and the
[1:08:34] son against the father and the mother
[1:08:35] against the daughter and the daughter
[1:08:36] against the mother and the mother-in-law
[1:08:38] against the daughter-in-law and the
[1:08:40] daughter-in-law against the
[1:08:41] mother-in-law I can see the devil
[1:08:44] telling her that this was happening was
[1:08:47] the result of the type of attitude that
[1:08:50] her son projected in his teaching that
[1:08:55] he was just getting the result of
[1:08:57] certain things that he spoke that they
[1:08:59] did not know what he meant when he spoke
[1:09:02] him sure the devil was telling her that
[1:09:07] she was a failure as a mother that she
[1:09:12] didn't do things or say things or act
[1:09:15] the right way that she should have at
[1:09:17] the time and because of that she
[1:09:21] couldn't have stood she could have
[1:09:23] stopped the situation if she would have
[1:09:25] made different choices the devil was
[1:09:27] just pounding her head now there's no
[1:09:31] time to make it out to talk about those
[1:09:34] ways because the devil was making her
[1:09:36] feel so bad I hardly know a death that
[1:09:42] somebody has where the devil don't come
[1:09:45] by
[1:09:46] and blame that person that they could
[1:09:48] have changed it I'll remember that
[1:09:51] remember the day that my brother died is
[1:09:54] clear as anything I remember his anger
[1:09:58] was just so high the anger drove him to
[1:10:05] do something that he should have done
[1:10:08] and I remember
[1:10:10] whereas he sat in the car the door was
[1:10:15] open
[1:10:15] not was kneeling in the dirt and I was
[1:10:18] pleading for him to stop - don't go away
[1:10:24] like this no it wasn't a pretty scene it
[1:10:33] wasn't beautiful at all and I just
[1:10:37] remember spending time with my dad
[1:10:40] afterwards the devil beaten him up over
[1:10:43] the head beat me up over the head the
[1:10:50] devil likes to take advantage of a
[1:10:52] situation that is out of our control and
[1:10:58] so often he takes and he wants to
[1:11:00] torment us and and make us feel so bad
[1:11:04] so hopeless it wasn't a pretty Mother's
[1:11:09] Day for Mary the devil taken advantage
[1:11:17] in our opening Scripture and when Jesus
[1:11:21] therefore saw his mother and his
[1:11:24] disciples standing by excuse me
[1:11:29] whom he loved I love that he saw his
[1:11:36] disciple he saw Mary of course there was
[1:11:40] other Mary's but he was focusing on his
[1:11:43] mother and he loved them here he was
[1:11:47] suffering
[1:11:49] Harry was dying here he was with a
[1:11:53] greater purpose set
[1:11:59] to follow to bring salvation to pay the
[1:12:04] price to bring salvation to every lost
[1:12:08] soul and yet the natural park was
[1:12:15] looking at the suffering of his mother
[1:12:18] the suffering of his son and he gave
[1:12:22] expensive instructions what to do from
[1:12:26] the cross he didn't say hey look I got
[1:12:30] things going so racket in my life you
[1:12:32] just figured out yourself you know a lot
[1:12:35] of times people are just clueless how to
[1:12:39] help anybody when it becomes a difficult
[1:12:44] situation but he said to his mother
[1:12:50] woman behold thy son don't don't look
[1:12:56] here anymore
[1:12:56] you know the scripture says we know
[1:12:59] Jesus we knew Jesus as the flesh but we
[1:13:01] don't know Jesus anymore after the flesh
[1:13:02] but we know him as God amen as the
[1:13:07] spirit of the Living God then say if he
[1:13:10] to his disciple behold thy mother you've
[1:13:14] got a responsibility we spoke on that
[1:13:16] just a little bit and from that hour
[1:13:18] mm-hmm the disciple took her into his
[1:13:23] own home in the midst of Jesus suffering
[1:13:26] he took the necessary time and the
[1:13:29] leadership to help his mother and to
[1:13:33] help his disciple I just believe that is
[1:13:36] beautiful but what a horrible time for
[1:13:39] this mother and the devil tormenting
[1:13:42] their mind with so many thoughts what
[1:13:46] did she do she went back to the
[1:13:52] beginning what would you do what do you
[1:13:55] do bride of Jesus Christ when the devil
[1:13:59] is tormenting you or your son you
[1:14:05] mothers and your son looks at you
[1:14:10] wish he wasn't part of the family said
[1:14:14] things he shouldn't have said acted in
[1:14:16] certain ways that he should acted you
[1:14:20] feel about this big you go back to the
[1:14:24] beginning that's right to the time that
[1:14:29] you suffer for him you gave birth you
[1:14:32] how are you saying and you remember the
[1:14:34] time says he appreciated you helping him
[1:14:37] get dressed get fed the clothes on with
[1:14:42] the homework and fix the fix and make
[1:14:44] away like we read in that that paper at
[1:14:47] the beginning you go back to the
[1:14:49] beginning all the set marries I believe
[1:14:53] she went back to the beginning turn with
[1:14:57] me if you would to Luke chapter one read
[1:15:00] it with me she went back to her original
[1:15:06] calling from being a mother Luke chapter
[1:15:10] 1 verse 28 in d angel came in unto her
[1:15:14] and said hail not highly favored the
[1:15:18] Lord is with thee blessed art thou among
[1:15:22] women hey man it didn't matter what the
[1:15:26] crowd was saying and when she saw him
[1:15:29] she was troubled at the saying she cast
[1:15:31] heard my what manner of salutation this
[1:15:33] should be and the angel said unto her
[1:15:36] fear not for thou has found favor with
[1:15:40] God
[1:15:41] praise the Lord she found favor with God
[1:15:46] she was highly favored of the Lord she
[1:15:49] was blessed among all the women it
[1:15:53] really didn't matter what she went
[1:15:54] through because she had a revelation of
[1:15:58] who she was amen
[1:16:00] praise the Lord she didn't know
[1:16:03] everything she was in the flesh and she
[1:16:05] said in verse 34 she talked to the angel
[1:16:10] said how shall this be seen I know not a
[1:16:14] man I've never had a relationship with a
[1:16:17] man and the angel said I'm said answered
[1:16:21] and said unto her the Holy Ghost
[1:16:24] she'll come up on D brother John how do
[1:16:29] I help this situation that I'm in the
[1:16:32] Holy Ghost
[1:16:33] she'll come upon you stop looking to
[1:16:36] yourself for answers for problems look
[1:16:39] to the Holy Ghost he's got the answer
[1:16:41] he's got it worked out the Holy Ghost
[1:16:46] shall come upon thee and the power of
[1:16:48] the highest shall overshadow thee
[1:16:49] therefore also that holy thing which
[1:16:52] shall be born of thee shall be called
[1:16:54] the Son of God and behold thy cousin
[1:16:57] Elizabeth
[1:16:58] she's also conceived a son in her old
[1:17:01] age and this is the sixth month with her
[1:17:03] who was called barren for with God
[1:17:06] nothing shall be impossible to notice
[1:17:08] that God was interested in stirring
[1:17:12] faith now he could have just gave that
[1:17:16] faith to Mary that ain't the way God
[1:17:20] works he wants you to seek after him he
[1:17:24] is a rewarder to them that diligently
[1:17:26] seek Him we come and we hear the word of
[1:17:29] God it should give us faith to believe
[1:17:31] for the impossible
[1:17:32] hey man can't expect God just to hand it
[1:17:35] to you do nothing so he reminded her of
[1:17:39] Elizabeth who was called barren in her
[1:17:42] own age and got a son
[1:17:44] probably reminded her of Abraham amen
[1:17:49] nothing is impossible with God praise
[1:17:53] God and look what Mary said and verse 38
[1:17:56] her faith rose to the place where she
[1:17:58] said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be
[1:18:02] it unto me according to thy word hey men
[1:18:05] you that the job of the angel was done
[1:18:09] God was done with the message and when
[1:18:12] you're done hearing the message it's
[1:18:14] done it's up to you now to take a hold
[1:18:16] of that word and march forward with it
[1:18:18] and say be it unto me Lord according to
[1:18:21] that word let it be done that may be the
[1:18:23] Christian you want me to be let me be
[1:18:25] the bride of that you called me to be
[1:18:28] praise the Lord
[1:18:30] I'll tell you Saints when when the devil
[1:18:33] is tormenting you sometimes we just have
[1:18:36] to go
[1:18:37] to the foundation of when God called us
[1:18:40] to the very beginning when God first
[1:18:44] called your heart to be the birthplace
[1:18:46] of His Son Jesus Christ just like Mary
[1:18:51] and he told you you were highly favored
[1:18:54] of the Lord Amen that you were chosen by
[1:18:59] God Amen that you are blessed among
[1:19:02] Christians a man that you were elected
[1:19:05] from the foundation of the world that's
[1:19:07] where you go back when Saint begins to
[1:19:10] work on you and begins to try to twist
[1:19:12] you and take you down bunny trails and
[1:19:14] say that your situation is unconceivable
[1:19:17] it is unmanageable is unworkable it
[1:19:20] looks hopeless you go back to the
[1:19:22] beginning where God calls you I'll never
[1:19:24] leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be
[1:19:27] with you to the very end
[1:19:28] and it won't be always easy Saints but
[1:19:32] he's with us yes God so loved the world
[1:19:37] but he chose us he called the whole
[1:19:42] world he died for the whole world but
[1:19:47] you know the world didn't respond to him
[1:19:50] John 1 verse 11 he came to his own and
[1:19:55] his own received him not but as many as
[1:19:59] received him to them gave he power to
[1:20:03] become the sons of God even to them that
[1:20:06] believe on his name which were born not
[1:20:09] of blood nor the will of the flesh nor
[1:20:11] the will man son of God think about it
[1:20:16] God chose to bring light into your life
[1:20:20] and then the gospel into you to bring
[1:20:23] you out of darkness into his marvelous
[1:20:26] like you've been chosen
[1:20:27] you were once aliens from God separated
[1:20:31] from God without God having no hope but
[1:20:34] God brought you out of darkness and he
[1:20:37] made you the children of light we've
[1:20:41] been chosen of the Lord highly favored
[1:20:44] today Deuteronomy chapter 7 verse 6
[1:20:49] for thou art a holy people unto the Lord
[1:20:54] thy God the Lord thy God have chosen
[1:20:57] thee to be a special people unto himself
[1:21:00] above all the people that are upon the
[1:21:03] face of the earth the Lord did not set
[1:21:07] his love upon you nor choose you because
[1:21:10] you were more in number than any people
[1:21:13] for you were the fewest of all people
[1:21:16] but because the Lord loved you he chose
[1:21:25] you God knew God knew when he called
[1:21:30] Mary at the beginning before the Holy
[1:21:35] Ghost
[1:21:35] overshadowed her God knew there was
[1:21:39] something in Mary that would be able to
[1:21:42] stand the test and go through what she
[1:21:44] had to at Calvary to go through the
[1:21:47] hardships to go through all the times of
[1:21:50] misunderstandings and not knowing why
[1:21:52] her son or children do the things that
[1:21:55] they do there was something inside of
[1:21:59] Mary she had character Psalms 91 verse
[1:22:05] 14 because he have set his love upon me
[1:22:11] therefore well I deliver him you want
[1:22:14] God to deliver you from your situation
[1:22:16] set your love upon him he's already
[1:22:19] proved he set his love upon you he's
[1:22:21] already chosen you he's already proved
[1:22:24] it something in your heart says Amen is
[1:22:26] too I feel it now such your love upon
[1:22:28] him and he will deliver you Amen we all
[1:22:32] need deliverance or something in our
[1:22:34] life that we need to be delivered from
[1:22:36] and when God delivers us from that
[1:22:38] there'll be something more than God
[1:22:39] wants to deliver us from because God is
[1:22:42] calling us to be a bride without spot
[1:22:44] without Waco praise the Lord he's chosen
[1:22:48] us because he loved us he chose us
[1:22:53] because he saw there was a seed of him
[1:22:58] lying inside of us
[1:23:01] he chose us because he saw a seed hidden
[1:23:05] in us Romans chapter 9 verse 29 and as
[1:23:11] Isaiah said before except the lord of
[1:23:14] sabbath had left us a seed we had been a
[1:23:18] Sodom and had been like unto Gomorrha
[1:23:21] think about that for a moment if there
[1:23:24] not been the seed of God inside of us we
[1:23:28] wouldn't be here in church today we
[1:23:31] would be out playing golf or doing
[1:23:33] something not thinking about God we'd
[1:23:35] still be aliens from God we'd still be
[1:23:38] hopeless without God but you know there
[1:23:41] was a seed inside of you and then and
[1:23:45] because that sees there it's gonna come
[1:23:48] forth amen praise God we're gonna be the
[1:23:51] birth place of the manifestation of
[1:23:53] Jesus Christ in her life we are miss
[1:23:56] Jesus hallelujah God is taking a bride
[1:24:00] out of the Gentiles for his name's sake
[1:24:02] think about it for his namesake what
[1:24:05] does that mean that means that she is
[1:24:08] taking the name of Jesus now tell you
[1:24:13] you just can't take it on your own he's
[1:24:19] got to give it to you it starts out by
[1:24:23] taking the name of Jesus Christ in
[1:24:25] Baptism amen it's taking the the you no
[1:24:29] longer take his name in vain
[1:24:31] Amen but you begin to honor it you
[1:24:34] worship it you praise it you do
[1:24:37] everything that you do in the name of
[1:24:39] Jesus Christ you pray over your food in
[1:24:42] that name your whole life you dedicate
[1:24:44] things to God in that name that name
[1:24:46] becomes your you're identified with that
[1:24:49] name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:51] and someday every knee will bow every
[1:24:53] tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is
[1:24:56] Lord of lords and King of Kings the
[1:24:59] Bible says that he gave him a name above
[1:25:01] every name that seed of God that sin you
[1:25:06] came from God it's a seed of God and
[1:25:10] every seed must bring forth of its own
[1:25:12] kind
[1:25:13] one just a couple of couraging
[1:25:16] scriptures along this line for you to
[1:25:18] remember that see that's inside of you
[1:25:20] Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 most
[1:25:23] everyone knows this for I know the
[1:25:25] thoughts that I think toward you saith
[1:25:27] the Lord their thoughts of peace and not
[1:25:29] of evil to give you an expected end amen
[1:25:34] there's an expectant end I'm telling you
[1:25:36] it wasn't pretty what Mary had to go
[1:25:38] through but there is such a reward
[1:25:41] waiting for her on the other side she
[1:25:43] was still blessed of the Lord to think
[1:25:45] of all the women what woman could go
[1:25:47] through what she went through what woman
[1:25:49] could stand there and say that's my son
[1:25:51] I love him I love him he's never done
[1:25:54] any wrong I may not understand I'm an
[1:25:57] thoughts going in my mind but that's
[1:26:00] still my son I love him praise the Lord
[1:26:03] Philippians chapter 1 verse 6 being
[1:26:05] confident of this very thing and then
[1:26:08] that he which had begun a good work in
[1:26:11] you will perform it until the day of
[1:26:12] Jesus Christ praise the Lord this is God
[1:26:17] in sea formed you are God in sea form be
[1:26:23] confident it will be manifest in
[1:26:25] everything that God is you will be a
[1:26:29] mint because it can't lie the seat of
[1:26:31] God can't lie well brother Johnny
[1:26:33] certainly don't feel that what you know
[1:26:35] I understand that this is what we do
[1:26:38] with that we don't let the devil take it
[1:26:46] and make us feel so rotten that we don't
[1:26:50] feel like trying or that we don't
[1:26:51] believe it we don't take it over here
[1:26:54] and say yeah I'm see you done
[1:26:55] predestined I'm gonna I'm gonna bring
[1:26:57] forth the manifestation out and no
[1:26:58] matter what you do brother sister it is
[1:27:02] right in the middle of the road sure the
[1:27:06] devil's will attack you make you feel
[1:27:07] bad that's his job that's what this is
[1:27:09] this is about that's why we're talking
[1:27:10] like this but it's our job to go back to
[1:27:14] the beginning to pay attention to what
[1:27:17] we are and to press forth into that mark
[1:27:20] t'k to come to the statue of a perfect
[1:27:22] man that's what God's called us to be
[1:27:24] now when we think about that
[1:27:26] seed the seed of God the Bible says that
[1:27:29] God is love and then so when we think
[1:27:33] about God we think about a God that is
[1:27:35] not just loving but he Islam a man he is
[1:27:39] the definition of love his seed is also
[1:27:43] love he didn't pull love out of his seed
[1:27:47] and say oh yeah you you just you don't
[1:27:49] have to act like your loving you could
[1:27:52] just a kid and the other way no no it's
[1:27:56] a you can't separate love from God
[1:28:01] the bride is full of compassion she's
[1:28:07] laying down her life for others the same
[1:28:10] kind of agape love not only capable of
[1:28:15] loving his enemies but it produces it
[1:28:19] you know if we don't want to say well
[1:28:21] I'm capable loving my enemy but then
[1:28:24] you're gonna pick and choose when you're
[1:28:25] gonna do it it should be an automatic
[1:28:27] thing with God there's no respecter
[1:28:30] persons with his seed there's no
[1:28:32] respecter persons he that his seed loves
[1:28:35] without dissimulation we just talked
[1:28:37] about this seed of love is maturing with
[1:28:42] Christ amen this love of God thinks no
[1:28:47] evil it speaks no evil it does no evil
[1:28:51] it does no ill to his neighbor Amen it
[1:28:56] is the love of God shut up in the hearts
[1:28:59] of his bride by the Holy Ghost she's
[1:29:03] highly favored to bring forth the love
[1:29:05] of God who praise God Mary was so full
[1:29:09] of courage and inner strength to weather
[1:29:12] the storm and to stand the test
[1:29:15] she had character as I was with Moses so
[1:29:18] shall I be with you as I was with Mary
[1:29:21] so shall I be with you bride amen she
[1:29:25] will have the same characteristics that
[1:29:28] her husband has courage virtue to face
[1:29:33] the mocking the reproach the
[1:29:35] persecutions the back by thee whatever
[1:29:37] you're going through it can
[1:29:39] and the test amen love bears all things
[1:29:41] endures all things
[1:29:43] amen it believes all things it blesses
[1:29:46] and it doesn't curse on again si bless
[1:29:48] and curse not she's a peacemaker
[1:29:52] hallelujah just like her husband
[1:29:57] Jesus was a peacemaker yes he yes he was
[1:30:03] a peacemaker I know somebody is thinking
[1:30:07] I remember a time he wasn't I remember
[1:30:09] how things he spoke yes he turned the
[1:30:15] money changers tables over he got the
[1:30:18] whip out now he's allowed to do that
[1:30:22] because he's God vengeance is mine
[1:30:26] sayeth the Lord I will repay God is the
[1:30:29] one that straightens things out and he
[1:30:32] has a fivefold ministry that beareth not
[1:30:34] the sword in vain the Bible says for he
[1:30:37] is a minister of God a revenger to
[1:30:40] execute the wrath upon them that doeth
[1:30:43] evil but the life that Jesus lived in
[1:30:48] the way that he conducted himself just
[1:30:50] like the fivefold ministry is in peace
[1:31:01] for peace nabob Oh tells us is a fruit
[1:31:04] of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:07] Jesus was a peacemaker at times he could
[1:31:14] judge everyone he was still a peacemaker
[1:31:18] when it came to politics he said give
[1:31:20] two Caesars with Caesars gift it to God
[1:31:24] what's God's in other words in the
[1:31:26] natural you go pay your taxes in the
[1:31:30] spiritual you get your ties when it
[1:31:34] comes to sin there's a woman caught in
[1:31:38] the very act of adultery he could have
[1:31:41] judged them but he brought peace to the
[1:31:44] whole situation and he did it with such
[1:31:48] wisdom he didn't start accusing
[1:31:53] everybody of all the sins that they did
[1:31:59] yeah we it's very possible he wrote him
[1:32:02] in the sands but you know what he didn't
[1:32:05] go blab him out so everybody else to
[1:32:06] hear he had respect he handled
[1:32:10] everything decently in an order and he
[1:32:14] was left just with the woman that was
[1:32:16] caught in the very sim he says where's
[1:32:20] your accusers where are those that run
[1:32:23] into stone you and kill you just now
[1:32:24] just like a lot of people do with their
[1:32:26] mouths he said they're all gone why are
[1:32:32] they gone because Jesus stepped in he
[1:32:37] produced peace where there was no peace
[1:32:41] and Jesus just said I don't condemn you
[1:32:45] either you go and sin no more start
[1:32:48] walking in the right direction Amen now
[1:32:52] he brought peace even amongst believers
[1:32:59] remember his disciples they were
[1:33:03] fighting about who was better
[1:33:06] who was the greater who had more
[1:33:12] authority who was gonna sit closer to
[1:33:14] God in heaven and expressing that they
[1:33:19] would never do something he'll to the
[1:33:21] Lord they would never cross him when
[1:33:25] we've all crossed him Luke chapter 22
[1:33:29] verse 25 hope you're getting something
[1:33:32] out of this and he said unto them the
[1:33:34] kings of the Gentiles they exercise
[1:33:37] lordship over them and they that
[1:33:39] exercise authority upon them are called
[1:33:42] benefactors benefactors and ye shall not
[1:33:49] and ye shall not be sold but he that is
[1:33:52] greatest among you let him be like the
[1:33:55] younger and he that his chief is he does
[1:33:58] serve and I looked at that word
[1:34:00] benefactors and it means a feed lamp
[1:34:06] pitous feel and purchase and this is
[1:34:08] where we need brother Marty brother
[1:34:10] Marty also if you were here I would be
[1:34:12] giving you my tie it is just too long
[1:34:14] for me but that word means a
[1:34:19] philanthropist means a person who seeks
[1:34:23] to promote the welfare of others
[1:34:26] especially by the generosity a generous
[1:34:30] donation of money to good causes so
[1:34:33] we're in a benefactor he wants to do
[1:34:35] good and Jesus says we're not gonna
[1:34:39] we're not going to be like them
[1:34:41] that exercised authority in that measure
[1:34:43] you know like well we're just gonna have
[1:34:46] a little get-together and we're gonna
[1:34:48] have a thousand dollar plate if you want
[1:34:50] to come to this dinner we're going to
[1:34:51] promote this politician we're gonna do
[1:34:53] this thing we're not gonna you know look
[1:34:59] at this situation is just I'm going to
[1:35:00] throw a lot of money at this situation
[1:35:02] and because I threw this much money I'm
[1:35:05] kind of like they had honcho those are
[1:35:09] our benefactors and Jesus was telling he
[1:35:13] disciples that's how the gentiles
[1:35:15] exercise authority over one another
[1:35:17] and what we might call a good way in
[1:35:21] life human humanity
[1:35:23] he says but in our kingdom it's not
[1:35:26] going to be like that
[1:35:27] e you don't have to have money I love
[1:35:29] that song love that song the end sang
[1:35:33] didn't say nothing about her but I
[1:35:35] appreciate her bringing that song it's
[1:35:37] definitely the Lord felt the presence of
[1:35:40] the Lord
[1:35:41] but whatever God gave you whatever you
[1:35:44] are you've got the ability to serve just
[1:35:48] as much as any other human being on the
[1:35:50] planet it's just a willingness to be
[1:35:53] great in God's kingdom lay down your
[1:35:56] life for all it's all about laying down
[1:35:59] your life to help someone praise God
[1:36:04] Jesus Christ is the Prince of Peace and
[1:36:09] he knows how to make peace the Bible
[1:36:13] says he is our peace and he has broken
[1:36:18] down the middle wall of perdition in
[1:36:20] other words he knows how to break down
[1:36:22] walls of debt divide people and he said
[1:36:27] peace I leave with you not as the world
[1:36:31] not as the world peace he gives us peace
[1:36:35] he leaves but not as the way the world
[1:36:38] has peace no it's different and now the
[1:36:43] bride of Jesus Christ possesses that
[1:36:46] same peace their peacemakers they know
[1:36:50] how to make peace when peace doesn't
[1:36:52] exist and Jesus said in the Beatitudes
[1:36:58] Matthew 5 verse 9 blessed are the
[1:37:02] peacemakers for they shall be called the
[1:37:06] children of God amen so sorry chapter 5
[1:37:10] verse number 9 blessed are the
[1:37:13] peacemakers for they shall be called the
[1:37:14] children of God
[1:37:15] Ramachari god no matter no matter what
[1:37:17] I'm a child of God I'll fight to the
[1:37:19] veteran you know there's been many wars
[1:37:20] fought over religion
[1:37:22] anything else so many people have died
[1:37:24] over religion about believing in
[1:37:26] something and will fight to the better
[1:37:29] end with somebody proving that we're a
[1:37:31] child of God but God will identify you
[1:37:35] as a child of God when you're a
[1:37:37] peacemaker it's by all men shall know
[1:37:42] you're my disciple when you have a love
[1:37:44] that's one for another it's not us
[1:37:47] testifying who we are it's God inside of
[1:37:50] us justifying who we are that's why I
[1:37:52] said search the Scriptures you'll know
[1:37:54] it's why we come to church to find out
[1:37:55] we're not because we just listen to the
[1:37:57] devil all through the course of the day
[1:37:59] we think or something lord help me most
[1:38:03] people don't know how to bring peace
[1:38:05] into a situation of termina I'm just
[1:38:08] speaking the truth right now they have
[1:38:12] human peace and they have human love but
[1:38:17] we know it's not enough they end up
[1:38:19] getting upset and angry they fail in
[1:38:23] attempting to bring real peace I want to
[1:38:32] say number one piece is generated from a
[1:38:36] heart of peace we must possess peace in
[1:38:42] order to be able to make it to be a
[1:38:45] peacemaker to generate it you've got to
[1:38:47] have something to start with and nothing
[1:38:50] less than peace of God will do it
[1:38:52] peace is simply a fruit of the Spirit it
[1:38:57] is a fruit of God it is you cannot
[1:39:02] separate peace from God it's a part of
[1:39:06] him now what is peace for is peace just
[1:39:10] for you or is it for your family well
[1:39:15] then you need to know how to make peace
[1:39:16] in your family it's peace just for your
[1:39:20] family or for your neighbors what you
[1:39:21] need to know how to make peace among
[1:39:22] your neighbors is peace just for you and
[1:39:25] your neighbors or is it for those you're
[1:39:28] trying to bring to Christ
[1:39:34] the ability to be a peacemaker second
[1:39:38] making peace is completely and entirely
[1:39:43] sacrificial if you want to be a
[1:39:46] peacemaker you've got to be completely
[1:39:49] and entirely sacrificial it's all about
[1:39:52] laying down your life if you have failed
[1:39:54] time and time over and over in your life
[1:39:58] of trying to bring peace to a situation
[1:40:00] to a family member to something and
[1:40:02] things aren't working you need to look
[1:40:06] at it in a way of laying down your life
[1:40:08] it's sacrificial it's not about being
[1:40:11] right a person must sacrifice their
[1:40:18] know-it-all attitude there I know that
[1:40:21] I'm right there are self righteous
[1:40:24] indignation to straighten something up
[1:40:26] and be left with a spirit of I'm here to
[1:40:33] help you I want to lay down my life to
[1:40:34] help you a peacemaker has more to do
[1:40:39] with the right spirit than a right
[1:40:42] doctrine galatians chapter 6 verse 1
[1:40:46] tells us brethren if a man be overtaken
[1:40:48] in a fault nor will we we know that we
[1:40:51] see that everyday problems people with
[1:40:54] with problems and and and in certain
[1:40:57] certain people who have repetitious the
[1:41:01] same problem over and over and if a man
[1:41:03] be overtaken in a fault ye which are
[1:41:06] spiritual notice spiritual not he's
[1:41:09] right if you're spiritual you will be
[1:41:13] right ye which are spiritual restore
[1:41:16] such a one in a spirit oh my my a spirit
[1:41:24] of meekness not about how wrong the
[1:41:28] other person is I hope you're listening
[1:41:32] I hope you're just not saying Amen I
[1:41:35] agree but I hope you take this word and
[1:41:39] you begin to apply it to your life
[1:41:42] if you want to be a peacemaker you're
[1:41:45] gonna have to learn to do this a spirit
[1:41:49] of meekness considering thyself the same
[1:41:53] thing can happen to you and I'll tell
[1:41:56] you if you just think about it the
[1:41:57] things that you've judged other people
[1:41:59] have probably already come upon you
[1:42:01] since then first to bear ye one
[1:42:07] another's burden and so fulfill the law
[1:42:10] crisis if you want to to be a peacemaker
[1:42:14] bear your brothers burden amen
[1:42:18] true peace is generated from a heart of
[1:42:21] peace and true love true peace comes
[1:42:26] from true love a a natural humanistic
[1:42:33] peace a worldly peace like there'll be
[1:42:36] peace between us as long as you do what
[1:42:37] I tell you to do is generated from a
[1:42:41] heart of human love and it has its
[1:42:45] limits Amen whirly peace is generated
[1:42:49] from a heart of worldly love which we
[1:42:51] know has this limits it it can't suffer
[1:42:54] very long it vaunteth itself it's all
[1:42:57] puffed up it doesn't bear hardly
[1:43:01] anything it doesn't endure hardly
[1:43:04] anything it's before long it'll blow up
[1:43:10] its top and you'll see really what's
[1:43:12] behind it just a selfish self-righteous
[1:43:16] mold of that thinks it's right even the
[1:43:19] Bible talks about they that correct
[1:43:21] their children fathers Paul was talking
[1:43:24] about in Hebrews in chapter 12 that
[1:43:26] their fathers would correct their
[1:43:28] children for a season out of their own
[1:43:31] pleasure just to get pleasure on it
[1:43:33] notice they're so mad and what their
[1:43:35] kids did to them that they're gonna
[1:43:37] punish them they're gonna prove to them
[1:43:41] but when God does it it's wrong good
[1:43:45] yeah amen and I'll tell you if you want
[1:43:48] to you want to be like your your groom
[1:43:51] you want to be like your heavenly father

[1:44:19] an I don't care attitude
[1:44:21] amen she spends more time to let that
[1:44:24] seed of God your brother Graham says we

[1:44:28] and write out and let the seed life of
[1:44:31] God come forth

[1:44:35] gotta just get away with this this

[1:44:41] of a Christian and be a Christian from
[1:44:43] the inside yeah be a real bride of Jesus

[1:45:08] seeds have to come forth Romans chapter
[1:45:11] 8 verse 35 who can separate us from the
[1:45:14] love of Christ all right who's gonna
[1:45:17] separate us
[1:45:18] you put Christ in the middle of your
[1:45:21] relationship
[1:45:23] nothing's gonna separate it you put
[1:45:30] Christ in the middle of your problem

[1:45:35] nothing's gonna separate you from Christ
[1:45:38] shall tribulation show distress shall
[1:45:42] persecution famine nakedness peril or
[1:45:45] this watching my son died at Calvary be
[1:45:51] mocked at not many people looked at what
[1:45:53] Mary had to go through in this light as
[1:45:56] is written for thy sake we are killed
[1:45:58] all the day long we are accounted as
[1:46:00] sheep for the slaughter yeah that's
[1:46:01] gonna happen that's the life that we go
[1:46:03] through on a daily basis but nay and all
[1:46:06] these things were not moved we're more
[1:46:09] than conquerors
[1:46:10] pursue him that loved us for I am
[1:46:13] persuaded that neither death hallelujah
[1:46:16] death nor life nor Angels nor
[1:46:19] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:46:20] present nor things to come nor height
[1:46:23] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[1:46:25] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:46:28] God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord
[1:46:30] nothing nothing shall separate us we
[1:46:34] need to have that spirit I'll tell you
[1:46:36] the beautiful thing I loved about Jesus
[1:46:38] he must needs go by Samaria there was a
[1:46:41] woman that was just so caught up in the
[1:46:43] things of the world but you know that's
[1:46:45] there was a seed in there and then there
[1:46:47] was a seed of God in there that had to
[1:46:49] come far and if he didn't go there and
[1:46:52] and and and and bring the life of the
[1:46:54] gospel the Holy Spirit over that seed it
[1:46:57] would never come far just like the woman
[1:46:59] taught the dog free just like the people
[1:47:01] you talk to every day there's people out
[1:47:03] there that need Jesus Christ you can't
[1:47:06] let some sort of things separate you
[1:47:08] from having a relationship they'll bring
[1:47:10] them to Jesus Christ and bring them to
[1:47:12] the new birth you're ambassadors for
[1:47:14] Jesus Christ
[1:47:15] it's a purpose in all this I'll tell you
[1:47:19] when the doubts are flying the battles
[1:47:20] are raging and peace and love seem to be
[1:47:26] just an illusion and imagination so far
[1:47:29] away go back to the beginning or God
[1:47:33] first spoke to you spoke to your heart
[1:47:37] called you to bring forth his son inside
