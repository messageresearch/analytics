[29:36] I pray that you're glad and you're
[29:39] living on the Hallelujah side.
[29:42] Once a sinner or far from Jesus, I was
[29:45] perishing with the cold. But the blessed
[29:49] Savior heard me when I cried.
[29:53] Then he threw his robe around me and he
[29:57] led me to his fault. And I'm living on
[30:00] the hallelujah side.
[30:04] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[30:08] hallelujah roll. Help me sing the Savior
[30:12] praises far and wide.
[30:15] Oh, I open up towards heaven all the
[30:19] windows of my soul. And I'm living on
[30:22] the hallelujah side.
[30:26] Though the world may sweep around me
[30:28] with her dazzle and her dream, yet I
[30:32] envy not her vanities and pride.
[30:37] For my soul looks up to heaven where the
[30:40] golden sunlight gleams. And I'm living
[30:43] on the hallelujah side.
[30:47] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[30:51] hallelujah roll. Help me sing the Savior
[30:54] praises far and wide.
[30:58] For I open up towards heaven all the
[31:01] windows of my soul. And I'm living on
[31:05] the hallelujah side.
[31:08] Not for all will the millions would I
[31:12] leave this precious place though the
[31:14] tempter to persuade me often try
[31:19] for I'm safe in God's pavilion happy in
[31:23] his love and grace and I'm living on the
[31:26] hallelujah side.
[31:30] Oh glory be to Jesus. Let the hallelujah
[31:34] roll. Help me sing the Savior praises
[31:37] far and wide.
[31:40] For I open up towards heaven all the
[31:43] windows of my soul. And I'm living on
[31:47] the hallelujah side.
[31:50] Here the sun is always shining. Here the
[31:54] sky is always right. There's no place
[31:57] for gloomy Christians to abide.
[32:01] For my soul is filled with music and my
[32:04] heart is full of delight and I'm living
[32:08] on a hallelujah side.
[32:12] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[32:15] hallelujah roll. Help me sing this
[32:18] praises far and wide.
[32:22] Oh, I open up towards heaven all the
[32:25] windows of my soul. And I'm living on
[32:29] the hallelujah side.
[32:32] And upon the streets of glory when I
[32:36] reach the other shore, we safely cross
[32:39] the Jordan's rolling tide.
[32:43] You will find me shouting glory just
[32:46] outside the mansion door. And I'm living
[32:49] on the hallelujah side.
[32:53] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[32:57] hallelujah roll. Help me sing the Savior
[33:00] praises far and wide.
[33:04] For I open up towards heaven all the
[33:07] windows of my soul. And I'm living on
[33:10] the hallelujah side.
[33:14] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[33:18] hallelujah roll. Help me sing the Savior
[33:21] praises far and wide.
[33:25] Oh, I opened up towards heaven, all the
[33:28] windows of my soul, and I'm living on
[33:31] the hallelujah side.
[33:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[33:38] Hallelujah.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Good to give God praise.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:51] Turn with me if you would this morning
[33:53] to the book of St. John chapter 3. Um,
[33:57] this is probably the most read
[34:01] chapter in the Bible
[34:05] when you consider all the churches, the
[34:08] denominational churches.
[34:14] And in this chapter, we have the
[34:18] for God so loved the world verse.
[34:21] And then we also have
[34:24] uh the verse that talks about we must be
[34:27] born again.
[34:30] And
[34:33] um for the the the bride, it may seem
[34:38] like a very
[34:41] shallow subject.
[34:44] um the new birth, but it's really uh the
[34:49] pinnacle of becoming the word.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; And um I think there's a lot of people
[34:57] who are not born again.
[35:01] And uh I think it's an important subject
[35:05] and it's like the pro brother Ron made
[35:07] mention uh that if you got the Holy
[35:11] Ghost, you can't wait till the doors are
[35:12] open.
[35:14] Brother Ram says you cannot sit home.
[35:16] You have to be in church. And I think
[35:19] there's just people who have their own
[35:21] version of what being born again is.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Uh but
[35:27] um may may God just take this service
[35:29] and help us to dig in a little deeper.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our our hearts in a word
[35:35] of prayer and then we'll read God's word
[35:38] today. Our heavenly father,
[35:40] Lord, we thank you that you've given us
[35:42] this day of life
[35:45] and that you've put a desire in our
[35:46] heart to be here, knowing that there are
[35:49] others that that desire is missing.
[35:54] Lord, we thank you for the desire to
[35:57] serve you and to grow and to to feed
[36:00] upon the word and to be with our
[36:03] precious brothers and sisters of like
[36:05] precious faith
[36:07] to know that we'll be spending eternity
[36:09] with them.
[36:11] Lord, we thank you that you've given us
[36:13] health. Thank you that you've given us
[36:15] your spirit. And Lord, we just thank you
[36:18] for a sound mind.
[36:21] Lord, where would we be without you in
[36:24] our lives today? We just worship you. We
[36:26] praise you, Lord. We look to you now
[36:28] that you would anoint your word to our
[36:31] hearts. We know thy word is anointed,
[36:33] but Lord, may our hearts be quickened
[36:38] that we might be re receive the
[36:40] engrafted word today, Lord. that we
[36:43] might understand the fullness of what it
[36:44] means to be born again and that we would
[36:47] be um not just challenged, Lord, but
[36:50] that all of us would be admonished,
[36:53] encouraged to press in to become more in
[36:57] your image. We pray, Father, we commit
[36:59] the service in your hands. We pray that
[37:01] you'd be with those that are sick and
[37:03] afflicted, those that are live
[37:04] streaming, those that are backsliding.
[37:06] Lord, those that are in a terrible
[37:08] condition, we just ask that you send
[37:11] your spirit after them and bring them
[37:13] back to their rightful position, their
[37:14] post of duty. Lord, that they may serve
[37:16] you with all their heart. God, we'll be
[37:19] ever grateful for these things. We pray
[37:20] now in Jesus Christ's name.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. St. John chapter 3, we're going to
[37:26] start with verse number one. There was a
[37:28] man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus,
[37:31] a ruler of the Jews. The same came to
[37:34] Jesus by night and said unto him,
[37:37] "Rabbi, we know that thou are a teacher
[37:40] come from God, for no man can do the
[37:42] miracles that thou doest except God be
[37:44] with him." Jesus answered and said unto
[37:47] him, "Verily, I say unto thee, except a
[37:50] man be born again, he cannot see the
[37:54] kingdom of God." Nicodemus saith unto
[37:57] him, how can a man be born when he is
[37:59] old, can he enter the second time into
[38:01] his mother's womb and be born? And Jesus
[38:04] answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[38:06] thee, except a man be born of water and
[38:09] of the spirit, he cannot enter into the
[38:12] kingdom of God. That which is born of
[38:15] flesh is flesh, and that which is born
[38:17] of spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I
[38:20] said unto thee, you must be born again.
[38:23] The wind bloweth where it listeth, and
[38:26] thou hearest the sound thereof, and
[38:28] cannot tell whether whether it cometh,
[38:30] and whether it goeth." So is everyone
[38:34] that is born of the spirit. Nicodemus
[38:37] answered and said unto him, How can
[38:39] these things be? Jesus said unto unto
[38:42] him, Art thou a master of Israel and
[38:45] knoweth not these things? Verily I say
[38:47] unto thee, we speak that which we do
[38:50] know, and testify of that which we have
[38:52] seen, and ye receive, you receive not
[38:54] our witness. If I have told you earthly
[38:57] things, and you believe not, how shall
[38:59] you believe if I tell you heavenly
[39:01] things? And no man have ascended up to
[39:04] heaven, but he that cometh down from
[39:06] heaven, and the Son of man which is in
[39:08] heaven. A and as Moses lifted up the
[39:13] serpent in the wilderness, even so must
[39:15] the Son of Man be lifted up, that
[39:18] whosoever believeth in him should not
[39:19] perish, but have eternal life.
[39:23] And for God so loved the world that he
[39:25] gave his only begotten son that
[39:27] whosoever believeth in him should not
[39:30] perish but have everlasting life. Amen.
[39:33] God bless you. You may be seated.
[39:41] It's I don't think it's by mistake that
[39:44] Jesus is starting out here telling
[39:46] Nicodemus that you need to be born
[39:47] again. And he's asking how is this going
[39:50] to happen?
[39:52] And then Jesus
[39:55] gives this great verse that God so loved
[39:58] you, Nicodemus,
[40:00] that he's given me as a sacrifice at
[40:03] Calvary that you could have eternal
[40:06] life. Calvary made it possible for us to
[40:10] be born again. Without Calvary, there
[40:13] would be no new birth. There would be no
[40:14] new nature change.
[40:18] The new birth is essential to
[40:20] understanding what the kingdom of God
[40:22] actually is. Everybody's got their own
[40:25] opinion what the new birth is.
[40:27] Everybody's got their own opinion what
[40:28] the kingdom of God is. But it's
[40:30] essential to getting into the kingdom of
[40:34] God. Jesus said that in in order to get
[40:37] into the kingdom of God, in order to
[40:39] understand the kingdom of God, you must
[40:41] be born again. So you don't got any
[40:44] intelligence to figure out. No man
[40:45] knoweth the things of God, save the
[40:47] spirit of God. And and he he's hid it
[40:50] from the wise and prudent, and he's
[40:52] revealed it to to babes.
[40:56] Now, we know that there's an actual
[40:58] place called heaven.
[41:01] And we can never expect to go there
[41:03] until we have received the kingdom of
[41:05] God into our heart.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; So, first thing is first, we've got to
[41:10] receive the kingdom of God into our
[41:12] hearts. Except a man be born again, he
[41:15] cannot see the kingdom of God.
[41:18] So Calvary didn't just pay the price for
[41:21] our sins to be washed away,
[41:25] but it made it possible for the Holy
[41:27] Ghost to come in so that we would not
[41:29] keep sinning.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Now, we're we're going to fall every
[41:33] day. We're going to backslide every day.
[41:35] But there's a purpose for the Holy
[41:36] Ghost. It it's to take our lives from an
[41:39] old nature to a new nature.
[41:42] And the new birth is the changing of our
[41:47] nature into the very nature of God. Now
[41:49] that's what the new birth is. It's the
[41:51] actual changing
[41:53] of our old nature into the nature of
[41:56] God.
[41:58] One dies out and the other comes.
[42:01] That is the process of the new birth.
[42:05] And a lot of people will say, "Well,
[42:07] this happened to me. I'm born again."
[42:10] Well,
[42:12] literally God's blessings can fall on
[42:14] the unjust
[42:16] &gt;&gt; and they change for a period of time
[42:19] &gt;&gt; and they revert back to what they were.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; So, their nature really never change.
[42:24] But God has the ability to make you feel
[42:27] good.
[42:29] He has the ability to get you excited,
[42:31] to get you emotional, to get your
[42:33] feelings uh going in a a direction that
[42:36] you you feel like trying. It's like
[42:39] this. You know, Brother Bram's talking
[42:42] about if you have the Holy Ghost, you're
[42:43] going to be in church. That's just all
[42:45] there is to it. Brother, brother says,
[42:48] quoting him, "You can't wait to get
[42:49] there." Now, at a worst case scenario,
[42:52] you're here in church
[42:55] without that booming desire to be here.
[42:57] That's worst case scenario. We all, you
[42:58] know, go through the times where we just
[43:00] don't feel like it. But yet, but we do
[43:03] it because we love God, right?
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Now, the best case scenario is we really
[43:08] can't wait to get there because we've
[43:09] been feeding on the word through the
[43:11] week
[43:11] &gt;&gt; and and we've been spending time in
[43:13] prayer through the week.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Stan, you look so good with that
[43:17] tie.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; You look good.
[43:24] The receiving of the new birth and the
[43:26] working of the new birth happens in
[43:29] secret.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:20 says, "And when he was
[43:35] demanded of the Pharisees when the
[43:37] kingdom of God should come, he answered
[43:39] them and said, the kingdom of God cometh
[43:41] not with observation." It's nothing we
[43:44] see, you know, on the outside.
[43:47] Neither shall they say, "Lo here, or lo
[43:50] there. Behold, the kingdom of God is
[43:52] within you.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; So, it's a secret thing. It's invisible.
[43:56] The new birth takes place on the inside.
[44:01] It, if I could just say it like this,
[44:02] how many used to smoke and don't smoke
[44:04] anymore?
[44:06] Okay, that is a nature change.
[44:11] That is not like, okay, who used to
[44:13] drive a Ford, but they drive a Chevy
[44:15] now?
[44:17] It's not a a change in what you're
[44:20] smoking. It's you're not driving
[44:23] anymore.
[44:25] You understand what I'm saying? It's a
[44:26] change nature
[44:28] and it happens on the inside.
[44:33] It's invisible, but it will eventually
[44:38] manifest visibly for others to see
[44:41] &gt;&gt; because everybody sees. Those of you
[44:42] that don't smoke anymore, everybody sees
[44:45] you don't smoke anymore. So, it visibly
[44:47] comes out.
[44:49] It's Jesus on the inside working on the
[44:52] outside, as the song goes. Oh, what a
[44:54] change in my heart. Philippians 2:12
[44:57] says, "Work out your own salvation with
[45:00] fear and trembling." I'll say, if there
[45:02] was a lot more of that, there would be a
[45:04] lot more working out the salvation.
[45:06] Amen.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; But without the fear and trembling kind
[45:08] of people put things on the back burn
[45:09] and all that's not necessary but the
[45:12] Bible says for it is God which workketh
[45:14] in you both to will and to do of his
[45:17] good pleasure right his nature.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; And so do all things without murmurings
[45:23] and disputings.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to know the Bible does
[45:28] say all
[45:31] right.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[45:35] all things without murmuring and
[45:37] disputings. Jesus speaking, marvel not
[45:39] that I said unto thee, you must be born
[45:41] again. The wind bloweth where it
[45:42] listeth, and thou hearest not the sound
[45:46] thereof, but cannot tell where it came
[45:48] or where it's going. And he he types
[45:51] this to everyone that's born again.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; So it is with everybody that's born
[45:56] again. You you don't know where it came
[45:58] and you don't know where it's going.
[46:01] So don't try to figure out the new
[46:03] birth.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; It is a work that only is orchestrated
[46:09] by God. Just like the wind that blows.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; You don't know where it came. You don't
[46:14] know where it's going. You don't know.
[46:15] God is orchestrating that.
[46:18] You just can't figure it out.
[46:20] Now weather people can figure out
[46:22] certain things, but they can't figure
[46:23] out everything. We've heard that they
[46:26] have the only job that can be wrong and
[46:28] still get paid. They're still considered
[46:30] they're doing a good job.
[46:35] And Jesus said when he's talking to the
[46:37] Pharisees, he's trying to tell them. He
[46:39] says, "The Pharisees also and the
[46:40] Sadducees came and tempting, desiring
[46:44] him that they would show him a sign from
[46:45] heaven." He answered, "When it is
[46:47] evening, you say it is fair weather, for
[46:51] the sky is red, and in the morning it
[46:54] will be foul weather today, for the sky
[46:56] is red and lowering." Oh, you
[46:57] hypocrites. You can discern the face of
[46:59] the skies, but you cannot discern the
[47:00] signs of the time.
[47:03] So, there are certain things that you
[47:04] literally can figure out about weather.
[47:06] We all got the weather app on our phone
[47:10] and we know that when we look at that
[47:12] weather app app
[47:15] map
[47:17] that you know it's not going to be
[47:19] absolutely 100% positive
[47:21] &gt;&gt; because we've seen it too many times
[47:24] where it said it's going to be sunny and
[47:27] it's raining on you at the time you're
[47:29] looking at it and vice versa.
[47:33] So it's not perfect
[47:36] and there are certain things that we can
[47:38] kind of figure out,
[47:40] we can feel, we can see.
[47:44] But understand God's working of the new
[47:46] birth inside of you is not something for
[47:49] you to figure out.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; But God is what he's wanting you to do
[47:55] is believe the word that's being
[47:57] ministered to you
[47:59] &gt;&gt; because that is what brings the new
[48:02] birth.
[48:04] It's taking the word of God that you
[48:06] hear with these ears. You believe it
[48:08] into your heart. I say it like this. It
[48:11] has to come inside your soul and you
[48:14] start manifesting what you hear. You, In
[48:17] other words, it's like, if I could say
[48:19] it like this, there's a reason these
[48:21] stories are in the Bible where God told
[48:24] Joshua and Moses, "Put your foot in the
[48:26] water. Just start moving forward." And
[48:29] when when they did, the waters parted,
[48:34] &gt;&gt; right? So you hear the word of God, you
[48:36] say, "Yes, I'm going to start doing this
[48:38] right in the middle of your messy,
[48:40] watery life."
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, things just start
[48:43] to depart to the side and your nature
[48:46] begins to change.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; But you have to move forward with you
[48:50] can't just say, "I I've heard that
[48:51] scripture before. I've heard three John
[48:53] 3:16. I've heard you must be born
[48:55] again."
[48:56] No, you must apply the word of God
[49:00] because that's what brings the new
[49:01] birth.
[49:03] Apply the living word of God. The new
[49:06] birth is not a partial nature change.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; We're not living in Luther's church age.
[49:15] We're not living in Wesley's.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; We're not even living in the Pentecostal
[49:18] age.
[49:20] The new birth is not just justification.
[49:24] We have to move on. We have to grow up.
[49:26] We have to come to the the statue of a
[49:28] mature Christian. We need to be mature
[49:30] Christians.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; So, how do I know I'm a mature
[49:34] Christian?
[49:36] I act mature in the middle of a trial.
[49:43] I mean, Jesus when it when it come time,
[49:47] okay,
[49:48] when it came time to Calvary, Jesus
[49:51] said, "Not my will, thy will be done.
[49:57] when they were when they were told,
[50:01] "Don't you preach about the gospel
[50:02] anymore," they said, "we we're not
[50:06] afraid of man. We're not ashamed of
[50:07] man." And and they went forward because
[50:11] they were mature in the middle of their
[50:12] trial. And and they were thrown in
[50:15] prison and they were whipped and they
[50:16] came out. They were rejoicing because
[50:19] they were literally persecuted for not
[50:21] for not doing anything wrong.
[50:25] If you're a godly Christian, you're
[50:27] going to suffer persecution. People are
[50:29] going to talk about you. People are
[50:30] going to talk behind your back. They're
[50:32] going to they're going to do all sorts
[50:33] of things because that's just what the
[50:36] word says.
[50:38] Doesn't mean you did wrong.
[50:42] It just means a a a a a true Christian
[50:46] is going to be tried.
[50:50] But we have to grow up. Brother Ram said
[50:51] in the message, "You must be born
[50:53] again." He says, "Listen, are you
[50:54] listening?" Say, "Amen."
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "Congregation says, "Amen." He
[50:59] says, "What may grow up unto him?" What?
[51:03] Tomorrow, no. Grow up to him. Grow up.
[51:07] Grow up unto him which is the head, even
[51:10] Christ. Growing up into him. Oh, there's
[51:13] I remember, brother. This is brother. I
[51:15] really want to read this. He says, "I
[51:17] remember the first sermon I preached. I
[51:19] got up there and I thought I did really
[51:22] well.
[51:23] And all the old ladies sat around and
[51:26] they just cried a little bit, you know,
[51:27] and said, "Oh, what a wonderful boy."
[51:31] The old pastor Davis, Dr. Davis, was an
[51:35] old lawyer.
[51:36] And I went down and and he said, "I want
[51:39] to see you down at the house." And I
[51:42] said, "All right." I walked in the next
[51:44] day and, you know, all swelled up. And I
[51:47] said, "How do I do, Dr. Davis.
[51:50] He said, "The rottness I ever heard."
[51:56] I said, "What?"
[51:58] Or, "Brother Ram said, what?" He said,
[52:00] "Yes, the worst I've ever heard." I
[52:02] said, "Oh." I said, "Brother Davis,
[52:04] everybody was crying."
[52:08] And he said, "Yes, they cry at funerals.
[52:10] They cry at births and everything else."
[52:12] He said, "What it is, Billy? You never
[52:15] quoted one bit of God's word.
[52:19] You talked about some mother that had
[52:21] done gone on or something like this and
[52:24] everybody got to crying and you're not
[52:26] born. He says you're not born upon
[52:29] things and sensations of this earth.
[52:33] You're born by the word.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, he cut the wind right out of me. He
[52:41] says, I'm glad he did. See,
[52:44] not jumping up and down and hollering.
[52:46] That isn't it. It's the word that makes
[52:49] alive. The word quicken, not
[52:52] experiences. The word experiences come
[52:55] and go. We can all say some great
[52:58] experience that we had in the past
[53:00] that's really not even affecting our
[53:01] life today.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; But when the word changes you, you're
[53:06] changed.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; So, we're living not in another age.
[53:12] We're living in what brother Brandham
[53:14] called the eagle age. It's the capstone
[53:17] age. The bride in this age is more
[53:20] advanced than any other age.
[53:23] In other words, the new birth in this
[53:25] age requires more than any other group,
[53:30] any other age.
[53:32] This is why it's important for us to
[53:34] really just, you know, get get serious.
[53:36] I got a lot of quotes. I hope it's okay
[53:37] if I do some quoting this morning.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother said in the message, the
[53:42] countdown, he says, "But we're so
[53:44] advanced, the spirit of God into other
[53:46] things that we've got now, they have
[53:48] never had back there." They had just
[53:51] left the automobile. They uh got their
[53:54] feet off into the air. So, they went a
[53:57] few spiritual gifts, speaking in tongues
[53:59] and shouting, singing spiritual songs.
[54:02] Why? They was floating up around there
[54:05] like butterflies. See, that was a great
[54:08] age. But oh brother, we are lifted far
[54:11] above that now. The church is way beyond
[54:15] that. The spiritual church, it's the ego
[54:19] age now. The astronaut flying above and
[54:22] looking down at the fellow citizen
[54:24] chicken. We're far above that. Way up
[54:27] yonder in the heavenlies where Christ
[54:31] becomes the full thing. I like that.
[54:33] where Christ becomes the full thing that
[54:35] takes completely over and lives his life
[54:41] and acts through you exactly like he did
[54:45] here on earth.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham is telling us this
[54:49] is the only age where we completely
[54:52] become Christ.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; That is enough there to make me say,
[54:57] God, I need more of you.
[54:59] I could stop right there and say, you
[55:01] know what we need to do is just seek
[55:02] more of God, seek more of the Holy
[55:04] Ghost. Let the Holy Ghost come in
[55:07] because unless he completely takes over,
[55:10] how will we have what we need to go into
[55:12] rapture? We're not living in Luther's
[55:13] age. It's not just about believing like
[55:15] the other churches.
[55:17] It's not just having your your life
[55:19] cleaned up a little bit. It's it's that
[55:20] it's not that. Brother Brandon speaks of
[55:23] this evil uh eagle age in the four,
[55:25] fifth, and sixth seal. And I just want
[55:27] to read some quotes. He says, 'Now
[55:29] watch, I want to read this close so that
[55:31] I be sure. Wrote down some of the place
[55:34] stand here under not under the
[55:36] revelation of the lion's age or the
[55:39] first age, the early age that wasn't
[55:42] revealed. The next age was the ox age,
[55:45] that was the dark ages, the middle ages,
[55:47] it wasn't revealed. It um it wasn't
[55:51] revealed as it is as it was. nor the man
[55:55] like beast of wisdom representing the
[55:57] reformers Luther Wesley and so forth it
[56:00] wasn't revealed but in the eagle age the
[56:03] last age the prophetic age where there
[56:06] is to rise a prophetic entrance uh a a
[56:10] prophetic untrant utterance I knew it
[56:14] would come see to whom the secrets
[56:17] always come saying I will do nothing
[56:19] except to reveal my secrets to the
[56:20] prophets he's quoting there but You let
[56:25] a crow try to fly with an eagle or a
[56:28] hawk, either one, he will disintegrate,
[56:32] he's got to be pressurized for what he
[56:35] goes through. And that's the trouble
[56:36] today. Some of us don't get pressurized.
[56:40] In other words, we don't get the Holy
[56:41] Ghost. That's what he's saying. We
[56:43] explode too quick. You see, we're just
[56:46] jumping and we got to be pressurized.
[56:49] When you get up there and have that keen
[56:52] sight of an ego to see what's coming and
[56:55] know what to do, know what to do. That's
[56:57] what the Holy Ghost gives you. It it it
[57:00] it tells you what to do. Now, the eagle
[57:02] age revealed it. Now, we find that the
[57:05] eagle age was promised in Revelations
[57:08] 10:7 and Malachi 1:4,
[57:12] Malachi 4, uh 1-4.
[57:17] That would be no four, five, and six.
[57:20] I'm sorry. Four, five, and six. He just
[57:22] said 1 four. And I know that, but I'm
[57:24] going to say four, five, and six. That
[57:26] would be in the last days. See, that's
[57:29] where we're at here. So, he's trying to
[57:31] tell us that the ministry that came
[57:33] through the prophet is what really gets
[57:35] us into the rapture. It shoots us up
[57:37] into a rapture, right? That's why he
[57:39] talks it types it as an astronaut
[57:41] shooting up. And then the fifth seal,
[57:44] brother says, "And then at the last
[57:45] power, he brings down the eagle to
[57:47] restore the children back to the
[57:49] original faith of their fathers."
[57:52] So the goal is to get us back to where
[57:54] we were, the eagle age. Then you notice
[57:57] there is no beast. There's no more
[57:59] beasts. That's all there is. That's the
[58:01] end. Now, if you would take now
[58:03] Revelations 10 1-7, I'm referring to it.
[58:06] Remember in the last the last messengers
[58:09] age, see what was to happen? All the
[58:12] mysteries of God were to be finished.
[58:14] That's the eagle.
[58:17] And in the Bible, the last age was the
[58:20] eagle age. And God likes and eagles are
[58:23] prophets. Now watch the last age. The
[58:27] age a revealer of the true word. A
[58:31] revealer of the true word. It's more the
[58:34] the message of the prophet is more
[58:35] important than any other
[58:38] preaching of the word. Can you say amen?
[58:42] And then the last one, the sixth seal.
[58:44] It is the age, it is the eagle age that
[58:47] gets the word and the revelation. It is
[58:50] the eagle age that gets the word and the
[58:52] revelation. All that understand that,
[58:55] raise up your hands.
[58:58] That's good. That's fine. That's good.
[59:00] The reformers could not understand this
[59:03] word.
[59:07] Now, here we are in lukewarm leodysia.
[59:12] where everybody is just lukewarm.
[59:17] And we're also told in this last age,
[59:21] there's a falling away, a drifting back,
[59:24] a an apostasy,
[59:27] a a lovers of pleasure more than lovers
[59:29] of God. A a a going backwards. And in
[59:34] this lukewarm age,
[59:36] God calls a bride an eagle age.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; So, so you see you both things could be
[59:45] happening.
[59:47] The the the the mate believer, the
[59:50] unbeliever are sliding backwards,
[59:52] &gt;&gt; but the true believer catches the
[59:55] revelation of the message of the hour
[59:59] &gt;&gt; and she is being dressed with the word
[1:00:02] and getting ready. She's making herself
[1:00:04] ready for the rapture.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; So the new birth is not a partial
[1:00:10] change. I want to bring this point
[1:00:12] across. Do not settle for where you're
[1:00:15] at.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; As that's why the prophet said, "Pinch
[1:00:18] your conscience. Get driving to get more
[1:00:21] of God in your life."
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Do not wait till things subside and
[1:00:25] everything's fine in your life and you
[1:00:26] got lots of money. And I tell you, I got
[1:00:28] less money than I've ever had before.
[1:00:31] [Laughter]
[1:00:33] Me too. The secret comes out. Okay.
[1:00:37] But you know what? We want more of God.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; And we can't wait till things are
[1:00:44] convenient.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; We got to we got to just sacrifice.
[1:00:48] We don't want to stop after baptism.
[1:00:51] We don't want to stop after we our lives
[1:00:54] get cleaned up a little bit. Well, I
[1:00:56] used to do this. I'm not doing it now,
[1:00:58] so I must be okay. That's a terrible
[1:01:00] mentality. We've got to keep moving. We
[1:01:03] got to keep growing. We got to be keep
[1:01:04] becoming. We got to hold our beetting
[1:01:06] confidence steadfast to the end until we
[1:01:09] see Job said, "I will not be satisfied
[1:01:11] till I awaken his likeness." And we need
[1:01:13] that same attitude. Paul said, "I press
[1:01:16] towards the mark." So the new birth is
[1:01:20] not a partial nature change. So when
[1:01:23] you're when you think about your own
[1:01:24] life and you're thinking about, am I
[1:01:26] born again? Of course I'm born again.
[1:01:27] I'm not going to deny I'm born again
[1:01:29] because don't do that. I want you to
[1:01:32] say, is your life is your is your nature
[1:01:35] completely changed.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; You know, be honest with yourself. Hold
[1:01:39] yourself to the higher standard. And the
[1:01:41] higher standard is the word of God.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:45] Jesus said in Matthew 13:33, it was a
[1:01:47] parable, but he said, "The kingdom of
[1:01:50] heaven is like
[1:01:53] is like unto Levven, which a woman took
[1:01:58] and hid in three measures of meal,
[1:02:04] till
[1:02:06] the whole
[1:02:08] was leaven."
[1:02:11] And brother Brandham taught us that
[1:02:13] justification was part of the new birth
[1:02:16] and sanctification was and the the the
[1:02:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost is part of the
[1:02:23] the new birth. But we need the whole
[1:02:25] thing. And the whole thing gives us a
[1:02:28] nature a complete nature change.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean you're not going to
[1:02:33] make mistakes and things like that.
[1:02:35] That's not what I'm saying. But what I'm
[1:02:38] saying is that we we we ought to be keep
[1:02:41] pressing on. Think about this. We know
[1:02:44] God wants us to press on, right?
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; We we know that. We know that's God's
[1:02:49] nature. And if we say we have God's
[1:02:51] nature inside, that means God inside of
[1:02:54] us is saying press on.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; You follow what I'm saying? So the very
[1:02:59] fact that we're not feeling that press
[1:03:00] on like we should, you know, we might be
[1:03:03] coasting back into lukewarm leodysia,
[1:03:06] which is a very scary thing.
[1:03:09] So we've got to become the word of God
[1:03:12] manifested in this hour. Not just saying
[1:03:14] I'm in the message or I believe the
[1:03:17] prophet, but we must become what that
[1:03:20] what he brought us. There was a reason
[1:03:21] he brought it. He did not bring us the
[1:03:24] word so we could just identify, oh yeah,
[1:03:26] that's the truth.
[1:03:28] No, the truth sets you free. And so we
[1:03:32] must become the truth. We must become
[1:03:34] the truth.
[1:03:36] John said in 1 John 3:2, "Beloved, now
[1:03:40] are we the sons of God
[1:03:43] today." Can you say amen to that?
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; And it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:03:49] be,
[1:03:51] but we know, we got a revelation in this
[1:03:53] age. When he shall appear, we shall be
[1:03:57] like him, for we shall see him as he is.
[1:04:02] How many believes that to be the truth?
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, look at verse three. And
[1:04:09] every man that has this hope in him,
[1:04:13] what is he doing? He's purifying himself
[1:04:17] even as he is pure. In other words, he
[1:04:22] he's staying focused that he's going to
[1:04:24] be like Jesus.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have this mentality, well,
[1:04:29] I'm just going to go to church and learn
[1:04:30] about Jesus and, you know, I'm going to
[1:04:31] become somehow more like him.
[1:04:34] It's it's not it's not a carnal
[1:04:36] denominational view. The bride needs to
[1:04:39] become the word. And so, she is serious
[1:04:43] about becoming the word.
[1:04:46] And anytime that we're going to work on
[1:04:48] purifying ourselves,
[1:04:51] is that going to feel good?
[1:04:53] It's not going to feel good at all.
[1:04:56] It It hurts to become more like Jesus.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; It does. We all got a cross to bear.
[1:05:05] Romans 8:18, for I reckon, I say this in
[1:05:08] words of comfort to you today, for I
[1:05:12] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:05:14] present time, what we're going through,
[1:05:16] our suffering, are not worthy to be
[1:05:20] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:05:22] revealed in us.
[1:05:24] for the earnest expectation
[1:05:27] of the whole creation the is waiting for
[1:05:31] us to be manifested
[1:05:35] now the world ain't going to be
[1:05:37] manifested
[1:05:39] I mean into sons of God they're going to
[1:05:41] become more like the devil but they're
[1:05:42] not going to become manifest as sons of
[1:05:44] God
[1:05:46] but think that all God's creation is
[1:05:49] waiting for us
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; I mean they're there going, "John, when
[1:05:54] are you going to get it together?"
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; And and sometimes we're just, you know,
[1:06:01] trying to make it through the day
[1:06:04] that and our goal needs to be, I want to
[1:06:06] be more like Jesus. I want to be more
[1:06:08] like him.
[1:06:10] So, we need to go on to
[1:06:14] perfection.
[1:06:15] You know, Paul said to the Hebrews
[1:06:17] church, "Let us go on to perfection,"
[1:06:19] which means completion,
[1:06:21] complete nature change, not laying again
[1:06:24] the foundation of repentance and that
[1:06:27] not just kind of starting over and over,
[1:06:29] you know, backsliding, starting over,
[1:06:31] backsliding, starting over. Don't don't
[1:06:33] have that mentality, but go have the
[1:06:36] mentality of keep marching forward.
[1:06:38] There are better there are things uh
[1:06:40] better things that are persuaded of you
[1:06:41] and the things that accompany real
[1:06:43] salvation,
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; right? We're we're the eagle age. We're
[1:06:47] not we're not competing with the
[1:06:49] denominations.
[1:06:51] We're not we're not we're not here I'm a
[1:06:53] little bit better than the denomination.
[1:06:54] I'm a non-denominational church to
[1:06:56] believe I'm I'm better than they. No,
[1:06:59] we're we're we're competing against this
[1:07:02] nature here that don't want to die out
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; and become the word. And and so that
[1:07:07] that's why this this message is not real
[1:07:10] favorable for the flesh, right? It's
[1:07:13] it's it's it's
[1:07:16] for the bride. All right. Ephesians
[1:07:19] chapter Ephesians chapter 2. The new
[1:07:22] birth is changing our nature into the
[1:07:25] very nature of God. I just want to go
[1:07:28] through this. We all should be able to
[1:07:30] relate to this here. Ephesians 2,
[1:07:32] chapter 3. Just trying to describe the
[1:07:34] new birth a little bit to kind of let
[1:07:36] this sink in.
[1:07:38] Bible says in verse three, "Among whom
[1:07:40] also we all had our conversation in the
[1:07:43] times past and lust of the flesh,
[1:07:45] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:07:48] of the mind, and were by nature the
[1:07:50] children of wrath, even as others." So
[1:07:52] there was no comparison when we were in
[1:07:55] the world. You could not you cannot you
[1:07:58] could not tell a child of God
[1:08:02] um
[1:08:03] from a sinner.
[1:08:06] You know, and Jesus in the parable tells
[1:08:09] us about the the tears and the wheat
[1:08:12] they grow together. They look the same,
[1:08:14] right? It's when they grow up that they
[1:08:16] brother Brandham taught us it was like
[1:08:18] at the at the very end that that you you
[1:08:21] realize what the difference was at the
[1:08:24] very end. And this is the end age. This
[1:08:26] is where you can really tell, right, by
[1:08:28] their fruits, you'll know them.
[1:08:32] Just like when you see a baby and a Oh,
[1:08:34] that cute baby. I mean, Hitler was a
[1:08:36] cute baby at one time.
[1:08:38] I mean, he was I I would have I would
[1:08:40] have held him. He came to church. His
[1:08:43] mom would have asked me. I would have
[1:08:44] held him. I would have said, "You little
[1:08:47] cutie."
[1:08:49] Come on. You would have, too.
[1:08:53] but not after they grow up.
[1:08:56] You understand?
[1:08:59] And and it's the grown up time.
[1:09:03] But God who is rich in mercy for his
[1:09:08] great love were with he loved us.
[1:09:11] And when we were dead in sins, he did
[1:09:14] something to us.
[1:09:16] He quickened us
[1:09:20] together with Christ. and by grace
[1:09:21] you're saved and raised us up together
[1:09:23] and made us to sit together in heavenly
[1:09:25] places in Christ Jesus. So God the the
[1:09:28] new birth, he did something. It was all
[1:09:30] him. He came and he quickened our nature
[1:09:34] and he got our attention.
[1:09:37] Yeah, I'm a son of God. I know I'm a son
[1:09:39] of God. How do I know it? Because
[1:09:42] something in me identifies with it.
[1:09:44] Therefore, I'm going to repent. I'm
[1:09:45] going to get baptized. And I'm going to
[1:09:47] give my life to God.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:50] and and that's how it started.
[1:09:53] But too many people stop after that.
[1:09:57] Colossians chapter 3:8, we're describing
[1:09:59] the new birth, the nature change.
[1:10:02] Colossians chapter 3:8 But now
[1:10:05] ye also
[1:10:08] put off all these anger,
[1:10:13] wrath,
[1:10:14] malice,
[1:10:16] blasphemy,
[1:10:18] filthy communication out of your mouth.
[1:10:24] So we all had our conversations in times
[1:10:26] past, right?
[1:10:29] Now put off. put off the old nature. Lie
[1:10:34] not one to another, seeing that you have
[1:10:35] put off the old man with his deeds, and
[1:10:37] have put on the new man. Okay, the new
[1:10:40] nature which is renewed in knowledge
[1:10:42] after what? After the image of him that
[1:10:48] created him, it is God that brings the
[1:10:51] new birth inside of you. The new man is
[1:10:54] Christ inside of you
[1:10:58] where there is neither Greek nor Jew
[1:11:02] circumcision or uncircum barbarian
[1:11:04] cynthian bond nor free but Christ is all
[1:11:08] and in all put on in other words there's
[1:11:12] no excuse of who you are what your past
[1:11:14] is
[1:11:16] in other words if you got the new birth
[1:11:18] you got to put off those things and you
[1:11:20] got to put on new things put on
[1:11:23] therefore as the elect of God. If you're
[1:11:25] the elect of God, then be holy, beloved,
[1:11:29] bowels of mercy, kindness, humbleness of
[1:11:33] what? Mind. Your mind needs to be
[1:11:36] humble,
[1:11:38] meekness, longsuffering,
[1:11:41] forbearing one another, for forgiving
[1:11:44] one another. If any man ever qu against
[1:11:46] other, even as Christ forgave you, you
[1:11:48] also do you. You know what that's being
[1:11:50] described to me right there, brother
[1:11:51] Ron? What's being described to me is
[1:11:54] you're now living for others.
[1:11:57] You don't live for yourself and you know
[1:11:58] try to be long-suffering with others.
[1:12:01] That whole thing is describing what
[1:12:03] eternal life is. You're actually living
[1:12:06] for others.
[1:12:08] It's no longer looking for somebody to
[1:12:10] give you mercy. You're looking to give
[1:12:12] mercy to somebody.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; You're not looking to be loved. You're
[1:12:16] looking to love.
[1:12:19] Praise God. I love the word of God
[1:12:21] today. Can you say amen to the word of
[1:12:22] God?
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:26] And above all these things, put on
[1:12:29] charity,
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; which is the bond of perfectness. And
[1:12:34] let the peace of God ruin your heart to
[1:12:36] the which also you are called in one
[1:12:38] body, and be ye thankful. You know,
[1:12:42] that'll get the devil out of your life.
[1:12:45] Let the word of Christ dwell in you
[1:12:47] richly in all wisdom, teaching
[1:12:48] admonishing one another in psalms and
[1:12:50] hymns, spiritual songs, singing with
[1:12:52] grace in your heart to the Lord.
[1:12:56] And whatsoever you do in worded, you do
[1:12:58] it all in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[1:12:59] giving thanks to God and the father by
[1:13:02] him.
[1:13:05] Now, how
[1:13:07] does our nature change? How does it
[1:13:09] change?
[1:13:12] We are changed by one thing and only by
[1:13:15] one thing and that is the word of God.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; You cannot change your nature.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; You can put peacock feathers in in how
[1:13:28] you talk
[1:13:30] or how you act from time to time. I call
[1:13:32] those peacock feathers. But that won't
[1:13:36] make you a beautiful Christian.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; So true. A beautiful Christian comes
[1:13:41] from a beautiful God.
[1:13:44] The Holy Ghost, the nature of God,
[1:13:47] living and living for others right out
[1:13:50] of your body. That's a beautiful
[1:13:52] Christian.
[1:13:54] Living for others. The nature of Christ.
[1:13:58] The word of God is the only thing that
[1:14:00] can change you permanently.
[1:14:04] We are born by the word of God. We're
[1:14:07] born by the will of God. We are born by
[1:14:10] the word. This is what births us. How do
[1:14:15] I get this inside of me?
[1:14:18] How do I get that in here?
[1:14:24] It can only come in through free more
[1:14:26] agency,
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; not just sacrifices because obedience is
[1:14:36] better than sacrifice. He gives the Holy
[1:14:38] Ghost to them that obey. I am telling
[1:14:40] you that obedient part is when you put
[1:14:43] your foot in the water when you don't
[1:14:45] know what's going to happen.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; It's like I don't know what's going to
[1:14:48] happen in my life. I don't know if I'm
[1:14:49] going to lose my friends. I don't know
[1:14:51] if anybody's going to like me when I'm
[1:14:52] done. I I don't know what they're going
[1:14:54] to think about me when uh my spouse
[1:14:56] yells at me, but I'm not going to yell
[1:14:57] back. I don't know what's going to
[1:14:58] happen. Then you put your foot in the
[1:15:00] water
[1:15:02] and pretty soon you've got the power of
[1:15:04] God coming out of you.
[1:15:08] Is that real?
[1:15:11] If the word doesn't change you, you'll
[1:15:14] never be changed. Amen.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Your nature changes as you accept the
[1:15:19] word of God into your soul, not your
[1:15:21] head.
[1:15:23] It's not just saying amen from here, but
[1:15:25] it's saying amen from the place that
[1:15:27] love dwells.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; I love the word. I want to become the
[1:15:31] word. I want to be like Jesus.
[1:15:36] Then and only then can the word birth
[1:15:39] you into a new nature. And this is what
[1:15:41] it means to be born again.
[1:15:44] Are you with me?
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; All right. In the message, the signs of
[1:15:47] his coming. Brother Ram says, "And if
[1:15:49] it's the word of the Lord,
[1:15:53] then his pre-meditated,
[1:15:56] then it's his premeditated thoughts." If
[1:15:59] it's the word of the Lord, then it's his
[1:16:01] premeditated thoughts. Amen. That's how
[1:16:06] we have eternal life because
[1:16:09] he was spoken. Because we was spoken
[1:16:13] into existence by God.
[1:16:16] I like that. Not by joining the church,
[1:16:19] but born by the word, the original seed
[1:16:25] that God said, "Let there be." And there
[1:16:27] was. And that's the way God bs his
[1:16:30] children today in the womb of their
[1:16:33] heart with his word. And his word takes
[1:16:36] root and it grows.
[1:16:39] So is, you know, to be honest with you,
[1:16:41] just sitting here and just kind of being
[1:16:43] common sense just is really getting more
[1:16:46] serious with the word of God.
[1:16:48] You know, saying I I want I want the
[1:16:50] word to be born in me. I I just want
[1:16:52] that and and I'm I'm I'm not I'm not
[1:16:54] just going to be here for an hour or
[1:16:56] two, but you know, I'm going to go home
[1:16:58] and I'm going to think about this and
[1:16:59] and I'm going to I'm going to spend some
[1:17:01] time reading and and praying and and
[1:17:03] asking God to birth him himself in me
[1:17:05] because that's what's happening. It's
[1:17:07] God birthing himself in you. That's what
[1:17:10] it means to be born again. It's it's not
[1:17:12] it's it's God in you.
[1:17:15] Oh my. That's why the the Pharisees
[1:17:18] didn't like Jesus saying he was the son
[1:17:20] of God because God don't have any
[1:17:22] children.
[1:17:26] We're all We're all God. We're a part of
[1:17:29] God. He took a part of us.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; And he threw it like that.
[1:17:34] He predestinated in the hearts of
[1:17:36] people.
[1:17:39] That's why
[1:17:41] the Bible teaches us that we're gods.
[1:17:44] And and brother Brandham said, you have
[1:17:46] you have the power inside of you to go
[1:17:47] create a world and go live on it because
[1:17:51] it's Christ in us, the hope of glory.
[1:17:54] We're birthed by a living God, not a
[1:17:56] dead letter, not trying to do dos and
[1:17:59] don'ts, not keeping the ten
[1:18:00] commandments. We're birthed by a living
[1:18:02] God. It's coming in contact with a a
[1:18:05] spirit that desiring to live inside of
[1:18:07] us.
[1:18:10] He says, "How can a spirit in a human
[1:18:12] heart say it's of God
[1:18:16] and deny this word?"
[1:18:20] And I love that challenge, Brother
[1:18:21] Marty.
[1:18:23] You say you have the Holy Spirit, but
[1:18:26] you're going to tell me with your your
[1:18:28] your your mouth that the word of God
[1:18:31] isn't true, and this is not what it
[1:18:33] means.
[1:18:35] When the very God word itself
[1:18:39] is
[1:18:41] is what is in the human heart
[1:18:45] and if it isn't, it's some something
[1:18:48] else. Then it isn't the Holy Spirit
[1:18:50] there. All right? So, he's trying to
[1:18:52] tell us that when you receive
[1:18:57] the spirit of God inside your heart,
[1:19:00] you're going to say amen to every word
[1:19:02] of God. You're going to agree with the
[1:19:04] word of God because the Holy Spirit is
[1:19:05] what wrote this word. It wasn't written
[1:19:08] by men of old. But holy men of God is
[1:19:10] they were moved on by the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:12] And when that holy that same Holy Spirit
[1:19:14] comes and lives inside you, you will say
[1:19:16] amen to that. I want that for my life,
[1:19:18] Lord.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the biggest thing. My my
[1:19:21] biggest concern
[1:19:23] is that we don't miss
[1:19:26] the new birth,
[1:19:29] that we we get completely born again,
[1:19:32] that we don't come short. Because
[1:19:34] there's I'm telling you, there's
[1:19:35] churches out there that will fight you
[1:19:37] tooth and nail that they're born again.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; And they have no concept of what it
[1:19:42] really even means.
[1:19:45] And so, this is a serious thing in this
[1:19:48] age. It's more than in Luther's age.
[1:19:52] In Luther's age, we could just sit there
[1:19:54] and say, "I believe and feel justified."
[1:19:57] But not in this age.
[1:20:00] This age, we've got to take the whole
[1:20:02] word. And and I'm sorry, it's the
[1:20:05] hardest age, Brother Ram said, to live
[1:20:06] in. And I don't think it's just because
[1:20:08] of all the things that were up up
[1:20:10] against us, but the whole word is
[1:20:12] required of us.
[1:20:15] And the righteous scarcely make it,
[1:20:19] right? is it's no seabbze.
[1:20:22] 1 Peter chapter 1 18. 1 Peter chapter 1
[1:20:26] 18. Are you getting something out of
[1:20:27] this?
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. For as much as you know that you
[1:20:31] were not redeemed with corruptible
[1:20:33] things as silver and of gold from your
[1:20:37] vain conversations, received by
[1:20:39] tradition from your fathers, but with
[1:20:42] the precious blood of Christ as of a
[1:20:45] lamb without blemish and without spot,
[1:20:48] who verily was fore orained before the
[1:20:51] foundation of the world, but was
[1:20:53] manifest in these last times for you,
[1:20:56] who by him do believe in God that raised
[1:20:59] him from the dead and gave him glory
[1:21:01] that your faith and hope might be in
[1:21:03] God.
[1:21:05] Seeing seeing that you believe this,
[1:21:08] seeing that you have purified your souls
[1:21:11] now in obeying the truth. Now notice not
[1:21:15] now notice what purifies the soul.
[1:21:19] It's not just the blood at Calvary.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; That does wash away your sins.
[1:21:27] But what purifies the soul is obeying
[1:21:31] the word that's presented to you.
[1:21:34] That puts you in a different position
[1:21:36] with God.
[1:21:38] Seeing that you have purified your souls
[1:21:39] in obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:21:43] unto unfeigned love of the brethren.
[1:21:47] Oh, I love that. See that you love one
[1:21:50] another with a pure heart fervently. See
[1:21:54] how the the the the soul the purifying
[1:21:57] of the soul is is you're obeying the
[1:22:00] truth through the spirit and you have
[1:22:02] the unconditional love of God and and
[1:22:06] and that you love one another. Every you
[1:22:08] just love everybody.
[1:22:11] I mean this this is what brings about a
[1:22:13] purifying inside when you love
[1:22:15] everybody. when you try to have this
[1:22:17] personal walk with God and you know it's
[1:22:19] between me and God and I can hate who
[1:22:21] I'm going to hate and like who I'm going
[1:22:22] to like and you know you that is so far
[1:22:26] deceived
[1:22:31] we got the I'm so glad that we got the
[1:22:33] word of God to straighten things out
[1:22:35] where would we be without the word of
[1:22:37] God all right verse 23 where I want to
[1:22:40] get to being born again
[1:22:42] not of corruptible seed but of
[1:22:46] incorruptible
[1:22:48] by the word of God which liveth and
[1:22:50] abideth forever. We're born again by the
[1:22:53] word of God. There it is right there.
[1:22:54] That's scripture.
[1:22:56] Born again by the word which lives and
[1:22:59] abides forever. In other words, it's the
[1:23:02] same yesterday, today, and forever. God
[1:23:03] is the same yesterday, and forever. I
[1:23:05] think you should be the same yesterday,
[1:23:07] today, and forever.
[1:23:09] Can you say amen to that? Amen.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; I I think I I I think we need to be what
[1:23:16] Jesus is. That's what God's calling us
[1:23:17] to be, the new birth.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; For all flesh is as grass, and the glory
[1:23:23] of man is the flower of grass, and the
[1:23:24] grass wither, and the flower of our
[1:23:26] faith way. was having uh dinner the
[1:23:28] other day and Aayesh I was talking to
[1:23:31] Cheryl and I said it's just something
[1:23:32] all these people have died that we know
[1:23:35] and all the I'm sure those of you that
[1:23:37] at one time you you watch certain actors
[1:23:40] when they were in the prime of their
[1:23:41] youth and they had these great movies
[1:23:44] and they they just they either looked
[1:23:46] handsome or look pretty whichever
[1:23:47] actress or actress and and they get they
[1:23:50] get old and and they die and you look
[1:23:53] back and they got this legacy
[1:23:57] and and and they were
[1:24:00] whatever whatever whatever it was. But
[1:24:03] it's nothing.
[1:24:05] It's nothing. It's gone. It It's a
[1:24:09] vapor. It It's something. Only what's
[1:24:11] done for Christ is ever going to last,
[1:24:13] ever going to mean anything when we're
[1:24:14] dead. It's it's what happens. What is
[1:24:18] what we do for Christ is the only thing
[1:24:20] we'll be able to take with us
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; on the other side.
[1:24:24] You don't have to be a great actor. You
[1:24:26] don't have to have lots of money.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; You don't have to
[1:24:30] do some great thing.
[1:24:33] Just love God with all your heart.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Love God with all your heart.
[1:24:40] So all flesh, yours and mine, is as
[1:24:44] grass. And the glory of man, look at me,
[1:24:47] as the flower of grass. And the grass
[1:24:50] witherth, and the flower thereof fallth
[1:24:51] away. But the word of the Lord endures
[1:24:54] forever. And this is the word which by
[1:24:56] the gospel was preached unto you. The
[1:24:58] word of God is what brings a new nature
[1:25:02] that permanently keeps you like Jesus.
[1:25:06] Keeps you. We're born by the word. Amen.
[1:25:10] First John chapter 11.
[1:25:13] Not 1 John. St. John chapter 1 verse 11.
[1:25:16] I'll get it right. I got a little
[1:25:18] nervous. Run out of time. Got more
[1:25:20] scriptures to go.
[1:25:22] Jesus said he came to his own and his
[1:25:24] own received him not. But as many as
[1:25:27] received him
[1:25:29] to this group of people to become sons
[1:25:31] of God, he gave them power to become
[1:25:33] sons of God. Even to them that believe
[1:25:35] on his name.
[1:25:40] As many as received him. That's free
[1:25:43] more agency right there.
[1:25:45] Just receive the word. Well, you you may
[1:25:50] say, "I've already received Jesus into
[1:25:52] my heart." But when you come to church
[1:25:54] and the word is being preached to you,
[1:25:56] that's Jesus being preached to you.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; And you need to receive that word in
[1:26:02] order to receive Jesus today.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Is it you? It's you. You don't say,
[1:26:07] "I've already received Jesus, but I
[1:26:08] don't want his word." That's what the
[1:26:09] denominations do.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; All right. which were born not of blood,
[1:26:17] nor the will of the flesh, nor the will
[1:26:19] of man, but of God. It's not it's not
[1:26:24] just the will of our flesh or our
[1:26:27] parents' will or our spouse's flesh that
[1:26:30] brings the new birth.
[1:26:33] The new birth comes when God's spoken
[1:26:37] word is spoken to you. You accept it
[1:26:40] into your heart.
[1:26:44] and you begin to walk in it.
[1:26:46] And that is what brings the new life.
[1:26:50] And the new life is the testimony that
[1:26:53] you're born again.
[1:26:55] I'm telling you, you could be I I
[1:26:57] remember I outright thinner
[1:27:00] smoking, drinking, you name it, I did
[1:27:03] it.
[1:27:06] Did a lot up to my age, right? I got it
[1:27:08] all done, you know, very quickly.
[1:27:12] didn't wait till I was 25.
[1:27:17] And
[1:27:18] I remember there was a little tug of war
[1:27:20] with God.
[1:27:24] But when I made the decision that I'm
[1:27:26] going to give my life to God, I made
[1:27:28] that decision
[1:27:30] and I went and I got baptized
[1:27:35] and I still had things of the world
[1:27:36] hanging on me.
[1:27:39] But I know the new birth started, James.
[1:27:42] It had started because I walked in the
[1:27:46] truth that was presented be to me. I
[1:27:50] didn't even know what was wrong. All the
[1:27:53] things that were wrong in my life. I
[1:27:54] they were yet to be preached to me and
[1:27:57] told to me. Now, some of them I knew. I
[1:27:59] just knew that God wasn't really dealing
[1:28:01] with this is the first thing I got to
[1:28:02] do.
[1:28:04] I mean, he didn't say, you know, go stop
[1:28:06] your smoking, then I'll I'll think about
[1:28:08] accepting you into my kingdom. He didn't
[1:28:10] do that.
[1:28:14] But what we do need to do is we need to
[1:28:16] get serious with God wherever we're at.
[1:28:20] I mean, there came a time that I had to
[1:28:22] give up stuff.
[1:28:25] And that that why did that have to
[1:28:28] happen, Sister Lori? That had to happen
[1:28:30] so the new birth could continue. so it
[1:28:33] can continue in my life. And here here I
[1:28:36] am in 2025. And what is what is needed,
[1:28:38] brother Jonathan, for me is for the new
[1:28:40] birth to continue.
[1:28:42] I want to become more like Jesus. Uh
[1:28:46] Paul said after 30 something years, I'm
[1:28:48] not there.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; I haven't attained. I haven't
[1:28:51] apprehended.
[1:28:53] But I'm pressing towards
[1:28:55] because there's a deep calling inside of
[1:28:57] me to be more like Jesus. And it's, you
[1:29:01] know, if it was through free more agency
[1:29:03] that I got baptized, it has to be
[1:29:04] through more agency that I become more
[1:29:06] like Jesus today. It don't stop and it's
[1:29:10] not automatically there. It is not
[1:29:12] automatically there. That is why Jesus
[1:29:14] said we must die daily. We must crucify
[1:29:17] our flesh.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; We must uh put off the old man. We must
[1:29:21] put on the new man
[1:29:24] because our flesh isn't just willing to
[1:29:26] just get all excited about God.
[1:29:29] Sometimes we got to stomp them down and
[1:29:32] say, "I'm going to praise the Lord even
[1:29:33] if I don't feel like it.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to come to church and say amen
[1:29:37] to the word of God, but I don't feel
[1:29:38] like it."
[1:29:40] Because I'm on the hallelujah side.
[1:29:44] I'm not on the downer side. I'm on the
[1:29:46] hallelujah side.
[1:29:48] All right. Romans chapter 8 verse 10. If
[1:29:51] Christ be in you, Lord, help me to get
[1:29:54] through this. If Christ be in you, the
[1:29:56] body is dead because of sin,
[1:30:00] but the spirit is life because of
[1:30:02] righteousness. But if the spirit of him
[1:30:07] that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:30:11] dwell inside of you,
[1:30:15] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:30:18] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:30:20] the spirit that dwelleth in you.
[1:30:23] So there's the key. There's the key to
[1:30:25] the rapture.
[1:30:29] If you got the Holy Ghost,
[1:30:34] God is not going to leave you behind.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; You're not going to be left behind. It
[1:30:40] is it is the token for the rapture.
[1:30:44] But it can't be just part.
[1:30:49] It can't be just justification. And
[1:30:50] that's a that's a working of the Holy
[1:30:52] Ghost. But it can't just be that.
[1:30:57] You've got to be sure that you're sure
[1:30:59] that you're sure that you're you're just
[1:31:00] like him.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; And and and when you're not seeing that
[1:31:04] in your life, you need to be putting
[1:31:06] time into that.
[1:31:09] Put time into it because it's the only
[1:31:10] way it's going to get there.
[1:31:12] If I wait till I got all my bills paid,
[1:31:15] I'm going to tell you, I think I think
[1:31:18] the rapture is going to come first. This
[1:31:20] is not my desire, but I know my bills
[1:31:23] and I know how much is coming in weekly
[1:31:25] and it is not looking good.
[1:31:29] But you know, they can have it. They can
[1:31:31] have the greenhouse when we're when
[1:31:33] we're gone, right? And they'll get a lot
[1:31:34] more out of it than what I own. But
[1:31:39] don't wait till things are just all
[1:31:41] keep, you know, perfect for you. Seek
[1:31:44] the Holy Ghost which is the living word
[1:31:46] of God. Not the dead letter but the
[1:31:51] living word of God. Jesus said the words
[1:31:52] that I speak unto you, they are spirit
[1:31:55] in their life.
[1:31:57] We know when God does birth us, we will
[1:32:00] live after the word. That's what I want
[1:32:03] to tell you. When you do get the Holy
[1:32:06] Ghost, when you do become born again,
[1:32:08] you will live after the word. It won't
[1:32:11] be something that you can just take or
[1:32:13] leave.
[1:32:15] You won't have that attitude. It's not
[1:32:17] something you can run away from. It's
[1:32:20] not something you can choose to stay
[1:32:21] home from church. When you become born
[1:32:24] again, something takes place in your
[1:32:25] life.
[1:32:27] And when God b you by the spoken word,
[1:32:31] you will love after the word. You will
[1:32:34] seek after the word. You will crave to
[1:32:36] hear the word of God ministered.
[1:32:40] We will begin to have a love affair with
[1:32:43] the word. The word will become an open
[1:32:45] book. It'll be the only thing you want
[1:32:46] to talk about.
[1:32:48] Amen. It'll be the only thing that you
[1:32:51] really, really want to talk about.
[1:32:54] We'll reverence the word more than we've
[1:32:56] ever reverenced it before. The message
[1:32:59] of the hour will birth us into rapturing
[1:33:03] faith. Can you say amen to that? That's
[1:33:05] just that's just the message of the
[1:33:07] hour.
[1:33:08] The word of God begins to take effect in
[1:33:11] our natural lives and we begin to
[1:33:13] overcome things
[1:33:16] because the overcomers living in you.
[1:33:19] And before you know it, uh you start to
[1:33:22] overcome this and you overcome that and
[1:33:24] you know how to handle this and you know
[1:33:26] how to handle that. And before you know
[1:33:27] it, you're helping others to overcome.
[1:33:30] This is how you overcome that. And this
[1:33:32] is what would do. This will help you get
[1:33:33] to where you want to get to over here.
[1:33:34] And before you know it, you're
[1:33:36] overcomers. You're the church of the
[1:33:37] overcomers
[1:33:40] and you Jesus said
[1:33:43] um he comes knocking.
[1:33:47] If you open the door, let me in. We'll
[1:33:50] suck together. He says to him that
[1:33:53] overcomemeth, I will grant to sit with
[1:33:55] me in my in my throne as I have overcame
[1:33:58] as I have overcame and sat with my
[1:34:00] father in his throne.
[1:34:02] So the key to getting this new birth is
[1:34:04] to be overcomers.
[1:34:06] And there's a lot to overcome in this
[1:34:07] world.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; There's a lot to overcome. But the new
[1:34:11] birth is what brings it. Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said in the message
[1:34:15] conflict between God and Satan. He says,
[1:34:17] "Now what is the word of God?" The word
[1:34:20] of God is God himself.
[1:34:24] So God gave the believer himself.
[1:34:28] That's how important the word is. We're
[1:34:31] really hearing God. We're just not
[1:34:33] hearing a book called the Bible, but
[1:34:36] we're hearing God. This is the heart of
[1:34:38] God. That's why God
[1:34:41] God wants it wants his word to be
[1:34:43] reverenced.
[1:34:46] God gave the believer himself. Amen.
[1:34:48] Woo. He says it's God himself. He gave
[1:34:51] the believer himself to attack the enemy
[1:34:54] by. In other words, he's the father and
[1:34:57] the word is God. Then the word is our
[1:35:01] father and we're born by the word and
[1:35:03] he's standing in the front forefront of
[1:35:05] his children. Amen. There you are. We're
[1:35:08] standing out there. Uh he's standing out
[1:35:11] there for his children. And what are we
[1:35:13] scared about? The rapture is sure. The
[1:35:15] coming is sure. Every blessing there's
[1:35:17] been promised is ours. All belongs to us
[1:35:22] because God is inside of us.
[1:35:26] That's why nothing can separate us from
[1:35:27] the love of God because he's inside.
[1:35:31] He's not an Indian giver.
[1:35:33] He makes a promise.
[1:35:36] Right?
[1:35:39] So when you're born by the word, your
[1:35:41] new nature will also cause you to stop
[1:35:44] living for yourself
[1:35:48] because eternal life, brother says, is
[1:35:50] living for others. And it starts here on
[1:35:54] earth. The kingdom of God is inside of
[1:35:57] us here. So we don't wait till we go to
[1:36:00] heaven to start living for others. We
[1:36:02] start living for others right here,
[1:36:05] right now, today.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; I love that. But the Brandon said in the
[1:36:11] message
[1:36:13] uh that day on Calvary, he says, "Now
[1:36:14] look
[1:36:17] what the day on Calvary did to you. It
[1:36:20] paid your price. It settled the
[1:36:22] question.
[1:36:25] He says, "Your sins,
[1:36:28] you know, you know, it got warm in
[1:36:29] here."
[1:36:32] He says, "Your your sins be as scarlet.
[1:36:36] Uh they're as white as snow, but like
[1:36:39] crimson, white as wool."
[1:36:42] Then you have no sin. You're perfectly
[1:36:45] sinless. No matter what you've done or
[1:36:48] what you'll do, you're still sinless. As
[1:36:51] long as you've accepted Jesus Christ as
[1:36:54] your savior, your sins are forgiven.
[1:36:57] Anything is forgiven is remitted and
[1:37:00] forgotten about. You say amen to that.
[1:37:03] Right?
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Then what does it do? This is the most
[1:37:07] important part of the quote.
[1:37:10] It gives you after that condition his
[1:37:14] spirit to follow him and to do as he did
[1:37:18] for others who is following on. He was
[1:37:22] just one man the perfect man. He gave
[1:37:25] his life and he made an example for you.
[1:37:28] And now what must we do? Question mark.
[1:37:31] Now the first thing I want to say is
[1:37:34] Jesus never lived for himself.
[1:37:37] His
[1:37:39] life was spent for others. That's
[1:37:42] perfectly eternal life. When you say you
[1:37:45] go to church and do good things, that's
[1:37:47] fine. But when you live your life to
[1:37:50] yourself, you have an eternal life.
[1:37:54] It should be a big amens on that one.
[1:37:57] Eternal life is living for others. It
[1:37:59] proved it. When come the lamb of God, he
[1:38:02] lived and had eternal life. And because
[1:38:05] he did not live for himself, he lived
[1:38:08] for others. For God so loved the world
[1:38:10] that he gave his only begotten son. And
[1:38:14] you receive eternal life by receiving
[1:38:16] that today. And you don't live for
[1:38:18] yourself no more. You live for others.
[1:38:20] And someone said, "How can you stand and
[1:38:22] let somebody call you such bad names?
[1:38:26] And you don't." He says, "You don't live
[1:38:28] for yourself. You live for others.
[1:38:32] you might redeem that man,
[1:38:35] you become sons. And the trouble of it
[1:38:37] is the church has forgotten they were
[1:38:39] sons. In other words, they call me a bad
[1:38:43] name and I'm not going to like them
[1:38:44] anymore.
[1:38:47] That's that's what that they they forgot
[1:38:49] they were a child of God and they have
[1:38:51] that attitude. He says, "But you're a
[1:38:54] son. You're taking Christ's place.
[1:38:56] You're a son. So you don't live for
[1:38:59] yourself. You live for others." Well,
[1:39:01] brother Brandon, I can live for this
[1:39:03] brother because he sure is a nice man.
[1:39:06] He said, 'Th that's not it. He says,
[1:39:09] 'Live for the man that hates you. Live
[1:39:12] for the person who will kill you if they
[1:39:15] could.
[1:39:16] That's what they that's uh that's what
[1:39:19] they done to him. They killed him and he
[1:39:22] died that he might save them. That's
[1:39:25] eternal life.
[1:39:27] when you when that's in your bosom, he
[1:39:30] says, you're facing heaven then,
[1:39:33] but you sacrifice your own things and
[1:39:35] give them up like the sheep gives up its
[1:39:37] woe. You look on towards Calvary. And I
[1:39:40] hope this helps you get to get in a
[1:39:44] place. That's what the tabernacle,
[1:39:48] that's what all the people has got to do
[1:39:50] is find out where you are, what the
[1:39:53] purpose.
[1:39:55] Church isn't going to church just to
[1:39:57] play music and sing songs. Church is a
[1:40:00] place where correction,
[1:40:03] judgment begins at the house of God. So
[1:40:06] we must reckon ourselves dead and alive
[1:40:09] to Christ. And he made the way that
[1:40:14] would sacrifice ourselves to his service
[1:40:17] to follow him. And if we follow him, we
[1:40:21] will lead the life that he lived.
[1:40:24] And that's he said that's wonderful.
[1:40:27] Eternal life is really living for
[1:40:29] others. That's what it means to be born
[1:40:32] again.
[1:40:34] You're you're I would say don't stop
[1:40:37] until you know you become like Christ to
[1:40:42] the point that you're living for others.
[1:40:44] And I just I know we're just a couple
[1:40:46] minutes past, but I want to read this
[1:40:47] real quick. It's in 2 Corinthians 5:17.
[1:40:52] Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he's
[1:40:55] a new creature. Old things are passed
[1:40:57] away, behold, all things have become
[1:40:59] new, and all things are of God, who have
[1:41:01] reconciled us by Jes to himself by Jesus
[1:41:04] Christ, and have given to us a ministry
[1:41:07] of reconciliation,
[1:41:09] to with that God was in Christ,
[1:41:11] reconciling the world to himself, not
[1:41:13] imputing their trespasses unto them, and
[1:41:15] have committed unto us the word of
[1:41:17] reconciliation. Now then we are
[1:41:19] ambassadors for Christ as though God did
[1:41:22] beseech you by us. We pray you in
[1:41:25] Christstead. Be reconciled to God. Get
[1:41:27] get right with God. For he have made him
[1:41:30] to be sin for us who knew no sin that we
[1:41:33] might be the righteousness of God in
[1:41:35] him. Let's stand together. I say it like
[1:41:37] this. Keep moving forward until you see
[1:41:41] the whole word of God living inside of
[1:41:43] you.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop
[1:41:49] seeking Christ.
[1:41:51] If if you be risen with Christ and seek
[1:41:53] those things which are above, where
[1:41:54] Christ siteth on the right hand of God.
[1:41:58] Amen. Let's sing that chorus. He's still
[1:42:00] working on me.
[1:42:06] I can sing this with all my heart. Amen.
[1:42:13] That's F.
[1:42:20] He's still working on me
[1:42:25] to make me what I ought to be.
[1:42:30] It took him just a week to make the moon
[1:42:34] and the stars, the Earth and the Sun,
[1:42:38] Jupiter and Mars. How loving and patient
[1:42:42] he must be.
[1:42:45] He's still working on me.
[1:42:51] He's still working on me.
[1:42:55] To make me what I ought to be.
[1:43:00] It took him just a week to make the moon
[1:43:03] and the stars, the sun and the earth and
[1:43:08] Jupiter and Mars. How loving and patient
[1:43:12] he must be.
[1:43:15] He's still working on me. One more time.
[1:43:19] Oh, still working on me.
[1:43:24] To make me what I ought to be.
[1:43:29] It took him just a week to make the moon
[1:43:32] and the stars, the sun and the earth and
[1:43:36] Jupiter and Mars. How loving and patient
[1:43:41] he must be.
[1:43:44] He's still working on me.
[1:43:48] Jesus on the inside.
[1:43:52] Jesus on the inside, working on the
[1:43:56] outside. Oh, what a change in my life.
[1:44:03] Jesus on the inside, working on the
[1:44:07] outside. Oh, what a change in my life.
[1:44:13] Jesus on the inside, working on the
[1:44:17] outside. Oh, what a change in my life.
[1:44:24] Oh, what a change
[1:44:29] in my life.
[1:44:34] Jesus on the inside, working on the
[1:44:38] outside. Oh, what a change in my life.
[1:44:44] Jesus on the inside working on the
[1:44:48] outside. Oh, what a change in my life.
[1:44:54] Jesus on the inside, working on the
[1:44:58] outside. Oh, what a change in my life.
[1:45:05] Oh, what a change
[1:45:09] in my life.
[1:45:15] Amen. Amen. Let's sing. It's not by
[1:45:18] might. We don't want to figure it out.
[1:45:20] We just want to start start following
[1:45:22] the word. Amen.
[1:45:25] It's not by might.
[1:45:28] It's not by power,
[1:45:30] but by my spirit, saith the Lord.
[1:45:36] It's not by might,
[1:45:38] it's not by power, but by my spirit,
[1:45:43] saith the Lord.
[1:45:46] This mountain shall be removed.
[1:45:51] This mountain shall be removed. His
[1:45:57] mountain shall be removed
[1:46:01] by my spirit, saith the Lord.
[1:46:06] It's not by might.
[1:46:08] It's not by power, but by my spirit,
[1:46:13] say, "Amen. We want more of you, Lord.
[1:46:16] It's not by might.
[1:46:18] is not by power, but by my spirit, saith
[1:46:23] the Lord.
[1:46:26] This mountain shall be removed.
[1:46:31] This mountain shall be removed.
[1:46:35] This mountain shall be removed.
[1:46:40] By my spirit said,
