wisdom in understanding where they are now can they just move on like nothing happened or they just want the peace of the Lord about it you know you can change your life if if you lot it and it should

anybody else that has any kind of health issues I know I know anybody else deals with allergies here I do real bad and it seems like it's gonna be a bad season because he's really bothering me a lot so just pray for me in that regard hey man let's just stand if there's any unspoken say not a lot to be known to the Lord and we pray that the Lord just touches your heart tonight through the word

possible [Music] only believe all things are possible [Music] believe lord I believe would I be all things are possible [Music] would I be me all these are possible [Music] amen amen very important to announce at cuz a lot of times the devil he'll come and he'll just tell you just the opposite and you just gotta shout it out amen shout it out that gets the devil away when you take a stand but yet as brother Daryl made mention how simple it is to believe we don't need to have great things we don't have to have money we're not deaf talent we just need to trust the Lord that he'll bring his word to pass in our life amen well god bless you this evening turn with me if you would to the book of first John chapter three it's really good to see brother Tyler a man's been a long time god bless you I'm glad to see that the Lord is keeping you amen amen amen first John chapter three and we're gonna read the first three verses there maybe before we begin reading if we could just look to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we reverence you respect you bow before you Lord ask you to cleanse us of our sins our iniquities our thoughts anything that would stand in the way from you having your complete liberty in our hearts tonight in this service Lord we pray that you would take thy precious word and make it alive to us Lord may the the spirit that's behind this letter coming to our hearts now give us revelation that we might become or ready for your coming it will give you the praise and honor for these things Lord we ask them in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen first John chapter 3 verse 1 the behold what manner of love the father had bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear were going to be like a man for we shall see him as he is every man that have this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure we want to take our text from verse 3 and everyone that have this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure god bless you may be seated brother Daryl also contacted us yesterday wanted to let you all know that Ellison had passed the test and she actually was had called we missed a call just to express her or Thanksgiving but she appreciated the prayers and also brother Daryl did as well amen I don't know if a request got in from brother Marty and sister Kathleen but they're traveling up north for a couple weeks ten days about so we could be in prayer that God would just bless and strengthen them in every way amen well last Saturday just this last Saturday I saw a license plate and the back of the cards you know how you're always wanting to read things trying to figure it out what does this mean well the one it was in front of me was ready and immediately the thought that came to my mind was ready for what you know they're sending a message ready for what you gonna drag race ready for what and after that I thought about where Jesus said be ready for him coming in an hour you think not but a lot of people don't are not ready they're not even thinking about being ready they're like looking at that sign what does that mean ready well we want to touch on part three a time for purification about being ready and it is our time this is our time I think this part of the rapture we play a big role in it as we read into Scripture every man that have this hope I'm going to be like Jesus when he returns I'm going to be ready for the rapture I'm going to make myself ready the bride makes herself ready every man that has this hope inside of them purifies himself in other words he plays a part in the sanctification role and in part one I if I could I just want to take my time and maybe probably spend half the service just going through the first two parts if that's okay I can get some more amens and then you got to make up for everybody else you know that they're not here so extra amens but in part 1 of the series being ready we discussed the difference between getting ready and maintaining a state of being ready it takes much more effort to be in a state of being ready and that's what Jesus said be ready he just didn't say work on getting ready too often we can be content with the efforts that we put forth in just getting ready and never having the goal of I need to be ready because he can become in any day any any hour amen and and not for me to determine whether you're ready or you're getting ready but it is a question that you need to answer right it's a question that you need to answer and we we took our scripture in Matthew 24:42 watch therefore for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come watch watch it's a verb it's an action word and it means to keep awake spiritually be be vigilant so that's what it means to watch you can't just watch carnally amen but know this that if the good man of the house had known in what watch or what hour what time the thief were to come he would have kept awake that word watch means CAPTA wake and would have not suffered his house to be broken up therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh so he's coming as a thief in the night in other words there's an unawareness and he does not owe us the time that he's coming our love and dedication to him is all that he's requiring and he'll he'll take care of the rest therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour she think now the Son of man cometh now remember brother Branham he said that many will not recognize that he came in left remember he said that people will be coming in to church thinking that they're getting saved but they're not because the days of the Gentiles was over that's the reason why there's a lot of time to get ready so this is an important role for us it is not God's job to get me ready because if it was then it would be his job to get everybody else ready now he can only do I can't do what he could do but I have to control my attitude my efforts and being diligent and caring about the subject Jesus I believe in these scriptures here in Matthew 24 is teaching us about a state of awareness when he says be ready he's teaching us about a state of awareness to be ready he said many will come to me in that day and say Lord what about this I did this and I did that and he says I never knew you so they were they were not in a state of awareness of what God had required they thought what they did was good enough so while the enemy is lukewarm mean it's this word I'm making up Luke warming the church into a comfortable state of unawareness of their mind the Holy Ghost is telling us to wake up to pinch our conscious to snap out of it to press in that's what exactly what the Prophet said and I believe when we were feeling that that I got to do something like I got a wonderful phone call today as the request came in from brother Ron Husker and what he was expressing to me it almost sounded like he thought the rapture take place because he called yesterday he couldn't get through and I didn't call him back and had been sent so long since year he actually thought the rapture had taken place and it just I wanted to be ready he wanted to be ready and I think that's the Holy Ghost that's always wanting us to be ready and the devil is telling the church they are ready understand the difference I don't really I see at the very end Paul said I am I fought a good fight I'm ready I fit it at the very end of it but all through his whole walk he was pressing in amen first I just have a few scriptures on this for us first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 34 awake to righteousness now remember when we talked about that word watch it means to keep awake spiritually so when I'm talking when this scripture is being read here awake to righteousness it means being in a state of awareness spiritual awareness that you you you know what's happening in the spiritual realm not well this is my opinion our penis could be wrong so a way to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of God I speeches to their shame so Laodicea don't have the knowledge that they need to awake to right through to righteousness they're there they're sleeping they're sleeping virgin they're in need of nothing they're okay in their state but but he's saying to the bride awake to righteousness amen Ephesians 5 verse 14 wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give you light so there is a state that we could be in that we're basically sleeping spiritually we're not walking in the spirit when you're not walking in the spirit you're sleeping because you're not aware and and in policy and awake thou that sleepest okay verse 15 see then that you walk circumspectly that word circumspectly means diligently perfectly exactly see then that you walk perfectly and not as fool's but as wise so how do I do that how do I walk perfectly verse 16 redeemed the time this is now time to be sleeping redeem it use this time to get ready because the days are evil it's not getting is it easier for us I mean after the colvin 19 has been flattened we're on the other side is it easier for us do we feel more energetic in the Lord do we feel like all I can't wait it's harder it's harder the days are things are gonna get worse we have to be the ones oppressed through this we have to make the choices to purify ourselves and to and to make this world live in us we can make that choice amen verse 17 wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is what is the will of the Lord be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit so they'll understand the will the Lord is get more of the Holy Ghost get more of the Holy Ghost Romans chapter 13 verse 11 and that knowing the time knowing the time that now is high time to awake out of our sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we first believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not rioting boy we need to put that on Fox News not rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envy but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof so our salvation is near them when we first believed so the culmination of the rapture is nearer than when we first believed so we want to labor to stay in that state of being ready it is not like I got a a picture today from brother Mike Helms who who sent me a picture he was he went to that famous barber in a Lhasa and he got a picture with the famous barber that you know we all seen on TV and you when you go to get a haircut you cuz it Oh got a haircut it's done it's over with but maintaining a state of being ready is a constant everyday affair are you with me so we need to labor to stay in that that's part one so part two we talked about the full atonement and we learned that there's a large group of believers who reject the fullness of the atonement the scary part is they don't think they've rejected it but they have and they don't know it they're not realizing that they they reject to walk in further truth when we reject to walk in further truth we reject the fullness of Calvary no wonder Paul said I know nothing he said Christ and him crucified that's all that's in in the more you know of Calvary which we haven't discovered everything yet we know it was a an act that he did that he paid the price for us but there's so much in there for us and we have to receive it all we went through the ten virgins and the borderline believers in Egypt who believed enough to come out of the world but did not believe enough to die out to get the Holy Ghost the five foolish virgins they did not get enough oil for their journey the borderline believers believed up to the border and they did they didn't want to suffer remember brother Brandon when they asked brother Branham after the bride is raptured will any of the foolish virgins be saved or will they be lost of course after the bride is raptured there's no there's no more Gentiles being saved those that our save will remain saved but they will have to go through tribulation and then they'll have to sleep for a thousand years and then we'll have the white throne judgment and then there ever the books will be open and and and we'll be judging right sitting on the throne with Jesus and judging them I mean but why is virgins gonna be judging the foolish virgin are you with me all right but because the foolish virgins like the children of Israel did not want to suffer both of them didn't want to suffer you have to suffer to get the Holy Ghost you have to suffer to purify yourself you have to suffer the children of Israel had to suffer to go in there and take the promised land and they didn't want to suffer they made a choice not to make the consecration and let the Holy Ghost come in because that's how the song goes make the consecration and let the Holy Ghost come in to make a consecration it takes suffering when brother Branham he would often rededicate his life to the Lord well that took suffering crucified in the flesh brother Brennan said the foolish virgins will have to go through tribulation period the reason of it is is because they rejected the atonement in its fullness she's a believer a professor believer but she still has to go through the tribulation period now she's rejected part of the atonement part of Calvary because many people look at Calvary as just a Christmas gift that's like it's thinking that God doesn't have any Commandments for us the Calvary allowed his Holy Ghost to come inside of us that's what I did we still have to get the Holy Ghost because if Calvary just gave the Holy Ghost everybody everybody would have it without Calvary there was no way God was coming inside of another man never but because the Calvary the price was paid and now he could come inside but it's still up to us to believe for that Holy Ghost that we can receive more and I just say for the bride there's more now to the foolish virgin they're not going all the way anyways so enough enough but to the bride give me oil in my lamp keep me burning keep me burning we can say in this hour that there is a group of professed believers who believe exactly the same way the elect believe until they reach the border of crossing over into the Holy Ghost they're a borderline believer it's too hard to believe for a complete nature change I'm okay with God died for me my sins are forgiven I'm going to heaven I can believe for that but if I have to believe if I have to keep adding to my faith virtue and virtue knowledge and knowledge temperance and keep adding to my life and keep purifying my life and keep having Christ more manifested in me well that that that can become too hard are you with me so to reject the atonement and its fullness really means to reject Calvary in its fullness atonement is not to be looked at as just a gift it means to exchange restoration or reconciliation so you are exchanging your will for God's will you are becoming restored back if you are this is where you get if you are son of God you always were something of God if you are the elect you're just being restored back to with that original thought that God had in his mind at the beginning Calvary was meant to take us beyond the bondage of this world and making us into heaven Calvary was was meant to take us beyond it was meant to take us over into the promised land into a complete nature change now that was the intent of Calvary 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 therefore if any man be in Christ if any man has crossed over he is a new creature now he's in the promised land old things are passed away behold all things have become new now that should be very important for every one of us and and not thinking that that meant I that meant when I was smoking that meant when I I got rid of my drugs that meant when I got rid of my liquor that meant when I used to have long hair that meant when I used to listen to rock and roll music that no that means everything all things amen he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things have become new and all things are of God when I read that I think you know what I've got a ways to go I look at that and I say the right just scarcely make it all right all things are of God who have reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ they have given us the Ministry of reconciliation well since the foolish virgins never get totally reconciled they don't have a burden to reconcile others so they're not reaching out they don't believe in that ministry they believe it's for somebody else but the wise virgin who totally get reconciled to God they now Christ inside of him has the same burden and is reaching up others do you see how beautiful that is amen verse 19 to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself not imputing their trespasses on them and had committed unto us the word of reconciliation God committed the ministry on to them on to the foolish virgin but they rejected the fullness of the atonement now they may be interested in trying to get people to their church but if their church is just about numbers or entertainment or enjoyment you're really not getting somebody to a nature change now then we are ambassadors not for sun the light for God's light for Christ as though God did beseech you by us we pray you in Christ's stead be reconciled to God now that should be the spirit inside of every one of us when we talk to others we want others to be reconciled to Christ Hebrews 4 verse 1 let us labor let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us we could miss part of the Tollman Saints I mean how many times has the devil preached this sermon to those in the message as long as you're in the message you're okay as long as you believe that God sent a prophet you know it is you believe you're okay the instructions that Paul has given us is we need to fear I could be missing something there should there could be a part of the Holy Ghost that I need that I'm missing a promise a promise amen Hebrews 4 verse 9 there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God a rest for he that has entered into his rest for he that has entered into his rest he also ceased from his own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall for the same example of unbelief when you enter into the true Holy Ghost you're not trying to live the life its Christ living in you so we need to understand that there is still a rest who's it for the people of God that's who it's for so we need to keep growing keep adding to your walk more Holy Ghost amen because there remains more Holy Ghost to the people of God now brother Branham taught us that the rest is the word his word now that's what he talks entering into the word the word is our rest but it's not the knowledge of the word it's the spirit of the word right because the knowledge the letter killeth knowledge puffeth up so it has nothing to do up here with the knowledge and the letter it has to do with the spirit that edifies that brings a and edification to the situation and that that the Spirit is the Holy Ghost and that's what we need we need more Holy Ghost brother Brennan said in questions and answers when they the question was as please explain fully about the Gentiles that don't go in the rapture but the band said see the Gentile bride is in heaven the sleeping virgin the Gentile virgin is not to be saved during that time she's already been saved I read this cult but has been rejected in the bride doesn't it isn't that terrible she's been saved but she's been rejected into the bride that's just sad to me it's it's sad but but somebody's got to make the call I mean when everybody goes enlist in the army everybody doesn't become the general if something's going to make the call and God makes the call who's the bride and and it's not good enough that we've just accepted Christ as their Savior that relationship has got to grow into a love affair and be looking expecting Oh Lord what would you have me to do amen and she only goes speaking of the foolish version now and she only goes through the tribulation period for the time of purification because she has rejected Christ the word for her purification this is such a powerful quote she only goes through the tribulation period for the time of purification so that's why she's she she never purified herself and God requires the purification so she has to go to tribulation now she the Bible says she rejected Christ the word for a purification but she Risa remember she accepted Calvary she accepted Christ as her Savior but she also rejected part of the word so it's important that we don't forget some of the word we don't say that parts not that important or I don't have to worry about that the bride takes the word amen okay back to the quote and then she has to suffer for her deeds what deeds she she accepted Calvary she's saved but now she has to suffer for her knees what deeds for not taking the fall Tolman God expects us to take the fall told me but the bride who has become the word which we're going to try to get into in part for the bride who has become the word a complete atonement was made of Christ what does that mean because he is the word the body was rendered and when the body was rendered the bride was in that body because as all the word so when when when Jesus was on the cross and he was crucified when he paid that the debt we were right inside of him for the judgment so he paid for our our suffering he paid for all of our sin there is always we have to do now is obey every word come under subjection to the word become the word and that requires purifying herself it's hard to become the word when you when you're not living the word in order for me to start living that word it's going to have to crucify my flesh so now I got to purify myself to get to that point of living the word in that area brother brother Larry just forgive me here because this is about me but I thought of you when I'm saying it but I just wanted Bree remember when I had long hair and I did not want to cut it because I didn't want to look old fogey you know like my daddy I wanted to be cool and I want to lose that so you know come to church and learning about you know this is the way you know Christian has to be there was that that point of a wrastling I had to suffer I had to give up my will because my will was to have it now I had to give that up you know it wasn't like you know Shara was gonna like me more you know she first saw me with the long hair I don't know what she felt about it but I think that you know it was because the long hair she liked me so you see no matter what we got going in our life we're gonna have to suffer to get rid of it and and the foolish virgin didn't want to do that they were I accepted Christ as my savior he died for me that settles it they don't need to talk about anything else though though the wise virgin or the bride they know they have to be just like him when he appears so they I would be interested in everything that God is interested in beautiful now remember at the beginning of the series before we started one of the points that we were going to look at was both the bride and the church have to be purified I made that statement the bride will force herself through free more agency to purify herself before the rapture while the church neglects to force herself to free more agency just I don't want to to purify herself she is forced to purify yourself to tribulation I know that's what the Prophet said she has to go through tribulation for purification and it's against her will but she can just say I'm not gonna do it right so it's it's better to be willing to work on it now either way we got it we got a purify yourself but there's just no no ands ifs abouts about it the devil he tries telling me all the time you don't have to do this that you you got your you're good enough you're there you're close you're close enough you'll get the rest at the end whatever he says that they're just all lies there's so many things that God hasn't even told me that I need to do yet if I can't take care of the ones he told me why is he gonna trust me with others so this is this is important that we work and purifying ourselves amen they asked please explain because you said that there would be a small number going to the rapture both of em said that is these on earth that's going to be changed small group that's going on the rapture he said this is the group that's on the earth it's a small group that's on the earth he said Strait is the gate and narrow is the way and few be that find him that's where we're at that is us amen he's God but these who accept the word in its fullness the words already been judged and where this is what we're going to get on Calvary questions and answers 157 brother and says no could a righteous judge a man twice for anything if the penalty has been paid could or could judge a righteous judge could he judge somebody two times if the penalties already been paid the first time no if I was in the pollen shop and you come by and said I'm going to redeem him and you went in and paid the price for my Redemption and that's my penalty of being in the pollen ship and you paid my Redemption then how can the pawnbroker claimed me again you went in the pawn shop you bought something you walking out with it you gave them the money how can that pawnbroker say wait come back you still belong to me so he asked the question then how can the pawnbroker claim me again question mark he said unless I sold out again free more agency free more agency there you are when I rejected the fullness of the word then I go right back into the pawn shop that's what brother Brandon saying so you're doing great you come to church you hear a new word that's not good I don't mean a new word the more of the word is being unveiled let me say that case there might be someone listening for the first time and not understanding about you hear the word its opens up to you and you say I don't think I ought to do that you according to what the Prophet says you could be putting yourself right back in the pawn shop see then he says when I read when I rejected the fullness of the word then they go back to the pawn shop si si then fight my way out then if I can but he redeemed me all right now the righteous judge brother Ram said this and the mighty conquer he said for the righteous judge could not judge the just with the unjust because the believer was already been judged when Christ was judged in his place therefore it would be unjust for a holy God to judge them again after he's already accepted our judgment in Christ isn't that beautiful so Calvary really really paid for our sins all of them in the message the first seal so this is a teaching this is a teaching speaking on those who don't work I'm purifying themselves the brand says so if you speak one thing and think another you better stop that get your thoughts on God keep them pure stay right there with it and speak the same thing all the time see don't say well I'll say it I'll say I'll believe it but I'll go I'll go find out in other words there's a lot of doubt or question there just believe it and say it keep those two in the same if you don't you're opening your door for the door of your mind to be double-minded notice these types notice these types for the RAM said the reason they died out they go through the purging of the trial of the tribulation because they're not actually under the blood and I was talking about the five he's talking about the five unwise virgins don't wise virgins here they've claimed Calvary they've accepted Christ as their Savior but brother Branham says they're actually not under the blood Brooke brother John you've got to give you scripture for that one I'm gonna give you scripture for that right now it just came to me let's go to first John okay so sorry verse number seven first John chapter one verse number seven but if we walk in the light as he is in the light so he shows us more light and we walk in it we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin so if we don't walk in that light as the Prophet said we're actually not under the blood all right going back to the quote now they claim they are but they're not how can they go through a trial to purify them when they're when there is when there is when the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ takes every symptom of sin and stuff away from you now this is a subject in itself but the more of the Holy Ghost which is the blood of Christ the life of Christ's blood the Holy Ghost the more of it that we receive the less of us we have and it's a process and we're all somewhere in that process and it's just the more that you hunger for God the safer you're going to be he says and you're already dead and your life is hid in him through God and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost what are you going to be judged for right who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect right what are you going to be judged for where you're going to get your purification what do you have to be purified from when you're perfectly in Christ sinless what's the judgment for but it's the sleeping punch them that the people can't make out there's we are in the rapture right now we're in the process of the rapture we are in the process of purifying ourselves why because there's a hope in us that we want to be just like him when he comes we want to be ready for the rapture so the way that we purify ourselves is word write the word washes us so we hunger for the word the word comes and we don't come to church to hear a word that we already agree with we come to church to hear the word that we might become more like him amen that we might be challenged and we might find out where at and where he wants us to be no they haven't done it for years you see but this is the hour of Revelation see being revealed just at the coming of the bride the last why do you not the last things that are coming it's coming to an end friends I believe when I don't know I can't tell you but I want to live tonight like it's like if it was tonight I'd be ready see he might come tonight yet he might not come for 20 years I don't know when he'll come so we can see that the wise virgins are purifying themselves right now it's a process that's happening and it's between them and Christ it's a personal affair it's not an outward thing I mean you will people will eventually see it I mean a good example brother Larry we seen brother Larry a while now with long hair and gods working on the inside of him right it was a personal thing and nobody nobody that I know of brother I know nobody that talked to you about it so it was it was a it was a personal thing between the Holy Ghost of him and eventually you were getting in a part for right here and eventually it materializes and it becomes manifested we're out where everybody sees but the working of purification happens in our heart between us and God it's about the heart no man knows the heart now the foolish virgins they think that God's love that God loves them just as much as the wise virgin and they don't have to worry about anything it's a very kernel view because God does love us the same but that doesn't mean he's gonna choose us the same many are called many are loved but fewer chosen it's really important for us to make sure we know what God expects of us amen the foolish version they still have to be purified they still have to go through tribulation God requires a purification to get into heaven we're going to be going through some some scriptures here if we have some time behold what manner of love the father have bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knows us not because it knew him not the love of Christ constrains us or forces us to deal with things in our life that are not pleasing to God because God's commandments are not Grievous we don't have to do it because the old this is what the somebody told me or this is what the church says or this is what you know if I don't do this no God loves a cheerful Giver it has to be of the heart so it's the love of God that constrains us to deal with these things as he speaks to us the Holy Ghost is it rebukes us it reproves us and this is the way that God leads and guides us into all truth imagine for a moment all we had to do was sit and watch somebody tell us the news well we got out there we don't know what kind of news were listening to listen to news right we don't know if it's a fake news the real news we just right now you came and watch anything in that perfect confidence that what you're hearing is the Sabbath or you just can't so you're constantly having to think decide for yourself or have your own opinion you know what it is but imagine that we just come to church and always we had to do was just agree with what's right no change no suffering just identify what's right well that would be easy there'd be no suffering there'd be no purification it would just be knowledge but the Holy Ghost talks to us about her life the Holy Ghost teaches the bride and the bride says not my will but thy will be done the bride loves God so much as she forces herself to deny her own will as brother Stafford wrote in 1873 though Satan should buff it though trials should come when sorrows like sea billows roll whatever my lot thou has taught me to say it is well it is well with my soul the Holy Ghost is teaching us now I'm telling you that that person suffered greatly lost greatly didn't it doesn't seem fair in my eyes but who can question God but thou has taught me to say when Jesus in the garden was taught to say not not real father time be done his will was let this thing pass for me what this suffering passed for me love is the center theme love has been bestowed upon us by God that we should be called the sons of God shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost love constrains us to change to want to change we can see the wise virgins are purifying themselves take a look at Esther when Vashti was rejected as a queen just like the Jews were rejected that's when he turned towards the Gentiles right so Esther was one of the people one of the people that were up for grabs there were many virgins and they all had their idea of how to get ready so good that the King would choose them but the Bible teaches us that Esther only took what the Chamberlain's gave her to do were the others added in their own thoughts because they were trying to get the upper hand well our Chamberlain praised God God sent us a prophet made it real clear what God requires of the bride and if you just take that don't be questioning doubting don't be trying to figure it out yourself and I'll tell you it's it's real clear that the message that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever in you that's what our goal is is to have to live the same life that Christ lived now in in reality none of us here are doing it perfectly none of us so what difference doesn't matter if brother Ben is doing it 1% more than I am what what good does it do if I'm doing it 2% more than brother mark if I'm still not living everything that maysa in the same vault pressing towards the same perfection it's only human nature to be comparing ourselves with one another to try to get some personal gratification about where we're standing but to God he's not looking at that he's looking at what he's giving you too much is given much is required and and and as long as you're steering that somebody else's fault weakness problem you know what that does it keeps you from doing what God wants you to do because you keep feeling justified because you don't got that problem that Bob's got Bob's back on the stand we have no box here Esther didn't deviate from the instructions given to her what an example for the bride amen this is our time for purification I want to go through some scriptures now I know I don't got much time we can go through the scriptures brothers down what do you been doing what's good I thought you were going through the scriptures hebrews chapter 12 verse 14 it's our time to get ready stay ready hebrews 12:14 follow peace with your best friends whoa it's a wrong Bible one book I should say follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord God requires purification Matthew chapter 5 verse 8 blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God pure in heart doesn't mean sincere you be sincerely wrong purification we're going he that has this hope purifies himself yeah in order for me to purify myself I actually have to look at myself and admit I got an issue and deal with it and if I look at Bob you know Bob's got a lot of problems I feel when I look at Bob I say Bob is there anything I can do to help you and I help Bob I sorry and I'm moving around just haven't removed the camera I can walk away feeling good because I help Bob but I'm not doing anything to purify myself we need to look into ourselves be honest with ourselves and it's hard it's hard the bride is the only one that's willing to keep doing and keep doing it and keep doing it until they get to a place where God says I'm picking her and I'm picking him and I'm picking her that's it he picking me because my name is gentleman he is not picking me because I'm up here preaching or on the pastor he is not taking me because of that and he's not picking you cuz you're sitting there we're in the same boat I hope I'm provoking to good works here all right first Thessalonians 4:7 first Thessalonians 4:7 for God have not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness the call we're not born in holiness our nature our carnal nature is not holy so he's calling us unto a different nature oh hi for me to say I'm there would be like saying I'm perfect I mean how many thoughts do we get brother Brent says we back in the 60s used to he said that we backslide hundred times a day that's not holy what about our behavior our not just our thinking our behavior the words that we say the attitude that we have the be the the raff the anger the the backbiting the talking see these are not holy things are you with me I'm not just talking about sex that's one little thing there's so many other things alright Hebrews chapter 12 verse number 10 for they verily for a few days chasing us after their own pleasure o brother mark him doesn't mark and I were talking about this scripture yesterday it wasn't even in my notes but he at that time but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness so God chastens us corrects us that we might partake of his holiness so of course who wants to suffer who wants to be correct to chasten nobody enjoys that I don't want to I don't want to be told I'm doing wrong but I need it in order to partake more of his holiness that might be a better way of saying it instead of just being satisfied with what holiness I have to be concerned about the part that I don't have praise the Lord Romans chapter 6 verse 22 but now being made free from sin and become servants to God you have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life fruit unto holiness boy tell you with TV with all the junk this is hard Saints we got to press in we I'll say that let's do this pray one for another I think if we spent time you know there are things that maybe we struggle with in our life that others are struggling with the same afflictions are accomplished in our brother and around the world by praying for one another you're fulfilling the law of Christ first of all it touches the heart of God and then he gives you grace for your situation sometimes we're we're struggling with our situation or we're being very selfish about praying for one another caring about one another if we just spent time which we all can't do pray one for another God can come and help us with our need all right Ephesians just a few more scriptures here fishin's 4:24 after that ye put on and that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness so this is what we're doing we're purifying herself we're putting on the new man I'm not there yet Amen I'm I'm still putting him on praise God I'm pressing to be the man you know he's you know when they come to a brother branham they say to brother BAM you're such a great man of God and they're saying a bunch of things and put a pen and say and I would have to live a pretty high life to tiful to do what you're saying and I I just I just you know we we look better in one another's eyes we look better in one another's eyes but when we look in the mirror we're really in who we are and so I just say let's put on the new man let's think about putting the new man on some more no matter how much of the new man you got to get some more new man there's as much of Holy Ghost for us as we're willing to want second Corinthians chapter 7 verse 1 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and the spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of God even after Esther was chosen after she had a revelation she was the queen she still came before her husband with reverence and fear if it be pleasing in your sight the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom to work out your salvation with fear and trembling - Satan wants us to you know not reverence enough we're look I look at what has happened through this coal but this thing it has caused a lesser respect people have lost their respect and I don't know if you can you can see it but I can see it alright last scriptures here first Thessalonians chapter 3 verse 12 two verses here first the Thessalonians chapter 3 verse 12 and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another that's beautiful and not just towards one another and toward all men even as we do toward you to the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God even our father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints isn't that beautiful the dead in Christ are going to rise first right then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together amen and this is the state that we need to be in
