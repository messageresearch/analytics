[0:45] All things are possible.
[0:50] Lord, I
[0:52] believe.
[0:55] Amen. Amen. God bless you, brother.
[1:01] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:12] You'll turn with me this evening to the
[1:15] book of Zechariah.
[1:18] Amen.
[1:21] Zechariah chapter 4.
[1:29] It's just before Malachi
[1:31] in the Old Testament.
[1:35] Amen.
[1:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:50] So, because it was kind of hot, I said,
[1:51] "Oh, I'm a suit coat preacher." But I
[1:54] said, "Tonight, I won't wear a suit
[1:56] coat." But
[1:59] Zechariah 4, starting with verse one.
[2:03] And the angel that talked with me came
[2:05] again and wake me as a man that is
[2:08] wakened out of his sleep. And he said
[2:10] unto me, "What seeest thou?" And I said,
[2:12] 'I have looked, and behold, a
[2:14] candlestick all of gold, with a bowl
[2:16] upon the top of it, and his seven lamps
[2:19] thereon, and seven pipes to the seven
[2:22] lamps, which were on the top thereof,
[2:24] and two olive trees by it, one upon the
[2:27] right side of the bowl, and the other
[2:29] upon the left side thereof. So I
[2:31] answered, and spank to the angel that
[2:33] talked with me, saying, What are these,
[2:35] my lord?
[2:37] Then the angel that talked with me
[2:39] answered and said unto me, Knowest thou
[2:41] not what these be? And I said, 'No, my
[2:44] Lord. Then he answered and spake unto
[2:46] me, saying, This is the word of the Lord
[2:48] unto Zerubbable, saying, Not by might,
[2:51] nor by power, but by my spirit, saith
[2:54] the Lord of hosts. Who art thou, oh
[2:57] great mountain, before Zerubbable, thou
[3:00] shalt become a plain? and he shall bring
[3:02] forth the headstone thereof with
[3:04] shoutings, crying grace, grace unto it.
[3:09] Amen. Let's bow our heads for a word of
[3:11] prayer. Dear Lord Jesus, heavenly
[3:15] father, we're thankful, Lord, that we
[3:18] can gather together,
[3:20] Lord, under the shadow of your wings, in
[3:22] your presence. And Lord, we've sung the
[3:25] songs of Zion. And we just invite you,
[3:28] Lord, that you'll come by this way.
[3:30] you'll break the bread of life with us,
[3:32] Lord. That you'll speak to our hearts.
[3:34] You'll send encouragement, Lord, and
[3:36] strength. Heavenly Father, may you just
[3:39] be our honored guest. Take us out of the
[3:42] way, Lord, and may you just walk amongst
[3:45] us. Speak to us, Lord. In Jesus Christ's
[3:48] name we ask it. Amen. Amen. You may be
[3:51] seated.
[3:52] So, I'd like to speak for a little while
[3:54] tonight on the message of grace.
[3:59] Amen.
[4:00] So we see here in verse 7 it says who
[4:02] art thou oh great mountain before
[4:05] Zerubbable thou shall become a plain and
[4:07] he shall bring forth a headstone thereof
[4:10] with shoutings crying grace grace unto
[4:13] it. So who is this Zerubbable?
[4:16] Amen. So if you turn back
[4:20] uh to the book of Ezra and Ezra is
[4:24] situated it's it's a small book but it's
[4:27] right after 2 Chronicles before Nehemiah
[4:31] and in Zechariah or in Ezra chapter 2
[4:35] verse one it says now these are the
[4:37] children of the province that went up
[4:39] out of the captivity of those which had
[4:42] been carried away whom Nebuchadnezzar
[4:44] the king of Babylon had carried away
[4:46] unto Babylon.
[4:48] and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah,
[4:50] even one unto his city, which came with
[4:54] Zerubbabable, Yeshua, Nehemiah, Sariah,
[4:59] Riiah, Mori,
[5:02] Bilshan, Mispar, Bva, Ream, and Ba, the
[5:07] number of the men of the people of
[5:09] Israel. So, we know the name. The name
[5:12] of Zerubbabible means a descendant of
[5:15] Babylon that was born there, but he was
[5:18] an Israelite. And this is interesting to
[5:20] know because Zerubbabible had the
[5:24] bloodline of an Israelite, but yet he
[5:27] was born in Babylon. And we find out
[5:30] that when when they came back in the
[5:32] book of Ezra, that they came at the end
[5:35] of the 70-year captivity that Jeremiah
[5:38] talked about. Israel had lost its way
[5:42] and God had sent judgment upon them and
[5:44] the people were so blind they they they
[5:48] wouldn't even listen to Jeremiah.
[5:49] Jeremiah he told them what was going to
[5:52] take place and they they they wouldn't
[5:54] listen to it and and every but he he
[5:56] bought a plot of land. He bought some uh
[5:59] a title deed and he put it in an earthn
[6:01] vessel and he buried it in the ground
[6:02] and he said in 70 years he said you will
[6:05] come back to this place and when you
[6:08] come back to this place after God has
[6:11] judged you when you come back to this
[6:14] place God will do a great mighty work.
[6:17] Amen. So it says here in Ezra, Ezra was
[6:20] the priest. He says, "So these are the
[6:22] children of the province that went out
[6:24] of captivity of those which had been
[6:27] carried away whom Nebuchadnezzar the
[6:29] king of Babylon had carried away under
[6:31] Babylon. And they came again under
[6:33] Jerusalem and Judah where everyone went
[6:36] into a city. And Jerusalem and the walls
[6:38] were destroyed. The temple was laid
[6:41] waste. The gold, the silver, all the
[6:43] glory of the former things had all been
[6:46] taken away. But God spoke to to
[6:49] Zerubbabel in Zachchariah and he told
[6:52] him, "Not by might, not by power, but by
[6:55] my spirit, Zerubbabable, this mountain,
[6:58] this this test that's coming before
[7:00] you," he said, "it'll be nothing because
[7:02] I will do the work." Amen.
[7:06] So when we look at Ezra then in chapter
[7:09] 3 it says and when the seventh month was
[7:12] come and the children of Israel were in
[7:14] the cities the people gathered
[7:16] themselves together as one man in
[7:18] Jerusalem. Then stood up Jeshua the son
[7:21] of Zodc and his brethren the priests and
[7:24] Zerubbabel the son of Chhatil and his
[7:27] brethren.
[7:30] and they built the altar of God of
[7:32] Israel to offer burnt offerings there on
[7:35] as it was written in the law of Moses,
[7:37] the man of God. So, if they're going to
[7:39] make their way back to God, they first
[7:42] thing they've got to do is they've got
[7:44] to restore their fellowship with God.
[7:47] for 70 years they have not worshiped God
[7:50] according they they looked at at
[7:52] Jeremiah's prophecies and Daniel was
[7:54] down there in and um the gentile kingdom
[7:58] of Nebuchadnezzar they were down in
[8:00] Babylon and the only person that they
[8:02] could look to was Daniel and what Daniel
[8:04] said but they had lost all fellowship
[8:06] with God they so the very first thing
[8:09] they had to do when they came back to
[8:11] Israel at the end of the 70 years is
[8:14] that they had to re-establish that
[8:16] fellowship with the Lord Lord. So the
[8:18] first thing they had to do is they had
[8:20] to build an altar. So they built an
[8:22] altar to offer a burnt offering as it is
[8:25] written in the law of Moses, the man of
[8:27] God. And they set the altar upon its
[8:29] basis for fear was upon them because of
[8:32] the people of those countries. So
[8:35] everybody that had settled in Jerusalem
[8:38] and in Judea and around in those areas
[8:41] while they were gone for seven years
[8:43] were a bunch of heathens.
[8:46] And they were dead against they they
[8:49] came against uh Zerubbabel. They came
[8:51] against Nehemiah. They came against
[8:53] Ezra. They came they said this is a
[8:56] wicked city. And they wrote to
[8:58] Nebuchadnezzar to Cyrus the king and
[9:00] said don't let these people come back
[9:02] here because this is a bad thing that
[9:04] they're about to do because if they
[9:07] reestablish their fellowship with God,
[9:10] God will have mercy on them. Amen.
[9:14] Amen. And they set the altar upon its
[9:17] basis, for fear was upon them, because
[9:19] of the people of those countries. And
[9:21] they offered burnt offerings thereon
[9:23] unto the Lord, even burnt offerings,
[9:25] morning and evenings. And they kept also
[9:28] the feast of tabernacles, as it is
[9:30] written, and offered the daily burnt
[9:32] offerings by numbers, according to the
[9:34] custom, as the duty of every day
[9:37] required. Amen. So that is who
[9:40] Zerubbable is. So we want to go back to
[9:43] Zachchariah.
[9:45] We want to look. So we know that
[9:47] Zerubbabible was an is Israelite
[9:51] and you know the Jew the Jew is very
[9:54] conscious of his tribe and his
[9:57] bloodline. It's very important to him
[9:59] because that's his only concrete
[10:02] evidence that he can trace himself back
[10:05] to Abraham.
[10:07] So it's through the bloodline. So it's
[10:09] very important that this character, this
[10:13] person was called Zerubbable
[10:16] because it means he was a descendant of
[10:19] Babylon that was born in Babylon yet an
[10:24] Israelite.
[10:25] Amen.
[10:27] Amen.
[10:29] So we find out here in Zechariah 4
[10:31] starting with verse 6.
[10:33] So this angel came to Zachchariah and
[10:37] Zachchariah of course was a prophet. It
[10:39] says, "And the angel talked with me. He
[10:41] answered and he asked him." He said,
[10:43] "You see this this golden candlestick?
[10:45] You see these olive trees?" He says,
[10:47] "You see these things?" And and he says,
[10:49] "Do you know what these are?" And
[10:50] Zachchariah said, "No, I don't know what
[10:52] they are." In verse six, he says, "So he
[10:55] answered, the angel spake unto me,
[10:57] saying, this is the word of the Lord
[11:00] unto Zerubbable, saying, not by might
[11:04] nor by power, but by my spirit, saith
[11:07] the Lord of hosts. Who art thou, oh
[11:09] great mountain, who are you in the face
[11:13] of God?"
[11:15] all this adversary, everything that's
[11:17] pushing against the refellish the
[11:19] fellowship between the Jew and their
[11:22] heavenly father, even though it seems
[11:25] like a great big mountain that can stop
[11:28] you and and cause you such discourse and
[11:31] everything else. He said, "This will be
[11:33] nothing because I'm going to do it."
[11:37] Amen.
[11:38] He said, "Who art thou, oh great
[11:40] mountain, before Zerubbable, thou shalt
[11:42] become a plain, and he shall bring forth
[11:45] a headstone thereof with shoutings,
[11:48] crying, grace, grace unto it." Moreover,
[11:51] the word of the Lord came unto me,
[11:53] saying, "And the hands of Zerubbable
[11:55] have laid the foundation of this house."
[11:58] So, we see that we we read that in Ezra
[12:01] 3 that they laid the foundations.
[12:04] as rubbable laid the foundations of his
[12:07] house, and his hands shall also finish
[12:09] it. And thou shalt know that the Lord of
[12:12] hosts has sent me unto you. And who hast
[12:15] despised the day of small things? For
[12:18] they shall rejoice and shall see the
[12:20] plummet in the hand of Zerubbable with
[12:23] the seven which are the eyes of the
[12:25] Lord, which run to and fro through the
[12:27] whole earth. Amen. We're all well
[12:30] acquainted with these scriptures that
[12:32] read the Bible. And we know that this
[12:33] was during the time of the preparation
[12:35] of the restoration of the temple. And
[12:38] Zerubbabible was a great prince amongst
[12:40] the people. He laid the foundation of
[12:42] the building. Now, if you want to put
[12:44] down your spiritual thinking, I want you
[12:47] to think this morning. This great prince
[12:49] had determined to rebuild the house of
[12:51] the Lord. And then when he did, he laid
[12:54] the foundation stone. And as we read on
[12:58] further, we found out that God said,
[12:59] "Zerubbable not only is going to lay the
[13:02] foundation, but he's going to call, he's
[13:05] going to bring the headstone."
[13:07] This one man is going to lay the
[13:10] foundation, but he's also going to call
[13:11] for the headstone.
[13:13] And I want you to notice, he never said
[13:15] he shall bring forth the cornerstone.
[13:18] He shall bring forth the headstone.
[13:22] Now, every foundation has a corner and
[13:26] every foundation has a cornerstone. If
[13:28] you know a real good stonemason, we used
[13:31] to first live in the first house that we
[13:33] rented. It had a stone foundation and
[13:36] the the mortar was all coming out. The
[13:40] pointing, this is what they call it, was
[13:41] all coming out between the stones
[13:43] because it was made out of lime and a
[13:45] bunch of other things which back in the
[13:47] early 1900s was very common. But it
[13:50] started to fall away. And I had a man
[13:52] come and I said, "Is this house getting
[13:54] ready to fall down?" I says, "Cuz all
[13:56] the pointing, everything's falling out
[13:57] everywhere. The bugs can get in here and
[14:00] everything." And he said, "A good
[14:02] stonemason,
[14:03] if he lays these stones properly on the
[14:06] cornerstone," he said, "you don't need
[14:09] any mortar.
[14:11] You don't need any mortar at all." He
[14:14] says, "It will stand."
[14:16] Praise the Lord. So, we want to look
[14:18] here at Ephesians 2. Amen.
[14:22] Amen.
[14:25] In Ephesians 2 verse 20, it says, "And
[14:28] we are built upon the foundation of the
[14:30] apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
[14:33] himself being the chief cornerstone."
[14:37] Now, when you're building something out
[14:39] in the in the out in a field or you're,
[14:43] you know, you're far away from from
[14:45] normal things, people think, well,
[14:48] geometry,
[14:49] why do I have to take geometry? Geometry
[14:52] doesn't mean anything to me. Why do I
[14:54] have to learn about triangles?
[14:57] Well, okay, kids, pay attention. You're
[14:59] going to learn about geometry.
[15:03] This is a rectangle.
[15:05] And if you measure from this corner to
[15:07] this corner, it is the same from this
[15:09] corner to this corner. Unless it's a
[15:12] rhombus because then it'll be cockeyed.
[15:15] But if you when you build something and
[15:18] you put three corners down,
[15:21] you can find this corner by coming off
[15:24] the cornerstone.
[15:26] The cornerstone is the important part of
[15:29] the foundation.
[15:31] And you can you can measure the diagonal
[15:34] and see how square your building is
[15:36] going to be. When they laid the
[15:38] foundation of my house, my house came in
[15:41] on two trailers and the contractor that
[15:44] was going to pick the house up from the
[15:45] crane and put it on the foundation,
[15:48] measured the diagonals of my foundation,
[15:51] and he said, "This is pretty good."
[15:52] Everybody says it's only a quarter of an
[15:54] inch off
[15:56] a 40 foot long by 20 foot wide quarter
[16:00] of an inch difference in the diagonals.
[16:04] Zerubbable will lay the foundation.
[16:08] Jesus Christ being the saint, the the
[16:11] chief cornerstone,
[16:13] in whom all the building is fitly framed
[16:17] together, groweth unto the holy temple
[16:21] unto the Lord, of whom ye also are built
[16:24] together for a habitation of God through
[16:28] the spirit.
[16:30] We have to know our cornerstone and we
[16:34] have to know the foundation that we're
[16:36] built on because that cornerstone, that
[16:39] foundation is a habitation of God
[16:43] Almighty. Amen. Amen. First Peter,
[16:48] he talks about this
[16:51] in first Peter chapter 2
[16:53] verse 6. It says, "Wherefore also it is
[16:57] contained in the scripture, behold, I
[16:59] lay in Zion a chief cornerstone,
[17:02] elect,
[17:04] precious, and he that believeth on him
[17:07] shall not be confounded." If you got
[17:09] problems in your life and you don't
[17:11] understand what's going on, you need to
[17:14] get a hold of where the cornerstone is.
[17:16] Amen. Because he's an elect and he's
[17:19] precious. And if you stand on that
[17:22] cornerstone, everything will come into
[17:25] order.
[17:26] Amen. Amen.
[17:29] So he said, he said, "And he that
[17:32] believeth on him shall not be
[17:35] confounded. Unto you therefore which
[17:38] believe, he is precious. But to them
[17:41] which are disobedient, the stone which
[17:44] the builders disallowed, the same is
[17:46] made the head of the corner, and a stone
[17:48] of stumbling, and a rock an offense,
[17:50] even to them which stumble at the word,
[17:53] being disobedient, wherein to also they
[17:56] were appointed. Amen. Amen.
[18:00] So, we know that the scripture says that
[18:02] Jesus is the chief cornerstone, but he's
[18:05] also the headstone. Now if we think of
[18:08] that for a few minutes that the seventh
[18:10] church age messenger to res to to
[18:12] restore the faith of the children back
[18:14] to their fathers. In other words,
[18:17] rebuild the church again under the power
[18:19] of the spirit. Not by power, not by
[18:22] might, but by my spirit sayaith the
[18:24] Lord. Not by organization, not by
[18:26] denomination, but by the Holy Spirit.
[18:29] God will bring forth the church in this
[18:31] last day. And Zerubbabable the prince
[18:35] with Jesua was the one that was to bring
[18:38] forth the headstone. He laid the
[18:41] foundation. He had took the people back
[18:44] to the foundation in type. And we know
[18:47] that these candlesticks and so forth
[18:50] represent both the Jewish and the
[18:52] church. Yes. So when God gave this
[18:55] prophecy to um
[19:00] to Zachchariah and Zachchariah saw these
[19:03] seven golden candlesticks, it was a
[19:05] representation to Zerubbable of what God
[19:08] was going to do in the for the Jews. But
[19:12] we also know that what was done for the
[19:15] Jews was just a shadow and a type of the
[19:19] reality of what God was going to do in
[19:22] the New Testament. Amen. Amen.
[19:26] So we know these candlesticks and so
[19:28] forth represent both Jew and church.
[19:31] They were the olive branches. The Bible
[19:33] said here in the olive branch, we are
[19:35] the wild branch that was grafted into
[19:37] the root of the tamed olive tree. And
[19:40] out of these two branches come forth
[19:41] sensor pipes going into the golden
[19:43] candlesticks. Now according to this
[19:45] prophecy, there is going to come a
[19:48] headstone. And I want you to notice that
[19:50] when the headstone comes, the prince
[19:53] that's going to cry out the message will
[19:56] cry out, "Grace! Grace!"
[19:59] Amen. That's what he's going to cry out.
[20:03] Amen.
[20:05] Praise the Lord. For it's by grace we
[20:08] are saved, not of works, lest any man
[20:11] should boast. And the message of grace,
[20:14] it's been trampled under the feet of men
[20:16] until it's become a disgrace. Some of
[20:18] them runs out into eternal security.
[20:20] Some of them run into anything. But the
[20:22] true message of grace remains the same.
[20:26] And that's where Satan tries to knock it
[20:28] out so that the church doesn't
[20:30] understand grace.
[20:33] They take grace to say, "Well, I found
[20:35] the grace of God. Now I can do anything
[20:37] I want." Well, that's not the grace of
[20:40] God. Amen.
[20:42] Grace is old. Grace is old as the world
[20:46] is.
[20:47] Grace was first shown to the human race
[20:49] when we had a beginning of the human
[20:51] race. When the human race was first
[20:54] created in the Garden of Eden on that
[20:56] dark morning when that little woman
[20:58] stepped across the separating line, she
[21:00] had gone against God's commandments and
[21:02] enticed her husband to do the same
[21:04] thing. Then the law was broken and the
[21:07] law must have a penalty or it is no law.
[21:10] And the law was the day that you eat
[21:12] thereof, that day you surely die.
[21:16] So I want you to look at Genesis 3.
[21:20] Amen.
[21:29] Genesis 3 and:e 6 it says, "And when the
[21:31] woman saw that the tree was good for
[21:33] food, and that it was pleasant to the
[21:36] eyes, and a tree to be desired to make
[21:38] one wise, she took of the fruit thereof,
[21:40] and she did eat, and gave also unto her
[21:43] husband with her, and he did eat." And
[21:45] the eyes of them both were opened and
[21:48] they knew that they were naked and they
[21:50] sewed fig tree leaves together and made
[21:53] themselves aprons. I want you to think
[21:56] about this
[21:58] here. It says the woman came to Adam and
[22:01] she told him what she had done. But we
[22:04] find out over in Timothy
[22:07] that the Bible says the woman was in the
[22:09] transgression. But Adam knew what he was
[22:11] doing.
[22:13] He knew what he was doing because she
[22:15] was flesh of his flesh.
[22:18] She was she was a part of him. And he
[22:21] knew that God's law could not be broken.
[22:25] He knew that when she broke that
[22:28] something was going to die.
[22:31] And he said, "If God's going to kill
[22:33] her, I'm he's going to have to take me
[22:35] with him."
[22:38] And he took his eyes. Brother Brandon at
[22:41] different places said his eyes were wide
[22:43] open. He stepped across that line
[22:46] knowing that it was going to cause him
[22:49] death. Amen. Knowing that
[22:54] and when he got there then then he then
[22:56] he was in a real pickle because he knew
[22:59] that he had transgressed God's law. And
[23:02] at that point in time he did not know
[23:07] what is an atonement.
[23:10] How do I fix this?
[23:13] How do I go back? How do I recreate the
[23:16] fellowship that I had with God?
[23:19] Zerubbable and them when they came back
[23:21] to Jerusalem and they saw the holy city
[23:23] and destroyed and the walls knocked
[23:25] down, they wept because they said, "How
[23:28] will a holy God ever accept us back into
[23:31] fellowship?"
[23:32] Amen.
[23:34] Amen.
[23:36] And they made themselves aprons. And
[23:38] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[23:40] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[23:42] day.
[23:43] And Adam and his wife hid themselves
[23:47] from the presence of the Lord amongst
[23:49] the trees of the garden. And man will
[23:52] always do that. When he comes in contact
[23:55] with the word, when he comes in contact
[23:57] with a holy God, the very first thing
[24:00] he's doing, I'm undone. And he'll go and
[24:03] hide. He'll run away.
[24:07] He doesn't run to this to the place of
[24:10] safety. He runs away.
[24:13] And Adam and Eve, they they ran away.
[24:16] And God called unto them unto Adam, and
[24:19] he said unto him, "Where art thou?" And
[24:21] he said, 'I heard thy voice in the
[24:23] garden, and I was afraid
[24:29] because your law had been broken, and I
[24:33] knew you were righteous,
[24:36] and I knew that you would keep your
[24:38] word,
[24:39] and I knew we were undone.
[24:43] Remember, the first judgment seat was
[24:45] upon the earth. It was in the Garden of
[24:47] Eden. and the last judgment seat will be
[24:50] upon the earth at the end of time in the
[24:52] white throne. But when Jehovah come
[24:54] down, I couldn't imagine that there
[24:57] wasn't even a star to shine. It was so
[24:59] dark in that light little garden that
[25:02] once was because sin had blotted it out,
[25:05] had taken the light from out from among
[25:07] them. And how it was a terrible that
[25:09] morning.
[25:11] Darkness hanging in the garden. I
[25:14] imagine fog of black sackloths. I
[25:16] imagine every leaf never even moved.
[25:20] There was no wind moving. It was
[25:22] darkness and terrible because sin had
[25:25] blatted it out. And there come Jehovah
[25:28] down like a roar of thunder walking
[25:29] through the gardens crying, "Adam, where
[25:31] art thou?" And that's when Adam realized
[25:34] he was naked and he had sinned before
[25:36] God. And he hid himself and he tried to
[25:38] make himself a religion, but it didn't
[25:41] work. God killed some sheep. He took the
[25:44] skins and showed that something has to
[25:46] die to cover sin. And there in the
[25:49] garden that morning when sin was so
[25:52] black, Jehovah come in and there stood
[25:55] his couple standing there condemned.
[25:59] What parent this morning?
[26:02] If you found your child was going to get
[26:06] killed, was going to get the electric
[26:09] chair or take an injection or something
[26:12] and was going to die. What parent would
[26:15] stand by and let that happen if they
[26:17] could jump in the way? Jump in the way
[26:20] of that bullet. Jump in the way. Say,
[26:22] "Don't don't take him. Take me." And God
[26:25] was perplexed. It was darkness.
[26:29] And God's his word had manifested before
[26:33] him and made Adam.
[26:36] Adam was his word, his offspring,
[26:41] his only son.
[26:44] And he had transgressed his law. And he
[26:47] knew,
[26:50] well, if I kill Eve,
[26:54] then Adam will then I've got to kill
[26:57] Adam.
[26:59] Brother Random said he said
[27:01] he said there they were. He said there'd
[27:04] be no more human race. They had to die.
[27:08] Death in the human race. Give the world
[27:10] back to wild animals. There'd be no
[27:12] human race. But in that darkest of hour,
[27:16] in that time when all hopes was gone,
[27:20] grace stepped in the gap.
[27:24] Not mercy, grace.
[27:28] grace stepped in. Amen.
[27:32] Amen.
[27:34] I'll give you a savior, a Messiah. He
[27:36] gave them a way out.
[27:39] When he looked at them, he said, he
[27:41] said, he asked him, he said, "What what
[27:44] have you done, Adam?"
[27:49] He says, "It's a wonder how God could
[27:51] ever do it."
[27:53] God's amazing grace in the Garden of
[27:56] Eden that gave them the promise of a
[27:58] just one who would come through the
[28:00] woman. The woman's seed shall brew the
[28:02] serpent head, the guilty one, his head
[28:04] shall bruise her heel to show there
[28:07] being an affliction to the church, but
[28:08] he promised a triumph. What provided the
[28:11] Savior? Grace. What could they show to
[28:14] merit grace?
[28:17] That's something to think about it. What
[28:19] are you going to show God to merit his
[28:21] grace?
[28:24] how good you are.
[28:27] Amen.
[28:30] What could they show the army
[28:32] expression? He says, "I only want to
[28:34] make it from the pulpit here to make a
[28:35] point passing the buck." Adam said,
[28:38] "Well, the woman you gave me, she did
[28:40] it." The woman said, "The serpent
[28:42] begiled me." One laid it on another, and
[28:44] there was no hope for them. But God
[28:46] provided grace. It come breaking
[28:50] through. He said, "But I'll make a way
[28:52] somehow. I I I
[28:56] will save you, Adam. I will save you,
[28:59] Eve. I will do it."
[29:03] Amen.
[29:05] Amen.
[29:08] You've done wrong. You've transgressed
[29:10] my laws. My laws, they have to be. But
[29:12] judgment from my laws will also have to
[29:15] be executed.
[29:16] Therefore, there'll have to be death.
[29:19] because I said death. And it could not
[29:21] be right for God to make an angel die.
[29:24] He could not be the right kind of a
[29:25] judge and make an angel die for a human
[29:27] being. That still doesn't cure it
[29:29] because his great law demands death. And
[29:33] something's got to die. And the angel
[29:35] can't die. Neither could he say, "Eve,
[29:37] because you caused Adam to do this, I'll
[29:39] make you die and let Adam live because
[29:42] Adam was a partaker also." Like someone
[29:45] said, "Pilate was justified. He washed
[29:47] his hands." Well, you can't wash the
[29:48] hands of the blood of Jesus Christ.
[29:51] You'll never leave this building this
[29:52] morning and go to heaven if you die in
[29:54] your sins. It's on your hands. So,
[29:56] you've got to accept God's grace. Amen.
[29:59] There's only one way. There's only one
[30:02] way God's great law demands could be
[30:05] met. And God had to meet it himself. He
[30:08] had to do it. God is a spirit. So, he
[30:11] couldn't die. So, God had to become a
[30:14] man. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. He
[30:18] couldn't do it in the spirit form, but
[30:20] he could do it in the flesh. Amen.
[30:24] Praise God for God's grace. Amen. Grace
[30:27] that was promised in the Garden of Eden
[30:29] and grace came. Grace came to Adam and
[30:32] Eve. Let's go here to Genesis 6. Praise
[30:36] the Lord.
[30:38] In Genesis 6, it says, "And it came to
[30:41] pass when men began to multiply on the
[30:43] face of the earth, and daughters were
[30:45] born unto them that the sons of God saw
[30:49] the daughters of men that they were
[30:50] fair, and they took them wives of all
[30:52] which they chose." The thing about it,
[30:54] Adam and Eve, they got kicked out of the
[30:56] garden and they created, you know, they
[30:59] had Cain and Abel and then Cain, he
[31:02] killed Abel. And then they had Seth and
[31:05] they had other sons and daughters. And
[31:08] the Bible says and
[31:12] Seth Adam's lineage
[31:15] then did they start to call on the name
[31:18] of the Lord and they had fellowship with
[31:21] the invisible God. But there came a time
[31:25] when the population got so big and that
[31:29] the sons of gods started to notice the
[31:33] the women of men, the daughters of men
[31:38] and the sons of God
[31:42] started to take them
[31:44] to be wives.
[31:46] And the Lord said, "My spirit shall not
[31:48] always strive with man, for that he is
[31:50] also flesh, yet his days shall be 120
[31:53] years." And there were giants in the
[31:55] earth in those days. And also after
[31:57] that, when the sons of God came in unto
[32:00] the daughters of men, and they bare
[32:02] children to them, the same became mighty
[32:04] men, which were of old, men of renown.
[32:07] And God saw that the wickedness of man
[32:10] was great on the earth.
[32:14] Amen.
[32:16] In his mouth he wanted to worship God,
[32:19] but in his heart it was far from it.
[32:22] Amen.
[32:24] And the wickedness of man was great in
[32:26] the earth, that every imagination of the
[32:28] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[32:30] continually. And it repented the Lord
[32:33] that he had made man on the earth, and
[32:35] it grieved him in his heart. And the
[32:38] Lord said, 'I will destroy man whom I
[32:40] have created from the face of the earth,
[32:42] both man and beast and creeping thing
[32:44] and the fowls of the air, for it
[32:46] repenteth me that I have made them."
[32:50] Verse eight says, "But Noah found grace
[32:55] in the eyes of the Lord."
[32:59] The grace of God reached over in Noah's
[33:01] time. Noah was just an ordinary man, he
[33:04] and his family. But because Noah feared
[33:07] God, he believed God. You know, you
[33:09] can't you can't believe God you can't
[33:11] fear God without believing. How can you
[33:14] fear something you don't believe in?
[33:18] Yes.
[33:19] You've got to fear God. Solomon said,
[33:22] "The fear of God is the beginning of
[33:23] wisdom." Now, just to fear God, you're
[33:25] beginning to have wisdom. The fear of
[33:27] God, Noah feared the Lord and he
[33:30] believed the Lord. And that's what God
[33:33] honored is your faith in him.
[33:36] And then when the fear of God come upon
[33:38] Noah, God called him by grace and saved
[33:41] him and his house because it was grace
[33:44] that did it.
[33:46] Grace, the grace of God was shown to
[33:49] Noah. And God, remember we read that
[33:52] scripture, it said the foundation is
[33:54] Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the chief
[33:57] cornerstone.
[33:59] And Noah found that cornerstone
[34:02] and he became a house. He became a house
[34:05] that God could dwell in because through
[34:09] the spirit that came down and dwelt in
[34:11] Noah's heart, he was able to manifest
[34:13] God's promise of a deliverance.
[34:18] It wasn't in the heart of man to build a
[34:20] boat.
[34:22] But God came down to Noah and by grace
[34:26] made a way of escape. Praise the Lord.
[34:28] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[34:34] The fear of God came upon Noah and God
[34:36] called him by grace and saved him in his
[34:38] house because of the grace that he did.
[34:41] Not because Noah was some great big
[34:43] handsome man than all the rest of them.
[34:45] Not because Noah went to the best church
[34:47] there was in the country. Not because he
[34:49] belonged to the best organization. Not
[34:51] because he could dress better. Not
[34:52] because he had more money. Not because
[34:54] he was some special person. But because
[34:57] the grace of God,
[35:00] God saved Noah. Grace saved Noah. Not
[35:06] his works,
[35:08] but his grace. And it saved his family.
[35:12] Amen. Amen. Let's look here at Genesis
[35:16] 12. Amen.
[35:20] Genesis 12 verse one. And it says, "Now
[35:22] the Lord had said unto Abram,
[35:25] get thee out of thy country, and from
[35:26] thy kindred, and from thy father's house
[35:29] unto a land that I will show thee, and I
[35:31] will make of thee a great nation, and I
[35:33] will bless thee, and make thy name
[35:35] great, and thou shalt be a blessing. And
[35:38] I will bless them that bless thee, and
[35:40] curse him that cursseeth thee, and in
[35:42] thee all families of the earth will be
[35:44] blessed." So Abram departed, as the Lord
[35:48] had spoken unto him. Amen. We could call
[35:52] another character where God's grace was
[35:55] extended. Many of them, but we'll just
[35:57] speak of a few. Abraham. Abraham was no
[36:00] special person. He come down from the
[36:03] tower of Babel perhaps come out with an
[36:06] idoltor bunch. Come down in the land of
[36:08] Shinar down there. Okay. So, how many
[36:11] how many children how many how many
[36:13] adults do we have here that are children
[36:16] of people that were in brother
[36:17] Brandham's meetings?
[36:21] How many of us were just unbelievers?
[36:28] Just going from Methodists to the
[36:30] Baptists and and going, "Okay, there
[36:33] ain't nothing here."
[36:35] Just going just and Abraham was just
[36:39] like that. Amen.
[36:42] No special man. He come down. He he came
[36:45] out with a dollar bunch. She'd come down
[36:46] in the land of Shiner down there to
[36:48] dwell in the city of Er. And while he
[36:50] was there, God spoke to him by grace.
[36:57] Not because he was different, not
[36:59] because he was better, but by grace God
[37:02] called him. The Bible Bible clearly
[37:06] makes that known. And oh Abraham,
[37:10] how Abraham tested God's patience.
[37:18] I thought that once we found the grace
[37:20] of God,
[37:21] we were on our way to get out of here.
[37:25] But Abraham
[37:27] tested God's patience.
[37:32] You compare that to Noah's day.
[37:35] God saw the wickedness of man and he saw
[37:38] their failure and their frail and their
[37:40] imagination was continually evil and it
[37:43] repented him. But because God had
[37:46] extended grace to Abraham,
[37:49] when Abraham started to fail, God's
[37:52] grace kept him.
[37:59] Abraham Abraham tested God's patience.
[38:03] God told him, he said, "Abraham, you
[38:05] stay in this land. Don't you go out of
[38:07] it." But as soon as the famine come,
[38:10] Abraham ran off.
[38:12] Abraham spoke of us.
[38:17] God took Abraham by grace and saved him.
[38:20] And that's how he takes you, by grace.
[38:23] And how do we test his patience?
[38:28] How do we test his patience?
[38:30] Today we're up, tomorrow we're down.
[38:36] One day we believe, the next day we're
[38:38] wondering.
[38:41] Today we believe in divine healing.
[38:43] Tomorrow the tummy ache comes. We don't
[38:45] know whether he'll believe it or not.
[38:48] But in the midst of all of that,
[38:52] God's grace,
[38:55] he doesn't cast us out. Praise the Lord.
[38:58] Amen.
[39:00] In the midst, God wants us to stay put.
[39:05] He saves us anyhow. If it wasn't through
[39:07] grace of God, we'd all be gone. Amen.
[39:11] Abraham was supposed to stay in that
[39:13] land, but he went down into the Chelans.
[39:15] Not Chelans, but the Philistines. And he
[39:17] went down there to Sjor to get out of
[39:20] the famine. Oh, isn't that what we do?
[39:24] Things start going wrong and we run off.
[39:26] Well, I'm not coming to church no more.
[39:28] I I You don't know, Brother John. I got
[39:30] I got problems. I got things I gota I
[39:33] You know, things just aren't going
[39:34] right. I I This isn't going right. That
[39:36] ain't going right. And I I'm I'll I'll
[39:38] come back when I get everything. Oh, you
[39:41] Abraham.
[39:43] Testing God's patience.
[39:47] Amen.
[39:49] Amen.
[39:51] He says he done exactly, it got a little
[39:55] hard up in this country, so he went down
[39:57] there. There's a journey down there. He
[39:58] done exactly what God told him not to
[40:00] do.
[40:02] But the yet the grace of God appeared to
[40:04] him.
[40:06] Amen. He kept the king from taking
[40:09] Abraham's wife. Abraham lied. Said,
[40:13] "It's my sister." And we sing that song.
[40:15] We talk about how our our thoughts are
[40:18] louder in God's in the kingdom than I uh
[40:22] we're toast.
[40:24] Every one of you is guilty.
[40:27] Me included.
[40:29] We're We're toast except for the grace
[40:34] of God.
[40:35] Amen.
[40:37] Anybody that's willing to repent, the
[40:40] grace of God will go for you. The grace
[40:43] of God is searching for you. And that
[40:46] goes for you backsliders this morning.
[40:48] Grace of God is still looking for you.
[40:50] If you'll just repent, God's grace is
[40:52] sufficient. He took old Abraham and he
[40:55] brought him back. Remember, Abraham was
[40:58] not saved by his works. He was saved by
[41:01] grace. Abraham was saved by faith.
[41:05] which is grace. You can't even have
[41:07] faith without the grace of God.
[41:10] Amen. God saved Abraham because of his
[41:13] grace, not because of his behavior.
[41:17] Praise the Lord. There's hope for me.
[41:22] There's hope for me. Then we got you
[41:25] guys ought to be jumping up and tearing
[41:27] this place apart.
[41:30] Let's go to Romans 4. Look at this. Look
[41:33] at Romans 4.
[41:36] Romans 4:E1 says, "What shall we say
[41:40] then that Abraham our father is
[41:42] pertaining to the flesh hath found? For
[41:46] if Abraham were justified by works,
[41:50] well, he has a reason to glory
[41:54] but not before God."
[41:57] Oh, you know, I do so much for the
[42:00] church. Oh, that's good, brother. I I'm
[42:04] faithful in all the things. I come to
[42:06] all the stuff. That's great.
[42:09] But that doesn't justify you before God.
[42:14] That is just I I'm glad you're faithful.
[42:18] I'm glad you you pay your tithe. I'm I'm
[42:20] glad you try to follow the word of God.
[42:23] I'm I'm happy for you.
[42:27] For if Abraham were justified by works,
[42:30] he hath whereof to glory, but not before
[42:34] God. For what saith the scripture? Now
[42:37] look, this is grace. Pure and simple.
[42:41] Abraham believed God.
[42:44] How many believes God? You right. We all
[42:47] believe God. It's counted to you for
[42:50] righteousness. Are you righteous?
[42:56] Not in my eyes. You aren't.
[42:58] But you don't have to answer to me.
[43:01] See, Abraham, they looked at Abraham the
[43:04] king and everything. They said, "Well,
[43:05] look, the one king, he told God, God
[43:08] came and said, "You're a dead man." He
[43:10] said, "But he lied to me." He said, "I
[43:12] don't care. He's my prophet. That's my
[43:14] elect. Don't you touch them. But they've
[43:18] got they got all kinds of warts and
[43:20] failures." And I heard them and I saw
[43:22] what they did. and that over there that
[43:24] deal they shouldn't have done that and
[43:26] all this other stuff and he says but
[43:28] God's grace
[43:30] praise the Lord. Amen.
[43:33] Amen.
[43:35] We done yet?
[43:37] Let's take Israel. I got a scripture
[43:40] written down here. So he says, brother
[43:42] Brandham says, I write it down so I can
[43:44] just refer to it in my mind. Let's go to
[43:47] Deuteronomy 7.
[43:49] Amen.
[44:00] Deuteronomy 7:7 says, "The Lord did not
[44:04] set his love upon you, nor choose you
[44:07] because you were more in number than any
[44:10] people, for you were the fewest of all
[44:13] the people, but because the Lord loved
[44:16] you, and because he would keep the oath
[44:19] which he had sworn born unto your
[44:22] fathers hath the Lord brought you out
[44:24] with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out
[44:27] of the house of the bondman from the
[44:28] hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Now
[44:31] therefore, that the Lord thy God, he is
[44:35] God.
[44:36] He's the faithful God. Well, thank you.
[44:42] I'm glad.
[44:45] That's a revelation you need to get.
[44:48] God is faithful.
[44:50] He will keep his word.
[44:55] He is the faithful God which keepeth
[44:57] covenant and mercy with them that love
[44:59] him and keep his commandments to a
[45:01] thousand generations.
[45:03] Amen. And repayth them that hate him to
[45:06] their face to destroy them. He will not
[45:08] slack to him that hateth him. He will
[45:10] repay him to his face. Thou shalt
[45:13] therefore keep thy commandments and the
[45:16] statutes and the judgments which I
[45:19] command thee this day to do them. You
[45:22] can't do it.
[45:27] I'd like to.
[45:29] Wouldn't you like to?
[45:35] God gave, he said, he told Israel, he
[45:39] said, "If you'll not associate with
[45:41] idolatry, if you'll do these things, if
[45:44] you'll stay away from all these pagan
[45:45] ceremonies, if you do all these things,
[45:48] then I'll bring you to a good land, I'll
[45:50] take care of you, I'll feed you, I'll
[45:52] lead you, I'll do all these things if
[45:54] you do such and such. If you love me, if
[45:56] you keep my commandments, if you keep my
[45:58] statutes, my ordinance, I'll do all
[46:00] these things if you'll just do something
[46:02] and keep my commandments and love me.
[46:12] Oh, God.
[46:14] It'll take the grace of go of Jehovah to
[46:16] keep his family together. Amen. And
[46:19] that's the only way that we are
[46:20] Jehovah's family today
[46:23] is because the grace of Jesus Christ
[46:27] because we would all be gone.
[46:31] We have a horrible time applying the
[46:34] token.
[46:36] We have a horrible time keeping God's
[46:39] laws.
[46:41] Israel heard all the laws. They were so
[46:44] afraid when God came down on the
[46:46] mountain, they ran away.
[46:48] And they told Moses, they said, "Oh, no.
[46:50] We don't even want to hear from him
[46:52] anymore. You speak, we'll obey."
[46:55] That's what they said. And did they do
[46:57] that? Nope.
[47:00] Did God destroy them in the wilderness?
[47:02] He wanted to,
[47:04] but grace stepped up in Moses
[47:09] and said, "Wait a minute. You are a
[47:12] merciful God. You are a God that has
[47:15] grace.
[47:17] You look upon us, you look at all of us,
[47:19] we're failures. Every one of us is a
[47:21] failure. Amen. Tomorrow, we're going to
[47:23] do something wrong. I'll guarantee it
[47:25] because you're in this this thing that's
[47:28] fallen.
[47:29] Amen. But the grace of God,
[47:33] the grace of God came down in Moses. And
[47:35] God, oh yeah, God sent judgment.
[47:39] Everything you do in this flesh, you
[47:42] screw up, the grace of God will save
[47:44] your soul, but you're going to pay for
[47:46] what you did. If you were a crazy drug
[47:50] addict or whatever, you break your body
[47:53] down, believe me, you get saved in your
[47:56] side, but the outside still broke.
[47:59] You still got these problems, that
[48:01] problem, and everything else because of
[48:02] the life you chose to live because you
[48:04] thought it was fun. Amen. But the grace
[48:07] of God, the grace, Hallelujah. Thank
[48:11] you, Lord. Amen. We'd all be gone. It's
[48:14] grace. And now they didn't keep it, but
[48:18] they were they never did come to the
[48:20] full promise. Not that generation. No,
[48:23] not the promise, the one that it was
[48:25] made to perish in the wilderness.
[48:28] You think about it.
[48:30] Many hundreds of years later, God had
[48:33] the same problem with the children of
[48:35] Israel. And he he sent them down to
[48:37] Babylon to teach them so that when they
[48:40] would come back and they started to
[48:42] rebuild the temple that they would
[48:43] finally follow the word of God.
[48:48] And they didn't.
[48:54] They never did come to the full promise.
[48:56] Not that generation, not the one that
[48:58] promise was made to. They all perish in
[49:00] the wilderness. But God fed them. He
[49:03] took care of them. He loved them. He
[49:06] moved them. Why? His grace did it. His
[49:11] grace because of his promise. His
[49:13] promise. Then the grace that went with
[49:16] his promise. They never to come to the
[49:18] full value of the promised land. And
[49:20] neither does the church come to its full
[49:22] value. The grace of God will hold us.
[49:25] But he wants to get a church that obey
[49:27] him. A people that'll take his word and
[49:29] say it's the truth regardless of the
[49:32] organization. Amen.
[49:36] Moses,
[49:38] remember Moses? He was a great leader.
[49:42] You would think Moses who spoke to God
[49:45] face to fa I mean he had a relationship
[49:47] that you and I could only dream of.
[49:51] Amen. And God gave him a simple
[49:54] commandment. He says, "Go to the rock
[49:57] and just speak to it.
[50:00] Go to the rock and speak to it."
[50:03] And water will come forth.
[50:05] Amen.
[50:08] He says that great leader. He says, "God
[50:11] should have killed him when he went down
[50:14] there to glorify himself by smiting the
[50:16] rock."
[50:19] God should have killed him.
[50:22] You think how many times God should have
[50:24] wiped us right out of his economy.
[50:29] Our attitudes are wrong. Our lives are
[50:32] screwed up. All these different things.
[50:34] God could just cast us away. You know,
[50:37] that's what he told Moses. He said,
[50:39] Moses, he said, I'm sick and tired of
[50:41] these people. They're stiff neck.
[50:42] They're they're just they're just bad
[50:44] people. And he says, "I'm going to kill
[50:46] them all and then I'm going to take you
[50:47] and I'm going to raise up and and you
[50:50] are going to become the nation." And
[50:51] they have been the same cuz Moses was
[50:54] corrupted. He wasn't b virgin born.
[50:58] He had the he had the bad gene in him.
[51:02] He had this Yeah. He had this serpent
[51:03] gene in him. He There nothing he could
[51:05] do about it.
[51:09] He said, "You see what I can do?" In
[51:11] other words, you rebels, must we fetch
[51:13] water for you out of the rock? He
[51:15] smoteed it. The waters didn't come, so
[51:17] he smoteed it again. And they got really
[51:20] mad. His temper wasn't right. His temper
[51:24] wasn't saved.
[51:29] He testified to the weakness of Christ
[51:31] because Christ was the rock. That's the
[51:33] headstone.
[51:35] Oh, wait a minute.
[51:37] That was our opening scripture.
[51:40] So, Rubable laid the foundation,
[51:43] but the scripture says that before he
[51:45] laid the foundation, he's going to call
[51:48] for the headstone
[51:50] to come down and fitly join the whole
[51:52] building together,
[51:54] crying, "Grace,
[51:56] grace,
[51:58] grace,
[52:01] grace." It was smitten once. Remember
[52:03] God told Moses over in Exodus, "Go out,
[52:06] stand before me. Stand upon the rock and
[52:08] smite the rock." and he smoked the rock
[52:11] and it brought forth water. So God said
[52:14] that's good in the foundation,
[52:17] right? In the foundation that was good.
[52:20] But now we're way up here now.
[52:23] He said, "Now just speak to it."
[52:28] But Moses wanted to show he had a little
[52:30] authority,
[52:32] wanted to show he had a little power. He
[52:34] said, "I'm going to bring you water out
[52:36] of this rock."
[52:37] God should have killed him. God should
[52:40] have separated him. He broke God's law
[52:44] right there because he spoke of the
[52:46] weakness of Christ. He had to be smitten
[52:49] the second time, but Christ was only
[52:51] smitten once. Amen.
[52:55] Amen.
[52:58] David
[53:01] was really interesting when I he said
[53:04] here was David. He says, "Look at David.
[53:06] How could David take Uriah's wife, the
[53:09] beautiful Ba Sheba, when he had 500 of
[53:12] his own?
[53:13] But he seen her taking a bath. And
[53:16] here's the negligence.
[53:18] Now, she just forgot to pull the shades
[53:20] down there when she was taking her bath.
[53:24] And she knowed the king made the trip
[53:26] through there every day down that wall.
[53:34] Beth Sheeba
[53:36] had her eye on David.
[53:42] But you know what the other problem was?
[53:45] When David came down the wall,
[53:49] you know, Brother Brandham, the angel
[53:51] told him, he said, the angel told
[53:52] Brother Bren, he said, "There's a trap
[53:54] lead for you tonight. Be very careful
[53:57] what you do because what you say is how
[54:00] it's going to be.
[54:03] We're not ready for that.
[54:06] I mean, we're not.
[54:08] But David, when he went down there and
[54:10] he saw her,
[54:12] he should have turned his head and ran
[54:14] away.
[54:16] My wife and I, we we watch a lot of
[54:18] mysteries and I always I say, "Oh,
[54:21] Donna, that was a mistake. That man
[54:23] should have never been with No. No.
[54:25] Uhuh.
[54:27] I've had them women do that to me."
[54:30] Oh, yeah.
[54:32] I've had them do that. I've had the
[54:34] sales ladies come in. I mean, I had an
[54:36] office. They come in my office and I'd
[54:38] go, "Oh, Lord, what what am I going to
[54:41] do? I mean, I I'm a manager. I, you
[54:45] know, I got to Oh,
[54:49] but see, he should have ran.
[54:53] But David, come back the next night.
[54:56] See if she was there." And she was
[54:58] there.
[55:00] again.
[55:04] Brother Benham said she just forgot to
[55:06] pull the shades down
[55:08] knowing the king was going to be up
[55:10] there. And he said that's the matter. He
[55:12] says I don't think women today just
[55:14] neglect that or well they just simply go
[55:16] out naked is with no clothes on. It's a
[55:20] disgrace. They wonder why men blow and
[55:21] whistle. Why? They do that to make them
[55:24] whistle and carry on. They know what
[55:26] they're doing. They got sense enough to
[55:28] know.
[55:31] If you're honest, you know
[55:35] it's in their heart. And when David did
[55:37] that evil thing,
[55:39] his own judgment should have killed him.
[55:43] The prophet came up,
[55:45] David was so blinded by sin.
[55:51] You think about that. God said David was
[55:54] a man after his own heart. Yet he was so
[55:57] blinded by beauty of Beth Sheeba. He
[56:02] called her
[56:04] and she you think about this.
[56:07] I mean just really think about this.
[56:10] What if what if I called you
[56:14] to my house and my wife's not there?
[56:19] He called Basheba up and then they had a
[56:22] relationship.
[56:23] Shouldn't she have said, "Uh, no, this
[56:26] isn't right. No matter how powerful you
[56:29] are."
[56:31] But she didn't.
[56:33] And then they then she sent word back.
[56:37] She sent word back. She says, "Well,
[56:38] David, we got a problem here
[56:41] because I'm with child."
[56:44] And David, like Adam,
[56:48] ran and started looking for some fig
[56:50] leaves. How can I get out of this mess?
[56:54] This is what I'll do. I'll get her
[56:57] husband to come back. I I I got I know
[57:00] who the journal is. I'll call the
[57:02] husband. I'll have him come back. I
[57:04] bring him up. We'll have a feast. We'll
[57:05] get him good and drunk. Have a couple
[57:07] of, you know, couple of cubes of beer
[57:09] and everything. Maybe some tequila and
[57:11] some vodka and everything else. and I'll
[57:13] send him down to his house. And that man
[57:16] was so honorable, he wouldn't even go
[57:17] into his own house because Israel was
[57:20] fighting.
[57:22] And David then said, "Oh, we got to be a
[57:25] little smarter now." A go man after
[57:28] God's own heart.
[57:32] The grace of God,
[57:36] we don't understand the grace of God,
[57:38] how great it is.
[57:42] And then David sent him, you know, and
[57:45] Uriah got killed and he said, "Oh,
[57:48] okay." I looked in Moses's law and it
[57:50] said, "Well, her husband's dead. She's a
[57:52] widow, so I can take her for a wife."
[57:54] So, he took her for a wife. He I I'm
[57:57] showed you what the Bible says. I did
[57:58] just what Moses did, right? And and
[58:02] brother Brandham said, he says, "David
[58:04] with his high robes, his big crown,
[58:09] the prophet come down, stood before him,
[58:11] and said, "David, how's everything
[58:12] going?" "Everything's great. Praise God.
[58:16] It's wonderful."
[58:20] David thought, "Everything's all right."
[58:22] You know, Joab come back and told him,
[58:24] said, "David that Uriah died." David
[58:26] thought,
[58:28] "I got by that time. I wonder how many
[58:31] of them little
[58:34] we got hanging in the closet,
[58:37] right? I got by at that time
[58:41] I got his wife. Everything would be all
[58:42] right. Got the baby, but the baby then
[58:44] took sick. The baby started dying. He
[58:48] done everything he could to save the
[58:49] baby's life. Every doctor came. No good.
[58:52] Finally, the baby died. They was afraid
[58:55] to tell David the baby was dead. He
[58:57] died. Then he thought everything was
[58:58] fine. It worked out. It's perfect. It's
[59:01] all worked out.
[59:04] I, you know, could have been adultery. I
[59:05] mean, I, you know, but the baby's dead,
[59:08] so we're good.
[59:14] The old prophet, the old broadheaded
[59:16] prophet, he stomped in Nathan out. He
[59:18] sat down and he says, "David, how is
[59:21] everything going?"
[59:23] Fine. Everything's great.
[59:27] Live forever. Hallelujah. Oh, he thought
[59:29] everything was fine. He thought he could
[59:31] hide it. But you know, you can't hide
[59:33] from God.
[59:37] He says he knows everything you're
[59:39] thinking right now. He's God.
[59:45] Now to me, you might be thinking, "Wow,
[59:48] that's wow. He knows everything I'm
[59:50] thinking."
[59:52] But tonight, before you turn the light
[59:54] out, he knows everything you're thinking
[59:56] then.
[59:59] And when you get up in the morning,
[1:00:02] he's going to know what you were
[1:00:03] thinking then, but you forgot what
[1:00:06] you've heard
[1:00:08] because you're not in church anymore.
[1:00:13] David wasn't in the temple. You know,
[1:00:15] David said, "I'd rather be a doormat. I'
[1:00:17] I'd rather be in the temple. I'd rather
[1:00:18] be praising the Lord and everything
[1:00:20] else." But he had committed adultery,
[1:00:21] then murder, and then murder on top of
[1:00:23] that. And then and then he and oh it was
[1:00:27] bad.
[1:00:29] Amen.
[1:00:32] He knows your thoughts. He knows who you
[1:00:34] are, where you came from, what you done.
[1:00:36] For Jesus Christ is the same yesterday.
[1:00:38] And God had revealed it to that prophet.
[1:00:40] He said, "David, there was a rich man.
[1:00:42] He lived by the side of the road. He had
[1:00:44] a whole lot of sheep. He was very rich.
[1:00:46] He lived, he was poor, but he had one
[1:00:48] lamb, and he treated it like his
[1:00:50] daughter. He fed that same spoon that he
[1:00:52] ate with. He slept with that lamb." It's
[1:00:54] just like a daughter limb. And one day a
[1:00:55] visitor came. So instead, the rich man
[1:00:58] taking one of his own sheep and making a
[1:01:00] feast for the visitor. Well,
[1:01:03] he went over and took the poor man's
[1:01:04] lamb by force. Took the lamb, slayed it,
[1:01:08] made a feast,
[1:01:10] and that was David's passions.
[1:01:13] He had 500 wives. But when he seen
[1:01:16] Uriah's wife, instead of taking out his
[1:01:19] 500 wives to appease his passions, he
[1:01:22] went and took another man's wife. And
[1:01:24] then he killed Uriah when she become
[1:01:26] mother. David didn't know what he was
[1:01:28] doing. David was ready to pronounce
[1:01:30] judgment. That's the way we are. We can
[1:01:34] always judge the other fellow. But then
[1:01:36] when it's comes to us, oh that's
[1:01:38] different. That man will pay for it with
[1:01:40] his life. that old prophet. David,
[1:01:45] David, you're the guy.
[1:01:50] But
[1:01:52] grace
[1:01:54] stepped in.
[1:01:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:59] Grace stepped in and said, "David,
[1:02:02] you won't die."
[1:02:04] Now, you're going to pay for it,
[1:02:07] right? But you won't die.
[1:02:16] If it hadn't been for grace, where would
[1:02:18] we all be?
[1:02:20] Sovereign grace is from a sovereign one.
[1:02:24] Sovereign grace from a sovereign one.
[1:02:26] Sovereign. What can you do? Sovereign
[1:02:28] can do whatever it wants to. Listen to
[1:02:30] this now. Sovereign grace can only be
[1:02:32] given by one that's sovereign. And God
[1:02:35] is sovereign. So he can give sovereign
[1:02:37] grace. Therefore, being sovereign, grace
[1:02:41] doesn't have to ask anybody. It doesn't
[1:02:42] have it doesn't. It does what it wants
[1:02:44] to. Isn't that wonderful? You don't have
[1:02:47] to ask, can I do this or shall I do
[1:02:48] this? Can I? Must I? Will I? Doesn't do
[1:02:51] it. It does it itself. Grace is
[1:02:52] sovereign.
[1:02:54] Therefore,
[1:02:56] he can save the vilest. He can save the
[1:02:59] worst. He can save the most impur. He
[1:03:03] can save the immoralist. He can heal the
[1:03:06] sickest. Hallelujah. He can save a
[1:03:08] wretch like me. And that's what he did.
[1:03:12] Amazing grace. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:16] Think of it. Love and grace. They're
[1:03:19] sisters. They're twin sisters. You can't
[1:03:21] have grace without having love. They're
[1:03:24] twin sisters. Exactly. Right. Before you
[1:03:26] can have grace, you have to have love.
[1:03:29] Before you can actually show somebody a
[1:03:31] favor, you got to love them. right or
[1:03:34] wrong, you have to love them anyhow or
[1:03:37] you can't show them grace. You see? So,
[1:03:39] love and grace is the same thing.
[1:03:41] They're just twin sisters. That's all.
[1:03:43] Love and grace. We can't see one another
[1:03:46] without the other one. God so loved the
[1:03:49] world
[1:03:51] that is grace gave his only begotten
[1:03:54] son.
[1:03:56] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:03:58] Amen.
[1:04:00] That's just nothing you can do without
[1:04:02] working one without the other. Grace,
[1:04:04] God's grace is what saves us. Praise
[1:04:08] God.
[1:04:10] Amen. Let's look at Romans nine.
[1:04:15] Amen.
[1:04:18] The grace.
[1:04:20] Oh, the grace that was shown to fallen
[1:04:23] man.
[1:04:25] Who I am.
[1:04:28] Romans 9 verse1 16 it says
[1:04:33] so then it is not of him that willth nor
[1:04:37] of him that runth but of God that
[1:04:41] showeth mercy.
[1:04:44] Let God do the calling.
[1:04:46] God will call you. He called Abraham. He
[1:04:51] will sanctify you.
[1:04:53] He will give you what he he'll give you
[1:04:56] what he needs or thinks you need to give
[1:04:59] you. He'll He'll take care of it.
[1:05:02] Whatever you have need of. Praise the
[1:05:05] Lord.
[1:05:06] He'll He'll take care of it. If you
[1:05:09] stumble and fall, just repent. Then
[1:05:12] God's grace will come right back. If if
[1:05:14] if it things just don't work out, don't
[1:05:17] don't leave the church.
[1:05:20] Don't just run off.
[1:05:22] Say, "Oh Lord, help me.
[1:05:25] He's your buckler. He's your shield.
[1:05:27] He's He's He's my strength."
[1:05:31] When Brother Johnson was dying, I I it
[1:05:34] was up there the one day, I said,
[1:05:35] "Brother Johnson," I said, "He's my
[1:05:37] buckler. He's my shield. He's my strong
[1:05:40] tower.
[1:05:42] He's my everything." Brother Johnson,
[1:05:44] I'm going to make it. I said, "Brother
[1:05:46] Johnson, we're going." Yeah.
[1:05:51] Yes.
[1:05:53] Let God do the calling.
[1:05:57] See, you can't bargain for grace.
[1:06:00] Nope. It can't be sold. It can't be
[1:06:03] bargained for. It can't be bought. You
[1:06:07] can't trade anything for it. It's
[1:06:09] sovereign grace given by a sovereign God
[1:06:14] to an elected people.
[1:06:17] I like that part. An elected people.
[1:06:21] Amen.
[1:06:24] John 6.
[1:06:27] We'll close with this one or we could go
[1:06:30] on for ever. John 6 verse 37. And it
[1:06:35] says, "And all that the Father giveth me
[1:06:39] shall come to me,
[1:06:42] and him that cometh to me, I will in no
[1:06:46] wise cast out."
[1:06:50] That's grace.
[1:06:53] But what if I do this? I can't break my
[1:06:57] own word,
[1:06:59] right? I'm not going to cash you out.
[1:07:03] You know, I said, 'How could a mother
[1:07:05] forget her suckling child? He said, she
[1:07:08] she won't because that child's part of
[1:07:10] her. He says, and neither can I forget
[1:07:13] you because your names are engraved in
[1:07:17] the palms of my hands.
[1:07:21] I'll never forget you. I called you. I
[1:07:25] won't leave you. I won't I I you might
[1:07:28] you might fail and stumble and
[1:07:31] everything else, but God's word, his
[1:07:34] grace is sufficient. Amen.
[1:07:37] Amen.
[1:07:39] Amen. For I came down from heaven,
[1:07:43] and not to do my own will, but the will
[1:07:45] of him that sent me. And this is the
[1:07:47] Father's will which has sent me, that of
[1:07:50] all which he hath given me, I should
[1:07:54] lose nothing,
[1:07:56] but should raise him up again at the
[1:08:00] last day.
[1:08:02] God's grace cannot be bargained for.
[1:08:06] It's sovereign grace.
[1:08:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:08:11] Let's bow our heads.
[1:08:15] Dear Lord,
[1:08:17] without your grace,
[1:08:20] none of us would be standing here. We
[1:08:23] wouldn't be here hearing the words of
[1:08:25] life.
[1:08:27] This is life.
[1:08:29] Because all of us carry baggage.
[1:08:33] We all have
[1:08:35] memories. We all have problems. We all
[1:08:37] have failures. And the devil brings them
[1:08:40] before us.
[1:08:42] And the devil brought them all before
[1:08:44] you. You you said one time you said all
[1:08:46] that ever's come before me is thiefs and
[1:08:48] robbers and everything else. He said get
[1:08:51] away,
[1:08:54] but we are your elect
[1:08:57] and your grace has been extended to us.
[1:09:00] And we've proven by the scriptures that
[1:09:04] Moses was not a perfect man. David
[1:09:06] wasn't a perfect man. Abraham wasn't a
[1:09:09] perfect man.
[1:09:11] Adam wasn't a perfect man. But God
[1:09:14] picked them up. And even in their
[1:09:17] failures,
[1:09:19] his grace was sufficient.
[1:09:22] Lord, may we not ever trample the grace
[1:09:26] of God underfoot.
[1:09:29] It's not an excuse for us to just do
[1:09:31] whatever we want.
[1:09:34] No, that's not what grace is all about.
[1:09:38] But let us find the twin sister, too.
[1:09:41] Let us find that love in our hearts that
[1:09:44] we can give grace to those around us.
[1:09:48] Lord,
[1:09:51] we've told everything that you laid upon
[1:09:54] our hearts to tell. I just pray that
[1:09:57] you'll just burn it deep in our hearts,
[1:10:00] Lord. Engrave it in our minds that we'll
[1:10:02] not forget it, but Lord, that we'll
[1:10:06] always remember your grace.
[1:10:08] We commit everything.
