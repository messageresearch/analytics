[0:02] before we begin reading its look to the
[0:04] all three men our dear Heavenly Father
[0:07] we thank you for the desire you place in
[0:11] our hearts to be here and Lord we're not
[0:14] looking to stained-glass windows or how
[0:20] big the churches or even how many people
[0:23] are here when you're here all things are
[0:31] possible you said just where two or
[0:34] three would be gathered together you
[0:37] would be there in the myths Lauren we're
[0:40] believing for the unseen God to come and
[0:44] move supernaturally in all of our lives
[0:48] today prepare us for the revelation of
[0:52] your word Lord we have worshipped you we
[0:55] have expressed our love to you and now
[0:59] Lord I pray that you give us ears to
[1:02] hear the love that you have for us today
[1:06] were the desires to walk in and lord
[1:11] whatever you would speak I pray that you
[1:16] would give us a heart to receive it Lord
[1:19] pray that you'd be with every one of our
[1:23] brothers and sisters that are not here
[1:24] today Lord we ask that the Holy Spirit
[1:29] would just reveal thyself to each one
[1:33] Lord keep them in this late hour that
[1:37] we're in Lord bless this word now as we
[1:41] commit this service in your hands for
[1:43] your honor and glory we pray in Jesus
[1:46] Christ's name
[1:48] galatians chapter 5 starting with verse
[1:52] number 7 he did run well who did hinder
[2:00] you that he should not obey the truth
[2:03] this persuasion cometh not of him that
[2:06] calleth you a little leaven leaveneth
[2:10] the whole lump and then also one verse
[2:14] in 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 verse
[2:17] number 3 but I fear but I fear lest by
[2:25] any means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[2:28] through his subtlety so your minds
[2:32] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[2:34] that is in Christ amen god bless you may
[2:38] be seated
[2:39] we want to entitle this message Satan's
[2:42] virus and for a subject the virus of
[2:48] unbelief as I was doing some research on
[2:52] viruses I came across some very
[2:54] interesting information
[2:56] viruses are tiny infectious agents that
[3:01] can wreak havoc a lot of times when
[3:05] we've gotten viruses it has slowed us
[3:08] down we feel sluggish and just not just
[3:13] under the weather as a word and just
[3:18] like a believer when he gets a spiritual
[3:20] virus it can slow him down from running
[3:23] the race well amen a virus on its own is
[3:30] inert and I never even knew what that
[3:32] word meant until I looked it up in other
[3:36] words it has no inherent power of action
[3:40] or motion or resistance it is inactive
[3:44] or sluggish by nature having little or
[3:46] no ability to react a virus is not even
[3:51] alive
[3:52] it's merely just a piece of information
[3:55] and the information is not always good
[3:59] obviously what makes some viruses
[4:02] dangerous even deadly is when they
[4:04] attach themselves to a living cell in
[4:08] our bodies they gain their power by
[4:10] worming their way in to a living cell
[4:13] and the only way they can survive or
[4:15] reproduce or replicate is by getting
[4:19] inside a living host and they live off
[4:21] of that once they're in they quickly
[4:24] hijack the cells machinery giving them
[4:27] the ability to reproduce itself and boy
[4:31] do they ever they start off in fourth
[4:33] gear and they just mass-produce like a
[4:35] printing press and they even spill out
[4:39] into other cells and that's how the body
[4:41] gets so infected that you can't even
[4:44] keep up yes they have no life of their
[4:51] own they survive off of living cells by
[4:56] perverting them from the original
[4:59] intentions that God created them for
[5:02] these tiny infectious agents as I said
[5:06] they wreak havoc in our bodies and cause
[5:10] great confusion to the point that it
[5:13] just spirals out of control
[5:15] and and then hospitals doctors they
[5:18] can't do nothing about it
[5:20] Cobin 19 has caused a great pandemic
[5:25] across the world which we all know
[5:26] nearly 7 million cases of the virus have
[5:30] claimed nearly 400,000 lives the unknown
[5:36] of its capability and that's what it was
[5:38] at the beginning into some degree it is
[5:41] still not everything is known about it
[5:44] but the unknown of its capability has
[5:47] caused a great fear and panic to spread
[5:50] throughout the world leaving the world
[5:53] in a quarantine
[5:54] only to come out wearing a mask it keeps
[5:58] mutating into faucets or facets as we
[6:02] watch it continue to it
[6:04] economy our economy I say it's like a
[6:08] burn anybody's ever gotten a real bad
[6:11] burn after you you know quickly put cold
[6:15] water on it if you don't leave it under
[6:20] water it continues to burn it continues
[6:25] to eat away at the flesh and that's what
[6:28] fear does it continues to mutate and
[6:32] cause problems in the world amen
[6:38] people begin to have begun to lose sight
[6:44] of their purpose staying inside that
[6:48] they're losing hope of a better future
[6:51] being cooped up has caused many other
[6:54] problems suicide depression
[6:57] divorce people are losing their mind and
[7:00] and they're carrying out radical
[7:02] behaviors this virus has just gotten
[7:05] things out of control his fear continues
[7:09] to mutate to different facets people's
[7:12] minds are becoming more confused Satan
[7:18] is trying to gain control look at these
[7:22] riots fear is leaving society with great
[7:27] anxiety unrest and unsureness Luke 21
[7:34] verse 25 jesus said that there would be
[7:37] distress of all nations upon the earth
[7:42] with perplexity distress of all nations
[7:46] is that not what we're going through
[7:48] right now with perplexity I mean just
[7:55] can't figure it out it's it's it's so
[7:57] broad and it's so inter in so many
[8:01] different areas it's just not a simple
[8:05] little thing this distress men's hearts
[8:09] are failing for fear
[8:12] and for looking after those things which
[8:15] are coming upon the earth for the powers
[8:16] of heaven shall be shaken Luke 21 verse
[8:21] 35 for us as a snare it shall come upon
[8:27] all that dwell upon the face of the
[8:30] whole earth this if I haven't seen this
[8:34] scripture as much fulfilling the effects
[8:39] of the whole earth in this time I don't
[8:42] know what has it just it's becoming
[8:44] worse and worse amen why why are people
[8:50] looting now it's because they because
[8:55] they can get away with it they're taking
[8:58] advantage of the situation the riots are
[9:02] no longer about George Floyd they have
[9:05] become a platform for the enemy to
[9:08] destroy more and more there's no concern
[9:13] to help
[9:16] no they're just complainers let's join
[9:21] together and complain since we can't fix
[9:24] anything let's complain about it
[9:27] fear is a platform that the devil uses
[9:30] to manipulate people and people are
[9:34] looting and taking advantage of the
[9:36] situations because they can get away
[9:38] with it the devil's got a virus right
[9:43] here inside the church it's just the
[9:48] knowledge without the life of Christ
[9:51] it's a strip of knowledge I don't know
[9:54] how many times I've heard in the past
[10:00] month or so people telling me that they
[10:05] know God
[10:08] there okay and they know God and that's
[10:13] all that matters ya know where did God
[10:18] ever say that's all that matters
[10:21] nowhere but see Satan has confused their
[10:24] mind they're taking advantage of the
[10:29] Liberty that there is in Christ and
[10:33] they're looting
[10:41] remember that virus only feeds off of
[10:45] the life and to me the virus s in the
[10:49] church is feeding off the life of the
[10:52] church
[10:53] our opening scripture 2nd Corinthians 11
[10:57] verse 3 but I fear lest by any means as
[11:01] the serpent beguiled Eve through his
[11:04] subtilty so your minds should be
[11:06] corrupted from the simplicity that's in
[11:08] Christ just as the most soft obese
[11:12] deceived Eve to his cunning crafting
[11:15] ability to get Eve to doubt is how the
[11:19] devil is corrupting the minds of the
[11:21] people today from the simplicity of just
[11:24] believing all the word they have no
[11:26] problem believing part of the word but
[11:31] we can't be content with that something
[11:35] that I thought was very scary is when
[11:39] years ago when we were going through
[11:42] brother Branham made mention that Eve
[11:45] just disbelieved one word and in one
[11:48] place where the brand said that evil Eve
[11:52] 99.98% of the word point all two percent
[11:58] caused all the problems that we deal
[12:00] with today and how can we just stand on
[12:04] I believe in God so did even look what
[12:07] happened she didn't down that unbelief
[12:11] is like a virus it has no life of its
[12:16] own it's just a strip of knowledge
[12:19] from the tree of knowledge of good and
[12:21] evil Satan has no ability to create he
[12:25] only has the ability to corrupt and
[12:27] pervert that which God has created from
[12:30] this original purpose and there are
[12:34] seeds of doubt that can reproduce and
[12:37] eventually leaven the whole lump he did
[12:42] run well who did hinder you that you
[12:46] should not obey the truth how many times
[12:55] has did we hear the Prophet and the
[12:57] message say if Eve just if Eve doubted
[13:04] just one word where does that put us we
[13:09] can't take that part out of the
[13:10] scripture amen
[13:11] we can't hide behind that I believe the
[13:14] Prophet I believe the message I believe
[13:16] what he said if you believe the message
[13:19] you will take the message and follow the
[13:22] message not just say I believe it and
[13:25] then you do what you want to do just
[13:27] loot because you can get away with it
[13:31] this persuasion cometh not of him that
[13:35] call with you a little leaven leaveneth
[13:38] the whole lump Satan has the ability to
[13:44] persuade called
[13:45] believers from obeying the truth to the
[13:49] virus of doubt it's a definite germ of
[13:54] knowledge that can affect the whole
[13:57] system just a little bit of just well
[14:01] this is not a big thing in the big
[14:04] picture where does that lead you it
[14:08] doesn't lead you to hungry for more God
[14:10] for for wanting to and always leads you
[14:13] away but as long as we think we've got
[14:17] it covered we feel comforted and that to
[14:21] me is how the devil corrupts our mind
[14:24] from the simplicity of believing in
[14:27] Christ believe everything
[14:29] don't doubt it doubt has the ability to
[14:36] hijack the mechanism a free more agency
[14:39] get in there and begin to to reproduce
[14:42] is doubts and spilling over and others
[14:45] and before you know it what you say to
[14:47] others they're beginning to believe
[14:53] mass-producing until leavens the whole
[14:56] lump doubt accepts knowledge but faith
[15:04] but faith accepts the word and that's
[15:11] why we'll never have think about all the
[15:15] wars that have been fought over religion
[15:19] they haven't been because they had a
[15:21] revelation but people will fight for
[15:28] what they believe in though I believe
[15:33] I'm a Christian I okay okay why don't we
[15:40] just get into this word and start living
[15:43] and that's what matters
[15:45] that's what we need that's what the
[15:47] world needs
[15:50] it's not about defending our belief it's
[15:53] about being an instrument that God can
[15:56] use in this hour to help others when
[16:00] Paul told Timothy about the perilous
[16:02] times that were coming in this day he
[16:04] described a spiritual virus that has
[16:08] infected the church you can say Amen to
[16:12] that's the truth
[16:14] believers were more into themselves
[16:19] that's what this virus does did you know
[16:23] the virus of unbelief can cause people
[16:25] today to do what they want to do that's
[16:30] what it did to Eve that low most of
[16:36] tobey's just said you know you can
[16:37] you'll be like God I just do just
[16:41] the devil never said you're gonna go
[16:44] away from God and you're gonna come on
[16:46] my side he deceived her through his
[16:54] subtilty his craftiness and his ability
[16:57] to be able to say something to the minds
[17:01] of believers and make it look so close
[17:05] jesus said because iniquity would abound
[17:07] in the last days the love of many would
[17:10] wax cold iniquity just do what you want
[17:15] to do you don't have to do what God has
[17:17] asked you to do and that's becoming
[17:22] easier to do today there's more Ludi 2nd
[17:29] Timothy chapter 3 verse 1
[17:35] look at this virus here this know also
[17:39] that in the last days perilous times
[17:42] shall come now I want you to notice that
[17:45] these are symptoms that a person has
[17:48] after they've been infected by the
[17:51] devil's virus this is basically
[17:54] describing the nature Satan in the
[17:57] church not in the bars but in the church
[17:59] for men shall be lovers of their own
[18:03] selves covetous boasters God resists God
[18:17] is resisting the church it is the
[18:24] Murrays the few is it the brave the few
[18:30] no the proud that's right the few the
[18:33] proud and the Marines it should be the
[18:38] few the humble and the bride that's what
[18:42] it should be but the church their
[18:46] bolsters
[18:48] instead of giving God the credit instead
[18:51] of lifting him up and saying he is he is
[18:54] my life they become boasters proud
[18:58] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[19:02] unthankful unholy I can't imagine this
[19:08] being in the church without natural
[19:14] affection trucebreakers false accusers
[19:20] has anybody got accused in the last week
[19:24] this is a this is an ongoing situation
[19:28] here false accusers incontinent fierce
[19:32] despisers of those that are good hard
[19:37] hard for some people to find something
[19:40] good about you because the anointing the
[19:45] virus that's on them
[19:47] is judgmental they want to find
[19:49] something traitors heady highminded
[19:54] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[19:58] God say late they love God but they've
[20:03] been infected unbelief the unbelief of
[20:08] putting God first and only knowledge has
[20:16] no life of its own having a form of
[20:18] godliness but denying the power thereof
[20:23] from such turn away now you would have
[20:26] thought Paul would have been describing
[20:29] the riots lovers of pleasure more than
[20:32] lovers of God hurt ready high-minded
[20:35] fears incontinent despisers of those you
[20:38] would think he'd be describing the
[20:40] physical riots and Wars of mankind but
[20:47] he's describing the church the symptoms
[20:50] of a spiritual virus and how bad it can
[20:53] get
[20:54] instead of an of a church it infects
[20:58] believers
[21:01] now it doesn't take away their salvation
[21:05] necessarily they just need the vaccine
[21:11] they just need help they need to get it
[21:15] out of their system remember God said in
[21:22] Genesis chapter 2 verse 17 for in that
[21:25] day in the day that thou eatest thereof
[21:28] thou shalt surely die knowledge has no
[21:32] life of its own and in this hour people
[21:37] are ok with a form of godliness but
[21:41] they're but they're denying the power
[21:45] God has power to overcome the virus to
[21:51] overcome on belief and then to get us to
[21:54] run the race well not just run it but
[21:58] run it well Satan found a way to
[22:02] mass-produce his knowledge without life
[22:07] he hijacked Eve in the garden and
[22:10] started mass-producing his evil nature
[22:16] that's why we all got to get born again
[22:20] because it brought for death
[22:22] and a little leaven left the whole lump
[22:25] and people are living off the life of
[22:28] God every person that's born they're
[22:33] living off the life of God whether their
[22:35] seed of God or not whether they're born
[22:37] of God are born again or not all life
[22:41] comes from God they're living off that
[22:44] life but God intended every person to be
[22:48] born by his will and Satan has got in
[22:53] there and perverted it and and it just
[22:57] mass-producing don't let unbelief keep
[23:03] you from walking into further truth yes
[23:07] we're believers yes we have the truth
[23:09] but there is more truth for us
[23:12] and we're on different levels you know
[23:16] how the virus is infected people
[23:19] differently some they have it they'd
[23:23] only realize it some have it and there's
[23:27] just totally knocks them out well we
[23:34] don't know everything
[23:36] what's it happening inside of us we
[23:38] don't our heart is deceptive
[23:41] it was deceitful who who can know how
[23:43] hard it it takes the word to unveil it's
[23:46] why we come to church to find out where
[23:48] we're at and when we hear the word of
[23:50] course it's gonna be like whoa Satan
[23:58] sees we got some unbelief in us I mean
[24:00] God sees me we have some unbelief in us
[24:03] and it has to get out of there amen
[24:14] Satan has wormed his way into the church
[24:19] and has hijacked 'add the hosts
[24:23] corrupting believers from believing more
[24:27] of the word that's exactly we did the
[24:32] eve eve believed is probably everything
[24:34] perfectly don't you think it wasn't
[24:39] until the last bit before she fell the
[24:45] the children of Israel that came out of
[24:47] Egypt they believed they believed in God
[24:50] they they they watched the pillar fire
[24:56] they move when the spirit moved God was
[25:01] with them their shoes didn't wear out
[25:03] you've heard me say they had BlueCross
[25:06] BlueShield but yet they did not continue
[25:11] to walk as God show them more light that
[25:15] virus 11 the whole love there was just
[25:20] if it wouldn't have been for those 10
[25:23] spies coming back with a
[25:25] rapport but they would have just let
[25:28] Joshua and Caleb stand at the pulpit
[25:32] said were more than able to take the
[25:34] land they all could have went in a
[25:38] little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
[25:41] that's why it's important to let your
[25:43] speech be positive it can make a
[25:48] difference in somebody else's life it's
[25:53] no longer about escaping the tired
[25:57] the tiny a man made religion to have the
[26:10] freedom of religion in our country no
[26:14] people are taking advantage of the so
[26:16] called liberty and looting for their own
[26:19] personal gain they may not be robbing
[26:24] the liquor store and coming up with
[26:26] cases of liquor or TVs or all the other
[26:29] things that we see that they're looting
[26:31] but believers are looting their time and
[26:38] doing what they want to do instead of
[26:41] giving it back to Jesus this quarantine
[26:45] opened the door for people to take their
[26:48] liberty and not go to church if they
[26:53] don't want you to get involved in other
[26:57] things to get distracted from their
[27:00] god-given responsibilities to not carry
[27:04] the burden of the local church the body
[27:09] the pastor or the ministry this
[27:13] quarantine opened the door from lukewarm
[27:15] Laodicea who are already in need of
[27:19] nothing are you going to church well
[27:23] it's about 50/50
[27:27] that sounds like lukewarm to me jesus
[27:33] said I'd rather have you cold or hot but
[27:36] lukewarm not interested because thou
[27:46] sayest I'm okay
[27:49] because they'll say us I am me nothing
[27:53] Jesus has seen the very fact that people
[27:55] have the attitude because thou sayest
[28:00] because this is where you're at because
[28:03] you have that it's a sure sign that you
[28:06] got a virus that's your wretched
[28:10] miserable blind naked and you don't even
[28:14] know it terrible virus lair to see them
[28:21] the worst age of all ages the most
[28:23] deceptive of all ages people's minds
[28:26] have been corrupted from the simplicity
[28:28] in this Brook from the simplicity that's
[28:30] in Christ in this age more than any
[28:32] other age people don't want to let go of
[28:40] the Liberty to do what they want to do
[28:45] people feel it's in bondage if you
[28:48] follow the word Satan is always
[28:53] providing us a way that we don't have to
[28:57] do it unbelief is the virus and it will
[29:06] infect the whole body that's why we have
[29:13] to take God and believe every word of
[29:17] God amen verse 18 I counsel thee to buy
[29:20] of me gold by the vaccine now tried in
[29:27] the fire that thou may s be rich and
[29:29] white raiment that thou mayest be
[29:31] clothed that the shame of thy nakedness
[29:32] do not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[29:35] eyesalve that thou mayest see God has
[29:39] the vaccine
[29:44] but we got to go after it
[29:49] gotta want it got a hunger for it as
[29:54] many as I love I rebuke and chasten who
[30:01] wants to go to a church like that I'd
[30:06] rather go to a church where every time I
[30:08] go the only message I hear is that God
[30:11] loves me it's different that's a
[30:18] different love than this love it's a
[30:25] human love
[30:28] they got human churches for human lovers
[30:36] but it's no vaccine for unbelief amen
[30:40] it's no vaccine from believe the real
[30:47] vaccine is to repent

[31:12] sup with him and he with me Christ the
[31:17] word is our only vaccine against this
[31:21] terrible virus of doubt it's the hour
[31:25] that we need to be building up our
[31:27] immunity

[31:33] affects some slightly and others more it
[31:39] can be devastating well others it may
[31:42] act just like an allergy runny nose a
[31:44] little cough not a big deal the answer

[32:06] say amen to the Word of God amen
[32:10] believe every word of God Colossians
[32:13] chapter 3 verse 16 let the word of
[32:16] Christ dwell in you richly richly not
[32:22] partially richly do you ever talk to
[32:26] somebody and they're always talking
[32:28] about the same thing and you notice it
[32:33] is that all you ever talk about it's
[32:37] like a one-track mind you know you know
[32:42] when the Word of God is dwelling in
[32:45] someone richly there's they just want to
[32:49] talk about the word and you can you can
[32:52] tell when the virus is in somebody real
[32:57] heavy-duty because all they're doing is
[33:00] talking about themselves what what
[33:06] they're doing what they got going it's
[33:08] their life I'm so glad that we have a
[33:13] vaccine it's the Word of God amen cast
[33:18] out all unbelief

[33:50] me
[33:50] say Amen I'm gonna help your brother
[33:52] John how can I help you care God will
[34:03] take it the rest of the way but if you
[34:06] can't if you can't get to that place we
[34:10] got to keep praying build yourselves up
[34:14] in the most holy faith amen build your
[34:19] selves up in the most holy faith you can
[34:23] do this laying on your bed how he can
[34:26] move the Lord I believe Lord I believe
[34:30] your word begin to quote those
[34:33] scriptures that you know the songs that
[34:36] you know jesus loves me this I know and
[34:39] begin to build your faith you know
[34:46] brother Brandon said if you want to know
[34:48] where Christ is at it's where you left
[34:51] him and we're living in an hour where
[34:56] it's so easy to leave him because Satan
[34:59] has convinced us as long as we've got
[35:01] the main thing yeah we're okay but is it
[35:06] is it what spirit would that be would
[35:10] that really be Jesus saying that so it's
[35:14] got to be another Jesus another spirit
[35:18] which there is not another but there's
[35:20] mimics right so we need to let the word
[35:23] have preeminence inside of us how do we
[35:26] do that Jesus is knocking at the door
[35:29] just open the door present your body to
[35:36] him lad the doctor the great physician
[35:39] come in and fill you with his word when
[35:46] you believe thou has to leave
[35:49] if you want to get rid of the virus just
[35:52] be zealous repent sorry Lord for Doughty
[35:56] I'm sorry for looting I'm sorry for the
[35:59] I just want to be so close to you first
[36:04] Peter chapter 5 verse 6 humble
[36:07] yourselves therefore under the mighty
[36:12] hand of God that he may exalt you in due
[36:15] time how I was back there and I was
[36:19] thinking about that pillar of fire
[36:29] you're the Mighty
[36:30] and of God it's not fair for me to say I
[36:37] am humble the word will let me know
[36:44] whether I'm why because it's desire the
[36:50] words desire is to see me walk in all
[36:53] truth it doesn't want to pat me on the
[36:58] back for the half that I'm doing because
[37:03] he wants a bride without pride without
[37:11] spot without wrinkle sound for us cos
[37:16] you know I did this morning
[37:17] I admit tiny and it's a wrinkle in it
[37:24] Romans chapter 12 verse wanted nothing
[37:26] to do with the message by the way Romans
[37:29] chapter 12 verse 1 I beseech you
[37:31] therefore by the mercies of God that you
[37:35] present your bodies you want to get rid
[37:38] of the virus present your body a living
[37:42] sacrifice holy and acceptable to God
[37:46] which is your reasonable service the
[37:50] least thing you could do is say Lord
[37:53] Here I am have your way with me you
[37:56] begin to put the stipulations in well
[37:58] this is how my mom and dad believe this
[38:01] is how I know present your body a living
[38:06] sacrifice be not conformed to this world
[38:10] but be transformed by the renewing of
[38:13] your mind that you may prove what is
[38:16] that good and acceptable and perfect
[38:18] will of God
[38:20] God wants to transform John Martyn God
[38:34] God is not interested in spanking the
[38:44] church he's not interested in beating up
[38:49] the church to make the church feel bad
[38:58] you know when I used to get in trouble I
[39:03] had thoughts that my daddy didn't like
[39:06] me because he wasn't giving me what I
[39:11] wanted per have anybody tell you what if
[39:16] you loved me you wouldn't do that
[39:21] what is Colonel nature for a person to
[39:27] feel that God doesn't love them if they
[39:31] give them the truth God is interested in
[39:39] one thing getting his bride to a place
[39:44] to have a rapture that's the ultimate
[39:50] now through that process they will
[39:53] become more like him they'll love their
[39:55] enemies they'll lay down their life for
[39:58] the others they'll have the same nature
[40:00] at that point so it's not just one or
[40:04] two or three things down here that we
[40:07] need to get all bothered about or upset
[40:13] or even just focus only on them our goal
[40:18] is to become in His image and God's
[40:23] calling us to that an unbelief is the
[40:27] virus as keeping us from that and that's
[40:31] why we got to separate from that day men
[40:33] we've got to separate from all unbelief
[40:37] if you're gonna quarantine yourself
[40:40] quarantine yourself from all unbelief
[40:44] just get locked in with God the faith of
[40:48] God with you in the message God's Word
[40:51] calls for total separation from unbelief
[40:53] brother Graham said when Satan tried to
[40:56] whitewash it for him speaking of Jesus
[40:59] Jesus said it is written trying
[41:03] he called it whitewash that's what Satan
[41:05] tries to do to us tries to trick us
[41:08] whitewash the word just maybe sugarcoat
[41:13] it maybe not put the emphasis on the
[41:15] importance of it maybe just take it out
[41:18] of its place a little bit and he said
[41:21] yes and it's also written he with stood
[41:25] Satan upon the word because that's what
[41:30] it was the word in the beginning was the
[41:32] word st. John 1:1 in the beginning was
[41:34] the word the Word was with God the Word
[41:36] was what was God and the Word was made
[41:39] flesh and dwelt among us he is the same
[41:43] yesterday today and forever that's the
[41:46] word of God now brother Brennan said
[41:48] it's always a connection with the spoken
[41:52] word God promised for the day and when
[41:57] it comes it's so unusual touch this till
[42:02] people can Harley grasp it because we're
[42:07] so used to forms and ideas of our own
[42:13] that is hard for us to grasp what's
[42:17] truth if they would have only searched
[42:24] the scriptures really appreciate the
[42:28] person who who just sent this quote to
[42:36] me they didn't even know how it tied in
[42:41] with today's message but the Lord did if
[42:45] they would have only searched the
[42:48] Scriptures that a virgin is to conceive
[42:50] see I was it was so unusual to him
[42:53] because it was out of line
[42:55] of the
[42:56] thinking but she was exactly in the
[43:02] scripture and sword is today brethren
[43:05] the power of the resurrection of Jesus
[43:06] Christ and his promise word of this hour
[43:09] is so unusual good men he said stumbles
[43:15] over it
[43:16] it's so unusual they say the dead was
[43:22] raised up in the blind see in the death
[43:23] here and the Holy Spirit deserves a
[43:25] thoughts for towels the things that come
[43:27] to pass never failed at one time oh they
[43:31] can't grasp it it's so unusual so they
[43:37] say well it's telepathy it's an evil
[43:40] spirit just like they did in that day
[43:43] the unusualness of the word of God in
[43:48] other words when you hear something new
[43:51] that you're not doing of course it's
[43:59] going to seem unusual odd and right away
[44:02] that's an open door for the devil to say
[44:05] that si you don't have to do that how do
[44:10] we what are we growing into are we
[44:12] growing into the statue are we growing
[44:15] into the statue of John Martin a brother
[44:19] Ben
[44:20] brother Mike a brother Larry brother Ron
[44:22] what statue are we growing into are we
[44:24] just coming to our old way of thinking
[44:27] we're not there we're not there so it's
[44:31] okay for the word to come to us and it
[44:33] go wow I haven't seen that like that
[44:35] because he's calling us to that that's
[44:39] it that's the way it's supposed to be
[44:41] we're supposed to hear something that
[44:43] causes us to get closer to God if we
[44:48] don't if we'd come to church only to
[44:51] feel better
[44:57] we're going to miss are going to miss
[45:05] it is part of it is part of the fivefold
[45:08] ministry brother Darrell was telling me
[45:14] again this time when he came this is a
[45:16] lot of people if they had a choice they
[45:19] would choose evangelist to preach to
[45:28] them all the time he says it's like
[45:33] sugar it's like candy it's sweet that
[45:36] feels taste good
[45:38] he says but the bride can't survive on
[45:43] that they need the meat potatoes and
[45:52] that doesn't taste good always
[45:56] especially if I cook but we still gotta
[46:02] eat it right still have to pray pray for
[46:09] the cook
[46:17] all right let's continue this quote
[46:20] we're almost done but when a man is born
[46:22] in the world for a believer he becomes a
[46:27] Nazarite when he separates himself from
[46:29] anything that's contrary to the word a
[46:33] total separation Jesus said I come to
[46:37] separate a man from his wife to tear up
[46:41] the family and when and and he that
[46:47] won't take up his cross and follow me is
[46:51] not worthy to be called mine so don't
[46:59] tell me we're not going to be tried in
[47:01] their own homes in their own workplaces
[47:04] I am faithful for every relationship
[47:11] that I have but there is no relationship
[47:14] that's more important than the
[47:15] relationship that we have with God and
[47:19] we will be tried God will allow the
[47:25] enemy to come in our other relationships
[47:31] and get us to disbelieve and it's our
[47:38] job to separate from the unbelief and
[47:42] take a stand with God's Word amen
[47:45] Brennan says a separation from
[47:48] everything and anything from the church
[47:51] from a community from a belief or from a
[47:56] family or anything that would stand
[47:59] between you and believing the entire
[48:02] Word of God not just the Word of God but
[48:06] the entire Word of God if your soul will
[48:11] not punctuate every promise for this
[48:13] hour with an amen
[48:16] he said there's something wrong
[48:18] somewhere he said you need a separation
[48:23] so Jesus was the Word made flesh and he
[48:26] was completely separated from sinners
[48:28] and unbelievers and the word itself
[48:30] flowed completely and thoroughly flew
[48:33] flowed through him and he said I do
[48:36] nothing until I see the father do it
[48:39] first Wow can you imagine getting to the
[48:41] place with Christ that you don't do
[48:43] nothing
[48:44] he gets instructions from the Lord it
[48:48] was asking questioning him about things
[48:50] and he said verily I say to you the son
[48:52] of man can do nothing of himself except
[48:54] what he sees the father doing and watch
[48:57] everything that he said was perfect and
[49:00] yet he had not to ask about it think
[49:03] about it it was perfect and His perfect
[49:06] truth will always separate from err see
[49:12] what I think is so beautiful about the
[49:14] Saints the way that I see what the
[49:16] ministries for the way that I see what
[49:19] preaching is for the way that I see when
[49:23] I'm supposed to be doing it's not about
[49:27] giving us information that we haven't
[49:30] seen before it's not about getting new
[49:35] information it's about giving you the
[49:41] tools to get a closer walk with the Lord
[49:51] you're the one that got to walk out with
[49:53] a hunger and a thirst and a yearning and
[49:57] a desire for more of God
[50:00] if all three doing is relying on Church
[50:05] and listening to a couple tapes and
[50:08] that's enough to feed I have so many
[50:14] times fed my face with food and I wasn't
[50:19] hungry and you know what it did make me
[50:25] sick I was just trying to stay awake we
[50:34] got to have a hunger we got to have a
[50:37] thirst there's got to be something
[50:40] inside of us that says I want to know
[50:42] you more I want to have more of you Lord
[50:48] the virus of doubt is increasing in this
[50:52] hour it's not getting less it's
[50:54] increasing and to me there's fear like
[51:00] there's never been on the planet there's
[51:03] an unsureness and everything well what
[51:05] it does is it causes a great mistrust
[51:07] the thing is the Word of God is the only
[51:11] thing that you and I have that we can
[51:14] trust it and it needs to be so real to
[51:19] us and we need to build ourself up in
[51:23] the most holy faith jesus said when the
[51:26] Son of man cometh shall he find faith on
[51:29] the earth that his return what that
[51:33] isn't coming by hearing the word
[51:35] naturally it doesn't they did they did
[51:41] Hebrew said they heard the word
[51:44] naturally but it didn't profit them
[51:47] because it wasn't mixed with the voice
[51:49] of God speaking to them personally and
[51:53] you get that to happen
[51:55] you got a hunger bore right he gives
[51:57] more grace to the humble
[51:59] but just walking around and say well you
[52:02] know I'm bright you know we do need to
[52:09] show that badge to the devil we do but
[52:17] we don't need to show that Bread edge to
[52:18] one another to one another we need to be
[52:22] humble you want to be bold take the
[52:28] sword of God's Word
[52:29] cut the promises out and tell the devil
[52:32] work where he belongs but to one another
[52:36] lay down your life serve one another
[52:40] Steve one another better than yourself
[52:42] show the badge of love and humility in
[52:45] the life of Christ
[52:50] now when you recover from the virus or
[52:55] you get the victory over it even if you
[53:01] get a little victory over it because it
[53:03] takes time to recover right takes time
[53:05] sometimes the more victory you get I
[53:08] want you to occupy your time for Jesus
[53:12] I'm going to show you this is so
[53:14] important work while state because the
[53:16] Bible says the night cometh when we
[53:18] won't be able to work first Corinthians
[53:21] chapter 15 verse 55 first Corinthians
[53:24] 15:55 as we're getting ready to close Oh
[53:27] death where is thy sting o grave where
[53:31] is thy victory and I just want you to we
[53:37] know well the sting of death is sin and
[53:44] the strength of sin is the law no
[53:46] brother man taught us that sin is
[53:48] unbelief so the sting of death is
[53:53] unbelief and the strength of unbelief is
[53:57] the law we know what to do and not doing
[54:01] it you understand but thanks be to God
[54:05] which giveth us
[54:06] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[54:09] faith in Christ faith in the word
[54:18] therefore my beloved brethren be
[54:21] steadfast unmovable always abounding in
[54:26] the work of the Lord for as ye know that
[54:30] your labor is not in vain no no why
[54:32] would he be saying this at the end when
[54:35] he is talking about it
[54:36] being all over death and there's no
[54:39] victory sin can't get us any more but
[54:42] thanks be to God let's he gives us the
[54:44] victory why didn't why didn't this
[54:47] chapter stop at verse 57 we have
[54:56] something to do when you stay busy for
[55:02] Jesus that's less that the devil can get
[55:05] in here because right now the devil
[55:11] throws so many things at our lives they
[55:15] can be health issues work if you issues
[55:18] desires plans that you want to do right
[55:23] so many different things he throws at us
[55:26] to distract us and they can get us down
[55:30] but if you're always abounding in the
[55:34] work alone
[55:35] if you're steadfast in the work of the
[55:39] Lord you've got one purpose stay focus
[55:46] on that purpose just stay focused be
[55:50] steadfast unmovable always abounding in
[55:53] the work of the Lord now Paul was not
[55:56] saying that to the believers who were
[56:01] full-time ministry
[56:06] or that didn't have a family this was to
[56:11] everybody we all have the same problems
[56:15] we all have jobs in in other
[56:18] responsibilities but it's up to us to
[56:22] make the choice to stay busy for the
[56:25] Lord amen
[56:26] our labor is not in vain I you know I
[56:32] was talking to a brother and he brought
[56:34] up you know brother you have done so
[56:36] much for the Lord he says I remember
[56:39] when you used to send all those semis
[56:41] down
[56:42] well I done well free out about those
[56:47] and I just likely forgot about
[56:50] everything I ever done and I just
[56:53] assumed my right hand not know what the
[56:55] left hand is doing but I'll tell you
[56:57] what God's got a good record of
[57:00] everything I want to stare at what I
[57:05] need to be doing now not what I did back
[57:07] then I want to see Jesus today keep
[57:17] running the race well don't just run the
[57:21] race run it well fight the good fight of
[57:25] faith lay hold of eternal life
[57:28] don't let that virus of unbelief begin
[57:31] to creep in and slow you down from
[57:34] running the race with all your heart
[57:37] Jesus has stuff for you to do yes she
[57:41] does well I don't know what it is it
[57:44] could be right after church walking out
[57:47] and he lay something on your heart to go
[57:49] pray for something call somebody
[57:52] he has a work for us the lady
[57:58] amen amen
[58:02] whenever it would be
[58:04] he's the laborers are few the laborers
[58:10] are few
[58:11] help us Lord
[58:15] don't let anything persuade you from
[58:18] what he has called you to do
[58:23] imagine if the Lord said to me you know
[58:30] I have called you to get a bride ready
[58:36] in Fenton Michigan and I want you to
[58:43] just preach the word that's all you got
[58:46] to do well everything else that I did
[58:49] for the kingdom wouldn't have got done
[58:52] think about it whatever your hands find
[58:59] good to do stayed busy I'm telling you
[59:04] that the virus of unbelief won't about a
[59:06] creep in you did run well who did hinder
[59:14] you from that you should not obey the
[59:17] truth this persuasion cometh not of him
[59:22] that calleth you see the Spirit of Truth
[59:24] is always in a call call you to walk in
[59:28] further truth my my dad never said
[59:37] please don't grow up anymore stay the
[59:40] way you are I'm really happy the way you

[1:00:31] relaxing yeah we're in Laodicea relaxing

[1:00:38] prompt us this is the hour
[1:00:41] Amen let's stand together take a stand
[1:00:47] and don't let Satan's tiny infectious
[1:00:49] agents get in there doubt caused you to
[1:00:53] slow down and be content in an hour work
[1:00:58] God is calling us from separating from
[1:01:02] all unbelief amen amen let's sing we
