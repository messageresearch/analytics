[0:15] test
[0:17] amen praise the
[0:24] Lord so this evening i' just like to
[0:28] start out with just a little
[0:32] quote well now we want to speak as every
[0:35] meeting about Jesus Christ and he's the
[0:39] center of our worship the center of our
[0:42] attraction the center of our life all
[0:46] that we have and want and are and will
[0:49] be is based upon him he was the one who
[0:53] came and gave his life for us came down
[0:56] from God out of glory and was made flesh
[0:59] and dwelt Among Us and taken Upon Us
[1:02] upon him the sin of us all the sickness
[1:05] of us all bore it away to Calvary and
[1:08] there paid the price he's worthy of all
[1:11] praise that can be given him amen let's
[1:15] just SP our heads for a word of
[1:17] prayer dear Lord we're so thankful
[1:21] father Lord that you've set us on a
[1:23] solid
[1:24] rock Heavenly Father we just pray
[1:27] tonight as we gather together Lord that
[1:30] you will bless us with your presence and
[1:32] that you will just come and and that
[1:35] you'll speak to us you'll break the
[1:36] bread of life that you'll speak to each
[1:38] and every need father that's here every
[1:40] heart Lord may we go away father as
[1:43] those on the road to amasis that did not
[1:46] our hearts burn within us as he spoke to
[1:48] us Lord I pray that you just deal with
[1:51] us as Sons and Daughters may you just
[1:54] come and Be Our Guest Lord we love you
[1:56] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen
[2:00] amen no you can't be
[2:02] seated so I'm want to turn to
[2:06] Colossians chapter 2 for our opening
[2:11] scripture
[2:14] amen so want to speak on for just a
[2:17] little while I want to ask you a
[2:19] question What attracted
[2:24] you What attracted you to this message
[2:28] What attracted you
[2:30] out of all the
[2:32] things that you know we're in a the
[2:36] election
[2:37] cycle and everyone is bidding for your
[2:43] attention they want your
[2:47] attraction and but brother brandham said
[2:49] he said so he said we want to talk about
[2:52] Jesus Christ and he's the center of our
[2:56] worship he's the center of our our
[3:00] attraction he's the center of our life
[3:05] and all that we have and want and are
[3:07] and will be is based upon
[3:11] Him amen amen in Colossians chapter 2
[3:16] starting with verse 6 it says and ye
[3:18] have therefore received Christ Jesus the
[3:22] Lord so walk ye in him rooted and built
[3:26] up in him and established in the faith
[3:29] as ye have been taught abouting therein
[3:31] with
[3:32] Thanksgiving beware lest any man spoil
[3:35] you through philosophy and vain deceit
[3:37] after the tradition of men after the
[3:40] runts of the world and not after Christ
[3:43] for in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[3:46] the godhead
[3:47] bodily and ye are complete in
[3:54] him which is the head of all
[3:57] principalities and Power amen you may be
[4:00] seated
[4:01] amen What attracted
[4:05] you what got your
[4:08] attention what what turned you to look
[4:12] towards
[4:14] God
[4:16] Amen because Paul here says when he's
[4:19] writing in the Corinthian Church he says
[4:21] so here you are you in verse six he says
[4:24] you therefore have received Christ Jesus
[4:26] the Lord so walk ye in him root in and
[4:30] built up in him and established in the
[4:32] faith as ye have been taught abounding
[4:35] therein with Thanksgiving in verse 8 he
[4:37] says beware lest any man spoil you
[4:40] through philosophy and vain
[4:43] deceit and your
[4:45] focus has left that which attracted your
[4:49] attention at the
[4:51] beginning in the original it says take
[4:53] care that no one make a prey of
[4:56] you to lead away as booty you know like
[5:00] a pirate steals something and he's he
[5:02] sees something valuable and that's the
[5:05] thing the devil sees something value if
[5:08] you are truly the elect of God then you
[5:11] have a value that the devil wants to get
[5:14] because the devil knows if he can get
[5:16] you then he can get to
[5:17] God if he can get you to fall then he
[5:20] knows I got God's
[5:23] attention and Paul said so take care
[5:25] that no one make a prey of you to lead
[5:27] you away as booty that is figuratively
[5:31] to seduce through philosophy or empty
[5:35] deceit which is
[5:36] delusions according to the tradition of
[5:38] men according to the elements of the
[5:41] world and not according to
[5:44] Christ so you see there in verse 10 it
[5:48] said well verse 9 says for in him
[5:51] dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead
[5:54] bodily and we know that but Paul told
[5:58] the Colossians he says you are complete
[6:02] in
[6:03] him so a government change isn't going
[6:06] to make a
[6:08] difference whether the economy goes up
[6:10] or goes down isn't going to make a
[6:12] difference because something has
[6:15] attracted
[6:16] me and my question is what is it that
[6:20] attracted
[6:21] you or have you been deceived and
[6:25] brought Away by delusional promises and
[6:30] devis
[6:31] fables oh if this could just happen or
[6:34] if this could be if this could be look
[6:36] at I am complete in
[6:39] him
[6:41] Amen in Revelations chapter 2 let's we
[6:45] just take a little bit
[6:47] here
[6:49] Amen in Revelations chapter
[6:52] 2 in verse one it says and unto the
[6:55] angel of the Church of Ephesus write
[6:58] these things saith he that holdeth the
[7:00] Seven Stars in his right hand who
[7:03] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[7:05] candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy
[7:08] labor and thy
[7:11] patience God knows what you're already
[7:14] going
[7:15] through he knows all about the things
[7:17] that you've done and how that you cannot
[7:20] bear them which are evil he knows that
[7:22] he recognizes that and that thou has
[7:25] tried them which say they are Apostles
[7:28] and are not and has found them Liars we
[7:30] know all
[7:34] that so the angel the spirit of God in
[7:38] the Ephesian Church age was looking at
[7:40] the people and trying to encourage them
[7:44] and he said and you've born and you've
[7:47] has patience and for my name's sake has
[7:50] labored and has not fainted he says but
[7:53] even in in the midst of all of that and
[7:55] all the good things that you've done he
[7:57] says in verse four nevertheless I have
[7:59] somewhat against thee because thou Hast
[8:03] left thy First
[8:05] Love whatever it was that attracted you
[8:09] you got your go your eyes off of
[8:12] it whatever it was and you're the only
[8:15] one that can answer
[8:18] that I mean I've seen a lot of things in
[8:20] my life short
[8:23] Lifetime and I've seen people come and
[8:26] go and and you know some people they
[8:28] come in and they're like they like
[8:29] they're on fire and everything else and
[8:31] everything else and we just and after a
[8:33] while you watch them kind of cool down
[8:35] and everything and then next thing you
[8:37] know they're
[8:38] gone What attracted
[8:42] them What attracted
[8:45] them he says so he says nevertheless I
[8:48] have somewhat against thee because thou
[8:49] Hast left thy First Love remember
[8:52] therefore from when thou art Fallen what
[8:55] was it that attracted you
[9:00] what was
[9:03] it I
[9:06] mean God pre-ordained every footstep in
[9:10] my
[9:14] life every step every mistake everything
[9:18] he knew everything and when the time
[9:21] came that he came and when the fullness
[9:24] of time came and he called something
[9:27] attracted my attention
[9:30] and it's kept me
[9:33] amen he says because if you have lost
[9:37] the attraction if if the center of your
[9:40] focus has changed from the
[9:44] goal which is Jesus
[9:47] Christ if your vision is not on
[9:51] that you need to repent and do the first
[9:56] works or else I will come unto thee
[9:58] quickly and remove that Candlestick out
[10:00] of his place except thou
[10:03] repent back in 1954 brother Brennon was
[10:05] preaching in the seven Church ages and
[10:07] he did it all in one night it was kind
[10:09] of
[10:10] interesting he says what's the matter
[10:12] with this Tabernacle a man ought to be
[10:15] able to say when you meet a man and you
[10:17] say is your Christian experience when
[10:20] was it the dearest to
[10:23] you and you ought to be able to say
[10:25] right
[10:27] now that's what you should say
[10:30] well my best experience was back when I
[10:33] first got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[10:35] when I come that was the best time I
[10:38] ever had brother Brenham said well
[10:40] brother you have fallen from Grace
[10:42] that's
[10:44] right
[10:46] amen amen because you left your first
[10:50] love
[10:52] showing that you had something in the
[10:56] beginning there was something that
[10:58] attracted Ed your attention you seized
[11:01] on it but then you set it
[11:04] aside you left
[11:07] it you left
[11:09] it brother mam says so it's not he that
[11:12] Beth but he that endureth to the
[11:15] end the same shall be saved not he all
[11:18] that saith Lord Lord but the one that
[11:20] doeth the will of my father oh let me
[11:22] just let that soak in just a few
[11:25] minutes when I was thinking about that
[11:27] scripture I was thinking about he came
[11:30] so far from
[11:32] glory to save a Wretch like
[11:35] Me There is something so precious in you
[11:41] that God himself would Veil himself in
[11:45] flesh and then when he went to the
[11:48] Garden of gethy after he had washed all
[11:51] their feet and he had broke bread with
[11:53] them and and fed them the wine and
[11:56] everything and and gave them all them
[11:58] wonderful words and they had had no idea
[12:00] what was going to happen the rest of
[12:01] that
[12:02] night they're all looking at each other
[12:05] and and and you know Jesus told them he
[12:07] say so somebody's going to betray me
[12:09] somebody's going to lose the mark
[12:11] they're going to walk away and and that
[12:13] was so out of their focus so out of
[12:17] their mind that each one each one Peter
[12:20] James John Timothy every one of them
[12:24] said is it I
[12:29] and when they got in the
[12:31] garden Jesus knowing the scriptures that
[12:35] had been written about
[12:37] him knew that he had to go in a place
[12:43] and completely lay down his life and
[12:47] accept what the scriptures said that was
[12:51] about to happen to
[12:55] him Peter he thought oh this this is I
[12:58] got I got the solution I got I figured
[13:01] it out I bought a sword today and if
[13:03] they come after you Lord I'm I'm going
[13:05] to I'm going to slice every one of them
[13:07] I'm GNA get them right down to the right
[13:09] size because they're not going to get
[13:10] you unless they kill me
[13:15] first and Jesus told him he said Peter
[13:18] he says you've lost your first you've
[13:21] the
[13:23] attraction see the attraction isn't you
[13:28] it's him
[13:30] am you aren't even sitting here of your
[13:33] own
[13:34] [Laughter]
[13:36] choice he attracted
[13:39] me and it hasn't let go
[13:43] yet praise the Lord amen
[13:47] amen he said Lord he says not the one
[13:50] that doeth or but the one that doeth the
[13:52] will of my father oh let that just soak
[13:54] in a few minutes he says I was talking
[13:57] fast tonight anyhow so let us
[13:59] let's just think about that for a few
[14:01] minutes he that doeth the will of my
[14:03] father he that endureth to the end he
[14:06] that endureth and to endure means to
[14:11] remain to Bear
[14:13] trials to have
[14:15] fortitude to
[14:18] persevere to abide to patiently
[14:24] suffer What attracted
[14:27] you because all these things are going
[14:29] to come your way and if you aren't
[14:33] attached to whatever attracted to you
[14:36] you'll
[14:37] leave if it's vain philosophy that got
[14:40] you in here it will take you out if it's
[14:44] some delusional idea of what you think
[14:46] Jesus Christ is you will
[14:49] leave
[14:50] amen
[14:52] Amen brother brandom in a message called
[14:55] Discerning the body of the Lord he said
[14:56] Paul promised now this quote I wrote
[15:00] down all the scriptures but brother
[15:02] brandom put all these scriptures
[15:04] together in one
[15:06] place Paul promised that in the last
[15:08] days by the holy spirit that the church
[15:10] would fall away millions of them and
[15:13] that's in 2 Thessalonians
[15:15] 2:3 he said they'll fall away but we
[15:19] think they'll fall away into the world
[15:21] when actually they're following away
[15:23] into a form of
[15:25] godliness
[15:27] amen he said for there will come a
[15:29] falling away for many will be heady
[15:31] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[15:34] lovers of God truth Breakers false
[15:36] accusers incontinent and despisers of
[15:39] those that are good and he's and brother
[15:41] Brandon because he's preaching
[15:42] Discerning the body of the Lord he says
[15:44] that is not the right
[15:46] discernment so he takes in this one
[15:49] little statement 2 Thessalonians 2:3
[15:53] where he said there's going to be a
[15:54] fallen away then he say second Timothy 3
[15:58] and then he takes 1 Corinthians
[16:00] 11 and he puts them all together to
[16:03] paint a picture what is the
[16:07] attraction I got to put a sign up in my
[16:09] front yard who I support and everything
[16:11] else what is the
[16:15] attraction if you are tied up in all
[16:18] these things of the world and what's
[16:20] going on over here or over there you
[16:23] know those people you there's one place
[16:25] where Jesus the disciples came to Jesus
[16:27] and they were talking to him and he said
[16:28] said do you think that when that Tower
[16:31] fell down and those guys died that it
[16:33] was they were greater Sinners than the
[16:35] rest of
[16:37] you do you think that those people in
[16:40] North Carolina were
[16:44] unbelievers that they weren't going to
[16:47] church somewhere maybe the Baptist maybe
[16:49] they were they were old-fashioned snake
[16:51] handlers I was accused of being a snake
[16:53] Handler
[16:54] once guy said I know who you are Bruce I
[16:57] said what's that he says you're one of
[16:58] them snake handlers I said yeah I said
[17:02] I'm going to bring them in tomorrow at
[17:03] work
[17:04] okay we'll handle some
[17:08] snakes you see those people didn't know
[17:12] Jesus said he said they built their Rock
[17:14] they built their house and he said when
[17:16] the floods
[17:17] came it swept them
[17:20] away the days back in Noah's time Jesus
[17:24] talked about in Matthew 24 he says they
[17:26] were eating and drinking and they were
[17:28] having a great time they thought they
[17:30] were safe up there oh look at what's
[17:32] going on down here in Florida oh I think
[17:34] I'm safe up here well we're going to
[17:36] read some more scriptures what is it
[17:39] that attracted
[17:43] you
[17:45] amen let's go to Second Timothy chapter
[17:50] 3
[17:54] amen so second Timothy chapter 3 and
[17:57] this is a really familiar scripture
[17:58] brother John reads it a lot but the very
[18:02] first verse says this know that in the
[18:05] last days perilous times shall come so
[18:09] why are you even delusional to think
[18:12] that the changing of a government you're
[18:14] somehow going to be
[18:16] blessed why would you even believe that
[18:20] and then sit and argue with somebody
[18:22] else about who's which candidate they
[18:24] support or how this one's going to do
[18:27] this and that one's going to do that and
[18:28] there you are complete in Jesus Christ
[18:31] and him
[18:34] alone him
[18:37] alone Paul in this book which shall not
[18:42] fail said in the last days perilous
[18:44] times will
[18:46] come and Men shall be lovers of their
[18:48] own
[18:49] selves Covetous
[18:52] boolers I can fix it proud I'm the one
[19:00] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[19:02] unthankful Unholy without natural
[19:05] affection truce
[19:07] Breakers or they're going to shake your
[19:10] hand in the front and stab you in the
[19:11] back yeah false accusers incontinent
[19:15] Fierce despisers of those that are good
[19:17] traitors heady highminded lovers of
[19:20] pleasure more than lovers of God having
[19:23] a form of
[19:25] godliness but denying the power
[19:30] thereof from such turn away and we think
[19:34] the power is of laying on of hands or
[19:38] maybe speaking in tongues or seeing
[19:40] visions but the power that brother
[19:42] brandham talked about was the power of
[19:44] the Holy Ghost coming on you and turning
[19:47] you into a real
[19:51] Christian
[19:54] Amen brother ROM says well he says oh
[19:58] you say well that's a
[20:00] communist that's so-called Christians
[20:03] watch the next verse having a form of
[20:06] godliness but denying the power thereof
[20:07] they have no spiritual
[20:10] discernment because when you got
[20:12] spiritual discernment and the Holy Ghost
[20:14] is upon you you have spiritual
[20:17] discernment and it will say Amen to
[20:20] every promise of God but Paul said those
[20:24] days would be here and we got it it's
[20:27] here it's on us and we look and see it
[20:29] and we hear it from everywhere and US
[20:34] oldtimers us old gray-haired timers will
[20:37] tell you it is a lot different than what
[20:40] it was in the
[20:42] 80s this world is a lot different Don
[20:46] and I were talking about that we were
[20:47] driving home on Sunday I said you know I
[20:49] said it was a lot different before I got
[20:52] a phone stuck in my
[20:55] pocket and the promise of all the the
[20:58] knowledge of the world will be at your
[21:00] fingertips and every delusional lie and
[21:03] fr anything to change and and I'm
[21:07] telling you right
[21:11] now I am telling you right now so I was
[21:14] it team manager for 23 years and I
[21:16] remember when we first got the internet
[21:18] at our company and we had it tightly
[21:21] controlled we only had three or four
[21:22] different people getting it but then as
[21:25] it grew and we studied more people I
[21:28] would have
[21:29] problems people would mess up their
[21:31] computers and then they'd say well we
[21:33] don't know what happened and then I
[21:36] would go on the internet back then it
[21:38] was ask geves or there's there's been
[21:41] millions of Google's nothing there's
[21:43] they they had been around for forever
[21:46] and I'd and I'd say okay this is the
[21:49] problem with the computer I need to know
[21:51] what to do and I'd have 25 answers of
[21:54] what was wrong with that computer and
[21:56] now instead of me just saying hm maybe
[21:58] should just unplug it and plug it back
[22:00] in I got to go through
[22:02] 24 answers to see whether they're
[22:06] telling me the truth or whether they're
[22:07] lying to me because what vested interest
[22:11] do they have in my
[22:13] future the problem is is that when you
[22:15] get all carried away and forget what it
[22:19] is that attracted
[22:22] you you don't have the time or the brain
[22:25] that's big enough to find out who's
[22:27] telling you the the truth and who's
[22:31] lying Paul said take heed L you become a
[22:36] prey that somebody pulls you
[22:40] away
[22:43] amen
[22:45] amen Paul said those days would be here
[22:49] what do we do it ought to draw us
[22:53] together the Bible said assembling
[22:55] ourselves together and that the more
[22:57] when you see the day approaching and it
[22:59] ought to be one Revival after another
[23:00] and bonfires of God's glory built in
[23:03] every Church in every place well I can
[23:05] see he was talking about this is back in
[23:09] 1959 but we know now that we're not in
[23:12] that age anymore we're not in that time
[23:15] anymore because the world rejected Jesus
[23:19] Christ they put him
[23:21] out they put him out this this country
[23:25] is not going back to God Amen this
[23:28] country is going to some place that you
[23:31] are not going to
[23:33] like and it's probably not what I'm
[23:40] thinking a great coming together where
[23:43] all the churches with one heart one
[23:45] Accord assembling ourselves together and
[23:48] forget their man-made Theology and cry
[23:50] out to God for Spiritual power and
[23:53] spiritual
[23:54] discernment that's the hour that we need
[23:59] let's go to Second
[24:01] Peter chapter
[24:03] 3 praise the
[24:11] Lord second Peter chapter 3 so this is
[24:15] this is where brother brandham he took
[24:17] some of these scriptures also so is
[24:20] Peter is writing he says this Second
[24:21] Epistle beloved I now write unto you in
[24:24] both which I stir up your pure Minds by
[24:27] way of remembering
[24:29] remember what is it that attracted
[24:34] you what was the
[24:38] attraction that you may be mindful of
[24:41] The Words which were spoken before by
[24:43] the holy prophets and of the Commandment
[24:45] of us the apostles and the Lord and
[24:47] Savior knowing that first that there
[24:49] shall come in the last days
[24:52] scoffers walking after their own lust or
[24:55] their own desires a scoffer is a derider
[24:58] or a false teacher or a
[25:02] mocker and saying where is the
[25:05] promise of his coming for since the
[25:08] fathers fell asleep all things continue
[25:11] as they were from the beginning of the
[25:12] creation for this they willingly are
[25:16] ignorant that by the word of God the
[25:18] heavens were of old and the Earth was
[25:20] standing out of the water and in the
[25:22] water verse five Peter tells them there
[25:26] was a time
[25:28] when people did not
[25:31] respect what God had
[25:33] done Genesis 1:1 says in the beginning
[25:37] God created the heavens and the Earth
[25:39] and he created the Earth and when he was
[25:42] done everything that he did he said it
[25:45] is good the next it is good it is good
[25:48] and when he was done he rested and the
[25:50] Earth was in the water and out of the
[25:54] water amen but they were willingly
[25:58] ignorant of one
[26:01] thing whereby the world that then verse
[26:04] six says whereby the world that then
[26:09] was being overflowed with
[26:13] water
[26:15] perished they were willingly ignorant
[26:19] that they were not the pilot of their
[26:22] own
[26:24] ship God destroyed the world
[26:31] Noah not by his own choosing was
[26:38] saved what is it that attracted
[26:45] you but the heavens and the Earth which
[26:48] are
[26:49] now by the same word are kept in store
[26:53] reserved unto fire against the day of
[26:56] judgment and predition of ungodly men
[27:00] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[27:02] thing that one day is with the Lord as a
[27:04] thousand years and a thousand years as
[27:06] one day and the Lord is not slack
[27:09] concerning his promise a politician
[27:12] could promise you the whole
[27:15] world and he's just one part of the
[27:19] team that's the way it is set up around
[27:21] here but some people seem to think that
[27:23] oh my guy he'll fix it
[27:29] they're willingly ignorant that God
[27:32] destroyed the Earth and that God already
[27:35] said the world's going to get destroyed
[27:37] again
[27:40] amen and the Lord is not slack
[27:43] concerning his promise as some men count
[27:46] slackness but his longsuffering to us
[27:49] word not willing that any should perish
[27:52] but that all should come to
[27:54] repentance Amen in the rapture message
[27:58] brother Brandon he says so now we see
[28:00] that the reason that this subject is so
[28:03] lightened at or the idea of a Rapture of
[28:06] a body change it's so lightened at is
[28:10] because that the prophet here has said
[28:11] that in the last days these scoffers
[28:14] would come saying these things see it's
[28:17] predicted the reason the people are
[28:19] acting today the way they're
[28:22] acting why you see certainly you should
[28:25] be expecting it
[28:28] because the Bible said that in the last
[28:31] day they're going to be heav high-minded
[28:34] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[28:36] God truth Breakers false accusers
[28:38] incontinent despisers of those that are
[28:41] good having a form of godliness and
[28:43] denying the power thereof from
[28:46] such turn
[28:50] away What attracted you
[28:58] or as your focus gone in another
[29:03] Direction because I already read in
[29:05] Colossians you are complete in
[29:09] Christ everything I
[29:12] have that beginning
[29:15] quote brother Brenham said he should be
[29:17] the center of our worship he should be
[29:20] the center of our
[29:22] attraction he should be the center of
[29:24] our
[29:25] life all that we have and want and are
[29:31] and all that we will become should be
[29:34] based on him and him
[29:38] alone
[29:42] amen amen praise the
[29:46] Lord denying the power thereof from such
[29:49] turn away this is still in a Rapture
[29:51] it's paragraph
[29:53] 33 and and I'm telling you what
[29:55] paragraph it is so that if you go what
[29:59] false accusers and Conant despisers of
[30:02] those that are good having a form of
[30:04] godliness and denying the power thereof
[30:07] from such turn away can we look for an
[30:10] impersonation of
[30:15] Truth an impersonation of
[30:18] truth and the prophet said certainly
[30:23] can What attracted
[30:26] you What attracted
[30:29] you I want you to take a look here at
[30:32] Deuteronomy Deuteronomy
[30:35] [Music]
[30:36] 11 praise the Lord
[30:45] amen in Deuteronomy 11 starting in verse
[30:48] 10 it says for the land where thou goest
[30:52] in to possess
[30:53] it is not as the land of Egypt
[30:58] from whence you came out where you s the
[31:01] seed and watered it with thy foot in the
[31:03] garden of
[31:04] herbs he's telling us that when we were
[31:07] back in the world we lived in Egypt and
[31:11] we did whatever we like the leaks and
[31:13] the onions and we did whatever the devil
[31:15] told us to do because we were slaves to
[31:17] Pharaoh but now we've come out because
[31:20] something has attracted our attention
[31:23] but when we were in that life in that
[31:26] world we we were the ones that planted
[31:29] the seed we are the ones that toiled the
[31:32] ground and and got the weeds pulled the
[31:34] weeds and everything else and watered
[31:36] the seed and watched it carefully
[31:39] watched it come up so that we could have
[31:41] fruit for our
[31:43] labors that's what we did back in
[31:46] Egypt everything was us everything was
[31:50] what I could get out of
[31:52] it because that's what we did back in
[31:56] Egypt verse 11 says says but the land
[31:59] where ye go to
[32:01] possess it is a land of Hills and
[32:04] Valleys and drinketh water of the rain
[32:07] of
[32:10] Heaven that's not in your
[32:13] control the land where you're going once
[32:17] you come out of
[32:18] Egypt and you go into the promised land
[32:22] it's a varied land it's beautiful it's
[32:24] got Hills and Valleys it's got ups and
[32:26] downs and it gets watered by the water
[32:29] of
[32:31] Heaven A Land which the Lord thy God
[32:35] carth
[32:38] for the eyes of the Lord thy God are
[32:41] always upon it from the beginning of the
[32:44] year even unto the end of the year when
[32:47] I came out of Egypt and came into the
[32:49] promised
[32:51] land god watched over that Land from the
[32:55] day of my new birth until the day he
[32:58] takes me
[33:00] home
[33:02] amen and it shall come to
[33:05] pass look at verse 13 He says and it
[33:07] shall come to pass if you shall leave
[33:10] your first
[33:12] love if you shall hearken diligently
[33:15] unto my Commandments which I command you
[33:17] this day to love the Lord your God and
[33:20] to serve him with all of your heart and
[33:22] with all of your soul whatever it was
[33:25] that got your attention at the beginning
[33:29] think about
[33:31] it cuz Moses tells them he says God
[33:36] requires you to serve him with all of
[33:38] your heart and with all of your soul
[33:41] that I will give you the reign of your
[33:43] land in its due season the first rain
[33:47] the latter rain that thou mayest Gather
[33:50] in thy corn and thy wine and thine oil
[33:54] God will
[33:55] provide everything that you have need of
[33:59] ye are complete in
[34:04] him what is your focus What attracted
[34:11] you and I will send grass in thy fields
[34:14] for thy cattle that thou mayest eat and
[34:16] be full take heed to yourselves that
[34:20] your heart be not deceived and you turn
[34:24] aside and serve other gods and worship
[34:31] them cuz God's brought you into a land
[34:34] of milk and
[34:35] honey God has brought you into a special
[34:39] place because I'm telling you this this
[34:44] message is not an appealing
[34:47] message Jesus Christ Isaiah said he had
[34:52] no
[34:53] beauty that we would desire him
[34:58] this message doesn't have desirable
[35:01] features but something caught my
[35:06] attention and it won't let me go it
[35:10] won't let me serve other gods it won't
[35:14] let me even though I see all these
[35:16] things happening it won't turn me away
[35:20] from who that is that attracted my
[35:23] attention
[35:26] amen because look at he says in verse 17
[35:29] he says cuz if you start serving other
[35:31] gods well then the Lord's wrath will be
[35:33] kindled against you and he'll shut up
[35:36] the heaven that there'll be no rain and
[35:39] that the L the land yield not her fruit
[35:42] andless you perish quickly from off the
[35:44] good land which the lord giveth you and
[35:47] how's that happen when you lose the
[35:50] focus of what got your attention
[35:59] therefore therefore shall you lay up
[36:02] these my words in your heart and in your
[36:07] soul and bind them for a sign upon your
[36:10] hand that you may be as frontlets
[36:12] between your
[36:13] eyes don't ever
[36:17] forget heavens and earth will pass away
[36:20] but this word will never
[36:24] fail this word this God that that called
[36:28] me called you brought you out of the
[36:31] world brought you out of Egypt and
[36:33] brought you into this goodly
[36:36] land he watches over you
[36:40] am Jesus said he got there he cried he
[36:43] says oh Jerusalem Jerusalem he says I
[36:46] would have done so much for you but
[36:49] you're so stiff necked you think you got
[36:53] to have something to do about what your
[36:55] future is about when you are complete in
[36:58] me he says I would have come in and
[37:01] brooded over you like a mother as her
[37:03] chicks I would have been your buckler I
[37:06] would have been the one but he says now
[37:07] your day is
[37:12] passed
[37:15] amen
[37:17] amen you shall teach them your children
[37:20] speaking of them when thou sest in thine
[37:22] house and when thou west by the way when
[37:25] thou liest down and when thou risest up
[37:27] and thou shalt write them upon the
[37:29] doorposts of thine house and upon thy
[37:31] Gates and we've gotten so we've gotten
[37:34] so
[37:36] oh you know the uh hidic Jew I think
[37:40] that was called it's the Orthodox Jew he
[37:43] read all these scriptures because he was
[37:45] devoted to Moses so he made a little box
[37:47] and he'd put a little scroll in and he'd
[37:50] tie it around his head and he said there
[37:51] it is it's a frontlet before my eyes and
[37:53] then then he'd put the manora on the
[37:55] front door by the doorpost and when he
[37:57] goes every time in his house he touches
[37:59] the word of God God doesn't want you to
[38:01] do that he wants to come down and dwell
[38:04] inside of his people he wants to be a
[38:07] written epistle in you and not what you
[38:10] think it should be he will live through
[38:13] you he will send you the former rain and
[38:16] the latter rain in its season but you
[38:18] got to keep your focus on him what
[38:22] attracted
[38:25] you what was the
[38:34] attraction that your days might be
[38:37] multiplied and the days of your children
[38:39] in the land that the Lord swear unto
[38:41] your fathers to give them as the days of
[38:44] Heaven upon the Earth for if you shall
[38:46] diligently keep all these Commandments
[38:48] which I command you and to do them and
[38:50] to love the Lord your God to walk in all
[38:53] of his ways and to cleave unto him then
[38:56] will the Lord Drive out all these
[38:58] nations from before
[39:02] you some people they just have all kinds
[39:05] of problems because they're not looking
[39:07] in the right
[39:09] place they've lost their
[39:12] focus but when I'm complete in Christ he
[39:16] will take care of every trial every
[39:19] Temptation every
[39:22] sickness it will do
[39:26] it he will will do it he will take care
[39:29] of
[39:31] it
[39:33] amen every place wherein The Souls of
[39:36] your feet shall tread shall be yours
[39:39] from the Wilderness of Lebanon from this
[39:41] River from the river of Euphrates even
[39:43] under the uppermost sea shall be your
[39:45] coast and there shall no man be able to
[39:48] stand before you for the Lord your God
[39:51] shall lay the fear of you and the dread
[39:54] of you upon all the land that you shall
[39:57] read upon as Heath said unto you and I
[40:01] used to work with a
[40:03] machinist Avery I did a lot of things
[40:06] with Avery but you know I failed the
[40:08] biggest test I didn't testify to him
[40:10] about
[40:12] God but I'd go and work on his car and
[40:14] I'd just give him little things and
[40:16] everything one day he came to me he said
[40:17] Bruce he said you scare the Daylights
[40:19] out of me I said why is that Avery he
[40:22] says cuz I know he says I've seen you
[40:26] and he says I know he says if you start
[40:28] talking to me about God he says I'm
[40:30] going to get change my life and serve
[40:37] him that's not my testimony that was a
[40:40] testimony of a he Tite or a
[40:44] jebusite you see what attracted
[40:48] you what is it that you think this
[40:50] message is about what is it that you
[40:53] want out of
[40:55] God Amen
[40:58] amen
[41:01] amen praise God
[41:05] Amen let's see I
[41:10] got yes so verse 25 he says so no man
[41:13] shall be able to stand before you for
[41:15] the Lord your God shall lay the fear of
[41:17] you and the dread of you upon all the
[41:21] land that you shall tread upon as Heath
[41:23] said unto
[41:25] you what a TR
[41:28] you let's go to Exodus
[41:32] 23 so it seems like the promises of God
[41:36] are so yay and amen that well we
[41:39] shouldn't have any problems right we
[41:41] shouldn't have any we shouldn't have any
[41:43] failures we I I've given my heart to the
[41:46] Lord and and I'm serving him I'm serving
[41:50] him the best I know how I and and still
[41:53] things go
[41:56] wrong well I'm sure the next government
[41:59] will take care of
[42:02] it but that's what a lot of people
[42:08] believe what attracted
[42:12] you well I believe that the word of God
[42:16] has got an answer for every question
[42:19] concerning my
[42:21] life so you may not know about these
[42:23] scriptures in Exodus 23 I didn't
[42:27] I need to read
[42:28] more and you shall s this is verse 25
[42:32] and you shall serve the Lord your God
[42:34] and he shall bless thy bread and thy
[42:35] water and I will take sickness away from
[42:38] the midst of
[42:39] thee and there shall be nothing cast and
[42:43] there shall nothing cast their young
[42:45] near be Barren in the land the number of
[42:47] thy days I will fulfill and I will send
[42:50] my fear before thee and I will destroy
[42:52] all the people to whom Thou shalt come
[42:54] and I will make all of thine enemies
[42:56] turn their backs unto thee and I will
[42:58] send Hornets before thee which should
[43:00] drive out the Hite and the Canaanite and
[43:02] the hites from before thee this sounds
[43:05] great I'll take
[43:07] it say
[43:10] Amen but the next verse he says I will
[43:14] not drive them out from before thee all
[43:17] at
[43:21] once I I'm going to do
[43:24] that I can but I'm not
[43:28] yes you could never have a cold you
[43:30] could never have a broken leg you could
[43:32] never have a tooth fall out yes you
[43:35] could be perfect health your whole life
[43:37] but I'm not going to do
[43:42] that
[43:44] lest your life the land becomes
[43:50] desolate if I was to if I if you were so
[43:54] if you never had a failure if you never
[43:55] made a mistake if you never lost your
[43:57] temper if you never fell down and got
[43:59] hurt if you never had a toach he said
[44:02] your life would be
[44:05] desolate remember what endureth endureth
[44:09] to the end
[44:10] means patiently endure
[44:14] Affliction that the land the the
[44:17] blessings of God came when Jesus was
[44:20] smitten at
[44:22] Calvary we couldn't partake of the Holy
[44:25] Ghost until he was with willing to
[44:29] die we could not take we could not enjoy
[44:33] the blessings of healing until the 30
[44:36] Stripes were laid on his
[44:38] back because the scripture says by his
[44:41] stripes ye are
[44:44] healed the blessings of God comes with a
[44:48] singleness of eye on what it is that
[44:52] attracted
[44:54] you amen
[45:01] lest the land become desolate and the
[45:03] beasts of the field multiply against
[45:07] thee yeah now I
[45:11] see now I see what he was
[45:15] doing he wants to make me into an image
[45:19] that he'd be proud
[45:23] of by little and little I will drive
[45:25] them out br for thee until thou be
[45:29] increased and can inherit the
[45:33] land your faith will grow with every
[45:38] trial your gra Your Grace will
[45:41] grow your mercy on your fellow Believers
[45:45] Your Grace your love it will grow with
[45:48] every battle that you you
[45:52] win so what is it that attracted you you
[45:55] think oh my if I could just if if I
[45:57] could don't be drawn
[46:01] away by delusional promises or
[46:04] philosophies or the rudiments of this
[46:08] world because I am complete in
[46:13] Christ
[46:17] amen verse 31 says and I will set the
[46:19] bounds from the Red Sea even unto the
[46:22] Sea of the Philistines and from the
[46:23] desert under the river for I will
[46:25] deliver the inhabitants the land into
[46:28] your hand and thou shalt drive them out
[46:31] before thee so everything that you're
[46:33] having trouble overcoming the scripture
[46:36] right there said God's going to take
[46:38] care of it and he'll only take care of
[46:41] it if you serve him with your whole
[46:46] heart if you've lost the
[46:50] attraction or if the wrong thing if you
[46:54] came here and it was the wrong thing
[46:58] verse 32 says Thou shalt make no
[47:01] Covenant with them nor with their
[47:09] gods they shall not dwell in thy land
[47:13] lest they make thee sin against me for
[47:17] if thou serve their gods it will surely
[47:21] become a snare unto
[47:24] thee what attracted
[47:34] you in 1953 brother Brandon was
[47:37] preaching this message he says now look
[47:38] God said I'm not going to give it to you
[47:40] all at one time if I give it to you all
[47:43] at once if I do then the whole land will
[47:45] be swept bare and then the wild beasts
[47:47] will multiply against you and will
[47:49] overcome you I'm just going to give you
[47:50] it to you a little by little as you're
[47:52] able to possess the land I'm just going
[47:55] to drive them out and give it to you
[47:56] little by little
[47:59] amen
[48:02] amen praise the
[48:05] Lord let's look at Exodus
[48:09] 3 now that we
[48:15] see Exodus 3 verse one it says so Moses
[48:19] kept the flock of Jethro his
[48:20] father-in-law the priest of Midian and
[48:23] he led the flocks to the backside of the
[48:25] desert and he came to the Mountain of
[48:26] God even to Horeb and the angel of the
[48:29] Lord appeared unto him in a flame of
[48:31] fire out of the midst of the Bush and he
[48:34] looked it got his
[48:38] attention something attracted
[48:43] Moses and he looked and behold the bush
[48:46] burned with fire and the Bush was not
[48:48] consumed and Moses said I will now turn
[48:51] aside and see this great sight why the
[48:55] bush is not
[49:00] burn in 1954 brother bam said so you see
[49:03] Moses had been a bitter
[49:07] failure because he was in Egypt and just
[49:10] like it said there in the
[49:12] scriptures he watered his he planted the
[49:15] seed he watered the land he had it all
[49:17] figured out he his mama had told him he
[49:20] raised on his mama that that he was
[49:23] elect he was the he was the deliverer he
[49:26] planted he did all them things he was
[49:28] good at school he had a harvest he did
[49:31] again he went down he conquered in
[49:33] Ethiopia he was a great General he
[49:35] worked around he worked in and
[49:36] everything else but when he got into
[49:38] God's land that don't work no
[49:41] more and for him to go into the promised
[49:44] land God said Moses I can't use you like
[49:47] that so I'm just going to let you go on
[49:50] your own
[49:52] way till you fall flat on your face and
[49:55] he did
[49:57] and Moses had been a bitter failure but
[50:00] out there now we see his attention was
[50:04] attracted to a burning bush and he looks
[50:08] to the burning bush to find out what the
[50:13] trouble
[50:15] was
[50:17] maybe what you should be doing is going
[50:21] back to your first love and look at what
[50:23] attracted you and ask him for some
[50:32] answers instead of Googling it or seeing
[50:35] what Instagram or your Facebook feed or
[50:40] whatever he says his attention was
[50:42] attracted to a burning bush and he looks
[50:45] he looks to the burning bush to find out
[50:48] what the trouble was and as he was
[50:50] walking close to it fire usually brings
[50:54] an
[50:55] attention an attract
[50:57] rtion and usually the Holy Spirit when
[51:01] it comes in a manner of fire attracts
[51:04] the attention of
[51:06] people and when Moses turned aside to
[51:08] consider the Burning Tree that would not
[51:10] burn up God spoke to him in a fresh
[51:13] Vision By An
[51:15] Angel now watch Faith take hold right
[51:20] quick that word that promise to
[51:25] Abraham the those things that he had
[51:27] been taught by his mother were dead
[51:30] letters but when he met the burning bush
[51:34] the word of God went from dead letter to
[51:37] being
[51:39] alive and when it became alive Moses
[51:43] stepped right into the scriptures and
[51:46] acted out the mighty hand of
[51:50] God he couldn't do that because his
[51:53] attention was not on the right
[51:55] attraction
[51:59] brothers sisters come on what attracted
[52:03] you and what are you looking at
[52:06] now what is your
[52:12] focus watch Faith take hold right quick
[52:15] the old things are passed away but Moses
[52:18] now has a new vision he forgot all about
[52:21] his
[52:21] learning he forgot all about his
[52:24] victories he forgot all about Egypt
[52:26] every everything changed Moses Moses who
[52:29] was running from Pharaoh said okay I'm
[52:32] going to run back to
[52:37] Pharaoh that's
[52:43] Insanity because he had a new vision he
[52:46] had a revelation he had an experience he
[52:49] had met God he talked to God before that
[52:53] he had not met God he'd only read about
[52:56] God he only knowed what his mother had
[52:58] told him and by hearing what his mother
[53:00] had said or hearing what the pastor had
[53:02] said but now Moses has a personal
[53:06] experience What attracted
[53:15] you
[53:17] amen let's go here to Genesis
[53:22] 3 amen
[53:27] Genesis 3:1 it says so now the serpent
[53:31] was more subtle than any beast of the
[53:34] field which the Lord God had made and he
[53:37] said unto the woman y hath God said You
[53:40] shall not eat of every tree of the
[53:41] garden and I just wonder you know Eve I
[53:46] don't think she was a bad
[53:50] person because there was no bad in
[53:54] Eve because she came out of Adam
[53:57] and there was no sin in
[53:59] Adam but when she saw the
[54:02] beauty of his Timber and his colors and
[54:06] and we all know the scriptures you know
[54:07] and and how how beautiful he
[54:11] looked how could anything this beautiful
[54:14] with hope and love and everything how
[54:17] could it hurt
[54:22] me has not God said we can eat of every
[54:25] tree of the
[54:27] garden and the woman said unto the
[54:29] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[54:31] Trees of the
[54:33] garden but the word of God says the
[54:36] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[54:38] of the garden God has said you should
[54:39] not eat of it neither shall you touch it
[54:42] lest you
[54:45] die her Focus was about to
[54:51] change and the serpent said unto the
[54:54] woman nah
[54:57] I'm going to make you a
[55:01] booty I'm going to draw you away by
[55:04] delusional
[55:06] promises vain
[55:08] philosophy I'm gonna I'm gonna there's
[55:11] you know there's a better way brother
[55:14] sister we just do this things are going
[55:17] to work out good if we just things will
[55:21] get better if we just
[55:28] for God does know that in the day that
[55:31] you eat thereof your eyes will be open
[55:34] and you should be God's knowing good and
[55:36] evil well who doesn't want to know
[55:39] that everything that comes across my
[55:42] phone I want to know whether it's good
[55:44] or evil what's wrong with that I want to
[55:46] know if this guy's lying or not what's
[55:49] wrong with that if it ain't in the word
[55:50] of God why are you even chasing
[55:53] it what is your focus
[56:00] and the Bible says and when the woman
[56:02] saw that the tree was good for food and
[56:06] it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree
[56:09] was to be desired to make one
[56:13] wise she took of the fruit thereof and
[56:16] she ate and she gave also unto her
[56:19] husband with her and he did
[56:21] eat and Satan's Eden brother brandham
[56:24] said
[56:26] but he won it fairily in Eve in the
[56:28] Garden of Eden by the lust of Eve for
[56:33] sin what the lust of
[56:38] Eve the Lust For Eve of
[56:42] sin then if Eve lusted for
[56:46] knowledge it was
[56:48] sin and in the uncertain sound brother
[56:51] brandham said so you see sin is
[56:55] attractive
[56:57] to get your
[57:01] attention sin is attractive to the human
[57:04] being because he's a subject of a fallen
[57:06] race that we are it's attractive Satan
[57:09] knows how to make it attractive he's a
[57:11] genius at his job and he and if he can't
[57:14] get you out there in the world affairs
[57:16] he'll bring it right into the church he
[57:18] comes right over on our own ground he
[57:21] gets on our own ground that's the reason
[57:23] brothers sisters we should recognize him
[57:26] it's time that the church was spiritual
[57:29] enough to recognize and know
[57:37] God not the Creed not the denomination
[57:41] but by experience being filled with the
[57:45] Holy
[57:46] Ghost
[57:48] amen look here at Second Corinthians 11
[57:51] look at how Paul took it this
[57:56] in 2 Corinthians
[57:58] 11 he says would to God verse one he
[58:02] says would to God that you would bear
[58:04] with me a little in my Folly and indeed
[58:06] if you just listen to me for a little
[58:08] while he says because I'm jealous over
[58:10] you with a Godly jealously for I have
[58:12] espoused you to one husband then I
[58:16] presentent you as a Chase virgin to
[58:20] Christ I brought you out of Egypt I put
[58:23] you in the promised land and you're now
[58:26] you know when you were baptized the the
[58:30] water was a sign it it didn't wash away
[58:34] sin but it was a sign of a clear
[58:36] conscience towards God that you were no
[58:38] longer going into Egypt something had
[58:40] attracted your attention and you were
[58:42] going after
[58:44] that
[58:46] amen I've espoused you to one husband
[58:49] that I may present you as a Chase virgin
[58:51] to Christ but I fear lest by any means
[58:55] as the serpent
[58:57] beguiled Eve through his subtility or
[59:01] his cunning
[59:05] craftiness so your minds should be
[59:09] corrupted from the
[59:11] Simplicity that is
[59:13] in the
[59:16] Republicans or the Democrats the
[59:19] libertarian
[59:21] party maybe the United States Communist
[59:24] Party
[59:27] they didn't get my
[59:29] attention God got my
[59:33] attention and I've been espouse to him
[59:35] as a Chase virgin and yeah I fail but
[59:38] I've also found a promise where he said
[59:41] yeah it'll be okay he says but as you
[59:43] grow he says you will push them out and
[59:47] you will possess the land because I have
[59:50] prophesied
[59:51] it
[59:53] amen amen
[59:57] so I want to look at one more scripture
[59:59] Exodus
[1:00:04] 21 Exodus
[1:00:10] 21 and verse one it says now these are
[1:00:13] the judgments which Thou shalt set
[1:00:15] before them if you buy a Hebrew
[1:00:17] servant six years shall he serve and in
[1:00:20] the seventh he shall go out free for
[1:00:22] nothing if he came in by himself he
[1:00:24] shall go out by himself if he were
[1:00:26] married then his wife shall walk with
[1:00:28] him and if his masterath given him a
[1:00:30] wife and she hath borne him Sons and
[1:00:32] Daughters the wife and her children
[1:00:34] shall be her Masters and he shall go out
[1:00:36] by himself but if the M if the servant
[1:00:39] shall plainly say I love my master my
[1:00:43] wife my children and I will not go out
[1:00:46] free then the master shall bring him to
[1:00:50] the
[1:00:51] judge and he shall also bring him to the
[1:00:55] door
[1:00:57] behold I stand at the door and
[1:00:59] knock If any man open the door I will
[1:01:03] come in and S with
[1:01:06] him unto the
[1:01:08] doorpost and his master shall bore his
[1:01:11] ear through with an A and he shall serve
[1:01:14] him
[1:01:16] forever in the Jubilee
[1:01:19] Year brother Brandon preached this
[1:01:21] message in
[1:01:24] 1954 on October October
[1:01:27] 3rd 70 years
[1:01:31] ago but here's the
[1:01:34] tragedy if that man did not desire to go
[1:01:37] back and he wanted to remain there then
[1:01:39] the master walked him up to him and said
[1:01:41] you desire to still be my slave yes then
[1:01:44] he took him down to the temple told it
[1:01:46] before the people became a public
[1:01:49] testimony put his ear up against the
[1:01:51] post put an all and marked him in the
[1:01:53] ear and then he could never be
[1:01:57] free he had to be a servant as long as
[1:02:00] he lived he must continue to serve the
[1:02:04] slave driver as long as he lived if he
[1:02:09] willfully
[1:02:10] rejected his calling and his
[1:02:14] opportunity to be
[1:02:19] free now settle yourselves just a
[1:02:22] moment for the past 40 years in the
[1:02:25] United States of America this is
[1:02:30] 1954 has constantly been the Roaring
[1:02:32] forth of the Holy Spirit working among
[1:02:34] men and individuals giving signs and
[1:02:36] wonders all kinds of Miracles people
[1:02:38] that's been brought up from prostitutes
[1:02:40] from illegitimate people and so forth
[1:02:42] and they've been become gentlemen and
[1:02:44] Christians and there has been those who
[1:02:46] have been blind received their sight
[1:02:47] deaf ears have been opened the great
[1:02:50] time of Jubilee for the sick and The
[1:02:51] Afflicted those who have been bound by
[1:02:53] the devil in every regards whether they
[1:02:55] were were sick whether they were blind
[1:02:57] whether they were crippled there has
[1:02:59] been thousands times thousands of
[1:03:01] Miracles working amongst the people and
[1:03:03] there's been a Revival constantly going
[1:03:06] in the church for the past 40 Years of
[1:03:08] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's
[1:03:10] come to a time as a nation and whole and
[1:03:15] as an individuals and as Church groups
[1:03:19] we have turned it down we've walked away
[1:03:24] and rejected it
[1:03:29] 70 years ago brother Brenham said this
[1:03:32] country's not coming back to
[1:03:37] God in the bum of Gil gillad in 1961 he
[1:03:41] said that's what's the matter today all
[1:03:44] the nation goes into sin whiskey joints
[1:03:47] people getting cold
[1:03:48] formal uncensored radio program
[1:03:51] uncensored television programs it's so
[1:03:53] fascinating
[1:03:55] sin is so beautiful till it attracts the
[1:03:58] attention of the people and now they got
[1:04:01] computers and they got their phones and
[1:04:03] they got everything and it'll attract
[1:04:06] their
[1:04:08] attention amen because it's fascinating
[1:04:11] it's
[1:04:12] beautiful and if they're not truly born
[1:04:15] again where their attraction is on
[1:04:18] Christ and single-minded then they'll go
[1:04:21] after that stuff and then they'll act
[1:04:23] like those people and the spirit that's
[1:04:26] on that will finally get on
[1:04:28] them in 1965 in this day the scriptures
[1:04:32] fulfilled brother Brenham said what a
[1:04:34] perfect example it is of the Gospel of
[1:04:36] Jesus Christ when it's preached it's the
[1:04:39] acceptable time the time of the Jubilee
[1:04:41] anybody no matter who you are what color
[1:04:44] you are what denomination you belong to
[1:04:46] how far you've stooped and sin or what's
[1:04:48] wrong with you you can go free when you
[1:04:50] hear the gospel trumpet sound you are
[1:04:52] free but if you turn your back on the
[1:04:54] message and refuse to hear it notice
[1:04:58] you're bored in the ear with a awe that
[1:05:00] means to say that you have crossed the
[1:05:02] line between grace and judgment and you
[1:05:05] will never hear the gospel again you'll
[1:05:08] never get any further you must be a
[1:05:10] slave to the system that you're in the
[1:05:12] rest of your days if you refuse to hear
[1:05:15] the acceptable
[1:05:17] year and know it it not brother B said
[1:05:20] what is it it's through
[1:05:23] science you better memorize
[1:05:26] quote it's through science the food the
[1:05:29] hybrids it's perverted the whole human
[1:05:31] body till we become a bunch of mass of
[1:05:34] corruption and if the physical being is
[1:05:37] corrupted isn't your brain cell in your
[1:05:39] physical
[1:05:41] being watch the spirit following it
[1:05:45] there'll come a time in the name of the
[1:05:46] Lord that people will go completely
