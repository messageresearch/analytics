TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe God bless you [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen it's all he ask us to do amen if you'll turn with me uh this evening to Luke chapter 21 it says I'm M you okay how about if I just yell test how we doing now hello oh ah oh for the days and we were just get in a boat and go out a little ways from the seashore and then just preach to everybody right that's what the scripture says praise the Lord amen amen Luke 21 let's start with verse 29 and he spake to them a parable behold the Fig Tree and all the trees and when they now shoot forth you see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand so likewise ye when you see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand and verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfing and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that day come upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man let's bow our heads for a word of prayer dear Lord Jesus Heavenly Father we are grateful for your love and your mercy we're grateful Lord that you've sent a prophet Lord to open our eyes and you've been merciful to us and I pray father tonight that you be merciful to us again and Lord that you'll speak to every heart that's here Lord that you open our eyes and our understanding and I pray father that you'll be this the Unseen guest the Supreme King the Lord of lords speak through US Lord we love you and we thank you Father for all these things in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen you may be seated praise the Lord so I'd like to speak to you for a little while on job's question amen so we all see and and another another thing I want to tell you is that this is this message I I want to get right in your face maybe not like that but I this message is for each one of you individually now you can can say no no no no but don't don't say no no no no no because there's no trick questions I always laugh when I go out some places and I'll I'll come up with some statement and then everybody will look at me and because there's no trick question this message is for you individually so I want you to listen carefully I do I want you to listen carefully so Jesus speaking to the disciples he says be told the Fig Tree and all the trees and when they now shoot forth you he didn't say I'm going to tell you but you yourself see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand you don't have to have somebody explain it to you you you already know in your own self that God is doing something and he makes this statement he says so this generation shall not pass away shall all be fulfilled and when Don and I were sitting on the front porch we were talking about that I said do you know all the people that we know that have passed on and have died and and we're still believing this scripture but Jesus Al also told all of us all of us together Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away so take heed to yourselves so what that means he says so pay attention be cautious give attendance to yourself lest at any times your heart be overcharged and that means burdened with surfeiting and surfeiting is a headache or a seizure of pain from drunkenness commonly known as a hangover so the way things the tree and everything's come into bud and everything else and he says so when you see all these things you know yourself that the coming of the Lord is at is at hand so he says you need to pay attention you need to be cautious lest at any time you be burdened with a headache because of the things that are coming on the face of the Earth and if you've ever had a hangover which I don't know if you have or not but you're very useless everything in the room is spinning the loud noises really upset you and everything else and and that that is how people they've he says don't be like that don't let your heart hearts become burdened with a headache or a seizure of pain and and overtaken with drunkenness and of course drunkenness is is the right thing which is you know drinking wine Jesus drank wine they said here comes a wine bibber but he said be not drunk with wine in excess but he says don't be you know when people do that when they when they go on a binge drinking they lose control of their self-control and one of the steps on the statute of a perfect man is temperance which is self-control this is not an hour for you to lose your control right amen and be caught up with the cares of this life so that that day the problem is is that the pressures and everything because look at what he says here in in verse 35 he says for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth so it's it's coming there's nothing you can do about it and but make sure that you are keeping your focus where it needs to be amen he says watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass you're not going to stop it it's coming amen it's common brother brandom in Hebrews he said he said brother and I'm going to say sister a long time ago before the world was ever had a foundation to it God through his eternal Grace he looked down and by for knowledge he seen you and I individually I don't want you to think of somebody else he saw you and I amen and he knew what age we would live in by his for knowledge he knew what hour to place you he placed you in this age he didn't place you in the age where they're going to burn you at the stake and that's to be the end of it he didn't put you in the age when when uh the black plague was going on and and other things were going on but he put you in this age by his foreign knowledge he saw you he knows you he knows you as an individual and he knew what age we would live in and he knew what we would be like he knew what brother Marty's going to be like he knew what I'm going to be like he even knows all my faults he knows brother beckman's faults he knows them brother Keith no sense hiding them he knows you and he placed you in this age with these pressures with these things he placed you here therefore by election he chose us before the foundation of the world to be with him without spy now his word says Heaven and Earth is going to pass away but he said my word will not pass away so individually he has already seen you perfected without spot don't put it on somebody else say oh no I don't want to I Brother Bruce I don't want to take I I'm just want to sit and listen no I want you to hear me hey he already seen you without spot and he placed you in this age in this hour at this time in the Rapture message brother Brom said so God leted his word out to each age in each one of those ages has to manifest that so the word that God has reserved for this this hour has to come to fruit they ate the fruit that that God was looking for the Peaceable fruit that he was looking for in Noah's age has already been harvested the fruit that God was looking for in Moses's age has already been harvested and now in this age God knows you and he's placed you here and he has word that that he's foreordained for you to fulfill nobody else can fulfill it nobody else can walk in your shoes nobody can walk in my shoes so brother brandham said he foreordained men for that age to fulfill that word every time he lied his word he lied a man for it and when he lied Moses's time he led Moses to it when he lotted the time for the Son of God to be born he led him to it every age he's sladed his man foreordained as the Bible has said so in the identified Masterpiece brother bandam says so it's all lotted out here in the Bible it's right all laid out and Jesus said that thing that Bible that word will not fall to the ground that word cannot be broken whatever I send it for it shall accomplish whatever I sent it for amen so he says so it's all LED out here in the Bible and we have got to know the age and the hour and what it is for us individually and there is where we're failing today we're reading everything else but the Bible oh wait a minute did you see that on Instagram brother ran did you see that just now oh man I had to get over to Twitter and see what's going yeah oh it must be real because it's on my phone and it's got 27,000 likes and and 25 of those thousand are believers that I have personally met a prophet that God had sent to us said we are reading everything else but the Bible and this is the day that we should be living this is the day that God has placed us here so let's look in the word amen and then remember always remember this if you ever were in God's thinking you will always be there if he called you if you heard his voice one time you're far better than a lot of people amen you will always be there if you've got eternal life you are the expression or the attribute of his thought for this age because Wesley already played his part Luther already played his part brother brandom already played his part all the people that were in the healing campaigns they played their part all the ones that followed brother brandham and used to have the real real tapes and then they had the cassettes and then they had this and then they had that you know Billy Paul's passed on everyone has done their part but God has foreordained a word for each one of you individually to fulfill in this age and by his infinite wisdom and his wisdom is better than his ways are past finding out by his infinite wisdom by his infinite knowledge by his infinite intelligence he has chosen you above your brethren and placed you in this age in this hour praise the Lord got a nail that one down friends job we're talking about job right let's go back here to Job chapter 1 amen so I want you to think about that when we we'll will'll when we get into some of this and job 1:1 it says there was a man in the land of O whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and ued Evil now I want to break that down for you he was upright which means he was complete or morally usually morally Pious he was specifically gentle he was coupled together which he had his act together he was perfect he was plain he was undefiled and he was upright that is you that is you right now in this age that's what you are a perfect and upright man somebody who feared God and that means somebody who's morally reverent morally reverences God how many want to raise their hand and say no I don't believe this message I don't want to take I'm not job I'm not there I'm you well you're making the Bible a liar then you reverence God I don't have to ask you I know you reverence God you have trouble seeing yourself perfect but you're perfect you're not perfect in your own eyes you're perfect in his eyes you've been washed by the blood of the Lamb what did you think that was it made you perfect made you clean and asew he says one that feared God and ASU evil and ASU means to turn off literally or figuratively decline depart from turn away from which one of you today is running towards sin so you is Che evil you're just like job you're perfect in God's sight you're upright don't you strive to be upright if I mean I can't believe people would come to church and not strive to be upright when God saved me my whole life turned upside down everything became new I now long longer did the things I used to do I now do different things and I don't work towards being evil I decline that when I get the chance I turn it down am I get rid of it I don't have it around amen amen now I want you to notice because everybody pretty much knows the story of job if you go down to verse 8 God the Bible says and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth God and asth Evil it's exactly the same thing that was written in verse one but in verse one the author was writing it we don't know who the author was but in verse 8 it was God testifying how great a servant job was Amen brother brandom says in the atonement he says so now when job the oldest book in the Bible that's written perhaps before Genesis was even written and it was included in the Bible you know Moses wrote The Genesis job in his book he rested solemnly upon the promise God had made him do you believe acts 238 am right if I repent and I'm baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and how many believe that they truly been born again and if you believe you've truly been born again then you're no longer a creature of this world you're a creature of God you are now a Son of God born In His Image praise the Lord amen amen and brother brandom says he says job only had one you know he only had one part of the word revealed to him so I want you to look at verse five so it says and it was so now remember this perfect man this man that is chewed evil and he loved God God and and he he he did all the right things and brother sister I know that's your heart I don't even have to wonder you know any I know that's your heart but you've got to believe it with all of your heart and it was so when the days of this feasting were gone about and this is talking about his children that job sent and Sanctified them and he rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all job Sanctified his children by an offering they didn't do anything they weren't it was Job saying this sacrifice is what gives me favor with God and even though my children are not doing the right things I'm sanctifying them by offering the same thing for them he did that he said because it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts and thus did job continually job did that without any evidence from God that it worked because God brother brandom said if the church could ever get to the place to where it could solemnly rest upon God's Eternal Word to be the truth job had just a little bit of word to fulfill and that little bit of word was if I make this sacrifice Jehovah God will sanctify and forgive me of my sins and because my children they could have possibly done this I am going to do it and brother Brenham said you see the church if it could ever get to that place that they could solemnly rest upon the Eternal Word to be the truth what a difference there would be what a correcting there would be what a cutting away there would be what a joy there would be what a power there would be when men and women would take God at face value and what he said is the truth you wondering why you're discouraged and why you're down because you don't believe God and His word you need to take him at his word but I don't see any evidence of still take him at his word he cannot lie amen no matter what the circumstances look like that has nothing to do with it God said so and that should settle it and job when he was in the most trying time of all of his experiences when he had been found in the presence of God a just man in the presence of God job was justified in God's presence every one of you has been Justified amen even God said he was perfect wow there was none like him in the earth and Satan was given the privilege to tempt him amen the devil was given the privilege to tempt him and he said to God I'll make him curse you to his face and he almost took job's life and he would have done it but God draw a boundy line and said you can do nothing you can do anything you want to him but you can't take his life I I I remember this so clear in my mind I was I was at work I had all this pressure all these things going on things and things were really it was bad and I was under a lot of stress and everything else and all of a sudden in my the owner of the company called me on the phone and he says Bruce come up here to my office and I knew I was in trouble I said yes Vince I'll I'll and I hung up my phone and clear his day that scripture came to me pilate looked at Jesus and said do you know I have power over you and Jesus said you have no power over me except my Father in heaven give it to you and that scripture just came I mean it just blared me in my face and I just sat back and said what I never thought about that I didn't know he can't touch he can't touch me he can't even fire me he can't kick me out because I know God placed me here and when God's done with me he will take me away and give me something else to do amen that's the God I serve that's the god you serve you have to believe that that has to become part of your life not just oh I'm coming to church I'm singing the songs I'm doing this I'm no brother it has to become part of your life Amen brother Brenham said he said in my redeemer liveth he says did you ever stop to think this morning as far as returning that is it had become visible and he's talking about the second coming of Christ he is already here with us now so I want you to look look at the chair next to you do you realize that angels are here right now in another dimension he said he's here with us now and he now today just imagine that his presence is here today the Lord Jesus is in another world or another dimension right here today in the form of his Spirit his spirit is blending in with our spirit and that's what makes us righteous because we can't be righteous we can't I SAR like a sailor I lost a promotion because I swore too [Laughter] much guy said I was going to make you assistant manager he says but there's something wrong with you Bruce you swear too much and when I started coming to the Lord and I heard a man preach and he said and if you want to change in your life he says you just come up here and pray he says we'll pray for you and I said oh you don't have to ask me twice I run up Donna was with me yeah I mean think she probably thought I was nuts I had never been I mean I was raised Presbyterian you don't do alter calls in the pray we don't do any of this stuff I came up front I didn't even know how to hold my hands I didn't even know how to pray I know the Lord's Prayer and I knew the Apostles Creed and and that's it and I got up front and this guy he prayed prayed over all of us and I said okay whatever help and I went home halfway through work the next day I wasn't even saved wasn't baptized wasn't n made no confession of Faith nothing else nothing nothing nothing swearing was gone God that is not just for me it's for for all of you amen this and his presence is here right now it's just in another dimension the Lord Jesus is in another dimension right here today in the form of his spirit and his spirit is blending in with our spirit and our eyes can't see him because well we're physical unless there would be something happening to us that we could see a vision but he is here just as visible he's just as real as he was on the day he spoke to Mary at the grave or when he met kopus on his road to EMAs his presence is here he's here he's sitting next to you he's walking with you sister Lyn everywhere I go he's by my side you know job that just think about that you think you think well here's job job's down here on Earth and then somewhere up in heaven the sons of God presented themselves before the Lord and Satan came along the way but it was just it was just as far away as job could have sucked his hand out and touched God because he's that close to us that's his promise and that conversation between job and Satan was right one arms one arms length away and God's looking at him said no no this guy he fears me he's Reverend now the thing is you have to step into that you can't just come and and listen and hope that it'll happen you've got to step into the word of God you've got to say you know what I have enough evidence I have enough things happen in my life that I am sure that God God has elected me I am sure that God knew me before the foundation of the world I am sure that he saved me I am sure amen amen amen but job had this question because all of us all of us everyone that's sitting here today we have an an kny problem that we can't get an answer to everybody us every one of us we got a question that we can't get an answer to I remember I I remember after we we had we our third child was a baby boy my wife miscarried at seven and a half months and that was our third miscarriage we're not even talking about the other ones but that one was that one and we had gone to at church service we're in this meeting and and the preaching it really it really got to me and I went up and I cried at the altar I probably cried at the altar for a half hour I wanted God talk to me what why why is all this you're killing my wife you're breaking her heart and and I and as a theologians have said the silent God sat with his arms crossed so we have to find ourselves in the scriptures and I didn't know these scriptures existed till I heard a brother preaching just a little while ago and I went I didn't know that was in there but let's go to job 23 we're going to look at the whole chapter so job everything was you know he knew he he feared God he he did the offering he did it in faith he did it in trust there God didn't come back and you know he just he was a successful businessman and he had a family and he had all these thing and all of a sudden everything turned upside down and everything went against him and then his friends came and he's got some great friends his friends showed up and they said you know if you'd have fasted more this would have never happened if You' have prayed more this would have never happened if you'd have done this if you'd have given more in ad missions and oh if you hadn't skipped paying your ties that time oh God would oh you know you're a secret sinner now think about Job who God had already testified as a upright man who feared God ASU evil and he's just an arm length away from his servant he's just an arm length away and now he's covered with boils and his wife's turned against him and he's out on the ash Heap and he's wandering but the one thing he's holding on to is the word of God the promise of God he's holding on to the promise of God but I want you to see how he answers this he says job answered and said even today my complaint is bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning he was his complaint complaint means his contemplations his babblings his prayers my prayer is bitter he says and the stroke is heavier than my groaning the boils of around me and the trials of this problem that I can't get an answer because I I'm seeking you Lord but it's heavier than my groaning oh that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat have you ever been like that you say oh Lord you've got to move on this situation you got to help me where is he how can I get to his feet seat how can I find him brother renam said he said and be certain of God he said those circumstances will seem to F fall from right to left but that faith never moves because you are certain that he is God and if he is God he will keep his promise he can't make a promise and break it if he's God he's got to keep his promise oh how I love that oh wait a minute I got another my Twitter feed just went off oh you see when the church quits reading their Twitter feed and starts reading the Bible and believing in the Bible amen but sometimes brother Bram said he said but sometimes God lets Affliction hit his people to test them for their faith test them for their faith now the devil will tell you it's because you do a secret sinner you did something wrong you didn't stand up you you know you're not perfect in all your ways but you're perfect in all your ways in God's sight Amen brother Brenham said he said so sometimes God lets afflictions HIIT his people to test them for their faith he was testing a saint not rebuking a sinner I like that he was testing him and God does that to test Jesus said the scripture says that every son that cometh to God must be tried and tested and child trained and then they're proven to be the right children of God are you the right children of God then why are you listening to a foster father the devil was my foster father he wasn't my real father why am I listening to him job said oh if I could if I could just pray through if I could find him that I might come even to a seat I would I would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments I would tell him all the reasons why God you shouldn't do this to me don't do this to my family don't do this to my children don't don't I would know the words which he would answer me and then I would understand what he would say unto me I would know why I'm going through this trial I wouldn't know why that's all I want is I want to know why I just want to know why brother Mary will he plead against me with his great power will he slap me around because he's God and I'm just dust no but he will put strength in me amen look at no look at job he had an absolute amen do you have an absolute this morning do you have one amen do you believe it have you found an absolute a tie poost that no matter what happens I'm staying right here with it he had an absolute everything that went wrong for that man and he was a just man and now we be D person to say that he wasn't just because God said he was and there was no one on earth like job he was perfect in the sight of God and he knew it because he had the ultimate he had an absolute you think he had an ultimate he had an absolute One Promise that's all he had and you have all the promises we sing that song all the promises in the book or mine every chapter every verse every line oh my Twitter feed went off again you know what they just said on Instagram brother Mary amen because he had an ultimate he had an absolute and when everything seemed to be contrary when sickness broke out his friends had all said there you are job proves you're a sinner proves you're wrong cuz if you were living right if you were the elect if you were the bride these evil things wouldn't be happening to you do you have an absolute verse seven he says there the righteous might dispute with him at God's Throne if we could just get to God if I just I just I remember the night I prayed and prayed and cried and cried and cried and cried and afterwards and brother Johnson come and said Brother Bruce he says did you get what you were asking for and I said no he said broke like that I said he never came he never told he never answered the question he never answered the question I asked the righteous will dispute with him so should I be delivered forever from my judge and who's my judge God right behold I go forward but I can't find him I look behind me and I can't even see him cuz he's that far away and on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him I can't see what he's doing I can't see what the purpose is why would you drag me through this why would you turn everything upside down why why Lord please answer my question I can't find him he hideth himself on the right hand I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take praise the Lord praise the Lord I wonder if you were asleep back there sister an amen he knoweth the way I take and when he has tried me I shall come forth as gold praise God my foot ha held his steps his way have I kept and I have not declined I haven't deliberately broken any of the word of God I haven't I haven't cursed him to his face I you know I i' I've had things problems pressures everything else but yet The Anchor Holds within the veil amen I have an absolute do you amen job had an absolute it was just one scripture and yet he had the same questions that you have he just wanted an answer yet God didn't tell him my foot have held his steps his way have I kept and not declined and neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips see job knew his own heart he says I haven't I'm doing what he told me to do I have esteemed the words or the promise of his mouth more than my necessary food because he kept that word if I burn if I offer a burnt sacrifice I am justified and I will not turn from that that no matter what the devil does for me that's what job said amen but he is in he is in one mind and who can turn him yeah brother Bernie I mean really come on you're a Believer how often did you cry for sister Kathleen raise her up raise her up Lord don't take her away from me people don't want to hear that they don't want to hear preaching that really gets right down where you're living but you know that's that's the truth of it and when I looked for him I couldn't find him when I looked behind I couldn't see him I didn't know what he was working I didn't know what he wanted from me but I will not turn from his word I will not leave his side I will not leave this message I will not leave the word of God Amen you see it's right there he is of one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth for he performed a thing that he appointed for me and many such things are with him many many trials many tests many things that he's done things that we can't never explain and we pray and we ask God God why are you doing this why why is it got to be like this why did you take this away from me why did you do that why did you and he's of one mind because he's got some word that he's about to fulfill and you are the only vessel that can fulfill that word I can't do it for you amen Amen brother brandom says this I I read this uh testimony many many years ago and it always stuck with me I want you to listen this is a prophet I don't know what caused me to do it but I said Lord God you owe me an understanding after me going out there and telling that husband and him coming to the Lord after you done all these things for him and all like that and then you took that that girl's life like that I said you owe me an understanding how many of us are praying like that Lord Jesus in the garden he was trying to get out from underneath the burden of that word pressing on him and he was the only one that was a lotted for that word brother brandom said there was word lotted for that age and Jesus Christ was the only one that could could feel that word and he said Lord take it away from me until he came into the place not my will but let your word have its perfect place in my heart let me be that light let me be that Shining Light what about you amen and when you tell God something like that he'll leave you sitting there alone I don't you know he doesn't owe you a thing I'm in debt to him well he just let me PW it out for a few days you know and after about 3 to four months one day I was out on the creek bank and the Lord spoke to me in a vision so it wasn't brother brandom seeking the Lord the Lord came to him and spoke to him you know God will give you he you know he said he'll wipe away every tear he's going to wipe them away not because you want them wiped away when the time comes he'll come and wipe them away he'll turn your your weeping into joy in the morning he will do that you can't do that you can't even you can't even by taking thought you if you've got a toothache you can't even heal a toothache it's the truth amen the Lord spoke to me in a vision he said and he said to me he says now go to her mother and say this to her mother did not her time come the year before that when she was drowning in a creek on a picnic she should have went at that time but I had to take her when she was ready to go and that's why all this happened and why you went out there and then I got down and I cried and I said Lord Jesus forgive me your poor stupid servant I should have never said that Lord and I went back down to this lady and she lived over here on Market Street and I went over to her and I said I want to ask you a question she said sure brother Bill and I said Is it true that that girl almost drowned and she said you know what that's right brother brandom her husband they they had got her out to the creek they had to use artificial respiration and put on pressure they had to get a machine and pump the water out of her she had her skirt on and they was having a picnic and she was out there she stepped on some sand slipped over her head strangled in the water and they didn't notice her and directly they seen her coming up and going down and they run in they got her they brought her out she almost died and brother Ram said that was her time to go see God knows what he is doing in every situation in every trial in every prayer in everything God knows what he's doing if the church would just take him at his word and believe his word oh Instagram this time wow I can't show that one you with you God knows what he's doing the Lord probably would have told me that if I hadn't taken the attitude that I took you see Lord you owe me to tell me about that he doesn't owe you anything I stood in a meeting one night I heard an evangelist praying for the sick and he said God I command you to heal this person you command God do you ever think about that I think about that all the time I pray I get up in the morning I pray I pray I try I try to do my best brother John says you should have a conversation don't be an Aaron boy but if you analyze your prayer it's everything bless this brother bless that one heal this one do this do that do this do this and and I just want to stop and hear him talk to me but you know what it's just like job he's quiet he won't tell me I look for him on the left hand I look for him on the right I look behind me I said Lord why why is all this like this why is it like this and right there the scripture job went through the exact same thing job had the exact same question he says who commands God it isn't even intelligent because God he does what he wants to verse 14 says for he performthe the footsteps of the Lord are ordered of God well yeah sometimes Brother Bruce oh really are we sons of God or not well you know sometimes are we sons of God or not amen do we believe him or not and he performed a thing which is appointed for me and many such things are with him therefore am I troubled at his presence and when I consider I am afraid of him because he holds my life in his hand my very breath is in his hands I didn't know I had a bad heart a really bad heart he never told me and then when everything started happen happen and he never told me what to do and I told Donna she says what are you going to do I says uh well we're just we're just going to keep there's okay we're going to walk here okay then we're going we're going to walk here and I'm going to look to the left God are you here what do you want me to do are you here okay well I'm just going to keep walking because that's the way he works job said so I just read it to you and I'm afraid of him for God Will Make My Heart soft that's the problem most of us we had way too much pride way too much pride and the almighty troubleth me because I was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he covered the darkness from my faith he didn't take me he didn't bring me in this I I really wish that he'd do something different than the trial that he's taken me through right now but that isn't his way that isn't how he works and job 23 now tells me things that I didn't know about I had somebody call me a year or so back they called me up they said Brother Bruce can I I want to ask you a question and I said yeah okay and they started telling me this really bad thing that happened to them and and they they said why why would God do that and is it wrong for me to pray that God will be avenge me of this person and and all this other I said you know I said I'm just going to tell you right now I said you may never ever get an answer to what happened you may never get an answer you may never you you may vengeance is of God so don't try to don't try to don't don't don't try because we're Children of the king you it's not up to us to be judge it's not up to us to I'm gonna make this person I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna make it so they got to gravel at my feet in fact I'm going to give them so many glasses of water because you said when you give a your enemy a glass of water pours coal on his head and and and and really that's the way we act it's true I am glad that God doesn't hold us accountable I was I was thinking the other day I was thinking I thought I said I be glad you know I'm glad that when I die and I go to the Pearly Gates if there's Pearly Gates whatever they are but when I get there that he isn't going to come down to the gate and say Oh Brother Bruce yeah I remember you you remember that time do you remember that time and do you remember that do you I do I remember it did you make it right did you hm well you're not coming in I'm glad that his blood his promise is bigger than that when we get there he'll and he'll he'll greet us with open arms why because we've accepted his propitiation we've accepted his sacrifice my sacrifice was never good enough but but his sacrifice is amen praise the Lord let's go over here and look at Hebrews 12 I want to share just a couple more things but I really want you to spend some time looking at Job 23 really look at it that's what we can see that in the book of that's why we started in Luke we can see the hour we're living in but Jesus said he said you know what's going to happen to you guys you're going to get all all burden and you're going to have a headache and you're not going to be able to walk right and you're not going to be able to do all these things and all of a sudden the snare you're going to get caught in a snare and that day will catch you unaware when you should have known better amen in Hebrews 12:3 it says for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself so here's Jesus he's in the he's in the Judgment Hall and they bring him in the Judgment Hall the high priest is there all the other judges are there he knows he's right he knows they're wrong and they say well we're going to call up brother so and so and he comes up says well I heard I heard that he said that if you destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it back up did you say that and he never said nothing then they brought another guy in and he said can you collaborate because the we are the Pharisees and we know that Moses told us out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses let all things be established well he didn't really say it like that contradiction of Sinners said consider Jesus Christ who endured lies well you know he went and come down he he he did this he broke up this he did that he did all these other things and he said consider him consider him in the Judgment Hall consider the lies that were told about him consider all those things unless you become wearied and faint in your mind you think you got it bad because the first chance you get you'll blow your to I've done that a few times back me into a corner and after a while I can't and then I feel bad right because that's not a son of God it's not a son of God he says consider him consider Jesus Christ that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your minds you have not yet resisted under blood you no uh-uh you haven't resisted under blood yet striving against sin he who knew no sin had to die even though he was completely Guiltless and that's not you because you are guilty I'm guilty and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto us as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him God was just an arms length away from job and job wanted to talk to him job wanted to know why job wanted an answer to his prayers job couldn't see the purpose job but job would not walk over that word he had an absolute he said I'm sticking with this I I can't see what he's doing but I know that when it's over with I'll be like gold I know it's going to work for my good I know it it don't look like it right now but I know he's bringing me into His Image amen amen and chess izing here is used in verse 5 6 and 7even but I want you to I chastening every time I every time as long as I've served God which has since 1976 or so he says my son despise thou not the chastening of the Lord I always think of a beaten with a belt I always think of somebody just you know chastising me for for but the in the Greek it means tutorage that means education or training by Implement by implication disciplinary correction so God's correction seems heavy at times but he's trying to teach you something the trials that are coming your way he's trying to teach you something despise not thou the chastening or the teach teaching of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for when the for whom the Lord loveth he teaches and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth for if you endure these things chastening the schooling you know that's why that's why the church is still here because we have trouble taking chastisement we we do and as long as we don't take chastisement it doesn't bear Peaceable fruit that's what the Bible says the Bible says that we are the branches and he says a branch that's bringing forth just a little bit of fruit he comes by with a hatchet and cuts off he prunes it and prunes it back so it'll bear more fruit amen praise God Amen and if you endure chastening God deals with you as with a son not a sinner he's not doing this to you to destroy you I love that brother from Africa he he brought up a very excellent point the man that built this Pulpit has no interest in destroying it it's his Masterpiece and you are God's masterpiece he he brought us all this way not to destroy us but to display us amen amen praise God God deal dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not brother brandham said in the evening messenger he says now remember job remember all this Tri that wasn't God chastening job that was God approving his servant approving his servant so it all worked out for good you see and then the book The Book of Job was written for all generations for a testimony and God's working it for our good amen amen I think that's a very fine example for us parents today let's set an example before our children you live your best and your worst at home yep and I think that our lives though the children may not exactly act like they're watching you but they're watching you don't you never think that they're not because they are and here's the kicker not are the CH not only are the children watching you but your neighbors are watching you and not only the neighbors but the people you associate with yeah they watch you the people at the church they watch you the people that you do business with in the market they're watching you they're watching your confession even when you didn't confess they can see they can see we should always try to reflect Christ in everything that we do job had a question happens to be the same question I got but I'm glad I found in the scriptures an answer amen let's Stand Together amen let's bow our heads amen dear Lord Jesus Heavenly Father forgive us of our sins our carnality our iniquities our slothful ways Lord we just want to please you when we get up in the morning we want our ways to please you throughout the day we want to please you so many times we're looking for you we we can't see you but you're just an arms length away just in another dimension your angels are around about us and we know that because Satan even told Jesus himself he said oh just throw yourself down his angels will pick up your feet unless they Dash your foot against the stone oh yeah the devil can quote the scriptures Lord help us to be a reflection of you you have chosen us youve foreordained us you've elected us for this very hour oh we'd have loved to come up in a different age we would have loved to been somewhere else but this is the age and the hour this is the place that you placed us and not only did you place us you gave us the tools that we could be Overcomers you gave us the power to stand against the Ws of the devil you have done all things for us let us just do a little bit for you may we commit Our Lives to you may we give our hearts to you may we give this message to you Lord I pray that you'll let us go but don't let us depart from your word Lord let this word go home with us may it trouble us at night May it trouble us tomorrow may you trouble us Lord don't let us just go on our own blind ways trouble us Lord speak to us we just want to know how we can please you we commit everything in your hands for your honor and your glory in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen praise the Lord
