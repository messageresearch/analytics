[35:10] as I believe there is for each and every
[35:12] one of us just Quicken it to us in our
[35:15] personal relationship with you father
[35:16] that your kingdom may be further that
[35:18] our relationship with you may be closer
[35:20] and that we'll walk out of this place
[35:23] Lord just better children of God
[35:27] children that you're more pleased with
[35:28] children that you're more happier with
[35:31] God we committed all to UNS for
[35:34] Revelation uh this morning now in Jesus
[35:36] Christ's name we pray amen amen in
[35:41] Romans chapter
[35:43] uh one here verse starting with verse
[35:45] 16. this is basically the the
[35:48] foundational message to Restoration that
[35:51] God gave
[35:53] um Martin Luther for I am not ashamed of
[35:56] the gospel of Christ for it as the power
[35:57] of God unto salvation
[36:01] it's to everyone that believeth to the
[36:03] Jew first and also to the Greek for
[36:06] therein is the righteousness of God
[36:08] revealed from Faith to Faith as it is
[36:10] written
[36:12] the just people the people of God the
[36:15] just those that God has Justified shall
[36:19] live by faith so they continue their
[36:22] journey by faith it isn't just at the
[36:25] beginning it's a walk amen
[36:28] and then let's go to Galatians chapter
[36:30] 2.
[36:31] here Paul goes on to
[36:34] testify of his personal walk with Christ
[36:37] he says I am crucified with Christ
[36:39] nevertheless I live yet not I
[36:43] saw Christ that lives in me
[36:46] and everything that I'm doing in my life
[36:51] I
[36:52] live
[36:55] by the faith of the Son of God Amen the
[36:59] life which I now live in the flesh I
[37:01] live by the faith of the Son of God who
[37:04] loved me and gave himself for me at one
[37:08] time Paul walked by his own
[37:10] understanding his own intellect his own
[37:12] thoughts this is what I'm going to do
[37:15] this is the I got this figured out this
[37:17] is the right thing to do and he had to
[37:20] give all that way through all that away
[37:22] that he might gain Christ
[37:25] but it wasn't just a stamp oh I got
[37:27] Christ I've got salvation and now
[37:30] everything's okay his whole life began
[37:34] to be governed by the things that God
[37:37] spoke to his heart
[37:41] so it was in every day of fear where it
[37:43] was hearing the voice of God
[37:45] and he says the life that I now live I
[37:47] live by God's speaking to me and I know
[37:52] it's Faith because we know that's what
[37:53] faith is amen second Corinthians chapter
[37:55] five
[37:58] starting with verse number six
[38:01] therefore we are always confident
[38:04] knowing that whiles we are at home in
[38:07] our body
[38:09] we are absent from the Lord
[38:12] for we walk by
[38:15] faith
[38:17] not by sight
[38:19] now this being the case
[38:22] we are confident I say and willing
[38:24] rather to be absent from the body and to
[38:26] be present
[38:27] with the Lord wherefore we labor
[38:31] that we pray that whether we're present
[38:34] or absent we may be accepted of him so
[38:37] obviously God puts things on our heart
[38:39] amen amen
[38:40] and and we do those things and and it's
[38:43] the labor of the Lord and uh if we don't
[38:47] do it we can't be accepted of him so
[38:49] that's part of really walking by faith
[38:52] and not sight God bless you may be
[38:53] seated today
[38:55] brother Brandon said in the message of
[38:57] the trial he says don't look at me now
[38:58] you you can look at me
[39:01] but let your faith look beyond that
[39:04] you can look to me with physical eyes
[39:07] but look at him with your eyes of faith
[39:12] that he is the word
[39:14] and he has just changed his mess he from
[39:17] what could not be seen to what is
[39:19] absolutely declared the word made flesh
[39:23] and he said have faith
[39:25] have faith I want this message to
[39:27] stimulate our faith because without
[39:30] faith we're not going to go anywhere
[39:31] with God Amen right no matter if we're
[39:34] going to church in the will of God if I
[39:37] could say it like that if we don't have
[39:38] faith in what we're doing we're not
[39:39] going to get anywhere
[39:42] now
[39:43] when we have no physical sight at all
[39:47] we're considered blind
[39:50] we walk in darkness everything is black
[39:53] no matter if the lot if the room is full
[39:56] of lights and praise God we almost got
[39:58] all the lights and I got a couple more
[39:59] lights done it's getting brighter up
[40:00] here
[40:02] even if the room is full of light if
[40:05] you're blind it's it doesn't seem light
[40:08] to you because you can't see beyond that
[40:11] Veil
[40:12] so no matter if a blind man is staring
[40:15] at the sun it's still black to him right
[40:19] right everything is black to us because
[40:21] our eyes are not capable of seeing the
[40:24] things that they really are it's almost
[40:25] like when
[40:27] um uh people say I wish that I wish the
[40:30] sun would come out I wish the sun would
[40:31] come out the sun is always out it's just
[40:34] clouds are in the way from keeping us
[40:36] from seeing the Sun
[40:39] it can be described to us somebody can
[40:42] describe to us things but we can't fully
[40:45] comprehend it until we experience it
[40:48] ourselves
[40:50] okay
[40:51] now when we have sight we're able to
[40:53] walk in the light of our surroundings
[40:54] we're not going to step over the chairs
[40:57] or stumble out or hit one another as
[40:59] we're walking out of the church and this
[41:01] is because our eyes are open to the
[41:03] natural world that's around us
[41:05] and we're able to comprehend things so
[41:07] much greater than somebody just trying
[41:10] to describe something to us
[41:15] we're limited when somebody tries to
[41:17] describe something to us try to describe
[41:21] a changing sunset
[41:24] I mean you you sat there and you watched
[41:26] the sunset over the ocean and you watch
[41:28] that sun go down so fast you just you
[41:31] just can't believe it it happened so
[41:32] fast or the moon if you stayed up long
[41:34] enough to see that it just it goes fast
[41:37] but wonder when a sunset is transpiring
[41:40] the the colors in the sky
[41:44] are rapidly changing
[41:47] it's like a living picture
[41:50] and how do you describe that to somebody
[41:52] to where they really catch and
[41:54] comprehend exactly what you're seeing it
[41:58] just can't be done it just can't be done
[42:00] no matter how good you are at describing
[42:03] uh communicating you cannot bring the
[42:07] full detail because your eyes
[42:10] can't see it
[42:13] so we got some pictures we want to show
[42:15] you I want you to think about trying to
[42:17] describe some of these pictures to
[42:20] somebody try to describe that to
[42:22] somebody who's never seen it before
[42:27] I mean your eyes make it real clear
[42:31] all right let's let's keep going we got
[42:32] a number of these now try to describe
[42:34] that to somebody
[42:36] you know they're not going to get it no
[42:38] no matter how good you are at your
[42:39] communication
[42:40] okay
[42:41] it takes eyes to see it
[42:45] a butterfly that you can see through
[42:48] I mean how are you going to see that or
[42:50] describe that without seeing it you got
[42:53] to see it
[42:55] look at that try to describe that to
[42:57] somebody
[43:01] you're going to come short
[43:03] look at the different colors
[43:07] God is amazing isn't he
[43:11] look at this this is like this this
[43:13] peacock or not a peacock but this is a
[43:16] what is this again
[43:22] peasant yes this fashion I mean look at
[43:25] the detail
[43:26] maybe this is where the Pharaohs got it
[43:28] I don't know
[43:29] but this to describe this to somebody to
[43:33] where they go oh yeah I see the beauty
[43:35] of it can't be done
[43:46] all right
[43:48] try to describe that to somebody
[43:53] it it just
[43:55] you would come way short
[43:58] uh we had a couple of pictures of uh of
[44:01] of some
[44:02] look at this this this this lake is
[44:06] showing the other it looks like the
[44:07] other half of the Sun but it's just a
[44:09] reflection of the top but try to
[44:10] describe that to somebody even if it's
[44:12] standing still like a picture
[44:21] is that all of them okay look at that
[44:24] Lake Michigan we got to get or Lake
[44:26] Superior we got to get that one in there
[44:28] you know describe that that water and
[44:30] what it looks like in the sky
[44:34] you we need eyes to see and comprehend
[44:38] the full world that we live in
[44:42] and it is no different
[44:45] with God's world
[44:48] to go ahead and listen to some man
[44:50] trying to describe
[44:54] the things of God
[44:56] without having spiritual eyes to see is
[45:00] certainly going to come short of seeing
[45:02] exactly what it is
[45:09] some quotes from blind people
[45:12] said many blind people feel
[45:17] they lost their freedom it was taken
[45:19] away from them
[45:21] you know what would be like if you
[45:22] couldn't
[45:24] see anymore you'd be limited
[45:27] one said the worst thing for them was
[45:29] not being able to see details of what
[45:32] were described to them
[45:35] not being able I got that cold after I
[45:39] had come across but it's a vindication
[45:42] one said not being able to see who their
[45:44] grandchildren are really looking like
[45:47] you know Mom or Dad or them or you know
[45:52] one one said the worst thing is one
[45:55] cannot see different colors of life
[45:59] the worst thing you can't see the
[46:01] different colors of life
[46:02] another said good thing one can't see
[46:04] the different colors of humans
[46:08] I like that
[46:12] when a person is blind or Limited in
[46:14] being able to see and comprehend things
[46:16] the way they are and it's no different
[46:19] when a person who is spiritually blind
[46:22] to the word
[46:23] and they can't see and to be honest with
[46:26] you we are all here depending on the
[46:29] Holy Ghost to open these eyes these the
[46:31] spiritual eyes of our heart so we can
[46:34] see
[46:35] amen you see why that course was so
[46:38] fitting
[46:39] that brother Mark
[46:42] I just I'm so grateful that God is
[46:44] amongst us
[46:52] I don't want to be limited to my own
[46:56] understanding to make it to heaven
[46:59] to become the statue of a perfect man to
[47:01] make a Rapture I don't want to depend on
[47:03] my uh own feelings telling me I'm ready
[47:06] and I don't have to do anything else
[47:10] I really want God to open my eyes to see
[47:13] things the way they are amen
[47:16] yes sir there was a Pharisee ruler his
[47:18] name was Nicodemus who wanted to
[47:19] understand spiritual things
[47:23] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[47:25] verily I saying to you except a man is
[47:28] born again he cannot see the king of God
[47:32] he cannot perceive it he cannot be sure
[47:34] he cannot comprehend it it takes a
[47:38] born-again experience now of course
[47:39] being born again it's not entering into
[47:42] your mother's womb again
[47:44] it's when your eyes become opened
[47:48] to a new nature the nature of God
[47:54] hey it's it's when old things are passed
[47:58] away and things begin to not just begin
[48:02] to develop but after they begin to
[48:04] develop they continue to be developed
[48:07] and they keep going until you're out of
[48:09] here and that to me is truly being born
[48:12] again and stopping short of that is way
[48:15] stopping short of God's definition of
[48:18] being born again
[48:19] okay
[48:20] too many people stopped short
[48:22] still claiming to be born again
[48:27] First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 14
[48:29] says the natural man receiveth not the
[48:33] things of the spirit of God
[48:35] so to sit here and listen to the things
[48:38] of God
[48:39] in a natural state you're not going to
[48:41] be able to receive Everything Jesus said
[48:43] I have many things to tell you but you
[48:45] can't bear it now why why it's too hard
[48:48] for you
[48:48] your natural man can't take it but when
[48:52] he the spirit of truth comes now he'll
[48:54] be able to receive it he'll lean guide
[48:57] y'all because he'll be inside of you
[48:59] amen and you won't be easily offended
[49:02] right great peace have they that love my
[49:04] law and nothing shall offend them
[49:06] amen
[49:09] for they are foolishness unto him
[49:11] neither can he know them because they're
[49:15] spiritually discerned
[49:21] our eyes
[49:24] can really tell the difference between
[49:26] those two peacocks
[49:29] right but if we just felt them
[49:34] but we were told the physical size of
[49:36] them
[49:39] you need something our eyes help us
[49:41] discern things so we don't run into them
[49:45] so we if we want a Big Mac we don't go
[49:47] to Burger King
[49:53] we need help hearing from God when we
[49:56] come to church when we read the Bible
[49:58] when we listen to the tapes you know I'm
[50:01] just so astonished we listen to the
[50:03] tapes and we're so interested in finding
[50:05] certain things about what God has said
[50:08] to that prophet and we miss the message
[50:12] the message is the whole thing
[50:16] don't emphasize one let the other go say
[50:18] God I need it all
[50:21] because he gave it all
[50:25] so when the natural man hears about
[50:28] surrendering his will
[50:31] giving his life living for others
[50:33] picking up your cross
[50:39] I don't know that's like foreign to me
[50:43] I think I can be a Christian
[50:46] be in this message
[50:48] still go to heaven
[50:50] I'm going to make a Rapture and I don't
[50:52] have to do that
[51:00] foreign
[51:02] foreign
[51:05] I remember coming to church sitting in
[51:06] church and saying
[51:09] hearing you got to give up that world of
[51:11] music
[51:13] I had long hair when I was at came to
[51:16] church and so I came to the Lord I
[51:18] didn't come all dressed up
[51:20] came as I am and hearing about how a man
[51:24] needs to cut his hair and how a woman
[51:26] needs to let her hair grow out
[51:28] that was foreign to me
[51:34] but when God begins to open your eyes
[51:38] you don't just pay tithes once a month
[51:41] come on when God opens your eyes you
[51:44] become faithful to the word of God
[51:46] faithful to the word of God
[51:49] the problem is we want to have our own
[51:51] man-made religion do what we want when
[51:53] we want to do it justify ourselves when
[51:55] we don't want to do it God ain't in that
[51:58] that is not the holy ghost that is not
[52:01] the faith of God that's not living by
[52:02] the faith of God Amen
[52:06] time
[52:08] verse number 11 for what man knoweth the
[52:11] things of a man save the spirit of a man
[52:15] what's in him
[52:17] how many times you ever said well yeah
[52:19] you know how you know how children are
[52:21] you know how parents are you know how my
[52:23] wives are how husbands are
[52:26] well you know how salesmens are
[52:29] right well you know how men are
[52:32] they just don't know the spirit of God
[52:36] right right for what man knoweth the
[52:39] things of a man say the spirit of man
[52:41] which is in him even so the things of
[52:43] God knoweth no man
[52:46] but the spirit of God so to go ahead and
[52:49] try to use your ability to figure out
[52:52] God it's an insult to God
[52:57] is looking for heart
[53:00] God I need you and this relationship
[53:02] that I have with you only God can open
[53:05] our spiritual Eyes Only God can give us
[53:07] Revelation only God can give us eyes of
[53:09] Faith it's only him
[53:12] our dependency is on him trying to get
[53:15] Revelation from a man
[53:17] it's in vain
[53:19] God said Upon This Rock I'll build my
[53:21] church not upon us trying to figure it
[53:24] out upon the Revelation from Heaven
[53:26] that's where he builds his church today
[53:28] we ought to be looking at him amen the
[53:31] prophet said yeah you know take your
[53:32] eyes off of me if you want to look at me
[53:33] that's fine but God's revelation comes
[53:36] from above amen that's right he can use
[53:39] any vessel he wants to use
[53:41] God is the only one that can open blind
[53:44] eyes
[53:44] [Music]
[53:45] wanting some man or some book
[53:49] to help us see and understand explain or
[53:52] describe truth to us
[53:55] without God Opening Our Eyes is no
[53:58] different than someone trying to
[53:59] describe a peacock who's never seen it
[54:01] before in his life and when you're
[54:03] seeking something about God that means
[54:05] you don't know it
[54:07] amen you've never seen it before
[54:10] no one's got to tell them anymore about
[54:12] that I need to cut my hair right
[54:16] no one needs to tell me anymore I need
[54:19] to pay my tithes nobody because I've got
[54:22] a revelation on it and when you've seen
[54:25] a peacock before you said insult for
[54:27] someone to try to tell you what a
[54:29] peacock looks like
[54:31] trying to figure out on your own trying
[54:35] to figure out God in this close walk and
[54:37] how I can be an overcomer and I can get
[54:39] all get rid of these things in my life
[54:41] that I don't want then how I can live a
[54:43] Victorious Life you need God you need to
[54:46] humble yourself before almighty God
[54:48] that's what's needed
[54:50] [Applause]
[54:51] nothing short of that
[54:58] other than that we're going to come up
[54:59] way short of seeing things the way they
[55:01] really are
[55:05] we can get a better sense
[55:07] from hearing somebody talk about God
[55:10] perhaps than what we had
[55:13] but remember
[55:15] if somebody can talk you into something
[55:19] that means somebody can come and talk
[55:21] you out of it
[55:23] that's why sometimes we are faithful
[55:27] and sometimes we're not
[55:31] because somebody talked you into it
[55:34] and somebody talked you out of it
[55:38] God is looking for faithfulness
[55:42] try to think about God not being
[55:44] faithful
[55:47] his children are faithful
[55:50] well brother John I haven't been real
[55:52] faithful I don't feel I'm a Child of God
[55:53] okay good I'm okay with that what I'm
[55:55] not okay with is you not doing something
[55:57] about it you're not getting up to the
[55:59] Altar and say God I need to get serious
[56:01] I obviously need a spirit in me that
[56:04] creates the faithfulness that I own God
[56:05] God fill me with the Holy Ghost not the
[56:08] knowledge of faithfulness but the spirit
[56:10] of faithfulness
[56:12] amen it's a power greater than knowledge
[56:17] for we walk by faith and not by sight
[56:25] walking by sight
[56:29] spiritually speaking is walking by our
[56:31] own understanding
[56:34] what we think
[56:36] this is my opinion
[56:38] this the way I view it
[56:41] and none of that means anything
[56:43] because that's all Paul had that's all
[56:47] Saul head
[56:49] and he had it all figured out he was
[56:52] taught by the best
[56:54] he was
[56:55] he was the best at everything
[56:58] the only thing is he didn't have the
[57:00] spirit of Christ in him he did it
[57:03] religious as could be
[57:06] works as can be
[57:08] faithful to all that his flesh could do
[57:11] he had zeal
[57:13] but he did not have the spirit of Christ
[57:17] but when he had the spirit of Christ he
[57:19] took on a different nature
[57:22] and no longer accusing others
[57:28] he became a servant to all
[57:32] yes different makeup
[57:36] so instead of looking
[57:37] to man to give us help
[57:40] so depending on the church
[57:43] instead of depended on somebody that you
[57:45] look up to
[57:48] I'm telling you God wants us to start
[57:50] looking to him
[57:52] through eyes of Faith it's a little bit
[57:54] simpler to call somebody say you know
[57:57] what what about this don't tell me I
[57:59] haven't been tempted to call some
[58:00] minister
[58:02] and ask him what he thought about this
[58:04] quote that brother Brandon said
[58:09] was there anything wrong with it no but
[58:11] I'll tell you what if God wants me to
[58:13] know if I seek him and I'm sincere and
[58:15] he wants me to know I believe he'll lead
[58:17] and guide me
[58:22] God's looking for heart in the
[58:24] relationship why are we missing things
[58:26] that we're why do we feel like why do we
[58:28] miss Joy why are we missing the intimacy
[58:31] with Christ that closeness that that
[58:33] love that Joy why are we missing it
[58:36] because it all takes heart it doesn't
[58:38] take knowledge
[58:40] it takes heart and God's looking for
[58:41] heart
[58:44] instead of relying on others or some
[58:46] book God wants us to Humble ourselves
[58:48] and get more serious with him
[58:51] God is the only one
[58:53] that can give us eyes to see
[58:57] the only one that can open her eyes that
[58:59] we can have eyes of faith
[59:03] believe in the Lord so shall ye be
[59:06] established second chronicles 20 20. I
[59:08] always thought that was good Vision
[59:09] believe in the Lord so shall you be
[59:12] established I believe that
[59:14] I believe as the scripture said
[59:17] right A lot of people out there who
[59:19] believe
[59:21] say they believe
[59:23] can't seem to get established in
[59:25] anything
[59:26] Believe In His prophets so shall ye
[59:30] Prosper there's a reason God sent a
[59:32] messenger in this age
[59:36] when we're relying on man's
[59:38] understanding whether it's our own or
[59:39] somebody else's because we can rely on
[59:41] our own
[59:42] we're really not walking with eyes of
[59:44] Faith amen we're walking by sight
[59:51] and we're Limited
[59:53] we limit ourself
[59:55] we limit
[59:57] the power of God in her life
[1:00:00] brother Brandon said in the message
[1:00:02] the power of the devil he says how I
[1:00:04] like to see this little mother with her
[1:00:06] little Ark speaking of Moses's mother
[1:00:12] they're all pitched inside and out and
[1:00:14] slime and pitch on it and now she comes
[1:00:17] down to the river she's not willing
[1:00:19] she's not ready to make her little boy
[1:00:21] and have to to hide them out somewhere
[1:00:24] but by eyes of faith
[1:00:28] she's seen what God was going to do
[1:00:31] she took her right down to the river in
[1:00:33] this little Ark and no doubt we couldn't
[1:00:36] think that was a natural act no one
[1:00:38] would do that naturally
[1:00:41] he said it's got to be a supernatural
[1:00:43] act now the reason I'm reading this is
[1:00:45] God is never going to ask any of you to
[1:00:46] go take your little child and put him
[1:00:47] down by the river no
[1:00:49] but this is in here to let us know that
[1:00:52] God can make contact with a human being
[1:00:54] to let them to know what they need to do
[1:00:56] in their difficult situation
[1:00:58] [Music]
[1:01:01] because when you got the devil and every
[1:01:03] evil thing coming at you
[1:01:07] that there's a God there that can lead
[1:01:09] you out of it there's a supernatural God
[1:01:12] that can lead us to do it and we've just
[1:01:14] got to do it by faith you can't say oh
[1:01:16] God this doesn't make insane there's
[1:01:18] crocodiles down there
[1:01:20] that'll kill my boy I'd rather give him
[1:01:22] a chance
[1:01:26] we can't figure things out we've got to
[1:01:29] start hearing from God then it doesn't
[1:01:31] matter if you understand it or not
[1:01:34] lean not your own understanding
[1:01:36] trust in the Lord with all thy heart
[1:01:39] he promised to guide us
[1:01:42] to lead us
[1:01:45] in all things
[1:01:48] majority of people go to church
[1:01:49] unprepared spiritually
[1:01:52] the majority
[1:01:53] hoping to intellectually try to get
[1:01:56] something
[1:01:57] in other words they're not willing to
[1:01:58] pay the price spiritually but they still
[1:02:01] have this sort of expectation of God I
[1:02:03] want you to help me at this situation I
[1:02:05] want you to you know provide this show
[1:02:07] me that help me with this
[1:02:10] give me a good feeling help me to get
[1:02:12] out of this
[1:02:14] depression I'm in
[1:02:17] but they're not willing to put in what
[1:02:19] they got to put in and I'll say it like
[1:02:21] this God said You shall search me and
[1:02:23] find me you shall seek me and find me
[1:02:25] when you search for me with all your
[1:02:28] heart to love the Lord thy God with all
[1:02:30] that heart with all their soul with all
[1:02:32] they might
[1:02:33] God is looking for more out of us I know
[1:02:37] it's hard it's not a gospel everybody
[1:02:39] wants to hear they'd rather hear a
[1:02:40] gospel about how good you are and how
[1:02:42] what you got inside of you right now you
[1:02:44] can take and you can prosper in your
[1:02:45] life you can become anything you want
[1:02:47] you you don't have to listen to those
[1:02:48] knuckleheads
[1:02:51] that's it people love that
[1:02:53] building their natural self-esteem
[1:03:01] people try service after service to
[1:03:03] figure things out
[1:03:06] no matter how hard the gospel is
[1:03:07] preached they're looking for an easier
[1:03:09] way
[1:03:11] they'll maybe talk about it for an
[1:03:13] easier way
[1:03:15] and they even though God is good to
[1:03:17] everybody he still holds and reserves
[1:03:21] the right of what he's going to do
[1:03:26] now
[1:03:28] many of us can testify about our mother
[1:03:32] or our father when we were growing up we
[1:03:35] could see how one of them was such a
[1:03:38] role model in being nice to everybody
[1:03:41] else that was in the neighborhood
[1:03:44] right sister Joyce was here she would
[1:03:46] let us stay and testify that
[1:03:49] and God is good to everybody right the
[1:03:52] scripture tells us that he's good to
[1:03:54] everybody he's even good to his enemies
[1:03:58] to an extreme Called Love
[1:04:01] to prosper them
[1:04:03] right there's a prosperity in the wicked
[1:04:07] but you know what
[1:04:10] a real father doesn't want his child
[1:04:14] to be without true character
[1:04:18] so there's something on his mind and
[1:04:20] what's on his mind is he wants to build
[1:04:21] a character that can handle things
[1:04:25] that can go through the test
[1:04:28] that can resist the wrong and do the
[1:04:30] right
[1:04:31] and we're in a building process amen
[1:04:33] amen
[1:04:35] God requires heart
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:40] he said strive to enter in because I say
[1:04:42] unto you many will seek to enter in and
[1:04:44] shall not be able
[1:04:48] even though he's good to everybody
[1:04:50] 's not able to enter in
[1:04:55] I'm so glad Prophet taught us
[1:04:59] that we create atmospheres
[1:05:01] that we can create an atmosphere around
[1:05:03] us no matter who's sitting here
[1:05:07] you can create an atmosphere here where
[1:05:10] God can come in
[1:05:12] and build such a powerful relationship
[1:05:14] with you that the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:05:16] Prevail against it
[1:05:17] that's the God we serve
[1:05:19] yes
[1:05:21] Matthew chapter 11 verse 25 at that time
[1:05:25] Jesus answered and said I thank thee Oh
[1:05:29] father
[1:05:30] Lord of Heaven and Earth
[1:05:32] because you hid these things from the
[1:05:36] wise and The Prudent and has revealed
[1:05:39] them unto babes
[1:05:42] now I'll tell you
[1:05:44] a lot of times we feel
[1:05:46] like we're not we're somebody else is at
[1:05:50] we feel more like a babe compared to
[1:05:53] where they're at
[1:05:55] I read this scripture brother Marty it
[1:05:58] would make me want to just shout for joy
[1:06:01] that I don't have to attain to something
[1:06:04] to get God to reveal himself to me
[1:06:12] I mean if I went up to
[1:06:14] one of brother Ferguson's children
[1:06:17] or brother James in the back
[1:06:20] or brother Luke
[1:06:23] and I said you know what who do you
[1:06:26] think you are you can't drive this car
[1:06:30] okay I can't drive the car
[1:06:35] but now say that to brother Stan
[1:06:38] say that to an adult
[1:06:41] you can't drive a car
[1:06:42] I'll show you I can drive a car
[1:06:46] foreign
[1:06:48] prudent
[1:06:50] now here's the thing it's not about us
[1:06:53] knowing how to drive a car it's not
[1:06:56] about the things that we know that he's
[1:06:58] talking about here it's about all the
[1:07:00] things that we don't know yet
[1:07:03] the things that haven't been revealed
[1:07:05] the things that hasn't been told to us
[1:07:09] well we think we got it figured out
[1:07:12] even so father so it seemed good in thy
[1:07:16] sight all things are delivered unto me
[1:07:19] of the father and and no man north of
[1:07:21] some but the father neither knoweth any
[1:07:23] man the father saved the son and he
[1:07:26] to whomsoever
[1:07:29] The Sun Will Reveal him
[1:07:33] unless God comes
[1:07:36] and reveals
[1:07:38] word to us
[1:07:42] we're not going anywhere
[1:07:47] the real Church isn't being built
[1:07:51] I don't care how smart we get
[1:07:53] I don't care how much I don't care how
[1:07:56] much God uses us
[1:07:58] we cannot survive without the revelation
[1:08:01] of Jesus Christ
[1:08:02] amen we cannot survive we cannot be
[1:08:04] Overcomers we cannot make a rapture
[1:08:09] we can't be what God has called us to be
[1:08:12] right
[1:08:15] how many wants God to choose you
[1:08:19] to reveal
[1:08:21] himself too
[1:08:26] and it's real simple
[1:08:28] God
[1:08:30] we're taught that God
[1:08:32] has chosen to hide himself in simplicity
[1:08:37] right
[1:08:39] so don't be wise in your own eyes the
[1:08:41] scripture says
[1:08:42] be not wise in your own eyes
[1:08:45] depart from that evil what is that evil
[1:08:48] that way of thinking that you you got
[1:08:51] things figured out all the time
[1:08:54] don't try to be shrewd and prudent
[1:08:57] don't rely on yourself or your Keen
[1:09:00] discernment or your good judgment on
[1:09:02] situations
[1:09:04] because you're getting yourself away
[1:09:07] from where God is really at
[1:09:11] and God's
[1:09:13] with that little bait that says God I
[1:09:15] need you
[1:09:17] I think I know but you know what
[1:09:20] God I need you whether I know or not I
[1:09:23] need you and I need you to to to to
[1:09:25] stamp it to indicate to to confirm it
[1:09:29] it's HD notice these are spirits or
[1:09:32] attitudes
[1:09:34] humble proud
[1:09:36] negative positive
[1:09:38] it's an attitude
[1:09:40] it's I know or I don't know
[1:09:45] and one draws God's attention a humble
[1:09:48] and contrite
[1:09:50] it broke I will not despise I'm drawn to
[1:09:56] that I want to help that
[1:09:58] but the person who's just all kind of
[1:10:00] figuring oh yeah this is it that's it
[1:10:02] yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:10:08] God resists that
[1:10:10] he hides himself from the wise and
[1:10:12] prudence
[1:10:13] and he reveals himself
[1:10:17] to someone who's got a babe-like
[1:10:20] attitude like okay I know I don't know
[1:10:22] how to drive I've never driven a car
[1:10:24] okay yeah I've never seen this
[1:10:25] Revelation before but you know what I
[1:10:28] want to be faithful with it
[1:10:30] I haven't been faithful with this I know
[1:10:32] it I know it but I want to be Lord help
[1:10:35] me to be
[1:10:37] that's what God's looking for
[1:10:40] and that's who God chooses to reveal
[1:10:42] himself and you know God will hide
[1:10:43] himself from the person who says I don't
[1:10:46] need to be that
[1:10:53] how can we get the things we desire it's
[1:10:56] through an intimate relationship with
[1:10:57] the word when the word becomes important
[1:11:00] to you when God's word that's important
[1:11:02] to him becomes important to you
[1:11:05] that's when you get things
[1:11:08] that you're looking for
[1:11:13] Jesus said if you love me keep my
[1:11:14] Commandments it's important to him
[1:11:16] Heaven and Earth is going to pass away
[1:11:17] but the word is never going to pass away
[1:11:19] it's forever so in heaven it's going to
[1:11:21] judge the whole world the word is
[1:11:23] everything to God
[1:11:25] because it is God
[1:11:27] [Laughter]
[1:11:29] but to us
[1:11:30] it always becomes a choice
[1:11:35] well I I like that but you know that's
[1:11:39] not that necessary
[1:11:41] and it becomes Choice when we come to
[1:11:43] church it's like a smorgasbar we're
[1:11:45] going to take what we want to take and
[1:11:47] we're going to let go and just let kind
[1:11:48] of go in one ear and out the other ear
[1:11:51] or is what brother Johnson you should
[1:11:53] say like water off a duck's back
[1:11:59] God is looking for us to have a a heart
[1:12:03] that's humble humble enough
[1:12:06] humble enough I like that
[1:12:08] to follow the word
[1:12:11] not follow the word that you're already
[1:12:12] following
[1:12:14] God is Not Looking you looking to us to
[1:12:18] correct us with the word that we're
[1:12:19] following
[1:12:20] he's interested in the other part
[1:12:22] because he's coming for a bride without
[1:12:24] spot a wrinkle so obviously God is
[1:12:28] looking to to help us in the areas that
[1:12:31] we need help with
[1:12:33] amen all right so he says here in verse
[1:12:34] 28
[1:12:35] come on to me
[1:12:38] all ye that labor in our heavy laden
[1:12:42] and I will give you rest now we should
[1:12:44] all be able to say that's me Brother
[1:12:46] John
[1:12:48] I'm in labor and just to help my life to
[1:12:50] get it all fixed up to make things
[1:12:52] better and I feel like I get this this
[1:12:54] heavy laden I mean I just I just can't
[1:12:56] seem to get peace and rest
[1:12:59] comes from God
[1:13:02] but we've got to come to him
[1:13:05] I'm not going to keep coming to brother
[1:13:08] Mark
[1:13:11] to get my rest
[1:13:15] I got to go to God
[1:13:18] so when we come to God
[1:13:21] this is what he says
[1:13:23] now that you've come to me you got the
[1:13:25] promise I'm going to give you rest now
[1:13:27] you're going to have peace
[1:13:30] you take my yoke upon you
[1:13:34] in other words you're not all scot-free
[1:13:37] you don't leave church thinking you
[1:13:39] don't have to do anything because God
[1:13:41] did it all
[1:13:43] it's not one of these
[1:13:45] love grace mercy and no cross to bear no
[1:13:50] you have a cross to bear you have a yoke
[1:13:54] to put up to take upon you and you've
[1:13:56] got to do it yourself because God is no
[1:13:58] manipulator he doesn't grab us Hold Us
[1:14:01] by the neck run us down last us yoke
[1:14:04] upon him and then let you go
[1:14:08] he doesn't do that he's not a
[1:14:10] manipulator
[1:14:13] he's a gentleman
[1:14:15] and so you got to just
[1:14:17] Lord this is the word that you gave me
[1:14:19] today
[1:14:20] I place this upon my life
[1:14:24] I will take this word home with me
[1:14:28] I will dress myself with this word
[1:14:31] and I will come to church the next
[1:14:33] service
[1:14:34] now we'll listen to the next tape
[1:14:36] and I will hear your voice and the next
[1:14:38] time I get on my knees and I will live
[1:14:41] by the faith of the Son of God Who Loved
[1:14:44] Me died for me gave his life for me I
[1:14:47] will take this yoke
[1:14:51] take my yoke upon you and learn of me in
[1:14:55] other words you don't have it all
[1:14:57] figured out yet
[1:14:58] you don't know it all yet
[1:15:02] and the only way you can really learn of
[1:15:04] God Is by taking the yoke
[1:15:07] you have to obey the word you hear
[1:15:10] don't wait for God to give you complete
[1:15:13] understanding about paying your tithes
[1:15:15] when you don't have money to pay your
[1:15:17] tithes
[1:15:24] commit
[1:15:25] don't wait to have complete
[1:15:26] understanding to obey Church order
[1:15:32] you either believe the word and you have
[1:15:35] a chance to show and prove that you
[1:15:37] believe it or you doubt it and you're
[1:15:40] walking by sight
[1:15:43] my yoke upon you learn to me for I am
[1:15:47] meek and lowly in heart and you shall
[1:15:49] find rest for your souls for my yoke
[1:15:52] it's easy and my burden is light
[1:15:56] now we know the devil presents this
[1:16:02] easy way to go right the broad way it's
[1:16:06] easy it seems very fun and enjoyable and
[1:16:09] you don't got to worry about anybody
[1:16:12] right you don't gotta you you don't have
[1:16:16] to bear one another's burdens you don't
[1:16:17] have to care about other you don't have
[1:16:19] to live for anybody you can kind of just
[1:16:20] stay at home and do your own thing
[1:16:23] and it seems pretty light but it ends up
[1:16:26] being depressing
[1:16:29] it ends up bringing you down because you
[1:16:33] can only have true Joy when you're
[1:16:35] living for others
[1:16:37] I believe it
[1:16:39] [Music]
[1:16:41] but God has a yoke and he has a burden
[1:16:44] so don't think he doesn't
[1:16:46] the beauty of it it's so much easier and
[1:16:49] so much lighter than the devils
[1:16:52] the devil shows
[1:16:54] you know hey just
[1:16:56] drink this stuff take this stuff and get
[1:16:58] high
[1:17:00] I'm free from all my problems keep doing
[1:17:03] that long enough you'll find out you've
[1:17:05] got cancer
[1:17:07] a little quicker
[1:17:10] see it comes at the end and it's no
[1:17:12] different spiritually I'm going to try
[1:17:14] to figure it out I mean
[1:17:17] Saul's trying to figure it out and and
[1:17:19] he thought he had it figured out
[1:17:26] but at the end he found out he was wrong
[1:17:32] we got to walk by faith and not by sight
[1:17:36] so let's get used to coming to church
[1:17:38] and just obeying the word yes amen
[1:17:40] that's it
[1:17:42] no I've never heard that that's being
[1:17:44] said I didn't feel that nobody else told
[1:17:45] me that that doesn't matter the word
[1:17:48] says it you're in love with the word not
[1:17:50] me
[1:17:51] you're not in love with a man you're
[1:17:53] loving God
[1:17:54] [Music]
[1:17:56] is your husband the word is your husband
[1:18:00] bad things happen when you leans your
[1:18:02] own understanding
[1:18:03] you literally blind yourself more the
[1:18:06] Bible says when you hear the word and
[1:18:08] you don't do it you deceive yourself
[1:18:10] amen right
[1:18:12] the world is is full of spiritual
[1:18:14] blindness people are walking by sight by
[1:18:17] their feelings by what they want
[1:18:20] people who refuse to believe the gospel
[1:18:23] their people without eyes of faith
[1:18:28] second Corinthians 4 verse 3 says but if
[1:18:31] our gospel
[1:18:33] be hid
[1:18:35] it is hit to them that are lost
[1:18:39] in whom the God of this world
[1:18:42] has blinded the minds
[1:18:44] of them which believe not
[1:18:47] lest the light of the Glorious gospel of
[1:18:49] Christ who's in the image of God should
[1:18:51] shine on them
[1:18:54] so who blinds
[1:18:56] our minds
[1:18:59] look we were born in sin shapen in
[1:19:01] iniquity
[1:19:02] we didn't know right from wrong
[1:19:04] even when we were told right from wrong
[1:19:06] we still didn't want to do it still
[1:19:09] didn't believe it still doubted our
[1:19:10] parents
[1:19:11] still wanted to do what we wanted to do
[1:19:15] Satan that tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:19:18] Evil it is the author of blindness
[1:19:23] and if our gospel be hid
[1:19:26] it's hid to them that are lost
[1:19:31] now that's just scares me
[1:19:36] because if something's hid from me
[1:19:40] I want God to show me
[1:19:45] that means I got to get in a state of
[1:19:47] humility
[1:19:49] a state of neediness I am so needy Lord
[1:19:52] so needy of you
[1:19:54] and I've got to stay there and and wait
[1:19:57] until his presence comes
[1:20:00] because it is a supernatural act every
[1:20:03] time you feel the presence of God
[1:20:08] it's the supernatural God coming down
[1:20:11] and visiting you through Humanity
[1:20:15] I love this word
[1:20:19] our churches today they're a blind
[1:20:21] people blind leaders leading the blind
[1:20:24] right Matthew chapter 15 verse 10 we're
[1:20:26] not going to have a chance to get
[1:20:27] through everything that we have here
[1:20:29] today but that's just the way it always
[1:20:31] goes here at Sun Delight Outreach
[1:20:35] Matthew 15 verse 10 and he called the
[1:20:38] multitude and said unto them hear and
[1:20:39] understand
[1:20:41] Jesus said
[1:20:43] and that which goeth into the mouth
[1:20:45] not that which goeth into the mouth
[1:20:48] defiled a man
[1:20:50] but that which cometh out of the mouth
[1:20:52] this defileth a man
[1:20:55] thank you
[1:20:56] then came his disciples and said unto
[1:20:58] him
[1:20:59] don't you know that there were people in
[1:21:01] the congregation that got offended when
[1:21:03] they heard you say that
[1:21:06] and he answered and said every plant
[1:21:09] which my heavenly father hath not
[1:21:12] planted shall be rooted up
[1:21:16] I'm going to tell you what
[1:21:19] if you love the word you are not going
[1:21:21] to get offended
[1:21:25] if you get offended that means your love
[1:21:28] has been towards something else and it
[1:21:31] needs to get back to Christ
[1:21:36] because God is not going to separate his
[1:21:38] word
[1:21:41] from a relationship with you
[1:21:44] just because
[1:21:46] you don't want to hear it
[1:21:49] he's not going to do that
[1:21:52] that means there's the change that has
[1:21:54] to take place is is inside of me
[1:21:57] I've got to love the word whether I
[1:21:59] agree with it or not
[1:22:01] I've got to want it in my life whether
[1:22:04] it's there or not whether it's hard or
[1:22:05] not I've got to want it
[1:22:10] he said let them alone
[1:22:13] they'd be blind leaders of the Blind and
[1:22:17] if the blind lead the blind both fall
[1:22:19] into the ditch
[1:22:21] now I want to take a look at this word
[1:22:23] blind
[1:22:25] how many's ever dealt with stain before
[1:22:30] okay or paint
[1:22:31] s you know usually
[1:22:34] understand have you ever worked with
[1:22:36] paint before
[1:22:38] hasn't he done a great job
[1:22:40] brother Stan he's done such a wonderful
[1:22:42] job here
[1:22:45] there are paints that are solid paints
[1:22:47] and when you got a real bad thing that
[1:22:49] you want to cover up you you want a
[1:22:51] thick paint right a paint that covers
[1:22:53] that doesn't bleed through
[1:22:56] and then sometimes we have to use that
[1:22:58] stuff called kills that's killed the
[1:22:59] stains
[1:23:00] but they also have
[1:23:02] stains and paints that are opaque opaque
[1:23:06] am I saying that right opaque
[1:23:09] and and in other words it's not total
[1:23:12] that color but semi and sometimes
[1:23:15] they'll put that on wood to give it the
[1:23:16] old-fashioned look
[1:23:18] in this word blind when you look it up
[1:23:20] means opaque
[1:23:23] so there are these these blind leaders
[1:23:25] they have truth of them
[1:23:27] they see certain things
[1:23:29] but they also have a
[1:23:31] of a blindness to other things
[1:23:35] and here they are
[1:23:37] they know Christ in a certain way
[1:23:40] but they're missing out
[1:23:43] in another way
[1:23:46] so there are leaders who simply don't
[1:23:48] know everything they're talking about
[1:23:51] come on say amen amen I want to move on
[1:23:54] I got a lot of stuff to hear I got a lot
[1:23:55] of hay start eating
[1:23:58] there are leaders who think they see
[1:24:00] things clearly and they really don't
[1:24:03] there are people trying to tell you what
[1:24:05] to do who aren't leading you correctly
[1:24:10] now come on I need this word to
[1:24:12] penetrate your heart
[1:24:14] and when you choose to follow their
[1:24:16] enticing ways you'll end up falling into
[1:24:19] a ditch
[1:24:20] just like them
[1:24:23] they just don't know it
[1:24:26] just because our heavenly father hasn't
[1:24:29] planted them doesn't mean they don't
[1:24:30] have the ability to lead
[1:24:32] right
[1:24:34] Hitler had the ability to lead
[1:24:36] I mean you got great leaders out there
[1:24:38] they got the ability to lead but that
[1:24:40] doesn't mean
[1:24:42] that God planted them
[1:24:45] eventually they're going to be rooted up
[1:24:47] because they didn't stay a lot of
[1:24:49] Christians they don't stay by the rivers
[1:24:51] of Living Water amen turn with me if you
[1:24:54] would to Matthew chapter 13.
[1:24:58] if we could just I didn't give in the
[1:25:01] the scripture but if we could get this
[1:25:03] on the on the screen here today Matthew
[1:25:06] 13 verse 14 Matthew 13 verse 14. this
[1:25:10] came to me just before we came up and in
[1:25:13] them is the fulfilled the prophecy of
[1:25:16] isaiahs which saith by hearing you shall
[1:25:17] hear and shall not understand
[1:25:20] in sin you shall see and not
[1:25:22] perceived now that this is a lot of
[1:25:24] people in church right a lot of leaders
[1:25:27] a lot of people
[1:25:28] he said for this people not all people
[1:25:31] but this people's heart
[1:25:33] is wax girls now why don't they see
[1:25:36] because the condition of the heart this
[1:25:39] is what I want to get to if you want
[1:25:40] more with God start dealing with your
[1:25:42] heart
[1:25:46] for this people's heart is wax gross
[1:25:48] their eyes are dull of hearing they're
[1:25:52] jealous they just they come in they hear
[1:25:54] and they they just don't want to listen
[1:25:55] anymore
[1:25:57] and their eyes have been closed less of
[1:26:00] any time they should see with their eyes
[1:26:01] and hear with their ears and should
[1:26:03] understand what their heart and should
[1:26:05] be converted and I should heal them
[1:26:10] he said but blessed
[1:26:13] are your eyes I want you to think about
[1:26:16] where you're at in the economy of God
[1:26:18] compared to the world
[1:26:20] when you read this scripture
[1:26:22] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[1:26:26] and your ears for they hear
[1:26:30] for verily I was saying to you that many
[1:26:32] prophets and righteous men have desired
[1:26:34] to see the things which you see and have
[1:26:36] not seen them and to hear the things
[1:26:37] which you hear and have not heard them
[1:26:45] we have been blessed with the truth of
[1:26:49] this message
[1:26:51] we are so blessed
[1:26:54] and yet
[1:26:56] we take things for granted
[1:27:00] you should you ever go up to the table
[1:27:02] eat food
[1:27:05] dinner after dinner after dinner after
[1:27:07] dinner
[1:27:08] and just expect it
[1:27:10] yeah
[1:27:13] because you lived there
[1:27:15] because
[1:27:17] because you're part of the family
[1:27:19] however you want to say that
[1:27:22] imagine
[1:27:24] life's wives imagine being married to
[1:27:28] somebody who you feed over and over and
[1:27:31] over
[1:27:32] clean their dishes over and over
[1:27:36] prepare over and over and over
[1:27:39] and they are not thankful right they're
[1:27:43] blessed
[1:27:44] but they're not thankful
[1:27:47] so when Jesus is saying it blessed is
[1:27:49] your eyes for they see
[1:27:51] you have been brought into the message
[1:27:54] of the hour by the by the supernatural
[1:27:57] power of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:58] leading you to this message
[1:28:01] why is there other people in my family
[1:28:03] that can't see it
[1:28:06] why did God open my eyes why can I see
[1:28:09] it because my eyes are blessed
[1:28:13] and what are we doing with our blessings
[1:28:16] taking things for granted
[1:28:19] not being thankful to God enough
[1:28:23] come on
[1:28:25] he comes and he gives you his heart
[1:28:29] when you come to church he gives you his
[1:28:31] heart he's given you his word that he's
[1:28:34] been preparing for weeks to this day
[1:28:39] and we think well that's just some man's
[1:28:41] view about the scriptures
[1:28:43] and you're missing the very God that's
[1:28:45] sitting among you
[1:28:47] and where is he at in your heart
[1:28:50] and not recognizing it because you're
[1:28:52] not looking through eyes of faith
[1:28:56] I say today that there are many people
[1:28:58] that wish they could have taken our
[1:29:00] place in here that's what Jesus said
[1:29:04] all right do we still have some time
[1:29:06] amen it's not even
[1:29:09] it's not even over yet I mean it's crew
[1:29:11] you got time I say that after
[1:29:14] gotta gotta hold on all right Matthew 23
[1:29:18] verse 23.
[1:29:23] this is boy I'd like to try to get
[1:29:24] through this subject of
[1:29:27] we can just
[1:29:29] I suppose we can just
[1:29:31] take our time with this one and and just
[1:29:33] come come back to it
[1:29:36] all right Matthew 23 verse 23 woe unto
[1:29:39] you scribes and Pharisees
[1:29:41] so it's a group of people he calls
[1:29:43] hypocrites
[1:29:47] for you pay tithes of mint and Ennis and
[1:29:50] conman
[1:29:51] and have omitted the weighty matters of
[1:29:53] the law judgment mercy and faith
[1:29:56] these things all ye have done and not to
[1:29:59] leave the other undone
[1:30:06] ye blind guides
[1:30:08] those are conductors
[1:30:11] a guide a conductor a shower and we're
[1:30:14] all guides we all talk to somebody and
[1:30:16] tell somebody what to do
[1:30:18] right all right
[1:30:22] which strain at a net and swallow
[1:30:26] a camel
[1:30:27] now that is real small right
[1:30:30] you'll spend time
[1:30:33] making sure you take care of this
[1:30:35] wonderful thing that's on your mind that
[1:30:38] bothers you
[1:30:40] but then you'll just gallop
[1:30:42] a hole
[1:30:45] another subject that is so much
[1:30:47] weightier and greater
[1:30:50] and more important to God
[1:30:55] he calls it a weightier matter so
[1:30:57] however you want to Define that a more
[1:31:00] important it's all important the words
[1:31:02] all important but there's nothing more
[1:31:04] important than our relationship with
[1:31:06] Christ
[1:31:07] nothing amen nothing more important
[1:31:10] and our conduct and how we love God how
[1:31:14] we love the word how we want to display
[1:31:16] the word
[1:31:19] so these blind guides
[1:31:23] it's not just discipling others but
[1:31:25] their own lives
[1:31:27] some people try to filter out some small
[1:31:29] detail that's wrong
[1:31:33] and they miss being able
[1:31:36] to love everybody
[1:31:40] it's a weightier matter
[1:31:43] so they strain at a certain thing and
[1:31:45] swallow a camel
[1:31:50] Jesus says you have admitted the
[1:31:52] weightier matters
[1:31:55] judgment Mercy faith
[1:31:57] these things what you have done and not
[1:31:59] to leave the other undone
[1:32:02] so what's let's just take judgment
[1:32:05] judgment sometimes we leave out judgment
[1:32:08] now I'm going to be honest with you
[1:32:12] so often not so often but you ever get
[1:32:15] down on your knees you're getting ready
[1:32:17] to pray and all sudden you start
[1:32:19] thinking about other people how they're
[1:32:20] doing wrong
[1:32:23] come on
[1:32:26] now that's not God
[1:32:28] right and that's not you
[1:32:30] that's Satan
[1:32:32] he's he's going to give you some reason
[1:32:36] to think negative about somebody and he
[1:32:38] ain't going to take some lie he's not
[1:32:41] going to tell me
[1:32:43] that brother Mark is over here stealing
[1:32:45] a vehicle
[1:32:47] right brother stands stealing about out
[1:32:49] of the bank it's not going to give you
[1:32:51] that thought he's going to give you a
[1:32:53] thought of something that you've seen at
[1:32:55] church last time
[1:32:57] how somebody acted towards you he's
[1:33:00] going to bring that up in your mind
[1:33:04] so this judgment is not about judging
[1:33:07] others
[1:33:09] because honestly we have no problem
[1:33:11] judging others
[1:33:12] we have a hard time stopping ourselves
[1:33:14] from judging others
[1:33:16] but where the thing that we've left out
[1:33:19] is judging ourselves
[1:33:21] judging our own motives
[1:33:24] taking time to to look and am I really
[1:33:27] following the word
[1:33:31] am I holding myself accountable to
[1:33:35] laying down my life to bear in my
[1:33:38] brother or sister's burden to helping
[1:33:40] others to esteeming others better than
[1:33:43] myself
[1:33:44] like
[1:33:46] sometimes we omit
[1:33:49] the things
[1:33:51] that we should be doing
[1:33:53] but will stand proud as a peacock and
[1:33:56] stare at the things that we do do and
[1:33:57] say I don't need to do that right
[1:34:01] so I'll say you don't got to be a
[1:34:03] Pharisee or
[1:34:06] Republican or sadducee or one of the
[1:34:09] religious per all you got to do is just
[1:34:12] get away from an intimate relationship
[1:34:15] with Christ
[1:34:17] and you can let
[1:34:19] these important things going we need to
[1:34:21] be dedicated to the to God's house we
[1:34:23] need to be laboring for souls and we
[1:34:25] don't even hold ourselves accountable to
[1:34:27] those things we need to judge ourselves
[1:34:30] to see if we've omitted anything
[1:34:33] from our walk with God
[1:34:36] Mercy
[1:34:38] how many
[1:34:39] how many really really really has
[1:34:42] omitted wanting Mercy For Your Life
[1:34:48] how many has really omitted wanting
[1:34:52] Mercy
[1:34:53] for your life
[1:34:56] hey I know why
[1:34:58] let me say it again
[1:35:00] how many has omitted
[1:35:02] wanting
[1:35:04] Mercy
[1:35:06] I mean have you ever said God I don't
[1:35:08] want your mercy
[1:35:11] I don't need your mercy
[1:35:17] everybody in this world Christian or not
[1:35:19] Christian wants Mercy when they need it
[1:35:23] when they realize they need it they want
[1:35:26] it
[1:35:28] but they they don't admit omit it
[1:35:33] we omit being merciful to others when
[1:35:37] they need it
[1:35:39] when they need Mercy we omit it
[1:35:43] because we hold this power of I'll be
[1:35:45] merciful to who I'll be merciful to
[1:35:48] right and so a lot of times people are
[1:35:51] not very merciful to others that's why
[1:35:52] they speak negatively or think
[1:35:54] negatively of others
[1:35:57] so
[1:35:59] the reason they're light that is because
[1:36:00] they don't hold very much Mercy in their
[1:36:03] heart
[1:36:04] they only got a limited amount
[1:36:07] and so what they do is they hold it now
[1:36:09] for certain people
[1:36:11] certain situations more of a respecter
[1:36:14] of persons who they're going to have
[1:36:16] mercy on
[1:36:18] but Jesus taught us at the end
[1:36:22] if we're not merciful if we don't
[1:36:24] forgive
[1:36:26] that God wasn't going to forgive us
[1:36:29] but these Pharisees and Sadducees and
[1:36:32] people who get this spirit
[1:36:34] which we ask hey look it this word hits
[1:36:37] us
[1:36:38] right your name don't got to be Pharisee
[1:36:41] for it not to hit you all you got to do
[1:36:43] is fulfill the same thing
[1:36:47] we omit being merciful to others
[1:36:52] but we we don't have a very hard time
[1:36:54] saying well this is what I think of that
[1:36:56] brother the sister what they did you
[1:36:57] know and
[1:36:58] are thinking these thoughts about one
[1:37:01] another
[1:37:02] brother sister we're mid omitting the
[1:37:05] weightier matters of life
[1:37:07] because we're not seen through eyes of
[1:37:10] Faith that's why
[1:37:12] that's why
[1:37:14] faith we can't omit faith without faith
[1:37:18] we can't even please God
[1:37:20] don't come to church without faith
[1:37:23] so I'm going to hear from God and not
[1:37:25] only am I going to hear from God I'm
[1:37:27] going to go do it whether I feel like it
[1:37:28] whether I got what I want or not
[1:37:31] I'm here because I'm a soldier of the
[1:37:34] Cross and I'm going to follow through
[1:37:35] with what he said
[1:37:37] okay verse 25 for woe unto you
[1:37:40] describes Pharisees Hypocrites for you
[1:37:43] may clean the outside of the cup
[1:37:45] and of the platter but within their full
[1:37:49] of exhort extortion and excess
[1:37:55] Thou blind Pharisees cleanse first
[1:37:58] that which is within the cup and the
[1:38:00] platter
[1:38:02] and the outside
[1:38:04] of them may be cleaned that the outside
[1:38:07] of them may also be clean in other words
[1:38:09] you automatically live a good life
[1:38:14] when it's happening from the inside
[1:38:18] but too often we try to do the right
[1:38:20] thing on the outside
[1:38:23] and it's really hasn't been settled on
[1:38:25] the inside
[1:38:28] so what is really Jesus warning us of
[1:38:30] here that there are religious people out
[1:38:33] there
[1:38:34] who can
[1:38:36] talk
[1:38:39] or walk in such a way
[1:38:42] that
[1:38:46] the emphasis is only on part of the word
[1:38:52] and if you notice when somebody's
[1:38:54] talking to you
[1:38:56] when somebody says something negative to
[1:38:58] you about somebody else and don't tell
[1:39:00] me it doesn't happen
[1:39:04] because it does assures the devil is
[1:39:07] around it happens he'll find somebody
[1:39:13] it's always about some minor thing not
[1:39:17] always but a lot of times it's about
[1:39:18] some minor thing
[1:39:21] that you'll strain out that gnat just
[1:39:25] strain it out make sure that you know we
[1:39:27] shouldn't have that in our church that
[1:39:29] shouldn't be like that now brother that
[1:39:30] shouldn't be like that in that sister
[1:39:31] and if omitted
[1:39:33] getting on your knees and praying
[1:39:37] omitted uniting with that person that
[1:39:40] you're telling and saying look at I
[1:39:41] don't I can't talk I just got something
[1:39:42] out of my heart let's go to God In
[1:39:44] Prayer
[1:39:45] admitted that admitted Mercy omitted
[1:39:48] Mercy oh message you know what I'm not
[1:39:51] guilty of that but I'm probably guilty
[1:39:52] of a lot more omitted the reality right
[1:39:56] the big picture
[1:40:03] don't leave the important things
[1:40:07] that God is trying to speak to you
[1:40:10] don't admit them don't leave them
[1:40:13] don't leave them at church don't go home
[1:40:15] and forget about what was spoken to you
[1:40:17] today
[1:40:18] take it home pray about it
[1:40:22] let God speak to you because if you
[1:40:24] think God is okay about just coming to
[1:40:26] church and going home and living the
[1:40:28] same old life you need to find another
[1:40:30] church that unites with that thought
[1:40:31] process
[1:40:34] God's in the cleanup business
[1:40:37] God is interested in seeing Our Lives
[1:40:40] become more like him
[1:40:41] Proverbs 3 verse 3 we're going to be
[1:40:44] we're just going to have to find a spot
[1:40:45] here let not mercy and Truth for safety
[1:40:49] bind them upon thy neck write them upon
[1:40:51] the table of your heart
[1:40:54] look at that mercy and Truth
[1:40:57] for sake let not mercy and Truth forsake
[1:41:02] you
[1:41:03] wear a necklace
[1:41:07] when people look at you let them see on
[1:41:11] you
[1:41:12] this thing that's called Mercy
[1:41:18] I don't really I don't really mean a
[1:41:19] real necklace that says Mercy
[1:41:22] I'm talking about something that's
[1:41:23] invisible where you're whole you're how
[1:41:26] you handle things people say well that
[1:41:28] was God that was Mercy
[1:41:31] and the truth about Mercy that we've not
[1:41:33] omitted it
[1:41:35] bind them upon thy neck write them upon
[1:41:37] the table of thine heart so shall thou
[1:41:39] find favor
[1:41:41] and good understanding
[1:41:44] in the sight of God
[1:41:46] and Men
[1:41:48] amen God bless you let's just stand
[1:41:50] together
[1:41:52] if we don't long
[1:41:55] for all the word
[1:41:58] we're going to end up following
[1:42:01] someone
[1:42:03] who just takes part of the word
[1:42:07] now
[1:42:09] that statement that I just said
[1:42:12] is a big warning to us
[1:42:15] we're all following somebody
[1:42:19] I don't want to be a part
[1:42:22] of just God's
[1:42:25] a part of God's word
[1:42:28] I don't want just a part of God's peace
[1:42:32] I don't want just part of God's joy part
[1:42:35] of God's love
[1:42:37] I I want to be filled with God
[1:42:43] we all got friends and we all got people
[1:42:45] we hang out through they say that you
[1:42:47] are a combination of The Five People You
[1:42:49] do you talk to the majority of the time
[1:42:52] I want to say this
[1:42:54] if you don't love the word more than
[1:42:57] anything
[1:42:59] you will end up following someone
[1:43:02] who loves the word as much as you do
[1:43:06] because birds of the feather flock
[1:43:09] together
[1:43:10] you'll find somebody that's like you but
[1:43:14] I don't want to be like anybody here
[1:43:16] I want to be like Jesus I want to be
[1:43:19] like the word he's our Mentor he's our
[1:43:22] example
[1:43:24] so let not mercy and Truth forsake you
[1:43:28] if it forsakes somebody else
[1:43:30] that's okay
[1:43:32] pray for him
[1:43:33] but you you have a choice free more
[1:43:35] agency you stick with it by you staying
[1:43:38] with all the word you have a chance to
[1:43:40] help that person
[1:43:42] amen do you love the word
[1:43:45] all right I I I I do I feel bad that I
[1:43:48] wasn't able to
[1:43:50] you know do the whole uh service today
[1:43:52] but it would just say it's like a a a
[1:43:55] part and if God would will
[1:43:59] um and we we don't know but if God will
[1:44:01] we could try to take another part but
[1:44:04] because I do believe God wants us
[1:44:05] ultimately to be walking with eyes of
[1:44:09] faith eyes of faith and we really really
[1:44:12] haven't dove into it like I want we've
[1:44:13] been talking about some natural eyes
[1:44:16] that are religious eyes and eyes that
[1:44:18] are looking at things maybe the things
[1:44:20] of God in a natural way and how
[1:44:22] upsetting it could be and leaving out
[1:44:24] weightier matters and not paying
[1:44:25] attention to to the big picture
[1:44:28] which is which is all his word but by
[1:44:30] the grace of God I believe that he's
[1:44:32] going to to help us don't you amen let's
[1:44:35] look to the Lord in just a word of
[1:44:37] Prayer
[1:44:41] say with every eye closed every head
[1:44:44] bowed
[1:44:55] our eyes are closed
[1:44:59] I trust every every person here is
[1:45:02] reverencing the Lord just this time
[1:45:04] between
[1:45:07] us as individuals
[1:45:10] and the Lord
[1:45:11] perhaps there's someone here today that
[1:45:14] knows God has spoken to you
[1:45:23] you know God is calling you
[1:45:29] get more serious
[1:45:33] start paying attention to the things
[1:45:35] that God is speaking to you
[1:45:40] and this morning you're responding back
[1:45:43] to him
[1:45:45] just lifting up your your hand the hand
[1:45:48] of your that's in your heart
[1:45:50] God sees your heart
[1:45:56] God sees your desire
[1:46:04] God Will Make A Way
[1:46:08] God is calling
[1:46:11] the humble
[1:46:13] the Bible says the humble shall hear and
[1:46:17] be glad
[1:46:19] God is calling us his bride
[1:46:25] and he's he's a real gentleman to us
[1:46:29] but I do believe that we
[1:46:31] we need to make a commitment to him
[1:46:35] we need to leave here determined
[1:46:38] not to let Satan
[1:46:40] control us
[1:46:42] control our time and our Direction and
[1:46:45] our philosophies and
[1:46:47] but just to take this word and to get
[1:46:50] dressed in it and to become more like
[1:46:52] him
[1:46:54] you believe with me now as we pray we go
[1:46:58] to our Heavenly Father in prayer
[1:47:01] father
[1:47:04] there was a reason that
[1:47:07] Jesus prayed I thank thee father Heaven
[1:47:10] and Earth that thou has hid these things
[1:47:12] from the wise and prudent
[1:47:15] we don't know all things
[1:47:18] but we know that
[1:47:22] there's no fools they're going to
[1:47:24] stumble into heaven
[1:47:27] you are the door you are the door keeper
[1:47:33] and Lord that door is open for your
[1:47:35] sheep to go in and out
[1:47:37] to find good pasture
[1:47:40] and Lord we are we have been blessed
[1:47:43] with eyes to see this message
[1:47:46] in this hour the
[1:47:49] and we've received it
[1:47:52] that God
[1:47:55] we know the things of the world can
[1:47:57] distract us from
[1:47:59] pressing in to all that this message has
[1:48:02] taught us
[1:48:05] father you see our hearts your hands
[1:48:08] have been raised the hands that are in
[1:48:10] her heart

[1:48:17] would take our lives
[1:48:20] with the word that you have just given
[1:48:22] us today
[1:48:25] and Lord
[1:48:27] we by faith are writing them upon the
[1:48:30] tables of our heart
[1:48:33] we're putting on the chains of Truth and
[1:48:36] mercy
[1:48:37] we're binding them
[1:48:40] Lord we want to be associated with you
[1:48:42] and your word
[1:48:45] we want to mature and to grow up
[1:48:51] we want to become the body that you
[1:48:53] you're going to marry Lord
[1:48:57] I pray for every heart here today that's
[1:49:00] Desiring
[1:49:01] this
[1:49:03] may you come and Grant it for them
[1:49:06] Lord as they look
[1:49:09] Through The Eyes of faith believing that
[1:49:12] it was you that has spoken to them they
[1:49:14] now will receive it and have received it
[1:49:17] may you now Prosper their life Lord
[1:49:20] bring these things to Remembrance in the
[1:49:22] days to come
[1:49:25] and help us all Lord as we're growing
[1:49:27] into that statue of a perfect man more
[1:49:30] and more and more
