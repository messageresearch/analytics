[1:16] that you would come and make the word
[1:18] real to us today amen Lord we don't want

[1:32] that you take away our
[1:34] thoughts take away our understanding

[1:56] service where we humbly pray in your
[1:59] precious name name amen amen amen second
[2:02] Timothy chapter 1 verse number s very
[2:05] familiar for God have not given us the
[2:08] spirit of
[2:10] fear but of
[2:12] power and of
[2:14] love and of a sound mind isn't that a
[2:17] beautiful scripture let's just read the
[2:19] next verse as well uh be not thou
[2:23] therefore ashamed of the testimony of
[2:25] the Lord nor of me his prisoner but be
[2:29] thou
[2:31] partaker of the afflictions of The
[2:34] Gospel According to the power of God
[2:37] Amen and then in Exodus chapter
[2:41] 14 Exodus chapter
[2:43] 14 and we're going to read verses 13-
[2:47] 15 this is
[2:49] where uh the children of Israel are
[2:54] standing at the Red Sea kind of in a in
[2:58] a place of great suffering because it
[3:01] didn't look like any way of that they
[3:03] could see that that it could be an
[3:06] escape and Moses said unto the people
[3:09] fear ye not stand still and see the
[3:13] salvation of the
[3:14] Lord which he will show to you today for
[3:18] the Egyptians who you have seen today
[3:22] you shall see them again no more
[3:26] forever the Lord shall fight for you and
[3:30] ye shall hold your peace and the Lord
[3:33] said unto Moses wherefore criest thou
[3:37] unto me speak unto the children of
[3:39] Israel that they go forward amen God
[3:44] bless you you may be seated we want in t
[3:45] of this message moving forward but with
[3:48] a subject with the right mental
[3:51] attitude with Clarity with a sound mind
[3:54] with confidence and a lot of times when
[3:57] we're facing our afflictions our trials
[3:59] and our test there's a very big
[4:02] hesitancy to moving forward in fact
[4:05] usually when we're facing trials we're
[4:08] facing what we would call A A Time of
[4:11] suffering a time of suffering um we
[4:15] don't want to go through it we don't
[4:16] want to face it we don't want to talk to
[4:18] the person we don't want to uh come to
[4:21] grips with the reality that we're going
[4:23] to face some hardship so we want we have
[4:26] that tendency of not moving forward
[4:28] we're kind of like sit back and we don't
[4:31] want to place ourselves in that position
[4:34] but if we could I just want to start
[4:36] back in Chapter 13 and just try to spend
[4:38] some time reading here as we enter into
[4:41] this uh situation starting with chapter
[4:44] 13 and and verse number
[4:48] 17 and it came to pass when Pharaoh had
[4:51] let the people go that God LED them not
[4:55] through the way the land of the
[4:57] Philistines although that was was near
[5:00] for God said lest preventure the people
[5:03] repent when they see war and they return
[5:06] to Egypt so God knows what he's
[5:09] doing God knows that our weaknesses and
[5:12] that we could have a tendency of not
[5:13] being going all the way with God but God
[5:17] led the people about through the way of
[5:19] the Wilderness of the Red Sea and the
[5:22] children of Israel went up harnessed out
[5:25] of the land of Egypt and this word is
[5:28] like so powerful to me you know when you
[5:30] got a dog that just kind of going all
[5:32] over you you put a harness on them and
[5:35] and sometimes you you need to put a
[5:38] choke chain on him sometimes you got to
[5:39] put this whole thing on him so you can
[5:42] grab them
[5:43] better and when I think of the word
[5:46] harness I'm thinking that they're not
[5:48] allowed to just kind of do what they
[5:50] want to do that's right and so God leted
[5:53] him out of Egypt with a mighty
[5:55] Deliverance right killed basically the
[5:58] 10 plages
[6:01] all that they went through they saw the
[6:02] hand of God in a mighty way and the
[6:07] basically Pharaoh kicked him out of
[6:09] Egypt
[6:11] go and so it was almost like God was in
[6:14] control so he it they were under his
[6:17] harness are you with me so far that's
[6:19] right
[6:21] okay and Moses uh took the bones of
[6:25] Joseph with him for he straightly sworn
[6:29] the children of Israel saying God will
[6:31] surely visit you and you shall carry my
[6:32] bones away from hence with you and they
[6:35] took their Journey from sucko and
[6:37] encamped to e them into the edge of the
[6:39] Wilderness and the Lord went before them
[6:42] by a pillar of cloud uh to lead them the
[6:47] way and by Night a pillar fire to give
[6:50] them light to go by day and night so
[6:53] here the statement is made in verse 21
[6:57] that God was with them day or night God
[6:59] was doing the
[7:00] leading and he took not away the pillar
[7:03] of the cloud by day nor the pillar of
[7:05] Fire by night from before the people in
[7:09] verse Chapter 14 verse one and the Lord
[7:11] spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the
[7:13] children of Israel that they turn and
[7:16] encamp
[7:18] from fil that word between migdal and
[7:24] the Sea and against peris
[7:26] ofum before it shall ye shall encamp by
[7:30] the Sea so let me just say it like this
[7:32] the children of Israel looked like they
[7:34] were going in a a much easier way and
[7:37] God said
[7:38] turn the pillar of fire says no we're
[7:41] going to turn now where God was leading
[7:43] them and this is like the crutch of the
[7:46] whole service today is we must
[7:48] understand that God was pointing them to
[7:50] the middle of their
[7:51] trial amen he was pointing them into an
[7:55] an insal situation that they would never
[7:58] choose to be in and you will see this
[8:00] because they begin to murmur they want
[8:02] to go back to the Egypt and they were
[8:04] you know started this complaining
[8:05] because the trial was so great but yet
[8:07] the Holy Spirit was leading them right
[8:09] to here and we not we need to remember
[8:12] this in our lives when we're going
[8:13] through our trials God has pointing us
[8:16] to go there we're the ones that saying
[8:18] no I don't want to go there but there's
[8:20] a reason for it oh there a reason for it
[8:24] for Pharaoh will say of the children of
[8:26] Israel they are entangled in the land
[8:29] the Wilderness has shut them in and I
[8:31] will harden Pharaoh's heart and he shall
[8:33] follow after them and I will be honored
[8:36] upon pharaoh and upon all his host that
[8:39] the Egyptians may know that I am the
[8:42] Lord and they did so and it was told
[8:45] that the king of Egypt and it was told
[8:47] that the king of Egypt that the people
[8:49] fled in the heart of pharaoh and of his
[8:51] servants was turned against the people
[8:54] and they said why have we done this why
[8:55] we let Israel go from serving us and he
[8:59] and he he made ready his chariots and he
[9:01] took his people with him and he took 600
[9:04] chosen chariots and all the Chariots of
[9:06] Egypt and the captains over every one of
[9:08] them and the Lord hardened the heart of
[9:10] pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued
[9:12] after the children of Israel and the
[9:14] children of Israel went out with a high
[9:17] hand and the Egyptians pursued after
[9:19] them and all the horses and the Chariots
[9:21] of pharaoh and his Horsemen and his
[9:24] armies overtook them en camping them by
[9:26] the Sea beside pill hyra
[9:31] before be zifon and when Pharaoh Drew
[9:36] nigh the children of Israel lifted up
[9:39] their eyes and behold the Egyptians
[9:42] marched after them and they were sore
[9:45] afraid and the children of Israel Cried
[9:48] Out unto the
[9:50] Lord what we do when we are in a trial
[9:54] um now um the fear makes us us um not
[10:02] have confidence in what we're doing fear
[10:05] is there because Satan is wanting to put
[10:09] us in a box he's wanting to make us feel
[10:12] like there's it's a hopeless
[10:15] situation and God wanted them to be
[10:18] there this is what's important God LED
[10:20] them to the situation he knows the end
[10:22] from the beginning he knows how we're
[10:24] going to react to certain situations but
[10:27] what what God is really wanting he's in
[10:29] the people to know that God is with
[10:33] them and we we can't face situations and
[10:36] think God's not
[10:38] there God wants us to know he's here and
[10:41] this this is something that's happened
[10:43] in the natural but we'd like to try to
[10:45] show it in the type in the reason for it
[10:47] there's a purpose in it as
[10:49] well and they said unto Moses because
[10:53] there was no graves in Egypt thou has
[10:56] taken us away to die in the wilderness
[10:59] what a
[11:01] cutdown what an absolute slapping of
[11:03] Fate To The General Moses to the prophet
[11:07] of God yes sir mocking him was there not
[11:11] enough graves in Egypt you had to bring
[11:12] us out here to
[11:14] die isn't that terrible they did not
[11:17] have a sound
[11:21] mind they were so moved by fear in other
[11:25] words the all the deliverances that just
[11:28] happened
[11:29] in Egypt did not build their
[11:35] faith didn't build their faith like it
[11:38] should
[11:40] have he says wherefore has thou doubt
[11:43] with us to carry us forth out of Egypt
[11:47] is not this the word we did tell thee in
[11:50] Egypt saying let us
[11:53] alone that we may serve the
[11:56] Egyptians but it had been better for us
[11:59] to to serve the
[12:00] Egyptians than that we should die in the
[12:03] wilderness now that is really a true
[12:06] statement but they just did not have
[12:09] faith that God was was going to deliver
[12:13] them and a lot of times when we we're in
[12:15] our trial we cannot see God delivering
[12:18] us of this because we're staring at
[12:20] human beings who standing in the way of
[12:23] getting the victory
[12:26] amen and because they're doing this
[12:28] because they said that because they're
[12:30] acting like this all they see is you
[12:32] know I would rather be over here than in
[12:34] that situation why not be right exactly
[12:37] where God wants you to be and face the
[12:40] situation because God wants us to
[12:42] overcome
[12:45] that God knew what he was doing by
[12:47] Leading them
[12:50] there and Moses said to the people fear
[12:55] not stand still and see
[12:59] yeah the salvation of the
[13:02] Lord that's the that's the biggest thing
[13:05] that we can do is when we're facing a
[13:08] problem don't be scared of
[13:10] it don't back up don't run don't say I
[13:13] don't want to deal with this don't say I
[13:16] can't handle this I can't take it no
[13:18] more I've done I didn't sign up for this
[13:20] you know all the things that are spoken
[13:22] all the things that come to our
[13:26] head stand still and and and see the
[13:29] salvation of the
[13:31] Lord and we need to see with our hearts
[13:34] because obviously these children of
[13:36] Israel they saw all these Miracles that
[13:38] they've never seen before in their life
[13:40] the the frogs the Flies everything that
[13:43] transpired the firstborn dying the light
[13:45] in in uh uh uh their Camp while in the
[13:49] enemy's Camp there was Darkness they
[13:51] seen all this but they seen it with
[13:53] these eyes and not eyes of
[13:56] faith and if we do not see God in the
[13:59] spirit realm then we don't see God at
[14:05] all then it's like well I'm not going to
[14:07] believe until I see the put my finger in
[14:10] his
[14:11] hand that's why we need to see God in
[14:14] the word that's right that's a it's an
[14:17] invisible word it the holy spirit is a
[14:21] is a Living Word and we need to see God
[14:25] in
[14:25] it fear not stand still and see the
[14:28] salvation the Lord which he will show
[14:31] you today for the Egyptians who you have
[14:34] seen today you shall see them again no
[14:37] more forever and this is what I love
[14:39] about about the victory that we have
[14:43] when we Face our trials I don't care if
[14:45] we need Deliverance over something we
[14:48] need a we need Victory we need joy we
[14:51] need peace we need direction in our life
[14:54] we need something when we can have the
[14:57] confidence that there is going to be an
[15:00] end to the enemy's
[15:03] torment that that I'm going to trust God
[15:06] that's what it means to stand still
[15:08] trust God Amen today he's going to take
[15:12] care of this
[15:13] amen the Lord shall fight for you and
[15:17] you shall hold your peace you don't have
[15:20] to get there and try to straighten the
[15:21] thing
[15:23] out what you need to do is learn to
[15:26] trust God
[15:30] that's the greatest thing is to trust
[15:31] God in your
[15:33] situation we don't need to figure it out
[15:35] we need know God's got it handled amen
[15:38] and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore
[15:40] criest thou unto me speak to the
[15:42] children of Israel that they go
[15:45] forward that they go forward so here
[15:48] they are in the middle of their
[15:51] trial the enemies coming after the Holy
[15:54] Spirit Led them to kind of a a place
[15:57] where they couldn't get out
[16:00] and their whole being is like I'm a
[16:02] they're they're crying against the the
[16:05] leadership right the the the the the
[16:07] Holy Ghost leadership they're they're
[16:09] whining against it they're murmuring
[16:11] against it they're here in this
[16:13] corner they know uh Pharaoh's coming
[16:17] after them they're going to kill them
[16:18] and God's saying go
[16:20] forward go forward in the middle of your
[16:22] trial well what does that mean how do I
[16:23] go
[16:24] forward this is it we got to get out of
[16:28] our understand standing get out of our
[16:30] reasoning get out of our imagination get
[16:32] out of how we're looking at things and
[16:34] so and see that God is right there and
[16:37] he's wanting to do something in your
[16:38] life
[16:40] amen what is he wanting to do I'm just
[16:42] going to make it real clear he wants to
[16:44] build
[16:47] character and he can't do it outside of
[16:49] a
[16:50] trial God is not going to build
[16:52] character outside of a trial because
[16:54] then it would be gifted we could sit
[16:56] there in a seminary and learn about God
[16:58] and have character that don't
[17:01] exist knowledge Puffs you
[17:08] up I don't want to get ahead of
[17:12] myself verse
[17:15] 16 and he says but lift thou up thy rod
[17:18] and stretch out thine hand over the sea
[17:20] and divide it and the children of Israel
[17:22] shall go on dry land through the midst
[17:24] of the sea and I behold I will harden
[17:27] the hearts of the egyp ipans and they
[17:30] shall follow after them and I will get
[17:32] honor upon pharaoh and upon his host and
[17:35] his chariots and upon his Horsemen and
[17:37] the Egyptians shall know that I am the
[17:39] Lord and I have gotten my honor upon
[17:42] pharaoh and and his chariots and upon
[17:43] his Horsemen and the angel of God which
[17:46] went before the camp of Israel to lead
[17:48] them now went behind them in the pillar
[17:52] of cloud went behind their faces and
[17:54] stood behind them so what was God doing
[17:57] he was being a protector
[17:59] from the enemy so when we go in the
[18:01] middle of a trial and we're like really
[18:03] dealing with a spirit that's like real
[18:06] evil you got to know that God is wanting
[18:09] you to move forward in his will knowing
[18:12] that you are protected by the Holy
[18:16] Spirit you don't have to be
[18:19] afraid God is there to do exceedingly to
[18:23] fight the
[18:24] battle but you've got to have faith in
[18:27] God that he's there right amen this is
[18:30] not a
[18:31] story this is a reality for us church
[18:34] thank you Jesus a reality that we can
[18:37] start looking at the problems in our
[18:38] life with faith in
[18:41] God that's what this is here for it's
[18:43] for our
[18:47] ammunition and it came between the camp
[18:50] and the Egyptians and the camp of Israel
[18:53] and it was a cloud of Darkness to
[18:56] them but it gave light
[19:00] by night to these so that one came near
[19:03] the other all that one came not near the
[19:06] other all night isn't that something
[19:07] you're in a situation you can see
[19:09] spiritually what's happening yes sir you
[19:11] can see spiritually what's happening but
[19:13] the other person is they're looking
[19:15] through eyes of
[19:17] carnality they really can't see what's
[19:19] going on it's like a Darkness to them
[19:21] but you see clearly
[19:23] spiritually and that's what the Holy
[19:25] Spirit does and Moses stretched out his
[19:29] hand over the sea and the Lord caused
[19:31] the sea to go back by a strong wind and
[19:33] all that night and made the sea dry and
[19:38] uh the sea the the sea dry land and the
[19:41] waters were divided we know the story
[19:43] that the children of Israel walked
[19:45] across on dry land and they got through
[19:48] with no problem and God took those same
[19:52] Waters after they the enemy was pursuing
[19:55] them and then destroyed them but we us
[19:59] human beings we got well I got to see
[20:01] this up here I I want to make sure that
[20:04] you know the enemy is is corrected they
[20:06] shouldn't have follow this they
[20:07] shouldn't be doing that I shouldn't be a
[20:09] slave to them that shouldn't be
[20:10] happening that needs to be corrected
[20:12] that's how we think but God don't want
[20:15] us to think like that he don't want us
[20:16] to lean to our own understanding in all
[20:18] their ways acknowledge the Lord he shall
[20:20] direct thy paths there has to be this
[20:23] faith and confidence that God is with me
[20:25] in the middle of my
[20:27] trial else
[20:29] is if you can see God in the middle of
[20:31] your trial you have a chance of building
[20:33] character but if you can't see God
[20:36] you'll never make the right decisions
[20:39] and character is not wrought without
[20:41] suffering that's
[20:44] right there's a reason God brought you
[20:46] to the trial there's a reason God
[20:48] allowed this in your life because God is
[20:50] wanting to build character in you amen
[20:53] it's the only
[20:55] reason it doesn't take joy in seeing
[20:58] people suffer
[21:00] ER but he does take joy in seeing his
[21:03] character inside of us
[21:10] right A lot of times we try to
[21:13] escape our
[21:16] situations when really God is leading
[21:21] us to go to the situation to go into the
[21:25] situation but we get
[21:27] scared though they talked to me that way
[21:29] they shouldn't have done that and then
[21:31] we have a a a self-embedded resistance
[21:35] to just I don't want to deal with that I
[21:38] don't want to deal with that can you
[21:40] imagine the Lord Jesus saying I don't
[21:42] want to deal with your problem I don't
[21:44] want to deal with that demon I don't
[21:47] want to deal with that
[21:48] sickness no no I'm not my God he's
[21:53] Mighty in battle he's not afraid of any
[21:56] demon and the Holy Spirit lives we're
[21:58] not going to be afraid of dealing with
[22:00] problems in our home problems in our
[22:02] marriage problems at our work problems
[22:04] in our church he God is Not Afraid we
[22:06] should not be afraid God has not given
[22:08] us the spirit of fear but power and love
[22:10] and of a sound mind amen and who I tell
[22:14] you if you can't use it in the middle of
[22:16] a trial what good is
[22:17] it I don't want some plaque on the wall
[22:20] that says I'm a Believer in Christ I
[22:22] want it living inside of
[22:25] me on demonstration
[22:29] can't be on demonstration till I get in
[22:31] hot
[22:32] water
[22:34] right I could line this whole thing up
[22:37] with all the cups in our house you know
[22:39] we had a lot of cups in our house that
[22:42] we had so many we brought them here and
[22:43] they're in the kitchen I can put hot
[22:46] water in every one of them and put tea
[22:48] bags in every one of them and you would
[22:50] not know what is what until you tasted
[22:52] it that's
[22:55] good it could be laying there without
[22:59] being in hot water you'd be guessing yes
[23:01] sir but it isn't until you put it in hot
[23:03] water and then you taste it and you see
[23:05] if it's what it
[23:07] is and we should not be afraid of
[23:10] problems be afraid of not having God on
[23:14] the inside to take care of that problem
[23:16] everybody wants to say I got God but
[23:18] they don't want to face the problem what
[23:20] is
[23:21] that it's not
[23:23] real it's not
[23:25] real look what I'm trying to say is I'm
[23:28] not saying go out there and cause
[23:31] problems what I am saying is that when
[23:33] there is a problem don't be
[23:37] afraid because that is exactly what God
[23:40] told Moses to tell the children of
[23:42] Israel don't be afraid of this Army
[23:44] coming after
[23:46] you I have a purpose in all this and you
[23:50] need to face this situation without fear
[23:54] in fact you need to face it with this
[23:56] right mental attitude and that is is I'm
[23:58] moving
[23:59] forward I'm moving forward I don't know
[24:03] where to go I've never been this I've
[24:04] never had this happen I haven't I
[24:06] nobody's ever taught me before what to
[24:07] do in this situation I don't know that's
[24:10] okay but you have the Holy Ghost and if
[24:12] he says move forward that's all you do
[24:14] you move
[24:16] forward so you move forward in the
[24:19] middle of your trial with faith that God
[24:21] is with
[24:24] you God never said tell the children of
[24:27] Israel look I got a great plan I'm gonna
[24:30] open up this water you're going to go
[24:32] through on dry R in fact I'm going to
[24:33] give you like a little video what's
[24:35] going to happen he didn't do
[24:39] that he didn't even do that to Moses
[24:41] when he threw down the snake threw down
[24:43] the rod and it came a snake he didn't
[24:45] have any idea that's what The Magicians
[24:48] were going to do so he had to step out
[24:51] there by faith and I'm telling you the
[24:53] biggest thing is we get in our trials
[24:56] and We complain and we murmur about them
[24:57] it just comes automatically like the
[24:59] children of Israel but God's spirit is
[25:01] don't do that right walk forward trust
[25:05] me I will meet you
[25:09] there walk forward and I'll take care of
[25:12] it trust
[25:15] me hardest thing to do but character
[25:19] can't be built unless we're trusting God
[25:22] because you're going to be in the middle
[25:23] of a trial middle of a test and you know
[25:26] your character don't come by just going
[25:28] through
[25:29] trials you know many people are going
[25:31] through trials and suffering in the
[25:32] world they ain't got no
[25:34] character right say not going through
[25:37] trials that give you character it's it's
[25:40] making the right decision in the trial
[25:42] to either trust God or to run away to
[25:46] murmur or go
[25:53] forward I love that God leads us into
[25:56] trials
[25:58] I
[25:59] do he's got
[26:04] confidence like if you're trying to
[26:06] teach your child
[26:11] to
[26:13] um ride a
[26:16] tricycle you you you you got confidence
[26:19] even though they've never done it before
[26:21] that they will eventually about to do
[26:23] it because you you you got that I mean
[26:27] every one of children that learn to
[26:30] drive a
[26:31] vehicle as much as you didn't want to be
[26:33] in the car with them at that time you
[26:36] you knew that this two would pass and
[26:38] they would be driving yes sir God is not
[26:42] going to put us in a trial without
[26:44] confidence in
[26:46] us we're the one that need confidence in
[26:52] him God wanted to show forth his glory
[26:56] that's true the Bible tells us I will
[26:58] will get Glory out of pH I'll get Glory
[26:59] out of his Horsemen and his chariots I
[27:02] will get
[27:04] Glory but you know what also he was
[27:07] wanting he was wanting his own people to
[27:12] see that they could trust in
[27:15] him and they didn't get
[27:18] this because they didn't make it into
[27:20] the promised
[27:22] land there the the trial that you're
[27:24] going through is an opportunity to build
[27:29] faith in God for something
[27:32] greater but if we can't handle this the
[27:35] Bible says if you can't keep up with the
[27:37] footmen how are you going to keep up
[27:38] with the
[27:39] horses you've got to be able to handle
[27:42] the trial that's in front of you with
[27:43] this confidence God would not put
[27:46] anything on you that you couldn't handle
[27:49] right God is faithful that he would not
[27:51] put anything on you you can't bear but
[27:52] he will make a way of Escape now this is
[27:54] it here are these people they're all how
[27:57] what's going to happen what's how I I've
[27:59] never seen the water part and I've never
[28:00] seen so what's going to
[28:02] happen God puts us all in these
[28:04] situations every one of us could stand
[28:06] and testify about some trial in their
[28:09] life that nobody else has gone through
[28:11] except
[28:16] them but the an is the same for every
[28:19] trial and that is trust God in that
[28:22] trial amen and he'll make a way
[28:29] God brought the children of Israel into
[28:31] an impossible situation but he made a
[28:34] way of escape and it's really no
[28:37] different than the believer today A lot
[28:39] of times we're trying to avoid dealing
[28:42] with certain things situations and we're
[28:44] wanting God to handle the situation
[28:47] without
[28:49] them catch what I'm saying we're wanting
[28:51] God to handle the situation without
[28:54] using Us in the situation yeah
[28:59] and the thing is how am I going to get
[29:00] character if I'm going to sit here and
[29:02] wait for God to do
[29:04] it God wants to use my mouth God wants
[29:08] to use my prayers God wants to use my
[29:11] faith my confidence in him God is moved
[29:15] right if God is touched by the feelings
[29:16] of our infirmities he's certainly moved
[29:18] by our prayers
[29:20] Hallelujah so I we all play a part in
[29:23] getting our character and I'm telling
[29:25] you we're not born with the character of
[29:27] Christ amen
[29:28] in fact our flesh hates doing what we
[29:31] need to do to get
[29:38] character we need to just trust
[29:42] God that God will always meet us in the
[29:45] middle of the trial but but brother John
[29:47] you don't understand they're just
[29:49] they're yelling at me they're screaming
[29:50] at they they're they're they're they're
[29:51] they're hitting me they they said they
[29:53] won't talk to me no more they they they
[29:55] said that that if I don't pay my rent
[29:58] that that I'm I'm going to lose
[30:02] everything what reason do we have not to
[30:05] trust
[30:06] God see God is proving
[30:09] us just like he proved the children of
[30:12] Israel after they went through the Red
[30:14] Sea and went through the Wilderness many
[30:16] times God proved them to see if they
[30:17] would trust
[30:19] him and instead of instead of saying God
[30:23] help me to make it through this trial
[30:24] help me to trust you right here help me
[30:26] to hold your unchanging hand right here
[30:28] help me to just just stay here because I
[30:29] know that you're real in my life God you
[30:31] didn't you didn't bring me in this truth
[30:33] to just had me be some sit person on a
[30:36] chair but you brought me here to become
[30:38] a manifested Son of
[30:42] God that's what you got to say with
[30:44] every trial you know a lot of times we
[30:45] go through trials and we spend more time
[30:47] talking about how bad the trial is and
[30:49] how bad the person is and this shouldn't
[30:51] have happened they shouldn't have done
[30:52] that and it's not fair and it's not
[30:54] right and we don't even think about God
[30:56] being with us right there amen
[30:59] we give the devil more Glory about our
[31:01] trials than we do
[31:03] God it's like what are we looking
[31:07] at God ain't going to get any Glory out
[31:10] of out of it if you can't trust him in
[31:11] the middle of a
[31:15] trial God said I'll never leave you I'll
[31:18] never forsake you
[31:21] amen
[31:25] amen if you can see God in your trials
[31:28] as you're going through
[31:29] them you've got spiritual
[31:34] eyes give me the cold on that I I am
[31:36] quing I am you quot
[31:39] me you know we it's easy to look back
[31:42] brother Ram says that you know people so
[31:44] have a tendency to look back and say I
[31:46] see God over over here what he did over
[31:48] here I can see it now or or look into
[31:50] what God's going to do in a Rapture but
[31:52] they failed to see God where he's at
[31:54] presently and we've got to see God in
[31:56] our trials that's the only way will
[31:58] we'll get the character we need we're so
[32:00] focused that I wish I would have to deal
[32:01] with I wish this wasn't here I wish I
[32:03] these Spirits weren't around me we we
[32:05] think like
[32:06] that we need to be thinking God is
[32:11] here and if God is here I don't have to
[32:14] be
[32:16] afraid because there's a spirit the Holy
[32:20] Spirit the same God that's not afraid
[32:23] outside of me is the same God that's not
[32:26] afraid inside of me amen
[32:29] for God has not given us the spirit of
[32:31] fear I don't know about anybody
[32:34] else but brother John don't you think
[32:36] they got here's here's the thing
[32:40] Saints if you fear I am not saying that
[32:43] you don't have the Holy Ghost at all I
[32:47] would never even think that thought for
[32:48] a second what I am telling you is if
[32:52] there is a spirit of fear on of you what
[32:54] you need to do is yield to the holy
[32:56] ghost that lives inside you
[32:59] because Spirits can get on
[33:01] us and and most of the time when we're
[33:03] going through a trial what moves us to
[33:05] complain and to
[33:07] murmur it's
[33:09] fear it's fear that is happening whereas
[33:13] if we looked at like if we all knew the
[33:17] end result when we went through the
[33:20] trial we would never fear it's a big
[33:22] deal big deal because we knew the end
[33:27] but because we're not having faith that
[33:30] God is with us now we you know we don't
[33:33] live by sight amen we don't live by
[33:38] sight of of of seeing the end we live by
[33:41] faith that God is with us as we move
[33:43] forward we're trusting him that takes
[33:46] character it takes character to trust
[33:49] God in our trial it takes no character
[33:52] at all to sit there and say that's wrong
[33:54] this is that shouldn't be happening this
[33:57] is so bad
[33:59] it don't take any character the devil's
[34:01] an ace at it he's the accuser of the
[34:04] brother he can pull out our faults he
[34:07] pulls out enough faults in every one of
[34:08] our lives that we should we would just
[34:10] be totally
[34:13] depressed 1 Corinthians 10:13 there have
[34:16] no temptation taken you but such as
[34:20] common to man just to think about your
[34:24] your trials are just common that's true
[34:29] the devil wants to make you think that
[34:33] it's
[34:34] not but it's
[34:36] common but God who is faithful in other
[34:39] words he's in control of everything
[34:41] right who will not suffer you to be
[34:44] tempted above that you're able but will
[34:47] with the Temptation also make a way of
[34:49] Escape that you may be able to Bear let
[34:50] me just say this in a natural realm when
[34:52] you've T tried to teach your children
[34:54] something like you would never put a
[34:57] four-year-old
[34:58] in in in the car seat of your car and
[35:01] say okay I want you to drive it to the
[35:02] store go
[35:04] ahead you have given them something that
[35:07] you know they can't
[35:10] handle God do not want to give us a
[35:14] trial that's higher than what we're able
[35:17] to handle
[35:19] amen he knows that we we're we're a
[35:21] little bit older we can handle a little
[35:23] bit more we've been serving him a little
[35:24] bit he G so he gives us a trial no
[35:28] higher than what we can handle and that
[35:30] that just gives me so much confidence
[35:31] right that gives me confidence that I
[35:33] don't have to be afraid amen and I'll
[35:37] tell you what if you don't learn to
[35:39] trust God you know what's going to
[35:40] happen don't you you're going to keep
[35:43] going through the
[35:44] trial you're going to keep going through
[35:46] the same thing or something very similar
[35:48] let me just say it like that until you
[35:50] learn to handle the situation the right
[35:53] way because I'm telling you what God is
[35:55] after he's after his own character
[35:57] inside of you he is not interested in
[36:00] just our
[36:01] well-being for our flesh I mean he's
[36:04] interested in our spiritual wellbeing I
[36:06] would that you would prosper in all
[36:08] things even as they soul prospers he's
[36:10] wanting to see his image inside of us
[36:13] amen so what's going to bring that it
[36:15] only comes to a trial so we have to come
[36:18] to face with you know I just can't wait
[36:19] till this service is over and we get to
[36:21] more of an encouraging service you know
[36:23] because really this is not really
[36:25] helping me I am telling you if you don't
[36:26] get the revelation of the importance of
[36:28] facing your trials with
[36:30] faith God is not given us the spirit of
[36:33] fear but Faith Power Sound Mind face
[36:39] it Paul said to Timothy be up thou a
[36:41] partaker of the afflictions of Christ
[36:44] just come and be a partaker don't say I
[36:46] don't want to do that no I I shouldn't
[36:49] have to do
[36:54] that all we need to say is Lord help me
[36:57] Lord help me help me not to help me to
[37:00] have the right mental attitude in other
[37:02] words come into the trial knowing it's
[37:05] not comfortable it's not enjoyable don't
[37:09] want to be here but I do know God is
[37:12] here because the pillar of fire led me
[37:15] here he allowed this person to get
[37:17] bothered allow this person to get upset
[37:20] allow this thing L allow me to lose my
[37:22] job allow me to to to run out of
[37:25] finances allow me to get sick allow all
[37:27] this to happen to me but you know what I
[37:30] know God wouldn't leave me
[37:33] alone so I can I can I can have faith
[37:36] that God will help me through the
[37:39] situation see as soon as the devil can
[37:41] get us
[37:44] scared he's we're
[37:47] defeated because fear is the opposite of
[37:50] faith and without faith we can't please
[37:53] Goden so we need faith in the middle of
[37:56] our trial
[38:01] amen God did not lead the children of
[38:04] Israel to a place of Temptation that was
[38:07] greater than they could
[38:09] handle and God will not lead us to that
[38:11] place
[38:13] either he understands we're four years
[38:15] old and we can't drive the car yet
[38:18] that's right amen and I'm so thankful he
[38:22] knows my
[38:23] age he knows what I can handle and what
[38:26] I can't handle and you know you may be
[38:28] to handle a lot more than I can handle
[38:30] yes so God's going to give you a lot
[38:34] more that's right and when I grow up
[38:36] then I'll be able to handle what you can
[38:39] handle because eventually I need to
[38:41] handle
[38:42] it because I got to make a
[38:45] Rapture and I can't I I I can't stay
[38:48] being a baby I can't stay a
[38:51] weakling I got I got to grow up into the
[38:54] statue of a perfect
[38:55] man because God God is marrying a mature
[39:05] woman H A lot of times people give into
[39:09] the
[39:14] temptation of not paying their tithes
[39:17] and their offerings because they don't
[39:18] got
[39:20] money give into the temptation of uh
[39:24] needing to work on the Lord's Day
[39:28] or skipping out on going to church or
[39:30] listening to tapes or reading the Bible
[39:32] or praying or or just reaching out to
[39:35] somebody because you care about them
[39:41] yes getting on your on your knees to to
[39:44] pray for somebody instead of getting on
[39:46] your knees because you need
[39:49] help and so there's there's so many
[39:52] Temptations right so many Temptations
[39:56] and people a lot of times
[39:57] give into the temptation but I'll say it
[40:00] like this God will never put anything on
[40:03] you that you can't bear so if you don't
[40:05] got money to pay your tie then you know
[40:08] something is wrong because God doesn't
[40:12] lie God never is not there will there
[40:15] will never be on the day of judgment one
[40:17] person that will stand before God and
[40:18] say God I could not pay my ties because
[40:21] I did not have enough money not a one
[40:25] not a one
[40:31] I couldn't go to church and be faithful
[40:33] be there won't be a one not a
[40:37] one but what we want to do in a caral
[40:40] state is make our own
[40:43] religion our own view of what we think
[40:47] the message
[40:51] is and instead of meeting God in the
[40:53] trial with faith we're meeting God in
[40:56] the in the middle of the trial with
[40:59] reasoning yes sir with
[41:02] excuses with you don't understand God
[41:05] understands God
[41:09] knows look if we can't be honest with
[41:13] ourselves how are we going to be honest
[41:14] with
[41:15] God are you with
[41:18] me if we're not faithful with the things
[41:21] that we can do how are we going to
[41:24] become faithful with greater things
[41:28] Jude chapter 1 verse 20 Jude chapter 1
[41:30] verse2 I'm allowed to say chapter 1 even
[41:33] though there's only one
[41:35] chapter I'm not saying it because I'm
[41:38] afraid you go to chapter
[41:41] two I'm saying it because it is chapter
[41:45] one all right but
[41:48] beloved building up
[41:52] yourself on your Most Holy
[41:55] Faith praying in the the Holy Ghost so
[41:58] you can't just allow Faith to stay
[42:00] stagnant in your
[42:01] life you've actually got to build up
[42:04] yourself yes sir you've got to do the
[42:06] things that build
[42:08] Faith yeah I wish just coming to church
[42:10] hearing the word would just
[42:12] automatically give Faith but it don't
[42:15] work like that you've actually got to
[42:16] say that what you just said I know is
[42:19] for my life I will believe this I will
[42:22] hold to it I will start doing it now
[42:25] that is building faith
[42:30] verse 21 keeping yourselves in the love
[42:34] of God that's right keeping yourself in
[42:39] the love of God try try to build
[42:44] character without being in love with
[42:45] Jesus you'll run away from your
[42:48] trials you got to keep yourself in love
[42:51] because God did not want the children of
[42:53] Israel to go no please I don't want this
[42:56] I I'm going back to
[42:58] Egypt I'm leaving this trial I don't
[43:00] want to stay here it's too
[43:03] hot the word it hurts too
[43:06] much keep yourself in love with God love
[43:10] the word of God love the word of God
[43:13] love it because that is what delivers us
[43:17] it's the word looking for the mercy of
[43:20] our Lord Jesus Christ on etal that when
[43:22] we're in a trial what are we looking for
[43:24] when you're honestly going through a
[43:26] trial and it's it's hurting it's
[43:27] suffering what are you looking
[43:29] for we we're looking for help we're
[43:32] looking for mercy God help
[43:34] me it doesn't even matter if it's not
[43:37] your fault you're still looking for
[43:39] Mercy to have this thing lifted from you
[43:42] yes that's true and of some have
[43:46] compassion making a difference so take
[43:49] it take it to the next to the next you
[43:53] know the difference between love and
[43:55] compassion
[43:58] you know the difference between being
[44:00] loved and
[44:02] loving everybody loves being loved by
[44:06] God but loving God is different he says
[44:10] if you love me keep my
[44:12] commandments so when you being loved by
[44:15] people is the it's very enjoyable when
[44:19] they really love
[44:22] you but now when you have to love
[44:25] them that's harder
[44:28] but it makes a difference some having
[44:30] compassion making a difference that's
[44:33] what makes the difference brother BR
[44:35] says it like this it takes a bigger man
[44:37] to get underneath a little
[44:40] man because you know uh a a guy that's
[44:44] all puffed up or a girl that's all
[44:45] puffed up you know isn't going to bow
[44:48] down and cater to them and um you know
[44:52] act like they they're needy in other
[44:54] words they're going to act like they're
[44:55] not part of the body
[44:57] right but but when you realize that your
[45:00] Fallen brother your Fallen sister is in
[45:02] in a place that they need help then
[45:06] compassion on them in their situation is
[45:09] what's going to make the difference look
[45:11] at and others saved with fear pulling
[45:13] them out of the fire hating in the
[45:15] garments spotted by flesh we've got to
[45:18] hate when we see the devil uh trying to
[45:22] make his imprint on on on other people
[45:24] and just we got to pull them out of the
[45:27] we got to hate what's what's going on
[45:29] Amen 1 John 4:18 1 John 4:18 there is no
[45:35] fear in love Z I like that brother zero
[45:42] I love
[45:45] that when you see
[45:48] yourself battl
[45:51] fear when you see fear attacking you
[45:54] when you say well there's just no hope
[45:55] in this situation
[45:58] what is needed is love inside your heart
[46:02] amen perfect love cast out
[46:07] fear
[46:09] now think about this this just let's go
[46:13] back to the situation the children of
[46:16] Israel come out of Egypt they're there
[46:18] at the uh Red Sea God directs them to a
[46:21] place to get as it were more CAU there's
[46:23] no way of Escape because he wanted them
[46:25] there imagine that they stood there and
[46:29] they just said I'm not afraid I trust
[46:33] God now that's what God wanted right I I
[46:37] love God so much I trust
[46:39] him there was so much love for God in
[46:43] their heart that fear could not
[46:47] penetrate
[46:49] them and you know we look at as is the
[46:54] love of God like like we can't put
[46:56] possess that kind of love and I'm here
[46:59] to tell you you can possess it amen you
[47:01] can possess the love of
[47:04] God not a love for God that we want we
[47:08] want to be part of his family we want
[47:10] him to bless us we want him to prosper
[47:12] us I'm talking about a love that says
[47:14] God you put me in this trial and I will
[47:16] not
[47:17] complain I'm talking about that kind of
[47:19] love I'm talking about a kind of love
[47:21] that though he slay me yet why trust him
[47:23] that kind of
[47:25] love there is no no fear in love but
[47:27] perfect love it cast out fear because
[47:31] fear has torment amen and he that
[47:35] feareth there's just something wrong
[47:38] he's not made perfect in
[47:40] love there's something
[47:43] missing when we're operating by
[47:46] fear we love him because he first love
[47:49] us there's our confidence right there
[47:51] he's right there he's the one that
[47:54] taught us to ride the tricycle he's the
[47:55] one that can teach us to drive the car
[47:57] he's there to help us make a way when
[48:01] our attitude is move forward right move
[48:04] forward in our trial God is Not Afraid
[48:08] with dealing with problems
[48:11] am why should
[48:15] we why should we be
[48:22] afraid I say we we need the right mental
[48:25] attitude as we move forward Ward we
[48:28] can't just say God you got to deal with
[48:30] it we can't say I'm just going to I'm
[48:34] just going to I'm just gonna do that's
[48:36] all I'm GNA do now God wants us to move
[48:39] forward okay for okay just I'm just
[48:41] really trying to bring this home right
[48:44] okay so uh somebody ask you to go a mile
[48:47] go to somebody slaps you in the face
[48:50] turn your other cheek help us Lord
[48:53] somebody does wrong to you go go to them
[48:56] and and and and help them that is right
[48:59] help
[49:01] them in other words move forward without
[49:04] fear do not wait for them to come back
[49:07] and say I'm sorry I hit your
[49:10] cheek be Christ to
[49:13] them and you know what it's hard to find
[49:16] that you know what we need to do we need
[49:19] to practice that in our homes because if
[49:21] we can do it in our homes we can do it
[49:23] with others amen
[49:27] but it's a real thing God is real this
[49:29] word is
[49:30] real and it it it's not that we want the
[49:33] word to conform to our life we need to
[49:35] conform to the word
[49:37] amen so God is Not Afraid of dealing
[49:40] with problems and he is literally this
[49:43] is the hardest pill to swallow I think
[49:45] God is literally leading us into the
[49:47] middle of
[49:51] problems and how many times you said do
[49:54] I ain't doing that ain't going there
[49:59] because remember it's through fre more
[50:01] agency that character is built it's not
[50:03] a gift you got to like Paul told Timothy
[50:07] be a partaker be a partaker come and be
[50:10] a partaker because it's something more
[50:12] than this Affliction right the Bible
[50:14] says our our light afflictions which are
[50:17] are for a moment are not worthy to be
[50:18] compared with the glory that shall be
[50:20] revealed in us now what is that Glory
[50:22] that's the character of Jesus
[50:25] Christ and so we we can't be bothered by
[50:28] problems brother Bram said in the
[50:30] message the way of a true prophet he
[50:32] says as I said the other night it seems
[50:35] to be today that the whole church is
[50:37] built upon the main thing amongst the
[50:39] Brethren today of the churches as
[50:41] numbers numbers one's trying to outdo
[50:44] the other one numbers God don't count
[50:47] numbers he counts character amen
[50:51] character is what God is looking to find
[50:53] amen somebody he can get his hands on
[50:57] somebody that will stand still long
[51:01] enough in the infallible word of God
[51:03] brother BR says and a man's character is
[51:05] shown in his
[51:08] works his character is shown by his
[51:11] works we know that just like a a
[51:13] contractor a contractor shows what he is
[51:16] by his works for instance if he was
[51:19] going to have a great building built in
[51:21] the city of Chicago the first thing the
[51:23] officials of the City Board would do
[51:25] they would try to select a contractor
[51:28] not just anyone that could run
[51:31] it well I can do the job all right no
[51:34] they're going to get a contractor that's
[51:36] got a
[51:38] reputation some sort of history of
[51:40] faithfulness right yes and now because
[51:44] if they didn't maybe another contractor
[51:46] would underbid the contractor but he
[51:48] would put in the building bad material
[51:51] and perhaps he would build a $1,000 less
[51:55] build it for thousands of dollars less
[51:57] but then we we come to find out that the
[51:59] B building would
[52:01] collapse the first storm that hit it it
[52:03] went it would go down what do you think
[52:06] the city would think about that
[52:08] contractor it would ruin the reputation
[52:11] forever so this is what I'm trying to
[52:14] say God doesn't want you to just be able
[52:19] to stay in a
[52:22] church until the Rapture happens
[52:29] he is trying to build his character
[52:31] inside of us because our character will
[52:34] not make a Rapture even if we're
[52:36] faithful to sit in church every service
[52:38] the doors are
[52:39] open in the message the choosing of a
[52:41] bride brother man said he's looking for
[52:43] her he's looking for her character the
[52:46] character of Christ he's looking for her
[52:49] character the character of Christ now
[52:51] just a moment now that's it he chooses a
[52:54] bride to reflect his character to which
[52:57] the modern churches of today certainly
[52:59] miss his program here A Million
[53:04] Miles because they deny this to be the
[53:07] truth that's why they're okay with just
[53:09] having churches and parties and
[53:11] everything that goes on in a church
[53:13] entertainment because they're denying
[53:15] the truth that God wants to see
[53:17] character in his bride amen truth now
[53:20] he's looking for the day that the bride
[53:22] to be
[53:24] formed Hebrews 13
[53:27] he's looking for his bride to manifest
[53:30] that God is the same yesterday today and
[53:32] forever amen just exactly as it was like
[53:35] he is he's got to be the same flesh same
[53:37] bone Same Spirit everything the same
[53:39] just built up and them two become one
[53:42] until the church becomes that they're
[53:44] not one think about that I'm in the
[53:47] message I could be in the message I
[53:50] could be at church and I'm not one with
[53:52] Christ not until I have the character of
[53:55] Christ amen
[53:57] the character of him the word for this
[53:59] age must be molded she must be molded
[54:05] like he is remember Jesus learned
[54:08] obedience by the things he suffered amen
[54:11] so we got two scriptures I just want to
[54:13] read them real quick for whom he did for
[54:15] know he also did predestinate to be
[54:17] conformed to the image of his son that
[54:19] we might be the firstborn among many
[54:21] Brethren so I'm glad I'm predestinated
[54:23] but I understand that my predestination
[54:25] is to come into His Image that's right
[54:28] and that doesn't happen on Rapture
[54:32] morning that happens through trials from
[54:35] here until the Rapture so if I'm not
[54:38] thinking about being in His image when
[54:40] I'm going into a trial I'm way off
[54:43] track I'm trying to bring this here how
[54:45] important it is to embrace trials to not
[54:48] be afraid amen 1 John 3:2 beloved now
[54:52] are we the sons of God and it does not
[54:54] yet appear what we shall be but we know
[54:56] that when he shall appear we shall be
[54:58] like him for we shall see him as he is
[55:00] and every man that has this hope in him
[55:02] purifies himself even as he is pure so
[55:05] how do we do that how do we purify
[55:08] oursel we come into our trial we come
[55:10] into our trial we stand right there we
[55:12] trust God that he's with us I shall not
[55:14] be
[55:16] moved God is going to make a way amen
[55:21] where before it's like I don't want to
[55:22] deal with this you know that that's
[55:24] that's you know that's for that's for
[55:25] the pastor to deal deal
[55:27] with that's for the church I'm out of
[55:29] there I'm not dealing with that
[55:33] stuff okay so God wants you in the body
[55:37] but not to deal to help the body is that
[55:39] I understanding what you're saying
[55:41] because I I'm I'm still got to find that
[55:44] scripture but you see why it's important
[55:47] is our heart isn't really wanting to
[55:51] please God enough and we're wanting to
[55:54] use people in the church church and the
[55:57] word and God for what we can get out of
[55:59] it for our fleshly lives God is trying
[56:03] to build character in
[56:04] us and if we don't love him enough to
[56:08] say God not my will but thy will be done
[56:10] we're going to miss it yes sir brother
[56:12] Bram said character is never built
[56:14] outside of
[56:17] Trials it's just not it's the only way
[56:20] in the lean Church age brother B said
[56:22] the gold of God is a Christlike
[56:25] character produced in the fiery furnace
[56:27] of
[56:30] Affliction and Paul told Timothy be thou
[56:33] a partaker of the afflictions of Christ
[56:36] be a partaker don't run away from
[56:38] remember he was scared in the message
[56:40] that Paul was telling Timothy God has
[56:42] not given us the spirit of fear but of
[56:44] power and love and of a sound mind do
[56:46] not be afraid of
[56:48] Trials God directed the children of
[56:50] Israel to their trial God has
[56:53] orchestrated your life to be in the
[56:56] trials that you're
[56:58] in pass
[57:00] them meet meet God in your trial and say
[57:03] God is here God is here I've got faith I
[57:06] will not murmur I will not complain it
[57:09] is God that worketh in me to to both do
[57:12] of his good pleasure and his
[57:14] will that's right he'll he'll finish the
[57:17] work he started
[57:19] Amen Brother Band also said that
[57:22] character is the only thing that we're
[57:23] taking with us
[57:28] he said in the message and then Jesus
[57:29] came he says but man is not judged by
[57:32] how how many muscles he's
[57:34] got man is judged by his
[57:37] character he said I've seen man weigh
[57:40] 200 pounds and didn't have an ounce of
[57:42] man in
[57:44] them man is measured by
[57:49] character now what kind of character
[57:52] will you take with
[57:54] you will it be like his whose character
[57:59] was molded by the suffering in the fiery
[58:04] furnace of
[58:06] Affliction so are you going to get
[58:08] character that way or will it be the
[58:11] softness of the character list leoan
[58:16] people it's up to each one of us right
[58:20] for in that day every man shall bear his
[58:21] own burden so here's what's so beautiful
[58:24] about this you could be in a house
[58:27] house where you may be the only
[58:30] one that wants God's character so bad
[58:34] that you're willing to pay the
[58:37] price you might be the only one in the
[58:40] church that wants God's character so bad
[58:44] that you're willing to pay the price
[58:46] because it's every man's Choice what
[58:48] kind of character he wants to have amen
[58:51] unfortunately we're living in a world
[58:52] where every man's right in his own eyes
[58:54] right every man thinks they got the
[58:56] character of Christ but it takes a heart
[58:59] to to go in a trial and not murmur not
[59:01] complain not get upset not just want to
[59:03] beat your head against the wall and all
[59:05] this stuff go in your trial and say I
[59:08] know God is with me if we don't get
[59:11] anything out out of this message get
[59:12] that God is with you in your
[59:14] trials and the message seeking after
[59:17] Jesus brother says and the Holy Spirit
[59:20] molds that conduct when he comes into
[59:24] you when you're really born Bor again of
[59:26] the spirit of God so here you are in the
[59:29] in the trial and obviously we're dealing
[59:30] with people we're dealing with attitudes
[59:32] we're dealing with certain situations
[59:34] that have come upon us I understand that
[59:36] but where God is really at is right here
[59:40] he's just using this to deal with
[59:44] this he's wanting to see something
[59:48] changed now if you pass the test you
[59:52] don't even feel like it's a trial it's
[59:54] true
[59:57] if you already got that character when
[59:59] you go into that trial you are already
[1:00:02] not being bombarded with
[1:00:06] fear because you've already been there
[1:00:08] you've done that you know what's
[1:00:10] happening now you can stand there with
[1:00:12] boldness I know God's with me just like
[1:00:15] David David I look I I overcame this
[1:00:19] bear I overcame this lion this
[1:00:21] uncircumcised Philistine he's not going
[1:00:23] to stand before me that is right he had
[1:00:26] faith and confidence that God was with
[1:00:28] him in the trial the three Hebrew
[1:00:30] children where did God meet the three
[1:00:32] Hebrew children right in the fiery
[1:00:34] furnace amen same place God's going to
[1:00:37] meet
[1:00:39] you thing is the devil want to get you
[1:00:41] so bothered upset everything going on
[1:00:43] that you're not even thinking about
[1:00:45] God's with
[1:00:47] you stand still see the salvation of God
[1:00:51] and move forward with confidence that
[1:00:53] God is with you
[1:01:02] Ser time time is up time is
[1:01:05] up
[1:01:07] and this is I got half the notes I
[1:01:10] normally have and I only got through
[1:01:12] half the
[1:01:15] notes let's stand
[1:01:19] together if God meets Us in the middle
[1:01:21] of the trial let's meet God in the
[1:01:23] middle of the trial amen let's have
[1:01:27] confidence that God is with us
[1:01:31] am think about every time a murmur or
[1:01:34] complaint comes out I want you to be
[1:01:37] plagued with the thought of the children
[1:01:39] of
[1:01:41] Israel to remember them and what
[1:01:44] happened because you can only do that so
[1:01:46] long right God allowed that for a while
[1:01:49] God allowed it for a
[1:01:51] while in the wilderness but
[1:01:54] eventually he said no
[1:01:56] you're you're not bride material you're
[1:01:58] not going into the will you're not going
[1:02:00] into the promised
[1:02:02] land and what we are we are bride amen
[1:02:07] so we we have no option to complain and
[1:02:10] murmur we have no option to think that
[1:02:13] we're going to gain character by just
[1:02:15] reading the Bible or listening to
[1:02:19] tapes in fact the more we listen to that
[1:02:22] and the more we hear without applying it
[1:02:24] to our life the more ammunition the
[1:02:26] devil has against us we've got to have
[1:02:29] it the right mental attitude of I'm
[1:02:32] going to I'm going to trust God I'm
[1:02:35] going I got a sound mind I've got power
[1:02:37] i' I've I've got love God gave it to me
[1:02:40] it is mine it is mine peace is mine I
[1:02:44] I'm I'm I'm gonna trust God Amen imagine
[1:02:49] Saints for the next seven
[1:02:52] days just take seven days we can go
[1:02:56] through the next seven days and trust
[1:02:59] God with our
[1:03:02] trials for you know honestly forget
[1:03:04] about trying to do it the rest of our
[1:03:06] life and if a week's too long just do
[1:03:10] one day one day with every thought and
[1:03:14] every situation say I'm going to trust
[1:03:16] God in this amen how many times have we
[1:03:19] thought something was so bad this was
[1:03:20] bad we found out wasn't even
[1:03:22] true it's true so I I think God is
[1:03:26] wanting us to put into practice that
[1:03:28] he's with
[1:03:29] us amen and when we know he's with us
[1:03:32] it's so easy to make the right decision
[1:03:34] in the trial and when you make the right
[1:03:37] decision in the trial character is
[1:03:39] formed character is molded in your life
[1:03:43] for instance I get slapped on the face
[1:03:45] I'm in the middle of the trial why did
[1:03:47] you do that and I turn the cheek it is
[1:03:50] that decision right there that character
[1:03:52] is built in me that's how powerful
[1:03:54] that's how character is build it's when
[1:03:56] you make the right decision but it takes
[1:03:59] you your will out and you uning to God's
[1:04:02] will to turn the cheek to go the second
[1:04:06] mile to to stay there praying longer
[1:04:09] when you don't want
[1:04:13] to now it's a reality Saints let's bow
[1:04:16] our hearts in in a word of
[1:04:22] prayer our heavenly father
[1:04:27] thank
[1:04:31] you thank you
[1:04:33] for for always being with us we don't
[1:04:37] always recognize that you're with
[1:04:41] us but you would never leave us Lord
[1:04:44] you'd never forsake us you'd never leave
[1:04:46] us by
[1:04:51] ourselves but Lord I I pray that this
[1:04:55] message
[1:04:56] here would help us to trust you when
[1:04:59] we're in the trial not to succumb to
[1:05:03] fear not to not to succumb to murmuring
[1:05:07] or
[1:05:09] complaining to to
[1:05:12] worrying to
[1:05:14] being uh overtaken by the thoughts of
[1:05:17] the
[1:05:18] enemy but I pray that you would bring to
[1:05:22] all of our
[1:05:24] remembrance that you want to stand still
[1:05:26] and trust you that you'll give us wisdom
[1:05:30] to move
[1:05:32] forward and that we could see uh the
[1:05:36] Salvation that we need to see for that
[1:05:40] situation that we could see character
[1:05:42] being molded inside of us that we could
[1:05:46] literally look back and say I used to be
[1:05:49] afraid of this and that but I'm not
[1:05:51] afraid
[1:05:53] anymore I used to run but but
[1:05:56] now I I I I I'm willing to embrace every
[1:06:01] direction the Lord puts me
[1:06:04] in
[1:06:05] Lord may this word become re material
[1:06:09] materialized in each one of our
[1:06:12] Lives May we all have a testimony down
[1:06:15] the road that we we took your word Lord

[1:06:23] that you desire to see character inside
[1:06:25] of us which is Hebrews 138 that you're

[1:06:31] body of
[1:06:33] Jesus Grant it father bless each brother
