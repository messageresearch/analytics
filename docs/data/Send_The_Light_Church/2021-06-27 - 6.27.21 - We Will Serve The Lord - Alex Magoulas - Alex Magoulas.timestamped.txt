[18:29] just remember our brother in prayer this

[18:38] gave to us
[18:40] amen hallelujah well we just have a
[18:43] few prayer requests let's just uh
[18:45] remember our brother
[18:47] bruce and sister don as they're
[18:48] traveling uh they're asking for
[18:50] traveling mercies over the fourth of
[18:52] july weekend
[18:53] i'm sure there'll be a lot of people
[18:54] going different places and doing
[18:56] different things so we just
[18:57] pray god's heads of protection around
[18:59] them and for all the gatherings that
[19:03] we just remember you know we're talking
[19:06] about freedom here
[19:07] god set us free hallelujah let's spread
[19:11] that freedom to other people
[19:13] amen also for all
[19:17] all the ones that lost their lives and
[19:20] the loved ones
[19:21] that are remaining in florida for the
[19:23] building that collapsed
[19:28] you know when when i look at that and i
[19:31] mean what horrific to be there one
[19:32] second
[19:33] we don't have a promise of tomorrow
[19:36] but you know there was a sign
[19:39] that they had a couple years before that
[19:42] that
[19:44] they had building inspired to come in
[19:46] and look at it right
[19:47] we have a sign
[19:51] and we may take need of the
[19:54] heat of that sign and
[19:57] the reason the building collapsed or i'm
[20:01] assuming that we
[20:02] reason the building collapses because it
[20:04] wasn't built that good foundation
[20:07] but if you're not built a good
[20:09] foundation
[20:10] the foundation of christ will collapse
[20:16] so let's just pray for all them people
[20:18] and pray for all the people that aren't
[20:20] anchored in christ
[20:22] because they will collapse
[20:25] and we know where their destination lies
[20:27] if they don't accept christ
[20:30] for all our neighbors throughout the
[20:33] world throughout our our runs that we

[20:56] health would
[20:57] stay good and come with an expectation
[21:01] amen

[21:04] expectation i think

[21:10] see the seed of god
[21:12] just uh manifested in this hour
[21:15] and increase our our belief amen

[33:45] not only of your grace but of your mercy
[33:48] as her brother was just saying
[33:49] father i how how i so thankful that that
[33:52] old hymn i just love it's one of my
[33:54] favorite songs
[33:55] great is thy faithfulness morning by
[33:57] morning new mercies i see
[33:59] lord i remember when i read the words of
[34:01] the weeping prophet jeremiah in the book
[34:03] of lamentations
[34:04] how it pricked my heart to think that
[34:06] lord even in our most humble our most
[34:08] distressed estate lord
[34:10] your mercies for us they're new every
[34:12] morning lord i can testify like david i
[34:14] would have fainted
[34:15] if i had not believed to see the
[34:17] goodness of the lord
[34:18] in the land of the living father today
[34:21] we're here because you've ordained us to
[34:23] be here
[34:23] lord i believe it's for a purpose lord
[34:26] you do nothing in vain you never send
[34:28] your worth
[34:28] for your word forth in vain but it
[34:31] accomplishes that which pleases you
[34:33] and father i just pray you'd come bless
[34:35] now the ministering of the word
[34:37] and the inspiration thereof may be a
[34:39] help and a challenge and a
[34:41] directive to our lives in the hearts of
[34:43] these your children
[34:44] father get yourself great glory and
[34:46] honor in this place and we thank you for
[34:48] all things and i pray today when i go
[34:49] out
[34:50] when we go out from this place when we
[34:52] depart from this
[34:53] place we would never depart from your
[34:54] presence may the angel lord go before us
[34:57] and for not only me but for each one
[34:59] but you give them traveling mercies home
[35:00] today and wherever they'd be going
[35:02] within the next week father we commit
[35:04] all these things now into your hands
[35:06] as a loving and a faithful creator in
[35:08] the name of our lord jesus christ
[35:10] we pray and the church says amen
[35:13] if you turn to me this morning to the
[35:15] book of joshua the 24th chapter
[35:17] uh i had had plans to go a different
[35:20] direction and
[35:21] i you know i just this is kind of where
[35:23] i wound up um
[35:24] so just trusting the lord will work
[35:27] things out
[35:28] and he always does work things out for
[35:29] good and now i have a confession i must
[35:32] make all so i'm pretty sure
[35:33] i just wear this jacket for pretense at
[35:35] this point uh
[35:36] it serves no functional purpose in the
[35:38] middle of the summer
[35:40] i don't even i i just took it right it's
[35:41] like what's the point of wearing that so
[35:43] forgive me i'm not trying to be
[35:45] traditional or superstitious but we just
[35:48] want to
[35:48] put our best foot forward because this
[35:50] is the house of god
[35:52] we want god to see our earnestness and
[35:54] our sincerity
[35:56] josh for the 24th chapter and we're just
[35:58] going to start in verse
[35:59] 13. read all the way down
[36:02] to verse 28 joshua chapter 24 did i say
[36:05] 24 are we flipping their pages i don't
[36:06] know what i said there
[36:08] joshua 24 13 the bible says this and
[36:11] joshua's giving i
[36:12] for the second time won't read the whole
[36:13] chapter but he's given this exhortation
[36:15] about
[36:15] what god had done and how he brought
[36:17] abraham and isaac and jacob and how he
[36:19] had destroyed the egyptians and he
[36:21] destroyed the different inhabitants
[36:22] that had risen up against him in this
[36:24] land and verse 13 he says here
[36:26] and i says here and i have given you a
[36:29] land
[36:29] for which he did not labor amen in
[36:33] cities which he built not
[36:34] and ye dwell in them and of vineyards
[36:36] and olive yards which he planted
[36:39] not do ye eat he says now therefore
[36:43] fear the lord and serve him in sincerity
[36:46] and in truth and put away the gods that
[36:48] your father served
[36:50] on the other side of the flood and in
[36:51] egypt and serve
[36:53] ye the lord and if it seems evil unto
[36:56] you
[36:57] to serve the lord choose you this day
[37:00] whom you will serve now there's three
[37:02] classes here watch this whether the gods
[37:04] your father served
[37:06] which were on the other side of the
[37:07] flood talking about jordan or the gods
[37:09] of the amorites in whose land you dwell
[37:11] but as for me in my house we will serve
[37:15] the lord
[37:16] and the people answer now this is where
[37:18] i really want to go with this actually
[37:19] and the people answered and said like a
[37:21] good ecclesiastical group they all join
[37:23] in and well god forbid that we should
[37:25] forsake the lord and serve other gods
[37:28] for the lord our god he it is that
[37:30] brought us up and our fathers out of the
[37:32] land of egypt from the house of bondage
[37:34] and wish did those great signs in our
[37:36] sight and preserved us
[37:37] in all the way where we went and among
[37:40] all the people through whom we passed
[37:41] and the lord drave out from before us
[37:44] all the people
[37:45] even the amorites which dwelt in the
[37:46] land therefore we will also serve the
[37:49] lord for he is our god that's a pretty
[37:51] good evangelistical service amen
[37:53] but you'll notice the words of joshua in
[37:55] the next verse amen
[37:56] this isn't joshua said unto the people
[37:59] ye cannot serve the lord
[38:00] for he is a holy god he is a jealous god
[38:04] he will not forgive your transgressions
[38:06] nor your sins if ye forsake the lord
[38:09] and serve strange gods then he will turn
[38:12] into you
[38:13] hurt and consume you after that he hath
[38:15] done
[38:16] you good and the people said unto joshua
[38:18] nay but we will
[38:19] serve the lord and joshua said unto
[38:22] people
[38:22] you are witnesses against yourselves
[38:24] that you have chosen you the lord
[38:26] to serve them and they said we are
[38:29] witnesses now therefore put away said he
[38:33] the strange
[38:34] gods which are among you and incline
[38:35] your heart
[38:37] unto the lord god of israel and the
[38:40] people said unto joshua the lord our god
[38:42] will we serve in his voice will we obey
[38:44] so joshua made a covenant with the
[38:46] people that day and set them a statute
[38:49] and an ordinance in sacham and joshua
[38:52] wrote these words
[38:53] in the book of the law of god and took a
[38:55] great stone and set it up there under an
[38:57] oak
[38:57] that was by the sanctuary of the lord
[39:00] and joshua said unto all the people
[39:02] behold this stone shall be a witness
[39:04] unto you for it hath heard all the words
[39:07] of think about it the stone even heard
[39:08] it
[39:09] for it hath heard all the words of the
[39:11] lord which the lord which he spake unto
[39:13] us
[39:13] it shall be therefore a witness unto you
[39:15] lest ye deny your god so joshua let the
[39:17] people depart
[39:18] every man unto his inheritance and may
[39:20] the lord bless the reading of his word
[39:22] as you're seated
[39:23] today and i'd like to take as a thought
[39:26] this text
[39:27] we will serve the lord amen and as i was
[39:29] mentioning a few moments ago joshua
[39:31] in this great exhortation at the end of
[39:33] the book of joshua he
[39:35] reminds the people and i want to remind
[39:37] you today that the goodness of god
[39:39] we know the goodness of god what it is
[39:41] because it's contrasted by
[39:43] his severity amen god was good to the
[39:46] people of israel in so much that he was
[39:48] terrible or dreadful to the enemies of
[39:51] the people of israel amen
[39:53] he had taken abraham out of a land and
[39:55] the seed after them he
[39:56] and you think about egypt the splendor
[39:58] of the nation of egypt and the greatness
[40:00] of pharaoh was all
[40:01] and all these great things and and god
[40:03] laid waste to everything that
[40:04] the greatest nation in the earth at that
[40:06] time and it'd actually be made wealthy
[40:08] by the people
[40:09] that were the very ones they put in
[40:10] bondage amen so a great nation a great
[40:13] army that pursued these people even
[40:15] until the
[40:16] after they left uh egypt and gaudy he
[40:19] lays the waste an entire army
[40:21] by the red sea amen they walk through
[40:24] the land of canaan and everybody that
[40:25] tried to impede or to harm them on the
[40:27] way there
[40:27] god dealt harsh with him so god was good
[40:30] to the people of israel in so much that
[40:32] he was harsh
[40:34] to the enemies of the people of god amen
[40:36] and joshua
[40:37] reminds him that even when the prophet
[40:39] balaam was minded to
[40:41] curse the people of israel god forbade
[40:43] the
[40:44] the madness of that prophet and caused
[40:46] him to bless israel
[40:48] amen so and i say this for a reason
[40:50] perhaps
[40:51] you're one of the few people in life
[40:53] that has enjoyed a lack of opposition
[40:55] in your life maybe you have no enemies
[40:57] maybe you've never encountered
[40:58] opposition
[40:59] if so you're probably not breathing
[41:00] you're like two years old
[41:02] but for the rest of us that are living
[41:03] breathing human beings that have ever
[41:05] done anything in your life at all
[41:07] somewhere in your life you've
[41:08] encountered opposition amen
[41:10] you know i i you talk to some people
[41:13] sometimes and they say well there's a
[41:14] guy
[41:15] he just doesn't have any enemies and i'm
[41:16] thinking well he's probably never stood
[41:18] for nothing
[41:19] amen well there's a guy just said have
[41:21] any image well listen
[41:22] how can you love your enemies if you
[41:24] ain't got any enemies in the first place
[41:27] you were not promised the lack of
[41:28] opposition you were not promised that
[41:30] everybody would like you
[41:32] or you would be well received by
[41:33] everybody invite you a promise that the
[41:35] world would hate you
[41:37] because they hated jesus listen joshua
[41:40] had enemies
[41:42] israel had enemies brother branham had
[41:44] enemies
[41:45] jesus had enemies listen if you stand
[41:49] for the right thing there's going to be
[41:51] an
[41:51] opposition every time you do that if
[41:54] you've come to church today expecting to
[41:55] believe this gospel
[41:57] to believe this message and not think
[41:59] that anybody's going to oppose you for
[42:00] it you're living in a daydream
[42:04] because somewhere in your life the
[42:05] enemy's gonna rise up and listen and
[42:07] sometimes they'll rise up maybe in your
[42:09] neighbors or family member or whatever
[42:11] and i want you to always remember that
[42:12] person is not the enemy but that spirit
[42:15] that's driving it is out he looks he's
[42:17] not out to make you feel bad
[42:19] some of us feel that and just thought
[42:20] well i'm not going to serve god anymore
[42:22] listen he's out to destroy you he's not
[42:25] to obliterate you and wipe your name
[42:27] and your testimony off the face of the
[42:29] earth but
[42:30] praise god the same god that led moses
[42:34] that led joshua through the wilderness
[42:37] out of
[42:37] egypt into a promised land he's the same
[42:40] god today
[42:41] through the message of the hour under
[42:44] the voice of the final messenger
[42:46] we are the final voice to the final age
[42:49] this voice has not spoken defeat over
[42:52] our lives
[42:54] quit speaking the devil's language we
[42:56] are not a defeated people
[42:58] we are not going down we're going up
[43:01] the call was to rise above the hour that
[43:04] we're living in
[43:06] well hallelujah praise the lord listen i
[43:08] want to encourage you whatever you're
[43:09] dealing with today
[43:10] whatever that enemy has told you and
[43:12] maybe he's told you're never going to
[43:13] make it
[43:14] maybe he's told you'll never be able to
[43:16] overcome maybe he's told you
[43:17] you'll never be able to live a normal
[43:19] life but i want to remind you what god
[43:20] did to his enemies back there
[43:23] and this mountain whatever's before you
[43:25] today this mountain is no different
[43:27] this uncircumcised philistine that's
[43:30] risen up against you
[43:32] he's no different than goliath
[43:34] [Applause]
[43:35] well praise the lord amen listen god has
[43:38] enemies sure does well he's the enemy of
[43:41] the pride he resists the proud well
[43:42] praise the lord i want to sit in church
[43:43] that way
[43:44] with a hearty heart a proud actor well i
[43:46] i know more about than the other guy and
[43:48] i'm the i'm the smarter this and i'm
[43:49] more spiritual than that
[43:51] and these people all a bunch of
[43:52] backslidden heathen devil pagans i tell
[43:54] you what watch out you'll make an enemy
[43:56] out of god
[43:57] i don't care if you're the most
[43:58] religious pious whatever
[44:00] you you get a haughty heart that god
[44:02] resists the proud
[44:04] but he gives grace unto the humble amen
[44:07] well that's in there for free i didn't
[44:08] put up my notes hey man
[44:11] listen joshua lays all this out like i'm
[44:13] laying it out to you says in light of
[44:14] what god has done for us
[44:16] i want you to realize what god has done
[44:17] for us to sit here in 2021 today
[44:19] we're looking at last year like oh man
[44:21] that was pretty bad listen god has
[44:23] brought his church through bubonic
[44:24] plagues
[44:25] and persecutions and and people getting
[44:27] fed to lions
[44:28] listen men want to put this bible in the
[44:30] language that you can read it
[44:32] so some pope somewhere couldn't dictate
[44:34] to you
[44:35] what it said men were burned at the
[44:37] stake and then present and tortured
[44:40] for you and i to be able to stand here
[44:42] today and believe this word of god
[44:46] god has made a way for us i can say like
[44:49] joshua said listen
[44:50] we've inherited things we didn't work
[44:52] for
[44:53] even heard the blessings we didn't labor
[44:55] for these things our
[44:57] eyes see things that kings and prophets
[44:59] desire to see
[45:00] jesus told his own disciples you've
[45:02] entered into other men's labors
[45:05] we are not here today our on our own
[45:08] we got prayer mohammed's and praying
[45:10] pastors and
[45:11] godly men godly women that have laid the
[45:13] foundation
[45:14] put footprints in the sands of time not
[45:17] just 20 years ago
[45:18] not just 50 years ago hundreds 200
[45:21] thousands of years
[45:22] and above all that we've had a god the
[45:25] angel of the lord has made a way for us
[45:27] to be here today don't ever take that
[45:31] for granted
[45:33] amen amen because these people took it
[45:36] for granted
[45:37] justice i want you to choose you want to
[45:38] serve all them egyptian gods
[45:40] that our fathers dealt with for 400
[45:42] years they left you in bondage they
[45:44] never did nothing for you
[45:45] anyway you've seen how their gods fell
[45:48] before our god
[45:49] why would you want to go back and serve
[45:51] them but choose you this day you can
[45:53] serve them or we've got some new guys
[45:54] we've got some new thing i'll get to
[45:56] this a little bit but
[45:56] we've got some things that are here they
[45:58] weren't over in egypt there's some
[45:59] certain gods
[46:00] in this land you could serve them too
[46:02] but i'll tell you what i'm going to do
[46:04] joshua says for me and my house we will
[46:07] serve the lord
[46:10] now listen you've probably heard this
[46:11] preached a lot of times and you've
[46:13] probably heard a lot of evangelists
[46:14] they'll come in
[46:15] and they'll say worry we'll serve the
[46:16] lord and the people get up on their feet
[46:18] we're going to serve god too
[46:19] praise god they're running the building
[46:21] we will serve the lord
[46:23] we're going to have a jericho march and
[46:25] we're going to shout
[46:26] well i'll tell you what joshua didn't
[46:27] know how to build his ministry i guess
[46:29] very well
[46:30] hey man he probably got advised how you
[46:31] should be preaching this stuff because
[46:33] he gets up there now i'm not here to
[46:34] discourage you today
[46:35] amen but he didn't get up there and do
[46:38] this like most people would oh i'm going
[46:39] to serve the lord
[46:40] us too he's like no you're not
[46:44] nope i don't think so
[46:47] no we will we see what god did we see
[46:49] these things we're testifying
[46:51] to god we will serve the lord
[46:55] that if you say so i mean
[46:59] i want you to consider what i'm saying
[47:01] for a moment because listen i i'm the
[47:02] the traveling evangelist and we expect
[47:04] me to come in here and preach like a
[47:05] house on fire and the people are getting
[47:07] excited and we're gonna feel good we're
[47:09] going to march on church today we will
[47:10] serve the lord
[47:11] we'll get a big old spirit on our back
[47:13] we'll blow the trumpet we'll go into
[47:14] walmart
[47:15] i'm going to serve the lord today i went
[47:17] to church this week
[47:19] praise god i'm a message believer well
[47:22] listen you're not the first one to walk
[47:23] at a church saying that
[47:25] they ain't serving the lord no more
[47:28] don't be that one amen you'd be the one
[47:30] that stays with it like joshua
[47:33] because we found out there was many
[47:34] people that day that testified we're
[47:36] just saying what the tapes say we're
[47:38] just saying what joshua said
[47:39] that's what joshua said we're saying
[47:41] that they were saying the same thing
[47:43] but it wasn't in their heart
[47:50] joshua's getting all he's preaching to
[47:52] the people he's preaching this text
[47:53] and they're getting excited we're going
[47:54] to serve god too and it just shuts them
[47:56] down no you won't
[47:59] amen well tell me something get me
[48:02] excited listen i'm not worried how
[48:03] excited you get today
[48:05] i'm worried about what kind of a life
[48:06] you live when you walk out of the
[48:07] building amen
[48:09] amen listen a lot of people can go
[48:10] around and that's like i had a brother
[48:12] one time trying to
[48:13] oh you should build your ministry and do
[48:14] this and that you got to get this
[48:15] following this that this isn't a good
[48:17] way to build a ministry i'm thinking
[48:18] well if the word of god can't build my
[48:20] ministry then i guess i don't need it
[48:23] it's like that man coming to brother
[48:24] bram said well your preacher is going to
[48:25] ruin your ministry he said
[48:26] if the word of god would ruin my
[48:28] ministry then i guess any
[48:30] any ministry that the word of god will
[48:32] ruin and he's run
[48:35] and that's just how i feel about amen i
[48:37] have to be able to preach this bible the
[48:39] way it was written
[48:40] by the same spirit that will break there
[48:42] goes my eyes
[48:43] well get rid of the frozen chosen here
[48:45] today amen that's how be able to preach
[48:47] this the way i prophet preach it and not
[48:49] have to feel bad
[48:50] or feel like i gotta compromise if you
[48:52] feel that way about it in your own life
[48:53] with whatever you're dealing with throw
[48:55] that thing out because that thing won't
[48:57] keep you in the promised land
[49:02] wait i see god started this he can
[49:04] finish it how he runs
[49:06] hey man oh my listen paul said if i am
[49:09] the servant how can i be a servant of
[49:11] christ and please men
[49:13] we've got too many men pleasers in the
[49:15] church today that's why the church is in
[49:17] the condition that it is
[49:19] listen everybody's looking around while
[49:20] everybody said we're going to serve god
[49:22] joshua's sitting there oh i'm going to
[49:24] serve god
[49:24] that don't mean anything you saying it
[49:27] doesn't mean anything
[49:30] you can go out of here and you can run
[49:31] and you can jump and you can shout
[49:33] but can you live it
[49:39] yeah man listen i man everybody's off
[49:44] listen i like encouraging people i like
[49:45] it when people get happy i do i like
[49:47] when people just worship and praise the
[49:49] lord
[49:49] but that's not what i live for you say
[49:51] what do you mean listen uh
[49:52] that doesn't save anybody by itself amen
[49:55] what i live for
[49:56] what my passion is is to see the sons
[49:59] and daughters of god
[50:00] walking in the glorious liberty that god
[50:03] has purchased for them amen
[50:05] there's a lot of people it's all right
[50:07] there's a lot of people that go to
[50:08] church
[50:09] and they can worship and they can shout
[50:10] but you look at their lives they're just
[50:12] as powerless
[50:13] and defeated and incapable as the next
[50:16] person amen
[50:17] their lives are so devoid of christ they
[50:19] look just like the world
[50:26] amen it doesn't matter how great we
[50:30] think church oh man we had a great
[50:31] service today
[50:32] what did it do in your life and listen
[50:35] don't put that on the preacher that
[50:36] might be listen joshua wasn't the one
[50:38] that was wrong
[50:39] he had a different spirit than everybody
[50:40] else joshua was some backslid preacher
[50:43] somewhere
[50:43] well if joshua just equipped me and give
[50:45] me what i need man he doesn't give you
[50:47] everything
[50:49] god give you everything don't put on
[50:52] joshua now
[50:53] listen joshua might have been the only
[50:55] one there that said we will serve the
[50:57] lord that did it amen
[50:58] listen you've got to make up your mind
[51:00] somewhere you've got to establish in
[51:02] your heart
[51:03] somewhere if nobody else in this
[51:05] building
[51:06] mommy and daddy and wife and husband kid
[51:09] if nobody else wants to serve god
[51:11] i'm gonna serve god joshua wasn't saying
[51:15] to get everybody on board
[51:16] he was letting him know where he stands
[51:18] whether he give him the option
[51:20] listen you serve who you want i'm still
[51:22] going to serve god
[51:25] it's not a bunch of group psychology
[51:27] this is not a bunch of fanaticism and a
[51:29] bunch of work up
[51:30] i'm going to serve god my house is going
[51:33] to serve the lord
[51:34] whether anyone else does or not amen
[51:39] i'm saying this for a reason amen like i
[51:42] said us just saying it
[51:43] doesn't mean anything i can sit here and
[51:46] tell you you're the chosen bride of
[51:47] jesus christ we're all going to go to
[51:48] heaven this church we're all going to
[51:49] see jesus
[51:50] and we can all agree with it and that
[51:52] doesn't mean anything by itself
[51:55] i'm not doing anything different than
[51:56] any other sort of evangelical or
[51:58] pentecostal church doing that
[52:00] it doesn't praise the lord amen listen
[52:03] you look at some of the most
[52:04] influential some of the biggest
[52:05] ministries in this message
[52:07] and where are some of them today where
[52:09] did they go
[52:11] amen where did they go listen at some
[52:14] point they were all well we will serve
[52:16] the lord
[52:16] every one of them said that they all
[52:20] started out with the best of intentions
[52:22] listen i have no doubt these people here
[52:24] testifying had the best intentions to
[52:27] serve god
[52:28] they probably really thought they meant
[52:30] it
[52:33] but yet we find out one gen marvel when
[52:35] i first read this bible
[52:36] it just astonished me as a young man
[52:39] one generation later hey man not
[52:43] hundreds of years or two literally mommy
[52:45] and daddy
[52:46] that watched the sun stand still
[52:50] but watch the moon hang over a valley
[52:52] that watched hell flow from heaven
[52:55] watch jericho fall one generation later
[52:59] they were serving other gods
[53:04] and i just said nothing i didn't
[53:05] disbelieve the bible i'm just like man
[53:07] it's astounding to me it could change
[53:09] that much
[53:10] in 40 years but listen i got saved back
[53:13] in
[53:14] in 2006. hey man and this is 2021
[53:18] and you look at our just american
[53:20] society now look at how much our culture
[53:23] and our society and their attitude
[53:25] towards all this perversion
[53:27] and all this nonsense and all its
[53:28] politics i thought it was bad back then
[53:31] you looked at how much has changed in 15
[53:33] years don't tell me it's not the same
[53:35] thing
[53:36] listen the devil is so sure to pull the
[53:38] rug right out from you when you're
[53:39] standing on it if you let him amen
[53:41] we've got to know more than just an
[53:43] intellectual conception
[53:44] we've got to know in our hearts that god
[53:46] has done something for us he has put us
[53:48] in this promise
[53:50] whether it's popular or unpopular
[53:52] whether it's profitable or unprofitable
[53:55] hallelujah somebody
[53:57] listen well this isn't even my sermon
[53:58] anymore praise the lord listen where did
[54:00] we the church
[54:01] as the people get their place we can't
[54:03] make a sacrifice unto god anymore
[54:05] people don't want to come and serve god
[54:07] people don't want to come and go to
[54:08] church or do anything unless it benefits
[54:10] them somehow
[54:12] where's the man of god where's the woman
[54:15] of god says i'll lay down my life
[54:17] for the people of god i don't care what
[54:20] it costs me
[54:22] i'm not here to get something i'm here
[54:23] to give something lord i'm willing to
[54:25] lay down my life
[54:27] for the gospel of jesus christ you're in
[54:29] the purchase amen
[54:31] you're not just the blood you're the
[54:32] purchase of the blood
[54:34] god thought you were so important that
[54:37] he give the blood of his only begotten
[54:39] son at calvary for you
[54:41] and a man i've got to send the pulpit
[54:42] and he'll try to hypnotize
[54:44] he'll try to work people over with a
[54:45] bunch of psychology that's the blood of
[54:48] jesus christ
[54:50] god forbid that i should manhandle the
[54:53] purchase of this possession
[54:58] i tell you what it's like i said their
[55:00] brother the other day i said you know
[55:01] it'd be one thing i wouldn't rob the
[55:02] bank one thing one one thing if i called
[55:05] you up and i said hey you want a free
[55:06] cruise
[55:07] just give me your credit card number
[55:08] i've never understood that why do you
[55:10] need my credit card for three
[55:12] we got man you get them like six times a
[55:13] week anymore tell you what everybody's
[55:15] out for your money
[55:16] everybody's out for your information
[55:18] including churches lots of times
[55:20] and then everybody's having to get
[55:22] something from me amen i said it's bad
[55:24] enough
[55:24] everybody's trying to scam you nowadays
[55:26] but to do it in the name of the lord
[55:28] jesus christ
[55:30] where is the fear of god that's what
[55:32] paul says in remember
[55:33] they lost the fear of god hallelujah
[55:37] the fact that a man can stand up while
[55:38] i'm way off the beaten path now
[55:40] to think that a man of god could stand
[55:41] the pulpit having read this bible and do
[55:43] these things like don't you fear the god
[55:45] of this bible
[55:47] i didn't already love him so much i
[55:48] should be afraid of him they have to
[55:50] answer for that on the day of judgment
[55:53] well glory to god i don't know what
[55:56] that's all about but
[55:57] you keep that one amen listen i'm not
[56:00] here today to tell you
[56:02] like joshua you can't make it i'm not
[56:03] here to discourage you you can't serve
[56:04] god that's not what i'm saying
[56:06] but what i'm saying is if you tell me
[56:07] i'm going to serve the lord that doesn't
[56:09] mean anything by itself
[56:11] lots of people tell you they're serving
[56:13] god but they're serving their own belly
[56:15] amen so i don't want to just say it
[56:17] today i want to live it
[56:19] i want every moment of my life and every
[56:21] fiber of my being to testify
[56:23] of this resurrection in my life under
[56:26] dark denominationalism
[56:27] out of sin and trespasses out of my own
[56:30] hang-ups and my own inability
[56:31] god has quickened me from death and to
[56:34] life
[56:37] see it doesn't do anything if i just
[56:38] convince you listen if i can talk you
[56:41] into it
[56:41] somebody else can talk you out of there
[56:44] i mean now if somebody can talk to you
[56:46] if somebody talked you into this
[56:48] you're in a bad place because somebody
[56:50] can talk you out of it
[56:53] you have to have the revelation joshua's
[56:55] revelation was no good just in joshua
[56:58] you've got to have it in yourself
[57:01] and that's like brother i tell you it's
[57:03] like that pro the hotbed plan we talked
[57:04] about
[57:05] i mean we don't need some hot bed plants
[57:07] in the church today
[57:09] we got to sit here and water them and
[57:10] baby them and pet them
[57:12] and put them just a certain kind of
[57:13] light every day and we gotta just follow
[57:15] them i tell you what there's a few feet
[57:17] away brother bram said there's a plant
[57:18] right there
[57:19] it wasn't no hybrid it might not have
[57:21] looked as pretty as the one the flower
[57:23] box
[57:23] it didn't matter how hot it was or how
[57:25] dry it was
[57:26] or if nobody else wanted to go to church
[57:28] he was there
[57:29] and he was alive that hot dead plant
[57:32] might look good but he couldn't take
[57:34] five minutes of what that natural seed
[57:37] could take
[57:38] don't ever let the world sell you short
[57:40] you say well i'm not this and i'm not
[57:41] that i don't look like the world
[57:43] praise god amen listen our lord jesus
[57:47] didn't come that way
[57:48] with a bunch of glitz and glamour it was
[57:50] despised
[57:52] and rejected a man there was no beauty
[57:55] in him
[58:00] so if you don't look like the rest of
[58:01] the world we're hot pretty good
[58:03] no thank god you're built to handle the
[58:06] pressure
[58:09] i think about this how many times
[58:10] brother read him on tape he talks about
[58:12] the rapture
[58:13] he says it's not going to be a lot of
[58:14] people it'd be just a few people missing
[58:18] amen now listen people hear that they
[58:20] get discouraged
[58:21] well i might there might just if there's
[58:23] going to be just a few people that get
[58:24] discouraged
[58:24] and what's brother ram saying now that's
[58:26] not the right attitude it's just the
[58:27] parable
[58:28] he says it might be one saved in
[58:30] jeffersonville they see it's a parable
[58:32] he says there might be thousands of
[58:33] saved i don't know he says but here's
[58:35] the way i want to believe it
[58:37] i'm that one
[58:40] josh we didn't say hey or joshua hey man
[58:43] let me say it that way
[58:44] didn't say hey we're all gonna make it
[58:46] but he said if anybody's gonna make it
[58:47] i'm gonna make it no that's not for you
[58:51] to look at everybody else in the church
[58:52] say sorry you're not gonna make it
[58:53] right that's not what he's saying but if
[58:56] one if only one is gone i'm that one
[59:01] and brother said if your faith doesn't
[59:03] say that there's something wrong with
[59:04] your faith
[59:08] he says you're not sure what you're
[59:09] doing see them people they weren't sure
[59:10] what they were doing well yeah i mean
[59:11] we're gonna
[59:12] we're gonna serve god are you amen
[59:16] see joshua had a different spirit to
[59:17] them see joshua understood
[59:19] the power of a true token he sought that
[59:21] night in the passover amen
[59:23] when he put the blood over the door and
[59:25] the lint told his house amen he
[59:27] watched the death angel pass over his
[59:29] house amen
[59:30] listen when he come into the jet when he
[59:32] come into the they said when he sent
[59:34] spies rather
[59:35] into the promised land 40 years
[59:36] afterwards and then two spies come back
[59:39] and they said there's a woman in jericho
[59:40] she should give a safe haven
[59:42] and they marched around jericho for
[59:43] seven days and on the seventh day they
[59:45] marched around seven times and they
[59:47] shouted
[59:47] and when those walls come down joshua
[59:50] noticed there was a little bit sticking
[59:51] up
[59:53] and then someone look listen that's you
[59:56] you're excited about that joshua said i
[59:58] thought the whole thing was going to
[59:59] come down
[1:00:00] no that's right there was a promise made
[1:00:04] there was a promise made by spies that
[1:00:06] her house would stand
[1:00:07] and everybody knew there was a token
[1:00:09] amen a little piece of the wall with a
[1:00:11] little scarlet ribbon
[1:00:12] flooding in the wind it probably looked
[1:00:14] ridiculous when they were being besieged
[1:00:16] here's some ill-famed woman listen she
[1:00:19] wasn't some general
[1:00:20] she wasn't some priestess she wasn't you
[1:00:22] know what she was
[1:00:24] but she had a token on display
[1:00:27] that token on display spared her when
[1:00:29] every other what listen
[1:00:31] structurally that don't even make sense
[1:00:33] they were just praying earlier about
[1:00:34] that building that fell down in florida
[1:00:36] listen
[1:00:36] this giant stone wall thing of the
[1:00:40] ramparts
[1:00:41] fell down why is there a little piece
[1:00:43] stained up there's a little scarlet
[1:00:44] ribbon hanging outside
[1:00:45] [Music]
[1:00:47] listen there's no virtue in the ribbon
[1:00:49] they'd probably be used for all kinds of
[1:00:51] things but the promise behind
[1:00:53] it the word by them two boys
[1:00:56] was a true token unto her listen joshua
[1:00:59] understood the power of token listen
[1:01:01] let me tell you about the power of a
[1:01:03] token your faith says
[1:01:04] if there's one household that's gonna
[1:01:06] make it it's my
[1:01:08] i've got a token you say brother listen
[1:01:10] all kinds of people preach about a token
[1:01:12] but here's the difference between you
[1:01:14] and the rest of jericho
[1:01:15] you've got to have your token on display
[1:01:20] hey man unless a lot of people say we'll
[1:01:21] serve god she put her token out
[1:01:25] let's not just say we're going to serve
[1:01:27] god let's put it on display
[1:01:30] that's not what we say it's what we live
[1:01:36] so all the people who quote moses
[1:01:39] they could all quote joshua they'd all
[1:01:42] been listen they'd all been given
[1:01:44] promises by god
[1:01:46] for their own possession now i talked
[1:01:47] about adoption a little bit last time
[1:01:49] this ties in adoption too
[1:01:50] what is adoption it's the placing of a
[1:01:52] son over authority in his own household
[1:01:54] is that right
[1:01:56] hebrews chapter 3 tells us that moses
[1:01:57] was faithful in his house as a servant
[1:02:00] but christ as a son over his house
[1:02:03] amen see why the swat brother said you
[1:02:06] see why the totem couldn't be preached
[1:02:08] until the evening time
[1:02:09] there had to be some sons and daughters
[1:02:11] of god with the authority to put a token
[1:02:13] over the house
[1:02:14] i mean because they put on a token over
[1:02:16] your house you can't just be a servant
[1:02:18] you've got to be a son you've got to be
[1:02:21] a dog you've got to have authority today
[1:02:24] amen it's not the magoulas household or
[1:02:26] the martin household
[1:02:27] it's the house of god today listen i put
[1:02:31] my own family ideas and my own
[1:02:32] traditions
[1:02:33] over the word of god i'm gonna be just
[1:02:35] like the rest of that rubble
[1:02:37] but you take this gospel and you take
[1:02:39] this message
[1:02:40] and you devote your life to this and you
[1:02:43] seek god i don't care what kind of a
[1:02:44] house you come from
[1:02:45] i don't care what your tax bracket looks
[1:02:47] like you put god first and everything
[1:02:49] and god will take care of you amen
[1:02:56] listen joshua tells these guys they're
[1:02:57] not going to serve god and
[1:02:59] even tells them why think about that
[1:03:02] he's already letting the cat out of the
[1:03:03] back
[1:03:04] he's not like leaving it out there or
[1:03:05] something's gonna happen you know when
[1:03:07] and within 40 days something might
[1:03:09] happen possibly to you
[1:03:13] no he lets him know listen all these
[1:03:14] other gods are going to be a snare to
[1:03:16] you
[1:03:17] if you don't drive them all out listen
[1:03:19] they were they were commissioned each
[1:03:20] one of those tribes was commissioned
[1:03:22] like we are today to take full
[1:03:25] possession of their inheritance amen
[1:03:29] every promise in the book is mine amen
[1:03:32] not just the ones that you think are
[1:03:33] are conceivable or possible with god all
[1:03:36] things are possible listen i can't
[1:03:38] explain a body change to you
[1:03:40] i can explain how divine healing works
[1:03:42] but i know it works
[1:03:44] i've seen him in action god said it i
[1:03:47] believe it that settles it
[1:03:50] amen we're not here today to try to
[1:03:53] understand the science behind it
[1:03:54] we're here to take possession if god
[1:03:57] promised to be a token in the evening
[1:03:59] time
[1:03:59] there's got to be somebody who says that
[1:04:01] token's on display in my life
[1:04:04] if god said i'm going to have a perfect
[1:04:05] church without spot or blemish
[1:04:07] there's got to be somebody somewhere who
[1:04:10] says it don't matter what the rest of
[1:04:11] these
[1:04:12] people do it doesn't matter what they
[1:04:13] say i'm a member
[1:04:15] of the body of christ i'm going to
[1:04:18] fulfill
[1:04:19] my purpose listen god did just give him
[1:04:22] that land for no reason there was a
[1:04:24] purpose in it
[1:04:25] you're not here today just to feel good
[1:04:27] and go to church and be seen and hurt
[1:04:29] again
[1:04:30] you will have been called every day of
[1:04:32] your life from here on out
[1:04:33] to fulfill a purpose to take possession
[1:04:37] of everything god has put into your hand
[1:04:39] amen
[1:04:41] now here's what happens to them here's
[1:04:43] where they get distracted
[1:04:44] they all begin to compromise somewhere
[1:04:48] you read through the first and second
[1:04:50] chapter of the book of judges
[1:04:52] before this great uh i guess falling
[1:04:55] away is a good way to put it actually
[1:04:56] right before all they all start to go
[1:04:58] away where what happens they go into the
[1:05:00] land
[1:05:00] you know ephraim goes over here and dan
[1:05:02] goes over here and god goes over here
[1:05:04] and and and they all go to these
[1:05:06] different lands
[1:05:07] and they get there and they meet these
[1:05:08] inhabitants and they happen to say you
[1:05:10] know what tell you what
[1:05:11] we'll give you some money if you let us
[1:05:12] keep part of the possession right well
[1:05:14] we'll compromise we'll be your buddy if
[1:05:16] you let us be
[1:05:18] selling up for money and popularity and
[1:05:19] things every one of them compromises and
[1:05:22] they don't take full position of their
[1:05:23] inheritance
[1:05:25] and when they fail to take full
[1:05:27] possession what happens the gods of
[1:05:29] those inhabitants
[1:05:30] not the gods of egypt the gods of those
[1:05:33] inhabitants become a snare unto them the
[1:05:35] bible says
[1:05:37] see he told them he joshua had told them
[1:05:39] to moses told him
[1:05:40] go in and fully possess the land why
[1:05:43] when you go in there
[1:05:45] i want you to take their altars and take
[1:05:47] their idols and take their dots and
[1:05:49] utterly cast them down
[1:05:50] and destroy them i'm going somewhere now
[1:05:53] listen when you fail to take the full
[1:05:55] possession
[1:05:56] of what god has given us in this age
[1:05:58] you're letting devils come in
[1:06:00] you're letting idols come and you'll let
[1:06:01] something come in that will steal your
[1:06:03] testimony
[1:06:04] it'll steal your joy it'll steal your
[1:06:06] peace it'll steal everything from you
[1:06:08] the very inhabitants that they fail to
[1:06:10] destroy become a snare to their children
[1:06:14] right how many times i've seen it in the
[1:06:16] message and even outside not even just
[1:06:18] christian homes even just natural homes
[1:06:19] the sins of the father that get passed
[1:06:21] on to the children
[1:06:23] listen i don't know what your daddies
[1:06:24] and mommies are dealing with here today
[1:06:25] but listen to things you don't get under
[1:06:27] control
[1:06:28] you're just going to pass it on if
[1:06:29] you're not careful amen it's time to put
[1:06:30] the devil under hill today
[1:06:32] let's not compromise let's not wait for
[1:06:34] somebody else to get it done
[1:06:36] you've got a job to do you get your
[1:06:39] house in order
[1:06:40] you build a family altar you get before
[1:06:42] the lord and you mean business with god
[1:06:44] drive out every enemy we got too many
[1:06:47] idols in this message
[1:06:49] trying to look around and steal from the
[1:06:52] people what god has ordained for them
[1:06:55] now there's a story in the book of
[1:06:56] judges and uh
[1:06:58] this story's always been interesting
[1:07:00] it's in chapter 17 18. maybe you're
[1:07:02] familiar with it but there's a man
[1:07:03] there in the uh he was in mount ephraim
[1:07:06] there's a man there mount ephraim and he
[1:07:08] had a bunch of idols his mom he'd saved
[1:07:09] up some money for him
[1:07:10] bro bruce you know this story he's
[1:07:11] laughing already it's like i know where
[1:07:13] this is going
[1:07:14] he had a bunch of gold and silver mama
[1:07:16] had laid up said you know we've reserved
[1:07:17] this
[1:07:18] for jehovah so he goes and he makes a
[1:07:20] bunch of idols in his house he has a
[1:07:22] whole room in his house
[1:07:23] full of idols like some message
[1:07:24] believers he's got a whole room in his
[1:07:26] house full of different idols and
[1:07:28] all these other gods and he said i've
[1:07:29] got all these for jehovah
[1:07:32] apparently he wasn't familiar with what
[1:07:33] moses said that moses put a commandment
[1:07:35] somewhere in there by not having false
[1:07:37] idols and graven images and worshipping
[1:07:38] other gods but
[1:07:39] but whatever i'm not this he did it all
[1:07:41] for the lord isn't it amazing what
[1:07:42] people will do
[1:07:43] for the lord and i wouldn't rub this
[1:07:45] bank for the lord
[1:07:46] then i wouldn't marry another woman for
[1:07:48] the lord
[1:07:50] we've got some sort of special
[1:07:51] revelation but it don't mess joshua and
[1:07:54] don't match moses
[1:07:56] but you know what he did he said you
[1:07:57] know what there's a levite come down
[1:07:58] that way one day
[1:07:59] a levi a man that was called to do the
[1:08:01] work of a priest
[1:08:02] come by his house one day and he said
[1:08:05] hey i tell you what if i pay you
[1:08:07] i'll give you some money and some
[1:08:08] clothes i give you some food
[1:08:10] you come down be my priest in my house
[1:08:12] and that leave i said i'll do that for
[1:08:13] that much
[1:08:15] and the man at the end of judges 17 his
[1:08:18] response is made he says now
[1:08:20] he says now i know the lord will bless
[1:08:22] me seeing i have a levite to a priest
[1:08:25] think about this think about this i've
[1:08:27] got all kinds of idols i've got all
[1:08:29] kinds of
[1:08:29] ungodly nonsense in my house but it's
[1:08:31] for the lord and i found me a preacher
[1:08:33] to preach it the way i like
[1:08:35] if i pay him that way and i set him up
[1:08:37] i'll he'll preach whatever i want well
[1:08:39] listen
[1:08:40] there's only one problem with this
[1:08:41] preacher if you can pay to preach one
[1:08:43] way
[1:08:43] somebody else can pay him to preach
[1:08:44] another way
[1:08:46] here comes dan the next chapter they're
[1:08:48] not satisfied with what god gave them
[1:08:50] they're not satisfied with their
[1:08:52] inheritance so they march on down to my
[1:08:54] nephron
[1:08:54] and down there they come across this
[1:08:56] house and this buttered up leave like
[1:08:58] this this backslidden preacher
[1:09:00] they'd find him down there in the house
[1:09:01] and out in the mountains from and they
[1:09:03] said hey tell you what we really like
[1:09:04] these idols
[1:09:05] we want to take them he says well no no
[1:09:07] listen i'm getting paid really good to
[1:09:08] take care of this guy's idols and be his
[1:09:10] priest
[1:09:10] so tell you what we'll we'll up the
[1:09:12] offer we'll let you be a priest to our
[1:09:15] whole big mega church
[1:09:18] we've got a whole city we're going to
[1:09:19] set up we want these idols you come down
[1:09:21] you're going to be
[1:09:22] he's like man i'm going to be a big time
[1:09:24] big time preacher i'm going to preach
[1:09:26] the whole tribe a day
[1:09:27] amen that's what happens with a salad
[1:09:29] he'll find somebody offers a better
[1:09:30] price
[1:09:31] this guy had all them idols in his house
[1:09:33] and everything else had a priest lost it
[1:09:35] all
[1:09:36] yeah now i'm telling this story for a
[1:09:37] reason besides just the
[1:09:39] very clever analogies of course
[1:09:43] dan takes these idols and he goes down
[1:09:44] and then he sets up he actually named
[1:09:46] the city dan they set this up
[1:09:47] eve from and dan they've got these idols
[1:09:49] and if you're familiar with what brother
[1:09:50] ben preaches in the
[1:09:51] the seventh seals and the church he book
[1:09:53] these two names are eventually they're
[1:09:55] blotted out
[1:09:56] from under heaven because god made a
[1:09:57] promise
[1:09:59] that if you would serve these eyes he
[1:10:00] would blot your name out from under
[1:10:01] heaven amen
[1:10:02] when you go to the book of first kings
[1:10:04] the 12th chapter when the kingdom of
[1:10:06] israel splits off
[1:10:07] from the kingdom of judah in the time of
[1:10:09] the kings king jeroboam he sets up his
[1:10:11] own religion
[1:10:12] and he puts two idols up and i want you
[1:10:14] to see where he puts them up at he puts
[1:10:16] them in dan
[1:10:17] and he puts them in ephraim because
[1:10:19] those same spirits that had been there
[1:10:21] for hundreds of years
[1:10:22] were still in the family still operating
[1:10:25] the same day
[1:10:26] and once you notice what his purpose in
[1:10:28] doing this was jeroboam said i'm going
[1:10:30] to set these idols up here in israel
[1:10:32] with dan and ephraim because i don't
[1:10:34] want the people
[1:10:35] to go back to jerusalem because if they
[1:10:37] go back to jerusalem and worship they'll
[1:10:39] turn their hearts back towards jerusalem
[1:10:43] listen satan is trying to stop you today
[1:10:46] trying to stop people and message
[1:10:48] churches from turn their hearts back
[1:10:50] according to malachi 4.
[1:10:51] what's he done he set up idols
[1:10:54] idols in their lives to distract them
[1:10:57] the carriage of this world
[1:10:59] and the things of this world trying to
[1:11:00] keep us from serving god
[1:11:03] see he's afraid like jeroboam's afraid
[1:11:05] he's afraid if you ever turn back to the
[1:11:06] faith of your fathers
[1:11:08] he's afraid if you ever get a real
[1:11:09] revelation this message listen he knows
[1:11:12] he knows amen well praise the lord
[1:11:16] let me say this real quick let me just
[1:11:17] drop this in here i was telling this
[1:11:18] testimony the other day
[1:11:19] listen i we had these uh these these
[1:11:22] healing services
[1:11:22] over in defiance ohio a couple weeks
[1:11:24] back and i got done preaching
[1:11:26] on friday night and there was one sister
[1:11:27] already got touched in the service and
[1:11:29] we have a bunch more testimonies from
[1:11:30] that that
[1:11:30] i won't get into but i got in the car
[1:11:32] when i was done
[1:11:33] and i started driving home and i went
[1:11:35] five minutes down the road and the enemy
[1:11:36] come to me in the car and i thought well
[1:11:38] this ought to be good
[1:11:40] i just love these these wonderful
[1:11:42] conversations we always have
[1:11:44] and what's always funny is they don't
[1:11:45] end well for him so i don't know why he
[1:11:46] does this
[1:11:47] but he comes in the car like he's
[1:11:49] probably done to some of you and he
[1:11:50] comes in the car and says you know what
[1:11:52] you're just getting the people worked up
[1:11:54] you don't really believe in this and god
[1:11:55] doesn't do that anymore and you're just
[1:11:57] getting people excited he says you know
[1:11:58] what you're a hypocrite
[1:12:00] you don't believe any of that stuff and
[1:12:03] it just struck me i answered them back
[1:12:04] and said
[1:12:05] even if that weren't true i know one
[1:12:07] person that was there tonight
[1:12:08] that believes it you
[1:12:11] hallelujah amen is that right listen the
[1:12:15] devils believe
[1:12:16] and they tremble that's why where the
[1:12:19] rams had
[1:12:20] when the weakest christian the weakest
[1:12:23] christian goes on these
[1:12:25] the devils tremble why because even when
[1:12:28] you're not sure
[1:12:29] you and you're not sure if you believe
[1:12:31] it the devil believes it
[1:12:33] listen jeroboam was afraid he knew if
[1:12:36] the people ever believed it
[1:12:38] he wouldn't be able to stop him listen
[1:12:40] that's where you and i are today
[1:12:42] the devil believes this maybe more than
[1:12:44] some of you that's why he's so afraid
[1:12:46] that's why he fights church that's why
[1:12:48] he fights the message he believes it he
[1:12:51] knows
[1:12:51] if you ever get a true revelation of who
[1:12:54] the church is
[1:12:55] and what she stands for that she can do
[1:12:58] the greater works
[1:12:59] you will be an invincible army
[1:13:04] i don't care if you're 80 convinced or
[1:13:06] 50 convinced he is 100
[1:13:08] convinced that's why he fights you i
[1:13:11] want you to know
[1:13:12] when you don't believe in yourself and
[1:13:14] you don't think you can make it another
[1:13:15] day
[1:13:16] god believes in you and the devil
[1:13:17] believes in you
[1:13:19] everybody else believes in you but you
[1:13:22] it's the truth jeremiah believed
[1:13:26] in what they're that's why he fought it
[1:13:27] so much i don't want him to go back
[1:13:29] there
[1:13:29] and say we get a real touch from god
[1:13:31] they'll never come back to me
[1:13:35] so it is today amen i said well that's
[1:13:37] all idols and this that what's that
[1:13:38] gotta do with anything
[1:13:39] listen according to the book of
[1:13:40] revelation in the 13th chapter
[1:13:42] that first beast fell there'd be a
[1:13:44] second beast rise on the earth now i'm
[1:13:46] not preaching vaccines and stuff we're
[1:13:47] not all
[1:13:48] we know what the message says hopefully
[1:13:49] about how the mark of the beast amen
[1:13:52] they better throw that disclaimer in
[1:13:53] there but listen
[1:13:55] when that second beast rises what is it
[1:13:57] civil and ecclesiastical power
[1:13:59] out of this country i think that's a
[1:14:01] buffalo one place
[1:14:02] amen this country america the land of
[1:14:06] the free
[1:14:06] the home of the brave has raised up a
[1:14:09] system
[1:14:10] raised up an image under the first beast
[1:14:13] raised up out of our ship
[1:14:16] that catholic it's just the same spirit
[1:14:19] some i can't remember i was talking to
[1:14:20] you about this while back one of my kids
[1:14:21] was talking about
[1:14:22] a certain church and i think it was a
[1:14:23] charismatic church or something and they
[1:14:25] asked me what kind of church it was and
[1:14:26] i said catholic i meant to say
[1:14:28] charismatic i said well same thing
[1:14:30] anyway
[1:14:32] it's just different forms of the same
[1:14:33] it's all antichrist
[1:14:35] it's all antichrist she's got daughters
[1:14:38] she's got lots of children
[1:14:39] they're full of blasphemous names but
[1:14:41] it's all satan
[1:14:43] and this church this country rather with
[1:14:46] all that god has blessed it with
[1:14:47] and all that god is allowed to do yet
[1:14:50] it's raised it's raised up idols
[1:14:52] like we've never had before
[1:14:56] there's been idols in every age there's
[1:14:58] always been an idol worship
[1:14:59] there's always been deceivers but this
[1:15:01] is an age of spiritual idolatry
[1:15:03] that's why brother bran could preach god
[1:15:05] this evil age it was in this age
[1:15:08] that he was called the god of this age
[1:15:10] anointed once in the end time brother
[1:15:12] bran he tells you what it is janice and
[1:15:13] jamborees
[1:15:16] listen we've always had impersonators
[1:15:19] there's always been impersonators
[1:15:20] but there's again and jamboree's at this
[1:15:22] end time what's the difference
[1:15:24] he said they are reprobate concerning
[1:15:27] the face
[1:15:28] [Music]
[1:15:30] amen not just faith not just the bible
[1:15:33] not just
[1:15:33] prayer in school they are reprobate
[1:15:35] concerning the
[1:15:36] faith what is the faith the message
[1:15:40] is the voice so we're not talking about
[1:15:42] what's floating around out here
[1:15:43] somewhere in there
[1:15:44] it's just down the street somewhere
[1:15:45] we're talking about in the message well
[1:15:47] praise the lord
[1:15:50] listen there's all kinds of stuff that
[1:15:51] calls yourself god all kinds of nonsense
[1:15:53] in the message
[1:15:56] we always see we do this group thing
[1:15:58] like like we want to do with joshua what
[1:16:00] pray god word the message is it was the
[1:16:02] message in you
[1:16:03] here's the question is the message in
[1:16:06] you look there's a lot of things that
[1:16:07] want to hang out listen wherever god is
[1:16:10] wherever satan's at or wherever god is
[1:16:11] that's where satan wants to be
[1:16:13] he's not content to be second fiddle he
[1:16:16] wants a kingdom just like gods
[1:16:18] he wants worship just like god he wants
[1:16:20] to be that's like the sons of god
[1:16:22] he wants everything you got listen
[1:16:24] that's why he fights you that's why he's
[1:16:25] jealous of you
[1:16:26] you've got everything he wants you've
[1:16:29] got an inheritance
[1:16:31] you've got no spirit are the provided
[1:16:34] place of worship
[1:16:35] god has put his name not in this
[1:16:37] building not in the temple
[1:16:39] in you you've got everything he wants
[1:16:43] that's why he fights you so much
[1:16:46] so janice and jamborees they're
[1:16:47] manifested in this hour
[1:16:49] because this is the hour the faith is
[1:16:51] present
[1:16:52] amen not false jesus says false christs
[1:16:57] doing miracles working signs and wonders
[1:17:00] and
[1:17:00] absolutely a hundred percent the devil
[1:17:04] now brother bam ties us in uh another
[1:17:07] end time
[1:17:08] he ties it into janus and jamboree's the
[1:17:10] three angels that went down two of them
[1:17:11] right two went down to sodom is that
[1:17:14] right
[1:17:15] and they blind to the people now he
[1:17:16] tells you that it's billy graham or
[1:17:17] roberts
[1:17:18] these great servants of god these great
[1:17:20] men for all they did yet
[1:17:21] blind is actually idolatries dead in
[1:17:23] these from all over again
[1:17:25] it's actually blind to the people what
[1:17:26] is it it's three seeds we're planted
[1:17:28] yes denomination was planted pentecost
[1:17:31] is planted
[1:17:32] but praise god we are standing here
[1:17:35] today
[1:17:36] we are believing this day because god
[1:17:38] took a man a kentucky hillbilly
[1:17:41] god took a little ignorant man with a
[1:17:42] 7th grade education and by the voice of
[1:17:45] that prophet the word was sowed as well
[1:17:47] listen we don't gotta saw it today it's
[1:17:49] already been sold
[1:17:51] it's the harvest time the work sorry
[1:17:53] then let's partake in what god's laid
[1:17:55] out for us
[1:17:59] when you see the denominational spirits
[1:18:01] these pentecostal spirits try to come
[1:18:03] into the message it's like dollar tree
[1:18:04] yes
[1:18:04] right it's the same thing and listen
[1:18:07] your name will be blotted out from
[1:18:08] listen
[1:18:09] listen we've not just got a natural
[1:18:10] promise what's the book of revelation
[1:18:12] says that if you add to this
[1:18:13] i will add to you the plagues of this
[1:18:15] book if you
[1:18:17] if you take away from this word if you
[1:18:19] take away from this message
[1:18:21] i will take your name out of the book of
[1:18:22] life and your place in the holy city
[1:18:27] so i i that's why i'm saying all this
[1:18:29] i'm very serious about this we
[1:18:30] we don't take these things seriously
[1:18:31] enough
[1:18:33] we're worried about the guy like i said
[1:18:35] earlier calling us on the phone trying
[1:18:36] to take our money
[1:18:37] worried about the guy that's trying to
[1:18:39] you know reevaluate our tax bracket
[1:18:41] we're worried about all that stuff
[1:18:42] what we should be worried about is when
[1:18:43] it tries to come right into our homes
[1:18:46] and our lives and our devotional and our
[1:18:48] prayer life
[1:18:50] we've got idols trying to creep in it's
[1:18:52] time to stroll out
[1:18:54] god did not ordain you to put them in
[1:18:55] the closet got another name for you to
[1:18:57] buy a storage unit and store them there
[1:18:59] until the market goes up and you got a

[1:24:41] brother ram says this false prophets
[1:24:44] will rise and show signs and wonders
[1:24:46] if possible to deceive the very elect
[1:24:47] see now really watch this next statement
[1:24:50] he's a sea
[1:24:51] now just a good a cold formal starchy
[1:24:54] churches and so forth
[1:24:56] of man-made theology that won it the
[1:24:59] elect would never pay no attention to
[1:25:01] that
[1:25:02] he said it's almost like the real thing
[1:25:04] what are you saying brother we we put
[1:25:06] that off on well they're just cold and
[1:25:07] they're starch in the dogmatic we're not
[1:25:09] like them

[1:25:13] i had a brother one time he was
[1:25:14] complaining to me about a certain church
[1:25:15] said well
[1:25:16] they're just a formal cold church down
[1:25:18] there they're just so formal
[1:25:19] they're not real messes they're formal
[1:25:20] churches so well maybe they're better

[1:25:26] rather be cold
[1:25:27] than lukewarm
[1:25:31] [Music]
[1:25:32] they might be cold but what are you
[1:25:35] listen if you're just lukewarm
[1:25:37] you'd be better off being cold or hot if
[1:25:39] you're lukewarm he'll spew
[1:25:41] you out of his mouth obviously we should
[1:25:44] be hot
[1:25:45] but listen we can see her well they're
[1:25:47] just cold and formal that don't mean
[1:25:48] anything here
[1:25:50] they're better off
[1:25:54] we get in the very mouth of god and
[1:25:55] we're just we're just
[1:25:57] religious enough to be miserable
[1:26:00] we've got just enough religion to hate
[1:26:02] our lives
[1:26:04] we've got just enough god about us to
[1:26:06] say man something's wrong but i'm going
[1:26:08] to keep doing what i'm doing anyway well
[1:26:10] if you always do what you always did
[1:26:13] you'll always get what you always got
[1:26:15] it astounds me man i'm all over the
[1:26:17] place it astounded me how people sit in
[1:26:19] church for 20
[1:26:20] 30 40 years can't ever get to victory
[1:26:23] can't overcome
[1:26:24] can't ever seem to get their head above
[1:26:25] water and they just keep going on the
[1:26:27] way we're just going to keep
[1:26:28] who will the lord this and look man i

[1:26:50] like well i've got this problem and i
[1:26:51] can't get over this
[1:26:52] i don't know what to do brother john you
[1:26:55] could probably relate to this
[1:26:56] well brother the bible says this
[1:26:59] and the message says this well yeah i
[1:27:02] know but
[1:27:05] i just need to pray about it what does
[1:27:08] that pray about
[1:27:10] go do what he says
[1:27:13] listen i didn't have to get up this
[1:27:14] morning pray well lord should i go

[1:27:21] do you think about i don't need to pray
[1:27:23] about that
[1:27:24] all right that's wrong
[1:27:28] oh i'm gonna pray about it listen
[1:27:30] muslims pray hindus pray
[1:27:33] but when we pray ought to be in faith
[1:27:35] how can you have faith for some contrary
[1:27:37] to his will
[1:27:38] [Applause]
[1:27:42] they're just cold and formal down there
[1:27:45] listen we know what this message says
[1:27:47] we know what the prophet has testified
[1:27:49] we know this bible said if our life
[1:27:51] doesn't look like this there's something
[1:27:52] wrong
[1:27:53] that's not god's fault that's not your
[1:27:55] brother's fault there's one person
[1:27:56] that's got a responsibility to fix that
[1:28:01] i'd rather be cold than lukewarm well
[1:28:03] anyhow
[1:28:04] brother graham says this this doesn't be
[1:28:06] certain of god
[1:28:08] we may not think that we are idol
[1:28:10] worshipers
[1:28:11] but we are and the government endorses
[1:28:14] it boy if that ain't the truth
[1:28:15] yeah that's a whole nother sermon we'll
[1:28:17] get into today the government endorses
[1:28:19] it
[1:28:20] people today are idol worshipers because
[1:28:22] they worship idols
[1:28:23] some of them worship movie stars for
[1:28:25] idols some worship money for idols
[1:28:28] and some worship television stars as
[1:28:30] idols but all that you put before god as
[1:28:33] an idol
[1:28:34] let it be whatever it may be and a lot
[1:28:36] of people like that quote they stop
[1:28:37] right there
[1:28:38] but you read the very next paragraph he
[1:28:40] says even to satan our great adversary
[1:28:43] is such a smart one until he puts even
[1:28:45] sometimes
[1:28:46] the church of god the church before god
[1:28:50] yes right you might have a great church
[1:28:54] it may be a great building it may be a
[1:28:56] great denomination again it may be a
[1:28:57] great congregation
[1:28:59] but let nothing come before god in your
[1:29:02] heart
[1:29:03] anything in before god is an idol amen
[1:29:05] listen your church not this church
[1:29:07] hopefully but i mean
[1:29:09] listen no one's immune to this i'll just
[1:29:10] say it this way you're not immune
[1:29:11] because you're sitting in a certain
[1:29:12] congregation
[1:29:14] that's a judas walk with jesus the best
[1:29:17] preacher
[1:29:18] the most holy man listen that don't make
[1:29:20] anything well i got a great preacher i
[1:29:21] got a great church
[1:29:22] you can worship that before god
[1:29:30] listen if you believe your church over
[1:29:32] the word of god it's an idol
[1:29:35] but the man tells you what is in the i
[1:29:37] think it's the indictment he talks about
[1:29:38] this that's what they did with barabbas
[1:29:39] they
[1:29:40] they chose a murderer over the word of
[1:29:43] life
[1:29:45] hey man they bleached with the i i had a
[1:29:48] bible study here with
[1:29:48] some young people here a couple weeks
[1:29:50] back i made this point i said we go to a
[1:29:51] message church
[1:29:52] you hear people preach you say oh we
[1:29:54] leave the message listen there's all
[1:29:55] kinds of nonsense
[1:29:56] all around the world that calls itself a
[1:29:57] message they this guy's christ this and
[1:29:59] this and that
[1:30:00] eighth and ninth and tenth day and
[1:30:01] whatever else and all this polygamy and
[1:30:03] everything else
[1:30:04] it all calls itself message they all
[1:30:07] believe what's preached
[1:30:08] that's what's wrong they ought to
[1:30:10] believe what god says
[1:30:12] if it's contrary listen if i get up here
[1:30:15] if i get up here and i preach something
[1:30:17] new contrary
[1:30:18] throw it out your soul is not worth my
[1:30:23] opinion
[1:30:24] [Applause]
[1:30:25] my feelings yours whoever it is let
[1:30:28] every man's word be a lie
[1:30:31] and let god's be true i say amen
[1:30:35] so sick of this wishy-washy church going
[1:30:37] blah blah blah
[1:30:38] listen we're christians we're supposed
[1:30:41] to be tough
[1:30:42] we're running we're not the hotbed plant
[1:30:45] we aren't able to stand here when nobody
[1:30:47] else wants to
[1:30:48] and states the truth anyhow
[1:30:52] listen if your favorite preacher can
[1:30:53] move you off the word of god you've got
[1:30:55] an idol in your life
[1:30:56] if your church and your idea and your
[1:30:58] doctrine move you off
[1:30:59] you've got an idol in your life if your
[1:31:02] christian experience is limited
[1:31:03] to a four-walled building you've made an
[1:31:06] idol out of your church
[1:31:10] you know why so many people like going
[1:31:11] to church because they can't be the
[1:31:13] church
[1:31:15] that's what it is we we like the
[1:31:17] experience of going here oh we had a
[1:31:19] great
[1:31:19] oh it was just so wonderful listen i
[1:31:21] wasn't called to go to church
[1:31:23] i'm called to be the church
[1:31:26] now you still go to church because
[1:31:28] that's what the church does listen we're
[1:31:30] not imitating them they're imitating us
[1:31:32] we're ordained to this where
[1:31:36] are they called out we're more than the
[1:31:38] court we've entered in
[1:31:39] we're the bride of jesus christ
[1:31:44] it's like i think wigglesworth said he
[1:31:46] said the reason most people don't see
[1:31:47] jesus
[1:31:48] it's because christian people aren't
[1:31:49] filled with jesus
[1:31:52] they're satisfied he said this is that's
[1:31:54] the real cases now they are satisfied
[1:31:56] to attend weekly meetings read the bible
[1:31:59] occasionally
[1:31:59] pray infrequently now you've got a
[1:32:03] lifeless powerless church
[1:32:05] he said their lives they're so parallel
[1:32:07] and to the world
[1:32:08] till they look no different where'd your
[1:32:10] token go you looked like everybody else
[1:32:12] somebody stole your secret samson
[1:32:16] somebody stole your secrets but it is
[1:32:17] you give it away
[1:32:19] some delightless somewhere i had
[1:32:22] well he's not here so i can tell the
[1:32:23] story i had to i had to meet with a
[1:32:25] brother here a few several days back
[1:32:27] and he's you know he's got he's got
[1:32:29] family and different ones and stuff and
[1:32:31] he's been struggling his life he's one
[1:32:32] of these he's one of these roller
[1:32:33] coaster christians
[1:32:35] and i got up and i looked him in the
[1:32:36] face and said here's the problem with
[1:32:37] you brother
[1:32:38] i said you fear men more than you fear
[1:32:40] god
[1:32:41] and then you fear men when you fear god
[1:32:43] that's why all this insecurity and all
[1:32:44] this not that's why that bothers you
[1:32:46] well this person said this and this
[1:32:48] person said that and i don't know which
[1:32:49] way to believe
[1:32:50] i said you fear men too much if you fear
[1:32:52] god
[1:32:54] you put god first listen if you can
[1:32:56] stand before god
[1:32:57] there's not a man can stand before you
[1:33:01] i said put god first i asked him this
[1:33:04] this has been my hobby horsely i said i
[1:33:06] asked him i said what's your family
[1:33:08] altar look like
[1:33:10] i said well i said i don't really have
[1:33:12] one so to speak i said well
[1:33:13] that'd be a good place to start it
[1:33:16] astounds me
[1:33:17] well you say this is real simple what i
[1:33:18] mean b because nobody does it
[1:33:22] hardly not many people do it but it
[1:33:24] astounds me how many families

[1:33:33] preach it again
[1:33:35] why did i even ask it astounds me no i'm
[1:33:38] being serious now though it astounds me
[1:33:40] how many families in this message don't
[1:33:41] have any sort of a family altar

[1:33:45] say hey we're gonna maybe they come over

[1:34:00] dads they don't take time to read with
[1:34:02] their children
[1:34:02] they don't take time to pray even in
[1:34:04] their own lives let alone with their
[1:34:05] children
[1:34:06] and then they and they're like i just
[1:34:07] don't know why my kids are interested in
[1:34:08] god why don't they want to serve god i'm
[1:34:10] like well they learned it somewhere
[1:34:14] that's not everybody i understand
[1:34:15] different i'm not but i'm saying
[1:34:17] so many times we are guilty of doing
[1:34:19] them a disservice
[1:34:21] listen if we want to serve god let's
[1:34:23] show them what it means
[1:34:29] brother graham said you want closer to
[1:34:30] god what do you do read your bible and
[1:34:31] pray
[1:34:32] yes every day that's right brother
[1:34:35] that's easy well then if it's so easy
[1:34:36] why do so many people struggle with it
[1:34:41] it astounds me what goes on in message
[1:34:42] churches message churches
[1:34:45] stuff that goes on i'm thinking do
[1:34:46] people even read their bibles anymore we
[1:34:48] ought to instantly be able to say wait
[1:34:49] that's not the scripture
[1:34:51] that's not the but that's not what a
[1:34:52] prophet said brother branham said this
[1:34:55] no he didn't right listen you gotta
[1:34:58] study the message a little bit too
[1:34:59] listen to types say man it's telling me
[1:35:01] how many times i've heard the preacher
[1:35:02] well brother rem said this
[1:35:04] it's like the opposite of what he
[1:35:05] actually said but okay and everybody
[1:35:06] amen
[1:35:08] i've sat in services
[1:35:11] well praise the lord i've sat in
[1:35:12] services and every like i talked about
[1:35:14] with joshua
[1:35:16] brother i'm like that's all that's
[1:35:18] completely contrary to the word of god
[1:35:22] what is it we're not seeking god like we
[1:35:24] used to
[1:35:25] we're letting some man do it for us
[1:35:28] listen that's no different than what
[1:35:29] they did with moses we'll just speak to
[1:35:30] moses
[1:35:31] we don't want to hear from god
[1:35:35] we're going to talk about nicolaitanism
[1:35:36] and all this others who put the people
[1:35:38] who put moses in that position the
[1:35:40] people
[1:35:42] i think was john calvin said that god
[1:35:44] gives wicked people wicked rulers
[1:35:46] now you know why americans are present
[1:35:48] today
[1:35:52] they heat for themselves teachers listen
[1:35:55] they want to hear something they got
[1:35:56] exactly what they wanted
[1:35:58] it's exactly the devil
[1:36:03] the world goes to church the world loves
[1:36:05] god
[1:36:07] i just love pleasure more uh i'm
[1:36:09] building this all to a reason
[1:36:10] what's different between joshua and
[1:36:12] everybody else there's got to be a
[1:36:13] difference between us and the rest of
[1:36:15] the world that's what i want you to key
[1:36:16] on today
[1:36:18] i've been coming to this point and i was
[1:36:19] talking about this with adoption there's
[1:36:21] there's different things in an adopted
[1:36:23] or mature son that god is looking for
[1:36:25] but i want you to look at jesus life and
[1:36:27] joshua's life
[1:36:29] jesus said my meat is to do the will of
[1:36:30] him that sent me
[1:36:32] amen it was god's purpose what makes us
[1:36:35] different than the rest of the world
[1:36:36] hopefully
[1:36:38] there's a separate line and it's this
[1:36:40] that's this word devotion
[1:36:42] amen i'm talking about doing devotions
[1:36:43] the word devotion is an interesting word
[1:36:45] to me amen
[1:36:46] because until you let christ take full
[1:36:48] possession of you you can be a good
[1:36:49] church member
[1:36:51] right you you can you can do all these
[1:36:53] things and you can receive accolades of
[1:36:55] men you can get rewards just the
[1:36:56] pharisees did that
[1:36:59] remember to be a prisoner to the word
[1:37:01] and will of god that's a devotion amen
[1:37:04] listen what was god's purpose in this
[1:37:06] hour to get preeminence
[1:37:08] in a people what is preeminence it means
[1:37:11] to have first place
[1:37:13] listen you can give god second place and
[1:37:15] third place
[1:37:16] and fourth place and he'll take whatever
[1:37:17] you give him because he's a gentleman
[1:37:19] but is there someone here says i'll give
[1:37:21] him first place
[1:37:23] no matter what
[1:37:27] now i've got four young adults i'm
[1:37:30] raising up
[1:37:32] and all the time i'm trying to instill
[1:37:33] in this idea of responsibility
[1:37:36] because like you know nobody has it
[1:37:40] today
[1:37:41] our generation is not being raised to be
[1:37:43] responsible
[1:37:46] and so i'm always talking you need to be
[1:37:47] responsible you've got responsibility be
[1:37:49] a man be
[1:37:50] a woman you've got responsibility but
[1:37:52] here's what i want you to catch
[1:37:54] devotion is greater than just
[1:37:55] responsibility
[1:37:57] amen we have many responsibilities as
[1:38:00] adults amen
[1:38:01] but devotion goes beyond the idea of
[1:38:03] responsibility even
[1:38:04] amen devotion carries with the idea of
[1:38:07] responsibility but not always the other
[1:38:08] way around amen
[1:38:10] and this is why i'm saying this is very
[1:38:11] easy in our lives as christians to
[1:38:13] replace one with the other
[1:38:14] we take our devotion to god our devotion
[1:38:17] our passion for worship
[1:38:18] and god and his purpose and just becomes
[1:38:20] a job to us
[1:38:22] listen many preachers listen i've been
[1:38:23] to this place before where you're not
[1:38:25] careful
[1:38:26] you stand in this pulpit it just becomes
[1:38:28] a job well i guess i got to go do it
[1:38:29] again that's just what i'm supposed to
[1:38:30] do
[1:38:31] god never let this become just a
[1:38:33] responsibility to me
[1:38:34] i am responsible for it but i want to be
[1:38:37] more than responsible
[1:38:38] i want a devotion to it listen there's
[1:38:42] nothing wrong with responsibility now
[1:38:43] amen
[1:38:44] there's nothing wrong with a sense of
[1:38:45] duty but devotion goes further than that
[1:38:48] amen
[1:38:48] listen i am responsible as an adult
[1:38:52] to pay taxes i'm not devoted to it
[1:38:57] i'm not passionate about the idea of
[1:39:00] handing money over to a government that
[1:39:01] has no idea what they're doing with it
[1:39:05] i don't sit there and go to the store
[1:39:07] and pay seven and a half percent sales i
[1:39:09] say praise god
[1:39:10] i'm so grateful that the government
[1:39:12] knows how to spend my money better than
[1:39:14] me
[1:39:17] thank god i've got an electric bill
[1:39:19] coming i
[1:39:20] love paying bills i love taking camera i
[1:39:23] love
[1:39:24] eating properly because of my health
[1:39:30] i've got all kinds of responsibilities
[1:39:32] you've got all kinds of responsibilities
[1:39:35] but don't ever let god don't let your
[1:39:38] purpose be
[1:39:38] just a responsibility
[1:39:45] listen my bills come every month i don't
[1:39:46] jump up and say
[1:39:48] the bills are here today it's the 15th
[1:39:51] time to make no i'm thankful i have a
[1:39:53] house
[1:39:54] i'm thinking i'll have electricity but
[1:39:55] listen i'm not excited i don't wake up
[1:39:57] with this burning passion when i wake up
[1:39:59] in the morning when i lay my head down
[1:40:00] like i love paying bills
[1:40:02] i love taxes i don't
[1:40:07] don't want nothing to do with that
[1:40:08] listen we're going somewhere not to do
[1:40:10] all this stuff anymore
[1:40:11] praise god for that listen
[1:40:14] this kingdom of god is more than my
[1:40:16] responsibility it's my passion
[1:40:19] it's my devotion all these men i write
[1:40:22] about the beginning
[1:40:23] they were responsible but they didn't
[1:40:25] get
[1:40:28] something different about joshua there's
[1:40:30] something different about these men that
[1:40:31] i talked about there's something
[1:40:32] different about the real believer
[1:40:34] they're devoted when you're devoted
[1:40:36] you'll make
[1:40:37] sacrifices hey man you say i
[1:40:40] ain't got time to read my bible and pray
[1:40:41] you'll make time
[1:40:44] so when i was a sinner i found time to
[1:40:46] do all the things i wanted to do
[1:40:48] if i didn't have the money i found the
[1:40:49] money if i didn't have the time i found
[1:40:51] the time
[1:40:52] this is my passion this is my
[1:40:55] devotion i don't care if i'm going to
[1:40:58] miss a meal
[1:40:59] let me serve god
[1:41:05] i got a wife back here and i'd like to
[1:41:08] be able to say
[1:41:10] i hope i hope this is this is my
[1:41:12] testimony hey man
[1:41:14] i love my wife and i'm responsible here
[1:41:16] but i want to be more than just
[1:41:17] responsible for my wife
[1:41:19] and devoted to my wife devoted to my
[1:41:21] children listen that's why so many men
[1:41:24] they get to be 40 50 whatever they get
[1:41:25] in the middle of age they have a midlife
[1:41:26] crisis
[1:41:27] they used to love their lives they used
[1:41:29] to be devoted to her
[1:41:31] but after a while the cares of life and
[1:41:33] day-to-day living set in
[1:41:36] they're just responsible now it's just a
[1:41:38] burden
[1:41:40] they just see the burden they don't see
[1:41:42] the joy they don't see the
[1:41:44] unfailing realities anymore it's just a
[1:41:47] responsibility it's just a burden all we
[1:41:49] want to do is get rid of it
[1:41:51] we go trade her in for a new model they
[1:41:53] do this they do that
[1:41:54] all kinds of crazy stuff why somewhere
[1:41:57] in their life the thing that used to be
[1:41:58] devoted to
[1:42:00] they lost the joy of it
[1:42:03] hey man listen i've got a responsibility
[1:42:07] in my wife and kids
[1:42:07] but i want more than that i want to be
[1:42:09] devoted i want them to look at my life
[1:42:11] and say
[1:42:12] that daddy really cares about me he's a
[1:42:14] real husband he's a real daddy he wants
[1:42:16] what's best for me
[1:42:18] even if it costs him
[1:42:21] when paul goes to mars hill he sees
[1:42:24] these greeks
[1:42:25] the bible says he beheld their devotions
[1:42:27] amen
[1:42:28] see where your real passion is that's
[1:42:30] where your devotion is it's the same
[1:42:31] thing
[1:42:34] i was talking to a brother a while back
[1:42:36] and his son was trying to learn chats
[1:42:38] and he's really good at chess and i was
[1:42:39] playing with him and
[1:42:40] i used to play a lot of chess and he's
[1:42:42] like oh you should go to tournament
[1:42:43] you should play chess i said well i said
[1:42:45] i appreciate that i said though
[1:42:46] i said uh i'm i'm good at chess but i'm
[1:42:49] not real great at it and i told him this
[1:42:50] and the reason is is i don't love to
[1:42:51] play chess i like to play chess i get
[1:42:54] bored with it after about three games
[1:42:55] like well we're not doing
[1:42:56] this for three more months you know what
[1:42:59] i'm saying
[1:42:59] i don't have a you look at a man that
[1:43:01] even in the natural that excels at a job
[1:43:03] or
[1:43:03] a sport or whatever he's got a drive or
[1:43:06] a passion for it that's what sets them
[1:43:07] out
[1:43:08] above the rest that's what that's what
[1:43:10] moves him out further
[1:43:12] yeah even then after you take a man and
[1:43:14] he's got a business and maybe he's maybe
[1:43:15] he's labeled in that business for years
[1:43:17] it looked like he was going to fall
[1:43:18] through but something happens he invents
[1:43:20] something whatever
[1:43:21] he labored he gave his life to it and he
[1:43:23] might neglect his wife and kids to do it
[1:43:27] because that's where his passion is what
[1:43:29] i'm saying what i want is
[1:43:30] my passion my devotion let it always be
[1:43:33] god and his purpose
[1:43:35] my wife and my children
[1:43:38] listen many men i'm gonna bring this
[1:43:40] full circle many men like these men here
[1:43:43] many preachers they start out with the
[1:43:45] best of intentions
[1:43:48] many preachers they all got the right
[1:43:49] intentions starting out but some are
[1:43:50] money and women
[1:43:52] and popularity some of that set in it
[1:43:54] stole their passion it redirected their
[1:43:56] energy
[1:43:57] they're no longer devoted to the thing
[1:43:58] they used to be devoted to
[1:44:00] you say well that's them and i'm not
[1:44:01] preaching false doctrine i'm not this on
[1:44:03] that how devoted are you amen
[1:44:06] what's your devotion today to christ
[1:44:08] look like compared to what it used to be
[1:44:11] because if it's not what it used to be
[1:44:12] then it's not what it ought to be it
[1:44:13] ought to be greater
[1:44:15] but so my devotion my passion for god
[1:44:17] today it's greater than it's ever been
[1:44:19] that doesn't maybe look
[1:44:20] quite like it did when i was a little
[1:44:22] more surprised
[1:44:24] i learned to cut the corner a few ways i
[1:44:26] got a little experience amen but listen
[1:44:27] i i've been through battles i've been
[1:44:29] through situations it's like my natural
[1:44:31] marriage we've been through things
[1:44:32] but our love is greater and stronger
[1:44:34] today because we we went through it
[1:44:36] together
[1:44:38] because we stayed together this god's
[1:44:40] been faithful me in the worst times of
[1:44:42] my life
[1:44:43] not just when i was on the mountaintop
[1:44:44] that's why i'm more devoted
[1:44:46] i'm more passionate about god today than
[1:44:49] i've ever been
[1:44:50] hey
[1:44:53] see the father's looking brother man
[1:44:55] says an adoption and hearing him over
[1:44:56] and over again
[1:44:57] he's looking for a son that's interested
[1:45:00] in the father's business not just
[1:45:02] trained not just capable
[1:45:04] interested he's interested in my work he
[1:45:08] he wants to see what i'm doing he's
[1:45:09] looking on my shoulder that's really
[1:45:10] neat i want to see how you do that
[1:45:12] he's interested in the father's business
[1:45:14] we're interested in the kingdom of god
[1:45:16] we're interested in souls
[1:45:18] interested in jesus christ
[1:45:22] amen souls are my passion god's children
[1:45:26] are my passion
[1:45:27] amen when i first became a chris when i
[1:45:30] first come the message
[1:45:31] i remember brother i'm saying brother
[1:45:32] brad i'm saying this in elijah 1955 he
[1:45:34] said if you love god
[1:45:35] you'll love his children right john
[1:45:38] talks about that
[1:45:39] if you love god you'll love us children
[1:45:40] he said i'm a daddy
[1:45:42] he said if you did something if you want
[1:45:44] to do something nice for me he said do
[1:45:45] it for my children
[1:45:47] brother brown says that this astounds me
[1:45:50] it's but it's the truth
[1:45:51] brother baptist said i would rather you
[1:45:52] love my children than love me
[1:45:55] that's not the astounding part the
[1:45:56] stunning part he says is and god feels
[1:45:58] the same way
[1:45:59] god would rather you love his children
[1:46:00] than love him yeah that's really good
[1:46:05] listen god does not need me to minister
[1:46:07] food to him today
[1:46:09] in the natural he doesn't need me to
[1:46:10] take him water but if you do it for one
[1:46:12] of these as children
[1:46:14] it's no different than doing it for him
[1:46:17] he would rat listen he doesn't lack
[1:46:19] and as a great infinite spirit amen but
[1:46:22] you do something for one of his little
[1:46:23] ones that means so much to him
[1:46:28] that's my passion i love god so much
[1:46:30] this brother bram said i've got a gift
[1:46:31] i love god that's why i want to do
[1:46:33] something for his children
[1:46:36] amen he deserves first place now i'm
[1:46:39] going to bring this up to a close here
[1:46:40] real quick but
[1:46:41] brother bram talks about this in the
[1:46:42] ephesian church age he's preaching seven
[1:46:44] church ages and talks about this
[1:46:46] the ephesian church age they were not a
[1:46:48] church that was under the threat of
[1:46:50] false doctrine
[1:46:51] amen they were the most ordered church
[1:46:53] they were taught they've been instructed
[1:46:54] by paul
[1:46:55] they had everything in a row amen right
[1:46:57] the looming threat of the ephesian
[1:46:59] church that first age that first church
[1:47:01] in that first age
[1:47:02] was not some you know sort of backslid
[1:47:05] preacher this that
[1:47:06] their primary threat was they were
[1:47:08] losing their first love
[1:47:09] amen it wasn't the persecution it wasn't
[1:47:14] false doctrine all these other things
[1:47:15] they lost their first love now it didn't
[1:47:18] say they didn't love god they just
[1:47:20] lost their first love they lost the
[1:47:22] preeminence of it
[1:47:24] and you look at their subsequent
[1:47:25] backsliding and the condition of each
[1:47:27] age each cooling off brother bam says
[1:47:28] it's the same thing it never each oh it
[1:47:30] starts with
[1:47:31] yes they lost their first love then they
[1:47:33] fall into this they fall
[1:47:35] it's always so listen your first love is
[1:47:37] your first line of defense
[1:47:40] if you're losing your first love it's
[1:47:42] time to get right with god don't wait
[1:47:43] till you stop praying
[1:47:44] don't wait till you stop reading your
[1:47:45] bible don't wait till you're in a gutter
[1:47:47] somewhere in the alley or a bar
[1:47:50] as soon as you see you're losing your
[1:47:51] first love that's the time to get right
[1:47:52] with god say go what happened
[1:47:54] to my person what happened to my
[1:47:57] devotion
[1:47:58] this is not what i used to be i'm lost
[1:48:01] and joy my salvation cry out
[1:48:04] like david restore to me
[1:48:07] the joy of my salvation
[1:48:10] in order to be joy unspeakable and full
[1:48:13] of glory
[1:48:16] i preached this before what causes a
[1:48:19] good man to leave
[1:48:20] church what caused him to leave a
[1:48:22] faithful wife or
[1:48:23] whatever these things he gets
[1:48:25] dissatisfied
[1:48:26] he tries to reinvent himself or change
[1:48:28] things amen he's dissatisfied like dan
[1:48:31] just satisfied with where he's at but
[1:48:34] god give you is good enough it's your
[1:48:36] dissatisfaction
