[36:04] speaking Lord we'll give you the praise
[36:07] now and in the time to come for we ask
[36:09] these things in Jesus Christ's name amen
[36:12] amen amen Hebrews are are I should say
[36:16] Romans Romans what am I doing in
[36:20] Hebrews I tell you Hebrews is a good
[36:23] book but we need to be in Romans
[36:29] sorry
[36:30] for using my pages like that Romans
[36:33] chapter 12 starting with verse number
[36:35] one I beseech you therefore Brethren by
[36:38] the mercies of God that you present your
[36:41] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and
[36:44] acceptable unto God which is your
[36:46] reasonable service and be not conformed
[36:49] to this world but be transformed by the
[36:52] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[36:55] what is that good and acceptable and
[36:58] perfect will of God for I say through
[37:01] the grace given unto me to every man
[37:05] that is among you not to think of
[37:08] himself more highly than he ought to
[37:12] think but to think soberly according as
[37:16] God have dealt to every man The Measure
[37:21] of Faith amen God bless you may be
[37:24] seated brother bandam said in the
[37:26] message have faith in God he said faith
[37:29] is not something that you imagine in
[37:32] your
[37:33] mind he says it's something that
[37:37] absolutely you have if we believe the
[37:40] scriptures the scriptures says God is
[37:42] dealt to every man The Measure of Faith
[37:45] right now Faith is an actual substance
[37:47] that comes from God Amen we can say that
[37:50] this actual substance if you look it up
[37:52] is an assurance or a
[37:55] confidence the Bible says that the
[37:58] substance is this substance is is things
[38:01] hoped for it is the substance that
[38:04] things hope for so when we all have
[38:07] situations in our life that we want to
[38:09] turn out a certain way amen and we have
[38:12] hope in them that they will turn out a
[38:15] certain way uh whether we're praying for
[38:18] people that are sick or there's
[38:20] basically any possible thing that you
[38:22] could desire of the Lord you have a hope
[38:25] that it's going to turn out
[38:27] a right a certain way even people in the
[38:29] world have hope that things will be uh I
[38:33] mean people hope that you know things
[38:35] are going to turn around for this world
[38:36] or turn around for America they have
[38:38] this this hope but faith is something
[38:41] different
[38:43] amen faith has a substance that hope
[38:46] doesn't have
[38:48] right that's
[38:51] right so when we hope for something this
[38:54] element is missing
[38:57] this element which is an absolute
[38:59] assurance that it's going to happen
[39:01] right there's the difference is there's
[39:04] an absolute Assurance now how can I have
[39:06] that absolute Assurance how can I know
[39:09] I'm not a Seer I can't see the future
[39:12] how can I have it God can give it to you
[39:16] amen God can give it to
[39:19] you Hebrews 11 uh verse three says
[39:23] through faith we understand that the
[39:25] world's were framed by the word of God
[39:29] that's right so when God said let there
[39:32] be whatever let there be light Let There
[39:34] Be animals there was an absolute
[39:37] assurance that it was going to happen
[39:38] amen because faith comes from God and
[39:41] God God don't just hope it's going to
[39:44] happen he knows if it's going to happen
[39:46] amen his word will not return void amen
[39:50] when God told man don't eat of the
[39:53] devil's knowledge or you'll die there
[39:55] was an absolute assurance that it was
[39:58] going to happen when God spoke it he
[40:01] knew that if man would eat then he would
[40:04] die because God spoke it and when God
[40:07] spoke it it was faith it was not hope
[40:10] amen when Jesus said destroy this Temple
[40:14] and in three days I'll raise it up there
[40:17] was an absolute Assurance in Jesus
[40:19] Christ that it was going to happen it
[40:21] wasn't just I hope it happens I hope the
[40:23] father comes through no it was going to
[40:26] happen amen amen and when
[40:28] Jesus uh looked at
[40:32] Peter Peter's good intentions when Peter
[40:35] said that you know I'm going to die with
[40:39] you he said before the crawls Thou
[40:42] shalt deny me
[40:44] Thrice there was an absolute Assurance
[40:48] in Jesus Christ that it was going to
[40:51] happen
[40:52] now Peter didn't have it he did did not
[40:56] have
[40:58] that he was kind of hoping it wouldn't
[41:03] happen but you understand when God
[41:05] speaks it's Faith that's why it's so
[41:08] important that when we come to church or
[41:10] we're listening to a tape or we get on
[41:11] our knees to pray that we hear the voice
[41:14] of God because that's what gives Faith
[41:18] amen we can say through absolute
[41:21] Assurance of God we understand that the
[41:24] things happened
[41:26] the things that God did
[41:30] happen by the word of God when he spoke
[41:33] it it happened it was absolute
[41:35] Assurance he said my word will not
[41:39] return unto me void we we don't have to
[41:42] worry about God coming through with his
[41:45] word right amen
[41:48] amen the struggle is is is is our word
[41:52] and other people's
[41:54] words but
[41:57] but but we don't ever have to worry
[41:59] about God's
[42:01] word now God according to the scriptures
[42:05] has dealt like playing cards he's dealt
[42:08] to every one of us a Measure of
[42:11] Faith I want you to know this it is
[42:14] exactly this the faith that he has given
[42:16] each of us is exactly the same faith
[42:20] that he used to create the world yes
[42:23] it's not a different Faith amen it is
[42:25] the same exact faith if you look it up
[42:28] it's pistis which means
[42:32] Assurance so God has given us the same
[42:35] thing that he used to create the
[42:40] worlds he's given us a measure of
[42:43] absolute Assurance of God am now it may
[42:48] not seem like it we may not realize it
[42:52] but the word of God is true and this is
[42:54] what we've got to We've Got to Believe
[42:56] the word more than how we
[42:58] feel CU so often we we we question we
[43:01] doubt we're we're wondering where we're
[43:02] standing but we know that inside of us
[43:05] somewhere is an absolute Assurance of
[43:08] God I want to give you an example of
[43:11] that you got
[43:14] saved that's I mean just to put it in
[43:16] simplicity at one time we didn't even
[43:19] know God we didn't even think about God
[43:22] Amen and something inside of us
[43:27] believed that if we repented and we gave
[43:29] our heart to God that God would save us
[43:33] that was the that was that measure of
[43:35] faith that God gave us so it is there
[43:39] we're living proof that it's there
[43:42] amen when God delivered us of filthy
[43:45] habits that was the faith that was once
[43:47] delivered to
[43:50] us desires we have
[43:54] desires that we we've been delivered of
[43:57] we have our lives that have been changed
[44:00] our Nature has been changed things have
[44:02] happened in our life that has happened
[44:04] through faith
[44:06] amen and through faith
[44:09] alone
[44:10] now all these examples is a measure of
[44:14] absolute assurance that God is inside of
[44:17] you absolute assurance that God is
[44:21] inside of you you took God at his word
[44:24] and when you activate that
[44:26] measure your life
[44:30] changes when you activated it I believe
[44:33] the word of God that if I Repent that
[44:36] God's blood will cover my sins he won't
[44:38] hold it against me on the day of
[44:40] judgment you activated that Measure of
[44:42] Faith and it brought forth a life inside
[44:44] of you it wasn't just some imagination
[44:47] there was something that concretely
[44:48] happened in our
[44:51] lives now you activate the measure that
[44:54] you have by simp simp L uniting with
[44:57] what God has already
[44:59] said it is that simple you've got to
[45:03] unite with it you've got to become one
[45:06] with it in other words if you just went
[45:08] to church all your life but you never
[45:10] really wanted to give your your heart to
[45:12] God you really never wanted to be saved
[45:14] you wouldn't ignite Unite with the word
[45:17] that's being
[45:18] preached but when you want what that
[45:21] word is saying you agree with it and the
[45:23] faith inside of you is activated to take
[45:26] a hold of God's word and then it becomes
[45:28] a reality amen now I know that you know
[45:32] this is very simplistic but I'll tell
[45:34] you I'm tell you the devil is so
[45:37] great at at taking our lives and getting
[45:39] them so con so confused and twisted and
[45:44] and messed up with many different types
[45:46] of thoughts that we can't seem to have
[45:48] faith to do anything but we got to get
[45:50] back to the
[45:52] basics just call the devil out and tell
[45:54] him he's a liar
[45:56] the faith is already
[45:58] there just agree with the word Unite
[46:01] with the
[46:02] word God's word is really the only thing
[46:05] that's absolute Assurance right
[46:08] everything's got everything else has got
[46:10] holes in it yes but God's word is yay
[46:13] and it's amen
[46:16] amen we probably didn't realize it at
[46:20] one point in our lives but something
[46:24] triggered that faith that dealt to
[46:27] us and that is when we heard the voice
[46:30] of God spoken to us
[46:34] personally think about this I never got
[46:39] saved when God spoke to Brother
[46:45] Bruce Brother Bruce didn't get saved
[46:48] when God spoke to brother
[46:50] Beckman see it's personal this is why
[46:54] it's so important that even though we're
[46:56] here collectively as a as a body we've
[46:59] got to be so in tune with
[47:02] God because I tell you the one thing
[47:04] that the devil can't stand against is
[47:06] you believing to the
[47:08] word and we've got to hear that
[47:11] personally so everybody else can be in
[47:14] la la land but you're so in tune with
[47:16] God that you hear the voice of God
[47:18] spoken to you and that's what what
[47:20] triggers it that's what what activates
[47:22] your faith it becomes real amen and
[47:26] Jesus said everyone that is of Truth
[47:29] Hearth my voice amen do you belong to
[47:32] God Amen you anchor it you you hear his
[47:36] voice don't this is the
[47:39] truth there's so many examples in the
[47:43] Bible
[47:45] when uh the Lord speaks to you the devil
[47:49] wants to come right behind that and get
[47:51] you all
[47:54] confused
[47:56] and a lot of times the Devil comes and
[47:58] he says this is the voice of
[48:01] God to do the same thing to confuse
[48:04] you but Jesus said my sheep hear my
[48:07] voice and they follow me
[48:11] amen so this you know we can just tell
[48:14] the devil get behind me am now we need
[48:18] to remember that this Measure of Faith
[48:20] is still in us today amen it didn't go
[48:23] away after we got saved it's still in US
[48:26] and Peter says that we are kept by the
[48:30] power of God through faith unto
[48:34] salvation so when things just seem to be
[48:37] falling
[48:39] out it's through your faith that you're
[48:41] kept by the power of God if you do not
[48:44] if you start to lose
[48:48] Faith what's going to keep
[48:50] you right because without faith it's
[48:52] impossible to please God you've got to
[48:54] trust God
[48:56] just
[48:57] like you're when it comes time to take
[49:02] communion that's the acid test whether
[49:05] you're walking with God it's not good
[49:07] enough to say well I don't feel worthy I
[49:09] haven't lived right and and I'm not
[49:11] going to take
[49:12] it that's damnation to you you've got to
[49:15] take it so you've got to get you've got
[49:18] to have get that thing right so you can
[49:21] take communion because God expects it
[49:23] and demands that and I say it's the same
[49:25] thing with faith we've got to have faith
[49:27] in God and it's what keeps
[49:30] us we don't believe in the power of God
[49:33] keeping
[49:34] us then how can we be
[49:37] kept we are kept by the power of God
[49:40] through the measure of the absolute
[49:44] Assurance of God now now a lot of times
[49:47] we look at Faith and we there's parables
[49:49] in the Bible that talks about how it's
[49:51] just the the the smallest of all the uh
[49:54] herbs seeds it is the smallest one yet
[49:58] it grows into be the biggest one right
[50:00] and so here's the thing often we look at
[50:02] ourselves as heav you know where's our
[50:04] faith and I'm just trying look we don't
[50:07] need something more than what we got we
[50:10] need to believe in what we
[50:14] have the devil wants to keep us to you
[50:17] know put the carrot out there look I'm
[50:20] just going to take God at his word today
[50:23] that's all I got to do take him at his
[50:24] word today
[50:27] we can still activate the measure of
[50:29] faith that we have any time in our
[50:32] life we can take God at his
[50:35] word we just have that absolute
[50:38] assurance that he's given each and every
[50:40] one of us how many times that we just
[50:42] say boy I just I just don't feel like I
[50:44] got any faith we've all been
[50:47] there that's the moment that we got to
[50:50] say no I have faith because God gave it
[50:52] to me
[50:54] amen you don't have to feel
[50:58] it faith is a sick sense that goes
[51:01] beyond feelings it
[51:04] is let's take a a couple examples in the
[51:08] Bible there was a woman with a blood
[51:09] issue I believe she had it for 12 years
[51:13] she activated the measure of absolute
[51:16] assurance that God had given her she
[51:20] activated it she said within her heart
[51:23] if I could just touch His Garment I
[51:26] shall be made whole that was that was in
[51:28] her heart she she believed that if she
[51:30] could do that it would
[51:32] happen and Jesus said who touched me am
[51:36] and they kind of rebuked him everybody's
[51:39] touching you what do you mean who's
[51:41] touched you and he said somebody have
[51:44] touched me for I perceive that virtue is
[51:48] gone out of me amen you know people can
[51:52] go like this all day long no strength
[51:55] virtues going out of you but Faith took
[51:59] strength out of
[52:00] Jesus Faith did she activated the faith
[52:04] that she had she was the one that said
[52:06] if I can just Touch the Hem of His
[52:09] Garment brother brah said that a
[52:12] person's Faith pulls on
[52:16] God think about it we've heard him say
[52:18] that you you pull on the gift you
[52:21] operate the gift well I'm just going to
[52:23] say your faith pull
[52:27] God and and if if your faith is going to
[52:30] sit there and not take a hold of the
[52:32] word we're not going to we're not going
[52:34] to get from it what we can be getting
[52:35] from it see we've got to do our
[52:40] part and after she came trembling the
[52:43] Bible
[52:45] says Jesus said daughter be of good
[52:48] cheer thy faith have made thee whole now
[52:51] notice this he said thy faith he didn't
[52:56] say God's
[52:57] faith he had already dealt that to
[53:00] her you understand we all have faith yes
[53:05] it originated from God it is originated
[53:08] from God but he gave it to you amen and
[53:11] you got to claim it you got to use your
[53:15] faith and he said thy faith have made
[53:18] thee whole go in
[53:20] peace we've got to activate our our
[53:23] faith amen she activate the measure that
[53:26] God gave her and we've got to do it also
[53:29] there was a woman of Canaan she had a
[53:31] sick daughter we all know the story she
[53:33] came to Jesus crying have mercy on me oh
[53:36] Lord thou son of David my daughter is
[53:38] grievously vexed with the
[53:40] Devil the Bible says that he would not
[53:43] even answer her a
[53:46] word in fact his disciples said look you
[53:50] better just rebuke her and send her
[53:53] away trying to keep
[53:56] order
[53:58] finally Jesus told the woman look I am
[54:01] here to help
[54:03] only the people of Israel that's what he
[54:06] said that's I'm only here to help
[54:11] them you would have thought that would
[54:13] have been
[54:15] enough but that woman actually came
[54:18] closer to Jesus and start worshiping am
[54:21] said Lord help
[54:24] me but Jesus had to step up the Annie at
[54:27] the
[54:28] pulpit he said it is not meat to take
[54:31] the children's bread and cast it to
[54:34] dogs wow he he got a little stronger he
[54:38] got a little
[54:40] stronger and she agreed with the
[54:44] word she agreed what was being preached
[54:47] and she said truth Lord yet the dogs
[54:49] they eat of the crumbs which fall from
[54:51] the master's
[54:52] table and Jesus said unto her oh woman
[54:56] great is thy
[54:59] faith great is thy faith be it unto thee
[55:03] even as thou
[55:06] Wilt she activated the faith that was
[55:09] inside of her she would not be
[55:11] discouraged
[55:15] amen she held her
[55:19] confidence she had absolute Assurance of
[55:23] God and I believe that's what God was
[55:25] seen when he said great is thy
[55:27] faith you know a lot of times we'll
[55:29] start out to believe something but we
[55:31] get a little hurt or a little offended
[55:33] that we stop
[55:34] believing look this is a perfect example
[55:37] for the Bride of Jesus Christ we will
[55:39] not take a
[55:40] backseat we will take God no matter what
[55:43] we're called what we
[55:46] are absolute Assurance of God he's taken
[55:49] me
[55:52] through she would not be sh shaken I
[55:56] think that would shake some people in
[55:59] this message
[56:00] today instead of just you're right
[56:04] that's that's what I am it's like who
[56:07] are you to tell me that who are
[56:11] you you the very fact that you're saying
[56:14] that you're denying who even spoke to
[56:17] you all right Hebrews chapter 12 verse
[56:20] 26 don't you think we're in a a shaking
[56:23] time in the world right now I just
[56:25] is not exactly the subject but I I just
[56:28] want you to know how important faith is
[56:30] Hebrews 12:26 now God has promised
[56:33] saying yet once more I shake not the
[56:35] Earth only but also heaven right amen
[56:39] think of all the things that are
[56:40] happening in the world the devil's
[56:42] really messing things up but you know
[56:43] God's allowing
[56:45] it and this word yet once more
[56:48] signifying the removing of those things
[56:50] that are shaken as of the things which
[56:52] are made that the things which cannot be
[56:56] shaken May remain amen well this woman
[57:00] remained she couldn't be
[57:05] shaken because faith comes from God it
[57:08] is not
[57:10] man-made the faith that you hold inside
[57:12] of you it's it's God's
[57:16] faith in other words that faith is so
[57:20] powerful that it
[57:21] created the world and he gave you a med
[57:25] of
[57:26] it you should just tell the devil I will
[57:29] not be
[57:30] moved I will not be
[57:32] shaken I'm holding to God's unchanging
[57:35] hand wherefore we receiving a kingdom
[57:39] which cannot be moved let us have Grace
[57:42] whereby we may serve God
[57:46] acceptably with reverence and godly
[57:51] fear you know it takes a right spirit to
[57:55] know how to serve god with reverence and
[57:58] godly fear for our God is a consuming
[58:02] fire if he wants to shake the whole
[58:04] world if he wants to do what he's doing
[58:06] if he every time you turn on the news
[58:07] there's threats coming from North Korea
[58:10] or from Russia from China you know they
[58:12] all got their target on who cares it's
[58:15] going to
[58:16] happen the thing is the devil can't take
[58:19] what God gave inside of
[58:22] me yes the world's going to blow up yes
[58:25] it is and it is sad that our kids or our
[58:27] grandkids are maybe not going to see and
[58:30] and have a a a nice place as we did
[58:34] because the world's getting worse but
[58:36] I'll tell you the sooner we get out of
[58:37] here the sooner we get to
[58:40] Heaven There won't yeah I just let that
[58:43] go we're all going through tough
[58:46] situations at one time or another we go
[58:48] through them but God would never put
[58:51] anything on us that his grace would not
[58:54] be able to see us through amen and our
[58:57] faith in God will see us through amen
[59:00] but if we come up to that place just say
[59:03] oh yeah I am just a
[59:07] dog I'm not of Israel I'm not going to
[59:10] get this blessing I'm asking for it and
[59:13] you walk
[59:15] away you're you're the shoes the souls
[59:20] of your feet have not claimed that
[59:23] ground that's
[59:26] and no matter what your situation is you
[59:28] got to claim it that God is with you
[59:32] that God will see you through you have
[59:34] to have absolute Assurance of God in
[59:37] that
[59:38] situation now here's the thing I know
[59:41] that don't come
[59:42] easy sometimes you have to pray with
[59:45] desperation you have to call upon God
[59:48] you say God I got to hear from you today
[59:51] but that's okay that's what God wants
[59:52] you to do that's why he puts you you in
[59:54] those situations it's not bad and it's
[59:56] not
[59:59] wrong there's times we don't even get
[1:00:02] everything we
[1:00:04] want but we still have absolute
[1:00:07] assurance that God is in control and he
[1:00:09] gives us peace that passeth all
[1:00:12] understanding I want to spend just a
[1:00:13] couple minutes talking about the law of
[1:00:15] faith has anybody ever heard of
[1:00:17] that the law of
[1:00:20] faith if you never activate your faith
[1:00:23] it can never help you
[1:00:27] you cannot please God the Bible says
[1:00:29] whatsoever is not of faith is sin Romans
[1:00:33] 3 mentions the law of faith brother Ram
[1:00:36] talked about the law of faith in the
[1:00:38] message ever present water from the rock
[1:00:40] you want to read that sometime or listen
[1:00:42] to it but brother bam says and the power
[1:00:45] that will raise us up is right in us now
[1:00:49] right amen we're now in Heavenly places
[1:00:52] we are now in the power of the
[1:00:54] Resurrection if there wasn't a law to
[1:00:58] that Sons and Daughters of God would
[1:01:01] create them a world out there and go
[1:01:04] live a private life on it but there's a
[1:01:08] law says you have the power in you to do
[1:01:12] it if you've got a shadow of the power
[1:01:15] of God in you you've got power to do it
[1:01:18] God is omnipotent see what I mean the
[1:01:22] power that's in you you could speak a
[1:01:24] word world into existence and go live on
[1:01:26] it Hallelujah there you
[1:01:28] are brother Brandon must have got
[1:01:30] excited with
[1:01:34] that but you know there's a law
[1:01:37] there something is keeping us from going
[1:01:40] speaking the world into
[1:01:41] existence didn't brother bandam talk
[1:01:44] about power without character
[1:01:48] satanic the character is the will of God
[1:01:51] and that's honestly this is the first
[1:01:53] thing that we need to understand about
[1:01:55] the law of faith faith comes from God
[1:01:58] not us
[1:01:59] am it's it's got to be God's will amen
[1:02:04] and the second thing is we must Unite
[1:02:07] with what God
[1:02:09] Said faith comes from God but it goes
[1:02:12] through a free more agency and it has to
[1:02:15] come out the other side with an
[1:02:17] agreement with
[1:02:18] God not a yeah it's it's God's word I
[1:02:22] know it's true and you know that's what
[1:02:24] brother BR said that's what they preach
[1:02:26] and yeah I've heard it for so no You'
[1:02:28] got to have an absolute Assurance you're
[1:02:31] holding on to that with everything that
[1:02:33] you got in
[1:02:35] you remember how Jesus would say if thou
[1:02:38] can't believe there's that
[1:02:41] variable or he would say according to
[1:02:44] thy faith not according to me because I
[1:02:50] already wish above all things that you
[1:02:51] would prosper and be in
[1:02:53] hell
[1:02:55] I I want you to not have the devil uh
[1:02:59] putting chains of Doubt on you right we
[1:03:02] know God's will but we've got to unite
[1:03:04] with the word we got to we got to tell
[1:03:06] the devil to get behind us the Bible
[1:03:08] says submit yourself therefore to God
[1:03:10] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:03:12] you that's a promise of God you got to
[1:03:14] unite with that Amen brother Braham said
[1:03:18] faith is a direct
[1:03:22] Revelation boy we've heard you know
[1:03:24] faith is a revelation but he says here
[1:03:27] faith is a direct Revelation in other
[1:03:30] words God has something just for you
[1:03:33] amen just for you personally for you
[1:03:36] it's not for the person sitting next to
[1:03:38] you he's God's got a different
[1:03:40] Revelation for that person but for you
[1:03:43] he has something direct for
[1:03:45] you for years I
[1:03:48] quoted quoted a defined faith is when
[1:03:52] God speaks personally to us those of you
[1:03:56] that have been with us a long time know
[1:03:58] that to be true we've never changed that
[1:04:02] it's when God speaks to you
[1:04:06] directly and you Unite with what God
[1:04:09] said to you amen
[1:04:13] because God can speak to you directly
[1:04:16] and you don't Unite with
[1:04:19] him that's not
[1:04:22] Faith Peter had a direct re ation of who
[1:04:25] Jesus was and Jesus said for Flesh and
[1:04:28] Blood have not revealed it unto thee but
[1:04:30] my Father which is in heaven a direct
[1:04:33] Revelation for Peter and Jesus was
[1:04:36] asking who does who do other people say
[1:04:38] they had ideas from hearing people with
[1:04:42] knowledge and understanding because they
[1:04:45] were saying well he's probably you know
[1:04:47] maybe uh one of the prophets
[1:04:51] Elias uh Jeremiah I mean the these were
[1:04:55] people that were spiritual people
[1:04:57] spiritual believers they they they they
[1:04:59] understood the word and they their whole
[1:05:03] uh their their whole word was this has
[1:05:06] to be uh one of God's people but un but
[1:05:10] but but they didn't get a a direct
[1:05:12] Revelation from God it was their own
[1:05:16] concept well that won't take you through
[1:05:18] it will
[1:05:20] it you got to hear directly from God can
[1:05:24] you say amen amen all right Romans chap
[1:05:26] 10 verse
[1:05:29] 16 Romans 10:16 says but they have not
[1:05:33] all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith
[1:05:37] Lord who have believed our
[1:05:40] report they all went to church but who
[1:05:42] believed it they all heard it but who
[1:05:44] believed it so then Faith cometh by
[1:05:48] hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:05:52] God Jesus said my word words are spirit
[1:05:54] and they are life amen we can hear the
[1:05:58] word of God being
[1:06:01] preached but if all you're doing is
[1:06:03] hearing the word of God being preached
[1:06:05] by a man it's not personal to
[1:06:07] you how is that going to give you Faith
[1:06:10] how is that going to build your
[1:06:12] faith you've got to hear it personally
[1:06:14] from God even though it's coming out of
[1:06:16] a human
[1:06:18] being it's God using that human being to
[1:06:21] speak to your heart personally then it
[1:06:23] becomes real to
[1:06:26] You Verse 18 but I
[1:06:29] say have they not
[1:06:32] heard yes verily their sound went into
[1:06:35] all the earth and the word and their
[1:06:38] words unto the ends of the world
[1:06:41] everyone is going to have a chance
[1:06:43] everyone has a chance to hear the voice
[1:06:44] of God Amen if not then they how could
[1:06:48] God judge
[1:06:49] him
[1:06:51] right so everybody's going to have a
[1:06:53] chance
[1:06:55] amen and we believe that we have an
[1:06:58] opportunity right here to build
[1:07:00] ourselves up in the Most Holy Faith
[1:07:03] every time we hear the word of God being
[1:07:05] preached we're so close to him so tight
[1:07:08] with him so in tune with him we don't
[1:07:10] care what John's wearing we don't care
[1:07:13] if he's Whispering we don't care if he's
[1:07:14] yell we don't care if he's going from
[1:07:16] this end to that end we are so locked
[1:07:18] into the word of God that we're hearing
[1:07:19] the voice of God speak to
[1:07:21] us and we do that by keeping
[1:07:24] ourselves the Bible says in the love of
[1:07:27] God be so in love with him you're here
[1:07:31] because you're in love with him amen
[1:07:33] just want to have his word now I'll tell
[1:07:35] you the Bible says in Jude 1 uh verse 20
[1:07:39] but ye beloved building up yourselves on
[1:07:42] what your Most Holy Faith
[1:07:46] yours building yourself up on your Most
[1:07:49] Holy Faith you can't rely how many times
[1:07:52] we hear the prophet say you can't you
[1:07:54] can't make it on somebody else's shirt
[1:07:55] tail you've got to have your own praying
[1:07:59] now notice this praying in the Holy
[1:08:03] Ghost so when you're praying and you
[1:08:06] haven't reached that
[1:08:08] place I just say keep praying going keep
[1:08:11] going yes keep going keep yourselves in
[1:08:15] the love of God looking for the mercy of
[1:08:18] our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life
[1:08:21] that is the right Spirit I'll tell you
[1:08:23] if I if I get eternal life I'm saying
[1:08:25] like that it'll be the mercy of God yes
[1:08:29] I don't deserve
[1:08:30] it I'm looking I'm looking to
[1:08:35] it looking for the mercy of our Lord
[1:08:37] Jesus Christ and to etern life but
[1:08:40] notice just hearing the voice of God is
[1:08:43] Not Enough we got to unite with it let's
[1:08:45] take Jonah for example Jonah heard the
[1:08:48] voice of the Lord but he didn't activate
[1:08:51] his faith that was given to him he
[1:08:53] didn't Unite with the word he didn't say
[1:08:57] yes Lord no he ran the other way
[1:09:00] right so he didn't have
[1:09:03] faith even though God spoke to him I'm
[1:09:07] trying to show the importance of how
[1:09:08] important it is for you to really Unite
[1:09:11] with the words you know some so many
[1:09:13] people just go to church and they feel
[1:09:14] so great that they went to church I did
[1:09:17] my part I went to church I feel
[1:09:20] better but look God wants us to unite
[1:09:23] with the world
[1:09:26] right Cain he heard the voice of the
[1:09:29] Lord but he never United with what God
[1:09:34] said he didn't have
[1:09:36] faith and it didn't please God
[1:09:39] either balum he heard the voice of the
[1:09:41] Lord but he didn't Unite with it he had
[1:09:44] a different agenda he he had a an
[1:09:47] interest for personal gain yes but he
[1:09:50] heard the voice of the Lord the Rich
[1:09:52] Young Ruler he heard the voice of the
[1:09:53] Lord Lord but he didn't Unite with what
[1:09:56] God told him to
[1:09:58] do so he didn't have faith so it's not
[1:10:03] just hearing God speak to you it's when
[1:10:06] you say yes Lord I accept that I believe
[1:10:10] it then that becomes faith faith is
[1:10:13] activated I'll tell you it will bring to
[1:10:16] pass the thing that you're looking for
[1:10:18] because God spoke
[1:10:21] it look at Pharaoh he heard the voice of
[1:10:24] the
[1:10:24] Lord he
[1:10:27] did it wasn't directly from God it was
[1:10:30] through a prophet but he heard and if he
[1:10:32] would have obeyed everything would have
[1:10:34] been
[1:10:36] okay but he never United with what God
[1:10:42] Said So hearing from God is essential
[1:10:46] because without hearing from God we're
[1:10:48] not going to get Faith Faith cometh by
[1:10:49] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[1:10:54] but uniting with what God Said is just
[1:10:58] as
[1:10:59] essential if you don't Unite with it if
[1:11:02] you don't say I in this word that he has
[1:11:05] spoken to me have become
[1:11:07] one it won't profit us
[1:11:11] anything but they have not all obeyed
[1:11:16] the gospel see they heard the report but
[1:11:19] they didn't obey it so it wasn't Faith
[1:11:22] to them true belief of God's report is
[1:11:25] when you accept the word enough to that
[1:11:29] you obey whatever he tells you to
[1:11:31] do and sometimes he
[1:11:34] doesn't sometimes he doesn't say well
[1:11:37] you got to go do this sometimes he just
[1:11:40] wants to see if you're going to hold
[1:11:42] there when the Devil comes knocking on
[1:11:43] your door are you going to O are you
[1:11:46] going to obey and hold to that
[1:11:49] word turn with me if you would to
[1:11:52] Hebrews chapter 4
[1:11:55] for Faith to be activated the voice of
[1:11:57] God must go through free more agency and
[1:12:00] be United you must Unite with what God
[1:12:05] Said through Freemore
[1:12:08] agency this is so critical because I
[1:12:10] think a lot of times you know we want
[1:12:12] God to give us Faith but we're unwilling
[1:12:14] to unite with the
[1:12:17] word or we're just going to you know see
[1:12:22] something in the scriptures oh it'd be
[1:12:24] nice to have that but we don't
[1:12:27] even we don't fall in love with God in
[1:12:30] that word and say God I want to be that
[1:12:31] I want you if that's what you have for
[1:12:33] me God that's what I accept you know
[1:12:36] we've got to build the relationship for
[1:12:38] Faith to to be real for our lives we're
[1:12:41] not of those that
[1:12:45] just we're we're we want to build a
[1:12:48] relationship to make a Rapture that's
[1:12:49] what we're looking for I mean there's
[1:12:51] churches out there that are just full of
[1:12:53] um signs and wonders and and um they're
[1:12:58] believing for this and that is
[1:13:00] wonderful but look I want Faith to take
[1:13:03] me through that's what I need I could
[1:13:06] get healed of whatever I'm sick of I'm
[1:13:09] probably sick of a lot of things don't
[1:13:10] know yet but you know what I can get
[1:13:13] healed of every one of those things I
[1:13:15] still need Faith to take me through it's
[1:13:18] more important all right Hebrews 42 For
[1:13:22] unto us was the Gospel preached as well
[1:13:27] as unto
[1:13:28] them but the word preached did not
[1:13:31] profit
[1:13:32] them not being mixed with faith in them
[1:13:36] that heard
[1:13:38] it so they heard the
[1:13:41] word but they didn't mix it with faith
[1:13:45] they didn't mix it with that is for me
[1:13:48] that is for me Joshua and Caleb had
[1:13:51] it but there was what
[1:13:53] 1.88 million that didn't have
[1:13:57] it I'll tell you they had another
[1:14:01] Spirit that's the spirit I want amen
[1:14:05] that's the spirit I
[1:14:07] want we've got to unite with what God is
[1:14:10] saying that's why it's important know
[1:14:12] brother brother brandham said that the
[1:14:15] Holy Ghost says Amen to every word of
[1:14:18] God there's a uniting there going
[1:14:22] on and you know a lot of times God will
[1:14:24] speak to us
[1:14:26] something that we don't
[1:14:28] want okay like um I want you to do this
[1:14:33] I don't want to do that
[1:14:35] see you just let it
[1:14:37] go you need to do this I want you to do
[1:14:40] this I want you to I want you to go here
[1:14:44] turn there do this I want you to pray I
[1:14:47] want you to call I want you to reach I
[1:14:49] want
[1:14:52] and don't got time don't feel like it
[1:14:54] don't believe in it you know God's going
[1:14:56] to have to if it's really God he's going
[1:14:57] to have to tell me in a different way
[1:14:58] because I don't believe in this stuff
[1:15:00] think about it the Holy Ghost is sent to
[1:15:02] lead and guide us into all truth I am
[1:15:04] telling you here today we are not living
[1:15:06] in all the
[1:15:08] truth so I can expect God to lead me
[1:15:11] into more truth amen so he's going to
[1:15:14] speak things to me that I don't accept
[1:15:16] that I don't agree with that doesn't
[1:15:18] make sense to my understanding but yet
[1:15:21] it's still the voice of God Amen but if
[1:15:23] we're not in love with him if we're not
[1:15:25] willing to to lay down our lives and do
[1:15:28] what he's asked us to do we'll miss it
[1:15:30] we'll never have faith for the
[1:15:36] word Joshua and Caleb had absolute
[1:15:39] Assurance of
[1:15:41] God they really did they went how many
[1:15:44] years 40
[1:15:46] years they didn't change their
[1:15:49] testimony in fact they were just as
[1:15:51] strong at the end as they they were at
[1:15:53] the beginning that's absolute you know a
[1:15:55] lot of times we get on well I think you
[1:15:57] know God told me this and two weeks
[1:16:01] later and we're thinking that's Faith
[1:16:03] that's not faith that was hope faith is
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:10] different faith is you could be told by
[1:16:13] everybody in the world they're not
[1:16:15] standing with you but you heard from God
[1:16:18] and you're standing on it that's what
[1:16:20] faith is now look we cannot just expect
[1:16:23] God to give that to
[1:16:25] us with any old kind of
[1:16:28] attitude we got to Humble ourselves
[1:16:30] before he gives more grace to the
[1:16:32] humble so we got to get in a place where
[1:16:35] we're seeking him more we're calling on
[1:16:37] God we're putting forth the effort God I
[1:16:39] want this thing to be personal I want to
[1:16:41] make it personal I I mean yes this is my
[1:16:44] home Church yes this is my pastor yes
[1:16:47] this is this is what a fine family but
[1:16:49] you know we need a personalness with God
[1:16:52] Amen so it's got to go beyond those
[1:16:57] things in order for God to move in our
[1:17:02] behalf his word spoken to us personally
[1:17:05] must go through freeo
[1:17:08] agency and we think it does but it
[1:17:10] doesn't just think of all the times God
[1:17:13] asked you to do
[1:17:14] something and you didn't do
[1:17:17] it it doesn't easily go through there
[1:17:20] even though we love God even though
[1:17:22] we're saved
[1:17:23] you know we got this cockabur nature
[1:17:25] that just there's a reason Jesus said
[1:17:28] Die daily it requires that we hey just
[1:17:33] die once a week and you'll be good for
[1:17:34] the
[1:17:35] week right you you that take pills you
[1:17:39] got to take them every day don't you
[1:17:40] wish you just take them once be done you
[1:17:43] know for a week or
[1:17:45] something but you know we got to Die
[1:17:48] daily we need to activate our faith
[1:17:52] faith is is important the just shall
[1:17:56] live by
[1:17:58] faith all right I promised shook hands
[1:18:04] with brother
[1:18:05] Mike got to make sure that this doesn't
[1:18:08] go one minute
[1:18:11] over he was just teasing me but we're
[1:18:13] doing good just so you know brother
[1:18:16] bandam said in the message Moses he says
[1:18:18] now
[1:18:19] remember if you can think maybe there's
[1:18:22] just some of it you don't understand
[1:18:26] how's got things in their life you just
[1:18:28] don't understand we all got them and
[1:18:31] I'll tell you when you get understanding
[1:18:32] for a couple of them there's going to be
[1:18:34] more that you don't understand it's just
[1:18:36] the way life
[1:18:38] is he says brother BR says frankly
[1:18:41] friends there's much of it that I do not
[1:18:46] understand I just accept it don't never
[1:18:50] try to figure God out
[1:18:54] says you can't do it God is not
[1:18:57] understood by
[1:18:59] knowledge God is understood by
[1:19:02] faith it's a trust I you know what I
[1:19:05] find there's so much more peace if I can
[1:19:08] just trust him
[1:19:10] amen because the more you try to figure
[1:19:12] out something the more confused you
[1:19:15] get the more you feel so condemned so
[1:19:20] hopeless so there's no help in the
[1:19:23] situation but if you can trust God just
[1:19:27] believe we'll understand it better by
[1:19:30] and
[1:19:30] by in the message led by the spirit
[1:19:33] brother B says only
[1:19:35] faith is the only thing can help you
[1:19:40] tonight is isn't that right he says then
[1:19:43] why don't you believe God's word only
[1:19:47] faith can help you no matter no ma no
[1:19:49] wonder the angel told Brother bam
[1:19:53] I like that song only
[1:19:55] believe that's all we got to do is only
[1:19:58] believe activate your faith with
[1:20:02] absolute Assurance of God activate your
[1:20:06] faith by only
[1:20:09] believing only
[1:20:11] believing to sing the song it's
[1:20:14] easy to only believe the word is hard
[1:20:18] because the devil is there in your mind
[1:20:22] thrown thoughts
[1:20:27] reasons and you've got to resist those
[1:20:29] things and just say get behind me Satan
[1:20:32] I'm I'm standing on the word of God
[1:20:35] today so let's get desperate to hear
[1:20:38] God's voice amen hey let's get
[1:20:42] desperate this is the only way that
[1:20:44] we'll be to activate our faith in God's
[1:20:47] word spend more time in
[1:20:51] prayer spend more more time preparing
[1:20:53] for
[1:20:56] service come early in
[1:21:00] prayer when you come into God's
[1:21:02] Sanctuary be prepared to enter his Gates
[1:21:05] properly amen amen you too often I don't
[1:21:09] think we enter the gates properly we
[1:21:11] just come in we say we're here we
[1:21:13] entered we walk through the door that's
[1:21:14] naturally spiritually he
[1:21:17] demands he demands
[1:21:21] praise he demand man's a thankful heart
[1:21:25] enter his gates with Thanksgiving enter
[1:21:26] his courts with praise there's got to be
[1:21:29] a a thankfulness there now look God
[1:21:34] demands it he expects
[1:21:37] it brother bam talked about how if
[1:21:40] you're going to go see uh the Pope that
[1:21:44] you had to do these different things to
[1:21:46] approach him remember
[1:21:48] that okay we got some and you have to
[1:21:51] walk backwards you have to do this and I
[1:21:54] don't remember all the things but one of
[1:21:55] them he had to he he did them all and he
[1:21:57] got to the end where he had to like get
[1:21:59] on his knee and
[1:22:02] kisses and he said I won't do
[1:22:05] that but he had
[1:22:09] a in order to see the pope you had to do
[1:22:12] these
[1:22:13] things and many people do that presence
[1:22:17] people would do that yeah here's the
[1:22:20] thing if you really want to get into
[1:22:22] into God's presence start entering him
[1:22:24] his Gates
[1:22:26] properly give them your best when you
[1:22:28] come
[1:22:29] in yes I don't it doesn't matter if you
[1:22:31] had a bad
[1:22:32] day bad day has nothing to do with
[1:22:35] giving God what he deserves because when
[1:22:37] you enter the gates properly God has
[1:22:40] something special for you I believe
[1:22:42] that when you read God's word listen for
[1:22:47] God to speak to you about your life amen
[1:22:51] God wants to speak speak something to
[1:22:53] you about your
[1:22:55] life and what it is it's God's will for
[1:22:58] your
[1:22:58] life a lot of times we have a whole list
[1:23:01] of things that we want God to take care
[1:23:04] of it's true we
[1:23:08] do but what is the will of God for those
[1:23:10] things amen we can't just assume because
[1:23:15] this is what I desire every time and
[1:23:16] just tell God you give me the desires of
[1:23:18] my
[1:23:19] heart I mean it my heart's deceitful I
[1:23:22] already know that I don't want to keep
[1:23:25] learning that
[1:23:27] one
[1:23:29] so God's desire for me may be different
[1:23:33] than mine when you listen to the message
[1:23:35] Listen for God's will for your life Lord
[1:23:38] what would there's something in here
[1:23:40] that you want me to become some some
[1:23:44] some some nature that I'm not developing
[1:23:47] that you want me to do something you
[1:23:48] want me to start doing see that's the
[1:23:51] right attitude ude you don't want to I
[1:23:53] want to get this knowledge and I want to
[1:23:55] learn about this no I want to learn how
[1:23:58] I can please
[1:24:01] him now a person's Faith creates the
[1:24:04] atmosphere for God to come and do the
[1:24:07] impossible and this is why it's
[1:24:08] important to build your faith brother
[1:24:11] Ram said in the message it wasn't sold
[1:24:13] from the beginning he said people create
[1:24:15] an atmosphere by the way they live amen
[1:24:20] whoa you mean I can go home and create
[1:24:23] an
[1:24:25] atmosphere and my
[1:24:29] home that God will come and do the
[1:24:35] impossible I don't have to be in
[1:24:37] church and be in front of
[1:24:40] people we create an atmosphere it's in
[1:24:43] our it's our in our mind right the right
[1:24:45] mental attitude we we create an
[1:24:48] atmosphere where God will come and Grant
[1:24:51] the promise that we're looking
[1:24:54] for most of us have heard that faith is
[1:24:56] a revelation brother B said in the
[1:24:59] message anointed ones at the other time
[1:25:01] he say he said faith is a revelation of
[1:25:05] the will of
[1:25:06] God
[1:25:09] whoa whoa this is this is getting
[1:25:15] personal not just about knowledge of all
[1:25:18] these things but it's the the will of
[1:25:21] God that's why it's important to unite
[1:25:24] with what God is saying learn to be
[1:25:26] faithful with the things that are are
[1:25:29] small things that are little in your
[1:25:31] life things small things that God has
[1:25:33] asked you to do do them because if you
[1:25:36] can do the little things then God will
[1:25:38] give you Faith to do the bigger things
[1:25:40] but sometimes we look at our life as
[1:25:42] there's so many needs and I don't know
[1:25:44] where to start and I've got so many
[1:25:45] problems and I just don't know you know
[1:25:47] if God's going to you know just be
[1:25:48] faithful to what you could be faithful
[1:25:50] with amen and and and
[1:25:54] build let's stand together brother
[1:25:57] Brandon said in the message of Victory
[1:25:59] is a uh faith is our Victory he said
[1:26:03] faith is a
[1:26:07] conqueror faith is an
[1:26:11] overcomer we need
[1:26:13] [Music]
[1:26:14] faith we need Faith to conquer we need
[1:26:17] Faith to overcome
[1:26:21] amen look a lot of times we're facing a
[1:26:25] a devil
[1:26:28] who's just
[1:26:30] ruthless doesn't care I think about this
[1:26:35] woman whose daughter was grievously
[1:26:37] vexed and even
[1:26:39] Jesus was coming against
[1:26:43] her look God's on our
[1:26:47] side we got him on our side we should be
[1:26:50] able to overcome come the
[1:26:53] devil I want to leave you this last
[1:26:55] verse it's 1 John
[1:26:57] 5:4 and I didn't have you write it but
[1:27:00] if you want to put it up there that's up
[1:27:01] to you it says for whatsoever is born of
[1:27:04] God overcometh the
[1:27:05] world and this is the victory that
[1:27:09] overcometh the world even our
[1:27:13] faith not God's faith the one that he's
[1:27:18] already given you he's given you
[1:27:20] everything you need
[1:27:22] to
[1:27:24] overcome brother brenon makes a solid
[1:27:26] statement that that that power is in you
[1:27:29] that you could create a world and go
[1:27:30] live on it you surely got power to tell
[1:27:31] the devil to get behind you Amen to stop
[1:27:35] listening to the devil to start becoming
[1:27:38] more serious with the word of God do you
[1:27:40] believe
[1:27:41] that amen let's look to the Lord in a
[1:27:44] word of
[1:27:49] prayer Heavenly Father we come to you
[1:27:53] this evening thanking
[1:27:55] you for the faith that you have given us
[1:27:59] we certainly don't deserve the measure
[1:28:01] of faith that you've given us but Lord
[1:28:04] we can question
[1:28:05] ourself we might better to question
[1:28:11] others but Lord you said you gave Every
[1:28:13] Man a Measure of Faith what we do with
[1:28:15] it is up to us some despise it get to a
[1:28:21] place that they don't have faith
[1:28:24] anymore some build themsel up in that
[1:28:28] Most Holy
[1:28:30] Faith Lord your Prophet came and he gave
[1:28:33] us a message on perfect faith and how we
[1:28:36] needed perfect Faith to make a
[1:28:41] Rapture Lord I pray here for every
[1:28:43] brother every
[1:28:45] sister those that perhaps are watching
[1:28:47] and saying God I want this for my
[1:28:51] life
[1:28:54] I pray that you would give them the
[1:28:59] assurance that as they put one step
[1:29:03] forward towards you and your word and
[1:29:07] what you have spoken to them just to
[1:29:10] obey
[1:29:13] that Lord that you
[1:29:18] increase their relationship with you
[1:29:23] make it so strong Lord that when the
[1:29:27] devil would
[1:29:29] come and hiss some lie that the faith
[1:29:33] inside of them would be so strong that
[1:29:36] they could just resist that devil rebuke
[1:29:40] that
[1:29:41] devil and command the enemy what to
[1:29:47] do Lord I pray that you'd help us in our
[1:29:50] endeavors Lord to activate the faith
[1:29:52] that you've given us whether we be in
[1:29:55] our homes or
[1:29:59] workplaces whether we be here in
[1:30:02] church Lord May the faith be activated
[1:30:06] in every one of us that our church would
[1:30:09] grow in
[1:30:11] faith that we could see you do the
[1:30:15] things Lord that you desire to do
[1:30:17] amongst
[1:30:18] us Lord we never want chains of to
[1:30:22] hinder
[1:30:24] you Lord we we want to be free from
[1:30:28] that so I pray let this word that was
[1:30:31] spoken today by you Lord let it find a
[1:30:35] place of Refuge in every one of us help
