pray with faith and Thanksgiving amen amen God bless you and uh we greet you all in in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and it's always a privilege to be in the house of the Lord and with the people of God and so I bring greetings to you from my wife and my family my pastor and uh Jeff snra but Jeff sent message this morning said wherever you go greet the Breen for us so we greet we bring greet to you Believers from other believers am we are happy to be in the house of the Lord amen it is always a privilege before we see down let's read a portion of the scriptures I want to thank the pastor brother John uh for giving me another opportunity to be here and to share fellowship with the Breen we are looking forward to when we cross over there amen there would not be more we will not be partying over there and uh we shall see Jesus our lord and we shall be with him that is all that our labor here is for preparing to meet him what a day it will be to see him to meet him when uh partial realization will become perfect realization our dreams will be fulfilled all that we have been dreaming longing is Jesus for the day that would be may God give us Grace that will continue to press on until that day comes amen let's read from the gospel of St John chapter 6 and then we'll go to the book of Hebrews to Hebrews chapter 11 to read some few things from there St John chapter 6 John chapter 6 let us read from verse 38 for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the father's will which have sent me that of all which he have given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of Fame that sent me that everyone would see Heth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day amen amen let's read from Hebrews chapter 11 Hebrews 11 verse 5 6 5 and six by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him may the Lord bless the reading of his word amen let us please be seated so once again we give thanks to the king for sparing Our Lives to see another day amen and uh as we know every passing Day brings the kingdom of God coming of the Lord closer so we are already the year is already half we've closed the uh first quarter I mean first half in this uh second uh we just started the second one which is almost the seventh month is about to End Amen so we are very close to the coming of the Lord amen but then the question also should be to us how close have we come personally amen Every personing Day brings the coming of the Lord closer so every passing day should bring everyone one of us closer to his coming so when we look at ourselves and examine Our Lives how closer have we come how closer are we to his coming as individuals how how much are we prepared how prepared are we because every day brings is coming closer so every day should bring us closer so have we been brought closer have you been brought closer may the Lord help us but that is what we come to church for that's what we hear the word of God for to be brought brought closer to get closer to him reading the Bible singing his Praises worshiping all that we are doing is to be brought brought closer to him am amen may the Lord help us amen so that we will not just be coming and going or just be talking about the coming of the Lord and don't prepare for his coming the scripture told us that Noah moved with fear when he was told he received the message and he was told what to do God revealed to him this is what I'm going to do the end of all All Flesh has come to me this is what I'm going to do but you do this and the scripture tell told us that he moved with fear to prepare himself amen so if we know the Lord is coming and we know the Lord is coming and we don't prepare because he is coming not to ways about and he will be here because we have seen the signs that he promised us right and the things all that we see around signifies and shows us that indeed he's coming and his coming is drawing closer every day may the Lord help us so that you and I will not just oh the Lord is coming the Lord is coming the Lord is coming because the scripture portion of the scripture tells us the servant that knows the will of the master he doesn't do it the master will come and he will be unprepared for that day he said the the Lord of that servant will come and they will be found unprepared so may the Lord help us yesen this morning just to encourage ourselves we speaking on pleasing the father pleasing the Lord by faith Enoch before his translation the Bible said he had this testimony that he pleased the Lord Enoch before his translation the Bible say he walked with God and he was not for God took him and he had a testimony that he pleased God God in his life and we also as we speak about the coming of the Lord the seventh Church age the people that have been called out of this age and we are preparing and looking for changing of our bodies amen as Enoch was translated as he was taken away and he had a testimony so you and I today in everything that we do that we will please the Lord our lord Jesus said I came not from Heaven to do my own will right amen but I came to do the will of him that sent me amen this is very strong for me Emmanuel was made flesh Jehovah was made flesh and when he came here said look I I came not to do my own will he told us in the scripture looks he was speaking to this disciples and he was said for your sakes I sanctify myself he deprived himself he said I sanctify myself for your sakes may God help us that he didn't live for himself he lived and died for us and brother Braham told us Christianity is not living for ourselves right Christianity is living for others even he said to live for the one that if he gets you will kill you I didn't say he said so to live for the one that is against you right amen amen to live for somebody that if he get an opportunity to kill you will kill you am that's very strong but that's what the scripture tells us that's what Jesus told us that's why it said if your enemy is hungry giving food to eat if is thiry giving water to drink he said for in so doing because he how can I give my enemy water and give him food but he also told us in so doing if you are doing this you are rather hipping cuse of fire on that man's head so human mind cannot understand this and this flesh will not take it amen but it has to be God in us to do it amen may the Lord help us amen not to live for ourselves and remember our lord Jesus our savior is more interested in our character than our comfort is more interested in our character than our comfort we all want Comfort but he's more interested in our character because he told us with that character we cannot reign with him amen and he told us that H power with that character is satanic it's of the devil and he told us that no man will share his strong with him except character and he told us that a character is never made without suffering and the suffering comes because the Bible tells us his own character was molded through suffering that comes by obedience to the word of God so obedience to this word of God will make this one to suffer because everyone want to have our own way brother Brown told us our greatest enemy is this one here this one don't want suffering this one will want to have his way so brother Braham said if I can overcome that Willam Bram this fresh if I can overcome him he said because that is my greatest enemy and that is every one of us our greatest enemy amen praise the Lord when I said praise the Lord I didn't say praise Timothy I said praise the Lord so we respond to it hallel Hallelujah yeah yeah we are here together amen so we say praise say yeah amen amen amen be so be let it be the Lord has to be praised amen the Lord must be worshiped the Lord must be glorify amen oh somebody to shout hosana to the king somebody to worship the Living God for that is what we were created for he created us to worship him not to worship ourselves but to worship the Living God to bless the name of the Living God to shout hosana to the Living God to glorify the name of the Living God your savior your healer your deliverer your comforter your way your life your everything is to worship Him Hallelujah for our breath everything comes from him so we should be happy we should worship him we should lose up when we are in the house of the Lord Brother when they go to their ball games they don't see them as quiet or flowers or whatever whatever they got into the spirit amen and they shout and they sing and sometime even before people come for the soccer of whatever game the supporters already singing and shouting some upon all they singing and shouting they will lose anyhow but we we are not losing amen we are not losing we are not losing our captain has won for us already the B has been W for us the victory has been W for us we have been declared winners for the scripture says we are more than conquerors you are more than a conqueror so how can a conqueror sit down like you are sitting down today praise you Jesus praise the Lord you are conqueror you are victorious Hallelujah no wonder brother Bram said one time he was wondering why people are dancing and jumping and then the scripture came to him he said if you ever had Victory yes you will worship the Lord you praise the Lord you will sing the Praises of God and he said yes and I remember when they had the Victory and they crossed the Red Sea and Miriam took the tambourine and everybody behind her and everybody was celebrating and everybody was rejoicing because victory has been won David dance before the Ark of the Lord David Worship the Lord oh he said Worship the Lord he said praise the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me praise His holy name

Praise Him here you can worship him because this place has been dedicated to the worship of the almighty God hallelujah yeah sometimes I said man what is wrong with us man we have to worship him I'm telling you he's worthy of worship he's worthy of our Praises amen no wonder when David was dancing before the ark and jumping and dancing and then his wife what did you do that for you were jumping and you were dancing and and your rope fell off and they say you know what I was dancing before the god that chose me to be king above your father I know whom I believe I know whom I believe and I'm

sin he needs us so that the light of the Gospel will sine through US am that we hold that name that flag oh Hallelujah stand up for Jesus he soldiers of the Cross amen I remember a story one time in the about one of the Israeli soldiers and I think whether Israel they call him and uh in one of the awards he was wounded badly and they had to how many he was in a tank and was fired and he says 60% of his body was bent bent they have to do so many surgery on his body and then I think just after then I think 73 war came he was might be in the 63 war and then 73 the young Kon war came in and uh he went back to the Army he say he has to change something on his paper and F said and he went back into the army and he was inter why did you do that he said when I was young my father told me the flag of Israel is in my hands I should not let it go so in that hour when they were facing the syrians at that time on the Goan Heights and the syrians were coming with their tanks hundreds of Syrian tanks and he said he was left with Israel had about seven tanks or eight tanks and he was trying to get his but let's go he said nobody was going he said let's go so it that he he called from the command he spoke to the command house or whatever they call it they say and they said how many T are you left because they were calling for Air Force they had to for support and he said how many T do you have he said 40 he said about the seven he said I call 40 so that maybe if our enemies were able to decode it they would know that we still said but they were left with seven and nobody the rest of the armies the rest of the trunks was were not ready to go and instead he said I pray he said Lord help me if I can get to the other side I will make it and he move his tongue that's kalahan I think they call him and he begin to move his tongue and he was fire just bombing just throwing fire fire until fear caught hold on the syrians yes when he started moving the rest of the army be to move after him and they were firing and he said God put fear upon the syrians and they begin to run they were just running away from those seven men coming my brothers and my sisters may God help us oh stand for what you believe amen stand for Jesus he will make a way he will make a way he's our captain amen amen you can only pleas him by faith amen and then he told us faith without works is dead he said as this body without life is nothing is dead without the spirit is dead the same way faith without work is dead so our faith must go into action he said our action shows what we are right and if we say we have faith and then afraid to step out and claim our faith and put put it at work then our faith doesn't do us much good amen the bible say that faith without works is dead just as the body without the spirit is dead so is faith without that works we must believe him and as we believe we must act on our confession yeah yes as we believe we must act on our confession and the prophet of God said God will make our body obey our confession I came not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and we should know and remember we are not here to do our own will right but we are here to do things that pleases him yes as you look at yourself today our Bel our Behavior our worship our is he pleasing to the Lord the way I'm doing as a husband as a father as a mother as a Believer is that pleasing to the Lord Brother Bram said the greatest pleasure that the believer is knowing that he is living or doing something that pleases the Lord amen that should be our greatest pleasure to know that we are living or we are doing something that pleases the Lord God want his children to please him hey every one of us here we want our children to please us amen your wife husband oh yeah amen what about our father in Heaven amen he want our we want our children to please us oh people do do yeah yeah and you happy our heavenly father want us to please him yes so we want to please him to cause displeasure to this one here in pleasing Our Father this one will be displeased because there is a way that this man want to go there are things that this man want to do I'm talking about this flesh there are things that this flesh want to do but he said we have to submit the flesh to the spirit work in the spirit that you will not fulfill the desires and the loss of the flesh for the spirit and the flesh the are always at War so we must die to this one and be alive unto Christ may God help us God wants to be pleased that's why when our Lord is he came here Emmanuel he pleased the word it is written on of me I came not to do my own way so this flesh was brought under this word he submitted himself to the will of the father it has been written he said it is written of me it is written of me so though he was God he thought it not rly to be equal with God but humble himself and made made himself of no reputation yes he did it he made himself he did it he made himself of no reputation he laid everything down that's why said for their sake I sanctify myself brother Brandon said he could have married when he was here in the flesh there are many things he could have done as a man because he was 100 % man and 100% God but for your sake and my sake he submitted himself to the will of the father and he pleased the Father the bible say that go God spoke about said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to do it am he submitted himself and the father was pleased to dwell in him he said would it be wonderful that if every one of us come to that spot where the father will be pleased to dwell in US submitting to God's word to please the father not to please the flesh not to please ourselves he said the Sheep has one thing thing is wo and he submit himself to the sherff that's what Jesus did he submitted himself as a sheep before the sherff and he did not open his mouth they accuse him accuse him accuse him until even pilot Mar said don't you he what that they are saying all this you don't say anything he spoke and he told them don't you think in G man when they came to arrest him and he told Peter said put your sword back put it back oh they thought they were defending him he said that's not a way to defend me amen put your sword back amen don't fight anybody amen he said don't you think I can speak to my father right and he will send 12 Legions to come down now but how then will the scriptures be fulfilled the scriptures the word the prophecy the visions of the Lord that which has been spoken that which have been prophesied that he has come to know what he came on Earth to do because he said my will is to do my food is to to do the will of him that sent me am that of all that he has given me I should lose N I should keep all of them so he knew why he came and because he knew why he came that is why even Peter when he spoke that he was going to get Stoney and he spoke about what is going to be done to him how they will be denied how he will be persecuted how they will kill him and what Peter said no no no no don't say that don't we want you to stay here with us he said Dad behind me Satan am you don't know what you are talking about he knew why he came here so he did not allow his closest friend to interrupt it to stand on his way his friends he didn't allow them he did not even allow his parent uh Joseph and Mary when he was one day preaching and Joseph and Mary came said maybe the people have SP spoking so much about Jesus go and see what your son is doing go and see what he's preaching be beating people in church are we together yes they would have told him ah this boy is blaspheming do you know what he has done again he went to church with whip and he beat the people out of the church and he was kicking everything in the church so what kind of spirit is this yeah right yes sir and they would have gone to you better call your son and speak to your son because what he's doing is becoming too much now think about it it was not easy because even when he was being dedicated there was a prophecy said many arrows shall pierce your soul when Simon was dedicating it to you many arrows will pierce your soul because they will be speaking all kinds of things they will see all kinds of things oh god oh they will say all kinds of things are we together am I remember when we got this message and believe this message we young boys and oh preaching everywhere denominations of the devil and condemning this our parents suffer yeah look at what your children are doing look at what your son is doing they are saying this and that condemn even the pastors and the he said many arrows will pierce your soul so people come with complain people can't with complain people can't we and Mary they came and the brothers they came he Jesus was preaching they said call him for us they say Your mother your Breen are looking for you he said who who are my mothers who are my brother he said they those who do the will of God they are my parents he doesn't even respect his parents if you want to listen to people you can never serve God am you must know what you are here for you must know what you believe amen are we together if he had listen to people he will not will not have the Savior that we have today if he had pleased himself we would not have the Savior we have today we will not be where we are today amen but he said I came to do the will of him that sent me that's why I came from Heaven I Was Made flesh Emmanuel from God to mortality amen from immortality to mortality I came down from heaven not to do my own will amen whose will are we doing today who will are you doing as a wife as a mother as a husband as a father as a Christian whose will are we doing Hallelujah they not saying amen again woo this brother is very funny it's okay I got to do what I got to do you remember in one of the churches God was speaking to they say you have a few names in sad this th a few names even in sades which have not defied their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy this work in clean garments they are worthy they've not defiled their garments they have committed themselves you know they were not following the popular opinion in that day everybody is no no no no no he said these were watching how they work so that they will not be corrupted with the system of their days amen amen whose will are we doing today our own ways or who will right yes he wants [Music] obedience Our Father Abraham God spoke to him one time and God told him take your son go and sacrifice him God didn't explain to him God only said take your son that you love and go and sacrifice him after he has waited for so many years and God said now take him and go and sacrifice God didn't explain why he said it and you cannot get God to explain everything to you right why this is happening to me why this no God doesn't own us explanation God wants obedience am whether we understand or we don't understand did you think Abraham understood it he didn't God said take your son that your only son the one that you love and go and sacrifice him right it didn't explain to him and we want everything to be explained why must I give that why must I give off why must I do this why must I why why must I come to church early why must I do this and that keep keep asking yourself and satisfy yourself until they explain this to me I will not obey it okay go ahead God does not own any man an explanation and apology no you know one time the prophet prayed for a sister a young lady and then after she pass away and then she pass away and the prophet said what how did he die no this one I need some explanation apology and explanation okay after a while God said to the prophet go and ask this girl's parent whether this and this and this never happened to her she F into a water or train something here and there whatever it was go and ask them and when you find out come so I can apologize to you go and find out he said that gu should have died right long time at that time that was the time but she was not ready I spar amen he now you want explanation go and find out I'm sorry you think God doesn't know what he's doing you think he doesn't know what he's doing you think God is dead God is alive it doesn't own us explanation we serve God no by explanation we serve God by faith we please God not by explanation we please God by faith amen by faith and the Bible tells us without faith it is impossible to please the Lord it is impossible we can you can never please God except by faith right if you want explanation if you want to understand if you want everything to be explained vividly yeah before yeah I want you to explain to me about the brown bear explain to me about Sabo can you explain to me I don't have time to explain anything I believe because of Revelation I did not come in because there was signs no that's no signs and wonders signs and wonders is not what I believe I believe the word amen hallelujah praise the Lord God didn't explain to Abraham take your son go and sacrifice him for me thank God Abraham didn't test Sarah if he had told Sarah that thing would never be that woman would say Look Papa me have spent my life finished take me leave my son but God didn't ask for Sarah God asked for Isaac right God asks for something you have to give that to him that's why brother BR say he said Moses take off your shoe he didn't say take up your heart what God demand what God requests that's why we surrender to him God want your heart God said give me your heart Surrender Your Own being submit to me amen you don't ask why why should I submit to you what will you do that's not your business say submit to me follow me why you don't ask question you follow brother BR said Faith always acknowledges the word to be the truth right Faith don't reason Faith bases on the word God said so so Abraham obeyed yes he took his son you have to work for three days three days in the jungles climbing the hills climbing the mountain the word was not like this today talk about how many years back three to four th000 years back and they have to walk how many people were in the in the word at that time and they have to walk walk and talk about white animals here and there everywhere but Faith don't question Faith don't reason and Faith don't fear Faith hangs on the word God say so and if God said it God is responsible if God said I should sacrifice my son and God said go here it is God's responsibility to see to it that I get there oh there are many things you we want to understand and we don't understand but listening sometime we even question is the god there is he hearing my prayer at all I've been fasting and praying and I don't see anything [Music] listening may God help us woo wo listen if we ever gone to school whether you do a home home home home what do you call it home school or school school right or whatever school it is yeah there's a time when we are in school the teacher speaks a lot tells you do this lesson read here do this and that and that and that right okay at a point in time time the teacher don't speak again what are you talking yeah the teacher don't speak again that is when he test right when you are being tested the teacher don't speak the teacher that was laughing and smiling with you doesn't do it again he becomes a supervisor and he walks around and you are your work in the exam room you don't ask for questions right please can you explain this no you have been giv the work do your work so when you come to a point and it seems God is quiet is testing you when you have done what should be done and is quiet is just testing you am Abraham after he's gone all the way jungles here and there jungles here and there then he came to M Moria and God say here sacrifice your son and God was watching there might be a lot of battles in the mind of Abraham because the greatest battle that is fought is fought in the mind what is this what is that but he had a revelation of God he believed in God you know that I don't understand sure you come to a point what is this it seems is contradictory God said out of Isaac your seed will be called God said sacrifice Isaac I can how can you put this two things together you said out of Isaac my shall be called now you said I should sacrifice him maybe Isaac himself would have asked his father Papa but you told me God told you that um your seed will be C through me say yes God told me I believe it about now Papa i c you now why do you tell me now that God say you should sacrifice me say yes I believe that too you believe all yes I believe all what is the explanation I have no explanation I just believe it amen because I know Peter said I know whom I believed amen Peter said we know who you are Amen to whom shall we go even though we don't understand and we cannot explain everything but we believe like the woman said sir I perceive you are a prophet and even though the 7 went away this one said to whom shall we go for we know you are the Christ amen but how can you explain this I cannot explain but I believe it and when it seems there is a knot there amen the one who tied the knot is the one that W tie it so what you do understand leave it to God yes he's the one that want TI it he's the one that will lose it amen hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord I know you think this boy is crazy but it's okay like I always tell the people the only way we can serve God is to be crazy you must lose your mind and get the mind of Christ am if you don't lose your mind you can never serve God because the Bible tells us that God choose the foolishness of preaching the way of the Cross is foolish to those who have perishing so if you don't lose your mind you can never make it you must lose your mind and get his mind amen let this mind which was in Christ be in you amen so we must die to our intellectualism and our feelings and die to it all this must be explained here and there and there where is that where is Faith when everything explain why is your faith God don't need to explain nothing if because of that you would not serve God go amen God is not begging people to come and serve him oh his children will serve him amen he's choosing we sering yes Peter said to whom shall we go we don't understand but we believe oh you think you have to be baby every day I come to church no no no no no if you don't can go somebody will come here Jesus said if this will hold their peace the stones will cry out you reject the message and go God will bring somebody there because the foundation of God stand sure and God knoweth those that are his and God's people will believe no matter what amen hallelujah woo glory to God he didn't explain to Abraham m- abrah carried his son he went 3 days journey I said Papa why is the r for sacrifice he said God will provide let's go sometime the enemy will tell you you have left something behind we are not whatever we left behind God will provide it at the at the end of it Go oby hallelujah oh what a day that will be and then after obedience Abraham put his son there and then just as he took the S go hey Abraham don't do any evil to your son now I know that you love me more than Isaac more than yourself look behind you just at that time he look behind where did I came from Brother BR said in the crucial moment in the moment of time God provided Hallelujah in the it was not there before but at the hour of need and in your hour of need you might not know how it will come where it will be coming from but it will come amen it will make a way and then God said now I know you love me and because you have obeyed my voice in blessing I will bless you in multiply I will multiply you because you have obeyed my voice may God help us Abraham pleased the Lord amen by obedience amen the Bible say by faith Abraham by faith Moses by faith Enoch by faith all of them Faith no explanation faith pleasing the Lord by faith God don't need to explain anything to us no we come by faith and brother Bram said that is revelation and he said it makes a difference in everything that we do Revelation makes a difference he said he made a difference between King and Abel they all receive order to go and sacrifice but Abel by revelation offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than King so Revelation makes a differ in our lives in our worship every one of us the way you are doing things the way we are handling things shows what revelation we have yes we don't serve god with slackness amen the Bible say we should serve the Lord with all our heart with all your might with all your soul and everything that is in us hallelujah may God help you Brothers may God help you my sisters may God every one of us to serve god with joy and gladness joy and gladness hallelujah oh praise the Lord in sickness in sorrow in pain serve the Lord the prophet of God said sometime God allows disappointment to come to see what you will do right he said the Christian life seems to hold a lot of disappointments amen he say if one is not absolutely centered on the word it seem the Christian life holds a lot of disappoint ments but the prophet said those disappointments are God's Divine will happening to us he said it might not look like that but it is whether in sickness whether in life whether in death will serve the Lord that's why job said I know my redeemer liveth he said even though he slays me yet I will trust him and job was a righteous man and job was holy and J was prayerful and job was committed and God was proud of him oh Hallelujah and brother Bram said if you have a trial you find favor with God yes sir he said if you have a trial God has confidence in you as he had confidence in job and God knows you will stand the test Hallelujah we should stand gallant and let the devil feel asham of himself yes sir and brother Bram said the True Believer no matter how little is what it might be he said he will stand on that word no matter he said the Wiest Christian the weakest so let's take me said me I'm the Wiest Christian but the wicked Christian will stand on the word and defeat the Devil to the nonsense listen we cannot lose this battle am we have been predestinated to win amen to be Overcomers Overcomers in Christ you have been predestinated Hey listen do you know or remember this even to come into this flesh you have to overcome your Gene has to overcome amen because there are millions of eggs right in the gem of Life Millions amen your gym was not the only one that was produced that day right by your parent millions and how did you survive by predestination by election other gyms died other ex died but you made it you were predestinated you were because God knew you'll be in this hour listen there were many that are being our classmates and schoolmates and neighbors and this and that and some of them are dead some of them are nowhere but why are you here because you were ordained you were chosen by God to live in this hour to believe this message to stand for God you can't fail you have trials you have disappointment you may fail here you fall here but you will make it at the end of it you have been ordained to overcome oh whether the devil like it or not we make it I will make it am amen oh say this brother yes sir I love Jesus I love his people and you must come to that point to know who you are because if you depend upon your feelings Satan will be beating you every day but we are not depending upon feeling we are depending upon th say is the Lord God said so am it's not me it's not what I can do it's not what I've have done it's what he did he did it already he paid the price he said it is finished and I'm hanging on it amen I know I will make it by his grace and you will make will make it amen the grace that I brought us this far we lead us on just be more committed to him things will be happening you might not get things to go your way every time no things will not go your way every time you will not get everything that you want amen I'm telling you you will not get things your way every time but you know one thing I know whom I believed right Hallelujah and if you ask something and you don't even get it oh you know he's in charge because brother Braham said hallelujah amen brother brah said when God said no he said his nose as good his nose are as good as his yeses amen so if he said no that is his will yes so it's as good as yes right hallelujah amen oh God help us to believe not Who We Believe to know who we are when the devil come around bro say get out of here I know whom I believe right if I ask it doesn't give me praise the Lord I know it's for my good put the devil to shame silent the Devil by faith listen the Bible say by faith they refuse Deliverance Hebrews 11 yes right they refuse Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection amen they offered them Deliverance an easy way is Forget by faith Daniel shout the mouth of the Lions by faith sh mes and Abednego they qu the violence of fire and they pleased the Lord they look at God looking at his children Dan he had opportunity they said nobody should pray and then said I will pray I will do it because in knew it is the will of God Amen it is the word of God for me to pray amen so they pleased the Lord by obedience amen faith in the word so now I will pray they said what they might kill you say well that's okay amen if obedience bring bring death that's all right obedience to the word of God oh Lord may God Inspire our faith help us am and they prayed Daniel Prayed he knew they will come for of course he knew they will be coming he knew because of him they made that decree but it's okay hallelujah oh praise the Lord and and and and when they were to put him into the lion's den and and the King said something I preached on it one and the King told Daniel Daniel servant of the Living God May your God whom you Faithfully serve may he deliver you from the Lions the king says so right the king knew Daniel was serving God Faithfully yes Hallelujah and God delivered Daniel Hallelujah by faith he pleased the Lord from his childhood when he was in Babylon and they purpose in the their heart we are not going to defy ourselves we are not going to dress like other women are dressing we are not going to walk the way they are doing things we are not going to paint our faces we are not going to make our all this kind of high heels and whatever listen the message has not changed remember that the message if you are reading the message remember the message has not changed like this Bible has never changed that's this old Bible it has never changed the message has not changed God's word has not changed you may change things for yourself but the word of God has not changed whatever God condemn yesterday God condemn it today whatever the prophet brought to us under the inspiration is the same today am if you move away from it if you have done it it's said get back amen back to the line again back when the prophet had that Vision over there and he saw some going out of steps yes he said get back stay in the line why the word has not change oh God help us hallelujah it is our testing time whether we are going to stay with it or whether we are going to give up that's right whether we are going to stay with it or we are going to compromise whether we are going to stay with it or we are going to do what everybody is doing amen it's our testing time amen because there is pressure on the people today in everybody under some kind of pressure and that is pushing people into all kinds of things to do all kinds of things to let down the B to compromise on the word here and there but it's our test are you also going to compromise are you also going to give up may God help us not to give up not to compromise but stand and say I know whom I believed amen I am persuaded is able to keep what I have committed to his trust against that day you make a way sometime it seems we come to disappointment here and there but God allows it just after that he shows his glory yes they came to the re oh oh what is this oh and they look behind and they en were coming oh we are stranded we are not stranded we are not stranded is the enemy not us because we are following the pillar of fire we have been called by God the angel of the Lord LED them to the rest SE whatever state we are God is leading the church right hallelujah hallelujah and when the Egyptians look at the Israel say they are stranded they stranded we got them they didn't know that God has gotten them they thought they got him and God said you don't I got you I got you where I want you to be hallelujah what a mighty God we are serving and they were standing there and the people were and God said don't just just go go go go go forward because he has already told Moses before the journey started said the way of the rest sea Pharaoh will think you are stranded and I will meet him there I will show my glory just go hallelujah oh praise the lord we are not stranded we are not stranded in the wilderness we are not stranded Brothers we are not stranded our God is leading and wherever it seems there is no way wait and be still he will make a way there if we are following the pillar of fire this Pillar of Fire that brought this message it's not William Brandon's message it is the message of Jehovah God that has been foresaw way back before the foundation of the word that there will be a messy like this and all the prophet Malachi prophesy that our hearts will be turned to the heart of the fathers and we are taught in the scripture the mysteries of God will be revealed the secret things of God will be made known to us in this day for what for us to Fai no we'll be tested yes we have trials yes yes we have challenges yes but we will not be stranded am the pill of Father LED in the wilderness they were not stranded they were not looking for the pill of fire the pillar of fire was leading yes and the pillar of fire is leading this house this body of Christ leading the elect of God in this crucial hour Hallelujah will make it by his grace amen and when they thought oh yes we got them we got them we got them God said to Moses divide the sea divide the Sea and the sea was open wow yes it's opening yes because God was ahead of them follow the angel of the Lord he will make a way amen where there is no way right may God help us by obedience please the Lord follow the word right no matter what just follow the word amen Enoch had this testimony that he pleased the Lord may your testimony and my testimony as Mothers and Fathers as husbands and wives as a church a group of Believers yeah May Our Testimony be oh they please the Lord they did what I wanted them to do am they prayed they trusted they supported the mission World they they they they were giving they oh may you have that testimony as husbands as wives as mothers as father all they supported me they pray they believe they head on when things were falling down here and things were falling down here when others were denying the message when others were condemning the prophet when others were trying to find 4 in there this group of people they stood for me yes that's right Enoch pleased the Lord amen he had a testimony am if everything was smooth there would not have been a testimony everything was smooth there not have be any testimony everybody was not know that it was a unique life he was following the Lord he was obeying the word they were doing things which was abnormal Noah building the ACT abnormal are we together it was abnormal nobody has done this thing before and what are you talking about he pleased the Lord by faith God bless you church God bless you friends God bless you beloved may God help us amen let's please the Lord yes amen don't give up hold on to it am hold on to it Enoch as he walk he walk he walk he was translated in our walk one of these mornings one of these mornings will'll be gone we'll be out of here Enoch it was no just walking maybe you might be coming to church and the Raptor takes place amen maybe in your house there maybe brother sitting by the the looking at the water and you are gone and in the church one of these days let's keep walking let's keep trusting let's keep following oh Hallelujah it might look abnormal to people so what are you going to church for it might look abnormal so what are you here for it might look abnormal all the rest of our fathers they look abnormal that's why we are glad to be oddballs I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of the odd bosss I can say one of I'm one of those who please God by faith walking by faith living by faith trusting in Jesus Hallelujah God bless you I will not take much of time God bless you brother [Applause] Hallelujah prise God God bless really app that that was double barrel automatic I wrote down here that I'm going to bring my notebook next time I need more than a piece of paper here that was so rich um you know something I I just thought about just now our brother was speaking here but we think about Enoch that he walked close with the Lord then he was like translated which was going which is going to H which did happen right and it is a type of the Bride being translated in this age but as our brother was speaking it just kind of opened up to me a little bit more that our walk we are being translated in our walk yes the Bible says we are changed from Glory unto Glory amen when we come to church we hear the word actually change happens in our life amen and we we don't want to be just looking for that day we want to be looking for the for the next word to come forth and change us just a little bit because if we see that change happening a little bit it gives us I think that faith that we're going to need for the Rapture amen amen let's stand together and I I like how our brother started off he asked that question how close are we to the Lord and I think after this message we could ask ourselves the same question how close are we to the Lord I feel like I mean I know that I need a closer walk with the Lord at the beginning of the service but after the word came forth it just like spoke I need a much closer walk with the Lord amen it's so so challenging so challenging that word I believe challenged us today let's sing all hail King Jesus amen amen if anybody wants special prayer I know our brother will pray with you amen all hell King Jesus a h [Music] Manuel King of Kings Lord of lords Bright Morning star and throughout eternity I'm going to praise him
