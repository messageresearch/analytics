[43:38] title yielding ourselves to God while
[43:41] possessing the Gate of the enemy can
[43:43] kind of seem like two different
[43:46] subjects so if I'm going to yield myself
[43:50] to this song or listen to the words and
[43:54] and get into it is one thing but to go
[43:58] ahead and possess something in fact it
[44:01] would be actually something that the
[44:03] enemy is using which take a lot of
[44:06] effort to do it seems like this like two
[44:11] different things being done at the same
[44:15] time but in reality when we yield
[44:18] ourselves to God we are promised the
[44:21] possession of the Gate of our
[44:24] enemy word possession when we have
[44:28] possession of something that means we
[44:29] have control of it
[44:31] amen and whosoever has possession of a
[44:35] Gateway or a a canal can control what
[44:38] passes through and we got uh certain
[44:42] natural canals the Baltic canals the
[44:44] Suez Canal the Panama canal canal and
[44:48] these are are important uh gateways for
[44:51] shipments to to to pass
[44:55] through and uh
[44:58] our minds are like gateways where
[45:00] information passes through them amen and
[45:04] sometimes when the wrong information
[45:06] passes through we know that the
[45:09] enemy Is possessing that gate for that
[45:13] moment because God would never allow the
[45:17] wrong thing to pass through into our
[45:20] minds Paul said in Philippians 4 finally
[45:23] Brethren whatsoever things are true
[45:26] whatsoever Things Are honest whatsoever
[45:27] things are just whatsoever things are
[45:29] pure and lovely and of a good report if
[45:32] there be any virtue if there be any
[45:34] praise think on these
[45:38] things when God is in control of the
[45:40] gate only the right things pass through
[45:43] and he said these things which you have
[45:45] both learned and received and heard and
[45:47] seen in me and do and the God of Peace
[45:50] shall be with you right so when we let
[45:53] the wrong things come through we can get
[45:56] all full of
[45:59] anxiety but not when you let let the
[46:02] write things through so we see that
[46:04] these Gates can be possessed or in
[46:08] control by the
[46:11] enemy Jesus said there were two gates
[46:14] one was straight one was
[46:17] wide God was in control the Straight
[46:19] Gate yes he called it
[46:22] narrow not much room to get through
[46:26] you've seen those long long
[46:28] narrow uh real high walls there ain't
[46:31] much room for a boat to get through
[46:33] there is just one way to get
[46:36] through and Satan he's in control of the
[46:40] wide
[46:41] gate described as very broad lots of
[46:44] room doesn't matter what you think about
[46:48] amen the God of Peace wants us to think
[46:52] on the
[46:53] things
[46:54] these these things that were meant
[46:57] of a good report and pure and lovely and
[47:00] holy we might look at that scripture and
[47:01] say well that's pretty straight that's
[47:03] pretty narrow you can't think about you
[47:05] know other things than that but you
[47:08] notice it leads to peace it leads to
[47:10] life it leads to the right
[47:13] direction but Satan just wants you to
[47:15] think about anything look at any news
[47:17] and just get involved in any old kind of
[47:19] thought that comes into your head just
[47:22] Broadway of
[47:25] thinking
[47:28] now Abraham's seed was promised
[47:31] possession of the gates of their enemy
[47:34] and I'll say it like this it's a
[47:37] spiritual seed the spiritual Seed of
[47:39] Abraham is Promised the possession of
[47:42] the Gate of the enemy the natural seed
[47:45] was absolutely afraid of their
[47:49] enemy because the Giants were in control
[47:53] amen they were too afraid to enter in
[47:56] into the promised land because their
[47:58] enemy controlled the
[48:01] gates it
[48:03] took a spiritual seed of God which was
[48:07] led by Joshua and Caleb to go into the
[48:10] promised
[48:11] land and those Gates just came down
[48:14] amen now we are the seed of Our Father
[48:17] Abraham by faith the Bible
[48:20] says we've been promised possession of
[48:23] what comes in and what goes out of these
[48:28] Gates the reason we need possession of
[48:31] the enemy's Gates is so we can fully and
[48:34] completely yield ourself to God now
[48:37] there's where your your connection comes
[48:40] in uh it's very difficult to yield to
[48:43] something when something else is trying
[48:46] to distract
[48:48] you remember as a 15-year-old boy and I
[48:51] was taking my driver's license and
[48:53] driving on
[48:55] M59
[48:57] of course I hadn't had a lot of
[48:59] experience driving and getting to be
[49:01] behind the wheel you know all that is
[49:03] when you were first got your driver's
[49:04] license you all excited and had all
[49:07] these feelings going and you're in
[49:08] control and you just you're free and all
[49:12] these things were going on and
[49:15] this uh driver's ed teacher started
[49:20] polling on me from the
[49:23] seat it's one of those bench seats you
[49:25] know back in the
[49:28] day and I'm just driving and I'm
[49:31] thinking what is she
[49:34] doing but she was seeing if I was going
[49:38] to get distracted or if I had control of
[49:41] the
[49:42] vehicle there's a reason that the police
[49:45] don't want you texting when you're
[49:48] driving because they feel you won't have
[49:50] control they don't want you drinking
[49:53] drunk and
[49:55] driving so I'll say it like this God
[49:58] wants us to have possession of the gates
[50:01] that are inside of us or else we won't
[50:04] be able to yield ourselves completely to
[50:10] God now the Lord doesn't want us
[50:14] involved in the things of the
[50:17] world why we're trying to serve him
[50:19] because they're a
[50:21] distraction 1 John chap 2:1 15 says love
[50:26] not not the world neither the things
[50:29] that are in the world they're a
[50:31] distraction now the world I'm just going
[50:33] to say it like this it's the world
[50:35] nature it's not the world that we not
[50:38] this world not this world it's the world
[50:41] nature that we were born
[50:44] with they that nature is what brought
[50:48] the the the terrible things that are
[50:49] happening in the world and if any man
[50:53] love the world the love of the father is
[50:56] not in him
[50:57] for all that is in the world look at
[51:01] this it's the lust of the flesh that's
[51:03] inside of man right and and the lust of
[51:06] the eyes and the pride of life look at
[51:10] me I'm going to do this is not of the
[51:14] father but it's of the world Amen and
[51:18] the world passeth away and the lust
[51:20] thereof but he that doeth the will of of
[51:23] God he's the one that abides forever
[51:26] amen we know the way that leads to life
[51:30] amen it's straight it's
[51:33] narrow but I'm so glad that I'm not in a
[51:36] place can you imagine being lost in this
[51:39] world and not knowing the way to get to
[51:43] heaven how horrible that would be just
[51:46] to be just wandering and and no no
[51:49] Avenue no way to to to get a hold of God
[51:54] but God made a way for those that truly
[51:57] love him
[51:59] amen now we've got a choice who we want
[52:02] to serve who we want to yield our life
[52:06] to and Paul said know ye not that to
[52:09] whom you yield yourself servants obey
[52:12] his servant you are to whom you obey
[52:15] whether unto sin unto death or of
[52:18] obedience unto
[52:20] righteousness so our our body has the
[52:23] ability to
[52:24] yield you made it decision to to yield
[52:28] yourself and come to church you didn't
[52:30] have to nobody made you but you yield
[52:32] yourself to that well all day long we
[52:36] have that same Choice happening inside
[52:39] of our mind with thoughts that come to
[52:41] us now remember the thoughts that come
[52:43] to our mind they're not all from the
[52:47] Lord if I could say it like this the
[52:49] majority are a distraction the majority
[52:53] are a
[52:55] distraction Jesus said in Luke 16:13 no
[52:59] servant can serve two
[53:02] masters for he will either hate the one
[53:05] and love the other or else he will hold
[53:08] to the one and despise the other you
[53:12] cannot serve God and
[53:15] Mammon you can't yield to both at one
[53:18] time you just
[53:20] can't it is the devil's job to get us to
[53:23] think that we're serving God no matter
[53:25] what's what what we're
[53:28] doing but people will either despise
[53:31] their
[53:32] flesh or they will despise obeying the
[53:35] word of God Amen it's that that this
[53:39] this all there is to it and and and the
[53:42] devil is is is is is trying to say it
[53:45] it's okay what you do what you think
[53:49] what you say because they deserve it it
[53:51] don't matter don't matter your attitude
[53:54] you know God's still with you you're
[53:55] still silvering God that is you cannot
[53:58] give me scripture for that why would you
[54:00] why would you accept
[54:04] that if you don't call the devil out
[54:07] that means he can stay in the
[54:12] gate now if our greatest enemy is
[54:15] ourself that means the gates that the
[54:17] enemy uses must be present as well
[54:21] brother bam taught us that there are
[54:23] five gates to the body see taste smell
[54:26] hear and feel and it's through these
[54:29] Gates that information enters and we're
[54:31] able to process things we we see things
[54:34] we we see colors we see food and and and
[54:38] we see pictures and we see words and
[54:41] that information now we take it and we
[54:45] process it inside we walk into a room
[54:47] and it it smells it it it it gets our
[54:51] attention right if you're hungry you
[54:52] walk into the kitchen and and you smell
[54:55] some food cooking Bo that smells really
[54:59] good sometimes we walk into a a a a room
[55:02] and uh that that's got chemicals and
[55:05] stuff in it and it doesn't smell
[55:08] good right and our nose takes that
[55:11] information and we we we process it we
[55:15] know we got to get out of here or we
[55:17] can't wait for
[55:18] dinner are you with me now inside of our
[55:22] bodies is a spirit with five gates I
[55:24] know brother Brandon preached this two
[55:26] different ways which one's on the inside
[55:29] but just go with me here because that
[55:30] doesn't matter right this second inside
[55:33] our bodies is our spirit with five gates
[55:36] memory conscious affection imagination
[55:39] and
[55:41] reasoning it is through these Gates
[55:44] these channels these canals that
[55:45] information passes through into the
[55:48] spirit
[55:50] man are you with me and inside our
[55:54] spirit is our soul and brother ROM says
[55:57] that's who you are you want to know who
[55:58] you are you are a soul that's what he
[56:01] said the soul that sinth shall die the
[56:04] Bible says James said Brethren if any of
[56:06] you do Heir from the truth and one
[56:08] converteth him let him know that he
[56:11] which converteth The Sinner from the air
[56:12] of his way shall save a soul from death
[56:17] and shall hide on multitude of sin am
[56:21] see there's only one thing that's going
[56:22] to save the
[56:24] body that's a rapture
[56:28] right and and actually that's going to
[56:29] be changed so either way the flesh and
[56:32] blood is not going to inherit you know
[56:34] the kingdom of God the soul only has one
[56:37] gate in which it can enter in and
[56:41] brother Bram said that's by Free
[56:44] Will We Will what's going to go in there
[56:47] brother Bram said there's only one of
[56:49] two things that lies inside the soul and
[56:52] that's either Faith or doubt think about
[56:55] that statement we're here today
[56:57] listening to the word of God and inside
[56:59] of us is either faith in the word or
[57:01] we're questioning things and anytime you
[57:05] question things you will never be able
[57:07] to achieve what only can be achieved by
[57:12] faith I say doubt your
[57:15] doubts believe the word of
[57:18] God it is the devil's desire to have
[57:22] possession of the gates so he can
[57:24] control what information goes through
[57:26] through what what passes through these
[57:28] channels because as he gets as he
[57:31] controls what's going in now he can
[57:33] conform your nature you see why God
[57:36] wants control the gates so he can change
[57:38] your nature into the nature of
[57:41] God
[57:43] especially our soul because brother
[57:46] brandom said our soul is the control
[57:49] tower of our entire
[57:53] life only Faith or doubt can by there
[57:56] and Jesus said you cannot serve two
[57:59] masters it'll be one or the
[58:03] other are you with me this
[58:05] morning the devil wants to control the
[58:08] Gate of her soul brother BR said in the
[58:11] in the message work is Faith expressed
[58:14] he said speaking of the Soul he said
[58:17] that's the
[58:18] guidepost that's the control tower the
[58:22] inside of the inside the soul controls
[58:25] the spirit and the spirit controls the
[58:30] body so it doesn't it isn't how we look
[58:33] out
[58:34] here it's how we look down
[58:37] here it's important what's going on down
[58:40] here it's important to not love God out
[58:44] here when everybody's looking it's
[58:46] important to love God in here when
[58:48] nobody's looking amen the inside of the
[58:51] inside that's what really really counts
[58:55] now when we're born the first time we're
[58:58] born with a self-centered satanic nature
[59:02] can't do nothing about it the Bible says
[59:04] we were children of Wrath when we were
[59:07] born by Nature Amen in other words we
[59:10] yelled we screamed we got mad we got
[59:12] upset we blamed we manipulated others we
[59:15] did what we had to do to get what we
[59:17] wanted because our nature was just
[59:20] selfish
[59:23] right you you could not be a
[59:27] family and and and and have some of your
[59:30] kids if they didn't get what they wanted
[59:32] from you they would go to the you know
[59:34] the spouse the other parent they would
[59:38] do whatever they had to do to get
[59:42] it and we had to bribe them clean your
[59:45] room first do your
[59:47] chores take out the garbage to get them
[59:51] to do something that they should just do
[59:53] because mom or dad asked
[59:57] that's why Jesus said we must be born
[1:00:00] again or we can't enter the Kingdom of
[1:00:02] Heaven Colossians 3:8 now Colossians 3:8
[1:00:06] they put that up but now ye also put off
[1:00:11] all these I want to ask today how many
[1:00:15] of you have put these off not how many
[1:00:18] you don't like but how many have
[1:00:19] actually put them off or they're still
[1:00:24] on put off all these not not one or two
[1:00:28] of them but all of them
[1:00:30] anger
[1:00:32] wrath
[1:00:33] malice
[1:00:35] blasphemy filthy
[1:00:38] communication out of your
[1:00:44] mouth
[1:00:46] why this is this is a we're reading out
[1:00:49] of the Christian Bible this
[1:00:53] morning lie not one to another see you
[1:00:56] put off the old man with his
[1:00:58] deeds and it put on the new man which is
[1:01:02] renewed in the knowledge after the image
[1:01:06] of him that created him so now we're
[1:01:10] putting off the things of that first
[1:01:13] satanic selfish nature and we're
[1:01:16] yielding
[1:01:17] ourselves to His
[1:01:20] Image praise the Lord amen now when the
[1:01:24] enemy has control of our gates I'll just
[1:01:26] say bad things
[1:01:28] happen we act
[1:01:31] abnormal the Bible says
[1:01:33] unseemingly
[1:01:35] uncharacteristic of a Believer
[1:01:37] professing to be
[1:01:39] Christlike we'll start putting others
[1:01:42] down we'll start esteeming ourselves
[1:01:45] instead of others we'll spend more time
[1:01:48] worrying about our reputation than God's
[1:01:52] reputation we'll spend more time
[1:01:54] worrying about our will
[1:01:56] instead of God's will now these are the
[1:01:59] bad things that happen when the enemy
[1:02:01] has possession of the
[1:02:03] gates when the enemy has control of the
[1:02:05] gates we can begin uh he can begin to
[1:02:08] take control of literally our
[1:02:12] spirit we'll begin to make
[1:02:15] excuses of why we just can't go the
[1:02:17] Second
[1:02:19] Mile why we just can't live for others
[1:02:22] why we don't feel like turning a cheap
[1:02:24] for anybody
[1:02:26] why it's okay not to follow every word
[1:02:28] of God that proceedeth out of the mouth
[1:02:30] of God why it's okay to just let the sun
[1:02:33] go down upon your wrath because that's
[1:02:35] just the way it seems to be happening
[1:02:37] every
[1:02:38] night why it's okay to gossip a little
[1:02:41] here a little there or to think ill of
[1:02:44] others because nobody I didn't say
[1:02:49] it this is when the enemy has control of
[1:02:52] our
[1:02:53] gates when he has control he can steal
[1:02:56] our
[1:02:57] joy our joy in serving
[1:03:01] God our joy in serving his
[1:03:06] people we just don't got time for it no
[1:03:11] joy when he's got control he can fill
[1:03:13] our minds with anxiety and fear and
[1:03:16] turmoil
[1:03:18] confusion
[1:03:20] discontentment becoming dissatisfied all
[1:03:23] the
[1:03:24] time this is not the Lord Jesus in
[1:03:27] control of our
[1:03:29] gates things can go south pretty quickly
[1:03:32] when the enemy's got
[1:03:34] control and most of the times that it's
[1:03:36] happening people don't even realize it
[1:03:39] that the devil's there because the
[1:03:41] devil's so good at saying I feel the way
[1:03:44] I feel because of what they did because
[1:03:46] of what she did because of what he did
[1:03:49] because of my
[1:03:51] circumstances like God is Not greater
[1:03:53] than our
[1:03:54] circumstances
[1:03:56] whatever happened to though he slay me
[1:03:58] yet why I trust him whatever happened to
[1:04:00] going down into the lion's den and still
[1:04:03] trust you whatever happened to going
[1:04:04] into the fiery furnace and not bowing
[1:04:07] before the
[1:04:09] devil there are people who have viewed
[1:04:12] in themselves to God and continue to yew
[1:04:15] themselves to God it's a
[1:04:18] reality Christ in you is greater than
[1:04:22] the world that's
[1:04:24] inside that you're born
[1:04:27] with you believe that amen praise the
[1:04:32] Lord now both Spirits have the ability
[1:04:35] to supply thoughts through the gates
[1:04:37] both Spirits God and the
[1:04:39] devil now I want to just take one today
[1:04:42] one gate that's all I'm taking did you
[1:04:44] know how long this would take to go
[1:04:45] through all these I want to take one
[1:04:47] gate and that gate is just memory you
[1:04:50] can take any of them and the same thing
[1:04:54] God gave us this gate of memory for
[1:04:58] good second Peter chapter 1 I just want
[1:05:02] to share some scriptures if I can second
[1:05:05] Peter chap 1:12 wherefore I will not be
[1:05:10] negligent to put you always in
[1:05:14] remembrance of these
[1:05:16] things though ye once know knew uh
[1:05:20] though you know them and be established
[1:05:23] in the present truth yeah I think get
[1:05:26] meat as long as I'm in this Tabernacle
[1:05:29] to stir you up by putting you in
[1:05:33] remembrance knowing that shortly I must
[1:05:36] put off this my Tabernacle even as our
[1:05:38] Lord Jesus Christ has shown me moreover
[1:05:41] I will endeavor that ye may be able
[1:05:44] after my
[1:05:46] decease to have these things always in
[1:05:50] remembrance isn't that wonderful our
[1:05:54] memory that God gave us was for
[1:05:57] good it's so his word could remain in
[1:06:01] our mind at all times
[1:06:06] amen all times 1 Corinthians chapter 15
[1:06:10] 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse1 moreover
[1:06:13] Brethren I declare unto you the gospel
[1:06:16] which I preached unto you which also you
[1:06:19] have received wherein you
[1:06:23] stand by which all so you're saved man
[1:06:26] that that just just it's it's
[1:06:29] great by which you are saved if
[1:06:34] if if you keep in
[1:06:38] memory what I preached unto you unless
[1:06:42] you believed in
[1:06:44] vain if you don't keep the word of God
[1:06:47] in your memory what good would it have
[1:06:49] been to even first believe
[1:06:52] it first believing something doesn't
[1:06:55] make make it settled for your
[1:06:57] life you still got to keep it in your
[1:07:00] memory you still got to walk with it you
[1:07:02] got to still hold to
[1:07:04] it amen you want to hold to God's
[1:07:08] unchanging hand hold to the word of God
[1:07:11] Amen that memory grade is very important
[1:07:15] Jesus said in John
[1:07:17] 14:26 the comforter which is the Holy
[1:07:20] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[1:07:22] name he shall teach you all things
[1:07:26] and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:07:31] whatsoever I have said unto you that's
[1:07:33] the job of the Holy Ghost we come to
[1:07:36] church and we we hear the word we're
[1:07:38] being reminded of
[1:07:41] something going down the road and we go
[1:07:43] over the speed limit and we hear this
[1:07:45] little voice say slow
[1:07:49] down oh shouldn't talk like that
[1:07:51] shouldn't think like that that's the
[1:07:53] Holy Ghost where would we be without the
[1:07:56] Holy Ghost we would be like a ship
[1:07:58] without a sail we'd be like
[1:08:00] a a Rudder A Ship Without A Rudder
[1:08:04] too playing without
[1:08:08] wings God wants us to continuously
[1:08:11] remember
[1:08:14] Calvary Jesus said when we take
[1:08:16] communion this do in remembrance of me
[1:08:20] so you can see that God gave us a memory
[1:08:23] for the good amen
[1:08:26] and when these thoughts come to our
[1:08:29] gate whatever God would tell
[1:08:32] us and if we just step in line with what
[1:08:36] he said now we're in line with God
[1:08:38] that's why he gave us that memory is so
[1:08:41] he could speak to us and we could
[1:08:42] remember to do what we should be doing
[1:08:45] amen not get tell us towards our
[1:08:48] conscience and just oh it doesn't matter
[1:08:51] you know it's not that big a thing and
[1:08:52] you know everybody does it and before
[1:08:55] you you know you're just like the
[1:09:00] world we're able to take the information
[1:09:03] that God brings to our remembrance
[1:09:05] through the holy spirit in and we accept
[1:09:08] it through that Free Will right that
[1:09:11] free will say yes I'm going to do it or
[1:09:14] no it doesn't
[1:09:15] matter Our member gate is important it's
[1:09:18] an important gate we must remember that
[1:09:21] both Spirits have the ability to use
[1:09:24] this gate
[1:09:26] even though God gave it for the good SAT
[1:09:29] wants to use it for his
[1:09:32] Advantage did you ever hear you ever
[1:09:35] been somewhere in a restaurant or
[1:09:37] somewhere and they're playing an old
[1:09:39] song that you used to like when you were
[1:09:42] in the
[1:09:43] world oh
[1:09:46] boy ah that was a good one those were
[1:09:50] the good old days that was my favorite
[1:09:53] group you know all those
[1:09:55] things that come to you when you hear
[1:10:00] it that's just the enemy trying to use
[1:10:03] that
[1:10:06] gate you listen long enough pretty soon
[1:10:09] you'll
[1:10:13] start don't do that don't let the enemy
[1:10:16] stop
[1:10:17] them before the devil can get in
[1:10:21] there all because of memory
[1:10:24] gate if Saint wants to discourage you
[1:10:27] there's many ways that he can do that
[1:10:29] for
[1:10:30] sure maybe when you're talking to
[1:10:32] someone that you had a problem with in
[1:10:35] the past no more you don't got a problem
[1:10:37] with them now but you did you had a
[1:10:39] problem with them in the
[1:10:41] past and as you're talking to them the
[1:10:44] devil says you remember how they treated
[1:10:46] you last
[1:10:51] time remember how they acted last time
[1:10:53] towards you remember how they lied last
[1:10:57] time that's the devil using that gate
[1:11:01] because what it's going to do is oh yeah
[1:11:04] okay you are not
[1:11:07] forgiven no I never didn't make that
[1:11:13] right I never did
[1:11:15] Cover I never did
[1:11:18] love at least not with God's love right
[1:11:22] God's love there's no end to it but you
[1:11:24] see how the enemy can use that
[1:11:29] gate maybe he wants to discourage you
[1:11:31] maybe Satan will will bring up your sins
[1:11:35] of the past
[1:11:38] am something that you did so long
[1:11:41] ago sure you're still ashamed of
[1:11:45] it but he'll bring them up even though
[1:11:49] they've been under the blood for how
[1:11:51] long he'll still bring them up uh and
[1:11:55] then he'll again and again and try to
[1:11:59] get you to think that they're still over
[1:12:04] you that's just Satan using the gate
[1:12:08] that God gave you called memory for his
[1:12:11] advantage and that's why we need
[1:12:14] possession of that gate to not allow
[1:12:17] Satan to do
[1:12:21] that we had time we could go through
[1:12:24] every one of these Gates
[1:12:27] but to whom you yield yourself servant
[1:12:29] to be his servant you
[1:12:31] are you can't serve two
[1:12:34] masters we can't have two different
[1:12:38] Gatekeepers you
[1:12:40] can't if that stuff is happening the
[1:12:43] wrong gatekeeper
[1:12:46] there and you got to call them out is if
[1:12:49] you don't call him out he'll stay
[1:12:52] there you get a sliver inside your skin
[1:12:55] in it'll stay there until you decide to
[1:12:58] pull it
[1:13:02] out now Satan wants to stay there
[1:13:04] because he wants to control
[1:13:07] you he doesn't like this idea that you
[1:13:09] got baptized and you started serving
[1:13:12] Jesus
[1:13:14] Christ made his job harder but he's got
[1:13:17] to use a different tools now to get
[1:13:21] you we can't be
[1:13:23] double-minded about
[1:13:26] situations the Bible says a
[1:13:28] double-minded man is unstable in other
[1:13:31] words your mind has to be the mind of
[1:13:36] Christ we're engaged in the greatest
[1:13:38] battle ever
[1:13:39] fought sat wants to control the gates so
[1:13:42] he can transport all of his negativity
[1:13:45] into the inside of
[1:13:47] us and God wants to control the gates so
[1:13:51] he can see his will being done in our
[1:13:54] life and that he could receive Glory
[1:13:56] with every horrible situation that
[1:13:59] happens right I don't care how horrible
[1:14:02] the situation is if Christ is in you you
[1:14:04] can
[1:14:05] shine God can get Glory out of it but
[1:14:09] when you get involved and you start
[1:14:11] doing
[1:14:15] figuring that's just Satan tricking you
[1:14:18] confusing
[1:14:21] you Galatians
[1:14:24] 5
[1:14:25] verse one tells us that we need to stand
[1:14:27] fast in the Liberty where where withth
[1:14:30] Christ has made us
[1:14:34] free and be not entangled again with the
[1:14:37] Yoke of
[1:14:39] bondage Christ set us free but Satan is
[1:14:42] always working to bring that bondage
[1:14:49] back Paul having a great concern for us
[1:14:52] he says in 2 Corinthians 11:2 for I am
[1:14:55] jealous over you with a Godly jealousy
[1:14:58] for I've espoused you to one
[1:15:01] husband that I may present you as a
[1:15:04] chased virgin to Christ one husband not
[1:15:08] two we can't serve two
[1:15:12] masters but look what he says about the
[1:15:15] other in verse three but I fear less by
[1:15:19] any means as the serpent beg galed Eve
[1:15:23] to his tricky
[1:15:26] subtility so your
[1:15:29] minds should be corrupted from the
[1:15:32] Simplicity that is in
[1:15:37] Christ
[1:15:39] Simplicity it's not
[1:15:42] hard we've got it all right here there's
[1:15:45] no confusion in this word if you just
[1:15:49] set your heart to follow this word the
[1:15:54] devil don't got to chance to get
[1:15:56] in but if your heart isn't in love with
[1:15:59] him and you're just trying to get by
[1:16:02] with the the things that you I gotta
[1:16:04] read I gotta pray I gotta go to church
[1:16:06] if you got this
[1:16:09] half-heartedness Satan's got a easy way
[1:16:11] to get in I'm telling you the truth just
[1:16:16] you've heard of kisss keep it simple
[1:16:18] silly don't want to use the other
[1:16:21] word keep God's words first in your mind
[1:16:24] Minds at all times keep God's word first
[1:16:28] in your minds at all times look I'm
[1:16:30] trying to get to this get away from this
[1:16:33] I don't mean it wrong just for a bit
[1:16:36] here Satan gets a lot of people because
[1:16:39] they say well in my heart God knows that
[1:16:43] I love them but they let their mind go
[1:16:44] wherever they want to go say whatever
[1:16:46] they want to say think what they ever
[1:16:47] want to think look if your heart is
[1:16:50] where it needs to be in Christ your mind
[1:16:52] will be too it's a just a trick of the
[1:16:54] enemy
[1:16:57] when we were in the world we heard of
[1:16:59] taking uh we never heard of taking
[1:17:03] possession of our thoughts we just heard
[1:17:05] do what you're told to
[1:17:07] do your mom said this your dad said this
[1:17:10] just do
[1:17:11] it but today as Christians we know the
[1:17:14] Bible we've been told so many
[1:17:17] things the scripture tells us that that
[1:17:20] demons the rest of the demons have been
[1:17:23] Le loosed and I'll tell you this world
[1:17:25] is getting worse and worse all the time
[1:17:29] the devil knows he has but a short time
[1:17:31] I'll just say it's imperative for us
[1:17:34] that we take possession of the gates
[1:17:36] that are inside of us Amen to to focus
[1:17:40] on how really important that is things
[1:17:42] that we don't spend much time like we
[1:17:44] should thinking about now we've been
[1:17:47] promised as the Seed of Abraham that we
[1:17:49] would take possession of these these
[1:17:51] Gates but we're no match for the devil
[1:17:56] we're no match for the
[1:17:57] devil we need someone greater than the
[1:18:00] devil to take control of the gates and
[1:18:03] that's no one else other than the Holy
[1:18:06] Ghost and God promised to do it if we
[1:18:10] would submit
[1:18:12] ourselves to the word of
[1:18:16] God I hope you can see where this
[1:18:18] yielding is coming
[1:18:21] in we've got to be willing to submit
[1:18:24] ourselves to the will of God now you
[1:18:27] want a closer walk with God God says
[1:18:30] draw nigh to me and I'll draw an eye to
[1:18:34] you don't just well God you know I need
[1:18:37] you God you should be helping me and and
[1:18:40] you just see all this going humble
[1:18:44] yourself draw nigh to
[1:18:47] God and He will draw nigh to you what
[1:18:50] does it matter what you got to do if you
[1:18:53] got to go dip seven times and a dirty
[1:18:56] Jordan humble yourself and go do it
[1:18:59] whatever he asked you to do do
[1:19:01] it if you want victory in your
[1:19:06] life if you want victory in your
[1:19:10] life now let's notice in the scriptures
[1:19:13] here the God told Abraham for because
[1:19:17] thou has done this thing what thing what
[1:19:22] thing because thou has o obeyed my voice
[1:19:26] Abraham submitted to the word of God and
[1:19:30] it's the very same thing that is asked
[1:19:32] of you and me to not withhold anything
[1:19:36] from God to put God first to love him
[1:19:40] with all of our heart this is the key to
[1:19:44] making the whole Bible come alive in
[1:19:46] your
[1:19:50] life and I know the devil wants to tell
[1:19:53] you oh yeah you've given God your heart
[1:19:57] it's about time that we start proving to
[1:19:59] God proving that we're doing it because
[1:20:03] when all thy ways please the Lord he'll
[1:20:06] make even thy enemies to be at peace
[1:20:08] with
[1:20:10] you well brother John you don't know my
[1:20:13] enemies no I say you don't know my
[1:20:16] God the word is more faithful than what
[1:20:19] we
[1:20:20] think Deuteronomy
[1:20:23] 10:2 I'm love these I haven't really saw
[1:20:27] this scripture I got a hold of this I
[1:20:29] just want to read it Deuteronomy 1012
[1:20:33] and 13 and now Israel what doth the Lord
[1:20:36] thy God require of thee but to fear the
[1:20:40] lord thy God and to walk in all his ways
[1:20:44] and to love him and to serve the Lord
[1:20:46] thy God with all thy heart and with all
[1:20:50] thy
[1:20:51] soul to keep the Commandments of the
[1:20:54] Lord and and his statutes which I
[1:20:56] command thee this day for thy
[1:21:00] good that's what the lord requires of
[1:21:04] us and if we just did that one thing but
[1:21:08] I'll say it like this if you do just
[1:21:10] that one thing you give your life to
[1:21:13] God that's what it means to give your
[1:21:15] life to God right there not just to I
[1:21:19] accept him as my savior and I'm going to
[1:21:20] go on and do what I want to do with my
[1:21:22] life it just doesn't work like that
[1:21:25] Mark 12:
[1:21:28] 28 and one of the
[1:21:30] scribes came having heard them reasoning
[1:21:35] together and perceived that he had
[1:21:37] answered them well asked Jesus which is
[1:21:40] the first commandment of
[1:21:42] all and Jesus answered him the first of
[1:21:46] all the Commandment says here oh Israel
[1:21:48] the Lord our God is one Lord and Jesus
[1:21:52] said and thou shalt love the Lord thy
[1:21:53] God with all thy heart with all thy soul
[1:21:56] and with what all thy
[1:22:03] mind and with all thy
[1:22:07] strength this is the first
[1:22:10] commandment and the second is is like
[1:22:14] namely is like namely this Thou shalt
[1:22:16] love thy neighbor as thyself there is
[1:22:19] none other commandment greater than
[1:22:23] these he kind of put it in a nutshell
[1:22:25] didn't he for
[1:22:27] us and the scribes said unto him well
[1:22:30] Master thou has said the truth for there
[1:22:33] is one God and there is none other other
[1:22:36] but he and to love him with all your
[1:22:39] heart with all the understanding and
[1:22:43] with all the soul and with all the
[1:22:45] strength and to love his neighbor as
[1:22:47] himself is more than
[1:22:49] all the things that you could ever think
[1:22:52] about doing for God
[1:22:56] right
[1:22:57] there God has a priority that's why he
[1:23:00] could say meno come to me Lord didn't I
[1:23:03] do this didn't I do that depart from me
[1:23:06] I never knew you this is the most
[1:23:09] important thing I like how Jesus
[1:23:12] answered here in verse 34 and when Jesus
[1:23:14] saw that they answered discreetly he
[1:23:16] said unto
[1:23:18] him Thou Art not far from the kingdom
[1:23:22] that's right you're not not far from the
[1:23:25] kingdom of God if you have this
[1:23:28] understanding you're not in yet but
[1:23:30] you're not far from
[1:23:32] it and no man after that does ask him
[1:23:36] any
[1:23:38] questions I'm so glad the Bible is true
[1:23:43] from cover to
[1:23:45] cover I'm so glad God made it plain to
[1:23:48] me there's not a man in the world that
[1:23:50] can come and talk me out of this word
[1:23:53] amen you know that's the wonderful thing
[1:23:55] about the Holy
[1:23:56] Spirit that's God inside that's the The
[1:24:00] God Who created everything that we see
[1:24:03] everything that we see when we walk out
[1:24:04] of these doors everything in here you
[1:24:06] might think oh well man made this oh I'm
[1:24:09] telling you God made the materials that
[1:24:11] made that man made that everything that
[1:24:14] we see God made and he made it by things
[1:24:16] that are not seen it was by faith and
[1:24:19] God wants us to have faith in this
[1:24:22] word it's the seed of Abraham we're
[1:24:25] entitled to This Promise of possessing
[1:24:27] the Gate of our
[1:24:30] enemy we will bring forth as a Seed of
[1:24:33] Abraham we will bring forth the same
[1:24:36] faith that Abraham brought forth because
[1:24:40] Genesis said God said in the
[1:24:43] beginning every seed will bring forth of
[1:24:46] its own
[1:24:48] kind and
[1:24:50] Abraham laid a seed of faith
[1:24:55] it was that faith that God could raise
[1:24:58] up his son from the dead if God wanted
[1:25:01] him
[1:25:03] dead that God could do anything and
[1:25:07] because he did that obedient act because
[1:25:09] he didn't withhold what was dear to him
[1:25:13] he was willing to to to give up
[1:25:15] everything that was dear that he might
[1:25:18] pleased the heavenly father because you
[1:25:21] have done this
[1:25:23] thing
[1:25:26] your seed that's you and I are going to
[1:25:29] possess the Gate of the enemy but it's
[1:25:32] through
[1:25:33] faith it's not a gift God's not going to
[1:25:35] hand it to you as a gift you've got to
[1:25:38] leave here you got to think about the
[1:25:40] things you're thinking you got to
[1:25:42] recognize what's going on inside and you
[1:25:45] got to take a stand amen are you with
[1:25:49] me we're in this greatest battle in our
[1:25:52] minds and we need the help of of the
[1:25:54] Lord James chapter 4 are you getting a
[1:25:58] little something out of
[1:25:59] this all right Lord help us to get
[1:26:01] through this quickly James chapter 4
[1:26:04] from whence cometh Wars and fightings
[1:26:08] among
[1:26:09] [Music]
[1:26:10] you come they not hence even of your
[1:26:13] lust that war in your
[1:26:19] members so inside of
[1:26:23] us
[1:26:25] the black dog and the white dog
[1:26:28] right ye lust and have not you kill and
[1:26:31] desire to have and cannot obtain you
[1:26:35] fight you
[1:26:36] war and yet you have not because you ask
[1:26:40] not you ask and you don't even receive
[1:26:42] because you don't ask for the right
[1:26:47] reasons you adulterers and
[1:26:49] adulteresses know ye not that the
[1:26:53] Friendship of of the world is enity with
[1:26:57] God now I am not talking about this
[1:27:00] world I'm talking about the worldly
[1:27:03] nature that's inside of
[1:27:08] us the friendship with that worldly
[1:27:11] nature is enity with God whosoever
[1:27:15] therefore will be a friend of the world
[1:27:17] is an enemy of God in other words you
[1:27:20] cannot serve two
[1:27:22] masters you cannot be just thinking I
[1:27:25] can think whatever I want to think and
[1:27:26] it doesn't matter and then oh yeah I
[1:27:29] want to try to serve the Lord you can't
[1:27:31] do that I'm telling you there's some
[1:27:34] people that haven't even haven't been up
[1:27:35] to the altar in a long
[1:27:37] time we just need to get this thing
[1:27:40] settled there are some people that
[1:27:42] haven't even been up to the
[1:27:45] altar come on this this word needs to
[1:27:48] become real to
[1:27:50] us Paul said in Romans 8:7 he said
[1:27:54] because the carnal
[1:27:56] mind is enmity against God for it is not
[1:28:01] subject to the word of God neither
[1:28:05] indeed can be so you got to recognize
[1:28:08] your carnal nature isn't going to be
[1:28:11] ever going to be subject to this is
[1:28:12] impossible there's nothing you can do
[1:28:14] you have to die out to it not ask God to
[1:28:18] give you help so your carnal mind can do
[1:28:22] it God does is not going to be friends
[1:28:25] with your carnal
[1:28:27] mind he he hates it he hates my carnal
[1:28:31] mind he hates all of he hates the carnal
[1:28:36] mindset back to James do you think that
[1:28:38] the scripture saith in vain the spirit
[1:28:40] that dwelleth in
[1:28:42] US is lusting to
[1:28:47] Envy but he giveth more grace wherefore
[1:28:51] he saith God resist the
[1:28:54] proud but giveth Grace unto the humble
[1:28:57] amen what was that song that we sang at
[1:29:00] the beginning or before brother the
[1:29:02] first song humble
[1:29:05] yourself let him have his
[1:29:09] way yield yourself to God it takes a
[1:29:13] humility to yield
[1:29:16] yourself he God resists the proud but he
[1:29:21] giveth grace to the humble submit
[1:29:24] yourselves therefore to God resist the
[1:29:27] devil and he will flee from you notice
[1:29:30] submit first to
[1:29:33] God don't try to resist the devil and
[1:29:35] take care of your problems without God
[1:29:37] because that's what you're
[1:29:38] doing but submit to God submit to the
[1:29:42] word then you can resist the devil then
[1:29:45] you can take control of the gates in
[1:29:47] your battle when the battle is Raging
[1:29:50] always remember the first thing is the
[1:29:52] word submit to the to the word amen now
[1:29:55] what do I do what do I do how do I fix
[1:29:57] this no submit to the word get humble
[1:30:01] amen fear the lord respect the Lord stay
[1:30:04] within the boundaries of the word let
[1:30:06] God fight your battles
[1:30:10] amen yield ourselves to God that's what
[1:30:14] it means
[1:30:16] submit yield ourself to God well how's
[1:30:20] that going to help me at the situation I
[1:30:22] mean you know going to church and God
[1:30:24] and religion that's just you know
[1:30:26] whatever that's just for my soul when I
[1:30:28] die
[1:30:30] w wow it's amazing how the devil has got
[1:30:35] so many people to think that they can't
[1:30:38] possess the power of the Holy
[1:30:42] Ghost I'm here to say God is still alive
[1:30:45] he is he is the same yesterday today and
[1:30:48] forever he can get inside of your mind
[1:30:51] he can get inside of your heart just
[1:30:52] like the devil can
[1:30:57] but God don't want to come in there
[1:30:59] periodically he wants a relationship how
[1:31:02] can he have a relationship when we're
[1:31:04] only part-time in
[1:31:07] God you know somebody's going to work
[1:31:09] part-time for me they don't get the
[1:31:11] full-time benefits it's just all there
[1:31:13] is to
[1:31:14] it we're not going to get the full-time
[1:31:17] benefits with God if we're going to
[1:31:18] part-time
[1:31:20] him he's going to withhold certain
[1:31:22] things amen
[1:31:26] as we yield oursel to God we're
[1:31:29] automatically taking possession of the
[1:31:32] gates of our enemy as we're submitting
[1:31:35] to the word we're taking possession of
[1:31:38] those
[1:31:40] Gates and now
[1:31:44] God now God can filter the right
[1:31:47] thoughts through our
[1:31:49] mind now we can start thinking lovely
[1:31:53] things about others not ill but
[1:31:57] lovely now we can start talking about a
[1:31:59] good report not
[1:32:02] negativity now we can think on the
[1:32:04] things that are
[1:32:06] pure all because the gatekeeper is there
[1:32:10] in control of Our
[1:32:14] Lives draw nigh to God and He will draw
[1:32:19] nigh to you cleanse your hands you
[1:32:21] Sinners and purify your
[1:32:25] hearts did he label him he
[1:32:29] double-minded like he labeling
[1:32:33] somebody when our hearts are not all for
[1:32:36] God our minds are not all for
[1:32:40] God when our hearts have am miixed right
[1:32:45] the word of God fell in a heart that was
[1:32:47] also had some seeds of the world they
[1:32:51] grew
[1:32:52] together and he said purify your heart
[1:32:55] you double-minded only one gatekeeper
[1:32:59] not two love God with all of your mind
[1:33:03] with all of your heart when we yield
[1:33:06] ourselves to the holy spirit this word
[1:33:09] of God we have the Bible says we have
[1:33:12] access into God's
[1:33:14] grace now needs can be met I think we
[1:33:17] ought to be
[1:33:20] happy to really have the authority to
[1:33:23] kick Out the Devil you ever been so mad
[1:33:25] about a
[1:33:27] situation but you just didn't have
[1:33:29] strength to kick the devil
[1:33:31] out you know what I mean you're just so
[1:33:34] mad you know it's a
[1:33:36] devil but you have no strength are you
[1:33:39] with me am I just saying something that
[1:33:41] I've experienced and nobody else
[1:33:45] experienced I like it when the god takes
[1:33:51] control look
[1:33:55] because
[1:33:57] thou has obeyed the voice of the
[1:34:02] Lord you're going to take
[1:34:05] possession because you've obeyed the
[1:34:07] voice of the Lord now I think what I'm
[1:34:10] trying to say here is I'm not here to
[1:34:13] tell you what I want you to start
[1:34:16] obeying I'm here to say to you you need
[1:34:20] to get serious about making sure you're
[1:34:24] obeying what God is telling you to do
[1:34:27] am he may be telling you something
[1:34:30] different than you I don't
[1:34:33] know but it isn't just well you just do
[1:34:36] this one thing and everything's going to
[1:34:37] be okay
[1:34:38] no I don't I don't know what your what
[1:34:41] what what the battle is I just know that
[1:34:45] that God is going to test us just like
[1:34:47] he tested
[1:34:49] Abraham and he's got tests for us he
[1:34:52] wants to see what we're going to do he
[1:34:54] wants to see it
[1:34:56] manifested
[1:34:58] because when he was getting ready
[1:35:01] Abraham's getting ready to kill his son
[1:35:03] and and that God stayed his
[1:35:07] hand the voice said now I
[1:35:11] know now I
[1:35:13] know now I know well he he's God he knew
[1:35:15] everything before it happened but he
[1:35:17] said now I
[1:35:19] know he wants to see the manifestation
[1:35:23] amen
[1:35:24] it's not complete until we manifest that
[1:35:27] word so we can't manifest it until he
[1:35:30] brings a trial and he brings a
[1:35:33] test now we have possession now of the
[1:35:36] very gate that was once used by the
[1:35:39] enemy the one that he torments us with
[1:35:41] and puts terrible thoughts in and all
[1:35:44] because we submitted to the word we put
[1:35:46] God first not second we've set our love
[1:35:49] and our affections upon the
[1:35:51] Lord now God can come in and take
[1:35:55] control of Our Lives we trade peace for
[1:35:59] torment I'll do that any day of the week
[1:36:02] he gave us joy instead of Sorrow he gave
[1:36:05] us love instead of ill and hurt and hate
[1:36:08] I'll say god reigns amen he reigns
[1:36:11] inside of us the Bible when the when the
[1:36:14] battle is is Raging in the believer's
[1:36:17] mind we have the Holy Ghost as a
[1:36:21] gatekeeper we don't handle things like
[1:36:23] we used
[1:36:25] to we don't just look at the outward
[1:36:27] appearance and start judging
[1:36:29] situations we know we're in a spiritual
[1:36:32] battle we don't fight against the
[1:36:35] flesh we don't fight against
[1:36:38] humans we don't fight against flesh and
[1:36:40] blood I just going to read one more
[1:36:42] scripture if I can okay you with me Paul
[1:36:45] said in Corinthians chapter 10:3 for
[1:36:48] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[1:36:51] war like the flesh when you read the Old
[1:36:54] Testament you see nothing but fleshly
[1:36:57] battles swords and killing
[1:37:01] and look even when they came to
[1:37:07] get
[1:37:09] Jesus and one of Peter's Brothers in the
[1:37:14] church sold Jesus out for 30 pieces of
[1:37:18] silver and they came to get Jesus and
[1:37:22] Jesus and Peter drew his
[1:37:24] [Applause]
[1:37:26] sword and he was getting ready to start
[1:37:28] taking care of
[1:37:30] business standing for what's
[1:37:34] right nobody's going to treat my family
[1:37:37] like
[1:37:38] that not going to come against my
[1:37:43] Jesus and he took his sword and he cut a
[1:37:47] part of the servant's ear off of his
[1:37:52] enemy and immediately you would think
[1:37:56] Jesus would have said hey that's a great
[1:37:58] things thanks for standing with
[1:38:00] me but he didn't say
[1:38:02] that he said Peter put your sword
[1:38:08] away they that kill with the sword will
[1:38:12] end up dying with the
[1:38:14] sword in other words what you sow
[1:38:17] spiritually you're going to reap right
[1:38:20] amen you want to be negative you want to
[1:38:22] talk negative you don't want to cover
[1:38:24] your brother you you want to just take
[1:38:26] things into your own way it's going to
[1:38:29] come at you that's just all there is to
[1:38:31] it because see every seed brings forth
[1:38:33] of its own
[1:38:35] kind every
[1:38:37] seed I just love the spirit of the Lord
[1:38:40] he just picked up that ear and he put it
[1:38:42] back on the
[1:38:43] servant he healed him is a reality we
[1:38:47] can have the power of God in our life
[1:38:50] this is not a story that I just seen on
[1:38:52] TV one time this is the word of God that
[1:38:54] was true and God is the same yesterday
[1:38:57] today and forever let's finish reading
[1:38:59] this all right for though we walk in the
[1:39:02] flesh we do not war after the flesh our
[1:39:06] our our battle is not in the fleshly
[1:39:09] realm it is in the inside of man the
[1:39:13] spirit of man for the weapons of our
[1:39:16] Warfare are not carnal but they're
[1:39:19] Mighty through God to the pwing down of
[1:39:22] strongholds
[1:39:23] casting down
[1:39:27] imaginations imagination is a gate right
[1:39:30] yes and I'm saying that gate was given
[1:39:31] to us for good if we had time we could
[1:39:33] go into that but there are wrong
[1:39:37] imaginations casting down imaginations
[1:39:40] and every High
[1:39:43] thing that exalteth
[1:39:46] itself against the word of
[1:39:52] God
[1:39:54] every High thing H you don't got to do
[1:39:56] that that's a high thing that's exalting
[1:39:59] that's that's exalting against the
[1:40:02] word and bring it into captivity put it
[1:40:06] into a
[1:40:07] cage every thought to The Obedience of
[1:40:12] Christ every
[1:40:16] thought God has got to be the god of our
[1:40:20] mind not just our heart
[1:40:23] of our mind he's got to be the
[1:40:27] gatekeeper in our mind and having in a
