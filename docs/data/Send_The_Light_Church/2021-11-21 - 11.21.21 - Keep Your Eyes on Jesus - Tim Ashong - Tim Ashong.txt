for the provisions that you've made for us thank you so much for eternal life and thank you for this physical life all your blessings we say thank you we don't have words to express our appreciation but we say let the words of our mouth and the meditation of our heart be acceptable in thy sight cleanse us from our own righteousness o dear lord and fill us with thy holy spirit that power from on eye the power of the eyes let that overshadow us so that christ will be born in us whatever your sons and daughters are gathered this morning we commit them into your hands may your holy spirit minister unto thy children that christ and christ and christ alone will be magnified thank you heavenly father in the name of jesus christ our lord we ask your blessings upon the reading of your word and everything in jesus name we pray amen god bless you and you are welcome to the house of the lord this morning and it's always a privilege to be in his house and we are looking forward to the time when we will cross over this life and go on the other side where we'll be with our lord and our savior throughout eternity what a day that will be may the lord give grace and strength to us to keep pressing on the upward way so you are welcome in the name of jesus christ let's open to genesis chapter 3. genesis 3 we read some few lines from genesis 3 and then we also read from isaiah 45 and also from matthew chapter 14 just few verses and we so let's read genesis 6 3 i mean genesis 3 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto a husband with a and he did it amen so isaiah 45 is reason when we read that we can see them and they will do the rest isaiah 45 isaac 45 is 22. look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none s shall be seated and i want to read from matthew chapter 14. let's read matthew 14 verse 28 and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when peter was camped out of the sheep he walked under water to go to jesus but when he saw the wind bostros he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me amen maybe we'll read one more scripture and that is from hebrews hebrews chapter 12. [Music] wherefore same we also are compassed about we so great a crowd of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endure the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the throne of god amen so we thank god for the reading of the scriptures we love to read it because the way to grow as a christian is to read your bible every day and pray every day that's how you can grow that's how you can be you know spiritual read the bible and pray i mean and as you read you pray lord let your spirit come upon it reveal it to me because many people read and they don't see it so it takes the only ghost to reveal it because the holy ghost wrote the word so when the holy ghost wrote the word when the holy ghost come upon you it will reveal it to you so we need the revelation of the word of the lord we pray that as we read may the holy spirit reveal it to us as we listen to it may the holy spirit reveal it to us because you know there are many that are educated and you know scholars and this and they read it and they don't see it they don't see the reading yeah yeah my son don't see it you read ah you know repent and be baptized i don't see it but i read it so it takes the spirit of god to reveal and to obey one's spiritual eyes and spiritual understanding so we thank god that to know god it is not by education but it is by revelation and god has to reveal himself to a man if god doesn't do it you there is no way for you to make it because god is so great and then it can be so simple he hides in simplicity and he reveals himself in simplicity and sometimes we are looking for a way up and he's right down here and so we miss him and it has if anybody has come to know god it's because god revealed it because the scripture says brethren know your calling many mighty men are after the flesh not many nobles but god has revealed this thing to beaves such as we learn amen so god has to reveal himself amen and that is the only way we can know him and jesus said father i thank you because lord you've eaten these things to the wise and reveal it no one can know the father accept his review to you no one can understand except the father revealing to you amen so we are blessed amen to know the things that we have known to hear the things that we have had what a privileged people we are we bless the name of the lord every day should be thanksgiving day in our lives you don't have to wait for one year before you give thanks to god every day should be a thanksgiving day when you wake up from your bed it says thank you lord every step you thank the lord for it when you drink water you thank the lord for it whatever movement we turn the love for it because without him we can do nothing we can't walk without him we can't do anything with that thing so our lives should be full of thanksgiving and praises to the living god hallelujah and i want us to speak this morning on keep your eyes on jesus keep your eyes on him because what you look at affects your life what you look at affect your life and so you can be affected in a positive way or in a negative way so there is something about what you look at amen that's why you see a lot of adverts all around us adverts all around you get step out and you look around advent of food advert of clothing advert of this advent of that and we make our choices by what we look at amen praise the lord you take care you shouldn't get out and you see these uh boats and the sun you know make some sandwich and some thick bacon and so and sometimes you want to lick the air so i'm good that's what i'm looking for what you saw it so what you see remember the eyes is an outlet and it's a gateway to your soul so what you look at affects your life has impact on your life and the enemy knows that and is using it very much in this day that's true amen so you see our average and women and this one and this one and naked women and and and all kinds of adverts do you think he's there for without the purpose that is a purpose for it right there is a spirit behind it right that's right what you look at affect your life so keep your eyes on jesus the scripture we read from genesis speak to us about if our first mother the mother of all living amen and when the lord put them in the garden the garden of eden when god has created all things everything was so beautiful and god said this is good this is nice this is beautiful and then he brought his son and his wife into the garden the headquarters of the earth so stay here and then he instructed them and gave them his word and he said to them of all that is in this beautiful place the only thing i'm telling you eat of everything by the tree of knowledge of good and evil don't touch it let me tell you and then we were taught in the scriptures that the enemy came in and when he came in ah he he he just looked at the woman and he spoke to the woman and he said ah did god tell you to eat of every three that is in this place he said no that's not what goes through it he said we should eat of all but this particular thing which is the tree of knowledge of good and evil we shall not partake of it because god said the day we take it we shall die and the bible said when the woman saw the tree she saw the tree she looked at it that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took it took up the fruit of it she saw that tree the prophet said that is where she made a mistake because she stopped to look she stopped to listen and that's where we all make our mistakes many of us we mess up our lives our experiences we mind it by just stopping and looking by turning our eyes from the lord amen right and we tend to reasoning and when she did she lost everything she was stripped off the glory of god departed what she thought she could get out of it she didn't even get it satan always present peaches before that right and he tells you you will get this and you'll be smart and you'll be this and you'll be dead so the enemy came to them and stripped them right by just looking stop and look so keep your eyes on the word of the lord because god and his word is the same in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god a man and his word is the same so god and his word is the same amen keep your eyes on the lord in his word why he told them josh you have god speaking to joshua said don't deviate to the right or to the left right that which moses my servant has given to you don't move from the right don't go to the left that is don't put your interpretation to it don't try to find wisdom don't try don't add don't make it any better amen you cannot make it better right you cannot improve upon what god says you can't make it better god always gives the best and god's word does not need any mass interpretation you can make it better why are we in the condition we are in today because somebody thought it could make it better you cannot make it better right because god gives the best amen you are in a mess today we are in a mess today because we thought we can make it better we thought we can make it better we thought we know more than god we thought we had better idea but you don't get better ideas if you think of any better idea you are deceived right amen amen amen the whole world is deceived because they thought they can make something better than what god has given who are you to make anything better than what god has given amen are we together god always gives the best he is the creator he is the almighty he is the giver of life and he know what you need so we don't even know our needs we only want this and we want that we want that but he knows our needs he knows your needs and our peace is in obedience to his word amen you cannot disobey his word and have peace no man that ever disobeyed god's word has peace and that is why this world has no peace because the prince of peace has been rejected you can't disobey the word of the lord drinking does not satisfy womanizing will not satisfy nothing will bring you peace peace will only come when you receive jesus as your lord amen will you accept him as your savior will you obey his word that is when you have peace because jesus said my peace i give unto you amen not as the word gifts how can somebody run after somebody's wife and they have peace no way how can somebody commit adultery and has peace no way right how can somebody be drinking and smoking and womanizing and happiness no way it is just violent substitutes right it's true yes you can never have peace by disobeying the word of the lord and that is why this word is in a condition it is today because we thought we know better than god and the more we go into things the more we become confused so the word leaders and the word itself is confused that's why some people are confused they think that they have been trapped in a male's body or in the woman's body you are confused you are perfected you have lost your mind the word of god is perfect the word of god is forever settled in heaven you cannot add to the word or take us from the world and have peace that's why we are in the condition we are in today because in the beginning they thought they could act right now god said the day you eat of this tree you shall surely die and the enemy came and said you shall not surely die what happened what happened death for the witness of sin is death what is sin drinking is not sin smoking is not sin womanizing is not sin fighting and fasting and this sin is unbelief of god's word when you dis disbelief and disobey the word of the lord that's when you will drink that's when you will smoke that's when you will behave and do all kinds of because you have disbelief the way if you believe god's word you will not do it so when god created man and god put man here god gave instructions what man should do and what man should not do like i always said to people when you buy these machines here gadgets or whatever they are computers and whatever you have a book and they call it the manual they give you the manual a little booklet and they say read it before you operate the machine read it so the manual shows you what to fix here and what not to fix that right sure put this one there and and plug this block and put this where it gives you all the instructions right right if you don't follow the instructions you will not get your machines working correctly stabilizers and amplifier and this one and you know for the sound put this one there put it and it gives you guidance because the composer or the manufacturer or the inventor that invented wrote the book okay this is the way to go about this this is the way to do this and the creator of creation amen the creator of creation give us that book the manual that's the bible that is his word and it tells you men live this way women live this way children to this he gave us the manual the book of life the book of instruction and he said look if you want to have peace do this and as long as men obey his word we had peace on earth the day they disobeyed the word of the lord peace was taken out from the earth death was introduced right that's true disobedience to the word of god brings death that is why we are dying because men disobey the creator the manufacturer the designer the inventor and when we disappear him and man lost his way right it's true we lost our way we became stranger one dress because he was the man and the woman they were placed in the beautiful garden and they were everything was under their control and the sun and the music and everything but now when they disobey the word of almighty god they were driven out their choice took them out of their peace their choice they made to disobey the word of god took them out their protesting their defense everything that they had they lost it right that's true and that is why today men are wondering women are wondering we've lost our past we don't even know what is right again we lost our senses yes man man that's crazy wandering from place to place and so he think when i smoke i'll be happy when i drink i'll be happy when i i walk like a a hollywood star i'll be happy when i wear this kind of shoe i'll be happy so when god make you to be working like now you want to walk like this yes you're not happy you're not afraid right it's true because medically it's not even sound for you right it's true if you give back to your child and the child is like this you want to go to doctor whatever to do something about it praise the name of the lord amen well you might not like what i'm saying but i'm saying it because it's the truth i'm telling you hallelujah we lost our way so what is wrong we take it to be right and we take the wrong to be right and the right to be wrong what is crazy we take it to be right how can somebody take money and go and buy crazy jeans that is stolen here what do you talk about before then will anybody wear that kind of a paint jesus never never wear it right so we are getting more crazy brother problem before christ comes he said human we go totally insane true that's right insanity yes right that's right that's where we are that's right dr insanity oh god have mercy upon us and help us as children of god to realize where we are and what is happening today so that we can take refuge under the cross amen right to the cross back to the word of the lord for that is where we got protection amen oh there is a birmingham amen the holy ghost is there to be another with the birmingham heal us and deliver that amen come back and turn your eyes on jesus the word amen amen amen that's right are we together may the lord help us brethren the time is very late you can see and i'm saying to you it will never get better that's right it's true we have crossed the line yes sir that's right we have crossed the line it's not going to get better it's going deep down down down down down praise the lord amen look at it women used to dress before men go look go back into the back centuries and see the way people were dressing bring it to today it's different that's right the more civilized we become the more we lose his hope on god we are just going because we think all this will make us better this will make us happy we are not getting any better we are not getting any better we are getting confused more because we have left the word of god when you get back to god you get sense you get the right mind you will be healed that's right bible says let this mind which was in christ be in you to get the mind of christ you must lose your own mind amen that's right what makes you to think that you know better and you are smarter you are listening that you don't know better when you reject god's word you don't know better if you know anything the bible says letting that boost boast that he knows god amen depending on god amen amen hallelujah may god help us please don't be annoyed with me but even if you annoy that it's all right that's your choice yeah i cannot stop you but i'm just listening to the word of the lord and strengthen your lives let us straighten our lives look back to jesus christ because there is no way that we can come the world will come out of this condition no way america is not coming out right no nation is coming out the nations have crossed the line they've rejected god they've left god behind and they want to do their own things and once you leave god behind there is no way right so i've said to you young men and young women mothers and fathers husbands and wives parents get back to christ it is the word amen amen in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and blood to give us life yes praise god may the lord help our sins of god and may the lord help each and every one of us in this crucial hour that we are living here look to god keep your eyes on him on the lord jesus christ don't turn your eyes from me amen the prophet of god said there are so many voices on the land today so many things that are calling for attention it's about the only voice that worth attending to is the voice of the spirit he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches so we saw in the book of isaiah that the lord god almighty speaking and he said look unto me are ye ends of the earth in this hour jehovah cross attention to his creation to his nation to his people say look look to me i am the answer look to me i am the way look to me i am the truth look to me i am the resurrection look to me i am the healer look to me i am the provider look to me for salvation amen for deliverance the bomb of gilead the great healer the great physician the great deliverance look to me the creator is calling his creation and his creatures you didn't create me i created you you don't know more than me i know more than you hallelujah how can you know more than the inventor somebody invented something how can you know more than that's right how can we say we know more than the creator right true who are you and who bone you do you think in yourself that you know more than the creator the creator that created you that fix your body sometimes i go to i said god you don't need any laboratory tests or s3 to know what is wrong in my body because you created my body and you know all about it and i pray lord any abnormality in my system will make it right that's right when the doctor should go do this and take your blood and do this that's all fine but god don't need that to work the doctor medical science needed but god don't need it and god said i am the lord that he let all your diseases he is still the lord that he let all our diseases when the doctors have come to their awake end and the physicians have come to their witness he said i am the healer turn to me look to me amen look to me i will do it for you look to the creator oh hallelujah oh lord help us yes we've looked enough to this right side and the left side and to our neighbors and to this one and to that man and to that woman and god said now look to me oh it depends it depends on what you look at but if god makes a promise god is obligated to keep that promise no matter what the circumstance no matter what the circumstance god is able to keep his promise so look to me you know when we look around us we feared you remember the children of israel when god brought them out of egypt and they came to the promised land and then in the days of somewhere the children of israel came to somewhere and what did they say what was their request make us a king so that would be like the other nations they look at the other nations they look at the other people all these other church this other denomination this other this make us a king so that will be like that right so they despise god they rejected the path of god they rejected the word of god because the word of god was to lead them by the way of a prophet right it was true amen a prophet with a stick in his hands a wrought in his hands right who was leading it was somewhere the prophet when they were going to war somewhere when they were doing it somewhere when they needed somewhere the prophet was leading them because that is god's provided way surely the lord god will do nothing but reveal his secrets unto his servants the prophets but they despise the way of the lord sorry amen praise the lord hallelujah yeah i'm getting charged up now come on amen praise the lord amen what if you think i'm crazy that's okay you got to be crazy you know someone every one of us is crazy in some ways so it's all fine paul said the way that people call her you see that is the way i worship the god of my fathers so that's fellow is very strange oh yeah that you see that fellow strange but you don't know you're also strange there's something strange about everybody yeah you can see somebody said somebody has to tell you your own. praise the lord may god give us grace hallelujah they look around and they say oh i want to be like that one oh human beings we despise what we are right what god has made us we don't thank you for what he has given us oh but you want to be somebody else and you don't even know that somebody also wants to be like you right we are never satisfied but when you get christ the bible says godliness with contentment is a great game for we brought nothing into this life and we are not taking nothing with us [Music] godliness with contentment don't despise what god has given to you what god has made you that's right be thankful to god amen for what he has blessed you with that's right you see when you look at others you look at this one and this one before me and this one has more than me you will never be satisfied you will never be content because you are just looking here looking there and looking there when you should thank god for what he has blessed you with that's true make us a king how some people might be desiring to have a prophet to lead them to guide them you understand it in the days of elijah or elijah and the king the king of syria they gathered together anytime they plan to attack israel elijah reveres it like your elisha and he says don't go here don't go there because they are coming and so the king of syria called a cabinet meeting and he said which of you in this camp belong to israel who is sparing for his right who who is doing that either because anytime we plan to attack them and somehow they get to know who is doing that and one might say sir no no fashion he said right there they have a prophet there amen there is a man that has the script of the living god a prophet there and whatever you plant in your secret that must seize it amen and you reverse it what else do you want if you don't like this which one you like is the man that reveals our secrets to the man to the israelites oh really does anybody know where that man is oh yes that man is in duty okay you know where he said yes we do okay send a battalion go and bring the man you are not correct the man that knows and sees you in your bedroom and you are taught and everything you said that you got arrested won't you see it right because when you want to attack others you will tell them you are coming to attack what about when you are to attack yourself and they send the people to go and arrest elijah and then when they were coming a whole battalion and biasy the seventh of elijah when they woke up in the morning he saw that the whole place was packed with army and characters we are finished he said what is happening we are surrounded surrounded by he said look at the students around us don't worry about that did that happen us and more than they are amen saints don't die with us and more than those that are against amen for us who can be jesus the bible says the angels of god and come run about the righteousness i want to remind you and i want to declare to you and i want to say to you again that once we are here this morning there are thousands and thousands and thousands of angels right here the angels of god are yet left and kept running about us there is nothing to worry there is nothing to fear because the angels of god are here for and brother brown said they came with us to church and they go with us back home he said the angels of god they are always with us they are always around us or when we knew this we know about these things and we believe it it takes away fear and worry so elijah said i don't know what it does that i will first have more than he look around he has a look around i don't see anybody you might not see anybody but they are here you may not feel anybody but they are here because it's not our feeling it is not your feeling it's your belief it is the word what you believe the word or your feeling i want to believe the word that is god believe what god says believe what god says not your feelings hallelujah the word of god says i am with you i will not leave you and i will not forsake you believe the word of the lord keep your eyes on jesus keep your eyes on his promise stay with the promise it will never fail and like i said because the young man was troubled all these prophets he said that more people i don't see anybody too but you

something happened there jacob and the animals his father-in-law animals and jacob fix some streets and when the fatty heavy hexical strong ones want to give birth he brings them to that kind of that gutter and he said the streets before them and they look at it and when they look at it when they are going to give when they get back to what they were looking at yes because he and 11 were at the cross and laban has tried to you know at waiting but he didn't know that jacob himself is a smart guy yeah yeah his matter the laban is his father in law it's okay we're gonna make a deal when the animals are giving birth all that aspect us let that be mine so you will be the plain ones here and there so he faced these things these streets together took some trees and feed together and he put the animals right in that street and their eyes is set on that street that jacob made and then they look at this so much that when they give it they give back to that amen what you look at you benefit amen it's true you produce it amen true that's really good it's exciting what you look at god right into you yeah right it's true so what are you looking at today amen amen that's why today you have all these things when we look at the televisions and things i say now now now it depends on what you look at it depends on what you look at he said the word true television through riddle through the picture shows and those athletes day now has come and bring pollution to the land when tv is becoming rotten and radios and newspapers and all the athletes of advertisement the thing just constantly cigarettes tobacco whiskey and drinking an immoral dress woman it's affecting people right it has threatened the whole world it's true if you want to go to you know buy things and you take this booklet or whatever they have or whatever flies flies so that you are not even ready to buy but you look to the floors oh it's unsafe there's another one here so that you have not even make budget for that but as you look at it you look at it and you are enticed yes yes let me go to the mall and come yeah you cut all those stickers or whatever because they give you okay that's a they could say you know they give some discount on it right what you look at so we go and buy unnecessary things things that we don't need right but the i just saw it yes that's why as we are sitting there clothes you have never worked for five years they are in your wardrobe five years ten years you don't even know what to do with it it's there and yet you can't throw it away you are buying more and yet you go to the small you see it again you want to take it i yeah what you look at that's true turn your eyes on jesus i will not take much of your time but i just love the lord i have a liberty in the spirit and i feel very good amen i think we need these things amen to remind us not that we don't know that we are building [Music] is affecting us that's true it's weakening our faith what you look at listen we have challenges but you know we are not asked to look at the challenges that we are having it depends on what you look at if you look at your afflictions you will never go away go any further if you look at your afflictions you will never go any further you will never so it is time for you to turn your eyes from those afflictions oh the doctor said this and i'm feeling this do you know that when this pandemic broke and people were reading so much about it reading so much about it look until they say i have the thing i mean brother i have the thing you have is i have the thing the sickness the virus i said you don't have it many people read it they listen to it and they begin to listen to their body and they begin to claim the disease they begin to claim their vitals but they didn't have nothing maybe you are still in that condition but if you're in that condition wake up out of that condition and if you can read about the coronavirus and these viruses and add virus and add blood pressure and this one and you remember begin to adjust that oh you have this disease you have this many many of us it's just our mind it's in our mind that i got this i'm in contact with this i'm sorry and you are not suffering from nothing let's read the bible amen let's read the word amen let's feed on the word read it and read it and look at it until you become what you are looking at until you become the world feed on the world because what your eye is looking at is fitting that's right that's right but abraham said let me come to your office or to your house and let me see the pictures you are looking at and the music you listen to i know what your soul is feeding on because you are what you eat what you look at what you feed on is what you become the food that you eat become part of you so you are what you are feeding on so what are you feeding on if we are feeding on god's word we expect it to grow stretch our ways and flop our ways and be courageous and be bold and stand for the word what are you feeding on blood of christ because flesh manner has been given to us a fresh manner the world has been open jesus christ the mighty god has been unveiled fit on the word amen read the word it's the word for in the book of revelation john was told take the book right take the book from the right hand of the angel and when you take the book hide it under your bed and you take the he said to john go take that book amen from the right turn of the angel and when you take the book eat it amen feed on it amen and when you feed on it you become what you are feeling amen and he said prophesy testify amen witness what you are freedom testify of it speak about it yes what are we doing today turn your eyes upon jesus what you look at if you look at your afflictions hey you're not going to get out of it you remember in the scriptures jonah when he was swallowed by the fish and the fish went to the bottom of the sea and the fish was there lying down there jonah said i'm not going to look at where i am now it's a day that observed live vanities forsake their own message he said i'm going to look at the temple he said because when solomon was dedicating the temple solomon said lord if your people backslide if the people disobey if the people do wrong and they are casted out and they go to strange land and whatever happens today and they are there and they remember and they repent and they pray towards the temple hear their prayers so jonah in the belly of the fish and black slider his hands have been tied he didn't know what to do he said i remember what hey i don't know how it turned but he turned to the temple he said look to the temple i'm not going to look around what is around me the weights and the uniformity and they are now i'm not going to look at that that's right the doctor said it's complication yes it's complete but i'm not going to look at that the doctor says i'm suffering with cancer yes but i'm not looking at that that's personal and he prayed and god spoke to the fish why don't you think turn to the temple jesus christ why don't you take to the temple why don't you turn to jesus jonathan to the physical temple right and jesus is our temple he's our god he's our problem he's the great physician the king of the world hey why don't you take to the word he said i'm not going to consider these things around me i'm not going to consider what the doctor says i'm not going to consider what my neighbor and really say i'm going to consider one thing that is the word the word says so i am the lord amen i am the lord your deliverer i am the lord the resurrection amen i am the lord the captain of the house of israel amen amen amen and god when jonah prayed god spoke to the fish what almighty god we are saying he spoke to the fish hey fish get up go and draw me to jonah take him out he missed his way take him to the right place and god directed the fish where to go what almighty god we are saving he directed the fish go here go and go throw him out here and the fish obey everything the beast our creator why should we worry again may god help us to know that everything obeys our creator our creator is in control our savior is in control amen lord help us amen and he spoke to the fish and the fish went and vomited jonah and i'm saying whatever you have been swallowed whatever habit whatever character whatever attitude whatever problem whatever need i'll swallow you may god release you yes amen amen may you be formidable may you be set free amen may you be delivered from frustration from depression from oppression from diseases whatever they are make them be free but the power of the almighty god in the name of jesus christ he is the same yesterday remember the bible said he sent forth his word to heal the people amen i'm not a healer is not a healer but he is our healer jesus christ he is our healer jesus christ is our savior jesus christ oh my mother said this oh my father said this even in my place of where there is challenges even in my family that is oh yes there are challenges and there'll be challenges don't look at that don't look at that look at the way look at the truth look at the line that is the word amen oh hallelujah you know when you look at problems problems will sink you you will not be able to eat you lose appetite right so i don't feel like eating don't depend on fulfilling act when you look at this around you and this brother disappointed me my wife disappointed me husband disciple this hey look to the one who does not disappoint he doesn't disappoint and he will not fail look to him amen all things working together for good amen to those who love the lord amen something might be happening around you that you think well i should not be that way the end but hey jehovah has earned everything you cannot expect this because he's god hey he is god let us learn to trust him amen to cast our case of believer to depend on me knowing that we are not here by accident right oh hallelujah this will happen that you don't even understand but god might have designed that to save your life to give you something better amen oh what a wonderful savior brethren i believe in god i love him and i'm just to encourage you let's go forward amen amen we don't understand many things like i said i've said it maybe testify you know when i married first i lost my wife my first wife i just married her for one year and she died i lost her with her baby she was pregnant for about eight months i lost everything the doctor told me oh sorry young man if i was here even i would have operated right in the world and take the baby out but god knows everything it was difficult kind of you know disappointed wow what and i was thinking how am i going to face the world yeah because it was about 1985 i think in 1998 and we preached this gospel we had a misabilities messenger and that was the first time somebody died in our little group we're just young man i was about 26 years or something i had 25 hours on this yes and a young man andre just married your wife sweet little wife i just go to the hospital in the morning to see her she was feeling not really fine then yes i think about one week some few days in the hospital and i went there he said he said that tomorrow when you are coming bring me this and bring me that so don't worry i'll get it to you honey and i think that i didn't get it he said that i want to go home i said don't worry you'll be destroyed you go home but the next day i got there wow the necessity said wait a little wait something might have happened yeah my heart was my beating i waited they said they don't know how to release the news to me reveal it i said i won't listen yeah sorry say hey trouble don't help me and i said okay anyway let me see where is she they say she's on the bed i go to the ward i bed where she was and i saw a line down there i was sweeping anyway crying but then something said to my heart god don't make mistakes that's right right and that settles for me and i said god you don't make mistake and i said god this is not a mistake that my wife should die it's not a mistake and i said god if this is your will i'm going to serve you i will save it i don't understand i don't know i'm going to face the world because they know of preaching this oh how am i going to face the world after preaching and preaching how am i going to face the people because are they ah my goodness sandra i said god help me help me i don't know i'm gonna do it but help me because i know one thing you don't make mistakes and i'm gonna save you and people begin to say when after the news got into town i got the old time that was in january this coming january will be about 36 or 37 years experience i'm talking about and then the news got interesting some people were saying since they will not respect anything because we're preaching against denominations and preaching against this and preach look at what has happened if he's serving god right would this thing happen to him everybody is bound to their own opinions and to their own ideas people will say whatever they want to say but that's not what i'm looking at right i'm looking at the word of the lord and others say oh this boy will not be able to serve god again this boy will start to drink this one will do this and that and that by god's grace i'm still on amen [Applause] amen stronger than before amen god gave me another wife after four years i got married and a beautiful woman nice god gave it to me and i have five children four boys amen god gave it to me god knows everything amen you've got to be tried you're going to be tested but don't look at those testing don't look don't look at your afflictions don't look you know everybody in his own trial somebody your trial will be your husband or your wife will be your trial or your neighbor will be your trailer or your whatever your pet anything can be your past any situation whatever the master desires whatever the master allows amen keep your eyes on the lord amen not on your trials not on your afflictions oh this one has disappointed me and that's when i disappointed do you know that something god will let everybody disappoint you he does it everybody will disappoint you everybody will despise you right to see what you will do no i don't think the people love me but one thing's sure if the people don't love you god loves me he that said i will not leave you and i will not forsake you many people today are out of check because they think nobody loves them right and that is the devil speaking to them that's right that's the devil speaking oh this one don't love me even my husband nobody understands me but god understands you amen amen so if you keep your eyes on the people and their asses and their behavior towards you you will sink you will go into depression you'll be imprisoned by those demons and then you want to live in isolation with anybody that's demons that's right that's evil spirit and that spirit wants to destroy your life if you are here in that condition get out of it amen amen god is what to heal you amen not to feel sad not to feel pitiful in yourself that's demons that's evil spirit he wants to destroy you i don't trust anybody you don't dress that's a dreamer evil spirit get out of that amen and turn your eyes on jesus don't be looking at your afflictions this one think like this don't look at that you are not going to answer for what anybody is taking right whatever everybody thinks they will answer to that you will answer to god for your behavior amen amen amen lord help us you love jesus amen somebody will give a clap of faith to jesus hallelujah praise the lord jesus christ god loves you god loves us listen when god revealed this thing to us the enemy is exposed and when the enemy is exposed he becomes powerless and the world comes to free us we are free god is setting you free god is losing you god is opening the past are you coming free don't be looking at yourself because you will sink don't be looking at the position around you will sink don't be looking at the mountains you will sink look to the solution look to the answer the answer is the word jesus christ i am the way i am the truth and i have the life look to the life man what makes people to be coming drunk at this and smoking because they spoke i'm disappointed in this one and that's why my mama papa i'm disappointed or i i'm disappointed in myself i i i i i i'm not able to do what i want to do turn over to jesus amen don't be looking at yourself there is nothing good you look to him because if you're going to achieve anything it will come through jesus christ hallelujah oh praise the name of the lord amen may god help us yes lord help us keep your eyes on jesus do you know what why the children of israel didn't enter the promised land because instead of looking to the promise they were looking at the amorites god said i am giving you the light i have given you the land of the canaanites and the anakin he said the lannis for you yes and moses sent the spies to go and they went around the city and when they came back 10 12 spies went 10 majority then of the spies came back with an evil report now it depends on what you look at many of the spies that went to spite the land came back ten of them and brought back bad report we can't do it it will destroy it will my are bigger than we are that's their report right they said it is a land that divorces inhabitants and in our own eyes they look at the obstacles they look at the giants they look at the problems oh look at this one and look at this one and look at look at the other brother did this look at the other sister did it look at the other one hey the devil will always point you to the one who didn't do it right i didn't do it and that brother and that sister did it what about the sister who is doing well why don't you look at the sister or the brother that is doing well amen why do you always want to put man focus on them on the negative right when there are positive things there are positive things in your wives and positive things in your husband and positive things in your wife and positive positive things in our children why don't you look at that positive one why don't you look at the positive everyday negative and negative and negative and you become negative we can take the life look at this look at that age they were imprisoned by what they look at because look at this they are giants they are this and that and something look at that says you think your suffering your disease or whatever the doctors say cannot be cured cannot be healed you think it is too big for god to heal you oh this one has died out of that and that one died out of this and this one that but listening healing does not belong to all limited to your age right true no matter your age whether you're 100 years or 200 years or five years or two years it doesn't matter to god right right it changed abraham when he was 100 years old the man that said can a man that is hundred years ago a child is born to him after he read yes he was still giving birth right god healed him amen so that saint god can do no matter your age no matter what you are suffering from today god can heal you amen amen in the same today yesterday and forever so it does not matter it does not matter how many years you have suffered it does not matter what we are suffering now it does not matter who has died out of that disease or who has not died it does not matter to god what matters is your belief in god amen amen jesus said do you believe right even he said did you feel right do you believe even when he came to the grave of lazarus mata said to him lord i know if you have been here my brother will not have time but now that you're here i know whatever you say all the fathers have been done to you jesus said where do you bury him that's why we married him and jesus said take the stone from there if you believe you will see the glory of god amen get that stone let's tell his heart for god nothing is sad for god and nothing is hard for you is that me yes if god can believe and pretend i believe all things are possible so all things are possible with you as it is possible with god if you believe god's word amen are you wondering that's the word of the lord amen hallelujah amen praise the lord lord help us amen listen i'm very happy saving jesus christ and i have so much liberty in me that's the way i preach at home so i'm just i thought if i don't feel like i will not be preaching but i'm very much comfortable thank you thank don't limit god amen stop looking at the things around you here and this one did this hey as long as we live here somebody will do what you don't like that's the truth are you understanding that as long as we are here your wife your husband your best friend somebody will do something that you don't like and because when you look at those things tomorrow friendship is broken the liberty is gone then friction comes in you know we used to be foreign what have you not done to your life what have you not done have you not disappointed anybody before right have you not done what you are not expected to do before so why let's stop looking at the negative and look at the positives amen to the positive hold on to the word oh god help us yes help us don't look around you look to jesus look to jesus like the way elisha look at elijah amen when the light that told elisha the lord is going to take me with what you want me to do for you he said i want double portion of your spirit don't be afraid to ask for big things we limit ourselves we think god can only take health they can back it he can't do anything amen he meant too much to disappear he cancer we read and listen to the things even people with that eyeballs god created it right come on amen until the brand says oh little girl i didn't ask you the color of eyes that you want what color of eye do you want if i want blue eyes i give it to you god damn it because we believe god will do it and if you believe god will do it give it to it amen ask for victims god is not afraid don't fear for god amen brother don't fear from god church don't fear for god is more than able amen hallelujah keep your eyes on amen elijah said if you see me when i'm taken i will get it if you see me keep your eye and elisha kept his eye because in like that today what you have asked his bigot is hard but all the same if you can see me you'll get it so elijah kept his eyes on elijah please please don't be looking around please it is time to turn your face and turn your eyes on jesus amen he is our peace as i close let me say about peter jesus was walking on the water they thought it was a ghost they thought it was a spirit and he said don't be afraid it's me it's me don't be afraid please it's me then they were just family and peter said lord if it is you then let me also walk let me walk on the world don't be afraid to ask for big things amen amen if it is you let me walk on the water they have never seen anybody walking on water and jesus i am doing it he said like we also do the work that i do the weather i and you shall also do those who believe in me don't limit god keep your eyes on me amen we should not be afraid to ask god right if we ask him he wants to do it he will do it right but the problem says when god said no is no cease and belief not just ask and believe amen hallelujah praise the lord jesus peter said if it is you let me also walk jesus said kind you just step you are on the water and he started walking oh wow he was working he was walking until he came from jesus when he take his eyes from jesus and he began to look at the words he came to his side he began to rise what is it it begins to sink if you put your eyes you turn your eyes from jesus you will sing that is why many people are sinking today right it's true it's true in their work with christ they are sinking because they've missed their focus instead of keeping our eyes on him we want to read about this one we want to find fault to the prophet we want to find form with our wives we want to fight forward and so when you begin to do that equation it brings strives and then our work is mere man a you want to find out where the prophet made a mistake or what you mess yourself up what will you have done in the days of abraham when the man has told life and that don't lie you talk about me like the woman is not my wife it's my sister because the bible says he was a friend that will kill him so he says stop my wife tell them that you are not my wife tell them you are my sister i said i also say yes he's my brother and that's true but the grace of god came down before being like we touched sarah god said hey that woman is that man's wife he said no the woman told me that is the brother and the man also told me that i said i don't care what they told you that man is my prophet and that is his wife oh but your prophet he told lie hey god said give that woman back immediately to that man give the woman back if you don't i strike everything dead in your land for the sake of that man and more so let him pray for you because that is the only prayer i will hear the only one that will pray and i will hear an answer in that manner god wants you to have confidence in the prophet don't look at the shock coming don't look at anyone's mistake don't let's just stop that this one no no no stop it keep your eyes on jesus peter turned his eyes and he began to go down but you know the wonderful story he cried lord save me amen let's walk with jesus and we'll pass through the storms we'll walk on the water we'll make it to the end amen god be with you and god bless you let your eyes stay on him he is the word if you have never surrendered your life to him surrender to him accept him as your lord and savior amen if you are back sleeping or backslided recommit your life to him whatever be your challenges young people don't look at your challenges he's the answer yes keep your eyes on him he knows what to do he knows how to open the way through the red scene he know how to pack the waters for you amen he knows out you might where am i going what what am i going to do but let's see the one that opened the red sea is the same with us today they can open the sea for us amen the one that makes the voice of jericho to fall they can make the worst around you to fall any injuries any power on your way against your life is he able to break it to break the shackles lose you keep your eyes for me god be with you and god bless you amen have a wonderful thanksgiving and when you pray remember me i'll be 63 on tuesday remember me in your prayers my desire is to continue to save and to preach the gospel and to encourage the people of god to save the living god i'm determined by his
