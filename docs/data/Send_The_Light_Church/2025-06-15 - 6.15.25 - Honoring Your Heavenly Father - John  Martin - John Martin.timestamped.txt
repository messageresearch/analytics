[36:54] Yesterday I I wish I was holding on to

[37:00] I was uh standing on a chair yesterday
[37:02] and trying to get
[37:05] um the grill plugged in, trying to run
[37:08] the electrical.
[37:10] And it was a chair like this
[37:13] and I had to get off the chair and and
[37:15] move it so I could uh adjust cords. And
[37:20] when I did, lo and behold, our dear dog
[37:22] Sophie was behind us and I came off and
[37:26] hit the hit the dog. I am telling you, I
[37:30] my face hit that chair so hard, not my
[37:34] glasses off. I'm I'm like bruised here.
[37:37] And uh I'm laying there and the pain was
[37:39] so much and what what's going to happen?
[37:42] My nose is bleeding.
[37:45] And I thought, well, if I could have
[37:46] just been holding to God's unchanging
[37:48] hand,
[37:50] And you know, we're going to go through
[37:51] trials. Things are going to happen. And
[37:53] we've just got to make sure that we're
[37:55] always holding to God's unchanging hand.

[38:00] to say with brother Bruce, happy
[38:02] Father's Day to each of our fathers.
[38:04] Amen. And um it's not an easy job to be
[38:09] a father. It's especially in this age,
[38:10] it's it's a hard hard job to be a
[38:13] father. And uh sometimes the mothers
[38:17] have to be fathers.
[38:19] And uh so we just want to honor them
[38:21] today. I want to uh welcome our visitor,
[38:24] Brother Orlando's friend, Lucas, with
[38:27] us. God bless you. Hope you enjoy the
[38:29] service today. I want to say thank you
[38:31] for all the cards and expressions of
[38:33] love and appreciation
[38:35] that you've given. May the Lord bless
[38:37] you for that. Turn with me if you would
[38:39] and your the Bibles today to Deuteronomy
[38:43] chapter 5.
[38:45] We're going to read uh just a verse of
[38:48] scripture there. Have you be seated?
[38:51] Appreciated that song. Special today
[38:54] very very much. Love that song.
[39:01] Deuteronomy chapter 5
[39:04] and then we're going to read to verse 16
[39:08] and have a word of prayer before you're
[39:11] seated. The scripture tells us this is
[39:13] the fifth commandment. Honor thy father
[39:17] and thy mother,
[39:20] as the Lord thy God have commanded thee,
[39:23] that thy days may be prolonged, and that
[39:26] it may go well with thee in the land
[39:29] which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
[39:32] Can you say amen? Amen. Amen. Let's bow
[39:35] in a word of prayer. our heavenly
[39:36] father.
[39:39] Lord, we thank you for your entire word
[39:44] and uh today is a day Lord that's been
[39:48] set aside for fathers
[39:52] and according to your word here that
[39:56] every day
[39:59] you want us to to respect and honor our
[40:03] our parents.
[40:06] And Lord, we thank you that though times
[40:09] change change and
[40:12] generations change and cultures change
[40:14] and people change,
[40:18] your word still remains the same. Amen.
[40:21] We have an anchor for our soul. We're
[40:23] holding to your unchanging hand. Lord,
[40:26] we pray at this time, Lord, that you'd
[40:28] forgive us of all of our sins.
[40:31] your all powerful
[40:35] blood would just cleanse us and wash us
[40:38] from any stain,
[40:40] Lord. That
[40:43] Lord would just stand in the way of you
[40:46] communing with us today in a personal
[40:48] way. For we
[40:50] we pray, Lord, that
[40:53] it would just be you and us today
[40:55] personally. Though we'd be in a room
[40:57] with other people and and the enemy
[41:00] would maybe take our thoughts in
[41:02] different places, we just ask today that
[41:04] you would draw our attention to the
[41:06] things that you would have for us today.
[41:09] Please give us the the revelation of
[41:11] your word and help us to see you a
[41:13] little more fresh today. leave here,
[41:16] Lord, rejoicing in your spirit. We pray.
[41:19] We thank you now for these things and
[41:21] ask your blessings and rest the
[41:23] remainder of the service. We pray in
[41:25] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless.
[41:28] You may be seated.
[41:33] Oh, if your father is alive today, then
[41:37] you are blessed.
[41:39] Many fathers have passed away
[41:42] uh from this life. And if our father is
[41:45] still alive, I believe we need to honor
[41:47] him. And if he's not alive, then we need
[41:49] to honor our thoughts that we've had
[41:51] about him.
[41:53] And honestly honor the men, the man that
[41:56] has taken his place or the men, if I
[41:59] could say like that, have taken his
[42:00] place to to to be a father to you.
[42:05] The word honor
[42:07] here is to give respect
[42:10] and admiration for someone. Amen.
[42:14] to express great esteem to someone.
[42:18] We live in a time where authority is
[42:21] scorned.
[42:24] Amen. I want to say hear amen on that
[42:26] one. We live in an hour where authority
[42:28] is scorned and children want to exercise
[42:31] their devil-given right
[42:34] of entitlement. I don't need to.
[42:37] We're also living in a time that those
[42:40] who are in authority do not want to take
[42:42] their position. They do not want the
[42:45] responsibility
[42:46] of of of doing what they need to do to
[42:50] teach children how to respect.
[42:53] So, we're living in a very difficult
[42:55] hour
[42:57] leaving uh children, many sons and
[43:00] daughters, it can be difficult for them
[43:02] to really honor their parents because
[43:04] they're really not being taught. not
[43:06] being enforced.
[43:08] And let's be honest, some parents don't
[43:11] got it together.
[43:13] I don't mean to run, but who wants to
[43:15] honor someone who yells at them,
[43:17] mistreats them, downgrades them, or who
[43:20] doesn't really care enough to take time
[43:22] to tell them the way of the Lord? Amen.
[43:25] This fifth commandment was not given for
[43:27] those who only had worthy parents.
[43:31] I want to focus on that.
[43:35] But it was given with an encouragement
[43:37] and a reward that if you do it, your
[43:39] life is prolonged. Amen. So God knew
[43:42] that it was going to be difficult to
[43:45] really do this. And he wanted to
[43:47] encourage
[43:48] that if you follow through, you're going
[43:51] to be blessed. Now, why would God in
[43:53] heaven allow uh uh allow a parents who
[43:57] we don't fully agree with in the way
[44:00] they do things
[44:03] um to to to parent us a and and and go
[44:09] through the things that we go through
[44:11] because he's trying to teach us who uh
[44:14] the how he wants us to honor him. We're
[44:18] not always going to agree with God.
[44:19] We're not always going to agree with the
[44:20] word. But he still wants us to honor
[44:23] him.
[44:25] Matthew chapter 5 46 says, "For if you
[44:28] love them which love you." Think about
[44:29] this about your parent. If I remember as
[44:31] a young as a child at one time in my
[44:34] life, you know, all children get to a
[44:36] place where they know more than their
[44:37] parents. They go through that stage,
[44:39] right?
[44:41] And I don't feel like I I ever like
[44:43] thought I knew more, but there were
[44:44] times I thought I knew more,
[44:46] if I could say it like that.
[44:50] And I remember, you know, felt I I had
[44:52] the short end of the stick and my dad,
[44:54] he should have been a Christian and he
[44:55] should have raised me, right? And then I
[44:57] would had a better chance, right? So
[44:58] these are the thoughts that you think.
[45:01] But I I love Jesus speaking here about
[45:05] how we need to be. And he asked these
[45:07] questions. He says, "For if you love
[45:10] them that which love you, what reward
[45:12] have you?" Do not even the publicans
[45:15] insane? And if you salute your brethren
[45:16] only, what do you more than others? Do
[45:19] not even the public can sow. So when we
[45:21] think about it,
[45:24] I I believe that that God wants us to
[45:27] love our parents no matter how they're
[45:29] acting. Amen.
[45:32] I just want to say that again. I believe
[45:33] the Lord wants us to love our parents no
[45:35] matter how they're acting.
[45:38] It how they're acting has nothing to do
[45:39] with the commandment of God. Amen.
[45:42] Because this word is look, if my if my
[45:45] parents or my family decide not to serve
[45:47] the Lord, it has nothing to do with me.
[45:50] And you need to look at that as a child.
[45:52] If your parent is not acting the way you
[45:54] think they should be acting, you still
[45:55] serve God. Don't make them the excuse of
[45:58] why you're going to be rebel.
[46:02] Brother John, how do I honor someone
[46:04] whose life towards me has not been
[46:06] worthy of honor?
[46:08] Well, that's a good question.
[46:11] Let me just say it like this. You're not
[46:12] honoring their behavior or the choices
[46:14] that they make.
[46:17] We must remember they are God's creation
[46:20] just like you.
[46:23] So I want you to look at them in the
[46:25] light that it is God's will,
[46:29] not in the darkness that you feel
[46:31] they're not worthy because that's two
[46:33] different things.
[46:35] We have the word, it is the light. It
[46:37] just says honor them, right? Don't go
[46:40] through the process of trying to analyze
[46:43] it and whether they're worthy. And look,
[46:46] you're if you give the devil one inch,
[46:48] he'll take you so far from God and even
[46:50] funny. You just stay with the word and
[46:53] honor your father and your mother.
[46:58] And children, I want to say this. You
[47:00] should be you should be saying amen to
[47:03] the word here today.
[47:06] Now, there are other countries and
[47:07] cultures that they don't even believe
[47:11] the Bible like we do, and yet they honor
[47:14] their father and mother more than we do
[47:16] here in America as a whole. And so, it
[47:20] it's it's you don't even need God to to
[47:23] believe the Bible as we know it. There's
[47:26] just something inside.
[47:33] There's something inside that just
[47:36] knows it's the way to go. As your
[47:37] parents get older, they need help.
[47:41] And uh I'll say it like this. If if if
[47:44] you were good to your parents, good
[47:46] chance your your children are be good to
[47:48] you. Amen. Because in other words, you
[47:50] you you learn
[47:53] you learn to teach them right to honor
[47:56] to respect you when they get older.
[47:59] Jesus said, "Bless them
[48:03] that curse you.
[48:05] Do good to them that hate you. Pray for
[48:07] them that despitefully use you and
[48:09] persecute you that you may be the
[48:10] children of your father which is in
[48:12] heaven." Amen.
[48:15] So I think we have it right there from
[48:17] the word of God what we need to do when
[48:19] we think our parents are not where they
[48:20] should be. Amen. So, we need to focus on
[48:23] honoring our parents as it is the will
[48:27] of God, not because we think what
[48:29] they're doing is not right. Amen.
[48:32] And practice it as children of your
[48:35] heavenly father as Jesus said. Amen.
[48:37] That that we can bless them that swear
[48:39] at us. We can do good to them that hate
[48:41] us. And we can pray for them that
[48:42] despitefully use us and even persecute
[48:44] us. make us feel so inadequate at times
[48:50] because this is a real life that we live
[48:52] in. Amen. And stuff happens.
[48:56] But God wants us to honor him,
[48:59] honor uh honor honor them as
[49:03] uh as they should be honored. And uh as
[49:07] we honor our our our our father and our
[49:09] mother, I believe God wants us uh to
[49:12] honor him.
[49:15] We need to honor God as our heavenly
[49:18] father. Amen.
[49:21] And and when we respect the word,
[49:25] we are promised not only longer days,
[49:28] but we're we're promised eternal life.
[49:31] When you honor the word, you honor our
[49:34] heavenly father, he promises to give you
[49:37] eternal life. That's all there is to it.
[49:38] Amen.
[49:40] We don't get eternal life because we
[49:41] repent and get baptized and do what we
[49:43] want to do the rest of our life. We've
[49:45] got to give our life and honor and
[49:47] respect the word every day. Amen.
[49:50] Malachi 1:6 says, "A son honorth his
[49:54] father
[49:56] and a servant his master.
[49:59] If then I be a father, where is my
[50:02] honor?
[50:04] And if I be a master, where is my fear?
[50:07] sayeth the Lord of hosts unto you. So we
[50:10] can see that God is looking at his own
[50:14] sons and daughters and wanting to be
[50:18] honored.
[50:20] How many believes that God wants to be
[50:22] honored? Amen. And he's he's worthy to
[50:24] be honored. Amen. He's
[50:28] no one will be able to ever look at him
[50:32] like our children can look at us
[50:35] and say, "You lied."
[50:38] God's never lied.
[50:40] He's never done bad. He's a good God.
[50:45] And he's worthy to be praised and
[50:47] worshiped and honored and he wants to
[50:50] be. God is looking to be honored and
[50:53] reverenced.
[50:54] here in 2 Corinthians 6:14. There's five
[50:57] more questions. So, there was two a
[51:00] couple questions there that that God
[51:01] gave. And here's some more in 2
[51:03] Corinthians 6:14. The Bible says, "Be
[51:05] not unequally yolked together with
[51:07] unbelievers." Right? For what fellowship
[51:10] have righteousness with unrighteousness?
[51:12] And what communion have light with
[51:14] darkness? And what concord have Christ
[51:16] with bio? And or what part have he that
[51:19] believeth with an infidel?
[51:23] So and what agreement have the temple of
[51:25] God with idols. So we can see God
[51:28] himself is making a stand that there is
[51:31] a separation between him and the world.
[51:34] Right?
[51:37] And the Bible says for you are the
[51:39] temple of the living God as God hath
[51:42] said I will dwell in them and walk in
[51:44] them and I will be their God and they
[51:46] shall be my people.
[51:49] So what do we got to do to make that
[51:50] happen? Wherefore come out from among
[51:53] them, and be ye separate, sayeth the
[51:55] Lord, and touch not the unclean thing,
[51:58] and I will receive you, and I will be a
[52:01] father unto you, and you shall be my
[52:03] sons and daughters, sayeth the Lord
[52:05] Almighty. Again, you it's not about just
[52:08] repenting, getting baptized, and kind of
[52:10] living the kind of halfway life that you
[52:12] want to live. God is calling us to
[52:14] separate. And that if we truly separate,
[52:18] we're separating oursel onto him. He
[52:20] said, "I will receive you. I will be a
[52:23] father unto you. You shall be my sons
[52:25] and daughters." There will be a heavenly
[52:28] relationship. Amen.
[52:31] A heavenly relationship. Amen.
[52:35] The one I'll tell you like this.
[52:37] Everything that I thought I wish my
[52:39] father would have done, my heavenly
[52:41] father has done.
[52:46] He's never let me down. Right. Amen. And
[52:49] this is the the thing I've let my
[52:51] heavenly father down so many times.
[52:55] Thank God his mercies are new each day.
[52:58] He's a He is worthy. He's worthy to be
[53:02] served. Amen. He's worthy to be served.
[53:06] We become sons and daughters of God by
[53:08] separating from the will of this world.
[53:12] Bible says if you love the world or the
[53:14] things of the world, the love of the
[53:15] father's not in us.
[53:17] As children of God, we honor our father
[53:20] by following the word. My sheep hear my
[53:23] voice and they follow me. His voice is
[53:26] not, well, this is what I feel like
[53:27] doing today.
[53:31] The voice is not, well, I I I I don't I
[53:34] don't think I need to go to church. I
[53:35] don't need to pay ti. I don't need to
[53:36] reach out to somebody. I don't need to
[53:38] pray.
[53:40] I feel to do this. That is not God.
[53:45] God is in his word. That's the the voice
[53:47] of God is the word of God. Amen.
[53:51] And when you're not doing the word of
[53:53] God, you're not honoring
[53:55] our father. Right?
[53:59] Yeah. I You remember the last couple
[54:01] ministers we had here from overseas? You
[54:03] know what they said?
[54:06] Said, "How come you're not saying amen?"
[54:09] You remember that?
[54:11] It's kind of coming to me now while I'm
[54:13] up here.
[54:16] Deuteronomy tells us, "For the Lord have
[54:20] the Lord thy God have chosen thee to be
[54:23] a special people unto himself above all
[54:26] the people that are on the face of the
[54:28] earth." So God has chosen you as sons
[54:30] and daughters to be special above
[54:32] everybody on the on the planet. Amen.
[54:35] You know, so we you think about these
[54:37] scientists and and Nobel Nobel Prize
[54:41] winners and movie stars and athletes and
[54:43] presidents and all the great things that
[54:46] are be being achieved. And God has
[54:48] literally chosen you above all them.
[54:50] Amen. Because God has not chosen you to
[54:53] build things, make things, and become
[54:54] this great person, have lots of money.
[54:56] He's chosen you to be his wife.
[55:01] First Peter 2:9 says, "But you are a
[55:02] chosen generation. a royal priesthood, a
[55:06] holy nation, a peculiar people, that you
[55:08] should show forth the praises of him
[55:10] that have called you out of the darkness
[55:13] of your own will, right? Into his
[55:16] marvelous light, which is his will,
[55:20] which in times past you were not even a
[55:22] people. We were all there drinking and
[55:25] doing all sorts of stuff. But now, but
[55:28] are now the people of God, which which
[55:32] had not obtained mercy, but now have
[55:35] obtained mercy. Amen. Amen. Jesus said,
[55:39] "You've not chosen me, but I have chosen
[55:42] you." That's right. Wherefore, come out
[55:45] from among them, and be ye separate,
[55:47] sayeth the Lord. So, if I'll say like
[55:49] this, you're sitting here today in a
[55:50] message church
[55:53] and you think because you're in the
[55:54] church, you're separated. That is such a
[55:56] lie.
[55:57] That is such a lie.
[56:00] God is always calling us to separate
[56:05] more and more from our will into God's
[56:09] own will. And some of us won't take
[56:11] correction.
[56:15] Help us, Lord. Help us, Lord. We must
[56:19] honor our heavenly father. Now, we know
[56:21] the natural types of spiritual, right?
[56:23] All right. Proverbs 3:9, honor the Lord
[56:27] with thy substance.
[56:31] This, honor the Lord with thy substance.
[56:34] Don't be selfish. Honor the Lord and
[56:38] with the first fruits of all thine
[56:42] increase. Brother John, we've already
[56:44] prayed over the offering. You do not
[56:45] need to talk about this right now.
[56:48] It's part of the word. And but if you
[56:51] do, look at the look at the promise. So
[56:53] shall thy barns be filled with plenty,
[56:55] and thy presses shall burst out with new
[56:58] wine.
[56:59] My son, despise not the chastening of
[57:02] the Lord, neither be ye weary of his
[57:05] correction. For whom the Lord loveth, he
[57:08] correcteth, even as a father the son in
[57:11] whom he delightth. Amen. Amen. You God
[57:15] is not one to say, I'm not going to deal
[57:17] with this.
[57:20] He loves too much. He cares too much
[57:24] and God does not want us to see us
[57:26] remain in a condition that is not bride
[57:29] ready.
[57:33] So I thank God that there's a word here
[57:36] to get a bride ready. And it doesn't
[57:39] mean that the word here that's getting
[57:41] the bride ready that's going to get
[57:43] everybody else who's doesn't care. It
[57:47] ain't going to change that.
[57:49] But to the bride, every bitter thing is
[57:52] sweet. They're they're they're they're
[57:54] hungry for the word of God. Amen. And
[57:57] and and
[57:59] it should be a delight to come into the
[58:01] house of God. Uh one thing I desired of
[58:04] the Lord that I seek after David said,
[58:08] there's a very special relationship that
[58:10] we have with our heavenly father.
[58:12] Brother Brandham said we come to his
[58:15] house to see where we're standing with
[58:16] him. Amen.
[58:19] That's what he said. He didn't say, you
[58:22] know, you just, you know, just read your
[58:24] Bible and just pray and then you'll find
[58:25] out where you're at with God. That's not
[58:27] what he said. Because the Bible tells us
[58:30] that correction
[58:33] starts in the house of the Lord.
[58:36] This is just what God has provided. If
[58:38] you can't take correction here, you
[58:39] can't take correction anywhere.
[58:42] That's a God's truth. Amen.
[58:44] It's a real love relationship with
[58:47] father, son, father, daughter that is
[58:50] this love is is always correcting us or
[58:53] is always wanting to see us in the
[58:56] light. Okay. So he says you shall um
[58:59] you're my disciples if you continue to
[59:01] walk in the light.
[59:03] Um
[59:05] you continue walking in the truth. God
[59:08] is interested in us becoming more like
[59:10] him. Who has who has ever had a son and
[59:12] daughter in their life and has had this
[59:14] attitude? I really don't care what you
[59:17] turn out to be.
[59:21] I don't care if you grow or don't grow.
[59:24] I don't care if you learn or don't. You
[59:25] just stay right there in fifth grade for
[59:27] the rest of your life.
[59:30] No parent has had that attitude.
[59:33] And God certainly doesn't have an
[59:35] attitude where I just don't care what
[59:36] you do. Amen. He's always trying to get
[59:40] us into more truth. Always. Jesus said,
[59:44] "As many as I love, you know what I do?
[59:46] I let them get away if they want." Nope.
[59:49] As many as I love, I rebuke. I chasen.
[59:53] Be zalious. Therefore, repent. Come
[59:56] separate yourself. Separate from that
[59:58] will and do my will. Amen.
[1:00:01] And as sons and daughters of our
[1:00:03] heavenly father, we must honor God by
[1:00:07] submitting to whatever his will would
[1:00:09] be. Turn with me if you would to Hebrews
[1:00:10] chapter 12. We're just going to read a
[1:00:12] lengthy scripture here. Just a little
[1:00:15] bit about correction. I I think it's a
[1:00:17] very important part of of a of a
[1:00:20] relationship with our heavenly father is
[1:00:22] correction. Amen. If if we don't have a
[1:00:25] a good close relationship in correction,
[1:00:29] um yeah, you you don't really have one.
[1:00:32] That's a good way of of saying it
[1:00:34] because
[1:00:36] God doesn't have any children. There's
[1:00:39] not going to be a uh his bride is not
[1:00:42] going to be a bride who only takes half
[1:00:44] the correction
[1:00:46] or only takes the correction they want
[1:00:48] to. So, it's it's it's a real it's a
[1:00:50] serious thing. And so let's start off
[1:00:54] here with verse one. Wherefore seeing we
[1:00:55] are also compassed about with so great a
[1:00:57] cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside
[1:00:59] every weight in the sin that does so
[1:01:01] easily beset us and let us run with
[1:01:03] patience the race that is set before us.
[1:01:05] So here we are all are are are cumbered
[1:01:09] about with test and trials and things
[1:01:11] that we're going through and and God is
[1:01:14] building character and and uh we get
[1:01:17] certain weights and and certain sins in
[1:01:19] our life and and things are just there.
[1:01:21] Can you say amen to the word of God
[1:01:22] today? And and and the writer here is
[1:01:25] telling us that we just we need to lay
[1:01:28] these things aside and run the race
[1:01:30] because there there are Hebrews uh 11 is
[1:01:33] is just a whole cloud of witnesses that
[1:01:36] have run the race. And now it's our
[1:01:37] turn. We're running the race. And and
[1:01:39] the encouragement is to look unto Jesus,
[1:01:41] the author and finisher of our faith,
[1:01:43] who for the joy that was set before him,
[1:01:45] he
[1:01:47] endured the cross. Amen.
[1:01:50] He despised the shame shame and is sat
[1:01:53] down at the right hand of the throne of
[1:01:55] God. And he says, "For consider him
[1:01:59] that endured such contradiction of
[1:02:02] sinners against his own self, lest you
[1:02:06] think you got it real hard, right?" And
[1:02:10] be wearied and faint in your own minds
[1:02:12] that your trial is much harder. First of
[1:02:15] all, God would not ever put anything on
[1:02:17] you that you can't bear. Amen.
[1:02:20] He'll make a way of escape just like he
[1:02:21] did with Jesus.
[1:02:25] He says, "Ye have not yet resisted unto
[1:02:28] blood, striving against sin." Amen. And
[1:02:32] ye have forgotten the exhortation that
[1:02:34] speaketh unto you as children. My son,
[1:02:37] despise not the chastening of the Lord,
[1:02:39] nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.
[1:02:43] Amen. Now, in the I'm just going to say
[1:02:45] in the natural now, in the natural
[1:02:47] realm,
[1:02:49] sometimes when we say something to one
[1:02:52] another or to our children or children
[1:02:54] do to us in that human that human realm,
[1:02:58] there can be this feeling of an insult,
[1:03:02] right?
[1:03:04] And um and then at any time and we could
[1:03:09] have that so much happening
[1:03:11] psychologically in our life that any
[1:03:13] kind of uh correction is looked at and
[1:03:16] viewed as an insult as as mean as not
[1:03:19] right as not fair. You understand what
[1:03:22] I'm saying? Amen. Okay. But what God he
[1:03:25] he when anytime that God ever corrects
[1:03:28] he loves. It's just all there is to it.
[1:03:31] Amen. You do not have to question it.
[1:03:33] You do not have to question his motive.
[1:03:36] When the word says something, that's
[1:03:38] saying, "I love you." And if somebody
[1:03:41] else, this is why the Bible says, "Speak
[1:03:43] the truth in love." You can use the word
[1:03:45] and cut somebody, right?
[1:03:48] But when you speak it with the right
[1:03:49] spirit,
[1:03:55] I'm so glad that we have a word to keep
[1:03:57] us in line. Amen. I'm so glad that God
[1:04:00] gave us a word to let us know that our
[1:04:02] relationship is healthy with him. Amen.
[1:04:06] All right. For whom the Lord loveth, he
[1:04:09] cha and scourgeth every son whom he
[1:04:12] receiveth. So you can't get out of it.
[1:04:15] He if you endure chastening,
[1:04:19] God deal with you as with sons.
[1:04:22] For what son is he whom the father
[1:04:25] chastineth not? There you go. There you
[1:04:27] go. who who who has never corrected his
[1:04:31] child.
[1:04:33] So every father corrects his child.
[1:04:35] Therefore, God God loves us enough to
[1:04:39] correct us as well. Amen.
[1:04:43] But if ye be without chastisement, in
[1:04:45] other words, I don't want to be
[1:04:46] corrected.
[1:04:48] Wherefore, I'm sorry, all of us are
[1:04:50] partakers of of chastisement.
[1:04:53] But if you be without it and you resist
[1:04:56] it, then are ye bastards
[1:04:59] and not sons. That's right. That is so
[1:05:02] scary.
[1:05:04] That that's that's like so so for
[1:05:07] someone to say, "Yeah, I'm a I'm I'm I'm
[1:05:09] a son of God." But you're not going to
[1:05:10] follow the word. You know what? It it
[1:05:13] doesn't matter what you're feeling.
[1:05:14] Believe the word. Amen. Believe the
[1:05:16] word.
[1:05:18] It it tells you where we're at, right?
[1:05:21] Okay.
[1:05:24] All right. Furthermore, we have had
[1:05:27] fathers of our flesh which corrected us
[1:05:28] and gave us reverence. Shall we not much
[1:05:31] rather be in subjection unto the father
[1:05:33] of spirits and live? Amen. In other
[1:05:36] words, he's never done a thing wrong.
[1:05:39] Right? For verily
[1:05:42] uh for they verily for a few days chasen
[1:05:44] us after their own pleasure. Right. I'm
[1:05:46] so I'm mad at you. You're gonna pay for
[1:05:48] this. You know what I'm saying? for
[1:05:51] their own pleasure, but he for our
[1:05:54] profit
[1:05:55] that we might be partakers of his
[1:05:57] holiness. In other words, there's a
[1:05:59] reason that the word tells us to do what
[1:06:01] we should do, right? It isn't to make
[1:06:04] our life miserable. It isn't to make us
[1:06:07] unhappy. It's to get us to a place that
[1:06:10] we can be have a close relationship with
[1:06:12] our heavenly father. Do you know how
[1:06:13] many people are going to go be on the
[1:06:15] day of judgment and they're going to
[1:06:16] say, "Oh, I thought
[1:06:18] I thought we had a relationship. I
[1:06:21] thought you were with me. I thought
[1:06:22] this."
[1:06:25] Because they weren't humble enough when
[1:06:26] they came to church.
[1:06:29] They didn't humble themselves to the
[1:06:30] word. Amen.
[1:06:34] Now, no chastening for the present
[1:06:36] seemth to be joyous.
[1:06:39] It's actually grievous.
[1:06:41] Nevertheless, afterward it yielded the
[1:06:45] peaceable fruits of righteousness unto
[1:06:48] who? Unto them which are exercised
[1:06:51] thereby or them that are willing to take
[1:06:54] the correction that they actually get
[1:06:56] profited. They get more character. They
[1:06:58] get a closer walk with God. People look
[1:07:00] at them and they say, "Yes, they've got
[1:07:02] God with them. I can see it in their
[1:07:04] life. They're following the word.
[1:07:05] They're not they're not skipping out on
[1:07:07] part of the word."
[1:07:09] Amen.
[1:07:12] Wherefore, what do we do with this
[1:07:14] situation? Wherefore, lift up the hands
[1:07:17] which hang down and the feeble knees.
[1:07:23] Lift up the hands that hang down. This
[1:07:26] this this when the word comes and you
[1:07:29] just feel like, I don't know if I can do
[1:07:31] this, and I I just I'm just I'm just I
[1:07:35] don't think I could live the life. I
[1:07:36] don't think I could do this.
[1:07:38] I don't think I could follow. I don't
[1:07:40] think I could take this correction.
[1:07:43] I I think I need to find something
[1:07:45] different. You know, a church that maybe
[1:07:47] you don't have to try as hard.
[1:07:50] One that maybe entertains you and makes
[1:07:52] you feel just a little bit better.
[1:07:57] Well, there they're out there. Satan has
[1:07:58] a lot of them. Amen.
[1:08:03] But we've been instructed by the word of
[1:08:05] God
[1:08:09] to make straight paths for your feet,
[1:08:13] lest that which is laying be turned out
[1:08:16] of the way, but let it be rather healed.
[1:08:20] Follow peace with all men. Amen. not
[1:08:25] your some those you agree with.
[1:08:28] In all thy ways please the Lord and make
[1:08:30] even thy enemies they be at peace with
[1:08:32] you. Follow peace with all men and
[1:08:34] holiness with which no man without which
[1:08:37] no man shall see the Lord. Amen.
[1:08:40] Now we're we're still talking on this
[1:08:42] theme of of correction. I want you to
[1:08:44] understand that. And that that God's
[1:08:47] word is always corrective. Amen.
[1:08:51] it it
[1:08:53] the the because it's an absolute I'm not
[1:08:55] saying that that there there's not
[1:08:58] verses there that that uh there's tons
[1:09:00] of verses he he he'll not withhold
[1:09:02] anything from them that walk uprightly
[1:09:04] there's many wonderful words but what
[1:09:06] I'm saying is the word of God is an
[1:09:08] absolute
[1:09:10] so he says here in verse 15 looking
[1:09:12] diligently lest any man fail of the
[1:09:16] grace of God
[1:09:18] how does that happen lest a root of
[1:09:21] bitterness spring up and spring up
[1:09:26] troubling you and what happens then and
[1:09:29] thereby many around you become defiled.
[1:09:33] Amen.
[1:09:36] No, I'm not going to obey that. I'm
[1:09:39] going to show that church I ain't coming
[1:09:40] back.
[1:09:43] A rooe of bitterness. Amen. You know
[1:09:46] what they did? They didn't shake my
[1:09:47] hand, Brother Lando.
[1:09:51] They didn't They didn't smile at me.
[1:09:53] They didn't They didn't They didn't
[1:09:56] express that they cared about me. Well,
[1:09:57] did you express that you cared about
[1:09:59] them? Well, I shouldn't have to do that.
[1:10:02] You know, that's not my job.
[1:10:05] So, you see here, the devil's just
[1:10:08] looking for someone he can spring up a
[1:10:10] root of bitterness. That's right.
[1:10:14] and and and and and the devil wants you
[1:10:17] to reject the word.
[1:10:19] Why? A chance of bitterness coming.
[1:10:23] All right? Lest there be any fornicator
[1:10:26] or profane person. Look, as Esau,
[1:10:33] Esau, Esau was this. He didn't he he
[1:10:37] didn't want the word,
[1:10:41] right? He didn't want the word as Esau
[1:10:44] who for one morsel of meat sold his
[1:10:48] birthright. Amen.
[1:10:50] In other words, the word that's being
[1:10:52] preached to you is to give you the new
[1:10:55] birth. Amen. The new birth is not you in
[1:10:59] your mouth saying, "I am born again."
[1:11:01] That is not the new birth.
[1:11:04] The word is what births you. And when
[1:11:06] the word is preached to you, it's trying
[1:11:09] to become born in you. And when you
[1:11:12] receive it, you become more born again.
[1:11:15] It's not like the world thinks out
[1:11:17] there, oh yeah, I'm born again. Like it
[1:11:19] just doesn't matter what you live, what
[1:11:21] you do.
[1:11:24] Every time you receive the engrafted
[1:11:25] word in your heart, you're becoming more
[1:11:27] born again. Amen. God is calling us to
[1:11:30] be like him. And that's only we're
[1:11:33] birthed by the word. That's why how
[1:11:36] precious
[1:11:37] it is to come to church. It is a, you
[1:11:39] know, church is a dangerous place. It is
[1:11:42] the place where the bride becomes
[1:11:43] perfected through a five-fold ministry.
[1:11:47] But it is the place where judgment
[1:11:48] happens to those that reject it. And as
[1:11:51] the scripture tells us that um if the
[1:11:54] righteous scarcely make it, where will
[1:11:56] the ungodly and the sinner appear in the
[1:11:58] day of judgment? See what happens when
[1:12:01] we come to church bride? We are
[1:12:03] literally in the white throne judgment,
[1:12:06] right? Amen. Because we're willingly
[1:12:10] taking the word ahead of time and
[1:12:14] judging ourselves ahead of time.
[1:12:18] We're still in the white throne
[1:12:19] judgment. He's just here saying, "I'm
[1:12:20] giving the bride a chance to be judged
[1:12:22] with mercy
[1:12:25] because there's coming a time when it's
[1:12:27] too late and we'll be judged without
[1:12:29] mercy." And that's the white throne
[1:12:30] judgment.
[1:12:33] And we don't want to despise the mercies
[1:12:34] of God that we have, do we not? But look
[1:12:38] at this verse 17. For you know how that
[1:12:42] afterwards
[1:12:43] when Esau would have inherited the
[1:12:46] blessing, he was rejected,
[1:12:50] for he found no place of repentance,
[1:12:53] though he sought it carefully with
[1:12:55] tears. What a warning to all of us.
[1:13:01] that there is a a time that God gives
[1:13:04] us. It's called grace to get it right.
[1:13:09] And if you wait beyond that time, even
[1:13:12] though you decide that you want to
[1:13:14] repent,
[1:13:16] it can be too late.
[1:13:18] And we have the example right here that
[1:13:20] he has given us.
[1:13:23] I'll say like this, pride isolates us
[1:13:25] from God.
[1:13:27] Pride isolates us from God. I'll say
[1:13:29] this. You know what it all boils down
[1:13:31] to?
[1:13:33] Rebellion. I just I don't care.
[1:13:36] Lucifer rebelled against God.
[1:13:39] And he got proud in his heart. Well, I
[1:13:41] don't need to do that. I'm going to just
[1:13:42] do what I want to do and nobody's going
[1:13:44] to tell me and I'll fake it in between
[1:13:46] here and there.
[1:13:49] I mean, it it's just the Bible says it's
[1:13:52] a fearful thing to fall in the hands of
[1:13:54] a living God. Amen. I I I think this is
[1:13:57] this is much different than I remember
[1:13:59] when I was young and before I came into
[1:14:01] the truth and I was going to church, I
[1:14:03] didn't want to go to church. How many
[1:14:04] remembers when you were young, you
[1:14:06] didn't want to go to church? Yeah, I
[1:14:08] remember that. It was because it wasn't
[1:14:10] enjoyable. I could be out playing
[1:14:16] and I I I didn't want to go. I I just I
[1:14:19] I didn't want to go. But after I went, I
[1:14:22] felt feel good now, right? Hey, I went
[1:14:25] to church.
[1:14:27] I I got to be doing better. I went to
[1:14:29] church.
[1:14:31] Just the mere fact that I went to
[1:14:33] church,
[1:14:34] God's got to be happy with me no matter
[1:14:36] what I do.
[1:14:40] Don't work that way. That's the way it
[1:14:42] works in the world. Amen.
[1:14:46] God has called us to have a relationship
[1:14:47] with him.
[1:14:49] Proverbs 15:33 says 15:33. We're going
[1:14:53] to read a few proverbs here. The fear of
[1:14:56] the Lord is the instruction of wisdom
[1:15:01] and before honor is a very important
[1:15:04] ingredient called humility.
[1:15:08] Proverbs 18:12 says it like this. Before
[1:15:12] destruction,
[1:15:14] the heart of a man is halty and before
[1:15:17] honor is humility. Right?
[1:15:20] So when you see somebody, some man whose
[1:15:24] heart begins to get haughty and mean and
[1:15:27] and rude, you can know as sure as
[1:15:30] anything, destruction is coming his way.
[1:15:34] As sure as anything, and you take a man
[1:15:37] who's willing to keep himself under
[1:15:40] subjection to the word of God, we call
[1:15:42] that humility, by the way. Amen. When
[1:15:45] you see a man who's willing to stay
[1:15:48] humble, I don't mean for a week,
[1:15:51] I don't mean for a month, right? But
[1:15:54] who's willing to be a a a man who
[1:15:57] humbles himself before God. I'm telling
[1:16:00] you, honor is coming his way. Because
[1:16:03] that's what the word says. Amen. The
[1:16:06] word can't lie.
[1:16:08] Proverbs 22:4 says, "By humility
[1:16:12] and the fear of the Lord are riches
[1:16:17] and honor and life." Right? Well, you
[1:16:22] know what? That reminds me of what the
[1:16:24] prophet said, "The way up is down."
[1:16:29] I'm going to get riches without humbling
[1:16:31] myself before the Lord.
[1:16:34] I'm I'm going to get life without
[1:16:36] humbling myself before the Lord.
[1:16:39] I'm going to get honor.
[1:16:42] If you're going to get honor without
[1:16:44] going God's way, you're stealing it.
[1:16:48] You're getting it on unlawfully
[1:16:51] because it's through humility and the
[1:16:53] fear of the Lord our riches, honor, and
[1:16:55] life. Can you say amen to the word of
[1:16:57] God? If you can't say amen to me, I'm
[1:17:00] okay with that. But say amen to the word
[1:17:01] of God. Amen. Because I didn't write
[1:17:04] this.
[1:17:06] Honor our heavenly father with humility.
[1:17:10] Come before him with a humble and
[1:17:11] contrite spirit. Our heavenly father, he
[1:17:14] resisteth the proud and he giveth grace
[1:17:16] to the humble. Jesus said, "My grace is
[1:17:19] sufficient and my God shall supply all
[1:17:22] of your needs according to his riches in
[1:17:24] glory by Christ Jesus." So honor your
[1:17:27] heavenly father with a humble life. A
[1:17:30] humble life.
[1:17:32] That means you got to take care of what
[1:17:33] you're thinking about in your mind, how
[1:17:35] you handle situations.
[1:17:37] A humble life is not a badge you put on.
[1:17:39] It's not a shirt you wear. It's not a
[1:17:41] slogan you say.
[1:17:44] It's your the way that you think in your
[1:17:46] mind. It's a it's what you what's what
[1:17:48] possesses inside your heart. It's it's
[1:17:51] the it's your whole being.
[1:17:53] You either put God's word, you honor it,
[1:17:56] and you put everything first, or you're
[1:17:58] just picking and choosing.
[1:18:01] So let's take a a look here at Matthew
[1:18:03] chapter 15 verse1 because we have to
[1:18:06] watch our attitudes
[1:18:08] with our heavenly father. Don't you
[1:18:09] think?
[1:18:11] Matthew 5:1. Then came g then came to
[1:18:14] Jesus. They were scribes and they were
[1:18:16] Pharisees. We know what kind of attitude
[1:18:17] they had which were of Jerusalem saying,
[1:18:21] "Why do your disciples transgress the
[1:18:24] tradition of all the elders around here?
[1:18:28] For they wash not their hands when they
[1:18:31] eat bread."
[1:18:34] But he answered and said unto them, "Why
[1:18:36] do you transgress the commandment of God
[1:18:38] by your tradition?"
[1:18:41] So he answered their question with a
[1:18:44] question.
[1:18:47] For God commanded, saying, "Honor thy
[1:18:50] father and mother, and he that cursseth
[1:18:55] father or mother, let him die the death.
[1:18:58] But you say by your tradition,
[1:19:01] whosoever shall say to his father or his
[1:19:03] mother, now look at this attitude, I am
[1:19:07] a gift by whatsoever thou mayest be
[1:19:11] profited by me.
[1:19:15] In other words, I have the choice. I'm
[1:19:18] entitled to act any old way I want to,
[1:19:21] right? And if I want to profit you,
[1:19:25] then I will. if I don't.
[1:19:28] Now, that was a tradition. Of course,
[1:19:30] that's the devil's tradition, isn't it?
[1:19:32] That's the devil's tradition. And it's
[1:19:35] all about attitude.
[1:19:38] And honor not his father or his mother,
[1:19:41] he shall be free. Look, it's okay. You
[1:19:43] don't have to do the word of God. Thus,
[1:19:46] have you made the commandment of God of
[1:19:48] none effect by your tradition. And I'll
[1:19:51] just say this is why it's important in
[1:19:53] this age for parents to take time to
[1:19:56] make sure that their children is
[1:19:57] corrected
[1:20:00] because we're literally teaching them a
[1:20:02] tradition that they don't have to. Now,
[1:20:04] this is a hard job because it usually
[1:20:07] takes a little bit more than just saying
[1:20:10] stop. Don't do that. Right? It takes a
[1:20:13] little bit more. Sometimes
[1:20:16] you get talked back
[1:20:19] by your children. And so, you know, that
[1:20:23] causes you to be patient and to pray and
[1:20:25] ask God for wisdom to get to fear fear
[1:20:28] of the Lord. God, help me with this
[1:20:30] situation,
[1:20:32] but it needs to be dealt with.
[1:20:36] And I
[1:20:38] it just it needs to be dealt with. Not
[1:20:40] trying to put any pressure, but
[1:20:43] we're living in an age where, you know,
[1:20:48] you can be a man and call yourself a
[1:20:51] woman. You can be a woman, call yourself
[1:20:52] a man, because it really doesn't matter,
[1:20:55] right? It just nothing matters. That's
[1:20:58] the age we're living in. And and the
[1:21:00] devil is is giving many reasons for for
[1:21:03] children not to follow their parents.
[1:21:06] Amen.
[1:21:08] Now, of course, we need to remember that
[1:21:11] I'm saying all this for the reason of us
[1:21:13] spiritually. We can have an attitude
[1:21:15] towards God that we don't really have
[1:21:17] to, you know, do all the word of God.
[1:21:19] Amen. We don't have to respect all the
[1:21:21] word of God. We can just respect part of
[1:21:24] that's the reason we're reading this.
[1:21:27] He says, 'You hypocrites, well did
[1:21:29] Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, This
[1:21:32] people draw nigh unto me with their
[1:21:34] mouth and honor me with their lips, but
[1:21:36] their heart is far from me. But in vain
[1:21:39] they do worship me, teaching for
[1:21:40] doctrine the commandments of men. So
[1:21:43] they still worship God. They still go to
[1:21:45] church. They still say they believe, but
[1:21:47] they only take part of the word. And
[1:21:49] then they they go home say, "Well, we
[1:21:51] don't have to do that."
[1:21:53] So, we need to look for ways to honor
[1:21:55] our heavenly father, not with words
[1:21:58] only, but with our actions. Here's
[1:21:59] Isaiah 58:13. I'm going to read it real
[1:22:01] quick. If thou turn away thy foot from
[1:22:04] the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on
[1:22:07] my holy day, and call the Sabbath a
[1:22:10] delight, and a holy of the Lord,
[1:22:12] honorable, and shall honor him, not
[1:22:15] doing your own ways, nor finding your
[1:22:18] own pleasures, nor speaking your own
[1:22:20] words. Then shalt thou delight thyself
[1:22:24] in the Lord, and I will cause thee to
[1:22:27] ride upon the high places of the earth,
[1:22:29] and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob
[1:22:31] thy father, for the mouth of the Lord
[1:22:33] has spoken it. So another another
[1:22:36] scriptures that teaches us how we can
[1:22:38] honor God today.
[1:22:40] Amen. Amen. I'm going to say say amen
[1:22:43] to, you know, I'm going to say amen if
[1:22:45] you're not going to say amen
[1:22:47] because it's the word of God. We need to
[1:22:49] set our affections on things above.
[1:22:51] Right? Amen. God is good. He's the
[1:22:54] father of all good. He cannot do wrong.
[1:22:58] All that he ever does is good. Our our
[1:23:01] our father loves us with an everlasting
[1:23:04] love. His mercies are new and more.
[1:23:07] Great is his faithfulness. Our God is a
[1:23:10] great God. Amen. James chapter 1 verse1
[1:23:13] 17. He gives us gifts. Every good gift
[1:23:19] and every perfect gift is from above,
[1:23:21] right? And cometh down from the father.
[1:23:24] What? Of lights.
[1:23:28] He's the father of lights. That means in
[1:23:30] it doesn't I I just love it. It says
[1:23:33] lights. It just kind of reminds me of a
[1:23:34] Christmas tree, right? So many lights on
[1:23:36] a Christmas tree. Father of lights. So I
[1:23:39] think about God. I think about all these
[1:23:41] lights and that he's just constantly
[1:23:43] showing this is this is what we could
[1:23:46] do. This is how to walk in the light.
[1:23:47] This is this is more truth. This is how
[1:23:49] to handle this situation. He's got a ton
[1:23:51] of light for us. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:55] Ton of light. The father of lights
[1:23:58] with whom, look at this, is no
[1:24:02] variableness neither shadow of turning.
[1:24:05] Now in the back, see these are the these
[1:24:08] lights go on and off. But in the back,
[1:24:09] we have a variable switch. And we can
[1:24:12] dim the lights, make them brighter.
[1:24:15] In God, there's no kind of love, don't
[1:24:18] love.
[1:24:20] Kind of care, don't care. Going to try,
[1:24:23] not going to try.
[1:24:26] No, we serve a God who's faithful. We
[1:24:29] can count on him.
[1:24:31] And and I think I think we should honor
[1:24:34] him and respect him as he is.
[1:24:38] Amen. Now, keep that amen going for the
[1:24:41] rest of the service. We don't got long
[1:24:42] to go. Amen.
[1:24:44] And if you keep it going, I'll let you
[1:24:46] off on the first three quarters of the
[1:24:48] service. Amen.
[1:24:51] There's many, many gifts. 1 Corinthians
[1:24:53] 12:8 says, "For to one is given the
[1:24:56] spirit
[1:24:58] by the spirit the word of wisdom, to
[1:25:00] another the word of knowledge." Amen. By
[1:25:02] the same Spirit, to another faith, by
[1:25:04] the same Spirit, to another gifts of
[1:25:06] healing, by the same Spirit, to another
[1:25:08] the working of miracles, to another
[1:25:09] prophecy, to another discerning of
[1:25:11] spirits, to another diverse kinds of
[1:25:14] tongues, to another the interpretation
[1:25:15] of tongues. But all these workketh that
[1:25:19] one and same self-same spirit dividing
[1:25:22] to every one of us, to every man
[1:25:25] severally, as what? He wills.
[1:25:29] He wills. Our heavenly father has
[1:25:32] blessed his sons and daughters with
[1:25:35] gifts from heaven. Amen. I'll say
[1:25:38] eternal life being the greatest gift,
[1:25:41] a changed nature, healings, answered
[1:25:45] prayers, the gifts of peace by simply
[1:25:49] learning to keep our mind stayed on our
[1:25:51] heavenly father. A peace that passeth
[1:25:53] all understanding. I mean, who can
[1:25:55] produce that kind of gift? No one but
[1:25:57] our God. Who can keep us in perfect
[1:26:00] peace?
[1:26:01] Who can renew our strength like an
[1:26:03] eagle?
[1:26:05] Who giveth power to the faint? Who
[1:26:07] forgiveth all of our transgressions?
[1:26:09] Who made himself a little lower than the
[1:26:12] angels to taste death for us?
[1:26:15] Who went to Calvary for his children?
[1:26:18] Amen. There is none like our heavenly
[1:26:20] father. And he's worthy to be honored
[1:26:23] today. Honor your heavenly father. Amen.
[1:26:27] In Psalms 145, our brother David, how
[1:26:31] many knows they have a brother? His name
[1:26:33] is David. Amen. Amen. I can't wait to
[1:26:35] shake his hand. He was born before me.
[1:26:38] You know, I had a brother who who was
[1:26:40] born and he he died. He had a hole in
[1:26:42] his heart. He died like I think three
[1:26:44] days after he was born. And I know that
[1:26:46] I'm going to meet him someday. That's
[1:26:48] right. But here's our brother David. He
[1:26:51] spent much time honoring his heavenly
[1:26:52] father. And he says here in Psalms
[1:26:55] 145:1, I will extol thee, my God, oh
[1:26:59] king, and I will bless thy name forever
[1:27:01] and ever. Every day I will bless thee.
[1:27:05] And I will praise thy name forever and
[1:27:07] ever. Amen. Great is the Lord and
[1:27:10] greatly to be praised, and his greatness
[1:27:14] is unsearchable.
[1:27:16] One generation shall praise thy works to
[1:27:19] another, and it's just not going to
[1:27:20] stop.
[1:27:22] and shall declare the mighty acts. And I
[1:27:24] will speak of thy glorious honor, of thy
[1:27:27] majesty, and of thy wondrous works.
[1:27:32] I like my brother David.
[1:27:35] I like my brother David.
[1:27:38] I think we have the same heavenly
[1:27:39] father. Psalms 96 verse1. We need to
[1:27:42] look at that like that, right? Because
[1:27:45] in Christ, we're all one family. Amen.
[1:27:48] Psalms 96:1. Oh, sing unto the Lord a
[1:27:51] new song.
[1:27:52] Sing unto the Lord, all the earth. Sing
[1:27:55] unto the Lord. Bless his name. And show
[1:27:58] forth his salvation. What? From day to
[1:28:02] today. Amen. Right. Remember the last
[1:28:05] service.
[1:28:06] Show forth his salvation from day to
[1:28:09] day. Declare his glory among the
[1:28:11] heathen, his wonders among all people.
[1:28:14] For the Lord is great and greatly to be
[1:28:16] praised. That's right. For he is to be
[1:28:19] feared above all gods. And that means
[1:28:22] the god that lives in up here, right?
[1:28:26] This God
[1:28:28] that kind of wants to do his own thing.
[1:28:30] That God,
[1:28:32] we need to fear the word above
[1:28:35] ourselves.
[1:28:37] For all the gods of the nations are
[1:28:39] idols, but the Lord made the heavens.
[1:28:43] Honor and majesty are before him.
[1:28:46] strength and beauty are in his
[1:28:48] sanctuary. What is in here today?
[1:28:52] All right. Now, I know you're not paying
[1:28:54] attention. We're going to start all
[1:28:55] over.
[1:28:59] The Bible tells us that beauty and
[1:29:02] strength are here today.
[1:29:05] Lord,
[1:29:06] think about it. David said, "I wanted to
[1:29:09] behold the beauty of the Lord." Amen. To
[1:29:12] inquire in his temple. There's strength
[1:29:15] there for us.
[1:29:17] It comes through the word of God.
[1:29:20] Honor and majesty are before him. Give
[1:29:22] unto the Lord, all ye kindreds of the
[1:29:24] kindreds of the people. Give unto the
[1:29:27] Lord glory and strength. Give unto the
[1:29:30] Lord glory due to his name. Bring an
[1:29:32] offering and come into his courts and oh
[1:29:34] worship the Lord in the beauty of
[1:29:36] holiness. Fear before him all the earth.
[1:29:40] Amen. I mean, this is where our heart
[1:29:43] should be this morning. This is where
[1:29:45] our heart should be. Psalms 26:7, that I
[1:29:49] may publish with the voice of
[1:29:51] thanksgiving and tell of all thy
[1:29:53] wondrous works. Lord, I have loved the
[1:29:56] the habitation of your house and the
[1:29:59] place where thy honor dwelleth. Amen. I
[1:30:03] tell you, I don't want to be in a house
[1:30:05] where his presence isn't there. Because
[1:30:06] when his presence is isn't there, he's
[1:30:09] not going to be honored because his
[1:30:12] people are not going to be there.
[1:30:15] Where the carcass is, there's where the
[1:30:17] eagles be gathered together.
[1:30:19] I think we need to show what side we're
[1:30:21] on. Amen. We come here to glorify his
[1:30:24] name. Amen. To lift up the name of
[1:30:26] Jesus, to put him in his proper place.
[1:30:30] You know, we can go through the course
[1:30:31] of the weeks and we spend so much time
[1:30:33] in in in our problems and dealing with
[1:30:35] negative stuff that we forget our God.
[1:30:41] He's never done any harm to us. We
[1:30:43] should be able to honor the Lord in his
[1:30:45] house. Don't you think so? Psalm 71:8
[1:30:48] says, "Let my mouth be filled with thy
[1:30:51] praise and with thy honor all the day."
[1:30:57] All the day. All right, Revelations 5:9.
[1:31:02] We have to hurry here because we just
[1:31:05] got a few more minutes
[1:31:09] and and then we'll be through
[1:31:13] uh Revelations 5:9. This is after the
[1:31:15] lamb
[1:31:17] took the book from him that sat on the
[1:31:19] throne and the four beasts and the 24
[1:31:22] elders, they sang a new song, saying,
[1:31:26] Thou art worthy.
[1:31:29] to take the book and to open the seals
[1:31:32] thereof. For thou was slain and has
[1:31:35] redeemed us to God by the blood out of
[1:31:38] every kindred, tongue, and people and
[1:31:40] nation, and has made us unto our God
[1:31:44] kings and priests, and we shall reign on
[1:31:47] the earth. Amen.
[1:31:51] Praise God.
[1:31:55] Our names were in that book.
[1:31:58] And I beheld and heard the voice of many
[1:32:01] angels round about the throne. And the
[1:32:03] and the beast and the elders and the
[1:32:06] number of them was 10,000 times 10,000
[1:32:09] and thousands of thousands. Well, that's
[1:32:12] a lot.
[1:32:14] And you know what they were saying with
[1:32:16] a loud voice? Worthy is the lamb that
[1:32:19] was slain to receive power and riches
[1:32:23] and wisdom and strength. And what honor
[1:32:26] and glory and blessings. Amen. He's
[1:32:29] worthy today. That's right.
[1:32:32] And every creature which is in heaven
[1:32:34] and on earth and under the earth and
[1:32:36] such as are in the sea and all that are
[1:32:39] in them heard me John saying who is
[1:32:42] writing this. Blessing and honor and
[1:32:46] glory and power be unto him that sitth
[1:32:49] on the throne and unto the Lamb forever
[1:32:51] and ever. I think the, you know, John
[1:32:53] represents the bride, right? I believe
[1:32:55] the bride is the one that's honoring God
[1:32:58] today.
[1:33:00] I mean, if your body wants to be in
[1:33:01] church and not praise God, you need to
[1:33:03] tell your body to straighten up to the
[1:33:04] word.
[1:33:08] Don't listen to your feelings because
[1:33:10] your feelings have gotten you in trouble
[1:33:11] before. Your feelings made you want to
[1:33:14] punch out your kids, punch out your
[1:33:15] spouse, say, "I quit." That's what your
[1:33:19] feelings have done.
[1:33:21] So don't go by your feelings. The word
[1:33:23] of God says, "Praise him. He's worthy to
[1:33:25] be praised." Amen.
[1:33:27] And the four beasts said, "Amen."
[1:33:31] Should we praise him? Amen. Praise.
[1:33:34] Amen.
[1:33:37] I feel like singing it. Amen. Should we
[1:33:39] praise him? Amen.
[1:33:42] Probably need to have Sister Lynn come
[1:33:44] up here and lead us in that.
[1:33:46] [Laughter]
[1:33:49] And the four beasts said, "Amen." And
[1:33:51] the four and 20 elders fell down and
[1:33:53] worshiped him that liveth forever and
[1:33:55] ever. Revelations 4:10. Two more verses
[1:33:57] here. Two more sets of scriptures.
[1:34:00] Revelations 4:10. The four and 20 elders
[1:34:03] fell down before him that sat on the
[1:34:06] throne and worshiped him that liveth
[1:34:07] forever and ever and cast their crowns
[1:34:10] before him, saying, "Thou art worthy, oh
[1:34:13] Lord, to receive glory and honor and
[1:34:17] power. For thou hast created all things,
[1:34:20] that includes you sitting in the seat
[1:34:22] today." Amen.
[1:34:24] And for
[1:34:27] God's pleasure are you created and were
[1:34:30] created. Amen.
[1:34:33] Amen.
[1:34:35] So you're not your own. You're bought
[1:34:36] with a price. God bought you back at
[1:34:39] Calvary. He just didn't purchase your
[1:34:41] salvation to not go to hell. He actually
[1:34:44] purchased your life. Yes. As mature sons
[1:34:48] and daughters,
[1:34:50] even as a mature wife of of Jesus
[1:34:53] Christ. Revelations 19:7 says, "Let us
[1:34:55] be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[1:34:58] him for the marriage of the lamb has
[1:35:00] come and his wife have made herself
[1:35:03] ready."
[1:35:05] So let us be glad and rejoice. Let's
[1:35:07] stand together and give honor to him.
[1:35:10] Yes. For the marriage of the lamb is
[1:35:13] come and his wife have made herself
[1:35:15] ready. I we don't I wonder how does she
[1:35:19] make herself ready?
[1:35:21] That would be a good sermon, wouldn't
[1:35:23] it? How does she How does she make
[1:35:26] herself ready?
[1:35:28] I think we all should go home and like
[1:35:30] write a list.
[1:35:33] What makes us ready,
[1:35:36] right?
[1:35:37] Amen. Because I think too often some
[1:35:40] people think just coming to church makes
[1:35:42] them ready.
[1:35:46] God help us. Let us honor our heavenly
[1:35:48] father who is worthy to be honored.
[1:35:51] Let's sing that. Thou art worthy. Thou
[1:35:54] art worthy.
[1:36:00] Amen. How many's How many is happy
[1:36:02] today?
[1:36:04] Amen.
[1:36:06] Thou
[1:36:08] art worthy.
[1:36:11] Thou
[1:36:13] art worthy.
[1:36:16] Thou
[1:36:17] art worthy, oh Lord,
[1:36:24] to receive all
[1:36:28] gloryy and honor.
[1:36:33] Glory
[1:36:34] and honor and power.
[1:36:40] For thou hast created,
[1:36:44] has all things created.
[1:36:49] Thou hast created
[1:36:53] all things
[1:36:58] and for thy pleasure
[1:37:02] we are created.
[1:37:05] For thou
[1:37:07] art worthy, oh Lord,
[1:37:14] thou art worthy.
[1:37:18] Thou art worthy.
[1:37:22] Thou art worthy, oh Lord,
[1:37:30] to receive glory.
[1:37:34] Glory
[1:37:36] and honor.
[1:37:38] Glory
[1:37:40] and honor and power.
[1:37:46] Thou has created
[1:37:50] has all things created.
[1:37:54] Thou has created
[1:37:58] all things.
[1:38:02] and for thy pleasure.
[1:38:06] They are created
[1:38:09] for thou
[1:38:11] art worthy, oh Lord.
[1:38:16] Amen. As before we sing that again, but
[1:38:19] maybe we just I just want you to get
[1:38:22] tucked in and I want you just to think
[1:38:24] about you're the only
[1:38:27] person standing on the planet. There's
[1:38:29] no other people. There's no birds.
[1:38:32] There's no trees. It's just you. And I
[1:38:36] want you to think that God created you
[1:38:38] for a purpose
[1:38:40] as we sing this. And I believe that God
[1:38:43] wants to get honor and glory from you. I
[1:38:45] I think about this. The scripture tells
[1:38:47] us that he wanted to get glory from
[1:38:48] Pharaoh.
[1:38:52] How much more does he want to get glory
[1:38:54] from his own people? Amen.
[1:38:57] Thou
[1:38:59] art worthy.
[1:39:02] Thou
[1:39:03] art worthy.
[1:39:06] Thou art worthy,
