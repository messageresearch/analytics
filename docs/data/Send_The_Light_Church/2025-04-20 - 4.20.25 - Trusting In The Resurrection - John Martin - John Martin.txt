They went off and told everybody, "Well, their disciples are going around. They're a bunch of cannibals. They take a bit of cut his toe off and here eat his toe. That's he's eating his flesh, drinking his blood." They made all kinds of stories. And then they said, "Oh, Mary's better than Jesus.

All the children ought to know what what Jesus did for us. He He went to Calvary. He died for us that we might have an opportunity to receive the Holy Ghost. Amen. And unless we receive the Holy Ghost, we still need to be teaching the children what they ought to know because there's more to the resurrection, more to Calvary, more than to the resurrection than just the act that Christ did. We must receive it into our personal lives. Amen. God bless you this morning. Can you turn with me if you would to the book of Matthew chapter 28 for opening scripture and then also in Romans chapter 8. Matthew 28 and Romans 8. Brother Gideon, brother Boaz send their greetings to the church, the family uh this morning. I want to wish you happy Easter. Amen. It's nice to get a greetings from India and Africa. Amen. Amen. So good to be associated with brethren around the world. Amen. And before we begin reading God's precious word, let's look to the author of this, our heavenly father. As we approach thee, Lord, we approach thee with uh with reverence and fear, respect, knowing, Lord, that our God is a consuming fire and that you you want to be first in this church and in this sanctuary and in this service and in our hearts, our minds. Lord, we offer our ourselves to you this morning. We pray that if there is anything between us and you that you would please cleanse us with your blood, forgive us of our trespasses, that this morning you would have the preeminence, Lord, inside of us. come and bless your word to our heart as we read it. Lord, give us ears to catch the very message that you have for us today. Let us walk out of the service today with a a deepness with you that we didn't have when we came. Father, we'll be ever grateful for this. We're trusting you now. We pray these things in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Matthew chapter 28. We're going to start with verse number 5 through 7. And the and the angel answered and said unto the woman, the woman, "Fear not, for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified. He is not here, for he is risen as he said. Come see the place where the Lord lay, and go quickly, and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he goeth before you into Galilee. There shall ye see him. Lo, I have told you. Amen. And then Romans chapter 8, one verse there, verse number 11. But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you. God bless you. May be seated. Uh the last few services we've been talking about trust and trying to build our trust in God and his word. This morning we want to entitle this message trusting in the resurrection. Trusting in the resurrection. And when we look at this verse in Matthew, um, come see the place where the Lord lay, go tell the disciples that he is risen. What does it mean to each of us that God is risen? Amen. It's really the question that I think would be good to to ponder. I at one time an angel said um that you will find the babe Jesus laying in a manger. One time Jesus was laying in a boat getting some rest. One time Jesus said, "Verily, verily I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am." Amen. And at one time Jesus was laying in the tomb and an angel said over 2,000 years ago, "Come see the place where the Lord lay." Today we could ask the question, "Where is the Lord laying now? Where is he at? Where is he dwelling?" Stephen, a deacon in the church, was speaking to the Sanhedrin Council in Acts chapter 7 verse 47. He was just a deacon, but he was speaking the truth to the Sanhedrin Jewish Council. And he said, "But Solomon built him a house. How be it, the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as sayeth the prophet. Heaven is my throne, and earth is my foottool. What house will you build me, sayaeth the Lord, and what is the place of my rest? Have not ma have not my hand made all these things? Amen. And then he says here, you stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost, as your fathers did, so do ye. Amen. And I'm just wondering sometimes how how much God wants to come and rest inside of us. Wants to come and find a dwelling there just to to give rest to our souls. He said he would give us rest, but we need to labor to enter into that rest. the Holy Ghost is trying to find a rest or a dwelling in the heart of men. And Jesus is is knocking on the door to come in. Amen. and and and Satan, you know, he comes he comes to church, he comes every time we read the Bible, listen to tapes, he comes and he tries to provide us with a watered down gospel, that uh Christ did it all at Calvary, which we sing he did it all. He paid it all, right? it it's not by works. We believe that, but that doesn't mean that we don't have to die out and receive God into our lives. And so, the enemy wants us to to focus on what Christ has done. And and it's important that we do, but it's also important that we move on, that we trust in what the resurrection was all about. Amen. Brother Brandham said in the message the doctor on Dr. Moses, if your heart's really right before God and you're taught right and believing right and walk up there with assurance, something's going to happen because God's more willing to give you the Holy Ghost than you are willing to accept it. True. So, we know we're not waiting on God. That's all there is to it. The law having a shadow. Brother Ram says, "Now look, if he's so merciful to heal that little girl, which she has to die someday, this body um how much more is he willing to give you the Holy Spirit that you're hungering for it to let you live forever?" So, we see the we we see brother Bram's trying to show us that if God is willing to do that for your body, knowing that one day your body's going to die anyways. It's just a temporal blessing. How much more does he want to give you the Holy Ghost? Said, "Why are you standing? You know what I believe? 10,000 years ago, maybe before the foundation of the world, God put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life, and that's what's pulling on you tonight." He said that's what's powing in your heart is what he put there before the foundation of the world. That's the word of God that spoke that can't fail. That's right. Amen. End time evangelism. Brother Brandham says he wants to bless you. He He's ready. He's pressing. Can you imagine taking all the water in the earth, the seas and everything and pound it in one 4ft pipe and put it up there? He says the pressure would be on the bottom of it trying to find a little crevice to to leak its way through. That's like the pressure of the Holy Spirit trying to come down on every life. Amen. I mean, if we get a revelation of this right here, we can just go home. I mean, we could just start praising the Lord and say, "God, fill me because I know what's standing in the way." Imagine the amount of pressure that would be at the bottom of that pipe and the power that our will has to say, "No, Lord, I don't want to come in. I want my will." The resurrection will not do nothing for the people who do not like God in their heart. So we must we must trust the resurrection inside of us that God wants to come inside of us and do what number one our flesh don't want done. I understand that. Our flesh don't want him to come in and and and control. And you can't wait for it, too. Look, I'm at this age and it hasn't happened yet, right? It it hasn't. That when Jesus said die daily, he meant die daily. And there there's no shortcuts. It wasn't until you're 20 and then you're off the hook. And in order for God to keep working in our lives the way we desire him to in a supernatural way, we have to be willing to die out and let the Holy Ghost come in. We've seen that let the Holy Ghost come in. Province, too often people resist the Holy Ghost. And Stephen said, "You stiff necked, stiff necked." I'd hate to be in that sermon. And uncircumcised in heart. Amen. In other words, the heart never changed. Right. Right. And ears. You do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did. So do you. And God knows who comes in the church and kind of just sits there and resist. Like this is not what I want to hear. Well, they they didn't want to hear Stephen either. That really was God speaking to me. And it makes you like to pay attention. Maybe that was for me. Maybe I need to. Wow, I should have been listening more. That's how we should be every service. God is calling us not to be um some pew warmer in church. He wants us to be an active bride member. Active like worshiping him in spirit and truth, hungering and thirsting for righteousness, wanting to be more like him. Who do you think God's going to pick to be his bride? I think we should listen to the to the choosing of a bride, and we'll find out what kind of bride God is looking for. Someone that's just not claiming to be the bride. Remember the other ladies in that? They were saying, "Oh, no. He's going to choose me." They all had the attitude, "Oh, I'm bright. He's choosing me." But it was that humble little lady who just did her job, didn't want to be noticed, took a back seat. God's got his eyes on us. Amen. Praise the Lord. Turn with me if you would to First Corinthians chapter 15. If the word of God doesn't re resurrect in us, how will we be resurrected? Because he's only coming back for the word. 15. I want to start with verse number one. This really all goes together today. You know, I even had some thoughts. I'm not saying they were of the Lord, but I had some thoughts that we get out of service early today. I really wanted to, but I got like half my notes to go yet. And I I had half to start with. Amen. Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also you did receive, and wherein you do stand. And by the way, you are saved. By which also you are saved, if if you keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain. That's the word. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received. How that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures. And that he was buried and he rose again the third day according to the scriptures. And that he was seen of Cphus then of the 12. After that he was seen above the 500 brethren at once of whom the greater part remained unto this present. But some are fallen asleep. After that he was seen of James. Then of all the apostles, at last of all he was seen of me also, as a one born out of due season, due time. For I am the least of the apostles, but I am not me to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than they all. Yet not I, but it was the grace of God which was uh with me. Therefore, whether it is were I or they, so we preach, and so we believe. Now if Christ is preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? Now he is speaking of the actual resurrection. But I want you I want this scripture to be to each of you individually. I want you to ask the question because Christ should be resurrected in our lives. Amen. Now if Christ is preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the I I don't want some of our lives to say that he hasn't resurrected in us. But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen inside of us. And if Christ be not risen in us, then is our preaching vain? And your faith is also vain. Amen. Yay. We have found false uh we are false found false witnesses of God because we have testified of God that he has risen raised up Christ whom he raised not up. If so that the dead rise night not. For if the dead rise not then is not Christ risen? Uh then is not Christ risen. And if Christ be not raised your faith is in vain. Ye are yet in your sins. and they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If if in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. Now I want to say this. How many has accepted Jesus Christ? How many has accepted Jesus Christ as your savior? I want to ask this question. Is this enough? Brother said in the message, God's provided way. He says, "Now remember, you just accepted Christ. Now God will give you the Holy Ghost in confirmation of your faith." Yes. In the message, God perfecting his right says, "But God gave Abraham the seal of circumcision as a confirmation that he received his faith." The Bible said today that we're sealed into his kingdom by the Holy Ghost, and if you say you believe and God hasn't given you the Holy Ghost, he hasn't confirmed that he's even received your faith yet. Amen. I think we're doing the the right thing by accepting Christ into our life, making a public confession, get baptized, but I believe that we should continue on seeking the Holy Ghost. Amen. And be active in it. Not have to be pushed to go in the prayer room. Not to be pushed to come to the altar. not being pushed to be dedicate your some time in your homes and and fast and and get into the message and get filled with the word and and get a better attitude and and become more humble and more reverent before God in the church. Should be real. It should be more real to us. Romans 8:10. And if Christ be in you, Romans 8:10, and if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin. But the spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, then he that raised up Christ is going to do the same thing to you. And this is the scripture that we need to like Post on her refrigerator. Post on her visor. Post on her mirror in our bedroom. Post it. Post it. Post it till we become challenged. And when we become challenged, then we'll begin seeking what we need to do to get more of the Holy Ghost. Because this this body needs to be quickened right here. Amen. I want to be quickened. I want to love like God loves. I want to forgive like God forgives. I want to have joy in the middle of my trials. I I don't want to be just having joy when I at certain times. Amen. But all times, I I I I want to I want to be merciful. I want to be longsuffering. I want to be gentle and and meek and and and and temperant. Yes. And I want I want the life of Christ. And that comes only by the life of Christ. Amen. And and we're going to be put through the test, too. Now, now, now the thing is, I would never, not a person in here, I would ever say that you don't have the Holy Ghost. I would never say that. I would never say that. But if I can convince you to seek more of God, you'll never regret it. Amen. You'll never regret it. Look at verse 12 here. Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. We're a debtor one way or the other. We're either a debt to the flesh and we're going to just do what our flesh wants to do or we're a debtor to God to live for God to do to let the spirit of God have its way inside our life. Brother Brandham said in the message Abraham he said he give the Holy Spirit for action. Yes. For service. He give the Holy Ghost for action. For service. Amen. If our lives are not serving the body, we're not reaching out for a new soul. Absolutely. I I question what spirit you're saying you have. Amen. Because Hebrews 13:8 says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. Just as Jesus was after the 12 disciples got the Holy Ghost, they started doing the same thing. And Paul came later, Saul came later, he started doing the same thing. And everybody's got the Holy Ghost since then is doing the same thing. Amen. Now, if we come short of that, I I just say like this. We need either be quickened. We need a a a time with God to get back on the track or we got to come to grips that maybe I don't got enough Holy Ghost because God set the Holy Ghost for a purpose. Amen. In the message um the great warrior and we're finishing up. He says you say, "Well, I'm a believer." Well, if God's never given you the Holy Ghost, you're not a believer yet. That's true. See, I could never say that you don't got the Holy Ghost, but I didn't say the prophet couldn't say it. That's right. For God's under obligation to give you the Holy Ghost. When he said, "Repent, be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost," God's under obligation to do it. For it's to who? The apostles. No sir. Peter said it's for you and your children and them that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. Amen. So no matter how far it is, it's for every believer. Oh, theologians smear and putty over that. And and that don't make any difference because she's she's sprouting up everywhere now. And I'm so happy for the Lord Jesus and for his people. All right, just two more quick two more quick quotes here in the message approaching to God. The approach to God, brother Brand says, "De out to self." Come through the blood of Christ. Amen. Then you can approach the father and he will give you the Holy Spirit. That will make you a believer. Because if it's not, that's because it's not you that's believing anymore. It's the Holy Spirit in you and your nature's changed in the mar in the message marriage of the lamb brother says and then if you haven't received the Holy Ghost pray God give you the Holy Ghost and fill you and make you a member of the bride. Remember by one spirit we're all baptized into the body. We need the Holy Ghost. Let's stand together. God bless you. So the the good news was there's good news and bad news. The good news was we were able to get through all the notes. Amen. The bad news is it went the whole hour. We weren't able to get out sooner. I was really hoping that I wanted to do something for the church, right? I wanted to just I believe the Lord is pleased in the message getting across that we need more just God wants to feel more loved and desired. And I'll just say like this, whatever God has spoken to you, you you're the only one that can make the difference. you you take the word get serious with I know you'll never regret it and I understand that maybe you tried in the past and you didn't get what you were looking for but that only means that God wants you to continue on whatever reason that he has but don't give up don't stop short you keep believing keep seeking you got breath keep doing it because obviously we justen many people have have gone on. We only got a all of us only got a certain amount of time that we have left. And I don't think we can get a enough Holy Ghost. Uh uh but I believe we can get to a place of complacency and we just we want to stay stay away from that. Amen. Let's bow our hearts in in a word of prayer. I wonder if there would be anyone here today that says, "Brother John, I want to make a commitment today. And I believe with my heart is strong enough, sincere enough. I want to make a a commitment to seek more of the Holy Spirit in my life, this resurrected power. And I want you to pray with me that I would receive more of this." God bless these hands. Amen. Almost just all the hands, almost all the hands are raised here today. God, God I believe is pleased with all of our hearts. Amen. Heavenly Father, we come to you with sincerity. We thank you for your bride here, Lord. They have received the message today. They want to trust in all that this resurrection has for them. And Lord, as they have put this this foot forward in their heart, as your word says, "Draw nigh to me, I'll draw nigh to you." Lord, I pray that you would meet them. And Lord, that you would give to them doublefold as they would give to you just because you're such a good God. It would be so encouraging, Lord, that whatever effort, Lord, that they would put forth, that you would just double it back to them. Yes. And that Lord would encourage them to to do a little bit more and that that relationship could just grow and that power could be more manifested. And Lord, we want to be filled with so much power that it wouldn't matter what you would want us to do, we would just be willing to do it. Amen. we wouldn't have to worry about any of the pressures of this life, but we would just follow you. Please bless us, Lord, as we seek to become more like you and to have our nature more like you, Lord. We're holding on to this scripture.
