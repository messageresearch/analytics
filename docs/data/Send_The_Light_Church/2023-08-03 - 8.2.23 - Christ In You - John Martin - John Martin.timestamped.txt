[1:05] Jesus Jesus is here
[2:59] Lord we stand here in need of you
[3:04] what a privilege it is to be in your
[3:07] presence but Lord we're unworthy
[3:10] unworthy
[3:11] of your presence unworthy that you would
[3:17] come amongst us and unveil yourself and
[3:20] reveal to us
[3:22] more of your life to us
[3:26] but God we humbly bow before you
[3:31] Thank You for Your Grace today thank you
[3:34] thank you for your presence thank you
[3:36] for being faithful to your word
[3:40] thank you Lord for each and every one of
[3:42] your children today that have that same
[3:45] love in their heart for you I want to
[3:48] please you and want to
[3:50] be ready in that hour that you would
[3:52] call us home
[3:54] Lord we're looking to you and as your
[3:57] blessings upon the reading of your word
[3:58] today bless the ears that were here
[4:01] bless these lips that would speak
[4:04] Lord may you be in it all we thank you
[4:07] for these things in Jesus Christ's name
[4:10] amen amen Colossians chapter 1 starting
[4:15] with verse number 23.
[4:19] if ye continue in the faith
[4:23] grounded and settled and be not moved
[4:27] away from the hope of the Gospel which
[4:30] ye have heard in which was preached to
[4:33] every creature that is under Heaven
[4:36] wherever I Paul made a minister
[4:39] who now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[4:42] and fill up that which is behind the
[4:45] afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
[4:48] his body's sake which is
[4:50] the church where have I made a minister
[4:53] according to the dispensation
[4:56] of God which is given to me for you to
[5:00] fulfill the word of God Amen even the
[5:05] mystery which had been hid from ages and
[5:07] from Generations but now is made
[5:10] manifest to his Saints to whom God would
[5:13] make known what is the riches of the
[5:16] glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
[5:19] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[5:26] whom we preach warning every man and
[5:29] teaching every man in all wisdom that we
[5:31] may present every man perfect in Christ
[5:33] Jesus
[5:35] where unto I also labor striving
[5:39] according to his working witch worketh
[5:43] in me mightily
[5:46] God bless you may be seated we want to
[5:48] entitle this Christ in you amen
[5:52] amen and for a subject Christ quickens
[5:55] us to action
[5:57] amen so
[6:03] I'll say it like this it what good would
[6:05] it be for Christ to be here
[6:08] if he was not in action
[6:11] in our men's meeting brother Ron brought
[6:14] up the salt of the earth and
[6:18] what good would it be to have a salt
[6:21] shaker on your table if it lost his
[6:24] savior in other words when you put the
[6:25] crystals on your food your French fries
[6:27] or whatever you couldn't taste the salt
[6:30] what good would it be your mouth wasn't
[6:32] even not not having on the table and if
[6:35] you had a candle or a light bulb and and
[6:40] and you put a bushel over it
[6:44] what good would it be to have the light
[6:46] going if it's not able to bring light
[6:48] into the room
[6:50] so what good would it be to be have
[6:52] Christ in our life if he's not working
[6:55] mightily in US
[6:59] Romans 8 tells us that if the spirit of
[7:03] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[7:05] dwells in you he that raised up Christ
[7:08] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[7:11] mortal Body by his Spirit which which
[7:13] what which dwelleth with you which
[7:16] dwelleth in you
[7:19] amen so if Christ is in us he's going to
[7:22] Quicken us
[7:24] this service is a is kind of for ma
[7:27] mature audiences only
[7:30] we want to challenge ourselves
[7:32] because
[7:35] we want our church to be more mature
[7:40] it isn't
[7:43] how many great ministers we could have
[7:46] here how many great messages they could
[7:49] bring
[7:50] but brother Branham taught us the beauty
[7:52] of the church is the character of the
[7:55] people
[7:56] and if we cannot get the the character
[8:00] that Christ wants us to have before the
[8:02] Rapture what good would it do to have
[8:05] the best services in the world
[8:07] so we're after one thing we're after the
[8:10] manifestation of Christ in our lives
[8:14] so
[8:16] every Church uh has every home as every
[8:21] business
[8:22] has uh problems
[8:25] and where there's people there's
[8:27] problems
[8:29] and
[8:31] our hope is Christ in us the hope of
[8:34] glory the hope of working out problems
[8:36] and and we want we want Christ to work
[8:39] mightily in US
[8:42] now
[8:43] there is the tendency when there's a
[8:45] problem for somebody else to handle it
[8:50] but Christ has caught us to handle it
[8:53] amen and to be honest with you I I want
[8:56] to step in to the role
[8:59] of helping
[9:01] I don't ever want to be found in the
[9:04] eyes of God that I shunned my
[9:07] responsibility of helping
[9:10] I don't want to entertain the thoughts
[9:12] of the devil that tells me that doesn't
[9:14] have anything to do with you
[9:18] I don't want to give myself to a reasons
[9:22] why not to wash somebody's feet
[9:25] why not to humble myself and help a
[9:28] situation
[9:30] if the more personal my relationship was
[9:34] with God
[9:35] the more I'll be letting him work
[9:38] mightily in me
[9:41] amen
[9:44] now we can't do anything
[9:47] ourselves to overcome any problem
[9:51] but our hope is in Jesus Christ not just
[9:54] the hope that Jesus is going to remember
[9:56] us when we're in our situation or a
[10:00] problem but that he's actually going to
[10:01] work inside of us to work out the
[10:04] problem
[10:06] that's our hope it's Christ in us the
[10:09] hope of glory for every situation amen
[10:15] amen too often we take a back seat to
[10:17] the devil
[10:19] let them push us around
[10:21] cause all sorts of problems but Christ
[10:24] the Holy Ghost
[10:26] wants to work mightily inside of us
[10:30] remember that's his desire but it takes
[10:33] courage it takes faith it takes standing
[10:35] up for love
[10:36] [Music]
[10:41] we don't want to be
[10:43] lacking
[10:45] Faith to handle something and we don't
[10:48] want to be lacking commitment
[10:51] amen
[10:53] that's a big one amen
[10:55] amen did you know the number one reason
[10:56] for divorce today is because a lack of
[10:59] commitment
[11:01] it's up 75 percent
[11:06] because of a lack of commitment of
[11:08] course in this age anything goes right
[11:10] it's getting worse and worse
[11:14] 60 percent was
[11:17] too much arguing and too much conflict
[11:23] there's a lacking of commitment
[11:26] 66 percent of men 74 percent of women
[11:30] think that their partner
[11:33] should have worked harder to save the
[11:34] marriage
[11:38] of course it's always the other person
[11:40] right
[11:42] nobody wants to step up and say I'll do
[11:45] whatever I got to do to make things
[11:47] better
[11:49] because I didn't cause the problem it
[11:52] wasn't my fault and I shouldn't have to
[11:55] do it and I got to do all the work in
[11:57] this marriage and
[11:59] oh my
[12:02] you can see the way that the world
[12:04] thinks is so different than the way that
[12:07] Christ thinks
[12:12] the way Christ thinks if you want to be
[12:14] great be a servant of all
[12:17] the way we think is I'll serve what I
[12:19] want if I get something out of it
[12:21] and if I feel I owe it
[12:25] people are falling in love with
[12:27] themselves more and more
[12:31] you know I just I had heard that
[12:33] there's a a lady that married herself
[12:38] it can't get any more you know
[12:42] loving yourself
[12:45] love for others is fading away
[12:48] 75 of the people aren't committed to
[12:52] working out a problem
[12:55] they don't care enough
[12:58] it's no different than our relationships
[13:00] here in church
[13:02] you know Satan does not want us one big
[13:05] happy family
[13:08] in fact the moment we are Satan's got
[13:11] his guns pointed at us because he won't
[13:15] let us stay that way
[13:19] some people would rather run away than
[13:22] work out their problems
[13:25] the scripture tells us that we don't
[13:27] want the sun to go down upon a wrath
[13:30] amen
[13:32] amen that's in our homes right
[13:34] don't let the sun go down upon your
[13:36] Wrath in other words if there's a
[13:38] problem take care of it before you go to
[13:40] sleep
[13:42] so the the mind of Christ the heart of
[13:45] Christ is to fix problems soon amen
[13:48] don't let him Fester don't let them go
[13:51] don't let them keep you know on and on
[13:53] and on and just like always we're doing
[13:56] with that mindset is is expressing that
[13:59] we're not committed we don't care enough
[14:01] and Christ is not really working
[14:03] mightily inside of us right
[14:07] right the natural types of spiritual
[14:10] let's say like this if you're good at
[14:12] working out problems in your home
[14:14] working out problems in church is no
[14:16] different
[14:20] if you're not good at working problems
[14:22] out at home you're probably not good at
[14:23] working up problems in your workplace or
[14:25] in church
[14:26] [Music]
[14:28] Edmund Burke said the only thing
[14:32] necessary for the Triumph of evil
[14:36] is for good men to do nothing
[14:40] what a quote for good men to do nothing
[14:44] there's a problem well you want you want
[14:47] evil to Triumph in the situation do
[14:49] nothing
[14:52] well it's not my responsibility says who
[14:55] says who I mean think about it God even
[14:59] went to Cain
[15:01] all right
[15:02] where's your brother
[15:04] and his attitude is that am I My
[15:07] Brother's Keeper
[15:11] so if he had an expectation of that of
[15:14] Cain how much more the elect how much
[15:16] more of the predestinate how much more
[15:18] the brother and sister are claiming to
[15:20] serve God
[15:24] people are not committed to
[15:26] communicating in love
[15:29] working out their differences
[15:32] but it's easier to talk to others
[15:35] do you know it's easier to talk to other
[15:37] people about a problem you have with
[15:40] somebody else and it is to actually talk
[15:42] to that person that you got a problem
[15:43] with that's true it's true
[15:51] well we can complain about the problems
[15:52] we can murmur under our breath we can
[15:55] even make threats
[15:57] all this stuff solves Discord Division
[16:00] isms and schisms in the church and this
[16:04] is why we need to make sure our Yeezy
[16:07] our neigh is nay and that we are
[16:10] committed to working out problems
[16:13] committed
[16:15] because what good would it be for Christ
[16:17] to be here if he wasn't in action
[16:20] what good was it for Christ to be inside
[16:23] of me if he's not working mightily in me
[16:29] what we need is an old-fashioned trip to
[16:31] the altar
[16:34] need to be values about repenting get
[16:37] our hearts right with God
[16:40] get in sync with the Holy Ghost
[16:43] we need to get the Holy Ghost working
[16:45] back inside of us
[16:48] we need to follow Paul as he followed
[16:50] Christ and in our opening scripture
[16:52] laboring and striving as the Holy Ghost
[16:56] worked in him mightily
[16:59] he was he was he was he would say no God
[17:02] is working mightily in me he he could
[17:05] say that can you say that today
[17:07] can you say the Holy Ghost is working
[17:09] mightily in you
[17:12] come on
[17:13] somebody should be able to say Amen to
[17:16] this one here
[17:18] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[17:20] spirit and the bond of peace that takes
[17:22] work
[17:23] with all lowliness and meekness and
[17:25] long-suffering and forbearing one
[17:27] another in love
[17:28] how long do we got to do this brother
[17:30] John until we come into the unity of the
[17:32] faith
[17:35] well brother John it's not my fault
[17:38] excuse me what does that have to do with
[17:40] anything
[17:44] are you a Christian only to what's your
[17:47] fault if you're buffeted for your own
[17:48] mistakes and you take it patiently
[17:52] this is an acceptable with God
[17:56] but if you're buffing it for somebody
[17:58] else's mistakes and you take a patient
[18:00] this is acceptable to God
[18:03] so every church every home every
[18:05] workplace is going to have problems
[18:11] and we can run away from them but I
[18:13] guarantee
[18:15] they're going to follow you
[18:17] because they're everywhere problems are
[18:19] a part of life
[18:22] yes the thing is we just don't want to
[18:24] handle problems carnally
[18:28] amen the weapons of our Warfare are not
[18:31] carnal
[18:33] or spiritual
[18:35] we use the Holy Ghost
[18:39] we use love
[18:42] we we use a long-suffering and patience
[18:46] you know the Bible says speak the truth
[18:48] in love
[18:51] now the beauty of problems
[18:53] is God uses them to help mold our
[18:56] character
[18:58] and we need it for a rapture
[19:01] problems are really nothing to fear
[19:03] right
[19:03] but people fear problems all the time
[19:06] and it's because they don't know how to
[19:08] handle them or
[19:10] they just simply don't care enough
[19:14] either way the result is the same the
[19:17] Holy Ghost is not working mightily in
[19:19] them
[19:20] so fear diffuses God working in your
[19:23] life
[19:24] fear and faith cannot coincide
[19:29] brother Branham said either one or the
[19:31] other is in the control tower
[19:33] doubt or faith
[19:37] if we don't have the hope of Christ
[19:40] working in our lives now working our
[19:43] problems how are we going to have faith
[19:46] for a Rapture right amen so
[19:50] if we're not handling problems then we
[19:52] need to get committed to God
[19:55] humble ourselves to seek more of the
[19:57] Holy Ghost
[20:00] spend you know Jesus said these words to
[20:03] the spirit that you and I face every day
[20:06] be zealous and repent
[20:11] and that we face that Spirit every day
[20:14] that spirit that says you don't need to
[20:16] correct
[20:18] lay back
[20:19] you don't need to
[20:22] and his answer
[20:24] was be thou is to repent
[20:27] I'm so glad that Jesus went to Calvary
[20:30] for me
[20:34] amen and I'll tell you if he's the same
[20:35] yesterday tave forever he's going to go
[20:37] to he's going to die out for somebody
[20:41] amen through you he's going to show that
[20:44] same work through you
[20:46] amen
[20:47] so when you and I we see a problem in
[20:50] the church or we encounter a problem
[20:54] if you don't have hope of Christ working
[20:56] mightily inside of you at that time to
[21:00] help then I want you to do this care
[21:02] enough
[21:03] to go get serious with God
[21:07] don't keep coming to church and ignoring
[21:10] what needs to be done
[21:13] don't let the sun go down upon your
[21:15] Wrath
[21:16] don't start isms in the church don't
[21:19] just say oh this this person you know
[21:21] you know how they are
[21:24] well yeah we know how they are but who
[21:26] are you
[21:28] because what we need is Christ in you
[21:30] helping this problem
[21:34] another Brandon said if you see me doing
[21:36] wrong your duty Bound by to come and
[21:38] talk to me about it
[21:46] well they won't listen well
[21:48] I'm sorry you you have a hopeless
[21:52] attitude
[21:55] aren't you glad that Jesus never gave up
[21:57] on you amen
[22:00] and how many times have you sinned over
[22:02] and over and over
[22:05] and yet we ignore that we expect
[22:07] Perfection out of other people
[22:12] no what we need is Christ in US
[22:16] because he'll be just as loving
[22:20] as he was at Calvary
[22:24] he'll be just as long suffering
[22:26] he'll be just as meek
[22:29] he'll meet the need because God is the
[22:32] same yesterday today and forever what we
[22:33] need is we need brothers and sisters to
[22:36] be daring enough to let God work in them
[22:39] to work mightily in them so when people
[22:42] in the church see yes I see Christ in
[22:44] that person look what they're doing
[22:46] they're laying down their life to meet
[22:48] some need
[22:52] that's the church I want to be a part of
[22:54] you know it's not a very big church
[22:58] fear not little flock
[23:01] it's not very big
[23:05] God doesn't need us to talk about
[23:07] problems to other people
[23:10] what he needs is a vessel to work
[23:11] through
[23:13] let them work inside of you
[23:16] say Lord what would you hide me to do
[23:18] and now I don't know what to do
[23:21] I'm okay with not knowing what to do I
[23:23] am not okay with not seeking God to know
[23:26] what to do amen amen that shows your 75
[23:29] percent uncommitted
[23:33] the bride is committed
[23:34] [Music]
[23:39] we don't need to talk about prime the
[23:41] devil's good enough to talk about power
[23:42] he is the master of uh
[23:46] not only the master deceit but he's the
[23:48] master of accusing the brethren
[23:52] so we don't need that what we need is
[23:54] somebody to love
[23:57] love
[23:59] too often people fear that problems
[24:03] can't be worked out
[24:06] and when you get to that place where you
[24:08] don't think a problem could get worked
[24:09] out then you know what happens Pride
[24:12] enters in
[24:14] Pride
[24:17] because
[24:19] do you think Christ looks at any problem
[24:21] says
[24:22] you know that's too hard for me
[24:24] in fact we have scripture is there
[24:26] anything too hard for God Amen nothing's
[24:30] too hard for God
[24:32] and if God's in you
[24:34] look the Bible says that he would not
[24:37] put anything on you that you could not
[24:39] bear
[24:40] so the moment you think I can't handle
[24:43] this is the moment you're calling Christ
[24:45] a liar and you don't even know it
[24:49] and that's what Satan wants you to do
[24:52] he wants you to call God a liar
[25:00] Proverbs 16 says Pride goeth Before
[25:03] Destruction and a haughty spirit before
[25:05] fall
[25:08] wherefore let him that thinketh thee
[25:10] stand take heed lest he fall
[25:13] there have no temptation taken you but
[25:17] such as coming to man but God is
[25:21] faithful I'm so glad that's in there
[25:23] God is faithful
[25:26] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[25:29] above that which you are able to handle
[25:35] but will with that Temptation also make
[25:39] a way of Escape that you may be able to
[25:41] bear it
[25:43] bear one another's burdens and so
[25:45] fulfill the law of Christ
[25:48] see if Christ is working mildly and you
[25:50] you not scared of anything
[25:54] amen there's nothing to be afraid of
[26:01] we must believe that we can overcome
[26:03] every situation because God is faithful
[26:06] and he's inside of you
[26:09] God is not going to slip up and give you
[26:12] something that's a little bit too hard
[26:13] for you oh I wasn't watching
[26:17] so anytime you're acting like God is not
[26:20] in control of your situation you need to
[26:22] get to the Altar and you need to get
[26:24] reconnected with God
[26:29] John 16 verse 32
[26:32] Jesus speaking here he says behold the
[26:34] hour cometh yea and is now come that ye
[26:38] shall be scattered and every man to his
[26:40] own and shall leave me alone and yet I
[26:44] am not alone
[26:47] what good words for Jesus everybody left
[26:50] him
[26:51] but his testimony is I'm not alone
[26:54] I wonder can you say that
[26:58] can you say I am not alone but God is
[27:01] the father is with me the Holy Ghost is
[27:03] inside him he's working mightily in me
[27:06] Jesus testimony was because the father
[27:09] is with me and I'll tell you if God be
[27:11] with you who can be against you
[27:14] amen what we're looking for is Believers
[27:16] in this word somebody that can believe
[27:18] this word and make it into action
[27:22] these things have I spoken unto you
[27:25] verse 33
[27:26] that in me
[27:28] you might have peace
[27:31] in the world you shall have tribulation
[27:34] but be of good cheer I have overcome the
[27:38] world
[27:40] when Christ is inside of us we have the
[27:43] upper advantage
[27:45] we have the overcomer
[27:49] it's not us overcoming it's Christ in US
[27:53] what do we overcome then we overcome
[27:55] getting ourself out of the way
[27:59] well we can get out of the way God can
[28:01] have his way
[28:04] Christ in you the hope of overcoming
[28:09] there's nothing too hard for God
[28:13] nothing to fear
[28:16] just be committed to helping the
[28:18] situation
[28:20] but the brand said the principles of
[28:22] divine heat he said the word of God will
[28:24] defeat the Devil any place anywhere
[28:26] anytime on any condition amen
[28:30] amen well brother John that's for
[28:32] somebody who's got you know real high
[28:34] faith in the word and they're gonna just
[28:36] you know they're standing mightily on
[28:38] the word and they just got so much faith
[28:40] and you know they well I gotta I got a
[28:43] quote for you too
[28:45] I don't believe the weakest Christian is
[28:48] in this church
[28:52] but wherever he's at
[28:55] when he gets on his knees the devil
[28:58] trembles
[29:02] so I think we got ammunition for our
[29:05] situation here
[29:11] God sent the Holy Ghost to run our
[29:13] church
[29:17] amen
[29:19] why did it take so we need more amens to
[29:22] that one
[29:23] and you know the Holy Ghost stays with
[29:25] the word
[29:26] Brian said in the impersonation of
[29:28] Christianity says no but if God meant
[29:31] for us to run his church by denomination
[29:34] or by a Creed the only thing we need is
[29:37] the intelligence of a man
[29:39] right smarter than a man better the
[29:42] smarter the man the better the church
[29:45] but that was not God's program
[29:48] God's program was for the Holy Ghost to
[29:51] run the church
[29:52] the Holy Ghost was given for the church
[29:56] and we can't have two faculties running
[29:58] the church at the same time
[30:06] if man runs it the Holy Ghost goes out
[30:10] if the Holy Ghost runs it usually the
[30:12] man goes out it's just one or the other
[30:16] and I'm just going to say it like this
[30:18] if if Christ is not working mightily in
[30:21] you then you're working you
[30:25] come on
[30:27] to whom you yield yourself servant to
[30:29] obey his servant you are
[30:33] amen it's not about us it's not about
[30:35] our ability
[30:38] to handle situations it's about our
[30:41] faith in God who lives inside of us
[30:44] greater is he that's inside of you
[30:48] than he that's in a problem
[30:51] come on
[30:53] do you if we believe that now we can go
[30:55] into action
[30:58] I don't mean this in any wrong or
[31:01] disrespectful way I do believe in
[31:06] the Bible says honor all men especially
[31:09] those of the household of faith
[31:14] but when your spirit is right
[31:17] your heart is right
[31:19] you will live that word
[31:22] you should better go to anybody about
[31:24] anything and work it through
[31:28] amen now that's the truth amen
[31:33] second Corinthians chapter 3 verse 5
[31:35] turn with me if you would there second
[31:37] Corinthians chapter 3 verse 5. don't
[31:39] know probably won't be able to get
[31:41] through the whole way you don't know how
[31:42] many times I pray Lord just give me like
[31:44] four scriptures I don't want any notes
[31:46] it just never happens and no matter how
[31:49] much I pray like that
[31:52] for some reason I just gotta
[31:55] teach
[31:57] but I do believe it's his gift
[32:01] amen all right second Corinthians
[32:03] chapter 3 verse 5 says not that we are
[32:06] sufficient of ourselves to think
[32:09] anything of ourselves
[32:12] but our sufficiency is of God
[32:19] Christ Works mightily in us who also has
[32:23] made us able Ministers of the New
[32:27] Testament
[32:28] not of the letter
[32:30] but of the spirit
[32:32] for the letter killeth but the spirit
[32:34] gives life
[32:38] no so
[32:42] you ever been in a fight with your
[32:43] spouse
[32:45] or your child
[32:47] or your mom and your dad
[32:50] and you said something you shouldn't
[32:52] have said
[32:56] might have been the truth
[32:59] might have been the truth
[33:01] but it killed
[33:04] it actually did more damage than good
[33:09] but now you get the right spirit
[33:13] and you speak that truth
[33:17] now that'll bring life to the situation
[33:19] that will help the situation because you
[33:23] can speak the truth in love
[33:25] you can
[33:27] you can't it just has to be the right
[33:29] spirit
[33:30] well how do I know look you don't know
[33:34] whether you got the right Spirit what
[33:35] you're doing don't do it
[33:39] wait till you know that you know that
[33:42] you know that the Holy Ghost is just
[33:44] pulsating you to lay down your life and
[33:47] help somebody because that's how you
[33:50] know if it's the right Spirit Well
[33:52] brother John love is corrective
[33:55] yeah the man who said that gave his life
[33:57] for you
[34:01] love is corrective
[34:04] but that doesn't mean it kills it means
[34:08] it corrects the situation
[34:10] [Music]
[34:13] Jesus one time took a towel and he
[34:16] girded himself and began to wash his
[34:18] disciples feet and he told him he says
[34:19] you don't know what I'm doing now but
[34:21] one day you will
[34:26] he said me being your master Lord you
[34:29] call me I am if I've done that to your
[34:32] feet and you're my servant
[34:36] ought you not to do that to one another
[34:41] that's when you wash
[34:44] you're you're helping you're cleaning
[34:47] you're making it our church needs a
[34:49] constant cleaning we need the we need to
[34:52] be Washed by the Water of the word we
[34:54] need to be uh Robin's shoulders with one
[34:57] another to help one another
[34:59] we need to look for ways I'm telling you
[35:02] if if you if Christ is not working
[35:05] mightily in you it wouldn't matter
[35:08] no matter what you're doing no matter
[35:10] where you're at
[35:13] to be without him
[35:15] working mightily in you is a naked
[35:18] situation
[35:21] it's a naked situation
[35:24] God has made us able ministers
[35:28] all right brother Brian said in a
[35:30] personal experience with God he says I
[35:31] believe that on the day of Pentecost the
[35:33] comforter which is the Holy Spirit
[35:37] was given which is Jesus
[35:40] Christ the spirit given to the church
[35:44] and Jesus lives in his church his people
[35:47] tonight just as he lived with them in a
[35:51] body of Flesh I love this quote I don't
[35:55] mean to get so simple but Christ is in
[35:59] our church
[36:02] Christ is in his people
[36:05] it's the same God that walked in his own
[36:09] Corporal body two thousand years ago
[36:11] with his disciples he's here today
[36:14] inside of each of you
[36:19] now we have the chance to yield our life
[36:22] crucify our flesh and let him work
[36:24] mightily in us or
[36:27] we can start
[36:28] being in control of our own church
[36:33] come on each one of you is a you are the
[36:37] Temple of the Living God you are an
[36:40] individual Church
[36:43] and either Christ is the head of your
[36:45] church
[36:46] or man is
[36:51] before Jesus left he
[36:53] told his disciples
[36:56] he would not leave them comfortless he
[36:59] said I will come to you and in John 14
[37:01] 16 it says and I pray and I will pray
[37:05] the father
[37:07] that he'll give you another comforter
[37:10] that he may what abide with you forever
[37:15] well brother John I'm going to be honest
[37:19] with you I just don't feel him abiding
[37:22] it doesn't seem like he's abiding okay
[37:26] okay
[37:29] what are you gonna do
[37:31] what are you going to do
[37:34] are you going to allow the sun to go
[37:37] down upon your wrath with God
[37:40] are you going to make that your life
[37:44] or you're going to say I'm going to get
[37:47] serious with God and take care of
[37:48] business
[37:50] every single person is responsible for
[37:53] their own walk with God
[37:55] the church is not responsible for your
[37:58] relationship
[38:01] it's not
[38:04] you don't care enough to take care of
[38:06] your relationship with God don't you
[38:07] blame the church for your situation
[38:10] come on
[38:12] we need more than just
[38:16] what we're getting on two services
[38:20] in fact if you're not doing good in your
[38:23] personal law walk you're probably not
[38:25] getting much out of the services
[38:26] true
[38:32] all right verse 17 even the spirit of
[38:35] Truth whom the world cannot receive
[38:37] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[38:39] him but you know him
[38:41] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[38:46] you
[38:47] so here we're testifying either Christ
[38:50] is in me working mightily or you know
[38:52] what my hands are up I just don't know
[38:54] what's going on
[38:55] but we need him to work out problems
[39:01] we just need it amen amen we can't well
[39:03] that's the pastor's business
[39:06] is it
[39:07] we don't have a body it's just a pastor
[39:10] and then
[39:12] one
[39:15] oh we're a body it's a body Ministry
[39:18] there's things that you say and do and
[39:21] happen and you don't shake one another's
[39:24] hand and thoughts come into your head
[39:25] and you got all this stuff going on
[39:28] you got to take care of that
[39:30] you've got to take care of that
[39:33] it's not the pastor's job
[39:37] I like what Jesus said right before he
[39:40] left when he told him teaching them to
[39:42] observe all things whatsoever commanded
[39:44] you and lo I Am With You Always even to
[39:48] the end of the world there is no excuse
[39:50] for God not working mightily in US amen
[39:54] amen
[39:56] brother Brandon said in the message of
[39:58] the law having a shadow he said the Holy
[40:01] Ghost don't change
[40:04] it's the same every time every time
[40:07] every time he says it three times
[40:10] you know what I'm beginning to think
[40:12] question
[40:14] that a lot of times people get one
[40:16] another's ghost
[40:19] instead of the Holy Ghost
[40:22] he says you watch them the way they act
[40:24] I'm telling you I I don't know if you
[40:28] you I can watch people who've been
[40:30] around other people and see they're
[40:31] acting just like that person
[40:34] yeah and I used to watch that with my
[40:36] children a lot because when they'd hang
[40:38] out with certain friends
[40:41] we do pick up one another Spirit we
[40:43] don't even realize it
[40:45] and what we really need is to spend more
[40:47] time with the Holy Ghost
[40:53] says you go into a church where the
[40:55] pastor is kind of flighty
[40:58] yeah
[41:00] Wildfire up wild fire it up
[41:05] and overnight watch the congregation be
[41:08] the same thing
[41:10] I don't want to be flighty and I Want to
[41:13] Be Wild
[41:14] and only fire it up
[41:19] I just want to be genuine
[41:22] I just want to be genuine
[41:25] brother I'm telling you it behooves you
[41:28] to get down and pray to God until the
[41:32] real Christian spirit moves in your
[41:35] heart
[41:36] and it settles all problems did you hear
[41:40] that
[41:41] when the holy spirit moves in your heart
[41:44] it settles all problems
[41:48] but if I just get
[41:49] this brother's Spirit or that brother
[41:51] Spirit it ain't going to solve any
[41:53] problem especially if you get a spirit
[41:55] under on you that doesn't like to solve
[41:58] problems
[42:02] hey you got a spirit on you that likes
[42:03] to talk about problems you'll talk about
[42:05] problems more
[42:06] you get a spirit on you that just you
[42:09] know is bothered fears
[42:12] hey you'll just get bothered in your
[42:14] fear
[42:14] you get a a a a a a proud uh you hang
[42:18] around saying that's real arrogant well
[42:20] you're gonna get arrogant
[42:22] I mean Spirits get on people
[42:25] it happened in brother by Adam's
[42:27] meetings
[42:29] they just went one from another and evil
[42:31] spirits were getting another people
[42:34] it's a real thing
[42:37] and you need to believe the word of God
[42:39] you need to hold to this word
[42:45] all right now the worshiper once purged
[42:49] how does it do
[42:51] brother Ram says when the life of the
[42:54] sacrifice comes back to the worshiper
[42:57] then it's meekness its patience its
[43:03] gentleness it's long-suffering it's
[43:06] goodness it's faith brother Brian says
[43:09] see what I mean
[43:11] do we see what brother branham's saying
[43:13] when we get the Holy Ghost
[43:15] then we've got Galatians 5 22.
[43:21] but if we get somebody else's ghost
[43:25] then we'll probably be
[43:28] expressing their fruits
[43:35] and you get the Life of Christ you have
[43:37] brother Adam says you have what you need
[43:39] to work out problems and that's what
[43:42] we're looking for
[43:44] to a spiritual Christian
[43:47] they have a god-given responsibility to
[43:51] help other people besides themselves
[43:56] Smith's wiggleworth said with every
[43:59] Revelation comes a responsibility
[44:04] now when the devil is
[44:07] accusing the Brethren okay so the devil
[44:11] could come to every one of us here and
[44:13] just tell something bad about somebody
[44:17] right
[44:20] now we would say oh wow that's terrible
[44:26] and one word I think we're doing the
[44:28] right thing well we'll just pray for him
[44:31] okay
[44:36] and then
[44:37] do nothing else
[44:42] we have a responsibility
[44:45] now I'm not saying it's your job to get
[44:47] in everybody's business
[44:50] but
[44:51] what I am saying
[44:54] is when the Devil comes and he talks to
[44:56] us
[44:57] and we don't do nothing
[45:01] we don't feel a responsibility
[45:04] I'm going to tell you you didn't get a
[45:06] revelation from God
[45:10] you just heard the whisper of the enemy
[45:14] and you thought it was God
[45:16] because if God speaks to you
[45:18] he expects you to do something with that
[45:24] and I'm telling you we're talking about
[45:26] maturing in our church that's what we're
[45:28] talking about
[45:30] and how many would like to see our
[45:32] church more mature
[45:35] to be able to have uh
[45:41] uh consolation
[45:44] that we rub shoulders with Believers
[45:46] that care
[45:48] that there's a real Comfort into that
[45:54] Brandon said it if God has changed us we
[45:58] are obligated to go help others
[46:03] so has God changed you
[46:06] okay then let's go help somebody
[46:10] so now this this there's got there's
[46:13] something in this message for everybody
[46:14] and let's just say we got some some men
[46:18] that are veterans in this gospel
[46:21] and
[46:23] they can teach the younger ones
[46:26] how
[46:27] to work out a problem if they hear about
[46:29] a problem so there's something in this
[46:32] for all of us amen
[46:35] all right Galatians chapter 6 verse
[46:37] number one
[46:40] brethren
[46:44] if I be overtaken in a fault
[46:49] I'm just playing this personally ye
[46:52] which are spiritual restore me in a
[46:56] spirit of meekness
[46:59] considering yourself
[47:02] thus you also be tempted
[47:05] so look at the responsibility here of
[47:08] course if you're not spiritual
[47:12] then
[47:13] you're not spiritual
[47:15] but remember that
[47:18] remember you're not spiritual
[47:21] oh my
[47:24] bear ye one another's burden and so
[47:26] fulfill the law of Christ
[47:30] to the spiritual believer
[47:33] we need to wash some one one another's
[47:35] feet
[47:37] the goal is to bring restoration
[47:42] not to tell a fault
[47:45] not to kill with the letter
[47:47] but to restore with the spirit
[47:53] someone's going to live this gospel
[47:55] somebody's going to live this gospel
[47:57] somebody's going to fulfill the law of
[47:59] Christ brother Brandon said then Jesus
[48:01] came and called he says that ought to
[48:03] shake us and make us get out of our
[48:05] Slumber that that we're in that lukewarm
[48:09] but you know the Bible says that we have
[48:12] to get that way
[48:14] so he can spew the whole thing out of
[48:16] his mouth did he promise it yes he did
[48:19] we all know he promised it and he will
[48:22] do it the whole church is spewed from
[48:24] his mouth
[48:26] them then then
[48:29] out of the church Comes the Bride
[48:34] the elected
[48:36] so when you start living this part of
[48:41] the Gospel
[48:43] you're showing that you're elect yes
[48:46] you're manifesting you're spiritual
[48:51] you're showing your great by washing
[48:54] other people's feet
[48:58] verse 3 for if a man think himself to be
[49:01] something when he's not
[49:05] he deceives himself
[49:08] but let every man prove his own work and
[49:10] then shall have rejoicing in himself
[49:12] alone and not in another
[49:14] for every man shall bear his own burden
[49:19] let him that is taught in the word
[49:22] communicate
[49:24] unto him that teacheth in all good
[49:27] things be not deceived God is Not Mott
[49:29] for whatsoever man saw it that shall he
[49:31] also rape for he that soweth to his
[49:34] flesh shall reap
[49:35] uh shall of the flesh reap corruption
[49:38] but he that sold to the spirit shall the
[49:40] spirit reap Everlast life Everlasting
[49:43] so what's the answer what do we do
[49:45] brother John let us not be weary in
[49:48] well-doing
[49:50] for in due season we shall reap on the
[49:53] church if we faint not
[49:58] amen I love this word
[50:02] I love building
[50:05] I love building
[50:07] and verse 10.
[50:10] as we have therefore opportunity
[50:15] let us do good unto all men
[50:19] especially unto them who are the
[50:22] household of faith
[50:24] so if you have a chance to help somebody
[50:27] restore somebody
[50:29] build if we have opportunity
[50:34] let's do it
[50:36] let's do good
[50:38] let's put it into action let's go let
[50:40] God Work mightily in you
[50:44] Ryan said the message perfect strength
[50:46] by Perfect weakness he said that's what
[50:48] we have to do today that's what I that's
[50:50] what I need that's what every man needs
[50:53] it's a loss of himself
[50:57] a loss of his ability
[51:00] a loss of what he is that he might have
[51:04] a complete yielding to the Holy Ghost
[51:08] amen
[51:09] the housewife needs that the Schoolboy
[51:12] needs that even our children
[51:14] our little children he said
[51:17] God uses problems in the church to
[51:22] temper the body
[51:25] don't be scared of problems they're
[51:27] there for a reason God knows what he's
[51:28] doing
[51:29] to neutralize
[51:32] to counterbalance the body
[51:35] to make the body more flexible to be
[51:38] able to handle diversity and problems or
[51:41] differences
[51:43] I mean can you imagine
[51:46] raising a child
[51:52] who can't
[51:56] come to an adulthood
[52:00] how hard that would be
[52:04] and there were some 1.8 million
[52:09] you know that came out of Egypt that
[52:11] never could come to the maturity of
[52:13] going into the Promised Land
[52:20] they stayed back
[52:23] they made excuses they murmured they
[52:25] complained they blame Moses they blame
[52:27] Aaron
[52:29] they blamed even Joshua and Caleb
[52:35] look
[52:37] you never heard Joshua and Caleb
[52:39] complaining
[52:41] never heard him murmuring
[52:46] brother Brandon says God will put
[52:48] certain people in their Church body just
[52:50] to help your character
[52:51] [Music]
[52:53] so why why would you be bothered because
[52:58] your your feathers are getting ruffled
[53:01] when God put that there directly to help
[53:05] your character that's how much God loves
[53:07] you
[53:09] God knows what he's doing
[53:13] the message of resurrection of Lazarus
[53:15] Brethren says think you're not strange
[53:17] that the fiery Trials come because it's
[53:19] the only it's only done to perfect your
[53:21] faith
[53:22] and to draw you closer
[53:24] all right Ephesians chapter four are we
[53:27] getting something out of this
[53:29] are you going to help me to help the
[53:31] church amen
[53:35] Ephesians chapter 4 verse 14 that we
[53:38] henceforth be no more children toss to
[53:42] and fro
[53:43] and carried about with every win of
[53:45] Doctrine by the slight of men cunning
[53:47] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[53:49] deceive but speaking the truth in love
[53:55] May grow up into him in All Things
[54:00] which is the head even Christ from whom
[54:03] the whole body now look at this the
[54:06] whole church
[54:08] is fitly joined together
[54:12] and compacted by that which every joint
[54:16] IT Supplies something to help
[54:18] according to the effectual working there
[54:21] it is again in the measure of every part
[54:26] making increase of the body unto the
[54:29] edifying of itself in love
[54:34] Hallelujah
[54:36] I'll tell you I got my sight shot on
[54:39] this today
[54:41] it may not be your heart's desire but
[54:44] I'll say
[54:47] where is God
[54:49] where is God's heart
[54:52] amen
[54:53] I know the Bible tells me he that's
[54:55] faithful and little is faithful and much
[55:00] I want to be faithful with what he's
[55:03] given me
[55:06] I want to be able you know I don't
[55:10] I don't even I I don't mean it wrong but
[55:12] I don't want any reward when I get to
[55:14] heaven if I get to heaven if I could
[55:16] just make it in
[55:19] and hear him say Well done
[55:23] that's it for me
[55:25] I don't need to be over any cities I
[55:27] don't I don't need anything else
[55:30] I just don't want to displease the Lord
[55:34] amen and here's the thing he's given us
[55:37] all these trials and all the things that
[55:39] we go through
[55:41] to prove where we're standing with God
[55:44] so we can know
[55:48] first of all God doesn't want us to be
[55:50] tossed about with every little problem
[55:53] that happens
[55:55] get bent out of shape because this
[55:58] happened that happened this brother did
[56:00] this sister did that
[56:07] God doesn't want that we need to mature
[56:11] that's not how we react
[56:17] Brother John
[56:18] who are you speaking to
[56:21] I'm speaking to anybody that wants to
[56:22] act like that
[56:24] and if if you don't act like that then
[56:27] praise God I'm not speaking to you these
[56:30] are the Holy Ghost
[56:35] when there's problems God wants to use
[56:37] us
[56:39] now we've got to step into the situation
[56:43] not tossed about but with our head on
[56:45] straight
[56:46] A sound mind God has not given us a
[56:49] spirit of fear but Power love and a
[56:51] sound mind I'm gonna walk into this
[56:52] situation and I'm going to help it
[56:58] and if you don't know what to do that
[56:59] second go pray
[57:02] but don't get in the habit of just not
[57:05] caring and caring and caring and not
[57:07] dealing with it
[57:09] because your whole Walk In Christ will
[57:11] become that way
[57:15] God's remedy for growing up is to
[57:18] literally speak truth and love
[57:21] that's how you grow up
[57:23] speak truth in love
[57:25] can you uh imagine we got a little uh
[57:31] Emma here can you imagine
[57:36] grandpa just really spanking her to
[57:40] she's black and blue because she don't
[57:42] know how to drive a car yet
[57:48] be terrible
[57:52] God's not going to put anything on us
[57:54] that we can't bear I would never put
[57:56] that on her
[58:00] and if I asked her to do something that
[58:03] she could do maybe pick up a toy
[58:12] God is required me to speak the truth in
[58:16] love now if I had all my
[58:19] seven children here lined up and they
[58:22] had all my men at Work lined up and I
[58:25] asked them have you ever heard me yell
[58:29] at you did I ever ever yell at you in
[58:32] all your life
[58:35] foreign
[58:39] but if I ask them did I ever speak the
[58:41] truth to you oh they at all say yeah
[58:45] you can speak the truth in love you
[58:48] don't have to yell you don't have to get
[58:50] angry you don't have to get upset
[58:52] you don't have to say well you know that
[58:58] look
[58:59] if you don't care enough to help your
[59:02] brother and sister
[59:04] what good is it have in Christ in the
[59:06] church if he's not in action
[59:10] what good is it to have some big light
[59:12] if it's on a bushel there's no light
[59:15] shining
[59:16] what good is it to have this great salt
[59:18] shaker in your life but
[59:20] he can't have a great flavor for what's
[59:24] coming forth from you
[59:26] are you with me
[59:28] so we need to speak the truth
[59:31] in love
[59:33] too many people get stuck in just
[59:36] speaking the truth and Hate
[59:39] Romans 5 5 says and hope maketh not a
[59:44] shame because the love of God is shed
[59:46] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[59:48] which is given unto us
[59:51] so we have God inside of us to have them
[59:55] working mightily inside of us is to
[59:58] restore to work out problems to to help
[1:00:03] for me to go to a church
[1:00:05] for me to go into work and expect my men
[1:00:08] not to scrap a job
[1:00:10] to expect my men not to be moody not to
[1:00:13] be sick not to be in a bad mood not to
[1:00:17] care at times to ever have that
[1:00:21] mentality would be utterly wrong
[1:00:26] people are going to come in here and
[1:00:28] they're going to do the wrong thing
[1:00:34] that just gives you an opportunity to go
[1:00:36] help
[1:00:38] well brother John I don't want to help
[1:00:40] because it offended me
[1:00:42] well then my suggestion to you is get
[1:00:45] along with God but don't let the sun go
[1:00:48] down on your wrath anymore
[1:00:50] you've got to change that
[1:00:53] you've got to change that you've got to
[1:00:55] start getting serious
[1:00:58] this is not a place that you just come
[1:01:00] for only what you want
[1:01:02] this is a place you come to help your
[1:01:05] brothers and sisters
[1:01:07] and if you don't feel that love you
[1:01:09] don't feel that burden I'll say you need
[1:01:11] to get
[1:01:12] you need to get along with God
[1:01:14] because I don't care how you slice it
[1:01:16] you're part of a body
[1:01:20] and the body needs you
[1:01:23] and you need the body
[1:01:27] imagine you you got so mad at everybody
[1:01:30] at the church
[1:01:31] that you just cut them out
[1:01:35] you can't even have faith in their
[1:01:36] prayers praying for you
[1:01:38] because you cut them out right
[1:01:45] I know this is
[1:01:47] this is uh this is about helping us get
[1:01:50] mature
[1:01:53] and uh
[1:01:54] Maybe
[1:01:56] some of us haven't experienced anything
[1:01:58] like this
[1:01:59] oh praise the Lord
[1:02:01] but maybe
[1:02:03] some of us have
[1:02:05] and
[1:02:08] God wants us to bow to handle it
[1:02:10] the right way I know time is up but I
[1:02:13] want to just read First Corinthians
[1:02:15] Chapter 13 Verse 4.
[1:02:17] foreign
[1:02:19] now we're going to speak the truth in
[1:02:21] love right
[1:02:23] we're going to speak the truth and love
[1:02:24] I got um some some good news I'm not
[1:02:27] going to do all my notes
[1:02:30] so that's good news
[1:02:35] but okay if you're going to speak the
[1:02:36] truth in love how do I do that Brother
[1:02:38] John
[1:02:39] First Corinthians chapter 13 verse 4
[1:02:41] says charity suffereth long amen
[1:02:45] amen and it's kind
[1:02:48] charity Envy not
[1:02:50] vaunteth not itself and it's not puffed
[1:02:54] up
[1:02:55] you know
[1:02:56] the worst thing you could do is be
[1:02:58] puffed up talking to somebody
[1:03:01] it does not behave itself unseemingly
[1:03:05] and it doesn't even seek its own in
[1:03:07] other words when you speak the truth and
[1:03:10] love it's not about you
[1:03:12] it's not about you it's about the person
[1:03:14] you're talking to
[1:03:18] it's not easily provoked and it doesn't
[1:03:21] sit there thinking evil
[1:03:26] it rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices
[1:03:29] in the truth it Bears all things
[1:03:34] I love that amen no laziness in this
[1:03:38] thing
[1:03:38] it believes all things that hopes all
[1:03:41] things that endures all things
[1:03:43] and charity never quits
[1:03:47] it never fails
[1:03:49] praise the Lord
[1:03:52] so when there are problems
[1:03:55] the body needs to be fitly joined
[1:03:57] together
[1:03:58] not disconnected
[1:04:01] not disjointed at one part of the body
[1:04:04] not sowing Discord not in any essence or
[1:04:08] schisms or I can talk to you know
[1:04:10] certain people about this in the church
[1:04:12] but I can't
[1:04:14] look don't talk to anybody about
[1:04:17] anything except the person that God has
[1:04:20] put on your heart
[1:04:22] to go help
[1:04:26] the scripture teaches to do that
[1:04:29] Jesus taught to do that
[1:04:33] golden
[1:04:37] that don't work take another brother
[1:04:39] with you
[1:04:41] but more than more more than anything
[1:04:43] you know
[1:04:44] everybody in here is so willing
[1:04:48] to make things better we got a good
[1:04:50] church I'm so thankful
[1:04:53] I'm so thankful that the Holy Ghost runs
[1:04:56] the church
[1:04:57] and it's okay that I don't know what's
[1:04:59] going on
[1:05:01] as long as God does
[1:05:03] he can take care of it
[1:05:05] he can he can address what needs to be
[1:05:08] addressed
[1:05:09] we want God to supply every need of this
[1:05:13] body
[1:05:14] and we want him to work inside of us
[1:05:16] effectually work inside of us let's
[1:05:18] Stand Together mightily working inside
[1:05:21] of us I can do all things through Christ
[1:05:26] he's the one that strengthens me I can't
[1:05:28] do nothing of myself
[1:05:30] but I can do all things through Christ
[1:05:32] who strengthen me can I give you one
[1:05:35] more scripture
[1:05:36] while you're standing and this is like
[1:05:39] so powerful
[1:05:41] first John chapter 3 verse 8.
[1:05:47] he that commit the sin is of the devil
[1:05:50] for the devil said it from the beginning
[1:05:51] this is where I want to get to for this
[1:05:54] purpose the Son of God was manifested
[1:05:56] that he might destroy the works of the
[1:05:58] devil
[1:06:00] the manifestation of Christ in our
[1:06:03] church will destroy the works of the
[1:06:05] devil
[1:06:07] so a soft answer turns away raft it's
[1:06:10] the manifestation of Christ that
[1:06:12] destroys the devil
[1:06:16] remember when brother Branham he came
[1:06:17] home from a missionary trip one time and
[1:06:20] the whole house was out of Rey and kids
[1:06:22] were jumping around and the wife was all
[1:06:24] tore up and well what was needed was
[1:06:27] Christ in action
[1:06:28] he just put his little apron on he
[1:06:31] started helping his darling with the
[1:06:33] dishes
[1:06:36] just started humming before you knew it
[1:06:38] created a whole new atmosphere what was
[1:06:40] it it wasn't just God and a prophet it
[1:06:43] was the manifestation of Christ at that
[1:06:46] moment
[1:06:47] that's what's needed in a church
[1:06:50] it's Christ in action
[1:06:53] blessed are the peacemakers
[1:06:56] blessed are they that are merciful
[1:06:58] see it's the manifestation of Christ
[1:07:01] that's our hope
[1:07:02] amen Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:07:07] amen
[1:07:09] you got a song on your heart
[1:07:13] got a song you'd like to play
[1:07:17] all is well amen
[1:07:23] all is well
[1:07:29] all is well
[1:07:33] we have
[1:07:35] heard the message alone and all is well
[1:07:45] very
[1:07:47] there is a place of perfect rest
[1:07:52] behind the nervous
[1:07:58] soul rest little
[1:08:01] bride rest for all is well
[1:08:09] all is worth
[1:08:14] all all is well
[1:08:19] we have
