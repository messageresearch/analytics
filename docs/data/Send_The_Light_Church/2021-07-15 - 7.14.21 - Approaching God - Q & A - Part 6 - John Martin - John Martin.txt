[Music] jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible jesus is here amen he makes everything possible amen let's look to the lord in prayer father we thank you that we could come to a place that there is a a a building a little room that's been set aside that we could come and believe that your presence would be there because there's a little group of people that believe the entire word of god from cover to cover and that's what you told so many people to believe through the ages only believe you wanted eve to only believe you wanted adam to only believe lord you want us to only believe we pray that lord that we not question your word and that through the faith in your word lord that um that all things would be possible in our grips lord that we could have the things that we have need of lords we come before you today i pray that lord as we've we sound these songs these choruses our hearts are prepared a sanctuary lord may your word come and be revealed to us that when we would leave here that we would be more like you more in your image drawn closer to you better equipped to meet and face the enemy lord lord we all have needs we're all going through trials wrong desiring leadership for our lives i pray lord that somehow through the power of the supernatural spirit that you would come and meet the knees that be amongst us we commit the service with every one of these needs into your hands now we trust you for them for we ask it all in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you turn with me if you would to the book of jeremiah we've got two scripture readings one is in jeremiah chapter 29 and one is in james chapter 5. as you're turning there we want to take another service on questions and answers and this is going to be our part six and we want to talk about approaching god approaching god and i want to combine actually two questions that were given i'd like to read these now before we read the scriptures and the two questions are one is what is the best way to approach the lord in prayer that's the first question i want to combine it with this question how to combat thoughts when trying to seek god when speaking the word to satan i like to approach uh combine these two and try to try to get them both if we could starting here with jeremiah chapter 29 verse number 12 then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart amen and then jared and then james chapter 5 just one verse there verse number 16 confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much god bless you may be seated approaching god is not easy and all you got to do is look at the last time you prayed and you didn't feel like praying didn't feel like much was getting accomplished and that pretty much sums up that approaching god is not real easy satan isn't going to just lay down and let you communicate with god and allow the the presence of god just to come in your your area every gun from hell is pointed against you when you set out to pray every force of evil is going to press against you and make it hard i just want you to kind of uh flow with me if you would as we go through some of these experiences that we've had satan has many tools that he uses when we approach god in prayer and he'll try many different lures now lure is a distraction when you set out to go fishing the lure attracts the fish fish is that right and brother branham said that healing was actually the bait right did it attract the person to christ healing does well well satan has lures too and he's trying to lure us away from approaching god from praying and he'll he'll use work you ever get down your knees and all of a sudden you're thinking about work how about the honeydew list one of our many responsibilities a project or a goal that we have or you had a rough day and it's time to relax unwind and and and hey even be entertained and these are all lures to keep us from approaching god in prayer and if you can overcome all those then the devil may use another bait like i'll pray as i'm driving there or i'll pray when i'm doing this or doing that and i believe we should always be praying no matter what but you know we need to to have designated time for prayer as well or he'll say it doesn't seem to make a difference when i pray anyways things really don't change for me and all those things keep us from approaching god amen well i'll just ask somebody else to pray for me i know they'll pray if i ask them that's a good one to keep you from approaching god satan pat you on the back and says you got this handled you don't even need to pray about it how about that one that's a good one oh i'll wait and i'll just pray when i get to church i'll pray later but that don't happen either how about god knows my heart i talk to him all the time there ought to be to me more people saying amen to all this stuff i don't just because you have this pure desire to pray doesn't mean the devil is going to roll over and let it happen without a fight the third this is i just want to catch your attention this the third from the last thing the devil wants is for you to approach god i know you've never heard that statement before the third from the last thing we're going to talk about the third and the second and god willing monday we'll talk about the first in the message jesus christ is saying yesterday and today and forever brother branham says when you fall to your knees in prayer even the devil's tremble to the weakest of them amen he said think of it when you fall to your knees in prayer well the devil doesn't want you approaching god that's why he works we don't think we think it's just all this other stuff that's going on out here that's really not it what it is is the devil's working on all this external stuff and then he begins to work in the mine because he don't want you in contact with god he isn't scared of us right no sir not at all he's scared of the one who we're approaching so all the guns are pointed at us to keep us from even starting in prayer so always bear in mind when you set out to approach god in prayer you're entering a war zone you're going to encounter spiritual warfare amen you don't just pray when you feel like it right you don't just pray when you need to pray but you pray always it's it's it's it's a part of a christian's life amen is true so when you settle to pray prepare yourself for battle you must be violent take possession of your time by force don't allow all these excuses to get in your way be violent take take possession of your time you must not let things stand in your way you're going to make up your mind you've got to be determined press into the kingdom even though it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom it won't be handed over to you you've got to press into it amen so don't let things distract you and keep you away from approaching god in prayer now once you're determined and you have started your approach i say fasten your seat belts the ride is going to get turbulent i stated the third from the last thing the devil doesn't want you doing is approaching god the second from the last thing is he doesn't want you to continue to approach god so you enter into the spirit he'd rather have you just you know being carnal in your prayers he don't want you praying but god forbid that you would enter into the spirit of god he'd really be in trouble then see this is where the battle picks up this is where it rages this is when we begin to recognize the spiritual warfare that's going on in our minds the imaginations and the reasonings take a front seat in our thoughts like god isn't going to listen to me anyways god isn't going to answer my prayers it doesn't matter anyways what's the use now these are real thoughts that happen when you finally get down and you get down your knees and you say i'm gonna pray the devil ain't gonna lay back this is the stuff he starts throwing at you he'll throw at you well you don't feel his presence he must not be here i feel the same way as when i don't pray so what's the use my my prayers don't seem to be very effectual they're not getting anything accomplished our minds often can drift off into some unintentional location you ever had that happen it's like what am i doing over there i thought i made a decision because that isn't that's satan he doesn't want you to press in but you can't get it in the spirit unless you press in amen his spirit ain't going to come just because you're a believer in the message we end up thinking unintentional thoughts you ever start thinking negative about somebody read in prayer write in prayer sometimes we can just drift off in some place that we end up saying lord i'm sorry for thinking those thoughts and here we are getting ready to sit down or kneel down and and pray because a weak mind a mind that is not focused a mind that is so uh open to anything it's just an easy easy attack for the devil the spiritual warfare goes from outside things that i got to do to inside to real just to me hideous thoughts that god doesn't hear me it doesn't make a difference because these last ditch efforts to try to keep us from pressing in currently it's easy to just oh yeah i got to do that oh yeah take care of those things i'll just pray when i'm working on it i went over to the church the other day before i started working i said i'm going to pray first just pray first sure you can pray while you work but spend some time with the lord press it satan will throw thoughts at you to combat every thing that you try to do to pray and we have to learn to cast them down amen that's all there is to it whoever wrote this question i just want to say it like this satan is allowed to come to you and battle you it's up to you to cast the thoughts down amen imaginations the distractions of the mind the reasonings to not lead your own understanding you ever do that in prayer lean to your own understanding don't lean to your own understanding it's time to engage in the heat of the battle and put your faith and trust in god and not lean to your own understanding trust the lord because if you're ever going to enter into the spirit when you pray you're going to have to press it just don't happen when you get down to pray you're not automatically in the spirit i say start praying like your prayers are what's going to get the job done pray like your prayers is really what it's going to take to get the job done pray like things are going to fall apart without your prayers pray like your prayers are what's keeping things going as good as they are going pray like you're a child of the king amen don't forget who you are don't let the devil try to feed you a bunch of garbage because that's what he's doing don't let him try to steal your identity if thou be a son of god then why did this happen to you if that'll be a son of god why why'd you get so upset why'd you fly off the handle why do you keep missing church why did you stop going to church if thou be a son if thou be a daughter prayer works prayer works sure it don't feel like it does but it works if we really knew how our prayers were effective in the spiritual realm if we could really see that we just got to believe prayer is a vital part of a christian walk jesus said men ought to always pray and not to faith always pray prayer sustains the believer it gives him spiritual strength you stop praying and you get weak isaiah chapter 40 verse 30. now i'll say this i don't know how you're feeling today i don't really care how you're feeling today i am speaking to the believers to sons and daughters of god amen that believe you say amen to the word amen not to your feelings don't lower yourself to say amen to how you feel amen stay with the word isaiah chapter 40 verse 30 even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall so it doesn't matter how old you are this thing that happens it happens to the young amen verse 31 but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength you're spending on time in prayer waiting for the spirit to come come on now he's here he's everywhere but that doesn't mean i'm connected to him doesn't mean i'm in the spirit so you got to wait upon him you wait there long enough you start getting stronger you start to feel his presence now let's look at verse 29 he giveth power to the faint to them that have no might he increaseth strength so it doesn't matter today where you feel you're at with god and how low you are you can have no strength no power but god promised to give it to you all you have to do is follow the word wait on the lord amen i don't care if you don't feel like it make a decision be determined the rest of verse 31 they shall mow up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall not and they shall not faint they shall walk and not faint amen what a promise now sometimes you know when we're going through tests and trials we don't even feel like doing anything we ain't got strength to do anything right we just can't wait for this thing to be over but here's a promise that we can go through our trials with strength yes amen we can we can be egos because we are an ego so let's act like it amen i don't feel like it so did jesus ever say does thou feel right never said it men ought always to pray and not faint so prayer puts us in a category of being strong in the lord amen but laodicea makes it hard for all of us to pray lazy believers who focus is on well jesus paid it all jesus takes care of everything jesus is in charge it's as if they don't know their position with god they don't understand where prayer comes in god moves according to our confession according to what we confess what we profess how we pray if thou canst believe all things are possible but if you just like nothing matters anymore that's laodicea nothing matters lazy believers we're not lazy jesus said take heed to yourself that there's a snare coming upon the face of the earth the whole earth there's a a snare coming well if this ain't the beginning of it i hate to see when it does come luke chapter 21 verse 36 watch ye therefore and what did jesus say pray always that ye may be accounted things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man now any moment that you say i can't pray it's too hard to pray i'm struggling to pray as soon as you say that as soon as you confess that did you know it's going to be that much easier not to pray the next time that's right as soon as you give the devil an inch he's going to be ready to get two and then three and then before and then before you know it you can hardly pray about anything amen don't let it be an excuse pray always regardless regardless now i'd rather see you pray not even be in the spirit and pray then not pray at all but don't be satisfied with just praying in the flesh get on to the second thing get in contact with god pray in the spirit there's a difference there's a difference one you're praying from your heart you just can't hardly stop it because it's god inside praying the other is just thoughts and yes when we approach god in prayer we're setting out to unite with god by praying in the spirit see when you get in the spirit you're actually uniting with god amen when you're praying in the flesh you're not united with him your flesh is enmity with him no matter if you're saying the right words you've got to get in the spirit and i know if we're not used to this we need to practice it that's why we need to pray more amen we want to become a spiritual church we need to pray in the spirit it's not getting head knowledge it's getting knee knowledge all day today i was walking around with my knee pads everywhere i went to the store my knees pads around and with the guys in my knee pad i went back to work my knee pads run if you don't have those knee pads when you're working your knees go to especially somebody at my age your knees your knees brother marty knows about the knees i think one thing that we should do is have brother branham talk about having holes in her knees and her pants because we spend a lot of time on our knees say our hearts need to be showing our spirit needs to be showing that we spend a lot of time in prayer our spirits need to be showing that that we're a humble heart so he's not scared of us the devil's not scared of us he's scared of the one we're uniting with greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world see the devil is afraid of the devil i mean the devil is afraid of god that's inside you you know if i if i never said anything right i know you'd get the message i know you still get it and when we get in the spirit i just want to say there's much greater results of the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man it avails much prayer is such a vital part to a christian but praying in the spirit i'll say it like this is essential if we expect to be the bride of christ we've got to get in the spirit god is the spirit they that worship god must worship him in spirit we must pray in the same vein where god is at amen romans chapter 8 verse 36 romans 8 verse 26 likewise the spirit also helped with our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought that is so contrary to carnal thinking amen carl thinking says i know how to pray i know what i need to pray i know exactly i know how this that's carnality that's like taking away the mind of god but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god but we're going to think we know the will of god when we're praying for somebody i'll tell you you know there's a good chance that you're in the spirit when you're actually praying for somebody because the scripture just told us that the spirit maketh intercession for the saints that goes along with the nature of christ living for others caring for others thinking about others i'll tell you i'll just be this is just my personal testimony i'm struggling you start praying for somebody and all of a sudden you'll feel the presence of god but you're stuck praying about yourself something you got going on some needs you got i'm telling you sometimes it's hard but you begin to pray with others it seems like you touch the heart of god all suddenly he just comes and he shows he's pleased with your prayer and it's according to this scripture right here he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god if we pray continue if we continue to pray in our flesh we'll never break through to the spirit so we got to recognize it's good that we're praying it's good that we're here it's good that we took time from our busy day it's good that we're uh trying to battle all these thoughts in our head and continue to pray putting in our time but don't stop there don't stop until you get into the spirit ephesians chapter 6 verse 18 praying always with all prayer and supplications in the spirit well brother john you do you just you never taught us how to do that i am not the teacher of that i am the teacher that tells you pray until the spirit comes god will come and when he comes you will automatically know the difference when he's not there watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication here it is again for all saints god is interested in all of us yes god is interested in what we're all going through billy graham told the true meaning of prayer when he said prayer is a simple two-way conversation between you and god but praying in the flesh is just us talking one way it is not the body's posture but the heart's attitude that counts when we pray prayer is not using is not our using of god i love this prayer is not our using of god it is more often puts us in a position where god can use us yes he's the powder we're the clay amen prayer can be a tough battle when we're praying with a carnal mind romans 8 verse 7 says because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can it be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god so when you're you know you're in the flesh and you're praying and that's all that you're going to do is stay in the flesh i'm telling you your prayer is not even making god happy but if you stay there in your carnal mind and you say i am not happy with the thoughts that i'm thinking the things that are going through my half-hearted prayers just trying to put in my time i am determined to get beyond this that's when you will bring happiness to god when you will please god when you break through that thing it's not the action of how hard it is to pray but it's the reaction that counts what are you going to do with that the goal of every prayer warrior ought to be to labor until he enters into the spirit because that's what makes your prayers effective is when the spirit is making intercession through you amen whatever you say well i don't want honestly i don't want to pray without god praying through me because i don't know how to pray brother john how long have you been serving the lord long enough to read this bible that tells me i don't know how to pray and i am just dumb enough to believe it stay with the word amen god wants to pray through us we should want it as much praying through just doesn't happen after 15 minutes everybody's got their routine of prayer right i've got my routine and when you're done doing your routine sometimes you feel like it was just a routine and you should break the routine and pray until he comes and then sometimes you pray and you feel his presence we're grateful for that but it just doesn't happen automatically sometimes we're battling these thoughts how to combat these thoughts that are happening you have to combat them amen you have to press through them you have to say i'm not settling for this i'm not listening to this i'm believing for a personal contact with my savior when we approach god we need to get into the spirit we need to be determined to press through all those carnal thoughts they're not going away on their own we've got to cast him down as we said second corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 all these these thoughts that we get when we're praying they're just strongholds they're trying to keep us from entering in to the spirit and just you know what it's like just to be in prayer and you're worshiping you're crying and you're just so in love with him you just do anything you want you to do come on when you get in the spirit you tell me are you really battling those thoughts of you know you're not really isn't going to matter his presence is so strong you would never entertain those thoughts it's it those thoughts bother you when you haven't entered into that place and that they're there for it [Music] there's something else that happens after you get into the presence of the lord though see satan he don't quit he don't quit we're in a battle that's right we're in the battle second corinthians 10 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare they're not carnal but they're very very mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds so when you say how many times have you been in prayer and these thoughts just keep coming you're oh i wish i wouldn't think i just got oh and you're trying to not think them and then you you try and then you go right back to them has that ever happened to you am i just preaching to myself okay well you need something stronger than you just well you know i don't i guess you gotta try a little bit harder stand up and say in the name of jesus christ get behind me satan verbally say it get serious with it because god will honor your stand casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god what is the knowledge of god pray in the spirit that's the knowledge of god right now we have that knowledge and if anything tells you well you don't got to do that just you know god hears your prayers no matter what you do that's a high thing that's a high thing that's exalting itself against the knowledge of god we need to take serious the importance of praying in the spirit amen and bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ that is literally the responsibility for every believer to harness your own thoughts and having in a readiness to revenge all the disobedience that we've done when your obedience is fulfilled is that beautiful it's hard praying until you break through the flesh into the spiritual realm it is hard it's a battle there's a lot of turbulence that we may encounter just like chuck yeager some of you know chuck yeager he was a u.s air force captain who was the first person to fly faster than the speed of thumb mr yeager he actually died last year he was the first one to experience breaking the sound barrier in 1947 despite having just suffered several crap cracked ribs during a fall from his horse jaeger was remarkable had great courage and was determined to push through new limits and during the test flight he ignored listen to this the terrifying turbulence that was all around him and shattered forever the myth of an impenetrable sound barrier and that's the way you need to look at it when you want to enter into the spirit there's a lot of turbulence getting there but once you enter in there is peace sublime it's calm it's a beautiful atmosphere and it was worth pressing in i want us to type the breaking through the sound bearers breaking through our carnal mind our carnal thoughts and entering into the spiritual realm of prayer we need to ignore the terrifying turbulence in our minds when we're praying just ignore it don't give to it ignore it and with courage press in to new to to to tune limits to a place where maybe it's been a while since you prayed in the spirit maybe you've been listening to the enemy saying well as long as you pray that's all that matters man don't listen to that thing before you know it he'll get you in a bad habit this is a bad habit i want us to have a testimony i pray through i pray for you because when you pray through you'll get the victory you'll get joy unspeakable full of glory you'll feel you're on cloud nine it won't be hard to give up your life give up your will but you pray in the flesh you still hold on to your will here's some quotes of chuck yeager he said i noticed that the faster i got the smoother the ride suddenly that mock needle began to fluctuate it went up to 0.965 mock well probably need brother bruce or brother uh marty to tell us what all that means mark wants to speed us up see there you go i told you i told you you don't even got to study that's something about you just you got it you know it he said then tipped right off the scale he says we were flying supersonic it was as smooth as a baby's bottom that's what he said he said grandma could be sitting up there sipping lemonade that's what happens when you break through to the spirit there's no more turbulence you're flying faster you're an eagle you're flying above the things of the world these little things down here aren't bothering you anymore that used to bother these little things these little things people did people said little thoughts that we're having you get up there nothing matters because you're in the mind of christ now that spirit will just make intercession whatever god will put on your heart what to pray at that time god is in control he said you don't concentrate on the risk what if i don't pray through i'll just get let down again he said you don't concentrate on the risk you concentrate on the results so you keep your vision on praying through to that other realm who cares about the battle all the noises everything that's going on he said what good does it do to be afraid he says it doesn't help anything right don't be afraid don't be afraid well what if i don't pray through don't be afraid don't be afraid of that think about yesterday when you didn't even try as hard you're going to get that much closer david had to pray 21 days to get an answer yeah you know we're not going to make it on the floor we've got ease one thing that i admire about uh what they teach in the armed forces is disciplined they teach you duty and they teach you responsibility it has nothing to do about how you feel they don't come out and say how do you feel today unless they got something sarcastic to say afterwards but chuck yeager said the one word you use in the military flying is duty it's your duty you have no control over the outcome no control over pick and choose is duty so i'll say it like this men ought always to pray and not faint it's a duty look at it as a duty amen don't look at it as labor to see it you got a choice because the devil will talk you out of it amen unchanging certain fact he said the best the most skillful pilot has the most experience in other words the more you pray the more experience you'll have at battling the devil and entering into the spirit amen brother branham says when he got down and he heard uh annie pray you know what i'm talking about uh aunt jemima i think he might have called her he says when she got down to pray he said one thing was for sure he knew that she had talked to her before and i'll tell you when the more you pray in the spirit the better you get at praying in the spirit because you have to deny the flesh you have to give up will you have to you have to seek god with everything you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart god wants to see more of you amen maybe not the i i was talking to david bailey oh i mentioned his name that's okay it doesn't matter he got back from a two-week vacation i asked and it was not really a true vacation it was a vacation where he had baseball tournaments and he took he's in charge of a key team and he took them all down there and um he was telling me about uh some of the parents you know came to him and were complaining to him because their kid didn't get to play very much and of course you know you you you do your best and and he told him you know ahead of time you know everybody's not going to get that play this is not low league we don't do a little league where everybody just get the plays equal these are big kids this travel team and um so some of them uh got to sit out but there were certain kids who did not have much talent oh but they played with a big heart they played with so much heart he actually played them more right why because they put more of their heart into the game i think god will use this more when we put our heart into the game he said when you search for me with all your heart he's looking to play those people not how much talent we got not our our position or what we think but heart he said the best pilots fly more than others that's why they're the best i say we need to put on the whole armor of god when we're getting ready to approach god put on the whole armor of god pray always with all supplication for all the saints amen satan doesn't want us to pray he trembles when the weakest of us begin to pray amen and if we do pray he certainly doesn't want us to enter into the spirit that's going to even make it harder so i like to keep in mind a fixed goal when i pray i notice a long time ago if i just pray quietly when i'm not in the spirit when i'm in the carnal flesh my mind has a tendency of drifting yeah before you know it i'm thinking so many things that you must just not even be praying about just sit and think about those things so as a a small discipline i forced myself to pray a little bit loud so i can hear now what that does it forces me and holds my me too accountable to the words i'm saying i'm actually having to think about him now now eventually you'll begin to pray from the heart at that point you can pray quietly at that point if you want to but you need something to get you praying and getting you in contact with god amen although other than that it's just going to be a a quiet thing our minds can wander we got to be strong that's one way to help it help me first be determined to meet god in his presence when you approach him in prayer be determined be serious about it second always remember to approach god with more respect than you think yes with more respect than you think in other words give him more than what you think give him your heart the right way give them your spirit right give them a right attitude god don't need your arrogant spirit around his throne he doesn't need your great abilities and achievements being flashed before him lord i'm glad i'm not like this one and i don't and i do this and i he don't need that around his throne i thank thee lord i'm not like brother so-and-so in the church oh i paid my ties all last year i even gave more than i wanted to what does that mean if you're not given from your heart it ain't going to matter anyways god loves a cheerful giver amen he doesn't need well at least came to church lord yeah approach god with the greatest respect that you have amen smote your breast acknowledge that you're not worthy to even approach him now i know the bible says come boldly to the throne of god but it doesn't mean come any old way you want right what that means is god has provided a way through calvary for you to come that's what that means he rent the veil for you he made a way for you to approach but you still have to come before him with respect he demands respect amen now think about this here we are going through tests we're going through trials we're having a hard time pressing through it doesn't seem like we should even uh even try because it it doesn't make a difference we feel so down on the dumps and you know we just don't even feel like trying but yet we need to respect him when we come that's a tall order god's asking why isn't he just looking down at me in my pitiful condition and just take me as he is because god deserves more respect than that you want help for your condition stay there till he comes wait on the lord he is faithful he's a rewarder to them that diligently seek him but we need to respect him we live in an age where people's character is lacking respect while hate and disrespect are escalating in the world the love of many are waxing cold right in the church people are in so in love with themselves that they don't have time to respect others the problem with thinking you can respect god without respecting other humans is insane it's insane and it's impossible god is no respecter persons we saw that with judas he chose judas three and a half years just let him be a part of whatever he wanted to be a part of we are told to honor all men especially of the household of faith that's why when we approach god in prayer and we remember some have ought against us or we have ought against another human being we're supposed to not even offer our gift to god but to leave it there and first go and make things right with other humans before we approach god with our gifts is that true so god is really wanting us to be respectful amen and jesus says if we don't forgive those who trespass against us then our heavenly father's not going to forgive us so we must approach god with respect if we're not willing to get serious and take care of those things then we're not serious enough for god how is god going to rain down his spirit on you no he's he may do it he you know he he his rain falls on the just and the unjust but i wouldn't want that to be my testimony amen god never looks at us as having uh disrespect towards him he looks at us as having disrespect towards others and that's disrespecting him god looks at us as having the character of respect or he looks at us as not having the character of respect it's not something you put on some people may have this mentality of pushing the pause or play button with respect well i'm going to respect no i'm not going to respect here i'm going to respect now but not over here but that's not what god expects from us and demands from us he wants us to respect all the time he wants us to be a respectful person to one another how we think about people what we say behind closed doors because how you are is really how you are when you come to god you just don't think it don't hit the pause play buttons just live a life of respect people are listening to what you say about others i don't care if it's true if it's true let me just say this if it is true you are duty-bound to go wash their feet what god didn't tell me but god told you to talk about him that's how messed up your mind is thinking you've got the leadership of god amen it's not even the nature of god try the spirit all right learn to live peaceably the bible says with all men all amen i love this romans 16 verse 20 and the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly notice not the god of vengeance right the god of peace our god is a good god amen the bible says that we're to shout our feet with the preparation of the gospel peace jesus said in mark 9 verse 50 have sought to your in yourselves and have peace one with another amen now the god of peace be with you all i'll just say it like this you respect god when you respect one another amen and it's important when you're approaching god all your relationships that you've had out here with people you think it don't mean anything but it means everything yes amen approach god with the utmost respect and genuine humility humility is the best approach now humility is not the way you approach but a condition of your heart when you approach there's a difference condition of your heart is something that is before during after right approach could be oh yeah i got a yield right now a little bit and then after i'm done i can do what i want to do right but humility is who you are it's who you are he giveth more grace to the humble amen not to somebody that approaches him humbly and then just acts any way they want to afterwards god gives more grace to the person whose character is actually just like him that's what he's saying there he gives more grace to the character that's just like him learning me he's lowly in heart he's humble we should be too a humble and broken spirit he would not despise now we're talking about our approach to god it means everything where our motors are at when we get down on our knees god hates a proud look brother mark that was already in my notes when he said that today amen sowing discord among the brethren is another one that was brother mark talked about in fact he made me read that one he didn't even know he made me read that but sowing discord among uh the people is also something god hates humility will seat god with all its heart but a proud heart will only give up so much will only seek god so long to go so far and then for whatever reason it stops then ye shall call upon me and you shall go and pray and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart let's take a look at the centurion's approach he was very humble and very respectful he said lord i am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof i am not worthy that your presence should come here when i'm praying but he is also full of faith yes he was humble yet full faith don't get it mixed up with arrogancy and thinking that well i'm just coming boldly he said but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed lord just let your presence come and pray through me for all your people because that's the will of god that's the written word of god well i don't want to do that i just don't have a burden for that that's just not where i'm at well get where you need to get to right amen that's all i can say stay with the word get back to the word mark chapter or matthew chapter 8 verse 10 and when jesus heard it when he heard this man and his attitude speaking to him he marveled and said to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great of faith no not in israel amen so if he came today and he checked all of us out i'm sure he's looking for faith amen when you're when you when you get into this spirit you've got faith because he's there it's just getting there there's a bunch of doubts rolling in your head right amen and you got to press through that matthew chapter 15 verse 22. i'll try to get through a few of these this here phoenician woman's approach and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coast and cried unto him saying look at this look at the approach have mercy on me that's right oh lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil but have mercy on me even praying for someone have mercy on me because my burden is for amen but he answered her not a word you ever feel like that when you're praying we got some scripture here and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us so there were some other voices that were kind of getting on the bandwagon of ignoring this need you ever get a lot of voices coming into your head say well it doesn't matter your mother just stop praying ain't going to make your mouth so just go away he's doing too many important things to to help you but he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel i am not sent to help you with your problem i am too busy helping the bride of jesus christ sounds like some things that we've heard is it but i love her attitude she came then came she and what did she do she worshipped she's saying lord help me she was determined when she got on her knees to pray she didn't let some little mind battle just keep her from entering in and receiving what she got on her knees for but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and just you know cast it to you and your your little situation and she said truth lord that's the answer that's the answer the lord is never wrong whatever he says we may not understand but he's never wrong truth lord yet the dogs they eat the crumbs were troubling the master's table i mean was she quick-wetted or what i think her attitude was a humble attitude that had nothing but more and more respect to the lord then jesus answered and sent to her oh woman you got my attention great is thy faith be it unto thee even is thou will and her daughter was made whole from that very hour amen your devil is is not going to just roll over because you get down on your knees or you have a thought i'm going to pray and i'm going to press in i'm saying you got every demon coming at you you're going to try to stop it but prayer is very vital for us be determined when you pray keep your respect for god no matter what he does no matter what he says no matter how you feel keep your respect for god blind better turn with me if you would to mark chapter 10. what an approach he had when jesus got to a place where there was a blind man there was a physical need basically blind bartimaeus began to cry out saying jesus thou son of david look the same words have mercy on me now the reason i'm i want to bring this is a lot of times when we approach god do we really come with the heart of lord have mercy on me or do we feel like we're a little bit beyond that it's really good don't get beyond that don't always plead for the mercies of god in verse 48 mark chapter 10 verse 48 many charged him that he should hold his peace here he goes more voices but what did he do he started praying out loud a little bit more and he cried the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me i don't care all this is praying i'm gonna i'm gonna just get a holy god i don't care what's happening i don't care what my thoughts are i don't care how i'm feeling all the more i'm gonna cry out and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called but if you just quit you're not seeking them with all your heart and they called the blind man saying unto him be of good cheer arise he calleth thee and he casting away his garment rolls and came to jesus and jesus answered and said unto him what will thou that i should do unto thee the blind man said unto him lord that i might receive my sight there's a healing a physical need in his body and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith may thee whole we need faith when we approach god don't leave that out don't just bring your need without faith [Music] because without faith it's impossible to please him even though the need is great and he has compassion on you you must bring faith that he will take care of that need that's i think a lot of times where we fail when we don't bring faith we're not really respecting god all right luke chapter 8 verse 40. let's take a look at the woman with the blood issue her approach and it came to pass that when jesus was returned the people gladly received him for they were all waiting for him and behold there came a man named jarius and he was a ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at jesus's feet and he besought him that he would come into his house for he had one only daughter about 12 years of age and she lay a dying but as he went the people thronged him so there's a lot of noise happening right now a lot of noise happening you have a loud noise happening when you're praying like i just wish all these thoughts would just stop right and a woman having an issue of blood again 12 years which had spent all of her living upon the physicians neither could be healed of any so you know she's coming with all her heart he came behind him and touched just the border of his garment and immediately her issue of blood was stenched and jesus being a man said who touched me who touched me when all denied peter and they that were with him said master there's a multitude of people here they're pressing me they're throwing thee and you're saying who touched me notice this had everything to do with the woman it wasn't the 12 disciples the church they all got together here's what we're going to do we're going to pray over this one person there's ways that you can approach god in your home come on now there's a way to approach god in your home when there's a lot of stuff going on and you can still touch the hem of god's garment amen amen you just need the same thing she needed she had what did she have she had something with that touch it was a faith that's why we want to get in the spirit that'll touch the handle of his garment press into that spirit get beyond those voices and all that thing that's trying to throng and and interfere with you and distract you and lure you away from just giving up press through that thing amen amen jesus said somebody had touched me for i perceive that strength has gone out of me god has strength for us he said he would renew our strength if we wait upon him praise the lord and when the woman saw that she was not hit she came trembling falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort thy faith have made thee whole go in peace in peace i say be determined when you pray be respectful be full of faith amen think about this this woman it was between her and god nobody else needs to know about it amen i do believe in laying on hands and praying and coming up to the altar and two or three again agreeing and touching i believe in all that one all that but i also want us to believe in god that we us and him are the majority that's all that's needed brother how many times do we hear brother branham say you can have whatever you ask for right there right where you're standing but you can't be in a carnal mindset and receive from him you can't come to church and expect to get some revelation receive from the lord carnally god is a spirit i believe his bride is a spiritual being and we're trying to conform to what god is calling us to now say if we could just put into practice these things that we heard tonight because one thing that we all do every day is pray this should be real easy to practice because we do it right well brother john i'm already would you spend some more time praying for me because there's a lot of demons out after me pray for one another have a get a burden you know i'll say this if you don't have a burden how many is grateful for the one that cooks in your home can you imagine going to the table all the time and never being thankful right if god is behind the pulpit then we are duty bound to be thankful now if it's just a man i understand but is god speaking or is it a man speaking you understand you respect god by respecting one another you're respecting the god inside of one another i believe if we begin to exercise a greater respect a greater humility towards one another i think our prayers with god will be more effective and if i'm wrong come and bring me scripture bring me quotes and show me but you know it's the gospel and the devil would just assume us try to be divided come on and be okay with it but there's something about unity that god loves and that's why he wants us to pray for all saints to pray one for another and don't leave out the person that you hate the most i'm okay with waiting till you get into the spirit before you start praying for that one but that's that's they say your character is who you are when nobody's looking could our respect be really our respect really be who we are the most disrespectful to come on because that's what we need to grow and we need to have total respect are you with me let's stand together oh we've got a quote here i want to read brother branham said jesus christ the same yesterday day and forever well the scripture i believe some place says that the devils tremble when the weakest saints go to their knees and he says now what a power and a privilege has been given to the church of the living god when you fall on your knees in prayer even the devils tremble to the weakest of them so if you are feeling like you ain't nothing's really going on when you're praying like just know you're shaking hell and i'll tell you i i i like how uh is it brother alex he he he says uh he he lets the devil know he's going to give him trouble and that's that's the determination you need to have i don't i don't care what god says i don't care how long i gotta wait i don't care if i'm a dog i don't nothing matters i i'm i'm identified with christ and if i stay here long enough my faith is going to touch the hem of his garment it's going to bring the results amen can we can we say my faith looks up to thee amen so i hope that helps answer the question about combating thoughts we can't get rid of them but we can press through them amen amen my faith looks up to thee thou lamb of calvary save your device now hear me while i pray take all my guilt away oh let me from this day be holy may thy rich grace impart strength to my fainting heart my zeal inspired [Music] as thou has died for me o pay my love to thee pure warm and changes be a living wow life's dark maze i tread and grieves around me spread be down my god in darkness turn to day wide sorrows tears away nor let me ever stray from thee transit dream when dad's cold solid stream [Music] [Applause] [Music] save your then in love fear and distrust remove oh bear me safe above a ran some soul amen let's go to the lord in prayer is there anyone here says brother john would you pray for me i want this what was spoken tonight amen god has spoken to our hearts and let's just believe that he spoke it to us for we to take possession of it amen amen heavenly father we come to you lord is grateful children today so full of thanksgiving lord that you didn't write us off that you didn't give up on us but lord you you're going to see us through you encouraged us in your word when you told us to be confident of this very thing he that which had begun a good work amen is good at performing until the day of jesus christ lord we've come short many times in our prayer and yielding to our carnal thoughts even sometimes just ignoring when you've called us to pray but lord tonight you've reminded us you stirred up our our our thoughts and and and and and helped us to see how vital it is to pray to keep praying so we don't lose strength and and that our our very precious brothers or sisters are depending upon our prayers lord we ask that you would help us to break through all the barriers of carnality and all the thoughts that the enemy lord would place in our way and help us to press into the spirit until you come and just use these vessels to pray through us lord you know exactly what we need to pray for when we're praying for others lord bless your people now bless your your your eagles here lord let them soar let them be strengthened let them put into to practice lord these things even starting as soon as tonight when they're driving home or when they're going to bed when they wake up tomorrow may they be determined to take to steal away time with you and to get uh more desperate concerning the need of just being in contact with you and being in the spirit lord i know that you'll take care of the rest oh we need you in this this late hour that we're living in lord we commit ourselves to you and give you thanksgiving now in jesus wonderful name we pray amen and amen can you say amen amen i'm i'm determined i'm going through amen
