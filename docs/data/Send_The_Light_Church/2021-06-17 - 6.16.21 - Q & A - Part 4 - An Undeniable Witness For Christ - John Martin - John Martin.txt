flesh a black eye brother stan he's not here but he was telling me when he was a little boy at school teacher opened a door and the door handle happened to be the exact same height as his eye and it just gave him a black eye and i want to give the devil a black eye tonight amen amen god bless you it's good to be in in god's house with my precious brothers and sisters amen uh turn with me if you would to the book of acts chapter one i wonder if anybody has picked somebody up since sunday amen because we we've been asked to be a good samaritan and there's good news if you haven't you got the rest of the week and you got next week and you want to continue amen we want to speaking of continue we want to continue on uh with our questions and answers and uh originally i thought we were just going to get them and go over them in one service or two but um it just seems like there's real nuggets in here and just want to take you know take our our time um we're gonna read verse number 8 and get on with the question but let's look to the author just a moment in prayer our gracious heavenly father we thank you that you have placed within us your holy spirit to help us along this journey lord we're getting ready to approach your word and we're not fit to approach your word lord we're not worthy to approach a word we're unworthy or we don't know lord we don't have as it were a gift but we do all feel a call a call to help someone along the way help pick someone up and get them back on the right track and lord we just pray for your blessings on the service that you just take the the scriptures lord that will be read in thy precious holy bible and reveal them to our hearts that we might be a better witness for you lord jesus we commit the service now to you ask this grace in jesus christ's name amen amen verse number 8 of acts chapter 1 but ye shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and judea and samaria and under the uttermost parts of the earth god bless you you may be seated we want to entitle this an undeniable witness for christ and the question that came in some time ago when we did the questions read like this how to be an undeniable witness for christ that the world sees me no more and they would see christ only always that is it's a big question and god bless the brother or sister who wrote this question out i see the love and the sincerity in this question i believe it was brother around perhaps when he was praying tonight up here he said lord help us to be better witnesses and i think it to properly receive what god has for each of us we need to approach tonight as if we wrote the question like we're interested in being this undeniable witness for christ um i want to say that we in some areas of our life we probably are a greater witness than what we realize and there's probably areas in our life that we're less of a witness than what we realize and that's what the service is about is is to help us see clearly i'd like to start out by saying this any witnessing that isn't of the holy ghost will lack power to witness correctly and completely it's only through the power of the holy ghost that we can be effective in our witnessing now jesus told his disciples all the do's and don'ts about witnessing how to go out two by two and this is what you're doing dust the feet uh that take the dust off the your shoes if they reject you they had been trained by the author of witnessing himself and before he was taken up to heaven he leaves them with a great commission knowing that the heavens must retain jesus until the times of restitution the bible says and in matthew 28 verse 18 jesus came and he spake unto them all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth and with his power he commands his disciples to go ye out and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo and with you always even to the end of the world amen what a commission teach all people to observe all things it doesn't leave too much time for your own life yet before they could carry out this great commission jesus told them to wait for the power so he spent time teaching them for three and a half years he tells them what to do but he says don't do it until you get the power yes sir now they've received a power in matthew chapter 10 a power against unclean spirits to cast them out to heal all men are sickness and all matter diseases so they had a power but they didn't have all the power they need to be an undeniable witness for christ amen it was a greater power it takes a greater power to forgive than to judge to love than to hate to lay down your life than to actually cast out unclean spirits it was the power to properly witness amen to witness more than with your mouth but with your lives in luke chapter 24 verse 49 and there's going to be a lot of scripture so you know we're just going to have a bible old-fashioned bible study with a lot of scriptures and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with a power from on high power to witness with their lives a power to witness with their lives in other words a power to suffer long to be kind to be patient to bear all things to endure all things a power to love like god loves a power to lay down our life for one another amen and i believe the power this power today we should be tearing for it as well amen we need it just as much today and the way you get it is terry for it spend time calling on god wanting and desiring the power because those disciples they could have said hey look we already got power we already did all this we only know to cast out devils but it was something different but you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses the holy ghost is what does the witnessing in our bodies we don't do it the holy ghost does it in us the holy ghost has power to continue witnessing when we want to give up when we want to throw in the towel when we want to stop when it becomes just too hard for us it is the holy ghost that keeps going the holy ghost has power to lay our lives down we we can only do so much we can only go so long that the holy ghost in zionists has the ability to restore a soul to win a soul to disciple a soul we don't but the holy ghost has that power and if we want to be an undeniable witness for christ we need the undeniable power of christ proverbs 14 25 says a true witness delivereth souls but a deceitful witness speaketh lies we want to be an undeniable witness for christ that wins souls the bible says they that win souls is wise they'll shine as the stars amen jesus told us in matthew 24 14 and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness yes a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come so the great commission is still happening amen because the end hasn't happened yet this gospel of jesus christ must be preached in all the world as a witness now as we witness to the world it's only going to help a few very few the majority it's going to be a witness against them but you still have to witness to the world so i say that because i just don't want you to be discouraged when you lay down your life for somebody who just just steps on you it's it's just meant to be there's there's few that are going to actually stop and pick you up so as we ask the question how to be an undeniable witness for christ that the world sees me no more and they would see christ only always we must ask this question first to what extreme would you go to become an undeniable witness for christ what price are you willing to pay you must ask those questions first because we all want without giving and you can't get this without giving amen so we get a hunger for it more our hearts want to be an undeniable witness for christ but our flesh it doesn't want to pay the price it wants to suffer the least have no pain and still have that testimony an undeniable witness for christ but god requires more from us than just talking about jesus when ananias was doubting the leadership of god in his life concerning being a good samaritan for saul right remember he said jesus said in acts chapter 9 verse 15 go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles kings and the children of israel for i will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake pawna only suffered many things but he really presented his body a living sacrifice daily and even though he did that he still wanted to present his body at the end of his ministry an offering i mean he wanted to give everything his life his time his money his efforts and then he want to give his body you talk about an undeniable witness for christ so what are you willing to give to be an undeniable witness writing about this in a letter to timothy concerning the day that actually we're living in when believers wanted to hear preaching way they wanted to hear it right second timothy chapter four verse three read it with me second timothy chapter four verse three for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own desires they shall heap to themselves teachers having itching ears in other words they come to church and they want to hear what they want to hear instead of coming to church and saying lord what do you have that's what it means not to endure and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned onto fables so anytime you want to hear what you want to hear you're getting away from the truth because god has many things to say to you but you can't bear it now but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of evangelists make full proof of thy ministry so paul is showing us here the difference between these two groups these two ministries one is a fool proof it's foolproof it endures inflictions it it works evangelism it's a spiritual watching but the other one it's a partial proof doesn't want to endure afflictions doesn't want to work it doesn't want to endure to the end it's not sound doctrine paul told timothy early in the book in chapter 2 verse 10 second timothy chapter 2 verse 10 therefore i endure all things for the elect's sake to me that's sound doctrine that sound doctrine right there that they may also obtain salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory for his faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer with him we shall also reign if we suffer but our flesh don't want to suffer sound doctrine right here if we deny him he will he will deny us amen so if we deny suffering he's going to deny us think about it suffering is an integral part of being an effective witness for christ it is an important part it's imperative it's it's extremely important part because i can witness to you sorta with my mouth but it ain't really witnessing then brother brad says i'd rather see you live be a sermon than preach it because one requires suffering laying down your life because that's really what a witness for christ is you live the life that christ lived amen paul said in second timothy chapter four verse six for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand paul got to a place that he said himself that his own life wasn't even dear to him how can we how can a human being get to that place where their own life isn't even dear to them i'll tell you how because when you give your life to god it's no longer yours to be deal with but when you're holding on to it and this is what you want and it's got to be this way you're getting away from being the witness that christ has called you to be now some of you are probably thinking well that was paul he was a chosen vessel he was a special one i thought you thought you were the chosen i thought you thought you were elected what's the difference what's the difference look at this scripture revelations chapter 20 verse 4. now hope you don't mind all the scriptures that just it's just the way it is revelations 20 verse 4 and i saw thrones and they that sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for what the witness of jesus wow you want to be a witness for jesus look at they went through and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received the mark upon their foreheads or their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years this is the elect if you're gonna ruin reign with christ you are the bride and look what they had to suffer undeniable witness for christ they're willing to suffer they're reigning we just we just read the scripture if you want to be an undeniable witness for jesus christ always remember you got a target on your back there is a target on your back no matter how true of a witness you can be you will always have that target in fact the godlier you live the more you're going to suffer for it simply because the more that you love god the more the devil hates you don't look at him as the same because if you live in the world the devil's going to leave your leave you alone and you won't have much persecution but you start standing for the truth you got a target on your back second timothy chapter 3 verse 10 but thou has fully known my doctrine my manner of life my purpose my faith my long-suffering my charity my patience my persecutions my afflictions he never said anything about my speech it's talking about the life that he witnesses amen which came unto me at antioch iconium lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me so he gives the praise he knows it's god inside of him amen but he says look it's not just me being the chosen vessel now yeah all that will live godly in christ jesus they're going to suffer the same persecutions it's just it's really a part of being an undeniable witness for christ peter could not stand the test he was missing what he needed to stand the test we need the holy ghost so bear in mind that as we desire to be this type of witness that we're going to end up suffering more in the flesh for it so that's why i ask the question what are you willing to give up how how deep do you want to go with being a witness for christ in this way we just can't get away from suffering amen the spirit in this last day paul called this day perilous times and the spirit would cause people to be satisfied with just a form of godliness i'm in the message i got friends in the message i come to church i'm i believe this but people are not going to be suffering very much persecutions if you have only a form of godliness because the devil's not scared of a form but when you've got power you've got the power of the holy ghost then you're going to get persecuted remember you're an enemy of satan and he wants to destroy your witness he wants to destroy your influence that you have he wants you to become ineffective in your witnessing so the more you're on target the more the devil has got his guns pointed at you now jesus to me was the most perfect example of being an undeniable witness for the father yet there were many people who denied it and this is kind of what's important that we understand just because you're witnessing really well it doesn't mean you got a parade behind you and and the and the trumpets and the and the the bands are going jesus was loved by his father he was hated by his brethren just like joseph here he was sold out for personal gain amen jesus was called a liar a beelzebub accused of not caring for the people the common people ordered him gladly but it was those religious people he had a problem with the most he was a true witness for the father but with those religious people he wasn't a true witness god hid himself from the knowledge jesus had an amazing ministry most of the people on the planet most had benefited from jesus ministry when he was there he chose 12 disciples to help him spread the good news the bible tells us that when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion because he saw them fainting having uh being sheep having no shepherd no one to lead them no one to guide them so he asked his twelve disciples would you pray with me on this situation just pray with me about it eventually 70 more disciples wanted to help witness with jesus amazing ministry but we know what happened they got to a place where they couldn't stomach the word they complained about the word being too hard for them they wanted it like this and not like the way jesus was giving it out and what happened to him they eventually left i'll say it like this to you without a love for all the word how will you manifest all the word in in order for me to manifest perfect love i've got to deny myself and i know i don't want to you know hear about denying myself and dying out but how am i going to manifest what i really want if i don't do what i need to do first so it's part of the gospel you can't leave out you're only going to make partial proof of your ministry man shall live by every word of god witnessing isn't just sharing with our lips the enjoyable part of the word it's sharing with our lives in thousands of way how jesus handles so many situations brother branham taught us if you want to know how god is just look at jesus and you'll know exactly exactly who god is we want people to look at our lives through all the trials and all the tests and all the things that were that's going wrong and and then they got a chance of seeing the real christ how do we handle life how do we handle persecutions how do we handle false accusations so after the 70 changed their minds and left jesus turns to his disciples and he asked a question are you on your way out too is this too hard for you will you go away will you also go away he said and in john chapter 6 verse 6 8 then simon peter answered lord to whom shall we go thou has the words of eternal life in other words whatever you say that's the way it's going to go just like roof i'll go where you go i'll live where you live she wasn't worrying about suffering we need to hunger for all the word to be an undeniable witness for christ amen of course satan didn't like the stand that the 12 disciples took at that time so what does he do satan smites the shepherd and watches the sheep scatter those disciples were trained by the very best trainer ever in the history of the world but without the holy ghost inside of them it was impossible to witness for christ undeniably through their persecutions and this is where most of the time we fail because we're trying to prove something so i want to ask the question when push comes to shove can we lay down our life when push comes to shove can we continue to love the unlovable or are you just going to quit walk away and say well you know god's with me over here can we endure all things for the elect's sake in other words can we be an undeniable witness for christ it's more than what you say it's how you handle everything that comes against you even if it's wrong amen amen satan wanted to destroy jesus because he was being an undeniable witness for his heavenly father so what does the devil do he sets up false accusers false witnesses to achieve his ultimate goal matthew chapter 26 verse 59 so this is going to happen as you're wanting to be a good witness for christ people are going to come and they're going to falsely accuse you they did it to jesus and he told us if they did it to the to the green tree what are they going to do to the dry tree now the chief priests and the elders and all the councils fought witness against jesus to put him to death but found none yea though look at this many false witnesses came yet found a nun now the last came two false witnesses and they said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and build it in three days which was exactly the truth but because of their carnal understanding they didn't understand what it meant and the high priest rose and said unto him answer thou nothing what is it what is it which these witnesses against thee look at here but jesus held his peace you talk about a good way to witness sometimes we just need to hold our peace when people are going like this at you amen i know you you feel like oh i want to be a better witness why is this happening to me it's happening because the bible says all they that live godly in christ jesus are going to suffer it i know we want to get away from it no we don't want to go through that christians hurt they're the only group that gets hurt and still stands yes amen the only group that turns the cheek that goes the second mile that keeps going because it's not them it's god in them amen it's the holy ghost in them amen jesus held his peace when he was falsely accused if you're never getting falsely accused i'm going to say there's something's wrong somewhere beware when all men speak good of you now the same thing happens when jesus goes before pilate the very same thing matthew a little further in the chapter matthew chapter or next chapter over chapter 27 verse 12 matthew 27 verse 12 and when he was accused of the chief priests and the elders he answered nothing then said pilate unto him hearst thou not how many things their witness against thee and he answered him to never a word in so much that the governor marveled greatly do you want to be an undeniable witness for christ do you want people to marvel greatly then learn let learn to let god fight your battles not you but god fight them in other words you have to learn to suffer well you just don't say a word and suffer make it let it look like it's just all true that's what jesus did he's our example he'll sort it out amen there's always going to be people bear false witness against you even though it's commanded by god thou shalt not bear false witness right it's one of the commandments people are still doing it amen it's the spirit of self it is the spirit of self especially in this age despisers are those that are good i i mean if nobody's you know doing me any harm why in the world do i feel even tempted to go falsely accuse this person it's not bothering me i don't even know the person they're just driving down the expressway they didn't bother me see it's something behind it something's behind that you just keep doing good just keep doing good amen when jesus described jesus he said when reviled he reviled not again but he committed himself to him that judges righteously that's hard to do it takes trust you have to trust god beyond you having to get something worked out amen jesus was an undeniable witness we must follow his example if we want to be an undeniable witness keep in mind as we witness this way we never never bear witness of our light jesus didn't bear witness of his life i mean jesus did say i am the light of the world but this is how he how he spoke it in john chapter 5 verse 31 john chapter 5 verse 31 if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true so when you stand and you want to give witness to yourself it's not a true witness of christ so an undeniable witness for christ does not even mix his own light with the light of christ john chapter 1 verse 6 john chapter 1 verse 6 there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe notice he was not that light but he was set to bear witness of that light that was the true light which light of every man that cometh into the world he was in the world the world was made by him in the world knew him not he came to his own and his own received him not see even though we want to be an undeniable witness for christ it doesn't mean everybody's going to flock to us and say yo yeah you're a believer what did jesus tell nicodemus in john chapter 1 verse 11 john i'm sorry john 3 verse 11. very very saying to you we speak that we do know and testify that what we have seen and ye receive not our witness but that doesn't mean you you still can't be an undeniable witness for christ that's right you just got to know ahead of time the majority of the people are not going to receive that the majority won't they didn't receive christ i mean everybody does not mind them being fed them being taken care of jesus taking them to heaven paying for the price at calvary but the moment that jesus says i want you to lay down your life for your brother wait a minute i want a different gospel it's a partial gospel amen but as many as received him as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name i want power to witness all that a christian should witness amen what i notice about most people that we have witnessed too is that they rejoice with you for a short time they appreciate you in the ministry for a while but eventually they go off and do their own thing now we have seen this many people come and go over the years remember witnessing to somebody in a restaurant and began to talk to them about the lord and they finally came to church and i'll tell you the first day they were in church they were weeping in the presence of god and i came in the next next morning or to the restaurant and there there she was she was a waitress and she told me about everything that was happening uh that god was dealing with her right in the in the service and it wasn't long after that she stopped coming and there's stories after stories after stories about it they rejoice with you for a while they appreciate you they appreciate the ministry and after a while they just leave just when you think they've received the light you realize they were only rejoicing in it for a time jesus said in john referring to uh john referring to john the baptist in john chapter 5 saint john chapter 5 verse 35 he was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light yes the hardest thing i think for a believer is is to deny himself to keep denying himself to continue to walk in new light amen because everybody wants to be set free from the devil but they don't want to be a true lay down your life servant for christ and you've got to continue to deny yourself to keep walking in the new light because jesus don't come to a believer who needs to be saved and says you need to lay down your life and start serving others no there's a greater need the need is this man needs salvation this need this man needs to come to know me as a savior but after a while there's more light we got to continue to walk in the light as he's in the light amen amen all right verse 36 but i have greater witness than that of john for the works which the father has given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father have sent me the works bear witness of who you're really representing not what you say not what you believe not which what camp you're in it's the works do not let yourself become discouraged there's always going to be people around you that doubt your witness john chapter 10 verse 24 says then came the jews round about him and said unto him how long does thou make us to doubt if thou be the christ just tell us plainly are you an undeniable witness or not jesus answered them i told you and you you believe not the works that i do in my father's name they bear witness of me our focus needs to be in our works the thing that we don't think much about the thing we put little attention to john chapter 15 verse 25 but this came to pass that the word might be fulfilled that it is written in the law they hated me without a cause they hated jesus without a cause hatred can become vicious even without a cause hatred without a cause is simply this is a john martin definition is simply a spirit of self that is out of control it's yourself out of control when you don't get what you want you begin to hate in some form or another and when you do it's going to come out look at cain we want to be filled with the spirit we want to speak the truth and love not hate speak the truth in love praise the lord jesus's whole life was to bear witness of the truth john chapter 18 verse 37 pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then i'm sorry i have to go through this so fast because there's just a lot to get through jesus answered thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born for this cause came into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth and everyone that is of truth hears my voice what's your purpose that you're in the world should it not be the same now look he bore witness and he's standing in front of a man that was doubting that he didn't know but he couldn't hear the voice of god right pilate couldn't hear the voice of god if he did he would have never allowed this to happen only those that really hear the voice of god are going to be able to witness you an undeniable witness for christ you're not going to get everybody to jump on board amen jesus addresses this church laodicea the church in this age he addresses him these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness yes jesus was a faithful and true witness but look how many people are blind can't see it and to this day our crucifying him afresh so we want to be an undeniable witness for christ but it isn't it isn't going to be like we would like it to be true i would want to live such a a perfect life that everybody just passed me on the back and says yeah you're you're a real christian brother john no it's never gonna happen but we're not called to bring everybody in we're called to witness to everybody but only few come in the majority your witness of being the christian that acts right is the one that's going to witness against them on the day of judgment we're still called to witness to them we just don't get the results we want i hope you understand what i'm trying to say acts chapter 26 verse 15 god calls men to witness and here paul is giving his testimony sharing his testimony and he asked the lord this question who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom thou persecuted so i'm going to say like this when you you when you're persecuting the the truth you're persecuting jesus amen when you're persecuting someone who's standing for the truth you're persecuting jesus because that's exactly what's happening with saul here and jesus said i i am jesus whom thou persecuted but arise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness knows they're two different things there are two different things here now they can be the same but they're smoking two different things both of these things without seeing those things which i will appear unto thee oh by the way you're gonna have to suffer that's part of being a witness when you minister you don't win you don't suffer not suffering when you're telling somebody you know you need to cut your hair no but look verse 17 delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles whom i now send you why don't you just not send me and then you want to worry about delivering me but if you're going to be a true witness you're going to get persecuted and you're going to need deliverance yes amen from the persecutors [Music] but you still have the job to open their eyes to turn them from darkness into light from the power of satan unto god now how did he do that by preaching no but when he got whipped and he got shipwrecked and he went through all those things and he stood there and he said father forgive they don't know what they're doing that was a witness that was a witness of jesus christ being alive he's risen from the from the tomb still preach still got to preach but you got a witness you got to be in undeniable he was an undeniable witness being an about witness is a huge responsibility it isn't easy i've read this quote before brother branham said and a man running from the presence of the lord he says christianity and i just want to put in here an undeniable witness of christianity is an everyday rugged life living for god in this present world it's a constant burning of the fire and the love of god in the heart that sets you off fire and puts you out yonder with people making converts for christ wow that's an undeniable witness for christ it's all about responsibility a rugged life is a life filled with suffering for others a major part of being an undeniable witness for christ is being willing to suffer for the lord if you're willing to suffer you're going to be witness more if you're not willing to suffer don't want to go through any kind of pain then how are you going to witness form isn't that what peter did before he got the holy ghost isn't that how he acted but after he got the holy ghost he found himself unworthy to be crucified like jesus was crucified and he wanted to crucify himself upside down so the more that you want to suffer from the greater witness you can be for him remember it's not what happens to you the most but how you react to what happens to you how you react that's the witness we don't want to spend time talking about what was said what was done that there's there's no there's no witness in that the witness is how you are going to react to what was said to you what was done to you amen that becomes your witness is your reaction first peter chapter five verse one first peter chapter five verse one the elders which are among you i exhort i'm also an elder and a witness of what of the sufferings of christ peter was a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed paul was a witness look at all the sufferings he went through everything that the persecutions that accompanied him he was filled with sufferings and yet he wanted to know christ more in the fellowship of his sufferings it's the power to say like this it's the part of god that most people run away from so if you want to get to the heart of god go where most people don't go lord i'm going through whatever others do whatever they say however they act i'm going through it's me and you lord amen first john chapter 1 verse 1 first john chapter 1 verse 1 1-1-1 that which was from the beginning that which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we seen it john said and we bear witness but what does he say here and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested onto us that which we have seen and heard we declare it unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ so we take whatever christ has given us and we bear witness you can't give out what you don't have try loving your enemy when you don't have that love inside of you to love that enemy amen try go on the second mile when you said i'm done with this situation try turning the cheek when you said i've turned it enough you understand what i'm saying we witness with our life and we need to look for opportunities to lay down our life for somebody to esteem someone better than ourselves to witness with your life and not just our words to wash somebody's feet they're dirty they're stinky they shouldn't have been walking where they were walking they need to be taken care of but will you lay down your life to help somebody or are you just going to talk about it we preach with our mouth but we witness with our life we've all been given a ministry to witness to the world with amen second corinthians chapter five tells us that we've all been given a ministry of reconciliation i think brother ron made mention of that in our men's meeting or maybe it was brother mark one of you we've been given a ministry of reconciliation and he committed it to us and this day we are ambassadors for christ not for our lives but for the life of christ now we witness our ministry as an ambassador of christ we want to be the very best representative that we can be for god but if we only speak to people in part and not the whole then we're not going back to what god told us in the great commission teach all things to all people to observe everything that i've i've commanded you so god is interested that everyone walks in all the light yes not just me not just you but the people you talk to your family your neighbors we talked about our neighbors god has this undeniable longing and desire to see people walk in truth i have no greater joy than to see that my children than to hear my children walk in truth now the scripture teaches us how to be a model witness amen in fact second timothy chapter 3 verse 16 says all scripture is given by the inspiration of god and it's profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction or righteousness we might say that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works i believe notice all good works that's where you witness we can become an undeniable witness through these scriptures that we have second corinthians chapter six verse one second corinthians chapter six verse one we then as workers together how many wants to work together amen you know it's harder to work with somebody it's easier to work by yourself god wanted every one of his disciples in one mind and one accord he he did not come with the power until they got there we're all wanting a greater power to be a greater witness well we need to take the steps the humble steps to get there because all them were on as it were in the knees in their heart humbling themselves with one mind one accord desiring god when you desire god that's when god can come amen we then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain for he saith i have heard thee in the time accepted in the day of salvation have i suckered thee be hold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation verse 3 giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed so when you're wanting to be an undeniable witness for christ you have this ministry right you're witnessing you don't want your ministry blamed so the way to do that is give no offense sometimes when we witness for jesus we can become directly or indirectly offensive we've all experienced it what i mean is that there could be something in our mind that's offensive towards another person sometimes you don't know how to say it you don't know what to say but she feels it needs to be said i'll just tell you if you conceive a thought a negative thought inside it's going to come out somehow because you've conceived it the key is don't conceive the thought you don't want to conceive a thought that ends up wanting to condemn somebody we don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater we don't want to call down fire from heaven upon somebody and we don't want to blast someone else's ministry just because we don't agree that would be an offense and eventually would hurt your own ministry your own witness now we're talking about being an undeniable witness for christ luke chapter 17 verse 1 luke chapter 17 verse 1 then said he unto the disciples it is impossible but the that offenses will come they're going to come you can't get away from it i know you want to be in the best church with the most loving people and have the best neighbors and you want to be married to the best man and the best woman and have the best children and the best parents but i'm telling you all fences are going to come but woe unto him through whom they come this means you have control of not being an offense with your ministry we share the gospel truth we share it with defense you stand for the word you don't stand against another person you're trying to save them you have to have the spirit father forgive they don't know what they're doing it needs to be just the opposite of offense that's your brother that's your sister you got to grab him you got to get him you got to help him verse 2 it were better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck and he was cast into the sea that he should offend one of these little ones never let your witnessing be an offense never luke chapter 9 verse 49 and you will allow me just to go a little bit later thank you you know that permission i'm being honest it helps me it takes pressure off of me because i don't never ever want to talk to talk hold people up for nothing but it's so bad i mean this question to me was well spoken in sincerity they if it was they could have just said how can i be a better witness but the way this question was written there was so much harden to it and deserves the very best answer amen give giving no off oh where am i at i'm so sorry luke chapter 4 verse 49 thank you and john answered and said master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbade him because he wouldn't follow us and jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us jesus could see something just because they weren't willing to walk with him jesus could see that it wasn't against him and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to jerusalem and he sent messengers before his face and they went and headed into a village of the samaritans to make ready for him and they didn't receive him because he set his face to go to jerusalem and the samaritans didn't have no part with jerusalem at least that's what the woman at the well said and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord we've got to straighten this thing out well thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and just consume them and we got an example in the bible elias did it and he turned and he rebuked them and he said you know not what manner of spirit you are of for the son of man is not come to destroy men's lives but to save them and yeah they went to another village notice this here's jesus sends into this village doesn't work got to go to another village but what happened sounded like it was in vain got on the wrong track something went wrong but you know what jesus was teaching them so when things don't seem to be going right jesus is teaching jesus is teaching not in vain not in vain what we go through all for a purpose the disciples needed to be an undeniable witness for christ a lot of times we we think we're doing god a service by trying to set things straight we're trying to prove what's right what's wrong but don't be offensive giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed we are set to the defense of the gospel until we're out of here amen somehow when people see you they and god does reveal to them that they were wrong they got to know who to grab onto but if they see that you were being offensive towards them they're going to be too scared to grab on [Music] the scriptures teach us and furnishes how to handle wrong situations some dad like to do a service on that second corinthians chapter 6 verse 4. let's look at these scriptures second corinthians chapter six verse four so giving no offense that the ministry be not blamed verse three verse four says but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of god now how do we do that did i just tell them i belong to send the light church and i believe in the ministry they're they're they're into missions they they they they do this they no you don't approve yourself with that but you do it in much patience this is how you prove your ministry in patience in afflictions in necessities in distresses in stripes imprisonments and turmoils in labors in watchings in in fast you know none of this has offense to it you're standing for the defense of the gospel you're you're handling things the way christ handles them we prove ourselves through our sufferings all these are sufferings who wants to suffer nobody that's why it's hard for us to be more effective than what we are when we realize that we got to do more give more then we'll be there we'll be more of a witness i have someone i've shared with uh a number of times and probably wouldn't mind me saying it's my my son who i'm trying to raise to run the company right and he deals with people and it's hard to deal with people why because people want to do their own thing they want to tell you you're right they're right and it becomes difficult to navigate around any kind of negativity with a person but we i in all the times that we've spent time helping him with this we're following this what we're reading right here yes and he's always concluded if things are going to get better it's because i am going to have to be better i'm going to have to suffer long i'm going to have to be patient i'm going to have to lay down my life i'm going to have to and it'll be good for a few days and then we'll spend time changing it again but he has said more times come right back to it we need a revelation of this we approve ourselves through our sufferings through manifesting the true love of god that should have brought in our heart by the holy ghost not by calling down any kind of fire on somebody verse six how do we do it we do it by pureness we do it by knowledge we do it by longsuffering we do it by kindness we do it by the holy ghost he knows how to do it by love unfeigned by the word of truth notice by the power of god not by the power of john martin john martin can't do anything right there should we it should have been anonymous amen on that one seriously we need the power of god amen by the armor of righteousness on the right hand on the left by honor and dishonored by evil report by good report by his deceiver is it true so i'll say no matter what situation you're in whether you're being honored or dishonored whether you're being an evil port at you or a good report you can have an undeniable witness for christ as unknown yet well known as dying your flesh your your old nature and behold we live as chastened but we're not killed it's just god teaching us amen as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making ready many rich don't you love giving to people who don't have what you have and you have the treasures of christ inside of you amen you have the riches of christ inside of you and when you give them out you make people rich as having nothing yet you possess all things because you got christ amen so just closing now i'm closing how to be an undeniable witness for christ that the world sees me no more and that they would see christ only always well one thing we haven't talked much on but it sums it up in one word stay humble let your focus be on denying yourself because if you can get rid of yourself people are only going to see christ because that's all that's left over remain crucified daily that christ may live fall more in love with jesus we're set to the defense of the gospel not the offense by this shall all men know that you're my disciples yes by this type of love where you can love the unlovable right right that you lay down your life and you're not getting anything out of it you ever give up your time and don't get anything out of it that's the the marks of a christian it's truly the marks of a christian you don't have to get anything out of the deal you give of yourself that's christ in you giving oh remember offenses are going to come can't do nothing about it be prepared for them stay filled with god walking in the spirit keeping yourself the bible says in the love of god amen only you can keep yourself in love with god spend time with jesus one scripture psalms 119 165 great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them i'll tell you what if if you get bothered by something you read this scripture and your love will be challenged you will be challenged to love god more because our love can get to a place where nothing will offend us i want that don't you be prepared to suffer long for somebody it'll be worth it all when we get to heaven let's stand together let's leave here determined to become a greater and more undeniable witness for jesus christ just determine it like like we need to determine i i need i need to go find somebody to pick up i want to be labeled as a good samaritan not just a samaritan [Laughter] but a good one and what makes him good when he does the will of the father yes amen amen amen let's well uh maybe as cheryl comes let's just all bow in a word of prayer amen with every eye closed every head bound lord we're before you humbles we know how to be we thank you for being an undeniable witness to the world you attracted us through another human being when we saw the life being lived something grabbed our attention we just never seen it before the the true life of christ was manifested grabbed our attention and lord by your grace we're here today because of that and lord it's our desire desire this precious brother or sister turned in this question just wanting to be better for you god would you bless them would you bless them lord fill them and fill us lord we're right there with them with a greater portion of the holy spirit lord that it would be you doing the witnessing through us we know everybody won't surround us with praises but lord if we can just know if we can just know that we're pleasing you it'll come out and those that hear your voice they'll catch it and for those lord we're grateful for but lord even for those that are not your seed who we do not know lord you still called us to be an undeniable witness for them so on the day of judgment they can also witness our life lord please hear our prayer move upon this desire that we have to see you in each and every one of our lives in a greater way lord we know this is a we're asking for a hard thing we know trials are going to come we know persecutions are going to come we know it's going to be hard but lord what a honor it is to stand with those who've gone on before who stood the test stayed true they didn't quit lord those 70 they left the 12 knew they couldn't so glad you know our hearts lord that even when we fail you know we just need more holy ghosts i pray that you'd bless everyone hungering for more of you oh god bless this little church lord i pray that you would so build us up in in love one for another endeavoring to keep the unity compassion one for another laying down our lives esteeming one another better than ourselves oh god put a hedge of protection around this this little local body protect us from the enemy protect this ministry lord god uses to go reach out with that hard rugged life with the love of god inside winning souls for you lord to bring them in to bring them in you told us to go out be a witness grant it lord use us father we give ourselves to you and we give you the praise and honor for all these things we humbly pray in jesus christ's name amen amen praise the lord when we all get to heaven what a day
