yes god bless you welcome thank you for coming and daring out may the Lord Jesus bless you protect you and fill you with him amen well we're looking forward to this service tonight and I with brother Ron agree that God has something special for us amen is it's hidden in the word he may not come out and say brother John but he still means brother John or son John I'm sorry so we need to be having ears to hear him speak to us personally and don't wait for it halfway through the service don't wait to the end don't wait for if it has to do with a certain subject you like him to speak on but be expecting him every sentence that comes out of his mouth that God wants to bless us abundantly above all that we could ask or think so I believe it has everything to do with our expectation amen so we appreciate brother Darrell he hasn't been out much and to think that he he wanted to come here what a blessing that is for us and my prayer is that God would just reward him a double fold for for reaching out to us because we need help amen we need to be lifted up out of this thing that the enemy is trying to bring upon all of us as we've gone through this we just need with the Spirit of the Lord is there's Liberty and we just want to worship Him with all of our heart him let's remember to pray for his daughter Alice Ellison as she takes that test tomorrow and let's just get right behind the word as our brother comes to minister the words of life to us let's saying only believe as our brother comes again [Music] only believe [Music] Oh [Music] hey man it's an awful small requirement isn't it he didn't say if you got $10,000 or you got a big college degree but he said if you can believe all things are possible to them that believe amen belief is something so simple the same faith that brought you to this meeting tonight that same faith applied to any promise of God's Word can bring it to pass it's just that simple but of course we know we live in a time when everything has to be complicated but I like simple things because I'm a simple person praise the Lord we greet your name of the Lord Jesus kind of such an honor to be with you if you have your Bibles to see them to turn with us to the book of John we want to read from Saint John chapter 11 starting to verse 17 we appreciate each one coming out as brother John said to brave had into the into the world again after we've been things a little bit a man and I leave out early in the morning to go back home or desire your prayers and in order to just be with us and we'll be praying for you down in Tennessee y'all pray for us down there we'll be praying for you up here a man and just that there's a lift on off of our country when get back to some some state of normalcy again a man just to be able to all gather together in the house of God and amen you know as you go into store and people's almost afraid to look at you and get very in myself don't you a mess I just look forward to the time that we can all just shake one another's hands again and they men who is funny down down home I don't you've been standing for a few minutes but the down hallways haven't Church the other night and was getting ready to start our services back we've been now a couple of weeks back just as a third of the church at a time because we there's about 450 in our congregation and my pastor brother Donny he got up he said ma'am when we come back together we want to stay six foot apart no hand shaking and no hugging neck you know we want to we'll enjoy social distance and then he call me to the full fit me shook my hand said habits are just hard to break you just kind of funny where he got a little bit of teasing over there yeah you told us not to build yourself Amen may the Lord richly bless you Saint John now chapter 11 verse 17 do you love him god bless your brother Marty streaming tonight and such Kathleen when the Lord bless you amen the Bible says this now when Jesus came he found that they had lain that he had lain in the grave for days already now Bethany was not on Jerusalem about 15 furlough is off and meaning the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort their brother of course this is Lazarus then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming she went and met him but Mary said still in the house this said Martha unto Jesus Lord if the house had been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thy will asked of God God will give it to thee and Jesus jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again and Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this amen amen let us pray I want to speak to you just a few minutes just a simple thought because I'm just a simple person but I want to speak to you just a few minutes on go meet Jesus Heavenly Father Lord our hearts was just warmed as the songs of praise were saying to you this afternoon Lord God it sounds so wonderful to hear the voices of the saints uniting together as one to give you praise Lord father we long for the hour that we can all gather ourselves back together and Lord that may be those with with health issues not able to come Lord because of the virus Lord and the possibilities but Lord we long for that Howard or that get all gather ourselves back together again lift our voices of Thanksgiving unto the Lord but until that time we press on God we do Lord we trawl the sword and fight the good fight of faith I pray Lord Jesus that you'd come this evening God and take this little the scripture reading Lord and may you just make it so real that you just step out of the pages of the Bible and walk among us Lord and father we ask that you just bless brother John and but the officers here of the church Lord and this little assembly God may they reflect you in such a light in this evening hour that those down at Walmart and those old God down at the drugstore and at work that they could see Jesus once again living in the lives of our brothers and our sisters for Lord it's truly not ourselves that we want to represent but it's you Lord so father I pray to that may I just get myself out of the way god I have no ability Lord but I just get myself out of the way and ask your God that you would step in and speak out through my lips to your children Lord and all God may you not only be the speaker tonight but may you be the hearer of the words that are spoken may our souls cry out a man and Lord we receive that because it's the truth Lord bless those that are here those who wanted to be here your little bride all around the world Lord meet their needs tonight we pray and father once again as we've asked you so many times Lord lift this thing off of our nation we pray we just love you Lord we know God that our table for we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says I mean God bless you say so you may be seated this evening huh I want you to draw your attention back to verse 20 I trust to get the right bottle of water Lord but I want to call your attention back to verse 20 this has been Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went out and met him but Mary sat still in the house now I believe that these two scriptures represent everyone that is in this church tonight for the way I see it we can do one or two things we can do like Martha when she heard that Jesus was coming she got up and went to medium or we can be like Mary and sit still in the house because you're going to do one or the other Jesus said where two or three are gathered in my name I will be in their midst you see he comes and the power of his resurrection he sees healing in the form of his word he comes to pour out the Holy Ghost he comes to fulfill every promise that he made to the believer he comes to bring deliverance he comes to bring healing he comes to bring forgiveness he gums to bring joy unspeakable and full of glory when Jesus comes the tempters power is broken and when he comes we can either get up and go meet him or we can sit still in the house but I say this afternoon let's not sit still in the house he's here his word says he's here then let us get up and step out and possess what belongs to us because this is our day this is our time this is our hour this is our moment to shine Eman the promises of God's Word for the believer they belong to us this is our generation like the sister that was in the communist country and they wasn't allowed to go to church and so they would go to a bread shop and the man would they have a secret place that they meet to have Church and he would put the address in bread and they would sell the brand and people would go into the bread shop and they would ask for a certain kind of bread and that's where they found out the meetings were to be held and so the sister found out where the meeting was going to be held because he was against the law just similar self aren't you glad we go to a country that we can still assume with ourselves together and so she was going to the secret church service and she run into a soldier and he took his rifle and he stuck it up to it he said where are you going and she said my brother died and I'm going for the reading of the wheel and when she got to the secret meeting coma they sang songs of worship she danced in the spirit a message of times before that somebody interpreted somebody was healed and somebody was delivered they had foot washing they had communion and on the way home she was just so happy that she was singing the Holy Ghost is mine joy is mine he's of his mind and she ran into the same soldier and he said what did your brother leave you she said all he left me everything I'm taking this afternoon hallelujah because of Calvary ever redemptive blessing belongs to us he left it to us let's leave let's take what God has given us by His grace I say let's get up and don't meet Jesus Jesus is the answer to every problem that we got I'm sick then let's go up just get up and go meet him I'm discouraged get up and go meet him I'm depressed then get up and go meet him you see hallelujah Mary he knew that death had come to their house and sorrow and fear had come to their house but Martha had called a revelation hallelujah she called a revelation that caused her to get up and go meet Jesus in our study our Bible story we find that death had struck the home of Mary and Martha and no doubt they thought how could this happen to us ain't it funny we always say that no how could you know Jesus is our friend he slept in our spare room that we had he he sat at her table and we're message believers we've left everything to follow him how could this sorrow come to us how could this doctor's report be so mad we're his people he's officers we should never have trials as I said this one we we should never have troubles every day should be blue skies and spooks every day should be a picnic He loves us we're his children those are wonderful thoughts but the problem is Jesus never said he never said that in fact he said still fishes you'll be persecuted laughs that monkey for my namesake they met he never said we wouldn't cry he never said we wouldn't have sorrow he never said we wouldn't suffer he never said we wouldn't get stinky he never promised smooth sailing but as I said this morning he just simply said I'll never leave you the way I forsake you when the storm is at its greatest I'll be right there with you you see sometimes God allows things to come into our lives so that he can come to us and show us just how great yes you see God can tell every one of us I'm the drink God I'm a great healer I'm I'm a great deliverer if we would have said Amen we believe that but you see God allows things to come into her life he moves upon that situation and he heals us of cancer when the doctor says there's no way he opens a blind eye when the doctor says there's no way he raises up the data then we say you are a healer you are our deliveryman there is no God like after all experience is the best teacher amen and sometimes God allows things to come into our life just to show us how great he is you may have a great cancer you may have a great trial you may have a great problem but our God is greater is that true yeah but no means taking light of your suffering we have real tears yes we did we have real pain who free I know what it's like otherwise like to lay your head on a third wheel of your car and cry physically cry because the pain is so bad going down your legs that you can't go in your neck you can't turn it left to right and the pain is just unbearable sometimes so I'm not belittling your pain at all I understand the pain in your legs is real the pain in your heart is real it's a real earth it's real it's real fear but I'm just trying to tell you we've got a real God who's bigger than overhead Mary and Martha in this great time of sorrow and in the great Dominique it was their darkest hour that was Mary and Martha left alone their mother and father was done dead in Dallas just in two girls their brother last week was gone and they were alone in the world their brother was gone then they set in sackcloth and black veils and weeping and mourning over the loss of their brother is how we gonna make this meeting what are we gonna do it was the very darkest hour they had ever experienced but let me tell you it's in those darkest hours that Jesus always shows up you still up brother Darrell it's such a dark time then I say to you it's about time for him to show up baby oh my brother said one time I heard him say that when Jesus shows up he always shows out oh that's just the way he doesn't hey man it may be your darkest hour but he comes along at the darkest hour it was the woman with the blood issue it was her doctor's darkest hour 12 years and the doctor said the blood issue would not stop 12 years of bleeding they work on you that'll make you weary amen 12 years of battling this sickness this blood issue it was her darkest hour had the doctors after the Bible said she spent all her money guess what the doctor said they couldn't help her now wouldn't it be nice if I told her that before but it was only after they had bled her bank account dry that they said we can't help you it was in her darkest hour when the doctors turned her down that Jesus showed up it was the darkest time for gyruss when his little girl his only little daughter lay dead and at that darkest hour Jesus came home it was the darkest hour that Peter and the Apostles had ever seen out there on the sea not with 10,000 demons for they would drown them it was the darkest hour but it was in that darkest hour that Jesus came walking on the water Oh hallelujah and it was the darkest hour for Martha hey man it was in that dark hour that Martha got word that Jesus had come you see Martha realized the answer to her sorrow the answer to her darkness the answer to her fear was Jesus she realized God had a provided way and Jesus was the answer for everything she was going through and I tell you if this nation would only receive it Jesus is the answer for every problem this nation faces today he's the answer the answer to everything that we're going through he was the answer then he's the answer now and if there is the tomorrow he'll be the answer tomorrow he's the same yesterday today and forever amen she got the word that he had come and when she heard that he had come she got up and went to meet him it reminds me of Barabbas sitting there on the rocks of the wall of Jericho and he wore a beggar's robe that identified him as a blind beggar must have been a certain color or a certain style he wore this Roman you could tell by the robe he was wearing what was wrong with you more than just a beggar he was a blind beggar and he wore the beggars robe identified him as a blind beggar Sani to the son tried to get a few pennies and he got to thinking about his life he got them thinking about the doves he'd once had and he remembered his little girl had got sick and he went behind the house there where he was headed fell his way out to the back and he lifted up those blind eyes to the sky he said father my little girls sick and Lord I'd meet her I see the world to her tell me about the treason she brings me such comfort say God I need her don't take her from me boy if you let her live if she got well then it wasn't long after that that his wife took sick and he goes back behind the house again this is his house up towards heaven he said Lord my wife is sick perhaps she had the same thing his daughter had I don't really know but that Lord my wife is sick doesn't what I need her she washes my clothes my lord please don't take my little Queen from me if you let her live Lord I'll give you my little if she got well and so keeping his word to God he headed down to the temple with his lamb and he run into the priest and the priest said by part of mass where are you going he said I'm going to the temple to offer my lamb he said you can't do that by Barmes you need that lamb because in that day lamps were seeing high animals like they used dogs today in the bible times they used the lamb said you need that lamb to help you get around here take this money and go buy you a lamb to give to God and blind bartimaeus old God give me faith like that he said I never promised God a lamb I promised God ditch lamb and I kept off this lamp he will give me a lamb for my HUS a man is sitting there on the rocks that day he got to thinking about these ways of a provided lamb and sitting there he began to hear a noise and he said what's going on some said it's Jesus of Nazareth the Lamb of God the Lamb of God the Lamb of God that's my lamb become that would bribe Bartimaeus heard the lamb the provided way keeping in the crowd Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and someone said hey old man hold your peace or this is church he's mostly get excited to church but he cried the louder is that all Jesus thou son of David have mercy about me you see it wasn't his force that stopped Jesus it was his faith in Jesus and I say to you if this thing can't stop Jesus your fate could stop him tonight evening because he's the same yesterday forever the Bible said Jesus Stood Still they said he stopped he's calling for you be of good cheer you've stopped the master he's calling for you now blind Bartimaeus has left with this decision just like you are even the set steel most rocks or get up and go meet amen and the Bible says casting away his garment he arose he threw it off and he went to meet Jesus you know why because he knew ain't gonna need that behind Baker's robe no more a man that can see don't need a blind robe can you see what he saw he was blind as blind could be and yet he saw a lamb I know you can't give me that kind of vision hood amen blonder than anybody around him and yet he saw what they could not see they saw a man some of them several more rejected some of them was worshipping but by Bartimaeus saw a lamb providing for his eyes this afternoon a step towards the promise of word of God for your day that you're living in cast out the fear cast out the asthma gasps stop the high blood pressure cast out back trouble I don't need an offer on this road I don't need an oppression road because my god has provided aloud for me Amen you say how can you talk about healing when you're still hurting I'll talk about it till the hurt and stops a man because he shattered huge circumstances of situations there's nothing but lie advantages they provided lamb I've got a provided lamb to you that was God's provided way go meet Jesus that's right it's always his provided way when you got sorrow in your home go meet Jesus got sickness in your home go meet Jesus got heartache in your home go meet Jesus hallelujah if you got a need for anything go meet Jesus gomini he's got all the remedy he's not only the remedy he's the cure hey she got up and she went to meet you if God provided the way for us let's just bring a tire thing for just a minute we look at that what a wonderful example but now let's just bring it down to worry then if God provided a way for them and he's no respecter person's think he's also provided a way for us if you've done that back then he's gonna do it today or he's not the same right so God would not either way for us to go meet Jesus there has to be a way to do that in this day that we're living in if God provided the way for them to meet Jesus then he's obligated to provide a way for us to meet but in order to meet him you've got to know where he's at he said Jesus said in a little while the world sift me the Lord but ye shall see me power Lord how will we see you for I'll be with you even in you let us see that it's here now but you can only see him listen to me you can only see him and the manifestation of his word that is promised in the hour that you're living in that's the only way you'll ever see him it's when he comes to vindicate the word that's promised for the day you're living in you see if somebody come through that door driving across and come up the aisle blood borne out of his body and a crown of thorns a women would scream men would faint but then even Jesus don't care how real it looks that ain't him you know why how do you how can you say that's not Jesus because he so you've got to see how we would be here today how would we be here today if you can see the promise for today and when you see that promise manifested you have saw Christ restore you everybody's wearing masks now and it's something that's the only time you go to a bank with a mask on I was in the store the other day and I get this stuff this person you know they come in and I said well you've changed your mask and that's exactly what Jesus did twister get about two o'clock he's just changed his mask a little while the world see me no more but she shall see me how will we see but I'll be with you even in you then who is this mask where is your is masking hallelujah the mighty God don't fail wearing you thrill you that the world may see Jesus once again how through his people oh boy - good how do you Jesus said I'm behind you with the branches the bad does not bear the fruit man factors not even know Beauty in the vine that's true all the beauties in the grapes but we say Lord look at those grapes look at those leaves why it's the fruit of the fire that brings together don't you see you the beauty of Christ in this hour Abraham I am the vine and you are the branches define does not bear fruit therefore the only way Jesus could speak tonight it would be through my lips your lips my hands your hands my life your life why that's where he's failed in this hour I am the vine ye are the branches he doesn't bear the fruit anymore he just purchased his church and the church bears the fruit what kind of tree classroom because the life of the fire how are you the life of the finest now in the branch Oh what kind of fruit would you bury if the lot that was in him is in his church then it would bear the same kind of life that he bore when he was here and that's the fulfillment of st. John 14:12 fairly verily I say unto you the works I do it so you do also why because I'm the vine and do the branches in life it's in the behind moves into the bricks to bear the fruit making him the same yesterday today and forever he's hearing the person of the Holy Spirit I'm the vine you are the branches the vine does not bear the fruit Saint John 15 define cannot bear fruit it's the branches that bears the fruit has its energized from the mind and Christ is our energy your lips is his lips when you're energized your hands is his hands when you're energized I'm not talking about the energize buddy I'm talking about the energized church ain't my head hallelujah your hands is his hands when you're energized from the vine Christ as the life on the bond of his church and each member is the branch of his church this ministry is in his pride which is his body we are his body on the earth today bone of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit life of his life she is him expressed then where is he he's right here with us now just like he said he would be oh god help us catch that revelation when he was here he wasn't free of trouble the trouble that's what makes it a supersized it's so it's a paradox that God could dwell in the body the stewards that Jesus could raise the dead and grown with the headache but it's being manifested in flesh Christ in you the hope of all glory let's go back to Mary here just a little bit now Jesus centered the larger senator thy brother shall rise again and mark the center to him I know he shall rise again in the resurrection at the lat and Jesus sent into her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us without this she said unto him yay Lord I believe yay Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the Son of God words had come into the world and when she had said so she went her way and called marry her sister secretly saying the Masters come and calleth for thee think about the Masters come and call it for thee and as soon as she heard as soon as she heard Mary rose quickly and came until you see Martha the church the woman touches the church Martha the church the church went to Mary with the message who was still sitting in the house because she didn't know are you listen to me Martha was back at the revelation he's not coming he's here it would Mary receive that message she comes to Mary she's still sitting in the house Martha comes just Mary listen listen to me I know you're hurting I know you have sorrow I know you feel depressed I know you're nervous I know you feel like the world's coming to lead in and caving in on you I know we're in a quarantine I know we're in a virus I know the hundred thousand of God I know it looks bad I know the economy is crashed but listen Mary listen he's hearing that when that revelation struck a heart she rose quickly Mary rose quickly and went out to meet he why she had the same revelation that marked the time I know it's an unusual time a dark time an evil time a time of unrest but he will be with us his spirit the Holy Spirit will leave in God this church until he comes in a physical body God's body United as his bride began one him and Christ together has the Spirit working in the flesh of the church like it worked in the flesh of Jesus Christ because it's a part of his body not Twain but one they are one a husband wife or one no longer two but the one Christ in his body is one the same spirit that was in crisis in his bride it's his body that unites them together with all the words God living in there himself manifested God manifesting himself through a mini member body what God did in one body called the body of Jesus he Nell does it in a mini membered body called the bride of Jesus Christ you see all God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into his church Christ was the mystery of God revealed and the church is the mystery or the revelation of Christ revealed in this hour oh god was he emptied into Christ and all Christ was he emptied into the church who are we more than just church members I'm not interested in being a church member side of my name on some role I want to know even the power of his resurrection I want that personal relationship with Jesus why can't we know him that way the only thing he ever asked the Father for when he was here he didn't have a coin and have a chair he walked everywhere he went he didn't have a change of clothes he wore the same clothes everywhere he went he said the birds have missed the Foxes have world but I the Son of Man have no place to lay my head and yet he never asked the father one time for him to Mew or a Cadillac the only thing he ever asked the father for what's it we have the house if he's here let's go meet him if you got a need just get up and go me thank God for every miracle that we've ever seen that miracles you thank God for every one of them thank God for the miracles that was done in the 60s but I'm so happy to know that we don't have to go all the way back to the days of a a Alan and some of these other people that had these great healing campaigns and brother branham and all these dear I'm so glad we don't have to go all the way back to their yeah to see that he's the same but I believe that saying God is doing things right now working through his body on the earth right now making st. John 14:12 the works I do she added also making that a reality greater works than these what does that mean you can't do nothing greater than range today but what to see the works I didn't show you also ain't great what is the Graduate means more what he done in one body now he's doing the same thing in a mini membered body in Africa in France and Switzerland all around the world it's God in His people making himself the same yesterday today and forever amen working in his people amen do you believe that we just share just a few things let's think the Lord do if I could just have just a couple of minutes the sister up and Delta Pennsylvania's sister Betty had glaucoma so bad that she had to wear sunglasses to church because the pressure and the line hurt her eyes so bad and she had to go to an eye specialist on Monday because of the glycol if she comes up for prayer on Sunday afternoon service and on Monday she goes to the doctor and the doctor examines our eyes you know what he says he said whoever seats you here they need to see an eye doctor there's nothing wrong with your eyes I was in the Philippines so there was a man one time his blood pressure was so high it was literally bleeding from his nose and the collar so that the man was sitting there and he was shaking in his face was blood red and blood was coming out his nose I said what's the matter with you they said his blood pressure is so high he's actually bleeding from his nose and so the brothers we just stood around him and we prayed and asked God to touch this poor man and when we say they may God is my witness he got up he wiped the blood off of his nose he shook his hand hallelujah and went down the street shopping the praises to God just stepped fast just dead so those are the meeting down in Kentucky one time his sister sitting right back here and we was just preaching and all of a sudden she jumped up started praising God I thought my goodness she got excited and then she set back down she set there for a few minutes you see God and went out got a blessing like a didn't leave did a few minutes later she came back in and sat down and went service was all right you know all these thoughts was going through my mind while nice preaching it's a battle up here you need to break her brother John he's thinking my goodness they're sleeping sure enough there's asleep I can sing it so all this was going on and we service Lois she said can I testify I turned that he said sure she said I've not even told my husband but I have a tumor on my breast and she said while the world was being preached I felt just the sting go through my body and she said I've jumped up and started praising God said I guess you noticed said I went out and checked myself in the bathroom said the tumor is completely go it's never come back I know the sister today her brother Jonas Hildebrandt up in Canada brother Jonas said so many sign of course it's cold up in that country people have sinus infections all the time maybe that's so many that they constantly just cleaned out his sinuses until they actually killed the nerves and he couldn't smell nothing he said brother there are food means nothing to me I can't even taste it you know you're sad you smell have something to do with your taste so he came to a parallel last February we was up there and I came to my prayer cloth I said brother Jonas you take this prayer cloth you put it under your pillow and when you begin to smell you call me well I was somewhere I don't even know where I was at but it was I dunno what time it was it was one o'clock in the morning and my phone goes up and his brother Jonas is saying can I call you are you awake yeah yeah sure buddy you can call me so he come he's a brother down oh he was so excited he said you ain't going to believe there's some simple what's going on buddy he said I was going home from church tonight he said guess what I said what he said I smelled a skunk praise God let me tell you when Jesus touches you even a skunk smells good it's a brother a tester for North Carolina called me said brother I bought my baby shut down in Texas said he's got some kind of rash that the doctors don't even know except the doctor said there's nothing that can do that I'm helping set his face is horribly disfigured see what you pray with us too sure but that's just brain dude days later he called me back he said brother down my god it's a miracle the babies he's got baby skin it's just as clean as it there's not even a sign of where the rash was because God he said his people making himself the same yesterday today and forever you know a story my daughter Jessica struck by trains with my family killed left in a wheelchair blinded from the exit did couldn't swallow had to put a feeding tube in her but God rich in His mercy I was laying in the Chapel of the hospital on the floor praying I didn't care who hurt my babies upstairs they told me she had a severe brain injury she's on life support system they told me she if she if she even lives she'll be nothing but a vegetable but we don't even expect her to live and I worked at surgery in that time 19 years of surgery assistant doctors and and I knew I could see the CT scanner I could see all that myself I knew how bad it was and I was laying there on the floor and I was crying out to God and I said Lord if you was here like you worked 2,000 years ago I said all I have to do is like the woman with the blood issue I would take my baby home that's even Lord you're not here like you were 2000 years ago but God is my witness later on that floor I heard a voice it wasn't honourable but a voice you know how it is you've heard it before something speak in my heart and this boy said but my bride is here if you touch her you have touched me I jumped off the floor because I realized all I need to do is get brother mark get brother John get sister Cheryl just get somebody it was just the same as Jesus laying hands on her because and against all odds the Lord Jesus raised her up she started talking again she started swallowing again and one day he and when he left he took the blindness with him and today she sees better than me say Floyd guard the gate blonde Bartimaeus his eyes is the same Lord God that gave my daughter back her ass he just used a different body Lester last year just all these
