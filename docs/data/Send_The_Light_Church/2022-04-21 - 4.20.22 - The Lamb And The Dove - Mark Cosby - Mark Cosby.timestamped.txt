[4:45] christ and we pray amen
[4:48] so saint john chapter one what's up
[4:49] reverse 29
[4:52] the next day john seeth jesus coming
[4:55] unto him saith behold the lamb of god
[4:58] which taketh away the sin of the world
[5:01] amen this is he of whom i said after me
[5:04] cometh a man which is preferred before
[5:06] me for he was before me and i knew him
[5:09] not but that he should be made manifest
[5:11] to israel therefore it might come
[5:13] baptizing with water and john bear
[5:15] record saying i saw the spirit
[5:17] descending from heaven like a dove and
[5:19] abold upon him and i knew him not but
[5:22] that he sent me to baptize with water
[5:24] the same said unto me upon whom thou
[5:26] shall see the spirit descending and
[5:29] remaining on him the same as he which
[5:31] baptizes with the holy ghost and i saw
[5:34] and bear record that this is the son of
[5:35] god you may be seated
[5:38] uh so the title of this little message
[5:39] is the lamb and the dove so before we
[5:42] get into it let's uh go into luke
[5:43] chapter 3
[5:45] verse 21 and 22
[5:48] same account that luke is talking about
[5:50] in john as well
[5:52] praise god amen
[5:55] so luke 3 chapter 20 or luke chapter 3
[5:58] 21-22 so it says
[6:01] now when all the people were baptized it
[6:03] came to pass that jesus also being
[6:05] baptized
[6:07] and praying the heaven was opened and
[6:10] the holy ghost ascending in a bodily
[6:12] shape like a dove upon him and a voice
[6:14] came from him and said thou are my
[6:16] beloved son and thee i am well pleased
[6:20] let's go to the chapter let's go to mark
[6:22] chapter one and we'll read two
[6:24] scriptures there
[6:26] nine and eleven
[6:29] i'd love to hear the
[6:31] the bible turning
[6:35] so mark chapter 1 verse 9-11 says
[6:40] and it came to pass in those days that
[6:41] jesus came from nazareth of galilee and
[6:44] was baptized of john and jordan and
[6:46] straightway coming out of the water he
[6:47] saw the heavens open in the spirit like
[6:50] a dove descending upon him there came a
[6:52] voice from heaven saying thou are my
[6:54] beloved son in whom i am well pleased
[6:56] and go to matthew chapter 3
[6:59] and get right into it
[7:00] so matthew chapter 3 verses 13 or verses
[7:03] 13 through 17.
[7:06] so it says
[7:08] then come to jesus from galilee to
[7:10] jordan unto unto john to be baptized of
[7:13] him but john forbade him saying i have
[7:15] need to be baptized of thee and cometh
[7:17] out of me and jesus answering said unto
[7:19] him suffered to be so now for thus it
[7:21] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[7:24] then he suffered him in jesus he was
[7:26] baptized and went straight away out of
[7:28] the water and lo the heavens were opened
[7:30] unto him and he saw the spirit of god
[7:32] descending like a dove and lightning
[7:34] upon it and lo a voice from heaven
[7:36] saying this is my beloved son whom i am
[7:38] well pleased so if you notice in each
[7:40] account of that scripture
[7:42] the author uh mentioned is like a dove
[7:46] and we know jesus was the lamb of god
[7:48] so if you notice that a dove in the lamb
[7:50] that's the only two creatures
[7:52] or that can mix
[7:54] and i'm trying to say is we have a
[7:56] spirit and we have to make sure we have
[7:58] a lamb spirit constantly because jesus
[8:00] was the lamb of god and god was
[8:02] represented as a dove those only two
[8:04] that could mix they could only two that
[8:06] you connect together so we cannot get by
[8:09] with having a wolf-like spirit we got to
[8:12] make sure we have a lamb spirit daily
[8:14] that's the key right there and jesus
[8:15] gave us that perfect example he was a
[8:18] lamb he was led
[8:20] he always wanted to do what the father
[8:21] told him to do
[8:22] so
[8:23] a little quote to read but a lamb is so
[8:25] gentle that it can be led notice that
[8:27] and that's the reason that god
[8:28] represented christ as the lamb and
[8:31] himself as the dove and on that day that
[8:33] john baptized jesus at the river of
[8:35] jordan one of the greatest events that
[8:38] ever taken place taking place right
[8:40] there notice how beautiful the lamb the
[8:43] meekest of all the creatures of the
[8:45] earth and the dove the meekest of all
[8:47] the fowls of heaven and that's the only
[8:49] way they ever could be united is the
[8:51] only way the dove would ever come on the
[8:53] land
[8:54] now when the dove came down john saw
[8:56] jesus and said behold the lamb of god
[8:59] that taketh away the sins of the world
[9:01] and john said i bear record seeing the
[9:04] spirit of god like a dove coming down
[9:06] and abiding on him
[9:08] hallelujah there you are the dove and
[9:10] the lamb united together that's when god
[9:13] and man became one that's when heaven
[9:16] and earth embrace each other hallelujah
[9:19] that's when god was made flesh brought
[9:21] it that's when god came down from the
[9:23] spirit form and was made amen
[9:26] amen and dwelt among us that's when he
[9:28] all eternity embraced each other that's
[9:30] when the human fallen race of adam's
[9:32] people and jehovah god and every angel
[9:34] come together when god in man was made
[9:36] one and that great memorial day when
[9:38] john baptized jesus praise god
[9:42] so we're once again we're talking about
[9:44] lamb we've got to have a lamb-like
[9:46] spirit if you want to serve god to the
[9:48] fullness
[9:49] of the potential he wants you to you got
[9:51] to make sure daily that you have a
[9:52] lamb-like spirit and a lamb
[9:55] knows that has rights but is willing to
[9:57] lay down every right to be shared by the
[9:59] master shepherd that's what we that's
[10:02] the decision and question we come with
[10:03] each day we wake up every morning
[10:05] whether we want to do our will or god's
[10:07] will as it's no switzerland's no down
[10:09] the middle it's either god's will or
[10:11] your will and and god is looking for a
[10:14] full surrender believer
[10:15] to give him full control of his vessel
[10:18] now he's a he's a gentleman as it says
[10:21] in revelations 3 he's knocking at the
[10:23] door of each heart right now he is at
[10:25] the each heart right now he's waiting
[10:27] for you to open that door he's not going
[10:29] to blow the door open dynamite he's not
[10:30] going to kick it down but he's waiting
[10:32] for you to let him in he wants to have
[10:34] communion with you but you have to
[10:36] initiate that first draw nigh to god and
[10:39] he'll draw an eye to you that's a
[10:40] promise in the word that each one of us
[10:42] can have
[10:43] praise god
[10:44] now the lamb is a very gentle little
[10:46] fellow he doesn't he can't help himself
[10:48] he isn't self-reliant because he can't
[10:51] help himself here's some time ago i was
[10:53] going through a pastor when i used to
[10:54] patrol and i found a little lamb and all
[10:56] of them had gotten away from him somehow
[10:58] and he was all wound up a little bunch
[11:00] of barbed wire and the poor little fella
[11:02] was laying there and bleeding
[11:04] and i come by and and i seen way up
[11:06] about half a mile up was a whole herd of
[11:08] sheep now he laid right there and the
[11:10] crows would have been picking in his
[11:11] eyes pretty soon if we hadn't gotten him
[11:14] out but i wanted a little fellow up
[11:15] picked him up in my arms he never
[11:18] refused notice that he laid real quiet i
[11:20] picked him up in my arms first time
[11:22] perhaps a human being ever had their
[11:24] hands on him but he was gentle
[11:26] he was willing to be led and i noticed
[11:29] that that's what we had to be gentle we
[11:31] had to be willing to be led
[11:33] he was willing to be helped
[11:35] see god wants to help your current
[11:37] situation but you have to let them help
[11:40] you
[11:41] that's what he's waiting for
[11:43] amen he was willing to be led so he was
[11:46] not willing to try to resist or kick
[11:48] back or bite
[11:49] lambs a true lamb doesn't kick back
[11:51] he doesn't he doesn't complain
[11:54] he just
[11:54] lets the master shepherd work in his
[11:56] life
[11:58] so
[11:59] he humbled themselves that's the key we
[12:00] must humble ourselves under his mighty
[12:02] hand
[12:03] i picked him up packed him up and set
[12:05] him down the rest of the sheep in a few
[12:06] minutes his mammy found him how happy he
[12:08] was now typical that is of the lamb of
[12:11] god now jesus
[12:13] he lived a purposeful life he had a plan
[12:16] he had a purpose from the father and
[12:19] each one of us has that we're supposed
[12:21] to be disliked him in his example and
[12:23] with to make sure that we're have a
[12:25] purposeful life every day
[12:27] set goals
[12:28] aspirations these things we're going to
[12:30] get into a little bit later in the
[12:31] service
[12:32] so you want to turn me to john 10
[12:35] and we'll read verses 1 through eighteen
[12:41] amen
[12:43] so reverse one
[12:44] verily verily i say unto you he that
[12:48] enterth in not by the door into the
[12:50] sheepfold but climeth up some other way
[12:52] the same as a thief and a robber
[12:55] but he that entereth in by the door is
[12:57] the shepherd of the sheep to him the
[13:00] porter openeth and the sheep hear his
[13:02] voice and he calleth his own sheep by
[13:04] name and leadeth them out
[13:06] and when he put forth his own sheep he
[13:08] goes before them and the sheep follow
[13:10] him for they know his voice
[13:13] now the thing is we got to know the
[13:14] voice of god for our life
[13:17] the same voice for sister trisha is not
[13:19] going to necessarily be the same voice
[13:20] for me it's a customized relationship
[13:23] god speaks to us in certain ways that he
[13:25] wouldn't speak to brother jonathan as he
[13:27] looked to me god speaks in different
[13:29] ways you have to make sure you get still
[13:32] so you can get tuned in to that holy
[13:34] ghost frequency so you can hear his
[13:36] voice
[13:37] that's what's going to lead you and
[13:38] guide you into knowledge he sent the
[13:39] holy spirit to what to lead you and
[13:41] guide you into all truth and there's
[13:43] certain things he can't say to you yet
[13:45] because you can't bear them yet so the
[13:47] thing is your walk with god is a
[13:50] progress it may be baby steps maybe
[13:52] large leaps at times but the thing is we
[13:54] got to make sure we're moving forward
[13:57] don't just be moving and moving make
[13:58] sure you're moving forward in the right
[13:59] direction ask god check your motive
[14:02] motive is so key with your walk with god
[14:05] because a lot of times we think we have
[14:06] a pure motive
[14:08] but in reality we have a mixed motive
[14:09] that's why david said search my heart
[14:11] and try me see there's anything wicked
[14:14] in me and that's just the honesty god
[14:16] loves honesty you can't hide anything
[14:18] from him there's nothing you can hide
[14:20] there's nothing that's you could hide
[14:21] under a rug or in a closet like like
[14:23] your room but the thing is the more open
[14:25] and eyes you can be that's when the lord
[14:27] can deal with your heart he wants to
[14:29] deal with your heart but you have to be
[14:30] honest with him
[14:32] in a stranger they would not follow but
[14:34] will flee for him for they know not the
[14:36] voice of a stranger so that's why it's
[14:38] so important to make sure you're hearing
[14:40] the voice of god
[14:43] this parable spake jesus unto them but
[14:45] they understood not what things were
[14:47] which he spake unto them then said jesus
[14:50] unto unto them again verily verily i say
[14:53] unto you i am the door of the sheep so
[14:55] notice he he says in his word i am the
[14:57] way
[14:58] i am the door
[15:00] and there's only one way you can enter
[15:02] in and god's provided way is through
[15:04] jesus christ
[15:06] and if you don't enter in that way
[15:08] then you're a thief and a robber this is
[15:10] point blank like this like i'm not
[15:12] trying to be me but it's point blank
[15:13] like that you got to make sure you're
[15:14] entering in by the provided way his the
[15:17] blood that was shed on calvary made a
[15:20] way
[15:21] for you to have a personal intimate walk
[15:24] with him each one of you god is not
[15:25] respecter of persons
[15:27] you the thing is you have to realize and
[15:29] recognize that blood is was shed for you
[15:32] that he when he rose and resurrected
[15:35] that made it
[15:36] possible for the holy spirit to come
[15:38] back upon the believer
[15:40] amen praise god
[15:42] all that ever came before me are thieves
[15:44] and robbers but the sheep did not hear
[15:46] them
[15:48] i am the door he says i am the door by
[15:50] me if any man enter and he shall be
[15:53] saved so once again he's not a respecter
[15:56] of persons
[15:57] but you have to go you can't go through
[15:58] the cellar you can't go through the side
[16:01] door
[16:02] but you have to go through that that one
[16:04] and only door jesus christ
[16:06] he shall be saved so the thing is if you
[16:08] truly go through that door
[16:10] then you shall be saved
[16:12] but if you don't if you're questioning
[16:14] what door you're going through then you
[16:15] want to make sure every man has to with
[16:17] fear and trembling with their salvation
[16:20] so the thief cometh not but for to steal
[16:23] and to kill and to destroy i love this
[16:24] part right here i am come that they
[16:26] might have life
[16:28] they might have it more abundantly he
[16:30] wants to give you life tonight he wants
[16:32] to restore you from the inside out he
[16:34] wants to give you uh he wants you to
[16:36] serve him in the newness of the spirit
[16:39] so the thing is his mercies are new each
[16:41] day
[16:42] the thing is i think sometimes we get so
[16:44] caught up in a routine in a rut that we
[16:47] we miss the newness
[16:49] because because just jesus christ the
[16:51] same yesterday today and forever as
[16:53] jesus was speaking at this very time in
[16:55] this moment to the disciples and the
[16:57] fairies and sadducees he's still the
[16:58] same jesus christ
[17:00] only things different is 20 22.
[17:03] so god is still trying to speak to each
[17:04] one of us tonight
[17:06] but the thing is you have to want it
[17:08] more than life itself you have to get
[17:10] desperate to hear from them the thing is
[17:12] nobody no nobody should force you have
[17:15] to get desperate to hear from god you
[17:17] should want to get desperate to hear
[17:18] from god so he can use you
[17:20] because the more he can use you the more
[17:22] you're going to be able to help the
[17:24] kingdom of god grow the more you can
[17:25] reach lost souls because each one of us
[17:28] were once lost souls and god sent
[17:30] somebody your away
[17:32] and we it should be an honor privilege
[17:34] to be used
[17:36] to win a lost soul to the kingdom of god
[17:39] all
[17:40] one sinner repenteth all of heaven
[17:42] rejoices remember that
[17:45] says i am i'm gonna read again i am come
[17:48] that they might have life they might
[17:49] have it more abundantly i am the good
[17:52] shepherd he is
[17:53] the good shepherd giveth his life for
[17:55] the sheep he was willing to as brother
[17:57] alex preached on sunday he was homeless
[18:00] he was made homeless for you he
[18:02] literally left his place in heaven to
[18:05] come as a man
[18:07] to win you over he became you that you
[18:09] might become him so think about that he
[18:11] forsaken everything that he could win
[18:14] you that he could come and redeem you if
[18:17] he didn't do that we would you and i
[18:18] wouldn't be here today so i count that
[18:21] as that's what love is god is love
[18:23] that's what true love is even on the
[18:25] cross bearing all that grief and all
[18:27] that pain and all the sins of the world
[18:29] he said father forgive them they know
[18:31] not what they do that's true love
[18:34] human love can only go so far but that
[18:36] was the love of god in action right
[18:38] there
[18:39] amen
[18:40] but he that isn't heraling and not the
[18:42] shepherd whose own the sheep or not see
[18:44] it the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep
[18:46] and fleeth and wolf catches them and
[18:48] scattereth the sheep
[18:50] the heralding fleeth because he is a
[18:52] herling and careth not for the sheep he
[18:53] says i am the good shepherd and know my
[18:56] sheep and am known of mine so god knows
[18:58] your every weakness
[19:00] he knows your strengths he knows
[19:02] everything about you he knows you better
[19:04] than your wife does he knows you better
[19:06] than your best friend knows you
[19:08] he even knows the very numbers of the
[19:10] hairs on your head think about that just
[19:12] think about that i couldn't even imagine
[19:14] to begin what number of hairs i got on
[19:15] my head i couldn't even imagine
[19:17] as the father knoweth me even so i know
[19:20] the father and i lay down my life for
[19:22] the sheep and other sheep i have which
[19:25] are now this fold i love it we weren't
[19:26] all that full
[19:28] he came to get us to bring us into that
[19:30] fold because once again this god is it's
[19:33] a one-fold it's not many folds but it's
[19:35] one fold the body of christ this one
[19:37] body
[19:40] therefore does my father love me because
[19:42] i laid down my life that i might take it
[19:44] again
[19:45] no man taking it from me but i lay down
[19:48] of myself i have power to lay it down
[19:50] and i have power to take it again this
[19:51] commandment have received in my father
[19:53] notice each day we awake
[19:56] we have the choice to either to lay our
[19:57] life down or not to lay our life down we
[19:59] have that same choice right there
[20:02] and that's what god is looking at and
[20:03] seeing if you really mean business so on
[20:06] each day you have the choice to dial to
[20:08] your own will
[20:09] you have a choice to lay down your life
[20:10] to help the kingdom of god see if you
[20:12] lay down your will
[20:14] you have an opportunity to help the
[20:16] kingdom of god when the honor and
[20:17] privilege that is
[20:20] uh so let's go see the thing is to be
[20:22] about the father's business in luke 249
[20:25] jesus speaking he says
[20:28] i love this he says
[20:31] luke 249
[20:33] and he said unto them how is it that you
[20:35] sought me was he not that i must be
[20:37] about the father's business now jesus
[20:40] christ was always about the father's
[20:42] business he didn't make excuses when he
[20:45] was sick he didn't make excuses when he
[20:47] was paying he didn't make excuses when
[20:48] he was busy he always put the father
[20:52] first
[20:53] and we need to be putting god first
[20:55] daily in our lives not just uh at the
[20:58] first part in the morning but all
[21:00] throughout the day 24 hours a day yes i
[21:02] understand we we're busy when we have
[21:04] lives but the thing is if we put god
[21:06] first then everything is going to fall
[21:08] in place
[21:09] that's how that's how god set it up to
[21:11] be but seek ye first the kingdom of god
[21:15] and his righteousness and all these
[21:16] things shall be added to you so he knows
[21:18] you need money to pay the bills he knows
[21:20] you need health he knows you need a car
[21:23] he knows you need gas in your car money
[21:25] to pay the light bill he knows all these
[21:27] things so he said but seek ye first
[21:30] everything is going to be even a sparrow
[21:32] doesn't fall without him knowing think
[21:33] about that right i think so nothing's
[21:35] surprised let's go to matthew 6 actually
[21:37] what was into my notes but that's okay
[21:40] so go to matthew 6
[21:43] and we'll start with verse
[21:46] 25 therefore i say unto you take no
[21:49] thought for your life what you shall eat
[21:51] or what you shall drink nor yet for your
[21:53] bodies
[21:54] what shall you put on it's not the life
[21:56] more than the meat and the body than
[21:57] remnant behold the fowls of the air for
[22:00] they so not neither they reap nor gather
[22:03] into barns yet your heavenly father
[22:06] feedeth them think about that are ye are
[22:08] you not much better than me which of you
[22:10] by taking thought can add one cupid unto
[22:13] his stature
[22:14] and why take ye thought for the remnant
[22:16] consider the lilies of the field how
[22:18] they grow they toil not neither do they
[22:20] spin
[22:22] and yet i say unto you that even solomon
[22:24] in all of his glory was not arrayed like
[22:26] one of these
[22:27] wherefore if god so clothed the grass of
[22:29] the field which today is and tomorrow
[22:32] is cast into the oven shall he not so
[22:34] much more clothe you a little faith
[22:36] therefore take no thoughts saying what
[22:38] you shall eat always drink or that you
[22:40] shall be clothed for after all these
[22:41] things the gentiles seek for your
[22:43] heavenly father knoweth that you have
[22:46] need of all these things he knows it but
[22:48] seek ye first the kingdom of god and his
[22:49] righteousness and all these things shall
[22:51] be added unto you take therefore no
[22:53] thought for the morrow for the morrow
[22:55] shall take thought for the things of
[22:57] itself sufficient today is the evil
[22:59] thereof amen
[23:02] amen
[23:04] yeah get situated real quick
[23:06] notes
[23:09] praise god
[23:11] so the thing is
[23:13] each day you have a chance to have a
[23:14] victorious day
[23:16] no matter how hard the enemy is pressing
[23:19] on you no matter
[23:20] your blew a flat tire
[23:23] whatever it is you still have a chance
[23:25] of a victorious day
[23:26] only way you can have a victoria's day
[23:28] is to die out to your flesh that's the
[23:30] key right there even jesus told us
[23:32] before you even pick up your cross you
[23:33] have to deny yourself first see a lamb
[23:37] a lamb is always willing to die out
[23:40] always no matter the circumstance and to
[23:43] forfeit their rights to the good
[23:44] shepherd remember you have to make that
[23:47] choice no one can force you to make it
[23:50] you have to the thing is having a lamb
[23:51] spirit isn't something you just put on
[23:53] like a coat
[23:54] it's something that you have to strive
[23:56] for you to labor for
[23:58] because the thing is satan is trying to
[24:00] get you anyway to be a wolf
[24:02] he he any way he can get you not to have
[24:04] a lamb spirit he's one he's one over you
[24:07] but the thing is when we can have that
[24:09] lamb spirit
[24:10] i don't care what goliath is in your
[24:12] life you can conquer amen
[24:14] so each day you have a choice to be a
[24:15] lamb so think about that each day you
[24:17] have a choice to be in land if you want
[24:19] god to come and do mighty things and
[24:21] deal with the hearts and deliver us and
[24:23] heal us we have to have lamb spirits we
[24:26] have to
[24:27] what does a lamb do it submits itself to
[24:30] the shepherd and we must submit
[24:32] ourselves to the master shepherd daily
[24:35] jesus was always in unity with the
[24:37] father guess what he had to do he had to
[24:39] strive to keep a unity it wasn't
[24:42] something that just happened magically
[24:44] but something that he he's in prayer
[24:46] constantly he was looking to see what
[24:48] the father wanted him to do same thing
[24:50] that we have to do you've constantly be
[24:53] seeking and saying lord
[24:55] what direction you want me to go
[24:57] how can i be a light to this brother to
[24:59] the sister to the stranger i don't even
[25:01] know
[25:02] see we must do the same thing we have to
[25:04] fight to keep unity with jesus
[25:06] fight to keep the lamb spirit it won't
[25:09] be handed to you you must suffer
[25:11] by dying out to your own will that's the
[25:13] suffering we see things your carnal
[25:15] flesh does not want to serve jesus and
[25:18] if it does it wants to give the bare
[25:19] minimum at best
[25:21] but the thing is god's standards are up
[25:23] here and sometimes we hold our standards
[25:25] here with her realize he says my ways
[25:27] are not your ways my thoughts are not
[25:28] your thoughts so sometimes we think that
[25:30] we're always thinking like god but once
[25:33] again we gotta check and to see if we
[25:35] are because his word declares that his
[25:37] thoughts are not like our or his
[25:38] thoughts are not my thoughts
[25:41] so just in the previous this chapter is
[25:43] the quarterback we find one place there
[25:45] where the son of god spent so much time
[25:47] in prayer think about that the son of
[25:49] god spent so much time in prayer
[25:52] and if jesus had to spend much time in
[25:54] prayer to stay in fellowship with the
[25:55] spirit that was in him how much more do
[25:58] you and i have to spend in prayer
[26:02] if you only knew what time and prayer
[26:03] meant what sometimes when you're in
[26:05] prayer god changes the complete
[26:07] destination of different things are
[26:09] going to be one more time god changed
[26:12] the complete destination of different
[26:14] things that's going to happen do you
[26:16] believe that amen might be some fiction
[26:18] happening your prayer can change the
[26:20] whole situation i want to tell you the
[26:22] power of prayer a true sincere prayer
[26:25] offered to god is stronger than any
[26:27] atomic bomb think about that
[26:30] think about you have direct connection
[26:31] with the throne room of god
[26:34] praise god think about that when jesus
[26:36] christ died upon the cross he gave you
[26:39] that as a gift
[26:41] how much more you should be using that
[26:43] daily
[26:44] i think prayer is a weapon we don't
[26:46] utilize
[26:48] it's stronger than any atomic bomb any
[26:50] sword any uh smart bullet you name it
[26:53] it's stronger than anything
[26:56] praise god
[26:58] praise god
[27:00] so there's only one way to enter in and
[27:02] that's through jesus christ
[27:05] and that requires what a full submission
[27:08] daily
[27:09] submission to the word of god god is
[27:12] order one you can't separate in the
[27:14] beginning was the word words with god
[27:15] and the word was god so the word and god
[27:18] are one you can't separate the two
[27:20] you've got to have both because they're
[27:22] they're in unity
[27:24] god is his word
[27:25] the thing is how can we hear his voice
[27:27] if we see the thing is we get so busy in
[27:29] this world
[27:30] we get busy we have a job we have kids i
[27:33] don't have kids but
[27:35] but you know your kids and everything
[27:38] but the thing is
[27:39] the more we can get still we can hear
[27:41] his voice if you're moving a million
[27:42] miles an hour how can god ever speak to
[27:45] you he's always trying to speak
[27:47] but we have to get in that channel
[27:49] so we can hear him
[27:51] and god understands you have a busy
[27:53] schedule he understands you have
[27:54] children he understands you have a job
[27:56] but the thing is he still wants to be
[27:58] put first anything put before god is an
[28:02] idol
[28:03] it could be your car it could be your
[28:04] kid even jesus said i i came to he said
[28:08] i came to
[28:10] he he said i i came to bradford let me
[28:12] i'm trying to think of this anyways he
[28:14] said i came to bring separation pretty
[28:16] much and a man against his wife and you
[28:18] know brother and everything
[28:20] he knows that family
[28:22] can be put before him so he's trying to
[28:24] he's trying to put family in a proper
[28:25] place
[28:27] see it should be god family than you has
[28:30] a proper place if you put god before
[28:32] those things then they won't become an
[28:34] idol because it's so easy to put
[28:36] something before god
[28:38] it's really easy i've been guilty of i'm
[28:40] pretty sure we all been guilty of it in
[28:41] some time in some shape or form
[28:43] so
[28:44] thing is
[28:46] lambs
[28:47] lambs don't complain
[28:49] a true lamb doesn't complain think about
[28:51] this jesus submitted to the father he
[28:53] was a perfect example return to john 5
[28:55] 19.
[29:00] john 5 19
[29:05] so it reads then answer jesus unto them
[29:08] verily verily i say unto you the son can
[29:11] do nothing of himself but what he seeth
[29:14] the father do whatsoever things he'd do
[29:17] with these also the son likewise
[29:19] see they didn't notice in the men's
[29:21] meeting uh that that scripture was
[29:23] brought up in the notes i didn't say
[29:24] anything but it just really shows you
[29:26] just how how god works on both ends such
[29:29] a beauty to see those little golden
[29:30] nuggets this you know in the men's
[29:32] meeting and you know just people mention
[29:34] it some other things that was said that
[29:36] i will get into it later in this little
[29:38] service
[29:39] so lambs don't make excuses see the
[29:42] thing is we get so caught up on making
[29:43] excuses well i couldn't do it because i
[29:46] couldn't give more time to prayer
[29:47] because i i
[29:48] god isn't looking at your excuses god
[29:50] doesn't want to hear excuses
[29:52] the thing is if you if you make that
[29:53] excuse
[29:55] learn from the excuse don't make it
[29:56] again
[29:57] say lord i'm giving you time no matter
[29:58] what if i have to lose sleep for it
[30:01] i'm giving you time lord if i have to
[30:02] cut something out i'm giving you time
[30:04] lord and that's what's going to touch
[30:06] the heart of god see the thing is it the
[30:08] obedience is better than sacrifice in a
[30:10] sense
[30:11] you see the thing is i think a lot of
[30:13] times when god is calling us to be
[30:15] obedient to something we try to make it
[30:17] up by doing things for sacrifice well i
[30:19] just get the church you know i'll just
[30:20] well i made it or oh i'm gonna do this
[30:23] instead to cover it up thing is don't
[30:25] try to cover things up when god is
[30:26] trying to see if god's calling you to do
[30:28] something
[30:29] you can't just try to cover it up with
[30:30] good deeds that's what i'm trying to say
[30:32] a lot of times we try to cover we try to
[30:34] cover things up with good deeds thinking
[30:35] that uh you know it'll make it go away
[30:38] but no if god has called you to do
[30:40] something be obedient to it
[30:42] the thing is sacrificing your time for
[30:44] god is always in order i believe
[30:47] i believe it's always an order
[30:49] for prayer
[30:50] to get the service early and to pray
[30:52] that's something we should be doing
[30:53] getting the service 30 minutes early and
[30:54] just just praying for the service
[30:56] praying for one another
[30:57] see the thing is the more
[30:59] we can get in tune in unity with god the
[31:02] more his spirit can move see thing is
[31:04] that's what god's looking for is to we
[31:06] got to strive to keep that unity
[31:08] once again it's not going to be handed
[31:09] to us something that we all have to
[31:10] strive one in each one of us is an
[31:12] individual affair we have to strive for
[31:14] that unity don't expect brother ron to
[31:16] bring it or brother jonathan to bring it
[31:18] but you be the person that bring it you
[31:20] bring the lord here
[31:22] you know you bring the lord to his house
[31:24] amen
[31:26] the thing is uh we must don't make
[31:28] excuse they just submit to the master
[31:30] shepherd they count counted an honor to
[31:32] suffer for the gospel
[31:33] amen they're willing to submit their
[31:35] rights no matter how fair they think it
[31:37] is see things we have rights in this
[31:38] world right
[31:40] we all have american privileges american
[31:41] rights but if those rights go against
[31:44] the word of god i don't want him
[31:46] i'll be straight up with you i don't
[31:47] want him lord share all my rights away
[31:50] in this world of sin
[31:52] let's go to philippians 2.
[31:56] philippians 2 and we'll start with verse
[31:59] one through eight
[32:03] amen
[32:05] praise god
[32:07] so philippians two verse one says
[32:09] there be
[32:10] therefore any consolation in christ if
[32:13] any comfort of love if any fellowship of
[32:15] the spirit if any bowels and mercies
[32:18] fulfill ye my joy that ye be like
[32:21] minded having the same love being of one
[32:24] accord of one mind notice
[32:26] unity
[32:28] let nothing be done through strife or
[32:30] vainglory but in lowliness of mind let
[32:32] each esteem
[32:34] other better than themselves edify one
[32:36] another
[32:38] look not every man and his own things
[32:40] but every man also in the things of
[32:42] others
[32:42] verse 5 is key right here let this mind
[32:45] be in you which is also in christ jesus
[32:47] see the thing is this mind isn't going
[32:49] to be gifted to you in a bow and a
[32:51] ribbon
[32:52] you have to strive and fight for it you
[32:54] have to strive for the mind of christ
[32:57] whatever see the thing is there's
[32:58] thoughts in your mind there throughout
[33:00] the course of the day devil's trying to
[33:02] speak to him god's gonna speak to you
[33:04] and you have to be able to try those
[33:06] spirits and see if they're of god of
[33:08] satan don't just let any old kind of
[33:10] thoughts go into your mind to think well
[33:12] that's god it might be god no the thing
[33:14] is if you have that kind of attitude
[33:16] you're going to have a devil's
[33:16] playground in your mind you have to take
[33:19] control of the things that go into your
[33:21] mind
[33:22] you have the choice whether you want to
[33:23] ponder
[33:25] or take that thought
[33:26] further than it has to go so the thing
[33:28] is your mind has to be set in order
[33:31] you have to make sure you're you're
[33:33] feeding on the right things you're
[33:34] thinking the right things so yeah
[33:36] attitude is so important when serving
[33:38] god it's so it's really so important and
[33:41] we got to make sure our mind is under
[33:42] control you want to make sure that that
[33:45] mind let this mind be in you which is
[33:47] also in christ in christ jesus who being
[33:50] in the form of god thought in that
[33:51] robbery to be equal to god but made
[33:53] himself of no reputation not even the
[33:55] very son of god
[33:57] was trying to make a reputation
[33:59] but who who are we to try to make a
[34:00] reputation
[34:02] the thing is
[34:04] god we're not gonna be like for every
[34:06] person and if we are i think even jesus
[34:08] said whoa onto them you know who who who
[34:11] pretty much are you know
[34:12] pretty much saying all these good things
[34:14] about you all the time
[34:16] so the thing is but made himself no
[34:17] reputation and took upon him the form of
[34:20] a servant that's the key right there
[34:22] we have to be we're we're called to be
[34:24] servants
[34:25] if jesus christ the very
[34:27] god of heaven was made a servant
[34:31] then who are we not to be servants like
[34:33] him he was willing to wash his disciples
[34:36] feet
[34:37] he was willing to wash feet and we have
[34:39] to be willing to wash feet i'm not
[34:40] saying we gotta you know go out just
[34:42] wash them around this person's feet
[34:44] but the thing is
[34:45] being a servant you see that person and
[34:48] realize that they need jesus christ
[34:50] and you might be the only person that
[34:52] can bring jesus christ to him even paul
[34:54] said we're living epistles that person
[34:56] may never read a bible it might be the
[34:58] only bible they ever read
[35:00] i count that in honor of privilege of
[35:02] the lord will when he used me for that
[35:06] and being us keep going but made himself
[35:08] of no reputation and took upon him the
[35:10] form of a servant and was made in the
[35:12] likeness of men and being found in
[35:15] fashion as a man he humbled himself
[35:18] so we have to humble ourselves as well
[35:20] it became obedient unto death even the
[35:22] death of the cross i'm reading these
[35:24] scriptures and just show me that
[35:26] the lamb of god he was a lamb he was
[35:28] represented as a lamb for a reason and
[35:30] we have to make sure
[35:32] our life that we're lambs don't just
[35:35] think you're a lamb or assume you are
[35:36] but make sure
[35:38] that you're having that lame spirit
[35:40] daily
[35:41] let's go isaiah 53 verse 7.
[35:49] so it says he was oppressed and he was
[35:51] afflicted yet he opened not his mouth
[35:55] he's brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[35:57] as a sheep before her shears is dumb
[36:00] so be opening out his mouth now notice
[36:02] when he was being judged by piloting
[36:04] them he never complained about the
[36:06] situation
[36:08] he never cried about it
[36:10] you know
[36:11] he was he was willing to be a lamb
[36:14] he knew that this was the perfect will
[36:16] of god so he was willing to do this for
[36:19] you and i
[36:20] if he didn't do that
[36:21] we couldn't be here today sitting in
[36:23] these nice seats this nice building it's
[36:26] all about his grace and mercy that we're
[36:27] even here today
[36:29] praise god
[36:31] let's go to romans chapter eight
[36:39] and go to verse 35 through 39.
[36:42] open pastor
[36:43] so it says
[36:45] who shall separate us from the love of
[36:47] christ who
[36:49] shall separate us from the love of
[36:50] christ shall tribulation
[36:53] or distress or persecution or famine or
[36:57] nakedness or perel or sword
[36:59] and is written for thy sake we are
[37:01] killed all the day long we are counted
[37:04] as sheep for the slaughter remember we
[37:07] are sheep in this pasture
[37:10] nay in all these things
[37:12] we are more than conquerors through him
[37:13] that loved us
[37:15] from persuaded neither death
[37:17] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[37:20] nor powers nor things present nor things
[37:22] that come nor height nor depth nor any
[37:26] other creature shall be able to separate
[37:27] us from the love of god which is in
[37:29] christ jesus our lord so we should let
[37:31] nothing come between our walk with god
[37:34] the scriptures telling me
[37:36] not not height not depth principalities
[37:39] there's nothing that should come in your
[37:41] in your way of the walk with your god
[37:42] nothing
[37:43] because things were innate all these
[37:45] things were made more than conquerors
[37:47] through him that loved us that blood
[37:50] has made you an overcomer
[37:52] that blood was not shed you couldn't
[37:54] become an overcomer
[37:56] that blood wasn't shed
[37:58] we couldn't be cleansed of all our sins
[38:00] behold the lamb of god taken the sins
[38:02] the way of all the world
[38:05] so the thing is
[38:07] lambs are willing to lay down their life
[38:09] for their brothers and sisters no matter
[38:11] the no matter if they're humiliated no
[38:13] matter made fun of they're willing to
[38:15] lay their life down
[38:17] jesus christ he was humiliated he was
[38:19] spitting on he was hit in the head he
[38:21] was called beelzebub
[38:23] for your sake for my sake he didn't care
[38:26] what it took but he was willing he even
[38:28] counted that he knew what the cost would
[38:30] would be and he still wanted to do it
[38:33] that's love right there i want that kind
[38:34] of love in my life i want more of that
[38:36] love daily in my life just radiating out
[38:38] of me
[38:40] let's go to uh turn with me to first
[38:42] corinthians 6 19.
[38:46] so then also what lamb is willing to do
[38:48] is to lay their life down for a lost
[38:50] soul
[38:51] they realize that one lost soul was
[38:53] worth more than ten thousand worlds
[38:56] they realized their life isn't what they
[38:58] also realized their life is not their
[38:59] own i wasn't put on here to live my own
[39:02] life out here in the left field
[39:04] but the thing is when you realize that
[39:06] this life is to be lived for the master
[39:09] then you'll have a truth you'll be
[39:11] living life to the fullest people say oh
[39:12] this is living life to the fullest or
[39:14] this is living life to the fullest going
[39:15] out and partying and drinking and
[39:16] smoking all this stuff living life to
[39:18] the fullest is recognizing
[39:21] who your father is
[39:22] that's living life to fosters until then
[39:25] you're just wandering around aimlessly
[39:28] let me get there first corinthians 6
[39:31] verse 19 through 20.
[39:34] what know ye not that your body is a
[39:36] temple of the holy ghost which is in you
[39:39] which ye have of god and you are not
[39:41] your own read one more time
[39:43] what know ye not that your body is a
[39:45] temple of the holy ghost which is in you
[39:48] which he have of god
[39:50] and your ye are not your own for you are
[39:52] bought with a price remember that
[39:54] therefore glorify god in your body and
[39:56] in your spirit which are god's so this
[39:58] body
[40:00] god is loaning out to you
[40:02] he i guess he says he's written it out
[40:04] to you in a way
[40:05] and we're going to be responsible the
[40:07] things that we've done to this body and
[40:09] body in our spirit
[40:11] so the thing is the quicker like i said
[40:13] quicker we can realize that
[40:15] you are not your own we're bought with a
[40:16] price
[40:18] that's when the lord can do mighty
[40:19] things in your life he can change your
[40:21] nature he wants to change your nature he
[40:23] wants to give you peace he wants to give
[40:25] you joy he wants to give you all these
[40:27] things his promise in his word but you
[40:29] have to recognize
[40:31] that you have to give your life to him
[40:34] and he'll even bless you if you're not
[40:35] serving them he blesses the just and
[40:36] unjust but i don't want i don't just
[40:38] want uh material blessings i want
[40:41] spiritual blessings i want my nature to
[40:42] change
[40:43] i want to be made more into his image
[40:46] i want to go through these trials
[40:47] they're going to shape me and mold me so
[40:49] he can see more of himself in me that's
[40:51] what i want in my life because the more
[40:53] we can suffer for the kingdom's sake
[40:56] we have an opportunity to win a soul
[41:00] so count it a joy to suffer glory in
[41:03] your infirmities glory in your
[41:04] tribulations like paul said because
[41:06] i remember paul or jesus said to paul my
[41:09] grace is sufficient remember that his
[41:12] grace is sufficient
[41:14] don't forget that
[41:15] let's go to first corinthians 15 31.
[41:20] so it says
[41:21] i protest by your rejoicings which i
[41:23] have in christ jesus our lord i die
[41:26] daily so paul was paul even said i die
[41:29] daily and we consider paul a a patriarch
[41:33] and
[41:33] he had to still die daily
[41:36] so where are we at
[41:39] so and if you want to be a christian
[41:41] you've got to be a lamb and if you're
[41:43] going to be a lamb you've got to get
[41:44] away from your own thoughts just let the
[41:48] holy spirit do the leading read one more
[41:50] time and if you want to be a christian
[41:52] you've got to be a lamb if you're going
[41:55] to be a lamb you've got to get away from
[41:57] your own thoughts
[41:58] just let the holy spirit do the leading
[42:00] certainly
[42:01] i think the problem is we like to mix
[42:04] our own thinking of what we think a lamb
[42:05] is
[42:06] and jesus taught us what a true lamb
[42:08] does
[42:09] thing is you can't mix your thoughts and
[42:11] god's thoughts together
[42:13] the word and your thoughts don't mix the
[42:14] word is when you do that you make the
[42:16] word
[42:17] uh
[42:18] you hinder the word
[42:20] you make the word lie see the word is
[42:22] unadulterated it's pure it's holy it's
[42:25] perfect
[42:26] no no no word will turn void it can't
[42:28] because it's the word of god
[42:30] god and his word are one like we said
[42:32] before the thing is don't try to mix
[42:34] don't try to pick and choose what
[42:35] scriptures best fit you or what you
[42:37] don't like i don't like but just take
[42:39] all the word rake it all in
[42:41] say lord i may not understand this but i
[42:43] believe with all my heart
[42:45] that that attitude right there will
[42:47] touch the heart of god than trying to
[42:48] pick and choose what you think fits with
[42:50] it this and that
[42:52] so what we need today is to submit all
[42:54] our rights
[42:55] to let go let lay
[42:58] let go lay down and let god shave all
[43:01] your rights off you amen could you
[43:03] imagine how this little lamb all the
[43:04] fleece hang over him that's his rights
[43:06] yeah
[43:08] burned up and they just lay up the
[43:09] sharing table they know what's best for
[43:11] him take all of his rights away
[43:13] him and sheer all off how cool and light
[43:16] he runs my my he's happy jumps around
[43:19] has a big time
[43:20] yes sir if you'll forfeit your rights
[43:22] that's what you'll get
[43:24] but you gotta forfeit your rights and
[43:26] let the word of god shave all the word
[43:28] off of you take all the habits of the
[43:30] world and you become a new creature in
[43:32] christ you got to let the word of god
[43:34] shave all your rights away all your
[43:36] rights shave everything away
[43:38] you know when moses when moses was
[43:40] trying to deliver the children of israel
[43:42] he thought he could do it his way
[43:44] but it took 40 years for god to beat out
[43:47] him to shave all the world out of all
[43:49] the egyptian intellects and five minutes
[43:51] in the presence of god did all did
[43:55] way more than he had four years of
[43:56] teaching let's think about that five
[43:58] minutes in the presence of god if we can
[44:00] spend five minutes in the presence of
[44:03] god it'll do more than all the news you
[44:05] can watch
[44:06] all the
[44:07] history you can learn all the you know
[44:09] you fill in the blank what you can learn
[44:11] just five minutes can transform you
[44:14] more than 40 years of school teaching
[44:16] just think about that
[44:18] amen
[44:19] thing is don't just say well i'll lose
[44:21] these bad habits someday no this is the
[44:23] day say today is a day for deliverance
[44:26] say lord i'm serious about overcoming
[44:28] this habit say lord you're still a
[44:30] deliverer
[44:31] think about this when he died upon a
[44:33] cross and rose again
[44:35] for your deliverance for your healing
[44:37] for your salvation all those things all
[44:40] those things in one package think one
[44:42] package deal
[44:44] say
[44:45] be serious about overcoming this habit
[44:47] say lord your deliver in hebrews 13 8 it
[44:50] says jesus christ the same yesterday
[44:52] today and forever he's the same god he's
[44:55] the same guy that gave you deliverance
[44:57] ten years ago five years ago he's the
[44:59] same god that picks you about their
[45:01] murray clay and set your feet in a rock
[45:03] to the state he's the same powerful god
[45:05] jesus christ said all power is given to
[45:08] me in heaven and in earth so there's no
[45:10] goliath that should be staying in your
[45:12] land like we preached last time there's
[45:14] no
[45:15] giant that should be
[45:17] causing you to cower like saul and then
[45:19] when they were cowering
[45:21] david was willing to take the word of
[45:23] god take his sling and knew that the
[45:25] same guy delivered him off the mouth of
[45:26] the lion and the bear he delivered him
[45:28] out this uncircumcised philistine don't
[45:30] let any uncircumcised philistine dwell
[45:33] in the land that god is giving you don't
[45:35] be like the the other 10 spies and say
[45:37] oh we're grasshoppers no
[45:40] you're you're a son and daughter of god
[45:42] he's giving you authority thing is if
[45:44] you want deliverance in your life say be
[45:46] serious about it show the lord that you
[45:48] mean business
[45:50] that's what a lamb does say lord i am
[45:53] taking that your word i am your lamb
[45:54] share all my rights away shave me clean
[45:57] from this world
[45:58] say lord today is the day for my
[46:00] deliverance say lord please give me the
[46:02] strength to break this stronghold of the
[46:04] enemy the more we can surrender our will
[46:07] fully to the lord and submit like a lamb
[46:10] the more god's spirit can transform your
[46:12] life
[46:13] all things must become new in your life
[46:14] daily don't settle for nothing less than
[46:16] that
[46:18] then we can transform your life he can
[46:20] use you to win souls see thing is always
[46:23] talking about it takes discipline if he
[46:25] knows the word disciple has the word
[46:26] discipline in it you'd be yet to
[46:28] discipline yourself daily you can't you
[46:31] can't wait for brother ron to come help
[46:32] you discipline yourself but you it's an
[46:35] individual affair this was straight and
[46:37] narrow it's only room between you and
[46:39] god not you god and the pastor you can't
[46:41] write off the pastors coattails you
[46:43] can't run out brother jonathan's
[46:44] coattails you have to have a personal
[46:46] walk with him yourself
[46:48] that's the only that's the only way so
[46:50] take discipline is the key
[46:52] it's not going to be given to you on a
[46:53] silver platter you have to work at it to
[46:56] make sure you're manifesting a lamb
[46:58] spirit daily humility is so key with
[47:00] your walk with god humility is the key
[47:03] to keeping that lamb spirit
[47:05] let's go to galatians 6.
[47:13] how we doing on time pretty good pretty
[47:15] good praise god
[47:16] so we'll go with galatians 6 7-9
[47:20] be not deceived
[47:22] god is not mocked for whatsoever in man
[47:24] soweth that shall he reap also
[47:27] for he that sowed to his flesh shall of
[47:29] his flesh reap corruption
[47:31] but he that soul to the spirit shall the
[47:33] spirit reap life everlasting
[47:36] and let us not be wearing and well doing
[47:38] for if in due season we shall reap if we
[47:40] fight not
[47:42] so if you're putting the bare minimum
[47:43] little into your walk with god
[47:45] you're going to get what you sow
[47:47] if you're willing to put everything you
[47:48] got into the in your walk with god
[47:50] you're going to reap a lot it's like
[47:52] with anything at your job if you're just
[47:54] putting in the bare minimum at your job
[47:55] you're going to get the bare minimum
[47:57] so the thing is hold yourself
[47:59] accountable hold yourself to higher
[48:01] standards than what the world and
[48:02] society is trying to hold you to
[48:05] see society isn't going to help you get
[48:06] your work closer you'll walk closer with
[48:08] a guy only person to get your walk
[48:10] closer with god is
[48:12] you kicking yourself out the way your
[48:13] biggest enemy
[48:15] is not me
[48:16] it's not it's not the devil necessarily
[48:18] but it's yourself you're gonna be a
[48:20] reason why god can't move in your life
[48:23] and you have to realize that you have to
[48:25] crucify this old man because it likes to
[48:27] rile up it likes to come up and distract
[48:30] you likes to get you all your time
[48:31] engulfed but the thing is the more you
[48:33] can realize that your biggest enemy is
[48:35] yourself
[48:36] then you can have a victorious life but
[48:38] the thing is just knowing it is not
[48:40] going to help you
[48:41] you have to be willing to put it to
[48:43] action daily
[48:45] don't just be a hearer of the word but a
[48:47] doer as the scripture says
[48:50] so
[48:52] read a couple quotes from denzel
[48:53] washington that i thought really just
[48:55] fed with this
[48:56] with this uh service
[48:58] without commitment you'll never start
[49:00] but more importantly without consistency
[49:02] you'll never finish
[49:04] so the thing is you have to be committed
[49:06] to your lord and savior but more
[49:08] importantly you have to be consistent
[49:10] don't just be committed to them on
[49:11] wednesdays and wednesday nights and
[49:13] sunday mornings
[49:15] not just fridays not just easter service
[49:18] but every day seven days a week 24 hours
[49:20] a day you have to have consistency don't
[49:22] be up and down like a roller coaster be
[49:25] consistent with your walk with god daily
[49:29] found nothing in this life is worthwhile
[49:31] unless you take risks
[49:33] you'll be willing to take risks you'd be
[49:35] willing to be
[49:36] uncomfortable
[49:38] see the thing is the disciples
[49:39] when they uh when they met jesus that
[49:42] first time
[49:43] when they cast that net and all the fish
[49:45] came
[49:46] and they were willing think about it
[49:48] they were willing to let go of
[49:49] everything they took a risk that was
[49:51] their livelihood that's all they knew
[49:52] was fishing that's what their dad did
[49:54] that's probably what their dad's dad's
[49:56] dad dads did and that's all they did but
[49:58] they were willing to take that risk they
[50:00] were willing to jump up by blind faith
[50:02] he said i'll make you fishers of men he
[50:04] must make each one of you fishers of men
[50:06] we're here to fish after all souls
[50:09] that's the key
[50:13] just keeps going there is no passion to
[50:16] be found playing small ball and selling
[50:19] for a life that's less than the one
[50:21] you're capable of living
[50:22] there is no passion to be found playing
[50:25] small ball and selling for a life that's
[50:27] less than the one capable of living it's
[50:29] nelson mandela
[50:30] think about that
[50:31] god has called us to such
[50:35] trump's god is calling us we're sons and
[50:38] daughters of god he's giving you
[50:39] authority
[50:41] he's giving you you can create peace in
[50:43] a situation you can create joy happiness
[50:46] the thing is he's called us to reconcile
[50:48] another
[50:49] soul
[50:51] but the thing is we live so below
[50:53] our calling
[50:55] and god didn't intend for you to do that
[50:56] when it says lay the hands on the sick
[50:58] and shall recover they shall recover god
[51:00] have faith to believe that
[51:02] the same holy spirit
[51:04] that was in the book of acts is the same
[51:06] holy spirit that's here tonight speaking
[51:07] to the hearts the same holy spirit
[51:09] that's changed your nature into what it
[51:11] is now and still changing it he's no
[51:13] different so he's gonna do the same
[51:14] works they did in the book of acts
[51:17] right now he should be doing the same
[51:19] works
[51:20] so ease is the greater threat to
[51:23] progress and hardship think about that
[51:25] ease is a greater threat to progress and
[51:27] hardship without commitment you'll never
[51:29] start but more importantly without
[51:31] consistency you'll never finish so the
[51:33] thing is hardship
[51:35] actually
[51:36] helps you to get desperate because
[51:38] you're in a hard trial when jonah was in
[51:40] that welly's bell
[51:41] if i said that right that that whale's
[51:44] belly let me say that right
[51:46] he was he was desperate
[51:47] he realized remember he turned that
[51:49] temple and he remember what solomon said
[51:52] but the thing is when everything's all
[51:53] good and all easy and you know i'm
[51:55] relaxing in zion it's easy to kind of
[51:59] relax off your prayer life i'll pray
[52:00] every day but it'll just be the bare
[52:02] minimum i'll read but it'll be the bare
[52:04] minimum but the thing is the more we can
[52:06] get desperate always be desperate for
[52:09] god always in the good times and the bad
[52:11] times in the valley and the mountaintop
[52:13] then you will never get ease it's so
[52:15] easy that this laodicean spirit it says
[52:18] in revelations 3
[52:19] they're lukewarm
[52:21] thing is you don't want to have a form
[52:23] of godliness
[52:24] you want to you want to have the real
[52:26] thing
[52:27] make sure you're the real thing daily
[52:29] don't don't take any substitutes
[52:31] guys and looking for you take a
[52:32] substance to take that real thing
[52:34] be be hot for god
[52:36] be on fire for god be like a forest fire
[52:39] it's hard to put that thing out
[52:44] then to think that day we're living in
[52:46] is that so many people cut off that
[52:48] privilege this is from 1957 sirs we
[52:50] would see jesus
[52:53] i think the the day we were living in so
[52:55] many people cut off that privilege from
[52:56] the people why we're living millions of
[52:59] miles below our god-given privilege the
[53:03] church of god should never be divided we
[53:06] should be one and together we should
[53:08] never live under our privilege as we are
[53:10] today
[53:12] the great powers of god lays within the
[53:15] reach of every
[53:16] member of the body of christ the great
[53:19] powers of god lays within the reach of
[53:21] every member of the body of christ
[53:23] whatever things you desire when you pray
[53:25] believe that you receive it and you
[53:27] shall have it it shall be given to you
[53:31] now think about that just about where
[53:32] our churches are getting
[53:34] we're the children of god but we're
[53:35] losing our inheritance by our conduct
[53:39] the things that we do the things that we
[53:41] permit to be done we let the bars down
[53:44] you know what happens that's when the
[53:44] goats come in we can't let the bar there
[53:47] was things that we wouldn't do 15 years
[53:49] ago that we're doing now today
[53:51] we have to keep those bars up we have to
[53:53] set a standard in a world
[53:56] full of
[53:58] dropping the standards dropping the
[53:59] morals let us hold high those morals let
[54:03] us hold high though the conducts of the
[54:05] word of god
[54:07] let us let us be oddballs we're oddballs
[54:09] in this world we're not here to fit in
[54:11] with the world we're not here to act
[54:12] like a world we're here to live in the
[54:14] world yes but we're here not to be like
[54:17] the world
[54:18] jesus jesus didn't come to be like the
[54:20] word he can't he was different he knew
[54:21] that his king he was a heavenly kingdom
[54:24] and we have to recognize that we're not
[54:26] of this world we're from a heavenly
[54:28] kingdom and we have to hold ourselves
[54:30] with the standards
[54:31] of the word of god that's the blueprint
[54:33] right there this word is a blueprint
[54:36] and uh we're living millions of miles
[54:39] below our privilege and then someone can
[54:40] say the work of god being done dr
[54:42] so-and-so and dr jones say it's all the
[54:44] other doctors say this and that and we
[54:46] believe instead of looking into the word
[54:48] the word verifies what's the sheet food
[54:51] it comes out of the word
[54:53] now it's funny actually uh
[54:55] so reggie jackson you might he's a
[54:57] baseball player he struck out 2600 times
[55:01] the most in the history of baseball
[55:03] but you don't hear about the strikeouts
[55:05] you were people remember the home runs
[55:07] it's funny because uh brother ferguson
[55:10] mentioned thomas edison and i i just i
[55:13] just laughed and i'm like man i was
[55:14] gonna mention this so it's thomas edison
[55:16] conducted 1 000 failed experiments think
[55:19] about that
[55:21] do you know because the i didn't know
[55:23] that but did you know the thousand one
[55:25] was the light bulb
[55:27] every failed experiment is one step
[55:30] closer to success you've got to take
[55:32] risks don't be scared to take risks
[55:34] you're going to make mistakes in your
[55:35] walk with god you are i'm sorry you are
[55:39] you're human but thing is
[55:40] learn and grow from those mistakes don't
[55:43] be scared to
[55:46] to try new things you never tried before
[55:48] and witnessing
[55:49] don't don't be scared don't don't let
[55:51] those failures uh
[55:53] deter you
[55:54] you learn and grow from those things
[55:57] the thing is
[55:59] you've got to take risks you've also got
[56:01] to take risks i'm sure you probably
[56:02] heard that
[56:05] before first you will fail at some point
[56:07] in your life except is denzel washington
[56:09] speaking you will lose you will
[56:11] embarrass yourself you will suck at
[56:12] something there is no doubt about it but
[56:15] here's the thing this is him talking
[56:16] about his acting i didn't quit i didn't
[56:18] fall back i walked out there for prepare
[56:20] for the next audition the next audition
[56:23] the next audition i prayed i prayed and
[56:25] i prayed but i continued to fail and
[56:27] fail and fail but it didn't matter
[56:29] because you know what
[56:30] so you'll catch a break and i did catch
[56:32] a break so the thing is i'm trying to
[56:33] get what you guys say is you're gonna it
[56:35] may seem like you're getting no ground
[56:37] no ground you keep pressing forward you
[56:39] keep marching forward in that in the
[56:41] word that's promised to you you keep
[56:43] praying with all your heart the thing is
[56:45] god is going to move in a situation it
[56:47] may not be the right time yet see god's
[56:49] timing is perfect
[56:51] so just realize it says they that wait
[56:53] upon the lord shall renew their strength
[56:55] they shall come up with wings as he goes
[56:57] they shall run and not be where they
[56:58] shall walk and not faint now notice
[57:00] there's no time limit
[57:02] when it says they that wait upon the
[57:03] lord it says they that wait upon the
[57:05] lord so he'll give you that strength in
[57:08] due time when you need right when you
[57:10] need it see god is a god of perfect
[57:12] timing not on your timing
[57:16] and the reason why it's the thing is if
[57:18] you pray
[57:19] as soon as you pray for everything he
[57:20] gave it to you every every second you
[57:21] pray for it
[57:23] you'll be what a spoil you turn into a
[57:24] spoiled brat eventually
[57:26] and god is an ant see it's a reason why
[57:28] he's doing certain when you're first
[57:30] christian you give your heart to lord he
[57:32] answers things right away sometimes like
[57:33] that
[57:34] but the thing is he's trying to shape
[57:36] you and mold you he's trying to he's
[57:38] trying to teach you even from him you
[57:40] make mistakes he wants you to learn from
[57:42] he's trying to teach you the thing is
[57:44] when you make a mistake don't dislike oh
[57:46] oh it's me but learn from it like
[57:48] analyze what you could have done better
[57:50] or what you shouldn't have done analyze
[57:52] it take the time to to not make that
[57:54] same mistake because sometimes we make
[57:55] the same mistake over and over and over
[57:58] and over again because we're not looking
[58:00] the steps that we did from the last time
[58:02] the previous time
[58:04] let's keep going
[58:05] everyone here today has the training and
[58:08] the talent to succeed can i get amen on
[58:10] that
[58:11] but do you have the guts to fail
[58:13] if you don't fail you're not even trying
[58:15] i'll say it again if you don't fail
[58:18] you're not even trying
[58:20] he said my wife told me this great
[58:21] expression to get something you never
[58:24] had you have to do something you never
[58:27] did
[58:27] one more time to get something you never
[58:30] had you have to do something you never
[58:31] did
[58:33] to lose a battle is not to lose a war
[58:36] patton lost several battles but he never
[58:38] lost the war that's right and we'll lose
[58:41] lots of battles too but would not lose
[58:43] the war
[58:45] i'll make mistakes but i won't lose the
[58:47] cause god gave it to me god will take
[58:49] care of it that's from 1960 i know
[58:53] this uh this quote that kind of hit home
[58:54] i just so imagine on your deathbed and
[58:57] standing around your deathbed are the
[58:58] ghosts
[58:59] representing your unfulfilled potential
[59:01] the ghost of ideas you never acted on
[59:03] the ghost of talents you didn't use
[59:06] they're standing at you around your bed
[59:07] angry disappointed and upset they say we
[59:10] came to you because you you could have
[59:12] brought us to life they say and now we
[59:14] have to go to the grave together so i
[59:16] ask you today
[59:17] how many ghosts are going to be around
[59:18] your deathbed when your time comes
[59:21] so the thing is there's there's talents
[59:22] in each one of your lives
[59:24] that i don't know about but you know
[59:26] about and the question is are you using
[59:28] them for the kingdom of god are you
[59:30] scared to use them don't be scared
[59:32] there's brother roger he's playing the
[59:35] guitar now he's giving that talent back
[59:37] to the lord
[59:38] and that's a beautiful thing the thing
[59:40] is there's talent there might be a
[59:41] talent to even know about yet but the
[59:43] thing is use what god has given you for
[59:46] his kingdom's sake
[59:48] see when jesus earthly ministry and his
[59:50] corporate body was coming to an end
[59:52] but he still had more work to do but he
[59:54] couldn't do it at that point in time
[59:56] because you weren't here i wasn't here
[59:57] yet
[59:58] but the thing was he could say in john
[1:00:00] 17 4.
[1:00:03] go to john 17 4 with me
[1:00:08] i have glorified thee on earth i have
[1:00:10] finished the work which thou gavest me
[1:00:13] to do
[1:00:14] think about that
[1:00:18] so when his earthly ministry was done at
[1:00:20] that point
[1:00:21] all he was had to do at that point
[1:00:23] are the things that the lord has asked
[1:00:25] you to do
[1:00:26] have you been putting them off
[1:00:29] don't let your earthly journey when it
[1:00:30] comes to an end be filled with a grip
[1:00:33] regret is something you can never go
[1:00:35] back and redo
[1:00:37] so if god's telling you to do something
[1:00:38] right now you do it don't hesitate don't
[1:00:41] i'ma put off tomorrow because tomorrow's
[1:00:43] never promised how many people said that
[1:00:44] lord i'm gonna do this tomorrow and
[1:00:46] tomorrow never came for him
[1:00:48] just because you're young middle-aged
[1:00:50] doesn't mean anything death doesn't care
[1:00:53] about age
[1:00:54] i could walk out here and get hit by a
[1:00:56] car and i tried you know trying to solve
[1:00:58] sobering but it's the truth it could
[1:00:59] happen i could die of a heart attack
[1:01:01] tomorrow
[1:01:02] so don't try to put something off that
[1:01:03] you can do right now
[1:01:09] see the world needs christ
[1:01:12] we need to invest all we have
[1:01:14] put it into the kingdom of god invest
[1:01:16] your time your talents your money your
[1:01:18] life this world is dying and need you to
[1:01:21] be fully surrendered
[1:01:23] so jesus can use you to win those last
[1:01:26] souls the time is urgent it's high in
[1:01:28] time to wake out of your slumber fenton
[1:01:31] needs you
[1:01:32] graham blank needs you linden flint
[1:01:34] auburn hills utica sterling heights
[1:01:36] bloomfield pontiac
[1:01:39] they all need you they need us
[1:01:41] so you got to get out there you got to
[1:01:43] give it everything you got whether it's
[1:01:45] your time your talents your prayers or
[1:01:47] your treasures because remember this
[1:01:49] you'll never see a u-haul behind a
[1:01:51] hearse i never forget when denzel
[1:01:53] washington said that you'll never see a
[1:01:54] u-haul behind a hearse the egyptians
[1:01:57] tried it
[1:01:58] they got grave robbed
[1:02:00] they thought they could take it with
[1:02:01] them but they got grave robbed
[1:02:04] so the thing is so the question is what
[1:02:05] are you going to do with what you have
[1:02:08] i'm not talking about how much you have
[1:02:10] whatever your gift is what are you going
[1:02:12] to do with what you have what are you
[1:02:14] going to do what god is giving you he's
[1:02:16] giving you time he's giving you money
[1:02:17] whatever he's giving you what are you
[1:02:19] going to do with it
[1:02:21] don't just do it because my brother mark
[1:02:23] said it but you do it because you want
[1:02:24] to please god that should be the root
[1:02:25] reason why you're here tonight
[1:02:28] is that but i see you today and i'm
[1:02:30] encouraged by what i see i'm
[1:02:31] strengthened by what i see i love what i
[1:02:33] see this is denzel washington speaking
[1:02:34] of the event and i feel the same way i
[1:02:37] love what i'm glad i'm glad you guys are
[1:02:38] here i love to see you guys here
[1:02:40] pressing in
[1:02:41] there there's still work to do for us we
[1:02:43] have to work together as a body we have
[1:02:44] to build one another to edify one
[1:02:46] another
[1:02:47] we gotta make sure we're building iron
[1:02:49] sharpens iron
[1:02:51] here's my last point on failure
[1:02:52] sometimes it's the best way to figure
[1:02:54] out where you're going think about that
[1:02:57] sometimes it's the best way to figure
[1:02:59] out where you're going so my brother and
[1:03:01] my sister i want us to look at this in
[1:03:02] the spirit god has called us to win
[1:03:05] souls no matter if you witness to a
[1:03:06] thousand people and they reject you and
[1:03:08] the thousand and one person expect and
[1:03:10] accepts it i tell you that soul was
[1:03:12] worth all the labor all the tears all
[1:03:14] the rejection
[1:03:15] all the time spent he has called us to
[1:03:17] win souls
[1:03:19] we'll close here in a couple more first
[1:03:21] corinthians 9 22.
[1:03:26] have like seven more minutes
[1:03:29] all right
[1:03:32] you know what a preacher says that
[1:03:34] usually uh it's more than seven minutes
[1:03:40] all right
[1:03:41] so it says to the week became my as week
[1:03:44] that i might gain the week so once again
[1:03:46] you're trying to lift that person up
[1:03:48] you're trying to show that the person in
[1:03:50] value i'll listen to this uh
[1:03:52] this individual i can't remember his
[1:03:54] name sister ann sent it to me and he's
[1:03:56] like these five steps he had i can't
[1:03:57] remember all the five steps but pretty
[1:03:58] much his thing was
[1:04:00] when you when you're waking up and going
[1:04:02] out to the world
[1:04:03] your vision should be to help somebody
[1:04:05] help to build somebody help to show that
[1:04:07] person he has value or that woman she
[1:04:09] has value
[1:04:10] and that's what a true servant does
[1:04:12] they're willing to edify that's why paul
[1:04:14] said to the week became i as the week
[1:04:16] that i gained the weak i made all things
[1:04:19] that i might by all means save some
[1:04:21] you're not going to save every single
[1:04:22] person in this world but i rather die
[1:04:24] trying to to save at least one at least
[1:04:27] one
[1:04:30] so we all know that abraham fell in his
[1:04:31] life right we know that but when people
[1:04:34] talk about them i don't hear about they
[1:04:35] talk about the failures not even god
[1:04:37] mentioned the failures
[1:04:39] you know it will go to in the book of
[1:04:40] hebrews
[1:04:42] he we'll go to the book of hebrews
[1:04:44] hebrews 11. we'll just read a couple
[1:04:45] scriptures there and then we'll go to
[1:04:46] romans
[1:04:50] so it says by faith abraham when he was
[1:04:52] called to go out into a place which he
[1:04:54] should have to receive for inheritance
[1:04:56] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[1:04:58] whether he went by faith he saw
[1:05:00] adjourned in the land of promises in a
[1:05:02] strange country dwelling in tabernacles
[1:05:04] isaac and jacob and heirs with the same
[1:05:06] promise if you look for a city
[1:05:08] at foundations builder makers guys let's
[1:05:10] go to romans chapter 4
[1:05:13] 19.
[1:05:15] let's read that real quick
[1:05:17] so the thing is we see in abraham's life
[1:05:19] we read in the old testament did he fail
[1:05:21] did he have failures he did
[1:05:23] but he didn't let that shaper define his
[1:05:25] walk with god
[1:05:27] see the thing is and we can we do the
[1:05:29] same thing he's the father of our faith
[1:05:31] you know we're as children but i promise
[1:05:35] and we're going to make mistakes too
[1:05:37] we're going to fail too
[1:05:38] but don't let your failures define you
[1:05:40] negatively let them positively affect
[1:05:43] you
[1:05:44] grow from you can help help another
[1:05:46] brother or sister not make that same
[1:05:47] mistake
[1:05:48] let's go romans 4 19
[1:05:51] and be not weak in faith he considered
[1:05:53] not his own body now dead
[1:05:56] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:05:57] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:05:59] he staggered nuts at the promise of god
[1:06:02] through unbelief but we're strong in
[1:06:04] faith giving glory to god i notice in
[1:06:06] this scripture right here god doesn't
[1:06:08] say he he lied twice or he did this or
[1:06:10] that but he said he staggered not at the
[1:06:13] promise of god through unbelief that's
[1:06:14] what it says
[1:06:15] in faith giving glory to god
[1:06:18] he and being fully persuaded you have to
[1:06:20] be fully persuaded not part way not 98
[1:06:23] not 99 but 100 persuaded you have to be
[1:06:27] if you want god to help your situation
[1:06:28] you have to be fully persuaded
[1:06:31] that he can change situation that's what
[1:06:33] faith is
[1:06:34] he's rewarded of them that diligently
[1:06:36] seek him
[1:06:38] able to perform and therefore is imputed
[1:06:39] to him for righteousness
[1:06:41] now it's not written for his sake alone
[1:06:42] that was imputed to him but for us also
[1:06:44] to whom shall be imputed if we believe
[1:06:46] on him that raised up christ lord jesus
[1:06:47] from the dead who was liberated from our
[1:06:49] offenses and raised again for our
[1:06:50] justification sorry i'm going a little
[1:06:51] fast
[1:06:52] so
[1:06:53] let's keep going we'll go to after this
[1:06:55] we'll go to proverbs 24 16 just keep
[1:06:57] your place there for your walk with god
[1:06:59] it's not going to be flawless you're
[1:07:01] going to make mistakes but the key is to
[1:07:03] learn and grow from them
[1:07:05] for him for a just man falls seven times
[1:07:07] and rises up again but the wicked shall
[1:07:09] fall on the mission so if you fall
[1:07:11] get back up
[1:07:13] don't stay down get back up
[1:07:17] we're gonna ask ourselves to remind
[1:07:18] ourselves what was the holy ghost given
[1:07:20] for
[1:07:22] the purpose of the holy ghost is the
[1:07:23] father again the father dwelling in you
[1:07:25] working out his plans to finish his plan
[1:07:28] of redemption working through you to
[1:07:30] make you a co-worker with him giving you
[1:07:32] a place to give you a part for your
[1:07:34] fallen lost brother and sister giving
[1:07:37] you his spirit and his love to go hunt
[1:07:39] the lost as he did in the garden of eden
[1:07:41] adam adam we're out there
[1:07:43] that's the holy spirit does to a man or
[1:07:45] woman when he strikes into the heart
[1:07:47] takes a bold thirst
[1:07:49] there's a thirst and a hungering for
[1:07:50] lost souls
[1:07:52] now i thought of how the how the how god
[1:07:54] the dove is such a loving bird and the
[1:07:56] dove of god wanting to make love with
[1:07:58] his human beings god wants to be loved
[1:08:00] god wants to love you
[1:08:01] god so loved the world that he gave his
[1:08:03] only begotten son
[1:08:05] that whosoever believed in him should
[1:08:06] not perish but have everlasting life
[1:08:09] blessed be the lord the god wanting to
[1:08:10] make love he had to some something
[1:08:13] something lovable he had to make
[1:08:14] something gentle like himself he'd take
[1:08:16] his something that could be loved he had
[1:08:18] to make something of his own nature
[1:08:21] let's keep going
[1:08:23] i'm gonna skip a couple couple things
[1:08:25] all right
[1:08:26] our attitude is so important a bad
[1:08:29] attitude will affect your growth
[1:08:31] a walk your walk with the lord it will
[1:08:33] hinder you from keeping that lamb spirit
[1:08:35] it also hinders you from helping someone
[1:08:37] god will wait in that telephone wire
[1:08:39] until you drop that bad attitude a bad
[1:08:41] attitude will cloud your judgment and
[1:08:43] influence your decisions it will cause
[1:08:45] you to entertain negative thoughts about
[1:08:47] others it will hinder your faith so
[1:08:49] these three three things i want us to
[1:08:51] close on
[1:08:53] something denzel washington was like he
[1:08:55] was the first thing he said in the
[1:08:56] speech he said
[1:08:57] put god first i love that he said in
[1:09:00] everything you do
[1:09:02] he said you think you see in everything
[1:09:04] that i've accomplished everything you
[1:09:05] think i have i have a few things
[1:09:07] everything that i have is by the grace
[1:09:08] of god so remembering where all the
[1:09:10] things that you have come from don't
[1:09:12] forget where you came from don't forget
[1:09:14] what he's blessed you with and what he's
[1:09:15] still blessing you with don't forget
[1:09:17] that
[1:09:18] that's what that's how you stay humble
[1:09:20] if you have the attitude of gratitude
[1:09:21] that helps you to stay humble
[1:09:24] everything i have by grace understand
[1:09:26] that is a gift i've been protected i've
[1:09:28] been directed and i've been corrected
[1:09:29] he's i've kept god in my life and has
[1:09:31] kept me humble so stick with god in
[1:09:33] everything you do stick with that's the
[1:09:35] first thing so put god first in
[1:09:36] everything you do
[1:09:38] number two
[1:09:39] fail big don't be afraid to fail don't
[1:09:42] be afraid to think outside the box don't
[1:09:44] be afraid to fail b
[1:09:45] to dream big but remember dreams without
[1:09:48] goals are just dreams
[1:09:50] the ultimate feel disappointment so have
[1:09:52] dreams but have goals have life goals so
[1:09:55] i actually implemented this in my life i
[1:09:56] started last week i made daily goals
[1:09:59] monthly goals yearly goals
[1:10:01] and weekly goals
[1:10:03] and some of my daily goals the first one
[1:10:05] is put god first be still more the other
[1:10:08] one is to pray for greater sensitivity
[1:10:10] to recognize him in all aspects of my
[1:10:12] life all aspects not just up here while
[1:10:14] i'm preaching but in my at work in my
[1:10:16] car at home
[1:10:18] and uh some other ones i put uh
[1:10:20] not to murmur and complain
[1:10:22] because then flipping says do all things
[1:10:23] about murmurs and disputing
[1:10:26] something so easy for it says do all
[1:10:27] things without murmurings and disputing
[1:10:29] the scripture tells us so that's
[1:10:31] something i'm trying to work on also to
[1:10:32] really
[1:10:33] take control of the thoughts that i'm
[1:10:34] thinking to really ask myself is that
[1:10:36] thought i just thought is it is it
[1:10:38] helping me or is it hindering me see
[1:10:40] thing is you have to challenge yourself
[1:10:41] you'd be willing to put yourself in that
[1:10:43] chopping block
[1:10:45] and
[1:10:45] look in the mirror of the word and
[1:10:47] challenge yourself to see if you're
[1:10:48] really lining up with it don't just
[1:10:49] assume
[1:10:51] and i got another goal one of my yearly
[1:10:53] goals is to pay my credit card debt off
[1:10:55] by next year of december of april 2023.
[1:10:58] thing is you can't just put these goals
[1:10:59] we had to put action steps between them
[1:11:02] you got to make sure that check each day
[1:11:04] for your daily goals i'm going to
[1:11:05] challenge you guys make some day make
[1:11:07] five daily goals
[1:11:08] make five of them
[1:11:10] and make sure you're hit if you're not
[1:11:11] hitting the goals ask yourself why and
[1:11:14] then the next day you do your best to
[1:11:16] hit that goal strive to hit that goal
[1:11:18] don't just be satisfied with failure but
[1:11:20] learn from that failure and girlfriend
[1:11:21] as we said
[1:11:22] so see i try to give myself a goal every
[1:11:25] day understand to achieve these goals
[1:11:27] you must apply what discipline
[1:11:29] that's the key if one hit these goals
[1:11:31] discipline yourself inconsistency in
[1:11:33] order to achieve your goals you must
[1:11:34] apply discipline and consistency every
[1:11:37] day you have to work at it every day you
[1:11:38] have a plan every day you have heard we
[1:11:40] don't fail to plan
[1:11:42] we we don't plan to fail but we fail to
[1:11:45] plan that's the key we don't plan
[1:11:47] we just kind of see things we just kind
[1:11:49] of just oh well the day's going to go
[1:11:51] how it's going to go the thing is
[1:11:53] make a plan don't just walk around life
[1:11:56] aimlessly
[1:11:57] what a true leader does he he leads
[1:12:00] others
[1:12:01] he makes a plan he follows it
[1:12:04] problems don't surprise him he can take
[1:12:05] any problem on by the bull with the
[1:12:07] horns it's not him but it's the god god
[1:12:10] in him
[1:12:11] handling those problems that's the key
[1:12:13] right there
[1:12:14] if you want to be a leader
[1:12:17] and one last thing i'll close and we can
[1:12:18] we can stand
[1:12:22] so hard work really works hard that's
[1:12:24] what success people do just remember
[1:12:26] just because you're doing a lot more
[1:12:28] does not mean you're getting a lot more
[1:12:29] done just because you're doing a lot
[1:12:31] more does not mean you're getting a lot
[1:12:33] more done remember that
[1:12:35] just because you're doing a lot more
[1:12:37] i could be running in place
[1:12:39] and i'm not getting a lot done i'm not
[1:12:41] moving anywhere i'm just i'm moving but
[1:12:43] i'm not going anywhere
[1:12:45] so the thing is
[1:12:47] don't confuse movement with progress my
[1:12:50] mother told me you can run in place all
[1:12:52] the time but never get anywhere so you
[1:12:54] continue to strive and have goals
[1:12:56] continue to progress
[1:12:58] so i have more but i'll close right here
[1:13:01] so praise god let us uh
