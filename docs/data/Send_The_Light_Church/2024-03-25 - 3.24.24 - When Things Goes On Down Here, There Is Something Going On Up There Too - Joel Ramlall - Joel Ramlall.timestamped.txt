[37:44] on both ends I was driving here it was a

[38:00] I was on my way I started to say to my
[38:02] wife I suspect I know we don't plan on
[38:04] preaching this Sunday but uh I'm feeling
[38:07] the presence of the Lord here and then
[38:08] just almost as soon as we pulled into
[38:10] the driveway brother John you were
[38:12] calling as we were pulling into the
[38:13] driveway there in Toledo and so God
[38:16] works on both ends he knows what he's
[38:17] doing he has it all in control so we
[38:20] certainly appreciate you brother John
[38:21] and sister Cheryl and uh I was talking
[38:24] to my wife a little bit about you this
[38:26] morning just asking what do they like
[38:28] and you know she she was just telling me
[38:30] that you know of all the people that she
[38:32] knew and that she met and that she
[38:34] interacted with here while she lived in
[38:35] Michigan she just said that you were
[38:37] some of the finest Christians that she
[38:40] ever I can certainly see that and
[38:42] reflected also in your people and in the
[38:45] church as well so God bless you this
[38:47] morning uh forgive me just trying to uh
[38:50] work out some of the nervousness a
[38:51] little bit but if you would stand with
[38:53] me and let's work to look to the word of
[38:55] God this morning amen uh I'm gonna do a
[38:57] little uh bit of a slideshow here this
[39:00] morning I just like to show you where
[39:02] I'm getting what I'm saying to you um
[39:06] let's turn in our Bibles this morning to
[39:09] Matthew chapter
[39:16] 14 Matthew chap 14 and verse 22 whenever
[39:20] you have it you say amen
[39:22] amen now I come to realize that at work
[39:25] when you get there to the office you
[39:27] have to clock in then you can start
[39:30] working when you come to church it's the
[39:32] opposite you got to clock out first you
[39:34] got to let go of all the thoughts you
[39:35] got to let go of everything that
[39:37] happened to you during the week all all
[39:38] the thoughts that the devil's throwing
[39:40] you away you got to put those aside this
[39:41] morning and let's say let's concentrate
[39:44] on Jesus this morning brother Brandon
[39:46] would say every baby has to cry for his
[39:48] own candy I've got a little one there
[39:50] when you hear him start to cry in the
[39:51] service this morning he's not crying for
[39:53] the others to get some milk he's crying
[39:55] for himself to get some milk so you got
[39:56] to out just the same to Jesus to get
[39:59] your milk this morning amen uh Matthew
[40:02] 14 and: 22 it says straightway Jesus
[40:05] constrained his disciples to get into a
[40:08] ship and to go before him onto the other
[40:10] side while he sent the multitudes away
[40:13] and when he had sent the multitudes away
[40:15] he went up pay attention to those words
[40:17] he went up into a mountain apart to pray
[40:20] and when the evening was come he was
[40:22] there alone but the ship was now in the
[40:24] midst of the sea tossed with waves for
[40:27] the the wind was contrary doesn't that
[40:29] sound like everyday life the wind was
[40:31] contrary it sounds like every morning
[40:33] you get up something else is wrong
[40:34] something else is going on the wind was
[40:36] contrary for them and in the Fourth
[40:38] Watch of the night Jesus went unto them
[40:40] walking on the sea and when the
[40:42] disciples saw him walking on the sea
[40:44] they were troubled saying it is a spirit
[40:46] and they cried out for fear but
[40:48] straightway Jesus spake unto them saying
[40:51] be of good share it is I Be not Afraid
[40:54] isn't it wonderful to hear those words
[40:56] from the Lord Peter answered him and
[40:58] said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto
[41:01] thee on the water and he said come and
[41:04] when Peter was come down out of the ship
[41:07] he walked on the water to go to Jesus
[41:09] but when he saw the wind boisterous he
[41:11] was afraid beginning to sink he cried
[41:13] saying Lord save me and immediately
[41:16] Jesus stretched forth his hand and
[41:17] caught him and said unto him oh thou of
[41:19] little faith wherefor didst thou doubt I
[41:23] want you to pay attention to something
[41:24] here he said come in verse 2 9 Jesus
[41:27] said come and the moment that Jesus said
[41:30] come the care of Peter was placed into
[41:33] jesus' hands Peter's protection was
[41:35] placed into jesus' hands now there was
[41:37] nothing that could happen to Peter but
[41:39] what Jesus already knew would happened
[41:41] but what Jesus knew that if it happened
[41:43] to him I could save him I could rescue
[41:45] him and if God would call us out in this
[41:47] age and say come out of her my people if
[41:49] we take that step if we say Lord I
[41:51] believe I will believe in the message of
[41:53] the hour then it is his responsibility
[41:55] to take care of us just the same way as
[41:57] it was his responsibility and everything
[42:00] was settled the moment he said come it
[42:02] was his responsibility to take care of
[42:04] Peter and it's his responsibility this
[42:06] morning to take care of his own Sheep
[42:09] amen God bless you let's pray Heavenly
[42:11] Father Lord you know I am nothing Lord
[42:14] Jesus I am just your servant this
[42:16] morning Father I didn't come here to to
[42:19] speak words I came to get out of the way
[42:22] that you might speak words oh Lord Jesus
[42:24] uh would you gather here with us this
[42:26] morning Father I I've heard it said how
[42:28] you met with 5,000 Lord you met with 70
[42:32] you met with 12 Lord but your Prophet
[42:35] said you would even come to one hungry
[42:37] soul lord Jesus if there is a hungry
[42:39] Soul here this morning I pray that you
[42:41] would come down and fill them Lord fill
[42:43] them with your presence Lord with your
[42:44] word Lord and give your sheep what you
[42:47] have need of this morning we pray Lord I
[42:49] commit it all to you may thy will be
[42:50] done Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus
[42:53] Christ we pray amen amen amen God bless
[42:56] you you may be seated
[42:58] I want to preach this morning on a
[43:00] subject I I'd like to call uh when
[43:03] things goes on down here there is
[43:06] something going on up
[43:08] there uh a pretty lengthy title but
[43:12] you'll see in a little bit where I'm
[43:13] drawing this from when things goes on
[43:15] down here there is something going on up
[43:18] there too because as human beings we get
[43:20] sometimes trapped in the realm we're
[43:22] living in we're trapped in these
[43:24] Dimensions we're trapped seeing only the
[43:26] Earthly but on the flip side of that
[43:28] there's something going on in the heaven
[43:31] the prophet would say many times we
[43:32] think that it's disappointing when we
[43:34] get down sick or we feel that something
[43:36] has happened but if you just won't be
[43:38] discouraged and remember that all things
[43:40] work together for good to them that love
[43:42] God the footsteps of the righteous is
[43:44] ordered of the Lord again he would say
[43:47] why is it that these things happen but
[43:49] you know many times they are a blessing
[43:51] in disguising I love the words he uses
[43:53] blessing in disguising God why do you
[43:56] have to disguise is this blessing why
[43:58] can't you just tell me it's a blessing
[43:59] but I'm going I'm going through the
[44:01] worst right now Lord Jesus but God would
[44:03] say that's your blessing in disguising
[44:06] many times we can't understand them for
[44:08] some of us that's most of the time we
[44:10] can't understand them it's hard for us
[44:11] to look past what's happening to us in
[44:14] the present true he said if you'll just
[44:16] let them alone God will work it out just
[44:19] right now listen as brother Brandon when
[44:21] he describes this sermon that he
[44:22] preaches it is I be not afraid he always
[44:25] begins uh uh describing the situation
[44:27] that the disciples find themselves in
[44:29] here they are with Jesus and then he
[44:31] sends them out on the boat and he begins
[44:33] to point something out call something
[44:34] out that they went in the boat but they
[44:36] went without Jesus when we go without
[44:39] Jesus problems are sure to follow
[44:41] brother M will say we've went away with
[44:42] our church believing it's all right
[44:44] because we got great organizations great
[44:46] buildings and we've left Jesus behind
[44:49] there are many things that we can do and
[44:50] leave Jesus behind it's important for us
[44:53] every morning that we wake up say I
[44:55] can't walk without Jesus I can't talk
[44:57] without Jesus I can't live without Jesus
[44:59] there's nothing that I can do without
[45:01] Jesus I can't live this Christian walk
[45:03] in and of myself I've come to find out
[45:05] the more that I preach the more that I
[45:07] learn that I can't do it it it's
[45:09] Converse it's opposite to the thinking
[45:11] of man uh you know if you're out if
[45:13] you're a professor of some uh field if
[45:15] you're if you're a worker in a certain
[45:17] career the more that you do it the more
[45:20] confident you feel the more the better
[45:22] you feel like I I know this now if
[45:24] you've been a doctor for many years you
[45:25] can say oh I've seen this case before
[45:28] but not so with the Gospel of Jesus
[45:29] Christ not so with the word of God the
[45:31] more that I read it the more that I
[45:33] realize lord it's going to take
[45:35] something greater than
[45:37] me the more that I preach the more that
[45:39] I realize I need Jesus but leaving Jesus
[45:43] behind trouble is certain to come you
[45:44] see they had gotten in that boat and
[45:47] they were fishermen they had done this a
[45:49] thousand times you can wake up every
[45:51] morning and say well I've done this a
[45:52] thousand times I've been a Christian for
[45:54] a while now I've I've listened to quite
[45:56] a few tapes myself I I I know what I'm
[45:58] doing Lord and then that's when the Lord
[46:00] will send the trial just to Humble you a
[46:02] little bit and let you know that he's
[46:03] still in control you still need him amen
[46:07] amen there they were in the boat trouble
[46:08] was all
[46:10] around got an amen out of somebody
[46:15] amen he said many times you might think
[46:18] the same thing my friend you might think
[46:19] you have went off without him but
[46:20] remember he is still watching you
[46:23] there's there the devil gets you he
[46:25] tries to say oh you went off without
[46:27] Jesus there you go but remember all that
[46:29] time even when you're in the midst of
[46:31] the trial even when you think even when
[46:33] you recognize Lord truly I have failed
[46:36] he's still watching you he knows right
[46:38] where you are there may be trouble in
[46:40] your home there may be trouble in your
[46:42] soul there may be trouble in your body
[46:43] the prophet covered everything now
[46:45] trouble in your soul trouble in your
[46:46] home trouble in your body whatever it is
[46:48] don't you worry he's got his eyes on you
[46:50] he is watching you I say he is watching
[46:53] this church this morning he is watching
[46:55] you he watched you this morning as you
[46:56] got dress maybe you were weary in your
[46:58] spirit in your body you were thinking
[47:00] Lord I I just don't feel like going
[47:02] today he was watching you all that time
[47:04] he knows what afflicts you he knows what
[47:06] troubles you he's got his eyes on you he
[47:08] is watching on you he's watching you
[47:10] here's the important part now he climbed
[47:12] up on top of a mountain he was looking
[47:14] out there and he seen every trick that
[47:16] the devil was playing Hallelujah
[47:18] somebody say every there's nothing that
[47:20] can happen to you but what God has
[47:22] already seen and known would happen to
[47:24] you there's nothing that can happen to
[47:25] you but what God can say say I allowed
[47:27] it to happen to you wow doesn't that
[47:30] switch the way that we think about the
[47:31] trials we go through doesn't that the
[47:33] switch it it turns everything upside
[47:35] down it turns it on its head now it's no
[47:37] longer about what's happening to me now
[47:39] it's about what has God allowed to
[47:42] happen to me this morning I'm not
[47:44] preaching to you a sermon I'm preaching
[47:46] to you a lesson that that the Lord
[47:49] taught me am so it's it's personal these
[47:52] are things that I had to I had to learn
[47:55] I had to learn how to to look at uh
[47:57] God's word the right way to look at
[47:59] what's happening to me the right way to
[48:01] realize that he's got it all in
[48:04] control every trick the devil was
[48:07] playing he not only climbed but he
[48:08] climbed the ramp parts of Calvary not
[48:11] only to Calvary but the ramp parts of
[48:13] Glory he sits tonight at the Majesty he
[48:15] looks down on Earth there's not even a
[48:17] ripple can come on the water without its
[48:20] by his permission not even a ripple in
[48:23] your life amen did something go wrong
[48:25] this morning did you lose your keys did
[48:27] you lose your shoe on the on the way to
[48:28] church uh did you get to work and then
[48:31] you you got an assignment you didn't
[48:32] really want to do there's not even a
[48:34] ripple that can happen in your life but
[48:36] what God already knows about it he can
[48:38] look out on the sea and not even a
[48:40] ripple not a wave will come but what God
[48:43] knows about it he knows every bird that
[48:45] flies in the sky he knows where they
[48:46] will Nest he knows every blade of grass
[48:48] he knows every every leaf on the tree
[48:50] and he knows every detail of your life
[48:53] hallelujah it's by his permission the
[48:57] the sea can't move a leaf can't move a
[48:59] bird can't fly oh blessed be the name of
[49:02] the Lord and you can imagine them now
[49:04] they're in the boat there it is rocking
[49:06] oh oh what are we going to do are we
[49:08] going to die here is the boat every wave
[49:10] that would hit you can imagine how that
[49:11] boat would go up and oh you know that
[49:14] moment when the boat goes up and then
[49:15] you lose your stomach for a little
[49:17] bit and you feel like that in life
[49:20] sometimes oh god what have you thrown me
[49:22] into what what is going on here I've
[49:25] lost my stomach I I feel like I'm in
[49:27] freef Fall you can feel like that in
[49:28] your mind sometimes but there in that
[49:30] time there in the storm there in the
[49:32] trial you hear a voice that says it is I
[49:35] Be not Afraid and you'd say God here now
[49:38] I wasn't expecting you here but here in
[49:40] this trial here in this Darkness here
[49:42] while it's raining we're here where I
[49:44] can hardly see in front of me I don't
[49:46] know what lays ahead but here I would
[49:48] hear it is I Be not Afraid here and
[49:51] during that time to hear his voice
[49:53] that's when God loves to speak that's
[49:54] when God loves to come down to his
[49:56] children that's when he'll come down and
[49:58] speak to your heart it is I Be not
[50:00] Afraid those are the times that he uses
[50:02] to come down and say it is I Be not
[50:05] Afraid you see we're always looking at
[50:08] what's in front of us there they were on
[50:10] the boat all they could see is what was
[50:11] in front of them but we've got to switch
[50:13] our thinking from Earthly to Heavenly
[50:16] switch our thinking from time based to
[50:19] Eternity based it's very hard to do but
[50:22] can you imagine now an eternal God a God
[50:26] who wait back in the beginning somewhere
[50:28] that one bat of his eyelids perhaps
[50:30] could have taken 10 million years that
[50:33] Revolution to accomplish that this is
[50:36] the god that would maybe perhaps he
[50:38] would have one thought for a 100 million
[50:40] years and think about that one thought
[50:43] you you don't know the scale of time
[50:45] that we're dealing with it's impossible
[50:47] for us to comprehend what's your name
[50:50] brother Indigo go brother Indigo God
[50:54] could have thought about brother indigo
[50:57] for 10 million years just to think about
[51:01] him alone him alone nobody else perhaps
[51:03] God just thought about him what he would
[51:06] look like the way he would comb his here
[51:08] what he would like dislike what would
[51:10] make him upset what would make him happy
[51:12] and God thought about him God loves him
[51:14] God had his picture there in the back
[51:15] part of his mind this is the type of God
[51:17] that we're talking about this is the one
[51:19] that loves us the one perhaps way back
[51:21] in the beginning as he thought about you
[51:23] and just you he put everybody aside for
[51:25] just a moment just to think about you
[51:28] for 10 million
[51:30] years wow God thought about you more
[51:32] than even you think about you he thought
[51:35] about you for longer than you even have
[51:37] time here on the earth to think about
[51:38] you he thought about what you would go
[51:40] through he thought about what would
[51:42] happen to you more than you've had time
[51:44] to think about what happened to you and
[51:46] that's a lot of the times what we dwell
[51:48] on what happened to me Lord God is
[51:50] trying to get you to look up and show
[51:52] you that there's something else while
[51:54] something's going on down here there's
[51:56] something something going on up there
[51:58] amen now follow me now as we try to
[52:00] progress through this thought when
[52:02] something's going on down here there's
[52:04] an equivalent happening up there
[52:07] somewhere
[52:09] am
[52:10] amen I can imagine John perhaps he was
[52:13] one of the talkative ones on the boat as
[52:15] they were rowing out there Jesus had
[52:17] just fed 5,000 and he said you know my
[52:20] mother used to tell me when when our
[52:22] ancient people come into the land she
[52:24] was telling us about how that the people
[52:26] were hungry and they didn't know what to
[52:28] do and they were perhaps some murmuring
[52:30] some complaining perhaps they got what
[52:32] we call in our house angry hungry you
[52:35] just get angry for no reason maybe I'm
[52:38] the only human being here
[52:41] but but maybe they were getting
[52:44] hangry and then they were they were
[52:46] Desiring food but while that was
[52:49] happening down here there was something
[52:50] he was saying my mom used to tell me how
[52:52] Jehovah God the stern brow oh how he
[52:55] rained Mana down out of Heaven amen said
[52:58] oh that that that look that Jesus gave
[53:01] as he as he multiplied the bread surely
[53:04] this must be the Jehovah God surely this
[53:06] must be the one that was up there
[53:08] because when they were hungering down
[53:10] here there was something going on up
[53:12] there when they were hungering down here
[53:14] there was an aroma that be to build up
[53:16] in Heaven's kitchen amen something was
[53:20] cooking and God would SWAT away all the
[53:22] angels as they come you know like how
[53:24] when your wife is cooking something in
[53:25] the kitchen she say no that's not for
[53:27] you don't touch
[53:29] that God would say no that's not for you
[53:32] that's for the kids he's going to rain
[53:34] down this man on them because while they
[53:36] were hungering down here there was
[53:38] already something transpiring up there
[53:40] God already had the solution in work up
[53:43] there God was already baking something
[53:44] up in the kitchen and he was raining it
[53:47] down I say if you're hungry this morning
[53:49] blessed are those who hunger and thirst
[53:51] after righteousness I say if you're
[53:53] hungry this morning God is ready to pour
[53:55] out to you if if you will receive it if
[53:58] you will believe that he
[54:00] can
[54:03] Amen brother Bron would describe the
[54:05] situation that happened in the Garden of
[54:07] Eden and how his children had fallen
[54:10] then one day I found where the Prophet
[54:11] said in the message I don't have it up
[54:13] here in the message God's provided
[54:15] approach to Divine Fellowship 1960 he
[54:18] said then one day there was a voice came
[54:21] up in the presence of God and said those
[54:23] your loved ones your children has fallen
[54:26] they have sinned and have did that which
[54:28] was wrong said God didn't just select
[54:30] some Angel to go down and look it over
[54:32] to see if it was so or not or or a
[54:34] certain cherubim of the heavens but God
[54:36] came himself crying Adam Where Art Thou
[54:39] God himself come crying for his Lost
[54:41] Child
[54:43] amen listen to what he said take place
[54:45] now then one day there was a voice came
[54:48] up in the presence of God and said those
[54:50] your loved one your children has fallen
[54:52] and it spurred God into action you see
[54:54] something had transpired on the Earth
[54:56] his children had fallen and the
[54:58] equivalent action had happened up in
[55:00] heaven God said what my children has
[55:02] fallen and he was on his way down to go
[55:04] there the Angels had fallen before
[55:06] nothing bothered him he never budged at
[55:08] that the Angels could fall the devil
[55:10] could fall it didn't bother him at all
[55:12] but when his children fell there was an
[55:14] Associated action in heaven when his
[55:16] children fell then God said I need to
[55:19] rise I need to go down and check this
[55:20] out myself and he was on his way I say
[55:23] if you are a child of God and you have
[55:25] stumbled and you have fallen into sin
[55:27] you've made a mistake this morning I say
[55:29] almighty God is on his way almighty God
[55:32] is on his way down my little children I
[55:35] sometimes send them out into the
[55:36] driveway I'll say go ride your bikes and
[55:38] then they'll go out and somehow even
[55:40] though they have the training wheels
[55:41] they find a way to fall over and so when
[55:43] they fall over what do you think my
[55:45] reaction is as a parent I don't go up to
[55:47] them and say you you were so full of
[55:50] Pride that's why you fell yep you you
[55:53] you were a serpent seat to begin yeah
[55:55] you that's why you yeah you were made to
[55:57] S no that's not what God does when his
[55:59] children fall we can live under that
[56:01] cloud we can live under that uh feeling
[56:03] like God God is there to to to judge us
[56:06] like that but if you are a child of God
[56:08] God comes down to save you God comes
[56:11] down to offer a pathway back to
[56:12] Salvation for you God comes down to
[56:14] rescue you just like I would run to my
[56:16] son I would pick him up off the bicycle

[56:23] get it right this time God is here to do
[56:25] the same thing to you this morning if
[56:27] you have failed and if you're honest
[56:29] with yourself we have all failed at some
[56:31] time it doesn't have to take long you
[56:33] could you could say we have Pro
[56:34] somebody's probably failed this morning
[56:36] on their way to church maybe you argued
[56:38] in the car on the way to church it's
[56:40] easy to fail as a human being but but
[56:42] our God is here to save us
[56:45] yes he's on his
[56:47] way many times we get the impression of
[56:50] God that he's standing uh with a hammer
[56:52] ready to crush us if if if we have made
[56:55] a mistake mistake or if we have failed
[56:57] but our God is not standing with a
[56:59] hammer he's standing over us with nail
[57:01] scarred hands that's the god that we're
[57:03] serving that's the god that we believe
[57:04] in one day he will be the judge but
[57:06] today he's in the earth trying to save
[57:09] everybody he's not here trying to send
[57:10] you to hell this morning he's trying to
[57:12] get you to heaven he's trying to get you
[57:14] to see the truth he's trying to get you
[57:16] to fall in love with his word he's
[57:17] trying to get you to woo you to fall in
[57:19] love with him he's after your heart am
[57:22] it's many times us that we're only after
[57:24] the hand of God God bless my business
[57:27] God bless my family God bless my
[57:29] finances God we want the hand of God but
[57:31] who will seek the heart of God
[57:35] hallelujah God is down he's coming down
[57:38] he heard his children fall I'm on my way
[57:40] I have to save them I have to rescue
[57:42] them I have to make a way back even
[57:44] sending them out of the garden he made a
[57:45] way he said I I will make a way for them
[57:48] to come back he had a plan already of
[57:50] Salvation he had a Plan of Redemption
[57:52] already that would unfold even even
[57:55] before they could fall and leave the
[57:56] garden God had in the back part of his
[57:58] man mind a plan for Redemption amen
[58:02] amen now I I spent uh 12 hours driving
[58:06] here but prior to that I had to pack my
[58:08] vehicle I had to pack all of my things
[58:10] my belongings and while I was making
[58:12] ready for that uh uh there there was no
[58:15] chance there there was not a moment in
[58:18] time that it could be possible that I
[58:20] would pack up all all those things in my
[58:23] vehicle and then drive away and forget
[58:25] my kids ks in the house right any parent
[58:29] knows that you can pack for a 12-hour
[58:31] road trip uh it's impossible that you
[58:34] would get in the car and take off
[58:35] driving and forget the three kids in the
[58:37] house and neither would God set all of
[58:40] these things happening in Leo deia
[58:41] neither would he put all of these
[58:43] political players in place neither would
[58:45] would he allow uh uh the the Beast and
[58:48] the word World Council to start start to
[58:50] set in place that great Machinery that
[58:52] they will use to uh uh to enact to their
[58:55] will upon the people neither will he
[58:58] allow the World Council of churches to
[59:00] start to take place neither will he
[59:01] allow all the signs of the times to
[59:03] start to take place in leod deia without
[59:06] remembering his children neither will
[59:09] will he allow all of these things to to
[59:11] go on in the polit in the political
[59:13] realm neither will he allow evil to
[59:15] increase in the land he will not allow
[59:17] all of this and then forget about his
[59:19] children I say he's getting ready to
[59:21] take his children out of here and all
[59:23] the signs that we see happening should
[59:25] make us say thank God he's preparing
[59:27] thanks God he will not forget his own he
[59:30] will not allow all of this to happen and
[59:32] then leave his children behind no I say
[59:34] the children are the first thing in his
[59:36] mind they are the first thought of his
[59:38] and everything that you see happening
[59:39] around it's only a sign of the time to
[59:41] help us to get ready to point and to
[59:43] know that Jesus Christ is coming back
[59:45] for his own amen thank you Jesus there
[59:49] is one brother brm told a story about a
[59:51] little boy that had fallen off the wagon
[59:54] one day and then I think in old Cowboy
[59:56] or Sheriff saw him falling off the cliff
[59:58] and he saved the boy and now uh he
[1:00:01] rescued the boy now time went
[1:00:04] on that boy lived his life one day he he
[1:00:08] come to start to do the wrong thing and
[1:00:11] then uh he had to appear before the
[1:00:13] court when he appeared before the court
[1:00:16] he recognized that the man that was the
[1:00:18] judge was was that sheriff that had
[1:00:20] saved him when he was a little boy he
[1:00:21] said judge don't you recognize me can't
[1:00:24] can't you help me can't you say me again
[1:00:26] like you did when I was a little boy and
[1:00:28] the judge would say then I was your
[1:00:31] savior but today I am your judge I say
[1:00:34] Jesus Christ is not going to step into
[1:00:37] that role just yet but there will come a
[1:00:39] time when he will today is the day of
[1:00:41] your salvation today he does not stand
[1:00:44] as your accuser today he stands in your
[1:00:46] defense today he stands as your attorney
[1:00:50] I say Now's the Time to get in now when
[1:00:52] he stands as our attorney as our
[1:00:54] Advocate brother Brandon with say when
[1:00:56] you pay an attorney uh you're paying him
[1:00:58] for the knowledge that he has of the law
[1:01:01] if you got in trouble with the law or
[1:01:03] you need something C done legally or or
[1:01:05] you've ever had to go and hire an
[1:01:07] attorney you're paying him because you
[1:01:09] know that you don't possess the
[1:01:10] knowledge of the law that he has so you
[1:01:13] can't plead your case the way that he
[1:01:16] could now when it comes to Jesus Christ
[1:01:19] he is not somebody who just knows the
[1:01:22] law of God he's somebody who is the law
[1:01:24] of God he's the Fulfillment of the law
[1:01:27] of God there and if I commit my case to
[1:01:29] him if I commit my soul to him he pleads
[1:01:32] the case on my behalf there is no way
[1:01:34] that I can lose the case as it stands
[1:01:36] before the father because of my attorney
[1:01:38] because he is the law Jesus Christ is
[1:01:40] the law and if I commit everything that
[1:01:42] happens to me in life to him I can rest
[1:01:44] assured I can know that Jesus Christ
[1:01:46] will take care of it
[1:01:48] amen so every little thing that happens
[1:01:50] to you every accusation that happens to
[1:01:52] you uh everything that goes wrong in
[1:01:54] your life hey just hand it over to the
[1:01:56] attorney hand it over to the advocate
[1:01:58] say Lord can you please take care of
[1:02:00] this for me any evil word spoken against
[1:02:02] you any something done wrong to you hand
[1:02:04] it over to the attorney there you go
[1:02:06] just hand it to him God is Looking Down
[1:02:08] With Love on his people this morning
[1:02:10] Hallelujah you can think of the Mount of
[1:02:12] transfiguration and how uh Elijah
[1:02:15] appeared he represented the justice of
[1:02:17] God Moses appeared he represented the
[1:02:19] law of God uh but there was another one
[1:02:22] there on the mountain it was Jesus and
[1:02:24] he represented God's love brother
[1:02:26] Brenham would say that when Divine love
[1:02:28] is projected Sovereign Grace takes over
[1:02:31] he would say when his love projected his
[1:02:33] feeling Christ stepped out to take his
[1:02:35] place it required something to take the
[1:02:37] place his love alone went for you and
[1:02:39] Grace provided a sacrifice for you
[1:02:42] what's he saying that when God projected
[1:02:44] his Divine love to to this earth It
[1:02:47] produced Christ in the earth amen think
[1:02:49] about it John 3:16 for God so loved the
[1:02:51] world he gave his only begotten son when
[1:02:54] God projected his love to the world It
[1:02:57] produced Christ in a Manger Christ was
[1:02:59] born in the earth when you project love
[1:03:01] one to another it produces Christ in
[1:03:04] that situation if you will project love
[1:03:06] inside of this church it will produce
[1:03:07] Christ inside of this church if you
[1:03:09] enter into a situation you don't know
[1:03:11] what to do and you project just project
[1:03:13] the love of God it'll bring Christ down
[1:03:15] into that
[1:03:16] situation
[1:03:18] amen everything is centered on love
[1:03:21] brother Brandon would say unless each
[1:03:23] one of these gifts is put right in the
[1:03:25] center of love love it'll become selfish
[1:03:28] and indiff yes any gift in the body if
[1:03:30] we don't Center it right on love it'll
[1:03:33] become selfish and different amen oh the
[1:03:37] love of God this morning he looks down
[1:03:39] on love with his CH upon his children
[1:03:42] amen how many remember the story of the
[1:03:45] account of M Mah in the Bible how Mah
[1:03:48] was called up and and they didn't really
[1:03:50] want to know what he had to say and they
[1:03:53] they said all right is there one more
[1:03:55] yeah okay M bring him on up and then uh
[1:03:58] they said well tell us you know shall we
[1:04:00] go up and take it it's our land you know
[1:04:02] should we go up and take it and then MAA
[1:04:05] said at first oh yeah go ahead go ahead
[1:04:07] yeah kind of in a mocking way yeah sure
[1:04:09] go but no tell us for real then when he
[1:04:13] told them the truth they did not want to
[1:04:15] hear that that's true oh how they would
[1:04:16] strike Mya we're talking about when when
[1:04:19] things are going on down here there's
[1:04:22] something else going on up there amen
[1:04:25] now listen you know what that head Chief
[1:04:28] captain of the priest did like that
[1:04:30] walked right up pulled them horns off
[1:04:31] the top of his head smacked Mah right in
[1:04:33] the mouth that showed his religion
[1:04:35] didn't it well he just might have had a
[1:04:37] bloody jaw there for a few minutes and
[1:04:39] he said which way went the spirit of God
[1:04:41] when it went out of me to go to you he
[1:04:43] said just wait till you're sitting
[1:04:44] hiding in the cage Over Yonder and
[1:04:46] you'll know which way it went MAA did
[1:04:49] micaa said I saw Israel scattered he
[1:04:51] said I looked up into the heavens and I
[1:04:54] saw the great throne of God and there
[1:04:56] was Angels standing on the right hand
[1:04:58] and the left hand of God hold on now
[1:05:01] here's Mah he's brought before this
[1:05:03] Council and they're wanting to get an
[1:05:05] answer out of him and oh they're holding
[1:05:07] this great big counsel around maaya here
[1:05:09] on the Earth but when MAA looks up into
[1:05:11] heaven he sees he says I looked up into
[1:05:12] the heavens and I saw the great Throne
[1:05:14] of God and there was Angels standing on
[1:05:16] the right hand and the left hand of God
[1:05:18] that's the way it is with the believer
[1:05:19] when you'll stand for the word of God if
[1:05:21] you stand for the word of God while
[1:05:23] while the persecutions come here while
[1:05:25] the Temptations come here W while the
[1:05:27] agitators and the aggressors May gather
[1:05:30] around you but if you stand for the word
[1:05:32] of God there's another Council taking
[1:05:34] place up in the heavens they were
[1:05:36] holding a council when they seen all
[1:05:38] this happening like they was holding

[1:06:12] work with what you got
[1:06:13] amen praise God when something's going
[1:06:16] on down here there's something going on
[1:06:18] up there one day Elisha and his servant
[1:06:22] there they were in Dothan and the king
[1:06:24] of Syria was Waring against Israel and
[1:06:26] he took counsel with his servants saying
[1:06:28] in such and such a place shall be my
[1:06:30] camp and the man of God sent unto the
[1:06:32] king of Israel saying beware that thou
[1:06:34] pass not such a place for thither the
[1:06:36] syrians are come down and the king of
[1:06:38] Israel sent to the place which the man
[1:06:39] of God told him and warned him of and
[1:06:41] saved himself there not once nor twice
[1:06:44] therefore the heart of the king of Syria
[1:06:46] was soore troubled for this thing and he
[1:06:48] called his servants and he said unto
[1:06:49] them will you not show me which of us is
[1:06:51] for the king of Israel and one of the
[1:06:53] servants said not my Lord oh King but
[1:06:56] Elisha the prophet that is in Israel
[1:06:58] tell the king of Israel the words that
[1:06:59] thou speakest in thy bed chamber and he
[1:07:02] said go spy where he is that I may send
[1:07:04] and fetch him and it was told him saying
[1:07:06] behold he is in Dothan therefore sent he
[1:07:09] thither horses and chariots and a great
[1:07:11] host and they came by night and
[1:07:12] compassed the city about and when the
[1:07:14] servant of the man of God was risen
[1:07:16] early and gone forth behold the host
[1:07:18] encompassed the city both with horses
[1:07:20] and chariots and his servant said unto
[1:07:22] him alas my master how shall we do you
[1:07:25] can imagine the scene there that was
[1:07:27] happening that morning his servant woke
[1:07:28] up it says he woke up early in the
[1:07:30] morning and you can imagine him now wake
[1:07:32] up early in the morning I guess it's
[1:07:33] Dawn outside uh it's a little dark you
[1:07:36] can't really see and he wakes up he
[1:07:38] hears some stirring looks outside he SE
[1:07:42] movement what is that looks a little
[1:07:44] close looks like horses and chariots oh
[1:07:46] no this can't be right this can't be
[1:07:49] right so he washes his face Tak some
[1:07:52] water no it puts back on his glasses oh
[1:07:55] Elisha he starts to scream he runs to
[1:07:58] his R runs to to Elisha he says and and
[1:08:01] Elisha would say to him he answered fear
[1:08:03] not for they that be with us are more
[1:08:05] than they that be with them and Elisha
[1:08:08] prayed and said Lord I pray thee open
[1:08:09] his eyes that he may see and the Lord
[1:08:11] opened the eyes of the young man and he
[1:08:13] saw and behold the mountain was full of
[1:08:15] horses and Chariots of Fire round about
[1:08:18] Elisha here's what the prophet would say
[1:08:20] notice there was a man with him his
[1:08:22] servant spiritual boy walked and poured
[1:08:24] water on the hands of the prophet
[1:08:26] a great position he had but when he seen
[1:08:28] the Syrian Army All Around Dothan had it
[1:08:31] backed all up he said my father look out
[1:08:33] there what a great number why we're
[1:08:35] surrounded now that's natural yes
[1:08:39] brother said that's natural it's natural
[1:08:42] it's normal to go and look at what you
[1:08:44] see first it's we're only human beings
[1:08:47] it's all we can do many times this is
[1:08:49] what's happening God this this this and
[1:08:52] then come the human reactions then then
[1:08:54] comes the first blow that you have to
[1:08:56] withstand as a Christian and you have to
[1:08:58] say you have to withstand those thoughts
[1:09:00] you have to withstand those feelings you
[1:09:01] have to withstand those emotions and
[1:09:04] after some sometimes you can feel guilty
[1:09:06] in that first wave that first wave of
[1:09:08] natural emotion that first wave perhaps
[1:09:10] angry annoyed uh conflicted uh but you
[1:09:13] have to weather that storm and then once
[1:09:15] you weather that storm there's a seed
[1:09:17] that God placed down on the inside
[1:09:19] there's something that he placed down on
[1:09:20] the inside down there in the soul that
[1:09:22] says no I will trust in the Lord Jesus
[1:09:25] no there's something else happening up
[1:09:27] there now that's the natural when
[1:09:29] everything seems to go wrong pointing a
[1:09:31] finger at you saying this and that and
[1:09:33] the doctor says you can't get well and
[1:09:35] so forth that's just the natural thing
[1:09:37] for you to think oh my this is the end
[1:09:40] but Elijah said there's more with us
[1:09:42] than there is with them now you can
[1:09:44] imagine how that Prophet or that gesi
[1:09:46] felt the servant he looked over at him
[1:09:48] he said why I don't see anybody he said
[1:09:51] God open this boy's eyes how many would
[1:09:54] say God open my eyes to morning to
[1:09:55] what's going on what's going on in my
[1:09:57] life Lord open my eyes just let me have
[1:09:59] a glance let me
[1:10:00] see as soon as God did something here it
[1:10:03] is get it when God opened his spiritual
[1:10:05] sight all around there prophets stood
[1:10:08] Chariots of Fire and angels of fire when
[1:10:10] he seen why the Chariots of Fire
[1:10:12] outnumbered the Syrian Army by the
[1:10:15] thousands in another place in the
[1:10:16] message I found where he said by the
[1:10:18] millions the mountains was on fire
[1:10:20] angels of fire horses of fire Chariots
[1:10:23] of Fire and the Bible said the angels of
[1:10:25] of God and Camp about those who fear Him
[1:10:27] oh how hard it is sometimes when we get
[1:10:29] in trouble when we're alone many times
[1:10:31] the Trials come when we're alone but
[1:10:33] it's in that time when we could say the
[1:10:35] mountains are on fire all around me and
[1:10:38] though all I can see is the enemy all
[1:10:39] around me all I can see is Satan
[1:10:41] attacking me on every hand but while
[1:10:43] something is happening down here there's
[1:10:46] another thing happening in another realm
[1:10:48] the mountains are on fire for the
[1:10:50] children of God angels are all around
[1:10:52] you horses of fire Chariots of Fire amen
[1:10:56] praise the Lord thank remember that
[1:10:58] Elijah when when he went up he had one
[1:11:00] Chariot but Elisha had asked for a
[1:11:02] double portion so when they opened his
[1:11:04] eyes they saw a double portion of
[1:11:06] Chariots there standing with with
[1:11:10] Elisha that's the hard part when
[1:11:12] something's going on down here yes there
[1:11:14] is something going on up there it's hard
[1:11:16] for us to grasp yes very hard to grasp
[1:11:19] when you're surrounded by Syrian
[1:11:21] chariots oh no what are we going to do
[1:11:24] trembling in the flesh but remember the
[1:11:26] flesh is uh the flesh always likes to
[1:11:28] jump first the flesh is the first
[1:11:30] reaction yes then after you weather that
[1:11:32] you remember that in your mind next time
[1:11:34] it happens the first time it happens oh
[1:11:36] anger Rises up the first time something
[1:11:38] happens to you oh confusion uh uh
[1:11:41] annoyance how could this happen a little
[1:11:43] bit agitated but remember that that's
[1:11:46] just the natural part that brother Ram
[1:11:47] talks about that's the first thing that
[1:11:49] happens then after that you weather that
[1:11:52] storm I like to use the example of the
[1:11:54] old tree uh the the first re human
[1:11:56] reaction the wind comes it blows it
[1:11:58] blows the tree it
[1:12:01] bends all the the branches begin to sway
[1:12:04] but then after that subsides the tree
[1:12:07] comes back to the center The Roots gr a
[1:12:10] little bit deeper that's the way it is
[1:12:11] with the Christian that first Rea that
[1:12:14] first reaction will blow you almost Bend
[1:12:16] you all the way over you think you're
[1:12:17] going to break but then something inside
[1:12:19] you snaps you back all right Jesus time
[1:12:22] to get back to church time to get back
[1:12:24] to reading my Bible time to get back to
[1:12:26] listening to the message time to get
[1:12:27] back in fellowship with the Lord Jesus
[1:12:29] Christ I've been out of it for too long
[1:12:31] time to step back into what I'm supposed
[1:12:32] to do as a child of God whether the
[1:12:35] storm get past the natural get into the
[1:12:37] spiritual get past the Earthly and start
[1:12:39] to look into the Eternal
[1:12:41] amen amen thank you another example in
[1:12:44] the Bible we read of these Hebrew
[1:12:46] children how they were down there in
[1:12:48] Babylon they took a stand as they were
[1:12:51] praying they didn't pay attention to the
[1:12:52] king they didn't fear his command they
[1:12:54] were looking for thus sayith the Lord
[1:12:56] and old Nebuchadnezzar up there he'd say

[1:13:00] to do around here we will show them
[1:13:01] whose boss around there uh he wanted to
[1:13:04] burn burn it out of them but you can't

[1:22:36] me amen we read on the day of Pentecost
[1:22:40] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:22:41] come they were all with one Accord in
[1:22:44] one place in one place and suddenly
[1:22:46] there came a sound from where from
[1:22:49] Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and
[1:22:51] it filled all the house where they were
[1:22:53] sitting suddenly there came a sound from
[1:22:55] Heaven you see where this started from
[1:22:57] you see where this originated from and
[1:22:59] when something was going on down here
[1:23:00] they had gotten in one Accord they had
[1:23:02] gotten in one place they had done what
[1:23:04] Jesus told them to do and suddenly
[1:23:06] accompanying that equivalent action in
[1:23:09] heaven here come the sound come from
[1:23:11] Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and
[1:23:13] it filled all the house where they were
[1:23:14] sitting I say if we'll do what Jesus
[1:23:16] Christ wants us to do in in our lives if
[1:23:18] we'll follow his word to the tea if
[1:23:20] we'll follow it to the letter if we'll
[1:23:22] do everything that we can to seek after
[1:23:23] his heart to obey his word to stand for
[1:23:26] him there's an action that starts up in
[1:23:28] heaven when God sees that he respects
[1:23:30] that when God sees his people living out
[1:23:32] his word on the earth he respects that
[1:23:34] there's an action that's happening up in
[1:23:36] heaven and there the disciples had
[1:23:38] gathered in one Accord in one place I
[1:23:40] say can we check all the boxes this
[1:23:41] morning can we get in one Accord can we
[1:23:43] get in one place he said where two or
[1:23:45] three are gathered he would be right in
[1:23:47] the midst with us if he said that then
[1:23:49] he's capable and he's able to fulfill it
[1:23:51] this morning there they had done what he
[1:23:53] said to do and there came a sound from
[1:23:56] Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and
[1:23:58] it filled all the house where they were
[1:23:59] sitting I say God let it be the same
[1:24:01] this morning if we can get in one Accord
[1:24:03] in one place in one mind if we can get
[1:24:05] our mind on the Lord Jesus Christ let's
[1:24:07] let that action start to happen in
[1:24:10] heaven
[1:24:11] amen Grant it Lord there was one day a
[1:24:15] little martyr we call him
[1:24:17] Steven the first martyr in the Bible the
[1:24:20] New Testament dying little Steven
[1:24:22] because he stood there Stern brother
[1:24:24] Steven had been brought into that
[1:24:25] channel where he knowed God he was
[1:24:28] filled with the Holy Ghost the Bible
[1:24:30] said they those Pharisees they would
[1:24:33] they would drag him like a bunch of
[1:24:35] wolves brother brandham said like a
[1:24:36] bunch of wolves dragging a lamb and when
[1:24:38] they throwed him on the ground and took
[1:24:40] great big clouds of rocks and begin to
[1:24:42] beat him on the head with it like that
[1:24:44] little Steven being full of the Holy
[1:24:45] Ghost the Bible said he looked steadfast
[1:24:48] towards heaven raised his hands and said
[1:24:51] I see Heavens open and I see Jesus
[1:24:53] Christ and I see Jesus standing at the
[1:24:56] right hand of God let me find this
[1:25:00] one when a h when any man has finished
[1:25:03] his Works he steps down when I quit
[1:25:05] preaching I set down but not until I
[1:25:07] quit preaching when you're working you
[1:25:09] set down your work is finished Jesus sat
[1:25:12] down at the right hand of Glory but when
[1:25:15] he seen this first martyr dying for the
[1:25:17] cause of Christ the resurrected Lord
[1:25:19] Jesus brushed back the skies and he must
[1:25:21] have raised from his throne to give a
[1:25:24] special welcome to little Steven to
[1:25:25] bring him home brother benus here saying
[1:25:27] Jesus sat down but when he saw what
[1:25:29] Steven did oh that thrilled him so much
[1:25:31] that he that he would that he would step
[1:25:33] off of that Throne a little bit and let
[1:25:35] me give a little welcome to Stephen I so
[1:25:37] enjoyed what he did for me I enjoyed
[1:25:39] that he stood for me I say when we stand
[1:25:41] for Jesus Jesus will stand for you if
[1:25:44] you stand for his word Jesus will stand
[1:25:46] for you every stone that is thrown at
[1:25:49] you God knows about it every stone that
[1:25:51] was being thrown at Stephen God knew
[1:25:53] about it every stone the devil throws at
[1:25:55] you every doubt every every evil thought

[1:26:19] amen I've got just a little bit more to
[1:26:22] go through I hope you're not tired this
[1:26:23] morning amen bless the
[1:26:26] lordes I I'll try to keep going and if I
[1:26:28] hear any tummies rumbling then I'll
[1:26:31] stop might be my own
[1:26:34] rumbling now listen listen as we begin
[1:26:37] to describe this thought now brother
[1:26:39] Braham starts to lay it out negative and
[1:26:41] positive there's something happening
[1:26:44] down here there's something happening up
[1:26:46] there something happening down here
[1:26:48] reflecting what has already taken place
[1:26:50] up there he says we pray God as these
[1:26:53] people are coming to the alter to be
[1:26:54] prayed for seeing that we are here
[1:26:56] negative just the negative the positive
[1:26:59] is just all around us the immortal
[1:27:02] Immortal spirit that was upon us shall
[1:27:04] never die he would say every time I see
[1:27:07] a I see a tree I think that tree is the
[1:27:10] negative there is a positive somewhere
[1:27:13] that tree was made off of something and
[1:27:17] intelligence made it let's follow this
[1:27:19] thought a little bit
[1:27:21] more so we realize that we're here in
[1:27:24] negative form as long as there is a
[1:27:26] negative there has to be a positive
[1:27:29] there cannot be a negative without a
[1:27:30] positive C because it's a it's it's
[1:27:33] because of the positive that makes the
[1:27:34] negative like you had a negative picture
[1:27:37] of some object there has to be an object
[1:27:39] somewhere or to strike the Light Strike
[1:27:41] that lens or there wouldn't be any
[1:27:43] negative so when we see that our life
[1:27:46] here is in the negative and knowing that
[1:27:48] we're in the image of some life
[1:27:51] somewhere then we know that there is a
[1:27:53] positive somewhere that the has struck
[1:27:55] and it's reflected something here on
[1:27:57] Earth he said so when we see that our
[1:28:00] life here is in the negative and knowing
[1:28:02] that we're in the image of some life
[1:28:04] somewhere and here we are going through
[1:28:05] life wondering why doesn't everything
[1:28:07] work out for me why isn't it going right
[1:28:09] why am I not getting everything that I
[1:28:10] want why are my finances not the way
[1:28:12] that I want it but he said this life is
[1:28:14] the negative there's a better life
[1:28:16] coming off somewhere this life we're
[1:28:18] only made in the image of some life
[1:28:21] somewhere Amen brother he would describe
[1:28:24] to us another concept he would say that
[1:28:28] God took a picture of you way back
[1:28:31] somewhere for the foundations of the
[1:28:33] world we're made up of a substance
[1:28:35] that's unseen made material and God will
[1:28:38] give that substance back see it goes
[1:28:41] from a natural something you put your
[1:28:42] hands on to gases from gases into acids
[1:28:45] into gases on back like that till
[1:28:47] finally all winds up to one little thing
[1:28:50] and that is spirit and this Spirit
[1:28:52] occupied these gases
[1:28:54] he said when you become a young man or a
[1:28:57] young woman like God takes a picture of
[1:29:00] you God has that picture of you and he's
[1:29:03] describing all these chemical processes
[1:29:04] that might go into your body to make to
[1:29:06] make you up but he's saying that God has
[1:29:08] a picture of you what he's saying is
[1:29:10] that no matter what happens to this body
[1:29:12] no matter if this body decays goes into
[1:29:14] the ground no matter if you be uh come
[1:29:17] to sickness no matter if this body is
[1:29:19] destroyed God has that picture of you
[1:29:22] and even if it be destroyed the who made
[1:29:24] it has the picture of you and he knows
[1:29:26] how to recreate it and bring it right
[1:29:28] back in the
[1:29:32] resurrection but now this picture is the
[1:29:35] main thing then in the resurrection
[1:29:37] those gases and acids and things come
[1:29:39] right back into the place and develops
[1:29:41] this picture again now this picture was
[1:29:43] not taken when you was 16 or 18 or 20
[1:29:45] years old at best when it was taken when
[1:29:48] was it taken before there was a
[1:29:50] foundation of the world it was put in
[1:29:52] God's Great file then only thing it did
[1:29:55] was featured itself here for you to make
[1:29:57] your choice see then you become a
[1:29:58] servant of God him for knowing it makes
[1:30:00] him a redeemer as we've been through it
[1:30:03] then that picture is absolutely this is
[1:30:05] the negative the negative part of life
[1:30:07] is where you're living now and anything
[1:30:09] if there is a negative there's got to be
[1:30:10] a positive before there can be a
[1:30:12] negative therefore if this is a negative
[1:30:15] there's got to be a positive somewhere
[1:30:17] and this ain't the real thing this is
[1:30:19] only a foreshadow of the real thing that
[1:30:21] is to come now you got it so I don't
[1:30:23] care what they would do with you they
[1:30:25] cannot destroy that profil am you can
[1:30:28] delete your profile picture off of
[1:30:30] Facebook you can delete a social media
[1:30:32] profile uh uh files pictures taken of
[1:30:35] you somewhere can be corrupted but the
[1:30:37] picture that God took of you can never
[1:30:39] be corrupted that one can't be touched
[1:30:41] that one can't be deleted that one can't
[1:30:43] be wiped away that record is up in
[1:30:45] heaven somewhere amen that picture is in
[1:30:48] God's Great Gallery up there it's up in
[1:30:51] God's Great Gallery nobody can sneak in
[1:30:53] there like a thief nobody can can go in
[1:30:55] there and try to erase your name nobody
[1:30:57] can try to to destroy your picture or
[1:30:59] defile it or throw it out it can't be
[1:31:01] done God has that picture of you he
[1:31:03] knows what he's pulling you back to it
[1:31:06] cannot destroy it it's in heaven you
[1:31:08] could burn it up feed it to the lines do
[1:31:10] it any way you want to it'll come forth
[1:31:12] again just as sure as two twos is for
[1:31:15] just as sure as God spoke it it'll come
[1:31:17] forth again it'll come forth so no
[1:31:19] matter where you are here he says it
[1:31:21] cannot destroy it it's in heaven you
[1:31:23] could burn turn it up feed it to the
[1:31:24] lies do it any way you want to it'll
[1:31:26] come forth again no matter what will
[1:31:28] happen to you in this life it'll come
[1:31:30] forth again my God already has the
[1:31:32] picture something already took place up
[1:31:34] there and now whatever happens down here
[1:31:37] I know what I'm going back to something
[1:31:39] has already taking place up there so
[1:31:41] what goes on down here I I don't have to
[1:31:43] worry about it no matter if I should
[1:31:45] lose life or limb God has a picture of
[1:31:48] me up there something already took place
[1:31:50] up
[1:31:52] there amen now remember the thought
[1:31:54] we're trying to bring this morning when
[1:31:56] when things goes on down here there's
[1:31:58] something going on up there the last
[1:32:01] little bit here that I have to read
[1:32:02] before we close now it's a little bit
[1:32:04] wordy I'm pulling out a thought that
[1:32:06] brother Brandon brings in the church age
[1:32:07] book from the sardian church age I try
[1:32:10] to stay with me uh it's a lot of words I
[1:32:12] tried to Crunch it all on the screen
[1:32:14] maybe I shouldn't have but I just wanted
[1:32:16] to show you that this is a thought that
[1:32:18] he's bringing to you and he's bringing
[1:32:19] it to you for a reason now I'll pay
[1:32:21] attention to these
[1:32:22] words now he's talking in the church age
[1:32:25] book about this word bride and he's
[1:32:27] starting to break into election and
[1:32:30] predestination he says now let us go
[1:32:32] another step but before we do let us
[1:32:34] review our case thus far first of all we
[1:32:36] know most assuredly that the purpose of
[1:32:39] God stands in election it was purposed
[1:32:41] in himself it was God's purpose to bring
[1:32:44] forth a people like unto himself that
[1:32:46] would be a word bride amen now listen
[1:32:50] she was chosen before the foundation of
[1:32:52] the world in him she was forn and
[1:32:55] beloved before she was ever brought
[1:32:56] forth during the ages upon the Earth she
[1:32:58] was Redeemed by his blood and can never
[1:33:01] come into condemnation she can never be
[1:33:04] in the Judgment because sin cannot be
[1:33:06] imputed unto her goes on to prove that
[1:33:09] but indeed she shall be with him in his
[1:33:12] throne of judgment judging the world and
[1:33:14] even angels her name each of her members
[1:33:17] was written in a section of the Lamb's
[1:33:20] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:33:22] the world
[1:33:25] written in a section of the Lamb's Book
[1:33:27] of Life before the foundation of the
[1:33:29] world wow something went on up
[1:33:33] there okay secondly there is another
[1:33:35] class their names are also in the book
[1:33:37] of life and they will come up in the
[1:33:39] second Resurrection brother brandom goes
[1:33:40] on to describe uh four total classes of
[1:33:43] people here now you remember in school
[1:33:46] when the teacher would uh stand up and
[1:33:47] she would read off your grades that you
[1:33:49] got in on an exam she said brother John
[1:33:51] you got a 100 brother indigo you got a
[1:33:54] 100 brother Joel you got a when you
[1:33:56] heard your name you didn't really care
[1:33:58] about the other score so much you're
[1:34:00] just so happy oh I got my score same
[1:34:03] kind of thing I'm telling you here your
[1:34:04] name was written in a section of the
[1:34:06] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:34:07] foundation of the world you can rejoice
[1:34:09] and say thank God I got my score scored
[1:34:12] 100 thank God written in a section of
[1:34:14] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:34:15] foundation of the world Hallelujah you
[1:34:17] can praise God you can say no matter
[1:34:19] what happens to me my name is written in
[1:34:21] a section of the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:34:23] before the foundation of the world the
[1:34:25] ups and downs of life don't matter
[1:34:26] anymore my name was already written no
[1:34:28] matter what transpires down here
[1:34:30] something has already taking place up
[1:34:33] there now here's the other classes
[1:34:35] secondly there is another class their
[1:34:37] names are also in the book of life and
[1:34:39] they will come up in the second
[1:34:40] Resurrection such are the foolish
[1:34:42] versions and the righteous as are spoken
[1:34:44] of in Matthew 25 in this class also are
[1:34:47] those who do not worship the Beast or
[1:34:49] become involved in the Antichrist system
[1:34:51] but die for their faith even though they
[1:34:53] are not in the not having been bornn
[1:34:55] again but they will come up in the
[1:34:57] second resurrection and go into eternal
[1:34:59] life here's the third and fourth thirdly
[1:35:02] there are the borderline Christians such
[1:35:04] as we saw in Israel coming out of Egypt
[1:35:06] these had their names in The Book of
[1:35:07] Life and their Works written in the
[1:35:09] books these having failed to obey God
[1:35:11] and being void of the spirit though even
[1:35:14] the signs and wonders were amongst them
[1:35:16] will have their names removed from The
[1:35:18] Book of Life amongst this WOW even even
[1:35:22] the signs and wonders amongst them will
[1:35:25] have their names removed from the book
[1:35:26] of life so you mean that we should not
[1:35:29] seek signs and wonders as if they were
[1:35:31] some Vindication of where our name falls
[1:35:33] on this list rather we should seek
[1:35:35] something else a lot of time people
[1:35:38] people are seeking the gifts of the
[1:35:40] Spirit I say first let's Center our
[1:35:42] lives and seek the fruits of the spirit
[1:35:45] let the gifts be secondary to that
[1:35:47] that's right brother amongst this group
[1:35:49] will be the ones like Judas who though
[1:35:51] entirely void of the spirit but are
[1:35:53] religious will have manifestation in
[1:35:55] their lives and though on the books were
[1:35:57] not the elected in him such also as
[1:36:00] balum will be in that group fourth and
[1:36:02] finally are the ones whose names have
[1:36:04] never been or will ever be written on
[1:36:07] the books now how many might say this
[1:36:10] portion of the word is hard for the
[1:36:12] human mind to
[1:36:14] grasp since this portion of the word is
[1:36:16] hard for the human mind to grasp it must
[1:36:18] be accepted and believed by faith I
[1:36:22] Believe by by fa faith that my name was
[1:36:24] written there on the book before the
[1:36:26] foundation of the world now here here's
[1:36:29] a couple more
[1:36:30] now uh let me just read the the
[1:36:33] highlighted portion thus if God has so
[1:36:35] designed that there be those whose names
[1:36:37] are placed in a section of the Lamb's
[1:36:39] Book of Life and cannot be erased for
[1:36:41] they are the names of his bride then we
[1:36:43] must accept that here's one
[1:36:46] more he said we have the same right
[1:36:49] today in the church names are going to
[1:36:51] be blotted out of the book of life he
[1:36:53] said no names will be blotted out of the
[1:36:56] book of eternal life for that is another
[1:36:58] record though contained in the Book of
[1:37:00] Life skipping down a little bit he said
[1:37:02] now we can see why the redeemed bought
[1:37:04] back by original owner bride she was in
[1:37:07] him as Eve was in Adam cannot ever have
[1:37:09] her member names taken off the Record
[1:37:12] she is part of him she is in the throne
[1:37:14] she can never be judged everyone in the
[1:37:16] Bride is a member of him and he loses
[1:37:19] none but that is not so concerning the
[1:37:21] all in the Book of Life for amongst them
[1:37:23] are even those like Judas who have part
[1:37:25] in the record but their names were
[1:37:27] removed now I read all of this out of
[1:37:29] the church age book so that I could read
[1:37:30] you this quote where brother brandom
[1:37:31] says every name that would ever be on
[1:37:33] the book was put on the book before the
[1:37:36] book was ever written every name that
[1:37:38] was put on the book was put on the book
[1:37:40] before the book was ever written in
[1:37:42] other words the name predates the book
[1:37:44] in other words the name was in the mind
[1:37:46] of God the name was somewhere back
[1:37:48] before the foundation of the world now I
[1:37:50] can say that my name was there in the
[1:37:52] mind of God now I don't have to worry
[1:37:54] about what's going on in my day-to-day
[1:37:56] life now I don't have to worry about
[1:37:58] anything that happens to me I don't have
[1:38:00] to worry about what the devil throws at
[1:38:02] me because God had my name back there
[1:38:04] now I know that my name was written
[1:38:06] there on the book before even the book
[1:38:08] existed so what does it matter the day
[1:38:10] today what does it matter the up and
[1:38:12] downs what does it matter the times that
[1:38:13] I Fallen the times that I fail the times
[1:38:16] that I was discouraged those things
[1:38:17] don't matter anymore cuz I know where I
[1:38:19] came from I know where I'm going back to
[1:38:21] I know that God is pulling me through I
[1:38:23] know he had my name in his mind and if
[1:38:26] this happened if this transpired up
[1:38:28] there it doesn't matter what's going on
[1:38:30] down here now I can look at down here
[1:38:32] and I can say well no matter what's
[1:38:33] going on no matter how discouraged I
[1:38:35] feel as a Christian no matter if I feel
[1:38:38] like I can no longer make it no longer
[1:38:40] if I if I feel like I can no longer do
[1:38:42] it no matter if I feel like I'm not I'm
[1:38:44] not cut out for this no no matter what I
[1:38:47] feel God has already determined it and
[1:38:49] when these things happen down here when
[1:38:51] the discouragement happens something has
[1:38:53] already happened up there and I'm just
[1:38:55] living it out down here no names will be
[1:38:58] blotted out of the book of eternal life
[1:38:59] for that is another record though
[1:39:01] contained in the Book of Life what have
[1:39:03] you done in your life and you'll say
[1:39:04] Lord there's no way you can use me after
[1:39:07] this I failed too bad I I fell too hard
[1:39:09] I fell too far but God would say no
[1:39:11] names will be blotted out of the book of
[1:39:13] eternal life and if your name was there
[1:39:15] God will raise you right back up to
[1:39:17] where you need to be can you see
[1:39:19] election can you see predestination now
[1:39:21] nothing can go wrong in your life but
[1:39:23] something has already covered it up
[1:39:25] there something has already transpired
[1:39:27] up there I can go through my tough times
[1:39:29] I can go through my hard times I can go
[1:39:31] through confusion but I can say God I
[1:39:33] know you'll work it out because my name
[1:39:35] is up there somehow I have to step into
[1:39:37] what you have called me to do in my life
[1:39:39] somehow I'll get there cuz you're
[1:39:41] pulling me through somehow I have to
[1:39:43] match that what's happening down here
[1:39:45] has to match what has already taken
[1:39:47] place up there and that's what I'm
[1:39:48] living to that gives me the confidence
[1:39:50] to wake up the next morning after i'
[1:39:52] I've failed after I've done something
[1:39:54] wrong after I've done it the wrong way
[1:39:56] it gives me confidence to get up the
[1:39:57] next morning and say Lord forgive me for
[1:40:00] what happened yesterday but today is a
[1:40:02] new day today I'm stepping forward today
[1:40:04] I'm going I'm going getting closer back
[1:40:06] to that profile image that you had of me
[1:40:08] before the foundation of the world I'm
[1:40:10] getting closer to what you have called
[1:40:12] me to what you thought that I would be
[1:40:14] doing here on the earth way back before
[1:40:16] the foundation of the world nothing can
[1:40:18] go wrong anymore it secures the
[1:40:20] Christian you're anchored now now
[1:40:22] nothing can happen anymore now you know
[1:40:24] well my name was there I'm going back
[1:40:26] there so whether my path in life goes
[1:40:30] like this whether it goes straight up or
[1:40:32] whether it's nice and steady some people
[1:40:34] seem to have it nice and steady some
[1:40:36] people seem to have it up and down but
[1:40:37] if something already happened up there
[1:40:39] if your name was already thought of even
[1:40:41] before there was a book to write it in
[1:40:42] then it doesn't matter what goes on with
[1:40:44] the up and down eventually God will pull
[1:40:46] you right back up to where you belong
[1:40:49] thank you
[1:40:51] Jesus that's the power of the word of of
[1:40:53] God brother Brandon would describe the
[1:40:55] word like this he would say that that it
[1:40:57] is the prophet that catches what God has
[1:41:00] already said for the word was before the
[1:41:03] foundation of the world God spoke the
[1:41:05] word and it's laying way out stretched
[1:41:08] out in time we're time beings it's hard
[1:41:11] for us to grasp
[1:41:13] this he's saying the prophet catches
[1:41:16] what God has already said amen and you
[1:41:19] think of the power of that statement the
[1:41:20] prophet catches what God has already
[1:41:22] said
[1:41:24] so in other words when we believe the
[1:41:25] message God lays the word out somewhere
[1:41:29] in eternity Prophet comes along in his
[1:41:32] time he goes up and he takes the peak
[1:41:34] what's what's up there oh that's the
[1:41:36] word then he comes comes back down and
[1:41:38] he brings it to us yes because the word
[1:41:40] was already there amen we've got to
[1:41:42] change our frame of mind change our way
[1:41:44] of thinking oh the prophet came back

[1:42:28] wow well I thank you for your pool this
[1:42:31] morning amen I'll end with this last
[1:42:35] little uh quote here brother Brandon
[1:42:38] Begin to talk about uh
[1:42:41] countdown uh it's a real special way
[1:42:44] that he delivered it in the message of
[1:42:46] the countdown you know the uh the horse
[1:42:49] and buggy it could achieve a certain
[1:42:51] speed one horsepower they go down the
[1:42:53] road uh the automobile could reach a
[1:42:56] certain cruising speed uh even today our
[1:42:59] automobiles it's only a certain speed
[1:43:01] that it could reach the airplane can go
[1:43:02] up to a certain altitude and just begin
[1:43:05] to cruise at a certain altitude it can't
[1:43:08] break out any higher than that but then
[1:43:10] he begins to talk about a rocket talk
[1:43:12] about an astronaut talk about a space
[1:43:14] age there's something different about
[1:43:16] that all the other ones they're they're
[1:43:17] pointed on a certain plane but this one
[1:43:19] is pointed a different direction this
[1:43:21] one will break through the stratosphere
[1:43:23] this one will it doesn't reach a certain
[1:43:25] altitude and begin to cruise it doesn't
[1:43:27] reach a certain point and stop it it has
[1:43:29] a destination in mind and then it just
[1:43:31] keeps going until it gets to that
[1:43:33] destination it breaks up and out it
[1:43:35] breaks through every Creed it breaks
[1:43:37] through every Dogma it breaks through
[1:43:38] every doubt every depression it breaks
[1:43:40] through all of that the message breaks
[1:43:42] through all of the denomination it
[1:43:44] breaks through all of the denominational
[1:43:46] World it breaks up and out until it
[1:43:48] reaches into the
[1:43:50] eternity my brother Bram would describe
[1:43:52] EX actly what that rocket was he said
[1:43:56] that was
[1:43:57] Christ and then he would describe how
[1:43:59] that astronaut he would get inside of
[1:44:01] the rocket strap in and then something
[1:44:04] begin to happen a countdown a countdown
[1:44:07] which was outside of his control where
[1:44:10] the Brandon would teach us how man
[1:44:11] counts down from 10 nine eight but God
[1:44:15] he said God throws all that all out of
[1:44:17] the window God has a different countdown
[1:44:19] he's been counting down through the
[1:44:20] seven Church ages Ephesus uh oh got it
[1:44:23] right on the wall there for me thank you
[1:44:25] Ephesus Smyrna pergamus Thera Sardis
[1:44:27] Philadelphia Leo deas God's countdown is
[1:44:30] seven oh but he said get in Christ and
[1:44:33] once you get in Christ you you get
[1:44:35] strapped in you get locked in you're
[1:44:37] inside of this rocket the astronaut has
[1:44:39] nowhere to go he all he can do is sit
[1:44:41] there and rest and wait for the
[1:44:43] countdown and that's exactly what the
[1:44:45] bride is doing she's gotten into Christ
[1:44:47] she's gotten into the word she gets into
[1:44:50] Christ she sits and she waits for God to
[1:44:52] fulfill his word cuz she knows that when
[1:44:54] something is going on down here and
[1:44:56] she's strapped in and she's waiting
[1:44:57] there's a countdown happening up there
[1:44:59] there's something else happening that's
[1:45:01] outside of her control there's something
[1:45:03] else happening that is beyond her there
[1:45:05] something else happening that is
[1:45:06] entirely in the hands of God he knows
[1:45:08] the day or the and the hour he knows
[1:45:10] exactly when he will come he knows
[1:45:12] exactly when it's liftoff time for the
[1:45:14] bride he knows exactly when the day and
[1:45:16] the hour is and all we have to do is sit
[1:45:19] in our seat and get strapped into this
[1:45:21] rocket and to wait and to Believe get in
[1:45:23] Christ he said he said the rocket is
[1:45:25] Christ he he is instructing us do you
[1:45:28] want to get out of here do you want to
[1:45:29] go in a Rapture do you want to make it
[1:45:31] out of this evil age get inside of
[1:45:33] Christ the devil will tell you that
[1:45:34] you're sick and that you're defeated but
[1:45:36] you get inside of Christ and you just
[1:45:38] wait for God's countdown to fulfill his
[1:45:40] word of by his stripes we are healed you
[1:45:43] get inside of Christ and you wait for
[1:45:44] God to fulfill his promises once you get
[1:45:46] inside of Christ then the countdown is
[1:45:48] outside of your control once you get
[1:45:50] inside of Christ down here then
[1:45:52] something begins to take place up there
[1:45:54] God begins to countd down the days until
[1:45:56] his promise is fulfilled in your life
[1:45:59] amen God bless you if we could stand
[1:46:01] together praise the Lord
[1:46:04] amen hallelujah amen can imagine Moses
[1:46:08] mother that morning as she picked up the
[1:46:10] baby and she gave it to the father give
[1:46:13] him a kiss and then Miriam and Aaron
[1:46:16] give give the baby a kiss she put the
[1:46:19] baby in the basket how hard it is
[1:46:21] sometimes for us to put the baby in the
[1:46:23] basket how hard it is sometimes to give
[1:46:26] up our control over the situation and to
[1:46:28] trust that well I'm going to put this
[1:46:30] baby in the Nile something will be going
[1:46:32] on down here but there will be something
[1:46:34] going on up there there that morning she
[1:46:37] put the baby in the
[1:46:38] Nile loaded the basket off down now
[1:46:42] while she had given up
[1:46:44] control while something was going on
[1:46:46] down here there was something going on
[1:46:48] up
[1:46:49] there there the basket would float and
[1:46:52] then would come a crocod here comes a
[1:46:54] crocodile coming and God would say
[1:46:56] Gabriel go down get 10,000 angels go
[1:46:59] down there line line the line the Nile
[1:47:01] River I want you to take care of this
[1:47:02] basket and there the crocodile would be
[1:47:04] about to bite the basket and then a
[1:47:06] Whirlpool would come and suck the
[1:47:07] crocodile through and the basket would
[1:47:10] go on it would get caught up in the
[1:47:11] grasses there and then just about the
[1:47:13] time it was stuck um Miriam was watching
[1:47:16] it was stuck but then just about that
[1:47:18] time Here Come Those Old fishermen they
[1:47:19] were kicking their way through the
[1:47:21] grasses and and they were getting ready
[1:47:22] to throw their rods out and it dislodged
[1:47:24] the basket and it went on down brother
[1:47:26] Brandon would say that while those
[1:47:28] angels were lining that that Christ
[1:47:30] didn't come there at the start he came
[1:47:31] at the end and he was waiting for the
[1:47:33] basket to receive that's the same way
[1:47:35] that God is doing with you this morning
[1:47:37] you might not see him around you but
[1:47:38] he's waiting at the end he's the one
[1:47:40] that's pulling you through the whole
[1:47:41] time he's the one that's giv his angels
[1:47:43] orders to stand guard around you when
[1:47:45] something's happening in your life
[1:47:47] there's something else going on up there
[1:47:49] God bless you let's pray this morning
[1:47:53] Lord Jesus we thank you so much for your

[1:48:10] that amen Lord Jesus just as our eyes
[1:48:13] are closed and our heads bowed Lord I
[1:48:16] would ask the congregation if there are
[1:48:19] any that have perhaps held on too
[1:48:21] tightly Lord perhaps unable to put the
[1:48:24] basket in the Nile or to let go of
[1:48:27] situations if there are any that perhaps
[1:48:29] Lord they've been focused uh too much on
[1:48:33] what's going down here as we raise our

[1:48:38] may you come down in their situations

[1:49:35] moment father if anyone here is in that
