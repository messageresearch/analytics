[3:00] Let's all stand together.
[3:03] Amen. Praise the Lord. Ask brother
[3:05] Jonathan if I just pray over the
[3:07] offering. Amen.
[3:37] Amen. You may be
[3:38] seated. Now to all the visitors who's
[3:42] going, "Okay, this is kind of
[3:45] weird." So if you read in the
[3:47] scriptures, you find out where at the
[3:49] temple they had a box in the back and
[3:54] Jesus stood off the one side with his
[3:56] disciples and he watched people come and
[3:59] put their offerings in the box.
[4:02] So the rich came and gave out of their
[4:05] plentiful. But a widow came. She didn't
[4:09] have much, but she gave it all.
[4:13] Jesus looked at them and he said, "So,
[4:16] which," he asked his disciples kind of a
[4:18] trick question. He said, "Who do you
[4:19] think gave the
[4:22] more?" You know, people are kind of
[4:24] stingy like that. They have a lot. They
[4:28] just don't like giving it
[4:29] away. We have a lot, not so much
[4:33] financially, but also in our lives. We
[4:35] have a lot. We're just afraid to give it
[4:37] all to him. We want to hang on to our
[4:41] part, our dreams, our ideas, and we just
[4:44] need to give everything to him in the
[4:46] offering and let him multiply it. Amen.
[4:50] Amen. In the city where the lamb is the
[4:53] light.
[4:56] Amen. There's a country far beyond the
[5:00] starry sky.
[5:03] There's a city where there never comes a
[5:07] night. If we're faithful, we shall be.
[5:11] There by and
[5:13] by. Is that city where the lamb is the
[5:18] light. In that city where the lamb is
[5:22] the
[5:24] light. That fair city where there cometh
[5:28] no
[5:29] night. I have a mansion over there. And
[5:33] when free from toil and care, I am going
[5:37] where the lamb is the
[5:40] light. Here we have our days of sorrow.
[5:44] But we
[5:46] know that the sun that shines us now and
[5:50] found so
[5:52] bright will be changed to clouds and
[5:54] rain until we
[5:57] go to that city where the lamb is
[6:02] alive. In that city where the lamb is
[6:06] alive.
[6:09] at fair city where there cometh no
[6:13] night. I have a mansion over there and
[6:17] when free from toil and care I am going
[6:21] where the lamp is alive.
[6:25] There the flowers bloom forever. And the
[6:29] day shall be one eternal day without a
[6:35] night. And our tears shall be forever
[6:38] wiped
[6:40] away. In that city where the lamb is
[6:46] alive. In that city where the lamb is
[6:51] alive. In that city where there cometh
[6:55] no
[6:56] night, I have a mansion over there. And
[7:00] when free from toilet care, I am going
[7:04] where the lamb is
[7:07] alive. Here we have our disappointments
[7:11] all the
[7:12] while. And our fondest hopes but meet
[7:16] with bitter blood.
[7:19] Though by night we weep, the morning
[7:21] brings a
[7:22] smile. Ah, in that city where the lamb
[7:27] is
[7:28] alive. In that city where the lamb is
[7:32] the
[7:33] light, that fair city where there cometh
[7:37] no
[7:39] night. I a mansion over there. And when
[7:43] free from toilet care, I am going where
[7:46] the lamb is
[7:49] alive. There the sunlight fade but
[7:52] twilight take its
[7:54] gloom. Not a shadow can my misful soul
[7:59] fright. For I know that up in heaven
[8:03] there is
[8:05] room. In that city where the lamb is
[8:10] alive. In that city where the lamb is
[8:14] the
[8:15] light. In that city where there cometh
[8:19] no
[8:20] night. I have a mansion over there. And
[8:24] when free from care, I am going where
[8:28] the lamb is
[8:30] alive. In that city where the lamb is
[8:35] alive. In that city where there cometh
[8:39] no
[8:41] night, I have a mansion over there. And
[8:45] when free from toilet care, I am going
[8:48] where the lamb is
[8:51] alive. Praise the Lord.
[8:54] Amen. Amen. Let's all stand together as

[9:13] sweet the
[9:15] sound that saved a rat like
[9:21] [Applause]

[9:32] was blind, but now I
[9:39] see. Was grace that taught my heart to
[9:47] fear and grace my
[9:51] fears really.

[9:57] precious did that
[10:00] grace appear.

[10:09] believe. Through
[10:12] many
[10:15] danger, and snares I have
[10:21] already
[10:24] come. His grace had brought me safe thus
[10:31] far.
[10:33] and grace will lead me home.

[10:45] 10,000 years. Bright

[13:56] thing for someone to come out to a new
[13:58] church. You don't know what to expect.
[14:01] Um, but I really feel that this this
[14:04] group is one of the most loving groups

[14:26] Worshiping the
[14:28] Lord. Amen.
[14:35] We had a a little subject that we want
[14:38] to speak on today and it's knowing God.
[14:40] And all of us know God in a in a in a in
[14:43] a measure.
[14:46] But our desire today is to to help
[14:49] provoke us to want to know God a little
[14:52] bit more than we do. Amen.
[14:54] Amen. Before we begin reading here in
[14:58] Isaiah chapter 53, let's look to the
[15:00] author of this book in a word of
[15:03] prayer. Heavenly
[15:05] Father, we thank you that you have given
[15:09] each one of us an
[15:11] opportunity to come to know
[15:14] you. To know you is to know life. And to
[15:18] not know you is to not know life.
[15:22] And so Lord, we thank you that one day
[15:26] you called us. You knocked on the door
[15:28] of our heart. We
[15:30] weren't we weren't interested in knowing
[15:32] you, but you were interested in knowing
[15:35] us.
[15:38] And you loved us. And because you loved
[15:41] us, we could love
[15:43] you. Because you chose us, we could
[15:46] choose you.
[15:48] And this morning, Lord, we are here
[15:51] assembling ourselves together under
[15:55] the the the perfect word of
[15:59] God. And we pray that today as the word
[16:03] would come forth over the pulpit that it
[16:06] would enter our hearts and our souls
[16:10] with a revelation of just who you are.
[16:12] Father,
[16:14] reveal yourself to us and let us to know
[16:17] you in a greater measure. Lord, we pray
[16:21] that when we leave here today that we
[16:24] would be determined to want to grow our
[16:26] relationship more with you.
[16:30] Please bless the reading of the word now
[16:32] as we commit the service into your hands
[16:34] and we give you praise and thanksgiving
[16:37] for this. For we pray it in Jesus
[16:39] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Isaiah
[16:43] 53 verse number one says who have
[16:46] believed our report and to whom is the
[16:50] arm of the Lord revealed and God bless
[16:54] you may be
[16:55] seated who has believed our report did
[16:59] you ever come and tell somebody
[17:00] something and they said I don't believe
[17:04] you so we have that that ability to
[17:08] believe we have the ability not to
[17:09] believe and it
[17:12] I'm sure you've you've all looked at the
[17:16] weather channel and it says it's going
[17:18] to be a sunny day and it's snowing
[17:21] outside if something strange
[17:23] happens. We live in a world of
[17:26] just you never know what's what.
[17:30] And sometimes it's hard to believe
[17:33] certain things, but the one thing that
[17:35] we know that we can believe is the word
[17:37] of God. Amen.
[17:40] But not everybody believes the word of
[17:42] God. And it takes
[17:44] God to show us
[17:47] who who he is and and what what the
[17:50] Bible
[17:51] means. And so the question comes out
[17:55] from God. Who has believed our report
[17:57] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[17:59] revealed? Who has actually
[18:02] showed who who God really is? It takes
[18:06] God to do that. And I want to stick a
[18:08] scripture in here and I didn't tell them
[18:10] in the back but it's Matthew 11 25. And
[18:13] Jesus uh Matthew 11:25. Jesus is praying
[18:17] here to the father and he says I thank
[18:19] thee oh father lord of heaven and earth
[18:21] because thou has hid these things from
[18:24] the wise and prudent and has revealed
[18:26] them unto babe. So there is a group of
[18:29] people that God withholds who he is and
[18:33] then there's a group of people who he
[18:35] reveals who he is. Amen. And I don't
[18:38] want to be part of that group that
[18:40] doesn't know him.
[18:43] I want to be part of the group that
[18:45] knows God and I am depending on God that
[18:48] he will show himself to me. Now the
[18:52] difference between the two groups, one
[18:54] is wise and prudent and the other is a
[18:57] babe.
[18:59] Now, if we had two people standing up
[19:01] here and one was a a wise and prudent
[19:03] man, he would be acting like he's he has
[19:06] it all under control and that he's he's
[19:10] he he he's intelligent and he he's he's
[19:13] got the ability to uh to handle a
[19:17] situation and then if we have on this
[19:19] side another group and this group he he
[19:22] acts like a babe. Well, if we know a
[19:25] babe, a babe is needy.
[19:30] like I I need help to to feed.
[19:36] I I I need help to be cleaned.
[19:40] And so God looks at those two different
[19:42] types of attitudes and he says, "The one
[19:46] that is humble, I give grace to. the one
[19:50] that's has it all figured out that
[19:52] really doesn't need my word. He he he
[19:55] keeps himself from that group.
[20:00] And so our dependency is on the Lord,
[20:03] but it's also on us being in a state of
[20:07] humility that we can receive from the
[20:09] Lord. Amen. Amen. All right. Turn with
[20:11] me if you would to Matthew chapter 16. A
[20:14] little bit further there. Matthew 16:E
[20:16] 13. And we're going to just try to lay a
[20:19] little foundation here. And if I say
[20:22] something that you know maybe just
[20:25] doesn't make a whole lot of sense, we'll
[20:27] just set that aside and you just keep
[20:29] don't stop. You keep eating, right? Keep
[20:32] eating. Matthew 16:13. When Jesus came
[20:35] to the coast of Cesaria Philippi, he
[20:38] asked his disciples saying, "Whom do men
[20:40] say that
[20:41] I, the son of man, am?" So I'm asking
[20:45] for who do people say that I
[20:48] am? And they
[20:51] said some say that thou art John the
[20:56] Baptist, some Isa
[20:59] Elias, and others Jeremiah's or one of
[21:04] the prophets. So there was a lot of
[21:07] possibilities who this man Jesus could
[21:09] be. Amen.
[21:12] And so they had uh there was conflicting
[21:14] reports of who Jesus was. Uh there were
[21:18] similarities,
[21:19] but there were there were conflicting
[21:21] reports and some were truths. The
[21:24] similarities and and some of them were
[21:26] uh obviously false reports.
[21:29] But the arm of the Lord was not revealed
[21:32] to these religious people.
[21:38] And these people, they had the knowledge
[21:39] of the scriptures because they're
[21:41] they're they're comparing prophets,
[21:43] but yet they didn't know who Jesus was.
[21:45] So, a lot of people can go to church and
[21:47] hear the scriptures, but really not know
[21:49] who Jesus is.
[21:52] And Jesus said unto them, "But whom say
[21:54] ye that I am?" Now, he got personal. And
[21:58] Simon Peter answered that thou art the
[22:00] Christ, the son of the living God. So,
[22:02] he had the right answer, but that didn't
[22:04] matter.
[22:07] What mattered is where the answer came
[22:09] from.
[22:11] That's what was important.
[22:14] And Jesus answered and said unto him,
[22:15] "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for
[22:18] flesh and blood have not revealed it
[22:20] unto thee, but my father which is in
[22:22] heaven." You didn't hear these words
[22:24] from a man behind the pulpit.
[22:31] something high up
[22:35] was speaking to your heart as the word
[22:37] came across the pulpit.
[22:40] Amen. There was a connection there.
[22:42] Amen. And that's the only way we can
[22:45] know God is through God.
[22:47] We we can't we can't depend on our flesh
[22:50] and our ability, our intellect to
[22:52] understand God. And we certainly can't
[22:54] depend on the intellect and the
[22:55] understanding of our pastor to know God.
[22:58] Our our dependency has to be on God. And
[23:02] that requires remember this attitude
[23:06] here of I need you. Amen. I need you,
[23:09] Lord. I I am just a babe. I I I the only
[23:13] way I'm going to know you is if by your
[23:15] grace you come down and reveal to me who
[23:17] you are and what you'd have me to do. I
[23:20] I can't be over here just coming in and
[23:22] trying to figure it out.
[23:29] In verse 18, and Jesus said, 'I say unto
[23:31] you thee that thou art Peter, and upon
[23:33] this rock I will build my church, and
[23:38] the gates of
[23:40] hell shall not prevail against it. The
[23:43] word of God is the only thing that can
[23:45] withstand the devil. Amen. The only
[23:48] thing the only thing that cannot prevail
[23:51] against the devil is the word of God.
[23:58] Now, unless God reveals himself to us,
[24:00] we really don't know him.
[24:09] Brother Gideon sent a story to me,
[24:12] little video clip, and it's a true
[24:14] story. And what it was is it was had to
[24:17] be in some city that um next to a church
[24:21] they bought this building and a
[24:24] businessman uh was going to put in a a
[24:28] nightclub there and it was going to be a
[24:31] 24-hour thing where with gentleman's
[24:34] club where girls can girls are there,
[24:37] guys go there and uh well you you know
[24:40] enough of that. So the church um thought
[24:43] that they would get together and they
[24:44] would pray and they would fast about
[24:47] this situation
[24:50] and uh they they prayed that God would
[24:52] just stop this from happening next to
[24:54] the church that that God would move in a
[24:57] supernatural
[24:59] way. And uh during the night through the
[25:03] all night prayer meeting, a a lightning
[25:06] came down and set the the the building
[25:09] on fire and it literally burnt to the
[25:11] ground.
[25:15] And uh
[25:17] so the the
[25:19] businessman, you know, had heard about
[25:21] what had
[25:22] happened and he decided that he was
[25:25] going to take the church to court.
[25:32] and and and and
[25:35] and his his his reasoning was because
[25:38] the church was responsible for my
[25:41] building burning down
[25:47] and and so the before the proceedings
[25:50] took place, the judge brought them both
[25:53] before them and he said, "I want you to
[25:55] know something that this is the hardest
[25:57] case that I've ever ever
[25:59] had. I've got a businessman who believes
[26:03] in God's miraculous power.
[26:07] And then I've got a church who's saying
[26:10] that he didn't do it.
[26:17] Say it again.
[26:24] to really believe in God.
[26:27] We're going to be tested. We're going to
[26:29] be tried.
[26:32] And God will take us right to the limit.
[26:34] He will.
[26:36] But we've got to trust God that he's
[26:38] going to take us through.
[26:41] Sometimes we can go to church and we can
[26:43] go to church for a long time and still
[26:45] really not believe God, God's word, the
[26:48] way we should.
[26:51] It makes you to wonder sometimes when
[26:53] you see people come to church and they
[26:54] they walk away after years who really
[26:57] does believe the
[27:00] report. We're living in a time of
[27:02] identity
[27:03] crisis. Not just who believes and who
[27:06] doesn't believe, but there are men who
[27:07] who think there are
[27:09] women. There are women who think they
[27:11] are
[27:13] men. There are people who think they are
[27:15] a
[27:17] cat, an alien.
[27:22] I I had read that there was someone in H
[27:24] Heartland area that they believe they
[27:25] were they're they're they're from their
[27:28] ancestors were
[27:31] plants or another period of time or
[27:34] reincarnation. So there's these
[27:35] different thought processes out there
[27:39] and because of it people can feel
[27:43] lost, get discouraged because they can't
[27:47] identify with the
[27:50] norm. I'm going somewhere there. So some
[27:53] church facts and I want to bring this
[27:54] together. There are people who who never
[27:57] attend church. Uh the people who have
[28:00] never attended church nearly has doubled
[28:03] over the na last nine
[28:05] years. The people who have never
[28:07] attended church has nearly doubled over
[28:10] the last nine years. The people who
[28:13] attend church weekly has declined by 50%
[28:18] over the last nine
[28:20] years. Of over two billion Christians in
[28:23] the world, less than 30% have ever read
[28:26] the entire Bible.
[28:31] 340 million people live in the United
[28:33] States and only 176 million identify
[28:37] themselves as Christians and nearly a
[28:39] quarter of them view the Bible as a book
[28:41] written by man and not by God.
[28:46] The fact is that over 82% of Christian
[28:48] Americans only read their Bible on
[28:50] Sunday while they're in church.
[28:59] This
[29:00] is this is sad because the Bible is the
[29:04] only book that can tell us who God is.
[29:10] Everyone has opinion who God is. But the
[29:13] Bible is the only book that can truly
[29:15] identify who God is and where we stand
[29:17] with him. Jesus said in John 5:39, he
[29:21] said, "Search the scriptures,
[29:25] for in them you think you have eternal
[29:28] life, and they are they which testify of
[29:32] me." Amen. I would never want to go to a
[29:35] church who preaches out of a different
[29:37] book
[29:39] or preaches without the book
[29:43] or preaches stories that are not
[29:46] scriptural based.
[29:50] Or that just makes you feel good or that
[29:53] makes you feel like you're going to make
[29:55] it.
[29:57] I just want to know what the scripture
[29:58] says. I can make it. I can make a
[30:00] decision whether I'm going to make it or
[30:01] not.
[30:06] And Jesus gave us the best advice their
[30:09] preacher could ever give us. He said,
[30:11] "Search the scriptures.
[30:14] Search them for in them you think you
[30:17] have eternal life. But they are they
[30:19] which testify of me."
[30:22] The scriptures are the only source that
[30:24] can identify who we are, where we came
[30:27] from, and where we're going
[30:30] and whether we have eternal life.
[30:34] First John 5:13, if you want to write it
[30:36] down, the Bible says that the this Bible
[30:39] is written that we may know whether we
[30:41] have eternal life. That's why we got to
[30:44] search the scriptures, that we can truly
[30:46] know. If if my dad I know my dad loved
[30:49] me, I know my mom loved me.
[30:51] And if they just told me, I love you.
[30:54] You're going to go to heaven. Well, that
[30:57] sure is
[30:58] sweet and that sure is
[31:01] nice. But where do they get the
[31:03] authority to tell me I'm going to
[31:04] heaven?
[31:06] And we've all been to funerals. You
[31:09] hardly go to a funeral that that that
[31:12] they say at the funeral that this man is
[31:15] definitely going to hell.
[31:18] Right. You you never go. But Jesus said
[31:21] more go there than they go to heaven.
[31:24] But we don't know
[31:26] that. The fact is is that we have we are
[31:29] not the ones that determine who goes to
[31:31] heaven and who goes to hell.
[31:35] The scriptures tell us who goes and who
[31:37] doesn't go.
[31:39] Right? And I can't know I can't know for
[31:42] you but I can know for me. Right? To
[31:45] whom much is given much is is required.
[31:48] But how important the scriptures are for
[31:50] us. Second Peter chapter 1 verse 20 says
[31:53] knowing this
[31:56] first knowing this first that no
[31:58] prophecy of the scripture is of any
[32:01] private interpretation.
[32:03] You are not allowed to say this is what
[32:06] I think that means.
[32:10] It's no private interpretation. For the
[32:13] prophecy came not in old time by the
[32:16] will of man, but holy men of God,
[32:20] dedicated men of
[32:22] God, spoke as they were moved by a
[32:28] stronger force, by the power of the Holy
[32:31] Ghost, the anointing of God upon them.
[32:34] And when God moved upon them, they pent.
[32:37] And many of these people who wrote the
[32:39] scriptures did not even know what
[32:42] exactly it all meant. But it was still
[32:44] yet God speaking.
[32:48] It's how powerful it is. We can have
[32:49] confidence that this here is the only
[32:52] book in the whole entire world that you
[32:54] can have confidence that is 100% true
[32:57] from cover to cover. There ain't another
[32:58] book that you can have that confidence
[33:00] in.
[33:01] Amen.
[33:02] God has given us his word and we can
[33:04] have confidence when we come to church
[33:06] and we read out of the Bible. We can say
[33:08] amen to the word of God. We can have
[33:11] confidence that all heaven is behind it
[33:13] that God is looking down upon you as you
[33:15] say amen with a with a belief in him.
[33:25] The Bible is the word of God.
[33:29] The Bible is God in word form.
[33:33] The Bible says in John 1:1, "In the
[33:35] beginning was the word,
[33:38] and the word was with God and the word
[33:41] was God." Amen. I mean, that says it
[33:44] like it is. And the word tells us how to
[33:47] have eternal life. Amen. How to become
[33:50] born again and how to have a nature
[33:53] change. It is the only book. It is true.
[33:56] I mean there are other books that that
[33:59] try to help us understand this but it's
[34:02] mixed a little bit with your opinions
[34:04] and things. That is right. But when you
[34:07] read this, even if you don't understand
[34:09] it, let's say you you you basically have
[34:12] a seventh grade education. Let's just
[34:14] say that for a moment.
[34:17] God is able to make all grace abound to
[34:19] you. Amen. If you maintain this, I am a
[34:23] babe and I need you, Lord. Yes.
[34:27] We don't have to wait to be smart. We
[34:30] just I'll tell you what real smarts is.
[34:32] Is fear the Lord. That is right. That's
[34:35] real smarts. Psalms 119. I read this I
[34:39] believe the last couple services 105.
[34:41] The word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[34:45] light onto my path. This Bible is what
[34:48] every one of us tell you. If there's one
[34:50] thing that we have in common that we all
[34:52] need here is this. Amen. Amen. Right. We
[34:56] may not all need to go to to the dentist
[34:58] today and get a a a tooth pulled, right?
[35:03] We may not all be there. We may not all
[35:06] need a new pair of shoes today. But I'm
[35:10] telling you, one thing we all need today
[35:12] is the word of God. We all need it.
[35:16] Amen. Man shall live not by bread alone,
[35:20] but by every word that proceedth out of
[35:23] the mouth of God. Amen. Amen. Jesus said
[35:26] in John 6 uh 63, the words that I speak
[35:30] unto you,
[35:32] they are spirit and they are life. This
[35:36] is a book of life.
[35:39] A book of
[35:41] life written by God that we might have
[35:44] his life. Isaiah 551 just again laying
[35:49] kind of a foundation here. So shall my
[35:51] word be that goeth forth out of my
[35:53] mouth. It shall not return unto me void,
[35:57] but it shall accomplish that which I
[35:59] please, and it shall prosper in the
[36:02] thing wherein to I sent it. Amen. Amen.
[36:06] All right. I want to just talk to the
[36:08] adults for just a second here for a
[36:10] moment. All the parents, I mean, have
[36:13] you ever told your children to do
[36:16] something and they did not do it? Yes.
[36:19] Has that ever happened to you before?
[36:24] And you feel that your
[36:27] word was just made void.
[36:31] It It didn't accomplish
[36:34] what it was meant for.
[36:38] And then it usually brings
[36:41] about some heat.
[36:46] Something inside of you just like my
[36:49] word means more than that.
[36:52] That's right.
[36:55] God's word can never fail.
[36:58] Never ever fail. It cannot fail. Amen.
[37:06] Now, God is not a God to say you're
[37:11] going to make it and you're not going to
[37:13] make it.
[37:16] God's word is whosoever will, let him
[37:19] come.
[37:21] And if you believe
[37:23] this, then it shall prosper in your
[37:26] life. Amen. But if you don't believe it,
[37:29] it's not going to prosper.
[37:33] But the word has been spoken. That's why
[37:36] Jesus said, "If you can believe, all
[37:38] things are possible." To him that can
[37:41] that can believe. Jesus said in Matthew
[37:44] 24:35, "Heaven and earth shall pass
[37:48] away, but my words shall not pass away."
[37:52] Amen. So, even after earth is all over
[37:56] with, we're still going to have this one
[37:58] book.
[38:00] This one book is we're still going to
[38:02] have it. This is what's going to be in
[38:04] heaven. That's right. That's right.
[38:07] But you know also what's going to be in
[38:09] heaven? There's going to be a bride
[38:12] who's going to be the manifested word of
[38:14] God.
[38:16] In other
[38:17] words, she's going to be the living word
[38:20] of God. That's right. Amen. That's why
[38:23] it's important for us to read our Bibles
[38:26] daily. Amen. Amen. In fact, the Bible
[38:29] tells us that this this word is going to
[38:33] judge us on judgment day. Amen. And
[38:35] that's a John 12:48. Let's put that up
[38:37] there so we can read that. John
[38:39] 12:48. He that rejectth me and receiveth
[38:45] not my words have one that judgeth him.
[38:48] The word that I have spoken, the same
[38:51] shall judge him in the last day.
[38:55] This Bible, we can leave church today
[39:01] and reject the word of God today
[39:05] and go on living our lives today.
[39:09] Scary. And it will perhaps not even
[39:13] bother us or our plan for tomorrow or
[39:16] next week. Yep.
[39:19] But when this life is all over,
[39:22] we have to face God with the same word
[39:26] that we heard today at church.
[39:28] That is right. We can't get away from
[39:31] it. To whom much is given, much is
[39:33] required. And it would it would be
[39:36] better just to say, I love the word. I
[39:39] love the word. Be it unto me according
[39:40] to thy word. Amen. So it's imperative
[39:43] that we know God by revelation and not
[39:47] by human intellect or abilities.
[39:50] So in other words, it's very scary to
[39:52] sit in church and to try to figure God
[39:53] out. That's right. To try to understand
[39:56] God in like we would go to a classroom
[40:00] and and and try to understand something
[40:02] in class.
[40:04] But we need to be here depending on God
[40:07] to show us this. Amen. And then that's
[40:10] when revelation comes.
[40:13] So it's it's imperative that we know God
[40:16] by revelations. It's vital. It's
[40:18] important. It's crucial. It's essential.
[40:21] And we cannot know God without
[40:23] experiencing God. That's why we need God
[40:25] to reveal it. Yes.
[40:28] We can go to college and we can learn
[40:30] about botany. Yep.
[40:33] We can go to church and we can learn
[40:35] about the scriptures and the doctrines
[40:36] and yet never experience God. That's
[40:39] true.
[40:41] True.
[40:42] It is impossible to know God the way
[40:45] that we must know him without
[40:47] experiencing him. We must experience God
[40:51] in a nature change.
[40:54] So let me just say it like this. Forget
[40:56] about what we know. Forget about what we
[40:59] can
[41:00] understand. The nature change comes when
[41:04] there is something in your heart that
[41:05] says, "God,
[41:07] I want to please you. Yes. So now we're
[41:10] dealing more with a love affair about
[41:13] knowing God rather than a knowledge and
[41:16] the and the intellectual ability to
[41:19] articulate what the Bible is actually
[41:21] saying. It's two different things.
[41:26] We'll get into that here in just a
[41:28] little bit later. But we can experience
[41:30] God on multiple fronts. Amen.
[41:34] We understand that God makes the
[41:37] blessings fall upon the unjust
[41:42] and he makes the blessings of the son to
[41:44] shine upon the evil and the blessings of
[41:47] his love to comfort his enemy. We know
[41:49] this because Jesus said this is what the
[41:51] father does and he even asked us to be
[41:53] the same way.
[41:55] Yes. So when when even not even
[41:58] churchgoers but people who don't go to
[42:00] church can can can receive blessings
[42:03] from God yet we understand it doesn't
[42:07] change them.
[42:09] So they can experience blessings from
[42:11] God and never be changed.
[42:14] In other words they still remain the
[42:16] same who they are. So they say well I
[42:18] know God blessed me. You know, I spoke
[42:20] through tongues and I danced through
[42:21] here and I did this and God blessed me
[42:23] with a new Cadillac and oh, I was I bet
[42:26] I know God because God has blessed me.
[42:28] No, you don't know God. That's the
[42:31] truth. You can say God has blessed you.
[42:33] But that doesn't mean you know God.
[42:36] You don't know God until your nature is
[42:38] changed.
[42:40] When your nature is changed, then you
[42:42] know God in the way that God wants you
[42:44] to know him. Amen. Amen. I mean, I'm
[42:48] thankful for the blessings, but what
[42:49] good would all those do if my nature
[42:51] never changed?
[42:52] What good would it do?
[42:55] So, we can experience God through
[42:56] blessings, but that doesn't mean that we
[42:59] really know God in a nature
[43:04] change. We can only know God through the
[43:07] process of the new
[43:09] birth. We could get a couple more amens
[43:12] out of that one.
[43:14] Jesus said, "Except a man be born again,
[43:16] he cannot see the kingdom of God."
[43:19] He cannot enter the kingdom of God. So
[43:22] the new birth is a process of a nature
[43:25] change. Amen.
[43:28] Because there's a lot of people that
[43:29] said, uh, I accept Jesus Christ as my
[43:32] personal savior and I got the new birth.
[43:34] That is not the new birth. That is the
[43:37] beginning of the new birth. Amen. But is
[43:41] that is not the completion of the new
[43:42] birth. That's the beginning.
[43:46] So there's a process and that whole
[43:48] process is part of the new birth.
[43:52] And and when when you get to the end,
[43:55] then you'll see that it's a complete
[43:58] nature change. Amen. And and and we need
[44:02] to that that's the whole motive for this
[44:04] this message today is that we that we we
[44:07] seek God to know him more for more of
[44:08] the nature change.
[44:12] Matthew 24 or Matthew 7 21 Jesus
[44:16] speaking here. Matthew 7 21. Not
[44:19] everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord
[44:20] shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he
[44:23] that doeth the will of my father which
[44:25] is in heaven.
[44:27] So you got professors that say, "I'm a
[44:30] Christian that say,"Lord, I got this
[44:32] personal relationship with
[44:34] you." But there's there's Jesus is
[44:37] making this statement. It doesn't even
[44:39] matter what you say, what you call me
[44:42] Lord. It only matters that you do my
[44:44] will. He's sending that message. And
[44:47] then he says in verse 22, "Many will say
[44:49] unto me, in that day, Lord, Lord, have
[44:54] we not prophesied in your name, and in
[44:56] thy name cast out devils, and in thy
[44:59] name done many wonderful works?" And
[45:03] then I profess unto them, I
[45:06] never
[45:08] knew I never knew you.
[45:14] Yet, yet they cast out
[45:17] devils. Yet they did many wonderful
[45:20] works. Yet they said, "Lord, Lord," they
[45:23] even went to church,
[45:27] but they didn't know how important it is
[45:29] to make sure that we know God the way we
[45:32] need to know him.
[45:35] We don't want to be part of the many
[45:38] that come to him in that day and say I
[45:41] thought I thought you know you know let
[45:45] me just say it like this there are
[45:46] millions of people going to church
[45:49] today hearing somebody say you know God
[45:52] you know God and they don't know God
[45:58] but because they're telling them they go
[46:00] you feel good that's the place I want
[46:02] want to go. I want to go to the place
[46:04] where they know I know God.
[46:07] I go to the church that tell me who I I
[46:09] know God.
[46:11] I want to go to the church that that
[46:13] shows me whether I know God or not.
[46:16] Amen.
[46:18] Jesus didn't say find a church that
[46:20] tells you that you know God. He says
[46:22] search the scriptures.
[46:24] They tell you whether you know God or
[46:26] not.
[46:29] I don't want Jesus to profess to me that
[46:31] he never knew me.
[46:36] Man can have all kinds of experiences
[46:38] with God and with the Holy Spirit and
[46:41] never enter the kingdom of heaven. It
[46:43] takes the new birth.
[46:47] 2 Corinthians chapter 5:1
[46:49] 16 ex shows us the end of the new birth.
[46:56] these few verses here. 2 Corinthians
[46:58] 5:16, wherefore henceforth, wherefore
[47:01] henceforth know we no man after the
[47:04] flesh. Yay, though we have known Christ
[47:07] after the flesh, yet now henceforth know
[47:11] we him no more. So,
[47:15] okay, right now we're we're in this room
[47:17] and we got bodies, right? We we see one
[47:19] another. We hear one another. We're
[47:22] communicating in this
[47:24] realm. Well, the corporal body of Jesus
[47:27] Christ is not here,
[47:31] but he is here in spirit form.
[47:38] And the only way we can know him in
[47:41] spirit form is by us connecting with him
[47:44] in spirit form.
[47:47] It's it's not through intellect, but
[47:51] it's through heart.
[47:53] heart.
[47:55] If we're interested in a nature change,
[47:59] then God is drawn to you. It's like
[48:02] you're a magnet. That's what I'm looking
[48:04] for. He's searching for those that'll
[48:07] worship him in spirit and truth. He's
[48:08] looking for the person who is interested
[48:11] in a nature change. Amen. Amen.
[48:15] But that's a greater sacrifice because
[48:17] most people would rather sit in church
[48:19] and learn about God intellectually and
[48:21] feel that they know God more.
[48:24] But that'll take you further away from
[48:25] God because God is interested in a
[48:28] relationship. Amen. All right. Verse 17.
[48:31] Therefore, if any man be in
[48:34] Christ, he is very knowledgeable about
[48:38] the Bible. That is not what the
[48:41] scripture says. Therefore, if any man be
[48:43] in Christ, he is a new
[48:46] creature. Praise God. Can you say amen
[48:49] to that? A new
[48:51] creature. And the old things are passed
[48:54] away, and behold, all things are become
[48:57] new.
[49:01] And all things are of God. Now, this is
[49:04] knowing God right here. This is a nature
[49:08] change. This is the new birth. This is
[49:10] the the culmination of the new birth.
[49:13] And all things are of God who have
[49:15] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[49:18] and is and has given unto us the
[49:20] ministry of reconciliation. And this is
[49:22] this is the beauty when when Christ is
[49:24] so strong in your heart, you just want
[49:26] to share him with others. Yes, sir.
[49:29] The new birth is the only way to enter
[49:31] into
[49:32] heaven. And the new birth is a permanent
[49:35] nature change. Amen.
[49:38] like that word permanent
[49:40] because we've all had a temporary fix,
[49:42] haven't we? Right? I'm going to do this
[49:46] and two weeks later we've not doing it
[49:48] anymore.
[49:50] But when God comes in and he does
[49:52] something in your life, it's real.
[49:57] Most
[49:58] people were not put here to
[50:04] evolve. It's true. Yeah. It's you find
[50:08] this out in in Genesis chapter 3. He
[50:11] that that Jesus said to the woman that I
[50:13] will greatly multiply thy sorrow thy
[50:15] conception and Jesus himself said many
[50:18] go in there at to that Broadway. Few few
[50:22] find the straight gate. Most people were
[50:25] not put here to evolve.
[50:29] That is right. It's true. But they are
[50:32] here to let us know what happens to us
[50:34] if we don't evolve. Amen. We need a
[50:38] nature change.
[50:41] We need to make sure that we're evolving
[50:44] more into the nature of God. Amen. And
[50:47] time is short. It is. I would like to
[50:50] say that all you have to do is come to
[50:52] church and your nature is going to be
[50:54] changed. You're going to become more
[50:56] like a Christian if you come to church.
[50:58] I would like to make that statement, but
[51:00] if I did, I would be a liar.
[51:05] Because if you came to our barn every
[51:07] day, you would turn into a goat
[51:10] or a chicken.
[51:14] So it's not where you go,
[51:17] it's what you put in your heart. Amen.
[51:21] Your heart. So if you come to church
[51:22] with I want God in my heart,
[51:26] then that nature can get changed.
[51:30] So we need to be here with our heart to
[51:32] know God. Amen. All right. 1 Peter
[51:35] chapter 1 verse 22 says, "Seeing you
[51:37] purified your souls in obeying the
[51:41] truth." That's how you do it. In obeying
[51:43] the truth through the spirit unto
[51:46] unfrained love of the brethren. See that
[51:50] you love one another with a pure heart
[51:53] fervently. In other words, let the other
[51:56] person
[51:57] know. Let the other person know.
[52:00] Fervently. Put some heat, some passion
[52:02] behind it.
[52:04] being born again, not of corruptible
[52:07] seed, but
[52:10] incorruptible by the word of God, which
[52:12] liveth and abideth forever. So now we're
[52:15] going to talk about just for a second
[52:17] this born again experience. When we're
[52:20] born again, it's not just us going to
[52:23] other people and saying, "I am born
[52:25] again. God's really in my life. God is
[52:27] really blessing me. Things are really
[52:29] ch, you know, being better for me. I'm
[52:31] I'm I'm I'm just finding that I'm I'm
[52:33] I'm happier now.
[52:38] I think the way we want to describe
[52:40] being born
[52:43] again is that my nature has been
[52:47] changing.
[52:50] I It didn't bother me to fly off the
[52:53] handle
[52:55] because I was just so used to it. Right.
[52:58] But now when it happens, I'm so
[53:00] convicted about it. I'm so convicted
[53:03] about it that I quickly say, "I'm
[53:04] sorry." I actually go into the room, I
[53:07] spend time with God, and I say, "God,
[53:09] help me not to do that no more."
[53:13] Now, this is what it
[53:15] means to have a process
[53:18] of purifying your souls and obeying the
[53:21] truth.
[53:25] And if we exercise that desire, see,
[53:27] because I'm going to say this
[53:29] here, this here is a humble a humble I'm
[53:33] a babe. I need you, Lord. I I can't stop
[53:35] getting upset without you.
[53:38] But this this
[53:40] intellectual, you know, everybody gets
[53:42] upset. I mean, come on.
[53:45] Just like an excuse, like it doesn't
[53:47] matter.
[53:50] and and see so one one is of the
[53:52] intelligence and one is of the heart.
[53:56] God is going to bring a nature change to
[53:58] this person who loves God to love the
[54:00] Lord thy God with all thy heart, with
[54:02] all thy soul, with all thy might.
[54:06] This is who God is after because
[54:10] that's this is the one who's after God.
[54:14] Yes, sir. Right. It's a love affair. God
[54:16] is hidden simplicity and it's about a
[54:18] love affair.
[54:20] I mean, there are people that are going
[54:21] to know this message inside and out and
[54:23] gonna miss the rapture.
[54:25] I hate to say that, but it's the truth.
[54:32] You know, Brother Brandham, they asked
[54:33] Brother Brandham and said, "Will the
[54:35] will the seven seals will the opening of
[54:37] the seventh seal will do something to to
[54:40] to cause us to draw closer to God?" He
[54:42] said, "Absolutely not."
[54:45] No, that is that that to today we have
[54:48] the ability to draw closer to God. Yes,
[54:52] sir. It's all about heart desire.
[54:54] Nothing should need to be
[55:00] said to make us
[55:03] rethink, yeah, I want to be closer to
[55:07] God. Because every single day, God
[55:10] speaks to our heart
[55:12] in some fashion, form or way, and he
[55:14] calls us closer to
[55:17] him. I'm Would you like me to say that
[55:20] again? I will say it again. Every single
[55:22] guy that God speaks to us. Amen. He
[55:25] gives us a chance to draw closer to him.
[55:30] And and if we exercise this, I need you,
[55:33] God. I I want to be more like you. He'll
[55:36] come and give you strength. But if you
[55:38] just intellectually, well, I I just read
[55:41] like 82% of the people, I just read my
[55:44] Bible on Sunday when I go to church.
[55:49] God is calling a bride out of a church.
[55:53] He's calling a people out of a church.
[55:56] And is whomsoever will, let him come.
[55:58] All right. Matthew 22 verse 29.
[56:02] Jesus answered and
[56:06] said, "You do
[56:10] error not knowing the
[56:13] scriptures nor the power of God." Amen.
[56:20] We heir by not knowing the scriptures.
[56:24] That know that's the word that Jesus is
[56:26] telling us.
[56:29] So on the day of judgment when we stand
[56:31] before him
[56:34] and all the people that went to
[56:37] church and they only read certain
[56:40] scriptures, right? John 3:16.
[56:47] He's going to look at them. The blind
[56:49] leading the blind.
[56:52] The scriptures are given to us that we
[56:54] may know that we have salvation. And he
[56:56] told us to search the scriptures. And
[56:58] he's saying here, you do heir not
[57:00] knowing the
[57:03] scriptures. That word heir means roam
[57:06] from
[57:07] safety or truth or virtue. To go astray,
[57:10] to wander, to be out of the way, to be
[57:13] deceived or seduced. The scriptures are
[57:16] the only thing that can tell us that
[57:17] we're right.
[57:21] I don't want to depend on a pope.
[57:25] Even the prophet of this age
[57:27] said, "My words will fail, but his will
[57:30] never fail." Even Paul himself said, "If
[57:34] an angel, if I come preaching any other
[57:36] word than I've already preached, don't
[57:39] listen to me." Amen. If an angel from
[57:41] heaven come preaching anything other
[57:43] than what that word says, don't listen
[57:44] to the angel.
[57:47] We need this word because there's a
[57:49] devil out there trying to deceive us,
[57:52] thinking that we don't have to do
[57:53] anymore. We don't have to give anymore.
[57:55] We don't have to believe anymore. We
[57:56] don't have to give our hearts anymore to
[57:58] God. We we repented. We got baptized.
[58:00] We're saved. That's all that matters.
[58:01] No, that's not all that matters. That
[58:03] doesn't give you a nature change. That
[58:06] is the beginning of your testimony to
[58:08] the world that I've taken a stand for
[58:10] Jesus Christ. Amen. But after that, you
[58:12] got to get up the next day and and die
[58:15] daily. Amen. Prove your love to God.
[58:20] Start your Christian
[58:23] walk. The ne the devil knows the
[58:28] scriptures. He in intellectually
[58:31] believes
[58:34] them. James tells us that he even
[58:37] trembles. The devil believes and
[58:41] trembles. But he's not a new creature.
[58:45] Old things are not passed away. All
[58:47] things are not of God in his life. But
[58:49] yet he believes. So it shows every
[58:52] person that you can believe without
[58:55] changed nature. Amen.
[58:59] And this is scary. It's vital that we
[59:02] know the scriptures through a heart of
[59:04] love.
[59:06] In other words, I love to do what the
[59:09] scriptures say.
[59:15] When I before I really knew God and I
[59:18] heard about like the Ten Commandments,
[59:20] they were
[59:21] like like they were kind of scary to me,
[59:25] right? Like I can imagine like how the
[59:28] children of Israel felt when the Ten
[59:30] Commandments came
[59:31] down. Thou shalt not kill.
[59:36] Whoa. And it was like I'm in trouble if
[59:40] I do any of those.
[59:44] But he said, "I will write my laws in
[59:48] their heart." Amen.
[59:51] God puts a love in our heart to want to
[59:53] do his word. Amen.
[59:56] And it's through the love that you have
[59:58] for
[59:59] God that gives you
[1:00:02] power to be victorious over those
[1:00:05] things.
[1:00:07] Right? We know the scripture that that
[1:00:09] there there there's there's those people
[1:00:12] that have a form of godliness, but they
[1:00:15] deny the power thereof.
[1:00:18] And so they they
[1:00:21] can they know intellectually, but they
[1:00:25] don't have the love to live the life.
[1:00:29] And I I don't I don't ever want to
[1:00:32] separate knowing God outside of loving
[1:00:35] God. They they they they're hand in
[1:00:37] hand.
[1:00:39] The the in fact, if we spent more time
[1:00:42] loving God, we would spend we would we
[1:00:45] would receive knowing God more. Amen.
[1:00:49] You know, there are people that read the
[1:00:50] Bible like a newspaper or a history book
[1:00:54] or or or the Discovery Channel or or
[1:00:57] National Geographic
[1:00:59] and it's like interesting stories,
[1:01:03] but but there's a missing part an
[1:01:05] element of of of a love affair
[1:01:08] that this is really God's love letter to
[1:01:10] me personally.
[1:01:12] That's right. and that God will use this
[1:01:15] word and you've all you've all
[1:01:17] experienced this reading the Bible and
[1:01:20] it just jumps out at you
[1:01:23] like I didn't see that before
[1:01:26] and I I think God speaking to me
[1:01:33] that's when he does that he just wants
[1:01:36] you to walk in that light and as you
[1:01:38] walk in the light as he's in the light
[1:01:41] that's when that new you're in the
[1:01:42] middle of the new birth. Amen. You know,
[1:01:45] so many people they want to they want to
[1:01:47] say, "Well, I did this and this and I'm
[1:01:48] born
[1:01:50] again. I'm born again. I'm born
[1:01:53] again." To me, the new birth is a
[1:01:56] process that happens over a long period
[1:01:59] of time.
[1:02:02] And I I believe this. I believe it was
[1:02:05] happening to Paul
[1:02:07] after 33 years
[1:02:11] after it it just didn't stop.
[1:02:16] Lord, help me to get through this
[1:02:17] because I want to get to some of these
[1:02:20] things here. 2 Timothy
[1:02:25] 3:15. If I don't stay with with my
[1:02:28] notes, I won't get through them. You
[1:02:30] know, that's a pretty common thing with
[1:02:31] me.
[1:02:33] 2 Timothy 3:15. And that from a
[1:02:37] child, so this is just how important it
[1:02:40] is to to have the scriptures and to love
[1:02:42] them with our lives. And that from a
[1:02:44] child th has known the holy scriptures
[1:02:47] from a child which are able to make thee
[1:02:50] wise unto salvation through faith which
[1:02:54] is in Christ Jesus. The scriptures, the
[1:02:56] holy scriptures are able to make us wise
[1:03:00] unto salvation. Right.
[1:03:03] Now this is much different than some
[1:03:06] many churches
[1:03:07] believe. Some churches believe that you
[1:03:10] just from a child, a a baby or young
[1:03:14] child, you come and you you sprinkle
[1:03:17] them and and you you you say a prayer uh
[1:03:21] over them. you baptize them and you you
[1:03:24] there automatically
[1:03:26] saved because you done this
[1:03:31] thing. In other words, they don't even
[1:03:33] need to know the scriptures. But the
[1:03:36] this is telling us, Paul is telling
[1:03:38] Timothy that from a child thou has known
[1:03:41] the holy scriptures which are
[1:03:44] able to make thee wise unto
[1:03:47] salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.
[1:03:51] You remember we must believe before
[1:03:53] we're baptized, right? Yes, sir. Belief
[1:03:57] must preede
[1:03:59] baptism. You don't want to get baptized
[1:04:01] and then believe afterwards.
[1:04:04] You believe first. And as a little baby,
[1:04:06] you can't believe. But when you reach
[1:04:08] the age of accountability, you can
[1:04:10] believe. You can make a
[1:04:11] choice. And if you truly truly believe
[1:04:14] with all your heart, you want to get
[1:04:15] baptized because that he that believeth
[1:04:17] and is baptized shall be saved. And he
[1:04:19] that believeth not shall be
[1:04:21] damned. Amen. And it's it's if we're
[1:04:25] going to get quiet, we're just gonna
[1:04:27] start all over.
[1:04:31] All right. Verse 16. All scripture is
[1:04:33] given by inspiration of God. All the
[1:04:38] scriptures. And is profitable for
[1:04:41] doctrine. Not only to make thee wise
[1:04:43] unto salvation, but is profitable for
[1:04:45] doctrine. Yes, there's doctrine. for
[1:04:48] reproof, for correction, for instruction
[1:04:52] in righteousness. Yes. That the man of
[1:04:55] God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished
[1:04:59] unto all good works.
[1:05:02] Oh, that's what I'm that's what I'm
[1:05:04] pressing into, saints, right there.
[1:05:06] That's that's what I'm pressing towards.
[1:05:08] I I I'm pressing in that I may be all
[1:05:12] that God wants me to be. Amen.
[1:05:15] Now, the knowledge of the Bible, the
[1:05:18] scriptures, if it's not taken in love,
[1:05:21] will only puff a person up. The Bible
[1:05:24] says that knowledge puffs up. It causes
[1:05:27] us to feel that we know God when we
[1:05:29] really don't.
[1:05:31] But love for the
[1:05:33] scriptures, love to live the
[1:05:36] scriptures is is not only able to make
[1:05:40] us wise unto salvation, but that we can
[1:05:42] come to the statue of a perfect man that
[1:05:45] we can become so much in his image that
[1:05:47] God could use us in so many different
[1:05:49] ways.
[1:05:54] Did you ever wish you were talented in a
[1:05:56] certain area?
[1:05:59] Like, have you ever wished that that you
[1:06:02] could cook
[1:06:08] better? Did you Did you ever wish that
[1:06:12] you could just hit a home run anytime
[1:06:14] you got up to
[1:06:15] bat? Like, no problem. I can do
[1:06:20] it. We've all wished that we've had more
[1:06:23] abilities and talents.
[1:06:26] that I wish I was so talented that I did
[1:06:29] not have to call the furnace man every
[1:06:30] time our furnace went down.
[1:06:36] I just saying it like this. The more of
[1:06:38] Christ that you can get into your life,
[1:06:40] the more you can handle problems.
[1:06:44] Said bec because there is no problem
[1:06:46] that Christ can't handle. Amen.
[1:06:50] And the more of his spirit that's in
[1:06:51] you, the more you can handle the right
[1:06:54] way. Amen. Turn with me if you would to
[1:06:56] Philippians chapter 3. And we're going
[1:06:58] to have to hurry because there's already
[1:07:00] pages. Oh my my pages. And I'm telling
[1:07:04] you, pages that we can't get
[1:07:08] through, right? Paul was a man that was
[1:07:12] very, very intellectual. He was very
[1:07:15] smart.
[1:07:17] He knew the
[1:07:19] Bible probably better than anybody
[1:07:21] because he was taught by the best.
[1:07:24] And Paul was not just somebody that went
[1:07:27] to school and I I guess I got to be here
[1:07:31] at school and learn. He had such a
[1:07:35] hunger to know what the scripture said.
[1:07:39] And so as he was being taught, he was
[1:07:41] figuring it out more and more and he he
[1:07:44] understood more and
[1:07:47] more. And so he says here in verse four,
[1:07:49] "Though I might also have confidence in
[1:07:52] the flesh, if any other man thinkketh
[1:07:55] that he have whereof he might trust in
[1:07:57] the flesh, I more."
[1:08:02] He was circumcised the eighth day of the
[1:08:03] stock of Israel, of the tribe of
[1:08:05] Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, as
[1:08:06] touching the law, a Pharisee, concerning
[1:08:09] zeal. He persecuted the church, touching
[1:08:12] the righteousness which is of the law.
[1:08:15] He was considered blameless.
[1:08:19] He says, ' But what things were gained
[1:08:20] to me through all that process in my
[1:08:22] whole life of going to church and
[1:08:24] learning from Galia and and the best and
[1:08:27] he said,
[1:08:29] I those I counted lost for Christ.
[1:08:39] This is so powerful. It is. Whatever he
[1:08:42] learned in the Old
[1:08:44] Testament, he had to relearn through
[1:08:47] revelation.
[1:08:50] He wasn't able to take this intellectual
[1:08:54] conception and make sense with it
[1:08:56] anymore.
[1:09:01] Because when we read the Old Testament,
[1:09:04] it is a type of the new
[1:09:07] and we should be able to see Jesus
[1:09:11] Christ in the Old Testament.
[1:09:14] Yes, sir.
[1:09:18] And so he had to every all his learning
[1:09:22] he just had to and I I just you know how
[1:09:25] much humility that took?
[1:09:29] He had to literally he had to put all
[1:09:31] his churches, all the churches he went
[1:09:33] to, all the seminis, all these DDLs and
[1:09:37] all these certificates of who I am and
[1:09:41] that had posted on it. He had to get rid
[1:09:43] of them all.
[1:09:45] And you know what he had to do? He had
[1:09:47] to become a babe.
[1:09:50] A babe. Lord, I'm depending on you.
[1:09:59] That's the
[1:10:00] secret. That's the secret. Yay.
[1:10:04] Doubtless. And I count all things lost
[1:10:09] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[1:10:10] Christ Jesus my Lord. For whom I have
[1:10:13] suffered the loss. Here it goes again. I
[1:10:16] have suffered the lost of all things. I
[1:10:17] do count them but dung that I might win
[1:10:20] Christ. Amen.
[1:10:22] The only way that we'll win the
[1:10:24] revelation of
[1:10:25] God is by losing ourself
[1:10:30] by coming to him and saying, "God, I
[1:10:32] really need you to reveal yourself to
[1:10:34] me." Amen.
[1:10:35] And it's through that love of I want to
[1:10:38] know you that God just simplicity comes.
[1:10:42] He's hid hid and revealed in simplicity.
[1:10:46] A love affair.
[1:10:48] It it cares about our emotions. That's
[1:10:51] right. You, we could be absolutely sick,
[1:10:53] not even feeling like it, but if there's
[1:10:55] a love, I need you. I want you. God will
[1:10:59] come and be found in him. Not having my
[1:11:02] own righteousness which is of the law,
[1:11:04] but that which is through the faith of
[1:11:06] Christ, the righteousness which is of
[1:11:08] which is of God by
[1:11:10] faith. And this is not doesn't stop
[1:11:13] there. It's a it's a it's a colon. He
[1:11:15] says that I might know him and the power
[1:11:19] of his resurrection. the fellowship of
[1:11:20] his sufferings, being made conformable
[1:11:22] unto his death. If by any means I might
[1:11:25] attain to the resurrection of the dead,
[1:11:28] not as though I've already attained, nor
[1:11:30] perfect, nor but I follow after that I
[1:11:32] might apprehend that which also I'm
[1:11:34] apprehended of Jesus Christ. Brethren, I
[1:11:36] count not myself to have apprehended,
[1:11:37] but this one thing I do. I'm forgetting
[1:11:39] everything in the past, and I'm reaching
[1:11:41] forth for those things that are before.
[1:11:42] I'm pressing towards the mark for the
[1:11:44] prize of the high calling of God in
[1:11:46] Christ Jesus. And let us, as many as be
[1:11:50] perfect, be thus minded. And if anything
[1:11:53] be otherwise minded, God shall reveal
[1:11:55] this even reveal even this unto
[1:11:58] you. So I'm thinking here that
[1:12:02] Paul Paul was definitely probably more
[1:12:05] intelligent in the scriptures
[1:12:08] uh before his conversion than we all
[1:12:11] have are right before we were.
[1:12:15] But he had a little experience with God.
[1:12:18] A it was a personal experience. God met
[1:12:21] him alone and had an
[1:12:25] experience that nobody else had that was
[1:12:27] with him. And that's why we can sit in
[1:12:30] church, God could speak to us and nobody
[1:12:33] else hears it
[1:12:35] because it's it's it's it's a realness.
[1:12:40] And and Paul suffered many things. I
[1:12:43] mean, he was shipwreck. He was stoned.
[1:12:45] He by giving the gospel out he was
[1:12:48] persecuted. When you start sharing this
[1:12:50] nature change with other people, you'll
[1:12:53] get persecuted,
[1:12:54] right? It it's just you you can't do
[1:12:57] there's nothing many uh uh uh they that
[1:13:01] live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:13:03] persecution. The Bible
[1:13:05] says. Now the thing is this did not stop
[1:13:09] Paul.
[1:13:12] Paul never attained, praise God, to the
[1:13:15] place where he said, "I wrote 14 books
[1:13:18] of the Bible.
[1:13:20] I am the messenger to the first church
[1:13:25] age. I have more revelations than all of
[1:13:30] you." And you know what? I doubt whether
[1:13:34] you're going to catch up to me.
[1:13:38] He never projected that spirit.
[1:13:42] He projected his spirit as if you know
[1:13:46] what I'm in a place where I need to know
[1:13:49] him.
[1:13:52] I need to know him in the power.
[1:13:55] He knew him, but he needed he he he
[1:13:58] needed to know him more because he he
[1:14:00] felt he hadn't attained. He wasn't where
[1:14:02] he needed to be that God was calling him
[1:14:04] to. Amen.
[1:14:06] And if we could just be sincere with God
[1:14:08] and come into church and and and be
[1:14:10] honest, are you where you need to be
[1:14:12] with God?
[1:14:15] And are you willing? Are you willing to
[1:14:18] be courageous enough to want to know God
[1:14:21] more? Amen.
[1:14:24] To give your love to God more, to give
[1:14:27] your heart more to God?
[1:14:31] because it's through that process that
[1:14:33] the the nature
[1:14:35] of that the nature of ourselves can
[1:14:38] change more into the nature of God. And
[1:14:40] and I'll tell you what I to be honest
[1:14:42] with you, every person in the
[1:14:45] world, every person in the world would
[1:14:49] love you to act just like Jesus Christ
[1:14:51] as long as you didn't challenge them.
[1:14:55] That's the truth.
[1:14:58] Everybody, I mean, I would love
[1:15:00] everybody to just lay down their life
[1:15:02] for me.
[1:15:05] Just turn the cheek. No matter what I do
[1:15:07] to them, go the second mile.
[1:15:10] Everybody would want that. Just don't
[1:15:13] challenge them.
[1:15:15] Right there is there's the difference.
[1:15:17] So, I just say
[1:15:19] this. By getting our nature changed,
[1:15:21] you're going to be a blessing to
[1:15:22] everybody.
[1:15:25] By this shall all men know you're my
[1:15:26] disciples. Let's stand together. God
[1:15:28] bless you. It's time has passed.
[1:15:45] To know Christ more. Jesus said,
[1:15:48] "Blessed are you that hunger and thirst
[1:15:50] after
[1:15:51] righteousness. I'd say just exercise
[1:15:54] your your hunger to want to know God
[1:15:58] more. Sing that little chord like
[1:16:06] Jesus. To be like
[1:16:12] Jesus. To be like Jesus.

[1:16:38] gloryy. I only
[1:16:42] ask to be like him.

[1:16:52] Jesus. to be like
[1:16:58] Jesus. On earth I
[1:17:01] long to be like
[1:17:06] him. All through life's
[1:17:11] journey from earth to glory.

[1:17:18] I

[1:17:25] desire to be like
[1:17:30] Jesus? To be like
[1:17:36] Jesus. On earth. I
[1:17:39] love to be like him.
[1:17:45] All through life's
[1:17:49] journey from earth to
[1:17:55] gloryy, I only
[1:17:58] have to be like him.
[1:18:05] [Music]
[1:18:06] Amen. I want to I want to know you more.

[1:22:18] Lord in prayer before we enter into the
[1:22:22] fellowship with the food
[1:22:27] and just a good time with one
[1:22:32] another. Every head bowed and every eye
[1:22:35] closed. Maybe there would be someone
[1:22:38] here today
[1:22:45] that says, "I really don't I really
[1:22:47] don't
[1:22:48] know. I really don't know God the way
[1:22:51] that I need to know him. And I know that
[1:22:55] I need him." You want to be remembered

[1:23:25] Amen. Wonder if there would be anyone
[1:23:28] here today that felt God speaking you to
[1:23:30] you today.
[1:23:34] Maybe you haven't been spending as much
[1:23:37] time in the scriptures as you know God
[1:23:38] is wanting you to. And today you you
[1:23:41] you're going to make that decision to
[1:23:43] spend more time reading the reading the
[1:23:45] Bible and your home. Amen. God bless
[1:23:48] you. I'm going to pray for strength for

[1:23:56] Let's believe. Father, we thank you for
[1:23:58] your presence that
[1:24:00] is presently here. presently
[1:24:04] here. Lord, you've you spoke to our
[1:24:08] hearts through
[1:24:10] song,
[1:24:12] through through
[1:24:14] praise, and through the ministry of thy
[1:24:17] word. You have spoken to
[1:24:21] us. And now Lord, you
[1:24:24] are
[1:24:26] are as it were standing to the side
[1:24:29] looking to see who will respond to you,
[1:24:33] who will respond back. And you saw the
[1:24:35] hands that were lifted. You saw the
[1:24:38] hearts that were
[1:24:40] engaged. You see the love inside of us
[1:24:45] that is desiring to draw closer to you,
[1:24:49] Lord.
[1:24:52] Father, I pray for every heart here that
[1:24:55] is desiring to know
[1:24:58] you in greater
[1:25:02] measures to be associated with their
[1:25:05] brother Paul, the Apostle Paul.
[1:25:09] What
[1:25:11] a what
[1:25:13] a a
[1:25:15] glorious privilege it is to be his
[1:25:19] brother with the same spirit.
[1:25:22] to think about that you chose your 12
[1:25:26] disciples and it was a mixed group for
[1:25:30] sure and even Peter who was very very
[1:25:34] close to you the one you gave the keys
[1:25:37] to you knew all along that he didn't
[1:25:40] have a complete understanding of the new
[1:25:44] birth but you believed for him
[1:25:49] and I believe that you are believing for
[1:25:51] us today Lord
[1:25:54] And we thank
[1:25:55] you for seeing us through,
[1:25:58] Lord. That one
[1:26:00] day that we will be just like
[1:26:04] you. Remember the words of Job said, "I
[1:26:08] will I'll not be satisfied until I wake
[1:26:11] in his
[1:26:14] likeness." Lord, we want to be like you.
[1:26:18] Hear the cry of our heart, the desire
[1:26:20] that we have.
[1:26:22] Lord, we want others not to see us, but
[1:26:26] we want others to see you in us.
[1:26:30] Lord, I pray for every heart here, Lord,
[1:26:33] this coming
[1:26:35] week, Lord, that you
[1:26:38] would remind them, Lord, to pick up
[1:26:40] their Bible, to read the
[1:26:43] scriptures, Lord, that you would speak
[1:26:45] out of your word to their heart, Lord.
[1:26:50] And Lord, just show us more what you
[1:26:52] would have us to do.
[1:26:55] Lord, bless our precious
[1:26:59] uh visitors, Lord, that come to to
[1:27:02] sojourn with us today, Father, to to
[1:27:06] hear your precious
[1:27:08] word. Lord, we pray a special blessing
[1:27:10] upon them, oh God.
[1:27:14] Lord, may this word continue to open up
[1:27:17] to their hearts in the days to come. May
[1:27:20] you bring it to their remembrance. May
[1:27:22] it
[1:27:24] unfold and may they see you in a clearer
[1:27:29] way. May they may they hear you calling
[1:27:33] them closer to you, Lord Jesus. What a
[1:27:37] privilege it is to be in your arms. for
[1:27:39] you said that no no no man can pluck
[1:27:43] pluck you out of my hands. What a
[1:27:46] blessing it is to be in your hands Lord
[1:27:48] to be in your
[1:27:50] arms. Lord we love you. We love you and
[1:27:54] we thank you for loving us first. Thank
[1:27:57] you for your love that you placed in our
[1:27:59] heart for you and for your word and and
[1:28:01] for your people, Lord. A love in our
[1:28:04] heart for your
[1:28:06] people. Oh, thank you Jesus.
[1:28:09] God bless our time of fellowship now as
[1:28:13] we as we spend
[1:28:15] time with one
[1:28:17] another. May brotherly love
[1:28:21] continue. May we just draw closer to one
[1:28:25] another as we have drawn closer to you.
[1:28:26] Lord, we thank you for all these things
[1:28:29] now. We pray them in Jesus Christ's
[1:28:31] precious name. Amen. Amen. Let's sing
[1:28:35] that chorus that she's singing playing
[1:28:38] right

[1:28:47] you. More of
[1:28:52] you. I've had it all. But what I need is
[1:28:58] just more of you.
[1:29:03] of things I've had my
[1:29:07] fill and yet I hunger
[1:29:13] still empty and bare. Lord, hear our
[1:29:18] prayer for more of
[1:29:24] you. More of
[1:29:29] you. More of you.
[1:29:35] I've had it all, but what I need is just
[1:29:41] more of
[1:29:44] you. Of things I've had my
[1:29:49] fil. And yet I hunger
[1:29:55] still empty and bare. Lord, he
