[Applause] [Music] I all things are possible Lord I amen amen praise the Lord what a privilege it is to be able to believe amen Jesus said do you now believe amen if you just uh have your seats for a moment I'd like to uh this being Mother's Day I'd like to just read you a couple of things about mothers and then we'll go on into the word and so if you your mother's still with you take the time today if if she's not close to you to call her and thank her for all she's done for you those of us that's lost our mothers it's there's it leaves a place place in your heart that can never be filled I lost my mother in 2005 uh she had gallbladder cancer was a very rare form of cancer and it spread from the gallbladder to the liver and the liver to the bowel and uh she lived about 50 days before she passed but my mother told me I spent a lot of time with her the last few days of her life and she kept telling me she said I can't see past five and I I really didn't know what she was talking about I was giv her a lot of pain medicine you know for the for the liver pain and so I was thinking maybe it was the the morphine and she kept telling me she said I can't see past five and I lost my mother on New Year's Eve 2005 she never saw past five she was telling me that but she was a great mother so if your mother's still with you today just take the time to tell her and I like to share this from the prophet of God if that's okay amen he said this morning it being Mother's Day said I wish to speak a message about mothers I've always said and made this kind of saying to mothers we know written of the four gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John but there's a Fifth Gospel Unwritten and that's mother she gets them before Matthew Mark Luke and John's teaching gets them and mother is so great you know the first one that receives you in this life is your mother no one can touch you because you're conceived and she Bears you under her heart she's the first to know you and the first in this life to hold you amen and when you're born she's one of the first hands that touches you and wipes back the tears out of your eye she's the first one to Pat you and to love you and to cool over you in this life as your mother now I think that there's not enough honor that we could give a mother amen motherhood is so important that the prophet said when you break motherhood you've broken your nation that's right true amen you young people here honor your mother who tries to raise you right and in the midst of all this darkness and idolatry and filth and Corruption of this world I want to thank God this morning for real Godly mothers am young and old that in this nation today when women get out on the streets and demand their rights to murder their unborn children that we have Sitting Among Us this morning real Godly women Whose desire is to serve the Lord and raise their kids to fear God and I'd like to say this morning God bless you mother thank you for all you've done for us am amen amen you can stand this morning I I'd say this about my mama a ain't nobody can whoop you like Mama can whoop you amen I still I deserved every one I got I'll have to be honest I did amen if you have your Bibles this morning turn with us to the book of 2 Corinthians we want to read from 2 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 10 and then also uh Genesis 22 starting at verse 17 and we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and appreciate each one coming out and may the Lord speak to your heart today we appreciate brother John allowing us to come and we ask that you just remember my sister uh theyve gave her just a few days to live and uh but we're just trusting the Lord we know we serve a God who can raise the dead amen there's nothing that he can't do so we just commit her into his hands knowing that his will and his ways are perfect amen amen amen so may the Lord bless you richly this morning 2 Corinthians 6 verse 10 Hallelujah I know you got things planned for mother's day so we'll try to be just as quick as possible I'll preach fast you amen fast amen amen amen I'm just kidding 2 Corinthians 6:10 the Bible says this as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things amen Genesis 22 want to start at verse 15 and the angel of the Lord called into Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and he said by myself have I sworn sayth the Lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore if you've ever been to the beach that's quite a lot and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy amen and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed why because thou Hast obeyed my voice amen am may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word I want to speak to you this morning it's time to possess Amen Let Us bow our heads Heavenly Father we love you Lord thank you for all that you've done for us Lord thank you for mothers today we ask God you bless each one of them richly amen and Lord may you come this morning and anoint our lips to speak your word amen and may it touch every heart dear God for Lord truly we're living in the closing moments of the Gentile dispensation amen and Lord I remember as the thinking of the Titanic God when they made that great ship back in the early 1900s and man's great achievement they stood there and said that nothing nothing could sink that ship amen and yet God by his mighty hand put the Titanic at the bottom of the sea he did and Lord when it struck that iceberg that morning and it begin to sink they realized Lord that a ship that they thought was Unsinkable they had to have someplace to go God as much as we love this nation Lord she's sinking right before us we've got to have someplace to go but Lord we're so glad this morning that a Lifeboat has been given that we can step off this sinking ship onto the Lifeboat of Thy word Dear God and it'll take us safely to the shore oh God this morning may we lay aside everything Lord to obey thy voice even as Father Abraham did bless each one today we commit it into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name and the bride says amen God bless you you may be seated amen now we understand by the scriptures in verse 17 and 18 that Abraham is the father of the faithful amen and we are hirs to the promise through Christ amen amen you see he's the father of the faithful amen and the promise is of our father now Abraham was just an ordinary man and at one time he was actually an idol worshipper did you know that he was actually an idol worshipper so what does that tell us about God that we serve a God who has transforming power now the word transforming means the ability to bring about a dramatic change we serve a God who has the ability to bring about a dramatic change amen he can transform a drunk into a preacher I know that for a fact he can transform a street Harlot to a lady he can transform bitter water and make it sweet he can transform a sinner to a saint he can transform a world that when it was dark and void and make it a Garden of Eden by the transforming power of the almighty God the prophet said that's the transforming power of God that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it God's transforming power he took five biscuits and two fishes of fish and fed 5,000 people he took cooked fish and broke it off amen and it was still cooked fish he took bread that had been broke that had been baked and broke it off and when it came back it was still baked bread what kind of adders did he let loose Hallelujah he was God the Creator amen and he had the ability to bring about a dramatic change God the Creator living in you and giving you all power and in your possession of anything that he had he has given us possession of everything that he is this morning the prophet said if you'll receive him and embrace him and love him and hold him in your heart and love him I tell you the church together in that kind of power has the power to bind Heavens to heal the sick to Open the Eyes of the blind oh Hallelujah the dumb speak the deaf ear the crippled walk the blind see why it's recognizing the power of almighty God into your heart there he is deity dwelling in human flesh and God by his transforming power he's going to take these old frail bodies one day brother s and transform them into young men and women again oh in a moment in a twinkling of an eye he'll bring about a dramatic change by the transforming power of almighty God and you young people here sitting here this morning you're not going to be robbed he's going to take your Youth and turn you into Eternal youth oh God am by the transforming power of almighty God now we understand by the scriptures the Bible that Abraham wasn't looking for God that's right that's right but God came looking for Abraham amen and as Abraham seed this morning we can say the same thing we never sought God it was always God seeking us amen I'll prove it to you by the Bible when Adam the first son was lost who came looking for Adam who came looking for him God did then who comes looking for every lost son and daughter of God God came looking for you Hallelujah I was lost in the darkness but he came and fail me amen hallelujah God looking for you you never sought God but it was always him seeking us because God by his for knowledge knew that Abraham would believe him when he spoke Hallelujah so God sought out Abraham because he knew Abraham would believe him and God sought you out because he knew you would believe him when he spoke amen amen God has purposed and hid it from The Eyes Of The Prudent wise and revealed it to predestinated babes who were predestinated to receive it let me tell you this morning you didn't stagger into this thing I said you didn't stagger into this thing no sir before there was a world before there was a star God knew your name he knew the color of your skin he knew the color of come on somebody I'm not talking about some Disney thing I'm talking about the almighty God this morning who knew us before there was a star and wrote our name in his book Hallelujah and did he come looking for he came looking for his own amen and then stagger into this thing God ordained me for such a time as this Luther had his day Wesley had his day Pentecost had their day with the restoration of the gifts but this is bride time now amen amen that God help us this morning to be the like Abraham who never sought God who never doubted God when God spoke but he always believed God amen amen and God said to him because thou Hast obeyed my voice I have I by myself have sworn God said I swore by myself because there was none greater to swear by amen amen he said I promise you Abraham thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy not maybe not hope so not could be well I don't know oh no but he shall shall possess amen and shall in the Bible is used to indicate a command or an obligation it's not just something well you know it might happen it might not don't know God hallelujah he made a command the same God that said let there be light that same God said You shall possess the Gate of your enemies re in and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and the promises to you and to your children even as far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call it's not a hope so it's not a could be it's a command it's an obligation amen that if we are obedient to God's word God will keep his word to us amen amen what's the matter with you I get excited I can't help it something starts bubbling up inside of me when I think about it brother Trump when I think about it amen Hallelujah the world don't know my name the mayor of this city he don't know my name the governor of Michigan she don't know my name the president of the United States he don't even know his own name I shouldn't have said that forgive me amen he don't know who I am but the go but the God who created the heavens and the Earth He Knows My Name [Applause] amen make a Baptist shout this morning I said it her come on somebody hallelujah it's time we possess what the word says we are amen amen Abraham the prophet said I like this Abraham was heir to All by the promise so he could lay claim to everything he could lay claim to everything that was in the land and the land itself right amen Abraham been given the promise now we understand Abraham was the poorest man in all the country because he lived out in the desert and he lived in peace with God and lot was rich he lived in the city become the governor of the city and he sat in the gate and he was a judge and judged the city and had all the riches and things but Abraham was in the desert the poorest man in the land and yet he claimed to possess it all Lord you imagine going up to somebody that's the poorest man in this County said buddy how you doing can can I give you some money so oh no no that's that's fine I own everything that own somebody you think if somebody would talk like that they they must have lost their mind he did he did lose his mind he got the mind of God hallelujah man when my daughter was struck by a train two of my family was killed and I worked with the doctors I I I worked in surgery assisted for years thousands of operations operated on people I went to church with and I used to tell them I know you inside and out amen so I worked with these doctors and when I went back to work you know after my daughter you know she was left blind and left in the wheelchair and first they told her she'd never live but when I went back to work they told me they said that called me Ward because I work for the government they said Ward said we was worried about you said how come I said they said we we we thought You' lost your mind said because we was telling you that your daughter would never swallow again never walk again never see again and you were saying when she starts walking when she's and said we was talking among herself and said said we're afraid ward has has had a nervous breakdown that he's lost his mind I said I did I did lose my mind because I was sitting in the waiting room about two o'clock in the afternoon and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon me and said your daughter shall live Hallelujah I got the mind of God and when you know what God God will keep his word 100 times out of a hundred amen if God said that you can Bank on it this morning and he told Abraham you are possessor hallelujah amen you shall possess the gates of your enemy amen oh brother said tonight I may not be rich in the world's Goods but we possess all things the church itself possesses all things say that with me the church church possesses possess all things how many how many all amen amen amen I say this to every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus that every person in here was healed when Jesus died at Calvary it's your possession it's not something you're going to get it's not something I wish I had it's something you already possess so I say it's time Hallelujah that we possess that we profess what it is we possess amen amen you know I like Indian stuff my mama

the children and all the rest of them and left the country and in Genesis 14:14 the Bible says when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive think about that brother I like that the prophet said his brother look at what lot had done to him and yet he called him brother yes amen oh let us all learn from that we might not see eye eye to eye on everything but we're brothers during World War II the the Germans had the Americans surrounded and it was in a great battle and so you know I was in the military brother Bill here last night he was also in the military and there's a code of honor among the military that we leave no one behind many a good man has died on the battlefield trying to bring a wounded brother off the Battlefield in this particular battle the Germans was advancing on the Americans and they had to retreat and the sergeant gave the order pull back if we don't pull back we're going to lose everybody said leave the wounded we've got to leave them we'll get them later we've got to go and he turned around and this young boy had this man who was bigger than him heavier than him had him up on his shoulders like a fireman carries you know the the the fireman carryer how they carry him up on the shoulders like that and this man had been shot through the hip and he was bleeding and the blood was was so pourn out of his body that it covered the soldier that was trying to carry him and you couldn't tell which one was wounded they was both covered in blood and the sergeant turned to the boy and he said drop that man we've got to go we'll get him later and he turned around the second time and the boy was still trying to carry this man and the sergeant said drop him we'll come back and get him if we don't pull to the rear everybody will be lost and he turned the third time and the boy was staggered under the weight of this guy trying to get him off the battlefield and the sergeant said as your non-commission officer I command you drop that man he's too heavy right and the boy yelled back sge He Ain't Heavy He's My Brother it was his blood brother and no doubt maybe mama had called him into the kitchen before they was deployed and said look over Junior you know how he is take care of him make sure you bring your brother back home oh that's why I'm here today I'm not in extra popularity I'm not I want to bring my Fallen brother back home amen amen you know one of my favorite characters in history is jono amen I just love him you know he's just a real genuine American they tell the story of drono autobiography they said it took Apache to catch Apache so they hired the they they they they took the White Mountain of paches they're still up there today and they they brought them into the ranks of the army and used them to track down gono and gono they they never captured him he was he just surrendered he was just tired of running 25 years he invaded the United States Army and the Mexican Army and so he finally surrendered and they brought him into St Carlos I've been there many a Time preach the Apaches there and they brought him into St Carlos and when they did the White Mountain of patches that they had used to track him down they called him to attention took their weapons away from them stripped them of the rank and put them on the same train with gono and shipped them to Florida down to Fort Pickins Florida I've been there and seen where they kept gono and on the train according to his autobiography one of jono's Warriors and one of the White Mountain Apaches spoke up and he said you was right not the trust the white eye everything he told us was a lie and one of tono's Warriors spoke up and said I hate you as long as there's breath in my body I hate you so why didn't you leave us alone we was living the way the Creator made us to live this was our land this was our way of life why didn't you leave us alone why did you track us down like dogs said I'll hate you as long as there's breath in my body I'll hate you amen and jono spoke up and saido not hate him there's too few of us left to hate one another amen amen we may not see out eye on everything but we're brothers we need each other when Abraham heard his brother was in trouble was taken captive he went and got him and I want you to notice Abraham's men that they were Farm they were not Warriors they didn't know how to fight they couldn't even spell Kung Fu they wasn't War they were farmers and the Bible said 318 went down after the kings that help lot and his family think about that why would a bunch of farmers being led by Abraham go up against a bunch of kings and their armies right now if the kings are there you think they got the sorest bunch of soldiers protecting the king oh no they've got the best of the best of the best so this Army that was with this King was the best of the best that they had and why would Abraham with 38 Farmers go up against an army like that why would he do that like I said they they didn't know how to fight with swords they didn't they just had holes and rakes and pitch for why would they do that because Abraham had a revelation that God had given him the land and all that was in it and he was acting he was acting on his belief of what God Said was true he was acting on the word of God Amen let me say friends how do we know how do we know that Noah believed God when God said it was going to rain how do we know that because Noah built the ark before the rain ever fell he he acted on what God Said and I'm telling you the hour has now come it's not enough to say I believe the message you must apply the message well I believe I what does that mean it's not enough to say I believe we must act upon our belief for the Bible says the devil believes and trembles and he ain't going to no Rapture well if somebody preach when we'll get done a lot faster that's the truth friends I will I believe what does that mean it's not enough to say I believe it's time we act yes on what we believe amen amen you see God could tell Abraham he was an heir to all the land because he knew Abraham would believe him that's right amen this thing ain't working sure I said God could tell Abraham he was a possessor of all the land because he knew Abraham would believe him this book was sealed with Seven Seals but now the seals have been opened why because there's a people on the Earth who can believe what's in the book glory to God I wish I was down south amen he was a possessor of the Gate of his enemies why because God said so well I don't feel like it feelings has nothing to do with it emotions AE to you Sensations Al lie to you feelings AE to you but the word of God will never lie to you hallelujah amen he was a possessor of the Gate of his enemy because God said so he was a relying on 318 Farmers with pitchforks he was trusting in The God Who made the promis amen I'm not trusting in my ability amen I ain't got no ability but I'm trusting in The God Who made the promis amen Abraham went after his nephew he went after what belonged to himen because he was a possessor of all that was in the land amen Abraham went after what belonged to him amen just like I said last night when God sent Moses down to Egypt he didn't go down there to steal Pharaoh's slaves but he told Moses go down there and tell Pharaoh th sayith the Lord Israel is my son he didn't come to steal slaves he come to get back what was his hallelujah amen amen amen Abraham had a right to the promise and the promise was his yet he had to fight to possess it there you are the believer today we're air to All Things yet we're air to every spiritual blessing every physical blessing every blessing the body bible promises you're an heir to it yet you have to fight for every inch of it listen to me Church never lose your ability to fight am you're going to need it after a while you write it down and see if that ain't the truth America's seen its best days amen you say you hate America oh no I love America I was willing to give my life for this country amen and I do it yet today it breaks my heart I stood out in Sedona Arizona here not long ago those beautiful red rock mountains out there and I wept and I said God I am so sorry for what this nation this great nation that you gave us this beautiful Nation the great lakes and all that God has given us and what have we done oh God have mercy on us amen you have to fight for every inch of it that's the way God's got it set up it's always been that way you have to fight to possess what you know is your own you have to fight to possess it and that's what you've got to do now then I say God give us strength to fight to possess what we already own and let our fight start right here let it start by professing what the word says is ours people come up for prayer and they say well the devil said this and the devil said that and the why don't you tell the devil to sit down and shut up well brother D we teach our kids not to say shut up well tell him to hush tell him something I said tell him something amen amen amen then let our fight start right here it's time to possess what it is we profess and profess what it is we possess it's time to let the devil know who we are am we're not a bunch of Orphans we are not an organization we are come on somebody we are the body of the Lord Jesus represented on the Earth today and he said the works I do shall you do also and Greater Works than you shall you do because I go to the father and send my spirit back upon you Hallelujah and now what Jesus done in one body he healed the sick he raised the dead he opened blinded eyes but now it's a many membered body around the world the dead are being raised bled eyes are being open cancers are disappearing off of people yes sir I'm a witness to it I am a witness of his majesty I've seen him do it hallelujah amen better our fight start right here let it start right here by foraying what the word says we are when Abraham returned from the slaughter of the Kings the king of solom told him take the spoils and Abraham said to the king of solom amen he said I'll not take thread to Sho latch cuz he didn't fight the war to make a lot of money and real true battles are not made with selfish motives amen amen but we're living in such a selfish age oh that's right that's why they'll cut around you at 60 M hour throw on the brakes and turn off because they think they're more important than you are amen you know in 2013 I think it was Webster's Dictionary they pick a word that represents the Western Hemisphere and a word that represents the Eastern Hemisphere because the word that was most used during that year and in 2013 the the Webster's Dictionary or it was Oxford weord yeah dictionary they they picked one word to represent the entire world because this word had influenced the entire world you know what that word was anybody know selfie self oh you know you're guilty you might as well smile selfie because we're living in a selfish age if you don't believe me look it up down in Texas here not long ago there's a woman had a preacher she had a wedding cake she had a wedding dress she had a wedding party the only thing missing was the groom because she married herself look it up you think I'm telling you look it up she married herself because she said there was no one who could love her as much as she loved herself the prophet God said in the last days the true love of God would be replaced with selfish motives that's right we're living in a selfish age amen but real true battles are not fought for selfish motives am amen amen they're not fought for money but they're fought for principles men fight War for principle and when Abraham went out to get lost he didn't go out because he knew he could whip the Kings and take all their possession he went out for the principle of saving his brother and any Minister that sent out under the inspiration of the king of heaven will not go for money neither will he go to make big churches neither will he go to inspire denominations he'll go for one principle and that is to bring back his Fallen brother I've come to this service this morning with the principal to war with the devil not for a name not for popularity but to get my Fallen brother the one that Satan has tied down and say loose him and let him go thank you Lord you see the devil he don't care if you see your prison cell he don't care if you see the bars of your prison cell he don't care if you see the bars on the door of your prison cell but what he don't want you to see is that door is open amen and you can go free amen right amen I was in chac Alaska here a few years ago there's a young girl came up 21 year old she said brother Daryl I'm an alcoholic she said I've been through the nstep program three different times she said I cannot quit drinking she said I've got a little boy that I don't know who the daddy is cuz it was conceived while I was drunk she said I've tried everything she said I cannot quit drinking I said sis have you tried Jesus amen I said you lay your alcohol right here at the altar and you take his deliverance and you walk out of here delivered in the name of Jesus and I begin to pray for that girl I'll never forget it I begin to pray for her brother John she begin to scream to the top of her lungs I'm free I'm free I'm free let me tell you sints of God whom the son hath made free is free indeed I was up there just a couple year ago and she came up to me she said dar it's been over two years and I'm still sober hallelujah hallelujah that's the God we serve this morning Solomon said there's a Time For Peace and there's a time for war there's nothing wrong with fighting if you're fighting for the right principle he said when I was reading down at Tombstone the other day in the museum and I saw the picture of Dono and many of you might think that Dono was a renegate but to me he was a genuine American he was only fighting for that which was right that God had give him a land and a nation and a place to live he said I don't blame him and when those white soldiers coming there force and taking over the land and killing him out like a bunch of flies and there was the original picture Dono his medical headquarters or his hospital it was two or three blankets over a piece of mqu and the wounded real genuine American Indians fighting for their god-given rights amen and that was drawn about with a baby of his own on his hip standing there looking about his own Warriors bleeding and dying with no penicillin or nothing and no way to to help them a genuine god-given American then you call him a renegade he said I call him a gentleman amen fighting for what God had gave him I say it's time Hallelujah that we war against the enemy for what belongs to us fighting for something that God gave him a land and a nation and a place to live we're not Waring for selfish motives but Satan took some of our possession and I say it's time that the Church of the Living God Rises up it's the time for Seed of Abraham to rise up and get back what Satan has stoed for us declare war on all hell and his demons you need to tell the devil This Means War you need to let the devil know you can't have my increase you can't have my family you can't have my health This Means War brother benam said the American Indian lost this land because they was divided among themselves it's always Satan's tactic is to divide and and Conquer do not let him divide us amen that's right he tries to divide over skin color he he tries to divide over religious ideals he even and we know it's true he even tried to divide us over vaccination amen you know it's the truth people got fighting mad because they did or didn't get vaccinated well preach I'm trying to amen but I say don't let him do that I say Seed of Abraham unite ourselves on the Promises of God's word don't unite on my opinion don't unite on my ideal but unite yourself on the word of God we are the Seed of Abraham through the promise that God swore to Abraham that thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy amen you say I need healing the promise is yours but if you ever get it you ain't going to get it easy I'm going to tell you that you got to fight you're going to have to take it away from Satan Satan captures your health you have a right to go to Satan and say give it back hand it over I come in the name of the Lord possessor of heavens and earth and I am his air amen give it back you took my child you got to mixed up with the wrong boy you took my boy got it mixed up with the wrong girl but I claim them I claim my children I claim my brother I claim my sister I claim my father come on somebody it's time we stand up amen give it back amen amen amen amen Satan took him out there from God's house coaxed them out there but I'm coming after them I claim my children the devil ain't going to get my children he ain't going to get my grandchildren I claim them amen amen when we leave here we leaving no hoof behind amen I claim him well how do you know CU I'm an heir of all things it's given to me I'm an heir and joint hirs with Jesus Christ can I have a few more minutes we are joint heirs with Jesus Christ now you know there's a difference between being an heir and being a joint air did you know that you see an heir an heir received something from their father like for instance me brother John and brother Samuel are brothers and our daddy dies and we go for the reading of the will and daddy gives brother Samuel the farm he gives brother John the Cadillac was spinning hubcaps like that didn't you and he gave me a goat now am I an air I am I got something from my daddy but it's obvious Daddy had a problem with me I have to call my brother see if I can feed my goat goat have to call Brother John see if I can take the goat put it in his car to get it over to the farm but we're HS but that's different than joint air a joint air Hallelujah they share the inheritance together that means whatever daddy gave brother Samuel that's what he gave me that's what he gave brother John and whatever God gave Jesus we are joint asss with Jesus Christ that means whatever he got from the father that's what you got when you come on somebody when we get the Holy Ghost we don't get a different holy ghost from a prophet from the pastor no sir there's one Holy Ghost Hallelujah and the life that Jesus had come back upon the church on the day of Pentecost and that life he said I live I will live in them and I will walk in them and they Hallelujah and I will be their God and they shall be my people amen am hallelujah oh do you love him amen I am a joint air with Jesus Christ that means whatever the father gave Jesus that's what he gave me I can claim everything that God promised me I can claim my health I can claim my Revival I can claim my victory amen amen like I told the story last night of the book review and the this guy was giving a book review he was telling everybody what this chapter meant and what that chapter meant and there was a guy in the crowd every time he'd say now chapter three means this he would speak up and say that's not right and finally the this guy that was giv the book of youw he got so upset he said who do you think you are he said I've read this book I'm a great professor at the University I studied it I know I've read this book I can tell you what the author was trying to say who do you think you are who are you and the man spoke up and said I'm the author I'm the one that wrote the book and what I'm trying to tell you today this is not my idea this is not my opinion I'm trying to tell you what the man that wrote the book said the man that wrote the book Hallelujah he said you can have joy he said you can have peace he says you can have healing he says you can to have your family come on somebody every promise in the book is [Applause] mine you need to serve noce on the devil you ain't getting my children you're not getting my wife you're not getting my husband I will fight you tooth and nail amen amen if the devil knocks my teeth out I'll gum him to death amen praise the Lord my papa Johnson my mama's Daddy he was a Golden Gloves boxer out of Knoxville Tennessee he boxed under the title of Doughboy Johnson now Doughboy is what they call the World War I soldiers and that was he was in those days is a young man and he fought under that title of a doughboy Johnson and my mama was telling me when she was about 17 16 something like that that Papa on him had bought her a new dress to go to Knoxville for this fight so she put on her new dress never wore and she goes down there and said when the fight you know the guys coming into the ring said the guy that was going to box my papa was much bigger had a a bigger reach and a bigger Fist and my mama said it made me nervous I was afraid my Daddy's going to get hurt she said I went down to my daddy and said Daddy said just forfeit this fight tonight let's go home said don't fight that man say he's going to kill you I said Mama what did he say she said he didn't listen hard-headed men so he got in the ring so about the second round she said that man knocked your Papo with an uppercut knocked him Plum out C he went through the ropes landed into the second row people got up to get out of his way she said I went running down there said there laid my daddy on his back like that said his nose was broke it was turned up towards his jaw blood pouring out of his nose and she said I started crying and she said I took the corner of my new dress I don't know what that is but some of you sisters may know say she I took the corner of my new dress and wiped the blood off my off my daddy's face and I said Daddy please let's go home let's just forget about it let's go home the man's going to kill you I said Mama what did he say he didn't listen said he climbed back in that ring she said I couldn't even hardly watch it I was so nervous I said after two three rounds she said guess what I said what she said your Papo knocked that man out and won the fight Lord she said he raised up and he took his gloves and straightened his nose and went back in that ring and I think it was two or three rounds later he knocked the man out and I thought oh God give me courage like that if the devil knocks me P me to the second row God give me Grace to get up and get back in the ring because according to the Bible I am an overcomer I am a winner I Am What God Says I Am amen when he offered up Isaac in Genesis 22617 he said thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy now that's the natural Seed of Abraham was Isaac so through Isaac the seed of Isaac we find out they did possess the Gate of their enemy the natural seed it's in the Bible how do we know that because God said they would and the natural types the spiritual amen amen amen so we see them that according to the N like like Joshua now brother B say God given every sick person in here Divine Healing every one of you Jesus was wounded for our transgressions with the stripes we were healed it's yours but you have to fight for every inch you possessed everywhere The Souls of your feet travel God told Joshua I've given you Footprints means possession then let's move in tonight let's go in Footprints his possession let's take every inch of ground that God's give us if you haven't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost Peter said the promise is to you believe it step out on it Footprints is possession let's go get what's ours Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever let's possess it the works I do sh you do also let's possess it you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost let's possess it there's going to be a Rapture let's possess iten these are our god-given rights in an age when everybody wants their rights ain't that something everybody wants the rights but they want to deny us of our rights you know it's the truth friends true you ain't see nothing yet it's going to get worse and worse amen these are our god-given rights it's God's promise don't look at the circumstances don't look at how hard it is don't look at the storm look at the sun that's up in Charlotte North Carina the other day as's a storm come in we sat out there 30 minutes to take off because it was raining so hard and finally we got permission to leave and we went up through the clouds that plane was shaking and a dropping and a bumping and oh my but a few minutes we broke through the clouds and guess what was there the sun it was always there but the devil wants you to see the clouds but don't look at the clouds see the sun the s o n amen amen you got to possess the thing that you professed it to have amen you've got to get it we've got to take it it's ours but you have to fight for every can we possess what it is we profess Joshua fought for every Instagram from one end of the country country to the other but he had a promise God said I give it to you whether there's Giants whether there's atheists whether there's infidels co- formal churches what difference does it make God give the promise let's take it it's ours it belongs to us it's our possession now you go out there get in your car and somebody stole your hubc caps you're going to be calling the police because you paid for them hubcaps and they cost a lot of money and you want them back and yet we'll set in service after service and let devil Rob us sitting right here in service amen I say it's time we call 911 on the devil amen you know that's the truth friends you might as well say Amen somebody breaks into your house steals your microwave you going to call somebody amen it's ours let's go get it don't be afraid don't stay back and say well I you know brother darl I don't don't do that that's a hybrid Faith let's take the land amen do you love him this morning declare of the war on Satan go get back what he stoed from you amen amen the Hebrew children let's look at it just a minute let's just look at it here we'll wrap it up but the Hebrew children possessed the gates of the fiery furnace we're going to look at just for a few minutes just a couple of people the natural seat of Abraham who believed the promise and possessed the land now these children this fiery furnace the King was so mad at these Hebrew boys that he heated up the furnace seven times hotter than it ever been heated amen now what why did he do that cuz he was mad he was so mad and so upset that he heated up that furnace seven times harder than had ever been heated and he commanded his men to throw these boys into the fiery furnace and the furnace was so hot the men that threw them in died from the fire amen you talk about insanity this King was so upset he destroyed his own people trying to destroy God's people and let me tell you the devil will destroy his own kingdom trying to stop this bride but he will never stop this bride it ain't going to happen and they threw those boys in the fiery furnace now here's the miracle you see God didn't take the fire out of the furnace the fire was still there but what he did he took the Heat and the smoke out of the fire you say how can you say that because you see he was so upset if he looked into the furnace and the fire was out what do you think he would have done he would have reled amen but when he looked in there it was still burning but they were walking around because our God took the Heat and the smoke out of the fire amen because the seed these Hebrew boys said we are the Seed of Abraham amen and not even the fire could burn them because they possessed the Gate of their enemy Daniel possessed the gate at the lines did amen did now these lines were used to human flesh they likeed the Taste of human flesh and they threw Daniel in this line then with no way out that's right and them lines looked at D said my God this is a Happy Meal nowhere for him to go amen but Daniel was the Seed of Abraham and he had the promise that his seed would possess the Gate of the enemy So Daniel stood his ground against these Lions right now if you'll study lines you'll know that a line's Roar is between 110 and 114 decimals 120 decimals will permanently damage the human ear that's how loud the roar is 110 to 114 decimal a lon's roar can be heard five miles away and these boys are right here in front of Daniel now when a li before he takes his meal he'll Roar to let somebody know this is my steak but the Bible say is that God shut the mouth of the Lions and Daniel standing there and that Pillar of Fire between him and the lions and when the Lions went out to roar roar when they went out the roar all that came out was meow the prophet said they went over and laid down in the corner and meowed like kittens oh God look at Samson now the prophet said Samson was a shrimp a mama's boy another place he said he was a yes you see you see pictures of Samson with all these muscles there's no mystery why he could do that with all those muscles but Samson he sort of kind of look like me know just he couldn't even spell muscle and I worked in surgery and people on construction that would pick up wheelbarrows of brick or concrete I've seen them pull this muscle loose from the bone and they would come into surgery and we'd make an incision and we' take that tendon and take like a 1050 staple and reattach it to the Bone and sew them up in 68 weeks later they was healed but they would just pick up a wheelbarrow of bricks and rip that muscle out of their arm but the Bible says that Samson when he seen he was g in he picked up the gates of the city and according to they say the gates weighed I believe it was 8 tons a piece or something like that and this man who was a mama's boy picked up not one gate but two gates about 16 tons of weight and picked them up on his shoulders and carried them up on the hill and sat them down and said you boys W you Gates come up here and get them because he possessed the Gate of his enemy but I'm thinking about another one before we close another seed Jesus Christ The Royal seed and what did he do he took all the gates of the enemy he took the Gate of sickness sickness cannot exist in his presence neither can anything else exist in his presence a funeral possession cannot stand in his presence what did he do Joshua died Moses died all the rest of them but not this Royal seed death couldn not stand where life was the woman from n came out with her boy stopped and said he raised up the son that girl that was dead gyus his daughter he spoke a word back Yonder into the unknown world out there and said daughter arise and Lazareth who was in the grave four days dead his body was rot even his sisters said Lord his nose is done caved in but he stood there a man who had been four dead four days and he said Lazarus come forth amen and he broke the seals of everything his precious Soul descended into hell where I ought to have went but on that third day Samson taken the Gate of the city on his back nothing to do with this he took the gates of hell he took the gates of the grave and everything else he didn't pack it up on the mountain he destroyed it he possessed the Gate of the enemy the atmosphere was filled with devil power above Angels or nothing else could come down there could be no intercession because the blood of goats would not take away sin but his own blood took away sin and he ascended up on high and led captivity captive and gave gift to men now everyone of Abraham's seed that's willing to pay the price amen and be filled with the Holy Ghost and stand the test we are possessors of the Gate of every enemy he possessed every gate the Gate of sickness the Gate of death the Gate of Hell the Gate of Temptation the Gate of the Grave he possessed every gate and freely give it to us and it makes us more than conquerors through him that loved us amen This Means War in this anniversary 23 years of this church as you start this New Year let this be the time that we say This Means War it's time we possess what it is we we profess what it is we possess you need to tell Satan this year you are under my feet amen you need to let the devil know you are under my feet This Is My Land This is my promise this is my inheritance I'm an heir to everything he promised me amen amen you need to let the devil know you're under my feet he said well brother Daryl you know I'm the least of the least of the least I'm I'm the skin on that little toe right there where it touches the foot that little crease that's who I am in the body of Christ and maybe that's who you are that may be exactly who you are but if that is who you are guess what every devil is still under your feet do you love him at shamard shamard could say I am the Seed of Abraham every year the Philistines would come in 600 of them would come in slap him around take his crop leave him with just enough to plant he was feeding his enemy year after year he was feeding his enemy and when you say I'm no good and nobody loves me nobody cares for me you're feeding your enemy come on somebody amen amen but this year when they came in to take the crops they failed to realize there was another seed that had come to maturity and shamard said I am the Seed of Abraham this is my land and God promised my father Abraham that his seed shall possess the Gate of the enemy and when those 600 Philistines they come marching in I'm closing right now they come marching in you tell oh you shamard come out and play his wife said oh Shard don't go out there they're going to beat you up again just let them have what they want just let them have what they want just just stay in here oh no not this time he said I am the Seed of Abraham and this is my land and he reached over and he reached up there and there was an ox goat an ox goat was a piece of wood with a brass knob on the end of it that used to push the animals through the Corral and he reached up and grabbed that Ox coat he threw up the window and he jumped right out the window and his wife fainted oh godm he had an ox they looked at like some
