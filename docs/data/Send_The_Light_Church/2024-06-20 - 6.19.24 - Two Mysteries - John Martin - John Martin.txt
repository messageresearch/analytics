Standing on the Promises of God Amen that's a perfect place to be standing at church is on the Promises of God amen amen we know the enemy is here he's trying to nudge us off amen but we're going to stand firm on the Promises of God tonight amen amen God bless you good to be in the house of of the Lord if you'd like to turn with me in your Bibles to Mark chapter 4 Mark chapter 4 we're just going to have a few verses today uh for opening scripture and then we're going to have a quite a few scriptures tonight I hope that's okay amen amen yes amen I got to get my I got to get all turned on Amen amen let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer our heavenly father we want to thank you for the blood amen that gives us access Lord to you that we can become in harmony with you we ask Lord Jesus that there would be nothing in the service today that would hinder any of us from being able to not only hear from you but to be connected with you to be able to receive uh for what promises we're standing upon today amen Lord we ask that you'd remove every Spirit of Doubt every every Spirit of of of of what has transpired uh today of what is going to transpire uh tomorrow and help us to see what you're doing uh in in our hearts and our midst at this time father we ask you bless the reading of the word all things be spoken Lord May It Be You may you give me the grace to stand out of the way that you may speak and help your people we pray now in Jesus Christ name amen amen Mark chapter 4 we're going to read three verses there starting with verse number 10 and when he was alone they that were about him uh with the 12 asked of him the parable and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them that are without all these things are done in Parables that seen they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted Ed and their sin should be forgiven them amen God bless you may be seated well we see here that God purposely uh when he speaks he's speaking to a group of people that he wants them to understand and to another group that he doesn't want them to understand amen um now a loving God why would a loving God want this well we know the world is full of people who want to be saved and yet be able to live the life that they want to live down here and God knows who those people are we don't so we preach the word when we share the word with others when we come to church when we're listening to the tape the word is preached as if all who hears it are the seed but we know that some don't quite catch it amen now that word mystery it means secret it's secret just like the Bible says in in in the last days that uh during the the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of God would be finished or the secret of God would be finished amen a mystery is something uh the dictionary tells us is something that is difficult or sometimes impossible to understand or explain Paul said that he spoke the wisdom of God in a mystery amen and and and tonight we want to talk about two Mysteries and I I there's going to be a lot of things um and pardon me wish we'd break it up into two but I just need you to be strong with me because um I want to I think this could help all of us and the two Mysteries I want to talk about is the mystery of iniquity and the Mystery of godliness because they they're kind of opposing forces amen now the uh the mystery of iniquity iniquity if you Webster defines it as a gross Injustice or a wicked act a gross Injustice or Wicked act and it when we would think about that we would think about somebody that would be doing something that would just go be doing something wrong right a wicked act but there is a little bit more to that definition and brother Bram said in the message the angel of the Lord he said iniquity is something that you know that you ought to do and you will not do it amen so the actual Wicked act now becomes not doing the will of the lord it's an actual Wicked act to not do the will of the Lord amen and there's a mystery in this remember the Bible talks about balum he was rebuked for his iniquity the dumbass speaking with a man's voice forb The Madness of the Prophet right so when we think about balum was his iniquity because he went after the money he wanted the reward was that the iniquity no the iniquity was he forsook what God told him to do right amen and that's how the the the devil gets all of us he places some sort of reward right right puts a reward out there balam fell in love with the ra with the wages of unrighteousness brother brenham's not brother BR I'm gonna read a quote from brother Brandon but brother Gideon sent me this quote couple hours ago and he wanted to greet everybody I just got a a a sentence here a little bit before he gave it to me and he said in in the last age which is our age we'll find this in Samar Church age he says we find the blackout of the word the complete apostasy ending in the Great Tribulation amen he says if you are true seed if you are truly B baptized with the Holy Ghost right you will esteem his word above necessary meat and you learn to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God he uses that word yearn in other words it's no longer well I hope I don't come to church and hear something that makes me you know no you want to hear everything that God wants you to do there's a yearning there amen and he said this is my Earnest prayer for all of us may we hear what the spirit is bringing from the word for us today turn with me if you would to Ezekiel 28 I want to go to the beginning of where this iniquity really all started Ezekiel chapter 28 verse 12 I want to say uh I want to welcome uh Debbie sister Patricia's mother-in-law our stepmom I'm sorry um to be with us today God bless you it's a joy to see you we think of you from time to time uh are you still living in Florida yes okay so you got some floods down there we heard of sou of you amen well we need to always be in prayer one for another amen amen Ezekiel 28:12 says son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyus and say to him thus sayith the Lord God thou seals up the s full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty now this is describing Lucifer I want to catch this it's the sum when we think of the sum it's the the entirety the wholeness and it said seal it in other words it's complete it was full of wisdom and it was perfect in Beauty amen we just heard a minister come and preach for us it was really good everything that God created was good amen eler was good as well he was good he was perfect in Beauty when God created a body for himself the Bible says there was no beauty that we should behold but when when God created Lucifer he wasn't only beautiful he was perfect in Beauty you could look at him and say he was different than everybody else perfect in Beauty he was full of wisdom so what does that mean that means he was pure Peaceable gentle full of Mercy full of good fruits without partiality without hypocrisy we could say Lucifer was full of the goodness and the love of God brother John where are you getting this from I'm getting this from the Bible he was perfect he was the pentacle above all the other Angels amen we're talking about the mystery of iniquity verse 13 thou has been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was thy covering the Sardis topz Diamond burel onx jaser a sapphire Emil con uh carbunco and gold and the workmanship of thy tablets and thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created Thou Art the anointed cherub that coverthe soul God did this he knew what he was doing thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou was walked up and down the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the day thou was created till iniquity was found in him what a mystery what a mystery he was perfect and then there was iniquity what what happened it's a mystery but it affects all of us he was absolutely perfect until iniquity was found inside of his heart at one time iniquity wasn't there and then the next minute it was there a mystery of iniquity and we're going to talk about how it works because it happens to all of us amen amen amen amen I say that again amen amen it happens to all of us amen now until this point there was no evil or no Wicked act to do yet iniquity was found in Lucifer so what happened in his heart in his heart he made a decision I am going to stop doing what God wants me to do that was it God wanted him to to worship Him right to to put him first in his life and to be an example to the other angels and to help them in in giving God first place in heaven that was the will of God and he's he in his heart didn't want to do that no more now he didn't go out and go do some what we would call a wicked thing he just kind you know I don't think I need to do that I think I can just sit here and let everybody else worship amen I'm just you know I'm just choosing I just kind of want to do my thing come on I hope you can see this amen there was a turning point a turning point as soon as he entertain the thought of not doing God's will is when iniquity starts for not just him but for all of us as soon as we decide I don't need to do that I don't need to make that right I don't need to prepare I don't need to I don't need I don't you you you we read the message we listen to the tapes but yet we don't need to do it now you tell me if that's not iniquity amen when Jesus himself said to whom much is given much is required amen but we're going to see why it doesn't seem like it's that big a deal and this is it's just very very tricky Isaiah chapter 14:2 so this is what was happening in his heart how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which this weaken the Nations and he's doing it big time today he's weakening the Nations more than he ever has for thou has said in thine heart this is where the iniquity was found I will Ascend into the heaven I will exalt my throne above the Stars I will sit upon the Mount of congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the couds I will be like the most high now when we think of God we think of someone who's in control amen created everything well he pedal his idea to Eve that you can control your life you can make your own decisions she went for it the same thing that he pedals to us Lucifer had free more agency that's right and that's what makes conceiving iniquity in our lives so dangerous so easy for humans no wonder James reminded us to make sure that we really are searching for the will of God in our lives amen he said go to now ye that say today we're going to go here in this city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gained say you don't know what the tomorrow is going to be our lives of vaporous smoke it comes for a little bit then it leaves you ought to say if the Lord will amen we're going to live and and we're going to do this and we're going to do that he says but if you don't do that he says now you rejoice in your Bings all such praise the Lord is evil all such rejoicing is evil when you I'm going to do this H and then he ends it with this in verse 17 James 4 if you want to write it down 4:17 therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin amen I'll say it's iniquity now Lucifer did not get kicked out of heaven as soon as he conceived iniquity in his heart right and God is not going to c k kick us out as soon as we get iniquity in our heart soon as we conceive it he's not going to kick us out I'm going to say there's a transition period a time where there's more than one desire in our heart mixed feelings mixed emotions mixed ideas mixed desires but eventually the desires for anything else but but God in your heart will take over God in your life remember that statement I know it's a strong statement but we we listen to the devil too much and think it's okay to have these things in our life a little this is not that bad I'm telling you desires outside of God are dangerous amen very dangerous David said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want that's that's just it amen keep God first amen Jesus said he also that receiveth seed among the Thorns is he that heareth the word and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches they choke out the word right and he becometh unfruitful amen you would think the word is greater and it's Prevail look when it comes to free more agency if you don't choose God from your heart you're on your own God is not going to take you you've got to get to a place where you get those other things out of your life and it's got to be your choice I thank God that we can come to church and hear the word and make a choice what we want to do that's what I'm thankful for that we have a chance second Timothy tells us that in in this age I'll say it in every Church Church there are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God there's a mixture and and and and God's not going to Prevail because when we first came to God we gave up Pleasures we gave up the world we invite them back in what's where's that put God we're choosing them above God now another mysterious element to iniquity is that God allows it to be in our lives without dealing uh dealing with it harshly in other words if we we come to church and we're in tune with him we're prepared we'll hear the word and it may be just a still Small Voice he won't knock us over the head bring this overwhelming conviction just a little word and if we don't yield to it we could walk out the door and think everything's okay amen must be okay with God and this is what's so dangerous God allowed Lucifer to take his time in heaven to walk up and down the midst of the stones of the fire talk to all the Angels pedal his idea of doing your own will instead of God's and God never stopped him and God will never stop stop us because it's free more agency free more agency the Angels Jew said which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation I'm going to show you at the end how we're going to get out of iniquity we're going to get out of it but you need to see that we're choosing to go in it and God ain't going to just stop you you want to live like that you want iniquity in your life he'll ow it Ezekiel 28:16 says by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst with violence and thou is sinned therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the Mountain of God I will destroy the oh covering cherubin from the midst of the stones of fire thy heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou was corrupted thy wisdom notice corrupted thy perfect wisdom that's from above by the reason of thy brightness you thought you were something special when we look at our abilities that God has given is as if something we created in ourselves we can be tempted to be lifted up in our hearts as well thou has corrupted thy wisdom by the reason of thy brightness now instead of him having pure wisdom his wisdom became polluted it became selfish full of conf confusion instead of him being Peaceable his wisdom became corrupted with better envy and and strife instead of being gentle it became full of violence he was just violent with his body violent with his mouth violent with his intentions yet it was wisdom it was just the wisdom that been perverted from the wisdom of God to now the Wis wisdom of Satan instead of being full of Mercy he was once full of Mercy he became defiled and he his he started having partiality oh I like these third of the Angels more than these twoth thirds are you with me amen full of hypocrisy all by the reason of his own brightness and his own ability he took this god-given reason and corrupted it to the wisdom of Satan look at me angels there's none like me I can do my own will and God won't even kill me look he's over there he hasn't killed me he knows what's going on he's allowing it a lot of times we think God ain't doing nothing mean to me it's okay that I'm doing this see there's a transitional period to where he allows things to happen before the the blade comes down what is that thing called verse verse uh 18 thou has defiled what thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities and by the iniquity of thy traffic I mean there's so much there's so much iniquity in the churches we talked about it in our men's meeting today there's so much sin and iniquities in the church it's like a traffic jam you can't hardly go and and and set your foot in a church and find the the purity of the word of God there I mean we are blessed the problem that we have is we're standing in the way of receiving from God he pedal his iniquities right inside the church we don't have to do God's Will and we can still be the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm in the message see this all is happening now inside the heart it's not something we verbally say but it happens inside the heart the mystery of iniquity is working right inside the churches today 2 Thessalonians 2:7 write this one down 2 Thessalonians 2:7 for the mystery of iniquity doth all ready work now notice this only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way notice that Freemore agency iniquity is going to stay inside somebody who lets to stay inside somebody until the appointed time the mystery of iniquity doth already work the mystery that you can be fre forgiven of your sins cleanse wash set aside for the service of God and at any given time find iniquity inside of you it happened to Lucifer and it happens to Believers it's a mystery Jesus said that in our day the inqu would abound it would escalate it would increase so much that it would cause the love of many people to wax cold indifferent self-centered I don't need them are you with me all because of one thing iniquity inside the person's heart no other reason because I don't I don't care if the whole world is evil God in you won't make you be indifferent come on you know we just get to a place where we don't want to be with the Believers we don't want to help the body we don't want to step in and do what we could do to help we're just I'm glad God was not like that towards me I'm glad he stepped in and helped me the churches are full of people who want a basically a one-sided relationship come on how come I'm not hearing more amens now a one-sided I want the blessings of God I want God to help me I want God to meet my needs what about doing what God wants us to do am you got people that rely on what they've achieved they rely on the gifts that God has given them they rely that they're in a message Church they rely that they believe every part of the Bible mentally Jesus said not everyone that saith Lord Lord is going to enter in doesn't matter what wonderful things that we did he said I will profess to them I never knew you depart from me ye that what work iniquity so you're working not doing what you know you should be doing not doing not going to the bars and you know drinking pot and taking drugs not that just not doing what Christ asked you to do last service the last time you read the Bible the Last Time You Prayed and conviction came you knew it was him that little bitty thing that started in Lucifer grew to something that we all hate today brother uh Marty brought the message in the men's meeting today and it it was on pride and really pride is what makes us say I don't need it's not that important I don't need to do that we're we're taught by Jesus himself that we have to live by every word of God every word so it's a mystery of iniquity it does already work it doesn't matter how many past victories we had how many deliverances how many Works we've done how many times we've been forgiven iniquity can find its way into the heart of a Believer if we do not follow the word in fact once iniquity is set in it can become more more stubborn it'll be easier not to do things you miss a couple Services all of a sudden it's easy to miss a couple Services where at one time you make a decision I'm GNA put God I'm gonna every time those doors are open do you know iniquity weakens a person Psalms 31:10 if you want to write it down Psalms 3110 for my life is spent with grief and my years with sign my strength faileth because of my iniquities my bones are consumed my strength faileth because of mine iniquity brother baham said in the power of transformation he said what is Iniquity David said if I conceive iniquity in my heart God will not hear me think about that just the conception just just now making that little thought I don't need to do that I don't need to make that right I don't need to be nice I'm just gonna be in different as soon as you conceive that the word of God tells you God will not hear your prayers amen now that's strong the brandham said and you if you want to write that down that's Psalm 6618 iniquity is something that you know that you ought to do and you won't do it you know better but you won't do it see it's iniquity what iniquity does in a person's heart is it keeps you it keeps God from moving in your behalf you know you got to make sure that all the iniquity is out that's number one just get it out brother man makes a statement God is not obligated to to to tell you anything more to reveal anything to more to you until you first walk in the light that he gave you and to me when I sin when I sin I make a mistake I I um conceive iniquity into my heart if i and God speaks to me if I don't make that thing right how can I expect God to do anything more for me that's what the word is for the word comes and it it's a light to our path it shows us how to live we're not looking for a church that fits our idea we're looking for the word so we can know how to fit God's ideas Jesus said in Luke 6:46 why call me Lord Lord and do not the things I say good question he's really not Lord is he if we're not doing what he tells us to to do he's really not Lord how many loves your tongue good how many sometimes hate your tongue wow James said even so the tongue is a little member and it boasts great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity right out of the mouth so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and sth on fire the course of Nature and it is set on fire of hell just this you ever say something and you're just like oh you just felt so yucky afterwards that is the Fulfillment of the scripture here it just defiles your whole body every every kind of the Beast the birds and serpents and things in the sea is tamed and have been tamed by mankind but the tongue can no man tame no man can do it it's an unruly evil it's full of deadly poison Bible talks about a man that cannot Bridle his tongue see it takes the Holy Ghost to come inside and I want to get to that that that's the power through the the the mystery of godliness can take take care of that but he says therewith we we bless God even the father and therewith we curse men which are made after the similitude of God out of the mouth it precedes blessings and cursings my brethren these things ought not to be but we allow them we allow it you know what we say we say hey we're all human hey you know everybody does it to me we we just we we make every excuse instead of saying Lord come inside of me and control this tongue tame this tongue I can't do it but I know you can Lord fill me with your spirit see it's got to go through free more agency and I'm sorry if you're too proud that you can't call on God and say God take this evil thing out of me and fill me with more of your spirit God how can God come inside he wants you to humble yourself right the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now lth today if you will hear his voice and Harden not your heart see if somebody's got a hard heart it's because they hardened it they rejected the word I don't let anybody control my heart nobody look many times we've let the wrong things in our heart we've been hurt our heart belongs to God God will never hurt you he may want you to suffer to help somebody but that ain't hurting you that's just doing the work of the Lord right we may have to crucify our flesh so God can have his way but that ain't hurting us but sometimes we let the wrong things into our heart and then we become hardened and the biggest thing that we let in our heart is our will nobody's going to tell me I can't cut my hair I can't listen I can't do this nobody's going to tell me we just Lord not my will thy will be done the key to get rid of iniquity is just not asking for forgiveness it's taking a stand against it in your life we are so used and look I thank God for the blood but brother Brandon brought us a message that should open our eyes it's called the token and when it's the Life of Christ that comes into a Believer it's no longer you anymore it's God in you Christ in you the hope of glory now the word can become manifested so I say this if you want iniquity out of your life you've got to take a stand against it take a stand against it don't let Disobedience stain your life don't say it's not that big a thing everybody does it well maybe everybody ain't going in the Rapture second Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knows them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity that's free more agency it doesn't say be delivered it says depart make a choice I want to start doing everything God wants me to do you know I don't care if they call me a goody goodie a Holy Roller I don't care what they call me I want to do what God wants I yearn to do the word of God I'm a real believer I've heard the voice of God I love that Psalms 32:1 write this one down David said blessed is he whose transgression Is Forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and whose Spirit there is no gu so blessed is the man who the Lord will not take in we know that there's many people that are come in in in that day and say Lord Lord didn't we prophesy cast out devils and do all these works in your name but he still is taken invatory of their iniquity but there's a group of people a group of people who depart from iniquity yeah they still committed it David still committed it but he departed from it he just didn't say Lord forgive me but he departed from it and the Bible says blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute iniquity I love that how many love the word in the message the former and latter Reign now for those that have not said very much during the service the the rest of the service is your your turn is your turn in the message former letter r brother brand says now you and I can have no more God in us than what we can yield ourself wow did you know I can be full of God today and grieve the Lord tomorrow and he can stay away from me as long as I do my own thing you got to abide in the vine it's not one of these things where you know we we we repent get baptized and we're so sealed up with the Holy Ghost that nothing we can do is wrong I want I'm stressing this because brother Brandon really makes a point you and I can have no more of God in us than what we can ourselves as much as brother brandom can get out of the way God will come in but as long as William brandom is there God has no way of getting in and it's the same with you he said it's getting ourselves out of the way not looking the way we think not doing the way we think but letting him do our thinking let him do our looking and listen to the Holy Spirit The Mystery of iniquity does already work no matter how long you've been in the message iniquity can set in any time no matter how far along you are in God the latter however you want to say it iniquity can set in any time no matter if you have a heart just like David did for God iniquity can set in at any time for the mystery of iniquity death already where only he who now lth will let we're in control we're in control so as long as I let it in my life it's there when I say I don't want it there I want to do what the Lord wants me to do then it gets out he see God works through free more agency he doesn't have robots iniquity is nothing to play around with the mystery of iniquity is that something perfect can become contaminated amen that's the mystery at any time by allowing ourselves not to obey some part of the word get away from that thinking of well I follow most the word that's all you know God you know he's grading on a curve iniquity is so mysterious it has power to take a Sanctified life and pervert it with just a wrong attitude but what else has a mysterious power is godliness I want to try to take the rest of the service and talk about this so please pray for me 1 Timothy chapter 3 verse1 15 the mystery of godliness the first half was stay away from what can bring you down and discourage you and this half is what we need to yield ourselves to so that Christ can become manifested in our life and he says here in 1 Timothy 3:15 but if I T long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and the ground of the truth and without controversy no debate great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh wow you know when iniquity is in our life that's Satan manifested in the flesh but when godliness is manifested is in your life and it's in your life God has manifested you sisters praise God you don't cut your hair that's God manifested In the Flesh right you Brothers you don't toss and swear and your mouth profanity and you keep yourself pure that is God manifested In the Flesh God was manifested justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into Glory the mystery of godliness is when God can come inside your flesh your flesh and manifest himself instead of you get out of the way John Martin I've made a decision it's in my heart I made a decision I just want God there I want him in my life that's it I don't need no special oils I don't I I don't need to go on a 40-day fast don't misunderstand me I just need to make a decision I really want God preeminent in my life I want God to take control right and I know it's not a One-Shot deal I pray this prayer today and is good for the rest of the month it don't work like that because Satan is trying to get other Desires in your heart trying to bring confusion to your life if iniquity can come inside of us at any time and corrupt us that means godliness can come inside of us anytime and clean up our life clean up our habits clean up our our Behavior the way we talk to one another God can come inside us any time and manifest godliness I like that if Satan can come in God can come in if Satan has power to do it through deception trying to get us things that we don't really shouldn't have that means God can come inside of us and take control it's the mystery of godliness all right 2 Timothy 3:1 this know that in the last days perilous time shall come just stay with me for men shall be lovers of their own self this is what's happening in the church today Covetous bolsters proud blasphemers disobedient appearance unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors hey High minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God now look at this verse five having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away now notice a form of godliness is missing something just like hope is missing the sub that faith has well a form of godliness is missing something that real godliness has godliness has power yes it is the power of God inside of you but a form of godliness doesn't have power so it can act like the devil anytime it wants to come on it can be boastful and proud and all these things that we made mention godliness is a power that manifests Christ inside each and every one of us but just a form of godliness will deny that power to manifest Christ it'll talk talk talk but it won't manifest it second Peter chapter 1 verse 3 and 4 I want to read according as his divine power power the Holy Ghost have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious standing standing exceeding great and precious promises that by these precious promises we might be partakers of the divine nature if I could say it like this godliness look this is a mystery but you take the word of God and you believe it if God said you can live holy that that God can contain your mouth and you believe it you stand on that promise if God says you're healed I don't care what your body says stand there whatever the word says you stand on the promise the very fact that you're willing to believe against your feelings against your emotions against time that's time lapse that there's been since you started believing the fact that you're still believing to me is evidence it's evidence because real Faith don't stop it keeps believing it keeps believing the mystery of God's divine nature manifested inside of you if we were just if we honestly just I know that a lot of us we go through a lot of Trials and tests and we we just feel like we're always behind always behind and I don't mean it wrong but I believe Paul faced the same thing the Apostle Paul he knew he was behind in the aspect of where he needed to be he said I press towards the mark so I understand what it means to feel like you're not on Victory Lane I understand that but we need to have a confession a confession I I am not going to listen to the devil I am not going to entertain things that are outside of this word I am going to be faithful to the slightest little thing this word says every day I will make all my wrongs right amen this is the power of the Holy Ghost if you make that choice the mystery of godliness before you know God will become manifest in your flesh but you've got to take a stand get desperate desperate all right brother bam said the message is the absolute without controversy he said 'great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh seen of angels received up in glory he was God he come to take Sinners place yes sir and when God raised him up on the third day it was for our justification therefore exalted at the right hand of the Majesty on high he is in he is an intercessor to make intercessions for our weakness yes now notice this this is the same sentence to make intercession for our weaknesses which we all got these right here's how we deal with them as we confess it to him and die out to ourself placing his word back inside of us he said the promise and our faith makes the word live yes I I I know it's simple but this is this is the mystery of God becoming manifested in their lives that's right amen and our faith makes the word live because Christ is in us the quickener to the word I can't Quicken the word he quickens the word he quickens us he makes it live inside of US 1 Timothy chap 6:3 If any man Teach otherwise if any man Teach otherwise and consent not to Wholesome words even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to Godliness he is proud knowing nothing but dotting about questions and Stripes of words whereof cometh Envy Strife railings evil surmisings perverse disputings of men of corrupt Minds destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness but such withdraw thyself from such turn away but godliness with contentment is a great gain where should we be putting our emphasis how can I how can I please him a little B more am be content with that I'll tell you that'll bring his promises that'll make you that'll Supply every need you put God first he said he would Supply every need amen now God can take a human being in any state any condition any evil situation if he turn turns his free moral agency towards God towards obeying the word of God no matter how wrong he's done God will take that person and mysteriously will begin to manifest himself in that person all because he's turning towards God that's all God wants there's nothing you can do to make up for the evil you've done nothing nothing just turn turn turn a little closer get get a little closer to God say God I yearn for more of your word look we're living in an age where the devil is throwing every desire he can towards you so you just don't have time for God all right are you with me all right Colossians 1:24 I know this is a lot but I hope down the road when you get time and think about this it'll be a blessing to you first or Colossians 1:24 who now rejoice in my sufferings of course we all have to be all of us are going to suffer when we turn towards the Lord because we got to give up the flesh right so now rejoice in my sufferings for you fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for the body's sake which is the church wherefore I made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you it's the hope of glory we're not there yet Saints today is the day of salvation I mean if God would take us today we can say we're ready we feel we're ready to go but look it don't matter what I've done in the past it don't put me there it's where I'm standing today it's where my heart is at today I've got to make sure I have not conceived iniquity that it's important to me to do the will of God in my life all right verse 28 whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom for what purpose that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus wherein to I also labor striving according to his working which worketh mightily in me oh if we had time to get into Ephesians chapter 5 if you want to read that sometime it's talking about it's starts out where wives should be subject to their husbands and and that the husband is the head of the wife showing a position in a place but yet they're one they're one Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone and then he talks about the church the church is subject to God subject to the Holy Ghost they get the the their leadership from the Holy Ghost but the real mystery is that that Christ and the church are one the mystery of godliness the mystery of godliness unfolds as each Christian lets God have more of the preeminence in their life and I just want to read this verses in Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn of the Dead that in all things he might have the preeminence God wants the preeminence remember at one time when God created Lucifer God had preeminence in his life and when God first saved us we surrendered our life we repented we gave him preeminence things begin to change I got rid of my my my cigarettes I got rid of my my drugs I got rid of my uh Records I got rid of my long hair I got rid of my girly clothes things begin to happen but you know what the mystery of iniquity it still works things can creep in any time anytime but God is here to let us know there's a mystery of godliness if we just let God have preeminence in our life starting right now forget the past right now give God preeminence and you'll see before you know it you'll have the joy of the Lord you'll have peace you'll be able to love everybody no matter if they slap you across the face it's a truth everybody could be against you but God is right there for you amen all right see time you know I just want you to understand brother Mark he stopped 15 minutes early and I know he'd gladly give me that 15 minutes in the message the leoan church age brother Ram says now I said a moment ago that the false Vine came into full Fu in this age her fruit would mature and ripen that is correct this evil spirited Church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree that lodged the fowls of the air at her head will be the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity all this is true and if this is true then it must also be true that the bride uh the bride church WIll mature and her rightness will be the identification with her Lord by the means of the word and her head who will come into her is the mystery of godliness now you want to know what's special about this quote my message was already done when I found this quote I just love that brother Marty which indeed is Christ and as the false church with all cunning and diabolical power made up of political force physical Force Demons of Darkness come against the True Vine the True Vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the acts and the power that Jesus did then is she near as The Headstone becoming like him through the word Jesus will come that bride and groom will be forever United as one isn't that beautiful you write it down 1 John 3: 1 through3 it does not yet appear but we know when he shall appear we shall be like him it's going to happen in the message Shalom and I'm I'm closing I'm in the midst of closing I don't want to interrupt that with saying I've closed brother Brenham said in the message Shalom without controversy that's argument great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested or made known in the flesh isn't that wonderful God now God is a man and he's identified himself today in the church in the born again Christian God identifies himself that he remains God and the outside world will only know God as they see God in you and I and how many times have you said that in the men's meeting that's the only way that they'll know God is when we are written Epistles Epistles of the scripture we are R of all men and the life that we live reflects the life that's inside of us a man is identified by The Works that he does so our works should be good see always good because we are representing our Lord Jesus Christ the only way that we can eradicate iniquity from our lives is to let Christ come inside of us in a great greater measure now the thing is if I just start I a't done it yet outwardly but I just conceive it inside of my heart already I have put up a barrier between me and God and God will not hear my prayer now that's just what the scripture says says I believe if we repent of the thing that he's speaking to us hey you should you really do need to pray you really do need to read you really do need to listen to tapes you really do need to make things right if we listen to that we repent we listen to that that means God will hear our prayer am that's how we can become more like Christ last quote from the Samaran Church age he said if you are a Christian you will get back to what the spirit is teaching he said that's it the word of this age every Messenger to every age will preach the word every fresh and true Revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age The Cry of every age is to rebuke you have left the word of God repent and come back to the word from the first book in the Bible to the last book in Revelations there is only one reason for God's displeasure leaving the word and there's only one remedy to regain God's favor and that's come back to the word let's stand together two great Mysteries iniquity and godliness as Lucifer perverted a third of the angels from godliness to iniquity Christ is going to restore his seed from iniquity to Godliness through the power of the holy spirit amen I believe that with all my heart amen let's sing that I'm going to live the way he wants me to live just let's make that commitment in our heart I'm going to live the way he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's just no more to give I'm going to love love to there's just no more love I could never ever out love the Lord that sounds beautiful sing it to him I'm going to live the way he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's just no more to give I'm I'm going to love love till there's just no more love I could never ever out love the Lord isn't that beautiful one more time I'm going to live the way he wants me to live I'm going to give until there there's just no more to give I'm going to love love till there's just no more love I could never ever I love the Lord amen What a fine commitment What a fine commitment I'm going to live amen I believe every day know brother brenon often rededicated himself to the Lord wanted to make sure there was nothing there job look all the time that he spent even praying for his children for their sins I believe in this area that whatever time that we have to steal away to spend time calling on God God is there anything inside of me that you want me to take care of I believe that time that you spend doing that is your it's the weight in in in gold as as they say it would be worth anything that you else can do with that time we need our hearts are deceptive no man can know our heart we it needs it takes the word of God to to to uh discern our heart and and to let us know what what crept in unawares Amen in the of jeh God Almighty of peace [Music] Tres B heart [Music] ofed in the presence [Music]
