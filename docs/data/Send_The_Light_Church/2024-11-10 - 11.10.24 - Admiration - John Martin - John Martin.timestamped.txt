[3:44] praise you for these things now in Jesus
[3:46] Christ's name
[3:48] amen and I had a chance to be in Sunday
[3:50] school just a little bit and I i' asked
[3:52] the the the young ones the young adults
[3:56] the young our young our young adults um
[3:58] what what is it that we're supposed to
[4:00] did you bring what you're supposed to
[4:01] bring to church today and I asked him
[4:03] and one said he said uh when I asked
[4:06] what should we bring today he said our
[4:08] ears ears to hear and I really
[4:11] appreciated that one amen second Timothy
[4:13] chapter 23 we're going to start with
[4:15] verse number
[4:16] eight these be the names of the Mighty
[4:20] Men whom David had the
[4:23] taconite that sat in the seat Chief
[4:27] among the captains the same was a Dino
[4:30] the
[4:31] eite he lift up the spear against
[4:36] 800 and he slew at one time whom he slew
[4:40] imagine that man sing here today slew
[4:44] 800 people we would look at him and say
[4:47] wow right so
[4:50] adoration all right and after that was
[4:54] elazar the son of Dodo the Haight one of
[5:00] the three mighty men with
[5:03] David when they defied the Philistines
[5:06] that were there gathered together to
[5:09] battle and the men of Israel gone away
[5:12] he arose and smot the Philistines until
[5:15] his hand was weary and his hand it caved
[5:21] onto the sword in other words he just
[5:23] couldn't open his fingers to get it
[5:27] off and the Lord wrought a great victory
[5:29] that day and the people returned after
[5:32] him only to
[5:33] spoil after him was
[5:37] shemma the son of age the harar right
[5:43] and the Philistines were gathered
[5:44] together into a troop where was a piece
[5:47] of ground full of lentils and the people
[5:49] fled from the Philistines and he stood
[5:51] in the midst of the ground and defended
[5:54] it and slew the Philistines and the Lord
[5:56] wrought a great Victory and three of the
[5:59] 30 Chief went down and came to David in
[6:03] Harvest Time in the in the Harvest Time
[6:05] onto the cave of
[6:08] adulam and the troop of the Philistines
[6:11] pitched in the valley of uh reim and
[6:16] David was then in a
[6:19] hold and the Garrison of the Philistines
[6:22] was then in Bethlehem and David longed
[6:25] and said oh that one would give me a
[6:28] drink of water The Well of Bethlehem
[6:31] which is by the
[6:33] gate and the three Mighty Men break
[6:36] through the host of the Philistines and
[6:38] Drew water out of the well of Bethlehem
[6:40] that was by the gate and took it and
[6:42] brought it to David nevertheless he
[6:45] would not drink thereof but poured it
[6:47] out unto the Lord and he said be it far
[6:51] from me oh Lord that I should do this is
[6:54] not this the blood of the men that went
[6:58] in Jeopardy of their lives
[7:00] therefore he would not drink it these
[7:03] things did these three Mighty Men amen
[7:07] God bless you you may be seated I'll say
[7:10] like this I want to be one of those
[7:12] Mighty Men I want to be just like them I
[7:16] want to be able to live to my potential
[7:20] I don't think there's anything sadder in
[7:21] life than God given a a a human being an
[7:25] opportunity to be what God had created
[7:28] him to be and that and he he does not
[7:30] believe to that potential and he lives
[7:33] below the standard that God has given
[7:36] him and allows the enemy to take over
[7:38] his life and to to bring it down to such
[7:40] a place that it's without the character
[7:45] of God Amen and I'll say it's like this
[7:48] we have to be willing to be Mighty Men
[7:51] and mighty women that are willing to
[7:54] tell the devil he has no place in our
[7:56] life not at all not in our mind our
[8:00] thoughts not in our goals because I have
[8:04] my focus is that I could come to the
[8:06] full potential that God had created me
[8:08] to be amen we've all planted bushes and
[8:12] trees and uh you know we've thrown grass
[8:15] seed down before we we wanted to see
[8:18] things grow there's nothing sadder when
[8:22] you put labor you buy things you plant
[8:24] things you fertilize you do all and it
[8:26] just it it it only grows a little bit
[8:29] and then stops it's a very disappointing
[8:31] thing amen I remember we I I bought this
[8:34] tree one time from um borines and it it
[8:37] was a like a um one of those yellow
[8:42] norways um that leaves are yellow all
[8:44] the time and I was putting it in a
[8:48] spot um and so I I took out you know
[8:50] some good ground or there was bad ground
[8:52] took out a good size of ground and I put
[8:55] top soil in there and I fertilized it I
[8:57] did all this work and I planted that
[8:58] tree and for about uh two years it
[9:02] blossomed it was like a a horse no I'm
[9:05] sorry this was it was two trees there uh
[9:07] and this one was a horse chestnut tree
[9:09] that I had planted there and I like the
[9:10] horse chestnut trees they were pink
[9:12] flowers and for two years it did it did
[9:15] well and I thought it was just going to
[9:17] be a beautiful tree on the hill there
[9:18] and then all of a sudden it just
[9:20] died and I thought it never really came
[9:23] to its a potential and it was so
[9:25] disappointing because God wanted that
[9:27] tree to bring him glory because he
[9:29] created that tree all the flowers the
[9:31] birds everything we see was created for
[9:33] him for his glory and I think when we
[9:35] don't come to our potential that we
[9:38] really are not bringing him the glory
[9:40] that he's really worthy of amen amen
[9:43] well here David's life was was it it
[9:46] felt to him like it was spiring downhill
[9:49] his life went from bad to worse King
[9:53] Saul Who David loved and David actually
[9:57] tried to heal his spirit and his soul
[10:00] with with playing music and just serving
[10:02] him he was nothing but good to King Saul
[10:05] yet King Saul wanted to kill him he just
[10:08] had had this jealousy about him and and
[10:11] and we understand that you know when you
[10:13] are truly truly walking with the Lord
[10:16] you have every gun out of hell pointed
[10:19] at
[10:20] you because the devil is trying to stop
[10:25] you and David had fled to this Cave of
[10:28] aulum
[10:30] to escape King Saul and his men and this
[10:33] cave became a refuge for David and the
[10:37] few men that stood with him this cave
[10:40] provided shelter and and protection from
[10:43] All the Troubles and the enemy that was
[10:46] uh coming at him have you ever been to a
[10:48] place that you just wanted to escape
[10:49] from your enemy you just wanted to go
[10:51] find a cave or just find a place that
[10:53] you just wanted to get away well I tell
[10:55] you David didn't have a full Army he
[10:59] didn't have the government at his hands
[11:01] that to protect him right so he just
[11:03] fled and he found this cave and this
[11:07] cave became a very special place and I'm
[11:11] G to tell you God met David in that cave
[11:16] God met David and the cave Psalms 275
[11:18] says for in the time of trouble he shall
[11:20] hide me in his pilion in the secret of
[11:22] his Tabernacle shall he hide me and he
[11:25] shall lift me upon a He Shall Set me
[11:28] upon a rock
[11:29] right Psalm 17 keep me as the apple of
[11:33] thy eye hide me under the shadow of thy
[11:35] Wings amen David said in Psalm 61 from
[11:39] the end of the Earth will I cry when my
[11:41] heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock
[11:44] that is higher than I and I believe when
[11:47] David went in there he was looking for
[11:49] Refuge he was looking to find God he was
[11:52] looking for help with his
[11:54] situation Exodus 331 time you know this
[11:57] and the Lord said beh behold there is a
[12:00] place by me that thou shalt stand upon a
[12:04] rock and it shall come to pass while my
[12:07] Glory passees by that I will put thee in
[12:10] the CFT of the Rock Amen and will cover
[12:14] thee with my hand while I pass by you
[12:17] talk about Refuge we're in the palm of
[12:20] the hands of Jesus Christ today and no
[12:23] man is able to pluck us out and we just
[12:26] got to have our confidence in God no
[12:28] matter what we're going
[12:30] through this cave became a great Clift
[12:33] in the rock for David and for his men
[12:36] David abandoned himself to do the will
[12:39] of God there I'll tell you when you're
[12:40] facing you ain't got nowhere to go
[12:42] you're willing to just give up things
[12:44] for God and this is where a place where
[12:46] David was God had put him in such a
[12:49] situation not just like Jesus Christ we
[12:51] know that he became squeezed right at
[12:54] Calvary but nothing but the the the
[12:56] Beauty and the the perfume of God came
[12:58] out I think what David when he he went
[13:01] through so many things so many more
[13:03] things than what we go through we think
[13:04] we got it bad we think we got it hard we
[13:06] think you know things are unfair you
[13:08] don't even realize what others have gone
[13:10] through I say that it's the truth and
[13:13] I'll tell you but I believe that God was
[13:15] bringing out the very best out of David
[13:18] amen
[13:19] am he turned loose of all his o his own
[13:23] ideas he let go of his strength he let
[13:25] go of his reasoning and he began to put
[13:28] more of his Trust into God and he found
[13:31] refuge and security and and and actually
[13:34] Deliverance in this place I believe he
[13:36] found the mercy of God in this place in
[13:38] this cave David wrote some of his most
[13:40] famous Psalms while he was hiding in
[13:43] this cave this was a place where God met
[13:46] him and in Psalms this was one of the
[13:49] Psalms I just want to read it it's in
[13:51] Psalms 142 if you want to write that
[13:53] down he says I will look on my right
[13:55] hand and behold but there was no man
[13:58] that was would know me Refuge failed me
[14:02] no man cared for my
[14:04] soul what a state to be in when nobody
[14:09] cares for your soul he says I Cried unto
[14:12] thee oh Lord I said Thou Art my refuge
[14:15] and my portion in the land of the living
[14:17] he found God there Psalms 52 or 57 he
[14:21] says I will cry unto God the most high
[14:24] unto God that
[14:27] performthe he was in the midst of
[14:30] nobody's with him everybody turns
[14:32] against him he still believed that God
[14:34] was going to take care of him be thou
[14:37] exalted oh God above the heavens let the
[14:39] glory be above let thy glory be above
[14:42] all the Earth my heart is fixed oh God
[14:46] my heart is fixed I will sing and give
[14:49] praise I will praise thee Oh Lord among
[14:51] the people I will sing unto the uh among
[14:55] I will sing unto thee among the
[14:57] Nations you know he just would would not
[14:59] allow the terrible things that had
[15:02] happened him I mean think about think
[15:04] about this if you knew there were people
[15:06] that were out to shoot you and kill
[15:09] you or you'd be thinking about the
[15:12] police right you'd be thinking about
[15:15] getting help some
[15:17] protection but I tell
[15:19] you David didn't have anywhere else to
[15:21] go to but the
[15:25] Lord and God sometimes puts us in
[15:27] positions like that to get our
[15:29] attention we got to rely on God for our
[15:32] lives amen he said for thy mercy is
[15:35] great unto the heaven and thy truth unto
[15:37] the clouds be thou exalted above oh God
[15:41] above the heavens and let thy glory be
[15:45] above all the earth I want I just want
[15:46] to ask you a question today when was the
[15:49] last time you were just down in the
[15:50] dumps but you looked to God and you
[15:52] started praising him like
[15:54] David I'll tell you there's something
[15:56] inside of the believer he cannot let go
[15:58] of God he knows where his salvation
[16:01] comes from he knows where his strength
[16:03] comes from he is not hanging on to the
[16:05] things of this
[16:06] world
[16:08] Hallelujah David had the ability to take
[16:12] a mess and straighten it
[16:15] out he had faith and he had confidence
[16:18] he was a born leader as you know true
[16:20] leaders are born
[16:22] leaders he he actually had to get his
[16:25] house out of order what do I mean by
[16:28] that he took about 400 men who were in
[16:31] debt who were distressed who were
[16:34] disoriented and he made them elite
[16:37] soldiers he got his house in
[16:41] order and David taught these men we know
[16:45] this that David taught these men the
[16:47] ways of the Lord and I'll just say it
[16:50] like this to the parents we need to get
[16:53] serious more serious the hour is late
[16:56] and I'm so thankful for the freedom that
[16:59] we have in our country
[17:00] today what a what a load's been lifted
[17:03] off of
[17:04] America but I'll say it like this we're
[17:07] in an
[17:08] hour Jesus is coming soon our kids need
[17:11] the Lord and we need to start teaching
[17:14] them we need to start bringing them up
[17:16] in the in more than ever the admonition
[17:18] of the Lord you can't give you can't
[17:21] give your children too much
[17:23] Christ and there were three of these
[17:25] elite soldiers that heard that David had
[17:28] a
[17:29] desire in the midst of this
[17:33] battle all that one would give me a
[17:36] drink of the water of The Well of
[17:39] Bethlehem which is by the gate that's
[17:42] all he did was
[17:44] Express a
[17:45] yearning for the well water amen I me I
[17:49] say today God sees your heart if you're
[17:51] hungering and thirsting for him he sees
[17:54] your
[17:56] desire these men had so much add
[17:58] admiration for David that they put their
[18:01] own lives into
[18:03] Jeopardy David didn't ask them to
[18:06] go David didn't say well you know you
[18:09] should be doing this I'm your
[18:15] king
[18:17] no there was respect amongst these mix
[18:22] fits indebted didn't know have anything
[18:26] they left King Saul
[18:29] but David taught them how to
[18:31] respect David taught them how to be
[18:35] respectful to one another to the place
[18:38] that just the knowing the very desire of
[18:41] those around you he they wanted to
[18:44] please sometimes we have to just shove
[18:46] something down their throat force it we
[18:49] have to bring fear upon a person just to
[18:52] get something we want and I'm telling
[18:54] you this is not the way of God
[19:00] they had so much respect for David that
[19:03] they put their lives in danger they
[19:05] fought through a Garrison
[19:09] Army and went 13 to 15 miles to get
[19:15] David a cup of cold
[19:18] water now if I said to you would you
[19:21] drive down you know to Grand Blank or
[19:24] flint and grab me
[19:27] something get me a couple W
[19:30] what they didn't have a car they didn't
[19:33] take a chariot they didn't have a the
[19:37] the the the train or the subway what
[19:40] they had was an enemy they had a fight
[19:43] through they had they had to Be watchful
[19:45] they had to be careful they had to be
[19:48] looking and it it takes about 3 to four
[19:51] hours to walk you know that many
[19:54] miles but imagine now you you just can't
[19:57] just walk
[19:59] but you had an enemy that wanted to kill
[20:02] you I don't know how long it took to get
[20:06] this but just walking there and back
[20:08] could have been an easy seven eight
[20:09] hours but to go ahead and have fights
[20:12] along the way to be watching that
[20:14] nobody's going to get you because you're
[20:17] the enemy and the enem is out
[20:22] there this was no TV show brother Dennis
[20:26] this was a real situation
[20:30] David said these men put their own lives
[20:33] into
[20:37] Jeopardy for if I could say it like this
[20:41] for a lousy cup of
[20:44] water can you imagine brother Marty
[20:47] somebody asking you can you get me a cup
[20:51] of
[20:55] water just helping somebody with a
[20:58] couple water I mean like what's the big
[21:00] deal just go to the drinking
[21:02] fountain you know where the water's at
[21:04] pour it out of the
[21:07] faucet to go ahead and sacrifice eight
[21:10] hours for somebody to give somebody a
[21:11] cup of water what is that telling
[21:14] you there was so much admiration and so
[21:17] much
[21:19] respect I know what I would have been
[21:24] saying I'm not going to go eight hours
[21:26] to help my kids get him a glass of
[21:38] water I believe we're living in an hour
[21:41] where respect is going down the
[21:44] tubes people are finding a reason not to
[21:47] be not to bring admiration to somebody
[21:51] this scripture of esteeming others
[21:52] better than themselves is something of
[21:57] old our if you you know we're all
[22:00] disgusted with this world are we not all
[22:02] disgusted about the things that are
[22:04] happening in this world but what is
[22:05] brought about this this Dre Queen this
[22:08] gay this this black only black lives
[22:11] matter and nothing else matters in the
[22:13] world and I'm not going to give any
[22:14] allegiance to this flag or anything
[22:16] about what is all that all that is is a
[22:19] disrespect it's a spirit of
[22:22] disrespect and it creeps into our
[22:24] churches it well creeps first into our
[22:27] home and then it creeps into the
[22:30] church because you're not taught here to
[22:33] disrespect you're taught to fight that
[22:36] Spirit but see this Spirit gets on
[22:40] us and then we forget to honor one
[22:45] another and these men
[22:48] literally it wasn't just taking you know
[22:50] 30 seconds out to say brother Ron I
[22:53] really appreciate
[22:55] you they took eight hours and
[22:58] jeopardized their
[23:00] life that's a very high degree of
[23:04] admiration don't you
[23:06] think a very high degree it wasn't it
[23:09] wasn't even be asked you know Jesus said
[23:11] if they asked you to go M go to
[23:14] right but it wasn't even
[23:23] asked h
[23:31] I can't imagine just having to fight
[23:33] through a battle there and
[23:37] back and make sure the water's kept
[23:42] safe it they didn't have plastic
[23:48] bottles I'm just I'm at
[23:51] all at these men I'm going to meet them
[23:54] one day we're going to meet them one day
[23:55] am we're going to meet them one day
[23:57] we're going to shake their
[24:00] hand and say I look up to
[24:03] you because you are a person that had
[24:13] respect sometimes we fight through 13
[24:16] miles of devils just to get to The Well
[24:20] of
[24:21] God sometimes we got to pray we got to
[24:24] wait on the Lord we got to fight through
[24:26] demons but I'll tell you you just stay
[24:29] there and you wait God will come he will
[24:32] meet you it's his promise he that is a
[24:34] thirst I will give him of the wells of
[24:37] life right we got to remember there is a
[24:41] well for us that we can drink of and
[24:43] have the refreshing the strength the
[24:46] peace the power that God has for his
[24:48] children amen sometimes we let too many
[24:51] too many Devils come
[24:55] in we got to stay focused
[25:00] stay in prayer that's where we fight
[25:02] that's where we show God our respect
[25:05] come on now that's where you show God
[25:07] your respect is when you get on your
[25:11] knees fight the good fight of Faith lay
[25:15] hold of eternal life amen they that wait
[25:18] upon the Lord what do they get renewed
[25:22] strength well I'm going to try to get it
[25:24] some other
[25:26] way the devil has got a a lot of lures
[25:29] out
[25:31] there the only thing that's going to
[25:33] give us strength is
[25:37] Christ and I mean I appreciate
[25:41] fellowship and it's
[25:43] encouraging it is renewing but you know
[25:47] it don't last too much more than the
[25:50] time of
[25:52] Fellowship but when you have something
[25:54] that you can take with you when the
[25:56] fellowship is done and the trial start
[25:59] and there's still something inside of
[26:01] you that loves God that you just want to
[26:04] worship and praise him and respect him
[26:07] at all times now you got something that
[26:10] God has and that's
[26:13] God Jesus or speaking here Luke 18 Jesus
[26:17] spoke a parable unto this and that men
[26:19] ought to always pray and not to faint
[26:22] David spent a lot of time praying in
[26:25] that cave he said in Psalms 27 I
[26:28] had fainted unless I believed to see the
[26:31] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[26:32] living wait on the Lord be of good
[26:34] courage and he shall strengthen thy
[26:36] heart wait I say on the
[26:39] Lord how many people just go home and do
[26:44] nothing just
[26:46] waiting for things to get
[26:48] better and things just don't get
[26:51] better because they're just
[26:54] waiting we need to wait on the Lord amen
[26:57] respect respect the Lord don't respect
[27:00] the
[27:01] couch The Lazy
[27:03] Boy respect the Lord wait on
[27:07] him John 737 in the last days that great
[27:11] day of the feast Jesus stood and cried
[27:13] If any man thirst let him come and drink
[27:14] and he that believeth on me as the
[27:16] scripture said out of his belly shall
[27:18] flow rivers of Living Water that's a
[27:22] promise this spake he of the
[27:26] spirit which they that believe in him
[27:28] should receive for the Holy Ghost was
[27:30] not yet given because that Jesus was not
[27:32] yet glorified I'll just say it like this
[27:34] if you are missing the joy of the Lord
[27:37] today just get a
[27:40] drink say God fill me just touch me
[27:43] inside because Joy don't come from the
[27:46] outside that's
[27:49] happiness real Joy comes from the inside
[27:52] and it only comes from God it is a it is
[27:55] a fruit of the Holy Spirit love joy
[27:58] peace it's a fruit of
[28:00] God and look the Holy Ghost was given
[28:02] out on the day of Pentecost and it's
[28:04] here today it is free for anyone who
[28:07] says God I'm thirsty today I want more
[28:10] of you today because that's what it
[28:12] takes blessed is he that hungers and
[28:14] thirsts after righteousness he shall be
[28:18] filled there is a great Garrison in this
[28:22] age I'll say it is the spirit of
[28:25] leoda it's a Garrison
[28:28] it's an attitude of needing
[28:30] nothing you're lucky if you get this out
[28:33] of
[28:39] me it's Garrison Spirit of
[28:43] lukewarmness we have to fight through
[28:46] the enemy to get a cup of just fresh
[28:52] water from the spiritual well of
[28:55] Bethlehem amen Jesus said the Kingdom of
[28:59] Heaven suffereth
[29:00] violent and the violent taketh it by
[29:04] force I'm just gonna me and God that's
[29:08] all I need he's he's all I need Amen
[29:11] Brother Bruce said he's the friend that
[29:12] sticketh closer than a brother amen you
[29:15] don't want to know because God said I'll
[29:17] never leave you and I'll never forsake
[29:19] you
[29:20] amen how many times have somebody said
[29:22] I'm going to be there for you and when
[29:24] you needed them they weren't there right
[29:28] right we can't depend on one
[29:30] another but you know we can
[29:33] respect we can respect you want to know
[29:36] what real respect is real respect is
[29:39] respecting a person that is not
[29:43] respecting
[29:45] you when you respect someone because
[29:48] they respect you that is not
[29:51] respect that's the same thing the
[29:53] publicans and the Pharisees do but when
[29:56] you respect somebody that is not
[29:58] respecting you that's called respect
[30:02] that's real admiration and that's where
[30:05] Christ is pointing us to that type of
[30:09] admiration one for another respect for
[30:12] one another you can't have too much but
[30:15] you can always and most certainly often
[30:19] have not
[30:22] enough I think we ought be jumping up
[30:24] and down saying not that I like it but
[30:26] that's the truth
[30:29] it's the truth that sets us free and we
[30:32] need the truth we need to have this God
[30:34] I want to be like you I I just want to
[30:37] be like you Lord I want to have this
[30:39] this respect that you have I think about
[30:41] this God condescended to Men of low
[30:44] state to this I am in debt to Jesus
[30:47] Christ today that I understand He Paid a
[30:50] Debt I couldn't pay but I am still in
[30:52] debt to
[30:54] him and that brings an a respect to God
[30:58] to God's house and and and my attitude
[31:01] towards his word and and the word that
[31:04] he brings to
[31:08] us and after this great sacrifice that
[31:11] the men of David did for
[31:14] David it looked like he was just being
[31:20] disrespectful to them because he took
[31:23] the cup and he poured it up
[31:28] you made me go eight hours 10 hours I
[31:32] don't know flight through I give up
[31:35] my I I could not even come back alive my
[31:38] life was in Jeopardy and you're taking
[31:40] this water and you're dumping
[31:43] it they didn't have that
[31:46] attitude no they
[31:51] didn't David did not feel
[31:54] worthy that
[31:56] someone would have so
[32:00] much respect and admiration for him that
[32:05] they would do this great
[32:07] sacrifice put their life in danger he
[32:10] says he uses these words that it was
[32:13] literally the the their own blood the
[32:16] sacrifice their own
[32:19] blood he says I'm not worthy of that and
[32:22] he took that water and he just dumped it
[32:25] out to the Lord amen
[32:31] this to me is such a remarkable story
[32:34] because did David ever get his
[32:37] water did the men ever fulfill what
[32:39] their desire was was to to just honor
[32:43] David respect him and and and give him
[32:45] this water but you know who got the
[32:47] glory out of both parties respecting it
[32:50] was God it was
[32:53] God he's the one that deserves us to
[32:57] respect one another to admire one
[33:00] another to esteem one another is for him
[33:04] we sit here as little Min judges
[33:05] thinking this person don't deserve to be
[33:07] respected it is not for you to decide
[33:10] who deserves to be respected or not it's
[33:13] up to you just to honor every human
[33:19] being sometimes we can't even find
[33:22] enough gumption I'll say it like this we
[33:24] don't have enough Gods sometimes to even
[33:26] respect one another
[33:29] another well you don't know what they
[33:32] did to
[33:33] me well I'll tell you if you spend a
[33:35] bunch of time brother Mike where's he at
[33:38] or some of you workers here you spent a
[33:40] lot of time make something for me and I
[33:42] just you know go bury
[33:45] it I I know what you're going to
[33:47] think you sisters you make me a good
[33:51] meal make sure it's a good
[33:55] one I mean you spend all this time
[33:59] I just take that meal and I just dump
[34:01] dump it
[34:03] outside I know what you're
[34:06] thinking never gonna do that for him
[34:10] again I can't believe how he treated me
[34:14] but if I did it because I wasn't worthy
[34:16] of
[34:19] it then you could understand he's
[34:23] respecting and honoring me
[34:28] I tell you I just say it like this
[34:29] Saints there's some growing up I think
[34:32] we could do I think there's some growing
[34:34] up we have to
[34:39] do David had much admiration for his men
[34:45] that he didn't feel worthy of their
[34:46] sacrifice and David's men had so much
[34:51] admiration uh for I'm sorry let me just
[34:54] say this again David's men has so much
[34:56] admiration for him that he they were
[34:58] willing to sacrifice their lives and
[35:01] when they David received that sacrifice
[35:03] he felt So Unworthy of their sacrifice
[35:06] that he says Lord I'm just giving it to
[35:09] you it wasn't
[35:13] wasted in other words I believe there's
[35:15] a great reward
[35:17] coming for David for doing that and I do
[35:20] believe this and when we get on the
[35:21] other side there's a great reward coming
[35:22] for those
[35:23] men you know that Jesus said not a cup
[35:26] of cold water given in his name would
[35:29] lose its
[35:33] reward I just say it like this we're
[35:36] missing out when God is not the center
[35:38] of the reason we respect one another
[35:40] we're missing out we're sitting here in
[35:42] this big this I call it little
[35:45] Earth sheeto thinking we got it all
[35:48] figured out and we're going to give
[35:50] respect to who we want to and when we
[35:51] want and and why we want and I'm the
[35:54] king I'm the queen I'm whatever
[35:59] we're without Christ that is not not the
[36:02] not Christ that is not the spirit of
[36:03] Christ that's the anointing of
[36:06] Christ we're reading what the spirit of
[36:09] God would
[36:10] do and God is calling all of us to be
[36:14] like
[36:16] him so it doesn't matter if you're a
[36:19] king or if you're a
[36:21] servant all of us should be having
[36:24] admiration and respect one for another
[36:27] does doesn't matter if for the head of
[36:28] the home or for the
[36:31] Caboose admiration one for another amen
[36:34] respect for one
[36:38] another God is no respector persons why
[36:42] should we be are we greater than
[36:46] God God became man to serve amen why
[36:51] shouldn't we serve man are we greater
[36:54] than
[36:55] God God washed the feet of his own
[36:58] disciples shouldn't we be washing the
[36:59] feet of those that are what we think are
[37:01] less than
[37:02] us amen are we greater than God see
[37:06] these things we see what God is but what
[37:10] are
[37:11] we come on I think there should be
[37:14] somebody that loves this word this
[37:16] morning Romans 15
[37:19] verse1 we then that are strong how many
[37:23] you strong today let me see your
[37:25] hands keep them up there keep them up
[37:28] there I love it those of you that don't
[37:31] got your hand all right you are you put
[37:33] down your hands now I'm going to talk
[37:35] I'm going to talk talk let me those of
[37:37] you that are weak let me see your
[37:39] hands one
[37:43] two okay
[37:45] three all right so I'll say it like this
[37:50] you that raised your hands you that are
[37:52] not participating I'll see you in the
[37:55] office after the service
[37:58] so those of you that raised your hand
[38:00] first you have to you got a job to do
[38:03] we're going to read about it right is
[38:04] right here Romans 151 we then that are
[38:06] strong ought to Bear the
[38:09] infirmities of the weak and not to
[38:13] please
[38:15] ourselves have you ever just done
[38:17] something for somebody and after you did
[38:19] it they were they were like felt real
[38:22] good about what you
[38:23] did they didn't do nothing for you but
[38:26] you just felt so much
[38:28] better to me you can't outgive God
[38:32] because when you do it for somebody God
[38:35] just comes in and fills you with such
[38:37] strength so the one one way to really
[38:40] become strong is start esteeming others
[38:42] better than
[38:44] yourself take time to look at somebody
[38:47] and find something good to say remember
[38:50] that that old will woman uh that that
[38:52] she always always said something good
[38:55] never had anything negative to saying
[38:57] about anybody and some one of these boys
[38:59] were trying to uh trick her came to her
[39:02] and says well what do you think about
[39:03] the
[39:05] devil and she said I think he's a good
[39:08] adversary
[39:10] amen and I think that's the kind of the
[39:12] way we need to be we need to be such a
[39:14] positive mindset that we just don't have
[39:17] anything negative to think
[39:19] about why are we why we've lost respect
[39:22] why have we lost admiration why is it
[39:25] left us our homes our families why
[39:29] why because our minds became
[39:35] negative and that's the reason we ought
[39:38] to be meditating day and night in the
[39:41] word of God Amen reading listening
[39:45] getting in prayer and saying God I need
[39:47] to hear from you what this is really
[39:48] saying get serious with God just a lot
[39:51] of there's so many so-called Christians
[39:53] out in the world they don't even know
[39:55] God that's they know the Bible they can
[39:59] quote it they can go to church but they
[40:01] do not have a
[40:03] relationship come on we all we ought to
[40:06] be the most thankful people on the
[40:08] planet that God has come down and
[40:10] revealed to us what it really means to
[40:11] be a
[40:12] Christian it's something that happens in
[40:14] the inside of your heart your mind
[40:17] everything is
[40:19] God it's not a put on it's not some
[40:22] peacock feathers not just some sh at
[40:26] times
[40:29] the Bible says let every one of us
[40:32] please his neighbor for his good to
[40:36] edification for every for even Christ
[40:39] pleased not
[40:42] himself but as it is written the
[40:44] reproaches of them that reproach thee
[40:46] fell on me I'll say it like this if
[40:48] you're around somebody that all they do
[40:50] is they think about you that's toxic for
[40:53] your
[40:54] life come on
[40:57] you're around somebody that's doing
[40:59] nothing but serving you I am telling you
[41:01] that helps your
[41:03] life it's awful quiet I don't I I
[41:06] shouldn't be quiet I'm just speaking the
[41:09] truth God has not talk called us to be
[41:15] toxins we need to get our Waters
[41:18] purified am our thinking
[41:21] purified we ought to humble oursel and
[41:23] say this human being that God has
[41:26] created is much more worthy of respect
[41:29] that I want to
[41:33] give pride is nothing
[41:36] more than
[41:40] selfishness living for one own self
[41:44] that's the spirit of
[41:46] Pride not necessarily somebody say oh
[41:48] yeah I'm the greatest
[41:50] thing that's what most people think
[41:53] pride is but Pride could be somebody
[41:55] that doesn't hardly say a thing but is
[41:57] so
[42:00] selfish it's all about their will that's
[42:03] what pride is and you know the Bible
[42:05] says that God resists
[42:07] that and he gives grace to the
[42:10] humble humility is simply living
[42:15] selflessly humility is simply living
[42:23] selflessly we heard it's living for
[42:25] others that's the spirit of
[42:30] God Isaiah 57 for thus saith the high
[42:33] and lofty one that inhab eternity whose
[42:35] name is Holy I dwell in the high and
[42:36] holy place and I should say with him
[42:39] also that is of a contrite and humble
[42:44] spirit so he dwells with the humble
[42:46] notice there's nothing in there about
[42:47] Pride but to revive the spirit of the
[42:50] humble and to revive the heart of the
[42:52] contrite ones let me just say it like
[42:54] this if we're not going to be humble why
[42:56] don't we just lift our hand say I'm on
[42:57] the other
[43:00] side I live on the other side oh some of
[43:03] us live on the Hallelujah side the glory
[43:07] landway but if we're going to walk with
[43:09] pride God's not really walking with us
[43:11] well brother John God said he'll never
[43:12] leave me there you know that's the truth
[43:14] he never will but the Bible never says
[43:16] you won't leave
[43:19] him in fact Jesus said you got to abide
[43:22] in the vine got to stay connected right
[43:25] got to Die daily crucify the flesh you
[43:28] know you got too many people out here
[43:30] with this idea about I'm saved once
[43:33] saved always saved nobody can taught me
[43:34] out of it no matter what I'm GNA do I'm
[43:36] saved it doesn't
[43:37] matter it's like can you give me just
[43:39] one scripture for that just
[43:42] one but you see that's the doctrine of
[43:44] the
[43:46] devil and when we're not in church you
[43:48] know what the devil does preaches to
[43:51] us every chance he can he's
[43:56] preaching you may not look be looking at
[43:58] a Bolton board or the TV or your phone
[44:01] but you know
[44:04] what you ever have driving down the road
[44:06] everything's fine all of a sudden
[44:07] there's this fly in your car the windows
[44:08] are up you can't get them out just bugs
[44:11] the tower out of
[44:13] you sometimes the devil just comes
[44:17] buzzing you just you want to roll down
[44:19] the window and get the get them
[44:25] out eternal life is not doing things for
[44:30] others I I wish I had about a thousand
[44:33] amens on that one eternal life is living
[44:37] your life for others big difference big
[44:41] it's your whole life your whole life is
[44:43] about
[44:44] others Jesus left his glory for you amen
[44:49] and in fact he's preparing a mansion for
[44:51] you today he's still living for you
[44:53] today he is still a friend that Stith
[44:55] closer than a brother he is still here
[44:57] to give us water when we want
[45:02] it if we can just have a love for him
[45:05] that desires him as much as he desires
[45:07] us we heard this that God wants to give
[45:09] us the Holy Ghost more than we can
[45:14] imagine sometimes we could just take it
[45:16] or leave
[45:17] it we've lost respect for
[45:23] God do you know when you come into
[45:24] church and you worship and you hunger
[45:26] for him you know what you're saying I
[45:28] wor I respect you
[45:32] God it it isn't just sitting quietly in
[45:35] the sanctuary that that is a respect it
[45:37] really is and I I I I say I tip my hat
[45:41] off to those that stay in the sanctuary
[45:44] through the service I I I respect that I
[45:49] respect you for
[45:51] that and may it just continue to
[45:54] grow because I believe God
[45:57] is calling us higher amen God is calling
[46:00] us Mark chapter 10 we need to we need to
[46:02] hurry because you know there's a song I
[46:05] used to listen to when I was in the
[46:06] world it says we've only just
[46:12] begun Mark chap 10:42 but Jesus called
[46:16] them called them to him and saith unto
[46:18] him you know that they which are
[46:22] accounted to rule over the Gentiles
[46:25] exercise lordship over for them and
[46:28] their great ones exercise Authority upon
[46:30] them
[46:32] so I'm I'm just going to be honest with
[46:35] you has I'm going to talk to the men
[46:36] here the fathers for a second have you
[46:38] ever in your home you know pushed your
[46:43] Authority on your
[46:46] family thank you I we got one honest
[46:49] person two
[46:58] that
[47:00] is in the wrong spirit and we're going
[47:03] to find out what the right Spirit and
[47:05] the wrong Spirit here the wrong spirit
[47:06] is not you to remind your family who the
[47:08] boss
[47:10] is they don't need to be reminded they
[47:14] need to see it
[47:18] lived and we're going to find out how
[47:20] you live it right here Jesus teaching us
[47:23] but so shall it not be among you you're
[47:26] different
[47:27] but whosoever will be great among you
[47:30] shall be your
[47:32] minister you know and I I see when I see
[47:36] sisters and uh an and Cheryl and and
[47:40] just whever I see people bringing food
[47:43] to the table I think of them as a server
[47:45] right we go out to eat and waiters and
[47:47] waitresses come they they serve so when
[47:49] I I I think of somebody that's
[47:51] ministering is actually helping the
[47:53] other
[47:54] person so if you're going to be a
[47:56] minister it does doesn't mean you know
[47:57] you stand at home on your couch and you
[47:59] say I am the
[48:03] boss no you
[48:05] serve and you know what you know what
[48:07] the problem is Sister Jee with a lot of
[48:09] men nowadays they don't know how to
[48:12] serve they don't ought to
[48:16] serve it's like they need to get that
[48:19] serving for dummies book
[48:23] out because it's something that they
[48:25] don't feel is necessary
[48:28] only thing that only the Revelation that
[48:30] needs to be in the home is on the head
[48:31] and you
[48:32] listen and they've missed the very
[48:36] gospel that Jesus
[48:39] preached verse 44 and whosoever of you
[48:42] shall be the chiefest shall be the
[48:44] servant of all for even the son of man
[48:47] came not to be ministered unto but to
[48:49] minister and to give his life a ransom
[48:52] for many
[48:56] if the son of man came not to be
[48:59] ministered unto then what are we here
[49:02] for why do we expect everybody to do
[49:05] stuff for us I don't understand that
[49:09] Spirit are we greater than God like we
[49:13] deserve to be ministered on
[49:15] too aren't we called to minister to
[49:19] others all right say Amen so we can move
[49:22] on Amen I mean if you want to be here
[49:24] all day I'll just take my time
[49:28] Philippians chapter
[49:29] 2:7 Jesus said but made himself of no
[49:33] reputation took upon him the form of a
[49:35] servant and being found in fashion as a
[49:37] man he humbled himself and became
[49:39] obedient unto death even the death of
[49:42] the Cross so if Jesus had to do this are
[49:44] we greater than
[49:46] God no we're still called to serve one
[49:50] another amen everyone has a spirit
[49:53] inside of
[49:54] them we ought to have the spirit that
[49:57] wants to
[49:58] serve we ought to have the spirit that
[50:01] wants to respect and give admiration and
[50:03] to love one another that's the spirit
[50:05] that should be living in our
[50:08] Tabernacle can you imagine brother
[50:10] Dennis if I said well God lives in
[50:15] Me God lives in
[50:17] me but I'm gonna go ahead and and act
[50:20] like a
[50:21] devil now now what are you going to
[50:24] believe are you going to believe that
[50:26] I'm just quoting the Bible and God said
[50:28] he lives in
[50:29] me or are you going to believe the life
[50:32] that the spirit is manifesting am so I'm
[50:35] telling you Saints we need a spirit to
[50:39] serve to
[50:42] love I know I I'd like to put every one
[50:45] of us in a room and just you have a
[50:47] bunch of rooms and we go from room to
[50:48] room and we talk to one another and in
[50:50] that room you have to find five things
[50:53] that you admire about the person you're
[50:54] staring at
[50:57] you know it would be hard for some of us
[51:00] it really would it's like uh uh
[51:05] uh yeah I like the outfits you're
[51:08] wearing um I've never seen shoes like
[51:12] those we would struggle in finding
[51:15] something to say good about one another
[51:18] and you want to know why that is because
[51:21] we don't practice
[51:23] it we don't practice it we don't
[51:25] practice the serving
[51:27] it's like not necessary in our
[51:33] Christianity it's really Antichrist did
[51:36] you know that it's literally Antichrist
[51:38] to be all about
[51:41] you get off yourself we sing that song
[51:44] just forget about
[51:49] yourself esteem others better than
[51:53] yourself that's the spirit that should
[51:55] be living in US
[51:58] why is there fighting arguing
[52:01] debating we got to just ask the question
[52:03] where is the spirit of the Living God
[52:05] Among Us where's the god of Elijah
[52:08] where's the god that wants to be
[52:10] glorified in our homes and be glorified
[52:13] in how we talk to one another you know I
[52:15] cannot stop
[52:18] Bob from yelling at
[52:21] me I can't stop him from treating me
[52:25] like a piece of garbage
[52:27] but you know what I can treat him with
[52:29] utmost
[52:32] respect because his Spirit that's in him
[52:37] is not in me that's right but I know
[52:40] that devil that's in him wants to jump
[52:43] on
[52:45] me but greater is he that's in me amen
[52:49] than he that's in
[52:51] there just make a choice I'm not going
[52:54] to do that it's a choice
[52:57] when you feel you have to prove to Bob
[52:59] where he's
[53:03] wrong then the that's when that devil
[53:05] can reason you into that same spirit and
[53:09] then you'll just go back and forth right
[53:12] it's truth I mean hey look we've all
[53:14] experienced it I I'll just say like this
[53:16] I am speaking from
[53:22] experience we've all fallen into the
[53:24] Trap right but the thing is time to grow
[53:27] up we're not ignorant of the devil's
[53:29] devices it's time that we just look at
[53:31] Bob bow our head pray say something good
[53:33] try to break that Spirit you know you
[53:35] want to do something
[53:37] good soft answer gives turns away WRA
[53:40] that's right right amen you're trying to
[53:44] help a bad atmosphere in the home put
[53:45] the apron on go help go help your wife
[53:48] amen sisters bad situation going on with
[53:51] your husband go go ahead G up yourself
[53:54] get over down I'm here to help what do
[53:55] you want me to do
[53:58] maybe only thing you can't do is pray
[53:59] you go pray that time you pray with all
[54:00] your heart and you
[54:02] believe but I believe in changing our
[54:05] homes I believe it happens when we get
[54:07] serious about changing our spirit our
[54:10] attitudes our own lives you can't change
[54:12] a home without changing
[54:13] yourself you can sit there all day long
[54:16] and wish that everybody else was better
[54:18] and then when they get better then maybe
[54:19] you'll try but you know what you ain't
[54:20] fit for the kingdom of
[54:23] God it's when you humble yourself and
[54:25] you be you you begin to do what God
[54:27] wants you to do in the midst of your
[54:30] problems that you bring a respect to the
[54:33] home and that respect seems to just
[54:36] filter out to one another and before you
[54:38] know
[54:39] it the atmosphere just calms
[54:43] down you know they may not be jumping up
[54:45] and saying glory to God but I'll tell
[54:47] you what you'll just snap that
[54:49] devil because the devil can't do nothing
[54:51] unless he's got a vessel to work through
[54:53] he really can't
[54:57] Romans
[54:58] 12:10 we're going to have to skip a lot
[55:01] but you're going to get the message in
[55:02] your heart anyways right Romans 1210 be
[55:05] kindly affectionate one to
[55:08] another with a brotherly
[55:12] love in fact that Spirit has to be
[55:15] honoring in honor in honor prefer one
[55:19] another here we go now we got to put all
[55:22] this this hard work and when we're going
[55:24] to see somebody shake their hand talk
[55:26] talk to them I actually have
[55:28] to I have to honor I have to find
[55:31] something to
[55:33] honor you know the thing is it doesn't
[55:36] matter what evil you all would ever do
[55:39] to me not that you would hopefully that
[55:41] part is not being recorded but let me
[55:42] just say this you have done so much for
[55:46] me you have prayed so much for me you
[55:49] have loved me you have respected me so
[55:51] much if you never did another thing I
[55:54] would always honor you
[55:57] I would always prefer
[56:04] you it shouldn't be hard to be kindly
[56:07] affectionate one towards another with
[56:09] What Love in honor preferring one
[56:11] another not
[56:13] slothful in business fervent in spirit
[56:17] serving the
[56:19] lord I'll say it's time that we give up
[56:22] or belittling one
[56:23] another disrespecting one another defra
[56:26] ing one
[56:27] another 1 Corinthians 12:21 I just want
[56:30] to go through a few of these scriptures
[56:32] because we're kind of like a body and
[56:34] and I look at David and his men were so
[56:36] tight they just they respected one
[56:40] another they had different roles right
[56:43] it wasn't David that went and got it but
[56:45] they played different roles but they
[56:47] were just
[56:48] United they they loved one another there
[56:50] was respect they admiration this is how
[56:53] our home should be this is how our
[56:55] church should be this is how our
[56:56] marriages should be this is how things
[56:58] should be
[57:00] amen the eye cannot say unto the hand I
[57:04] have no need of thee nor again the head
[57:09] to the feet I have no need of
[57:13] you notice in other words there's no
[57:18] respect but for some reason we have this
[57:22] idea that our actions have often said I
[57:27] don't need
[57:29] you you know I'm just going to I'm just
[57:31] going to tally out of the church I
[57:33] already don't need
[57:35] them come
[57:40] on it's awful quiet you know what I've
[57:44] got the whole day in my hand I've Got
[57:52] The Look we may not say those words but
[57:56] we need to show one another that we need
[57:59] them especially if they're
[58:02] weaker especially if they're weaker it's
[58:04] our job
[58:07] amen as we treat one another as we don't
[58:09] need them or we're better off without
[58:11] them but we we need
[58:14] them we don't want a a selfish
[58:20] attitude nay much more verse 22 those
[58:25] members of the body which seem to be
[58:27] more feeble are
[58:35] necessary much more the feeble
[58:39] members you know
[58:41] what they the Bible just put me or those
[58:46] of us that are strong underneath them in
[58:49] that scripture God put us at our place
[58:51] brother
[58:53] Ron and that's where we need to be yes
[58:57] amen and those members of the body which
[58:59] we think we think to be less honorable
[59:04] upon these we bestow more abundant
[59:09] honor and our comly parts have more
[59:12] abundant
[59:13] comeliness the people we think that are
[59:15] unpleasant to look at or unpleasant to
[59:18] be around it's those people who have we
[59:23] think they haven't accepted our
[59:24] standards living up to our are those
[59:27] people are the people that we need to
[59:32] honor not
[59:36] because they're not caring as much as
[59:40] you but because they need
[59:43] you there's difference they need
[59:47] you okay has anybody ever gotten a cut
[59:51] before how about you brother s you ever
[59:53] been cut you ever been cut at the
[59:54] Martin's house Martin shop with this
[59:59] church okay so what happens when

[1:00:13] situation
[1:00:15] here we don't say you know I don't know
[1:00:18] what's wrong with you you put your hand
[1:00:19] in the wrong spot you got cut and that's
[1:00:21] you you deal with

[1:00:41] back we help the part that is not doing
[1:00:44] as much as we like it to be doing
[1:00:46] amen sometimes we just we don't look at
[1:00:49] one another with a spirit of helping a
[1:00:52] spirit of AD admiration I mean I can
[1:00:55] show you right here I'm cut there but
[1:00:59] that doesn't mean I I I need to bestow
[1:01:02] more honor I need to bestow more
[1:01:03] attention it it needs me right
[1:01:06] now the problem is we see one another's
[1:01:09] got problems I deal
[1:01:14] it oh God's got to deal with him yeah it
[1:01:17] does God in
[1:01:19] you God and you's got to deal with
[1:01:22] it see the the problem is we're missing

[1:01:30] well brother John you're going to say I
[1:01:32] don't got God I'm gonna say don't try to
[1:01:36] make it with how much God you do got
[1:01:38] that's what I'm
[1:01:40] saying deeper deeper higher higher more
[1:01:45] more
[1:01:48] press here's the thing if we all had the
[1:01:51] attitude when we when we come to church
[1:01:52] every day and in our life we live this
[1:01:54] in our home that we have
[1:01:56] attained but we're pressing towards
[1:02:01] it I say God I'll meet you
[1:02:05] there I'll meet you there let me ask you
[1:02:08] I are we past time or do I still got

[1:02:24] ped that's how much I am so much into my
[1:02:27] message I cannot even figure out how
[1:02:29] long I'm supposed to
[1:02:32] preach that that
[1:02:34] is I I you can see I need prayer all uh
[1:02:38] what is that called when that comes in
[1:02:40] you start forgetting you guys were
[1:02:41] talking about that earlier let's stand
[1:02:43] together oh my oh my I can't believe I

[1:02:48] maybe if it would be the will of the
[1:02:50] lord we may continue we may
[1:02:53] continue amen
[1:02:56] I don't know I for just a moment I lost
[1:02:59] I lost sight there but praise the Lord
[1:03:01] how many feels that God is really
[1:03:03] dealing with you
[1:03:05] amen right you
[1:03:08] know and here's the big I say the
[1:03:10] biggest thing do you do you want to deal
[1:03:14] with God
[1:03:16] yes that that's what's so important that
[1:03:20] that you want to go in the direction
[1:03:22] that you want to be like Jesus that
[1:03:24] because that's all all we preached on
[1:03:25] was was who God is that's right we
[1:03:28] didn't we didn't preach anybody else or
[1:03:30] anything else or my ideas it was just
[1:03:33] taking from the scripture if we read the
[1:03:35] scripture with a desire God show me
[1:03:37] something in here that you want me to
[1:03:39] see we we we'll see admiration and
[1:03:43] respect because that's what we're
[1:03:45] looking for amen let's just bow our
[1:03:48] heads and a word of prayer
[1:03:54] and hold our desire before the Lord
[1:03:57] Heavenly
[1:04:00] Father Lord my my hands are lifted and
[1:04:05] joined together with my brothers and
[1:04:07] sisters this
[1:04:09] morning my heart is united with their
[1:04:12] hearts my desires United with their
[1:04:15] desires and my prayer is uniting with
[1:04:18] their prayers right now
[1:04:20] Lord
[1:04:22] Lord we want to we want to be in your
[1:04:25] image and we know your image is is one
[1:04:27] of respect you
[1:04:30] never you never
[1:04:33] demanded Judas to get out of the
[1:04:40] discipleship you
[1:04:42] never you're a
[1:04:45] gentleman and you've you've always
[1:04:48] found good things in US
[1:04:53] Lord you're you're you are
[1:04:56] recognized by the Christian world that
[1:04:59] you are a good
[1:05:04] God and it's your goodness that leads us
[1:05:06] to
[1:05:09] repentance and Lord I'm asking you today
[1:05:12] that you would help turn our lives
[1:05:15] around For Your
[1:05:18] Glory that Lord that church would not be

[1:05:33] sing praises to you may we offer the
[1:05:36] sacrifice of praise
[1:05:39] continually Lord I believe that if we
[1:05:42] could
[1:05:43] just try to practice worshiping you and
[1:05:46] praising you more that we'd find less
[1:05:48] time to listen to the thoughts that
[1:05:50] would be discouraging about
[1:05:53] others I ask God In The Name of Jesus
[1:05:55] Christ that you bless our homes you take
[1:05:58] control of every spirit in our home
