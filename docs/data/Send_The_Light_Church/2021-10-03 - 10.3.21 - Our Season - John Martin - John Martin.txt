to just come and hear from him amen amen well i just like to change the order of service a little bit here um our sister kathleen i believe is going to give a testimony and then we'll take up some prayer requests you want to come forth sister hi good to be back in the house of the lord um my testimony is about my illness and i just wanted to tell all of you at one time what's going on with me um first of all i'm not hoarse at all today praise the lord i've been up north for a week and haven't been around any cleaning fluids or any pts or anything and just relaxing so i'm sure that'll help but i know you've been praying for me all summer and i went to university of michigan about three weeks ago um i got an answer from and i know it was from the lord but i have a neurological disease called als um it's fatal there's um no one that's ever survived it um except one man who had stem cell excuse me i'm trying to get my cough drop disease and he lived about three years and then passed away from a brain tumor but [Music] i serve a great god and this is what i told the doctor when she asked me what was on my bucket list i said my bucket list there's nothing on my bucket list except making a rapture you know so but i think i should kind of shocked her but i just said there's nothing on my bucket list i i know the lord can do a work in me this is not like lou gehrig's disease it's different and the way she explained it to me was that there was an umbrella called als like there is flu and there's many different types of als that fall into that category mine is familiar or genetic they're thinking because my sister tomorrow will be at the same doctor getting her diagnosis she's been going through more than i've been going through she can hardly walk and so anyways it's a progressive disease mine has been my arm and so mine is right sided familiar genetic type of als which i never even heard of before there's only about 5 000 patients in the united states and in michigan i think about 200 and i doubt if there's any two sisters that are going through this at the same time a long time ago i went before the lord because of this church like isaiah did and i said lord use me to save my family i'm the only one saved i have been for 38 years no and you see no hope on the horizon whatsoever until i got this diagnosis and i did testify a little bit on our stream about that how my sister she wanted a bible and she's been reading the bible she's given brought two of her friends bibles i mean it's just kind of crazy how the lord works you know i just you pray and you pray and you pray and you think lord are you ever going to answer my prayers but he has answered my prayers and i know you're praying for my healing and i'm praying for it too and i believe with all my heart that i will not die from als i i'm telling you right now i just believe it okay and and there's there's nothing else i can say when i say that to people they think i'm nuts but i'm telling you because of this church and the faith that god has put in my heart these last 19 years of being here i can stand up here and i can say that and with humility okay with god's grace and his mercy is that it will be a testimony to my sister for her salvation my other two sisters who are so liberal you can't even believe it but you know what their their hearts have turned because of this diagnosis and i've prayed that the lord would not take it from me until his will is accomplished in what he gave it to me for and i know that there is a purpose but when i stood before the lord and said lord send me i meant every everything about it and if this is what it has to be then so be it so be it i couldn't stand here and say that today if it wasn't for sin the light because then the light has brought that faith of a mustard seed to fruition and we have seen miracles we we have seen jessica ward walk in here who was hit by a train and has half a brain and shouldn't be and her blind she was blind she's not she's going to college she's a wonderful beautiful girl and so many other things have happened here maybe people will consider little miracles but anyways i want to just testify that this is what it is and and brother marty has been my rock through everything he shouldn't be sitting here either there's no reason why that man should have lived through an a triple a an abdominal aortic aneurysm except for god's grace and that he has a purpose here like every one of us here do so be faithful and and and just pray for me for strength sister cheryl gave me some good advice a couple months ago and she said i just quit praying for myself i just asked for god to give me strength to get through another day and be a witness for him and that's what i want i want to have her strength she's been going through this for 10 years you know and i can't say that my situation is any worse than hers or hers is worse than mine or any other of you here that suffer in any way shape or form be it mental physical or psychological or spiritual you know we all we all need the strength and i just asked brother john if i could tell you all at one time what i'm going through so you're not wondering um and yeah yeah i've had some bad days i'm not going to tell you i haven't had some bad days i can hardly reach my arm so it's really hard to get things out of the cover i'm in pt two and a half hours a couple times a week i can hardly breathe when i come out of there because of the cleaning and disinfectants and stuff i'm allergic to but i got to keep going and my doctor said my my dr brownstein who of my 30 years he's taken care of me holistically just keep walking kathleen and when he said keep walking kathleen that was the holy spirit saying just keep walking forward kathleen he's given me a promise and i'm going to stand on it and i thank you from the bottom of my heart that you believe that i have brothers and sisters of like faith that believe like i do and can lift we can lift one another up during these times so i'm sorry i can't be much help around here as much as i used to be but you have a wonderful sunday school teacher now and you have a beautiful music ministry here i am playing the dulcimer at home it's good for my hand and stuff but i'm just not coordinated enough to do a lot of things anymore that i used to do i'm still quilting it's good for my mind praise the lord cheryl has a greenhouse i have my quilts god bless you [Applause] hallelujah um you know it's pretty simple uh sometimes we make things complicated but uh we're just called to believe so sometimes you think well i don't see things happening and but you know you gotta look what spirit you gotta look with spiritual eyes you know so because you know god is a spirit right so we can't look with these carnal eyes or not only will you be discouraged but uh that's what the devil wants you to do he wants you to look with your natural eyes and not just spiritual eyes because god is a spirit and all things are possible and i think that's the testimony that they are we all have you know there's always been a time i think there's always a time in somebody's life where god speaks to him and shows them something and you just need to stand on that you know because it might be 20 years might be 30 years it might you know you might not even see it in your lifetime but it will happen because god's the same yesterday today and he's not a liar so amen so just as we go into these other prayer requests just remember that uh it's in god's times but they are god answers prayers amen let's just remember to lift up mother bill sanchez he had his gallbladder uh removed and he's just requesting a prayer for healing also that god would open the eyes of i believe jessica this is from my brother mike also for the gabrielle um she's asking for uh to find a house amen um a situation um well just trust in the lord and if anybody knows a house to rent then i think they're looking to just see gabrielle and she'd appreciate that also our brother bruce pray for us as we travel on vacation for the next two weeks amen so let's just travel and mercies for our brother bruce and sister donna amen uh somebody just has requests plus uh bless our a new church and all who shall honor amen i think we can all second that and our sister kathleen and brother marty please pray for jennifer holland the daughter-in-law of our friend she is in the hospital for pancreatic and is waiting to heal in order to have surgery on her gallbladder amen so she's just looking to get to the point where she can have a surgery amen also our sister helms uh please pray for davian he needs uh jesus in in his life amen and also jessica as well also if you could just remember a friend of mine his name's uh sam him and his wife laurie has got coveted he called me the other day just asking for prayer um you know sometimes you know you don't know in your life but uh you you come to the point where you find that people ask are asking you for prayer and it's just because they see that connection between you and god amen so let's just lift them up use the opportunity to show them that they can have that same connection amen let's stand amen um brother marty you feel like uh leading us in prayer that there are physical without faith nothing will be accomplished so lord we ask that you strengthen our faith lords and if any of us have any unbelief that you would take that away from us as well and bless each and every one here that is uh you just pray that they would uh be

things now as we commit the service to you in jesus precious name we pray amen amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of ecclesiastes for opening scripture i want to welcome gabrielle and jonathan here today god bless you thank you for joining with us amen and what a blessing it is to see sister trina and at least two of her daughters here today amen ecclesiastes chapter three starting what verse 1 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the sun under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted and i want to drop down to verse 11 he have made everything beautiful in his time also you have set the world in their hearts so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end god bless you may be seated we want to entitle this message today our season as for a subject to become one there was a season for us to be here on leroy street this season started 20 years or over 20 years ago 20 years in february of 2001 actually and now that season has come to an end for all of us to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted there are a lot of purposes under heaven we could say that god has used this season here for many purposes but i want to draw our attention to one particular that each of us have been predestined to and we find that in ephesians chapter 1 verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him that worketh all things after the council of his own will amen even when we are so stubborn and we want to do our own thing god is really in control we may uh resist to do god's will in our life but god is going to fulfill his will he's going to make all things work together after the council of his will and we the elect of god i say the elect have been predestinated for that purpose amen god's purpose for our lives we've been predestined to carry it out not in just a general way but a particular purpose to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven amen but i want to draw our attention to a particular purpose that god had in his mind at the very beginning before there was a beginning amen god has always wanted a family ephesians 3 verse 14 says for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named we're all named jesus amen just like adam and eve they were both named adam we're a part of jesus amen there was a season that god actually hid his eternal desire about his family for a family amen i know a lot of people have speculated that god wants to do different things and certainly even in the world people wondered what does god really want what could he what does he really want got all these different churches and all these different beliefs and you got to do this you got to follow that the do's and don'ts but really god has just wanted a family amen god had angels and messengers and cherubians and seraphims and a whole host of angelic beings the bible tells us some just constantly are crying holy holy holy unto the lord amen but something was missing in the heart of god god wanted someone to be in his own image and in his own likeness and obviously those creatures those angelic creatures weren't like that but he wanted someone in his own image in his own likeness to share eternity with ephesians chapter 3 verse 1 says for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation the grace of god which is given to me to you word how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote a four in few words you can read a little bit about that in chapter one whereby when you read he may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel jesus said in john chapter 10 verse 16 he said and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be there shall be one fold and one shepherd amen so god was not only going to bring the jews and gentiles together but he was going to take a bride out of the gentiles to be his wife [Music] ephesians chapter 5 verse 30 for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones can you say amen to that for this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined together joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but really what i'm speaking is concerning christ and the church amen we are to leave our carnal self-centered fleshly will our first nature we're to leave it and be married to the will of christ i speak concerning christ and the church that's what he's talking about but he gave us an example in human life how we can understand how a marriage takes place and yes there are a lot of ruffles in our marriages ones we never thought on our wedding day yesterday we went to a wedding and saw them give their vows if we only knew the problems that we were going to happen after at that moment instead of do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife yes i do we'd probably be saying i gotta think this thing through man i know what i'm gonna be going through god knew how many times we'd fall how many times we'd leave him how many times we feel like quitting right it's true but greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world god wants us to become one amen remember jesus and his disciples in the upper upper chamber at the end of his season on earth it was a very intimate personal time that jesus was having with his apostles with his disciples he said i'm going to come back in the form of the holy ghost and i'm going to be with you forever of course they didn't understand it they didn't they didn't they didn't know about it but he said here in verse 20 of chapter 17 of saint john i said that backwards john 17 verse 20 very intimate at the end he's going to send a message he says neither pray i for these alone but i pray for them also which shall believe on me through their word so thankful for the new testament that word that they gave us that we could believe that word from the apostles because jesus was praying for us if we believe amen and he says that they all may be one the very motive that god has for us to become one with him amen as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which those gives me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one now that's a very tall order to be one with god to be one with christ or to be one with the word as the word in christ was one with god amen the father that's a tall order amen amen it's much different than joining the church put your name on the book say i'm a believer i could see why the bible says the righteous scarcely make it right it's not as easy as the devil would tell you right it's true it takes a dying out every day this morning when i got on my knees i just when you get on your knees you see how real and rotten your flesh is you don't want to pray don't want to humble itself i don't want to yield to god it wants to go through the motions and say i prayed but god wants our hearts amen he says i in them and thou in me that they may be not just one but me be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and thou has loved them as thou has loved me i wasn't just praying for the apostles then he was praying for you and me amen god wants the world to see jesus in you to see the oneness that you have with christ getting back to ephesians chapter 3 verse number 7 whereof paul says i am made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power not to me who am less than the least of all saints i wonder if there's anybody who would like to practice that in the church anybody want to practice being the least of all the saints i say there would be a good spirit among you amen is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world had been hidden god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be made known by the church who's supposed to let the world know the church the manifold wisdom of god he orchestrated this thing from the beginning hid it from the devil amen amen hit it through the ages but it's made known to us what god's real intent is with our lives according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord amen god had a season for our church here there was a time that this church was planted and there was the season to be here at 1542 north leroy street and it certainly didn't look like much from the world it was just another building but the church this room was dedicated to god nothing special outside when you dedicate something to god god takes it amen that's the beauty of dedicating your lives to god now a lot of times we've come into church with all types of spirits on us right all types of ideas all types of moods and all things and we we've all had a hard job keeping this place holy keeping it dedicated for god keeping him lifted up and first keeping ourselves last that their season is over god had a particular purpose for this church that was directly connected to his eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord do you believe that there were a lot of people who came and were gone there are people who didn't want to go to hell there were people who just wanted to go to heaven but there was a lot more to it than that not very many people were interested in becoming in the image of god amen in the likeness of god they don't mind if they just you know repent get baptized put your name on the book say okay i believe the message that's right but that is not coming into the image of god that is not coming into the likeness of god that's you stating i'm gonna start and head in that direction there just weren't very many people were interested in becoming completely born again that's right it's not he that starts it's he that endure it to the end we got to keep moving forward i really enjoyed sister kathleen's testimony talking about our purpose talking about moving forward didn't seem like there were very many people who really wanted to act like jesus to love unconditionally like jesus to be perfect just as jesus told us to be perfect and love even our enemies just like his father loved his enemies to be patient and long-suffering and kind and merciful and delayed on our lives and to live for others amen but this is truly the eternal purpose that god had this church it doesn't fit everybody's purpose that's why they've come and they've gone but i'm so thankful for this bible it gives us an example of what we need to be amen the apostles and paul devoted his life to saving others think about that statement they devoted their life to get other family members in for god's eternal purpose to have a family it's awful quiet but i'll tell you to me this is what this whole thing's about amen i know we got other ideas we all we all want other things we want to we want to go other places and do other things but god is interested in his family there are souls out there that are not in god does not love me more than he loves them god wants them in as much as he wants me in amen now how is god going to get them in he's going to use us he's going to use us that are willing to get in the vein of god's eternal purpose to labor for him give up our time amen i'll say if your son was lost wouldn't you go get him amen reminds you of this story where the the whole this boy was lost in this village and the whole village went out looking for him because he was lost and they found him finally too much travail at night and they had a party they were rejoicing because he was okay but someone in that same village was lost going to hell and nobody seemed to care but our heavenly father he cares he cares amen because it's not about this life that he just cares about amen he said i'm not of this world amen amen it's about eternal life and it's hard to to get this across to people because everybody's involved in this life so much right so they think about it's not taught in the schools we need to look to god about eternal life we need to pray before we eat our food at lunchtime we need to give thanks to god for the day he's given us no let's take prayer out of the schools let's bring in evil the world's going down to two sounds like i am too devil didn't like that one it's hard to be a witness in this age for christ i want to give you some consolation jesus would not even allow his own apostles who he walked with the responsibility to go do it themselves he said you wait until i fill you with my spirit and then you shall be witnesses for me he won't entrust anybody to do it but himself amen inside of us not very many seem strongly interested in being in his image and being in his likeness but the purpose that god had ordained this church sunderland has always been to given to provide an opportunity for us to grow in christ to become one with him to become one with the word amen we can't do that until we find out where we're at with god right we can't come to church and just think oh i'm just completely fine with god just give me more information that is not how it works we should be interested in what happened the last week that's right yes god is interested not just just fixing the little bad things that we did last week how many prayed today lord forgive me for my thoughtfulness yeah god god just don't want that little bitty thing fixed i prayed that same prayer i'm with you you don't want just that little thing fixed he wants our life given to him amen he wants us to become one with him more than we've ever become amen not just saying i'm in the message but the message living in us and manifesting what god really sent malachi 4 5. to become in his image to become in his likeness amen this church has been providing us with an opportunity for over 20 years to become more and more in his image to think about some would make it when they just read one message to whom much is given much is required the hardest thing i believe is to hear the truth and not have a burning desire to live it that's true amen you go home and you live in misery because you refuse to lay down your life to love your enemy to reach out for souls so you just try to get by the best that you can and it is a miserable walk the prophet said you might as well just go back and live in the world if you're not going to give it all it's true amen that's right amen i'm just talking overall you got to come to grips with the situation that you're in take a stand drive a state downside i'm not going to listen to your devil amen yeah i've been listening your lives long enough i'm moving forward i'm gonna become one with christ i'm gonna i'm gonna really make a rapture and here's the thing who would want to make a rapture and not be in his likeness in his image beforehand i feel i'd be stealing the heaven i'll be stealing and be robbing god amen the bible says when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is amen i believe god has given us an opportunity to become more and more like jesus every time we come to church to take it seriously to take the word and say i don't know i'm going to do it lord but i want to live this word at home i want to do what you want me to do place yourself in the hands of god put your faith on the test that you can grow in christ that you can become more in his image don't let satan tell you all you got to do is this and all you got to do is that come on get by with just church attention get by with a little offering get by which is saying you believe the bible get by what you're saying i pray i pray no you've got to become in this image look in the mirror of his word amen that's what it's here for amen i mean sometimes our flesh wish we didn't hear the word now we become responsible responsible for it i like how brother branham said the character of the church he said the beauty of the church is the character of the people and i've always been okay with this place that looked like this to me if god wanted to be recognized what we learned as a barn a stable but we we know to be a little hole in the rocks god could be hid right here but he's here for a purpose that purpose is you amen for you to become him amen to become one with him not just to grow in knowledge amen because you grow in the manifestation of that knowledge amen amen to say i'm like you jesus i'm a chip off the whole block put me through the test let me come through the fire let me love like you let me lay down my life let me give you myself let me give you my time amen amen not just an hour here and now we're there not saying oh that's the church i go to no this is the god i serve 24 7. it's in my life he's changed me from glory to glory we should all better look and see a growth happening in our lives a steady growth can you imagine if an oak tree just said you know i want to just stop growing for a couple years ain't gonna happen it's gonna come to out to the sun all right it's gonna drink in the rain because its roots are there and god is faithful amen we can't expect god just to always come to our little world right when god has provided a place to meet you amen it's our the bible says the bible does not say god will draw an eye to you and when he does you draw an eye to him bible says you get up go to church you draw an eye to god then he'll draw an eye to you now of course you do that in your home we should the part of his image and his likeness that we need to be is his character and brother branham said a christian life the real character of a christian he said it's a hard rugged life it's not an easy peasy you're full of the love of god right and it puts you out yonder winning souls for jesus christ amen because his eternal purpose that he had before adam was ever created was to have a family amen and we we were not born right after adam we were not born during jonah during noah during elijah right right during the times of jesus amen he saved us for the end amen and in the end we're to become more like him amen yes sir in this age we're to represent jesus christ more than any other age amen to whom much is given much is required if there's ever a time we need to press in to pray for our precious brothers and sisters that we sit next to amen that we worship with this is the hour we need one another because satan is stronger he's doing everything he can to stop god's eternal purpose that god ordained this church for a season to be used for his eternal purpose to make men see what god wants is a very special family relationship amen a fellowship that you can only have with a wife right and that fellowship can only go so far you know when your wife or your husband is being a little standoffish or a brother you just can't go up to them you don't feel like going up to them and just spilling out your whole heart is that true the bible says he hid himself from the wise and prudent right amen he reveals himself to babes yes the why is it prudent they're a little standoffish you know they got it all figured out they don't need you because they got it well sometimes it's really hard to say something to your your wife or your husband when they're being standoffish so until we become more and more in his likeness in his image we can't really have that fellowship that he wants to have with us we don't want to be satisfied with the blessing of god all right i found his presence came over me this happened in my life that no i want him with me all the time i want to feel him all the time i want to be led by his spirit all the time i want to know what he wants me to do and i want to do with all my heart amen i want that fellowship to be that close we've got to work on our adoption credentials we've got to press out of laodicea and press into god's kingdom we've got to press towards the mark amen verse 9 to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world had been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that noun to the principalities and powers in how many places might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of god according to his eternal purpose which he purposed in jesus christ our lord now when you got time i'd like you to go ahead and read the rest of this because it talks about the family and how that we need to let's just read it i guess if we're going to be a little bit late tonight our last service we can do it right amen verse 14. well let's just keep read verse 12 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by faith in him wherefore i desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory in other words paul said i endure all things for the elect's sake don't feign over it don't worry about what i'm going through because i'm doing it for god's purpose he says for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man now notice what he wants for his family that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that you being rooted and grounded in love like if if the roots aren't love if you're not grounded in love it's just a matter before somebody's going to say something he's going to tip you over and you're going to get bothered all upset right right right but god wants us rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the other believers that really believe the word what is the breath the length the depth and the height and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that it that he might be filled with all the fullness of god when we know the love of christ it not only passes knowledge but it ushers in the fullness of god that's how important love is because god is love amen god wants a relationship it will be in love if satan could have got what he wanted in heaven he would have stayed there if god would allow him to be above him to let his selfish nature be the preeminence in the church there he would have stayed but number one god won't have it amen and god kicked him out amen my house shall be called a house of prayer it's god's house with god's family that is filled with his love so strong they can love their enemy yes they don't have to turn my no they turn the cheek and say they have a compassion inside i want you to know the god that i know amen to know that to be filled with the fullness of god amen now unto him that is able to do exceedingly above all that we ask or think according to the power the power that works in you should have an expectation of a power inside of you you want more power go to the source amen that's right i know if i want to plug the vacuum cleaner in i just can't put the the plug into stan's hand there's no power there i gotta i gotta put it in the receptacle and where the source of power is at right amen i don't care how much power brother my mark has but mike [Music] and i can't just say i'm in the message god i'm in the message many will come to me in that day say lord lord was i not in the message i've got to have the power in me the power to lay down my life the power to do his will right amen the power to exercise god's eternal purpose while i'm down here like it just breaks my heart i have children some serve the lord a few serve the lord a couple served the lord [Laughter] the majority do not as a as a parent it breaks my heart i would never want that if i had to do it all over i'd do the very same thing that i did try to be a better parent try it we'll try yeah but still in my bible studies i still pray with them you know i do my devotions but they themselves have to make their own decision amen but god has the same yearning in his heart for his lost children that we do for ours so we may not hear what we want to hear when we come to church but we're going to hear god's heart amen and it has to do with a relationship with him and for us doing his will about his eternal purpose now he taught us he taught us if we seek first the kingdom right and his righteousness then every thing else that we have on our bucket list shall be added amen do you believe that can you say amen to the word of god don't say amen to me say amen to the word of god we can't put the train before the engine right that's true we can't put the cart before the horses we can't put the engine in the trailer and no engine in the car right that's true we've got to put god first he wants to be first in the in the tithes and offerings he wants to be first in your life i'm not calling for money i'm just saying i'm trying to give a type that god wants to be first in everything amen you know this church would be so packed out if we did not preach that only thing you have to do is this just just just love god the best you can god knows god understands don't you worry you don't have to become everything like him just believe some kind of mixed up message that you really never get a good description who god is but if he wants us to become one with him then we got to know him right amen we got to know who he really is in order to become one with them that's why we we yes our flesh isn't yearning to die out our flesh is not yearning to be like jesus i understand that but the inner man that's the one this church is for it's for our souls that we can grow in christ we have a season god has given us a season here when you get time read philippians chapter 3 verse 10 through 18 to to press towards that mark that christ has given us i want you to know see all these these notes here our season here is over we've probably scrambled scramble scrabbled you all know what i'm trying to say [Music] scrabbled that's right we've all probably didn't put our heart into being here some of us sometimes just barely made it in and this god knows we're human god knows we're frail but god will not accept an attitude and all god has to do is say son daughter told me this is what i expect out of you right if a righteous man falls seven times he waits for god to come by and pick him up no that's not scripture the effectual power that's working in you amen amen something inside just stirs up right it says i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i'm not laying down here with the chickens today i'm going to come into church with faith amen i'm going to be a believer i'm going to believe god's word has never failed amen i'm not looking at john martin who's failed so many times i can't count it hey man it's okay to say amen i i know i'm a failure i'm okay with that you are too so what does it matter you're amongst failures we don't even think like some sort of graph right well since you don't have as many most turned down the opportunity that god provided but some stayed some grew the last 20 years more in the image of god some took advantage of the time to build a relationship with god while others stayed home viewed it a waste of time to go to service some wanted a place just for fellowship but some hungered for a place of worship amen some just wanted a place to hear what they wanted to hear but some thirsted for a place to hear from god our season here is over god has fulfilled his purpose you could sit back and say god has fulfilled his purpose because god can't lie right isaiah chapter 55 verse 8 says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts and your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return not neither but water the earth and make it that bring forth bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater in other words there is a very long purpose i was talking to my wife yesterday as we pulled in the driveway from a long trip to witness and celebrate this wedding that we went to and as i was pulling in i was saying think many years ago when we lived in brighton that god knew that we were going that there was going to be a church right on centerville that there was going to be a trusted two there was going to be a church here right right true she began to to share that she was so content living in in fentanyl or in brighton so content but something started stirring in her and it it became so strong that she just said lord i'm content staying here but if your will is something different your will be done god spoke to her and said that we should move from the move from the city to the country and i said i want you to think about that time that god spoke that to you god knew in his mind what would be happening today amen god has a purpose for every one of us god wants to use us in his kingdom god wants to use us to get the rest of the family in that's what it's about it's not about what we want it to be not about what our flesh wants it to be it's about his eternal purpose he's the one whose thoughts are higher and has something greater for us than our thoughts so when you get thoughts we always want to say well you got the mind of christ say lord help me lord i just want to be sure stay neutral to just the the over when you know you just want to lay down your life for a soul you know you're on the right track if that's your real motive you know you're on the right track verse 11 so shall my word be that go forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in a thing wherein two i sent it amen god has fulfilled his purpose in our season here our lives have prospered our spiritual lives have prospered in this season can you say amen god's word has not returned unto him void it has accomplished what pleased him and it has prospered in this place where unto his senate do you believe that i believe with all my heart when ten lepers pleaded for mercy jesus willingly healed all ten of them but only one of them turned back and glorified god with a loud voice the bible says that he fell down on his face at the feet of jesus and gave him but jesus's tension was not drawn to him jesus's tension was drawn to the nine that were not there because something was missing god wanted praise from all ten right amen and i'll tell you if nine of them would have came to praise him his attention would be drawn to that one amen i'll say today we have an opportunity to praise god for what he has done for us in this place don't let god's attention be drawn to you because you won't stand and testify for him right right right he's worthy he's worthy i believe that one was so thankful that he was willing to crucify his flesh whatever it took and express something that was so strong inside of him the other nine might have just had too much pride i got things going you know i got a business i married a wife i bought some oxen jesus did something for that man that he didn't do for the other nine that's right i don't think he was just made whole naturally right right amen god is a god that reciprocates in a relationship sometimes our battery just goes out we stop reciprocating god's waiting for us to make the first move draw nigh to god he'll draw an eye to you let's give thanks for the season that god has given us amen let's stand together there are a lot of things that we could testify of but we've dedicated just a little bit of time to just thank him for what he's done for us in this place because this place was dedicated to him and i'm thankful that he's given us a place amen let's just bow in a word of prayer heavenly father lord we thank you for all that you've done for us in this season it wasn't in vain lord we're all been drawn closer to you and we're thankful we're full of thanksgiving lord we want to express to you a life of thankfulness if you never ever ever ever ever did another thing for us lord we could never thank you enough for what you have done amen you have blessed us above abundantly lord receive our heart of thanksgiving lord as we move forward in this relationship with you we want to become more one with you we want to become more in your image and mourn your likeness lord i pray that you'd help each one of us to dedicate herself to that purpose that eternal purpose lord use us to win our brother and her sister who don't even know that we are brothers and sisters yet in christ make us one make us one in purpose lord we commit ourselves to you we give you thanks in jesus precious name amen amen god bless you may be seated i just want to take a a few moments and if anybody wanted to to testify and if you don't testify it's okay please don't don't don't feel pressured i just want you to know i wouldn't be a good pastor if i didn't tell you that god doesn't want to hear from you god does he does i don't know where this should go but we just want to make sure that we get brother martin praise the lord all right who who wants to go what we what we want to do honestly we just we want to keep it somewhat short we don't want to do a 10-minute er um but i'll tell you we'll have opportunities to testify at the other church i think every service should have a testimony amen god god's con and the more that we can testify what god's doing for us on a weekly basis a daily basis when we come and just encouraging amen amen amen brother jason go ahead brother i just like to say that i i think i owe my whole life to this church you know i was pretty sickly and you know i died and three times and y'all prayers amen and god stood up and took control of it and brought me here and i'm here today because of it amen amen wonderful praise god amen appreciate what our sister kathleen had said about the prayers of the saints she believes she believes in god amen and she believes in god in you in your prayers amen praise the lord i came here with my aunt on um i don't know i don't know when i came here my mom passed away in 1915. i came here from another from a from a denominational church the church chair it wasn't it wasn't safe it was southwind and it wasn't really he were a good church but it wasn't really my style of church and i was going i was raised up there and brought up there but it wasn't really this church has been more of a home to me you have been more my pastor was a pastor to me and bishop of the bishop to me but you have been more of a bishop and a pastor and a friend to me and everybody here has been a friend of me and all that and i i was in an auto accident in 1990 and they covered me up with the cover and they died and the mother said no we don't want to cover them up because we because i was paralyzed on the right side all the way down and this time i never walk or talk ever again look at me am i walking am i talking praise god thank you jesus medical doctor told my mother i would never walk never talk never do nothing like that again my mother got a phone call about three more about two months three and a half months later about two and a half months later you're are you coming nine years are you gonna come down and see your son a friend of hers calling her up yeah i'm getting dressed i'm getting get in the shower good because your son just said hi to a nurse this morning forgot to get a shower and all that she just jumped up and got ready i was when i was waving to everybody and the nurse my right arm was moving and everything thank you satan trying to keep me down and put me in the ground yeah but god almighty brought me up that's right praise the lord yes um we came to this church in 2005. um we had had a some of you know we had a tragic accident in our family um lost a eight-year-old daughter in a car accident and at that time i was just searching i went to baptist churches i went to catholic churches we were going to methodist churches and when it happened it was just our lives were just flipped upside down and i was just i didn't know what to do except i didn't know the lord um i did a little bit of when i was um i went to a baptist church when i was a child really young i remember sunday school and i remember jesus a little bit but i really never um i don't know we just we searched we came here and when we walked out of the first service here and we remember it like it was yesterday she looked right at me and she said well what'd you think and i was like well it was it was different it was it was different because the love that you guys had for the lord was just something that i never experienced i never went into a church where they were free to worship um it was different it was just totally different and i felt the presence of the lord and i told her that immediately immediately after all the churches we searched i told her the very first time we walked up this is home this is it i feel the lord i know he's there and i just i just felt the wholeness and it was and then ever since then it's this has been our our home our family amen and uh we just love ollie and just the lord is here he has done miracle things i mean it's just we came to this church i don't know how many years ago now it was it was before 2003 so i i don't remember what year we came but my son dennis finally found this church for us we have been searching we have been going to churches i had been baptized so every church i went and then they told me when you still have to get baptized again because you were never baptized in jesus name so anyways i got baptized again after but we searched in search until we thought you know this church is not right this was not right you know we just went back and forth and we found this and this church was more like a church home it was a family atmosphere and we we just enjoyed it and my um husband got sick in 2003 the ending of 2003 and um brother john baptized my husband he had never been baptized i don't know if he had but not in jesus name i know we were sprinkled once in the methodist church so we didn't know you know we didn't know that nobody preached to us that we had to be baptized in jesus name you know so we did so um my husband um came one time he was too ill to uh come you know continue and but he he got baptized before he passed out amen praise the lord and a lot of people have come and gone since i've been here but i was determined i was going to stay amen i didn't want to go nowhere else i felt i was at the right place amen praise the lord oh well i just want you know there's a commonerity if you listen to everybody's message or testimony right and it's the same with mine but it comes from the word of god and that says you'll find me when you search with you with all your heart so the commonality is is people knew that wherever they were wasn't right and it was the same with me but when god is faithful to his word so when you're searching for god faithfully with all your heart he'll put you where you need to be and this is where he led us and like brother roger said you know uh it's pretty when you're searching and you find it there's you know your search is over yes so um all i can say is that for 20 some years however long it's been here you know the church is over now it's just a matter of applying the word and the spirit of the word amen amen amen praise the lord praise the lord i believe brother ron and sister trina were the one of the first three that we baptized i remember there were three people were baptized at the beginning and praise god for his faithfulness amen sister trina go ahead oh oh i'm sorry brother larry i i said i wouldn't let sister trina go first you'll go next i promise i could have many things to say but i'm just going to be a proxy for jim um i have a message from jim for a testimony jim kurtz kurzweil christ sir okay i spoke with him yesterday and so i'm checking on him seeing how he's doing so he gave a message and it's on audio so i'm not turning up for you guys i just enjoy listening to john i had thrown out my [Music] twice went to a chiropractor toys and sister these guys mumbled something [Music] [Applause] praise the lord [Music] [Applause] with uh alcohol it might have breathed pretty bad i was in the homeless situation and just down on my run or when i surrendered i found that in my weaknesses [Music] but there's nothing like the will of god in your life and uh experience the joy of your abundant life so i will continue to pray for the sound delight family and challenge everyone to memorize [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] and ask god's birth have a powerful prayer life because i got evidence of results many many times so god bless and many blessings to the center late congregation amen amen the lord jesus christ is my king and my savior yes amen i'm my redeemer amen and i believe that god power raised them up from the dead like to thank all leaves i know our bodies are the temples that he dwells in that he works through and your bodies are the temples that he worships i know god is merciful he's giving his understanding he's long suffering and i know he's there with me because i've seen us i've seen him work and he still works with me like that and i thank you for helping yourself to let him work for you because i see how patient and letting him work through thank you jesus yes praise the lord and i heard the but i wasn't a word of the word and then i obeyed and it's funny how your whole world changes amen thank you for being who you are john you're a great pastor great man my coaches everybody here just thank god for this truth amen praise the lord praise the lord brother mike yes it's linda i just want to share so grateful that i found out about you guys to brother johnson and i'm just so thankful that my son was persistent with his mom you know you know i had shared the lord with him i knew the lord but so much more has been revealed amen to being here and he did not you know give up on the fact that i was you know standing strong with money for sure this was not an occult you know and um he had written out the whole church and printed out my hand and i thought as i was reading that a lot of people could call my son to write this out there's got to be something to this you know amen and that's what he did he just things opened up and um i think well you know everyone that i've ever brought even though they may not be coming back they still are receiving it you know i know they are and i believe they're going to be here beautiful i continue to speak it to show it amen material and i just trust god to bring him in it's wonderful and i don't know if you remember but there was a young man his name was michael waters yes he's coming he was baptized here now i have not seen him or heard from him in a long time but every now and then god just puts him so heavy on my heart and i truly believe i'm going to see him walking through these these doors thank you lord even when it doesn't look like god's doing anything that's right keep trusting amen amen amen they'll be back praise the lord amen praise the lord amen amen what we're doing is we are hearing from the light we are hearing about the keeping power of the holy ghost yes amen i just feel obligated to keep john over an hour so got involved in government some bad people in the world today real bad you know john has been christ to me and kind of like a dad to me whether he's realized it or not but i've always felt that the love of god has a domino effect you feel obligated and i feel part of me feels like i owe my life to the lord in john and to the martin family i feel like i can go to their house and get in the fridge and [Laughter] um [Laughter] but the love of god is really the it's the love of god that does does it in spite of whatever you know thing that failure or whatever you know whatever it is that people battle with temper or whatever that it is it's the love of god that surpasses the whole thing amen and when you don't have it growing up it just really makes you real clingy so you wanna you wanna you wanna maintain it amen when it's real to you you just feel indebted to god and to the people that led you to the lord amen there will be people that see or on the other side that i think they'll have a sense of indebtedness to us for not giving up on them amen underestimate the privilege of it you know the privilege that we have to be able to share the gospel with people and then the reward of having them spend eternity with us just something to say this no matter what satan says to you whoever you've been testifying to whoever you've been witnessing to whatever you've been doing for the lord it's not in vain amen satan is just angry he knows he has an end he's coming soon so he's fighting really hard against our loved ones and people but he's he's he's already defeated he's not going to win anything he doesn't even understand that so don't give up on who you're talking to who you're witnessing to it means something it means it absolutely means something amen praise the lord thank you brother thinking about what brother branham shared when he went came back from the curtain of time he's exp he's expressing just a few things and one of those things was they kept saying to him we wouldn't be here if it had not been for you and i think that's what brother mike was sharing amen you know how we're going to be just so full of thanksgiving over there for those who played a part in bringing us to heaven amen amen wonderful it was a family amen right it's a spiritual family giving birth amen well brother marty god bless you i just want to come to the front so i don't have to turn your heads um you know the church you are the church this is the church all of you my precious brothers and sisters and i really appreciate all of you and uh amen kathy and i are a couple of the old-timers here uh not quite the original but we came right after we have a lot of years here wonderful years and it's the best thing that's ever happened to us honestly and the prayers from all of you is just so wonderful it's kept us going and we have a revelation of who our pastor is i know you do that's brother john and when you get that it's a precious thing that's right and he deserves all of our prayers and all of our support in every aspect monetarily spiritually the whole the whole nine yards and we're so fortunate that we're going to be going to another church but you know we've got a big battle ahead of us spiritually it's very fun and i can't think of any a better group to go through the battle within this group i appreciate that i just do want to quickly tell a quick it's a typical brother john's story when i'm done with it you'll understand but about 20 years ago we were looking for a church and we weren't sure what to do and our uh many of you know my nephew jordan jordan romberger he had spent some time in arizona and he knew uh he had met at a meeting there of abigail their oldest daughter and uh and he's he found out about the church here and he said hey can you consider going to the church in fenton and he said we never even knew about it so he gave us the number kathleen called abigail and she was so sweet she was just a wonderful and i just it it just convinced us man we got to go to that church we got at least try it because she was just so wonderful so if you ever think about how you treat people it's so important to keep positive and so we started coming here we we enjoyed it we came here a couple times and uh hadn't quite made our mind up and then one sunday brother john just blurts out that he says well i just want to i'm so glad that marty and kathleen are here i'm so glad that they're joining our church and i looked at her i said did you tell him that she said no she said did you tell her that i said no so we both figured that it was probably god that told him all the time but that's a difficult [Laughter] [Music] yeah one more thing i don't take a lot of time here i'm kind of a numbers geek as you know i'm kind of a geek so but i kind of calculated very quickly how many uh sermons that this man has produced and prepared for over the 20 years as well over 2000 of them and when you think about 2000 over 2 000 sermons each one with many many hours of preparation and all this time he's got his big family he's got a job right right he's got all these things going on and he's committed all those countless hours it's just mind-boggling and so i wanted to and all we have in this life really is a certain amount of time he has given that time to us because he married us spiritually and so i wanted to thank him personally for that great sacrifice over all these years but also the great sacrifice that his wife yes that's right he had to share him with us and he might have not been there a few times when he needed to be but uh they gave that unto the lord and also for uh sister anne and her uh siblings the whole martin family for the sacrifice they made for all of us amen thank you i'm really looking forward to getting there yeah and just going on and i expect more and more things from the lord amen and our most with the rough waters that are ahead so thank you guys hey i really wish that brother marty would just preach i'd love to just sit down he just handled it he's just like our church would be full he just he is so so good we're un worthy to have not only him but honestly we feel every one of you that's how we feel i one thing i want to say amen to is this woman is sacrificed ready the life that she intended to have with me so i did my best to become multi-talented but i praise the lord for her sacrifice amen amen any any other yes sister laurie did i just say that um i do believe the word is here i may not be the best example but i will tell you that the word is here and if you stay and you dig in like stuff i need to dig in more but it is here amen i thank god for john crossing my path years ago so i don't know where i would have been you know what god is great he's merciful and yes i know just believe in what brother john is telling us and if he didn't the name will come in the rapture i don't touch you so i thank god for his grace and mercy thank you jesus my sister kelly i have so many things to give and praise the lord about so in 88 a week after i graduated from high school my mom all of a sudden had a heart attack and passed away my mom and i were the best of friends i mean i couldn't even ask for a better mom so as i started getting older and i had to realize i had to face life on my own i didn't even know how i was going to wake up each every and every day without her i didn't know the decisions to make the steps to me i didn't know anything so i was going down a spiral because i felt that the lord did not love me and i felt that he turned his back on me so it was extremely hard for me to give my life to the lord and to even love him because he took something so precious the only thing that i had away from me so along the way when i had a dream she died she had a tear and the tear shed over me and i knew that what she was saying was that she was there to protect me the whole entire way so i said okay i wanted to keep trying because i'm a fighter that's just who i've always been a survivor and a fighter so there were so many times i didn't want to live i just wanted to go because there was nothing to live in then the lord kept bringing angels to my different people people i didn't even know and they confirmed to me what my mom would say so i knew that my mom was always there with me well i moved to florida thinking that i was going to have a better life and everything was going to be wonderful and it was for a moment i had a time of my life but that was not where the lord wanted me to be he allowed me to get sick and i died on the table and the spirit came and told me that i was going to say three people that i was going to be a strong influence in three people's lives and i didn't know who it was he was one of them amen and i sacrificed so much of my spirit and soul and i'm so proud of him amen and he dedicated himself to the lord so i know that god put me in the right position if not just for me but other people and i know that i have been such a blessing to other people as much as patricia has been to me as much as sister kathleen has prayed over and over and over day after day after day for my son and i don't ever want you to feel that that does not miss me or i don't recognize that every day right amen trina we are kindred spirits honey and you know i love you and i love everything that you've done for me and for me to protect me right and um sister laurie laurie walking this journey with you has made me feel more grounded because there are so many times where i feel like sometimes i don't belong here and i'm the outsider here because maybe my faith is not as great as everyone else's but i do have faith i have my in my own faith and my faith is maybe not what you would call similar to yours but it's strong to me in the lord my son sterling has been a trial for me since the day he was born okay and mama can contest to that right i have worked so hard for this child this is my number two individual and i have worked so hard so hard so hard breathlessly the one thing that you have to understand i had to understand when you're dealing with men with boys and with children is that you have to stand firm that they don't take control over you you take control over them and that's one of the things that i had to learn growing up raising my son and i can tell you now even though he has not come to church does not mean that he does not love you any less okay he is going to school to become a computer uh informations person and he and he tutors japanese for students and i'm so proud of where we've come because we've come a long way and finally my husband you know there have been two big important people that has been in my life that's and that they have put me through hell and back and that's my husband and that is my dad and those are the two greatest men that i love with all my heart and i knew that the lord put me in their lives for a reason and i when my daddy died he started going to church and i was so thankful because we never went to church ever okay ever so that was important to me and you know and my husband his his spirit is getting um more sensitive about it i know we have some some things that we have to kind of you know swim through and i i know that god is going to um see us through but uh he blessed me with the house i'm still here living right man i i didn't have to be here you know what i mean i didn't even want to be here right and um the final thing is is that i love my pastor and i love his wife i know cheryl probably thinks that i don't love her but i do amen okay and i just want to thank everybody and i just wanted to tell everybody how much i love them and this lady here yes she is the reason that has kept me going amen i mean outside of course the lord because we do speak of the lord and she she keeps me she was the person that came in place of my mom so i don't know what i would do without mama i tell you the truth you know i don't know what we wouldn't be poor critters up in here but mama has been such um an angel for me that i just cherish everything about her i think she's the most magnificent person ever amen and if anybody haven't tasted her monster choli in her home but anyways i just want to say thank you guys and you know i'm you know i i will come be back more and um granted lord be a part of it but and and more of a i want to do something you know where i can bring more souls here amen and i would like to be in a position where i can feel confident in my spirit where i'm ready and able to do that so i just you know i pray for you you will pray for me i love you all and god amen praise the lord our sister was a another uh one that had been married here in this little church real quick you know the gratefulness that i had and now um accepting the way everyone treated david amen amen he was definitely had battles and struggles as we all do but amen he's always talk so highly of you and he's always praying for everyone he was a great example to me in my heart the importance of praying and not giving up in prayer right now i have davian at home laying in the bed and being tormented but i know he's coming amen that's right amen he's fighting with the nail but he's coming for sure so people that you bring in and they don't look like they're coming you just don't keep don't doubt it just keep trusting envision visualize i'm sitting here in church when mike was away for a while that's all i get every day i visualized him being back in church and i remember praying one night my turn out to the lord and saying lord put some song on his mind or his heart and two days later his wife called me and says mom mike's in your singing praises to the lord and you know see what god does bring them back in amen when we think about those that were here and they're not here because they've gone on they had a season to be with us and it is much more difficult than just telling somebody this is what you need to do right if you don't enjoy washing dirty feet if you don't enjoy really getting involved uh and helping them the only thing you can do is tell somebody when they're wrong this is what you need to do it it's very hard to see them grow and we never know whether one of us isn't going to be here next service and so while we have one another we really need to be jesus to one another amen amen now there was a few people at the same time that raised their hand so please forgive me if i'm not calling on you next because it's like simultaneously everybody went up at the same time hey man you're gonna ask um sister ann you were gonna work my way um i just wanted to say i'm grateful for the ministry here um i was this is kind of where i grew up both naturally and spiritually and i know that without this ministry i would not have a chance to make a rapture and i'm just so grateful for for what god has given here amen and um i just i just want to say thank you it's been an honor to leave her alongside of you yeah and good work in the kingdom amen and i just grateful for this body everybody that's represented here and i'm just thankful for your life so thankful that you've given your hearts to the lord and i just i can't wait for the future i'm really excited for all the contests i'm just just thankful to be fighting alongside you amen amen some may think that was kind of emotion talking but i'm going to tell you since i live with her i know her life and um her life is not emotion and she she's on her last trip that we just had um she's expressed that she has been to so many different churches so many different churches heard so many different ministers so many things are happening out there when she says she is truly grateful and that she doesn't believe she could make a rapture without the church she meant that the love of her heart not because of her death because of the ministry the ministry and the ministry is god's ministry as long as we keep god first that's right and i basically i bought miles on when elizabeth went because she was my right-hand man yeah and i didn't think you know there's just anybody that could help me as much as she did but this girl has been an energizer buddy whose batteries don't go out and she's she helps at work she helps at the house she helps with the church and she doesn't live for herself that's right and i'm grateful to be associated with her and to be to to labor with somebody like her and i'm grateful i just have to give thanks to the lord for her amen sister tricia i'm just gonna say if that's okay cause my back's been hurting me but um i just want to thank the lord for his faithfulness for his long suffering you know when you made a comment about before this church was even here god knew there was going to be a church on center road and i kind of feel like that throughout my life you know i was raised in church until i was 11. i knew the truth life circumstances happened and i went my own way even though i went my own way he never stopped watching me amen amen and while i was building a life he was preparing a place for me yes because he knew there would be a time and a season and a place and he was going to have something prepared for me and i remember my father would constantly talk about the word remind me where john martin was but the church was that it wasn't far and as much as it would aggravate me in the flesh don't ever be discouraged to keep telling somebody about jesus amen because it might in the moment be more than they want to hear but it could be the lifeline that saves them amen and how my entire life circled right back around and got prepared a place for me and not that this place isn't for everybody but when i found it it was personal to me praise god it was my place and god spoke to me here and god changed my life here and i'm thankful for the word i'm thankful that not only was it a refuge but he rebuilt my life amen and i'm so eternally grateful for that praise the lord praise the lord you know i don't like to say things about what the lord has shown me but you know as a shepherd we're taught that the shepherd knows the sheep right and i know that the lord had put her in in the church for us amen and i do believe that god puts we need one another that's right and um because we are a body a local body and that we we function together and learning how to function is is a growing process and um i'm just grateful for ev every member of the body of christ amen gabrielle you were gonna share something good to have you back been many years amen yeah it's been many years um so for anybody that doesn't know me um train is my mom and we started out coming to satellite i think before we were even in this building the very first services you know i remember being a kid and you know we were in the other room and then we outgrew that room and then we ended up getting the other side of the building for sunday school and extra space and i just want to share um because there's not very many of our youth that are that are here or even serving the lord but i just want to say everybody that's still here brother john and says gerald and brother martin's history between elders of the church you know the bible says that if you train up your child in the way that they will go they will never depart from it amen and all the elders that are here have shown me and the whole youth group the things that we were supposed to be doing to prepare to be that light that's supposed to go out into this world and even though i've been gone for a long time there were things that i learned helping doing the farmers market and the golf county working at the church working at brother john scissors cheryl's something as simple as washing the dishes for cheryl when we were preparing for the farmers market i remember just washing dishes and washing dishes and washing dishes and always just helping those things were preparing me to be where i'm at right now and even though i've been gone for so long i came with my son to be real on wednesday and it was a prayer meeting and my husband and i have been talking about church and the lord's been coming back and changing things in my life and cutting things off that i've been doing and just really hey man the last five years have been really difficult of things that i've struggled with i struggled with drinking i've struggled with smoking and the lord has totally just slapped those things right up out of my mind thank you lord and i just want to thank everybody that's here that ever spent five minutes sister lori we spent a lot of time sitting in the car talking by ourselves after church and i'll never forget those times that all of you guys had met with me to show me just a little bit of those lights in different areas amen praise god and all those things that i'm now sharing with my own kids and not just my three biological but five that were given to me that are extra special that are for me to help praise too amen so it's good to be back here i'm excited for the new building i'm excited to see what's coming amen you know just uh as soon as you said that we were gonna do testimonies get that feeling like okay you better get up there and say something if you don't know people just want to stay amen for everything that he's done here amen praise the lord there is a little bit of a common thread about even though you don't see the results that you want to see at the beginning you believe in them because we're not done until the rapture's open a lot of things can happen between now and then rapture may take place tomorrow but it may not for i don't know many more years you know we don't know but we just got to keep believing keep helping my my thinking has always been help as many people as you can in every way you can and just keep being christ everybody stay as far away as you can from any kind of partiality of course you are the queen just gonna say this from a little bit different perspective but i wasn't looking for a church obviously i was content where we were and the lord spoke to us both the same night we were in honduras and he told you that you were going to be starting a church here and he showed me in a vision it's the only vision i've ever had praise the lord but he showed me and we talked about it the next day and it was like a brand new world you know to come back here and planning this and we've gotten we got the building and started it was in february and you know we decided we were going to start having services in may and i learned all about a hard rugged life and i really learned what it meant to serve there were days i went to the airport twice you know taking missionaries picking up new missionaries whatever but that first service we had 17 people in addition to our family and it was just the beginning of planting seeds here in this area and i think that maybe it's been hard it's been super hard on my kids my family and i just have to agree with ann i've sat under other ministries and i know that i can make a rapture that's right and the lord has has done wonderful things here this building is kind of bittersweet amen praise god for all this stuff amen praise the lord okay that was very healthy so we started this church two weeks after we started i got pneumonia for the first time i've had it six times now in the last 20 years my health is a mess terrible i have so many problems i've been through so much stuff but i believe that you know the lord is he's given me strength somehow amen amen thank you lord amen praise the lord you know it's like that means that i can only just pray for strength i have too many problems i can't even pray for all the problems that i have but praise god for all that he's done to help me amen amen thank you hallelujah praise the lord i know if i had a dollar for every time cheryl saw me study and she said that's enough you preach too long right now [Music] she said last night i'm so grateful for her because she's keeps me where i need to be [Music] amen isn't this a coincidence oh um i wasn't i wasn't i wasn't before many churches in my life i can't say that i've ever been to a church other than this one where i felt like a family had some bad experiences as a kid i've always believed in god well i'm being honest i felt like you know i'm just stuck in some in the light that it wasn't fair but now in my elder years i see that life isn't fair it's a struggle wasn't until i came here that i actually started to awaken i guess um i feel blessed i had this opportunity to be with you all um um i guess growing up i've always been the way in the not world by choice but by deception he has a way of grabbing a hold of people yeah and unless they run into a pastor like brother john or some kind of mentor it helps them to release the bondage yes amen anyway bless him jesus big inspiration amen praise god for the martyrdom brother roger well there's many here ryan i usually don't hear me say too much about anything i don't know if it's natural but i intend to be a little mysterious and then called vague and there's a lot going inside of my heart [Music] sister anne just recently helped me uh i've been grateful for helping at the church amen all the things that god has blessed me with our talents i've been able to share amen i'm really not looking for recognition for that what i am the blessings i'll be seeing you all amen [Music] to the new building without me having brother graham on it pretty pretty true i uh got caught up listening to the ways of the world and yeah angry about what's going on all right as i listen to brother branham i've listened to many messages in the last probably uh six months and uh starting to feel a joy in my heart amen if you just seek jesus yeah nothing else really matters amen that's right that's right amen i really don't want to take too much in time but i was baptized in this room i had been like sister joyce been baptized before two or three times [Music] didn't really mean much to me then i you know it was just what everybody did and like i said there's a lot of churches there's very few that truly are seeking you and your brother amen amen amen amen [Music] testimony from the heart amen it's just beautiful amen god's sure sister god taking our hearts and just squeezing them so love can come out and be expressed back to god amen um so i want to make this as as brief as i can summarize some of the things but i will just say that the service that you had ministered today really matches the testimony that i have for the church here as well so gabe some of you knew gabe um my children's father um and some of you didn't get an opportunity he passed away in 2005 but before we had moved out to the benton area i had been struggling in the world myself and in this very disturbed type of home life and i was at the time an at-home mom and and i had just been battling a lot of things and one night we went to bed and i had this dream that was so surreal the lord came to me in a dream and showed me in this dream that i was gonna go in this rapture and when i woke up i had no idea where i was it took me like five minutes to realize i was at home in my own bed and i started falling because i wasn't with god i thought i was going in the rapture when i was sleeping it was just that real i was there and so um it was maybe a few months later where we were living that um gabe had found us a place to live out on heartland road which just so happens to be about seven houses or so from john and cheryl and gabe lived or he worked for his father um which is the the lawn and snow business um and he had a lawn account at trusted tool and gabe used to come home and tell me that guy over there is talking to me about jesus [Music] talking to me about jesus so one night he comes home and he says well i talked to that guy again he said sometime him and another friend of his is gonna come to a bible study and i'm like oh okay no big deal and he's like well you better get ready you'll be here in 30 minutes so i was like feel me because you know he's bringing this me and i don't know and and another man too finished getting my kids ready for bed and okay so i'm like all right by the time they anybody knows me i can be very upset and then go to okay i'm calming down i'm trying to change my attitude whatever so that's how it was by the time they showed up they as in um brother john and uh brother casco who was the first people that i have met um that was my first introduction and um we sat down and had kitchen bible study and as we were i had already been to church who brother ben was talking about um earlier he went to south point tabernacle years ago and that's where i was initially grounded in any type of the word is that self blend tabernacle as well as a young girl and so when brother john and brother pascal were doing their bible study it started making sense and it was like something in me was just stirring with i know the i know these words i just haven't heard them in so long and um and at the same time we just you know uh it just blew up because um gabe uh didn't know the word at all and um so he was getting angry and just putting digs on me and i i left and uh i went and got a pack of cigarettes when got a pack of cigarettes a smoky cigarette on the way home and um by the time i walked in brother john brother casco had already had whatever part of the meeting they were gonna have with him and um and uh we got there for the remainder of the night i think until probably 11 or 11 30 that night uh we we sat there talking around the word and just it was it was at that point when gabe went to bed and i sat there the evening with them that my life started to change amen thank you jesus i was so grateful and so thankful and and brother john continued having some bible studies with me and and uh um talking to me um he takes some time and you know checked on me and see how i was doing and things and i recall um i called him up one day um at trusted tool i called him up and you might not even remember this i think i may have told you this before and you didn't remember so you probably don't still meant so much to me this is where i had an introduction to the messages i called brother john i said i had the strangest dream about you and another man in my dream last night and there was a storm brewing around me and uh and we came into this building and we sat down you and this man sat down with me and you started showing me this book it was like a real thin book it wasn't a bible but it was a real thin book and in the book it had like scripture words but like somebody else was talking and and it was i can't really understand exactly what it was but the one side it had like some white blue clouds it had clouds on it and you said i brought some books with me to work today i'll stop by and drop them off on my way home so you came to the house and you're standing at the back door there and you're like these are the books that i brought and you you showed me the front and you said is this the book you saw and all i saw on it was the clouds and i said that's the book that's what i saw and i opened the book and it was i saw there was scripture i thought it was like somebody was talking and i'm like this is when i stopped this is what i saw at my dreams amen and i didn't even know then those were message books of brother branches and so um you were asking me at that point who was this other man i said i don't know i've never seen this man before so it wasn't until a couple years after we started in our church here um we went to have like a sister church gathering i think at brother bailey's uh brother bill billy and when we went in there that day he for whatever reason he wasn't actually ministering somebody else was ministering but he was doing some sort of a song or a prayer surprise whatever and after that church service i told you i said brother john that's the man i saw in my dream that with you showing me these books and you said which one the one preaching i said no it was the one leading songs and you said that was my pastor and i had no idea that was the first time i had ever seen him so i just i don't know if that's like um a church order thing i had no idea still but i'm just saying it's just the message today about the lord reaching out and looking for the one lost uh while you have um the 99 here or by your first thought you have one but where are the nines and so it was like the lord was reaching out to me even though he didn't necessarily have um one of our brothers and sisters here to come in and get me but he used he used gate okay and he used that business to get a hold of you and um and those were all different tools the lord is going to accomplish whatever your destiny has already been laid out and you just pray uh that the lord will lead you in every footstep and you know and and we're just humans we make mistakes we fall we just pray that the lord will forgive us and help us to continue walking in that footsteps so that we can continue um you know walking in his will and you know so and pray for each other with that's what's important because we don't know a lot of times people look at somebody else's life and i know it's important that we want to be a reflection of the lord but sometimes you might look at someone and you're not seeing such a good reflection yeah um but there may be something else really brewing up inside here and we don't know what it is so we just need to keep praying for them and just pouring out the love that's right because uh you know i'm just as guilty as the next person right so i just want to encourage everybody to just keep praying for one another and keep pressing forward because god has he's going to use whatever he needs to to get your attention amen whatever he needs to to get your attention and um and bring you closer to him i was thinking on the way to church this morning i was thinking about my memory their sister brought out that so perfectly said that even though i reminded you you still probably forgot i was thinking this morning my way to church how many things i have forgotten and honestly i feel like i've forgotten every every good thing that i've ever done but satan will not let you know let you forget the bad things you need right now [Music] and uh that's his job that's right that's right that's his job amen but we need to press forward amen before we when i get dismissed i want to show you a little five minute of the pictures of the new church real quick and were we saving the best for last [Music] i just want to testify this church has meant so much to me i just remember uh my grandfather's funeral i just remember seeing him brother john just to cheryl there that's like the only thing i really remember is turning around and seeing them i had no idea who they were you know what their names even were and come to find out they'll be such a big part of my life you know my spiritual growth i remember uh youtube and ann would always constantly you know i was in the world just constantly you know try to reach out to me take me to dinner and you know a lot of times i'll brush it off but when i look back at it the lord was using you guys and all of you guys too in this church i know you guys were praying for me and i honor those prayers that's why i'm even here i today you know going here since 2004 and when i turned 18 i don't know nothing to a church i just want to do my own thing i remember what i did that was like one of the worst years of my life and i always believed in god and always knew you know that guy you know had a plan for me but i just didn't want to submit to it and uh definitely thank kelly so much that guy put her in my life i don't know definitely sent her a mama uh she's done so much broke her back to you know provide for me on so many things in so many areas and i'm i'm turning grateful for my grandma as well she's been rocking my life as well and i'm still thinking towards the church you know these last four years i gave march to the lord at 17. these last four years have been the best four years of my life amen i remember before giving my heart to the lord each time i come here i would just like a question to pop my mind how can you not hear anymore you know this feels the spirit in here was just so sweet and so welcoming and so warming and every time i would come here i'm like man why am i staying away from here and even sometimes i was in the world like do a long trip off listen to her brother brains for the random tape here and there because i just knew this was the truth you know i was just running away from it these last four years have been the best four years of my life this ministry has challenged me uh to become closer in christ to manifest christ brother john is such a special pastor a minister you know to us he's not just some old minister he truly cares about my heart you know he's he wants what the lord wants you know he moves up all the way he studies many hours like brother marty says and he sacrificed him his wife and his daughters have sacrificed so much just for us and for the word and he could probably do so many things his wife had done so many things his daughter but they'd rather be servants for god you know it's like you know they care about the season of sin that's what the lord wants and i can say i'm truly grateful for each and every one of you this church i wouldn't be here today uh if god didn't honor your prayers and this church is very surreal to think that this is our last service you know i never would have thought about it and uh i can't wait for the the new growth that's going to happen in our new church i believe all my heart that the lord is through the fruit of our ministry is gonna have souls new souls there who have been met with more musicians assistant pastor guitar players i believe a backup piano player sister cheryl would love to worship i remember the only time i've ever seen a worship was when the fontaine's came and i've never seen worship because she's playing the piano all the time so i'm just leaving all my art that she's going to be able to take a break and just sit down i'm thankful for the martin family i'm indebted to you guys is that a two bucks for me hey man i thank you for that mother mark has been such a blessing to me personally because of his genuine desire it's always expressed that he wants to help amen it's just non-stop wanting to help and uh i do believe god put him in the church to help and i believe god is going to use him in great ways i believe that for sure give i give god thanks for free amen amen oh one more i just wanted to say this just something simple here the golf outings that we did the farmers markets you know all the people we witnessed to over the years we think well nobody came but that isn't the truth because many people that we had invited the gulf outing and whatever they're still talking about so all those years we did those things those are seeds cast your bread upon the water and said the light has certainly done that and i see a number of sunday school kids sitting here that have been prayed for for years amen elizabeth started the sunday school here she started a wonderful work here with um and she had brother mark and sister ann when they were small i inherited them a little bit when they got a little bit older but you know i can't even express to you the importance of your children being in church being brought up in the lord how that has made a difference in their lives amen and the sunday school is really it's a place where the kids need to be because it's an extension of the ministry here that's right and um i did it for many years i didn't want to do it at first i just got the mantle handed to me but it grew and the lord blessed it and then master tricia has taken that over and it's just your kids train up the children the way they should go when they get pulled to depart from that i don't care that they're not here yet that's right they're going to come together the prayers of the righteous we'll bring those kids back and um cheyenne has been in sunday school many times and you know the lord he has his ways of doing things and dealing with kids like his sister was saying about sterling you know and i do pray for him i pray for all the sunday school kids i can't forget them you know praise the lord maybe we're the only ones praying for them in the world and maybe we're the only ones gathering santa too and one husband had to have these older kids and it was just a blessing to do that and became an extension of the ministry and that was the vision that brother john has always said without a vision people perish with their vision the children will perish and we can see that happening in the world right now if that doesn't bring you in closer i don't know what's going on in this church if everybody that came he was here we'd have a great big mega church wow but you know not everybody can take the truth that's it they don't they can't can't sit under it but i'm thankful to go out there amen you've been able to sit under it and you've never spoken anything with the truth here yeah remember the bible ministry that's come through here unbelievable i don't know when another church has had an eiffel ministry like this and she goes to lots of different message churches but when i talk to people they're like what i'm like yeah puts his money where his mouth is i'm grateful for that we have our first missionary coming in november amen yeah it's been a while since you know since this culver thing had happened so we're looking forward to that we do have some um brothers lined up already next year and uh some that we've never had before and so we're we're excited about our future as well we need a five-fold ministry amen amen amen if all the hearts are oh brother jonathan i don't necessarily have a testimony that i want to thank the church for um you know at all you know pouring into my wife and her mom trina amen sisters but um you know i heard a little everybody speaking and you know just because some of those people aren't here doesn't mean they're not in another house doesn't mean they're not praying at night that's right you know doesn't mean that that god's numbers of the body of christ haven't grown that's right um i just felt like the holy spirit was you know stirring that in my heart that just because that you're not seeing maybe some of them you know but the ones you don't know and the golf outings and things just because you don't see those people in this house doesn't mean they're not in another state or another city serving the lord you know so i just wanted to say that that's very encouraging amen amen well if all hearts are feeling good um we wanted to show you something and it's it's a the new church and uh i want to thank ann uh for the putting this thing together for us yesterday and she's uh very shy to learn the program she's just so grateful for her amen now in building this church it's kind of been a building project hasn't it i mean it wasn't like starting from scratch but it kind of would have been easier in certain aspects um my dad's brother stand to work on an area just do this and he'd have to fix all the flaws that were there from before and that was you know would just add time and yeah sure but when we we had a number of employees if i could say like that people from our our shop we had certain brothers here that we've helped us and we've we believe a worker is worthy of his height and when we chose brother stan we knew one thing that he would he would be the person that would not try to get by that's right amen he he'll stand testify he's he's not the most speediest guy and he's human so he can get wore out but it has been such a joy to work with him knowing he he would just do anything you'd ask him to do he wouldn't he wouldn't do that wrestle it nothing and uh it just makes you want to well brother stan what do you want to do what do you want to do listen how many times they say you make the choice but we appreciate uh brother stan amen and and i i have to call out there was a brother brother came for uh a couple hours and i don't know if it was a sunday or what it was he helped remove the toilet amen i don't know that i probably won't be up there because we don't have pictures brother mike came a couple times and uh labored sister amanda had did countless of hours without money amen countless of hours without money [Music] and i want to make note of that because it's not up here you understand i appreciate uh what a love for the kingdom of god amen and may god bless her and bless each and every one of you amen amen thank you for your prayers thank you i i mean there were times that you said hey what can i do to help you [Music] but when i do ask for help like i'm asking for help today after service and uh there'll be times that i will ask for help and that's your time to rise to vacation and say yes what can i do so the first picture i want to show you is very special and these i want to give to my wife [Music] because she was the one that had sacrificed she's not patting me right because it was uh i had to be away from her she had to be away from me right and so thank you [Music] all right [Music] i also want to thank the lord for my son amen who ran trusted to for the most part amen because that is it's a job and a half and he's he did well amen and i want to give thanks to the lord for him there were so many times he said dad can i come over can i help and i would say son you're doing the greatest thing that you could do for me right now take care of trusted tools which allowed me to to step away and to work at the church so i want to thank the lord he was a vital part of the building of the new church all right we're ready to start it right now right all right praise the lord i haven't seen this yet amen this is the beginning of the plant when we started before we started oh man that's brother stan saying all night sure this is the way you got to do it john um [Music] um [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] wow wow [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] some creatures keep preaching and singers go sing and lay men keep sharing that jesus is king the angel together they're surrounding the throne and they'll start rejoicing for just one more soul all that just one more soul is [Music] down is is just one more song praise the lord amen try to try to bring somebody on the tent week that's a week from this sunday to come and just celebrate with us and uh of course our next service for the home church is this when this wednesday and uh those of you that can make it please come and i think it'll just be a real special time amen looking forward to it amen let's just praise the lord praise you jesus praise you lord thank you lord jesus i want to say thank you to mr halley i was not here when i thank the lord for him amen he's been a very good man to us and i pray the lord blesses him because he was good to the bride amen never raised our rent in 20 years praise the lord may the lord bless him for that amen well let's stand together be dismissed this this may be our last service may have been our longest service but it was a wonderful service wonderful testimonies and may may god continue to bless you give you the desire of your heart make the rapture and be together forever it'll be worth it all won't it amen amen goodness our our brother marty if you would close in a word of prayer thank you dear lord for all you have done
