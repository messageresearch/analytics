TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this for a couple months, but that's just the way it is. This is a a brutal recovery. It's literally easier just to go ahead and get a knee replacement or shoulder replacement. This one is is um you just they got attach it and you got to just let it heal and you can't do a whole lot. But thankful for doctors that know what they're doing, &gt;&gt; got experience, and you just follow the protocol and &gt;&gt; and pretty much we'll we'll be getting back like brother Stan. We'll be able to work side by side with him and God bless you for coming out on this day. Um I believe we're going to be blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe the Lord has something special for us. Um this is the only day that he had available. We tried to encourage to come on Sundays, but um sometimes uh they're not available, so we're taking what we can get. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Uh Hummy's been praying for the service. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Well, let's just sing uh only believe. We certainly appreciate our our music. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um where would we be? Where would we be right without it? And it just helps us to enter in and worship the Lord. Let's just sing only believe as brother uh Josh Martin comes to give us the word of life today. Amen. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe, Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. All things I believe, Lord. I believe all things are possible. Lord, I believe. Can we sing? Jesus is here. Jesus is here. Jesus is here. All things are possible. Jesus is here. Jesus is here. Jesus is here. All things are possible. Jesus is here. Amen. You believe that this evening that he's here in our midst. And what's incredible about the presence of of Christ is when he's here, you don't have to leave the same way. you know, uh, Brother Brandon would tell the story of the little girl that would want to see the king, you know, the king of, uh, I believe of Canada was was coming through and she would have her flag and would be waving the flag and and as they were getting the the class together to leave, uh, the the teacher couldn't find this little girl. So, she she would look for her and would find her and she was in a corner crying and she would look at him and would say, "What's what's the matter? Did you not see the king?" "Yep, I seen the king." Well, did you not wave your flag? Yes, I waved the flag, but but but what's the matter? Why are you crying? She would say, "Well, I seen the king and I waved my flag, but I was too little. The king didn't see me." And brother Brandon would say, "That's not the way it is with King Jesus. No matter how little we are or what little we do, he sees it all." And and that's always encouraging. You know, you you might feel like you're the least in the kingdom of God, but he sees it. He sees every little thing you do. He He sees you as you're raising your children, as you're providing for your families, as you're going to work. He sees you. Nothing goes goes unnoticed whenever you're serving the Lord. Amen. Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this evening? Amen. Well, if you would have your Bibles, let's open our scriptures to Hebrews 11:8. It's such an honor to be with you'all here tonight. I I pray something can be said to be a blessing and to to strengthen your faith in some way. I just have a simple thought uh tonight, but I pray you can it can be a blessing to you. Um I bring greetings from our my pastor, brother Wendell Martin, and the saints there in New Life Outreach and Pony, Oklahoma. They send their greetings and it's just so good to be with you here tonight. And I appreciate the opportunity to be ministering. Amen. I I just just love the Lord here tonight. You love the Lord tonight. Amen. In Hebrews 11:8, a familiar passage of scripture. But by faith Abraham, when he was called to go out unto a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed. And he went out, not knowing whether he went. By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac, Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise. For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. Amen. Can we bow our heads this evening? Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, how how humbled we are to come into your house one more time. Father, we ask Lord that you would just feel welcome here among us. Lord, you know the needs that are in the lives of your people, Father. Lord, we're a needy people and we're nothing without you, Father. And Lord, we're needing you here tonight to come and Lord, break the breads of life to us. Father, we ask that you would take this simple thought, Lord. May you anoint it to our hearts, Father. May there be a heart to receive what you would have for us here tonight, Lord. God, we commit ourselves and this service into your hands in Jesus' name. Amen. You may be seated here this evening. I just have a simple thought. It would be resting in the promise. And and Abraham is always it's a story that brother Brandham he would preach on a lot. He he would preach many messages on the life of Abraham and he would preach Jehovah Gyra a couple series on that on on that thought and he would say here in Jehovah Gyra. Do you love the journey with Abraham? I just love to watch it. He says because why? Everything that he did was a perfect type of the church. A and and I've always heard the the story of Abraham and the the journey that Abraham would would go through. But whenever I would come across that quote and would hear brother Brandham say that, it gave me a different perspective of Abraham that he's a type of me. Everything that he would go through is exactly what he's doing for the church. And you can look at Genesis 12:1. Now the Lord had said unto Abram, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, into a land that I will show thee." And it's it's incredible to think about the amount of faith that Abraham would had to have had to leave his kindred, to leave his father's house, maybe uh he might have had a good job or or a nice place to live. and and and he would hear the voice of the Lord, you know, get get away from your family and go to a place I'm going to show you. And if you would look at it through a human eyes, you would you could almost argue, why not why don't you show me now where we're going? You know, show me where you want me to go. But that wasn't the way God was working. He says, Separate yourself, and I'm going to show you. I I might not show you now. You you can look at the the the confidence that that Abraham would would have to have in the voice of God to leave everything behind. And it's the same thing today. It's confidence in the word of the Lord. And in the book of Revelations would say, I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come out of her, my people, and be separated. Be be not partakers of her sins and and of her plagues." But the difference between us and Abraham is we do have a direction. We know what we're striving for. We We know the place that that we are sojouring to. And I believe that a rapture is what every one of us is striving for. I believe you're striving for that tonight. A body change, a marriage supper of the lamb, a honeymoon in the millennium. And and all of these things have been promised for us to obtain. Unlike Abraham, all Abraham had was I'm going to show you a place, but start walking. And so we can look how that that it was a Abraham would have to rest and trust in what the word of the Lord was telling him to do. And that is a hard thing to do sometimes is trust. And we're living in a day where where where anxieties and and fears is is on the rampage and and fear of the unknown is a genuine thing. And and all of us can probably testify of it when you don't know what what the next minute is going to hold. And brother Brown, he he would tell us that m man likes to be in control. He would say that it's human nature. He would say to prove the point, he would say, "Get in a car with somebody. You're in the passenger seat." He says, "You're going to tell them turn here, turn there." He says, "You'll be stomping on the floor trying to pump the brakes." Even though there's no brakes there, you you like to be in control, you know. And so fear of the unknown is a genuine thing because you like to be in control. And whenever it's out of your ability or out of your control to to maybe change circumstances or or make something happen, that's when fear comes and creeps into the heart where you don't know if something can happen. And all God is saying is trust me. Just rest in what I promise you can do. You can't do it in your own ability, but rest in what I can do. And and so panic attacks comes from not knowing what what what is going to happen. And and and I I remember one time I I I was staying in in Virginia. I think I was 13 or 14. And and I was staying at my uncle Sean's place there in Virginia. He's a pastor up there. And I was up there for for a couple months. And and uh uh it was time for me to fly back home. And so we get to the airport, you know, Uncle Sean, he's with me. I'm a I'm a minor, so I have to be accompanied by an adult, you know. So I get he gets to the security with me. And we're sitting there waiting for me to board the plane. and it gets announced over the intercom that that there was engine failure and and the plane has been delayed. Our flight's been delayed for for a few more hours, but Uncle Shawn, he was heading on a trip that that same day. And so he dropped me off with the one of his deacons to come and and take me to the airport, you know, and so I was already a little nervous because of the engine failures. My first time flying by myself. And so so we get through the security again, me and brother Sam, you know, we're sitting there and and he leaves. He's He's never flown before himself. So, he leaves and and I'm nervous, you know. I'm like, man, okay, I just just stay calm. And and then I'm waiting there and and and the intercom says again, hey, the the the flight is going to be delayed. We're experiencing engine failure. I said, again, you know, and so here here the nervousness is working up here. The the anxiety is starting to to build up because I don't know what's going to happen. I've never done this before. my adult has left, you know, and then they say, "Okay, we're ready to go." Everybody get, you know, get in line. And so I get in line. I've got my ticket. A and the the the the host there says, "Wait, I have to accompany you onto the plane. You know, you can't be by yourself." Which is encouraging. You know, as a minor, you you you're never alone. But she says, "You just just go sit down over here. When everybody gets on the plane, I'll come and get you and I'll escort you to your seat." I said, "Great." you know, so I I'm sitting there waiting and I'm watching everybody get on the plane. You know, everybody gets on, the last person gets on the plane and the lady gets on the plane herself. Now, I'm sitting there like, "Hey, I'm supposed to be with her." And you know what would happen? I had a panic attack. And and here I started to get dizzy. I started to, you know, things started to get a little fuzzy. And while I WAS SITTING THERE, I was almost about to pass out. Excuse me. I was panicking that bad. But then all of a sudden there would come the the stewardist would come back and say, "Hey, you ready to get back? Get on the plane." And right there everything would clear up. And I thought that's a lot like what's happening today. We're living in a day where the greatest battle ever fought is right in the mind. And it's easy to have panic attacks of of not spiritual panic attacks where I'm not good enough where where I can't make a rapture. My children aren't going to be saved. This here can't happen. That can't happen. And and as the nervousness starts to grip around the heart, then the word can comfort and say, "Hey, you're more than conquerors through Christ Jesus who strengthens you." And it's incredible the comfort of the word of the Lord that that in the right season, there can be a verse or a message, a preacher can come and and preach something across the pullpit. And while you're sitting there having a hard time, there can come a word of comfort that can strengthen and encourage. The Bible would tell us that that the Lord himself shall descend with a shout, with a voice, with a with the trump, and the dead in Christ shall rise first, right? And we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the sk in the clouds and and forever be with our Lord. And what would the next verse say? Wherefore comfort one another with these words. In other words, whenever you're lonely, comfort yourself. Whenever you're discouraged, comfort yourself. Whenever you lose a a loved one, comfort yourself. There's a word that that IN THE RIGHT SEASON CAN COMFORT you where you can rest. And I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT GOD HAS CALLED us to do in this generation is rest. Because we can't do it. We can't make a rapture in our own ability, but it's all what God has done for us. And brother Brandham said, "Everything a Christian has, it's his faith resting in the finished work of Calvary." Everything was finished and completed. We rest our faith in the finished work. Ain't that incredible? Brother Brandon would tell us in one place if Christ was here in this suit and tie, he says he couldn't heal you. The reason why is he already done it. And so we're not looking for for Christ to do something for us. We're just resting in what God has already done. But brother Brandham, he would tell us that this is the most deceitful age that there's ever been. And and it's incredible to think about because you can't take nobody's word anymore. You you you don't know what's AI or what's real anymore. You you you you and it's easy to get the mentality of nothing's true. And and it's only me and only my loved ones and I can only believe their word. And and I believe that is a design of the devil where it's hard to place confidence in the word of the Lord where where we become skeptical. Are we sure that's true? Are we sure that the word has power to save and power to deliver and power to to change our bodies? And and it's easy to get that mindset of it's it sounds good, but is it really true? But let me say this THAT DON'T JUST SOUND GOOD, but it is good. I believe every word in in this message is is has a a transforming POWER TO CHANGE lives and and to change DESIRES AND AND TO SAVE loved ones AND AND TO FILL with the Holy GHOST AND AND ONE DAY IT'S GOING TO CHANGE OUR BODIES. IT AIN'T SOMETHING THAT IS TOO good to be true. It is SOMETHING THAT IS TRUE that we can REST HIM AND PLACE OUR CONFIDENCE ON INSIDE OF HIM AND KNOW BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT GOD HAS EVERYTHING under control. Oh my. We might not know what tomorrow holds, but we know who holds tomorrow. And it's encouraging to know that when we feel like we're by yourself, he'll never leave us. He'll never forsake us, but he will be with us till the until we step into a body change. And it's incredible. Brother Brandon would tell the story about how that he would lose his daughter and his wife would pass away and a and one of his critics would come up to him and would say, you know, what do you think of God now? You lost your daughter. You you you lost your wife. And brother Brandham would say, I think of him the same. He is faithful. And the man would say, oh, you you kept your religion, huh? Brother Brandham says, oh no, my religion kept me. It's something we can rest in and place our heart and place our children in, place our marriage in, place our place our church in, place the uh prodal children in. It's something we can rest IN KNOWING THAT GOD HAS THE ABILITY and the power to save. And brother Brandon would say, let's begin with Abraham and find out what Abraham was and how that we become his seed. And then if we really get thoroughly based upon the word of the Lord, then it takes all of the fear away from us if we know what we're doing. And and that that's why I'm so thankful for the message of the hour. It's taken away all of the fear because it's thoroughly based upon thus saith the Lord. And then we can walk knowing that it's not blind leading the blind, but it's thus saith the Lord that we are following. And you can look at you can look at Abraham in Romans 4:20. He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully persuaded that what he had promised, he was able also to perform. And and and what I love about that scripture is the reason why he staggered not at the promises of God was because he was persuaded. And and that is a hard thing to do in the most deceitful age is be persuaded of something because every TIME YOU YOU START TO be persuaded of something, you find the hidden flaw behind it or or you find a a hidden motive behind it. And and I I I have been looking for a for a vehicle for the past 6 months. And and if y'all have ever shoed for a vehicle, you can probably feel my pain. Every time you think you find a good deal, all of a sudden you drive it, something's wrong with it. And you know, my banker, every time I I would find something that was a good deal, he would say, "Now, Josh," he's like, "I don't mean to be this way, but that's a scam." He's like, "That's too cheap. There's got to be something wrong with it." And so, we're living in the most deceitful age, but yet we have to be persuaded. AND IT'S HARD to be persuaded. And the way you become persuaded of something is to see that is genuine. You remember brother Brandham, he would sell the lamps, right? and and he would go up to the houses and would say, "Hey, if you like the lamp, you you can keep it for a week. If you like it, I'll come back next week. You can buy it or you can give it back to me." And he says, "I was I was the number one salesman for that company because he wasn't trying to sell it to him. The product was selling itself." And and that's how you become persuaded. It's not YOU TRYING TO SELL IT, but this message is showing itself. THIS MESSAGE HAD A PILLAR OF FIRE BEHIND IT. AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD BACKING IT UP TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THAT'S HOW I AM persuaded that this message is thus sayaith the Lord is because God himself has backed it up and it's a scriptural message and I'm persuaded and so I'm staggering not at it. Even though we're in the most deceitful age, I am not staggering at it. Oh, hallelujah. And as we as we're looking at Abraham, the Bible would tell us that he was under an unconditional covenant. And brother Brandham would tell us that that there was three covenants through the Old Testament. There was the first covenant with Adam and Eve, right? And then they would break the covenant. And then there was another covenant with God and Noah, and then Noah would Noah would break the covenant. And it was always a covenant between God and man. But then Abraham's covenant, it was between God and himself. HE COULD SWEAR BY NOBODY GREATER. SO HE WOULD SWEAR BY HIMSELF. AND AND I BELIEVE that's the reason why Abraham would stagger not at the promise of God because he knew if I fall and make a mistake, the covenant STILL STANDS. HALLELUJAH. If it's 20 years and and it don't look like I can do it, the covenant still stands. IT'S NOT ON MY ABILITY to produce it. It's on his ability to keep his word. AND AND WE'RE UNDER THAT SAME COVENANT. Brother Brandham would teach us to them that we are the royal seat, the spiritual seat of Abraham. And we're under an unconditional covenant. So, you know what that means? It's not what you can do. IT'S WHAT GOD HAD ALREADY DONE. AND WE'RE just resting in the word of the Lord in this generation and and relying on him to do the rest. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US THAT that's the basis of our faith is that this covenant is an everlasting covenant because it's unconditional. It's an everlasting covenant. A and it's in it's incredible to to think about how brother Brandham he would he would ask the question, are we sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst? In other words, are we persuaded? And brother Brandon would would would talk about El Shadi and and he he would teach us that that El Shadi was the breasted God. He was the strength giver. And he and it was El Shadi that Abraham would meet and brother Brandon would tell us that he would nurse from El Shadi a body change. And and when and he's our type. And so as we as we pour strength from the word, HE'S EL SHADI to us. But brother Brandon would also tell us that a mother don't just give the baby strength, but it also satisfies. So he's not just the strength giver, but he's the satisfier. And I thought, oh my, that's another way we're persuaded. We draw strength from him and then we're satisfied. That's why Jesus would say, "My sheep will hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow because my sheep IS GOING TO BE SATISFIED WITH THE STRENGTH that they're BRINGING FROM ME." HALLELUJAH. AND THAT'S HOW THE BRIDE IS PERSUADED AND STAGGERING NOT AT THE WORD of the Lord is because he he or she is drawing strength and IS SATISFIED FROM the word of Almighty God. You see, so many times we we get one or the other where we're we're drawing strength from the word, but we're not sufficiently impressed or we might be sufficiently impressed, but we fail to draw strength from the word. And I say this evening, maybe you're maybe you're a little discouraged, maybe you're in a trial, but the brand Matelis, you're either coming into a trial, going through a trial, or you're about to go into one, right? He says you either let me rephrase that. YOU'RE EITHER COMING OUT OF A TRIAL, in the middle of a trial, or about to come into a trial. So the every one of us is going to go through hard times, but just rest ASSURED THAT OUR SHADYI IS still a strengthgiver. Hallelujah. And it's incredible because the Bible would tell us that that the Lord would, the almighty God, which is a Shadi, would appear to Abraham and would say, "Walk with me. Walk before me." AND SO IT WASN'T Abraham looking for El Shadi. It was El Shadi looking for Abraham and saying come walk WITH ME. AND COULD YOU IMAGINE ABRAHAM thinking I'm old. I don't got the strength. AND THEN GOD COULD SAY I'M THE STRENGTH GIVER. THAT'S THE REASON I'M SAYING WALK WITH ME BECAUSE I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE STRENGTH. AND MANY TIMES WE FEEL LIKE WE DON'T GOT the strength to get up and walk with the Lord. But he is still our shady guy. HE IS STILL THE STRENGTH GIVER WHEN WE'RE WEAK IN OUR JOURNEY. when we're maybe perplexed and maybe discouraged, WE CAN COME ON a midweek service and as the word comes across, it is a WORD IN THE RIGHT SEASON THAT IT CAN STRENGTHEN AND ENCOURAGE THAT YOU CAN GET GET A HOLD OF OUR SHY EYE AND DRAW SOME STRENGTH for for your life. You believe that this morning that he is still our shy eye and it's incredible because brother Brandham would say then you say in divine healing, brother Brandham, will God heal me? He says your Abraham's seed, he has ALREADY HEALED YOU. HALLELUJAH. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE resting upon is El Shadi. He's already done it. And so we're just resting in him. A and the reason why I believe this is the most deceitful age is because the devil wants to destroy the influence of this message. Brother Brandham, he he would he would tell us that that if we can that the the reason why that the that the the scribes and the Pharisees were after Jesus was because they were trying to destroy his influence before the people. And he br say they were jealous. And so they were trying to destroy the influence before the people. And he says so is it today. He says if they can destroy the influence of the message before the people, he says they got this whole thing whipped. And I thought, oh my, that's why it's the most deceitful age. And and I hope this is okay, brother John. That that's the reason why there's so many voices on YouTube with with trying to discourage the authority of the word and websites and and so-called preachers that are saying, "He missed it here. He done this wrong. He done that wrong." It's they're trying to destroy the influence of this message to your life where it's whooped in your life. YOU KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE? I THINK IT'S TIME that that we get off of the YouTube and listen to the tapes for oursel. Is that okay? Instead of trying to figure out what somebody else says, WHAT ABOUT WHAT GOD SAID? INSTEAD OF GETTING ON A WEBSITE AND SAY SEEING WHAT THIS PODCAST SAID OR OR WHAT THIS TEACHER SAYS, WHAT ABOUT WHAT GOD SAID THROUGH A MESSENGER IN THIS GENERATION? THAT'S WHAT GOD WILL BACK UP. GOD AIN'T BACKING UP SOME PODCASTER. GOD AIN'T BACKING UP SOME WEBSITE. BUT GOD IS BACKING UP. THUS SAYAITH THE LORD THAT HE HAS GIVEN IN this generation. THAT'S WHY CHRIST WAS SO confident when he says my sheep will know my voice. I KNOW THEM. THEY FOLLOW ME BECAUSE THEY KNOW NOT THE VOICE OF STRANGERS. THERE MIGHT BE STRANGERS THAT IS OUT THERE TRYING to destroy the influence. But I believe God has some sheep here that tonight THAT IS ANCHORED NOT IN SOME PODCAST BUT IS ANCHORED NOT IN A IN YOUR PASTOR BUT IS ANCHORED IN THUS SAYETH THE LORD FOR YOURSELF that when VOICES DO COME YOU'RE already persuaded. HALLELUJAH. WHEN AN influence comes trying to destroy the influence of this word you're already persuaded. You're satisfied. You're impressed with the word that is in our midst. And the reason why he he's trying to destroy the influence is because if you're not walking by faith, you're just pursuing. And brother Brandon, he would preach the message called pursuming, right? He would say it's the venture without authority. So you're walking with the word, but you're not walking with the authority of the word. You remember whenever whenever uh uh uh I believe it was a parent would bring a bring a sick child to Jesus and would say we we took him to your disciples and yet they could not heal him. Jesus would sit there and would cast the devil out of him. And the disciples would ask THE QUESTION, HOW COME WE couldn't do it? And what would Jesus say? Because of the weakness of your faith. You didn't have the faith to do it. And brother Brandham, he would tell us that they had the word. They had the that they had the power to do it, but didn't have the authority to do it. And so, they had the word in their midst, but they didn't have the faith to operate THE WORD. OR IN other words, the influence of it WAS DESTROYED. AND SO, I DON'T believe that God wants a bride that is pursuing. I BELIEVE GOD WANTS A BRIDE THAT is resting in the authority of the word OF THE HOUR. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE JUST ONLY IF YOU'RE only pursuing, THERE'S THERE'S NO CONFIDENCE IN the word of the Lord. And and brother Brandham, he would say, "It is written over in in St. John, I think about the 15th chapter, if you abide in me and my word abide in you." See, the word abides in you. See, then ask what you will and it'll be done. Because it's not you, it's the word that's in you. And the word is God. See, God in you, God is the word. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Now in the return of the Holy Spirit bringing the word in us and it abiding in there, then it's not you that speaks, it's the word itself coming out. So it is the word that will perform the work. SO NOW YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE living in the most deceitful age because you HAVE TO ABIDE IN the word in order for the word to abide in you. So if he can get YOU TO NOT ABIDE in the word, you're you're you're not with your authority because it's the word that speaks out of you. You remember the in the book of Revelations, it was John that was commissioned to go take the book, right? Eat the book and then prophesy again. He couldn't prophesy again unless he ate the book. But once HE ATE THE BOOK, THE WORDS of the BOOK WAS NOW COMING OUT OF HIM. AND I BELIEVE HE WAS OUR TYPE. AND AS WE GET IN THE BOOK, GET IN THIS WORD, THAT BECOMES OUR VOICE, THAT BECOMES OUR TESTIMONY, THAT BECOMES OUR CONFESSION. I BELIEVE IT'S TIME THAT WE GET ALL OF THE NEGATIVE CONFESSION OUT OF OUR MOUTH AND only speak one thing, THAT IS THE WORD OF THE LORD. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH. MY MY MY CONFESSION IS GOING TO BE A POSITIVE CONFESSION. HALLELUJAH. I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND HOW I'M GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS TRIAL, BUT MY CONFESSION IS A POSITIVE WORD-BASED CONFESSION. HALLELUJAH. Because I'm walking with authority and it's the word that is coming out of my mouth. Hallelujah. And you can look on how how whenever that when Jesus was in the wilderness being tempted, what would the devil say to him? If thou be the son of God, he didn't come out and say, "You're not the son of God." He knew better than that. the devil couldn't get him that way, you know, and and I I I remember as a kid I I would have an experience with the Lord and and so I knew that the Lord was real. I I had seen experience I had experiences myself. I had seen things happen uh like my parents prayers being answered. I had seen God for myself. And so the devil couldn't come to me and say God wasn't real. You know that he couldn't get me on there. But what he could do was say God don't love you. Right. And so here the devil comes to Jesus AND HE DIDN'T SAY YOU'RE NOT THE son of God, BUT IF THOU BE the son of God, turn these stones into bread. HE WAS TRYING TO PUT make him pursue if thou be. Then the question mark is on the back of his head. BUT BUT YOU KNOW WHAT JESUS WOULD DO? He would show us how to fight. But the Brandon would say he didn't use his powers, but he got THE WORD AND HE POUNDED HIM OUT OF THE RING WITH HIM. AND WHAT'S incredible is here the devil comes with scripture, you know, if there'll be the son of God, you know, uh, jump from here and and as the Bible as the scripture says, you the angels will will bear thee up lest you dash your foot against the stone, you know. And so here he's quoting scripture, trying to get him TO PURSUE. BUT WHAT WOULD JESUS SAY? IT IS ALSO WRITTEN. YOU SEE, HE HAD A DISCERNMENT TO KNOW THAT THE WORD CANNOT CONDEMN ME. HALLELUJAH. AND I BELIEVE THE WORD DOES NOT CONDEMN A BELIEVER. IT MIGHT CONVICT A BELIEVER, BUT it does not condemn a believer. And the devil comes with scripture many times and tries TO BEAT YOU DOWN WITH SCRIPTURE. YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH. YOU SEND YOUR DAY OF GRACE AWAY. YOU'LL NEVER ACHIEVE ANYTHING. But we need some PEOPLE THAT IS PERSUADING THAT WILL SAY, "BUT IT IS ALSO WRITTEN. MY NAME IS ENGRAVED IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND. I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MY CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE SAVED, BUT ONE THING I KNOW, THIS PROMISES UNTO ME AND TO MY CHILDREN AND MY CHILDREN'S CHILDREN, AND AS MANY AS THE LORD OUR GOD SHALL CALL, IT IS ALSO WRITTEN BECAUSE I AM PERSUADED. HALLELUJAH. AND I'M RESTING IN THE WORD OF THE LORD. NO MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL SAYS. HALLELUJAH. AND NO MATTER WHAT HIS INFLUENCE IS SAYING, NO MATTER WHAT THEIR VOICES SAY, I AM PERSUADED AND I AM SUFFICIENTLY IMPRESSED with the word in my midst. Hallelujah. You see, he couldn't get him to he couldn't he wouldn't get him on. You're not the son of God. But he put a question there. And you know, and while I'm on the the the subject of a question, and I hope this is okay. You know, it's okay to have questions, but you know, you got to go to the right source to figure out the question, to figure out the answer. But the Brandon, he he he would teach us that that that your faith in the word of the Lord is like a chain, right? He says, "And we're hanging over hell with it, right? I believe it's the harvest time, brother, but the Brandon, he he would he would say that." And he says, "Your chain is the strongest at its weakest link." And he would say that something is puzzling you in the scripture. You know what he would say? He says, "Don't allow that to be a weakness." But he says, "Fortify that question." And I thought that's some good advice. And and how do you fortify your question? You know, as a young person, h how do you fortify your question? That that's how you learn. That's how you understand. So questions ain't always doubt. You remember the Bible would talk about how how how that Judas not a Scariot would ask Jesus and would say, "How is it that thou will manifest yourself unto us and not unto the world?" And and and and I and I love that scripture because he had a question, but he clarified himself. I'M JUDAS, NOT A SCARIOT. I might have a question, BUT I'M NOT DOUBTING LIKE JUDAS is doubting. You see? And so that's the difference between you and serpency. You might have a question, but you got discernment on where to FIND THE ANSWER. HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWING THAT QUESTION TO take away the influence of this word. And so, HOW DO YOU FORTIFY that question? Take Judas not a scariot for example. He didn't go to the scribes and say, "Hey, how is it that he's manifesting himself to us and not to you?" HE WOULDN'T HAVE GOT THE RIGHT ANSWER. THEY WOULD HAVE SAID, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN? You know, he he's this and he's that." He didn't go up to the Pharisees and say, "Hey, I got A QUESTION FOR YOU. HOW IS IT THAT HE'S MANIFESTING HIMSELF TO ME and not TO YOU?" BUT WHERE DID HE GO with this question? He went to THE SOURCE. HALLELUJAH. HE WENT TO THE ONE THAT HAD THE ANSWER. AND THAT'S INCREDIBLE to me. As brother Brandham, he would tell us that if there's a Bible question, there's a Bible answer. So, in other words, if you got a question about the about the Godhead, you're not going to go to a Catholic, right, and say, "Hey, what? I got a question for you. Or if you got a question about water baptism, you're not going to go to the Baptist or or go to this one or THAT ONE. YOU'RE FORTIFYING YOUR QUESTION by coming to THE RIGHT SOURCE. HALLELUJAH. AND I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE, BROTHER BRANDON, MATELIS, WE'VE GOT THE ANSWER TO the devil's question. So I believe that WE CAN FORTIFY OURSEL IN THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING, but you're not allowing VOICES TO PUT DOUBT ON that and allow it to be a weakness. Hallelujah. But even though you have a question, you're fortifying your your question in the word of the Lord. And and it's incredible because you know, as I quoted earlier, Brother Brandham would say, it's the greatest battle ever fought and it's right in your mind. and and and what he's trying to do is he's trying to get you to pursue and he and he works in questions where he tries questions where you're where where he he tries to get you to pursue where you know and I and I've experienced it myself as a young person and he even I don't understand everything. I'm sure brother John probably don't even understand everything. But and you know and it's easy where the devil pl plays with the mind and says you don't understand everything. You must not believe it or you don't understand this. You you must not be the bride. You don't understand this. You you must not be this. God must not called you. You must not be for this. And what he's doing is he's trying to discredit the word in your heart. But I say it's time we we use some discernment and say Satan, I don't care what you say, it's a lie and I'm fortifying myself. But and brother Brandon would tell a story of a of a of a preacher I believe. And he would get a telephone pole and he would put it put it out there and the congregation would get together and he would say, "Do you think I can walk across this log and back that says, "Oh yes, the Lord is with you." He walks across it, comes back. He says, "You think I can push this wheelbarrow across it?" They says, "Yes, the Lord is with you." He goes across, comes back, and then he says, "Do you think I can push a person in this wheelbarrow?" They says, "Oh yeah, the Lord is with you." And the man says, "Okay, get in." They says, "Oh, NO." BROTHER BROWN WOULD SAY, "IT'S DIFFERENT when you're included in it yourself." And I thought, "That is so good that we can say amen and amen, amen, and amen." And that's great, but are you included in it yourself? Come on now. You see, you see it ain't you AND THE BRIDE. YOU ARE THE BRIDE. YOU REMEMBER THE BOY THAT never seen a a reflection of himself before. He would go up and he would see a mirror, right? He would wave. The boy would wave, right? There was two boys. He would jump, the boy would jump. AND HE WAS EXCITED. BUT THE CLOSER HE GOT, the two boys became one. And a revelation STRUCK THAT BOY. MAMA, THAT BOY IS ME. HALLELUJAH. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEBODY IS PERSUADED. THE MORE THEY GET INTO THIS MESSAGE, THE MORE THEY REALIZE, I'M WHO THIS MESSAGE IS talking about. And that's WHAT HAPPENS WHENEVER YOUR PASTOR'S PREACHING AND YOU SAY, "AMEN." YOU SAYS, "PREACHER, THAT'S ME." WHEN YOU SAY, "HALLELUJAH, PREACHER, THAT'S I'M WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT." HALLELUJAH. And we're walking with actual authority because we see yourself. We're included in ourself. and and and and and sometimes it's it's it's hard to see yourself the way the word sees us. And that is a hard thing sometimes. And you remember how the the Bible would talk about how how that an angel would come to Gideon and would say, "You're a mighty man of valor." Y'all remember the story? And if you look up that word valor, it means wealthy. And I think it's it's a powerful point there because here the angel says, "You're a mighty man of wealth." And what would Gideon say? I my my my my family's poor and I'm the least in my father's house. Here the angel was letting him know the way God sees him, but he's seeing himself DIFFERENTLY THAN THE WAY GOD sees him. And you see, we need to look at oursel the way God LOOKS AT US. OH, COME ON NOW. CUZ what does complexes do? It makes us unsatisfied with who we are. And we lose confidence where we're not resting in the way GOD SEES US. GOD LOOKS at us and SAYS, "YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL." GOD LOOKS AT YOU AND SAYS, "YOU'RE FEARFULLY and wonderfully made." But yet we're we're we we we we believe the way the devil looks at us. OH, HALLELUJAH. BUT I don't want to believe the way the devil LOOKS AT ME. I WANT TO BELIEVE THE WAY GOD LOOKS AT ME. GOD LOOKS ME AT AS HIS BRIDE. GOD LOOKS AT YOU as as his virtuous, bloodwashed bride for himself, a people for his name's sake. You see? So, we're looking at oursel and our situations through the filter of God's word. You remember whenever whenever uh whenever Elijah would be in the cave and he's running away from Jezebel? Y you remember that? And it's incredible because it was right before this was the Mount Carmel showdown, right? It was right. It was as at the Mount Coral showed him where the pillar of fire would or the uh the fire would come down and and would lick up the sacrifice, lick up the water, lick lick up the wood, and and then the people would go and be killing all of the all of the the prophets of Baal. And and now he's running FROM JEZEBEL BECAUSE JEZEBEL'S MAD AT HIM. AND HE CRIES UNTO THE LORD AND WOULD SAY that and that they they tore down your altars. THEY THEY'VE DESTROYED ALL OF YOUR prophets and now I'm the only one THAT'S LEFT. WHAT WOULD God say to him? He would look AT HIM AND WOULD SAY, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THERE IS STILL 7,000 THAT HAS NOT BOWED THEIR KNEE TO BAIL." IN OTHER WORDS, the way you're looking AT THE SITUATION IS DIFFERENTLY THAN THE WAY I'M LOOKING AT IT. OH, COME ON NOW. AND SOMETIMES we can get in the woe is me attitude and we can't see a way out. ALL WE SEE IS THE PROBLEM. ALL WE SEE IS THE CIRCUMSTANCES. All we see is THE TROUBLES. AND GOD'S LOOKING AT YOU AND SAYING, "YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT IT THE RIGHT WAY." THAT'S THIS IS NOT YOUR END. YOU'RE MORE THAN CONQUERORS THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGTHENS YOU. GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN YOU than he that IS IN THE WORLD. LOOK AT IT THE WAY I'M looking at it. OH, HALLELUJAH. Brother Brandon would tell us that that God is always going to try his sons. And so the reason you're going through a hard time is because God knows you're one of his. Come on now. And he's not sending you through it for your end. He's sending it through. He's sending you through it TO STRENGTHEN WHAT YOU have on the inside. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we have to look at it the way God's looking at it, which is a hard time, a hard thing sometimes, ain't it, to look at it when when all you see is rock bottom. When all you see is THE IS THE BELLY OF THE WELL, you know, but yet but yet there was already a promise way back when Solomon was building a temple, saying, "If there is anyone that is ever in distress, may they look towards this temple." Oh my. AND CALL ON YOUR NAME. MAY YOU GO AND deliver them." And now HERE'S JONAH WITH LYING VANITIES. HE WOULD SAY he would look at the brand and say, "You looked over there was Wells belly. He looked over there was Wells belly. BUT YET GOD ALREADY PROVIDED A WAY OUT OF IT." OH, come on now. Before you was ever IN YOUR SITUATION, GOD ALREADY PROVIDED A WAY OUT OF IT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT JONAH HAD TO DO? He said, "I WILL LOOK TO WHERE MY HELP COMES FROM." HE WOULD TURN HIS FACE TOWARDS THE HOLY TEMPLE AND WOULD CRY UNTO THE LORD. YOU KNOW WHERE THE BRANDHAM SAYS HE didn't know which way the temple was, BUT IT WAS INSPIRATION. HALLELUJAH. AND YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW MANY TIMES HOW YOU'RE GOING TO SURVIVE. BUT LET INSPIRATION STRIKE THE HEART FROM THE WORD OF THE LORD. AND YOU LOOK TOWARDS THE WORD AND SAY, "GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN ME." I'M LOOKING FROM WHERE MY HELP COMETH FROM. MY HELP COMETH FROM THE LORD. IT DON'T COME IT DON'T come from friends. It don't come from from EVEN THE PASTOR. BUT IT COMES FROM THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD THAT HAS PERSUADED MY HEART. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M resting in. Hallelujah. Though the gates of hell comes against me, they are not going to prevail. Hallelujah. Do you believe that this we can be so persuaded that even when we're seeing everything go wrong, we're we're like Jonah. They're lying vanities. And brother, you know, brother Brandham, when he talks about Jonah, he would say, "You think you have a hard time?" He says, "You've got nothing compared to Jonah." He's sitting there in the belly of a whale. Brother Brandham was saying, "How did he survive down there?" He says, "God provided an oxygen mask down there." You know, AND AND IT'S INCREDIBLE TO THINK THAT, you know, that that God had everything under control that it was impossible to survive that. Oh, come on. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. ANY OTHER MAN would have not survived that. But God's elected did. Come on. And now and now ANYBODY ELSE COULD have been going through your situation, WOULD HAVE LOST THEIR MIND, would have given up a long time ago. BUT YOU'RE THE ELECTED OF GOD. AND HE'S PROVIDED a way of escape out of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we're resting in him. We're resting in the word of the Lord. And and brother Brham, he would talk about Ruth and he would say when Ruth was resting, it was a type of the church resting in the promises of God. He says we have we have the earnest now of our salvation. We're not worried whether we're going over there or not. He says we're going. He says that's right. God said so. God promised it and we've got the earnest. Amen. Done been received. He says Christ has accepted us. No way to get away from it now. We were there. And and I like how brother Brandham, he's putting it. He says, "We're not worried whether we're going to get there or not." In other words, we're not worried if we're going to make a rapture. He says, "We're already accepted." And and and I like how brother Brandon would put that Christ has accepted us. And that is something that that the devil fights us so hard is an acceptance. How many has ever fought that? you know, you know, maybe it's somebody that that you look up to or or or a peer or or somebody you admire. And if you don't feel like you're accepted, you're never going to have confidence with that person, right? And when you don't have confidence in that person, what happens? It's complexes that rise up. Oh, that person didn't shake my hand. That person didn't talk to me. They must have something against me. Everybody knows what I'm talking about. It's because you don't feel like you're accepted. And the devil does that many times with God where we don't feel like we're accepted. But the Bible says we're accepted in the beloved. No matter what the feelings are, we are already accepted. And and the and the reason why the devil don't want you to feel accepted is because he wants you to serve God out of fear. And I won't hold you much longer here tonight. I know it's a midweek, but the devil wants wants us to serve God out of fear. And the Bible will even tell us in Proverbs 1:7, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. And so, it's almost, you know, the devil has a right to put fear on us, but that's not the case. Brother Brandham, he would teach us there's a difference between the fear that the devil brings and the fear of the Lord. He says the fear of the Lord means reverence. It means respect. And so if the devil comes and he wants us to worship God out of fear, we're afraid to make a mistake. We're afraid of messing up. We're afraid that that we won't be good enough. We're afraid that we're going to sin our day of grace. So William and I I remember as a kid, and I'm sure some of the brothers might may may understand what I'm talking about. I I remember as a kid, every time mom says, "Hey, dad, want you?" I got scared. Anybody know what I'm talking about? It's not that I was afraid of dad. It was I respected him and I'm like, man, what did I do wrong? You know, I do something wrong. It's not that I was scared of him. There was a reverence there that I didn't want him to be displeased with me. Hallelujah. And that's the way it is with God. We're not afraid of him. We respect him. And since we respect him, we want to make sure we honor his word. We want to make sure he approves of my worship. He approves of my home. He approves of my church. HE APPROVES OF MY LIFESTYLE. APPROVES OF THE WAY I DRESS, PRO APPROVES OF the way of the way I talk. And and let me say this, you Christ has already accepted you. SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO MAKE him approved uh where we get his approval. HE'S ALREADY APPROVED US. HALLELUJAH. And so it does away WITH ALL OF THE FEAR OF TRYING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH WHEN HE made us good enough. Oh, let me just bust your bubble. You'll never be good enough in your OWN ABILITY, BUT HE HAS made us GOOD ENOUGH AND CHRIST HAS ACCEPTED US. SO REST IN WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT you and know that he has already accepted me. Hallelujah. And that does away with all of the fear because you know if he can get you to worship out of fear that takes away your strength. It takes away it takes away your confidence. And the Bible tells us to come before his throne with boldness. you know that that's the way we come before God is it's not an arrogancy but it's a boldness that you promised it to me and I believe you can give it to me but you see many times it's it's we become nervous with the word of the Lord and and and brother Brandon would be in a prayer line one time and he he he would say that he would say just pray now he said it's not my faith it's your faith and he's just talking with the people and he would stop and he would say you know, uh, if he doesn't speak in a world where we're here in vain and and he says, "If I can just get somebody that has faith and and he's talking to the people." And he stops and he says, "Don't be nervous now." He says, "Don't be nervous." He says, "Just relax." And he says, "You'll never get anywhere with being nervous." And he and he's going and he's talking and he stops and he says it again, "Don't be nervous." He says, "Just reverently before God present your needs." And so he's talking and we know that nervousness is a form of fear. Right? So he's he's telling the people, don't be afraid, but be reverent. In other words, don't have the fear of the devil. Have the fear of the Lord. And he's sitting there and he's talking with them. And then he stops and he says, "Here it is. Thank you, Lord." And he says, "I take every spirit under my control for the glory of almighty God." And he stops and he says and he says now the angel of the Lord that's in that picture he said he's moving through the audience right now. What was it? He had to condition the people to NOT BE AFRAID OF the Lord and be nervous of the supernatural but to just respect it and reverently enter into the worship of the Lord. And and I love bits and pieces of things like that cuz he's showing us how to fight cuz you never get anywhere being afraid of the supernatural cuz many times it's easy to become afraid of the supernatural, right? Where you what am I going to do? What's going to happen if I come under the anointing of the Holy Ghost? How am I going to act? HOW HOW AM I going to talk? What's everybody going to think of me? And you become afraid of it instead of respecting it and just honoring what God can do through me. You remember whenever the the Bible would talk about how that uh uh the disciples were on the boat and there was a storm that was blowing it back and forth. Y'all remember the story? And the Bible would tell us that Christ was walking upon the water and they thought he was a spirit, right? And the Bible says that that they became afraid. And and it's incredible cuz brother Brandham he he would tell that story and would say that that the very thing the very one that could save them they was afraid of and I thought oh my many times it's the same way today the only thing that can fix our problems we're afraid of the only thing that can save our children we're afraid of or the only thing that CAN GIVE REVIVAL IN THE church is is that we're afraid of it and it's incredible because it would be Peter And and I just love Peter, you know, because Peter was the one that would cut cut a man's ear off. He was a he was a he was ambitious. He was the one that that would deny Christ, you know, and he he would be Peter. He would say, "Lord, if it is you, bid me to come." And I thought that that that that's the way I want to be. Peter knew it was impossible to walk on the water. It was impossible. But if he bids me to come, it's possible. Hallelujah. And I think, man, that's the way I want to be. It's impossible to make a rapture, but if he says I CAN DO IT, I CAN do it. I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT I BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. If he says my children can be saved, I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S going to happen, BUT IF HE SAID IT, I believe it. Bid me to come. And so, here Peter, you know, unlike the other ones, they were afraid, but now he's walking upon the water. And this is where many of us are. We're we're walking with God. We're we're resting in the will of the Lord. We're resting in what God says we can do. But then problems comes, trials comes. And and brother Brandham says that that he wasn't walking on water. He was walking on substance, which faith is the substance. So he was walking upon his faith. And as he's walking, brother Brandham would tell us that the wave started to started to to get big and Peter got afraid. And as he became afraid, he started to sink. And I thought, "Oh my, many of us get there sometimes, don't we? We we start to sink in our fear. We start to sink in our trials. Start to sink in our circumstances. And here God's the one that told us to walk, you know, walk with me and be thou perfect. Walk with me. It was Enoch that would walk with God until he was raptured out of here. And he's our type. We're walking with God. And here is he was sinking. I love it. Because Peter wasn't responsible for walking on the water. Christ was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wasn't responsible to fulfill the word. Christ was all he HAD TO DO WAS REACH UP and as he was sinking in his fear, sinking in his anxiety, sinking in in his untrustness, HERE WOULD COME GOD would reach down his hand and we see I got you. And maybe some of us are there tonight as our as our musician comes tonight. Sometimes we get there where we're where we're sinking in our trials. were sinking in in our troubles and and and it's hard to trust God, but yet he would come his word. He sent his word and healed our diseases. You know, he would send a word in the right season and would say, "You might be in a hard time right now, but I'm walking with you." &gt;&gt; Are you thankful that God walks with us? &gt;&gt; It ain't just us walking in our own ability, but it's him walking with us. Because if he walks with us, he's the one that can change situations. Hallelujah. And I believe he's walking with us. You remember the story of the the footprints on the sands of time. And I know that's a it's a common story, but the man, you know, when he he he'd have a dream, I believe, and he's talking to the Lord and he would say, "How come you left me?" And the Lord would say, "What do you mean?" He says, "Look, there was two two sets of footprints until the hardest time of my life when I needed you the most, and yet there's only one foot one set of footprints." And the Lord would speak back to him. I says, "What do you mean?" Said, "I didn't leave you there. That's where I picked you up and carried you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When we feel like we're all alone, it might we might feel that way, but in reality, we're resting in his arms. And that's why we have to rest. We can't fight against the word. We can't fight against the program of God. You have to give up and be carried by it. You remember the story of whenever the whenever the uh the the the preacher of a divine healing, he would get sick and would go into a coma and he would have a dream and he was a lumberjack. Y'all remember that? He and his boss would tell him in this dream, "Go up the mountain, cut down that log and bring it down to me." Y'all remember that? And he would go up, he would cut down the log and he would try to pick it up and he couldn't do it. And brother Brandon would tell us that the man would sit down and would start to cry. I can't do it. And why would the boss tell me to do something that I can't do? He's trying and he's trying. And then he he would hear a voice behind him said, "Roll it into the water and ride on it." He would look back cuz it was his boss. He looked and it was Christ saying, "Roll it into the water and ride on it." So when he couldn't do it, all he had to do was sit on it. Let the log do the rest. Hallelujah. Brother Brandon was saying God wouldn't give us something to do without giving us something to do it with. He says, "You just got to ride on it." He says, "If you're not on it," he says, "Jump on and ride on it." And that man, that that that preacher would wake up saying, "I'm riding on it. I'm riding on it." Right there, God would heal him. Hallelujah. We're not trying to make the word live. The word is making itself live in us. We're just riding on it. We're just resting in it. Amen. Let's bow our heads here this evening. Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, we're thankful for your your presence and your anointing that we felt here tonight, Lord, thank you for the the inspiration of your word, Lord, that that can come and strengthen, Father, and pick us up when we're discouraged. Pick us up when we feel like we're alone, Lord. And if there's some here that that might be discouraged, Lord, might feel like like you have forsaken them, Lord. God, may you be El Shadi to them like you would come to Abraham and say, "Walk with me, Lord. And I ask, Father, that they would grab a hold of your word here tonight, Lord." And may they get some strength for the journey. Maybe there's some here that ain't satisfied, Lord. May they get into the word for themselves and be persuaded that this word is the truth and they can rest in it. Lord, how we love you and we're thankful for all of these things in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you here tonight. Can we sing Amazing Grace as we as we turn her to our pastor? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. God bless you. but now I'm found. Let's stand together. Was blind, but now I see. was grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved. How precious did that grace appear. The hour I first believed through many danger to snares. I have already come. His grace have brought me safe thus far. And grace will lead me home. When we've been there 10,000 years, bright shineing as the sun we know less is to sing God's praise. And when we first beun, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. You're worthy, Lord God. Praise God. Praise God. God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Amen. I'm sure we all can testify that God has brought us through so many things. Amen. &gt;&gt; What a word of encouragement tonight. &gt;&gt; What a word of encouragement. &gt;&gt; I mean, I feel like we all went up 20 levels. &gt;&gt; Man. Man, I'm so glad God put on his heart to come by here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, it's I I believe it's his desire. It's God's desire that we would retain this word in our heart and put it to use. &gt;&gt; Right. Don't let the devil discourage us, but rest in God. Trust in God. I believe that's what the word came for is to help us through our trials. And uh we just sung it. We we we've come through so many and uh we we got more that we're going to go through, right? It it don't stop. I mean, we can talk to the oldest person here. We can just ask them. Have the trials stopped yet? &gt;&gt; No. We still have an opportunity to trust the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we really appreciate that word. Let's just sing uh I love him. If anybody wants special prayer, just come forward. Our brother will pray unite with you. Amen. While he's here. I love him. I love him because he first loved me and perfect my salvation Calories tree. I love him. I love him because he first loved me and purchased my salvation.
