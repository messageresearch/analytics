[36:01] ecclesiastes chapter 9
[36:04] verse number 10
[36:08] whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it
[36:13] with thy might for there is no work
[36:16] nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom
[36:19] in the grave whether thou goest
[36:23] and then the book of psalms
[36:27] chapter 90 and verse number 12.
[36:35] so teach us to number our days that we
[36:38] may apply our hearts
[36:40] unto wisdom amen god bless you may be
[36:43] seated
[36:47] brother branham
[36:50] in a prayer that he prayed in the
[36:54] hebrews
[36:55] series chapter 6
[36:58] he says now father receive our worship
[37:02] this morning take the word
[37:06] and plant it into
[37:09] the believer's heart amen
[37:12] may they not just may they not be
[37:16] just tossed about and up today
[37:20] and top and down tomorrow but may these
[37:23] words
[37:24] find their resting place in every
[37:26] believer's heart
[37:27] that's right amen
[37:31] that's our goal not just to have a
[37:33] wonderful service
[37:34] but to take the word in our heart and
[37:37] become
[37:38] a different creature down the road
[37:43] this evening we want to entitle this
[37:45] message plant your potatoes
[37:48] i'm sure you've heard brother branham
[37:50] talk about that
[37:55] our opening scripture here
[37:59] it says whatsoever thy hand find it to
[38:01] do do it with all they might yes
[38:04] amen because there's coming a time that
[38:06] when when
[38:07] we're in the grave there is no work
[38:11] no device no knowledge no wisdom
[38:14] when we go into the grave so today is
[38:17] the day
[38:18] amen to work right it's true
[38:21] amen and all that we have is our life
[38:24] right it doesn't matter how much money
[38:26] you have that's true that's right
[38:29] it just matters what you're going to do
[38:30] with your life
[38:32] jesus gave us some parables about
[38:35] talents
[38:35] one had five one had two one had one
[38:39] and the one that had five he went and
[38:41] doubled
[38:42] the one that had two he went double the
[38:45] one that had
[38:46] won he pretty much used his life for
[38:49] himself
[38:51] he gave another parable about ten
[38:54] servants
[38:56] and those ten servants he gave them each
[38:58] one
[38:59] pound and he commanded them all
[39:02] ten servants to occupy till i come
[39:07] now he has given us all life
[39:12] we don't all have the same talents
[39:15] the same ability but we have to give the
[39:18] same accountability
[39:24] as the song goes only one life so soon
[39:27] it will pass
[39:28] only what's done for christ will last
[39:31] only one chance to do his will so give
[39:34] to jesus all your day
[39:36] it's the only life that pays when you
[39:38] recall
[39:39] you have just one life
[39:44] if you were to die today would you be
[39:46] happy with how you spent
[39:48] the last year
[39:53] would you be happy how you spent the
[39:54] last year
[40:00] this world's going insane
[40:06] i was so glad when the mass were over
[40:11] and now they're pointing right back
[40:16] and i don't know if we'll ever see the
[40:19] last of the vex
[40:20] uh the the viruses the mutations
[40:24] we don't know what's before us we just
[40:26] know there's a squeeze
[40:28] coming we know the n
[40:31] is coming we know it's going to be worse
[40:32] than it's ever been on the planet
[40:36] and all of us have this hope inside it
[40:38] can't be now we got more time we want to
[40:40] live there's more things we want to do
[40:42] but the end is soon amen
[40:47] and we we need to be occupying our time
[40:50] amen the very best that we can for the
[40:52] lord
[40:54] turn with me if you would to the book of
[40:55] john chapter 21.
[40:58] john chapter 21 starting with verse
[41:00] number 14.
[41:02] so here's a a time now that
[41:06] um jesus
[41:10] and and peter were alone
[41:14] and uh starting here at verse 14 the
[41:18] bible says this is now the
[41:20] third time that jesus showed himself to
[41:22] his disciples
[41:23] after that he had been risen from the
[41:25] dead
[41:27] kind of give us a time when this
[41:29] happened
[41:30] so when they had dying jesus saith to
[41:34] simon peter simon son of jonas loveth
[41:37] thou mean more than these
[41:40] must have been maybe went like this to
[41:43] all the other disciples
[41:45] he saith unto him yay lord thou knowest
[41:48] i love thee and he sayeth unto him
[41:51] feed my lambs and he sayeth unto him
[41:55] again the second time
[41:56] simon son of jonas loveth thou me
[41:59] he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest
[42:02] that i love thee
[42:04] and he saith unto him feed my sheep
[42:09] he sayeth unto him the third time simon
[42:12] son of jonas lovest thou me
[42:15] peter was grieved think about the
[42:18] statement
[42:19] he was grieved that means distressed
[42:23] and sorrowful yes amen at god
[42:27] speaking to him
[42:30] jesus question brought a
[42:34] heaviness to peter
[42:37] because he said unto him the third time
[42:40] loveth thou mean
[42:42] and he said unto him lord thou knowest
[42:45] all things
[42:46] they'll know us that i love thee don't
[42:48] question me
[42:49] about my love for jesus
[42:54] that's what he was saying don't question
[42:56] me
[42:58] jesus saith unto him feed my
[43:01] sheep now notice this question was more
[43:05] important
[43:06] to jesus than it was to peter do you
[43:09] love me
[43:10] it was really important to jesus but to
[43:12] peter that
[43:13] you know i do done subject
[43:17] we don't need to go any further brother
[43:19] branham said at the end of the
[43:21] a stirring message is this the sign of
[43:23] the end sir
[43:25] he said do you love him
[43:28] and the congregation said amen and
[43:31] brother branham said be real
[43:33] sure of that be real sure of it amen
[43:37] i'll say we're at the end time amen it's
[43:40] something that we got to be
[43:41] sure of right now more than anything
[43:44] amen the amount of love that you are
[43:47] actively
[43:49] manifesting shows just how close you're
[43:52] following jesus
[43:54] yes because if you say you've got love
[43:58] and you ain't manifesting what good is
[43:59] it
[44:02] it's it's love is active it's got to be
[44:05] something that
[44:06] it's just pulsating every opportunity
[44:09] just
[44:10] being expressed amen most people do not
[44:13] view their personal relationship
[44:15] like that but jesus does he wants to see
[44:18] it
[44:19] manifested he said statements like this
[44:22] if you love me keep my commandments
[44:25] he said you are my friends if you do
[44:27] whatsoever i ask you
[44:29] by the manifestation of god's love in
[44:31] your flesh wall men
[44:32] know that you belong to him
[44:36] if you truly love me like you say you do
[44:40] then feed god's lambs
[44:44] feed a what sheep food
[44:49] feed them what is needed
[44:52] to draw their relationship closer to god
[44:55] amen because that's all that matters
[44:59] that's what real sheep does
[45:04] need to be following jesus amen
[45:08] verse 18 verily verily i say unto thee
[45:13] when you were young thou
[45:16] girdest thyself and walketh whether thou
[45:18] would us
[45:20] but when thou shalt be old thou shall
[45:23] stretch forth thy hands and another
[45:25] shall gird thee
[45:26] and carry thee whether thou wouldest
[45:30] not this spake he
[45:33] signifying by what death he should
[45:35] glorify god
[45:37] and when he had spoken this he saith
[45:39] unto him
[45:41] follow me so he he's
[45:45] he's telling peter
[45:52] what you need to focus on is following
[45:54] me
[45:56] amen when peter
[45:59] was first called to this relationship
[46:01] with god jesus said unto him
[46:03] follow me that's right peter follow me
[46:07] amen now after his death burial
[46:09] resurrection jesus is speaking the very
[46:12] same message to peter yes amen any
[46:15] different message
[46:16] the same message follow me amen amen
[46:21] the message if you love me completely
[46:24] you will
[46:24] follow me completely amen the bride will
[46:28] follow
[46:29] the bridegroom completely no matter no
[46:32] matter what
[46:33] where he leads i will follow she will
[46:35] follow
[46:36] amen so jesus tells peter
[46:42] how he's going to die but does not
[46:45] leave him in a mind battle
[46:49] about going forward
[46:52] you still got a job to do you still need
[46:55] to follow
[46:56] yes he tells peter to keep following
[46:59] right to the end of his life
[47:02] this is so important because we're going
[47:05] to
[47:05] such terrible times and it's only going
[47:08] to get worse
[47:10] 2022 will be worse
[47:14] i don't mean to be pro i'm not
[47:16] prophesying i'm not meeting trying to be
[47:18] negative
[47:19] what i am saying is do you believe we're
[47:21] in the end
[47:24] let's get ready to get out of here
[47:28] and peter got anxious in that moment
[47:31] about wanting to know the future of one
[47:35] of his good friends
[47:36] brother john and he asked jesus
[47:40] is john going to have to suffer like me
[47:43] let's pick it up in verse 20. then peter
[47:46] turning about seeth
[47:48] the disciple of jesus love falling which
[47:51] also leaned
[47:52] on the breast as supper and said lord
[47:55] which
[47:55] is he that betrayeth thee peter seeing
[47:59] him say it to jesus lord
[48:02] what shall this man do
[48:08] now jesus could have said a lot of
[48:10] things
[48:12] he could have told him exactly
[48:16] but look at his response jesus saith
[48:18] unto him
[48:19] if i will if it's my will that he
[48:23] tarry till i come what is it to you
[48:26] what is it to you it's none of your
[48:28] business
[48:30] follow me amen
[48:35] i understand that
[48:38] we all got some nosy noses
[48:41] at times not just about one another but
[48:45] about things
[48:50] and i want us to think about what is it
[48:51] to you
[48:57] was was peter trying to use jesus as cnn
[49:03] detroit news just to get some
[49:05] information
[49:09] it wasn't going to help peter
[49:12] we want to know things that don't help
[49:15] us
[49:19] then went this saying abroad
[49:23] among the brethren that that disciple
[49:26] should not
[49:27] die yet jesus did not
[49:32] did not said not unto him he shall not
[49:35] die
[49:36] but if i will that he territory come
[49:39] what is it to thee
[49:40] a notice the disciples weren't
[49:44] even understanding what jesus was saying
[49:48] these were his chosen disciples
[49:54] and they were you know trying to always
[49:56] figure things out
[50:01] it's amazing how easy it is for god's
[50:04] chosen to misunderstand what jesus is
[50:06] saying to them
[50:12] what jesus was really saying to peter
[50:14] and to all of us
[50:16] it's really none of our business what
[50:19] god is doing with one another
[50:26] it's god's business amen god can handle
[50:29] his business
[50:31] he's good at his business i'm terrible
[50:34] at his business
[50:38] i can barely handle my business let
[50:40] alone god's business
[50:45] in other words it's a private
[50:47] relationship between jesus
[50:49] and your brother and your sister amen
[50:52] don't meddle don't be a busybody in
[50:54] other people's business
[50:56] don't be telling others what to do and
[50:59] what not to do
[51:03] but it's perfectly in order if you want
[51:05] to pray with john
[51:08] peter if you want to go pray with john
[51:09] that's okay i think that's an order
[51:12] that would be so helpful and so
[51:13] encouraging to john
[51:20] but that's between jesus
[51:24] and john amen you know if we could just
[51:28] get that revelation
[51:30] just care about people amen pray with
[51:33] them
[51:34] we don't really care about anything else
[51:38] because god has not put it in our
[51:41] hands
[51:47] our job is whatever we find good to do
[51:50] do it with all our heart
[51:51] all of our might go wash somebody's feet
[51:54] help somebody pray with somebody
[51:56] that's what god's given you to do
[51:59] not tell them about something we don't
[52:02] even know
[52:04] look at peter walking around oh you know
[52:06] john he's not going to die jesus told me
[52:08] he's not going to die
[52:11] the bible says that's not what he said
[52:15] we could come to church and hear
[52:17] something and walk home
[52:19] with a wrong understanding of what was
[52:20] really even said
[52:24] and you could be sitting right next to
[52:26] the presence of jesus
[52:28] because peter was right next to jesus
[52:29] when that happened but he wasn't in the
[52:32] spirit he was in the flesh
[52:34] because if he would have been in the
[52:35] spirit that would have never been you
[52:36] don't misunderstand
[52:41] jesus is giving us a message
[52:45] and this is what our focus needs to be
[52:47] to fully
[52:48] completely follow jesus
[52:52] not half-hearted not on sundays and
[52:55] wednesdays
[52:56] not just when you need him amen
[53:00] not when it's convenient for you not
[53:02] just when your flesh gets something out
[53:04] of it
[53:06] or when you can know a little something
[53:08] about somebody else
[53:11] no but follow him completely
[53:15] get more serious about why you're here
[53:17] at church that you're going to leave
[53:19] church with something some instructions
[53:22] from jesus to follow him closer
[53:29] your job peter my chosen disciple with
[53:33] the keys of the kingdom
[53:34] is just to keep following me closer
[53:38] and closer and closer that's it it's the
[53:40] first instructions i gave you when i met
[53:43] you
[53:43] it's the last instructions i give you
[53:45] before i leave here
[53:46] [Music]
[53:48] we get to a place where we think well
[53:50] we're already following jesus something
[53:52] is wrong
[53:54] that's why we get off track
[54:00] i want you to keep planting your
[54:01] potatoes
[54:04] don't worry about other people's
[54:05] potatoes
[54:08] i just want you to focus on me on what
[54:11] i'm telling you to do
[54:13] don't be curious or concerned about what
[54:16] i
[54:16] tell your brothers and sisters
[54:21] just follow me you know we always want
[54:24] to be
[54:25] telling people what to do
[54:29] we ought to be more serious about
[54:31] getting instructions from jesus what he
[54:33] wants us to do
[54:40] too often our focus becomes anything but
[54:43] what christ wants us to do today
[54:47] we often end up pursuing our own goals
[54:49] following our own desires
[54:52] or wanting to know what's behind
[54:54] everything that's happening
[54:56] in the comos world
[55:00] cosmos world that's right what's
[55:02] happening out there what's happening out
[55:04] there
[55:05] well that thing is just ever evolving
[55:07] and ever growing and never getting
[55:09] weirder
[55:12] and we're just like so much want to know
[55:15] till we're never
[55:16] satisfied we wake up and want to know
[55:19] again what's more
[55:20] right true just follow me
[55:24] follow me not the world amen
[55:28] this world's falling apart
[55:32] we gotta focus on what god wants us to
[55:36] do
[55:37] amen don't even give two minutes
[55:40] about wha what about my brother what
[55:43] about my sister
[55:44] what are they gonna do
[55:49] if we're following christ we'll know
[55:51] what we'll do with our brother and
[55:52] sister
[55:55] all we need to do is hold the door open
[55:58] for him
[55:59] pray for them wash their feet
[56:02] that's what you do for your brother and
[56:03] sister
[56:06] well brother john i got barely got
[56:07] enough time to do my own stuff i can't
[56:09] be helping somebody like that i'd rather
[56:10] just sit and tell them what i think they
[56:12] should do
[56:15] think about what i'm saying follow me
[56:18] follow me
[56:22] not do what we want to do do what christ
[56:25] tells us to do
[56:28] amen you know when i say follow me i'm
[56:30] not telling you follow me
[56:33] and jesus saying follow me big
[56:36] difference
[56:37] don't ever follow me
[56:42] follow christ amen amen
[56:46] if you see i'm going towards christ then
[56:48] you follow christ
[56:51] if paul wants to say follow me as i
[56:53] follow christ that's good
[56:56] i'm not paul you follow christ
[56:59] amen yes god wants us focusing on our
[57:03] job
[57:04] and what he tells us to do it may seem
[57:07] like
[57:08] sometimes useless potatoes but plant
[57:12] them anyways
[57:13] god is looking for obedience
[57:18] he doesn't need our intelligence he
[57:21] needs us to follow him
[57:23] that's right when we look at our
[57:25] relationship with god
[57:26] we need to consider what is most
[57:29] important about that relationship
[57:32] and that is are we following what he
[57:34] told us to do
[57:37] do we even have a relationship to where
[57:40] we hear what he says and we actually do
[57:42] what he tells us to do
[57:47] that's a strong statement
[57:50] but it's a needful jesus says i have
[57:52] many things
[57:53] to tell you god is not lacking for
[57:56] things
[57:57] to tell us
[58:01] we may be lacking of wanting to know
[58:03] them
[58:05] we may be just concerned about making to
[58:09] church
[58:10] going to heaven that's it
[58:13] come on look at it the bride is going to
[58:16] be dressed
[58:17] and she's going to be just like jesus
[58:21] are we laying down our life for others
[58:25] or is it just the ones we choose to
[58:32] are we just getting others to lay down
[58:33] their lives for us
[58:37] where is our burden for souls we need to
[58:40] keep our eyes on the author
[58:42] and the finisher of our faith
[58:47] like many carnal or vanity relationships
[58:52] we're always wanting to get something
[58:55] from the other person
[58:58] our relationship with jesus can often
[59:01] slip in that category
[59:02] brother bam talks about making an iron
[59:04] boy out of him i read one quote brother
[59:07] brandon says god is not obligated to
[59:08] your desires
[59:09] he's obligated to his word
[59:15] so what about what jesus wants amen
[59:18] for you
[59:22] we're not serving some picture
[59:27] we're not serving some formal message
[59:33] we're not our relationship doesn't
[59:36] consist of some badge that says on bride
[59:40] i can prove it on bride
[59:45] god's alive and i'll say it like this
[59:47] that our relationship needs to be
[59:49] pulsating with instructions from jesus
[59:52] what he wants us to do
[59:53] now that's what our relationship should
[59:55] be
[59:57] something that's alive something that's
[59:59] real
[1:00:01] amen seeing we're in the message that
[1:00:04] you got this picture here we got the ten
[1:00:06] commandments here
[1:00:10] here's my badge i'm in the message no
[1:00:14] we don't understand testify anytime any
[1:00:17] day
[1:00:17] this is the last thing god told me this
[1:00:19] is what he wants me to do this is what
[1:00:21] i'm pursuing
[1:00:22] this is the change that's happening in
[1:00:23] my life that's where allah our
[1:00:25] relationship needs to be
[1:00:26] amen that's not happening that we need
[1:00:30] to press into christ
[1:00:32] you can't blame the preaching because
[1:00:34] i'm telling you ain't no different if
[1:00:36] you just sit and listen to the messages
[1:00:38] sit listen to messages live stream all
[1:00:40] you want i'm telling you the thing needs
[1:00:42] to be real to you
[1:00:44] that's true
[1:00:49] undoubtedly jesus has instructions for
[1:00:51] us
[1:00:53] he's not slack concerning his promises
[1:00:55] and he's not slack
[1:00:57] concerning giving us instructions
[1:01:02] we have instructions
[1:01:06] from god i remember as a young christian
[1:01:10] god was speaking to me and i
[1:01:14] didn't catch it
[1:01:17] and i'm sure it's happened many times
[1:01:18] since then but i just remember
[1:01:20] the remember at the beginning
[1:01:25] maybe we've been too busy for him
[1:01:28] to find our instructions
[1:01:31] maybe we've been too proud to receive
[1:01:33] them
[1:01:36] too tired when they're being spoken
[1:01:40] too angry or frustrated to even care
[1:01:44] think about it but god has given us
[1:01:46] instructions
[1:01:48] he has instructions for our relationship
[1:01:51] instructions that we need to be carrying
[1:01:53] out instructions to
[1:01:55] plant our potatoes that's right
[1:01:59] our potatoes
[1:02:03] do we care enough to pay the price to
[1:02:05] receive him
[1:02:07] to carry out the instructions until
[1:02:10] jesus comes because that's exactly what
[1:02:12] he told peter
[1:02:14] follow me
[1:02:17] peter could have said i am following you
[1:02:19] i'm here with you
[1:02:24] we never considered that we're not
[1:02:25] following jesus
[1:02:29] well that'd be a slap in the face of
[1:02:31] peter peter you weren't
[1:02:32] following jesus
[1:02:36] don't get focused on somebody else don't
[1:02:39] get focused on this world
[1:02:41] follow jesus
[1:02:50] there was a an ad in a paper and a
[1:02:52] fortune
[1:02:53] 500 company was
[1:02:57] needing an executive to fill a position
[1:03:02] and so as the
[1:03:07] people read the ad and they began to
[1:03:10] set up interviews and they came to this
[1:03:14] skyscraper
[1:03:16] and one by one they went in for
[1:03:18] interviews
[1:03:19] and as they came into the room they
[1:03:22] noticed
[1:03:23] that there was a pile of bricks sitting
[1:03:25] to the one side of the room
[1:03:28] and they thought well this is kind of
[1:03:29] odd because i'm here for an executive
[1:03:31] position
[1:03:33] and the man the the higher
[1:03:36] hiree asked the questions
[1:03:39] uh to try to get to know a little bit
[1:03:41] about this man
[1:03:44] and after a few questions he said okay
[1:03:46] we'd like you to go ahead and
[1:03:47] and just take these bricks over here and
[1:03:50] then move them all
[1:03:51] over to this side of the room would you
[1:03:53] do that for us
[1:03:56] and many of them
[1:04:00] were disgusted at the thought of doing
[1:04:02] that because they had their tie on
[1:04:05] they came in for an executive position
[1:04:06] it's not a labor and they
[1:04:08] stormed out mad and angry i i'm not a
[1:04:12] labor i didn't come here to do this this
[1:04:15] is a crazy place anyways
[1:04:17] i've never been in an interview like
[1:04:19] this yeah
[1:04:23] and so they kept going through a number
[1:04:26] of them
[1:04:27] and no one was
[1:04:31] willing to move those bricks until they
[1:04:35] found
[1:04:35] one that would move the bricks but when
[1:04:38] he was asked again to move him back over
[1:04:40] there
[1:04:42] he just ran out and just said forget
[1:04:44] this place
[1:04:48] so this one man came he moved the bricks
[1:04:51] and when they asked him to move him back
[1:04:53] he moved him back and he said
[1:04:54] hey is there anything else you want me
[1:04:56] to do
[1:05:00] he said yeah there's one more thing i
[1:05:01] want you to do i want you to get here
[1:05:02] tomorrow morning you're hired
[1:05:04] there's your office over there because
[1:05:07] he could follow
[1:05:08] instructions
[1:05:12] who cares about ability if you can't
[1:05:14] trust somebody
[1:05:17] it's worthless that's right and it's
[1:05:19] worthless to god
[1:05:20] if he can't trust us
[1:05:23] he just wants us to follow him amen
[1:05:26] plant potatoes
[1:05:29] it may seem so silly so much does it
[1:05:32] this is not what i'm a church for this
[1:05:34] is not why i come to church
[1:05:43] obviously the man was hungry to follow
[1:05:45] instructions
[1:05:46] he was willing to pay the price and
[1:05:49] that's what god is looking for
[1:05:52] someone who's willing to follow him like
[1:05:54] that not just
[1:05:55] wealth no way i'm not doing that i'm not
[1:05:58] doing that i'm not i am not
[1:06:00] i am not coming to church early to pray
[1:06:03] i am not going to say afterwards to pray
[1:06:12] move the bricks plant the potatoes
[1:06:16] we've got to trust god is leading his
[1:06:18] pride amen
[1:06:20] to get ready turn with me if you went to
[1:06:22] matthew chapter 19 verse 25
[1:06:24] amen
[1:06:28] when jesus was expressing just how hard
[1:06:30] it was to be saved his disciples could
[1:06:32] hardly
[1:06:33] believe it they were just
[1:06:37] amazed
[1:06:41] when his disciples heard it they were
[1:06:43] exceeding amazed saying who
[1:06:44] then can be saved
[1:06:49] but jesus beheld them said unto them
[1:06:50] with men this
[1:06:52] is impossible with god all things are
[1:06:58] possible
[1:07:00] then peter said unto him behold we have
[1:07:02] forsaken all
[1:07:04] and follow thee what shall we
[1:07:07] have therefore in other words what more
[1:07:09] can we actually do
[1:07:11] than what we've done and jesus tells
[1:07:14] them
[1:07:17] and jesus said to them very i say unto
[1:07:19] you
[1:07:20] that ye which have followed me in the
[1:07:22] regeneration
[1:07:23] when the son of man sit shall sit in the
[1:07:26] throne of his glory that's your heart
[1:07:28] friends
[1:07:30] at your heart friends that's
[1:07:34] where god is glorified when he sits on
[1:07:36] the throne
[1:07:37] of your heart he also shall sit
[1:07:40] upon the twelve thrones judging the
[1:07:43] twelve trials of israel
[1:07:47] and everyone that have forsaken houses
[1:07:49] brothers and sisters fathers mothers
[1:07:51] wife children lands for my name's sake
[1:07:53] shall receive a hundredfold
[1:07:55] and shall inherit everlasting life
[1:07:59] that word regeneration is spiritual
[1:08:03] restoration of the new birth
[1:08:06] and we have to follow christ to that
[1:08:08] amen
[1:08:10] not just saying well i've been baptized
[1:08:14] i repented i've accepted the message
[1:08:18] and i'm born again that isn't
[1:08:22] it that is
[1:08:24] part of it but that is not it
[1:08:31] every day that you're alive you have a
[1:08:33] chance
[1:08:35] to become more like christ yes
[1:08:39] but if your vision that you're concerned
[1:08:42] you ain't worried about it you ain't
[1:08:43] interested in it
[1:08:45] it just happened if it's going to happen
[1:08:46] if it don't it don't
[1:08:53] you have to keep following me
[1:08:59] he has something special for us saints
[1:09:01] he has a nature change
[1:09:03] a nature think about that to a place
[1:09:05] where somebody can hit you and you don't
[1:09:07] hate them
[1:09:08] i'm talking about that you can't
[1:09:10] manufacture that
[1:09:11] amen somebody can
[1:09:14] can despitefully use you and it don't
[1:09:17] bother you you pray for them
[1:09:20] that's a nature change
[1:09:25] it's not just message joining
[1:09:28] regeneration is not message joining
[1:09:34] we need to keep following jesus to the
[1:09:36] end amen
[1:09:39] we need to not only be willing to follow
[1:09:41] the most ridiculous instructions
[1:09:44] of planting potatoes but we need to
[1:09:46] remember that god is leading
[1:09:47] us to get ready for a rapture amen
[1:09:51] some of the things that god asked us to
[1:09:53] do have nothing to do
[1:09:55] with itself nature change and rapture
[1:09:58] but has everything to do with our
[1:10:00] character change
[1:10:02] changing our character that he wants to
[1:10:05] be around
[1:10:07] in other words he may ask you to do
[1:10:09] something a little bit different than me
[1:10:10] and it may actually not even be
[1:10:14] spiritual
[1:10:16] but it has everything to do with our
[1:10:18] character
[1:10:21] he if you were going to have a business
[1:10:25] a family uh a kingdom
[1:10:29] would you want to be surrounded with
[1:10:30] people of light precious faith
[1:10:33] light precious character light precious
[1:10:36] love
[1:10:37] would you like somebody that was always
[1:10:39] stirring up the nest
[1:10:42] always trying to stir things up and
[1:10:45] no i mean jesus got rid of lucifer
[1:10:50] got him out of the kingdom
[1:10:53] you want to be proud i resist you
[1:10:59] so god is working on us amen he's
[1:11:02] getting us ready he knows what he's
[1:11:04] doing
[1:11:08] he's building a glorious church
[1:11:12] without spot or wrinkle amen a
[1:11:14] tabernacle
[1:11:16] not made with hands a magnificent
[1:11:20] cathedral for god to dwell in that's
[1:11:22] what god is building
[1:11:24] inside of each of us yes turn with me to
[1:11:26] first peter chapter two
[1:11:28] first peter chapter two verse five ye
[1:11:30] also as
[1:11:31] lively stones are built up a
[1:11:35] spiritual house uh
[1:11:38] a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:11:42] sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus
[1:11:45] christ
[1:11:46] now how many today in church and
[1:11:50] just be honest
[1:11:54] you thought
[1:11:57] i i shouldn't have to praise god anymore
[1:12:01] than i'm doing right now
[1:12:04] i'm praising god enough
[1:12:09] i i i wasn't watching i i
[1:12:12] i i don't know who was praising god i
[1:12:15] don't know if it was
[1:12:16] brother mark or who it was but it was
[1:12:20] wonderful it was wonderful to build an
[1:12:23] atmosphere that god wants to be in
[1:12:31] yes it makes our flesh feel
[1:12:32] uncomfortable
[1:12:35] but it needs to be
[1:12:38] i feel i'm so short of god's glory
[1:12:42] so short of giving him the glory he's
[1:12:45] worthy of
[1:12:45] amen why would i entertain thoughts of
[1:12:48] i'm worshiping him enough i shouldn't
[1:12:51] have to do it anymore
[1:12:57] so may the praise be stronger
[1:13:02] more heartfelt more of a sacrifice
[1:13:06] [Music]
[1:13:09] that's what we're called to be to
[1:13:12] to offer up spiritual sacrifices that
[1:13:15] are acceptable to god by jesus christ
[1:13:17] ephesians chapter 2 verse 19. ephesians
[1:13:21] 2 verse 19 now therefore year no more
[1:13:23] strangers and foreigners
[1:13:24] but fellow citizens with the saints
[1:13:29] and of the household of god
[1:13:33] and are built upon the foundation the
[1:13:35] apostles and prophets jesus christ
[1:13:37] himself being the chief cornerstone in
[1:13:39] whom
[1:13:40] all the building fitly
[1:13:44] framed together now what do they do
[1:13:49] they sit like a bump on log no they
[1:13:52] groweth
[1:13:53] onto a holy temple in the lord in whom
[1:13:57] you also are builded together
[1:14:00] for a habitation through the spirit
[1:14:08] god wants to use our vessels
[1:14:13] what may seem is idle potatoes or vain
[1:14:16] may be
[1:14:17] a very important part of our character
[1:14:19] building
[1:14:20] amen of god's tabernacle right now
[1:14:23] because it's about god's tabernacle
[1:14:30] did you ever have to do something and
[1:14:32] you wonder why you had to do it
[1:14:35] like this is crazy this is in vain
[1:14:38] god doesn't make us do anything in vain
[1:14:41] there's always something behind what
[1:14:43] god's asking us to do
[1:14:45] god is leading us to a complete
[1:14:47] regeneration a complete
[1:14:48] spiritual restoration of a new birth
[1:14:52] yes amen
[1:14:55] we didn't just join the message right
[1:14:58] yeah
[1:14:59] i don't want to be part of that group
[1:15:01] are you part of the message
[1:15:03] i don't know what does that mean there's
[1:15:04] a lot of weird things in the message
[1:15:09] i want what brother brandon brought
[1:15:11] through that message to be living in me
[1:15:19] after the great fire of 1666
[1:15:22] in which london was just
[1:15:26] burnt really bad
[1:15:29] there was a traveler that was going by
[1:15:31] and they were building and they
[1:15:32] he came across this one
[1:15:36] area that they were trying to build and
[1:15:39] they were laying
[1:15:40] bricks and there was three bricklayers
[1:15:44] and he was wondering what they were
[1:15:45] going to build there so he just he asked
[1:15:47] the first one
[1:15:49] what are you doing and he said
[1:15:53] oh i'm laying bricks i'm working as hard
[1:15:56] as i can i'm trying to make a living for
[1:15:58] my family
[1:16:00] the man wasn't quite satisfied so he
[1:16:03] asked a second bricklayer what are you
[1:16:05] doing
[1:16:06] he said oh i'm a builder
[1:16:10] and i'm building this wall
[1:16:14] he still wasn't satisfied with what they
[1:16:16] were actually
[1:16:18] building there so he asked the third
[1:16:21] person the third bricklayer what are you
[1:16:23] doing
[1:16:26] and with the grin he looks at him and
[1:16:28] says oh
[1:16:30] i'm building a cathedral for the god
[1:16:32] almighty to dwell in
[1:16:33] [Music]
[1:16:37] and a lot of times we can just come to
[1:16:39] church
[1:16:41] because it's monday or wednesday
[1:16:44] or sunday and wednesday
[1:16:50] or we could just come to church because
[1:16:52] we're going to make a
[1:16:53] a career out of it i've said it i'm
[1:16:56] going to make a career we're just going
[1:16:57] to build this wall
[1:17:01] or we can come to church with a vision
[1:17:04] i've got to find out
[1:17:05] where i'm at with god because i'm going
[1:17:07] to build a cathedral
[1:17:09] for god to dwell in amen
[1:17:16] yes there ain't nothing more than satan
[1:17:17] would want us to think that
[1:17:19] well you know god's in you the moment
[1:17:20] you ask him in your heart and that's all
[1:17:21] you need to do
[1:17:24] just bypass everything else
[1:17:27] why does our life get to a place where
[1:17:29] we should just just bricks just
[1:17:31] laying bricks no vision
[1:17:36] just make a career to go to church i
[1:17:38] guess just take my family go to church
[1:17:41] but where is the interest of making your
[1:17:45] life
[1:17:46] a place for god almighty to have his way
[1:17:56] in
[1:17:59] don't you want god to make a cathedral
[1:18:01] to you
[1:18:05] first peter chapter two
[1:18:09] keep following god's instructions
[1:18:14] because he knows what he wants exactly
[1:18:18] you to be amen don't worry about your
[1:18:22] brother
[1:18:23] don't worry about your sister
[1:18:27] first peter chapter 2 verse 9 but you're
[1:18:29] a chosen generation a royal priesthood a
[1:18:31] holy nation a peculiar people
[1:18:33] that you should show forth the praises
[1:18:35] of him that called you out of darkness
[1:18:37] into his marvelous light
[1:18:39] which in times past were not a people
[1:18:42] but are now the people of god
[1:18:47] you ever had your parents tell you
[1:18:50] how old are you act your age
[1:18:54] well we're the people of god act like it
[1:18:57] right
[1:18:58] amen
[1:19:01] which have not which had had not
[1:19:04] obtained mercy but
[1:19:05] now have obtained mercy in other words
[1:19:08] that means
[1:19:08] you should be showing mercy to others
[1:19:10] yes at one time when you didn't have
[1:19:13] mercy
[1:19:13] i can see you beating somebody else over
[1:19:15] the head but now that you have obtained
[1:19:17] mercy
[1:19:17] you should be given mercy
[1:19:21] dearly beloved i beseech you as
[1:19:22] strangers and pilgrims abstain
[1:19:25] from fleshly lust which war against
[1:19:28] the soul now god purchased your soul at
[1:19:32] calvary
[1:19:34] but it still has a free more agent
[1:19:38] and when yielded to the wrong things it
[1:19:40] can bring you downs
[1:19:41] spiritually so we have to learn to
[1:19:44] crucify the flesh
[1:19:46] and abstain from fleshly lust which
[1:19:49] war against the soul
[1:19:52] even though your soul is saved
[1:19:55] they're still uh oh satan don't want to
[1:19:59] give up
[1:20:02] and he'll do everything to get you
[1:20:06] to lose your soul right
[1:20:10] yes but god not only purchased our souls
[1:20:14] he purchased our bodies
[1:20:17] it belongs to him god also
[1:20:20] not only bought your your soul at
[1:20:22] calvary but he bought your temple
[1:20:25] amen amen first corinthians chapter 6
[1:20:28] verse 19.
[1:20:30] why do you buy your temple to dwell in
[1:20:33] it
[1:20:34] amen he wants to dwell in it amen
[1:20:37] first corinthians chapter 6 verse 19
[1:20:39] what know ye not that your body
[1:20:41] is the temple of the holy ghost which is
[1:20:42] in you which ye have of god and you are
[1:20:45] not your
[1:20:46] own you were bought don't be telling
[1:20:49] god he can't do what he wants to do with
[1:20:51] you
[1:20:53] second corinthians chapter six second
[1:20:56] corinthians chapter six verse 16
[1:20:58] what agreement at the temple of god with
[1:21:00] idols
[1:21:02] think about these things that war
[1:21:04] against your soul for ye
[1:21:06] are the temple of the living god as god
[1:21:08] has said i will dwell in them and i will
[1:21:09] walk in them
[1:21:10] and i will be their god and they shall
[1:21:12] be my people
[1:21:14] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:21:16] be
[1:21:17] separate saith the lord and touch not
[1:21:18] the unclean thing and i will receive you
[1:21:20] amen and will be a father unto you and
[1:21:23] you shall be my sons and daughters saith
[1:21:24] the lord almighty now when we were in
[1:21:26] the did not when we were in the world
[1:21:28] i didn't even understand the difference
[1:21:30] between denomination
[1:21:31] and non-denomination
[1:21:35] well that scripture you know you come
[1:21:37] out of the world you start going to
[1:21:38] church
[1:21:39] you think you're separated and the
[1:21:41] prophet came
[1:21:42] and he taught us in the church of
[1:21:45] laodicea
[1:21:46] was a denomination
[1:21:49] and to come out of her my people
[1:21:52] we read it in revelations to be
[1:21:55] separated from that
[1:21:57] right well unfortunately when we left
[1:22:01] the world
[1:22:02] and we left the denominations the spirit
[1:22:05] of darkness
[1:22:06] didn't stay over there
[1:22:10] things that still war against us
[1:22:15] we constantly have to separate
[1:22:19] things jump on us we got to get them off
[1:22:25] don't get to a place where you think
[1:22:27] while you've separated
[1:22:31] enough you understand what i'm saying
[1:22:34] because things can get on us we could
[1:22:36] watch something
[1:22:38] all of a sudden before you know it we're
[1:22:39] not praying very much we're not
[1:22:40] interested in other people's souls
[1:22:42] we have no burden we don't want to come
[1:22:44] to church to to to pray
[1:22:46] it just before you know it it's just all
[1:22:48] about us
[1:22:50] we need to separate yes we need to
[1:22:53] separate
[1:22:56] to follow christ means to follow his
[1:22:58] instructions
[1:23:00] and god has instructions for us many of
[1:23:02] them the bride is not sitting down she's
[1:23:05] not idle
[1:23:07] she knows her days are numbered she has
[1:23:10] applied her heart to wisdom
[1:23:12] and whatsoever her hand's fine to do
[1:23:14] she's doing it with all her might
[1:23:16] yes amen i'm speaking to the bride
[1:23:21] this is sheep food
[1:23:25] the bride has received her instructions
[1:23:28] and has followed christ
[1:23:30] and the bride is receiving her
[1:23:32] instructions and is following
[1:23:34] those instructions
[1:23:37] and at times it may seem in vain what i
[1:23:39] got to do i just
[1:23:41] come and pray every time i come early
[1:23:43] what difference does it make nothing
[1:23:44] happens
[1:23:47] plant your potatoes
[1:23:50] nothing is in vain what god tells you to
[1:23:53] do
[1:23:53] amen in the message questions and
[1:23:56] answers on the seals brother and said
[1:23:59] jesus come tomorrow you be found
[1:24:02] faithful
[1:24:03] right at the duty
[1:24:06] you be found faithful at the duty
[1:24:11] if you're building a church go on and
[1:24:13] put it up
[1:24:16] so uh i told us talking to brother mike
[1:24:18] earlier today
[1:24:20] god and uh just talking a little bit
[1:24:23] about how close it is to the end and how
[1:24:26] crazy things are and and uh he said well
[1:24:29] by the time i get the church all done
[1:24:31] the doors will be closed we won't be
[1:24:32] able to use it anyways
[1:24:35] and i was just teasing but brother
[1:24:38] brandon put it
[1:24:39] real good here he says if you're
[1:24:41] building a church go on
[1:24:43] and put it up i'd rather be putting
[1:24:46] my money in something like that can be
[1:24:49] found
[1:24:50] with it in my pocket
[1:24:54] so keep on continue as you
[1:24:57] are everybody understand now
[1:25:00] congregation says amen
[1:25:02] continue right on just go right on as
[1:25:05] you are
[1:25:06] now just don't stop just go right on
[1:25:10] just as you are keep on serving the lord
[1:25:14] yes amen no for instance if you were
[1:25:17] working for a man and you known it was
[1:25:20] 15 minutes before quitting time well
[1:25:23] you'd say oh just 15 minutes now so i
[1:25:25] might as well just go over and sit down
[1:25:29] he says you'd get dot for those 15
[1:25:31] minutes right right
[1:25:34] he says if you're planting wheat plant
[1:25:36] your wheat right
[1:25:37] right you're digging potatoes go on and
[1:25:39] dig them out
[1:25:42] you say well nobody will eat them
[1:25:44] anyways
[1:25:46] he said that don't make a difference
[1:25:48] right right dig them out anyways
[1:25:50] yes just continuous here see this is
[1:25:53] powerful to me because it doesn't matter
[1:25:56] if i can see with my eyes whether it's
[1:26:00] it's going to work or not if it's going
[1:26:01] to be useless or not or helpful or not
[1:26:04] god is looking for me to be obedient
[1:26:06] that's what the prophet is teaching me
[1:26:08] here
[1:26:12] we've gotten so much off into our own
[1:26:14] little

[1:28:14] know really important to me
[1:28:27] what's important is what god gives you
[1:28:32] not what you think is important
[1:28:37] it shouldn't have to go through your
[1:28:40] filter
[1:28:41] of wow this is important this isn't
[1:28:42] important
[1:28:47] you're like well it's not important for

[1:29:19] be holding away just as hard as i can
[1:29:23] and when he comes i'll drop the hole and

[1:29:28] amen how important it is
[1:29:31] to be doing what jesus wants you to do
[1:29:34] amen amen
[1:29:39] and don't be thinking that it doesn't
[1:29:41] matter right
[1:29:42] it's true amen
[1:29:45] because you might get caught off
[1:29:47] wondering what's happening with brother

[1:30:13] you amen
[1:30:23] whatever your hands find to do do it
[1:30:27] with all your might
[1:30:32] yes
[1:30:35] you know i would love a relationship
[1:30:37] that i could get up in the morning
[1:30:39] and there'd be no doubt in my mind god
[1:30:42] just writes it on a piece of paper
[1:30:45] this is it son this is what your job is
[1:30:48] today
[1:30:51] that ain't going to happen
[1:30:56] how many times have you let your child
[1:30:58] do something
[1:30:59] just to watch them what they're going to
[1:31:01] do did you i'm sure we've all done this
[1:31:04] as parents
[1:31:05] you give a piece of candy to one of them
[1:31:08] and you say share it
[1:31:11] and you want to see if they share it
[1:31:14] if they break it in half if they give
[1:31:17] them the bigger half or they take it
[1:31:19] and you're watching all this stuff at
[1:31:20] least i did right
[1:31:23] well god hands us what we all have our
[1:31:26] space of time
[1:31:27] right and he says occupy i'm watching
[1:31:30] you
[1:31:32] what are you going to do
[1:31:41] whatever your hands find good to do you
[1:31:44] are not going to have a chance when this
[1:31:45] life is over to wish i would did a
[1:31:47] little bit more for jesus
[1:31:49] i looked for a soul that's right
[1:31:52] this is it there's only chance you have
[1:31:58] well he didn't tell me he didn't tell
[1:32:01] you
[1:32:03] he told all his disciples to go yelp
[1:32:06] always you're saying you're not his
[1:32:07] disciple
[1:32:10] we're all called to be missionaries what
[1:32:12] message what what message you listen
[1:32:14] what part of the message are you
[1:32:15] listening to
[1:32:17] plant your potatoes
[1:32:21] it may seem in vain but plant them
[1:32:24] whatever god told you to do do it do it
[1:32:26] with all your heart all your might do it
[1:32:28] do it do it
[1:32:31] pray with your brother pray with your
[1:32:33] sister get him going
[1:32:35] amen god's coming soon
[1:32:39] amen you got time for a couple quotes
[1:32:45] this should be encouraging this is a
[1:32:48] message called oneness
[1:32:51] he says we know we make mistakes
[1:32:55] but you must look at that
[1:32:59] it's not your mistakes because you're
[1:33:02] always going to have them
[1:33:04] but you see it's following his rules
[1:33:09] it's following what he said do
[1:33:13] stumble and falling doesn't have one
[1:33:16] thing to do with it
[1:33:19] a real true servant if he'll stumble
[1:33:23] he'll get up again if he wobbles
[1:33:28] god pulls him right back in the path yes
[1:33:31] now listen to this as long as he's
[1:33:35] in the path of duty
[1:33:38] that's so important because if you're
[1:33:40] all kind of doing your own thing
[1:33:46] this is this that little it's like the
[1:33:48] two little word if
[1:33:52] you got to be with all your heart
[1:33:53] wanting to be in god's duty your your
[1:33:56] place where you where he's called you to
[1:33:57] be what you should be doing
[1:34:00] and then if you wobble you stumble you
[1:34:02] fall god pick you up
[1:34:05] but your heart is somewhere else besides
[1:34:07] the duty of god
[1:34:10] god's not obligated to death that's
[1:34:13] good but but if he's off the path of
[1:34:17] duty
[1:34:18] god's not obligated to him brother
[1:34:20] branham said
[1:34:22] but as long as he's in the path of duty
[1:34:24] god's obligated to him
[1:34:26] knowing that he's just a man or a woman
[1:34:29] amen he's obligated
[1:34:30] that person as long as they're in the
[1:34:32] path of duty now i'll just say it like
[1:34:34] this
[1:34:35] follow me if you're following him with
[1:34:38] everything he told you to do you're in
[1:34:40] the path of duty right
[1:34:42] but you this that don't matter
[1:34:46] don't expect guys not obligated that
[1:34:48] right
[1:34:49] in other words you got to have the
[1:34:50] attitude a humble attitude
[1:34:57] all right one more this is in the
[1:35:00] message a court trial brother man says
[1:35:01] now when
[1:35:02] a man plants a seed if you're a farmer
[1:35:05] or know anything about planting any seed
[1:35:08] if you plant a seed today some corn
[1:35:11] say you put it in your garden and
[1:35:14] tomorrow morning
[1:35:15] you go out and dig it up and look at it
[1:35:18] and say
[1:35:20] well there's no difference in it
[1:35:24] you plant it back and the next day
[1:35:28] you you go back and look at it and say
[1:35:32] there's no difference in it
[1:35:35] it will never come up it can't do it
[1:35:39] when you dug it up you spoiled the
[1:35:41] picture right there
[1:35:43] you've got to commit it to the earth and
[1:35:46] then it's
[1:35:47] up to the earth to do the rest of it
[1:35:51] amen don't be double-minded
[1:35:55] amen you plant a seed you say amen to
[1:35:57] the word you say i'm gonna do it
[1:35:59] you do it don't dig it up
[1:36:03] amen committed to god commit your
[1:36:05] situation to god amen
[1:36:09] the bible says if you commit your ways
[1:36:11] to the lord he will direct your paths
[1:36:13] but you got to commit it to him don't
[1:36:16] dig it up the next day
[1:36:17] commit it and let it go god is looking
[1:36:19] for our faith
[1:36:23] and every time that you look at your
[1:36:24] symptoms every time you look at your
[1:36:26] symptoms
[1:36:28] and testify about them complain about
[1:36:31] them
[1:36:33] god can never heal you
[1:36:37] he says you committed to god and believe
[1:36:39] his word and he'll bring it to pass
[1:36:43] whether it's sprouting whether it's
[1:36:45] whatever it's doing
[1:36:47] you don't care god promised it and
[1:36:49] potentially
[1:36:50] you have your healing when you accept it
[1:36:53] in
[1:36:53] seed form yes i'll just say every
[1:36:56] promise in the book is like that
[1:36:57] amen look i know it's hard we all want
[1:37:01] feelings we all want something to
[1:37:03] associate that this stand that we're
[1:37:05] taking with god
[1:37:06] is the right one and that we're not
[1:37:07] going to be disappointed but you can't
[1:37:10] go there you just got to take god and
[1:37:11] his word
[1:37:12] and believe it with everything you've
[1:37:13] got inside of you
[1:37:15] and let the chips fall where they're
[1:37:16] going to fall because one thing god
[1:37:19] can't lie god
[1:37:20] cannot lie amen amen he's looking for us
[1:37:23] to
[1:37:24] to hold on he's looking for shall we
[1:37:26] find faith
[1:37:27] in the end time when he comes
[1:37:31] he said if i ask you for an oak tree and
[1:37:34] you give me an acorn
[1:37:35] potentially i have an oak tree that's
[1:37:37] right and if i asked you for an ear of
[1:37:39] corn and you gave me a grain of corn
[1:37:41] potentially i have an ear corn
[1:37:42] yes then i commit it to the ground and
[1:37:45] water it and keep
[1:37:46] all the weeds away from it that
[1:37:49] would draw the strength from the ground
[1:37:51] around it i keep the weeds out separate
[1:37:53] yourself
[1:37:54] amen i love that
[1:37:57] then it'll automatically grow
[1:38:00] because it's committed yes
[1:38:04] and it's a germatic seed now if the seed
[1:38:07] isn't germatized it won't
[1:38:09] that's right but if the seed is germ of
[1:38:12] life in it
[1:38:13] there's nothing that can keep it from
[1:38:15] growing
[1:38:19] what was that oh
[1:38:22] oh no i'm i'm so sorry if i
[1:38:26] my brother if i knew that was your phone
[1:38:28] i would have never said a word
[1:38:31] i thought it was my fault i was going to
[1:38:34] apologize for that
[1:38:37] well praise the lord saints
[1:38:41] god has given us a chance in our life
[1:38:45] to grow and to become his the very image
[1:38:49] of christ
[1:38:52] it's nothing that we can just well i got
[1:38:54] baptized and it's up to him if he's
[1:38:56] going to do it if i'm
[1:38:57] no you've got to care about this
[1:39:00] situation
[1:39:01] you got to be involved you got to be
[1:39:02] willing to make sacrifices
[1:39:04] you got to be willing to to do things
[1:39:06] that you don't want to do
[1:39:08] to bring to pass what god is
[1:39:12] called us to do if
[1:39:16] we are seed brother ram says we're going
[1:39:19] to come forth
[1:39:19] that's right but how many people are not
[1:39:22] seed that satan is told
[1:39:26] hey your seed don't worry about it it's
[1:39:28] going to come
[1:39:30] and what's he trying to do he's trying
[1:39:32] to get
[1:39:34] the people off from separating more from
[1:39:37] the world
[1:39:39] from from consecrating their lives more
[1:39:43] to god
[1:39:44] for more prayer more pressing into the
[1:39:47] kingdom
[1:39:48] that's what satan's doing
[1:39:54] all honesty we don't know who's who
[1:39:57] think about it right we don't know who's
[1:40:01] who
[1:40:01] brother branham didn't know who's who
[1:40:03] that's right when the spirit of the lord
[1:40:05] came he could tell if there was a
[1:40:07] a kindred spirit there if it was of god
[1:40:09] or not
[1:40:10] but he don't know who's who he says us
[1:40:12] ministers don't know we just throw the
[1:40:13] net out
[1:40:15] [Music]
[1:40:17] so it'd be wrong for just me to
[1:40:21] send a message to you oh yeah your bride
[1:40:23] don't matter what you do
[1:40:25] i'd rather send the message your bride
[1:40:26] no act like the bride
[1:40:30] not saying you're not bright and just
[1:40:32] saying we got to tally up to what the
[1:40:33] prophet taught us
[1:40:34] we got to start following jesus not just
[1:40:37] add more to doing that jesus
[1:40:40] he's given us instructions every time we
[1:40:42] come to church amen let's stand together
[1:40:44] god bless you
[1:40:52] amen let's go before the lord in prayer
[1:41:00] every eye close every head bound mine
[1:41:03] is as well
[1:41:08] in your heart you're desiring to
[1:41:12] follow the lord closer
[1:41:16] if your heart's been pricked and know
[1:41:18] that
[1:41:21] you've been following jesus from afar
[1:41:23] and you want to follow him closer
[1:41:27] maybe you've taken some certain things
[1:41:29] lightly
[1:41:30] maybe you've been interested in just
[1:41:32] other people's lives
[1:41:34] but today you just want to
[1:41:38] consecrate yourself and focus on
[1:41:40] following the lord
