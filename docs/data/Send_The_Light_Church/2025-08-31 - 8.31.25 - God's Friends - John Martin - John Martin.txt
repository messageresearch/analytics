So let's be in special prayer. Yes. Yes. We got a chance to uh see Sterling just in the hall just before we came in. God bless you, brother Sterling, and your family. Amen. God bless you. And so good to see sister Essie with us today. We're expecting her to um maybe sing or we want to be in prayer for our sister because she's going through a lot of pain and that God would just just touch her body. Amen. Amen. If you would turn in in your Bibles with me to the book of St. John today. I trust each of us have been walking the road to Wellville. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before we begin reading in St. John chapter 15, let's um bow for just a word of prayer, I wonder before we pray, would there be anybody that's would say, "Brother John, there is something on my heart. I I really want God to move in that situation. Amen. Let's let's believe with our hearts. Heavenly Father, thank you that you are greater than all of our needs. Lord, you're your your word is so powerful. It's a discerner of the thoughts intents of our heart. And Lord, you sent your word to heal the people. You sent your word to uh lead, to guide, to correct, to make a way where there seemth to be no way. Your word will not return void. And Lord, as we come before you today with these needs, Lord, we ask that you would cleanse us all of our sins and our iniquities, may there be nothing that stands in the way of us being able to receive what we have need of today. God, bless all of us with faith today to take a hold of thy word. Forgive us of our doubts, fears, or trespasses, and anything, Lord, that is displeasing. Pray that you come this morning and be the faithful God that you are and draw us all closer to you, Lord. Bless thy word to our hearts. May it be so real that we leave here uh Lord that we leave here with a change in our nature. Lord, we thank you for the fellowship and the food that we're going to have uh after the service. And Lord, we just want to thank you for the food that we're going to have now, the spiritual food. And we just ask your blessings on both. Father, we love you. We thank thee for these things. we pray now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. St. John chapter 15, we're going to start reading with verse number 12. This is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you. &gt;&gt; Greater love have no man than this. &gt;&gt; That a man lay down his life for his friends. And ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you. And I want to take my text from this. and you are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth. But I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you. You have not chosen me but I have chosen you and have ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit. And this fruit is obviously at this point is to love one another as Christ has loved us. Amen. and that your fruit should remain and that whatsoever you ask the father in my name you he shall give it to you. These things I command you that you love one another. God bless you. You may be seated. Today we want to entitle this message God's friends. You know I have a lot of friends. I have a lot of friends from all over the world and they text me. They text me um and they'll I mean I got them from every country practically texting me friends. Friends that I didn't even know they were friends. Friends that say, "I got your name in my contacts. I just wonder who you are." Friends like, "Hey, my name is so and so. Where do you live?" Friends like um what are you doing today? Friends like hey do you want to talk later? Friends like um are you interested in um talking about a business? I've got friends all over the place. Friends that even know my name. Hey, hi John. This is soand so. Sometimes they even say John Martin. Thinking how do they even know that? But they they come across as friends and uh at work I've had a number of people call my phone and they want to sell me something and they act so friendly and then uh come to find out when you're not interested in buying they just want to be rude to you. Have you ever had have you ever thought you had a friend but only to come to find out they stabbed you in the back? Can anybody relate to this that I'm talking about today? &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you." He just made it real clear that there was something that had to be done to be a friend of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Is a God that loves everybody no matter what. But when it comes to friendship, that closeness, he wants us to do what he says. And if we do, he he makes known to us things that he doesn't make known to everybody else. And I'm so glad for a friendship with Jesus. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't trade it away for anything. He's a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. The Bible says, let's start out here in Luke 10:1. I'm going just a little background with the disciples. And there's all types of friendships. And we're just going to kind of get into that a little bit today. Luke 10:1 says, "After these things, the Lord appointed other 70." So, these are 70 other uh disciples also, and he sent them um two and two before his face into every city and place whether he himself would come. Therefore he said unto them, "The harvest is is great, but the laborers are few. Pray ye therefore that the Lord of harvest that he'll he would send forth laborers into the harvest." I I'll say the best way to build a church is to stop thinking about ourselves. &gt;&gt; That's right. You know, there's too too much thinking about ourselves and what the church should be doing. In in reality, the best way to build a church is to stop thinking about yourself. You think about others. And Jesus assigns 70 and sends them out two uh by two into every place. And they were casting out demons. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He did. They were they were casting out demons and they were healing all manners of sickness and diseases and it was a great miraculous time. And then drop down to verse 17. And the 70 returned again with joy, saying, Lord, the devils are subject unto us through thy name. And and um God, he's just so graceful how he talks. He's he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. In other words, he's bearing witness of what they just said. He says, "Behold, I I I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you." And then he says, "Notwithstanding in this, don't rejoice. Don't rejoice in this power that I have given you to cast out demons." Don't rejoice in that. Don't rejoice that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven. &gt;&gt; The 70 got a high out of having authority over demonic spirits. &gt;&gt; Lord, even the devils are subject to us through thy name. It made them happy to rejoice. But Jesus knew there was something wrong with that spirit. When somebody is bragging about that, something is wrong. Even the rejoicing, it's wrong. &gt;&gt; It was like they were lifted up in their pride and they they enjoyed the display of the power that they had and they they that the word uh had over those demons, but they lost track of what was really important. Notwithstanding, in spite of in this, rejoice that the spirits are uh that the uh rejoice not that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven. Motives are extremely important to God. &gt;&gt; But the correct thing to do is to give diligence to make sure your calling in election is sure. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. to make sure that the life that you're living today is displaying that your name is written in heaven. That's what's important. &gt;&gt; That's we sing that song. Can't you see why I'm so happy? &gt;&gt; I've accepted I have accepted the word of the Lord. Not that I've got power to cast out demons. You know, it's it's amazing to me how how some people will rejoice over that, but they can't seem to live for Jesus on a daily basis. &gt;&gt; I just I don't understand that. &gt;&gt; Verse 21, in that hour Jesus rejoiced in his spirit. Now notice this. Now Jesus is rejoicing in his spirit. This is a correct way of rejoicing here. And he said,"I thank thee, oh Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou has hid these things from the wise and the prudent, and have revealed them unto babes, even so, Father, so it seemed good in thy sight." So now he's rejoicing that God has the fathers actually hid the truth from these people. Wow. You know, God uh the Bible says flesh and blood will not enter the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; There are certain things that are not going to be in there. &gt;&gt; And God is holy and and and God is righteous and and and and God is going to have a heaven full of his kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not our kind. &gt;&gt; His kind. And so here he's he's he's saying, "Father, thank you that that that you hid this from this group of people who thought they were something special and you revealed him to those that that don't feel they're worth any are worthy of anything." And they they press in with all their heart to know Jesus &gt;&gt; because what does the all thing what does the Bible say? Verse 22. All things are delivered to me of my father, and no man knoweth the son but the father. And the and who the father is but the son and to whom the son will reveal. &gt;&gt; Going back to our our opening scripture that you are my friends and everything that I that the father has told me, I've told you. I I haven't held back anything. &gt;&gt; I've told you exactly what the father's told me. Isn't it wonderful to know that God, he doesn't keep seekas from his bride? I think that's a beautiful thing. Now look at verse 23. And he turned unto his disciples and he said privately. He turned away from the 70. He looked to the 12 and he said privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see. Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; There was a special relationship that Jesus had with his chosen disciples. A special friendship, a private friendship in which Jesus shared things only with them. They were God's friends. &gt;&gt; They were God's friends. Don't rejoice that the demons are subject to you, but rejoice that you have eternal life. Jesus rejoiced that eternal life was actually hidden from the wise and proved it. I mean, even look at even the devil didn't know what he was doing when he crucified Jesus. &gt;&gt; He hid it. John chapter 6 verse 59. Let's we've gone through these scriptures before, but let's try to go through these uh real good. And and you know, I I'll just say try to enter in because there is something here today about a friendship with God. These things said he in the synagogue uh John 6:59 as he taught in Capernium. So he said these things right in church and as he was teaching in the city capernium and many therefore of his disciples when they heard this they uh heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it? They went to church. He taught in the church. And their testimony was this is this is too hard. Who can hear? Why is this being said in church? This is not encouraging. This is too hard. And when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured, it was the disciples that murmured at it. He said unto them, "Does this offend you?" We're living in an hour where people are so easily offended. &gt;&gt; They get offended because you don't agree with the choices that they make or the attitude that they have and they get offended because you just don't agree with it. You don't agree with their behavior. You look at them wrong. you say something wrong and they're offended. Or if you don't want to answer their shenanigans, they get offended. Or if you just give them the word of God, they get offended. They just end up murmuring and complaining and feeling justified that it's okay to be offended. you know, they they actually feel it's okay that I'm offended because they feel justified because they didn't like what you said. A wicked hour. We're living in I believe we ought to be living in an hour where we Great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing shall offend them. &gt;&gt; Fall in love with the word of God. That's the answer. Verse 62. What and if you shall see the Son of Man ascending up where he was before, it is the spirit that quickenth, the flesh profitth nothing. The words, now notice this, the words, the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life. In other words, pay attention to the words of God. &gt;&gt; My words will fail. My words may be confusion, but God's word, if you don't even understand it, &gt;&gt; it is the word of life. &gt;&gt; But there are some of you, he said, that don't believe my words. But Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not, who that should betray him. who would remain humble and believe to the end and who would rise up with pride and and hurt a and just quit. God knows who's who. &gt;&gt; We don't know who's who. But as we go through life, we find out who's who, right? By their fruit, you shall know them. And in time, you see who's who. But God knows the intent, right, of the man's of man's heart. We have no right to judge a man's heart, but we have every right because Jesus gave us the right to to to look at somebody else's fruit, &gt;&gt; and you shall know them by their fruits. All right. Verse 65. And he said, "Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me except it were given of my father." And from that time many of his disciples went back and they walked no more with him. They made a decision. They They're not walking anymore with Jesus. Now, here are the 70 that were appointed. Here are the ones that had um they were rejoicing that they had power to cast out devils and and to heal all manners of diseases. And they saw these miracles happen. And they came a little further down in the ministry. They went to church some Wednesday night and they heard something that was too strong for them. H they rejoiced because they had power over the devils. But they didn't realize it that eventually the devil had power over them. &gt;&gt; And he got them to disbelieve the word of God. &gt;&gt; And by that they said, "No, we're going to stop going to church. &gt;&gt; Not going to walk with him anymore. I'm going to find something different that is not such a hard saying. That's nothing but the devil. That is nothing but the devil. God never wants us to quit. &gt;&gt; You can't find any scripture the you find the opposite. If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed. You find just the opposite. God is one. God is building a building. He's building a church. He's building his character inside his people. And he doesn't stop. He's moving forward. But you know, the children of Israel, they left God while they were still in church, &gt;&gt; right? Their heart was back in Egypt. They went to church. They were led by the pillar of fire, the cloud by day, the fire by night. And their shoes didn't wear out. They had blue cross, blue shield, but in their heart they went back to Egypt. Now, can you imagine God's going to say, "Yeah, I want you to be in heaven with me." You understand what I'm trying to say? God has friends and then he has those who call God a friend. But you know, Brother Brandham said it like this. When you say you believe, that's you accepting Christ. But it isn't until God gives you the Holy Ghost that he accepts you. &gt;&gt; So, you know, we can call God our friend, but I want to hear God call me his friend. &gt;&gt; And he told me what I need to do to be that friend to do whatsoever he tells me to do. &gt;&gt; That makes a friendship with Jesus. beautiful friendship. Jesus knew from the beginning who was going to be sold out, go all the way, and who was going to just, you know what? I'm only going to go so far and quit. In verse 67, Jesus turned to the 12 of his disciples. And he says these words, "Will you go away? Will you also go away? Are you going to follow suit?" And they didn't say, "Oh, we that wasn't a hard saying. We understand it." They didn't say that. &gt;&gt; You don't have to understand the word of God. You just need to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You just need to hold to it. &gt;&gt; Hold to God's unchanging hand. We're living in a userfriendly hour where people are so easily they just want to use you &gt;&gt; without any embarrassment for loaves, for fishes, for healings, &gt;&gt; for whatever they can get out of you. It's a user friendly hour. They they don't even care if you know that you're being used. &gt;&gt; Will you also go away? And Simon Peter answered,"Lord, if that would be the case, what ministry is like this ministry? To whom shall we go? &gt;&gt; Thou has the words of eternal life." &gt;&gt; You know, my word can't get you. My word can't even hardly get you to my house. I'll probably tell you the wrong way how to get there. You ever pass your driveway? I have. Man, &gt;&gt; I think I live there. I think I just passed it. &gt;&gt; But God's word will get you to heaven. &gt;&gt; Surely it'll get you there. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And we believe and are sure that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." Who are they that going to walk away? Those who really don't believe God's word to be the truth. That means we could sit in church for years, say amen to the word, but in our our heart not even be there. &gt;&gt; You know, going to church don't get us to heaven. Jesus answered them, "Have not I chosen you 12, and one of you is a devil?" This sounds like a paradox, doesn't it? And he spake of Judas as Scariot the son of Simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the 12. To think that Jesus himself chose a devil to be a disciple &gt;&gt; in the church. It's amazing how God is not a respector of persons. &gt;&gt; Choosing a devil and make him a treasure of the church. For he maketh the sun to rise on the evil and the good, and he sendeth rain upon the just. And that is the God that we serve. &gt;&gt; We serve a beautiful God. &gt;&gt; An amazing God. &gt;&gt; How could we ever think that God don't ever care about us? &gt;&gt; God cares. He loves us. God knows that every seed brings forth of its kind. It's his law. And it doesn't matter if you walk next to Jesus in the ministry like Judas did. You were taught the perfect doctrine by the greatest minister who Jesus was. It doesn't matter how many miracles you witness like Judas did. It doesn't matter if Jesus gives you power over unclean spirits to cast them out to heal all manner of sicknesses and all manner of diseases. No matter how much time you spend uh with no matter how much time the son of pition spends with the son of god it can never convert him. &gt;&gt; Have not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil? Now he may have started going in the right direction but he ended up becoming a devil just like his father Lucifer who was made perfect at the beginning no flaws led the the worship and he was just perfect he was a bright angel still is a bright angel very beautiful his ma his name may have been in the book of light but it was taken God knows that no matter how much time you spend with somebody, the seed of God can never convert a seed of a devil. &gt;&gt; Brother Random said there's nothing there to quicken. Remember that there's nothing there to quicken. There's no way. Okay, let's say you went to the store, Brother James, and you got the tomatoes and the apples, but you forgot the bananas when you got home. Mom was not happy. So, you go in that bedroom where God has answered prayer. You say, "God, I really want one of these tomatoes to become a banana. Now, God can create, but every seed has to come forth of its kind. You can you can go ahead and plant those tomatoes, but you're not going to get bananas. You're not going to get a banana tree. So, it doesn't matter how much time we try to spend with somebody. If they don't get converted, it doesn't mean you didn't do your job. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every seed brings forth of its own kind. &gt;&gt; Now, Ephesians 2, we often look at this. Where in times past, verse two, where in times past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works, where is it working? In children who are disobeying, among whom also we were all there at one time. We all had our conversation just like they did in the lust of the flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath. In other words, if you didn't get what you want, you sure let mom and dad know about it. You let your brothers and sisters, you let the people at school know about it. You let them know where you stood when you didn't get what you want. Children of wrath, even as others. We were all there. But God who is rich in mercy for his great love where he loved us even when we were dead in sins have quickened us together with Christ. &gt;&gt; There was something inside of us that could be quickened. &gt;&gt; You may be the only one in your family that's going. There has to be something inside of you that can be quickened to make alive. That can be converted from the old sinful nature to the lovely, beautiful, peaceful, lovely nature of Jesus Christ. Now, these scriptures are only referring to the true seed of God. They're not referring to if you're a a seed of Satan that that you you can just, you know, become a seed of God. You just can't. It would break the law of God. These are referring to those who were born. They're all We're all born in sin, shape, and iniquity. &gt;&gt; Uh I don't care for a seed of Satan or a seat in God. Seed of God. We're all born in sin, shape, and iniquity. But there's something inside of the seed of God that can be quickened. &gt;&gt; And what quickens that? The word. The word of God. Not the word of John Martin. Not the word of not the word of a person. &gt;&gt; It's the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's why that word of God can be spoken by a five-year-old and bring life into somebody. &gt;&gt; That's how powerful it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is amazing. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said in the mirror a Samaran church age he says we did not become seed by rebirth. &gt;&gt; We were seed and therefore were b reborn for only the elect can be reborn &gt;&gt; because we were seed is the reason that we could be quickened in nonseed. There is nothing to quicken. &gt;&gt; So they can go to church. They can be part of the 70. They can go to church and and be the treasure of the church. Be chosen. That's powerful. Be chosen. But chosen for a wrong purpose. I mean, look, the God chose the devil to fulfill to bring character, right? to help help bring character in our lives. &gt;&gt; So the 70 walked away from Jesus because they could not take all the word, right? It was a hard saying who could hear it. They did not want to be a friend to all the word of God. Now think about that. They could take some of the word. They could be a friend to part of the word, but they could not be a friend to all the word. &gt;&gt; And there's this this mentality out there, oh yeah, I'm real good friends with Jesus, but I don't even read my Bible. &gt;&gt; I only go to church on the holidays, but yet still claiming to have a friendship. Brother Brandham said, "Though they were disciples, they were unbelievers." &gt;&gt; About these 70. Though they were disciples, they were unbelievers. Why? Because they walked away. When you walk away is the proof of where you stand. That's why we sing songs like, "I'm going through. Though many fall to the side, I am determined. I'm going through. &gt;&gt; First John chapter 2 verse 19. Write this down if you'd like. It's a good scripture. They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us. But they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not of us. So we don't know to the end who's who. &gt;&gt; Now Judas, he actually walked with Jesus a little further than the 70 disciples did. &gt;&gt; He stuck around longer, but he eventually stopped walking with the word, too. Judas decided to cut off his friendship with Jesus for some money with a deceitful kiss. &gt;&gt; Think about it. Judas make believed his friendship with Jesus. He make believed his friendship with Jesus. He was a makeeliever. So his friendship with Jesus was make believe. John 8:31 says, "Then Jesus said to those disciples that believed on him, if you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed, and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." So his this friendship here, you're my friends, and whatsoever the Father has told me, I am telling you, and this what I'm telling you is going to set you free. Don't ask any questions. Just believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you got to continue in the word. You just can't you can't continue to come to church. That don't make you a believer. &gt;&gt; You've actually got to take the word, eat it, become the word, live it. &gt;&gt; That's what that scripture means. &gt;&gt; John 10:8 says, "All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers. They come to steal, to kill, to destroy." There was never a real friendship in tension in their heart. Jesus said, "I come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly." Jesus is the one that's wanting a real friendship with us. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He's the whole world is full of people who fake it. Can you say amen to that statement? &gt;&gt; I mean, you can't hardly go anywhere. The more spiritual you are, the more your eyes are open, the more you can see people are just fake. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I'm not trying to cut down people, but it it's just they just they don't have enough love in their heart to be real. &gt;&gt; And and and you see it. And Jesus said, uh there's people that worship me, they don't even know what they're worshiping. &gt;&gt; And that the father is seeking such that will worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; I believe God is looking for somebody to be a real friend with him. I believe that &gt;&gt; Jesus wants a real friendship. He's looking for those who will stay with him. Stay with the word no matter what happens, no matter how hard it gets, no matter who turns the side, no matter what your friends say, your relatives say, your mom and dad say, your husband and wife says, stay with the word. &gt;&gt; I say that to the elect. Stay with the word. [Applause] It got real tough for Job, didn't it? But he stayed with the word. He kept his integrity. He kept his his he kept his friendship with the word to the point he says these words after all hell broke loose on him. And it was definitely hell broke loose on him. It was Satan himself coming to destroy his life. All hell broke loose. But his testimony was, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust him?" &gt;&gt; He had a real friendship with God. &gt;&gt; He can do what he wants. I'm going to trust him. Sometimes we can't even trust in the smallest little trial that we go through. &gt;&gt; We're whining and crying about it. &gt;&gt; God wants us to trust him. Job was God's friend. His God testified. There's none like him. He's a perfect in in God's sight. Look at the attitude that Job maintained faithfully as a friend of God. He maintained a faithful attitude. He didn't murmur. He didn't complain. He didn't accuse God. I would believe Job could say this. This is a hard saying. This is a hard thing I'm going through. I don't understand it. But he didn't walk away. There was He had the seed of God in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll say what we can gain out of this message today, saints, is we need to learn to take God's word as our best friend. &gt;&gt; This is we don't come to church to find out, you know, if we're going to get pumped up or if we're going to get um a chopped down. That's not what the word's for. I mean, it does tell us where we're at, but we what we do need to do is take the word of God seriously. &gt;&gt; And it it's written in here for our admonition. Job trusted God. He didn't need to ask for prayer all the time. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Job trusted his friend Jesus. There was a real relationship there, a real friendship there. &gt;&gt; Did you know brother Brandon said when we ask for prayer repeatedly, it weakens our faith? What faith we had before we started becomes weaker if we repeatedly ask for prayer. It doesn't strengthen you when you repeatedly ask for prayer. It doesn't even increase the chances that you're going to get your prayer answered. &gt;&gt; It literally weakens our own faith. Now, I know that's a hard one to swallow, but it is. If you ask God, believe that God hears you and walk forward. Now if we want to strengthen our faith, we simply start with praying more ourself personally. &gt;&gt; That's how you do it. You pray more yourself. Isaiah 40:30 tells us tells us this. Even the youth, the youth, this is the young people shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall. But they that wait upon the Lord, they shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagle. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. &gt;&gt; So if you want to build your faith, build your time in prayer alone with God. That's how you get stronger in faith. &gt;&gt; You spend time with God alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't maintain personal prayer with your friend Jesus, you'll end up becoming anemic and depending on others for your personal walk. For your personal walk, I need this person. Now understand in a body ministry and I understand that at from time that we need to have a request go in &gt;&gt; but I'm telling you we need to have more of a personal relationship with God &gt;&gt; to where our dependency is on God and not others &gt;&gt; because God deals with the Gentiles as individuals. What a friend we have in Jesus. All our sins and griefs to bear. What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer. &gt;&gt; Oh, what peace we often forfeit. Oh, what needless pain we bear all because we do not carry everything to God in prayer. &gt;&gt; So, the first thing we need to do is humble ourselves and pray more. And strength will come through prayer. For what? To do the second thing we got to do. And what is that? Receive the word unto obedience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, do whatever God tells you to do. &gt;&gt; Because it's through that obedience that you get what you want. Because that's the reason God sent the trial. God set the trial to get the thing in motion to get you to a place to communicate with him as your friend. So you obey what he wants you to do so you get the character that you need. Okay. Now, now we can answer prayer. That's why we're supposed to count it all joy when we fall into diverse temptations, all sorts of trials. Receive the word onto obedience. &gt;&gt; You can't just say, "Oh yeah, I said amen to the word. and don't obey it. &gt;&gt; You've got to obey it. We're going to get into some examples of that. Uh hopefully we can get to that later today. That means the more you say amen, the quicker we can go. &gt;&gt; And the and then and the the less amens then you we're going to have you'll have to bring the food in here. And all right. Romans 10:16 says Romans 10:16, but they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah saith, who have believed our report, so they heard, but they don't believe it. So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. So that's why the the writer in the book of Hebrews said, "Therefore, we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we let them slip." He went on to say in chapter 4, "Let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them." But the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. So God is always putting us to the test. Are you going to trust me? If if if I could do what I did to Job and he still be faithful, I'm sure that we can go through the test that we go through, which is nothing like Job, and say, "God, I'm going to trust you through this." &gt;&gt; I believe that. Hebrews 3:5, if you pull that up here, Hebrews chapter 3 verse 5 says, "And Moses verilely was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken afterwards." Faithfulness, did you know, is a testimony? Faithfulness is a testimony to me. Without faithfulness, you can't build a thing. &gt;&gt; You can't build a business. &gt;&gt; You can't you can't teach a person how to do their job. &gt;&gt; You can't get bills paid. You can't even have a decent relationship. &gt;&gt; Faithfulness is the very foundation. We don't have that in here, but we uh used to have the the pyramid and faith is at the bottom. And you've got to be faithful. That is the most important thing for a Christian's life is to be faithful. Look at verse six. But Christ over his own house. So he's faithful over his own house. Right? Because Moses was faithful over his house for a testimony of the things which was spoken afterwards, which is Jesus Christ in Christ as a son over his own house. whose house we are. So God is faithful in our house if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of hope firm to the end. Christ is faithful. &gt;&gt; Great is thy faithfulness. &gt;&gt; God is faithful through our trials. The Bible says there is no temptation that have taken you but what is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but with the temptation make a way of escape that you may be able to bear. So why would we complain? Why would we mur? Why would we just frantic and get all upset about something? God didn't put anything on you that you couldn't bear. &gt;&gt; Why you acting like that? God ain't a liar. Don't call God a liar. Sometimes we just you don't want to say this is different, brother John. It's not different. It just God's has confidence in us. God wants to see us trust him through our trials. But Christ as a son over his own house if we hold our confidence in our friend Jesus firm to the end that he's faithful to the end that we got to rejoice in our hope to the end. Not just say well you know I'm going through a real hard trial right now. I'm just going to kind of you know sit back and you know I'm just going to kind of wait and see how things go. I'm going to I'm going to try to be neutral. I'm just going to try to, you know, I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of figure out which way. &gt;&gt; This is the way. Walking in it. &gt;&gt; I am the way, the truth, and the life. &gt;&gt; We should take sides with the word. &gt;&gt; Become a friend to the word. How can we be a friend to Jesus if we're not a friend to his word? &gt;&gt; It's dropped down to verse 14. For we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end. We are made partakers of an eternal friendship. Think about that. If we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end. In other words, God is going to try you. So don't think it's strange the fiery trials which are to try you. Jesus, he's a friend that stickketh closer than a brother. But he is a brother for whom he did forno. He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Because Christ died for us, our nature can be changed and we become just like Jesus in the image of God. And the Bible says that he's not ashamed to call me and you his brother. He's not ashamed anymore. Now brothers will talk about you. They will despise you. They will use you. They will walk all over you. They will walk away from you. But Jesus is a friend that's sticker closer than a brother. A lot of people claim Jesus as their friend. In fact, many will come to me in that day and say, "Lord, Lord, I thought we were friends. Are we not? What's going on? What what what's happening here?" Matthew 7 21, not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. Not everyone that says, I'm your friend, but he that what? Doeth the will of my father which is in heaven. The same thing that Jesus said in the opening scripture. You are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you. Many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied and cast out devils and did many wonderful works? You look at the 70. Look at the 70. Look at Judas. They were all in that group. And then I will profess unto them, I never knew you. Depart from me, you that work in iniquity. We didn't even have a friendship. That's what Jesus is saying. You thought we were friends because I allowed you to do this. But your heart was far from me. You did not continue to do the things that you know you should be doing. Praying, reading, coming to church, doing the things that God has already spoke to you. Now Jesus said, "All that the Father has given me, I have given to you and I've chosen you for friendship if you do whatsoever I command you." So as I'm telling you these things, you've got to do them. It's not just, you know, God said a prophet, you're in. It's about obeying what the word that God gave us through that prophet. make sure that our life is lining up. We can't be a disciple of Christ if we don't continue on in the word. We got to hold that confidence steadfast to the end. We must abide in God's word in order to maintain a friendship status with God. You can read all about it in in in in chapter 15 if you want of of St. John. It's not just a knowledge of the word because the devils believe and they tremble. They don't abide in the word. They just know the word. There's a difference. The Bible says the angels which kept not their first estate, but they left their own habitation has reserved into everlasting chains under darkness unto judgment of that great day. So the angels were there once in church. They knew the word of God. They still know it today. They did not forget it. The devils have not forgotten how things were in heaven. &gt;&gt; They know. That's why they can come down here in church and mimic themselves in a religious manner, &gt;&gt; trying to get the attention, trying to act like something. Jesus said, "Abide in me. Abide in my word. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit of the living word, he taketh it away. He says, "Now you're clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me." You cannot bear fruit of the living word of God without living without the living word inside of you. But brother Ram talked about you can go to a a seminary, spend five years learning all about God and be further away from God when you came out than when you went in. &gt;&gt; But if you get on your knees long enough into the presence of God comes, you can learn more about God in five minutes than you could ever in those five years. Because there's a difference between God revealing himself and you trying to figure out God, which he's already hid it from the wise and prudent. That's why there's so many churches out there baptizing the wrong way. It's because they received the word of God through a man and they didn't stay on their knees long enough until they heard from God. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; We're a blessed people. &gt;&gt; You are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you. Where does it put those who do not put forth the attitude to do the things that God wants them to do? Where does that put them? You're my friends if you do whatsoever I command you. What happens to those who are don't want to put forth that effort, who don't have an attitude, who have not like make it a decision that I'm going to really put God in my life? Does anybody want to know? Uh I'm going to start all over if you don't get involved here. 1 Peter chapter 4:1 17 says, "For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God. And if it first begin at us, what shall the end of them that obey not the gospel of God? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? They're definitely not going to be friends with God, right? No wonder Paul told the Philippian church to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which workketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. So as God speaks to you and he's working in your heart and you have this little feeling inside, you know what, I haven't been obeying but I need to obey that. That's God working in you. He's working inside of you to do what he wants you to do. Do all those things without murmuring and disputings. Why? That you may be blameless. And look at this. Harmless. You won't hurt anybody that you may be blameless and harmless. The sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world. Yeah. The whole world out there fighting, but you don't fight. The whole world is out there harming one another, but you don't because you hold God inside of you. holding forth, look at this verse 16, holding forth the word of life, that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain. You are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant doesn't know what his Lord's doing. But I've called you friends. For all things that I've heard of my father, I've made known done unto you. Now, just just being honest. When somebody's talking to you and they say, "I want to tell you something, but you know, nobody knows this. This is this is this is just, you know, between me and you." And we've all had that experience before, right? We know what that's like, right? And when they go to tell you, don't you feel special? Like, wow, it's just me telling me, but nobody else knows. You have that special feeling. Well, here Jesus tells his friends what his father's told him, but he hasn't told anybody else. He says, "How are you going to manifest yourself to us and not to the world? What you you're going to love me. You're going to keep my commandments. I'm going to come in you. I'm going to reveal myself to you. And God, my sheep hear my voice and they follow me. And those that are not sheep don't follow. I don't know what else to say. You know, the whole Satan comes to church and he preaches the gospel. You're the sheep of God, but you don't have to follow. That's that's his gospel. You believe that you're sheep even though you don't follow. &gt;&gt; But that's not scriptural. So, I want to read this. This is real important. John chapter 17 verse 6. St. John chapter 17 verse number 6 Jesus says I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest on to me out of the world. Thine they were and that thou gavest me and they have kept thy word. Now did Judas keep the word? No. But his disciples did. He's he's not praying for Judas here. You understand? He's just praying for the 11 right now. But he's also praying for you and I in this prayer. But here's the difference. They kept the word. They kept the word. And a real real honest, we just got to be honest with ourselves. Are we keeping the word? &gt;&gt; Are we just keeping part of the word or we keeping all the word? Are we keeping part of our friendship? Because if we keep part of our friendship, God looks at us as a thief and a robber. You just want my eternal life, but you don't want to do what I ask you to do. &gt;&gt; Verse eight. For I have given unto them the words, the words which thou gavest me. I've given it to them, and they have received the words, and have known surely that I came from thee, and they have believed that thou didest send me. You are my friends, if you do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant doesn't know what his lord's doing. But I've called you friends. For all things that I have heard of my father, I have made known unto you. What a privilege it is that God would share his heart with us. &gt;&gt; We are a blessed people. I remember when I was lost in the world, I didn't I had no idea where to even go to hear the truth. I went from church to church to church to church, church in my bedroom crying, "Lord, I don't care what church you want me to go to. Just send me to the one that has the truth." &gt;&gt; Because that was the only one I knew God was in. You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free. A church can't make you free. A person can't make you free. It's God working through that person to set you free. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I know time is up, but can you just give me just a few more minutes? Just a few. I think this would be a blessing. All right. Now, the book of Romans, chapter 5, teaches us that we are justified by faith. By just believing, we're justified. I'll quote it. Romans 5:1. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. when you accept the blood of Jesus Christ and you you trust God that he'll give you you get you just automatically get peace when you become justified. You know your sins have been taken away just as if you never did it. That's what the real peace of God is. Now James was talking about this same justification uh and he said our our justification starts out with faith but faith must continue to manifest works. &gt;&gt; Are you with me so far? &gt;&gt; So he wasn't really um talking about something different. It was the same justification, but it starts out with faith. But God has this expectation that you got to start working out what you believe. You can't just sit there and say, "I believe &gt;&gt; because the devils do that." And they're not justified. So James chap 2 21 says, "Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son upon the altar?" So remember God, it was imputed unto him for righteousness prior to that. But it wasn't until he took his son up on the the the mountain and he was getting ready to offer him these works. Okay, God, if you this is what you want me to do, I'm going to do it. And then God stayed his hand and said, "Now I know that you love me. Now I know." And it was through that process that God that that James is saying that's what justified him. Now I know it's it's done. And in verse 22, seeest thou how faith wrought his works. It faith brought his works into full justification, and that by works was faith made perfect. Now, I know the scripture talks about that we can never be justified by works. Because you can't do work without believing. You can't burn candles. You can't do this. You can't do all these things and say, "I'm justified because I did it." Because like Martin Luther said, you know, the just shall live by faith. But the thing is, if you truly believe, then you'll have a life behind it. You'll have works to follow it. And if God asks you to do something, you're just going to do it. Verse 23. And the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness, and he was called what? the friend of God. That's why I wanted to read this. Abraham, a friend of God, because he continued to obey the word of God. He didn't just sit there and say, "I believe I'm not going to do anything." He held his faith for 25 years. Praise God. You talk about somebody that you think he had something to complain about like like uh maybe Job, but I don't know how long Job's trial was, but Abraham, he's the father of our faith. I think Job didn't even have Abraham to to read at that time. If I understand that correctly, we're blessed. &gt;&gt; The father of our faith was a friend of God. And if we walk in the steps of our father Abraham, we too can become the friend that Abraham was to God. &gt;&gt; I want to be called, honestly, I want to be called a friend of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now God said, "I can't keep my secrets from Abraham." Because seeing he is the heir of the earth. Remember remember God could not keep his secret from Abraham. God would do nothing except he revealed his secrets to his servants, the prophets. Abraham walked in obedience. God had this relationship that everything that the father has uh uh that that the father knew, he told Abraham. He kept no secrets. Here's the thing I want to say. God doesn't keep secrets from his bride. We just got to get in the position that we get more serious with God. If we want to know God, God wants to reveal himself. Okay. Verse 24. Three more verses and we're done. Seeing you see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only. Like likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works when she received the messengers and had sent them out the other way. Remember Rahab believed. She believed but she wasn't justified through her belief. She actually had to start obeying the word. For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand together. I want to I want to be counted worthy to escape this world, this world of unbelief and be called God's friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that little chorus. Let go and let God have his wonderful way. Let go and let God have his wonderful way. Let go and let God have his way. [Applause] Your sorrows will vanish. Your night turn to day. Let go and let God have his way. Let go and let God have his wonderful way. Let go and let God have his way. Your sorrows will vanish. Your night turn to day. Let go and let God have his way. Let go and let God have his wonderful way. Let go and let God have his way. Your sorrows will vanish. Your night turn today. Let go and let God have his
