to take us through i like something i never heard before of course there was a number of things that would say yes i didn't hear before but one thing was faith came before feelings and that puts our

and a privilege to be here with you once again and we pray something we said last night to bless you and to help you and to encourage you and i'll tell you i sit back there the back room and brother john mentioned that faith cometh before feelings and i took my notepad out and wrote that down and i realized i said that last night but it just came fresh inspiration from the lord last night and amen i know the word never said did you feel it the word said did you believe it amen and if you can believe then all things are possible to them that believe how many believers do we have here this morning amen all things are possible amen god bless you if you have your bibles while you're standing with us today we'll invite you to the book of matthew the 16th chapter the book of matthew the 16th chapter again we want to say we appreciate the invitation to come and the opportunity to minister to you this weekend and sure appreciate brother john and appreciate his spirit and his love for the lord and the people of god here in the church and i was just telling him last night the lord has blessed you all with a beautiful building i can tell you put a lot of work into it and just a beautiful sanctuary and place the lord has given you and amen i pray the lord give you many souls amen for your labor amen god bless you this morning good to have brother seth with us again we want to say appreciate him for coming with us and appreciate his testimony for the lord and we just want to look here in the book of matthew if we can the 16th chapter i know it's a very familiar reading matthew 16 and verse 13 and just before we wreak we just bow our heads together for word of prayer let's speak to the author of the word heavenly father lord your word is true this morning and father we are believers in your word lord we know that your word will defeat the devil anywhere any place anytime under any conditions lord this morning it's cold on the outside but father lord there's a warmth of the presence of god in this building today now father i ask you to come may you take control of my voice may you take control of my thoughts lord may you not only anoint me to speak father but lord may you anoint your children to pull and to receive also from the gift lord lord may you heal our sick today god may you save our lost father may you feel with your holy spirit may you bind the hand of satan this morning father may revelation come up out of your word into the hearts and lives of your children lord lord may vessels that are empty be filled today dear god lord may we be made meat for your service lord may we be changed by your presence may you bless this assembly father lord may you come in the power of your resurrection today god open the eyes of our understanding lord and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for to the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers says amen and amen matthew 16 and verse number 13 the bible here says when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said unto him some say thou art john the baptist and some elias and sothers jeremias were one of the prophets now he was not looking for a universal understanding he was looking for an individual confession he said some say thou are alas some say jeremiah is from the prophets but he said unto them whom say ye that i am. and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it said that's a paradox he said that the gates of hell would be against the church but they would not prevail over the church i love verse 19 and i will give unto thee the keys to the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ amen we asked the lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this morning from those passages of scripture for just a few moments if the lord would help us today i want to speak to you if i titled this sermon today i want to speak to you on the keys to the kingdom the keys to the kingdom i was recently studying the book of john the third chapter which we all know that verse 16 that god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever should believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life and i found that jesus christ was god's gift to the world if you could recognize amen that christ is the gift to the world then you'll recognize that there's other gifts that christ has given the church that are part of himself like in matthew 11 he'll say i give unto thee arrest in matthew 16 hear he's speaking i will give unto thee the keys and i just want this morning to minister to you on the keys to the kingdom of heaven we realize that the bible will speak of the word key or the word keys about eight times you'll hear it said like this the key of david the key of knowledge the key to the bottomless pit he'll speak of the keys to the kingdom of heaven then you'll read about uh the keys of hell and death now when you hear this word key you automatically think what is the purpose of a key the prophet problem god says in the key to the door he says a purpose of a key is to unlock something it's something that's been locked up or it's something that should be locked up he said now there are there are many kinds of keys because we have many uses of keys there's a key to your storehouse there's a key to your own house there's a key to your automobile he said and we call them keys amen because they are keys there's a key to your house key to your storehouse key to your automobile there's all different kinds of keys and we call them keys because they are keys now we realize that there are many kinds of keys and there are skeleton keys they meant off of the original key but the prophet of god said that god amen has no skeleton key so a denominational key will not unlock the revelation of the word to the believer in the book of deuteronomy the 16th chapter in the sixth verse at the place which the lord god shall choose to place his name in there thou shalt sacrifice amen the passover evening at the going down of the sun at the season that thou came us forth out of egypt now i read this verse last night but i want to pull apart out of this at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name in so you're not going to choose amen the place that god is going to place his name rather he's going to choose that place if you'll just watch he says and follow god's direction there's only one key to each door there's only one key to each door and no other key no matter how much it looks like it god has no skeleton key he's just got one key now you've got to have that key or the door won't unlock no matter how sincere you are you still can't unlock that door so here we're going to turn a corner and recognize amen that sincerity is not the key amen you can be very sincere amen but sincerity will not unlock the door he said david was anointed king anointed of god the greatest king israel ever had outside of the lord jesus which is god the anointed one jesus was david's son according to the lineage the flesh and he is to set on david's throne as one the prince always inherits the king's throne now notice that david being anointed yet with the anointing he did he got out of the will of the lord think about this david is anointed he's sincere yet he got out of the will of the lord and all the people amen not taking the run of the scripture or the key to this revelation all them anointed too they all got together shouting and praising god for the thing looked exactly right to bring the word of god back to the house of god but david was king not prophet see there was a prophet in the land to do it by and god dishonored the whole move because they never used the right key amen they were shouting they were rejoicing they were praising god they were sincere they had all the right intentions they had all the right motives they were trying to bring the word of god he went back to the house of god they were doing everything right except they bypassed they meant god's predestinated channel to bring the word by and that was a prophet and because they did that god dishonored the whole move amen because they did not use the right key he said see watch they didn't the door didn't unlock now we must remember that and keep that in mind every one of everything of god one certain way it's to be done and remember that amen that settles it god has one certain church that he meets the people in he will receive you in that church and no other church he said i've used this because many times i've been misunderstood people's told me are you a christian they'll say well i'm baptist are you a christian i'm a methodist they still say the same thing today amen are you a christian i'm a pentecostal he's been now see that doesn't mean one thing to god you're just broken with the wrong key amen so the name methodist is not the key the name baptist is not the key amen the name pentecostal is not the key amen the name of the lord jesus christ is the key he meant that there is a right key and god never promised to meet you as a baptist or a methodist or a pentecostal or no other denomination he don't even consider the denomination amen because they are against him he's been think about this then in matthew 16 19 when jesus would say i will give unto thee the keys to the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven now this word key amen actually means he meant a king and since the keeper amen of the key has the power to open and shut think about this the keeper of the key has the power to open and the power to shut the word cleos there is figuratively used in the new testament he meant to denote power and authority of various kinds how many knows the prophet of god said we do not have the power amen we have the authority christ has the power amen see then christ has the power we have the authority amen to operate the power that christ has given us amen i find it a powerful quote in the message who is god he said joshua stop the son is that true and somebody said all things are possible with god nothing is impossible but all things are possible to you also amen so all things are not just possible to god or to the prophet or to the preacher amen but all things are possible to you also amen nothing is impossible to them that believe all things are possible brought right down and made you if you just know who god was so if you recognize who god was you'll realize who you are amen if you see who god he is you'll see who you are he said i'm afraid the church doesn't know the authority amen the authority i'm afraid the holy ghost born men amen don't realize their authority or the authority that god has permitted to his church i'll give unto you the keys of the kingdom whatever you find on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you loose shall be loosed i will give you power over serpents over serpents i'll give you power over diseases and nothing shall harm you he says see exercise your faith let it loose amen i think it's time the church let our faith loose amen let god have his way and god will grant it to you if you will release your faith and god will release his desires and you amen if you will recognize his presence amen when you recognize his presence the prophet said you release his power do you realize the presence of god could be in this service this morning but if you don't recognize him amen then you'll leave here the way you came amen but if you recognize that he's the mighty god if you recognize that he has come down in this generation amen to make good every promise that he's made you then by your recognition you will release his power to fulfill your desires now let's just go the word you want to amen is that okay well can we go to the word amen let's go the word the bible says amen that there was a woman who made her way into the house of simon he met and there was jesus sitting in the corner right with dirty feet nobody had washed his feet nobody entertained him nobody had seen about him amen and brother said she walked in the house he said and there he sat with dirty feet he said and she recognized that that was jesus of nazareth she recognized that that was a man that could save her soul she recognized that was a man that could change her life and the prophet said she went over and she began to wash his feet he said now think about this she was washing his feet and there was religious people there amen that knew all the scriptures they knew all the cliches they knew everything about messiah amen and there he was in their midst and they failed oh god they failed to recognize who he was he said and they left in the same condition he said but one woman recognized that that's the one that the woman that was caught in the very act of adultery was stoned at his feet amen and he forgive our sins and he set her free oh friends this morning that same god is in the church he's in the building this morning he's here to manifest and make good his promises if we can only exercise our faith and recognize we have the authority by the word amen i find it amazing in the philadelphia in church age revelation 3 verse 8 he says i know thy works amen behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word thou hast a little strength and has kept my word i love this last part and has not denied my name amen can we say that together and has not denied my name amen the prophet said see he has got the keys to david now he can keep his word and put you into the kingdom he meant he his name had been revealed he meant they got out of the church that had a name that they were dead and now they got into a church that's got the name amen that is got life so when you get the name amen you get the life if there's no name there's no life amen but if there's a name then there's a life he said see they came out of the dead father son holy spirit amen name the father son holy spirit that don't even make sense see it's give therefore a revelation so matthew 28 19 amen was placed in the bible go ye in all the world baptize in the name of father son holy ghost the prophet says that was placed there for a revelation then where was the revelation coming of matthew 28 19 it will be found in acts 2 38 amen see his whole book is wrote on revelation that's what it is he reveals himself he said now go baptize the people in the name of the father son holy ghost amen matthew 28 19 now one of them names you're going to use which one are you going to use he said most of trinitarian people baptize the name of the father in the name of the son name of the holy ghost that's not even scriptural ask anybody it's in the name singular not names plural amen the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost all right father is not a name son is not a name amen holy ghost is not a name so what is it it's something that is dead come on now amen the name father is something that is dead he said see there's no name to it amen through those dead titles amen then that's why the churches are dead that's why they don't have a move of god that's why there's no power to cast out devils there's no power to heal the sick there's no power to raise the dead it's because they're under dead titles that has no authority or power listen friends you can say father all day long and the devil will stay right there you can say son all day long and the devil will stay right there but let a believer break out in the faith of jesus christ and breathe the name of jesus one time and every devil will begin to shake every demon will begin to back up come on friends we're not here under a bunch of dead titles we are the fully restored sons and daughters of god that believe in the name of the lord jesus christ i tell you what it's time to do it's time to speak the name it's time to speak the name of jesus it's time to breathe the name of jesus it's time to lift up the name of jesus we've lifted up every other name don't you think it's time to lift up the name that all power in heaven and earth amen has been poured into that name it's the name of the lord jesus christ i'm not talking about dead titles i'm talking about a living name amen the prophet god said like this you say well let me back up for a second and say well brother andrew i'm okay i've been baptized father son holy ghost well let me tell you what the prophet said he said thus saith the lord the baptism using the title of father son holy ghost is false well we might as well preach this morning we got up out of bed and got dressed and cleaned cleaned our faces off and combed our hair and come church we might as well preach that we ain't been thus saith the lord the baptism amen father son holy ghost is false thus saith the lord i command every one of you here and on tape that hasn't been baptized in the name of jesus christ be baptized again in the name of jesus christ even see if you want the life of christ it's going to come by the name of christ amen the bible says see the life of christ is revealed through the name amen i want you to catch something because it's been a debate for years on should we baptize according to matthew 28 19 shall we baptize acts 2 3 how shall we baptize but let's go back to a man who was there at both times is that okay he says by the life of christ he reveals and peter was standing right there with the keys of the kingdom of heaven in his hand and the kingdom is the holy ghost the kingdom is the holy ghost he said hanging on his side the keys the kingdom in other words the revelation because jesus told him peter was the one that was blessed with the revelation now i want you to catch this how many knows matthew 28 19. you know that verse do you realize that peter was standing right there and heard jesus say those words brother said peter was right there and heard jesus say he was the man standing there heard jesus say go ye therefore teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father son and the holy ghost now i want you to get something peter standing right there heard jesus say that and turned around and said lord i got the keys here i got the revelation that that meant because i know father's no name and son has no name and the holy ghost just no name i know what the name is so i baptize you in the name of jesus christ amen that's right so think about this peter standing there amen people say well are you going to stand with jesus in matthew 28 or are you going to stand with peter in acts 2. how can you separate the two event when peter was standing there and heard jesus say father son holy ghost but by the spirit of revelation he received the name amen that it was jesus christ and he went and baptized him he went baptized him in the name of jesus christ which was to fulfill the words of acts 15 14 amen that god would visit the gentiles amen to take out of them a people for his name amen not for his title amen before his name the prophet said for in his name of the gentiles trust amen see the gentiles will trust in his name in other words the bride the called out ones amen called out of the gentiles will be trusting in the name of jesus christ in his name shall the gentiles trust amen i don't know about you this morning but i'm thankful for the name i'm thankful for the name of the lord jesus christ i am proud to be called by the name of jesus christ i'm proud to be identified amen by the name of jesus christ amen then whatever i do i do not do it in a title i do it in the name according to paul whatsoever you do in word or indeed do it all in the name of the lord jesus amen giving thanks to god and the father by him if we pray we got to pray in the name of jesus if we petition we're going to ask in the name of jesus if we walk we're going to walk in the name of jesus if we talk we talk in jesus name if we baptize we baptize in the name of jesus christ for all that we do in word or deed do it in the name of jesus christ then to think this morning amended denomination lost the authority of the name but god would send a prophet in the last days according to revelation 10 7 who would say in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound amen the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets the bible says it like this the minister mystery of god should be finished let me say that with me the mystery of god should be finished and this is the sign of the end sir the seventh angel here is sending forth this message to the laodicean church notice his type of message it wasn't to the first angel it wasn't given to the second third fourth fifth or sixth but the seventh angel had this type of message what is it amen finishing all the mysteries of god that was written in the book the seventh angel is winding up all the mysteries that's been laying loosened and offered organization and denomination the seventh angel gathers them finishes up the entire mystery that's what the bible said he will finish the mystery of the written book so the seventh angel's message will tie together all the lucians and they will release the faith in the church now what does matthew 13 11 say it says because it is given unto you which he was speaking to his disciples he meant to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given how many is familiar with the tape called sirs is this the sign of the end 1962 brotherhood come the end of this minute or the end of the end of a second pull ministry and he's fixing to turn to a third pool and he preaches a message called sirs is this the sign of the ian and in there he's going to say these words a mystery is a scripture which is a previously hidden truth but is now divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation now brother sister that's a mouthful amen a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation the greater mysteries and the greater mysteries are now so a prophet is showing you that the revelation does not remove the supernatural amen the revelation does not does not diminish the supernatural amen the supernatural remains despite the revelation in that message he's going to list several mysteries she'll list the mystery of the translation the mystery of the godhead but there's one mystery he pulls out he says the mystery of water baptism where the extreme trinitarianism has brought forth into titles of father son holy ghost he says and the mystery of the godhead being fulfilled in the baptism of the name of jesus christ brother that's another mouthful that the mystery of god is fulfilled in the name of jesus christ according to the book of the revelation that the church is to receive in this time so in other words according to the word the church is to receive a revelation in the hour we're living in which will be the time together of the loose sins of the scripture which will be the releasing of the faith for a rapture come on friends we have not come here to drive down our stakes and repealed alive and we ought to see you we have come here to let the devil know we are pilgrims and strangers we're passing through we've got a future home to possess we've got a body change to take we've got a rapture to go into we've got a marriage supper the lamb to protect us we've got streets of gold to walk uphold we've got walls of jasper to behold we've got gates of pearl to walk through i'm on church we have not come here to receive something to sustain us and to get us in laodicea we've come to receive something to take us out of laodicea and god has sent a message and then through the name of jesus christ to restore the authority to his church oh my people say well amen i'll tell you this much water baptism is some simple little doctrine amen we move on to something else well that may be okay if you don't want to really know who you are amen but if you really recognize who you are you'll see that water baptism it's not some little little doctrine that you get when you first got saved and move on to something else amen i'll tell you how important it is amen for paul would say that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that you may know what is the hope of this calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance he is in the saints now how many knows there's a book called the church age book amen and i know a lot of people say well it's great let me say it this way it's the truth brother man wrote the church age but let's let's knock that devil out here it's his book amen in there he'll open up in the introduction and say through this volume will concern itself with various major doctrines such as the godhead and water baptism now right there knocks the idea out that water baptism is some little doctrine somewhere amen it will contain itself with various major doctrines amen the godhead and water baptism found in revelation chapter one through three its main theme is the setting fourth of a detailed study of the seven church ages now this is necessary in order to understand the rest of the revelation for out of the ages come the seals out of the seals come the trumpets out of the trumpets come the vows like the first burst of a roman candle the church age comes forth with a mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further line but once the brilliance of the seven church ages is given by divine revelation somebody say divine revelation by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of this revelation opens wide before our wondering eyes and we are edified and purified by its spirit and are made ready for his glorious appearance even our lord and savior the one true god amen jesus christ then whatever is breaking forth out of this word is not coming by divine education it is coming by divine revelation and he says it will be light upon light upon light that will move our wondering eyes to a stability and will be edified and purified by the revelation that we're receiving which will lift us into a sphere for rapture oh glory to god come on church amen we have not received a religious education we have received revelation that has come straight from god himself and the age that we're living in i said like this there is a gross error today amen that there are three gods let me let me let me put my voice with the voice of the word and say there are no such things hear o israel the lord our god is one lord the prophet said the spirit of god and john expresses their sleep in order to set forth the supreme deity of jesus christ amen to reveal the godhead as one god today there is a gross error it is that there are three gods instead of one but this revelation is i hope it's okay as given to john by jesus himself corrects that heir it is not that there are three gods but there is one god with three offices so you're not dismissing father son holy ghost you're receiving the revelation that those are three offices of one person and his name is the lord jesus christ amen there is one god with three titles he is a father he is a son he is the holy ghost he said this mighty revelation is what the early church had listen brother madam's teaching on the godhead was not something new it was already here before the dark ages it was here before denomination what happened was is the man's ideas tore down the authority of the name but it must be restored in the last days along with the correct formula for water baptism so with the restoration of the name comes a restoration of the way to baptize which comes the restoration of power in the church because there's no other name amen that power can come by outside of the name of jesus christ amen i admit that it takes a revelation from the holy ghost to see the truth about the godhead and these days when there are so much perverting of the scriptures in the mind he said but the prevailing overcoming church is built on revelation so we can expect god to reveal his truth to us amen if god expects you to overcome and prevail against the gates of hell he's got to release a revelation to you that will give you the power to do what his word is requiring you to do in the age you're living in amen now let me say this i've actually met people brother john they'll say well i'm praying about getting baptized i'm praying about water baptism i'm praying should i get baptized should i not the prophet of god said however amen you actually don't need a revelation on water baptism it is right there staring you in the face come on now it's right there staring you in the face well i'm praying shouldn't i get baptized should i and i had one one person tell me one time in the prayer line they said i'm praying should i get the holy ghost or not i said brother there are some things you ain't got to pray about amen his word is his will and what is written come on now if your daddy died and he had a wheel and he wrote things in that wheel he'd say you know let's put it this way brother john and brother seth and i were brothers in the flesh amen our daddy died and our daddy had a he had a house he had a ranch and he had a boathouse he meant well i got the boathouse and brother john got the ranch and his brother said he got the he got the the lake house or whatever you know or the house amen now look the wheel is open right amen therefore you read the wheel and i'll tell you what you're not going to do is you're not going to sit there and decide if you can receive that or not if it's wrote in the will and it is your name is in the will then you've got a right to go possess what's been left to you and i say this morning church the word of god is the will of god and whatever his word says is what he desires his children to possess and if his word said repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive it give to the holy ghost amen the first step is repent amen the second step is received and then the baptism of the holy ghost through a water baptism oh my would it be possible then for one minute for the apostles to be led astray from a direct command of the lord to baptize in the name of the father son holy ghost amen and then find them in willful disobedience they knew what the name was and there is not one place in scripture were they baptized any other way than in the name of the lord jesus christ amen i love how a prophet puts things he says common sense would tell you that the book of acts is the church in action and if they baptize that way then that is the way to baptize common sense would tell you if they were baptized in the name of jesus christ and was overcoming which doctors amen that's the way to baptize if they were baptized and in the name of jesus christ and they were raising a paralyzed people then that's the name to baptize him well glory to god anyhow if you think that is strong what do you think of this anyone who was not baptized in the name of the lord jesus had to be baptized over again jesus didn't go there and say well let's let's reason about this and you know no he said go be baptized again amen then don't think you're strong when the prophet said amen thus saith the lord you've been baptized entitled you've been baptized wrong amen it was the same spirit coming from the same revelation coming from the same name which is the name of jesus christ amen let's look at this if this is okay in the book of acts the second chapter and the 38th verse amen notice his name here amen it's right here in the first two words of the scripture and then peter said in them okay where have i heard that name peter at before oh that's right peter was there in matthew 28 19 right that's right peter was there in matthew 16 then here he is in acts 2 and it says repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost somebody shout that word baptized be baptized that word baptized means to dip repeatedly to emerge to submerge a vessel sunk it means to cleanse by dipping or submerging it is to wash to make clean with water to wash oneself to bathe it is not to be overwhelmed or confused with 9 11. now amen i'm not talking about the terrorist attack i'm talking about two greek words one is is in the greek lexicon it's numbered 911 which that word means bapto b-a-p-t-o the clearest example shows that the mean of baptism now notice this there's two different types there's bapto then there's baptism bapto and baptizo two different meanings he said it's a text from the greek poet and physician that candor who lived about 2000 or 200 b.c it is a recipe for making pickles and is a helpful because it uses both words nick kander says that in order to make a pickle the vegetable should first be dipped which is baptob into boiling water and then it should be baptized which is baptizo in the vinegar solution it shall be bapto which is to dip in the water boiling water then it shall be baptizo which is means to be submerged into the vinegar solution both verbs concern the immersion of vegetables in a solution oh god somebody shout solution amen the problem is we got a pickle that needs to be changed we got a cucumber that needs to be turned to a pickle what is the solution there's got to be a solution somewhere amen the first notice this the first is temporary amen so the bapto is temporary amen the second is the act of baptizing the vegetable which produces a permanent change glory to god you can bapto it and it's only temporary but you can baptize oh it and it'll produce a change when used in the new testament amen the word more often refers to our union and identification with christ then to our water baptism he that believes and is baptized shall be saved amen christ is saying that the mere intellectual ascent is not enough there must be a union with him which is a real change like a vegetable to a pickle i'm on church you can take that vegetable and you can bapto it all day long you can dip it and you can dip it and you can dip it and there'll be no change but if you ever baptize it and you emerge it into a solution amen then the solution will produce a change i say to you tonight friends amen i propose to you amen that you can baptize a person in the creek until the catfish know him by their first name but until they receive the authority of the holy ghost there will never be a change but if jesus christ comes in that vessel there'll be a change like you've never seen before glory to god i'm not talking about a temporary change i'm not talking about going to church and shaking a preacher's hand you can do that under dead titles and you'll remain a cigarette sucking alcoholic drinking man amen but if you ever get the holy ghost if you ever receive the authority of jesus christ through his name it'll do more than make you a church member it'll do more than just make you a religious individual it'll make you a holy ghost field fire baptized devil-chasing son or daughter of god come on friends we need more than baptoe we need a baptism with the spirit of god to come in the church and to produce a change a change somebody shout change this ain't a temporary change it's a permanent change i tell you what our young people need we need to change come on our young people are facing devils that you ain't never faced before well i might as well preach i'm here hat now amen our kids are facing transgender devils homosexual devils all kinds of demons of perversion i pay what we need in the church we don't need intellectualism and we don't need psychology we need jesus christ amen to come in the church to the authority and power of his name and release our young people from the demons of laodicea release our churches from the pressures of religion into a place where god can bring a change oh god you say well preacher i don't think things need to be preached about and the very minute you quit preaching about it it's the very time it comes in your church well i might as well preach that now amen don't talk about makeup and before long the whole church will be full of it don't talk about televisions and before long the whole church will have one don't preach against high-heeled shoes and before long the whole church will be wearing them amen if there is a god who said come out from among them and be separate saith the lord i think somebody ought to get a backbone and preach the word of god until jesus comes in the church and brings a change by the authority of his name amen well i'm sorry i ain't no lip rested amen 65 preacher i am a sassafras holy ghost-filled preacher may not be popular but it's the truth anyhow i will not back up the devils i will not bow my knee to devils sin is sin and holiness is holiness and somebody ought to stand up and take a stand for the word of god and the name of jesus christ i'll tell you why all that nonsense filled up the nominations because they got a dead name they got a dead title they got no authority they got no strength ain't meant to resist those spirits that's why you got men in the pulpit that's been married three and four times that's why you got deacons with cigarettes in their pocket oh come on somebody i might as well preach that now that's why the church is full of corruption it's because there's no strength in the church because the strength comes by the name i am who i am are you hearing me there's got to be strength in the church to withstand it'll only come to the name of jesus christ i'll tell you amen now don't get mad at me amen but there's no strength to even be what god called them to be do you realize god called a man to be a man and he called a woman to be a woman and he called a preacher to be a preacher and he called a deacon to be a deacon and he called a sunday school teacher to be a sunday school teacher and he called a husband to be a husband and a wife to be a wife he didn't call the wife to be the head ship of the home and he didn't call the husband to be some penny-wasted that ain't got the courage to take a stand and lead his family it's a it's a it's a warped role you know why because there's no life in there there's no strength in there they're under titles that has no power oh come on friends amen well brother andrew word gave it here in the name of father in the name of father how many fathers are they here today well we're gathered here in the name of son how many sons are there here well we're gathered here in the name of the spirit there's all kinds of spirits in here as long as you don't put a name to the title then there'll be no identification the strength of what you're talking about but if you put a name behind the title then there'll be an identification and a strength time and i want the devil to know as for me and my house we are following the name of the lord jesus christ let there be no question what god we're following we're following the same god that peter preached about we're found the same god that paul met on the road to damascus that changed him from being a stiff net a man starching a million follower to be in a holy ghost field prophet of god to lead the church into victory glory to god hallelujah it's the truth anyhow we ought to lift up the name of jesus somebody shout jesus somebody shout jesus the name of jesus is above every demon the name of jesus is above every sickness the name of jesus will make a clean living family the name of jesus will make a clean living marriage the name of jesus will make a clean living church come on now i'm talking about the name of the lord jesus christ but the the problem is we're living at that time where there's no strength to withstand because they've denied the name that gives them the strength i remember a few years ago my one of my my great uncles his wife that i've been my great aunt we went to the funeral and it was at a methodist church we went in there and as i pulled in the parking lot there was a sign out front and it said so-and-so is a pastor i said oh i've heard that name i go to school with his daughter you know so i walked in and there was the guy stepped the door and he said well my name is so and so i said oh you must be the pastor right he said no he said look up there and about that time brother out of the office walked his wife she had a big long roll bone big old gold cross he said she's the pastor he said she's a pastor i said well what do you do if she's the pastor what do you do he said well i wash and i cook and i clean i take the kids to school i put him to bed i make the beds i thought what a warped perverted role under the name of religion i'm not a politician i'm a preacher what a warped role under the name of religion amen here is a god's order was a man to lead and a woman to follow i'm not talking about a wife abuser i'm talking about a real example she can follow can i preach are you hearing me if you want your wife to follow you set an example she can follow it's a perversion role and the reason it's a perverted role is because an evil conscience has come in the church and they've seared their conscience to the word by some dead interpretation of the devil's interpretation of the name of jesus but look what paul said he said let us draw near with a true heart in a full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with the pure water that word prequel means shook away amen shake away our conscience with the sin problem and evil and darkness shook all that off and with our bodies we have been washed with pure water through water baptism in the name of jesus christ to walk freely and boldly up to god knowing this that the evil that i once loved has passed away well i'm preaching to you now the evil that i once loved is now passed away knowing that the life that i once lived is now ceased not because i did it because something come in me and did it itself by grace he saved me i believed him he'd give me the holy spirit and the things that i once hated i now love the sacrifice it used to be hard for me to go to church i love to go now to hear the people sing and shout and testify i used to hate it but i love it now because something has changed me then i have a new living way something is anchored here i know when i went down in the water and they baptized me in the name of the lord jesus christ i came up changed glory to god is there anybody here can testify you've been changed you've been changed you don't walk the same walk you don't talk the same talk you don't desire the same desires come on friends you get a man baptized in the name of jesus christ and get him full of the holy ghost and get him drunk on the holy ghost amen that man will love everybody come on now amen i tell you this much what we needed what the product of god said he said we need a drunk church you say drunk church we need a drunk church what do you mean preacher we need a church drunk on the holy ghost y'all never seen it i say it this way i don't have to lift myself up i just said cause it's the truth i've never been drunk never had any part of alcohol but i have heard a lot about people that has and there's one thing i've heard that a drunk don't like to be drunk by himself if he gonna be drunk he wants you to be drunk amen amen you know the most miserable thing you'll ever run into is a man that's drunk and you're not drunk he'll make you so miserable come on now are you hearing me amen he'll spit over you and he'll slobber over you and he'll fall on you he meant but if you want to enjoy it amen get drunk with him amen i'll tell you what if you get somebody drunk on the holy ghost you get them drunk on the power of god amen you get them drunk on the love of jesus christ i tell you what you'll be so miserable if you ain't drunk yourself but if you get drunk yourself it'll make you want to get everybody drunk oh god open up the wine of heaven and pour it in the church this morning until we get so drunk on god come on now you know what else happens when somebody gets drunk and then they forget about everything that they didn't like about somebody are you hearing me amen you get a man drunk two hours ago before he was struck he was ready to fight you get him drunk he's ready to hug his neck i tell you what'll take care of a lot of problems in our churches is get the people drunk on the holy ghost they'll go from fussing and fighting and putin and dismissing each other into loving each other and putting their arms around each other come on friends i hate every devil in hell i hate ever sin but i love the sinner and if i can invite you to the same bottle that i've been drinking from it'll get you so drunk you'll forget about everything and begin to remember god is still god and his word is still true and his power is still here we need a drunk church i know you may think i'm crazy but we need a drunk church we need young people drunk you say preacher are you advocating underage drinking yes sir on the holy ghost come on somebody amen i think our elders need to get drunk i think our preachers need to get drunk i think our young people need to get drunk i think our songwriters need to get drunk i think our deacons need to get drunk i think our musicians need to get drunk i think the church of the living god needs to get drunk on the stimulation of revelation until a fire comes in the church and begins to burn out every evil conscience and begins to wash the hearts and lives of his children we need a drunk church they've silent priests one time what we need is a drunk church i'll tell you what i think that's what we need and if that's what we need which we're going to have you know something else i found out brother you get a man wrecking that he'll go to claiming things are you hearing me you get a man i remember one time brother john my great granddaddy he picked me up at the school there that's this little boy he picked me up to school we got in his car and we right across from the school i went to was a package store a minute right there there was a guy come walking out he had a big old big old bottle a big old bag a brown paper bag under his arm and then there come this little woman i mean she wasn't all with five feet frail little woman i mean she looked real small and tiny she come walking out with two big old two big old brown paper bags under ours she come walking i never forget it granny looked at me he said here's what's going to happen son she's going to go home and drink that he said and she's going to lay in the floor and she's going to look at that wall and say i'll climb it if it takes me all night i said what do you mean he said she going to get so drunk he said for long she gonna start claiming things that aren't hers he said like this you get somebody drunk you get somebody drunk in their in somebody else's house he said they'll go to claim and that's their house that's their car that's their home he said see what happens is when they get intoxicated it releases something in them to claim something that's not theirs or somebody says they can't have i thought oh god that's what we need today is a drunk church get him so drunk on the holy ghost if they lay in the floor brother roger and scroll and cream and cry and everything else get them so drunk till they look at this rapture and say i'll take it if it costs me everything i'll take my mountain if it cost me everything i have not come here to die and they ought to see you i have come here to live by the revelation of the name i've been baptized in amen i tell you what it's time to do it's time to quit taking satan substitutes for the name of jesus christ there is no other name whereby men can be saved so quit accepting some substitute that has no power to save the prophet said they don't give a substitution for water baptism in the name of jesus christ they said father son holy ghost another place he said don't be carried away with this hybrid stuff it's not right it's finally come to a tent and it can't go back when it's hybrid it's finished he said see they've done substituted divine healing he said with the doctor's office instead of on your knees in prayer now are you preaching against going to the doctor no brother took his kiss to the doctor i'm saying don't let the devil rob you of the power that's in the name you've been baptized in he said see they divided the word of the nightmares now i want to read this to you from the indictment he said notice they the worshipers the men who had looked for the promise the men who would look for it through the years and ages and with nothing to do but in that constant seminary but they had divided the word according to the teacher the seminary and they had missed the very truth of it he said see they the priest the minister that day there the headquarters the ministry of that day was killing the very god the very lamb the very one they claimed to be worshiping they were killing come on amen do you realize and that's what's happened today he said see the day i'm not this bunch of ordained ministers in their creeds and denominations they are crucifying to the people the very god that they claim to love and serve i indict these ministers in the name of jesus christ upon their doctrine that they claim the days of miracles has passed and that water baptism in the name is not sufficient and is not right upon any of those words that they have sister decrees for i indict them as guilty and the blood of jesus christ is upon their hands for crucifying afresh the lord jesus the second time they are crucifying christ to the public taken from them the thing that they're supposed to be giving them and they substituted something else in its place he said see a church creed for popularity so they've substituted a church creed for popularity what is a church creed a church creed is that we've got titles instead of a name and they took that in the place to be popular i'm on church but let's go back to peter who had the keys and let's see what is three three is perfection right do you realize in acts 2 he opened the jews he opened the jews at jerusalem with the right to go in the kingdom in acts chapter 8 he opened it to the samaritans in acts chapter 10 he opened it to the gentiles the three major races peter opened the kingdom to them by the revelation of the name of jesus christ and being baptized in that name oh now and i preached you for a second amen you know what peter was he was an ignorant an unlearned fisherman come on he was an ignorant an unlearned fisherman peter was a fisherman that knew nothing about god the only thing he probably knowed was how to catch fish but when he come in the presence of god and seen the great creator who could create fish when he told him to let down the net for the draw there wasn't any fish there so he just pulled his net up but he said at thy word lord i believe that you're the son of god and if i let down the net you told me you would do your word because you and your word are the same so i let down the net when he began to pull he said depart lord i'm a sinful man see a fisherman after peter met christ and we say those words together after peter met christ he was never the same anymore so peter had come from baptist he went into baptism and he had found the solution and the solution was the name of jesus christ in water baptism which would open up the power of the holy ghost he was never the same he afterwards was so true to god that he was given the keys to the kingdom come on friends quit trying to separate peter from jesus peter was standing there in matthew 28 and he was there in acts 2. he was there in matthew 16 and his revelation is right here in this building this morning if there's anybody ready to receive the power of god there is an atonement power here for you to come in this power by the name of jesus peter couldn't even sign his own name think about this he couldn't even sign his own name yet he had the keys to the kingdom of god given to him by jesus christ i'm trying to behave myself this morning he couldn't even sign his own name but yet he had the keys given to him by the name of jesus christ jesus was not looking at peter's education he was looking at peter's faith he was not looking at peter's ability to understand what he was saying he was looking at peter's ability to believe what he was saying listen i don't know how brother that a man can believe on the name of jesus christ that is so vile and so wretched and so tore up and so scarred and so full of sin i don't understand by education how he can believe on the name and be baptized and receive something in his soul that changes him forever i can't educationally prove it but i can't prove it by faith you know why because i've seen it happen and if it's happened before it can happen again i'm on church we're not on an education walk we're on a faith walk we are not walking by sight we are walking by faith it starts with faith it little faith it ends with faith come on church we are not here learning god we are believing god we are believing god peter amen believe god you realize what the bible says without faith it is impossible to please god without faith it is impossible for he that cometh to god must believe somebody shall believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him can i give you a couple quotes here peter believed in such a way with such a faith that jesus gave him the keys to the kingdom and then later put him over the church another place and we noticed that he is with speaking of jesus congregation come from the poor people the outcast the ones that was probably cast away didn't have much education like the man he gave the keys the kingdom peter couldn't even sign his own name but by his faith it pleased jesus to give him the keys to the kingdom because he had revelation of him oh god it pleased god to give peter the keys because he had a revelation of him queen of sheba if you notice peter by revelation was given the keys the kingdom because god knowed that he had the revelation of the scripture before he asked his disciples and whole but one said elias others said a prophet he said but i'm asking you who do you say i am and then peter thou art the son of the liveth thus thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus said blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood he said see it was a revelation and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it see then what was it it was a direct revelation can we say that together direct revelation it was a direct revelation that had been made known the apostle that he was the son of god are you ready for this i'm turning the corner we're going home in a minute okay if the church of god still exists then those in the church has come in there by spiritual revelation the same way peter came in the same way the jew and the gentile and the samaritan come in is the same way the church of the living god will come in the power and authority of god because that's how we come in the church but i'm trying to differentiate between what really is truth and what is part truth the revelation that god reveals to you that his son who died in your stead then that's the revelation who he is see then this morning you're saved amen by receiving the revelation that there's nothing you could do to save yourself there's nothing you could do to heal yourself but you receive the one who could do it and his name is the lord jesus christ then somebody say spiritual revelation how does spiritual revelation come he says when god has made him known to you as a person glory to god when god has made him known to you as a person as your savior as your god as your redeemer as your healer as your king that's how the spiritual revelation comes what did paul brother brother say peter received he received a direct revelation look at this word direct it is without intervening factors or intermediaries let me back up and say that word would make sense intermediate errors going straight to the point with no one or nothing in between it is an aim or something in a particular direction at a particular person come on now it is something that is directed at a particular direction to a particular person to give someone an official order or an authoritative instruction oh god and i have a few more minutes to receive an authoritative instruction then what does the word indirect mean it's not directly caused by or resulting from something it's not done directly it's conducted through intermediaries see so god is not an indirect god he is a direct god god directly deals with his children god does not indirectly deal with him he directly deals with them see god directly dealt with moses in exodus 3 verse 1. now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the back side of the desert and came the mountain of god even to horeb and the angel lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a brush and he looked and behold the brush the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight which that bush does not burn and when the lord saw that he turned aside the seed god called unto him come on friends moses was there he was running from god god didn't send 10 different visions and dreams and gifts and prophecies god got a hold of moses and he directly led him to the back side of the desert and he directly called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i you realize what the prophet said he said moses had failed because he failed to find the limit the time limit of god he said when god revealed himself to him to the burning bush he found out then that they were the very thing in the burning bush was what he lacked and i think that's a hole with us today that many times we try to do the program ourselves and fail to get what was in the burden bush see the direct revelation of the wheel and the time of god we have got to have the season four so when moses found out now the direct the real direct will of god and the time of god and the revelation of everything to do now try to keep him out of egypt when he received the real revelation the direct revelation he said now try to keep him out of egypt right back to egypt he went just as hard as he could go now moses was looking first at the word and the word had promised the deliverance he knew the time was nigh now he had to have a direct contact with god to know how and when to do it he had to have a direct revelation he had to have direct contact aim to notice this to receive the direct will now we as full gospel people have made many mistakes by looking in the word and saying god said this and we fail to find the direct revelation of our life to fit in that program when we find that then things are going to happen see so what are three things we must have can i drop something to the young people we must have direct will we must have direct contact and we must have direct revelation see that we are saved amen by direct contact with god you're saved by faith not by imaginary but the direct contact with god who brings the supernatural life into your mortal beings see then when you believe on the name of the lord jesus christ you receive the name of the lord you're baptized in that name amen supernatural life for the holy ghost comes in to your mortal beings being seek then right here can i can i stop and take a quick survey how many has been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ do you realize what you have do you realize who you are he said preacher are you trying to embarrass somebody no i'm trying to preach the word to you if that's okay i want to show you something amen the bible says i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me watch this and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me i wish right now seth i was a preacher are you hearing me i wish somehow i could break this down and get you to see this that if you have been baptized in the name of jesus christ then the same life that was in him when he walked the source of galilee that was in him when he raised the widow of name son that was there when he turned water into wine that same life has come in you by the baptism of jesus christ by the holy ghost come on church it's not you living brother you were telling me last night all you've been through amen how can you go through what you've been through and all the pain in your body and the doctors can't figure it out but i'll tell you how it happened it's because the same life that was in jesus christ has come into that mortal party and that same life is in this building this morning come on church you ain't got to back up any longer if you've been baptized in the name of jesus christ you are a sworn in authoritative son of the living god authoritative daughter of god you've received amen direct will direct revelation through direct contact hallelujah we are not here as a bunch of countdown something we are the christians of god amen how many young christians we got here today can i tell you what a prophet said he said as a young christian i've always made this statement i was glad god got a hold of me before the church did i was glad god got a hold of me hey you felt something on that catch it says i was glad god got a hold of me before the church did he said hard telling what i would have been oh but i was thankful of the leadership and the direct contact that the holy spirit impressed my life with before i ever even surrendered it mercy before he ever even surrendered to the name of jesus christ to the baptism of the name to receive the holy ghost he said the holy ghost had already impressed my life hallelujah he had already impressed him for as a little lad i knew there was something he had talked to me and i talked to him he had talked back to me and i began to notice that things he told me as a little lad they began to happen just exactly the way he said he would do so i knowed that it had to be true listen young people amen god has sent you a message and it's called the message of the hour may i announce to you what it is it's not a bunch of books in your library it's not pictures on the wall it's not tapes that your parents listen to it is the direct revelation of god and where is the source of the revelation the same place peter got it out of heaven came the revelation oh glory to god oh hallelujah out of heaven was peter receiving the revelation that flesh and blood cannot reveal him come on you want to go with me to the word let's go where did moses commission come from it came from the pillar of fire where did the pillar of fire come from it came down out of heaven where did paul get his change on the damascus road where did the revelation come out of heaven came a lot amen they would bring a change to paul oh let's not stop there let's come to our day brother roger in 1933 on the ohio river baptizing the 17th person out of heaven came alive and out of that light came a voice and the voice said as tom the baptist was sin to forerun the first coming of christ your message will forerun the second coming what was it it was the message of direct revelation that would reintroduce the church to the name of heaven to the name of god to the name of the powers of god oh come on sin the light tabernacle you have not come here as a bunch of confused people you have come here as the authoritative ambassadors of jesus christ let somebody give him some praise i'm about to shout my studios are you hear me this morning we are not a bunch of church members we are the authoritative sons and daughters of god you've got more authority than you realize young man you've got more authority than you realize the world may look at you as just a young boy just going through life you've got more authority than the world realizes you've got the authority as a young man to speak the word of god and believe for your healing you've got the authority to pine devil come on young man you've got a part in your life amen little sis god sent you a message it would be a direct revelation to put his name over your heart glory to god he is here this morning in the power of revelation receive the authority of his name oh down to the ages it's been revelation it's been revelation and tonight it's revelation not an outward form not a declaration of creeds amen but a prayer a direct revelation that god has revealed to you that christ is your passover lamb he has bore your sins you've accepted him as the sin offering in your stead it is a revelation can i read you one more every plant that my heavenly father hasn't planted will be rooted up but upon this rock i'll build my church i love the way brother interprets us here and the gates of hell can't shake it down isn't that powerful the gates of hell can't shake it down you know what i feel brother i found the devil i'll tell you he'll kill you i'm gonna kill you i'm okay definitely told anybody that yeah i'm gonna kill you i'm gonna get you i'm gonna get you and you know what before long you'll begin to fear that every little thing oh the devil's gonna get me there but but can i let you in a little secret if the devil ain't got you yet it's a good sign he ain't gonna get you hello somebody if the devil ain't got you yet it's a sign he ain't going to get come on friends if the devil was going to get you he would have done got you but he can't get you because god got you for the devil to get you and if god's got you then the gates of hell cannot shake down what god has established by the revelation of his name oh my he built it up on peter's revelation of who he was the great main revelation always is who jesus christ is i don't care how many persecutions how many lines they draw and cut you out i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall never prevail see the holy spirit moving working the resurrected christ moving who can stop it i love what he says next brother john try it who can stop this revelation try it who can stop this power try it you'll never be able to do it it's going right on and on and on it'll rise all the critics you want to listen rise uh can i close with this rise i mean i keep preaching if you want me to rise all the critics you want to it'll only strengthen the church every time you do it every critic that rises against this revelation only strengthens the that's powerful every critic that rises against the word of god only strengthens the church they sing a song i just want to speak the name of jesus do you realize what it's time to do it's time to speak the name of jesus you know you know there's still power in the name of jesus to change situations you know there's still power in the name of jesus to stop things from happening amen you say preacher why'd you ask us if we'd been baptized the name because if you've been baptized in the name it's time to start using the name you've been baptized into it's time to use it he didn't just baptize you in his name fill you with his spirit to sit down in church and say well i've been baptized in the name of jesus christ amen all right that's right he baptized you in his name for authority to be messiahs to be witnesses to be to be living breathing witnesses of his power in the age you're living in you know what the probably god told a story like this he said i was among some spirituals one time he said i don't think they're not real he said they are. he said they get in there and he said they was in there and he said what happened was they got to do in some kind of chant or something and he said they lifted a table up off the floor he said that table was dancing through the air remember he said his dad sorry he said i went over there and they said now look if you've been preaching all this is if you what you're saying is really real let's see if let's see if there really is power and what you're talking about he said now i knew this was not the time to not know what you're talking about he said i walked over there he said the guy got up said oh i'll take care of it he said he ran over and grabbed the table said the table liked it broke every bone of the man's body said just jerked him around all over the place he said so i stood there and i said there's only one way to bring that table down and that's got to be through a name he said so i stood there and i looked at that table and i said okay i'm going to take i love how he says things take this opportunity to prove to them the name he said i stood there brother roger and he said look the table i said all right in the name of the holy church i command that table to come down he said just danced all over the place he said in the name of the pope i command that table to come down just danced all over the place he said then i thought now i'm going to really put the name of jesus to test he said i looked up there and said in the name of the father son holy ghost let that table come down he said just danced all around he said then i thought i look how he says things then i thought i'll just try the powerful name i was baptized into and he said i looked at that table and i said in the name of the lord jesus christ i command that table to come down he said it came down so quick it like to break every leg off of it are you hearing me friends there's still power in the name of jesus there's power to stop there's power to bind there's power to loose it's all in the name of jesus christ let us stand our feet this morning there's still power in the name of jesus christ oh my do you love him this morning i love this there is an obedience of faith paul says it this way in romans which we read last night in the church age book the probably god said the true revelation of the true church she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army romans 16 paul says now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world begin but now is made manifest and by the scriptures the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting god made known to all nations for the obedience of faith the obedience faith i read that the day of the obedience of faith brother john and something opened to me in the scriptures when they were obedient they were invincible the obedience to the faith released you say was it the bible it's deuteronomy 7 27 24 you shall deliver their kings in thy hand and thou shalt destroy thy name from under heaven there shall no man be able to stand before thee until thou have destroyed them deuteronomy 11 25 there shall no man be able to stand before you for the lord your god now lord says the lord your god shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon and he has said unto you do you see a little bit more clearly who you are amen laodicea should be fearing you and dreading you not you dreading inferiorly odyssey demons should be fearing you i remember i remember brother donnie reagan minister one time he made a statement he said i want to be the kind of christian that hail fears every morning i get up i thought that's pretty powerful he said i want to be the kind of christian when my feet hit the floor in the morning the devils in hell go to scatter and said oh no he lie he's alive he made it through the night another day of putting up with with with a man of god another day i put up with a christian come on that's who you are you were not put here to fear the devil and bread the devil you were put

moses so will i be with you i will not fail thee nor forsake thee how's these things coming through the revelation the lord gave unto israel all the way in which he swear to give unto their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt therein and the lord gave them rest round about according to all that he swear unto their fathers i love this and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them
