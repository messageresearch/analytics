[17:43] throne.

[34:42] to see sister Essie with us today. We're
[34:46] expecting her to um maybe sing or
[34:51] we want to be in prayer for our sister
[34:53] because she's going through a lot of
[34:55] pain and that God would just just touch
[34:59] her body. Amen.
[35:01] Amen. If you would turn in in your
[35:04] Bibles with me to the book of St. John
[35:06] today.
[35:08] I trust each of us have been walking the
[35:12] road to Wellville.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:20] Before we begin reading in St. John
[35:22] chapter 15, let's um bow for just a word
[35:27] of prayer, I wonder before we pray,
[35:30] would there be anybody that's would say,
[35:33] "Brother John, there is something on my
[35:34] heart. I I really want God to move in
[35:37] that situation. Amen. Let's let's
[35:39] believe with our hearts. Heavenly
[35:41] Father,
[35:43] thank you that you
[35:45] are greater than all of our needs.
[35:50] Lord, you're
[35:52] your your word is so powerful. It's a
[35:56] discerner of the thoughts intents of our
[35:58] heart. And Lord, you sent your word to
[36:02] heal the people. You sent your word to
[36:06] uh lead, to guide, to correct,
[36:09] to make a way where there seemth to be
[36:12] no way. Your word will not return void.
[36:14] And Lord, as we come before you today
[36:17] with these needs, Lord, we ask that you
[36:20] would cleanse us all of our sins and our
[36:22] iniquities,
[36:24] may there be nothing that stands in the
[36:27] way of us being able to receive what we
[36:29] have need of today.
[36:31] God, bless all of us with faith today
[36:35] to take a hold of thy word. Forgive us
[36:39] of our doubts, fears, or trespasses,
[36:43] and anything, Lord, that is displeasing.
[36:46] Pray that you come this morning
[36:49] and
[36:51] be the faithful God that you are
[36:54] and draw us all closer to you, Lord.
[36:58] Bless thy word to our hearts. May it be
[37:00] so real that we leave here
[37:03] uh Lord that we leave here with a change
[37:06] in our nature.
[37:09] Lord, we thank you for the fellowship
[37:12] and the food that we're going to have uh
[37:14] after the service.
[37:17] And Lord, we just want to thank you for
[37:20] the food that we're going to have now,
[37:22] the spiritual food. And we just ask your
[37:23] blessings on both. Father, we love you.
[37:26] We thank thee for these things. we pray
[37:28] now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. St. John chapter 15, we're going
[37:34] to start reading with verse number 12.
[37:36] This is my commandment that you love one
[37:39] another as I have loved you.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Greater love have no man than this.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; That a man lay down his life for his
[37:47] friends.
[37:49] And ye are my friends if you do
[37:52] whatsoever I command you. And I want to
[37:54] take my text from this. and you are my
[37:56] friends if you do whatsoever I command
[37:58] you. Henceforth I call you not servants
[38:01] for the servant knoweth not what his
[38:03] lord doeth. But I have called you
[38:06] friends for all things that I have heard
[38:08] of my father I have made known unto you.
[38:11] You have not chosen me but I have chosen
[38:13] you and have ordained you that you
[38:15] should go and bring forth fruit. And
[38:18] this fruit is obviously at this point is
[38:21] to love one another as Christ has loved
[38:23] us.
[38:24] Amen. and that your fruit should remain
[38:27] and that whatsoever you ask the father
[38:29] in my name you he shall give it to you.
[38:31] These things I command you that you love
[38:34] one another. God bless you. You may be
[38:37] seated. Today we want to entitle this
[38:39] message God's friends.
[38:42] You know I have a lot of friends. I have
[38:45] a lot of friends from all over the world
[38:49] and they text me.
[38:51] They text me
[38:53] um and they'll I mean I got them from
[38:57] every country practically texting me
[39:00] friends.
[39:02] Friends that I didn't even know they
[39:03] were friends.
[39:06] Friends that say, "I got your name in my
[39:11] contacts. I just wonder who you are."
[39:15] Friends like, "Hey, my name is so and
[39:17] so. Where do you live?"
[39:20] Friends like um what are you doing
[39:23] today? Friends like hey do you want to
[39:26] talk later?
[39:28] Friends like um are you interested in um
[39:32] talking about a business? I've got
[39:35] friends all over the place. Friends that
[39:37] even know my name. Hey, hi John. This is
[39:39] soand so.
[39:42] Sometimes they even say John Martin.
[39:44] Thinking how do they even know that?
[39:47] But they they come across as friends
[39:51] and uh at work I've had a number of
[39:53] people call my phone and they want to
[39:55] sell me something
[39:58] and they act so friendly
[40:01] and then uh come to find out when you're
[40:03] not interested in buying they just want
[40:05] to be rude to you.
[40:08] Have you ever had have you ever thought
[40:10] you had a friend but only to come to
[40:13] find out they stabbed you in the back?
[40:17] Can anybody relate to this that I'm
[40:19] talking about today?
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You are my friends if you
[40:26] do whatsoever I command you."
[40:30] He just made it real clear that there
[40:32] was something that had to be done to be
[40:35] a friend of Jesus.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Is a God that loves everybody no matter
[40:41] what. But when it comes to friendship,
[40:45] that closeness,
[40:47] he wants us to do what he says. And if
[40:50] we do, he he makes known to us things
[40:54] that he doesn't make known to everybody
[40:56] else.
[40:59] And I'm so glad for a friendship with
[41:01] Jesus.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't trade it away for anything.
[41:08] He's a friend that sticketh closer than
[41:10] a brother. The Bible says, let's start
[41:13] out here in Luke 10:1. I'm going just a
[41:16] little background with the disciples.
[41:18] And there's all types of friendships.
[41:20] And we're just going to kind of get into
[41:21] that a little bit today. Luke 10:1 says,
[41:24] "After these things, the Lord appointed
[41:26] other 70." So, these are 70 other uh
[41:30] disciples also, and he sent them um two
[41:34] and two before his face into every city
[41:37] and place whether he himself would come.
[41:40] Therefore he said unto them, "The
[41:41] harvest is is great, but the laborers
[41:44] are few. Pray ye therefore that the Lord
[41:46] of harvest that he'll he would send
[41:48] forth laborers into the harvest." I I'll
[41:51] say the best way to build a church is to
[41:53] stop thinking about ourselves.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:57] You know, there's too too much thinking
[41:58] about ourselves and what the church
[42:00] should be doing. In in reality, the best
[42:02] way to build a church is to stop
[42:04] thinking about yourself. You think about
[42:06] others.
[42:07] And Jesus assigns 70 and sends them out
[42:11] two uh by two into every place. And they
[42:15] were casting out demons.
[42:19] Can you say amen?
[42:21] &gt;&gt; He did. They were they were casting out
[42:22] demons and they were healing all manners
[42:24] of sickness and diseases
[42:28] and
[42:29] it was a great miraculous time. And then
[42:32] drop down to verse 17. And the 70
[42:36] returned again with joy, saying, Lord,
[42:40] the devils are subject unto us through
[42:43] thy name.
[42:46] And and um God, he's just so graceful
[42:51] how he talks. He's he said unto them, I
[42:55] beheld Satan as lightning fall from
[42:58] heaven. In other words, he's bearing
[43:00] witness of what they just said.
[43:03] He says, "Behold, I I I give you power
[43:07] to tread on serpents and scorpions
[43:10] and over all the power of the enemy, and
[43:13] nothing shall by any means hurt you."
[43:16] And then he says,
[43:18] "Notwithstanding in this, don't rejoice.
[43:22] Don't rejoice in this power that I have
[43:26] given you to cast out demons."
[43:30] Don't rejoice in that.
[43:33] Don't rejoice that the spirits are
[43:35] subject to you, but rather rejoice
[43:38] because your names are written in
[43:40] heaven.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; The 70 got a high out of having
[43:46] authority over demonic spirits.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, even the devils are subject to us
[43:54] through thy name. It made them happy to
[43:56] rejoice. But Jesus knew there was
[43:59] something wrong with that spirit. When
[44:01] somebody is bragging about that,
[44:03] something is wrong. Even the rejoicing,
[44:06] it's wrong.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; It was like they were lifted up in their
[44:11] pride and they they enjoyed the display
[44:13] of the power that they had and they they
[44:16] that the word uh had over those demons,
[44:21] but they lost track of what was really
[44:24] important.
[44:28] Notwithstanding, in spite of in this,
[44:31] rejoice that the spirits are uh that the
[44:35] uh rejoice not that the spirits are
[44:36] subject to you, but rather rejoice
[44:38] because your names are written in
[44:39] heaven. Motives are extremely important
[44:42] to God.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; But the correct thing to do is to give
[44:47] diligence to make sure your calling in
[44:49] election is sure.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. to make sure
[44:54] that the life that you're living today
[44:56] is displaying that your name is written
[44:58] in heaven. That's what's important.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; That's we sing that song. Can't you see
[45:04] why I'm so happy?
[45:06] &gt;&gt; I've accepted
[45:09] I have accepted the word of the Lord.
[45:11] Not that I've got power to cast out
[45:14] demons. You know, it's it's amazing to
[45:15] me how how some people will rejoice over
[45:19] that, but they can't seem to live for
[45:21] Jesus on a daily basis.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; I just I don't understand that.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Verse 21, in that hour Jesus rejoiced in
[45:30] his spirit. Now notice this. Now Jesus
[45:33] is rejoicing in his spirit. This is a
[45:35] correct way of rejoicing here. And he
[45:38] said,"I thank thee, oh Father, Lord of
[45:39] heaven and earth, that thou has hid
[45:41] these things from the wise and the
[45:44] prudent, and have revealed them unto
[45:46] babes, even so, Father, so it seemed
[45:48] good in thy sight." So now he's
[45:51] rejoicing that God has the fathers
[45:54] actually hid the truth from these
[45:56] people.
[45:58] Wow.
[46:02] You know, God
[46:04] uh the Bible says flesh and blood will
[46:06] not enter the kingdom of heaven.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; There are certain things that are not
[46:10] going to be in there.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; And God is holy and and and God is
[46:14] righteous and and and and God is going
[46:16] to have a heaven full of his kind.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Not our kind.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; His kind. And so here he's he's he's
[46:24] saying, "Father, thank you that that
[46:26] that you hid this from this group of
[46:28] people who thought they were something
[46:30] special
[46:32] and you revealed him to those that
[46:35] that don't feel they're worth any are
[46:38] worthy of anything." And they they press
[46:40] in with all their heart to know Jesus
[46:44] &gt;&gt; because what does the all thing what
[46:45] does the Bible say? Verse 22. All things
[46:48] are delivered to me of my father, and no
[46:50] man knoweth the son but the father. And
[46:52] the and who the father is but the son
[46:55] and to whom the son will reveal.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Going back to our our opening scripture
[47:02] that you are my friends and everything
[47:04] that I that the father has told me, I've
[47:07] told you. I I haven't held back
[47:09] anything.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; I've told you exactly what the father's
[47:13] told me.
[47:16] Isn't it wonderful to know that God,
[47:19] he doesn't keep seekas from his bride?
[47:23] I think that's a beautiful thing. Now
[47:26] look at verse 23. And he turned unto his
[47:29] disciples and he said privately. He
[47:32] turned away from the 70. He looked to
[47:35] the 12 and he said privately, "Blessed
[47:39] are the eyes which see the things that
[47:42] you see.
[47:45] Isn't that beautiful?
[47:47] &gt;&gt; There was a special relationship that
[47:49] Jesus had with his chosen disciples. A
[47:52] special friendship, a private friendship
[47:55] in which Jesus shared things only with
[47:57] them. They were God's friends.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; They were God's friends. Don't rejoice
[48:06] that the demons are subject to you, but
[48:08] rejoice that you have eternal life.
[48:12] Jesus rejoiced that eternal life was
[48:15] actually hidden from the wise and proved
[48:17] it.
[48:18] I mean, even look at even the devil
[48:20] didn't know what he was doing when he
[48:22] crucified Jesus.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; He hid it. John chapter 6 verse 59.
[48:28] Let's we've gone through these
[48:30] scriptures before, but let's try to go
[48:31] through these uh real good. And and you
[48:34] know, I I'll just say try to enter in
[48:36] because there is something here today
[48:37] about a friendship with God.
[48:40] These things said he in the synagogue uh
[48:43] John 6:59
[48:45] as he taught in Capernium. So he said
[48:49] these things right in church and as he
[48:51] was teaching in the city capernium and
[48:53] many therefore of his disciples when
[48:55] they heard this they uh heard this said
[48:58] this is a hard saying who can hear it?
[49:03] They went to church. He taught in the
[49:05] church. And their testimony was this is
[49:07] this is too hard. Who can hear? Why is
[49:10] this being said in church? This is not
[49:13] encouraging.
[49:17] This is too hard.
[49:20] And when Jesus knew in himself that his
[49:23] disciples murmured, it was the disciples
[49:27] that murmured at it. He said unto them,
[49:30] "Does this offend you?"
[49:34] We're living in an hour where people are
[49:36] so easily offended.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; They get offended because you don't
[49:43] agree with the choices that they make or
[49:45] the attitude that they have and they get
[49:47] offended because you just don't agree
[49:49] with it. You don't agree with their
[49:51] behavior.
[49:53] You look at them wrong. you say
[49:54] something wrong and they're offended.
[49:58] Or if you don't want to answer their
[50:00] shenanigans, they get offended.
[50:04] Or if you just give them the word of
[50:06] God, they get offended.
[50:09] They just end up murmuring and
[50:10] complaining and feeling justified that
[50:13] it's okay to be offended.
[50:15] you know, they they actually feel it's
[50:17] okay that I'm offended
[50:21] because they feel justified because they
[50:24] didn't like what you said.
[50:28] A wicked hour. We're living in
[50:31] I believe we ought to be living in an
[50:33] hour where we Great peace have they that
[50:37] love thy law, and nothing shall offend
[50:40] them.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Fall in love with the word of God.
[50:43] That's the answer.
[50:45] Verse 62. What and if you shall see the
[50:50] Son of Man ascending up where he was
[50:52] before, it is the spirit that quickenth,
[50:54] the flesh profitth nothing. The words,
[50:56] now notice this, the words, the words
[50:59] that I speak unto you, they are spirit
[51:02] and they are life. In other words, pay
[51:04] attention to the words of God.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; My words will fail. My words may be
[51:11] confusion, but God's word, if you don't
[51:13] even understand it,
[51:15] &gt;&gt; it is the word of life.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; But there are some of you, he said, that
[51:23] don't believe my words. But Jesus knew
[51:26] from the beginning who they were that
[51:27] believe not, who that should betray him.
[51:30] who would remain humble and believe to
[51:32] the end and who would rise up with pride
[51:35] and and hurt a and just quit.
[51:40] God knows who's who.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; We don't know who's who. But as we go
[51:45] through life, we find out who's who,
[51:49] right? By their fruit, you shall know
[51:50] them. And in time, you see who's who.
[51:55] But God knows the intent, right, of the
[51:57] man's of man's heart. We have no right
[52:00] to judge a man's heart, but we have
[52:02] every right because Jesus gave us the
[52:05] right to to to look at somebody else's
[52:07] fruit,
[52:08] &gt;&gt; and you shall know them by their fruits.
[52:12] All right. Verse 65. And he said,
[52:13] "Therefore said I unto you, that no man
[52:15] can come unto me except it were given of
[52:17] my father." And from that time many of
[52:19] his disciples went back and they walked
[52:21] no more with him. They made a decision.
[52:25] They They're not walking anymore with
[52:28] Jesus.
[52:29] Now, here are the 70 that were
[52:31] appointed. Here are the ones that had um
[52:34] they were rejoicing that they had power
[52:36] to cast out devils and and to heal all
[52:39] manners of diseases. And they saw these
[52:41] miracles happen. And they came a little
[52:43] further down in the ministry. They went
[52:45] to church some Wednesday night and they
[52:47] heard something that was too strong for
[52:48] them.
[52:54] H they rejoiced because they had power
[52:57] over the devils. But they didn't realize
[52:59] it that eventually the devil had power
[53:02] over them.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; And he got them to disbelieve the word
[53:08] of God.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; And by that they said, "No, we're going
[53:11] to stop going to church.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Not going to walk with him anymore. I'm
[53:16] going to find something different that
[53:18] is not such a hard saying.
[53:22] That's nothing but the devil.
[53:26] That is nothing but the devil. God never
[53:29] wants us to quit.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; You can't find any scripture the you
[53:34] find the opposite. If you continue in my
[53:37] word, then are you my disciples indeed.
[53:40] You find just the opposite. God is one.
[53:43] God is building a building. He's
[53:44] building a church. He's building his
[53:46] character inside his people. And he
[53:49] doesn't stop.
[53:51] He's moving forward.
[53:53] But you know, the children of Israel,
[53:56] they left God while they were still in
[54:00] church,
[54:01] &gt;&gt; right? Their heart was back in Egypt.
[54:04] They went to church. They were led by
[54:07] the pillar of fire, the cloud by day,
[54:10] the fire by night.
[54:13] And their shoes didn't wear out. They
[54:15] had blue cross, blue shield, but in
[54:18] their heart they went back to Egypt.
[54:25] Now, can you imagine God's going to say,
[54:26] "Yeah, I want you to be in heaven with
[54:28] me."
[54:30] You understand what I'm trying to say?
[54:32] God has friends and then he has those
[54:35] who call God a friend. But
[54:39] you know, Brother Brandham said it like
[54:41] this. When you say you believe,
[54:44] that's you accepting Christ. But it
[54:46] isn't until God gives you the Holy Ghost
[54:49] that he accepts you.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; So, you know, we can call God our
[54:54] friend, but I want to hear God call me
[54:56] his friend.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; And he told me what I need to do to be
[55:01] that friend to do whatsoever he tells me
[55:05] to do.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; That makes a friendship with Jesus.
[55:10] beautiful friendship.
[55:13] Jesus knew from the beginning who was
[55:16] going to be sold out, go all the way,
[55:18] and who was going to just, you know
[55:20] what? I'm only going to go so far and
[55:21] quit. In verse 67, Jesus turned to the
[55:26] 12 of his disciples. And he says these
[55:29] words, "Will you go away? Will you also
[55:33] go away? Are you going to follow suit?"
[55:37] And they didn't say, "Oh, we that wasn't
[55:39] a hard saying. We understand it." They
[55:41] didn't say that.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; You don't have to understand the word of
[55:46] God. You just need to believe it.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; You just need to hold to it.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[55:58] We're living in a userfriendly hour
[56:00] where people are so easily they just
[56:03] want to use you
[56:06] &gt;&gt; without any embarrassment
[56:08] for loaves, for fishes, for healings,
[56:12] &gt;&gt; for whatever they can get out of you.
[56:14] It's a user friendly hour. They they
[56:16] don't even care if you know that you're
[56:18] being used.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Will you also go away? And Simon Peter
[56:25] answered,"Lord,
[56:27] if that would be the case,
[56:30] what ministry is like this ministry?
[56:34] To whom shall we go?
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Thou has the words of eternal life."
[56:44] &gt;&gt; You know, my word can't get you. My word
[56:46] can't even hardly get you to my house.
[56:47] I'll probably tell you the wrong way how
[56:49] to get there. You ever pass your
[56:51] driveway? I have.
[56:53] Man,
[56:53] &gt;&gt; I think I live there. I think I just
[56:55] passed it.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; But God's word will get you to heaven.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Surely it'll get you there.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And we believe and are
[57:10] sure that thou art the Christ, the Son
[57:12] of the living God." Who are they that
[57:15] going to walk away? Those who really
[57:17] don't believe
[57:20] God's word to be the truth.
[57:22] That means we could sit in church for
[57:24] years, say amen to the word, but in our
[57:28] our heart not even be there.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; You know, going to church don't get us
[57:34] to heaven.
[57:38] Jesus answered them, "Have not I chosen
[57:42] you 12, and one of you is a devil?"
[57:47] This sounds like a paradox, doesn't it?
[57:50] And he spake of Judas as Scariot the son
[57:52] of Simon for he it was that should
[57:54] betray him being one of the 12. To think
[57:56] that Jesus himself chose a devil to be a
[58:01] disciple
[58:02] &gt;&gt; in the church.
[58:04] It's amazing how God is not a respector
[58:07] of persons.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Choosing a devil and make him a treasure
[58:12] of the church.
[58:14] For he maketh the sun to rise on the
[58:17] evil and the good, and he sendeth rain
[58:19] upon the just. And that is the God that
[58:21] we serve.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; We serve a beautiful God.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; An amazing God.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; How could we ever think that God don't
[58:29] ever care about us?
[58:31] &gt;&gt; God cares. He loves us.
[58:36] God knows that every seed brings forth
[58:39] of its kind.
[58:42] It's his law. And it doesn't matter if
[58:45] you walk next to Jesus in the ministry
[58:47] like Judas did. You were taught the
[58:50] perfect doctrine by the greatest
[58:52] minister who Jesus was. It doesn't
[58:55] matter how many miracles you witness
[58:58] like Judas did. It doesn't matter if
[59:01] Jesus gives you power over unclean
[59:03] spirits to cast them out to heal all
[59:05] manner of sicknesses and all manner of
[59:06] diseases. No matter how much time you
[59:10] spend uh with no matter how much time
[59:12] the son of pition spends with the son of
[59:14] god it can never convert him.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Have not I chosen you 12 and one of you
[59:27] is a devil?
[59:31] Now he may have started going in the
[59:33] right direction but he ended up becoming
[59:35] a devil just like his father Lucifer who
[59:39] was made perfect at the beginning no
[59:42] flaws
[59:44] led the the worship and he was just
[59:46] perfect he was a bright angel still is a
[59:49] bright angel very beautiful
[59:54] his ma his name may have been in the
[59:57] book of light but it was taken
[1:00:01] God knows that no matter how much time
[1:00:03] you spend with somebody, the seed of God
[1:00:05] can never convert a seed of a devil.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Random said there's nothing
[1:00:13] there to quicken.
[1:00:16] Remember that there's nothing there to
[1:00:18] quicken.
[1:00:20] There's no way. Okay, let's say you went
[1:00:23] to the store, Brother James,
[1:00:26] and you got
[1:00:29] the tomatoes and the apples, but you
[1:00:33] forgot the bananas when you got home.
[1:00:34] Mom was not happy.
[1:00:37] So, you go in that bedroom where God has
[1:00:40] answered prayer.
[1:00:42] You say, "God,
[1:00:44] I really want one of these tomatoes to
[1:00:47] become a banana.
[1:00:54] Now, God can create,
[1:00:58] but every seed has to come forth of its
[1:01:00] kind. You can you can go ahead and plant
[1:01:02] those tomatoes, but you're not going to
[1:01:04] get bananas. You're not going to get a
[1:01:05] banana tree.
[1:01:08] So, it doesn't matter how much time we
[1:01:10] try to spend with somebody. If they
[1:01:12] don't get converted, it doesn't mean you
[1:01:14] didn't do your job. Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Every seed brings forth of its own kind.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Now, Ephesians 2, we often look at this.
[1:01:26] Where in times past, verse two, where in
[1:01:28] times past you walked according to the
[1:01:30] course of this world, according to the
[1:01:31] prince of the power of the air, the
[1:01:33] spirit that now works, where is it
[1:01:35] working? In children who are disobeying,
[1:01:39] among whom also we were all there at one
[1:01:42] time.
[1:01:44] We all had our conversation just like
[1:01:46] they did in the lust of the flesh,
[1:01:48] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:01:50] of the mind and were by nature the
[1:01:53] children of wrath. In other words, if
[1:01:56] you didn't get what you want, you sure
[1:01:58] let mom and dad know about it. You let
[1:02:00] your brothers and sisters, you let the
[1:02:02] people at school know about it. You let
[1:02:04] them know where you stood when you
[1:02:06] didn't get what you want. Children of
[1:02:09] wrath, even as others. We were all
[1:02:11] there.
[1:02:13] But God who is rich in mercy for his
[1:02:15] great love where he loved us even when
[1:02:17] we were dead in sins have quickened us
[1:02:20] together with Christ.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; There was something inside of us that
[1:02:26] could be quickened.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; You may be the only one in your family
[1:02:31] that's going.
[1:02:34] There has to be something inside of you
[1:02:38] that can be quickened to make alive.
[1:02:40] That can be converted from the old
[1:02:43] sinful nature to the lovely, beautiful,
[1:02:48] peaceful,
[1:02:50] lovely nature of Jesus Christ.
[1:02:54] Now, these scriptures are only referring
[1:02:56] to the true seed of God. They're not
[1:02:58] referring to if you're a a seed of Satan
[1:03:03] that that you you can just, you know,
[1:03:05] become a seed of God. You just can't. It
[1:03:07] would break the law of God.
[1:03:11] These are referring to those who were
[1:03:13] born. They're all We're all born in sin,
[1:03:15] shape, and iniquity.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Uh I don't care for a seed of Satan or a
[1:03:19] seat in God. Seed of God. We're all born
[1:03:21] in sin, shape, and iniquity.
[1:03:24] But there's something inside of the seed
[1:03:28] of God that can be quickened.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; And what quickens that? The word. The
[1:03:34] word of God. Not the word of John
[1:03:35] Martin. Not the word of not the word of
[1:03:38] a person.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; That's why that word of God can be
[1:03:44] spoken by a five-year-old and bring life
[1:03:46] into somebody.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; That's how powerful it is. Amen.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; God is amazing.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said in the mirror a
[1:03:57] Samaran church age he says we did not
[1:04:00] become seed by rebirth.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; We were seed and therefore were b reborn
[1:04:09] for only the elect can be reborn
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; because we were seed is the reason that
[1:04:15] we could be quickened in nonseed. There
[1:04:18] is nothing to quicken.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; So they can go to church. They can be
[1:04:27] part of the 70. They can go to church
[1:04:30] and and be the treasure of the church.
[1:04:34] Be chosen.
[1:04:36] That's powerful. Be chosen.
[1:04:39] But chosen for a wrong purpose. I mean,
[1:04:41] look, the God chose the devil to fulfill
[1:04:44] to bring character, right? to help help
[1:04:48] bring character in our lives.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; So the 70 walked away from Jesus
[1:04:57] because they could not take all the
[1:05:00] word,
[1:05:02] right? It was a hard saying who could
[1:05:04] hear it. They did not want to be a
[1:05:06] friend to all the word of God. Now think
[1:05:09] about that.
[1:05:11] They could take some of the word. They
[1:05:13] could be a friend to part of the word,
[1:05:14] but they could not be a friend to all
[1:05:16] the word.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; And there's this this mentality out
[1:05:22] there, oh yeah, I'm real good friends
[1:05:24] with Jesus, but I don't even read my
[1:05:25] Bible.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; I only go to church on the holidays,
[1:05:32] but yet still claiming to have a
[1:05:33] friendship.
[1:05:37] Brother Brandham said, "Though they were
[1:05:40] disciples, they were unbelievers."
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; About these 70. Though they were
[1:05:46] disciples, they were unbelievers. Why?
[1:05:49] Because they walked away.
[1:05:53] When you walk away is the proof of where
[1:05:55] you stand.
[1:05:59] That's why we sing songs like, "I'm
[1:06:01] going through.
[1:06:04] Though many fall to the side, I am
[1:06:06] determined. I'm going through.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; First John chapter 2 verse 19. Write
[1:06:14] this down if you'd like. It's a good
[1:06:16] scripture. They went out from us,
[1:06:20] but they were not of us.
[1:06:22] For if they had been of us, they would
[1:06:25] no doubt have continued with us. But
[1:06:30] they went out that they might be made
[1:06:32] manifest that they were not of us.
[1:06:38] So we don't know to the end who's who.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Now Judas,
[1:06:44] he actually walked with Jesus a little
[1:06:47] further than the 70 disciples did.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; He stuck around longer,
[1:06:54] but he eventually stopped walking with
[1:06:56] the word, too.
[1:06:58] Judas decided to cut off his friendship
[1:07:01] with Jesus for some money with a
[1:07:03] deceitful kiss.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:07:07] Judas
[1:07:09] make believed his friendship with Jesus.
[1:07:14] He make believed his friendship with
[1:07:17] Jesus. He was a makeeliever. So his
[1:07:20] friendship with Jesus was make believe.
[1:07:27] John 8:31 says, "Then Jesus said to
[1:07:30] those disciples that believed on him, if
[1:07:32] you continue in my word, then are you my
[1:07:34] disciples indeed, and you shall know the
[1:07:35] truth, and the truth shall make you
[1:07:37] free." So his this friendship here,
[1:07:40] you're my friends, and whatsoever the
[1:07:42] Father has told me, I am telling you,
[1:07:45] and this what I'm telling you is going
[1:07:47] to set you free. Don't ask any
[1:07:49] questions. Just believe it.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; But you got to continue in the word. You
[1:07:54] just can't you can't continue to come to
[1:07:56] church.
[1:07:58] That don't make you a believer.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; You've actually got to take the word,
[1:08:02] eat it, become the word, live it.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; That's what that scripture means.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; John 10:8 says, "All that ever came
[1:08:11] before me are thieves and robbers.
[1:08:15] They come to steal, to kill, to
[1:08:17] destroy." There was never a real
[1:08:20] friendship in tension in their heart.
[1:08:24] Jesus said, "I come that they might have
[1:08:26] life and that they might have it more
[1:08:27] abundantly." Jesus is the one that's
[1:08:30] wanting a real friendship with us. Can
[1:08:31] you say amen?
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; He's the whole world is full of people
[1:08:36] who fake it.
[1:08:38] Can you say amen to that statement?
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; I mean, you can't hardly go anywhere.
[1:08:43] The more spiritual you are, the more
[1:08:45] your eyes are open, the more you can see
[1:08:47] people are just fake. Amen.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; And I I'm not trying to cut down people,
[1:08:51] but it it's just they just they don't
[1:08:54] have enough love in their heart to be
[1:08:56] real.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; And and and you see it. And Jesus said,
[1:09:01] uh there's people that worship me, they
[1:09:03] don't even know what they're worshiping.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; And that the father is seeking such that
[1:09:07] will worship him in spirit and in truth.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; I believe God is looking for somebody to
[1:09:12] be a real friend with him.
[1:09:14] I believe that
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus wants a real friendship. He's
[1:09:20] looking for those who will stay with
[1:09:22] him. Stay with the word no matter what
[1:09:25] happens, no matter how hard it gets, no
[1:09:27] matter who turns the side, no matter
[1:09:30] what your friends say, your relatives
[1:09:32] say, your mom and dad say, your husband
[1:09:35] and wife says, stay with the word.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; I say that to the elect. Stay with the
[1:09:41] word.
[1:09:44] [Applause]
[1:09:47] It got real tough for Job, didn't it?
[1:09:51] But he stayed with the word. He kept his
[1:09:53] integrity. He kept his his he kept his
[1:09:56] friendship with the word
[1:10:00] to the point he says these words after
[1:10:02] all hell broke loose on him. And it was
[1:10:04] definitely hell broke loose on him. It
[1:10:06] was Satan himself coming to destroy his
[1:10:08] life. All hell broke loose. But his
[1:10:12] testimony was, "Though he slay me, yet
[1:10:15] will I trust him?"
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; He had a real friendship with God.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; He can do what he wants. I'm going to
[1:10:23] trust him.
[1:10:25] Sometimes we can't even trust in the
[1:10:27] smallest little trial that we go
[1:10:30] through.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; We're whining and crying about it.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; God wants us to trust him.
[1:10:39] Job was God's friend.
[1:10:43] His God testified. There's none like
[1:10:45] him. He's a perfect in in God's sight.
[1:10:50] Look at the attitude that Job maintained
[1:10:53] faithfully as a friend of God.
[1:10:57] He maintained
[1:10:59] a faithful attitude.
[1:11:04] He didn't murmur. He didn't complain. He
[1:11:07] didn't accuse God.
[1:11:11] I would believe Job could say this.
[1:11:14] This is a hard saying. This is a hard
[1:11:16] thing I'm going through. I don't
[1:11:19] understand it. But he didn't walk away.
[1:11:24] There was He had the seed of God in him.
[1:11:27] Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; And I'll say what we can gain out of
[1:11:32] this message today, saints, is we need
[1:11:34] to learn to take God's word as our best
[1:11:36] friend.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; This is we don't come to church to find
[1:11:42] out, you know, if we're going to get
[1:11:44] pumped up or if we're going to get um a
[1:11:48] chopped down.
[1:11:50] That's not what the word's for. I mean,
[1:11:52] it does tell us where we're at, but we
[1:11:55] what we do need to do is take the word
[1:11:57] of God seriously.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; And it it's written in here for our
[1:12:02] admonition.
[1:12:04] Job trusted God. He didn't need to ask
[1:12:07] for prayer all the time.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Job trusted his friend Jesus.
[1:12:18] There was a real relationship there, a
[1:12:20] real friendship there.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Did you know brother Brandon said when
[1:12:24] we ask for prayer repeatedly,
[1:12:28] it weakens our faith?
[1:12:32] What faith we had before we started
[1:12:35] becomes weaker if we repeatedly ask for
[1:12:39] prayer.
[1:12:42] It doesn't strengthen you when you
[1:12:44] repeatedly ask for prayer.
[1:12:46] It doesn't even increase the chances
[1:12:49] that you're going to get your prayer
[1:12:51] answered.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; It literally weakens our own faith.
[1:12:57] Now, I know that's a hard one to
[1:12:59] swallow,
[1:13:01] but it is.
[1:13:03] If you ask God,
[1:13:07] believe that God hears you
[1:13:10] and walk forward.
[1:13:13] Now if we want to strengthen our faith,
[1:13:15] we simply start with praying more
[1:13:17] ourself personally.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; That's how you do it. You pray more
[1:13:23] yourself. Isaiah 40:30 tells us tells us
[1:13:26] this. Even the youth, the youth, this is
[1:13:30] the young people shall faint and be
[1:13:32] weary and the young men shall utterly
[1:13:35] fall. But they that wait upon the Lord,
[1:13:39] they shall renew their strength. They
[1:13:41] shall mount up with wings as eagle. They
[1:13:43] shall run and not be weary. They shall
[1:13:45] walk and not faint.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; So if you want to build your faith,
[1:13:50] build your time in prayer alone with
[1:13:52] God.
[1:13:54] That's how you get stronger in faith.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; You spend time with God alone. Amen.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; If you don't maintain personal prayer
[1:14:02] with your friend Jesus, you'll end up
[1:14:05] becoming anemic and depending on others
[1:14:08] for your personal walk.
[1:14:10] For your personal walk, I need this
[1:14:13] person. Now understand in a body
[1:14:15] ministry and I understand that at from
[1:14:17] time that we need to have a request go
[1:14:19] in
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; but I'm telling you
[1:14:25] we need to have more of a personal
[1:14:27] relationship with God
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; to where our dependency is on God and
[1:14:33] not others
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; because God deals with the Gentiles as
[1:14:38] individuals.
[1:14:40] What a friend we have in Jesus. All our
[1:14:44] sins and griefs to bear. What a
[1:14:47] privilege to carry everything to God in
[1:14:50] prayer.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, what peace we often forfeit. Oh,
[1:14:55] what needless pain we bear all because
[1:14:58] we do not carry everything to God in
[1:15:01] prayer.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; So, the first thing we need to do is
[1:15:04] humble ourselves and pray more.
[1:15:07] And strength will come through prayer.
[1:15:10] For what? To do the second thing we got
[1:15:13] to do.
[1:15:15] And what is that?
[1:15:17] Receive the word unto obedience.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; In other words, do whatever God tells
[1:15:23] you to do.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Because it's through that obedience that
[1:15:28] you get what you want. Because that's
[1:15:30] the reason God sent the trial.
[1:15:33] God set the trial to get the thing in
[1:15:36] motion to get you to a place to
[1:15:38] communicate with him as your friend. So
[1:15:41] you obey what he wants you to do so you
[1:15:43] get the character that you need. Okay.
[1:15:45] Now, now we can answer prayer.
[1:15:49] That's why we're supposed to count it
[1:15:50] all joy when we fall into diverse
[1:15:53] temptations, all sorts of trials.
[1:15:55] Receive the word onto obedience.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; You can't just say, "Oh yeah, I said
[1:16:01] amen to the word.
[1:16:03] and don't obey it.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; You've got to obey it. We're going to
[1:16:06] get into some examples of that. Uh
[1:16:09] hopefully we can get to that later
[1:16:12] today. That means the more you say amen,
[1:16:14] the quicker we can go.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; And the and then and the the less amens
[1:16:18] then you we're going to have you'll have
[1:16:20] to bring the food in here. And
[1:16:23] all right. Romans 10:16 says Romans
[1:16:26] 10:16, but they have not all obeyed the
[1:16:31] gospel.
[1:16:33] For Isaiah saith, who have believed our
[1:16:36] report,
[1:16:37] so they heard, but they don't believe
[1:16:39] it. So then faith cometh by hearing, and
[1:16:43] hearing by the word of God.
[1:16:46] So that's why the the writer in the book
[1:16:48] of Hebrews said, "Therefore, we ought to
[1:16:49] give the more earnest heed to the things
[1:16:50] which we have heard, lest at any time we
[1:16:52] let them slip."
[1:16:55] He went on to say in chapter 4, "Let us
[1:16:57] therefore fear lest a promise being left
[1:17:00] us of entering into his rest, any of you
[1:17:03] should seem to come short of it. For
[1:17:04] unto us was the gospel preached as well
[1:17:06] as unto them." But the word preached did
[1:17:09] not profit them, not being mixed with
[1:17:13] faith in them that heard it. So God is
[1:17:16] always putting us to the test. Are you
[1:17:18] going to trust me?
[1:17:21] If if if I could do what I did to Job
[1:17:25] and he still be faithful, I'm sure that
[1:17:28] we can go through the test that we go
[1:17:30] through, which is nothing like Job, and
[1:17:32] say, "God, I'm going to trust you
[1:17:33] through this."
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; I believe that. Hebrews 3:5, if you pull
[1:17:39] that up here, Hebrews chapter 3 verse 5
[1:17:43] says, "And Moses verilely was faithful
[1:17:47] in all his house
[1:17:51] as a servant
[1:17:53] for a testimony of those things which
[1:17:57] were to be spoken afterwards."
[1:17:58] Faithfulness, did you know, is a
[1:18:00] testimony?
[1:18:02] Faithfulness is a testimony to me.
[1:18:04] Without faithfulness,
[1:18:06] you can't build a thing.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; You can't build a business.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; You can't you can't teach a person how
[1:18:12] to do their job.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; You can't get bills paid.
[1:18:17] You can't even have a decent
[1:18:18] relationship.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Faithfulness is the very foundation. We
[1:18:23] don't have that in here, but we uh used
[1:18:26] to have the the pyramid and faith is at
[1:18:28] the bottom.
[1:18:30] And you've got to be faithful. That is
[1:18:32] the most important thing for a
[1:18:35] Christian's life is to be faithful.
[1:18:41] Look at verse six.
[1:18:44] But Christ over his own house.
[1:18:47] So he's faithful over his own house.
[1:18:50] Right? Because Moses was faithful over
[1:18:53] his house for a testimony of the things
[1:18:55] which was spoken afterwards, which is
[1:18:57] Jesus Christ in Christ as a son over his
[1:19:00] own house.
[1:19:02] whose house we are. So God is faithful
[1:19:05] in our house if we hold fast the
[1:19:09] confidence and the rejoicing of hope
[1:19:12] firm to the end.
[1:19:14] Christ is faithful.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Great is thy faithfulness.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; God is faithful through our trials.
[1:19:23] The Bible says there is no temptation
[1:19:25] that have taken you but what is common
[1:19:27] to man but God is faithful who will not
[1:19:30] suffer you to be tempted above that you
[1:19:32] are able but with the temptation make a
[1:19:34] way of escape that you may be able to
[1:19:36] bear. So why would we complain? Why
[1:19:38] would we mur? Why would we just frantic
[1:19:40] and get all upset about something?
[1:19:44] God didn't put anything on you that you
[1:19:46] couldn't bear.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Why you acting like that? God ain't a
[1:19:49] liar. Don't call God a liar.
[1:19:54] Sometimes we just you don't want to say
[1:19:56] this is different, brother John. It's
[1:19:58] not different. It just God's has
[1:20:01] confidence in us. God wants to see us
[1:20:05] trust him through our trials.
[1:20:09] But Christ as a son over his own house
[1:20:14] if we hold our confidence in our friend
[1:20:18] Jesus firm to the end that he's faithful
[1:20:22] to the end that we got to rejoice in our
[1:20:25] hope to the end. Not just say well you
[1:20:28] know I'm going through a real hard trial
[1:20:29] right now. I'm just going to kind of you
[1:20:31] know sit back and you know I'm just
[1:20:33] going to kind of wait and see how things
[1:20:35] go. I'm going to I'm going to try to be
[1:20:36] neutral. I'm just going to try to, you
[1:20:38] know, I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of figure
[1:20:40] out which way.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; This is the way. Walking in it.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; We should take sides with the word.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Become a friend to the word.
[1:21:00] How can we be a friend to Jesus if we're
[1:21:02] not a friend to his word?
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; It's dropped down to verse 14. For we
[1:21:06] are made partakers of Christ if we hold
[1:21:10] the beginning of our confidence
[1:21:11] steadfast to the end. We are made
[1:21:14] partakers
[1:21:16] of an eternal friendship.
[1:21:19] Think about that. If we hold the
[1:21:22] beginning of our confidence steadfast to
[1:21:24] the end. In other words, God is going to
[1:21:26] try you.
[1:21:28] So don't think it's strange the fiery
[1:21:30] trials which are to try you.
[1:21:35] Jesus,
[1:21:37] he's a friend that stickketh closer than
[1:21:38] a brother.
[1:21:41] But he is a brother
[1:21:43] for whom he did forno. He also did
[1:21:45] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:21:47] image of his son that he might be the
[1:21:50] firstborn among many brethren. Because
[1:21:54] Christ died for us, our nature can be
[1:21:57] changed and we become just like Jesus in
[1:21:59] the image of God.
[1:22:02] And the Bible says that he's not ashamed
[1:22:03] to call me and you his brother. He's not
[1:22:07] ashamed anymore.
[1:22:10] Now brothers will talk about you. They
[1:22:13] will despise you. They will use you.
[1:22:16] They will walk all over you. They will
[1:22:18] walk away from you. But Jesus is a
[1:22:21] friend that's sticker closer than a
[1:22:22] brother.
[1:22:25] A lot of people claim Jesus as their
[1:22:27] friend. In fact, many will come to me in
[1:22:30] that day and say, "Lord, Lord, I thought
[1:22:32] we were friends.
[1:22:35] Are we not? What's going on? What what
[1:22:37] what's happening here?"
[1:22:40] Matthew 7 21, not everyone that saith
[1:22:42] unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
[1:22:44] the kingdom of heaven. Not everyone that
[1:22:47] says, I'm your friend, but he that what?
[1:22:50] Doeth the will of my father which is in
[1:22:52] heaven. The same thing that Jesus said
[1:22:54] in the opening scripture. You are my
[1:22:55] friends if you do whatsoever I command
[1:22:57] you.
[1:23:00] Many will say unto me in that day, Lord,
[1:23:02] Lord, have we not prophesied and cast
[1:23:05] out devils and did many wonderful works?
[1:23:08] You look at the 70. Look at the 70. Look
[1:23:12] at Judas. They were all in that group.
[1:23:16] And then I will profess unto them, I
[1:23:19] never knew you. Depart from me, you that
[1:23:21] work in iniquity.
[1:23:23] We didn't even have a friendship.
[1:23:26] That's what Jesus is saying. You thought
[1:23:28] we were friends because I allowed you to
[1:23:31] do this. But your heart was far from me.
[1:23:35] You did not continue to do the things
[1:23:38] that you know you should be doing.
[1:23:40] Praying, reading, coming to church,
[1:23:42] doing the things that God has already
[1:23:44] spoke to you. Now Jesus said, "All that
[1:23:46] the Father has given me, I have given to
[1:23:49] you
[1:23:51] and I've chosen you for friendship
[1:23:55] if you do whatsoever I command you." So
[1:23:59] as I'm telling you these things, you've
[1:24:01] got to do them.
[1:24:03] It's not just, you know, God said a
[1:24:04] prophet, you're in.
[1:24:09] It's about obeying what the word that
[1:24:10] God gave us through that prophet.
[1:24:13] make sure that our life is lining up.
[1:24:20] We can't be a disciple of Christ if we
[1:24:24] don't continue on in the word. We got to
[1:24:27] hold that confidence steadfast to the
[1:24:29] end. We must abide in God's word in
[1:24:32] order to maintain a friendship status
[1:24:34] with God. You can read all about it in
[1:24:37] in in in chapter 15 if you want of of
[1:24:40] St. John. It's not just a knowledge of
[1:24:43] the word because the devils believe and
[1:24:44] they tremble.
[1:24:47] They don't abide in the word. They just
[1:24:48] know the word. There's a difference. The
[1:24:52] Bible says the angels which kept not
[1:24:54] their first estate, but they left their
[1:24:56] own habitation has reserved into
[1:24:58] everlasting chains under darkness unto
[1:25:00] judgment of that great day. So the
[1:25:02] angels were there once in church. They
[1:25:05] knew the word of God. They still know it
[1:25:07] today. They did not forget it.
[1:25:10] The devils have not forgotten how things
[1:25:13] were in heaven.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; They know. That's why they can come down
[1:25:17] here in church and mimic themselves in a
[1:25:21] religious manner,
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; trying to get the attention, trying to
[1:25:25] act like something.
[1:25:28] Jesus said, "Abide in me.
[1:25:32] Abide in my word.
[1:25:36] Every branch in me that beareth not
[1:25:38] fruit of the living word, he taketh it
[1:25:40] away.
[1:25:42] He says, "Now you're clean through the
[1:25:44] word which I have spoken unto you abide
[1:25:46] in me." You cannot bear fruit of the
[1:25:50] living word of God without living
[1:25:52] without the living word inside of you.
[1:25:56] But brother Ram talked about you can go
[1:25:58] to a a seminary,
[1:26:01] spend five years learning all about God
[1:26:03] and be further away from God when you
[1:26:05] came out than when you went in.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; But if you get on your knees long enough
[1:26:10] into the presence of God comes, you can
[1:26:12] learn more about God in five minutes
[1:26:15] than you could ever in those five years.
[1:26:19] Because there's a difference between God
[1:26:21] revealing himself and you trying to
[1:26:23] figure out God, which he's already hid
[1:26:24] it from the wise and prudent.
[1:26:26] That's why there's so many churches out
[1:26:28] there baptizing the wrong way. It's
[1:26:30] because they received the word of God
[1:26:33] through a man and they didn't stay on
[1:26:35] their knees long enough until they heard
[1:26:36] from God.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; We're a blessed people.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; You are my friends if you do whatsoever
[1:26:44] I command you.
[1:26:47] Where does it put those who do not put
[1:26:50] forth the attitude
[1:26:52] to do the things that God wants them to
[1:26:54] do? Where does that put them?
[1:26:56] You're my friends if you do whatsoever I
[1:26:58] command you. What happens to those who
[1:27:00] are don't want to put forth that effort,
[1:27:02] who don't have an attitude, who have not
[1:27:04] like make it a decision that I'm going
[1:27:05] to really put God in my life?
[1:27:08] Does anybody want to know?
[1:27:11] Uh
[1:27:13] I'm going to start all over if you don't
[1:27:14] get involved here.
[1:27:18] 1 Peter chapter 4:1 17 says,
[1:27:22] "For the time is come that judgment must
[1:27:26] begin at the house of God.
[1:27:30] And if it first begin at us, what shall
[1:27:34] the end of them that obey not the gospel
[1:27:38] of God?
[1:27:40] And if the righteous scarcely be saved,
[1:27:42] where shall the ungodly and the sinner
[1:27:45] appear?
[1:27:52] They're definitely not going to be
[1:27:53] friends
[1:27:55] with God, right?
[1:27:59] No wonder Paul told the Philippian
[1:28:01] church to work out their own salvation
[1:28:03] with fear and trembling.
[1:28:06] For it is God which workketh in you both
[1:28:09] to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[1:28:11] So as God speaks to you and he's working
[1:28:13] in your heart and you have this little
[1:28:16] feeling inside, you know what, I haven't
[1:28:17] been obeying but I need to obey that.
[1:28:21] That's God working in you. He's working
[1:28:23] inside of you to do what he wants you to
[1:28:26] do. Do all those things without
[1:28:29] murmuring and disputings.
[1:28:32] Why? That you may be blameless.
[1:28:34] And look at this. Harmless.
[1:28:38] You won't hurt anybody that you may be
[1:28:40] blameless and harmless.
[1:28:44] The sons of God
[1:28:46] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[1:28:49] and perverse nation among whom you shine
[1:28:52] as lights in the world. Yeah. The whole
[1:28:54] world out there fighting, but you don't
[1:28:55] fight.
[1:28:57] The whole world is out there harming one
[1:28:59] another, but you don't because you hold
[1:29:02] God inside of you. holding forth, look
[1:29:05] at this verse 16, holding forth the word
[1:29:09] of life, that I may rejoice in the day
[1:29:11] of Christ, that I have not run in vain,
[1:29:13] neither labored in vain. You are my
[1:29:17] friends if you do whatsoever I command
[1:29:20] you. Henceforth I call you not servants,
[1:29:23] for the servant doesn't know what his
[1:29:26] Lord's doing.
[1:29:28] But I've called you friends. For all
[1:29:31] things that I've heard of my father,
[1:29:33] I've made known done unto you.
[1:29:36] Now, just just being honest. When
[1:29:40] somebody's talking to you and they say,
[1:29:42] "I want to tell you something, but you
[1:29:45] know, nobody knows this.
[1:29:49] This is this is this is just, you know,
[1:29:52] between me and you." And we've all had
[1:29:54] that experience before, right? We know
[1:29:56] what that's like, right?
[1:29:59] And when they go to tell you, don't you
[1:30:01] feel special?
[1:30:03] Like, wow, it's just me telling me, but
[1:30:08] nobody else knows. You have that special
[1:30:10] feeling. Well, here Jesus
[1:30:13] tells his friends what his father's told
[1:30:17] him, but he hasn't told anybody else.
[1:30:21] He says, "How are you going to manifest
[1:30:22] yourself to us and not to the world?
[1:30:25] What you you're going to love me. You're
[1:30:26] going to keep my commandments. I'm going
[1:30:27] to come in you. I'm going to reveal
[1:30:28] myself to you.
[1:30:30] And God, my sheep hear my voice and they
[1:30:34] follow me.
[1:30:36] And those that are not sheep don't
[1:30:38] follow. I don't know what else to say.
[1:30:40] You know, the whole Satan comes to
[1:30:42] church and he preaches the gospel.
[1:30:43] You're the sheep of God, but you don't
[1:30:45] have to follow.
[1:30:47] That's that's his gospel. You believe
[1:30:50] that you're sheep even though you don't
[1:30:52] follow.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; But that's not scriptural. So, I want to
[1:30:55] read this. This is real important. John
[1:30:57] chapter 17 verse 6.
[1:31:00] St. John chapter 17 verse number 6 Jesus
[1:31:04] says I have manifested
[1:31:14] thy name unto the men which thou gavest
[1:31:19] on to me out of the world.
[1:31:25] Thine they were and that thou gavest me
[1:31:28] and they have kept thy word.
[1:31:34] Now did Judas keep the word? No.
[1:31:40] But his disciples did. He's he's not
[1:31:43] praying for Judas here. You understand?
[1:31:46] He's just praying for the 11 right now.
[1:31:50] But he's also praying for you and I in
[1:31:52] this prayer. But here's the difference.
[1:31:55] They kept the word. They kept the word.
[1:31:58] And a real real honest, we just got to
[1:32:01] be honest with ourselves. Are we keeping
[1:32:02] the word?
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Are we just keeping part of the word or
[1:32:06] we keeping all the word? Are we keeping
[1:32:08] part of our friendship? Because if we
[1:32:10] keep part of our friendship, God looks
[1:32:12] at us as a thief and a robber. You just
[1:32:15] want my eternal life, but you don't want
[1:32:18] to do what I ask you to do.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Verse eight.
[1:32:23] For I have given unto them the words,
[1:32:27] the words which thou gavest me. I've
[1:32:31] given it to them, and they have received
[1:32:35] the words,
[1:32:37] and have known surely that I came from
[1:32:40] thee, and they have believed that thou
[1:32:43] didest send me.
[1:32:46] You are my friends, if you do whatsoever
[1:32:48] I command you. Henceforth I call you not
[1:32:53] servants, for the servant doesn't know
[1:32:55] what his lord's doing. But I've called
[1:32:57] you friends.
[1:33:00] For all things that I have heard of my
[1:33:02] father, I have made known unto you. What
[1:33:05] a privilege it is
[1:33:08] that God would share his heart with us.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; We are a blessed people.
[1:33:15] I remember when I was lost in the world,
[1:33:18] I didn't I had no idea where to even go
[1:33:21] to hear the truth. I went from church to
[1:33:24] church to church to church, church in my
[1:33:28] bedroom crying, "Lord, I don't care what
[1:33:32] church you want me to go to. Just send
[1:33:34] me to the one that has the truth."
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Because that was the only one I knew God
[1:33:41] was in.
[1:33:42] You shall know the truth and the truth
[1:33:44] shall make you free. A church can't make
[1:33:47] you free. A person can't make you free.
[1:33:50] It's God working through that person to
[1:33:52] set you free. How many believe that?
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I know time is up,
[1:33:59] but can you just give me just a few more
[1:34:02] minutes? Just a few. I think this would
[1:34:04] be a blessing.
[1:34:06] All right. Now, the book of Romans,
[1:34:09] chapter 5, teaches us
[1:34:13] that we are justified by faith. By just
[1:34:17] believing, we're justified. I'll quote
[1:34:19] it. Romans 5:1. Therefore, being
[1:34:21] justified by faith, we have peace with
[1:34:23] God through our Lord Jesus Christ. when
[1:34:25] you accept the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:34:28] you you trust God that he'll give you
[1:34:32] you get you just automatically get peace
[1:34:35] when you become justified. You know your
[1:34:37] sins have been taken away just as if you
[1:34:40] never did it. That's what the real peace
[1:34:42] of God is. Now James was talking about
[1:34:45] this same justification
[1:34:48] uh and he said our our justification
[1:34:51] starts out with faith but faith must
[1:34:53] continue to manifest works.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me so far?
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; So he wasn't really um
[1:35:01] talking about something different. It
[1:35:04] was the same justification,
[1:35:06] but it starts out with faith. But God
[1:35:08] has this expectation that you got to
[1:35:10] start working out what you believe. You
[1:35:14] can't just sit there and say, "I believe
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; because the devils do that." And they're
[1:35:18] not justified. So James chap 2 21 says,
[1:35:22] "Was not Abraham our father justified
[1:35:26] by works
[1:35:28] when he offered Isaac his son upon the
[1:35:30] altar?" So remember God, it was imputed
[1:35:34] unto him for righteousness prior to
[1:35:35] that. But it wasn't until he took his
[1:35:38] son up on the the the mountain and he
[1:35:41] was getting ready to offer him these
[1:35:42] works. Okay, God, if you this is what
[1:35:44] you want me to do, I'm going to do it.
[1:35:46] And then God stayed his hand and said,
[1:35:47] "Now I know that you love me. Now I
[1:35:50] know." And it was through that process
[1:35:53] that God that that James is saying
[1:35:55] that's what justified him. Now I know
[1:35:57] it's it's done.
[1:36:00] And in verse 22, seeest thou how faith
[1:36:03] wrought his works. It faith brought his
[1:36:06] works into full justification, and that
[1:36:09] by works was faith made perfect. Now, I
[1:36:12] know the scripture talks about that we
[1:36:14] can never be justified by works.
[1:36:19] Because you can't do work without
[1:36:21] believing. You can't burn candles. You
[1:36:23] can't do this. You can't do all these
[1:36:24] things and say, "I'm justified because I
[1:36:26] did it." Because like Martin Luther
[1:36:30] said, you know, the just shall live by
[1:36:32] faith.
[1:36:34] But the thing is, if you truly believe,
[1:36:36] then you'll have a life behind it.
[1:36:39] You'll have works to follow it. And if
[1:36:41] God asks you to do something, you're
[1:36:42] just going to do it.
[1:36:45] Verse 23. And the scripture was
[1:36:46] fulfilled which saith Abraham believed
[1:36:50] God,
[1:36:52] and it was imputed unto him for
[1:36:54] righteousness, and he was called what?
[1:36:57] the friend of God. That's why I wanted
[1:37:00] to read this. Abraham, a friend of God,
[1:37:04] because he continued to obey the word of
[1:37:06] God. He didn't just sit there and say,
[1:37:09] "I believe I'm not going to do
[1:37:10] anything." He held his faith for 25
[1:37:13] years. Praise God. You talk about
[1:37:16] somebody that you think he had something
[1:37:18] to complain about like like uh maybe
[1:37:20] Job, but I don't know how long Job's
[1:37:23] trial was, but Abraham, he's the father
[1:37:25] of our faith. I think Job didn't even
[1:37:28] have Abraham to to read at that time. If
[1:37:31] I understand that correctly,
[1:37:35] we're blessed.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; The father of our faith was a friend of
[1:37:39] God. And if we walk in the steps of our
[1:37:41] father Abraham, we too can become the
[1:37:44] friend that Abraham was to God.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; I want to be called, honestly, I want to
[1:37:49] be called a friend of God. Amen.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Now God said, "I can't keep my secrets
[1:37:55] from Abraham." Because
[1:37:58] seeing he is the heir of the earth.
[1:38:00] Remember remember
[1:38:02] God could not keep his secret from
[1:38:05] Abraham. God would do nothing except he
[1:38:08] revealed his secrets to his servants,
[1:38:09] the prophets. Abraham walked in
[1:38:12] obedience. God had this relationship
[1:38:14] that everything that the father has uh
[1:38:17] uh that that the father knew, he told
[1:38:19] Abraham. He kept no secrets. Here's the
[1:38:22] thing I want to say. God doesn't keep
[1:38:24] secrets from his bride.
[1:38:27] We just got to get in the position that
[1:38:29] we get more serious with God. If we want
[1:38:32] to know God, God wants to reveal
[1:38:33] himself.
[1:38:35] Okay. Verse 24. Three more verses and
[1:38:37] we're done. Seeing you see then how that
[1:38:40] by works a man is justified and not by
[1:38:43] faith only.
[1:38:45] Like likewise also was not Rahab the
[1:38:48] harlot justified by works when she
[1:38:50] received the messengers and had sent
[1:38:52] them out the other way. Remember Rahab
[1:38:55] believed.
[1:38:57] She believed
[1:38:59] but she wasn't justified through her
[1:39:01] belief. She actually had to start
[1:39:02] obeying the word.
[1:39:04] For as the body without the spirit is
[1:39:06] dead, so faith without works is dead
[1:39:10] also. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand
[1:39:13] together. I want to I want to be counted
[1:39:16] worthy to escape this world, this world
[1:39:20] of unbelief and be called God's friend.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:35] Let's sing that little chorus. Let go
[1:39:36] and let God have his wonderful way.
[1:39:41] Let go and let God have his wonderful
[1:39:48] way.
[1:39:50] Let go and let God have his way.
[1:39:56] [Applause]
[1:39:58] Your sorrows will vanish. Your night
[1:40:03] turn to day. Let go and let God have his
[1:40:10] way.
[1:40:13] Let go and let God have his wonderful
[1:40:19] way. Let go and let God have his way.
[1:40:28] Your sorrows will vanish. Your night
[1:40:33] turn to day. Let go and let God have his
[1:40:40] way.
[1:40:43] Let go and let God have his wonderful
[1:40:50] way. Let go and let God have his way.
[1:40:58] Your sorrows will vanish. Your night
[1:41:03] turn today.
[1:41:06] Let go and let God have his
