[14:29] to take up the uh the prayer request at
[14:32] this time. There's one request that was
[14:35] written in from Sister Donna and she
[14:39] said, "Remember brother Johnson. He's in
[14:42] the U of M hospital.
[14:45] Let's remember to pray for him. It was
[14:47] so good to see him here when he was here
[14:50] and he did tell me that he's losing
[14:52] strength. So, let's remember to pray for
[14:55] his strength and whatever the need is
[14:57] there. Also, uh brother Bob Kova Koba is
[15:04] was called into
[15:06] uh called in hospice today. So that is
[15:11] uh obviously not a good sign and more
[15:16] than ever we need to pray for brother
[15:19] Bob Kova.
[15:23] Amen. Let's also remember to pray for
[15:27] the others that have been battling
[15:29] cancer as I know that you have been.
[15:33] Let's just hold them up in prayer today
[15:36] uh as we join together. It's so good to
[15:40] see uh Sister Linda Helms here. There's
[15:42] many prayers that have been gone up in
[15:45] her behalf. And let's pray for the Lord
[15:48] to uh encourage her as she's been going
[15:52] through these um physical uh test. And

[16:27] his encouragement as well. Amen. Let's
[16:30] pray for all of our missionaries. Amen.
[16:33] Amen. Amen. It's uh we don't always we I
[16:37] can say this for surely we do not have
[16:38] all the money that we need to help them.
[16:41] But one thing we do have is we do
[16:43] believe in prayer. Amen. God is able to
[16:46] use our prayers tonight to meet the
[16:48] needs. So let's remember to pray for
[16:50] them. Let's pray for brother Marty and
[16:53] and and brother Ron uh sister Lori um
[16:58] that God would be with them as they're
[17:00] away. And um let's pray for these that
[17:04] want to get baptized. They've been
[17:06] requesting it again. And it's so good to
[17:08] see a hunger there. And let's just pray
[17:11] that when they do get baptized, it is
[17:15] the perfect moment that they're
[17:18] prepared. That's right. And they want to
[17:20] put the past behind them and they want
[17:22] to walk in newness of life. So let's
[17:25] pray for them. Amen. And you know, even
[17:28] after we do that, we have a battle,
[17:29] don't we? That's right. And if we're
[17:32] we're not we're not careful, we can slip
[17:34] back in the old ways. So let's let's
[17:38] stand together. We want to pray for
[17:40] brother Bruce tonight that God would
[17:43] anoint him with the Holy Spirit to give
[17:47] us what we have need of. Amen. I do

[35:28] out your hand to us, Lord, and you
[35:32] brought us into your courts. You brought
[35:35] us close to
[35:36] yourself, Lord. There was nothing good
[35:38] that we could do. And we just pray,
[35:41] Father, that you'll just come tonight.
[35:43] You'll cleanse our hearts. You'll
[35:45] cleanse us. And, Father, that you'll
[35:47] come and administer grace and strength
[35:50] to us. Yes, Lord. Lord, may you just
[35:52] bless, Father, Lord, the service.
[35:56] Pray that you'll just break the bread of
[35:57] life to us and that you just give us
[35:59] grace. We need you, Lord. In Jesus
[36:02] Christ's name we ask it. Amen. Amen. You
[36:06] may be
[36:07] seated. So, uh, the other day I was
[36:10] listening to a message called The
[36:13] Position of a Believer in Christ. Um, it
[36:18] was preached in 1955. there was some
[36:20] really outstanding things in there. Um,
[36:23] but then when I wanted to bring those
[36:26] things, then I ended up looking at some
[36:29] other things. So, I'd like to hope that
[36:33] this helps you.
[36:36] Amen.
[36:38] So, this is the text brother Brandham
[36:40] took out of Ephesians 1. So he says now
[36:44] he's pre he's presenting it to them
[36:46] which are at Ephesus to the faithful in
[36:49] Christ Jesus. Now watch he said this
[36:52] letter that first he was an apostle by
[36:55] the will of God. God called him to be an
[36:57] apostle and he said to those that are in
[37:00] Ephesus in Christ Jesus. And we know
[37:03] that that after Judas had um committed
[37:08] suicide and then Jesus was crucified and
[37:11] he rose from the dead. disciples, they
[37:13] got together and they they prayed and
[37:17] they cast lots. And what more can you do
[37:20] than that? They prayed and they believed
[37:23] that the Lord would would let the lots
[37:25] fall on the one that God had chosen. And
[37:29] the lot fell on Matus. And of course, we
[37:32] know that's the only time we hear about
[37:33] him, right? Because God later on chose
[37:37] Paul. So, brother, so Paul here, he
[37:40] said, so he said he was he was talking
[37:44] he says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ
[37:47] by the will of God to the saints which
[37:49] are at Ephesus and to the faithful in
[37:52] Christ Jesus. So now just to the whole
[37:56] now see he says today the American
[37:58] version of it is it sent to the whole
[38:00] nation. When people read the book of
[38:03] Ephesus, they say, "Oh, that it's it's
[38:05] to everybody." And he says, and then he
[38:08] says, "Well, people think that it's to a
[38:10] place or to a city or or just to a
[38:13] church." But Paul never only sent it to
[38:15] the church. He sent it to those that
[38:18] were in Christ Jesus. That's what the
[38:21] letter was for. Not for the outsider,
[38:23] but for those in Christ. Amen. And in
[38:27] the original to the faithful in Christ
[38:29] it means in Christ Jesus denoting a
[38:32] fixed position
[38:34] and that is a relationship of rest. So a
[38:38] couple weeks ago when brother Alex was
[38:41] here he preached on on how that the
[38:44] Christians walk is based on rest.
[38:47] But Paul writing here, he said, well, he
[38:51] says this is to the faithful and the
[38:54] believer has to have a fixed position in
[38:58] the body of Christ. You can't be just be
[39:01] flopping around like a fish on the, you
[39:03] know,
[39:05] we're not doing that. Now, if you've got
[39:07] a Scoffield Bible, I always thought this
[39:10] was interesting, so I want to read it
[39:11] again, but Scoffield said, "Indeed, the
[39:15] words to the Ephesians is not even in
[39:17] the best manuscripts." If you go to
[39:20] Colossians 4:16 mentions an epistle
[39:23] written to the Lady Osans, and it has
[39:26] been conjectured that the letter known
[39:27] to us as Ephesians is really a letter to
[39:30] the Lady Oans. probably it was sent to
[39:33] Ephesus and Lady Hosea without even
[39:35] being addressed to any church. The
[39:38] letter then would be to the saints and
[39:40] the faithful in Christ Jesus anywhere.
[39:45] Amen. So, brother Adam said in the
[39:48] message why he says, "So that's one
[39:49] thing that's hurt our Pentecostal move
[39:52] and other moves is somebody trying to be
[39:54] something that they're not. They are
[39:56] trying to impersonate someone else. And
[39:59] you can't do that. You're just what you
[40:02] are. That's all. And when you do that,
[40:04] God then will use you just as where you
[40:08] are. So we are all aspiring and and
[40:14] brother John, you know, preaches that,
[40:16] you know, you're aspiring to a character
[40:20] change. But Jesus said, he said, "What
[40:23] man by a thought can add one foot to his
[40:27] cubid? Can I change my hair color? Can I
[40:29] change the way I look by just by looking
[40:31] at it or anything else? God has to do
[40:34] the work.
[40:35] Amen. So when we brother random said he
[40:38] said so the problem is he says we try to
[40:41] impersonate someone else and a lot of
[40:43] times we're trying to impersonate Jesus
[40:46] Christ. I mean that's what it really he
[40:49] says just be who you are. Don't do that.
[40:52] God will use you. Whatever level you're
[40:55] at, God will use you if you can just
[40:58] trust in him because you're just as
[41:01] important as anybody else. As I said the
[41:04] other night, the little bitty hairspring
[41:05] in a watch is just as important as the
[41:07] main spring because it takes us all
[41:10] together to make time. And when we
[41:13] realize our position in Christ and then
[41:15] abide in that, well, if you're just a
[41:18] little housewife, just stay right there.
[41:21] That's what God wants you to do. See,
[41:23] just be what you are. So, brother Bradom
[41:27] said, "So, now the first thing we want
[41:28] to know is this epistle, would it be
[41:32] essential for us today?" So, let's find
[41:35] out how you get in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[41:38] So, we want to go to 1 Corinthians
[41:42] 12. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[41:47] In 1 Corinthians 12 and verse 12 it
[41:50] says, "For as for as the body is one and
[41:54] hath many members and all the members of
[41:56] that one body being many are one body,
[42:00] so also is Christ. For by one spirit are
[42:04] we all baptized into one body. Whether
[42:07] we be Jew or Gentile, whether we be bond
[42:11] or free, we have been all made to drink
[42:14] into one spirit. Amen. Amen. And brother
[42:18] Brandman questions and answers on on
[42:21] Hebrews, he says he says by one spirit
[42:24] we're all baptized into the body of
[42:27] Christ. Now you all remember that that
[42:29] was the question I was on and now that's
[42:31] found of course in 1 Corinthians 12 when
[42:35] and he asked this person that wrote this
[42:38] question said at that time when we
[42:41] receive the new birth does this take
[42:45] place is is the baptism of the Holy
[42:48] Spirit the new birth or is there a later
[42:52] baptism or is it a
[42:54] filling? Amen.
[42:57] Now, that's quite a question and we
[42:59] could spend the rest of our time right
[43:01] on that and tonight, tomorrow night and
[43:03] so forth and it would cover it would it
[43:05] would take and tie the entire Bible
[43:07] together. Every scripture must properly
[43:09] tie together with every scripture in the
[43:11] Bible. But just trying to make it just
[43:14] as briefly plain as I know how to make
[43:17] it so. No. When you believe on the Lord
[43:20] Jesus Christ, you then have the new
[43:23] birth.
[43:24] When you believe on the Lord, you
[43:26] receive a new thought, a new life, but
[43:29] it isn't the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[43:32] See, you've got the new birth when you
[43:35] believe. You've got eternal life. It's a
[43:37] gift of God that's given to you through
[43:40] sovereign grace by accepting the gift of
[43:43] God that's given to you. He that heareth
[43:46] my words and believeth on him that sent
[43:48] me hath eternal life, has everlasting
[43:51] life. That's the new birth. If you're
[43:53] converted, it means you've turned
[43:55] around. Of course, that's John
[43:58] 5:24. He says, "But the baptism of the
[44:00] Holy Ghost puts you into the body of
[44:04] Christ, subject to the gifts for
[44:06] service." Now, when brother Brennan was
[44:08] preaching this, he spent a lot of times
[44:11] in 1 Corinthians 12. And 1 Corinthians
[44:15] 12 is mainly talking about the gifts of
[44:18] the spirit, but it also talks more about
[44:22] you and me and how we are in the
[44:26] body. So watch, brother Brandham says
[44:31] the baptism of the Holy Spirit puts you
[44:34] into the body of Christ subject to the
[44:37] gifts. And now as far as having eternal
[44:40] life and being a Christian, you are a
[44:43] Christian the moment you believe.
[44:46] Now that's not make believe. That's
[44:48] truly believe on the Lord Jesus and
[44:51] accept him as your personal savior. You
[44:54] are born again right there and have
[44:56] eternal life. God comes to you. So now
[44:59] watch eternal life. Jesus said, "He that
[45:02] heareth my words and believeth on him
[45:05] that sent me hath eternal life and shall
[45:07] not come into the judgment, but has
[45:09] passed from death unto life." And this
[45:12] is the next point that he makes is quite
[45:16] outstanding. It's something you really
[45:17] need to listen to. He says, "You're a
[45:21] new creature." Right?
[45:23] Then then Paul had met some of these
[45:27] people up in Acts 19.
[45:30] They had them there a preacher up there
[45:32] that was a converted lawyer by the name
[45:34] of Apollos. And Apollos was a mighty man
[45:37] in the scriptures and he was proving by
[45:39] the scriptures that Jesus was the
[45:41] Christ.
[45:43] See, so he was taking the Old Testament
[45:45] and he was preaching the Old Testament
[45:47] to them and they were hearing the word
[45:50] of God and they were believing that
[45:54] Jesus Christ was the fulfillment of the
[45:56] scriptures and based on that they had
[46:00] the new
[46:01] birth. They they were rejoicing in that.
[46:05] They were cleaning up their lives. They
[46:07] were following the light that they were
[46:09] walking in. But they did not have the
[46:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[46:17] They had a preacher up there that was a
[46:19] converted lawyer by the name of Apollos.
[46:22] And Apollos was a mighty man in the
[46:23] scripture. And he was proving by the
[46:25] scriptures that Jesus was the Christ. So
[46:28] he says, now watch, Apollos through the
[46:31] word was proving by the word and faith
[46:34] cometh by hearing, hearing by the word.
[46:37] And he that heareth my word and
[46:38] believeth on him that sent me has
[46:42] everlasting life. You get it? Apollos by
[46:45] the word was proving and these were
[46:48] Christians. They were followers. They
[46:50] were disciples. And Apollos was proving
[46:53] by the word that Jesus was the Christ.
[46:55] And they had great joy and received the
[46:57] word yet knowing only the baptism of
[47:01] John.
[47:03] And when Paul passed through the upper
[47:04] coast of Ephesus, he found these
[47:07] disciples and he asked them this
[47:09] question. Have you received the Holy
[47:12] Ghost since you believed? Amen.
[47:16] So often we come so
[47:19] far. We, you know, we we come to a point
[47:22] in our lives where we want to accept
[47:25] Jesus Christ as my personal savior. And
[47:27] you raise your hand. And if you do it
[47:29] with all your heart, that's what brother
[47:31] Brandham said.
[47:32] He said, "You get the new birth and you
[47:35] get eternal life,
[47:37] but the Holy
[47:39] Ghost places you in the body."
[47:45] Now, these people up in the upper coast
[47:47] of Ephesus, they were hearing the word.
[47:50] It was being preached to them and they
[47:52] were believing it and it was changing
[47:54] their lives. It was actually changing
[47:56] their lives, but they were not
[47:58] positionally placed in the body without
[48:02] the Holy
[48:03] Ghost. Amen.
[48:07] Amen. So he says, "So now when you
[48:10] believe, Jesus said you have eternal
[48:13] life. That's the new birth. That's your
[48:15] conversion. You're changing. But the
[48:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the power
[48:20] of God that you're baptized with." Amen.
[48:24] So the question is and this is it's
[48:27] important to know this
[48:30] because there is a lot of other things
[48:32] that you looked at and wondered at all
[48:34] of a sudden they all start lining up and
[48:37] you go
[48:38] ah now I
[48:41] see
[48:42] amen so he said the question is let's
[48:45] answer this just one by one there's
[48:47] three questions by one spirit we are all
[48:50] baptized into the body of Christ well
[48:52] that's correct 1 Corinthians Ians 12
[48:54] will give the answer to that. All right.
[48:57] And at that time we receive the new
[48:59] birth. This takes place. Does that is
[49:02] that it? That's what they want to know.
[49:05] And he goes, "Well, no. No. By one
[49:08] spirit, we're all baptized into one
[49:11] body." See, that isn't it. When the new
[49:14] birth begins, the new birth begins when
[49:18] you believe on the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[49:21] Now you see there is not one more thing.
[49:26] Now listen what can you do besides
[49:32] believe? What more can you do? So we we
[49:35] have a list of saints believers. So well
[49:40] they're not part of our body but Bob Kov
[49:42] is a Christian. I've sat down and talked
[49:44] with him many times. He he he he makes
[49:47] me walk away and I go, "Wow, I wish I
[49:50] had his
[49:51] faith." But what more can I do for him?
[49:56] What more can we do for sister Linda
[49:59] than pray for
[50:02] her? And watch how brother Brandham
[50:04] talks. We pray for people and we
[50:07] believe,
[50:09] right? If you don't believe, you
[50:11] shouldn't be praying.
[50:13] As a young Christian, that was a
[50:16] scripture that I heard. I read it. I
[50:19] said, "Oh, I'm gonna I'm keeping that."
[50:22] At Lazarus's
[50:23] tomb, Jesus made this statement. He
[50:27] said, "Father, I thank thee that you
[50:30] always hear my
[50:34] prayer." Don't ever think that God
[50:39] doesn't hear your prayers.
[50:42] He always hears your prayer.
[50:48] But what can you do besides believe?
[50:51] What more can you do? You can what what
[50:54] can you do about it any more than just
[50:57] believe? Tell me one thing you can do.
[51:00] There's not one thing that you can do
[51:02] outside of believing. And if anything
[51:05] comes outside of your
[51:08] believing, it isn't an act of you. It's
[51:12] an act of God.
[51:16] So when you pray, you pray
[51:19] believing. And then if God does a
[51:23] miracle, it's God that did the miracle.
[51:25] You didn't do the miracle. That's right.
[51:27] When you listen to the prayer line and
[51:28] brother Brandham, he's talking and
[51:30] before he says, you know, he'll finish
[51:32] his message and he'll be preaching with
[51:34] authority and everything else and then
[51:35] he just kind of stops and he just starts
[51:38] talking and all of a sudden I after you
[51:40] listen to so many tapes, you realize
[51:42] that brother Brandham was so helpless.
[51:47] It was just absolutely helpless. But he
[51:50] only had a promise. He had a promise. If
[51:54] you get the people to believe, I'll come
[51:56] down. But he and he actually tells you,
[51:59] he says, I'm not saying he will, but he
[52:02] always
[52:03] did. He always came. And
[52:07] we want to have that in our lives,
[52:11] right?
[52:13] So, just kind of stick with me. So,
[52:18] there's not one thing that you can do
[52:19] outside of believing. If anything comes
[52:22] outside of your believing, it isn't an
[52:25] act of your own. It's an act of God.
[52:27] Therefore, by one spirit, we are
[52:30] baptized into one body. That's correct.
[52:33] See, the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a
[52:36] different act from the new birth.
[52:41] Unfortunately, we get as far as coming
[52:44] in and and repenting of our sins and
[52:47] getting baptized and the word of God. We
[52:50] start to hear the word of God and we
[52:52] believe the word of God and we rejoice
[52:54] in it and we go ahead and things start
[52:58] getting cleaned up in our lives and
[52:59] everything else, but we forget if you
[53:02] don't have the baptism of the Holy
[53:04] Ghost, you're not placed in the body.
[53:07] Amen. Amen.
[53:11] Amen. The Holy Ghost is a different act
[53:14] from the new birth. One is a birth, one
[53:16] is a baptism. One brings you eternal
[53:20] life. The other one gives you power.
[53:24] Now, it gives you power into eternal
[53:27] life. See? To operate. Now, you got it.
[53:31] Okay. All right. So, so let's take a
[53:33] look at a couple things. Let's go to
[53:36] Matthew 7.
[53:39] Amen.
[53:47] So we have to lay a couple of things
[53:49] down before we go to the next part. He
[53:50] says in verse 15, he says, "Be fair,
[53:53] beware of false prophets which come to
[53:56] you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly
[53:58] they are ravening wolves.
[54:01] Now you shall know them by their
[54:04] fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns
[54:07] or figs of thistles. Even so every good
[54:11] tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a
[54:13] corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
[54:16] And a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[54:19] fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring
[54:21] forth good fruit. Every tree that
[54:24] bringeth not fruit forth good fruit is
[54:27] heuned down and cast into the fire.
[54:31] Wherefore by your fruits you shall know
[54:33] them. We all know these scriptures. We
[54:37] know that. But now let's take a look. So
[54:40] we've we know that we are to
[54:43] judge by
[54:45] fruits, right? We see look kind of
[54:49] fruits. So let's go here to Romans
[54:53] 7. And and there's just hundreds of
[54:57] scriptures, but we just chose just a
[55:02] couple. Romans 7:5 says this, "For when
[55:07] we were in the flesh, the motions of sin
[55:11] which were by the law did work in our
[55:14] members to bring forth fruit unto
[55:17] death." How many here are no longer in
[55:20] their flesh?
[55:23] We're stuck here.
[55:26] We are in our flesh.
[55:30] Now, so in the original, it says when we
[55:34] were in the flesh, those sinful passions
[55:37] which were through the law worked in our
[55:39] members to bring forth fruit unto death.
[55:44] So we know that there was a there is
[55:47] fruit that is this sticky. Brother
[55:50] Brandon said it was a sticky old pest
[55:51] house nature that we will not we will
[55:56] never until this body change comes. The
[55:59] truth
[56:01] that when the body change comes, you
[56:03] will no longer be sinful flesh. But you
[56:06] are sinful flesh. You are stuck in it.
[56:10] So let's go to Galatians
[56:13] 5. Amen.
[56:19] Galatians 5 verse 16 says this I say
[56:24] then walk in the spirit and ye shall not
[56:28] fulfill the lust of the flesh.
[56:33] What more can you
[56:35] do than believe?
[56:41] You cannot walk in the spirit unless
[56:45] it's God doing the walking. That is the
[56:49] truth.
[56:51] You can believe the word. You can
[56:53] believe that. You can rejoice in
[56:56] that. But you can't walk in the spirit
[56:59] unless God does the walking.
[57:03] Amen.
[57:06] He says because he says walk in the
[57:08] spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[57:10] lust or the desires of the flesh because
[57:12] your flesh is just totally it's unruly.
[57:15] The scripture says so it's unruly. It it
[57:18] no man can conquer it. In James he talks
[57:20] about the tongue being a a
[57:23] a flint of fire and it it causes you
[57:27] know I'm sure all of us have good
[57:29] tongues right?
[57:32] See, but if your tongue ever obeys the
[57:35] word of God, it's not because of you
[57:37] believing. It's because God has gotten
[57:41] control of your tongue. Amen.
[57:45] So watch what he says here. See, he
[57:47] says, so he says, "The flesh lusteth
[57:51] against the spirit." This body doesn't
[57:54] you get this body my my pride and my my
[57:59] intelligence and everything else doesn't
[58:02] want the spirit of God to tell me what
[58:06] to do
[58:07] the truth
[58:09] and the
[58:10] spirit is contrary to the flesh and
[58:14] these are contrary the one to another so
[58:16] that you cannot do the things that you
[58:21] would. Many people have come as far as
[58:24] believing and got to the new birth and
[58:27] drunk of the spirit, but they never can
[58:30] get any farther because they've never
[58:32] come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[58:36] They've never come the next step.
[58:40] Because without the baptism of the Holy
[58:42] Ghost, the word of God can't live.
[58:46] It can't come alive.
[58:53] He says, "Because they're contrary one
[58:55] to another, so that you cannot do the
[58:57] things that you would. But if you be led
[58:59] of the spirit, you are not under the
[59:03] law. And the works of the flesh are
[59:05] manifest, which are these." And all of
[59:08] these works, all of these things that he
[59:11] mentions are things that you can do
[59:14] without any effort
[59:16] whatsoever because you're born with
[59:18] them. You're born with it. You're born
[59:22] with adultery. You're born with
[59:24] fornication and uncleanliness and
[59:26] obsliviousness and idolatry and
[59:29] witchcraft and hatred and variance and
[59:31] emulations and wrath and strife,
[59:33] seditions and heresies and envying and
[59:36] murderers and drunkenness and revilings
[59:38] and the such like of which I tell you
[59:40] before as I have told you in the time
[59:42] past that they which do such things
[59:46] shall not inherit the kingdom of God. So
[59:49] now the question becomes go well well I
[59:51] don't stand a chance.
[59:53] Well if you don't get the bapt well if
[59:57] you believe the word of God brother
[1:00:00] Brandham said Jesus said you have
[1:00:02] eternal
[1:00:04] life. So there's I got something I want
[1:00:07] to let you think about.
[1:00:10] So he says, "But the fruit of the
[1:00:12] spirit is love, joy, peace,
[1:00:15] longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
[1:00:18] faith, meekness, temperance. Against
[1:00:21] such there is no law. Everything that's
[1:00:24] in verse 22 and verse 23, you can do in
[1:00:28] the
[1:00:31] flesh. You can do all those things if
[1:00:34] you believe it. You can have
[1:00:36] longsuffering. You can try. You can you
[1:00:39] can say, "Oh, the word tells me I should
[1:00:41] be long-suffering. I'm going to suffer
[1:00:43] along with this brother. The word of God
[1:00:46] tells me I should love my enemy, and I'm
[1:00:49] going to love my
[1:00:51] enemy." And you can produce these
[1:00:56] attributes. You can do
[1:01:00] that meekness. You can you can make
[1:01:02] yourself meek. You can do all these
[1:01:05] things.
[1:01:06] And he says, "They that are
[1:01:09] Christs, they have crucified the flesh
[1:01:12] with the affections and
[1:01:14] lust." But look what he says. If we live
[1:01:16] in the spirit, let us also walk in the
[1:01:19] spirit. Tell me how you can do
[1:01:22] that. How can you do that? All I can do
[1:01:26] is believe that that's the most thing
[1:01:28] that I can bring to God is my belief
[1:01:32] that he will keep his word.
[1:01:35] Amen.
[1:01:41] So, didn't want to do
[1:01:44] that. Now, my notes got they're about
[1:01:46] this big right now. There we
[1:01:49] go. So, now listen carefully.
[1:01:54] Like what if I'd go out here today and I
[1:01:56] brought down some of the great northern
[1:01:58] wines sap apples and I tried them. I
[1:02:02] tied them into a palm tree and I said
[1:02:04] now look here. What a fine apple tree I
[1:02:07] got. Well that's true. There's the tree
[1:02:11] and there are apples hanging on it but
[1:02:14] it isn't a product of the tree.
[1:02:17] Now, brother Brandham claim plainly
[1:02:20] taught us that Jesus was one tree, the
[1:02:24] woman was the other tree. And it's not
[1:02:27] beyond my understanding or we are all
[1:02:30] trees, every one of us.
[1:02:34] And we
[1:02:37] have put on
[1:02:39] us love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:02:42] gentleness, kindness, and said,
[1:02:45] "Look, by their fruits, you know
[1:02:49] them." But brother Brandham says, "Yes,
[1:02:53] that's true. There's the tree. There's
[1:02:56] apples hanging on it, but it's not the
[1:03:00] product of the tree.
[1:03:05] Amen. It's not the product of the tree.
[1:03:09] There you are through faith. You could
[1:03:12] do great
[1:03:14] things, which is 1 Corinthians
[1:03:17] 13. You could you could give your body
[1:03:20] to be burned and it would be a wonderful
[1:03:22] thing. You could give your you could you
[1:03:25] could do you could feed the poor. You
[1:03:27] could do all these things, but it's not
[1:03:29] a product of the tree.
[1:03:36] You could do great things, but you're
[1:03:38] not born again of the spirit of God. All
[1:03:43] right. Did you know that a little orange
[1:03:45] tree about that big, about a half inch
[1:03:48] high, has every orange in it that it'll
[1:03:51] ever
[1:03:54] have? Here's something else to think
[1:03:56] about.
[1:03:57] When's the last time you went and bought
[1:03:59] an orange at a grocery store that had
[1:04:01] seeds in
[1:04:04] it? We are eating all hybrid oranges and
[1:04:09] we say, "Wow, this orange really tastes
[1:04:12] great." But if you open it up, there
[1:04:14] ain't no seed in it. But I remember when
[1:04:16] I was in eighth grade in that in school,
[1:04:18] you'd have a seed. You spit the seed
[1:04:20] out. But we've so perfected it that the
[1:04:23] seed's not there and we just we just eat
[1:04:26] them oranges.
[1:04:29] I just wonder how many of us have really
[1:04:31] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:04:33] been placed in the body.
[1:04:38] So he says, now look, he says, "Did you
[1:04:40] know that a little orange tree about
[1:04:42] that big, about a half inch high, has
[1:04:43] every orange in it that it'll ever have?
[1:04:46] Is that right? You take that little
[1:04:49] orange tree and you plant it. And the
[1:04:52] only thing you have to do then is water
[1:04:54] it. And that little orange tree has to
[1:04:58] drink the
[1:04:59] water. The fruit is not in the water.
[1:05:04] The fruit is not in the ground. The
[1:05:07] fruit is in the
[1:05:11] tree. The fruit is in the tree. And the
[1:05:15] only thing the tree does is first it's
[1:05:18] got to be planted and then it has to
[1:05:21] drink and it has to drink more than its
[1:05:24] portion. And if you plant and this
[1:05:27] little tree begins to draw, it will just
[1:05:29] drink till it can't drink no more. Then
[1:05:32] it drinks a little bit more than that.
[1:05:35] And when it does that, it pushes
[1:05:37] out. We're getting ready for spring. You
[1:05:40] already see the maple trees. I've
[1:05:42] already got them tapped. But we're going
[1:05:44] to have buds pretty soon because the sap
[1:05:47] is running in the tree and that tree
[1:05:50] can't do anything else but produce the
[1:05:54] life of the tree.
[1:06:00] Amen.
[1:06:03] And if you plant and this little tree
[1:06:06] begins to draw, then it pushes out and
[1:06:08] then it pushes out limbs. Then it pushes
[1:06:11] out leaves. Then it pushes out oranges,
[1:06:14] bushes, bushels and bushels and bushels
[1:06:17] and hundreds of bushels comes out of
[1:06:19] that
[1:06:21] tree. So when I think of Galatians 5, I
[1:06:25] realize that I was born in sin shapen in
[1:06:29] iniquity. Amen. Right?
[1:06:33] As long as you live in this body, you
[1:06:36] will do the works of the
[1:06:39] flesh. If you believe the word of God,
[1:06:42] Brother Brandham said, God will honor
[1:06:45] that and give you the new birth.
[1:06:48] He will give you eternal
[1:06:51] life. But you've got to go and get the
[1:06:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost in order to be
[1:06:58] placed in the
[1:07:00] body. You will only be
[1:07:03] putting peacock
[1:07:06] feathers. That's all you do because
[1:07:09] inside you're still just a crow.
[1:07:12] That's all you are.
[1:07:14] And you can believe and you can and you
[1:07:16] can you can manufacture longsuffering
[1:07:19] and you can manufacture peace and you
[1:07:21] you can manufacture peace where the
[1:07:22] inside you're ready to just blow up. The
[1:07:25] truth and it shows that you've never
[1:07:29] come to have the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:31] Ghost.
[1:07:34] Brother Benham said when Paul went to
[1:07:36] the upper coast of Ephesus, he said
[1:07:37] there were these believers. They were
[1:07:40] rejoicing in the word of God. They were
[1:07:42] rejoicing that Jesus had fulfilled the
[1:07:45] scriptures. They were doing all these
[1:07:47] things, but they didn't they didn't have
[1:07:52] power. Once you think about it, we
[1:07:55] want what we think is power.
[1:08:00] We want Mark 16 because we think that's
[1:08:05] power. The
[1:08:07] disciples had power and not the Holy
[1:08:11] Ghost. Amen. Amen. It's the truth.
[1:08:16] They were elected. God picked them up.
[1:08:19] He placed them in the body. He took them
[1:08:22] everywhere. They didn't they couldn't
[1:08:25] even even when
[1:08:28] Peter
[1:08:29] Peter looking at
[1:08:32] Jesus could not give himself a
[1:08:35] revelation that that was the
[1:08:38] Christ. God, brother Brandham, see
[1:08:41] that's why we read that quote. He said,
[1:08:43] "What more can you do than believe?" And
[1:08:45] there's nothing wrong with believing.
[1:08:46] Not one thing.
[1:08:50] But he told his disciples, he said,
[1:08:52] "After I'm gone, go and get the Holy
[1:08:56] Ghost.
[1:08:58] Don't do anything else but get the Holy
[1:09:01] Ghost."
[1:09:03] Why? Why is the Holy Ghost so important?
[1:09:07] Because the Holy Ghost gives power to
[1:09:11] this dead letter to make it live.
[1:09:16] That's what it does. What is the
[1:09:18] difference that it makes? Well, the
[1:09:20] difference it makes is that when you
[1:09:21] come into life and and maybe you you go
[1:09:25] to choose a wife or a spouse or anything
[1:09:28] else, you say, "Oh, you look at the
[1:09:30] outward appearance or or you look at the
[1:09:32] personalities and everything else and
[1:09:34] and you choose you pray and you pray and
[1:09:38] you cast lots."
[1:09:42] But if you were born again by the spirit
[1:09:47] of God and placed in the
[1:09:49] body, when you start to think about I
[1:09:52] like a a a
[1:09:57] mate Abraham, it was already revealed to
[1:10:02] Abraham that God had a mate for Isaac.
[1:10:07] God had a mate for Isaac. Isaac didn't
[1:10:10] choose Rebecca. God chose
[1:10:14] Rebecca. When you are born again of the
[1:10:17] spirit of God, your life completely
[1:10:20] changes. I went and looked today. I I
[1:10:23] went and looked and yes, I understand
[1:10:26] that God is a gentleman and that you're
[1:10:30] a free moral agent. But you know what?
[1:10:32] The truth of the matter is that when you
[1:10:35] yield yourself to God, you are no longer
[1:10:37] your own. That's right. You are now a
[1:10:39] prisoner of Jesus Christ. He is sitting
[1:10:42] inside of your control tower. And
[1:10:44] everything that you do, he will tell you
[1:10:47] before you do it. Everything, every
[1:10:51] decision, everything. Amen. The reason
[1:10:54] people have so much trouble is that
[1:10:56] they've never been placed in the body of
[1:11:00] Christ. They've got the new birth. They
[1:11:03] got salvation.
[1:11:05] You brother, I can't. No, you're you're
[1:11:08] messing with my head. All right, let's
[1:11:10] take a look at an example. I already
[1:11:12] showed you about the disciples. The
[1:11:14] disciples could raise the dead. They
[1:11:16] could heal the sick. They could cast out
[1:11:18] devils. Jesus said, he said, "I saw
[1:11:21] Satan being cast out of heaven and they
[1:11:23] rejoiced." And he said, "No, don't start
[1:11:26] rejoicing yet. Make sure you go up to
[1:11:29] Jerusalem, get the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:32] Get the Holy Ghost because without the
[1:11:35] Holy Ghost, you cannot live this life.
[1:11:38] Amen. You'll be just plucking it on.
[1:11:42] You'll be fasting and praying and
[1:11:44] saying, "Look at this. I'm an
[1:11:45] overcomer." And you'll be fasting and
[1:11:47] praying some more. I'm I'm going to
[1:11:48] overcome this fle. Let God overcome the
[1:11:51] flesh. That's what Brother Brandham
[1:11:53] said. He says, "Don't he said don't try
[1:11:55] to be something that you're not. Be
[1:11:58] yourself and let
[1:11:59] God God created the heavens and the
[1:12:02] earth. And the scripture says the spirit
[1:12:05] of God came down and brooded upon the
[1:12:07] water. We don't let God brood because we
[1:12:10] got a better idea.
[1:12:13] We don't let God come down and deal with
[1:12:15] us because we forgot about going and
[1:12:17] getting the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:20] You got to get the Holy Ghost. The Holy
[1:12:23] Ghost will live through you.
[1:12:26] the Holy Ghost. I mean, let's look at
[1:12:30] Romans 8. Praise God.
[1:12:40] Amen.
[1:12:44] Amen. Romans 8:14, it says, "For as many
[1:12:47] as are led by the Spirit of God, they
[1:12:50] are the sons of God." Amen. Not those
[1:12:55] that see we are constrained.
[1:13:01] I've every time I get discouraged and I
[1:13:04] I think oh Lord you've done left me and
[1:13:06] I'm I'm all and I go back and I look at
[1:13:09] this doesn't even make any sense to
[1:13:12] me. I needed a job and I
[1:13:16] prayed and God gave me a job.
[1:13:20] I didn't go and you know it God
[1:13:23] constrained me. Yes. When Don and I we
[1:13:28] met and we were we were just in the
[1:13:30] flesh. We were just kids like everybody
[1:13:32] else attracted by the outward appearance
[1:13:35] and we moved in together and we were I
[1:13:37] mean my everything was scripturally
[1:13:41] wrong. But one day the Holy Ghost came
[1:13:43] down and spoke to me said marry her.
[1:13:47] Yes. And I wasn't even born again.
[1:13:51] But he told me to marry her.
[1:13:54] He said, "That's the one. That's the one
[1:13:58] he chose. I didn't choose her. He chose
[1:14:00] her.
[1:14:02] He chose her for me." Do you think all
[1:14:05] the mistakes you've made because you
[1:14:07] never got to the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:10] Ghost?
[1:14:12] They that are led by the spirit of God,
[1:14:14] they are the sons of God. Not those that
[1:14:16] can quote the scriptures and tell you
[1:14:18] how it's all done and everything else.
[1:14:20] Those that got the control tower on the
[1:14:22] inside that's saying don't go down
[1:14:25] there. What this what's the problem
[1:14:29] here? God will watch over his sons. God
[1:14:32] will watch over his daughters. He will
[1:14:34] take you where you need to be.
[1:14:37] For we have not received the spirit of
[1:14:40] bondage again to fear. That's what the
[1:14:42] law was all about. It was fear.
[1:14:45] I'm not going to make it. I can't do it
[1:14:46] because I can't keep the law. I can't I
[1:14:48] can't stop this. I can't stop that. I
[1:14:50] can't I'm struggling with this. Have you
[1:14:52] gotten the Holy Ghost since you
[1:14:54] believed?
[1:14:56] Let the Holy Ghost take care of those
[1:14:59] things. Let the Holy Ghost come down in
[1:15:01] your life and clean them houses. Jesus
[1:15:05] said, he said, when a man comes in and
[1:15:07] he cleans the house out, God will clean
[1:15:10] that house out. He says, "But if you
[1:15:13] don't fill that house up," he says,
[1:15:14] "Seven seven worth devils will say,
[1:15:16] "Hey, look at this place. It's pretty
[1:15:17] nice. And the first one you'll get is
[1:15:20] Mr. Religious Spirit."
[1:15:22] And he's nasty. He's nastier than all
[1:15:25] the other ones.
[1:15:28] He says, "But look," he says, 'We
[1:15:30] haven't received the bondage again to
[1:15:31] fear, but you have received the spirit
[1:15:33] of
[1:15:36] adoption, whereby we cry, "Aba, Father,
[1:15:39] or I adore you."
[1:15:42] And the spirit itself beareth witness
[1:15:45] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:15:48] of God. And if we're children, then
[1:15:51] we're hes of God and joints with Christ.
[1:15:54] If so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:15:57] may al be also glorified
[1:16:01] together. So how does it do it? You say
[1:16:04] this isn't an adoption. He says glory to
[1:16:06] God. Hallelujah. Don't bother me. I'm a
[1:16:09] child of God. And go out and do the
[1:16:10] things you do. The spirit of God will do
[1:16:13] the works of God. If you want the works
[1:16:16] of God in your
[1:16:18] life, did you get the Holy Ghost since
[1:16:21] you believed? Have you been placed in
[1:16:24] the body?
[1:16:26] Have you been born again?
[1:16:28] Amen.
[1:16:32] Brother John, not very long ago, a month
[1:16:34] or so ago, he preached on the 10
[1:16:35] virgins. Think about that.
[1:16:39] I don't like the idea that five are wise
[1:16:41] and five are foolish, but we know that
[1:16:43] the
[1:16:44] wise had been born again.
[1:16:47] not only born again but baptized in the
[1:16:50] Holy Ghost because they had oil in their
[1:16:52] lamp.
[1:16:53] And the five foolish, God didn't cast
[1:16:56] away.
[1:16:58] Those five foolish that were trying
[1:17:00] their ever best, they were they they had
[1:17:04] salvation. They believed in Jesus. They
[1:17:06] they they did everything that they could
[1:17:09] do, but they had to give their life to
[1:17:12] get in.
[1:17:14] But the five wise don't have to do that
[1:17:18] because he's already taken my place.
[1:17:24] Amen.
[1:17:27] Amen. So he says, "The spirit of God
[1:17:30] will do the works of God." Jesus said,
[1:17:31] "He that believeth on me, the works that
[1:17:33] I do shall he do also." And see, you
[1:17:37] can't you can't do that. It I you know,
[1:17:41] it's nice. It's great. It's a great
[1:17:43] idea. It is. It's a great idea. Your dog
[1:17:47] dies. It's a great idea. I'll tell you a
[1:17:49] story. That's not a story. It's true.
[1:17:52] So, uh, our our third pregnancy, my
[1:17:56] wife, we had a baby boy. It was still
[1:17:58] born. Um, it it was bad. It was really
[1:18:03] bad. And a brother in the church, he he
[1:18:07] had good intentions and everything else.
[1:18:09] We were we were still in the the
[1:18:11] birthing room and Donna was all undone
[1:18:14] and everything else and I met him
[1:18:16] outside the door and he said, "Brother
[1:18:17] Bruce says we're going to pray for the
[1:18:18] baby and raise it from the dead." That's
[1:18:21] a great thought.
[1:18:25] But when it doesn't happen,
[1:18:28] now you're in a pickle.
[1:18:31] But if the tree, if you got the
[1:18:34] tree, the tree cannot divi. Doesn't the
[1:18:38] scripture say if we are not faithful yet
[1:18:41] he is faithful he will deny deny himself
[1:18:44] and he's the word he can't deny the word
[1:18:48] he can't deny the word you'll stay
[1:18:51] you'll stay the church will all leave
[1:18:53] they'll all leave and go about in the
[1:18:55] world and do whatever but you will stay
[1:18:57] because you're attached to that thing
[1:19:00] right
[1:19:01] it's wonderful to be have the
[1:19:04] justification and feel Great. That's
[1:19:07] great. It's wonderful to have that. But
[1:19:10] it's more better to be born of the
[1:19:13] spirit of God. It's more better to be
[1:19:15] baptized in the body of believers. It's
[1:19:19] better. If this vine comes forth and it
[1:19:23] produces a bunch of grapes and the next
[1:19:25] one that comes forth produces a bunch of
[1:19:27] pumpkins, there's something wrong. You
[1:19:30] see, because it's a it's a it's a
[1:19:33] drafted church. It's a drafted vine.
[1:19:35] It's a drafted or a grafted person.
[1:19:39] Amen.
[1:19:41] Amen. Look at First John
[1:19:45] 3.
[1:19:54] Amen. First John
[1:19:57] 3 verse two it says, "Beloved, now are
[1:20:01] we the sons of God.
[1:20:03] Today we are sons of God. If you've been
[1:20:07] baptized into the body,
[1:20:10] if you haven't been baptized into the
[1:20:11] body, go get baptized into the body.
[1:20:15] That's my best advice to
[1:20:18] you. Don't ever
[1:20:20] lose focus. Amen. That I have to be
[1:20:24] baptized with the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:20:26] Don't ever lose that focus. Amen.
[1:20:29] because you can't live this word.
[1:20:34] What will happen? God will keep turning
[1:20:37] the pressure up. Now, if you're if
[1:20:38] you're predestinated, he will he will
[1:20:41] turn the pressure up till you pop and
[1:20:43] then he'll say, "See, come come to me.
[1:20:46] Come quickly to me." But those that are
[1:20:50] not, you know,
[1:20:53] when once that hook you I don't I mean,
[1:20:56] a lot of you guys are fishermen. I'm
[1:20:58] not, but I know how it works. You put
[1:21:00] the hook in the mouth, the fish ain't
[1:21:02] getting
[1:21:03] away. And if it's a good hook, he can't
[1:21:06] even spit it out. I mean, a largemouth
[1:21:08] bass will try to spit the hook out, but
[1:21:10] he's he's the believer don't spit out
[1:21:14] the word of
[1:21:15] God. And once it's hooked, we just God,
[1:21:19] the Holy Spirit just reels us. He said,
[1:21:21] "He's
[1:21:23] coming." God knows you're coming.
[1:21:29] Amen. So we don't want to be like that.
[1:21:32] He says, "So beloved," this is 1 John 3
[1:21:36] verse two. He says, "Beloved, now we are
[1:21:40] the sons of God and it does not yet
[1:21:42] appear what we shall be because we're
[1:21:46] stuck in this
[1:21:48] flesh and emulation is in this flesh.
[1:21:51] Anger is in this flesh. Don't matter. No
[1:21:55] matter how much you try, Brother
[1:21:58] Johnson, at least you expect it. Oh,
[1:22:00] anger will come roaring his ugly head
[1:22:02] up. That's right. But if you've been
[1:22:06] placed in the body and if you've been
[1:22:07] baptized with the Holy Spirit and he
[1:22:09] dwells in the control tower of your
[1:22:11] heart, you will quickly
[1:22:15] quickly come right back to that word.
[1:22:18] You will quickly return. You God will
[1:22:21] not leave you out here alone. That is
[1:22:24] Jesus. Jesus went, you know, and and he
[1:22:27] fasted 40 days and and when he got done,
[1:22:30] the devil come to
[1:22:32] him. The devil come to him and said,
[1:22:34] "Ah, you know, if you you and every one
[1:22:37] of us has been to this trial if you were
[1:22:41] a real believer,
[1:22:43] you wouldn't have done that."
[1:22:47] Yeah. He'll tell you that. Oh, yeah. But
[1:22:51] see, if God's sitting on the control
[1:22:53] tower, scriptures will come. Scriptures
[1:22:57] will come. He said, Jesus said, "Take it
[1:23:00] no thought." Take no thought when they
[1:23:02] bring you up before magistrates and
[1:23:03] different things like that. He says,
[1:23:04] "Because I will speak right through
[1:23:08] you." Amen.
[1:23:10] Amen.
[1:23:14] Now, we are the sons of God. And it
[1:23:16] shall and and it does not yet appear
[1:23:19] what we shall be, but we know that when
[1:23:22] he shall appear, we shall be like him,
[1:23:26] for we shall see him as he is.
[1:23:30] Amen. And every man that hath this hope
[1:23:33] in himself purifith himself even as he
[1:23:35] is pure. He's already
[1:23:38] pure because the Holy Ghost is sitting
[1:23:40] on the throne of his heart and the Holy
[1:23:43] Ghost is causing him to purify
[1:23:46] himself. That's that's what happens. The
[1:23:50] Holy Ghost will lead you. The Holy Ghost
[1:23:53] you'll you'll the devil will make little
[1:23:56] he'll have booby traps and all kinds of
[1:23:59] things and and he'll do but see God is
[1:24:02] my strength.
[1:24:04] God is my strong tower. He's my shield,
[1:24:07] my buckler. I don't have to put him on.
[1:24:10] He's here.
[1:24:12] He's already here. He dwells in here.
[1:24:16] There's a man that lives in here. That's
[1:24:19] what a real son and daughter of God is.
[1:24:21] Is God has come down and dwells inside
[1:24:24] of them. You don't have to ask him.
[1:24:26] Really think about it.
[1:24:28] You you do not everything. Take a glass
[1:24:33] of water. If I take this bottle of water
[1:24:36] and I put a teaspoon of salt in
[1:24:40] it, does the salt only stay in one
[1:24:44] place? It's evenly distributed in the
[1:24:47] whole bottle. And when the Holy Ghost
[1:24:49] comes in you, it's evenly distributed in
[1:24:52] the whole
[1:24:53] bottle. It's evenly distributed. Amen.
[1:24:57] Love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:24:58] gentleness, kindness, peace, all those
[1:25:00] things, they come in. It's all it's it's
[1:25:03] all part of the it's brother Brandham
[1:25:06] said, he says, "What's going, he says,
[1:25:08] what are we going to need miracles in
[1:25:09] the millennium for when we're
[1:25:11] supernatural being?" See, how are we
[1:25:14] going to need those things? Now, the
[1:25:16] Bible said, "Now we are the sons of
[1:25:18] God." Now, now, now is present tense.
[1:25:22] Now, we are the sons of God. Not that we
[1:25:24] will be. We are now. We are this
[1:25:27] morning, this very hour, tonight. You
[1:25:30] are the sons of God. If you've been born
[1:25:33] again by the spirit of God, baptized
[1:25:35] into the body because every orange that
[1:25:39] you need is already in
[1:25:43] here. It's already in there because he's
[1:25:47] the author of the whole
[1:25:51] thing. We are this morning. we are this
[1:25:54] very hour and now we are the sons of God
[1:25:57] seated together sitting together in
[1:25:58] heavenly places in Christ Jesus right
[1:26:02] this very minute we are seated together
[1:26:05] in heavenly places in Christ every man
[1:26:08] by one spirit we're all baptized into
[1:26:11] one body and we have become members of
[1:26:14] his body by Holy Spirit baptism and
[1:26:18] you're seated together in heavenly
[1:26:20] places in Christ Jesus free from
[1:26:22] judgment
[1:26:23] You can never go to the judgment. How
[1:26:25] can you be judged twice and everything
[1:26:27] that you have need of is already in
[1:26:30] here?
[1:26:33] Already in here. You don't have to ask
[1:26:36] God. Did you didn't have to ask Jesus.
[1:26:39] Jesus one time he got tired. He told his
[1:26:41] disciples, disciples are all looking at
[1:26:43] him, scratching his head. He says, "I'm
[1:26:45] going up over here and praying. You guys
[1:26:48] get in the boat and go on the other
[1:26:49] side." Why didn't they just go with him?
[1:26:51] They didn't have the Holy Ghost. But
[1:26:54] see, the Holy Ghost took him up in a
[1:26:56] high place to pray. It took him up
[1:26:58] there. It will take you.
[1:27:03] Yes. The real believer that's been
[1:27:04] baptized into the body, you don't have
[1:27:06] to ask him to read this Bible and pray.
[1:27:09] You don't have to ask a baby. Brother
[1:27:11] Brandham gave the baby example many,
[1:27:13] many, many times. He says that baby is
[1:27:16] when it I mean you and I we're all
[1:27:19] adults or close to it.
[1:27:22] So we eat three meals a day, but you
[1:27:25] don't really need that. You could get
[1:27:27] away with two, but newborn baby is every
[1:27:30] two hours. You could set your watch by
[1:27:33] it. And you take a young believer in
[1:27:36] Jesus Christ, you take a young believer
[1:27:37] that's been baptized in the Holy Ghost,
[1:27:39] they want something to eat. And they and
[1:27:42] if they don't get it, you know what they
[1:27:43] do? They cause trouble.
[1:27:46] They scream out to God and say, "Give me
[1:27:48] something to eat. I'm hungry down here."
[1:27:51] And God will give you something to eat.
[1:27:56] So take a look at your life. Take a
[1:27:58] look. Did you get the tree? Jesus said,
[1:28:00] "I'm the tree. You're the vine. I'm the
[1:28:02] vine. You are the
[1:28:03] branches." And every branch that doesn't
[1:28:07] produce the right fruit, he's going to
[1:28:10] prune it off. He's going to prune it
[1:28:13] off. and cast you in the fire. That's
[1:28:15] what happened to the five
[1:28:18] foolish. They got cast in the
[1:28:21] fire because they had to go through the
[1:28:24] bad
[1:28:26] tribulation. But those that had the Holy
[1:28:30] Ghost, the oil in the lamp, keep me
[1:28:34] burning. How do you How do you think
[1:28:38] about that? Think about it. The
[1:28:39] scripture says, the scripture says it
[1:28:42] shall be like a river of water flowing
[1:28:44] up out of your belly.
[1:28:47] I don't know if you ever seen an
[1:28:48] artisian
[1:28:49] well, but you could I don't care. Go try
[1:28:53] try doing it with a faucet in your
[1:28:54] kitchen. Turn your faucet on full blast
[1:28:56] and then take your hand and see if you
[1:28:57] can plug it
[1:28:59] up. And when the spirit of God is on the
[1:29:02] inside of you, try plugging it up. It'll
[1:29:03] come out somewhere. It'll come out all
[1:29:06] over everywhere. And the next thing you
[1:29:07] know, the whole body's wet
[1:29:10] and you'll be lit. If you want to be a
[1:29:13] written epistle, the question is,
[1:29:17] have you been baptized?
[1:29:20] Amen. Amen.
[1:29:23] I got I got one more scripture in here,
[1:29:29] but
[1:29:35] hopefully you see just just like when I
[1:29:38] was talking about the water and the salt
[1:29:40] and the water, when the word of God gets
[1:29:43] in you, it will it will permeate every
[1:29:48] fiber. It will just go through
[1:29:50] everywhere. It'll just go through and
[1:29:52] everything that's not like him, it'll
[1:29:54] slowly push it away. It'll come. It'll
[1:29:58] it How can I overcome cigarettes? Get
[1:30:00] the Holy Ghost. How can I overcome my
[1:30:02] temper? Get the Holy Ghost. How can I
[1:30:04] overcome this? To get the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:06] How can I be more led by the spirit? Get
[1:30:07] the Holy Ghost. Get the Holy Get it. Get
[1:30:11] it. Brother Ben Renom said, he said, "We
[1:30:13] waste too much time. We We've
[1:30:18] And and it doesn't take long." I
[1:30:20] remember as a young
[1:30:22] deacon I was talking with a brother. I
[1:30:24] said we were we were watching some young
[1:30:26] believers and that and I said you know
[1:30:28] what I said they don't get born again
[1:30:30] pretty soon. I said they're going to get
[1:30:31] a lot of head knowledge and then it'll
[1:30:33] be even harder for them to get born.
[1:30:34] Amen.
[1:30:38] You know every every woman that I know
[1:30:42] of that got pregnant when she she got
[1:30:44] pregnant when the day that baby's coming
[1:30:47] the baby's coming. But but we we're just
[1:30:51] happy to come to church. I'm going to do
[1:30:53] the works of God. I'm going to make I'm
[1:30:54] gonna make Brother John happy with me.
[1:30:56] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do
[1:30:57] that and everything else. And then after
[1:31:00] a while, I forget, did you get the Holy
[1:31:03] Ghost since you believed? Have you
[1:31:05] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:31:06] believed? Amen.
[1:31:11] Ephesians 4:30 says, "Grieve not the
[1:31:14] Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are
[1:31:19] sealed."
[1:31:22] Sealed. What did Paul write the book to
[1:31:25] Ephesians? He said to
[1:31:27] those that are
[1:31:29] in
[1:31:31] positionally bang I know my
[1:31:35] place and you are
[1:31:37] sealed until the day of
[1:31:41] redemption. And that's the day he calls
[1:31:43] me home. He might take me home by the
[1:31:45] grave. He might take me home by a car
[1:31:48] accident. I don't know how he take me
[1:31:50] home. But when he takes me home, I'm
[1:31:52] going.
[1:31:55] But have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:31:57] since you
[1:31:58] believed?
[1:32:00] Amen. Praise the
[1:32:07] Lord. So, Sister Amanda, pull up. Let
[1:32:10] the Holy Ghost come
[1:32:12] in.
[1:32:14] Amen. Think about it, friends. You know,
[1:32:17] because all of your works won't it they
[1:32:21] won't it it won't work.
[1:32:25] It just won't work.
[1:32:33] See, would you be redeemed from every
[1:32:36] inbred sin? It's in
[1:32:39] here that you're
[1:32:41] stuck. and have the Holy Spirit
[1:32:44] constantly. When he comes in and abides,
[1:32:47] you're sealed until the day of your
[1:32:50] redemption. Make a consecration. Trust
[1:32:53] in God. Believe his word. And then get
[1:32:56] the new
[1:32:57] birth. Get a real birth. Let God come
[1:33:02] down and take your life and use it for
[1:33:04] his glory.
[1:33:07] Brother Random said it wasn't so much
[1:33:09] the gift. He said his only gift was
[1:33:11] getting himself out of the way so that
[1:33:15] the spirit that was in him could live
[1:33:18] through him.
[1:33:21] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's bow our
[1:33:25] heads for a word of prayer.
[1:33:27] Dear Lord
[1:33:30] Jesus, our desire
[1:33:34] Lord, our true
[1:33:36] desire is that one day we can stand in
[1:33:39] your
[1:33:41] presence. Lord, that we can be sons and
[1:33:43] daughters of
[1:33:45] God. Lord, we can't do that without your
[1:33:49] spirit abiding in our
[1:33:51] hearts. And I pray Lord, Lord, that
[1:33:55] you'll just take this simple thought,
[1:33:57] this simple message, and Lord, may it
[1:33:59] just trouble us. May it go with us. May
[1:34:03] we hear it in the night. May we hear it
[1:34:05] tomorrow and the next day, may it come
[1:34:08] back, Lord. Because I know the true
[1:34:10] believer, they that have been baptized
[1:34:12] in the body, there isn't a
[1:34:16] question, but we want to make sure.
[1:34:21] We want to make sure that we have the
[1:34:22] Holy Ghost. We want to make sure that
[1:34:25] we've been baptized into the
[1:34:27] body. And I just pray, Lord, that you'll
[1:34:30] just answer every prayer
[1:34:32] request. Lord, I just pray you just
[1:34:35] speak to each and
[1:34:37] everyone. And may you just move by your
[1:34:39] spirit. Father, we love you. In Jesus
[1:34:43] Christ's name we ask. Amen.
[1:34:46] Amen. Is that what you desire?
[1:34:51] Would you be redeemed from every inbred
[1:34:57] sin? Have the Holy Spirit constantly
[1:35:02] within. Make the
[1:35:05] consecration. Trust in God in
[1:35:08] that. Let the Holy Ghost come
[1:35:13] in. Let the Holy Ghost come in.
[1:35:19] Let the Holy Ghost come
[1:35:24] in. Make the
[1:35:26] consecration. Trust in God. And then let
[1:35:31] the Holy Ghost come
[1:35:34] in. Would you have the spirit in your
[1:35:39] heart to fear? Would you be from every
[1:35:44] doubt and fear? Make the
[1:35:47] consecration. Trust in God. And then let
[1:35:52] the Holy Ghost come
[1:35:55] in. Let the Holy Ghost come
[1:36:01] in. Let the Holy Ghost come
[1:36:06] in. Make the
[1:36:08] consecration. Trust in God. And then let
[1:36:13] the Holy Ghost come in.
[1:36:17] Do you want the fire of God to fill your
[1:36:21] soul? Burn up all the trust and sanctify
[1:36:26] the whole. Amen. Make the
[1:36:29] consecration. Trust in God. And then let
[1:36:34] the Holy Ghost come
[1:36:37] in. Let the Holy Ghost come in.
[1:36:43] Let the Holy Ghost come
[1:36:47] in. Make a
[1:36:50] consecration. Trust in God. And then let
[1:36:54] the Holy Ghost come
[1:36:58] in. Do you want the power to make you
[1:37:02] true and brave so that you can rescue
[1:37:07] that Christ would save? Make the
[1:37:10] consecration. Trust in God and then let
[1:37:15] the Holy Ghost come
[1:37:18] in. Let the Holy Ghost come
[1:37:23] in. Let the Holy Ghost come
[1:37:28] in. Make the
[1:37:30] consecration. Trust in God. And then let
[1:37:35] the Holy Ghost come in.
[1:37:39] Let the Holy Ghost come
[1:37:43] in. Let the Holy Ghost come
[1:37:48] in. Make a
[1:37:50] consecration. Trust in God. And then let
[1:37:55] the Holy Ghost come
[1:37:57] in. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:38:03] Have you been baptized into the body?
[1:38:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:38:08] baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[1:38:16] Amen. Have you been baptized into the
[1:38:22] body? Baptized with the Holy
[1:38:27] Ghost. There is but one way to enter in
[1:38:31] it. just as they did on
[1:38:37] Pentecost. Are you in the church
[1:38:42] triumphant? Are you in the Savior's
[1:38:47] bride? Come and be baptized into the
[1:38:52] body and forever more abide.
