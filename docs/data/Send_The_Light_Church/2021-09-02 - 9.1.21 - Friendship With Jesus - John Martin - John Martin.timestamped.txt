[38:47] father we pray that you take this little
[38:50] subject these scriptures this time we
[38:52] want to dedicate it to you right now and
[38:54] pray that you'd come take control lord
[38:57] of our thoughts
[38:58] our mind oh lord we pray that you
[39:00] protect us from the enemy coming and
[39:03] placing any thoughts in our head but
[39:06] lord you just built a hedge of
[39:07] protection around this room today
[39:10] and father
[39:11] lord we just ask that the holy spirit
[39:13] would have the preeminence in the midst
[39:15] we commit now the service to you give
[39:18] you the praise and honor in jesus
[39:20] precious name we pray amen
[39:23] amen james chapter 2 we're just going to
[39:26] read
[39:27] verses
[39:28] 21 through 23 and have you be seated
[39:32] and
[39:33] the bible says was
[39:35] not abraham our father justified by
[39:37] works
[39:39] when he had offered isaac his son upon
[39:42] the altar
[39:43] see is thou how faith wrought
[39:46] with his works
[39:47] and by works was faith made perfect
[39:52] the scriptures
[39:53] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[39:56] saith
[39:57] abraham believed god
[39:59] and it was imputed unto him for
[40:02] righteousness
[40:03] and he was called
[40:05] the friend
[40:07] of god
[40:08] god bless you may be seated i want to
[40:10] say it's really
[40:12] a blessing from my heart to see brother
[40:14] larry here
[40:16] amen god bless you brother
[40:18] we want to entitle this message
[40:20] friendship
[40:22] friendship
[40:25] and for a subject god called me
[40:28] his friend
[40:31] and
[40:31] brother brandon was quoting brother
[40:33] bile's work a number of times
[40:36] and he said fellowship was like two
[40:38] fellows in one ship
[40:40] another place he said two fellows and
[40:42] one ship makes the fellowship
[40:46] i think friendship could be looked at in
[40:48] the same way
[40:50] it's two friends and one ship
[40:54] two friends in one ship
[40:57] the definition of friendship
[41:00] is the state of being friends
[41:04] the state of being friends so good to
[41:07] see sister kathleen amen god is
[41:11] capture
[41:12] amen we're going to continue to pray
[41:14] amen
[41:17] it is the state of being friends being
[41:20] friendly and express expressing of good
[41:23] will and kindness
[41:27] the definition of a friend
[41:30] is one that is fond
[41:32] or attached to another
[41:35] proverb 17 17 says a friend loveth at
[41:39] all times we could say a friend loveth
[41:42] at all times
[41:45] the dictionary also defines a friend as
[41:48] as one that is not hostile
[41:50] to another
[41:52] one that is not aggressive
[41:54] feeling or showing active opposition
[41:59] so i want to make some some statements
[42:01] here before we get into the scriptures
[42:03] you can be a friend to someone without
[42:06] having a friendship with them
[42:09] in other words you can be a friend to
[42:11] someone who is not friendly
[42:13] to you
[42:15] you can be friendly to someone
[42:17] who's actually hostile towards you
[42:21] you can be a friend to someone without
[42:23] there being a real friendship
[42:25] or being in the same boat together
[42:29] and since fred friendship is based on
[42:32] trust you could be a friend to someone
[42:34] without trusting them
[42:38] we know jesus the bible tells us was a
[42:40] friend to publicans and sinners
[42:43] jesus was not only a friend to those
[42:45] that agreed with him but he was a friend
[42:47] to his enemies
[42:51] jesus chose a man to be his disciple and
[42:54] he chose him for the ministry
[42:56] to be a church treasure
[42:58] but through the process of time judas
[43:01] began to think more about himself than
[43:05] jesus
[43:07] instead of a ministry that lived for
[43:09] others he began living for himself
[43:13] judas no longer wanted to help the
[43:15] ministry that jesus had called him to
[43:17] but he started looking at how he could
[43:19] profit from that ministry what he could
[43:22] get out of it and
[43:24] judas betrayed jesus a man that never
[43:27] did them wrong he betrayed him with a
[43:30] kiss and with pretense
[43:32] i want to pick it up in matthew chapter
[43:34] 26 verse 49.
[43:40] and forthwith he came to jesus
[43:44] judas did and said hail master and
[43:47] kissed him
[43:49] and look at the response here and jesus
[43:51] said unto him friend
[43:54] friend
[43:55] wherefore are thou come
[43:58] then came they and laid hands on jesus
[44:02] and took them
[44:04] jesus was a friend to those he knew
[44:08] were not a true friend to him
[44:11] and he remained friendly to those who
[44:13] used him to get personal gain
[44:17] jesus could still call them a friend
[44:19] just like he did judas because jesus
[44:22] remained friendly
[44:24] to him
[44:27] he didn't get aggressive or hostile to
[44:30] his own betrayer
[44:31] he opened out his mouth to show act of
[44:34] opposition
[44:36] he was genuinely the same towards those
[44:39] who turned against him
[44:43] this is powerful
[44:45] [Music]
[44:46] thank you brother i can see clearly now
[44:53] what does jesus want us to do
[44:57] he wants us to get in the same boat with
[44:59] him
[45:00] amen
[45:01] he wants us to have friendship with him
[45:04] in this manner this type of friendship
[45:07] the bible says in first peter chapter 2
[45:09] verse 18 he says servants be subject to
[45:11] your masters with all fear not only to
[45:14] the good and gentle but also to the
[45:15] forward and that word just means crooked
[45:18] or or warped or perverse he wants us to
[45:21] be uh subject to them as well
[45:24] for this is thank worthy if a man for
[45:26] conscious towards god he endures grief
[45:28] suffering wrongfully now this is what
[45:30] was happening to jesus in this hour
[45:34] for what glory is that if when you're
[45:35] buffeted for your faults and you take it
[45:38] patiently in other words you should
[45:41] but if when you do well and suffer for
[45:43] it
[45:45] and suffer for it you take it patiently
[45:47] this is acceptable with god so this is
[45:50] the bolt that jesus is wanting us to get
[45:52] into to have friendship with him amen
[45:55] amen for even hearing too were you
[45:57] called this is what your jesus if i
[45:59] could say like this in verse 21 jesus is
[46:02] sitting in the boat and he's calling you
[46:04] to get in the boat with him
[46:07] for even or two were you called because
[46:09] christ also suffered for us leaving us
[46:12] an example that we should do the very
[46:14] same things he's doing
[46:16] who did no sin neither guile found in
[46:18] his mouth
[46:24] who when he was revived he rebound not
[46:26] again
[46:28] when he suffered he threatened not
[46:30] but he committed himself
[46:32] to him that judgeth righteously
[46:36] jesus was a friend to judas even though
[46:40] there wasn't much of a friendship
[46:41] between the two
[46:44] and even though jesus couldn't trust
[46:46] judas jesus still trusted his heavenly
[46:50] father
[46:51] in the middle of that situation he
[46:53] committed it to god he trusted in god
[46:56] and he was led as a lamb to the
[46:58] slaughter
[47:00] christ also suffered for us leaving us
[47:03] an example that we should follow his
[47:05] steps in other words be a friend
[47:08] back to jesus
[47:11] that's the steps he wants us to follow
[47:13] be a friend back to jesus
[47:16] by doing
[47:17] what he told us to do
[47:19] get in the boat with jesus be in
[47:21] fellowship with the same things that
[47:23] jesus believes
[47:25] now we can find lots of different things
[47:29] about the word that we want to believe
[47:31] but tonight
[47:32] let's take a look
[47:34] at what jesus is calling us to i want to
[47:37] be i want to be on the side
[47:39] where abraham was
[47:42] he was called the friend of god
[47:48] every believer views jesus as their
[47:50] friend
[47:52] they will testify of his faithfulness
[47:55] his mercy his love is long suffering the
[47:57] things that he's done from
[47:59] that he's a present help in a time of
[48:01] trouble that he's a friend that sticketh
[48:03] closer than the family
[48:07] but jesus is asking us to get in the
[48:09] same boat with him to have the same
[48:11] fellowship with him
[48:13] to follow his steps of unconditional
[48:16] love to be
[48:17] willing to suffer even if it's not your
[48:20] mistake
[48:22] to be a friend to those who are not a
[48:24] friend to you
[48:28] now the nature that we're born with was
[48:30] to be friends with those who we felt
[48:32] more comfortable with
[48:35] but when you become born again your
[48:37] nature puts you out as a friend to those
[48:41] who are not friends towards you
[48:44] that's why brother branham could enter
[48:46] the pulpit and say good morning friends
[48:49] from the bottom of his heart and he knew
[48:52] that there were people out there that
[48:53] didn't agree with him that weren't his
[48:55] friends that talked behind his back and
[48:57] used him just to get more people to come
[48:59] in his church he had so many reasons of
[49:02] being used but you know what he was
[49:03] still christ to the people
[49:07] yes he was and god has called us to be
[49:09] christ to the people around us
[49:12] people aren't going to see
[49:14] jesus unless they see him in you
[49:21] brother branham always drew a bigger
[49:22] circle around his enemies
[49:26] he followed jesus into the bolt
[49:29] that's what brother branham did
[49:31] he had
[49:32] fellowship
[49:33] and communion
[49:35] he had a real friendship with jesus amen
[49:39] matthew chapter 5 verse 43 and it's okay
[49:42] if you enjoy the word saying that amen
[49:47] it's so much easier to eat you know when
[49:49] when you're enjoying it
[49:51] i want to say thank you for your
[49:54] your prayers for us when we went up
[49:56] uh north
[49:59] we had a chance to eat at
[50:02] daryl's four times
[50:04] four times had pancakes three times
[50:09] i'm telling you i enjoyed it
[50:10] i enjoyed getting in that boat
[50:13] matthew chapter 5 verse 43 you have
[50:15] heard that had been said thou shalt love
[50:17] thy neighbor and hate thy enemy but i
[50:20] say unto you
[50:21] love your enemies
[50:23] bless them that curse you do good to
[50:25] them that hate you pray for them that
[50:27] despitefully use you and persecute now
[50:29] this is an extremely difficult thing to
[50:33] do
[50:34] but the holy ghost does it
[50:36] the holy ghost does not have a hard time
[50:38] doing this we in our flesh have our time
[50:41] but if you enter into the spirit yes god
[50:43] to fill you with his spirit there will
[50:45] not be any pressure there will not be
[50:46] any problems there will not be any
[50:48] issues
[50:50] that ye may be
[50:52] the children of your father which is in
[50:53] heaven in other words god is identifying
[50:57] his children
[51:00] by this one aspect
[51:02] for he may get the sun to rise and the
[51:04] evil and the good and sinners reign on
[51:06] the just and the just for he maketh in
[51:08] other words jesus is telling you you can
[51:11] make the sun rise on the evil and on the
[51:14] good you can
[51:17] you can
[51:19] because if you're a son or you're a
[51:21] daughter of god you're filled with your
[51:23] spirit and you can't do this
[51:27] just like god maketh the sun to rise i
[51:30] need you on the good so you
[51:32] do the same
[51:34] you got to believe it you can't wait
[51:36] till it happens and say oh wow i guess i
[51:38] could you've got to believe it before it
[51:39] happens no different than abraham amen
[51:44] god
[51:44] identifies his children as do-gooders
[51:48] genuinely caring
[51:50] burden
[51:52] uh authentic agape love expressors
[51:56] if i could say it like that they
[51:58] genuinely love everybody
[52:01] by this shall all men know that you're
[52:03] my children
[52:05] my disciples my children when you have
[52:07] love one for another's
[52:10] enemy
[52:12] anybody can love
[52:14] right
[52:15] for if you love them which love you what
[52:17] reward have you even the republicans the
[52:19] same and if you salute your brother and
[52:21] only what you more than others do not
[52:23] even republican soul
[52:26] god wants us to get out of that boat
[52:30] of just loving certain people
[52:34] it's a horrible boat
[52:35] it's the boat that we were kind of born
[52:37] with
[52:38] that's right but he wants us to get into
[52:40] his boat amen
[52:44] jesus wants us to get out of the
[52:45] so-called friendship
[52:47] and get into
[52:49] his type of friendship
[52:52] one that he's trying to get all of his
[52:55] children to do
[52:57] he said be therefore perfect even as
[53:00] your father which is in heaven
[53:02] is perfect or complete
[53:05] complete love you just completely love
[53:07] everybody
[53:09] now god will remain faithful to us no
[53:12] matter how unfaithful we are
[53:16] god will remain a faithful friend no
[53:18] matter how little we think of being a
[53:21] friend to him or even getting in his
[53:23] bowl
[53:25] we should never question god's loyalty
[53:28] or his love or his faithfulness towards
[53:30] us
[53:31] if you need a question
[53:33] question if you've gotten out of his
[53:35] boat his fellowship his friendship his
[53:38] word and his will because that's always
[53:40] where the mistake takes place
[53:43] now jesus warns the bible reader
[53:47] of many believers who didn't make it
[53:52] believers in god that didn't make it
[53:54] believers with faith
[53:56] believers that boldly use the name of
[53:58] jesus
[54:00] believers that worked for jesus
[54:02] believers that used the gifts that jesus
[54:05] gave them
[54:07] these believers could testify that jesus
[54:10] was a friend
[54:12] but jesus could never testify that they
[54:16] that they were his friend right it's
[54:18] true
[54:20] they weren't in the same boat they
[54:22] weren't the same fellowship or the same
[54:25] friendship with the will of god for
[54:27] their lives
[54:29] they weren't interested in laying aside
[54:31] everything else till they got perfect
[54:33] love
[54:34] they weren't willing to let anybody use
[54:37] them
[54:38] they didn't want to get in a situation
[54:40] of getting jews so they wouldn't even
[54:44] allow it
[54:46] and instead of praying with a burden
[54:49] they
[54:50] despised their enemies
[54:52] matthew chapter 7 verse 22 says many
[54:55] will say to me in that day lord lord
[54:59] have we not prophesied thy name and in
[55:01] thy name cast out devils
[55:04] and in thy name done many wonderful
[55:07] works
[55:08] and then i will profess unto them i
[55:11] never knew you
[55:13] depart from me that work iniquity
[55:17] so i want you to think about the
[55:18] friendship here
[55:21] jesus was a friend to them yeah you want
[55:24] to use my name go ahead
[55:28] you want to call me lord lord go ahead
[55:30] but in reality lord means
[55:34] lord of my life not just savior thanks
[55:37] for saving me but lord of my life i want
[55:39] to do your will
[55:42] and many are going to say lord lord
[55:45] they're saying lord lord without
[55:47] allowing god
[55:50] to be their lord
[55:52] so it doesn't matter what we say down
[55:54] here
[55:56] it matters if we take the time to live
[55:59] the life amen
[56:00] to let him be the lord of your life and
[56:03] prove it by laying down your life for
[56:05] your enemy amen
[56:07] to pray for them with a burden yes to
[56:11] let them use you and hoping that they
[56:13] might see christ someday
[56:16] that's what matters
[56:22] these
[56:24] were believers
[56:26] professing believers and look at their
[56:28] approach lord lord
[56:31] but not thinking about what it means
[56:33] when they sing
[56:36] he is lord
[56:43] jesus was a friend to them
[56:45] but there wasn't the friendship
[56:48] that they thought
[56:49] i want us to think about that because
[56:51] every one of us
[56:52] are in a relationship with jesus christ
[56:54] today
[56:58] and
[56:59] all these people
[57:01] that are going to hear
[57:03] uh depart from me i never knew you
[57:06] they're going to wish somebody stop them
[57:10] in their tracks just i wish somebody
[57:12] loved me enough to help me
[57:14] but it's going to be too late then
[57:18] matthew chapter 22
[57:23] we don't got time to read the whole
[57:24] parable but there's about six scriptures
[57:27] six different things that were said in
[57:29] our men's meeting that were already in
[57:30] our notes and this was one of them our
[57:32] our brother brought out
[57:34] this is the parable of the king that
[57:35] made a wedding and a feast for his son
[57:38] we don't got time
[57:39] to read it all but i just want to pick
[57:41] it up
[57:41] at verse 11
[57:43] and when the king came to see the guest
[57:47] he saw there was a man which had not a
[57:49] wedding garment
[57:51] and he said unto him friend think about
[57:54] this he calls him a friend
[57:57] how came is thou in hither not having a
[57:59] wedding garment
[58:01] and he was speechless
[58:03] and look what
[58:05] look what he said
[58:06] then said they came to a certain bind
[58:08] him now this is
[58:10] he's calling him friend he's telling him
[58:12] to bind him
[58:13] hand and foot and take him away and cast
[58:16] him into outer darkness and there shall
[58:17] be weeping and gnashing of teeth for
[58:19] many are called
[58:21] but few are chosen
[58:24] he still called him a friend even though
[58:27] he snuck in some other way
[58:30] he didn't come god's provided way
[58:34] and he didn't get the garment of god's
[58:36] righteousness on
[58:38] right he still called him a friend
[58:41] think about that he caught judas a
[58:43] friend right up to the very end
[58:46] it doesn't matter what he calls me it
[58:49] only matters if i'm a true friend to him
[58:57] another scripture that was read in our
[58:59] men's meaning john chapter 10 verse 8
[59:01] all that ever came before me are thieves
[59:04] and robbers
[59:06] all that ever came before me are thieves
[59:08] and robbers
[59:10] but the sheep did not hear them
[59:13] believers in jesus
[59:15] but not really wanting to be his friend
[59:17] that's what that is it's true
[59:19] they believe that he has the words of
[59:22] eternal life he's the only way he can
[59:24] get there but they want to steal it
[59:28] they don't want to buy it
[59:31] of course you can't buy it with money
[59:33] we're going to read some quotes on that
[59:35] you can't buy it with works
[59:37] you got to buy it without money without
[59:39] price
[59:40] you got to come and give your heart
[59:44] you got to get in the boat with jesus
[59:48] all that ever came before me are
[59:51] one-sided relationships
[59:54] one-sided friendships
[59:58] when we want god's help
[1:00:01] and don't want his will
[1:00:03] is really wanting
[1:00:05] a one-sided relationship
[1:00:07] a one-sided friendship
[1:00:10] i want god to meet all my needs but i
[1:00:13] don't want to pay my tithes for the
[1:00:14] ministry and my offerings for the church
[1:00:21] another scripture that was brought out
[1:00:24] about
[1:00:26] us robbing god of our time
[1:00:29] malachi chapter 3 verse 8 will a man rob
[1:00:32] god
[1:00:33] yet you rob me
[1:00:36] all that ever came before me with
[1:00:37] thieves and robbers
[1:00:39] yet ye have robbed me but ye say wherein
[1:00:42] did we rob thee never never i never
[1:00:44] walked in a church and grabbed anything
[1:00:48] he says you robbed me in tithes and
[1:00:50] offerings
[1:00:51] notice they're separated
[1:00:53] amen
[1:00:54] he said you're cursed with a curse for
[1:00:57] you robbed me
[1:00:58] so here we didn't take nothing from the
[1:01:01] church
[1:01:02] but because we didn't bring what already
[1:01:04] belonged to him we get cursed
[1:01:09] now this is god
[1:01:11] that's right
[1:01:13] he said bring
[1:01:15] and even said even this whole nation
[1:01:17] even this whole nation
[1:01:20] for you romney even this whole nation
[1:01:22] bring ye
[1:01:23] all the tithes into the storehouse
[1:01:26] that ye may
[1:01:28] that there may be meat notice this
[1:01:31] is for the ministry
[1:01:34] that there may be meat in my house
[1:01:36] and prove me
[1:01:38] now
[1:01:39] herewith saith the lord of hosts if i
[1:01:42] will not open you the windows of heaven
[1:01:44] and pour you out a blessing that there
[1:01:47] shall not be room enough to receive it
[1:02:03] god's word is true yes
[1:02:06] when god tells us to do something and we
[1:02:08] don't care enough to do it we're
[1:02:10] actually robbing god of his will
[1:02:14] so we can read problem of our time
[1:02:17] the tithes but also
[1:02:19] rob him of doing his will
[1:02:24] and there will come a time that every
[1:02:27] one of us
[1:02:28] is going to have a need of god in her
[1:02:30] life
[1:02:31] and it's at that hour that we're going
[1:02:33] to really want to have a friendship with
[1:02:36] jesus
[1:02:37] in the message trying to do god's
[1:02:38] service without being the will of god
[1:02:41] brother brahm said god bless these
[1:02:42] faithful men too
[1:02:44] in a time of emergency
[1:02:46] that's the time to look to god
[1:02:49] and to look to him and to be on
[1:02:53] friendship with him
[1:02:55] before the emergency arrives
[1:02:59] we know this
[1:03:00] if we have favor with god we can ask him
[1:03:03] anything like you would any other friend
[1:03:08] he is a present help in a time of
[1:03:11] trouble
[1:03:16] i'd rather be surrounded by friends and
[1:03:17] enemies
[1:03:22] unfortunately
[1:03:27] the friends are getting less and less
[1:03:29] and the enemies are getting greater and
[1:03:30] greater
[1:03:33] genuine friendship cannot be bought
[1:03:37] too many people have tried to buy
[1:03:40] friendship with
[1:03:42] jesus buy friendship with jesus would be
[1:03:45] robbing him of what he really wants and
[1:03:47] that's our hearts
[1:03:51] and i think
[1:03:52] many will come to me in that day and
[1:03:54] saying lord lord thinking that these
[1:03:56] things that they did was good enough to
[1:03:59] buy it
[1:04:00] you understand not so much the money
[1:04:04] of course i'm sure there are people that
[1:04:06] say as long as i pay my tithe i'm in
[1:04:11] well i belong to a church one time that
[1:04:14] believed in buying forgiveness
[1:04:17] i didn't even know this message existed
[1:04:19] at the time
[1:04:22] it was indulgence
[1:04:24] indulgence was issued by the pope
[1:04:28] it came with a complete remission of
[1:04:30] sins
[1:04:32] allowing escape from all of the pains of
[1:04:36] purgatory
[1:04:38] now it stopped in 1567 but i don't know
[1:04:42] if we know this
[1:04:44] but pope john paul ii brought it back in
[1:04:46] the year 2000
[1:04:50] according to church teaching
[1:04:52] even after sinners are absolved
[1:04:55] in the confessional
[1:04:57] and say
[1:04:59] their
[1:05:00] our fathers and hail mary's as penance
[1:05:03] they still face punishment after death
[1:05:06] in
[1:05:06] purgatory before they can enter into
[1:05:09] heaven
[1:05:10] you can just read this on on the
[1:05:12] internet that's where i got it from in
[1:05:14] exchange for certain prayers devotions
[1:05:16] or pilgrimages in special years a
[1:05:19] catholic can receive an indulgence which
[1:05:21] reduces or erases that punishment
[1:05:24] instantly with no formal ceremony or
[1:05:27] sacrament
[1:05:30] there are partial indulgence
[1:05:32] which reduce
[1:05:33] purgatorial time by a certain number of
[1:05:37] days or years
[1:05:39] and plenary indulgence which eliminates
[1:05:41] all of it
[1:05:43] until another sin is committed
[1:05:46] you can get one for yourself
[1:05:48] or for someone who is dead
[1:05:52] you cannot buy one
[1:05:54] the church outlawed that sale of
[1:05:56] indulgence in 1567
[1:05:59] but same sentence
[1:06:01] but
[1:06:02] charitable contributions
[1:06:04] combined with other acts
[1:06:06] can help you earn one
[1:06:10] now this is
[1:06:12] this is a limit of one
[1:06:15] per preliminary indulgence per center
[1:06:17] per day
[1:06:25] but look when i was
[1:06:27] caught up in that
[1:06:29] and there's
[1:06:30] whether it's that denomination or other
[1:06:31] denominations
[1:06:35] you know if you just do this
[1:06:37] you just put your name on the book
[1:06:39] you just speak in tongues you just join
[1:06:41] our church whatever it is you can't buy
[1:06:44] friendship with jesus
[1:06:48] true friendship cannot be bought
[1:06:50] proverbs chapter 14 verse 20 the poor is
[1:06:53] hated even of his own neighbor but the
[1:06:56] rich have many friends
[1:07:00] and as soon as the riches stop
[1:07:03] your friends go bye-bye
[1:07:06] like you really find out who your
[1:07:08] friends were
[1:07:10] in the message the day this scripture is
[1:07:12] fulfilled brother brahman says look at
[1:07:14] our nation once
[1:07:16] the flower of the earth
[1:07:19] our great democracy was formed back
[1:07:21] there at the declaration of independence
[1:07:24] and a declaration of independence was
[1:07:26] signed and we had our democracy and our
[1:07:30] great forefathers and the things that
[1:07:32] they've done we had a great nation
[1:07:35] but
[1:07:36] she is now rottening
[1:07:38] she's crumbling shaking and giving way
[1:07:42] and trying to tax people
[1:07:45] to get money to send over yonder to buy
[1:07:50] friendship with their enemies
[1:07:53] and they're throwing it back in her face
[1:07:57] one world war two world war and still
[1:08:00] moving on to the third one
[1:08:02] certainly politics is rotten corrupted
[1:08:05] rotten to the bottom just exactly
[1:08:09] what matthew 24 said it would be nation
[1:08:12] would rise against nation kingdom
[1:08:15] against kingdom and all these things
[1:08:17] would take place he said let's consider
[1:08:19] this now
[1:08:20] all right
[1:08:21] in the message influences brother
[1:08:23] branham says why
[1:08:24] it's become a stench in the nostrils all
[1:08:26] the overseas money and lease loans and
[1:08:28] everything like that
[1:08:30] will never buy friendship
[1:08:34] what we need in this nation
[1:08:36] he said we'll never have it
[1:08:38] but what we need is a house cleaning
[1:08:40] time
[1:08:41] not a political house cleaning but a
[1:08:44] holy ghost sent revival that will sweep
[1:08:46] her from the tip to the toe
[1:08:48] that's what our churches need that's
[1:08:50] what our people needs
[1:08:52] that's what
[1:08:53] as individuals we need
[1:08:58] now we can't change the world but we
[1:09:00] can't change ourself
[1:09:02] when we change ourselves will change the
[1:09:04] church when we change the church we'll
[1:09:06] be a better influence to the community
[1:09:09] but it starts with us
[1:09:15] now we can't buy favor or friendship
[1:09:17] with god we know that but where most
[1:09:20] believers get caught up is mixing
[1:09:23] relationships right part with god
[1:09:26] and part with the world
[1:09:28] that is exactly what they did in matthew
[1:09:31] chapter seven one man you'll come to me
[1:09:33] and say lord didn't i do this and this
[1:09:35] and this well why don't they just come
[1:09:36] and say yeah but i was mixed in the
[1:09:38] world and i did what i wanted to do and
[1:09:40] i did these other things why didn't they
[1:09:42] say that
[1:09:44] because the reason
[1:09:47] that jesus said they couldn't come in
[1:09:49] was because of the other things it
[1:09:51] wasn't because of
[1:09:53] casting out devils or doing wonderful
[1:09:55] works for jesus
[1:09:56] is what they weren't doing right when
[1:09:59] they were doing that
[1:10:03] and that's why it's important to have a
[1:10:06] ministry that talks about the things
[1:10:08] that we're not doing amen
[1:10:12] amen james chapter four verse four ye
[1:10:14] adulterers and adulteresses
[1:10:17] now this is speaking spiritually
[1:10:20] know ye not that the friendship of the
[1:10:23] world
[1:10:24] is enmity with god
[1:10:27] whosoever therefore be a friend of the
[1:10:29] world
[1:10:30] is a friend is an enemy of god
[1:10:34] no god will still call you fred
[1:10:40] but
[1:10:41] he knows you're not being a friend to
[1:10:43] him right it's true
[1:10:46] because you have to come out of her you
[1:10:48] have to be separate
[1:10:50] and and
[1:10:51] you know we're in the world jesus said
[1:10:53] we have to go to work right we have to
[1:10:55] take care of things
[1:10:57] but we're not of the world
[1:11:01] and jesus prayed for us
[1:11:03] before he left
[1:11:05] that god would keep us the father would
[1:11:08] keep us from the world amen
[1:11:10] and that we would grow in our oneness
[1:11:13] with god
[1:11:14] not just oh we're already one no we're
[1:11:16] not
[1:11:18] too many things happen in my life that
[1:11:19] prove i'm not one with god
[1:11:23] there's room for growth
[1:11:25] and that's what our focus that's why
[1:11:27] we're here right
[1:11:29] there's an invisible union taking place
[1:11:36] do you think the scripture
[1:11:38] do you think that the scripture saith in
[1:11:39] vain the spirit that dwelleth in us it
[1:11:42] lusteth to envy
[1:11:44] but he giveth more grace wherefore he
[1:11:46] said god resist the proud giveth grace
[1:11:48] to the humble submit yourselves
[1:11:50] therefore to god resist the devil and he
[1:11:52] will flee from you so friendship
[1:11:56] with god comes from submission to god
[1:12:00] in the message the seed of discrepancy
[1:12:03] brother branham said judas only played
[1:12:06] church he wasn't really sincere
[1:12:10] he didn't actually have faith
[1:12:13] he
[1:12:14] or else he would have never betrayed
[1:12:16] jesus
[1:12:17] but see he showed the seed of
[1:12:20] discrepancy
[1:12:22] he thought that he could make friends
[1:12:24] with the world mammon and also have
[1:12:27] friendship with jesus
[1:12:31] think about it
[1:12:33] and thought that he would make himself a
[1:12:35] piece of money and would be popular
[1:12:38] among the people
[1:12:40] if that doesn't cause so many people to
[1:12:42] get in discrepancy
[1:12:44] trying to find favor with man
[1:12:47] brother man says let's find favor with
[1:12:50] god not man amen that's right
[1:12:53] the problem is everybody thinks they
[1:12:54] already got favor with god
[1:12:59] by his grace we're here but i can tell
[1:13:00] you by his grace i'm not there
[1:13:05] and i need grace to get there
[1:13:07] i mean grace that i can see that i'm not
[1:13:09] there that i can press towards that mark
[1:13:14] too often we bring the world with us
[1:13:16] when we come to church
[1:13:19] things hanging all over us
[1:13:22] wanting to talk about things
[1:13:24] we find ourselves trying to build
[1:13:27] favor with one another instead of
[1:13:29] building it with god
[1:13:31] trying to stand out among
[1:13:33] one another instead of setting our
[1:13:35] affections on god
[1:13:38] brother braham says
[1:13:40] we go to church to find out where we
[1:13:41] stand with god amen
[1:13:45] i want you to think about what happens
[1:13:46] when you're thinking about going to
[1:13:48] church
[1:13:50] i mean some of us are struggling
[1:13:52] honestly
[1:13:53] to put in their heart to want to be here
[1:13:55] that's right it's true
[1:13:58] but god uses the ministry to bring out
[1:14:01] where we're standing with him
[1:14:02] he uses the ministry to do that
[1:14:06] where we're at on the scale of our
[1:14:08] friendship with god
[1:14:11] not to find out if god has been faithful
[1:14:14] in the relationship we know he's been
[1:14:15] faithful in the relationship
[1:14:18] but to find out where our faithfulness
[1:14:20] has been
[1:14:23] in the message the church ordered
[1:14:24] brother braham said
[1:14:26] but the church is not
[1:14:29] a general meeting house
[1:14:32] for fellowship
[1:14:34] and friendship
[1:14:36] and frolic
[1:14:40] it's not for fellowship
[1:14:43] and it's not for friendship
[1:14:45] right and it's not for folly frolic
[1:14:47] means to have fun
[1:14:49] to have a playful behavior
[1:14:51] or to be light spirited
[1:14:56] it's not
[1:14:57] this is not for that any of that
[1:15:00] our focus needs to be on god
[1:15:05] and i i know
[1:15:07] we don't see one another enough
[1:15:11] but why would you give up god for that
[1:15:14] right right that's what you're doing
[1:15:16] when you're trying to find favor with
[1:15:18] one another and
[1:15:20] trying to
[1:15:21] look like something or fellowship with
[1:15:23] somebody we're not here for that purpose
[1:15:28] brother ben said the church is a
[1:15:30] sanctuary of god
[1:15:32] now if you want to meet one another
[1:15:35] let me come to your house
[1:15:37] right you come to my house
[1:15:39] you go to one another's house and meet
[1:15:41] one another
[1:15:43] but just to frolic around through church
[1:15:46] and talking
[1:15:47] and things like that
[1:15:50] i'm glad he said that
[1:15:53] it's not right brother
[1:15:56] we come here and we get the whole thing
[1:15:59] out of our mind
[1:16:04] it's like we need to come into church
[1:16:06] with blinders
[1:16:08] i want to prepare my heart i want to
[1:16:09] receive for you i got to find out where
[1:16:10] i'm staying with you lord i want more of
[1:16:12] you
[1:16:19] judas didn't take the ministry serious
[1:16:21] enough
[1:16:23] you know when you're fellowshipping
[1:16:26] frolicking around
[1:16:30] or just trying to
[1:16:32] build friendship
[1:16:35] it's taking you away from the
[1:16:36] seriousness
[1:16:39] of the ministry
[1:16:41] it really really is
[1:16:43] and it happens so subtle
[1:16:46] that before you know it we just come in
[1:16:48] here
[1:16:51] you know brother bam talks you know
[1:16:53] god isn't into dancing
[1:16:55] right
[1:16:57] i mean i believe in dancing in the
[1:16:58] spirit
[1:16:59] but it ain't about us in our show
[1:17:04] and we i believe that we miss god in
[1:17:06] simplicity because we're not taking them
[1:17:08] serious enough
[1:17:12] we're missing god in the ministry
[1:17:14] and that's why i believe the lord
[1:17:16] brought
[1:17:18] the realness of god in and god is really
[1:17:21] among us if we could just recognize it
[1:17:25] i say send the light church
[1:17:28] we have some maturity to do in our
[1:17:30] church
[1:17:32] this church and our new church
[1:17:34] will not be a general meeting house
[1:17:37] for fellowship for friendship or frolic
[1:17:41] we need to spend more time laying in the
[1:17:43] presence of the son
[1:17:46] we need to come to church with a
[1:17:48] spiritual purpose in our mind
[1:17:53] a spiritual purpose for a life
[1:17:56] brother i'm sending the message from
[1:17:57] that time
[1:17:58] he says and you men let your wives go
[1:18:00] out like that shame on you
[1:18:03] the matter ain't
[1:18:04] uh the matter ain't you got no more
[1:18:06] respect for your wife than that
[1:18:09] now no
[1:18:10] i don't want to get into that
[1:18:12] notice
[1:18:13] that's a bad thing for me i lose too
[1:18:16] many friends when i talk like that
[1:18:18] but i know that i'm staying in
[1:18:20] friendship
[1:18:22] with christ
[1:18:24] because it's written right here that's
[1:18:26] exactly right now i understand that
[1:18:29] these things that i'm saying isn't
[1:18:31] popular
[1:18:32] and i know i'm not going to get maybe a
[1:18:33] close friendship with somebody but if
[1:18:36] somebody loves the word the way they
[1:18:38] should there's not going to be any
[1:18:39] problem with friendship
[1:18:43] the way of a true prophet of god brother
[1:18:45] branson says but the word of god will
[1:18:46] endure forever upon this rock i'll build
[1:18:49] my hopes forever upon the word of the
[1:18:52] lord let everything else sink
[1:18:55] if i lose
[1:18:57] friend
[1:18:58] everything else my friendship
[1:19:01] is in christ
[1:19:03] he says if i lose every friend and
[1:19:05] everything else my friendship is in
[1:19:08] christ that's the way we need to feel
[1:19:10] when we come to church hey i know you
[1:19:13] want to talk i know you must not you
[1:19:15] know be perhaps where you
[1:19:17] you ought to be
[1:19:18] but for me i need to go seek the lord
[1:19:21] amen
[1:19:22] i'm here about making our church better
[1:19:25] i'm here about getting serious about
[1:19:27] bringing the presence of god down and
[1:19:29] yes
[1:19:30] i'm serious about growing amen
[1:19:33] luke 21 verse 13.
[1:19:37] luke 21 13 you're going to have people
[1:19:39] come against you
[1:19:42] he said here and it shall turn to you
[1:19:44] for a testimony he said settle it
[1:19:47] therefore in your hearts
[1:19:50] not to meditate
[1:19:51] before what you shall answer for i will
[1:19:54] give you a mouth and wisdom
[1:19:57] which all your adversaries shall not be
[1:19:59] able to gain say nor resist
[1:20:02] and you shall be betrayed
[1:20:06] just like jesus was
[1:20:08] both by parents
[1:20:10] by brethren
[1:20:12] by kin folks
[1:20:14] and friends
[1:20:16] and some of you shall they cause
[1:20:19] to put to death
[1:20:21] he said settle it
[1:20:23] settle it in your heart don't let that
[1:20:25] move you
[1:20:26] and ye shall be hated of all men
[1:20:29] for my name's sake but there shall not a
[1:20:33] hair of your head perish
[1:20:37] i'm so glad he's taking care of me
[1:20:40] we gotta do one thing just stand for
[1:20:42] jesus
[1:20:43] stand for the word
[1:20:45] amen
[1:20:47] in the message from that time
[1:20:51] i want to talk about another
[1:20:52] type of friendship here he says but let
[1:20:55] me tell you a little secret
[1:20:57] the most powerful force in the world
[1:20:59] isn't speaking with tongues
[1:21:02] or interpreting in tongues
[1:21:04] or being honored by god to be a minister
[1:21:08] or to be an evangelist
[1:21:10] or to be a prophet
[1:21:13] he said the most powerful weapon that
[1:21:15] i've ever found in my life is love
[1:21:22] the filial love
[1:21:25] which the greek word comes from
[1:21:28] friendship
[1:21:29] like you have for your wife
[1:21:32] there's a difference
[1:21:34] it'll make
[1:21:35] a mother
[1:21:36] for that baby run into a blazing fire
[1:21:39] her life means nothing he said that's
[1:21:42] filial love
[1:21:44] what will agape do the godly love
[1:21:48] he says we must love
[1:21:50] divine love one another divinely love
[1:21:54] one another
[1:21:56] he says then you don't see your
[1:21:59] brother's mistake
[1:22:02] even though the devil comes and goes
[1:22:04] like this
[1:22:05] get by me satan
[1:22:08] divine love does that yes
[1:22:12] if he does make a mistake you look over
[1:22:14] the top of it and you love him anyhow
[1:22:19] see
[1:22:20] that's it
[1:22:21] and he quotes jesus if you love those
[1:22:24] that love you then doesn't the sin are
[1:22:26] the same thing
[1:22:28] the sinner does the same thing
[1:22:30] he says but love those
[1:22:32] who doesn't love you
[1:22:35] you know what we're scared half the time
[1:22:37] to talk to somebody who don't love us
[1:22:39] that's true
[1:22:41] we're scared we're going to get hurt
[1:22:44] love is powerful
[1:22:46] it is the most powerful force
[1:22:50] agape love
[1:22:53] i'd just say
[1:22:55] we need to get in the same boat with
[1:22:56] jesus that's where he's at
[1:22:59] real friendship
[1:23:02] he said
[1:23:04] but love those that doesn't love you he
[1:23:06] said that's what shows the spirit of god
[1:23:09] is in you
[1:23:10] that's what shows the spirit of god in
[1:23:12] you
[1:23:13] because he loved you when you were his
[1:23:16] enemy
[1:23:17] and he loved you
[1:23:19] and the spirit's in you it'll make you
[1:23:21] love your enemy as you do your friend
[1:23:25] oh to me this is powerful this is rich
[1:23:29] this is what i hunger for
[1:23:31] th this is what i long for in my life
[1:23:35] i want to lay everything aside for more
[1:23:38] of this
[1:23:42] in other words god is going to do the
[1:23:44] same thing in you
[1:23:46] and through you that he did outside of
[1:23:49] you
[1:23:54] somebody
[1:23:55] you saw somebody love you
[1:23:58] you saw somebody love you when you
[1:24:01] didn't deserve it
[1:24:03] doesn't that put you in debt
[1:24:05] to go love somebody that doesn't deserve
[1:24:08] it in your eyes
[1:24:13] in the message the unchanging word of
[1:24:15] god brother ram says you know i wish
[1:24:17] people loved one another again like they
[1:24:20] like that don't you
[1:24:21] oh my
[1:24:22] they're cold
[1:24:24] aren't they yes
[1:24:25] just as cold as a wart on a pickle
[1:24:29] he says i never seen anything in my
[1:24:32] life like it oh it's terrible
[1:24:35] nobody has any more
[1:24:38] friendship
[1:24:40] jesus did say because iniquity would
[1:24:43] abound the love of many would wax cold
[1:24:46] that's the hour that we're living in
[1:24:49] in this world that is abound in iniquity
[1:24:52] where love has become paper-thin
[1:24:54] storefront
[1:24:56] come on and hate is seen everywhere the
[1:24:59] holy spirit inside of us is still the
[1:25:01] same today
[1:25:04] it still can love beyond that
[1:25:07] it can still love the unlovable
[1:25:11] i'll just say it like this
[1:25:14] god said to abraham
[1:25:16] is anything too hard for the lord
[1:25:21] is it too hard for the lord to love
[1:25:23] through you
[1:25:25] no
[1:25:27] not if you just let them yeah
[1:25:29] not if you just die out to how great you
[1:25:32] are
[1:25:34] and the pride
[1:25:36] and the things that are standing in the
[1:25:37] way from reducing yourself to love
[1:25:41] he said i'll be with you even in you to
[1:25:44] the end doing what loving your enemies
[1:25:49] we are becoming one with god through the
[1:25:51] power of the holy spirit
[1:25:54] how many want to be friends a friend to
[1:25:56] jesus
[1:25:58] you know friends
[1:25:59] help others
[1:26:02] brother mike was
[1:26:04] telling me about his son that came to
[1:26:06] him or in the men's meeting
[1:26:09] that he came to him as a father and just
[1:26:12] i
[1:26:13] dad i want this and
[1:26:15] brother mike said well what are you
[1:26:17] going to do for me
[1:26:20] and i thought well
[1:26:21] i wonder if jesus
[1:26:25] asked that question to us
[1:26:26] when we come to him
[1:26:29] what will you do for me because friends
[1:26:30] help one another
[1:26:33] john chapter 15 verse 10. are you
[1:26:35] getting something out of this
[1:26:38] jesus said in john 15 verse 10 if you if
[1:26:41] you keep my commandments you shall abide
[1:26:45] in my love
[1:26:46] even as i kept my father's commandments
[1:26:48] and abide in his love now there's a lot
[1:26:50] of commandments but the one that christ
[1:26:52] is bringing us to
[1:26:54] is to be able to love like he loves
[1:26:56] that's the one he's bringing us to
[1:26:59] that's where you love your enemies you
[1:27:00] bless them that curse you you do good
[1:27:03] unto them that that use you you pray for
[1:27:05] them
[1:27:06] i'll tell you
[1:27:08] there should be something inside the
[1:27:10] believer that's not afraid
[1:27:12] not afraid
[1:27:14] of of what happens when you're in the
[1:27:17] presence of your enemy
[1:27:20] these things have i spoken unto you that
[1:27:22] my joy might remain with you and that
[1:27:24] your joy might be
[1:27:26] full
[1:27:28] i want my joy full
[1:27:30] i don't want a little bit
[1:27:31] i hate to say it
[1:27:33] but the joy the lord is my strength and
[1:27:34] i want more amen i want to be so full of
[1:27:37] joy
[1:27:39] this is my commandment that you love one
[1:27:41] another
[1:27:42] as i have loved you
[1:27:45] that's a big stipulation
[1:27:48] to love like he loved the only way that
[1:27:50] could ever happen
[1:27:52] is him loving through me
[1:27:55] because i can't manufacture it
[1:27:57] i can't do it
[1:28:00] i tried in the world having these
[1:28:02] relationships well if if you're this way
[1:28:04] if you're nice if you agree with me
[1:28:06] we're going to get the same boat
[1:28:10] but to get in the boat with jesus here
[1:28:12] we've got to love like he loved us
[1:28:16] that's the bone of fellowship he's
[1:28:18] calling us to get in
[1:28:20] that's right and i'll tell you
[1:28:22] it's not easy
[1:28:24] you gotta let go of your hate
[1:28:27] you've got to let go of your differences
[1:28:29] you got to let go of your starchy
[1:28:31] self-righteousness you got to let go of
[1:28:34] everything and be able to look beyond
[1:28:36] and love like god loves
[1:28:44] how many wants to be a friend to jesus a
[1:28:46] friend to jesus
[1:28:49] he said in verse 14.
[1:28:51] oh
[1:28:53] no verse 11. sorry sorry these things
[1:28:55] have i spoken unto you
[1:28:57] i'm so sorry where am i at
[1:29:00] verse 12. thank you thanks
[1:29:02] somebody's paying attention praise the
[1:29:04] lord this is my commandment that you
[1:29:06] love one others i have loved you greater
[1:29:07] love have no man than this then a man
[1:29:10] lay down his life for his friends
[1:29:13] now notice he's using friends
[1:29:16] so at this time this is not
[1:29:20] brother mark
[1:29:21] and brother marty
[1:29:23] and sister tricia
[1:29:25] no
[1:29:26] this is the person out there who has
[1:29:29] used me who has hurt me who has stabbed
[1:29:31] me in the back
[1:29:33] that's my friend
[1:29:35] that's my friend i just draw a bigger
[1:29:37] circle
[1:29:38] i lay down my life for my friends
[1:29:42] because jesus call judas a friend
[1:29:45] amen he's asking us to get in the same
[1:29:47] boat
[1:29:50] now ye are my friend
[1:29:52] jesus said ye are my friends
[1:29:55] if
[1:29:57] you do whatsoever i commanded you
[1:30:00] wow
[1:30:02] now we're we're taking that that
[1:30:04] friendship a little bit higher
[1:30:07] it's no longer i died for you
[1:30:10] now i'm calling you to get in the boat
[1:30:11] with me
[1:30:13] let's have some real fellowship
[1:30:16] two friends on the same page that agree
[1:30:19] with the same thing going in the same
[1:30:21] direction brother brad said if he could
[1:30:23] just get one man in his hand
[1:30:25] in the same boat going the same
[1:30:26] direction a lot of times we want to go
[1:30:28] that one way jesus wants us to go the
[1:30:30] other way right that's true
[1:30:32] you each got one ore and you're going in
[1:30:34] a circle
[1:30:36] get nowhere right
[1:30:38] here my friends if you do whatsoever i
[1:30:41] command you henceforth i call you not
[1:30:45] servants
[1:30:46] for the servant not know what is lord do
[1:30:48] it but
[1:30:49] i have called you friends
[1:30:53] for all things that i have heard of my
[1:30:55] father i have made known unto you
[1:30:59] this is
[1:31:00] beautiful if you really want the
[1:31:03] revelation
[1:31:05] of this word
[1:31:06] if you want it to be opened to you
[1:31:10] it comes with a cost
[1:31:15] you got to get in the boat
[1:31:19] revelation
[1:31:20] he's the doorkeeper
[1:31:22] it comes from him
[1:31:24] we either take the time
[1:31:26] to say lord i want to follow everything
[1:31:28] you got i'm serious i want to i want to
[1:31:30] know you more or we're going to do what
[1:31:32] the majority of the church world does i
[1:31:33] know god enough he saved me
[1:31:39] i really love how our brother
[1:31:41] ferguson brought out some rich things
[1:31:45] some very rich things yes
[1:31:49] he says you
[1:31:50] have not chosen me but i've chosen you
[1:31:53] and ordained you that you should go
[1:31:54] forth and bring forth fruit and that
[1:31:56] your fruit should remain and and
[1:31:58] whatsoever you shall ask of the father
[1:31:59] in my name he will give it to you these
[1:32:02] things i command you that you love one
[1:32:03] another now what is the fruit
[1:32:06] what is the fruit
[1:32:08] i've chosen you and i've ordained you
[1:32:11] to bring forth fruit now what fruit is
[1:32:14] he talking about
[1:32:17] well we know jesus said you shall know
[1:32:19] them by their fruits right
[1:32:22] it's not so much what clothes you're
[1:32:24] wearing right it's not being in sheep's
[1:32:26] clothing it's really being able
[1:32:31] to love your enemy and lay down your
[1:32:34] life for your enemy that's the fruit
[1:32:36] now he says i've ordained you
[1:32:39] to bring forth that fruit
[1:32:43] don't stay where we're at
[1:32:45] but press towards that and then he says
[1:32:47] once you get it
[1:32:48] let it remain don't just say i did it
[1:32:50] one time let it remain
[1:32:52] keep because as soon as you start really
[1:32:54] loving one enemy you'll have more
[1:32:56] strength to love another that's true
[1:32:58] you know you just build off of it
[1:33:02] zechariah 13 verse 6
[1:33:04] and one shall say unto him this is when
[1:33:07] we get on the other side
[1:33:11] what are these wounds
[1:33:13] in thine hands
[1:33:17] then he shall answer
[1:33:19] those
[1:33:21] which those with which i was wounded
[1:33:25] in the house
[1:33:26] of my
[1:33:27] friends
[1:33:29] aren't you glad he didn't cut you off
[1:33:33] i feel it was
[1:33:34] me hammering amen
[1:33:40] it was for me he died it was for my sins
[1:33:45] but how many times when christ came to
[1:33:47] us before we surrendered we said no
[1:33:52] brother brandon says they're crucifying
[1:33:54] the lord afresh
[1:33:57] thank god
[1:33:58] for his love for his mercy and i want to
[1:34:01] say it today i want to thank god for the
[1:34:03] holy ghost that it can actually live in
[1:34:05] a human being and produce the same thing
[1:34:08] today because he is the same yesterday
[1:34:10] today and forever
[1:34:13] we just got to get excited about that
[1:34:16] we got to keep keep going in that
[1:34:18] direction
[1:34:19] and not stay content with what we have
[1:34:21] yes
[1:34:24] now
[1:34:25] if you want god to call you his friend
[1:34:28] you need to get in the boat with him
[1:34:32] because there's a difference
[1:34:34] between god calling you friend
[1:34:36] and being his friend
[1:34:41] you got to be in fellowship with his
[1:34:42] language
[1:34:44] do what he says
[1:34:45] love like he loves
[1:34:47] if you want to be closer to god if you
[1:34:49] want a closer friendship with god i want
[1:34:52] to say this start spending more time
[1:34:54] with with him in prayer and this is so
[1:34:57] beautiful because that's what our
[1:34:58] brother spoke on was prayer in our men's
[1:35:00] meeting
[1:35:02] draw an eye to god like enoch did
[1:35:05] just keep walking with him closer and
[1:35:08] closer with an expectation something's
[1:35:10] going to happen if not you're just going
[1:35:12] to go right back out in the world that's
[1:35:15] true
[1:35:16] wandering
[1:35:19] in the wilderness
[1:35:20] waiting for
[1:35:24] walk with him walk closer to his word
[1:35:27] set your affections upon him
[1:35:29] store up some treasures in heaven
[1:35:32] get away from the earth
[1:35:34] amen luke chapter 11 verse 2
[1:35:37] we have to hurry because time
[1:35:39] is getting
[1:35:40] away luke
[1:35:43] and we're talking about how to get our
[1:35:45] friendship stronger with christ
[1:35:48] we want to end
[1:35:50] with this thought
[1:35:52] and he said unto them when ye pray
[1:35:56] say our father which art in heaven
[1:35:57] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:35:59] thy will be done as it as in heaven so
[1:36:03] in earth
[1:36:05] what do you think brother ferguson
[1:36:07] [Laughter]
[1:36:09] these notes are already there
[1:36:13] give us
[1:36:14] daily
[1:36:16] give us day by day our daily bread
[1:36:18] brother ferguson really brought out thy
[1:36:20] will be done as in heaven so in earth
[1:36:24] that we are the earth
[1:36:26] it's we want god's
[1:36:28] we
[1:36:29] we want the whole the only way the will
[1:36:31] of god's going to be done in our life is
[1:36:32] we get filled with more of god's spirit
[1:36:34] amen
[1:36:36] it will carry out his will
[1:36:38] forgive us of our sins
[1:36:40] for we also forgive everyone that is
[1:36:42] indebted to us and lead us not to
[1:36:44] temptation but deliver us from evil
[1:36:46] and he says which of you shall have a
[1:36:49] friend
[1:36:50] and shall go on to him at midnight
[1:36:54] and saying friend
[1:36:56] i need three loaves of bread
[1:36:58] for a friend of mine
[1:37:01] in his journey has come to me and i have
[1:37:03] nothing to set before him and he from
[1:37:06] within he won't say it allowed but from
[1:37:09] within shall answer and say oh troubling
[1:37:12] not
[1:37:12] the door shut i'm with my children in
[1:37:14] bed i cannot rise and give it to you
[1:37:17] it's crazy you're calling me at midnight
[1:37:22] i say unto you
[1:37:24] though he will not rise and give him
[1:37:26] because he is a friend
[1:37:29] yet because of his in
[1:37:31] poor tunity
[1:37:33] the urgency he will rise and give him as
[1:37:37] many as he needeth why
[1:37:40] because it's his friend
[1:37:45] if you're a friend of jesus you don't
[1:37:48] have any problem laying down your life
[1:37:52] they will help somebody
[1:37:55] because jesus can't help them outside of
[1:37:57] a vessel
[1:37:59] i mean
[1:38:00] god could sit back and have his bride do
[1:38:02] nothing and just get all the predestined
[1:38:05] in and
[1:38:06] but that's not how he functions
[1:38:09] he uses us and what an honor to let god
[1:38:12] use our vessels
[1:38:16] to bring somebody in to help somebody to
[1:38:19] get them closer to open their eyes he
[1:38:22] told paul i've called you
[1:38:24] to open the eyes of them that are blind
[1:38:28] there is a part that paul played
[1:38:31] and we have a part to play
[1:38:33] don't be dismayed because somebody can't
[1:38:35] see the truth
[1:38:37] lay down your life for them well they're
[1:38:39] just going to step on me that's okay
[1:38:41] because they may see it eventually
[1:38:44] and you will never regret it but you
[1:38:46] will regret if you don't let them
[1:38:52] oh i love these scriptures
[1:38:59] and i say unto you verse 9 ask
[1:39:02] now he's bringing it back to us it's no
[1:39:04] different than a friend because jesus is
[1:39:07] a real friend to us
[1:39:09] he says ask and it shall be given you
[1:39:12] seek and you shall find knock and it
[1:39:15] shall be open unto you he's a real
[1:39:19] friend
[1:39:20] but we got to do our part
[1:39:23] we can't just sit there and say lazily i
[1:39:26] need you lord
[1:39:27] help me
[1:39:29] no we gotta humble herself
[1:39:32] come knock on the door just like this
[1:39:34] man did
[1:39:36] he's
[1:39:37] sleeping maybe he didn't come the first
[1:39:38] time maybe he was fast asleep
[1:39:42] kind of woken up whoa
[1:39:46] we've got to be
[1:39:47] willing to call on god

[1:41:15] i loved it
[1:41:16] we i
[1:41:18] i just loved it so much
[1:41:21] because there's nothing inhibiting
[1:41:24] i need to be taught i want to be inspire

[1:41:38] think i'm so good i don't have to be
[1:41:40] here
[1:41:42] i'm so good enough to come to church no
[1:41:43] more
[1:41:44] i don't think it's going to be like that
[1:41:47] i think the more i'm going to see i need
[1:41:48] to be here
[1:41:52] the more i long to be here
[1:41:55] the more of the holy ghost a believer
[1:41:58] has
[1:41:59] the more he will manifest perfect love
[1:42:03] and that's really the end game i know
[1:42:05] that i can't do it myself and all i can
[1:42:08] do it was his help
[1:42:10] and the help is me get out of the way so
[1:42:12] he can get in the way
[1:42:15] amen
[1:42:16] i know the more the holy ghost i get
[1:42:19] the less hostile
[1:42:21] i'll be
[1:42:23] the more
[1:42:24] i i
[1:42:26] the more i'll be inclined
[1:42:29] to be in meek
[1:42:32] humble
[1:42:33] gentle
[1:42:35] sounds like the fruit of the spirit
[1:42:38] won't have to worry i always remember
[1:42:40] what brother johnson used to say
[1:42:42] you don't ever have to worry about a
[1:42:44] praying man he won't hurt you
[1:42:47] if a man is really praying in the spirit
[1:42:50] he won't hurt you
[1:42:53] and this is the place we all should long
[1:42:55] to get to
[1:42:57] just look in the the course of the last
[1:42:59] week what you said what you done what
[1:43:01] you thought

[1:44:00] but he's chosen this place that we've
[1:44:02] dedicated to
[1:44:04] him let him
[1:44:06] minister and then take that word and
