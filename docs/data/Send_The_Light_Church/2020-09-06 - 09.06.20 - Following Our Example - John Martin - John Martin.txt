TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh seated uh this morning we we will be going through a quite a few scriptures and we're going to be going kind of fast and that's what happens when you get a lot a lot of time to study up north amen before we begin reading first peter chapter 2 verse 21 let's look to the author of this word our heavenly father we thank you lord that you've put it in our hearts to be in your house today amen that desire is so precious we thank you for it lord we thank you that you've given us health and strength to be here and lord we thank you for your word we know that anyone anyone can open the pages of this book and read it and get some sort of understanding but to get the correct understanding to know exactly what it is that you're trying to speak to us with that scripture lord it takes the holy spirit we humbly pray that you'd come today in every one of our hearts and our minds as we go through these scriptures lord that you reveal to us the true meaning for our lives lord we know that your word can speak to those that don't know you and speak to those lord that have just come to know you that have started to walk in this great race towards heaven lord thy word has the ability that same word has the ability to get your bride ready those that are sealed with the holy ghost to know what you'd have them to do so lord we pray that you take the same word today in all of our ears and that you'd quicken life to us lord we need thy word to become life inside of us so real lord for you are this word we ask that it would come from the pages into our hearts now as we commit this service into your hands for your honor and glory we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen amen first peter chapter 2 verse 21 for even here and too were you called because christ also suffered for us i'm thankful that christ suffered for you leaving us an example that we should follow his steps amen in matthew chapter 5 so his suffering was not in vain it was an example for us matthew chapter 5 starting with verse 43 and i want you to think as you think we go through these scriptures here what it really takes to do them it takes suffering you have heard that it had been said that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh the sun to rise on the evil and the good and sendeth reign on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you you're not even the publicans the same if you salute your brethren only those that of the church what do you more than others do not even the public and so but ye be therefore perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen god bless you may be seated that's uh when we think about the love of god it's a wonderful thing to experience it is amazing there's really no other no other feeling that is greater to experience than the love of god of course it affects us in different ways that love can bring a conviction it can also uh pardon you um but the the presence of god's love is is simply amazing but to be just like jesus's heavenly father in heaven to love like he loves is is an example of suffering it's difficult it's hard we live in a a very confused world as we're all becoming more and more apparent we live in a identity crisis society where people are increasingly losing track of who they are we're living in a social media addiction people can't seem to get off their phone that's right and an epidemic am i saying that word right or that drug that new drug opid edema opioid thank you brother it's becoming more and more fluent in our society it's become a problem we have a student loan crisis that we're dealing with university of chicago called air pollution the world's top killer in the past year the who officially classified a work burnout as a medical diagnosis traffic has gotten so bad that people who drive on a regular basis spend 54 hours a year just sitting in their car in traffic not moving rates diabetes rates are increasing and life expectancy is on a decline not only is that on a decline but happiness is on decline amen hatred is hiding behind political parties and hate crimes are escalating as we know perversion continues to increase and hide even behind religious realms there isn't anyone that we can look to in this world full of confusion there's no one that we can look to for an example but we have an example to follow in god's word amen to get us out of the mess that this world is in and get us ready for a rapture like to entitle this message follow in our example following our example second timothy chapter 3 verse 16 says that all scripture is given to us for a specific reason it's inspired by god and it is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that we the men of god the men and women of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished onto all good works now by far we in this church are not perfect i do believe god makes up the difference i believe we're pressing towards that mark and this word is our example to follow but it's scary today because every believer today faces satan's ultimate question do we really have to follow this example in the bible can't we still make it without following the example he speaks it to all of us there are many different types of examples in the bible and all are important but this very crucial one is the example that we use to follow for our lives let's take a look at the example that god has given us in his word we have a lot of scriptures but in this opening scripture to love our enemies to do good that to them that hate us and to pray for them that use us and not just use us once in a while but kind of despitefully they know they can get away with it our natural parents in some fashion formal way taught us that there was a difference between those that deal with them kindly and those that they would consider not to be real friends is that true all of our parents that did they maybe didn't say there's your enemy and there's your friend but in some fashion formal way we could tell by their life that who their friends were and who their enemies were amen but jesus is saying don't follow this example don't follow this leadership anyone can love somebody that does good to them there's no reward handed out for that but be like my heavenly father let him be your example follow that example because when you love those who don't love you there's a reward for that and i want that reward because to me that reward is perfection it's not some you know some some reward like this it's a life that's full of christ what other reward could we want this example that jesus gave us to follow is a hard example to follow considering that our nature is selfish to begin with we don't want to just hand out uh uh uh love to someone that we think don't deserve it we notice that this example of love is also an example of how to suffer to achieve it amen people think they can achieve the love of god without suffering you can't right you can't you're just trying to perfect your own love that won't work jesus made it clear to anyone that desires to follow him that it wasn't going to be easy when jesus called his his first few disciples andrew and and peter and he said to them come and i'll make you fishers of men you know they didn't realize that it was going to be more than just a a career change they were maybe kind of excited at one time to follow jesus but they did not realize that they would have to give up their own desire to live for somebody else that have to give up fishing for themselves to fish for men if they were going to live for others that means they could no longer live for themselves and this this this invitation that jesus made to them really went against the grain of their flesh it wasn't popular satan asks us do we really have to follow that example isn't it different for us and jesus paid for it all we do have to follow the example amen we need to follow the example that jesus jesus laid out in the word turn with me if you would to luke chapter 9 verse 22 jesus speaking here he said the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected the elders and the chief priests and scribes and be slain and be raised the third day but it doesn't stop there he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me in other words i'm going to have to suffer that's true but if you're going to follow me you're going to have to suffer as well that's all there is to it not going to be easy so i'll say it in this difficult situation that we're facing to follow christ if we just give up our will lay down our lives and follow the example amen this world has fallen apart satan is still asking us the question do we really have to follow this example in god's word i'll tell you it's the very same thing that jesus spoke to paul in acts chapter 9 verse 16 he said for i will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake now why is god going to show him how much great things he's going to have to suffer but he's going to let me off the hook what kind of god is that i think our gods will respect our persons do we really need to follow that example brother john jesus knew the temptation that every man would have concerning this and he said in luke chapter 9 verse 24 for whosoever will save his life shall lose it right amen but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it amen for what advantage for what is a man's advantage if he gained the whole world gets everything he wants and loses himself or be a castaway amen himself you think if you're getting everything you want how could you be losing yourself because yourself is your soul the flesh is going to perish it's going to get old it's gonna get wrinkly i i think the last time that sister trina saw me she she saw some darker hair on me you you lose whatever you do have look at the great example that jesus set before us in the garden of eden no the garden of gethsemane when he asked his disciples would you just pray with me for an hour of course they struggled doing that a few times they didn't want to ain't no different than today and he went and he prayed and he said father if it be possible would you let this cup pass from me now look at his example that he gave for us amen we know satan offered him everything that he could have wanted made it easy for him but he gave us the example when he said father not my will thy will be done yes that is our example today right amen it wasn't comfortable for his flesh it wasn't meant to be comfortable for his flesh in fact flesh and blood can't inherit the kingdom of god they that are in the flesh are stinky to god when you're in the spirit that means you're out of the flesh now god can deal with you oh must jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me but you know i have a choice to either look at the example and pick it up or choose to leave it there leave suffering at church and go do my thing at home jesus gave us an example to follow jesus had to forsake his own will for the father's will we have to forsake our will for jesus's will luke chapter 14 verse 25 and there were great multitudes with him and he turned and he said unto them if any man come after me and hate not his father and his mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters yay even his own life he cannot be my disciple so you see here it wasn't just an isolated situation for his disciples right any man that decides to follow christ and whosoever does not bear his own cross and come after me he cannot be my disciple you know many people claim to be a disciple of jesus but they won't pick up a cross the world's full of them all of them but jesus didn't sugarcoat it now i know a lot of people don't want to preach this they'd rather go to a church that don't preach it and i don't when it comes to their flesh i understand that i don't blame them but when it comes to their soul i do not understand that because they're using their own mind as an absolute jesus said in verse 33 so likewise whosoever be of you that forsaketh not all that he have he can't even be his disciple right forsaking awe is the complete requirement for all of our lives we all face that every day a w told her he said the reason why many are still troubled still seeking still making little forward progress is because they haven't yet come to the end of themselves we're still trying to give orders and interfere with god's work that's happening inside of us so we see the world falling apart satan prompts the question in our minds but do we really have to follow that example luke chapter 9 verse 57 and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him lord i decided that i'm going to follow thee wheresoever thou goest and jesus said unto him i want you to be aware that the foxes have holes and the birds have of the air have nests but the son of man does not have uh where to lay his head and he said unto another follow me and he said lord suffer me first to go and bury my father look at the answer that he gave let the dead bury the dead go thou and what win souls go and win souls right bring somebody to the kingdom that wasn't in there and another also said lord i will follow thee let me first go and bid them farewell that are at my home and at my house jesus said unto him no man having started to walk this race to work this work to put his hand to the plow taking a second to look back is fit for god's kingdom amen i'll tell you i have fallen so short of this example and if you're honest with yourself you can say the same thing today as we go through these examples to follow we're going to see that these examples are really not very pleasant for our flesh but yet they're our example let's take a look at another one here in saint john 13 verse 3. jesus knowing that the father had given him all things in his hands and he was come from god and he went to god he raised from supper and laid his garments and took a towel and girded himself and after he poured water into a basin he began to wash the disciples feet to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded and he cometh to simon peter and peter said to out them lord does that wash my feet what are you doing jesus answered and said to him why what i do thou knowest not a lot of things that happened to our life that god does we don't know what he's doing when he's doing it but thou shall know hereafter peter sayeth unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i wash not if i wash thee not thou has no part with me peter saith on him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head trying to get him on the right path but you know peter was a ch one side of the dish or the other and jesus said then he that is washed needeth not to save wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said ye are not all clean so after they washed their feet and taken the garment and sat down again he said unto them know ye what i've done unto you good question do you know why this message is being preached this morning you call me master and lord and you say well for i am for saw him if then your lord master washed your feet y'all also to wash one another's feet now look at this verse i said all that to say this for i have given you an example what do i do with this example that you should do as i have done to you now do we have to follow the example that's what we need to tell the devil when he tells us or asks us do i really need to do what's being said verily verily i say unto you that the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent them if ye know these things well that's good that you know them right but you're only going to be happy if you do them amen you can't be happy knowing you should wash your brother's feet but after you get done washing somebody's feet and get your hands dirty and help them out a little bit in life you will be very happy inside because it's christ in you just when you the more you give the more lord gives you you can't out give the lord keep giving and god will keep blessing you amen first peter chapter 2 verse 17 honor all men love the brother and fear god and honor the king servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the fro where it sounds like you're opening scripture for this is thank worthy if a man for conscious towards god in your grief suffering wrongfully yes amen for what glory is it when ye are buffeted for your fault you shall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is really what's acceptable with god now look at this for even unto were ye called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps so do we have to follow the success yes we have to follow the example who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but he committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who his own self bear sins and his own body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousness by whose stripes were healed for ye were a sheep going astray but now you return to the shepherd and bishop of your souls jesus left us an example of how to suffer when we have not done wrong and the carnal mind says i should never have to suffer if i have not done wrong in fact i'm just going to set the story straight that's not the example he laid for us if you don't suffer when you haven't done wrong people are really not going to see jesus you know they're going to see you so don't be a hot head don't be short fused don't try to prove who's right you're right and they're wrong don't don't try to threaten someone by cutting fellowship off with them and just you know staying away from them because of something they said or something they've done don't try to set their story straight with your worldly wisdom that's mixed with envy and strife it's only going to bring more confusion to the situation so are you going to make people feel more kooky about what's going on we have an example in christ jesus committed himself unto him that judges righteously we need to learn in those situations just to commit ourself unto christ who will judge the situation correctly amen james chapter 3 verse 13 who is a wise man and to do with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his worth with meekness of wisdom but the wisdom that is from above is first pure peaceable general easy to be entreated full of mercy good fruits without partiality without hypocrisy i'll tell you if you're producing that it's christ it won't be you it's christ and it comes out of someone that's filled with the spirit of god amen and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace that make peace you're a maker right you know there are people that cause trouble and there's people that take trouble and make peace they take trouble and they make peace we're all one we're we we're all the time exercising one of the two and the holy ghost makes peace it's a fruit of the holy ghost but this flesh is no friend of peace it stirs things up it likes to be on top right amen one way to get on top is to get somebody else below first corinthians chapter 11 verse 1 be ye followers now kind of leaving the example of christ and coming towards paul and paul is saying follow me be followers of me even as i also am of christ amen it is very much in order to follow a man as long as he's following christ god chose man's preaching to get men to follow christ amen that's what he chose and you want people to follow you if you're leading them to christ but if you're leading them to your way of thinking about christ get away from that amen be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ paul's heart of love never wanted people to follow him especially if he got off the word but if he knew that he had a chance to help somebody he wanted people to follow him down the straight and narrow path uh a life of self-crucifixion a a life where he said i die daily a life where he said to present your body a living sacrifice that is though that is the example that paul wanted you to follow the paul that not the old paul not the saul who was just into how great he was right and give all that up follow me as i know nothing except jesus christ and him crucified amen but he knew he knew because the word says that grievous wolves would come in when he would depart and that spirit would be upon them a spirit that would divide and he knew that the there would be false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves the bible says into the apostles of christ and in second corinthians chapter 11 verse 14 it says and no marble for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light amen there is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as ministers of righteousness uh uh also be transformed as ministers are righteous whose end shall be according to their works so if satan can do it his ministers can do it right verse 18 seeing that many glory after the flesh i will glory also so the reason that they do this is because of their flesh if they were in the spirit their whole desire would to put jesus christ first in their life but now here he is he's going to say many seem to glory after the flesh i would like to spend some time and uh glory also paul recognized many people men and women want to glory in their flesh when they minister to others you know kind of like bragging bragging about themselves along the way paul said i'd like to brag to so how many want to hear paul bragg but is bragging look foolish to others so if i'm going to brag i'm going to brag about what great things i've done look at me look what i've achieved that's the normal way of breaking but paul's way of bragging was foolish to others he says in verse 22 are they hebrews so am i are they israelites so am i are they the seed of abraham so am i to this point they were identical you couldn't tell the ministers apart the word of the hour at that moment was identical but paul said in first thessalonians chapter 1 verse 5 we're just going to jump off into scripture here for a second for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance as you know not as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake so now he's going he's going to show the difference between the ministers because some ministers or they speaking of came only in word they only ministered in word but it wasn't in power and it wasn't in the holy ghost we'll talk a little bit about this differently down the road here paul didn't just have a form of godliness here is where he begins to uh separate the ministries he said verse 23 are they the ministers of christ i speak as a fool i am more labor more abundant in stripes and above measure in prisons more frequent and deaths often well that's foolish why do you need to labor more jesus paid it all of the jews five times received by 40 stripes save one that's foolish who wants to do that thrice i was beat with rods once i was stoned thrice i was shipwrecked night day i've been in the deep in journeys often in pearls of water and perils of robbers in perils of my own countrymen in perils of heathens and perils in the city in perils from the wilderness imperials and the sea perils among false brethren peril in weariness and painfulness and watchings often hunger and thirsty father in cold and nakedness man none of them testify like that right now they're bragging like that this to me sounds foolish but those things which are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches jesus really did show him how great of things he must suffer amen jesus really did give him a revelation of what it means to know him in the fellowship of his sufferings and i believe that jesus gave faith to paul to be able to go through that to me it takes power to go through that and to keep going that's what power is you know you don't have to have any ghosts excuse me any holy ghost to preach my seven kids preached to me all their life when they were growing up telling me how to be a better parent and what they really needed but to see one of them lay down their life [Music] when they were wronged and still do the right thing that takes a denial of flesh only the holy ghost is going to do that in somebody amen nobody is born with that nature that's why we need to get the holy ghost because when you are so filled with the holy ghost it just automatically happens yes you don't got to try to make it happen as long as you're willing to die daily god is willing to manifest himself in her life in our message language today we call this living for others now the carnal mind says well this is pretty stupid when jesus paid it all and i can just do what i want to do jesus still loves me and i got that rock solid revelation every believer this morning faces the question from satan do we really have to follow this example brother john we know these scriptures you've preached so many of them to us all right not done i want to finish verse 29 and 30 who is weak am i not weak who is offended i burn not if i must needs i will glory of the things which concern my infirmities he finishes off this thought in second corinthians chapter 12 verse 10 therefore i take pleasures in my infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions in distress for christ's sake for when i'm weak then i'm strong learn to just commit myself to god yes amen paul never wanted believers to follow a ministry who preached the gospel in word only whose life denied the power of truly believing the gospel a power that's willing to suffer for others philippians chapter 3 verse 10 paul's saying that i might know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death you talk about fellowship with jesus are you willing to suffer for jesus amen that's what true fellowship is everybody wants the good side of jesus the santa claus side where you get everything that you ask for but nobody wants to talk about the side what jesus is asking for in the relationship and everything that he's asking for is taking a denial of the flesh he you don't even get along with the flesh it ain't subject to his will it it indeed it cannot be the bible says there's an enmity there's a there's a division there's a gate there and he doesn't go in and try to get satan's uh nature to conform to his no he gave us what to do deny it crucify it paul said i die daily was the only way that christ could be in his life enough willing to suffer for others because if paul never denied his life if he never crucified his life he would never be able to live that life he said can you pull up first galatians chapter 2 verse 20 amen for i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet it's not really me but it's christ that liveth in me and the life which i now live i in the flesh in the same flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved he gave himself for me i am crucified with christ now you take this out and just say you know i'm a message believer with christ it's a totally different mindset we want to follow the example in the word amen amen not what satan wants to misinterpret to us all right hebrews chapter 13 verse 7 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god look at whose faith follow now consider the end of their conversation the end is exactly what the beginning was jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen so consider the end of the conversation our example was yesterday jesus and paul and our that's what we're supposed to follow today it will be our example forever amen jesus will have the very scars in the palm of his hands in heaven wanting you to think about his suffering for you in a heaven full of joy and peace and love well i'll tell you i've never regretted laying down my life for somebody it gives me love it gives me joy it gives me peace it's the times that i was unwilling to do that my flesh got out of the way that's the time i regret that's the time i'm missing joy christ was our example paul was our example the prophet in this hour is our example be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ paul did not want us to follow him if he got off just a little bit come on galatians chapter 1 verse 7 which is not another but there be some that trouble you how do they trouble you they would pervert the gospel of christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed yes so tell me do we have to follow this example be careful how you answer that you can bring in a curse on yourself brother branham said in the message the absolute if you can read in the scripture something that christ has ordained or commissioned us to do and because of some twisted around if someone would try to tell you that was for the disciples or someone else and then you don't hold on to that as your example to follow he said then christ is not your absolute that person who led you out of the way is your absolute yes and that's why paul wanted us to stay with the word amen but if that word christ still holds see then he's your absolute we mustn't let anything stir us out of the way of the word see some of them today is going on to get more than ever as the days go by that we're going to see people with this as jesus said a form of godliness well he misquoted it was uh paul who said that and just a a form is coming into we had it in the methodists in the baptist and so forth for years he says but now it's creeping into the pentecostals i'm saying it's creeped into the message you know they all just said well i'm a lutheran i'm a methodist i'm a pentecostal i spoke in tongues i'm in the message i believe brother branham a form as long as you hold to that no power not living the message nothing new just the same old symbol verse 9 going back to galatians chapter 1 verse 9 as we said before so i say now again if any men preach any other gospel unto you than what we have received than what you have already received let that person be accursed right wow i mean we're supposed to love one another but if a person is trying to twist a little bit just get you off you know when you start you know you if you're going to be 100 miles apart from one another when you start out it's just a little just a little angle yes we should hunger for the revelation of the example in this word hunger for thirst for it not be a stuffed shirt that you already got it for do i now persuade men or god do i seek to please men for if i yet please men i should not be the servant of christ think about that if i am anxious about getting your approval from me amen how can i be servant of christ but if i'm willing willing to literally almost make an enemy out of you to make you think about your relationship with christ well i think that's what made paul go through what he went through that's why he had to suffer remember when peter didn't want to jesus to have to suffer jesus told him that he was going to have to suffer likewise in matthew chapter 16 verse 23 he turned he said unto peter get thee behind me satan for thou art an offense unto me for thou savers not the things that be of god but the things that be of men well what are the things that be of men not suffering that's what's of men nobody wants to suffer nobody wants to come to church and hear about suffering come tonight you won't hear about suffering it's a different subject be more of a storytelling satan tells every one of us not to savor the things that belong to god that's true tempts us to savor the things that be appealing to our flesh but jesus left us an example to follow paul said but i certify you brethren that the gospel which i preached unto you is really not my opinion it's not of me i didn't receive it from man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ do we need that example we need that example to follow you know if we want to start pulling out this example out of the bible not deal with it we ain't no different than those that are making a new bible every every year every week every month here's a new bible it'll fit just you we got churches you some of you have past churches coming here today that literally have changed for one purpose because they can't keep people in the church open the door of just whatever you want to do is fine with me amen a lot of believers fear the thought of having to suffer and i want to deal with that they'll run to the hills do anything they can to get away from it our flesh will never want to suffer ever so forget trying to find the the key to getting it to want to do it it's just not going to want to do it you just have to accept that it's god's will god's example and deny your flesh for even here and two were you called even christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow his steps living for others is truly suffering now if i got up a wallet full of money and i give brother mark ten dollars there ain't very much suffering in that right but if i ain't got any money and i go sell something to get 10 bucks to give it to him that's suffering living if you're living for others isn't hurting you better question your living for others it's not a popular gospel but it's okay i'll stand with it second timothy chapter 1 verse 7 for god have not given us the spirit of fear timothy was dealing with this fear but a power and love and of a sound mind amen be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of the lord nor me of his prisoner but be thou a partaker of the uh of the afflictions that come with the gospel and look it's according to the power of god yes look at that not word only but power who have saved us and called us with the holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which he has given us in christ jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of our savior jesus christ who have abolished death and brought life and mortality to the light of the gospel but whereunto i'm appointed a preacher an apostle to teach of the gentiles for which because i also i also timothy suffer these same things as you're going through nevertheless i'm not ashamed of it for i know in whom i believed and i'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that today so hold fast the form of sound words which thou shared of me in faith in love which is in christ jesus hold fast the form of sound words yes amen follow the gospel example don't look for the easier way later in the chapter he said in second timothy chapter two verse nine second timothy chapter two verse nine wherein i suffer trouble as an evil doer even unto bonds but the word of god is not bond therefore he said in verse 10 i endure all things for what purpose for the elect's sake if you get your mind on why you're supposed to be suffering have a burden i injure all things for the elect's sake that they may also obtain salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory amen the chances of you just going and and having a party and winning somebody to christ with enjoyment but i'll tell you what when you're willing to suffer and get tomatoes thrown at you taught behind your back negativity after negativity somebody is going to see that and come to christ you just stay true to the word yes stay true to the word the whole world is for hypocrisy now every it's okay that we fall make mistakes that's where we'll be so blessed tonight in this this thought here what's important is that you get back up that's the name of the message tonight get up just need to get up the difference between a a a a a a real believer and anybody else a hypocrite a believer gets back up yeah amen do you know why it's so easy for people to miss when satan tells them that you really don't need to follow the example because jesus already suffered people are selfish that's why we need a revelation of what it means to know jesus christ in the fellowship of his sufferings they made the gospel all about themselves the gospel isn't about ourselves the gospel is about others it's living a life that's willing to suffer for others being a christian is actually the hardest job it's the hardest job living for yourself is quite easy living for others is the hardest job you don't got time for yourself do you think jesus told all his disciples who he had already taught for three and a half years to stay in the upper room and pray until they received the holy ghost he said in acts chapter 1 verse 8 but you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem judea and samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth why because they needed to receive a power but it wasn't the power that we usually think will power us they already had power to cast out devils matthew chapter 10 right to heal all manner of diseases they've already possessed that that's right but they didn't have power to be a true witness they did not have the power to be willing to suffer when persecution came and peter was their best example of that he thought he was a good he was good to go yeah and if jesus would have said peter just go cast out the devil out of that high priest he would have gallantly went over there and done it but he just said stand still and let god have his way he couldn't do it he denied that he even knew a person he claimed to have a relationship with that's why we need the holy ghost the holy ghost will cause you to be a proper witness a seventh day adventist not a jehovah witness now to just i'm gonna talk to you about what i believe one where you can lay down your life for their soul sake willing to suffer a lot to get them saved that's a powerful witness wait in jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high and after the holy ghost to come upon you you shall be witnesses for me a true witness paul was a true witness but there'd be some that would pervert the gospel just twist it try to make it a form brother branham says as time would increase it would become worse and worse come on now i'm really going to need you to have some extra holy ghost right now why because this message isn't real relaxing and i still have some more things i want to share with you so how many how many can put put some of that holy ghost to the front line here second timothy chapter 3 verse 10 but thou has fully known my doctrine my manner of life my purpose my faith my long suffering my charity my patience my persecutions my afflictions which came up to me into antioch iconia lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me yeah and all that will live godly in christ jesus are going to suffer these same type of things and evil men introduced your shall works worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou has learned example and has been assured of knowing of whom thou has learned them wasn't just some fly by night paul received the revelation from god himself and that from a child that was fully known the scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation well wait a minute i'm already saved it's a different gospel i don't know today's the day of salvation do you live tomorrow tomorrow's a day i i just like that i just like believing you know just i'm saying once uh saved i'm always saved and i i if i was uh if i got your life i always have it you know i just don't wanna do anything i just gotta believe that and if you preach to me anything else i'm just it's going to be confusing to me because it's not lining up with the other part of the gospel it's got a dovetail from genesis to revelations i believe in eternal security amen to the day of redemption but i believe there has to be uh i believe we have to consider the end of the conversation that jesus christ is the same today in your life as he was yesterday and somebody else's right amen first that's first timothy chapter 1 verse 15 and this is a faithful sin worthy of all acceptation that jesus christ came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief what would that make you do if you got saved and you were chief how be it for this cause i obtain mercy that in me first jesus christ might show forth all long-suffering for a pattern an example to them which should hereafter believe on him to everlasting there's a reason you need to follow this example because there's somebody else out there needs to see the real jesus see the real life the life that's willing to suffer for them we all can stand and testify jesus suffered for me he was long suffering with me he called me many times and i didn't come but i finally came and i'm ever in debt to him amen well somebody needs to see that same jesus and how are they going to see it if you're not willing to be long-suffering right you're not willing to suffer for him for him for him for him for him well he may be a part of him so you have to suffer for him paul was a great example for us paul always pointed us back to jesus christ philippians chapter 2 verse 1 if there be therefore any consolation in christ if there be any comforter there be any fellowship of the spirit if there be any vows of mercy if you want to have complete fellowship with jesus fulfill ye my joy that you be like might have the same love being a one accordion of one mind well that sounds just wonderful let's have a game of scrabble let nothing be done through strife or vainglory yes but in lowliness of mind let each esteem the other better than themselves you know what it takes to do that takes you being dead look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others now we're talking about having fellowship with jesus this is how you do it let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought in that robbery to be equal with god i want to ask you this morning do you think it would be robbery for you to be equal with god today the mind of god was equal to the mind of christ the mind of the bride is equal to the mind of christ today the mind of christ will direct you away from your flesh it will direct you to lay down your life for others it will lead you away from your own reputation from strife from vainglory it will direct you away from looking at your own things the mind of christ will look get you interested in the things of others yes look verse 7 but he made himself of no reputation and he took upon him of the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men but being found in the fashion is a man he humbled himself and he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross the mind of christ sounds like a mind equal to suffering for christ don't let satan get you to think of something different right amen if christ died to set you free he's interested in setting other people free i know for me i saw somebody living the life that got my attention it wasn't some somebody just doing their own thing and i went to a lot of concerts and i used to just kind of rate them you know who was the best and how they showed off and the things they said oh you know when you go to parties it's whoever the life of the party is but you know none of those none of them convicted me of knowing christ but when i saw somebody willing to suffer give up their will that got my attention amen that's what christ the example that he laid for us that we should be following amen thank you for bearing with me philippians chapter 4 verse 5 let your moderation be known unto some of your best friends the lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus if you want something to keep you it needs to be god amen if you open yourself up satan is the author of confusion finally brother and whatsoever things are true we just are hearing this morning a true report of the gospel what sort of things are true what sort of things are honest what sort of things are just pure lovely what several things have a good report if there be any strength if there be any praise think on these things well what what's going to happen if i follow this example i'm going to tell you what's going to happen here those things which you have both learned received heard seen in me if you do them the god of peace shall be with you amen how many wants the peace of god follow the example follow the example i can do all things through christ you strengthen me first thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13 for this calls also thank we god without ceasing because when you receive the word of god which he heard of us he received it not as it was the word of paul but as it is truth the word of god which effectually worketh in those that actually believe it remember the word did not profit the hebrews not being mixed with that's for me that's for me the promised land for me for verse 14 for ye brethren became followers of the churches of god which are in judah are in christ in judea are in christ jesus for ye also have suffered look at that light things for your own countrymen even as have the jews we're going to become a follower of somebody you're following somebody we all are follow the example in the word amen let my word be a lie but i'm not up here preaching my word stay with the word of god all heavens behind it heaven is not behind my word my word is not being preached today god's words being preached today first thessalonians 3 verse 1 wherefore when ye could no longer forebear we thought it could to be left at athens alone and sent to timotheus our brother and minister of god and our fellow labor in the gospel of christ who what establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith look at this that no man should be moved by these afflictions see the temptation for yourselves no it's been preached to you that ye are appointed thereunto for verily when ye were when we were with you we told you before that we should suffer tribulation as it came to passion you know you want to be a christian things are coming right you want to be a modern christian yeah that's true you probably aren't going to suffer remember the boy who went to college he's a christian mom at home praying oh just protect him protect him while he's away at college he's gonna go through all that persecution bonnie come home for christmas his mom asked him son how did it go at college how'd it go did you get persecuted did you have a hard time and the boy said oh mom they didn't expect a thing another gospel one where you don't show what you really believe right amen one that's all up here amen and not lived out here you live it out here you will suffer persecution you have it all up here you won't suffer it's a different gospel hebrews chapter 11 verse 24 we're almost done saints by faith moses when he had come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god and to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season it's our choice and you stop this tape whenever you need to and james chapter 5 verse 10 take my brother and the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord what for an example of what of suffering affliction and of patience they've spoken in the name of the lord as an example of suffering and fiction and a patience but we count them happy which endure for you have heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord that the lord is very pitiful and tender mercy jesus speaking in mark chapter 4 verse 16 and these are likewise which are sown on stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness and have no root in themselves and endure for a time and afterwards when afflic when affliction and persecution arises for the word sake immediately they're offended i know a lot of times we can come to church or we feel all beat up and we just you know we want the word to just you know really really you know help us because we've just been so afflicted and persecuted through the week through the week what have we done through the week to deal with that why do we expect the word to do that jesus answer to someone in that condition was not an encouraging message friends it was to get deeper rooted in your heart to have a heart that's more prepared to get the hardness out of your heart that was his answer to the to the scenario but we want something different i know i'm going to get persecuted a lot for this message no one's going to say anything to my face acts chapter 14 verse 22 confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter the kingdom of god why are we looking to enter in with just flowery revelations from the pulpit make our head spin and go wow wow and our life is no different not willing to lay down our lives wash somebody's feet get somebody saved it's a different gospel friends satan just a little bit wants to twist it you know i'd rather have you all hate me but go out of here and try harder to live for god because i've achieved my goal which is to get you closer to god let's stand together
