[36:00] these your dear children. And in all
[36:02] that said and done, may you receive unto
[36:03] yourself great glory and honor and
[36:06] praise. For that is why we've come
[36:08] together. That's why we have this time
[36:11] today that we move and live and have our
[36:13] being. Our very breath is from you and
[36:16] we acknowledge you and we love you and
[36:17] we thank you now in Jesus Christ's name.
[36:20] Amen. Amen. God bless you. It's good to
[36:22] be with you today, man. I sure like that
[36:24] song too. You know, brother Bam talks
[36:26] about that that guy, you know, he throws
[36:28] the log in the river. He's riding on. I
[36:30] just want to ride on that for a second.
[36:31] I sure appreciate what the Lord does.
[36:34] You know, I think of Abraham. You know,
[36:36] the scripture tells us when when God is
[36:39] going to he's sending the two angels
[36:41] down to Sodom and Gomorrah to destroy
[36:44] them. God asked the question to Abraham,
[36:46] "Shall I hide from Abraham the thing
[36:48] that I'm going to do, seeing I'm going
[36:50] to make of him a great nation and uh and
[36:52] all the nations of the earth shall be
[36:54] blessed in him?" He says, "For I know
[36:55] him that he will command his children
[36:58] and his household after him that they
[37:01] should keep the way of the Lord." Amen.
[37:04] So, I think about that God God
[37:05] attributes that he would he would call
[37:08] Abraham and do these things because he
[37:09] knew Abraham would command his children.
[37:11] And I I so appreciate that. There's so
[37:13] many people they they want the teacher,
[37:15] the Sunday school teacher, the pastor.
[37:17] But that's that's our it's not to me
[37:20] just a responsibility. It's a privilege.
[37:21] Amen. to get to tell my children among
[37:25] other people about the Lord Jesus
[37:27] Christ. And uh I'm I I never want to
[37:30] take it for granted. That means so much
[37:31] to me. My oldest here, he just turned 17
[37:33] the other day. So uh that was my first
[37:35] opportunity to tell my children about
[37:36] the Lord by virtue of the chronological
[37:39] order of it. So but we're happy to be
[37:42] with you today. Greet you in the name of
[37:43] the Lord Jesus Christ. If you have your
[37:45] Bibles, I invite you to turn with us
[37:47] into this scripture here. We're going to
[37:49] go two different places. will be in 1
[37:51] Corinthians the 2 chapter. And uh it's
[37:53] out of this desire actually of
[37:55] parenthood. I was looking at this
[37:57] recently because there's different
[37:58] things that are taught and and stuff.
[38:00] And you know, I got to thinking about
[38:01] what how's a young person look at things
[38:03] and stuff. And when we talk about the
[38:05] message of the hour, what is it to us
[38:06] and why is it important? It's it's not
[38:09] just a different kind of doctrine than
[38:10] the next church down the street. Amen.
[38:12] We It's not that we're trying to be
[38:14] something or be better than that. We
[38:15] just we recognize that God has shown us
[38:18] something that not everybody sees. And
[38:19] so my title for this morning is why the
[38:23] message of the hour. Amen. Brother
[38:25] Brandon preached about why shepherds,
[38:27] why Bethlehem, but why the message of
[38:29] the hour? Why is it important to us? And
[38:30] so let's we'll read here in 1
[38:32] Corinthians the 2 chapter. We'll read
[38:35] these first seven verses. And then I'll
[38:36] have you turn to Revelation the 10th
[38:38] chapter, 7th verse. A very familiar
[38:40] portion of scripture to us believers as
[38:42] well. 1 Corinthians the 2 chapter. In
[38:45] the first verse, Paul, he's come to the
[38:46] Corinthian church. She says, "And I,
[38:48] brethren, when I came to you, came not
[38:51] with excellency of speech or of wisdom,
[38:54] declaring unto you the testimony of God.
[38:56] For I determined not to know anything
[38:58] among you, save Jesus Christ and him
[39:02] crucified." Now, that's a good place to
[39:03] be. Amen. We're not here to preach
[39:05] ourselves or something else. We're
[39:07] preaching Christ and him crucified. But
[39:09] there is something beyond this as we'll
[39:11] see here in a second. And I was with you
[39:13] in weakness and in fear and in much
[39:14] trembling. Brother Bram said he wasn't
[39:16] afraid of the circumstances around him.
[39:18] He was afraid that men would make more
[39:19] of him than he was. Amen. He wanted to
[39:21] please God. That was what he was in
[39:22] trembling for. He said, "My speech and
[39:24] my preaching was not with enticing words
[39:26] of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of
[39:29] the spirit and of power, that your faith
[39:32] should not stand in the wisdom of men,
[39:35] but in the power of God." So, we don't
[39:37] want to base this on the wisdom of men,
[39:39] but on the power of God. But notice six
[39:41] verse. How be we speak wisdom among them
[39:44] that are perfect or mature. Tellios yet
[39:47] not the wisdom of this world, nor of the
[39:50] princes of this world that come to not.
[39:51] Now, James makes the same point. There's
[39:53] two kinds of wisdom. Amen. So, we're not
[39:55] basing this on man's wisdom. There's a
[39:56] different kind of wisdom. It's the
[39:58] wisdom of God. And how does it come to
[40:00] us? Verse 7. But we speak the wisdom of
[40:02] God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom
[40:06] which God ordained before the world unto
[40:10] our glory. Now think about that. That's
[40:12] quite astounding because our glory is
[40:14] the revelation of his glory in us. Amen.
[40:17] So it's not our own personal glory, but
[40:19] all men have sinned and come short of
[40:21] the glory of God. So this is to restore
[40:24] us to the image of sunship. Amen.
[40:26] Because we were made in his likeness. If
[40:28] you turn with me to Revelation the 10th
[40:30] chapter.
[40:32] Amen. So the wisdom God, the hidden
[40:33] wisdom, it's in a mystery. Amen.
[40:36] Revelation 10:7. But in the days of the
[40:38] voice of the seventh angel, when he
[40:40] shall begin to sound, the mystery of God
[40:44] should be finished as he hath declared
[40:47] to his servants the prophets. Amen. So
[40:50] we need a prophet. Amen. That's the only
[40:52] way God speaks. God. Surely the Lord our
[40:54] God will do nothing except he first
[40:56] speaks through his servants, the
[40:58] prophets. Amen. May the Lord bless the
[40:59] read his word. You may be seated this
[41:01] morning. And so, like I said, I want to
[41:04] just take some time and talk about this.
[41:06] Why the message of the hour? Why it's
[41:07] important. Amen. Because we could talk
[41:09] about different things that distinguish
[41:12] us from different groups. groups and if
[41:13] we were just trying to an analyze it
[41:15] from a u you know um like a a
[41:18] statistical thing or whatever there's
[41:20] there's other people that baptize in the
[41:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[41:23] appreciate that but that in of itself is
[41:25] not what we're talking about what what
[41:27] makes the message different and why is
[41:29] it important to us so um what I want to
[41:31] really look at is uh where brother been
[41:34] preached different things out of the
[41:35] seven seals and specifically the seventh
[41:37] seal man I'm getting ready to go deep I
[41:38] hope that's all right put on your diving
[41:40] horn amen but um but I I'll say this,
[41:43] uh, Brother Brandon, when he's preaching
[41:45] the seals himself, he makes the point.
[41:47] He's just hitting the highlights. He
[41:48] said, "We could take three months each
[41:50] to cover each seal." Now, I don't have
[41:53] 21 months up here this morning to work
[41:55] with. Amen. So, I'm just hitting
[41:57] highlights. So, if I don't read your
[41:58] favorite quote, you know, there's 30
[42:00] different quotes for the same thing.
[42:02] I'll just hit a couple. Amen. But, but
[42:04] if you if you want to look at it, if you
[42:05] have a question or whatever, of course,
[42:07] your pastor can answer that and stuff,
[42:08] too. But I I have so many notes. I just
[42:10] want to move on. But I wanted to I want
[42:13] to take time to really read a bunch of
[42:14] quotes and stuff today because the
[42:16] reason I'm doing this and why the
[42:18] message is important to us is there's
[42:19] all kinds of thoughts about what this
[42:22] means and what that means and men will
[42:24] take a certain doctrine. They'll build a
[42:25] church around that and it'll be based on
[42:27] some sort of an error. And what happens
[42:29] at the end of the day is the premise is
[42:31] wrong and they'll go a certain way with
[42:33] it and it falls into error. And so if I
[42:36] just read you what a prophet said and I
[42:38] just tell you what the scripture says,
[42:40] then you can let the spirit in you make
[42:42] the conclusion. I don't have to
[42:43] interpret it for you. God interprets his
[42:46] own word. And I I find that uh and
[42:49] brother Bam talks about this when he
[42:50] preaches the seven seals. He starts out
[42:52] with God hidden in simplicity. Amen. The
[42:55] actual revelation of what God has done
[42:57] and what it means. It's simple, but we
[42:59] have made it complicated. We have
[43:01] interpreted it and it's it's so simple.
[43:04] Amen. And and I'll come back to this
[43:05] later. But brother makes that point.
[43:07] It's so humble. That's why people miss
[43:10] it. They're looking for something out
[43:12] here and it's right there. Amen. So So
[43:14] when I'm reading this, that's why I'm
[43:15] doing this. I I want to take my time and
[43:17] I want you to to know that it's not I'm
[43:19] not trying to present my interpretation.
[43:21] Amen. Because one of the reasons I'm
[43:23] gonna take this off now. It's It's the
[43:26] hottest day of the year. Whoa. I got
[43:27] hung up on this. Thank you so much. Oh
[43:31] wow, man. I can't even preach. That's so
[43:33] cool. I'm just so distracted. There's a
[43:35] hook and it swings out. Man, that is
[43:38] great. Oh, man. That totally derailed me
[43:41] actually. Thanks. No. Uh, I'll say this.
[43:44] Uh, praise the Lord. Amen. Um, and this
[43:48] is a general rule. Uh, when error error
[43:50] comes into the church, mistakes,
[43:52] misinterpretations, error comes in the
[43:53] church, it it typically ends because we
[43:56] know that God's not the author of
[43:58] confusion. Amen. So when error comes
[44:00] into the church, typically the end
[44:01] result, error tends to controlling
[44:04] people. Amen. It's Satan through men
[44:07] wanting to control people. That's why
[44:08] God's against denomination. That's why
[44:10] he's against all this stuff. God's not
[44:12] trying to centralize power on a certain
[44:14] man. He has it. And so he's trying to
[44:16] put it in a body, not a s. It's not my
[44:18] ministry or or you. It's God trying to
[44:21] move in his people. Amen. So error tends
[44:24] to uh it ends up being a control thing
[44:26] over the people. So, I'll give you an
[44:28] example with this. Amen. So, we're
[44:29] talking about the seventh seal. There
[44:31] are people that have taught there's
[44:32] churches today even that teach that that
[44:34] that Brother Ben preaches the opening of
[44:36] the seals. The seals are open. Amen.
[44:38] Well, if the seals are open, Christ, we
[44:40] understand by the message and the
[44:42] scripture. Christ has to come off the
[44:44] mercy seat to take the book and to open
[44:46] the seals. So, they'll take this thought
[44:48] and that's now that is true. Amen. But
[44:50] they misinterpret the the timing of it,
[44:53] if I can say that way. So there's people
[44:55] that'll preach because he's come off the
[44:57] mercy seat and the seals are open.
[44:59] Therefore, there's no more blood on the
[45:01] mercy seat. And so now it's a judgment
[45:03] seat. Well, then the question becomes,
[45:05] if it's not a mercy seat and it's a
[45:07] judgment seat, how then can we be saved?
[45:09] It's the same question they asked on the
[45:10] day of Pentecost. But the way they got
[45:12] saved, there's not the same today. Amen.
[45:15] Because there's no mercy there and and
[45:16] this now salvation is different. So you
[45:19] ask the question, how can you be saved?
[45:21] Typically, the answer becomes something
[45:23] like, "Well, it's by a certain
[45:24] revelation hour or a certain doctrine
[45:26] and conveniently the man preaching it
[45:29] happens to have it." Amen. Conveniently,
[45:31] he's got the answer you need. So, if
[45:33] you'll go to him, if you'll sit under
[45:35] his ministry and you'll go to his church
[45:37] with his special interpretation of what
[45:39] brother preached. Amen. Then you can be
[45:41] saved. Amen. Of course, his own
[45:43] revelation of it might change from time
[45:44] to time. So, you got to keep up. You got
[45:47] to keep up. So then the question, well,
[45:49] was he even saved before he got the
[45:50] furthest and he creates and now we
[45:53] laugh, but it's true. There's people
[45:55] that live in fear. They never know where
[45:57] they're at because they're they're
[45:59] they're bound by it. It becomes a
[46:00] control thing. Amen. You have to come to
[46:03] this man. But there's only one mediator
[46:05] between God and men. It's Amen. It's the
[46:08] man Christ Jesus. It's not a pope or
[46:10] potent. Brother Bren didn't come to be
[46:12] our mediator. He came to reveal the
[46:13] mediator so you knew where he was at. So
[46:16] there is mercy. And I'll come back to
[46:18] this in a minute. Amen. Because like I
[46:19] said, there's so much to unpack here.
[46:21] But that that becomes the control
[46:23] aspect. Well, if you don't believe what
[46:24] this guy says, which could change at any
[46:26] time without warning, then how can you
[46:28] be saved? Now, we understand that the
[46:31] scripture testifies we could go through
[46:34] things about the blood of Jesus Christ
[46:35] and how without the remission, without
[46:37] the shedding of blood, there is no
[46:38] remission of sin. And besides that, all
[46:40] the things that brother said after he
[46:42] preached the seals about the blood of
[46:44] Jesus Christ, we could go on and on
[46:46] about it. Amen. There's not a third
[46:47] covenant or some alternative mean you're
[46:50] saved. Listen, you're not just saved by
[46:51] the blood of Jesus Christ. You're kept
[46:53] saved by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[46:55] Amen. That's the power of it. That
[46:57] that's your security. You're kept saved
[46:58] by it. Revelation, a man's ideas can
[47:01] change. But the blood of Jesus remains
[47:04] the same. And the church is the blood of
[47:07] Jesus Christ by the spirit. That's why
[47:09] the spirit leads and guides you into all
[47:12] truth. Amen.
[47:14] So the whole thing is based actually on
[47:15] a false premise that I'll come back to
[47:16] in just a few moments. Amen. But where
[47:18] this confusion comes is is is the way
[47:21] they try to interpret salvation. Amen.
[47:23] Now there's people that preach the
[47:25] opposite. I've dealt with this before,
[47:26] too. There's people, well, it's all
[47:27] sealed up or it's partly sealed or
[47:29] there's something to be revealed. Well,
[47:31] then by necessity, there must be
[47:32] somebody to reveal it. Amen. And since
[47:34] Brother Brham's gone, he's either got to
[47:36] come back and preach it or I happen to
[47:39] have it's gonna come and it becomes that
[47:40] I'm the guy. God's going to use me to
[47:43] preach this. And it's what happens then?
[47:46] It's the exact same thing. Now, you need
[47:48] this guy who's got this carrot on the
[47:51] stick. Amen. And and he's going to
[47:53] preach this to you and and he's going to
[47:55] he's going to preach and if you get
[47:56] under his revelation of it. Amen. I had
[47:59] a brother send me something here a while
[48:00] back about a certain brother he was
[48:01] preaching. I'm not going to get into
[48:02] this because I don't like to, you know,
[48:04] gossip, but I'll just This brother was
[48:06] ministering and he was talking about
[48:07] where brother preaches the rapture.
[48:08] Brother Bam preaches the rapture in 1965
[48:11] and there's a quote paragraph 141 if you
[48:13] go back there brother Bam says he's
[48:15] talking about the when God descends 1
[48:17] Thessalonians the 4th chapter there's a
[48:19] shout a voice of the trump what is the
[48:21] shout and in paragraph 141 brother said
[48:24] it's a message to gather the people
[48:26] together now this brother he makes this
[48:28] point he said see brother said it's a
[48:30] message not the message it could be any
[48:33] other message there's another message to
[48:34] come and I'm thinking it's amazing how
[48:37] you just didn't listen or read the whole
[48:39] rest of the sermon. Amen. You had an
[48:41] idea in your head and you looked for God
[48:43] to vindicate that you didn't sit down
[48:45] and listen to it or take the whole thing
[48:46] in. Because if you go back to uh
[48:49] paragraph uh 130 or 164, brother Ram
[48:52] says, "What is the shout?" It's the
[48:54] message. And in case you wonder what the
[48:56] message was, he tells you it's according
[48:58] to Malachi the 4th chapter. Well,
[49:01] there's only one Malachi the 4th chapter
[49:03] prophet that I know of. He didn't say,
[49:04] "I'm going to send you two Elijah's or
[49:06] three Elijah's or Moses and Elijah."
[49:08] That's to the Jews. I'm going to send
[49:09] you Elijah. So if Malachi 4, Luke 17:30,
[49:12] brother said it's fulfilled, that
[49:14] message, that shout, it's fulfilled in
[49:16] that. If that's the case, then then we
[49:18] don't need some other man to come do it.
[49:21] That was the purpose of the messenger.
[49:23] Brother said the message is on the earth
[49:25] at this time. So that shout has come to
[49:27] us. So it's not another message. It's
[49:30] this message. That's why it's important
[49:32] to us. Amen. Now, why do where's the
[49:36] confusion come in? Well, this is where
[49:37] the confusion comes in. I had a man
[49:38] years ago come to me about this. He was
[49:40] telling me how the seals weren't opened.
[49:41] He goes to Feast of the Trumpets 1964
[49:44] and he says, "Brother Bam said those
[49:45] seals aren't opened yet." And I said, "I
[49:46] believe that quote. That was true in
[49:48] 1945."
[49:50] He's like, "What are you talking about?
[49:51] Preach it in ' 64." If you read what
[49:53] Brother's talking about, he's talking
[49:54] about when the the 2,000,000 demons come
[49:57] out of Euphrates, the Second World War,
[49:59] the persecution of the Jews, the souls
[50:01] under the altar. says what he's talking
[50:03] about. He says now that hasn't that
[50:04] hasn't happened yet. So in the time that
[50:07] he's talking about in the quote, it
[50:08] hadn't happened yet. That was for 18
[50:10] years later, which is where he was at 19
[50:13] years later preaching it. Amen. So
[50:14] brother Bam, but he makes this point. He
[50:16] said, "Now the seals aren't open yet."
[50:18] He said, "But John saw it in a preview."
[50:22] So I want you to understand the point
[50:23] that he's making. Amen. John saw
[50:26] everything that we've seen in the spirit
[50:29] on the Lord's day. Amen. The Bible says
[50:31] he was in the spirit on the Lord's day.
[50:33] So even though he's on the aisle of
[50:34] Patmos in a preview, he sees everything
[50:37] that we see in this hour. Amen. So I can
[50:40] say it this way. He travels through time
[50:42] by the spirit to the Lord's day and sees
[50:44] these things. Amen. So brother Bam, I'll
[50:46] give you some quotes here. Brother Bam
[50:47] says this in the first seal. He said
[50:50] that see he said it isn't God as we
[50:51] would think just going to go hunt out a
[50:53] few thousand people this age and take
[50:54] them. It's the very elected out of every
[50:57] age. That's the reason Christ had to
[50:59] stand in the mediatorial seat back there
[51:01] as an intercessor until the last one
[51:04] comes in at the last age. So that we're
[51:06] still there and these revelations then
[51:09] of what it has been breaks forth upon
[51:12] the people and they see what's happened.
[51:15] So one of the reasons for the opening
[51:16] the seals was to show what each of the
[51:18] churches what all that stuff was about.
[51:20] Amen. He sent his angel the scripture
[51:22] says to testify of these things to the
[51:25] church. Amen. Now, he already sent his
[51:27] spirit back on the day of Pentecost. But
[51:29] there's a part of him, the scripture
[51:30] says that the heavens must retain him
[51:32] until the restoration of all things.
[51:34] Now, that's the physical attribute.
[51:35] Amen. There is a man in Christ Jesus. He
[51:38] he does have a body. He sits in
[51:40] mediation. He's mediating. Now, he
[51:41] mediates till the last soul comes in. He
[51:44] doesn't mediate till the last soul comes
[51:45] in of part one and then do something
[51:48] different. Amen. That that was the
[51:49] promise. Amen. If there was an apostolic
[51:51] age, that was the Holy Ghost back on the
[51:53] day of Pentecost. But if he's still
[51:55] calling, it's still the same today. It's
[51:57] the same promise, the same baptism, the
[52:00] same faith, the same Lord, the same
[52:02] gospel.
[52:04] Amen. So, Brother Bam explains this in
[52:06] the fifth seal. He says, "These seals
[52:08] here are revealing." Now, there's three
[52:10] things. Watch this. These seals here are
[52:12] revealing what has been, what is, and
[52:15] what will be. Amen. So, see, it's
[52:18] there's there's different time elements
[52:19] to the different things. He says, "What
[52:21] it is to be for the churches was
[52:22] revealed by these seals." And now watch
[52:25] what it takes. Amen. I'll give you
[52:27] another example here. He talks about the
[52:28] revelations containing the seals. When
[52:30] he gets to the fourth seal, the pale
[52:31] horse rider says, "Watch." Rides a pale
[52:34] horse as he appears on his ride. This
[52:35] last ride he's on his last now. He says,
[52:38] "Now that is not our day.
[52:41] This will be undone. It's the seal
[52:43] foretold. See the church is dawn done
[52:46] gone up when this happens." So when he's
[52:47] preaching about the pale horse because
[52:49] I've heard people like this has already
[52:50] taken place and this and that. Brother
[52:52] Ram explains in the fourth seal, this is
[52:54] after the rapture of the church. Amen.
[52:57] When these powers combine, it becomes a
[52:59] one world church. 10 kings give their
[53:01] power into the the false prophet and the
[53:02] be that's all things to come. Amen.
[53:05] We're gone for that. He explains that
[53:06] there. So you're this is my point.
[53:08] You're seeing things in the fourth seal
[53:10] that have yet to take place. Things that
[53:14] were the church ages, things that are
[53:16] now where we're at the end of it, and
[53:17] things that are to be. All three of
[53:19] those are contained in the seals. Amen.
[53:21] So, I I'm saying this because again, I
[53:23] don't want you to think I'm trying to
[53:24] interpret it. Amen. But I'm giving you
[53:27] the prophet's own words. Now, let me let
[53:28] me just say this real quick. God hides
[53:31] certain things and reveals it later. We
[53:32] know that. Amen. Brother Ram says this
[53:34] in the first seal. He said, "Remember, a
[53:37] loud clapping noise of a thunder is the
[53:39] voice of God." So, what's the thunders?
[53:42] Well, it's this thing that he tells you
[53:44] what it is. It's the voice of God. Amen.
[53:46] That's what they dealt with in John
[53:48] chapter 12. Some people heard an angel.
[53:50] Some people heard thunder, but Jesus
[53:51] said, "The voice came and it didn't come
[53:53] for my sake. It came for your sake." So
[53:56] the message, the seals, all this stuff,
[53:58] it came for us. It's for you. It's not
[54:00] against you. People think the message is
[54:02] against him. Well, the message is for
[54:04] me. It's for you if you'll receive it.
[54:06] Amen. It's not meant to destroy you.
[54:08] It's not meant to confuse you. It's
[54:09] meant to to help you. Amen. Now, he says
[54:12] this. He said, "They thought it was a
[54:15] thunder, but it was the it was God. He
[54:17] understood it for it was revealed to
[54:18] him. See, it was a thunder. Now notice
[54:21] the first seal opened. The first seal
[54:23] when it opened in the symbol form, it
[54:25] thundered. Now what about its opening in
[54:28] its reality form? So this is it. Amen.
[54:30] There's actually two openings. Now that
[54:32] sounds confusing, but I just read it.
[54:34] There's an opening in the symbol form
[54:35] and there's an opening in reality. So if
[54:37] I could say it this way, there's a
[54:39] there's an opening of it by revelation,
[54:41] the revelation of what's in it, and then
[54:43] there's the actual occurring of the
[54:44] things in it taking place. Amen. And
[54:47] because there's two, there's a prophetic
[54:49] opening, a foresight of it. And because
[54:51] there's actually things to be, that's
[54:52] where people get confused. They've put
[54:54] it all either over here that it all
[54:56] needs to happen still or they put it all
[54:58] over there that they're they're they're
[55:00] waiting uh that it's already happened
[55:01] and they've got whatever what I talked
[55:03] about earlier. Amen. So, the confusion
[55:05] is the inability to distinguish what
[55:06] he's talking about here. John sees it,
[55:09] but it didn't happen when he saw it. In
[55:11] fact, he was told to seal it up. So, the
[55:13] thing that was sealed up is now revealed
[55:15] to us. Testament is open in its symbol
[55:17] form. It thunders. God speaks and tells
[55:19] you what it's about. So he says this, it
[55:21] thundered as soon as as the lamb struck
[55:24] back the seal. And what did it reveal?
[55:26] Not all of itself. He says first it was
[55:29] with God. Next it's in a symbol and then
[55:31] it's revealed three things. It's coming
[55:33] forth from the throne. First it can't be
[55:36] seen, heard, or nothing. It's sealed up.
[55:38] The lamb's blood paid the price. It
[55:40] thundered when he spoke out. And when he
[55:43] did, a white horse rider started out. He
[55:46] says, "And it was still a symbol." So
[55:47] they see the symbol, but they don't know
[55:48] what it's about. Amen. He says, "Now
[55:52] watch." He said, "It would be known in
[55:54] the last day." Praise the Lord. But it
[55:56] comes forth in a church symbol. Do you
[55:59] understand it, church? It comes forth in
[56:00] the symbol of a church. They know there
[56:02] what is a seal, but what it was yet,
[56:05] they didn't know because it was a white
[56:07] horse rider. And it's only to be
[56:09] revealed at the last day when this
[56:11] actual seal is broken. Now, watch what
[56:13] he says. Broken to who? Not to Christ,
[56:16] but to the church. Amen. So, it's not
[56:19] the same as him coming and taking the
[56:21] book of redemption and opening it up at
[56:23] the end of the church age. Amen. There's
[56:25] an opening of it to the church by
[56:27] revelation first. Amen. When the symbols
[56:30] interpreted. Now, this begs a really
[56:31] good question. Why does God send it as a
[56:33] symbol form and then later reveal the
[56:36] meaning of it? Amen. Now, we could sit
[56:38] here and delve into this for a while,
[56:40] but the there's one big reason, and I'm
[56:42] this going to kind of be part of the
[56:43] theme of this whole sermon. One of the
[56:45] big reasons God does it that way is to
[56:47] prevent impersonations.
[56:49] Amen. If the Bible tells us in the fifth
[56:51] church in Revelation the 3rd chapter
[56:54] that unto the angel of the church of
[56:55] Sardis, if it said unto Martin Luther,
[56:58] Amen. Then probably every child, every
[57:00] male child that was born in the 1500s or
[57:03] 1400s, they would have named him Martin
[57:05] Luther because everybody that wants
[57:06] their child to be the one. Amen. If if
[57:08] if g if if if Isaiah had said a virgin
[57:11] shall conceive, by the way, her name's
[57:13] Mary, she's going to conceive and bring
[57:14] forth a child. Probably every girl in
[57:16] Palestine in Israel in that day would
[57:18] have been named Mary. They all would
[57:19] have stayed unmarried because they all
[57:20] wanted to be virgins so they could all
[57:22] have the Messiah. Amen. It produces
[57:24] impersonations. Well, I'm going to be
[57:26] that one. I'm going to be Mary. I'm
[57:28] going to be this one. So God in order to
[57:30] prevent impersonations, he declares what
[57:33] it is, but he doesn't show the details
[57:35] till later to prevent man from trying to
[57:37] interpret it because man's always trying
[57:39] to interpret it himself. And that's
[57:41] where we always get that's for each of
[57:43] us today when we take this Bible and try
[57:45] and interpret it the way we want it to
[57:48] be and make it say what we want. Amen.
[57:50] That's where we always get in trouble.
[57:52] Don't try to make the go the word of God
[57:54] fit your interpretation. allow it to
[57:57] change your uh your mind and your will
[57:59] and your interpretation. You align with
[58:01] it. Don't try to make it align with you.
[58:03] Amen. Cuz this is what men always try to
[58:05] do. And they do it because they want to
[58:07] be something. They want to get
[58:08] something. I'm that guy. It's the same
[58:10] thing we talked about at the beginning.
[58:12] So God is not wanting impersonations.
[58:15] So he he brings the interpretation of
[58:18] things that come to pass afterwards and
[58:21] makes it known to the church. So now you
[58:22] know it was foretold but yet it was
[58:24] hidden from a certain group the wise and
[58:27] the prudent.
[58:28] But he does reveal it to certain people.
[58:31] The hidden wisdom to the mature to his
[58:33] own people. Amen. Now before I get into
[58:36] this I'm going to tell myself for just a
[58:38] minute because I was once a young man
[58:39] and now I'm not as young a man.
[58:44] Amen. But uh talking about
[58:46] interpretations and things being hidden.
[58:48] I remember my when my wife and I got
[58:50] married, our anniversary is coming up.
[58:51] I'm glad I brought this up so I don't
[58:52] forget cuz uh you know I well through
[58:55] much tribulation we enter the kingdom.
[58:57] Amen. I don't need to put myself through
[58:59] any more trouble than I'm already in.
[59:01] No, my wife's a sweetheart. But uh she
[59:03] she would actually already got her
[59:05] anniversary gifts. Yeah. If I do it
[59:06] ahead of time, I don't have to worry
[59:08] about it.
[59:11] But I remember when I first got married
[59:12] and I had just been saved actually I'd
[59:14] only been saved a little under a year. I
[59:15] hadn't been saved very long. And so I
[59:17] hadn't been a Christian really that
[59:18] long. I remember I gave my life to the
[59:19] Lord. I remember when I got the Holy
[59:21] Ghost and I remember I was digging.
[59:23] Amen. And hopefully hopefully somebody
[59:24] in here can identify with my experience
[59:26] a little bit. When I was a young
[59:27] Christian, I first got my my candle lit,
[59:29] man, I was digging. I I I couldn't read
[59:32] enough. I couldn't pray enough. I'm just
[59:33] into everything I can get a hold of.
[59:34] Amen. I I read through the Bible in
[59:36] about three months and I've been
[59:37] praying. I went through the tapes. I
[59:39] started out kind of bouncing around a
[59:40] little bit because I didn't know no
[59:41] better. And so, uh, I I you know, I read
[59:44] the church a book. I went through all
[59:45] this stuff. And I remember it was a hot
[59:47] summer day about like this that I got
[59:49] the seven the the the seven seals book
[59:51] and I'm like I'm going to get into this
[59:52] finally. I'm going to apparently
[59:54] nobody's read this because they're not
[59:55] all doing what I think they should be
[59:56] doing. Amen. Cuz I'm going to read these
[59:58] seals and I'm thinking to myself when I
[59:59] get this revelation I'm going to call
[1:00:01] fire out of heaven and shoot lightning
[1:00:04] bolts out of my finger and I'm going to
[1:00:05] be raising the dead and do you know I
[1:00:06] mean this is the greatest thing. And so
[1:00:08] I remember I listened to God hidden
[1:00:10] simplicity the breach. I listen to the
[1:00:12] first six seals, listen to questions and
[1:00:13] answers and and just the revelations.
[1:00:15] God uh brother takes most of the
[1:00:17] message, the revelations and just opens
[1:00:19] it in these seals and it's amazing. If
[1:00:20] you haven't listened to it in a while,
[1:00:21] go back. But I get to the seventh seal
[1:00:24] and you know nowadays we got your
[1:00:25] tablets. It'll it'll play the text as
[1:00:27] you read, which is really convenient.
[1:00:28] But back in my day, back in my day,
[1:00:31] Amen. I had to listen to it on a little
[1:00:32] iPod or CD player and I get the book out
[1:00:35] and read with it and I thought, man,
[1:00:36] that's double the revelation, twice the
[1:00:38] anointing. Amen. I'm reading through the
[1:00:40] book and I'm listening to it. I get to
[1:00:41] the seventh seal. Amen. And so I'm amped
[1:00:44] up. I'm ready to just just be raised up
[1:00:47] in this supernatural anointing. I'm
[1:00:49] going to do this and all these other
[1:00:50] things. So I get there and I I'd heard
[1:00:53] people talk about the seals, but I'm
[1:00:54] wanting to dig it into myself. I get to
[1:00:55] the seventh seal and I'm pumped. Now I
[1:00:58] don't know and I'm not going to ask for
[1:00:59] a show of hands what it was like for you
[1:01:01] the first time you listened to it.
[1:01:03] Hopefully you've listened to it or read
[1:01:04] it. Amen. But I remember the first time
[1:01:06] I listened to it. I sit down there and
[1:01:08] uh if you if you know the history of it,
[1:01:11] brother Benry, he records the seventh
[1:01:13] seal on March the 24th, 1963. It's a
[1:01:16] Sunday. He gets done with it and as
[1:01:18] you'll see why later, he comes back the
[1:01:20] next day, Monday, and he gets uh Fred
[1:01:23] South, I can't remember who the other
[1:01:24] tape guy was at the time. He had
[1:01:25] different tape guys, but he gets
[1:01:27] together the next day. They go to the
[1:01:28] motel and he cuts it at a certain place.
[1:01:31] Now, I would say this way, he seals it
[1:01:33] back up because it wasn't the time for
[1:01:35] it yet. Amen. He wasn't supposed to
[1:01:36] speak about it. Amen. So he he
[1:01:39] re-records a different ending. And then
[1:01:41] after brother Bam passes away at the end
[1:01:43] of 1965, then the the tape commission,
[1:01:46] they they vote unanimously to reveal it.
[1:01:48] So you've got two different endings to
[1:01:50] the seventh seal. Amen. The original
[1:01:51] recorded version where he speaks and
[1:01:53] then he records a different version the
[1:01:55] next day. So this is why I'm saying all
[1:01:57] this, brother Bam. In the seventh seal,
[1:01:58] he does like he does the other seals. He
[1:02:00] touches on some other subjects at first.
[1:02:02] He talks about the previous seals. He
[1:02:04] talks about denomination, the redemption
[1:02:06] of the Jews, all these different things
[1:02:07] that we're familiar with. He talks about
[1:02:08] the half hour of silence. And brother
[1:02:10] Bam says this in the seventh seal. He
[1:02:13] said, "Now, as certain as I stand in the
[1:02:15] platform tonight, I had the revelation
[1:02:17] that's revealed." He says, "It's in a
[1:02:19] three-fold manner." Now, we'll come back
[1:02:20] to that again a little bit. It's in a
[1:02:22] three-fold manner that I will speak to
[1:02:24] you by God's help of a fold of it. He
[1:02:26] said, let's go over that here. Here is
[1:02:28] the revelation to begin what I want to
[1:02:30] tell you. What happens is that he says
[1:02:32] those seven thunders that he heard
[1:02:34] thunder and was forbidden to write,
[1:02:36] that's what the mystery is laying behind
[1:02:39] those seven consecutive thunders rolling
[1:02:41] out. Now why? That's the question today.
[1:02:44] Why? Let us prove it. Why? It's a secret
[1:02:48] that nobody knows about. John was
[1:02:50] forbidden to write about it even in a
[1:02:52] symbol about it. Why? Why was there no
[1:02:55] activity in heaven? It might give away
[1:02:59] the secret. So, the reason God kept it
[1:03:02] shut up till the end is there's a secret
[1:03:03] that goes with the mystery. Amen. Again,
[1:03:06] he says in the seven, it was a relaxing
[1:03:08] time. Praise God for a relaxing time.
[1:03:10] Amen. I've been wound up before. I like
[1:03:11] relaxing better than being wound up.
[1:03:13] Amen. If you're wound up today, listen,
[1:03:15] this is a relaxing time. Amen. This is a
[1:03:18] time where we can rest because of what
[1:03:19] he's done. We're like Ruth. We're
[1:03:21] resting on what he's done. Amen. He said
[1:03:23] it was a relaxing time. It was so great.
[1:03:25] It was kept secret from the angels. Now
[1:03:28] why why is he keep it a secret? If Satan
[1:03:31] should get a hold of it, he might do
[1:03:34] great damage. Talking about
[1:03:36] impersonations. There is one thing he
[1:03:38] don't know. Now brother Ram comes down
[1:03:40] to paragraph 260. And this is about this
[1:03:42] is the last paragraph till eclipse.
[1:03:44] Amen. I'm saying this to give you an
[1:03:46] idea where I'm at with this. Brother Bam
[1:03:48] says in paragraph 260, but this is one
[1:03:49] thing he cannot Satan he cannot
[1:03:52] impersonate. There'll be no mimics to
[1:03:54] this. See, cuz he don't know it. There's
[1:03:56] no way for him to know it. It's the
[1:03:59] third pull.
[1:04:02] Now, I'll come to this a minute, but
[1:04:03] it's amazing me he didn't clip this off
[1:04:05] at this point. Amen. He said it's the
[1:04:08] third pull. He just knows nothing about.
[1:04:10] See, he don't understand it. Now, like I
[1:04:12] said, I'm fascinated by this. Amen.
[1:04:14] Because brother cuts the tape there. And
[1:04:16] this is the reason why. Amen. He's gone
[1:04:18] through all these different things I
[1:04:20] talked about. Amen. He's been quite
[1:04:21] deliberate in what he's saying here. And
[1:04:24] he talks about Junior Jackson's dream,
[1:04:26] the constellation angel, all these
[1:04:27] things. I don't want to get into it too
[1:04:28] much tonight uh this morning just
[1:04:29] because it would take forever. Amen. But
[1:04:32] he goes into all these different things
[1:04:33] and he does it on both recordings. Amen.
[1:04:35] There's a lot of things he goes into on
[1:04:36] both recordings. But there's one thing
[1:04:38] in the original that he speaks about at
[1:04:41] great length and he completely omits it.
[1:04:43] Amen. He omits it when he re-records it
[1:04:45] and it's not revealed till later. And
[1:04:47] it's this very thing here. You go back
[1:04:48] and listen to the original. The big
[1:04:50] thing that brother Bam talks about over
[1:04:51] and over and over again that's not
[1:04:53] recorded in the new recording. Amen. Is
[1:04:55] he talks about the third pole of his
[1:04:58] ministry. Amen. He doesn't want Satan
[1:05:00] impersonating it but Satan can't
[1:05:01] impersonate. Amen. Paragraph 261.
[1:05:04] Brother Ram says there's a secret lays
[1:05:06] beneath that. Glory to God in the
[1:05:09] highest. I can never think the same the
[1:05:12] rest of my life when I seen it. This is
[1:05:15] why the Bible's a new book. It's not new
[1:05:16] words. Amen. It's not somebody rewrote
[1:05:19] it. When you see what it's talking
[1:05:21] about, you see it in every That's why
[1:05:23] you see Christ in every scripture.
[1:05:25] There's something he saw that changed
[1:05:28] the way he looked at everything for the
[1:05:29] rest of his life. And this is why it's
[1:05:30] amazing to me. Amen. Cuz brother is
[1:05:32] explaining this. You get to this part,
[1:05:34] there's a secret beneath it. Amen. I'm
[1:05:36] stoked. I'm like, this is it. This is,
[1:05:38] you know, it's like, it's like a pyramid
[1:05:40] plan or something. I'm like, this is the
[1:05:41] juicy little thing. It's going to change
[1:05:42] everything. I'm going to So, like
[1:05:44] there's a secret beneath it. And brother
[1:05:46] Brennham, when you listen to the
[1:05:47] original recording, he starts talking
[1:05:48] about himself.
[1:05:52] Well, this is the third pull. He said,
[1:05:53] "I was in Sabino Canyon the other day.
[1:05:55] This that he talked about the third
[1:05:56] pull, the third pull, the third pull of
[1:05:57] his ministry, and I get done." And I
[1:06:00] thought, "Well, maybe that's why he
[1:06:00] recorded a new version. He didn't
[1:06:01] actually get to it. He needed to put it
[1:06:03] in there." So, I go listen to the other
[1:06:04] version. It's got less details than
[1:06:06] that.
[1:06:08] So, this is why I'm saying I'm a young
[1:06:10] man. I'm looking for a certain thing.
[1:06:13] I'm looking to feel something, see
[1:06:14] something. I'm going to get charged up.
[1:06:17] I'm going to be, you know, leaping over
[1:06:18] walls and stuff. And I'll be honest.
[1:06:21] Amen. I got done. I listen. He's talking
[1:06:23] about the third pull. Amen. And I was
[1:06:26] disappointed. I'm like, well, where's
[1:06:27] the secret? So, I go back and listen to
[1:06:30] it again. I It was hot like this. I'm
[1:06:31] out mowing listening to it. I'm like,
[1:06:33] where's the secret? All he's doing is
[1:06:35] talking about himself. All he's doing is
[1:06:38] talking about his own ministry.
[1:06:40] That was the secret.
[1:06:43] It was right there and I didn't even
[1:06:44] realize it. Amen. The third pull of his
[1:06:47] mystery. That is the secret because it's
[1:06:50] Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:06:53] Praise the Lord. This is why brother B
[1:06:56] says, "I'm going to lose 10,000 of my
[1:06:58] friends when I preach this." He knew
[1:06:59] people would look at it and be like,
[1:07:00] "Well, he's making something of
[1:07:01] himself." No, he wasn't. Amen. It was
[1:07:03] the That was the revelation under it.
[1:07:05] Somebody had to fulfill Malachi 4.
[1:07:08] Somebody had to fulfill Luke 17:30. and
[1:07:11] they would be mad it wasn't them.
[1:07:17] But brother, and this is why when
[1:07:18] brother preaches the original seventh
[1:07:20] seal at the end, he makes this point
[1:07:21] over and over again. He said, "Well, the
[1:07:24] people cast it." They say, "Well, he's
[1:07:25] just trying to make himself this or
[1:07:26] that." But he says, "But God does it."
[1:07:28] That's why he goes on and says, "There's
[1:07:29] no great men among us. There's no great
[1:07:31] Christians. We're all in the same
[1:07:32] bracket." Why is brother Bram saying
[1:07:34] that? He's letting you know, listen, I'm
[1:07:36] no better than you. I was just the
[1:07:37] voice. I was the one. We're all in the
[1:07:40] same bracket. Don't look at this and
[1:07:42] think I'm trying to be something. Don't
[1:07:44] think if I do what he does, I can be
[1:07:46] something. We're all in the same
[1:07:48] bracket. It's the same God. We all
[1:07:50] needed a savior. We all were born in
[1:07:51] sin. It's not about one of us being
[1:07:54] better. One of us just happened to see
[1:07:55] it first cuz that's how God ordained it.
[1:08:00] So yeah, he talks in both. He talks
[1:08:01] about the constellation going out west,
[1:08:03] all this stuff. But the third pull is
[1:08:05] the thing he preaches originally. Amen.
[1:08:07] the third pole of his ministry as you as
[1:08:09] you'll catch here hopefully in a second
[1:08:10] if you haven't already. That is the
[1:08:12] secret that lay in that seventh seal.
[1:08:14] Amen. Now, there's other parts to it as
[1:08:16] I'll get to in a minute, but he says
[1:08:17] this in the seventh seal. He's talking
[1:08:19] about being in Sabino Canyon. He says,
[1:08:21] "I don't know if I was in a vision or a
[1:08:22] trance, but the sword falls in his
[1:08:24] hand." He describes how it looks and he
[1:08:25] hears a voice say, "That's the sword of
[1:08:27] the king." Brother Bam says, "The sword
[1:08:28] of the king." Now, if it said a sword,
[1:08:31] it's kind of funny. It's not a message.
[1:08:33] It's the message. If it said a sword of
[1:08:36] the king, but it said the sword of the
[1:08:38] king, the message. He said there's only
[1:08:40] one the king and that's God. And he is
[1:08:43] the one sword that's he's he has one
[1:08:46] sword. That's his word. What I've lived
[1:08:48] by.
[1:08:50] So help me. God standing over his holy
[1:08:53] over his holy desk here with this holy
[1:08:55] word lanyard. It's the word. Amen. What
[1:08:58] a day we're living in. What a great
[1:09:01] thing. He says, "See the mystery and
[1:09:04] secret." The third,
[1:09:07] he said, standing there when this left
[1:09:09] me, something just spoke and said,
[1:09:10] "Don't fear." Now, I didn't hear no
[1:09:12] voice. It was like on the inside he
[1:09:14] spoke. I just have to tell you the
[1:09:15] truth. Just exactly what happened.
[1:09:17] Something hit and said, "Don't fear."
[1:09:19] This is that third pull.
[1:09:23] Third pull. You remember he said,
[1:09:24] "You've had so many impersonation
[1:09:27] impersonators on that what you've tried
[1:09:29] to explain, but don't even try." In
[1:09:32] other words, don't try to explain this.
[1:09:33] Well, he did. That's why he had to go
[1:09:34] re-record it the next day. Amen. Because
[1:09:36] people were going to try and impersonate
[1:09:37] it. Amen. He said, "You remember, how
[1:09:39] many remembers that vision?" He talks
[1:09:41] about the vision of him trying to fish
[1:09:42] with the sholet. How many's familiar
[1:09:44] with that? Amen. He's trying to fish.
[1:09:45] This where God shows him the three poles
[1:09:47] of ministry. Where does brother Brandon
[1:09:49] get in trouble trying to explain it?
[1:09:51] Amen. When he had a sensation in the
[1:09:53] hand, all the other preachers, oh, I got
[1:09:55] something in my hand. He began to have
[1:09:57] discernment. They all had discernment.
[1:09:58] Amen. Everybody's always trying to be
[1:10:00] like somebody else. Well, that's just
[1:10:02] human pro. That's humanity in general.
[1:10:04] Amen. We're all trying to be like
[1:10:06] somebody else because we think the value
[1:10:08] is in being like that person. Listen,
[1:10:10] the value of this message is not trying
[1:10:12] to be like William Brandom. Amen. If you
[1:10:14] receive a prophet in the name of a
[1:10:15] prophet, you get his reward.
[1:10:18] It's the word. That's the important
[1:10:20] thing. Yeah, we don't have to all have
[1:10:23] the same discernment. You're not going
[1:10:24] to, brother said, it's once in a
[1:10:26] generation. Amen. You don't need to do
[1:10:28] that to be special. You're a son or
[1:10:31] daughter of God. That's already special.
[1:10:33] Amen. You're one in a million. Amen.
[1:10:36] Amen. You're not here for the prophet.
[1:10:37] The prophet came for you. You're the
[1:10:39] reason. Amen. You should be encouraged.
[1:10:41] Listen. Well, praise the Lord. I get in
[1:10:43] trouble myself. I talked about this last
[1:10:44] week somewhere. I'm glad I don't have
[1:10:46] William Brandon's ministry. Look what it
[1:10:47] cost him.
[1:10:49] Listen, I'm from the north. If you're
[1:10:50] from the north, you get it. Amen. Uh
[1:10:52] it's it's one thing when people just
[1:10:53] stop by unannounced. Imagine total
[1:10:55] strangers lying upside outside your
[1:10:57] house at 6:00 in the morning trying to
[1:10:58] get in there and they've got a word from
[1:10:59] the Lord. Let me be your manager or
[1:11:02] you're going to die. I got to eat. I got
[1:11:03] and there's just total strangers walking
[1:11:05] through your house. That's why sister me
[1:11:07] got so upset when she got mad at brother
[1:11:09] Brandon. People have been going in and
[1:11:10] out of the house. Total strangers all
[1:11:12] day long. Imagine living under that kind
[1:11:15] of pressure.
[1:11:17] Or you could just receive his message
[1:11:19] and get the same reward.
[1:11:22] So, I don't know. It sounds like a
[1:11:23] pretty good deal to me. I'll just
[1:11:24] believe it. Amen. Listen, brother Ram
[1:11:27] would go to meetings and there'd be
[1:11:29] people there shaking his hand. God bless
[1:11:31] you. We love you, brother. And he knows.
[1:11:33] He absolutely knows by discernment that
[1:11:35] guy hates his guts. And he's got to love
[1:11:38] him anyway. Listen, it's hard enough to
[1:11:39] love people when you don't know what
[1:11:40] they're thinking about you.
[1:11:43] Amen. There's Brother Bram in the back
[1:11:45] of the platform getting ready to come
[1:11:46] out and preach and the guy gets up. Uh,
[1:11:48] William Brandon couldn't make it here
[1:11:49] tonight. You imagine that? And what's
[1:11:52] amazing to me, Brother Brandham went
[1:11:52] back and preached for that guy later
[1:11:54] anyway. I probably would have been like,
[1:11:56] I don't know. I'm pretty busy. You
[1:11:58] cancel me last time I was in the back
[1:12:00] room. But, Brother Brandham, you think
[1:12:01] about that. Amen. It's astounding.
[1:12:04] But listen, you don't have to be William
[1:12:06] Brandham. You just have to believe the
[1:12:08] message God sent. You get the same
[1:12:10] portion of heaven. You get the same
[1:12:12] reward.
[1:12:14] Praise God. Amen. We don't need to
[1:12:16] impersonate it. Amen. The genuine's good
[1:12:18] enough.
[1:12:20] So, Brother talks about this. He's
[1:12:21] trying to fish that, put that eyelet
[1:12:23] through there because he's trying to get
[1:12:24] that rainbow trout. And in that original
[1:12:26] vision, he said, "This is that third
[1:12:27] pole. You're not going to tell anybody
[1:12:28] about it." He goes up in the tent
[1:12:30] vision. He looks down. Brother Ram's
[1:12:31] resting for just a moment. He looks
[1:12:32] down. The light leaves him. Amen. And
[1:12:35] goes in that little room. And the people
[1:12:36] going out, they get healed. Brother Ram
[1:12:38] says this in the seventh seal. It
[1:12:39] whirled away from me like that. Went
[1:12:40] over that tent. Said, "I'll meet you
[1:12:42] there." and said, "This will be the
[1:12:44] third pole and you won't tell it to
[1:12:46] nobody." And subino canyon this is the
[1:12:49] third pole. Amen. So we established the
[1:12:51] third pole is what he's talking about of
[1:12:53] his own ministry. Now he says this,
[1:12:55] there's three great things that goes
[1:12:56] with it. One unfolded today or
[1:12:58] yesterday. The other one unfolded today.
[1:13:01] And there's one thing I cannot interpret
[1:13:03] because it's in an unknown language. But
[1:13:05] I I stand here right now and looks right
[1:13:07] straight at it. And this is that third
[1:13:09] pull coming up. and the Holy Spirit of
[1:13:11] God. Oh my. That's the reason all heaven
[1:13:14] was silent. So notice he attached the
[1:13:17] third pole of his ministry and what
[1:13:18] God's doing to why there was silence in
[1:13:21] heaven. Amen. Ties in his own ministry.
[1:13:23] Now notice there's three things. One was
[1:13:24] yesterday, one day today, one forever.
[1:13:26] We'll come back to that in a second. But
[1:13:27] now I this is this is just me. I think
[1:13:29] the message bears this out, but you can
[1:13:30] take or leave it. The the unknown part,
[1:13:32] the unknown language part is the is the
[1:13:34] actual time of the coming of the Lord
[1:13:36] because no man knows the hour. Amen. But
[1:13:39] there's there's three parts to it.
[1:13:40] Brother B will explain this later. Amen.
[1:13:42] But the part that's today when he's
[1:13:43] preaching it is the third part of his
[1:13:45] ministry because Jesus Christ is the
[1:13:47] same yesterday, today, and forever. And
[1:13:50] this is actually what it ties into. Now,
[1:13:51] Brother Bam comes around four months
[1:13:52] later. Am I doing all right? Praise God.
[1:13:56] I don't know how the rest of you feel,
[1:13:57] but he's okay with this.
[1:14:00] Brother Bam comes around four months
[1:14:01] later. He preaches the sermon Christ the
[1:14:02] mystery of God revealed. And this he's
[1:14:04] going to tell you now the me my sermon
[1:14:06] today why the message the hour he's
[1:14:08] going to tell you why that's why he
[1:14:09] preaches it. Amen. And I think it's
[1:14:11] incredible because brother Bam says if
[1:14:12] you ever fail come back to this tape
[1:14:15] Christ the mystery. Why? Because the
[1:14:17] essence of what he's doing it's all tied
[1:14:20] up. That's where he makes the statement
[1:14:22] that uh uh that uh we're the church is
[1:14:25] the blood of Jesus Christ by the spirit.
[1:14:26] Amen. That's where he makes the so many
[1:14:28] of these statements. Amen. So he says
[1:14:30] this at the beginning of the sermon. He
[1:14:32] said, 'Now just as be just be as patient
[1:14:34] as you can for I feel that in here.
[1:14:37] Probably getting impatient already like
[1:14:38] here he goes again. He said if God will
[1:14:40] help me will reveal and bring to your
[1:14:42] mind all these other things that I have
[1:14:45] talked on all the days all through the
[1:14:48] days of the tabernacle why I have said
[1:14:51] what I've said and why I have done what
[1:14:53] I've done. This is why.
[1:14:55] So brother Ram's actually tying this to
[1:14:57] everything that God's done in his
[1:14:58] ministry all the way through. He's going
[1:15:00] to tell you in the sermon why. And
[1:15:02] that's why we're here today. Why is it
[1:15:04] important? Amen. Yeah, I believe the
[1:15:06] message, but why is that important?
[1:15:07] Amen. So, he reads Colossians the first
[1:15:10] chapter verses 15 to 29, which ends, of
[1:15:12] course, with the scripture. It's Christ
[1:15:13] the mystery which had been hid. This is
[1:15:16] the mystery, but it's now revealed. It's
[1:15:18] Christ in you, the hope of glory. So,
[1:15:22] it's the hope of glory. It It's not just
[1:15:24] our glory, but it's actually his that he
[1:15:26] would be glorified in his church. what
[1:15:27] Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians that
[1:15:29] we read at the beginning. It's the
[1:15:30] glorification of Jesus Christ with the
[1:15:32] bride of Jesus Christ. That is the
[1:15:34] mystery that was hid and is now going to
[1:15:37] be revealed. So he reads this and
[1:15:38] brother Bam says, "Now God had a purpose
[1:15:41] and a hidden mystery." And that's what I
[1:15:43] want to speak on to the church this
[1:15:45] morning. The hidden mystery of God that
[1:15:47] he had in his mind before the world ever
[1:15:49] began and how it's unfolded itself right
[1:15:52] down to this present hour we're living
[1:15:55] in. Then you will understand clearly
[1:15:57] then well you should some people don't
[1:15:59] but you will understand clearly then you
[1:16:01] see on I believe of what is being done.
[1:16:03] He said God's great mystery of how he
[1:16:06] said it's a secret. There's that word
[1:16:08] again. Remember there's a mystery.
[1:16:10] There's a secret. We'll keep coming back
[1:16:11] to this. It's a secret. He kept it a
[1:16:14] secret. Nobody know nothing about it.
[1:16:16] Even the angels didn't understand it.
[1:16:18] See he didn't reveal it. That's the
[1:16:20] reason under our seventh mystery when
[1:16:23] the seventh seal was opened there was
[1:16:26] silence. Now I've already told you it's
[1:16:27] the third pole. We read that. All right.
[1:16:29] Amen. So that's the reason there was
[1:16:31] silence. Jesus when he was on earth they
[1:16:33] wanted to know when he would come. He
[1:16:35] said even the son himself don't know
[1:16:37] when it's going to happen. See God has
[1:16:39] this all to himself. It's a secret.
[1:16:41] That's the reason there was silence in
[1:16:43] heaven for the space of half an hour.
[1:16:45] Seven thunders uttered their voices and
[1:16:47] John was even forbidden to write it. see
[1:16:49] the coming of the Lord.
[1:16:52] Now, this seems disassociation at first,
[1:16:54] but watch how he explains it. It's one
[1:16:56] thing he hasn't revealed of how he will
[1:16:58] come and when he will come. It's a good
[1:17:01] thing he doesn't. Then he says, "No, but
[1:17:03] he has showed or revealed it in every
[1:17:06] type that's in the Bible."
[1:17:09] Therefore, the entire Bible is the
[1:17:11] revelation of God's mystery in Christ.
[1:17:14] The entire Bible is an expression of one
[1:17:16] goal that God had one purpose. He wanted
[1:17:20] to achieve in the entire Bible. I think
[1:17:21] it's incredible. Amen. Because you know
[1:17:23] in your life you have different goals. I
[1:17:24] want to start a business. I want to go
[1:17:26] to school. I want to do this. I want to
[1:17:27] get married. God had one goal the whole
[1:17:29] time. God who can do all things. He
[1:17:31] knows all things. He's hyperfocused.
[1:17:33] He's got one goal and he's expressing it
[1:17:36] through the entire Bible. He says here,
[1:17:37] "Amen. All the acts, he says, all the
[1:17:39] acts of the believers in the Bible has
[1:17:41] been in type and expressing what God's
[1:17:43] great goal is. And now in this last day,
[1:17:46] he has revealed it and shows it and
[1:17:48] God's help will see it right here this
[1:17:50] morning. What the Lord had in his mind
[1:17:52] all along and has expressed it. He says,
[1:17:54] "Therefore, you can see the great
[1:17:55] meaning of what it's been to know this
[1:17:58] and then try to bring it to the people."
[1:18:01] He says, "And if you don't," he said, "I
[1:18:02] haven't went into details trying to
[1:18:03] explain it as God has revealed it to
[1:18:05] me." Now, brother Ben makes this point
[1:18:07] all through this sermon that that Christ
[1:18:09] comes. He's got three different there's
[1:18:11] three uh there's three folds of the
[1:18:13] revelation. It's one revelation. But
[1:18:15] Christ comes the first time to to to
[1:18:19] give himself an offering to sanctify the
[1:18:20] people to to to to redeem to uh to
[1:18:23] redeem his church. Amen. He comes and
[1:18:25] does that. Amen. Then he comes the
[1:18:27] second time to receive his church by
[1:18:29] getting preeminences. Amen. He gets
[1:18:31] primitance. God gets primitance in his
[1:18:33] son Christ Jesus. the first fold. That's
[1:18:35] yesterday. But then he comes and gets
[1:18:36] primitance in a church. That's today.
[1:18:38] That's the hour we're living. He wants
[1:18:40] preeminence in a people. Amen. And then
[1:18:42] he's going to come back with them to
[1:18:44] restore Eden on the earth. Now, brother
[1:18:46] M says this in paragraph 3:15. What did
[1:18:48] Paul say? This ties back in the
[1:18:50] scripture we read at the beginning. What
[1:18:52] did Paul say? Because I got a ph LLD and
[1:18:55] so forth, I believe. No, he said, I
[1:18:57] forgot all those things. The wisdom of
[1:18:58] man said had to die and I know I'm in
[1:19:00] the power of his resurrection. That's
[1:19:02] what I come to with a demonstration of
[1:19:04] God's power. What was it? Making Jesus
[1:19:08] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:19:10] forever. The same works that Jesus did,
[1:19:13] Paul did the same. And they seen God,
[1:19:15] the great father that had been
[1:19:16] demonstrated in the burning bush had
[1:19:18] demonstrated it to Paul. And here it was
[1:19:21] being demonstrated. He's the same in
[1:19:23] every age. God's threefold manner
[1:19:26] yesterday, today, and forever. what
[1:19:28] redeemer in his church preeminences in
[1:19:31] the coming kingdom. Amen. He says, you
[1:19:32] see it just as perfect as can be. Are
[1:19:35] you with me then? Amen. So this is where
[1:19:37] he's it's the same Christ in a in a man
[1:19:40] Christ Jesus. Now the anointing in a
[1:19:41] church and then coming back to rule the
[1:19:43] earth. Amen. So this is why this is
[1:19:45] important. Whatever this seventh seal
[1:19:47] is, it ties into the coming of the Lord.
[1:19:49] There's a mystery of that. The part
[1:19:50] nobody knows it. But there's a secret
[1:19:51] with it as well. Now I brother, he talks
[1:19:55] about this all different places in the
[1:19:57] message that Christ comes three times.
[1:19:59] Amen. He comes the first time he came as
[1:20:01] son of man. That's yesterday. That's the
[1:20:03] first fold. He comes through the church
[1:20:04] ages. It's the spirit of God, the son of
[1:20:06] God. Amen. And then at the end, he's
[1:20:08] going to come back in the millennial
[1:20:10] kingdom. He's going to rule as the son
[1:20:11] of David, fulfilling the messianic
[1:20:13] prophecy according to the Jews. Amen. So
[1:20:15] he's son of son of man, which is what? A
[1:20:17] prophet. Now I'm gonna maybe I should
[1:20:20] wait on this a little bit. I'm gonna I'm
[1:20:21] gonna labor on this for a second. Amen.
[1:20:22] Son of man. Everybody read son of man.
[1:20:25] You read commentaries. I love it. You
[1:20:26] read commentaries. You read people's
[1:20:28] interpretations. And when Jesus calls
[1:20:30] himself the son of man, people say,
[1:20:32] "Well, see, he's he's showing that he's
[1:20:33] a kinsman redeemer. He's a man." All
[1:20:35] this stuff. They tie that into the son
[1:20:36] of man. But the book of Ezekiel tells us
[1:20:39] and brother picks it up. What does son
[1:20:41] of man mean? It means a prophet.
[1:20:44] That's what a son of man. Nobody else
[1:20:45] caught that. Amen. It was hidden. Yet,
[1:20:48] it was all through the scripture. You
[1:20:50] see this? It's actually in plain sight
[1:20:52] once you see it. Son of man is a prophet
[1:20:54] ministry. Amen. When he was on the
[1:20:56] earth, he was the prophet that was
[1:20:58] fulfilling the words of Moses that a
[1:21:00] prophet God will raise up a prophet
[1:21:01] likened unto me. So the ministry of son
[1:21:04] of man is a prophet. And then we've had
[1:21:06] seven church ages and we've had we've
[1:21:08] had different gifts and things. Amen.
[1:21:10] And then he comes at the end of the
[1:21:12] church age and he's going to come back
[1:21:14] after the tribulation and rule as the
[1:21:15] son of David. Amen. But there's a
[1:21:18] secret. And brother Ram, he doesn't
[1:21:19] preach this until after the opening of
[1:21:21] the seals. He preaches Christ's mystery
[1:21:23] and he begins to preach there is these
[1:21:25] three comingings. Amen. But there's a
[1:21:27] mystery.
[1:21:29] There's a secret nobody knew about.
[1:21:31] Amen. They all saw these things, but
[1:21:33] there was a secret and it wasn't
[1:21:35] revealed till brother Ram catches it.
[1:21:37] Amen. And brother Ram explains it. I'm
[1:21:38] going to read the quotes. Jesus Christ
[1:21:40] before he takes his church physically
[1:21:43] before the change of the body, he comes
[1:21:45] back and reveals himself once again as
[1:21:46] the son of man.
[1:21:48] That's the secret of his ministry of the
[1:21:51] third pole that was hidden. Amen. For
[1:21:54] him to come back, I'll get into this a
[1:21:55] few minutes. For him to come back, he
[1:21:57] must first reveal himself to the church.
[1:22:00] How is he going to do that? Through a
[1:22:01] man like you and I. Through a prophet
[1:22:04] from the Gentiles. Amen. He's going to
[1:22:06] come back and reveal the word because it
[1:22:07] has to be a prophet. See, this is the
[1:22:10] whole issue we talked about at the
[1:22:11] beginning with the seals. Amen. You need
[1:22:13] to know what's in all them seven seals
[1:22:15] for rapturing faith. But the problem is
[1:22:17] when they all are done taking place,
[1:22:19] it's already over. So there has to be a
[1:22:21] way for you to see what those are about.
[1:22:23] Well, it actually be there going through
[1:22:25] it. So I I joke with my son about the
[1:22:27] the solution is time travel. The
[1:22:30] solution is for you to get caught up and
[1:22:32] see it by revelation before it happens.
[1:22:35] Amen. So he there's only one way to do
[1:22:38] that. There must be a prophet that can
[1:22:41] foretell it to show it.
[1:22:44] So the secret is the son of man, the
[1:22:47] third pole, the opening of the word, the
[1:22:49] revelation of the son of man. Luke
[1:22:51] 17:30, Malachi 4, it's all the same
[1:22:54] thing.
[1:22:56] Amen. Brother says this 1964, proving
[1:23:00] his word. Now remember, he come in three
[1:23:02] names. The son of man, a prophet, the
[1:23:03] son of God, the spirit, the son of David
[1:23:05] for the millennium, but in between.
[1:23:08] See, nobody saw it. That's why Satan
[1:23:10] can't impersonate. He's got no idea.
[1:23:12] Yet, it's right there in the scripture.
[1:23:14] Luke 17:30 has been there for 2,000
[1:23:15] years. Oh, that's been laying there the
[1:23:18] whole time, but nobody caught it because
[1:23:20] he never once said anything about it.
[1:23:22] Yet, it's there the whole time.
[1:23:24] He But in between this condition, now
[1:23:26] according to his own words, in the day
[1:23:28] when the son of man shall be revealed,
[1:23:31] reveal himself as what? Not son of God.
[1:23:34] Son of man will reveal himself in a
[1:23:37] different way. Now what does that make
[1:23:39] Malachi 4 exactly right? See the son of
[1:23:43] man will reveal himself not in a whole
[1:23:45] big denominations of things as we have
[1:23:47] through the ages but he would manifest
[1:23:49] himself as son of man again to make
[1:23:52] manifest Malachi 4.
[1:23:56] Hallelujah. Again he says 1965 I have
[1:23:59] heard but now I see. You look around
[1:24:01] today look at the condition we're in.
[1:24:03] Aren't we living in a modern Sodom
[1:24:05] Gomorrah? Hasn't the world come back?
[1:24:08] That was a gentile world because the
[1:24:10] Gentiles in the city that was destroyed
[1:24:11] back then by fire. Didn't Jesus say in
[1:24:14] St. Luke the 17th chapter, the 28th,
[1:24:17] 29th, 30th verse, as it was in the days
[1:24:19] of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming
[1:24:22] of the son of man, when the son of man
[1:24:24] is being revealed. What is a revealed?
[1:24:28] It's a secret made known. So there was a
[1:24:32] secret, but the revealing makes it
[1:24:34] known. He says, "A revelation is to
[1:24:35] reveal or make known a secret." Now, I
[1:24:38] love this scripture, Luke 17:30, because
[1:24:39] I believe it. What I love about too is
[1:24:42] he makes this point as it was in the
[1:24:44] days of Sodom or as it was in the days
[1:24:45] of Noah. Amen. And brother Bam in the
[1:24:48] 60s is saying it's a Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:24:50] now. Amen. That's why I know the
[1:24:51] Revelation can't come in 2025. We're
[1:24:53] worse.
[1:24:55] We're done past that point by 60 years.
[1:24:57] Amen. That was the condition 60 years
[1:24:59] ago. But that was the condition that God
[1:25:01] prophesied it would be revealed in.
[1:25:03] Amen. as it was in the days of Sodom. Oh
[1:25:06] my, look where the world's gone. This is
[1:25:08] what would have happened to Sodom
[1:25:09] Gomorra if they went on for another 60
[1:25:10] years. Amen. Brother says again in
[1:25:13] modern events made clear by prophecy
[1:25:14] 1965. That's right. And today before
[1:25:17] Jesus comes again, the full
[1:25:19] manifestation of the person of Jesus
[1:25:22] Christ is to be manifest in flesh. Think
[1:25:24] of it. Jesus said, "As it was in the
[1:25:27] days of Sodom, so shall it be at the
[1:25:30] coming of the son of man." When the son
[1:25:32] of man is revealed, what is revealed?
[1:25:35] Unknown, unfolded, made known. The
[1:25:38] secret has been brought forth, revealed
[1:25:41] in the day that the son of man will be
[1:25:43] revealed, the world will be in a solemn
[1:25:45] condition. We've got it, haven't we?
[1:25:48] Says, "How many believe it? It's a Sodom
[1:25:49] condition." That's exactly right. Look
[1:25:51] where it's setting now. Now, so I read
[1:25:54] all this to make this point. So why the
[1:25:55] message of the hour? Amen. Cuz I feel
[1:25:57] like a lot of times our young people,
[1:25:59] they they hear stuff, they hear quotes.
[1:26:01] Sometimes even when we're we hear so
[1:26:02] much stuff and listen, I I'm an
[1:26:04] evangelist. I preach and I I'll labor on
[1:26:06] some certain thing in your life that
[1:26:07] you're going through, whatever. But but
[1:26:08] this is really the heart of it all.
[1:26:09] Amen. Why is the message important to
[1:26:12] us? And I want to say this. It's because
[1:26:14] we're not just anti- error. We are
[1:26:17] protruuth.
[1:26:19] Praise the Lord. Now you say, "Well,
[1:26:21] what do you mean by that?" Well, there's
[1:26:22] people, for example, that come against
[1:26:23] this very message and they will look at
[1:26:26] certain dates and they'll look at
[1:26:27] certain things and they can't receive
[1:26:28] that God would speak through a man with
[1:26:30] mistakes like all of us, like all
[1:26:31] through the Bible. So, they'll look at
[1:26:33] Brother Ram's life and they'll criticize
[1:26:35] him and their problems really not with
[1:26:37] William Bram, it's with what he's
[1:26:38] preaching. Amen. Because it condemns
[1:26:39] their life. It condemns their heart.
[1:26:41] Amen. So, they'll look at that and
[1:26:43] they'll look for errors and they'll say,
[1:26:45] "The message is wrong because of this
[1:26:47] and that and this." Amen. But there's a
[1:26:48] big problem with that. They can tell you
[1:26:50] what's wrong with the message, but they
[1:26:51] can't actually tell you what's right.
[1:26:53] They don't know how many gods they
[1:26:54] believe in. They don't know what kind of
[1:26:55] baptism they believe in. Amen. Listen, I
[1:26:57] heard a guy, and I'm not saying this
[1:26:58] critically, but I heard a man, a message
[1:27:00] preacher. He left the message, and I was
[1:27:02] listening to him preach something a few
[1:27:03] years later, and here he is quoting
[1:27:05] brother Brandham.
[1:27:08] And I'm thinking, you don't believe that
[1:27:10] though. But it worked out for his
[1:27:12] sermon, so he used it. Amen. See, there
[1:27:15] they claim to be anti-air. We're coming
[1:27:17] against falsehood. Listen, we got a pope
[1:27:20] from the United States. He He's a
[1:27:21] proving guy, but originally from the
[1:27:22] United States. Listen, the message
[1:27:24] people are not the only people that
[1:27:27] believe that the Catholic Church is
[1:27:28] Antichrist. You realize this? We're not
[1:27:30] the only one. Now, we've got a prophecy
[1:27:32] about it. Praise God. There's all kinds
[1:27:34] of people all through the church ages.
[1:27:35] Even there's all kinds of people that
[1:27:37] they are against what the Roman Catholic
[1:27:39] Church stands for because they know it's
[1:27:41] wrong. Amen. But listen, knowing that
[1:27:43] the Roman Catholic Church is wrong
[1:27:45] doesn't make you right.
[1:27:48] Knowing that what these churches teach
[1:27:49] is wrong, that doesn't make you right.
[1:27:51] We're not just against error. We're for
[1:27:54] the truth. Because the truth is the only
[1:27:57] thing that can set you free. You'll know
[1:28:00] the truth and the truth shall make you
[1:28:03] free. So, there's got to be more than
[1:28:05] just finding fault in everybody else
[1:28:06] because you can find fault in me. You
[1:28:08] can find fault in a pastor. If you do a
[1:28:10] good job, you can find it in your own
[1:28:11] life, which is where you should be
[1:28:12] looking for it at.
[1:28:14] You can find fault with anything. If you
[1:28:16] try hard enough, you can find fault in
[1:28:18] this Bible. Now, there is none.
[1:28:20] But you'll find it. And you say, "Well,
[1:28:22] this is why I don't believe that." But
[1:28:24] you don't have anything to lead me to.
[1:28:26] Amen. Don't tell me that the message is
[1:28:28] wrong. And you can't show me something
[1:28:30] better. But the said, "If this ain't it,
[1:28:32] I'll take this till that comes. Find me
[1:28:35] something else that'll do what this
[1:28:36] does, and I would accept it."
[1:28:41] We are protruth. Amen. So, lots of
[1:28:45] people know that certain things are
[1:28:46] wrong, but they don't have the
[1:28:47] revelation of what is right to put them
[1:28:50] in a rapture. Amen. So, this message did
[1:28:53] not just come to correct the heirs of
[1:28:54] the church like some preachers. Every
[1:28:56] sermon, they're just coming down.
[1:28:57] They're coming on you. Well,
[1:28:59] man, I really rather people over the
[1:29:00] coals today. Man, I really teach them
[1:29:02] backsliding heathen devil pagans.
[1:29:05] Some people really enjoy just letting
[1:29:06] you know you're wrong every time they
[1:29:07] preach. Well, but that won't do you any
[1:29:10] good if I don't have a remedy. If
[1:29:12] there's not something to lead you to
[1:29:14] that can change your life. Listen, if
[1:29:16] the doctor comes up and says, "Listen,
[1:29:18] you got this disease. It's fatal and
[1:29:19] you're going to die." Well, thanks a
[1:29:22] lot. You got a cure. Well, we ain't got
[1:29:23] nothing for you. Well, you might as well
[1:29:25] not even bother tell me then. I mean,
[1:29:28] I'm not saying they shouldn't, but you
[1:29:29] see what I'm saying? Like, I need an
[1:29:32] answer to the devil's question. I need
[1:29:34] something that's going to change this
[1:29:35] vile body. Amen. You're not going to
[1:29:38] find it in denomination. Amen. You're
[1:29:41] not going to get it from some na some
[1:29:43] man's thinking. Amen. There's a that's
[1:29:46] what the message come to. Not just
[1:29:47] correct errors, not just restore the
[1:29:49] hearts of the children. Amen. But it
[1:29:51] come to reveal the son of man. Amen.
[1:29:54] Because correcting error by itself
[1:29:55] cannot produce a rapture. But the Lord
[1:29:58] himself has descended with a shout.
[1:30:00] What's it do? It gathers the people to
[1:30:03] what? To Christ. Amen. It prepares a
[1:30:07] people for the coming of the Lord. Why?
[1:30:10] The Bible says faith comes by hearing
[1:30:12] and hearing by the word of God. Amen.
[1:30:15] So, you've got ears to hear in the first
[1:30:17] place. That's why you hear and other
[1:30:19] people miss it. That's why you see what
[1:30:22] other people miss. Amen. It's a
[1:30:23] prophetic ministry just like Ezekiel
[1:30:25] talked about the son of man. It's Christ
[1:30:28] revealing his church. Amen.
[1:30:30] It's interesting because John himself,
[1:30:31] when you read the the gospel according
[1:30:33] to John, you read his epistles, he's
[1:30:35] always referring to Jesus, the son of
[1:30:36] God. The son of God, the son of God.
[1:30:37] Amen. That's what he's preaching as
[1:30:39] because it's in the church ages. Amen.
[1:30:41] But when he's on the aisle of Patmos,
[1:30:43] Revelation the first chapter when he
[1:30:45] hears a voice, he turns to see what one
[1:30:48] like the son of man. See, it was laying
[1:30:51] there the whole time. Every type
[1:30:54] expressed it, but nobody caught it. It
[1:30:56] took God to open it up.
[1:30:59] Amen. Brother Ram says in proving his
[1:31:01] word 65 he said as it was in the days of
[1:31:03] Sodom so shall it be in the day when the
[1:31:05] son of man will be revealed. Now did you
[1:31:07] notice from son of God just before he
[1:31:10] becomes son of David he reveals himself
[1:31:12] again as son of man. Did you notice the
[1:31:14] scripture? He says for he always does.
[1:31:17] He never does nothing unless he makes it
[1:31:20] known to his servants the prophets.
[1:31:22] That's exactly that's what his promise
[1:31:24] was. He never does nothing. God cannot
[1:31:26] lie. He always reveals it first before
[1:31:29] he does it.
[1:31:32] Now, I want to come to the next point I
[1:31:34] want to get to real quick. Amen. I I
[1:31:35] told you my story. I was looking for
[1:31:38] something.
[1:31:39] What I got was not what I expected.
[1:31:41] Well, there's a reason for that. That's
[1:31:42] why people missed it when he preached it
[1:31:43] in 63. Amen. They were thinking the same
[1:31:46] thing. What when we get this, we're
[1:31:48] going to empty out hospitals. We're
[1:31:49] going to split the sky. And brother Bam
[1:31:50] tells you later that's that that's the
[1:31:52] two prophets that come do all these
[1:31:53] signs and wonders. That's not the bride.
[1:31:55] Amen. Now, it doesn't mean we don't have
[1:31:56] miracles. It doesn't mean we don't
[1:31:57] believe in gifts. That's always been
[1:31:59] here. Amen. That has actually always
[1:32:02] been here. It's been restored through
[1:32:04] the last three church ages. Amen. That's
[1:32:06] not entirely the point of the revealing
[1:32:08] of the son of man. Brother says this in
[1:32:09] one in a million. Did you ever think
[1:32:11] what the people did?
[1:32:13] Uh he's talking about Jesus when he was
[1:32:15] on the earth, they were looking for
[1:32:16] Elijah to come. He says they went right
[1:32:18] on believing that Elias was coming and
[1:32:21] he was right among them and they didn't
[1:32:23] know it. So will it be in the coming of
[1:32:27] the son of man.
[1:32:30] They'll do with them just exactly the
[1:32:32] same thing. Let me say it this way. It
[1:32:34] almost is it's almost underwhelming at
[1:32:36] first. You're like, "Well, that's it.
[1:32:38] There ain't nothing to that because you
[1:32:40] miss the importance of it because you're
[1:32:42] looking for something else." I use this
[1:32:43] example. Uh you think about Noah in the
[1:32:45] days of Noah. Noah gets a revelation
[1:32:47] that's going to rain on the earth and
[1:32:49] he's to build an ark for the saving of
[1:32:50] his house. Amen. 120 years they're
[1:32:53] working at this. If I could dramatize
[1:32:55] this for a second, maybe maybe Shem woke
[1:32:56] up one day. I always use I don't know
[1:32:58] why I use 89, but year 89, he wakes up
[1:33:01] one day. He's been doing this for 89
[1:33:02] years, working on this thing. And maybe
[1:33:05] his back hurts a little more than it did
[1:33:06] 89 years ago. Maybe maybe he's got a
[1:33:07] couple wrinkles. Whatever it is. Amen.
[1:33:09] And maybe he gets up one day and says,
[1:33:10] "Boy, you know, I'd sure like to take a
[1:33:12] day off. We've been doing this a long
[1:33:13] time and nothing seems to have changed."
[1:33:16] Amen. In other words, for almost 120
[1:33:19] years, looked like nothing was
[1:33:21] happening, but something was happening.
[1:33:23] They were getting prepared. Amen. See,
[1:33:26] you don't know the significance of the
[1:33:28] revelation till it comes on. Amen. The
[1:33:31] significance of building an arc for the
[1:33:33] senior house wasn't did it wasn't it
[1:33:35] wasn't visible till the rain start to
[1:33:37] fall. And people, they're looking for
[1:33:40] what's the message doing for it? It's
[1:33:42] preparing you for the coming of the
[1:33:43] Lord. I probably probably I'm going to
[1:33:45] say probably because every time I say
[1:33:47] something definitely there's always one
[1:33:49] person. Probably none of us in here have
[1:33:51] ever had a body change.
[1:33:53] Amen. Probably none of us in here have
[1:33:56] been changed from death unto life. Put
[1:33:58] taken this mortality and put on
[1:33:59] immortality because you've never done
[1:34:01] that. Sometimes you sit there and you
[1:34:04] undervalue
[1:34:05] what the message has actually done.
[1:34:07] Well, we just seem like everybody else.
[1:34:09] Well, you don't see what the
[1:34:10] revelation's done, though. It's prepared
[1:34:13] a people not just for greater miracles,
[1:34:15] not just for them having a bigger church
[1:34:17] or bigger meetings. It's prepared them
[1:34:19] for the coming of the Lord. And because
[1:34:22] you haven't had a body change yet, some
[1:34:24] days you wake up and think, "Well, it
[1:34:25] doesn't seem like God's doing nothing."
[1:34:27] But he's doing something all the time.
[1:34:29] Amen. It's working in you even now to
[1:34:32] bring on rapturing faith in the people
[1:34:34] by getting preeminence.
[1:34:37] The revelation on the seventh seal is
[1:34:40] what makes rapturing faith possible.
[1:34:42] Amen. Brother Bam says this. Now
[1:34:44] remember, we're talking about Elijah and
[1:34:45] stuff. Brother Bam during the seals,
[1:34:47] he's preaching about being humble. He's
[1:34:48] just talking about being humble. I I
[1:34:50] think it was in the fifth seal, but he
[1:34:51] says like the previous Sunday, whenever
[1:34:52] it is, he's talking about it. And he
[1:34:54] says this in the seventh seal in
[1:34:56] paragraph 304 305. He says, "We're at
[1:34:58] the end time, the opening of the seventh
[1:35:00] seal." He says, "Now, how did I know?"
[1:35:02] He said the other day, last Sunday, a
[1:35:03] week ago today, when I was preaching on
[1:35:05] be humble, be humble. Remember, God
[1:35:08] deals in That's a good message for all
[1:35:10] of us. Be humble. Remember, God deals in
[1:35:13] little things. I didn't realize what it
[1:35:16] really was talking about. And now I see
[1:35:18] it. It's such a humble way. You would
[1:35:22] think that something like that, talking
[1:35:24] about the seventh seal, something be
[1:35:26] revealed to the Vatican, but it comes
[1:35:27] like John the Baptist.
[1:35:30] In other words, John comes and they
[1:35:32] don't, oh, where where's it at? We're
[1:35:34] looking for Elijah. We're looking for
[1:35:35] the ministry. It already happened and
[1:35:37] you didn't realize it because they
[1:35:39] thought John was going to come and
[1:35:40] flatten the mountains and raise up like
[1:35:43] literally. But that's not what God was
[1:35:45] looking to do. The purpose of Elijah,
[1:35:48] the purpose of John's ministry was to
[1:35:50] prepare the coming of the Lord. Amen.
[1:35:54] Now, John's out here and they're looking
[1:35:56] for something else. And yet, that's
[1:35:58] Jesus' own words. There's never been a
[1:36:00] prophet born a woman greater than this
[1:36:02] man.
[1:36:05] Now, maybe they didn't see it that way,
[1:36:06] but that's how God saw it. Amen. It
[1:36:09] comes like John the Baptist. It comes
[1:36:10] like the birth of our Lord in a stable.
[1:36:14] Amen. So, we, this is what I'm saying.
[1:36:17] We tend to undervalue it as brother Van
[1:36:19] basically predicts and we're going to
[1:36:20] read this, but it's just like the
[1:36:21] disciples come to Jesus. Well, where's
[1:36:23] it at? It's here. It come and gone. You
[1:36:25] missed it. That's why we're looking for
[1:36:28] the seventh seal be it happened and you
[1:36:30] missed it because it was too humble.
[1:36:32] Well, that means the problem is our
[1:36:34] arrogance.
[1:36:36] Amen. Why didn't I see the things? Well,
[1:36:37] you need to humble yourself. Amen. See,
[1:36:41] if you're not humble, you want it to do
[1:36:43] a certain thing. Like I said earlier,
[1:36:44] you have an expectation. And if it don't
[1:36:46] make you a bigger man, if it don't
[1:36:48] validate your ministry, if it don't do
[1:36:50] this, well, then I'm still looking for
[1:36:52] it. Well, you'll be looking for it till
[1:36:53] the till the tribulation. because what
[1:36:55] you're looking for is not going to
[1:36:56] happen that way. But it's gonna happen
[1:36:58] exactly the way God said. It's like I
[1:36:59] told a brother the other day, I was
[1:37:00] talking to him. I said, you know, God is
[1:37:02] reliable, but he's not predictable. God
[1:37:04] will always do what he said, how he
[1:37:07] said, but you can't predict it because
[1:37:08] he'll do it in a way that you can't
[1:37:09] think of. He's so much bigger than your
[1:37:12] thinking. He's so much bigger than our
[1:37:14] ideas. Amen. And when we try to limit
[1:37:16] God, Amen. We try to put him in a box.
[1:37:18] We try to tell him how to do his
[1:37:19] business. Listen, God's going to do it
[1:37:20] how he wants. And what you need to do is
[1:37:22] humble yourself. Say, "God, I want to
[1:37:23] see it the way you see it." Your own
[1:37:26] problems, your own life. Why am I going
[1:37:28] through this? Why do I do this? Pray,
[1:37:30] "God, let me see this the way you see
[1:37:32] it." Amen. I was just thinking about
[1:37:34] this last night. You know, I changed how
[1:37:35] I started praying a few years ago and it
[1:37:37] it brings me a lot of peace. Amen. We
[1:37:38] were what we were touching on the office
[1:37:40] a little bit even. Amen. I stopped
[1:37:42] looking at situations, just praying,
[1:37:43] "God, fix this situation. God, give me
[1:37:45] direction. God, this." I started
[1:37:47] praying, "God, help me to see the bigger
[1:37:49] picture. Help me to see why this is
[1:37:51] going, what you're trying to do. I want
[1:37:53] to get behind, Lord. If you if I have to
[1:37:54] suffer and do this, but there's a reason
[1:37:56] behind it, Lord, help me to see it. I
[1:37:58] want to get behind whatever it is. If
[1:38:02] I'm going through something, Lord, help
[1:38:03] me to see, did I make this happen, or is
[1:38:05] this the will of the Lord? And if it's
[1:38:06] the will of the Lord, I want to submit
[1:38:08] to it no matter what it looks like.
[1:38:11] Lord, help me to see what you're doing.
[1:38:13] Help me to see the bigger picture. The
[1:38:15] picture's so much bigger than us.
[1:38:17] Listen, that was what Abraham dealt
[1:38:18] with. He's wanting a son. He's won a
[1:38:20] promised son. God's like, "Listen, I'm
[1:38:22] trying to make uh you a blessing to all
[1:38:24] nations. You just want a baby, but I
[1:38:27] want to save the nations. I'm kings are
[1:38:30] in your loins. It's so much bigger than
[1:38:32] one person.
[1:38:34] It's bigger than my ministry and my
[1:38:36] mantle and my anointing and you're this
[1:38:37] and you. It's so much bigger. God, help
[1:38:39] us to see the picture in a better a
[1:38:42] bigger light. It's so much greater yet
[1:38:45] it's so humble." And this is why they
[1:38:47] come to brother. Was the bride going to
[1:38:48] have a ministry? Oh yeah, I should do
[1:38:50] signs and why should I do all this? It's
[1:38:51] going on right now. He said then he said
[1:38:53] it's so humble. That's why he tells him
[1:38:55] in the seals. Don't try to be a big
[1:38:56] something. Live a humble Christian life.
[1:38:58] If you're not humble, you'll miss it.
[1:39:01] You're trying to make a big thing. It's
[1:39:03] as big as it needs to be. It's not big
[1:39:06] to men.
[1:39:08] The wise and prudent don't notice it.
[1:39:10] That's because it's hidden from them.
[1:39:12] Now, where did God hide his revelation?
[1:39:14] In simplicity. Where does he reveal? In
[1:39:17] simplicity.
[1:39:19] The way up with God is down. Humble
[1:39:20] yourself.
[1:39:22] Praise the Lord. Oh man, if we had, you
[1:39:26] know,
[1:39:27] you know, it's like we had this, like I
[1:39:29] mentioned a little bit earlier, you
[1:39:30] know, we had a a pope recently and uh,
[1:39:32] you know, Brother M talks about 1954.
[1:39:35] You know, probably everybody heard the
[1:39:36] quote by now. You've probably heard it
[1:39:38] once or twice an hour for about a week.
[1:39:40] So, I'm not going to read it to you
[1:39:41] again. You probably got it beat over
[1:39:42] your head. Amen. Maybe you're sick of
[1:39:45] hearing it. Some people like, I'm done
[1:39:46] hearing. I got it.
[1:39:48] Amen.
[1:39:50] When that happened, you knew whatever
[1:39:51] message church was preaching that
[1:39:52] Sunday.
[1:39:54] True. Now, here's my point. People can
[1:39:56] go on a limb with it and make it make
[1:39:59] that say anything they want. Amen. If
[1:40:00] we're not careful, you can try to
[1:40:02] interpret it too much. Amen. So, I'm not
[1:40:04] going to quote it. But my point is this.
[1:40:06] The whole world's caught up in this
[1:40:07] people. It's amazing. Oh, man. This
[1:40:09] great man, we're so happy. He's so
[1:40:11] humble. He And I don't know. He's
[1:40:13] probably a nice guy. I don't know. No, I
[1:40:15] really don't. Amen. don't know nothing
[1:40:16] about him personally, but I know what
[1:40:18] the Bible says is going to happen. I
[1:40:19] know what scripture testifies.
[1:40:22] And what's funny is for hundreds of
[1:40:24] years the Protestant church since 1517
[1:40:27] defied the Catholic Church and they were
[1:40:30] executed. They were martyed. The dark
[1:40:31] ages come. All this stuff happened and
[1:40:34] now we embrace it with open arms. We're
[1:40:36] all going to be one big happy group.
[1:40:37] Amen. See, they don't see what you're
[1:40:40] seeing.
[1:40:43] They rejoice about it. And you're like,
[1:40:45] I'm rejoicing, but for a whole different
[1:40:46] reason. It's going home time. We're just
[1:40:50] that much closer. Amen. I'm so glad I'm
[1:40:52] not caught up in it. I'm caught up in
[1:40:55] Jesus Christ. Amen. That quote, if we're
[1:40:57] not careful, we forget. Listen, there's
[1:41:00] tribulation coming. There's darkness
[1:41:02] coming. But you're not a part of it.
[1:41:05] That's why the message, it's for you.
[1:41:08] Amen. The listen friends, the ministry
[1:41:10] of the son of man, the third pole, the
[1:41:12] revealing Christ, it's a shout. That's
[1:41:14] what makes it a new book. Amen. That's
[1:41:16] why the world's looking forward to a new
[1:41:18] pope.
[1:41:19] And you're looking forward to leaving
[1:41:21] this world. Amen.
[1:41:24] Remember that it can't be impersonated.
[1:41:25] There's now again, I got to qualify. To
[1:41:28] my knowledge, there is no group, no
[1:41:30] denomination, no cult, nothing outside
[1:41:33] of this message that teaches about the
[1:41:35] revealing son of man like that. Amen.
[1:41:37] That's why it can't be in person.
[1:41:38] They've got nothing to base it on. Amen.
[1:41:40] Yet it's right there in the scripture.
[1:41:41] Even the pope himself, this is my point.
[1:41:43] He sits there and he sends vicarious
[1:41:45] file day in thestead of the son of God.
[1:41:49] Amen. There's impersonators, false
[1:41:51] Christs, false anointed ones, people
[1:41:53] that they claim to be in the place of
[1:41:54] the son of God. But who can take the
[1:41:56] place of the son of man? No one. Show me
[1:41:59] another ministry that can stand at the
[1:42:01] platform and turn his back to the people
[1:42:03] and discern the thoughts intent of the
[1:42:05] every time. Amen. They can you you can't
[1:42:07] impersonate that. That's why there'll be
[1:42:10] no impersonations. The closest you can
[1:42:12] do is take the prophet's words and take
[1:42:14] about what he talks about of somebody
[1:42:16] coming up and make yourself that. But
[1:42:18] you can't replicate what he did. It
[1:42:21] can't be impersonated.
[1:42:24] Oh my. That's why there's no
[1:42:26] impersonations to this. Praise the Lord.
[1:42:28] That's why Brother Ben makes this
[1:42:30] statement. He says this. Let me let me
[1:42:33] qualify this real quick. You know, I was
[1:42:34] uh I was uh I was out of the state here
[1:42:36] about a month ago, and my my daughter
[1:42:38] Virginia uh I don't know if anybody can
[1:42:40] relate to this when she was little. She
[1:42:42] hated to read. I I mean, she would cry.
[1:42:44] My wife go, "You need to read this." And
[1:42:46] she just she she fought reading so much.
[1:42:48] She didn't want to read anything. And
[1:42:49] now she's always got a book. She's like,
[1:42:51] she went she's she hoards books. Like I
[1:42:55] don't have room for them anymore. Total
[1:42:58] 180 or Yeah. Praise the Lord for that.
[1:43:00] She loves. So, we're going to this book
[1:43:02] store the other day and she asked me,
[1:43:03] now I don't know how y'all feel about
[1:43:05] this, but this is where I was at. She
[1:43:07] asked me, she said, "Dad, I want to get
[1:43:08] Romeo and Juliet and read it." I'm
[1:43:10] thinking, "Not in my house, you know,
[1:43:12] we're message believers. We just read
[1:43:13] the Bible."
[1:43:16] Somebody finds out about that, you know,
[1:43:17] it'll be the end of my ministry. So, I'm
[1:43:20] thinking about it, but I then I
[1:43:22] remembered, and it's kind of funny
[1:43:24] because I'm getting ready to preach it,
[1:43:25] but the Ram talked about reading Roman
[1:43:27] and Juliet. He actually uses it in his
[1:43:29] sermons. So I'm like, "Go ahead and get
[1:43:30] it." Amen. Because I'm going to preach
[1:43:32] on it now. Brother says this. He says a
[1:43:34] bunch of different places, but he says
[1:43:35] this in 1963 in the sermon. Look, he
[1:43:38] says, "Look at the church today. It is
[1:43:40] in chaos, all mixed up in everything.
[1:43:42] We're looking. We've got more in there.
[1:43:44] We've got better than they have. We're
[1:43:46] this and that and the other." He said,
[1:43:48] "And there that bride is looking to the
[1:43:50] coming of the Lord Jesus, which that
[1:43:53] secret secret coming of Christ shall
[1:43:56] come and catch away his bride in the
[1:43:58] night." Like a book I read of Romeo and
[1:44:00] Juliet one time. How he come with a
[1:44:02] ladder and got his bride out among them.
[1:44:04] That's what Jesus will come someday and
[1:44:06] looking for that one.
[1:44:08] Not looking to his creeds, but looking
[1:44:10] to Christ, waiting for him to come with
[1:44:13] his heart centered. Amen. I got to
[1:44:15] thinking about that. You know, Romeo and
[1:44:17] Juliet, he uses a ladder. Amen. And it
[1:44:19] it ties into what I'm talking about
[1:44:20] today. People miss the revelation of the
[1:44:22] seventh seal that it's the son of man.
[1:44:23] They miss it. This is why brother Ram
[1:44:25] preaches God unrecognized. The prince of
[1:44:27] God unrecognized. He preaches this
[1:44:28] thing. The unveiling of God. God was
[1:44:31] doing this and people completely missed
[1:44:33] it. That's why he has to go back and
[1:44:34] preach it and say it again and again.
[1:44:36] They were missing it. Amen. I got to
[1:44:37] thinking that's what happened to Jacob.
[1:44:39] Amen. When he fled his father's house
[1:44:40] cuz his brother Esau's out to kill him.
[1:44:42] He went down one night. He went to a
[1:44:43] motel six or a red roof in one of these
[1:44:45] rough hotels. Amen. In a pillow, a bit
[1:44:48] of stone, sleeping on the rocks. Amen.
[1:44:51] That's a missionary if I ever heard of
[1:44:52] one. And he goes to bed there. He's
[1:44:55] fearing for his life. He's in danger.
[1:44:57] And while he's sleeping, he sees a
[1:45:00] ladder. And on this ladder, he sees the
[1:45:02] angels of God ascending and descending
[1:45:04] on this ladder. Amen. And he wakes. Now,
[1:45:07] look at his interpretation. He wakes up.
[1:45:10] He's seen a ladder with angels. He wakes
[1:45:11] up. Says, "Surely the Lord God was in
[1:45:14] this place. And I knew it not. God was
[1:45:18] here the whole time. I didn't feel it. I
[1:45:19] didn't see it. I didn't recognize it. It
[1:45:21] took a revelation. He was here the whole
[1:45:23] time and I missed it. I saw a rock. I
[1:45:27] was in danger. I saw I missed it. God
[1:45:29] was here. But he saw a ladder with
[1:45:31] angels ascending to recognize that means
[1:45:33] the presence of God. He calls it Bethl,
[1:45:36] the house of God. Surely God was here
[1:45:39] and I missed it. You know Jesus own
[1:45:41] disciples do the same thing later on.
[1:45:43] Amen. Philip goes and fetches Nathaniel.
[1:45:45] He hears about this Messiah and he comes
[1:45:47] back. He says, "Nathaniel, before you
[1:45:49] come to me, when you were under the
[1:45:50] tree, I saw you.
[1:45:53] I saw you." And I love his words. He
[1:45:55] says, "You're the son of God." Notice
[1:45:58] the son of God. You're the king of
[1:46:00] Israel. And I love Jesus words. He says,
[1:46:02] "You believe because of this. You
[1:46:04] believe because of the discernment at
[1:46:05] the second pole, we'd say, "Amen. You
[1:46:07] believe of that, but you're going to see
[1:46:08] something greater. You're going to see
[1:46:11] the angels ascending and descending on
[1:46:14] what? The son of man.
[1:46:18] What is the son of man? It's a ladder.
[1:46:20] It puts you in contact with God for a
[1:46:24] rapture. Amen. The angels of God
[1:46:26] ascended descended in 1963. That's why
[1:46:29] there was a cloud. The world saw a
[1:46:30] cloud. They didn't know, but we knew. If
[1:46:33] you turn and you look at it the right
[1:46:34] way, brother Ram said, "It's all about
[1:46:37] how you see it. If you look at it this
[1:46:39] way, that's our Lord up there.
[1:46:43] The revelation of the son of man is the
[1:46:45] ladder that puts you in place for the
[1:46:48] coming of the son of man to catch a
[1:46:50] right away. This is what puts you in
[1:46:52] contact. Amen. The world didn't realize
[1:46:55] it. But thank God this after this
[1:46:57] morning. God still morning. Thank God
[1:46:59] this morning we've got a recognition.
[1:47:01] This has come to make a connection. It's
[1:47:03] a love connection. Amen. Not like the
[1:47:05] world, not like the carnality of the
[1:47:07] world. There's a connection between God
[1:47:09] and his bride. He's put a ladder down to
[1:47:12] us. Amen. He come down to us so we could
[1:47:15] go back up to him. Amen. And we're going
[1:47:17] to meet him where? In the air? By the
[1:47:20] revelation of the son of man. It puts
[1:47:23] you in place for rapturing faith. It
[1:47:24] puts you in rapturing grace. Amen.
[1:47:27] Friends. Oh, praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:47:29] Hallelujah. If you've got that today,
[1:47:32] Titus chapter 2 says that's the blessed
[1:47:34] hope of the church, the appearing of our
[1:47:38] great God and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:47:42] Listen, that's an anchor of the soul,
[1:47:43] steadfast and sure.
[1:47:46] Listen, no matter what trials and
[1:47:47] troubles you're going through today,
[1:47:49] Amen. There's something in you.
[1:47:52] I was talking to brother here a few
[1:47:54] weeks back and he's going through this
[1:47:56] going through that and he said you know
[1:47:58] he was getting frustrated but he makes
[1:48:00] this point said you know what but at the
[1:48:02] end of the day I I got to make sure I'm
[1:48:03] ready for the coming Lord. Amen. I can't
[1:48:06] make anybody else ready but I just want
[1:48:07] to be right with the Lord. I'm like what
[1:48:08] makes you do that? What makes you expect
[1:48:11] him to come in any moment and want to
[1:48:12] live right because the revealing of the
[1:48:14] son of man you've heard. Amen. Brother
[1:48:16] Bram said when you recognize the word
[1:48:18] for your day. what I'm talking about
[1:48:19] when you recognize it to be eagle's food
[1:48:22] something that could put you in the air.
[1:48:24] Amen. You have heard from your theophony
[1:48:28] but explains in questions and answers
[1:48:30] your name on the book. It's not Lee Vale
[1:48:32] or Orman Neville. It's the mystery.
[1:48:34] You're in that mystery. And when you've
[1:48:36] seen it, you've seen your name in the
[1:48:38] book. That's how you know you're going
[1:48:40] to rapture. That's why you've got
[1:48:42] rapturing faith. You've seen it.
[1:48:45] And we undervalue it. Yeah. It's just
[1:48:48] not enough. Oh, it's more than enough.
[1:48:51] If you'll receive it and you'll embrace
[1:48:53] it and you'll cherish it, it's more than
[1:48:56] enough.
[1:48:59] It's your identification.
[1:49:01] You're one of them.
[1:49:04] Praise the Lord. We are not like those
[1:49:07] that sleep in the night. We are of the
[1:49:09] day. Why? Because we're awake. What do
[1:49:12] the thunders do? It awakes a bride out
[1:49:14] of her sleep. That's why you're not
[1:49:16] ignorant today. This little church right
[1:49:19] here in Fenton, Michigan. I almost said
[1:49:21] Ohio. Wouldn't do that to you. This
[1:49:24] little group here, you're seeing things
[1:49:26] that kings and prophets wanted to see.
[1:49:28] You're seeing things that congressmen
[1:49:29] and presidents, they can't see. You can
[1:49:31] get a Hubble Space Telescope. You can
[1:49:32] get an electronic microscope. They can't
[1:49:34] see what you see because it's by faith.
[1:49:38] And what you're seeing is what you
[1:49:40] become. Because when you look at it,
[1:49:42] that's what you become. As he is, so are
[1:49:44] we in this world. It's transforming you.
[1:49:47] Amen.
[1:49:49] Like I was saying, just I was talking
[1:49:50] the other day about this. Amen. Listen,
[1:49:52] I'm not just living from one trial to
[1:49:53] another, from one presidency to another,
[1:49:55] from one mishap to another. I'm being
[1:49:57] changed. You're being changed from glory
[1:50:00] to glory. He's changing me.
[1:50:03] What does it It's what you're looking
[1:50:04] at. The revelation of the son of man.
[1:50:07] We're awakened. We're of the day. We're
[1:50:10] watching and we're praying.
[1:50:15] Amen.
[1:50:16] We were just talking about, this is what
[1:50:17] we're talking about in the office. I I
[1:50:19] am more settled today than I've ever
[1:50:20] been before. I'm more convinced. I'm not
[1:50:23] wavering. I'm not st I am more convinced
[1:50:25] by the grace of God. I'm like Abraham.
[1:50:28] The longer I go, the stronger I get in
[1:50:29] faith. Amen. I am more convinced today
[1:50:31] of it than I've ever been before. Amen.
[1:50:33] I'm not doubting. I'm not getting shook
[1:50:35] up. I see things come to pass that just
[1:50:37] strengthens me. I just hunker down a
[1:50:39] little bit more. It ought to put
[1:50:40] something in your life. Man, I'm in the
[1:50:43] worst trial of my life. Yeah, but I've
[1:50:44] got something. And what I've got, it's
[1:50:47] going to take me through to the rapture.
[1:50:48] I don't have to hang my head down low. I
[1:50:51] can look up because my redemption's
[1:50:53] nigh. Hallelujah. I'll not fear what's
[1:50:55] coming my way. A thousand might fall my
[1:50:58] side and 10,000 in my right hand. It
[1:51:00] will not come nigh me. Only with my eyes
[1:51:03] will I behold the reward of the wicked.
[1:51:06] There's a token over my life. There's a
[1:51:09] token over my home. I'm There's a
[1:51:11] prophecy over my life. There is a
[1:51:13] people. You say prophecy over my life.
[1:51:15] He said, "I'm going to have a church.
[1:51:17] I'm one of them. I'm going to have a
[1:51:20] church with no spot, no blemish, no such
[1:51:23] thing." Listen, you can't do that in
[1:51:25] your flesh. That's not your human
[1:51:27] ability. It's what the Son of Man
[1:51:29] revealed about you, a sinless, virtuous
[1:51:33] bride of Jesus Christ. You believe that
[1:51:34] today as you stand to your feet? Oh, we
[1:51:37] such a blessed people. Amen. He's doing
[1:51:39] what he said he would do. It's working
[1:51:41] in me. It's working mightily in you.
[1:51:44] Amen. Don't ever doubt that. Amen. Well,
[1:51:48] I ain't nobody. I'm not important. I'm
[1:51:49] this and that. Wait till the rain falls.
[1:51:51] Amen. Listen, one day they're going to
[1:51:54] look for you. Maybe the Listen, I did
[1:51:57] census work here end of 2020 because of
[1:52:00] COVID. I needed something to do on the
[1:52:01] side. It's amazing to me how many houses
[1:52:04] just sit empty. People don't realize it
[1:52:06] for about a year. M stacking up.
[1:52:08] Finally, one of the the uh relatives or
[1:52:11] something comes along and deals with it.
[1:52:12] Amen. One of these days they like, "Hey,
[1:52:15] that Brother John guy lives down the
[1:52:16] street, man. I haven't seen him in a
[1:52:17] while where he ate he pastor that
[1:52:19] church. Where'd he go? I haven't seen
[1:52:20] him in months. He's gone. He's long
[1:52:23] gone. There's this brother, this Bruce
[1:52:25] Jakowski guy, man. That guy, he's so
[1:52:28] cool.
[1:52:29] Where'd he go?" "Oh, I don't know.
[1:52:31] You're going to be gone." and they're
[1:52:33] it's so humble they won't even realize
[1:52:35] it. Well, wasn't there supposed to be a
[1:52:37] coming of the Lord, it done happened and
[1:52:40] they missed it. They'll go on having
[1:52:42] church. They'll go having revival.
[1:52:44] They'll go and having altter calls
[1:52:45] thinking they're getting saved and they
[1:52:47] missed it.
[1:52:49] But you didn't miss it. You couldn't
[1:52:51] miss it. You've been magnetized.
[1:52:54] You got caught up. Oh, thank you. Ah,
[1:52:59] friends, it excites me. Amen. Listen, I
[1:53:01] I I love all this other stuff, but this
[1:53:04] this is the heart of what it is to me.
[1:53:07] You seeing it and what it means to me.
[1:53:09] Listen, I don't feel the same way today
[1:53:11] that I did when I first heard it. I
[1:53:12] didn't realize. Now that I see it, I can
[1:53:16] see now just who I am. Oh, it makes all
[1:53:19] the difference. Every trial, every
[1:53:21] problem, everything you go through, your
[1:53:23] whole attitude changes because you're
[1:53:25] destined for this, guys. You believe
[1:53:27] that today?
[1:53:29] Let's pray.
[1:53:31] Oh, heavenly father, so many times we we
[1:53:34] take it for granted. We don't realize
[1:53:35] why it's so important. So many things in
[1:53:37] our life that you do. And for this
[1:53:39] message especially, Lord, as a young
[1:53:40] man, I was I was so happy to be saved. I
[1:53:43] was so happy to have your spirit. I was
[1:53:45] so happy that you you showed me right
[1:53:47] from wrong. But I remember when I saw
[1:53:50] that son of man that was in the
[1:53:52] scriptures revealed through a prophet's
[1:53:54] mission, when I recognized it for what
[1:53:56] it was.
[1:53:58] Oh Lord, how it filled my heart with
[1:54:02] joy. How it changed the rest of my life.
[1:54:06] How it made the Bible a new book. How it
[1:54:08] revolutionalized
[1:54:11] everything that happened to me. Lord, I
[1:54:14] pray for every one of us here today.
[1:54:16] Yes, Lord. It would be the very same.
[1:54:19] Lord, may you show it to our young
[1:54:21] people. We're like Abraham. We're trying
[1:54:24] to teach young. May you show it to our
[1:54:25] old people. Anybody that's missed,
[1:54:26] anybody that's lost sight of it, Lord,
[1:54:29] may this be at the center of our
[1:54:32] thinking. Is Jesus Christ the same
[1:54:35] yesterday, today, and forever. It's
[1:54:37] Jesus Christ revealed as the son of man
[1:54:40] speaking to us. Oh God,
[1:54:44] I'm so thankful for this message. I'm so
[1:54:47] thankful for these words of life. Lord,
[1:54:50] you made a change in me. I couldn't
[1:54:52] change myself. Lord, you you changed the
[1:54:54] circumstances. You changed the way I
[1:54:55] looked at it, Lord. I didn't need you to
[1:54:58] change everything else. I needed the
[1:54:59] change in me. And it's changing me even
[1:55:02] now. From glory to glory. You're
[1:55:04] changing us. Amen. Oh, thank you, God.
[1:55:07] Bless these people. If there be a sick
[1:55:09] one here today, there'll be no sick ones
[1:55:11] in that rapture. But Lord, I believe
[1:55:13] there's a down payment in earnest today
[1:55:16] that even now in this world, we could be
[1:55:18] free from sickness. We can be free from
[1:55:20] depression. Lord, if there be one
[1:55:22] brokenhearted, may you bind them up. If
[1:55:24] there be one sick, may they be made
[1:55:25] well. May you bless your people with the
[1:55:27] the earnest of that inheritance that
[1:55:30] they would walk in the blessing of the
[1:55:31] fullness of the blessing of the gospel
[1:55:33] of Christ. Walking in newness of life.
[1:55:36] Bless this church. Bless the ministry.

[1:55:40] preeminence in every life. We ask and we

[1:56:27] heavenly.

[2:03:45] we'll live and reign forever.
[2:03:50] I'll meet you in the rapture some sweet
[2:03:55] day.
[2:03:56] [Music]
[2:03:59] Amen. It's going to happen. I'll fly
[2:04:01] away. I'll fly away.
[2:04:04] I believe it.
[2:04:06] Some glad morning when this life is
[2:04:11] over, I'll
[2:04:14] fly away
[2:04:17] to my home on God's celestial shore.
[2:04:22] I'll
[2:04:23] fly away.

[2:04:28] fly away. Oh glory, I'll

[2:04:36] I won't die. Hallelujah. By and by, I'll
[2:04:42] fly away.
[2:04:45] When the shadows of this life have
[2:04:49] grown, I'll
[2:04:51] fly away.
[2:04:54] Like a bird from prison, bars have
[2:04:58] flown. I
[2:05:01] fly away.
[2:05:04] I'll
[2:05:05] fly away, oh glory,
[2:05:10] fly away.
[2:05:13] I won't die. Hallelujah. By and by, I'll
[2:05:19] fly away.
[2:05:22] Just a few more weary days and then I'll
[2:05:28] fly away
[2:05:31] to a land where joy shall never end.
[2:05:36] I'll
[2:05:37] fly away.
[2:05:40] I'll
[2:05:42] fly away. Oh glory. I'll
[2:05:46] fly away.
[2:05:49] I won't die. Hallelujah. By and by, I'll
[2:05:56] fly away.
[2:05:59] I'll
[2:06:00] fly away. Oh, glory. I'll
[2:06:05] fly away.
[2:06:08] I won't die. Hallelujah. By and by, I'll
[2:06:14] fly away.
[2:06:19] Amen. Praise God.
[2:06:23] You asked me, "How do I know you're
[2:06:26] going to fly away?"
[2:06:29] Because I've been spending time going up
[2:06:31] and down the ladder.
[2:06:34] We're getting ready.
[2:06:37] If you're getting ready, you're going.
[2:06:40] But you got to get ready.
[2:06:43] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's just sing
[2:06:45] one more before we dismiss. All is well.
[2:06:48] Yes. We've heard the message. Amen.
