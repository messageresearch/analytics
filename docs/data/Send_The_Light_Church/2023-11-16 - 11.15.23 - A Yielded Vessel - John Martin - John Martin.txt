and give you the praise for it now in advance in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you turn with me if you would I think our first scripture reading is going to be Judges chapter 3 we threw that one in there for a particular reason Judges chapter 3 and you that are over here if you want to you can move over here you don't have to but feel at Liberty today you pretty much if you're ever wanting a seat but somebody else was sitting in and I think this is the day that you could grab that seat Judges chapter 3 we're going to read just one verse there and that's verse 31 and after him was shamgar the son of anath which slew of the Philistines 600 men with an ox gold and he also delivered Israel amen and then Romans chapter 6 Romans chapter 6 verse number 16 amen the script rure reads know ye not that to whom you yield yourselves servant to obey his servant ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or obedience unto righteousness God bless you you may be seated we want to title this message today a yielded vessel a yielded vessel now no man is an island he is governed by one Spirit or another I was reading earlier that brother brandom said that we are being influenced by one of two Spirits one of two Realms is always constantly influencing us that's right we we we are not an island to where we we just going to pick up our own influence we're going to go on Google and we're going to go over here and we're going to kind of try to help ourselves to be influenced Satan can use anything he even comes to church and God can use anything the thing is we are being governed by one Spirit at all times and every human being is a servant one or the other every human is either yielding to himself which is the devil when we yield to our own will it's the devil or we're yielding to the scriptures which is god let's continue read we just want to read four verses before we get into this Romans chapter 6:1 17 but God be thanked that ye were the Servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered unto you and that that obedience being made free from sin ye became the Servants of righteousness it was through the through The Obedience of the scriptures the doctrine when we begin to do what the scripture said rather than if it fit with our reasoning if it fit with our ideas verse uh 19 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to here it is Iniquity unto iniquity that's how we used to be right even so now yield your members servants to righteousness and Holiness well we got a big dose of what iniquity was uh that last service just not doing what you've been instructed to do and saying well I don't need to do that and that's pretty much how we were before we ever came to the Lord but after we came to the Lord it doesn't mean that we're not in iniquity anymore you think of of King David is just a perfect example uh a King serving and yet committed iniquity so it's it's it's all around us and we need to be careful now the word yield means to give the right away to surrender to submit and this requires an attitude of humility because you know you're you know how road rage starts right somebody cut you off and you're upset about the idea or you're driving and the guy that's trying to get on the expressway um he doesn't slow down uh he he wants to you know he's forcing you to get over somebody has to yield somebody has to give the right away and uh the scriptures are are teaching us here that we're yielding or giving the right away to one thing or another it's either to the scriptures or to our will and and and it uh it happens throughout the course of the day I I I you know I may be in the will of God working at trusted to I may be in the will of God of going to send the light church but I may be completely out of the will of God of everything else I'm doing that day so this is this we want to take this is is as much as we can uh deeply into our personal lives now when it comes to our whole walk with the Lord I want to make this statement I want to stick it's more important who we yield to than who we actually belong to now this is a very strong statement for those that believe in predestination well brother John I'm a predestinate seat of God and that's all that matters to me I just got some scriptures for that for that for that spirit that would want to speak to us Jude 1 verse5 says I will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having save the people out of the land of Egypt afterwards destroyed them that believe not they did not continue to yield themselves to God and we know according to Exodus that the Lord s said I have surely seen the afflictions of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Crying by reasons of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians so this was God's people he delivered them he saved them but afterwards destroyed them so what was more important who they belong to or who they were Ying to look at verse and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own and their own habitation he have reserved an everlasting change un under darkness and Judgment of the great day Angels which chose not to yield or give the right away to God but they decided to yield to their own will so what's more important who you're yielding to or who you belong to I know this is strong we wanted this is going to be more of a Bible study and I hope you don't mind a lot of reading tonight what we're actually yielding to every day is so much more important than what we realize we could look at what we're yielding to as simply as just seeds that we're sewing right and what and and and it and what we s is what we're going to reap so if you get up in the day and you're just all bothered and upset and everybody you talk to you're just kind of like in a mopy mood and you're not smiling and well by the end of the day you're you're not going to you know be reaping very good stuff and it's the same thing of how we yield to to certain Spirits now a person could be a vessel belonging to God but not saved so we're just we're trying to get some scriptures here that back up it's more important that who you're yielding to than who you belong to and what I mean of course if we're predestinated we're predestinated but the problem is the devil tells everybody that they're predestinated so we got to have a way to combat that thing so a person could be a vessel belonging to God but not be saved so unless that person yields to God they're never going to get saved it's more important to be yielded to God and we know that you just you repent you stop you stop doing your ways you say God I'm going to follow your ways and you you you do what the scripture says you obey the scriptures you yield to the scriptures and you become saved just by following the scriptures Saul was a predestinated vessel Jesus said that he had chosen him to bear his name but until Saul yielded his life he was only working against the Lord he was just kicking against the Lord's will so the importance of viting is just as important to day in our lives as it was the day that that that we got saved now God kicked Saul off his high horse but Saul had to choose to stay off the horse he had to choose to remain humble to follow the Lord's ways every single day it's that that big great thing that God gave us a free more agency to use it every day to bring God glory now a person could be saved by the blood but still be living in a dirty vessel they could be saved but not Sanctified not cleansed not washed not set aside for the service of God in order to be Sanctified one must learn to yield their vessel to the workings of the Holy Spirit according to the scriptures that's what brings about a Sanctified life we have to yield for that to happen you just can't come to church and hear this knowledge nothing's going to change you you have to yield to the scriptures now a person can be saved they can be Sanctified but still not filled with the Holy Ghost and that's because they have not continued to yield their life to the working of the Holy Spirit according to the scriptures because you got to continue to walk in more light more truth obey more scriptures to get more of God that's just all there is to it in Acts 5:32 says and we Are Witnesses of these things and so also is the holy Spirit whom God have given to them that obey him it comes to yielding yourself to the scriptures to obey the scriptures that we get filled with the Holy Ghost now of course there are times that God can just uh uh forgive cleanse and sanctify and and fills him with the Holy Ghost just like that it's true but it don't happen like that for the majority that's right and and there's a reason for it because God wants to prove prove us he wants to prove us it doesn't matter if you need to be saved Sanctified or filled with the Holy Ghost the secret key is to yield Our Lives more to the scripture so we have to get serious with God lord show me which other scriptures am I not yielding to that has to just be a heart's desire that's where the love affair comes in I wish we could just come to church hear the word you know turn the computer off as it were stop live streaming and be changed no no it's much harder than that we've got to bring our vessel under subjection to all those scriptures second Timothy 3:16 we've read this that all scriptures given by the inspiration of God and it is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works I I say the scriptures tell us how to yield properly the scriptures teach us how to yield properly know ye not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servant ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness now when I was in the world nobody in the world could have convinced me that I was I was a servant of the devil no way no no I mean I I was doing bad things yeah I yes I was smoking I was drinking I I I did bad things but nobody was going to tell me I was a servant of the devil that's and today there's so many Christians that have that same mentality so many Believers that have that same Pride that same mentality but to whom you yield yourself too that's it you're a servant of whoever you're ying and the thing is there's two things Satan tried to get Eve to yield to her will he had entice her with what she could have with her will that she couldn't have with God's Will and the devil Works overtime at trying to get us to to bite onto something that isn't God's will Saul was a yielded vessel onto sin but he just didn't know it we could say he was a yielded vessel unto himself he was like everyone that is born born to to do your own will that's why we need to be born again to do the will of God he learned he learned uh from the get-go to to to yield to his own understanding when his mom and dad were talking about you know who's going to teach our little son well they got the best brother B says they got the best man that they could get to teach him that was um Amia that's right thank you they got the best because they were leaning to their own understanding here's a man that can do it brother Bram says just five minutes in his presence can do more than what five years in a seminary of the best training just get in the presence of God he did what was right in his own eyes but he was evil he was evil you know he was viewed as a Pharisee above the Pharisees as a Hebrew of the Hebrews as a as a great man but he was evil because he leaned to his own understandings he he did he did what was wise in his own eyes it wasn't until he feared the Lord he humbled himself and he departed from muing to his own will that his eyes became more and more open turn with me if you would to the book of of Judges I want to go and and spend some time in the Book of Judges now have you ever just felt that you were in you were battling something that you couldn't put your finger on it I mean sometimes it's just trial after trial and you know there the Bible does say that there are there are times that there is a need of manifold temptations that there there's a need for us to go through things but I think a lot of times that we're in a war a war is going around all of us often and we don't recognize the battle we don't recognize the enemy we don't recognize what's happening how many feels that God could allow things to come in our life because we're not obeying him now there's something that we don't really want to look much into right and I love that you all raised your hands and you're behind this because it's just going to make it so much easier today the thing is it it takes a real humbleness of heart to say Lord would you show me is there something that I'm I'm yielding to the wrong thing and I'm doing the wrong thing so in the Book of Judges I'm just going to read the first U couple verses here in verse chapter one now after the death of Joshua and it came to pass that the children of Israel asked the Lord saying who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first to fight against them and the Lord said Judah shall go up uh behold I have delivered uh delivered the land into his hand so here we're we're going to see that God did not take the enemy out of the land so God gave Joshua Joshua went in there and he took possession of the land but the the enemy was not completely destroyed and this is important because our enemy is not completely destroyed so verse verse uh 21 now and the children of Benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabit Jerusalem notice Benjamin didn't do it now I just if I could back up to verse 19 and the Lord was with Judah and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had the Chariots of iron and they gave uh herban unto Caleb as Moses said and he expelled then the three sons of anoch now you see that they're taking possession of the land that God gave but at the same time that they're taking possession their enemy is allowed to stay around them are you with me verse 27 neither did manessa drive out the inhabitants of Beth Sheen and her towns verse 29 neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites verse 30 neither did zon drive out the inhabitants of kitan neither did Asha drive out the inhabitants of acho verse 32 but the uh a uh ashit dwelt among the Canaanites and inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them out verse 33 neither did uh Na naph drive out the inhabitants just they did not drive out all the inhabitants h h that's kind of scary don't you want the enemy away from you ver chapter 2 verse number one and the angel of the Lord came up from gilgal to bulam and said I made you to go up out of the out of Egypt and have brought you unto the land which I swear unto your fathers and I said I will never break my Covenant with you praise God for that and he and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land you can't have any connection with the enemy you shall throw down their altars but ye have not obeyed my voice why have ye done this so God call I'm I'm going to keep my Covenant you know you stay with me you follow my word you follow the light you follow me you do what I tell you to do there won't be anybody about to stand before you all the days of your life that's what he told Joshua but if you choose not to follow the things that I'm telling you every day then then you're going to have troubles you're going to have troubles wherefore I also said I will not drive them out from before you but they shall shall be as thorns in your sides and their gods shall be a snare unto you well remember the the the the parable that Jesus gave about the word falling on four different types of ground and one of the grounds was a ground that had thorns in it and it it it it it it became a snare and and sometimes we don't realize it but we're dealing with snares we're dealing with snares now how do I how do we know if that's it get serious in prayer you can you can take the proud side and say no I'm I'm so perfectly in the will of God I'm walking nothing you know this is all the devil all the devil all the devil like God doesn't have any control about things we're just going to go through the scriptures why why was God why was God God so against Israel why did God let his own people uh become in bondage and why did he let the enemy come against them why it wasn't because he was being mean they were not following him and every time they cried out to God every time they humbled thems God came and delivered them he's just faithful all right and it came to pass when the angel of the Lord spake these words verse four unto the children of Israel that the people lifted up their voices and wept well this was just sad news this was just sad news nobody wants to hear that uh God is going to be against them this is going to happen let's go to verse 11 and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and sered balum and the and they forsook the Lord God of their fathers which brought them out out of the land of Egypt and follow other gods of gods of the people which were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the Lord to so here it is they got involved with the things of the world that were around them and they forsook the Lord now they didn't stop going to church and they didn't say God isn't God but as soon as you start doing your will as soon as you decide that I don't have to to to to do what God is wanting me to do you're forsaking the Lord and we look at forsaking the Lord as somebody that picks up leaves the church and never comes back but God is looking at the heart he says you know with their lips they worship me but their heart is far from me so God is looking at the heart God tells brother Brandon make sure you tell the people that their their their thoughts speak louder in heaven than their words do on Earth so there's a something that goes on before the children of Israel ever went back into Egypt before it was in their heart to do it and so we can get involved real simple with the things that are outside of this church and outside of this word very easy easy and the devil has a clever way of saying well it's it's of the lord it's God still wants me to do it that's why we you need to be real humble real honest let the word vindicate what you're saying let the word vindicate it don't fight against the word amen all right verse 13 and they forsook the Lord and served BM and this other Queen of Heaven and the angel of the Lord was hot against Israel whoa it wasn't just a little bit against them but hot I don't want the Lord hot against me and he delivered them into the hands of the spoilers that spoiled them and he literally sold them into slavery that's what that means the hands of their enemies roundout so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies whether soever they went out the hand of the Lord was against them for evil as the Lord said and as the Lord had sworn into them sworn onto them and they were greatly distressed so notice this they were not able the end of verse 14 they were not able to stand before their enemy now it's one thing if there's a problem and you can take care of the problem you got an enemy you can take care of the enemy but when you got an enemy and no longer you can take care of him that means you've become an outright servant to them are you with me and and and and a lot of times not even recognizing it verse 16 nevertheless the Lord raised up judges which delivered them out of their hand of those that spoiled them and yet they would not hearken unto their judges but they went a horn after other gods and bowed themselves unto them and turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the Commandments of the Lord but they did not so and when the Lord raised up judges the Lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of the enemy all the days of the judge for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by the reason of them that were oppressed them and Vex them and it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers in the following other gods to serve them and to bow down unto them they ceased not from their own doings nor from their stubborn way H Lord help us and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel I don't want the Lord hot against me and he said because that this people have transgressed my Covenant which I commanded their fathers and have not hearkened unto my voice I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the the Nations which Joshua left when he died so there's a covenant we all have a covenant with God we told God when we got saved that we we repent of our sin forgive us Lord we promised we're going to get baptized we're going to follow you all the days of our life we're going to do what you want us to do that was our decision that we made now God has given us time to prove where we stand with that commitment that's where you see everybody is not on fire everybody's just not I I want all that you have for me Lord because there's approving time that through them I look at verse 22 that through them I may prove Israel whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein as their fathers did keep it or not therefore the Lord left those Nations without driving them out hastily neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua now ver chapter 3 verse one now these are the Nations which the Lord left to prove Israel by them even as many of Israel have not known all the wars of Canaan only that the generations of the children of Israel might know now here it is to teach them War or at the least such as no before knew nothing thereof namely the five Lords the Philistines Canaanites sodomites hivites um and uh uh that dwelt in the land of Lebanon Al so God allowed these to stay there and he allowed them to stay there for a reason one is so that his people Israel would learn how to fight learn how to war and to prove whether they're going to fight against them to keep them out to keep them away or if we're just going to not fight and we're just going to make a league with them we're just going to do the things of the world are you with me now this is now you notice everything in the Old Testament is a natural thing that transpired now in the New Testament it's a spiritual warfare there's a Warfare going on and every we can see better what's happening in the spiritual realm when we look at the Old Testament and we see what happened we are the spiritual Jerusalem we are the spiritual Israel but yet God just doesn't give us everything we want God is more interested in us yielding to him than us just waving the flag and say I belong to God he wants us to learn to yield he wants us to war war against the things of the world he wants us to war against our own will cuz we're in a battle all right let's drop on down I just I want to read verse four and they were to prove Israel by them to know whether they would hearken un the command Commandments of the Lord which he have commanded their fathers by the L by the hand of Moses now I just wonder God is proving us those that are on the live stream those that are here God is always proving us because like brother Ron says he's always calling us up higher God expects more out of me to whom much is given much is required so every day every week every month God expects more from us so I want to ask this question to everyone that's listening what is God proving you because if we don't think God's proving us then we don't have nothing to worry about and that's the problem we're not we're not being aware can I just read just a few oh I I will understand I want to I want to I want I'm really doing my best to tie this into our spiritual battle but I'm trying to show the example of what's happening in the Old Testament now let's take a look at uh first at verse uh five and the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites the Hittites the amorites the pites Hittites jebusites and they took their daughters uh to be their wives and gave their daughters to their sons and serve their gods and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and forgot the Lord their God and served balum and and the Groves and therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel and he sold them into the hand of the kushim King all right and Israel served 8 years verse 9 and when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel who delivered them out uh delivered them even alneel the son of Caz uh and that was Caleb's younger brother isn't that isn't that so neat Caleb's younger brother was the first judge and this Spirit of the Lord came upon him and he judged Israel and went out to War and the Lord delivered the kushan rash king of that that gentleman and the Lord had uh and and and the land had rest uh 40 years uh and annel the son of kzar died so here you see Israel did Evil and then God raised somebody up and I'll tell you it wasn't this this did not happen uh you just sit there and you stay in your sin and I and I'm just going to go kill your enemy for you that's not how it happens no because if that's how it happened then there then they would continue to go on serving their gods but you'll see each time that this happens there was peace in the land all right verse 12 and the children of Israel did Evil again after those eight years in the sight of the Lord and the Lord strengthened agon the king of Moab against Israel because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord and He gathered unto him the children of Amron and AMC and went and smote Israel and possessed the city of palm trees and so the children of Israel serve agon the king of Moab 18 years but when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord the Lord raised them up a deliverer e Ehud the son of G Gira a benjamite a a man left-handed and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto igog the king of Moab okay and we're not going to read it all you got time you can read it but um God used this second judge to deliver Israel again and verse 28 and he said unto them follow after me for the Lord have delivered your enemies the moabites into your hand and they went down after him and took the fors of Jordan toward Moab and suffered not a man to pass over and they slew um and they slew of Moab at that time about 10,000 men all Lusty and all men of valure and and their escape not a man so Moab subdued that day under uh was subdued that day under the hand of Israel and the land had rest 80 years and after that was shamgar the son of anith which slew of the Philistines 600 men with an ox gold and he also delivered Israel now that's all we know about this man there is nothing else written about this man we're going to talk about this man in a minute but I like to talk about our spiritual battle turn with me if you would to the book of First Peter chapter 5 1 Peter chapter 5: 7 how many believes you're in a battle amen casting all your care upon him for he carth for you now what do we have to do we have to be sober we have to be vigilant because our adversary the Devil is a Roy lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the fath knowing that the same things that are going on in your life is going on with other people in the church not only in the church but around the world so we in order to be sober to be vigilant you literally have to be yielding to God you cannot be yielding yourself to just any old L doy whatever comes to your mind because the devil is looking for the person who's not yielding to God to devour them to take them in a snare he's looking for the weak he's looking for those who are not in the battle he's looking for those who simply just doing their own will if you're a human being with a good understanding of the scripture when you get up tomorrow morning you're not going to want your flesh is not going to want to do God's will and you're going to have to do something to make sure that thing is under subjection because this is the battle that we're in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 11 now what are our instructions our instructions here are to put on the whole armor of God that we may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil okay we're not watching some uh colorful entertaining story in the Old Testament that is just giving us an understanding of what's really happening in in this new testament for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places we must come to grips that we are all battling these Spirits the more that we can recognize it that's right the quicker we can gain Victory because it's these spirits that are trying to get us to LA to relax in Leo DEA to take it easy to feel like I'm in need of nothing to not feel this I need to fear the lord just just keep doing what I'm doing and it should be good enough look I believe believe that as you all agree with me that God allows things to happen in our life because we make wrong decisions now this happens to me a lot you go to do something and it didn't work out the way you want to and then you Tred to do and then it don't work and you try to do this and you got to step back and say Lord did I miss you somewhere am I in your will are you trying to tell me something because as much as we're end time message Believers it doesn't mean everything that we're doing everything we're saying every place we're walking that that God is prospering our way it's a battle out there and I don't want to be the one that's causing the problem I've got to be honest with myself am I Ying myself to the Lord or am I just Ying to what I think the Lord wants me to do all right for we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but against Spirits wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand now we're not going to go ahead and read the rest of this chapter but you know about the whole armor of God you've got to yield your life to put on the whole armor of God you can't just get up and you know go on with the day do a couple little prayers forget to put the armor on you've got to yield because the devil would like nothing better for you to get up and just you know take care of your important things tomorrow just take care of them he he just don't want you to put the armor run he don't want you to be sober he don't want you to be vigilant he wants you to think that you know God has just ordained every step that you're taking and it doesn't matter what you're doing God's going to be with you no matter what when I look at my life I I have to say I I I wish my steps were more pleasing to the Lord you know just being honest with myself I mean you you can't go hardly 10 minutes and you're thinking was that thought of the Lord Lord forgive me for that thought for even letting it stay there two seconds all right 2 Corinthians chapter 10:3 2 Corinthians chapter 10:3 for though we walk in this flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare they're not carnal but they're Mighty through god notice it's through God to the powing down of the stronghold so where is it happening in our mind see we may be able to control our body from doing certain things but we can still let our mind go there casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the word of God the knowledge of God and bring into captivity every thought what to The Obedience of Christ this takes a humility and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled so we see right here that this is exactly what God required in the Old Testament with Israel that they had to become they had to Humble themselves they had to cry out to God they had to say God help me I will follow you and then God sent a deliver God delivered them and God blessed them until they decided to start doing their own doings again and it was a repution you see it happening year after year we are in that same battle we are in that same battle day after day after day week after week month after month the devil's trying to get us away from obeying at least a part of the word and he's got us soaked in with a well you know as as as long as this and this and this you should be okay but what about go he out what about spend some time living for others what about the other parts see all right James chapter 4 James chapter 4 verse 5 do you do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in US it lusteth to do its own thing but he giveth more grace wherefore he sayith God resists the proud but he gives Grace unto the humble God never came down and delivered Israel until they humbled themselves and said God I need you so he says here in verse 7 submit yourself therefore to God in other words yield Your Vessel to God and resist the devil and he will flee from you now I want to know how often do we re recogniz the devil how often do we recognize him to even resist him because when he came to Eve he never said I am evil and I want to present to you to do your [Applause] will no he came the other way God does know everything's going to be okay you're GNA be just like him if you just do what you want to do so I wonder how often we really recognize the enemy in our life so submit your will to God Submit Your Vessel to God resist the devil and you know what he'll flee from you you got to you got to deliver that's god with you he's the judge that he has sent the word will judge the enemy after we submit to God but we got to submit draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye Sinners purify your hearts ye double-minded be afflicted mourn weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up now we all want that we all want that and we know how it happens it happens not when we hear our favorite song our favorite preacher it's when we choose to Humble ourselves and say Lord sorry if I have not been pleasing you 1 Peter 55 says likewise ye younger submit yourselves to the Elder y all be subject uh yay all of you be subject one to another be clothed with humility for God resists the proud he gives grace to the humble verse 6 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time now what is he exalting you what is he exalting you uh to he's exalting you above your enemy right now we are our greatest enemy and he exalts us above that by one easy path humility how humble can we be if we're always thinking that we're never wrong how humble can we be you know it's a it's Pride I'd rather say I'm wrong I believe I'm wrong and not be wrong you understand you turn over every Rock make sure because there's a spiritual battle going on and we we see in the scriptures clearly how the Lord delivers it's through humility and we all got situations going on our life and I'll tell you some of the trials I've been through I got to sit back and I'll be honest with you I have to ask this question Lord was that me that made that decision because it was wrong at the time it looked like the right one for three months I made these light fixtures they're going to I'm going to make them work well maybe it wasn't the Lord's will they're lessons things are lessons take time to pray Lord are you in this I know i' I've already buried myself in this situation for a month a year five years whatever it would be but Lord I want to know now Lord where do you want me to be right now it takes that realness between you and God not you and your family this is an individual what God deals with Gentiles individually God may be dealing with you something totally different than he's dealing with your spouse so it requires the same thing from all of us search me Lord now if you feel like you don't got any battles then maybe this message isn't for you but maybe what you could do is you could take this message and help somebody with it there was a a judge he was the third judge and his name was shamgar and what was so uh special about this man um that in one sense he seemed to be so insignificant that there was only one verse to scripture written about him there was nothing else written about him it was just he delivered but I'll say it like this he yielded his vessel to God you just if we take out the important parts that are so obvious he definitely was not a man that just made a league with the world his League was with God he stayed with God he yielded himself to God and God used him in a mighty way and you notice he didn't build more tanks he had an ax gold now how brother Brandon describes this situation this Ox gold was a a a a rod with a piece of H brass on the on the end of it that you prob you proded the the ox to keep going and that's all he had now as he tells the story he he refers to the same thing that happened to Gideon he was in the barn and he was just a very humble man and and he just wanted enough food to to take care of of of his family and um the the Philistines would come in and after the Harvest after all the work is done they would just go in destroy the uh Israel and take the food now we don't see that written about him but the prophets saw it and he typed it with uh Gideon about 90 years later I think about that but this thing probably was going on for a while because they were dwelling with their enemy and just going on and on but notice the main thing was this man was a h investor to God and God kept his Covenant with him and he didn't need to have a whole support system it was just him it was just one man taking care of 600 men is it 600 men or 6,000 600 one man sometimes we're afraid to tackle one problem and he just used what he had he didn't have a whole lot he didn't have the whole Army of Israel behind him he couldn't call 91 one but he had a league with God he had a covenant with God and I'll tell you it doesn't matter what's happening in our church it doesn't matter what's happening in our homes it don't matter what's happening in the world we have a a a covenant with God alone if you go into Rapture it's because of your relationship with God no matter what talent you have we often feel like we ain't got much of a talent and I'm okay with that I'm okay you know if God didn't want to give you know me a talent that that could sing like a lot of the singers out there I'm okay with that look what the look with the people in the world that have a talent to sing and they're they're using it for the devil they're using it for themselves to get Glory to get money to get whatever I'm okay that I'm not talented that doesn't stop God from seeing me through use what you have shamard didn't go next door and grab some other tools just use what he had and he got the job done and I'll tell you you're your love for God your your prayer prayers your prayers your faith in God they can deliver the church praise God they can do they can do Mighty things in this church the Bible says the prayer of faith shall save the sick if God be for us who can be against us see it's keeping that personal relationship that personal Covenant with God that personal league with God and not allowing yourself to get involved D in your will because your will is going to take you further away from God and here's the thing the devil knows how to present to you something that looks so much like God I'm going to take for for instance I grew up and my dad was a a a business he he had a business and he didn't he went to a like a Catholic church and we went there on the holidays and that and so I really didn't know about God and brother Ron I think might have worked for my dad okay and so um my dad was uh he ran that business the best that he he could he could and uh I tell you he had me working on Labor Day and everybody had Labor Day off right and I'm just a kid and I'm working there say why are we working on a labor day he says it's Labor Day you work on Labor Day so I said okay Dad so I'm working working working away on Labor Day but he worked all crazy hours he was considered a workaholic and and and he worked Sundays of course because there was nothing there to teach him any different and I didn't know I I mean I did my own thing on Sundays we certainly didn't go to church and you know try to put God first so I told my wife as a a for sure thing I will never have a business you don't ever have to worry I am so against having a business but you know what happened it wasn't even my idea it was God's idea right the neat thing about it is I still walk there knowing it's not mine I still walk there walking into his place but I made a decision I'm going to put work where work's at and I'm going to put my family where my family needs to be and I'm going to put God where God needs to be of course I want God in all of them but you understand decisions have to be made are you going to work Sunday are you going to make let your men work Sunday are you going to are you going to stay up so late um the day before church you're going to be tired now during all this time at the beginning there was there was nothing inside of me I never talked to my wife about you know maybe someday I'm G to like be a preacher we never we never had that conversation you never heard those words come out of my mouth it was just not a part of me but I wanted to be faithful to what God gave me amen because he's proven me whether I'm still going to put him first while I have that and what am I going to do with my extra time I I tell you when I was growing up and I was starting to come in I mean you had all these different leagues of baseball and hockey and all these different things you could do and I'll tell you I love doing all sports not good any but I love them I love them and I tell you I I I with my kids I I could have took them all to um all the sports made a decision not going to do that I I know I may not get liked by them when I'm older when they're older if they do come into the light they'll appreciate it they'll see it then but yeah I could have took them to all different sports I don't want to make a league with the world and God's you know no matter where we're at in our age where we're at with our walk with the Lord God is still proving us he's still proven us he wants to see whether we're going to stay with him keep him first and I'll tell you here's the blessing of keeping him first you'll be able to destroy your enemy but if we don't keep him first we will not be able to stand before our enemy he will overtake us he will he will Cloud us over with not the ability to walk with the joy of the Lord to have the freedom of the spirit to be that feel set free from things and I'm not saying that anything that's happening to anybody is because of your mistake I would never say that I got to ask the Lord all the time but myself who am I to judge anybody else but this message is for us to to check to Humble ourselves and to ask God am I uning every everything to you am my because the promise is if we seek God first all the things will be added and the enemy will not be able to stand in our way I I feel if we can be faithful with what God's given us in our personal life then God can use us with other things amen let's Stand Together God bless you so use what God given you don't worry about I'm not real gifted it doesn't matter use what you got God God is he's the Difference Maker he's the Difference Maker when I think when I think about the spirit of the Lord in our church it isn't because we got a great preacher and I'll just say this with the permission of my wife it is it because we've got you know the most amazing piano player see we say Amen but I do believe with all my heart God makes up the difference that's right and that's all that matters is that God makes up the difference whatever we're lacking he makes up the difference he'll take your o g and he'll go destroy 600 of your enemies because you're staying with the Lord you're staying with him you're staying with the scriptures amen let's bow our our hearts in a word of prayer before we worship Heavenly Father we thank you for the truths that are contained in the scriptures and Lord we it's our desire that we always find ourselves in the scriptures and Lord we're so grateful that we do belong to you that we are your children that you have predestinated us that we are in the palm of your hands that no man can take us out that you'll see us through you've given us such promises that if we just love you and we work according to your purpose like the prophet said you'll take even our mistakes and make Stepping Stones you're so good to us father we want to thank you for your goodness today your goodness in all of our lives here your goodness in all the lives that those that are live streaming right now that that have their their heads bowed they're praying God we want to thank you from the bottom of our heart for your riches towards us Lord your faithfulness to your word that when we've cried out to you that you've always delivered and God your word declares you are our deliverer we need you to deliver us even this day Lord I pray that you'd help us with this message you'd help us to to investigate to see Lord if there's something that we're not quite yielding to you that we should be and if there's certain things that we're yielding the other direction that we shouldn't be Lord we're asking for your help we're asking for your your grace father please bless each one of us for lord it's our hearts desire that we all be ready that morning when the Rapture takes place that nothing is standing in the way Lord as you're trying to prove us Lord let us be found faithful to you bless each brother bless each as whatever questions and anything that they're dealing with Lord I pray Lord that you would help them you may not give them the answer but Lord I do pray father that you would bless them to use everything that they have to defeat the enemy that comes against them and that you'd make up the difference Lord we thank you Heavenly Father we love you we commit Our Lives to you we commit this church to you we thank you for this precious time now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen I believe God's going to see us through amen um let's sing um I love him better every [Music] day I love him better every day I love him better
