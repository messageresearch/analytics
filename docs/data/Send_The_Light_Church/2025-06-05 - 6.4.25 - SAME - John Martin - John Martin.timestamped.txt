[29:46] Ian. God bless everybody.
[29:49] Um, I am lo and behold once again
[29:52] nervous. So please pray for me.
[29:56] Um, this song is something
[29:58] that just kind of came on my heart
[30:01] earlier today as I was driving and I get
[30:06] I'm a tend to be sort of a deep thinker
[30:08] and I I just got to thinking about all
[30:12] the the trials that we go through and
[30:14] the things that we face and
[30:17] um I I got to thinking about some of the
[30:21] hardest things that that I've faced in
[30:22] my life and as I as I thought about the
[30:27] time that I went through the trial and
[30:29] the things that I was facing and how
[30:33] hard it felt and it was just pain and
[30:38] sorrow and just you name it. And but
[30:41] then I began to look at who I am today
[30:42] and I'm a completely different person
[30:45] because of the trials I went through.
[30:48] And I just began to to thank the Lord
[30:51] right there in my car because I felt
[30:52] like the whole purpose God sends us
[30:55] these these things we go through is to
[30:56] shape us, to mold us, and to get us
[30:59] ready for rapture. And it, you know, as
[31:02] brother Ron was just saying, it hurts.
[31:04] It hurts to be cut. It hurts to be
[31:06] shaped. And
[31:08] um but there's there's something that
[31:11] only a trial can bring out of you.
[31:13] There's a strength that only a trial can
[31:15] bring.
[31:17] So, I just I I wanted to sing this
[31:20] tonight just because
[31:22] I I'm so thankful that no matter what I
[31:26] have faced, the anchor holds me.
[31:31] I have
[31:36] journeyed through the long dark
[31:41] night out on the open
[31:49] sea. By faith
[31:55] alone, sight
[31:57] [Music]
[32:00] unknown. And yet his
[32:03] eye was watching me.
[32:09] And the anchor
[32:12] [Music]
[32:14] holds. Though the ship is
[32:19] battered, the anchor
[32:25] holds though the
[32:27] sails are torn.
[32:32] I have
[32:35] fallen on my
[32:38] knees. As I
[32:41] face the raging
[32:45] sea, the anchor
[32:49] holds in spite of the storm.
[32:56] I've had
[32:59] visions and I've had
[33:02] [Music]
[33:04] dreams. I've even held
[33:07] them in my hand.
[33:13] But I never
[33:16] knew they could slip right
[33:20] [Music]
[33:22] through like they were
[33:25] only drains of
[33:30] sand. But the anchor
[33:34] holes though the ship is better.
[33:41] The anchor
[33:45] holds though the
[33:47] sails are
[33:51] torn. I have
[33:54] fallen on my
[33:58] knees as I
[34:00] face the raging
[34:04] seas. But the anchor
[34:09] holds in spite of the
[34:12] [Music]
[34:14] storm. Well, I have been
[34:18] young, but I am older
[34:23] now. There has been
[34:26] beauty these eyes have seen.
[34:33] But it was in the
[34:35] [Music]
[34:36] night through the storms of my
[34:41] [Music]
[34:43] life. That's where God
[34:46] proved his love to
[34:51] me. And the anchor
[34:56] holds. Though the ship is
[35:02] better, the anchor
[35:08] holds. Though the
[35:10] sails are
[35:14] torn, will I have
[35:17] fallen to my
[35:21] knees as I
[35:23] face the raging
[35:27] sea, but the anchor
[35:32] holds in spite of the storm.
[35:38] The anchor
[35:42] holds. Though the ship is
[35:48] better, the anchor
[35:51] [Music]
[35:53] holds. Though the
[35:55] sails are
[35:59] torn, will I have
[36:03] fallen through my
[36:07] knees as I
[36:09] face the raging
[36:13] seas, but the anchor
[36:19] holds in spite of the storm.
[36:26] [Applause]

[36:41] a a short chorus here. Come and dine.

[38:39] die. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[38:44] I am thankful that if he could
[38:49] feed 5,000 with
[38:52] just one boy's
[38:55] lunch, I believe God can feed us with
[38:57] one scripture. Amen. Amen. He's able to
[39:02] do exceedingly above what we could think
[39:06] of him being able to
[39:08] do. I want to greet you today in the
[39:11] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. is good
[39:12] to be in the house of the Lord today.
[39:14] How's the temperature going for
[39:19] everybody and not too
[39:21] cold? Not too hot. Don't tell me you're
[39:24] lukewarm. Not allowed to have that in
[39:27] church. Amen. I did want to uh made a a
[39:31] very sad announcement. Um we all
[39:34] remember brother Joseph Benami.
[39:38] He had passed away at the beginning of
[39:41] May and they had a funeral for him just
[39:43] this last Saturday. Gone on to be with
[39:47] the Lord. And so if we could just
[39:50] remember to pray for the family, a very
[39:53] very sad
[39:55] uh
[39:56] situation. I don't have all the details,
[39:58] but enough to know that the families
[40:02] hurt and
[40:04] hurting and uh they what a hard time to
[40:09] trust the
[40:10] Lord.
[40:11] Um so we want to remember we want to
[40:16] remember the family in prayer. Amen. And
[40:20] if you have your Bibles this evening,
[40:23] turn with us if you would to the book of
[40:25] Hebrews, chapter
[40:31] 13. Hebrews chapter
[40:34] 13. And we're going to begin reading
[40:36] with verse number
[40:38] uh five through 8. Hebrews 5 through8.
[40:48] So thankful that we have the solid rock.
[40:53] We don't know what's going to happen in
[40:56] this life,
[40:57] but we can hold to God's unchanging
[41:00] hand.
[41:02] Amen. Let's begin reading here and then
[41:04] we'll have a word of prayer. Let your
[41:08] conversation be without
[41:10] covetousness and be content with such
[41:13] things as you have. For he hath said, I
[41:18] will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
[41:21] It just doesn't matter if we got a
[41:24] dollar or what. God is going to be with
[41:27] us.
[41:29] So that we may boldly
[41:31] say, "The Lord is my
[41:34] helper. I will not fear what man shall
[41:37] do unto me." Amen.
[41:40] Remember them which have the rule over
[41:42] you, who have spoken unto you the word
[41:44] of God, whose faith
[41:47] follow. Consider the end of their
[41:50] conversation. Jesus Christ is the same
[41:53] yesterday, today, and forever. Let's bow
[41:57] a word of prayer. our heavenly
[41:59] father. Lord, thank you
[42:02] when everything
[42:06] goes wrong and in every direction and
[42:10] what we anticipate and we just can't we
[42:15] can't count on anything. Even when
[42:18] they're telling us what the weather is
[42:20] having right now, sometimes it can even
[42:23] be different than
[42:25] that. But Lord, one thing is for sure.
[42:28] You are the same yesterday, today, and
[42:30] forever. And we're thankful that we can
[42:33] what we all hear have an
[42:36] anchor that holds within the veil. And
[42:40] Lord, we heard that song today. The
[42:42] anchor
[42:45] holds. Lord, you are our anchor. Your
[42:49] word is our absolute.
[42:52] And Lord, we want to learn to depend
[42:55] upon that a little bit more. So I pray
[42:58] today that Lord you would take all of
[43:02] our lives, forgive us of any sins that
[43:05] we have committed that anything that
[43:08] would stand in the way of you moving in
[43:10] our behalf.
[43:13] Lord, that you would help us of our
[43:16] unbelief and that you would get a hold
[43:18] of our minds and our hearts through the
[43:20] ministry of the word today that we might
[43:22] walk away from here closer to you than
[43:25] when we came. Pray that our our minds,
[43:28] our thoughts could just be completely
[43:31] open now to your word and give us the
[43:34] revelation as we dive into the
[43:36] scriptures today. Come and be not only
[43:40] the unseen guests, but I pray that each
[43:43] one of us, it doesn't matter the age,
[43:45] how young we are, how old we are, come
[43:48] and meet with us right where we're
[43:50] standing, right where we're sitting.
[43:52] Lord, meet with us. be real to us
[43:56] through the opening of the word. Now we
[43:57] pray these things in Jesus Christ's
[43:59] name. Amen. And God bless you. May be
[44:03] seated. We want to entitle this message
[44:08] same s. and for a subject faithfulness.
[44:15] And in our scriptures
[44:18] today, God wants us to
[44:20] learn to be content because he's with
[44:24] us.
[44:27] Once we think God is not with us, then
[44:30] we're going after whatever we
[44:33] want. And God is our
[44:36] portion. He will supply every need.
[44:40] according to his riches and glory. The
[44:42] Bible tells us
[44:45] and he wants us to boldly say, "The Lord
[44:49] is my helper and I will not fear what
[44:52] man shall do unto me." Know there are
[44:55] times that we get scared, but the Lord
[44:58] said, "I'll never leave you. I'll never
[45:00] forsake you." That he will help us
[45:02] through every situation.
[45:04] And then it says, 'Re
[45:07] them which have the rule over you. So I
[45:10] can say to you children, remember your
[45:14] parents. To your parents, remember the
[45:17] office that God's given you. I'll say to
[45:20] the pastor,
[45:23] remember the Lord Jesus
[45:26] Christ. We have a a prophet. We have the
[45:29] the word of God. and Paul, we have these
[45:33] examples and the Bible is admonishing,
[45:36] remember them which have the rule over
[45:40] you. So, we all have somebody over us.
[45:45] Every single one of us. If we don't,
[45:48] we're lawless. That's true. Remember
[45:51] them which have the rule over you, who
[45:52] have spoken unto the word of God. Now,
[45:54] what are we supposed to do?
[45:57] Consider whose Okay. whose faith follow
[46:00] consider the end of their conversation.
[46:04] Now that word conversation means
[46:08] behavior their their behavior not the at
[46:12] the end of the words. Now remember their
[46:15] behavior is the end of their behavior
[46:18] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[46:20] today and forever. Is it the same as
[46:23] God? Is it the same as Jesus? Our
[46:26] behavior reveals and unveils our faith,
[46:29] what we believe in. Not our words, not
[46:31] our talking, not our testimony, but our
[46:34] behavior. The very conversation of our
[46:36] life that we're living, it really
[46:39] unveils who we are. Amen. And it's
[46:42] either speaking that Jesus Christ is
[46:44] alive today, he's living today, he is
[46:47] the same today, or it's it's something
[46:52] in the past.
[46:55] The Bible tells us that we are uh
[46:59] epistles. Uh Paul Paul said, "Ye are our
[47:02] epistles written in our hearts, known
[47:04] and read of all men." Amen.
[47:09] So people can look to see what we really
[47:13] are. Yes.
[47:15] Consider that means look again. Behold,
[47:19] consider Jesus Christ is the same
[47:22] yesterday, today, and forever. Now, if
[47:25] Jesus Christ is living inside of you, he
[47:28] will be the same to you. He will be the
[47:32] same in your life because he's living in
[47:34] you. He's not going to act different in
[47:37] you. It's going to be the same. So what
[47:40] we want to do in the service today is we
[47:42] want to provoke our our lives to be just
[47:47] like Christ.
[47:50] So yeah, part of it we got to take
[47:52] inventory. But I'll say it like this.
[47:54] How many's got Jesus Christ living in
[47:56] your life?
[47:58] Okay, that means he's going to act the
[48:00] same way.
[48:02] He's not going to act different inside
[48:05] of anybody.
[48:07] If he's inside, he's got the
[48:08] preeminence, he's going to act the same.
[48:10] Now, the problem comes is when we don't
[48:12] yield ourselves to God and then we
[48:15] become we we begin acting a little bit
[48:18] different.
[48:22] But the very message of the hour that
[48:24] the prophet brought the the the the
[48:27] title of his message was Jesus Christ is
[48:30] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[48:32] That God is the same as he was when he
[48:34] walked the shores of Galilee. Amen. that
[48:36] he's still alive living in his people.
[48:38] So I don't care if it's Sunday, Monday,
[48:41] or Tuesday, he's the same inside of you.
[48:45] Turn with me if you would to John
[48:49] 14:8. John 14:8. Philip saith unto him,
[48:53] Lord, show us the Father and it will
[48:57] suffice us.
[48:59] And Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so
[49:01] long a time with you? And yet, excuse
[49:05] me, and yet hast thou not known
[49:07] me,
[49:09] Phillip, he that have seen me hath seen
[49:13] the father. How sayest thou then, show
[49:16] us the father. So here Jesus is saying
[49:18] Jesus and the father are the same.
[49:21] Right? That's what's being expressed
[49:23] here. Believest thou not that I am in
[49:25] the father and the father in me. The
[49:27] words that I speak unto you speak not of
[49:29] myself, but the father that dwelleth in
[49:31] me, he doeth the
[49:33] works. He's doing the act, the deeds,
[49:36] the toil. Believe me, I am in the father
[49:39] and the father in me. Or else believe me
[49:41] for the very works sake.
[49:47] In other words, consider the end of the
[49:49] conversation, the end of the behavior,
[49:51] the end of their life, the life that
[49:52] they're living. Look at that. Consider
[49:54] it and see. If you don't believe the
[49:57] words, believe the life.
[50:04] Jesus is saying the father is living
[50:06] inside of him that and that is causing
[50:09] Jesus to live the very same life.
[50:13] And he says the same thing will happen
[50:16] to
[50:18] us when we have the spirit of Christ
[50:21] inside of us.
[50:23] It ain't going to be any different than
[50:25] when the the father was in Jesus. It
[50:29] ain't going to be any different than
[50:30] when Jesus is in us. Right?
[50:33] So look at this verse 12. Verily, verily
[50:35] I say unto you, he that believeth on
[50:37] me, the works that I do shall he do
[50:41] also, and greater works than these shall
[50:44] he do, because I go to my father. More
[50:47] works. He this he spoke this at age 33.
[50:51] Look, we're most of us are older than 33
[50:53] or at least some of us are older than
[50:58] 33. So, we have more time to do more
[51:02] works, to have more end of our
[51:04] conversation, to have more time to
[51:07] behave. Amen. And too often, here's what
[51:10] we are. We live in a world who the
[51:13] church world says it don't matter what
[51:15] life you live as long as you claim to be
[51:18] a Christian.
[51:21] But I'm so glad the Bible's telling me,
[51:24] consider the end of their conversation.
[51:27] Look at the end of their life because
[51:30] that's really telling who they are.
[51:33] If the end of their life is speaking
[51:35] that God, it's the same thing that the
[51:37] Bible that that happened to Jesus in the
[51:40] Bible is the same thing that's happening
[51:42] in their life, then we can have
[51:44] confidence in that.
[51:47] Then we can follow them as they follow
[51:49] God. Right? Paul said, "Follow me as I
[51:52] follow Christ." Amen.
[51:56] But if the but if their behavior isn't
[51:59] according to the
[52:00] scriptures, then don't follow.
[52:05] I'll tell you why. The devils
[52:08] believe. Didn't know Jesus said he he
[52:12] that believeth on me, the works I do
[52:14] shall eat you also. Well, the devils
[52:16] believe
[52:18] that the devils believe with such a high
[52:20] degree of belief that it actually causes
[52:23] them to tremble.
[52:26] So they
[52:27] believe yet they do not the works of
[52:30] Christ. So this belief is
[52:34] different. I just wonder how many actual
[52:37] believers or so professing Christians
[52:41] have this same type of
[52:43] belief. the same type of belief system
[52:46] and they call it faith believing without
[52:49] the works of Christ. Are you with me?
[52:52] Jesus said, "He that believeth on me,
[52:54] the works that I do shall he do also."
[52:57] And the demons aren't doing it.
[53:00] They have such a higher degree of
[53:02] believing than a lot of professing
[53:04] believers. How do you know that, Brother
[53:06] John? Because at least the demons
[53:08] tremble.
[53:11] Think about that. A lot of people, they
[53:13] don't even they don't even tremble at
[53:15] the word. Amen.
[53:19] The demons even tremble when the weakest
[53:21] Christian gets on his knees.
[53:27] There are too many professing believers
[53:29] who are too proud to tremble.
[53:33] Isaiah 66:1 says, "Thus sayeth the Lord,
[53:36] the heaven is my throne, the earth is my
[53:39] foottool.
[53:41] Where is the house that you will build
[53:43] unto me? Where is the place of my rest?
[53:46] So God God is looking. What are you
[53:50] going to build for me to live
[53:54] in? For all these things have my hand
[53:57] made. That's right. And all those things
[54:00] have have been have been, sayeth the
[54:03] Lord. But to this man will I look even
[54:06] to him that is poor and of a contrite
[54:09] spirit. And what trembleth at my word?
[54:13] Amen. That's the person I want to live
[54:16] inside.
[54:17] I want to live inside the person that
[54:20] trembles at my word. Not one that could
[54:22] just profess what he wants to profess.
[54:25] Act like he wants to
[54:29] act. Doesn't has a proud spirit. God
[54:32] resists the proud. Right. Look, I think
[54:35] if we really want God to live more
[54:37] inside of us, we got to learn to have
[54:39] the type of spirit that he's looking
[54:41] for.
[54:43] This is not someone who per periodically
[54:46] gets
[54:47] contrite. This is not someone whose spir
[54:50] whose spirit kind of shows up up and
[54:52] down and in and out and sometimes
[54:55] they're humble and sometimes they're
[54:57] proud. We're talking about being the
[55:00] same yesterday, today, and forever. God
[55:03] is looking for some stability in our
[55:05] lives. Not just saying, "Do what we
[55:08] want, say, I'm sorry," and then keep
[55:10] doing what you want to do. God is
[55:12] looking for faithfulness.
[55:14] It ain't going to h we're not going to
[55:16] be gifted that. It's a choice you make
[55:19] in your heart, in your mind every single
[55:21] day. Amen.
[55:26] God is looking for a man
[55:31] that is not up and down to rest
[55:33] in. I'm telling you, if you're going to
[55:36] take a a
[55:38] a plane, let's say you're going to take
[55:40] a plane and you can get on a plane
[55:43] that's going to go like this and get you
[55:45] there, or you're going to get on a plane
[55:46] that's going to take off and
[55:48] just Which one do you want to get on?
[55:51] Brother Marty, which Brother Ron, which
[55:54] boat do you want to get on when you're
[55:56] out in the ocean? You want to get one
[55:57] that's like this or one like this? God
[56:01] isn't interested in living in somebody
[56:04] who's like this.
[56:07] He wants some stability to live in.
[56:10] Someone who's made up their mind.
[56:14] I'm going to stay with it. I'm going to
[56:16] be the same when I wake up. Thursday
[56:19] morning I'm going to be just like it was
[56:20] Wednesday night.
[56:23] That's what God is looking for.
[56:26] Jesus said, "He that believeth on me,
[56:28] the works I do shall heed you
[56:31] also." This belief is trusting in the
[56:35] word of God. The word of God has to be
[56:38] our absolute. It's not what we think.
[56:41] It's not how we're feeling. It's the
[56:44] word has to be the absolute. One that
[56:46] trembleth at the word of God, one that
[56:50] is poor and contrite in spirit. Brother
[56:53] Brandham said in the message spiritual
[56:55] food in due season, he said, "So is it
[56:58] today, friends, so is it today that the
[57:02] bread of life that the children eat on
[57:05] follows the message of God to sustain
[57:08] them during the time of the drought."
[57:11] Now, what if he stood in our presence
[57:15] today? What if he stood in our presence
[57:18] right now? Would he act and do? He would
[57:23] act and do just exactly like he did the
[57:27] days when he was here in the flesh here
[57:29] on the earth.
[57:31] And he says, "The bride is part of the
[57:35] husband. The church is the same as
[57:38] Christ. the works I do shall he do also.
[57:43] And it is the word that done it. He told
[57:46] us that the things that that he did,
[57:48] that is what we do also. I'm just going
[57:52] to say it like this. Forget about trying
[57:54] to say I'm a Christian and start looking
[57:57] at living like a Christian. Look,
[58:00] because that's what everybody else looks
[58:02] at. They're not looking at your words,
[58:04] right?
[58:06] I'm sorry if if if there is something if
[58:09] there is a person who's uh you may be
[58:11] able to fool some of the people some of
[58:13] the time but you can't fool a a real
[58:15] bornag again Christian
[58:20] look you you you can't keep living an up
[58:23] and down life and saying you're you're
[58:26] serving God
[58:30] you got to make up your
[58:32] mind am I going to do the works of
[58:34] Christ or am I not?
[58:43] Baptism doesn't save us.
[58:52] I believe God is calling us to be
[58:55] faithful. I really do. I believe I
[58:58] believe that with all my heart. Turn
[58:59] with me if you would to Matthew 25:14.
[59:02] for the kingdom of
[59:05] heaven. Uh this is just a parable and
[59:08] we're not going to get I can just tell
[59:10] you right now starting off we're not
[59:11] going to get through all the
[59:13] scriptures but we can go a little
[59:17] extra but not too much
[59:21] extra. For the kingdom of heaven is as a
[59:24] man traveling to a far country who
[59:26] called his own servants and delivered
[59:28] unto them his goods. Unto one he gave
[59:31] five talents, to another two, to another
[59:33] one. To every man according to his
[59:35] several ability, and straightway took
[59:37] his journey. I remember when I was in
[59:40] high school, there was there was some of
[59:42] the kids, they were like so talented,
[59:46] and then there were some that didn't
[59:47] have any talent, it seemed. And then,
[59:50] you know what I'm talking about? And
[59:52] then there were some that were in
[59:53] between. And like they all had different
[59:56] abilities.
[59:57] Amen. This is what what the Lord's
[1:00:00] saying right here. He's given all of us
[1:00:03] a different ability, but according to
[1:00:05] the ability he's given to us, he expects
[1:00:08] to receive from that. Amen. Then he that
[1:00:11] had received five talents went and
[1:00:13] traded the same and made them other five
[1:00:16] talents. Now, there's a a a parable in
[1:00:20] the book of Luke that's similar to this,
[1:00:22] but there's it's 10 servants who all
[1:00:25] received one pound each, and they were
[1:00:27] instructed to occupy till he came back.
[1:00:31] And some traded, and they received 10.
[1:00:34] They had one, and they received 10.
[1:00:36] Others, they had one, they received
[1:00:38] five. And one of them decided not to do
[1:00:41] any trading at all. He was scared that
[1:00:45] if he traded, he would lose. Can you
[1:00:47] imagine going into the stock market,
[1:00:50] right? And you you're going to put some
[1:00:52] money in a certain stock. There is a
[1:00:55] little bit of question there whether
[1:00:57] you're going to lose it. How many's lost
[1:00:59] money in in trading before? Yeah. We
[1:01:03] Yes. So, you know, it's possible to
[1:01:06] trade and lose, right? And and there are
[1:01:08] some believers who do not want to give
[1:01:10] up their life. They are afraid that
[1:01:13] they're going to lose it.
[1:01:18] instead of winning more souls.
[1:01:26] So if someone is going to trade, they
[1:01:28] have to give up something to get
[1:01:29] something.
[1:01:31] It's like trading in in in in in sports.
[1:01:35] you you sometimes trade a player in
[1:01:38] football or hockey for another player
[1:01:40] and they switch
[1:01:42] teams and sometimes they excel and
[1:01:45] sometimes it was like not worth trading.
[1:01:48] So you're taking a chance when you're
[1:01:50] trading. Amen. Always taking a chance.
[1:01:53] Okay, let's go back here to Matthew 25
[1:01:56] verse1 17. And likewise he that had
[1:01:58] received two, he also gained other two.
[1:02:02] But he that had received one went and
[1:02:04] digged into the earth and hid his lord's
[1:02:06] money. And after a long time the lord of
[1:02:09] those servants cometh, and he reckoned
[1:02:10] with them. And so he that had received
[1:02:13] five talents came and brought other five
[1:02:15] talents, saying, Lord, thou deliverest
[1:02:17] unto me five talents. Behold, I've
[1:02:19] gained beside them five talents more.
[1:02:22] Hallelujah. And his lord said unto him,
[1:02:25] Well done, thou good and faithful
[1:02:29] servant.
[1:02:32] Thou has been faithful over a few
[1:02:34] things. I will make thee ruler over many
[1:02:37] things. Enter thou into the joy of the
[1:02:41] Lord. Now
[1:02:44] notice, God is well
[1:02:47] pleased if you take what God has given
[1:02:50] you and get more.
[1:02:53] That is the truth for him.
[1:02:57] Because he's the one that gave us our
[1:02:59] talents. That's right. He's the one that
[1:03:00] gave us our life.
[1:03:04] And so he's looking for more.
[1:03:10] And if we give him more, then he says,
[1:03:13] "Well done.
[1:03:15] Well done." He says, "Good, thou good
[1:03:18] and faithful servant."
[1:03:22] Oh, is that
[1:03:24] beautiful? I want to associate the word
[1:03:27] good. How do I know I'm good? Jesus said
[1:03:31] there's none
[1:03:33] good. Paul said there's none good. I
[1:03:36] mean, now Jesus is calling this man,
[1:03:39] this servant good. What makes a man
[1:03:42] good? I want to associate this word good
[1:03:45] with a sincere
[1:03:48] heart. Why do I say that? Because there
[1:03:51] is a parable about the four heart
[1:03:53] conditions. And I just want to read a
[1:03:55] portion of that. And that's in Luke
[1:03:57] 18:14. If we want to put that up there.
[1:03:59] Luke 8 Luke
[1:04:01] 8:14. And this was one of the grounds of
[1:04:04] the heart. And that which fell among
[1:04:06] thorns are they which when they heard go
[1:04:09] forth and and are choked with the cares
[1:04:13] and riches and pleasures of this life
[1:04:15] and bring no fruit to perfection. So
[1:04:17] they had fruit at one time, but it
[1:04:19] doesn't go on to perfection. Verse 15.
[1:04:22] But that on the good ground are they
[1:04:25] which in honest and good heart, having
[1:04:31] heard the word, they keep it and bring
[1:04:34] forth with patience. So I want to
[1:04:37] associate that word good with just a
[1:04:41] good heart, a sincere heart. They're
[1:04:43] just honest.
[1:04:45] God does not look at us as as good and
[1:04:48] we just did dally do whatever we want to
[1:04:50] do and expect that we're going to be
[1:04:52] good.
[1:04:55] God wants to see us be sincere and we
[1:04:58] have a chance to do that every single
[1:04:59] day.
[1:05:04] Thou has been faithful over a few
[1:05:06] things. Now you might think a few things
[1:05:11] is what a few things is.
[1:05:15] Like a few things were like you could
[1:05:17] just pick up a few things at the house.
[1:05:20] You could just fix you could just do a
[1:05:21] few things off the honeydew list. A few
[1:05:24] things is looked at a few things. Take a
[1:05:26] few chairs out. We associate few with a
[1:05:30] few
[1:05:31] days,
[1:05:33] right? Few is is like three or a small
[1:05:37] number. But that's not what this word
[1:05:39] means. This word few things when Jesus
[1:05:42] is speaking it means a short
[1:05:47] while. For what is your life? Is it even
[1:05:50] a vapor that appearth for a little time
[1:05:53] and then vanishth away?
[1:05:56] God is looking at your life. The life
[1:05:58] that you have, it is it is just
[1:06:01] something that he's asked you to be
[1:06:03] faithful with. And it's nothing compared
[1:06:06] to eternity.
[1:06:10] So
[1:06:11] being the
[1:06:14] faithful is being the
[1:06:18] same. It's being the same. It It's being
[1:06:22] consistent, dependable, always with your
[1:06:27] entire life. It's no longer I'm just
[1:06:30] going to get baptized. I'm going to do a
[1:06:31] couple things. I'm going to just do
[1:06:32] this. I'm going to listen to this tape.
[1:06:34] And you know what? I'm going to do what
[1:06:35] I want to do. That is right. That is not
[1:06:38] faithful.
[1:06:39] Faithful is you have your life to live
[1:06:42] for God.
[1:06:46] Make a choice. Choose ye this day whom
[1:06:48] you're going to
[1:06:52] serve. Says, "How long will you halt
[1:06:54] between two opinions? How long will you
[1:06:57] consider what you want to do? If God be
[1:07:00] God, then serve him." Amen. And if he's
[1:07:05] not, then
[1:07:09] no. Well done, good and faithful
[1:07:13] servant. Thou has been
[1:07:15] faithful for a short
[1:07:18] while. Well done, sincere and being
[1:07:22] faithful with your life. We need to
[1:07:24] think about this. We need to meditate
[1:07:26] upon it. We need to make sure we're
[1:07:28] making it happen. Amen. All right.
[1:07:31] Matthew chap 25 verse 22 going back to
[1:07:34] this and he also and all he also that
[1:07:38] had received two talents came and said
[1:07:40] Lord thou delivers unto me two talents
[1:07:42] behold I've gained two other talents
[1:07:45] beside them and he said and his lord
[1:07:48] said unto him well done good and
[1:07:50] faithful servant well done good and
[1:07:52] faithful servant thou has been faithful
[1:07:54] over a few things I will make thee ruler
[1:07:56] over many enter thou into the joys of
[1:07:59] the Lord so it doesn't matter how many
[1:08:00] talents you
[1:08:02] It doesn't matter if you have two or
[1:08:04] 50. What matters is that you're faithful
[1:08:07] with your life.
[1:08:10] Then he which had received the one
[1:08:12] talent came and said,
[1:08:14] Lord, I knew that
[1:08:17] thou art a hard
[1:08:21] man. Now you understand
[1:08:24] that God is des Jesus is describing
[1:08:28] himself
[1:08:29] here. Thou art a hard
[1:08:33] man, reaping where thou hast not sown,
[1:08:37] and gathered where thou has not
[1:08:42] strawled. We all got to give an account
[1:08:45] for our lives.
[1:08:50] And I was afraid and went and hid thy
[1:08:53] talent in the earth. And lo, thou has
[1:08:56] that that is thine. I'm just giving it
[1:08:58] back to you. And God's looking at him
[1:09:00] says, "I gave you that life and you're
[1:09:02] not I gave you life and you're not going
[1:09:05] to give me anything more."
[1:09:10] And the Lord answered and said unto him,
[1:09:12] "Thou wicked and slothful servant.
[1:09:17] Slotful. Don't care. Do what you want to
[1:09:20] do.
[1:09:24] Thou kneest that I reap where I sold not
[1:09:27] and gathered where I did not straw.
[1:09:30] Look, if I gave
[1:09:36] um look any all of us that give our kids
[1:09:41] something, give something. Uh uh I'm not
[1:09:45] going to give all the men that that work
[1:09:47] for me at Trusted a paycheck if they're
[1:09:50] not going to work for me.
[1:09:52] It's just not going to happen. And I
[1:09:55] don't think brother Mike would end up
[1:09:58] staying there working for that place
[1:10:01] after a while if they didn't give him
[1:10:02] any money.
[1:10:05] And God is not going to just give you a
[1:10:06] life to do whatever you want to do with
[1:10:08] it and expect nothing in return.
[1:10:10] That's not his makeup.
[1:10:14] There is a reason that God gives us
[1:10:16] life. The Bible says all things were
[1:10:19] created by him and what? for him. Yes.
[1:10:23] And that God works all things after the
[1:10:25] counsel of what? His will. Well, it's
[1:10:28] his will that he gets all of his family
[1:10:31] saved. Amen. Right. It God in all things
[1:10:35] wants to have preeminence in the church.
[1:10:38] Amen. But you know, God will not cross
[1:10:40] free free will.
[1:10:45] And this one serv servant
[1:10:48] knew what God wanted him to
[1:10:51] produce, but he used his life for
[1:10:54] himself. So consider the end of this
[1:10:57] man's conversation. It was not the same
[1:10:59] yesterday, today, and forever. Was not
[1:11:01] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:11:03] and forever? And God said unto him,
[1:11:05] "Thou wicked and slothful servant."
[1:11:10] Man has a choice to do what he wants to
[1:11:12] do with his life. But at the end of the
[1:11:14] life, God has that that that God has
[1:11:17] given him. God is going to either say to
[1:11:20] him, "Well done, thou good and faithful
[1:11:22] servant." Or he's going to say, "Thou
[1:11:25] wicked and slothful servant."
[1:11:29] There's no in between. We're either
[1:11:32] doing God's will or we're not doing
[1:11:33] God's will. There's there's Well, you
[1:11:36] are neutral.
[1:11:39] There's no no neutral. It's in his will
[1:11:42] or not his will. 2 Corinthians 5:9. We
[1:11:45] want to step in here some more
[1:11:46] scripture. 2 Corinthians 5:9. Wherefore
[1:11:49] we labor. Wherefore we labor whether
[1:11:54] present or absent we may be accepted of
[1:12:00] him. How are we going to be accepted by
[1:12:03] God if we don't labor?
[1:12:06] For we must all appear before the
[1:12:09] judgment seat of Christ, that every one
[1:12:12] of us may receive of the things that
[1:12:14] we've done in his body, according they
[1:12:15] have done, whether it be good or bad. We
[1:12:18] just read the We just read this, right?
[1:12:21] Knowing therefore the terror of the
[1:12:23] Lord, we're not going to hide our
[1:12:27] gift, but we're going to persuade men.
[1:12:34] We persuade men, but we are man we are
[1:12:38] made manifest unto God. And I trust also
[1:12:41] are made manifest to your conscience.
[1:12:44] Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord
[1:12:46] that he is a hard man. He is expecting
[1:12:48] to reap something out of your life.
[1:12:52] And we've got to be willing to take our
[1:12:56] lives, lay it down for the
[1:12:59] Lord and and go win a soul. Bring
[1:13:02] somebody to Jesus. Let Jesus, you know,
[1:13:04] the way you can let God know you're
[1:13:06] thankful for salvation is bring somebody
[1:13:09] else in.
[1:13:12] That shows God you're thankful for
[1:13:13] salvation. Right there.
[1:13:17] Give your life to save somebody
[1:13:19] else. We've got to trade our
[1:13:22] time to to persuade souls to Jesus
[1:13:26] Christ. As many as possible. Yes, let's
[1:13:28] start with one. But I'll say, let's
[1:13:31] let's they that win souls is
[1:13:34] wise. God is working all things together
[1:13:39] for his eternal purpose. That's to get
[1:13:42] all of his family together. And and I
[1:13:44] just we we need to be working in harmony
[1:13:46] with
[1:13:47] that. God wants to reap the benefits of
[1:13:50] our lives for his eternal kingdom. So we
[1:13:52] need to be good. We need to be faithful.
[1:13:55] We need to be what? The same. the same
[1:13:58] same thing that Jesus did. We do. All
[1:14:01] right, going back now to where we were
[1:14:04] at in Matthew 25. We're going to just
[1:14:06] start with verse 26. And the Lord
[1:14:10] answered and said unto him, "Thou wicked
[1:14:13] and sorrowful servant, thou kneest I
[1:14:14] reap, where I sold not, and gathered
[1:14:16] where I I have not strolled. Thou
[1:14:19] oughtest therefore to have put my money
[1:14:21] to the exchanges, and then at my coming
[1:14:24] I should have received mine own with
[1:14:27] you. In other
[1:14:30] words, obey them that have the rule over
[1:14:37] you because they're trying to tell you
[1:14:40] what to
[1:14:42] do. Live for God. Win a soul for Jesus.
[1:14:46] True. consider the end of their
[1:14:53] conversation. I mean, I wouldn't want to
[1:14:54] go to a church where they're telling you
[1:14:56] it doesn't matter what you do.
[1:14:58] Hey, all we're here is have a good time.
[1:15:00] Let's have some music. Let's have some
[1:15:02] entertainment.
[1:15:03] Let's have some fun. Let's go out of
[1:15:04] here feeling good.
[1:15:07] That is not Jesus Christ the same
[1:15:08] yesterday, today, and
[1:15:12] forever. And here it is. Jesus is saying
[1:15:15] in this parable, "Thou oughtest
[1:15:18] therefore to have put my money to the
[1:15:21] exchangers, to those who are trying to
[1:15:24] tell you, trade, trade your life. Give
[1:15:27] up your your time to go win a soul.
[1:15:30] Don't go bury your life in your own
[1:15:33] ideas, your own your own will." And then
[1:15:36] at my coming, I should have received my
[1:15:38] own with us. In other words, I would
[1:15:40] have got something more out of it.
[1:15:43] Take therefore the talent from him, and
[1:15:45] give it unto him that had 10 talents.
[1:15:48] And for unto everyone that have shall be
[1:15:51] given, and he that have an abundance,
[1:15:54] and he shall have an abundance, but from
[1:15:56] him that have not shall be taken away
[1:15:59] even that which he had. Now think about
[1:16:01] that. Everybody that ends up going to
[1:16:05] hell, let's just say there's more people
[1:16:07] that goes to hell than heaven, right? We
[1:16:09] know
[1:16:10] that. So what was happen? What happened
[1:16:12] to them? It their life was taken away
[1:16:15] from
[1:16:18] them. He doesn't say to those that go to
[1:16:20] hell, enter into the joys of the
[1:16:25] Lord. You you had your chance. You
[1:16:27] didn't want to serve me. Okay, you're
[1:16:29] not serving me.
[1:16:31] But to those who made a choice, I want
[1:16:36] to live for
[1:16:37] God. I want my life to be pleasing to
[1:16:40] God.
[1:16:41] It's to those he says, "Enter in to the
[1:16:44] joy of the Lord
[1:16:48] and cast ye the unprofitable servant
[1:16:51] into outer darkness. There shall be
[1:16:52] weeping and nashing of teeth." We don't
[1:16:54] want to go through tribulation, do we
[1:16:57] not? We must remember that we are not
[1:17:01] only guests to the wedding supper that
[1:17:05] we've been called to, but we're
[1:17:06] servants.
[1:17:08] We're servants that have been given a
[1:17:11] responsibility to bring in and we got to
[1:17:14] give an account for our
[1:17:16] stewardship what we have gained by
[1:17:18] trading our time in our life to win
[1:17:20] another soul for God. Jesus said, "And
[1:17:23] behold, I come quickly and my reward is
[1:17:25] with me to give every man according to
[1:17:28] his work shall be. He that believeth on
[1:17:30] me, the works I do shall he do also."
[1:17:35] We need to consider the end of one
[1:17:37] another's
[1:17:39] conversation or one another's
[1:17:42] behavior. Jesus Christ the same
[1:17:44] yesterday, today, and
[1:17:47] forever. So, let's be the same.
[1:17:51] Some of us need to grow up and learn how
[1:17:53] to live a consistent
[1:17:56] life. Be the same person all the time.
[1:18:00] Don't be this way one way, this way
[1:18:03] another way. Be the same. Be dependable.
[1:18:06] Whoever you are, be that. Even brother
[1:18:08] Brandham said, "If you're going to be a
[1:18:10] bum, be the best bum you could
[1:18:14] be. Someone that people can rely
[1:18:20] on." You know, sometime, you know, there
[1:18:22] are people if you talk to them one day,
[1:18:25] they're nice. You talk to them again,
[1:18:26] they're going to bite your head off.
[1:18:30] that that is not the same. That's not
[1:18:33] what God's calling us
[1:18:35] to. If God is the same yesterday, today,
[1:18:38] and forever, we know it. Malachi 3:6
[1:18:42] says, "For I am the Lord, and I change
[1:18:44] not." That's right. God is faithful.
[1:18:47] Lamentations 3:23, God great is thy
[1:18:49] faithfulness. We know God is
[1:18:53] faithful. and you claim that he lives
[1:18:55] inside of you, then you should be
[1:18:58] consistent in all your behavior. Amen.
[1:19:01] Look, I can't hold you accountable.
[1:19:04] I can only hold myself
[1:19:07] accountable. Only you can hold yourself
[1:19:10] accountable.
[1:19:11] You will hold yourself accountable if
[1:19:14] you want to be like Jesus.
[1:19:17] And if you just think, well, God saved
[1:19:19] me. He went to the cross. I'm saved.
[1:19:20] That's all that matters to me. then
[1:19:22] you're not interested in being like
[1:19:25] Jesus and you will not hold yourself
[1:19:28] accountable. But I say to the bride, we
[1:19:30] got to grow up. To the bride, I say,
[1:19:32] grow up. Amen.
[1:19:35] We have to grow
[1:19:37] up. We need to handle life the way God
[1:19:40] would handle it. We need to learn to be
[1:19:43] dependable. Learn to be
[1:19:46] faithful. No need to fly off the handle.
[1:19:48] No need to get upset. Let everyone
[1:19:51] around you know how unhappy you are. We
[1:19:53] don't need to do
[1:19:57] that. First Corinthians 1:9 says, "God
[1:20:01] is faithful." 1 Thessalonians 5:24,
[1:20:04] "Faithful is he that calleth you who
[1:20:08] also will do it." When God is addressing
[1:20:11] the entire Leodysian church
[1:20:15] age, he said unto the angel, speaking to
[1:20:19] the to the prophet here, unto the angel
[1:20:22] of the church of Leodysia, these things
[1:20:24] saith the amen, the faithful and the
[1:20:28] true witness, the beginning of the
[1:20:30] creation of God. We might say that Jesus
[1:20:33] Christ is the same from the beginning of
[1:20:36] the creation till now. He's the same. He
[1:20:40] hasn't changed. That means we can have
[1:20:43] confidence when we go before him. He's
[1:20:46] going to be the same. Amen. 1
[1:20:48] Corinthians 10:12 says, "Wherefore let
[1:20:50] him that thinkketh he stand take heed
[1:20:52] lest he fall. There have no temptation
[1:20:55] taken you, but such is common to man.
[1:20:58] But God is faithful, who will not suffer
[1:21:01] you to be tempted above that you're
[1:21:03] able, but with the temptation also make
[1:21:06] a way of escape that you may be able to
[1:21:08] bear it. So anytime you think you can't
[1:21:11] handle what's going on, remember God is
[1:21:14] faithful.
[1:21:16] God isn't I don't care. I want to put
[1:21:19] No, God is faithful.
[1:21:22] So if we feel that we can't bear it,
[1:21:25] we're going to fall into the
[1:21:26] temptation of saying that we can't
[1:21:29] handle
[1:21:32] it.
[1:21:34] Amen. 2 Thessalonians 3:3 tells us, "But
[1:21:37] the Lord is faithful, who will establish
[1:21:40] you and keep you from evil."
[1:21:44] Lord is
[1:21:50] faithful when the beast and the kings of
[1:21:54] the earth
[1:21:55] uh shall make rule. You can find this in
[1:21:58] Revelation 17:14. Shall make rule uh
[1:22:01] make war with the lamb and the lamb
[1:22:04] shall overcome them. For he is the Lord
[1:22:07] of Lord, the King of Kings, and they
[1:22:09] that are with him are called, chosen,
[1:22:14] and faithful.
[1:22:16] We've got to get faithful if we're going
[1:22:18] to be overcomers.
[1:22:20] We can't just say we're an
[1:22:22] overcomer because we go to church or the
[1:22:26] message. So, we got to we got to learn
[1:22:28] in ourselves what it means to be
[1:22:30] faithful. What does it mean? What does
[1:22:32] it mean to be faithful?
[1:22:36] And I I I think God is always calling us
[1:22:38] to be more than what we think it is. I
[1:22:42] believe that. Amen. We must learn to be
[1:22:45] the same as God. Faithful. If God is
[1:22:49] faithful, God living in us will be
[1:22:51] faithful. If God is the same yesterday,
[1:22:54] today, and forever, and dependable, then
[1:22:57] God living inside of us is going to be
[1:22:59] dependable. Right? We've got to learn to
[1:23:02] be dependable with our behavior.
[1:23:05] We can't just, well, this is how we act
[1:23:07] in church. We act like Christians.
[1:23:11] And then when we're at home, we can just
[1:23:13] say what we want to say.
[1:23:16] Act how we want to act, get upset, be
[1:23:20] bothered, and feel it's okay.
[1:23:25] That is saying what you're saying that
[1:23:28] your life is saying that God is not the
[1:23:31] same.
[1:23:34] You're allowing the devil inside of you
[1:23:36] to mock God.
[1:23:38] It's that serious because you're calling
[1:23:41] yourself a believer and that the Holy
[1:23:43] Ghost is in you. If he's in you, hold
[1:23:45] yourself accountable. Be the same. Be
[1:23:48] faithful. Amen.
[1:23:54] You'll find out whether you're faithful.
[1:23:56] You're the same when you get under hot
[1:23:59] water.
[1:24:01] The works I do shall you do
[1:24:04] also. I can do all things through Christ
[1:24:07] who strengthenth me. Jesus praying here
[1:24:11] that we would be the same as him in John
[1:24:15] 17 verse 20. Neither pray I for these
[1:24:19] alone, but for them also which shall
[1:24:22] believe on me through their
[1:24:25] word. So that's for us
[1:24:28] now. That they all may be one. That's
[1:24:32] the same that they all may be one as
[1:24:36] thou father art in me and I in thee.
[1:24:39] Remember our opening scripture there,
[1:24:41] not our opening but the one right after
[1:24:42] about Philillip saying when you when
[1:24:45] Jesus when you've seen me you've seen
[1:24:47] the father
[1:24:49] right that they all may be one as thou
[1:24:52] uh as thou father art in me and I in
[1:24:55] thee that they also may be one in us
[1:24:59] that the world may believe that thou has
[1:25:01] sent me and the glory which thou has
[1:25:04] gavest me I have given them that they
[1:25:07] may be one Even as we are
[1:25:11] one, we are one. We are the
[1:25:20] same. There's a difference
[1:25:24] between being a part of something and
[1:25:27] being one with
[1:25:30] someone. First John 5:6. I want to throw
[1:25:33] this in. 1 John 5:6.
[1:25:36] This I know I'm going a lot of fa kind
[1:25:38] of fast with this but that's kind of how
[1:25:41] I am sometimes. This is he that that
[1:25:44] came by water and blood even Jesus
[1:25:49] Christ not by water only but by water
[1:25:53] and blood. So the word or Christ came
[1:25:57] through the
[1:25:59] flesh and it is the spirit that beareth
[1:26:02] witness because the spirit is truth. For
[1:26:05] there are three that bear record in
[1:26:07] heaven. The father, the word which
[1:26:11] is which is Christ. But in this aspect,
[1:26:14] it is the word part, not the flesh part,
[1:26:17] but the word
[1:26:20] part. The word was in the beginning. The
[1:26:23] father, the word, and the holy ghost.
[1:26:26] And these three are one. They're the
[1:26:28] same. Amen. They're absolutely the same.
[1:26:31] Amen. And there are three that bear
[1:26:34] witness in heaven. The spirit which
[1:26:37] dwelt in the
[1:26:39] flesh and the water and the blood. Now
[1:26:43] that is the flesh.
[1:26:46] Notice. And these three agree in one.
[1:26:50] They're not the one. They agree in one.
[1:26:53] So there's a difference between being
[1:26:55] one with God, being the same as God, and
[1:26:58] just being a part of.
[1:27:01] Are you with me?
[1:27:04] Romans 8:29. For whom he did forno, he
[1:27:07] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:27:09] the image of his son, that he might be
[1:27:11] the firstborn among many brethren.
[1:27:15] There's many that are going to be the
[1:27:17] same. We've been predestinated to be
[1:27:20] that. First John 3:2, beloved, now are
[1:27:24] we the sons of God, and it does not yet
[1:27:26] appear what we shall be, but we know
[1:27:28] that when he shall appear, we shall be
[1:27:30] what? like him, right? The same. For
[1:27:32] we're going to see him as he is. And
[1:27:34] every man that has this hope inside,
[1:27:36] he's purifying himself. He's making sure
[1:27:38] he's learning to be faithful. Amen.
[1:27:44] Amen.
[1:27:52] Just a few scriptures. Proverbs 11:13. I
[1:27:55] have to skip some because I don't want
[1:27:57] to be late here. We're We're winding
[1:27:59] down.
[1:28:01] Proverbs. We could go to Proverbs
[1:28:04] there. You know, I'm starting to get a
[1:28:07] little
[1:28:08] sweaty. A tail bearer
[1:28:11] revealth secrets.
[1:28:17] But he that is of a faithful spirit
[1:28:20] concealth the matter.
[1:28:24] When you have the urge that you want to
[1:28:26] tell something about
[1:28:29] somebody, I'm going to tell you right
[1:28:31] now, that is not a faithful spirit.
[1:28:35] And if we're going to learn to be
[1:28:36] faithful, we might as well learn what
[1:28:39] the scripture says we need to
[1:28:41] do. If you know a situation about
[1:28:44] somebody, zip it. Zip the lip. That's
[1:28:48] good. Learn to just keep it to yourself
[1:28:52] because soon as you start talking about
[1:28:54] it, well, I just want to confide
[1:28:56] something in you. No, you
[1:29:00] don't. You're looking to get it out. And
[1:29:04] I just want to bring you back to this
[1:29:05] scripture. God is calling us to be a
[1:29:09] faithful
[1:29:11] spirit. Amen. Amen. Look at Proverbs
[1:29:14] 13:17. A wicked messenger fallth into
[1:29:21] mischief. A wicked messenger fallth into
[1:29:25] mischief. But a faithful
[1:29:28] ambassador is
[1:29:31] health. In other words, he gets the job
[1:29:33] done.
[1:29:35] He just carries it out. If he's got to
[1:29:37] conceal it, he's going to conceal
[1:29:42] it. Proverbs 26. See, we got some
[1:29:46] blowing the horns. They love the word,
[1:29:50] right? Proverbs 20:6, most men will
[1:29:54] proclaim everyone his own
[1:29:57] goodness, but a faithful man. Who can
[1:30:03] find who can find a faithful man? I'm
[1:30:07] going to tell you what, a faithful man
[1:30:09] is not a man who claims his own his own
[1:30:14] goodness. He just
[1:30:16] doesn't He doesn't proclaim his own
[1:30:19] goodness. Proverbs 28:20, "A faithful
[1:30:23] man shall abound with blessings." Oh, I
[1:30:26] love that. But he that maketh haste to
[1:30:28] be rich shall not be innocent. A
[1:30:31] faithful man shall abound with
[1:30:35] blessings. All right. Matthew 24, we're
[1:30:38] getting ready to close
[1:30:40] here. Therefore, Matthew 24:44,
[1:30:43] therefore, be ye also ready, for in such
[1:30:45] an hour that you think not the Son of
[1:30:47] Man cometh, who then is a faithful and a
[1:30:51] wise
[1:30:53] servant, whom his Lord hath made him
[1:30:57] ruler over his household to give them
[1:30:59] meat in due season. And I want to say
[1:31:02] this to the heads of the home, to the
[1:31:05] heads of the children, to the moms and
[1:31:08] dads.
[1:31:10] God wants us to make
[1:31:13] sure that we're giving our
[1:31:16] children spiritual meat in due season.
[1:31:19] Something to get them ready so they're
[1:31:23] going to be ready when God
[1:31:26] comes. We can't expect them to be ready
[1:31:29] on their own.
[1:31:31] We've got to make them ready. We've got
[1:31:34] to tell them this is what we need to do.
[1:31:37] And it's the same thing for the ministry
[1:31:41] here. The ministry has to give us
[1:31:44] spiritual meat in due season.
[1:31:48] And we got to keep on keeping on getting
[1:31:51] ready. That's why we believe in a
[1:31:54] five-fold ministry.
[1:31:57] Blessed is that servant whom his lord
[1:32:00] when he cometh shall find so doing. So
[1:32:04] that's who a faithful and a wise servant
[1:32:09] is. All
[1:32:11] right. Luke 16:10. Maybe we'll end with
[1:32:15] this. And you know what? And maybe we
[1:32:18] won't. No, we'll try to end with
[1:32:19] this. Luke 16:10. But I want one more
[1:32:22] quote. I want to read one more quote at
[1:32:24] least.
[1:32:26] Luke 16:10 Jesus speaking, "He that is
[1:32:28] faithful in that which is
[1:32:31] least is faithful also in
[1:32:35] much. And he that is unjust in least is
[1:32:38] unjust in much. If therefore ye have
[1:32:42] been if you not been faithful in the
[1:32:45] unrighteous mammon, who shall commit to
[1:32:47] you the trust of true riches?"
[1:32:51] And he that has not been faithful. And
[1:32:53] if you have not been faithful in that
[1:32:56] which
[1:32:56] is belongs to another man, who shall
[1:33:00] give you that which is your
[1:33:03] own. So I want to say this, faithfulness
[1:33:06] is just a
[1:33:08] choice of
[1:33:10] being. It's not how much you got to do.
[1:33:13] Don't never say, "Well, if I didn't have
[1:33:18] all this to do,
[1:33:24] you know, I we used to I don't know who
[1:33:26] it was, uh I don't know if it was
[1:33:29] Brother Johnson or one of the deacons at
[1:33:31] the church there that we went to. I
[1:33:34] don't know but someone had said if you
[1:33:37] need something done give it to the
[1:33:39] busiest
[1:33:42] person because they know how to get
[1:33:44] things done.
[1:33:46] So it's not about how much we got to do
[1:33:48] whether we're going to be faithful or
[1:33:49] not. It's a choice that we make.
[1:33:53] And if you learn to be faithful in just
[1:33:55] a little things and you'll learn to be
[1:33:57] faithful in all your life.
[1:33:59] God is calling us to be the same
[1:34:01] yesterday, today, and forever with him.
[1:34:04] In the message, believest thou this, and
[1:34:07] I'm going to end with this. Jesus said
[1:34:10] in John, I believe, the 15th chapter, he
[1:34:12] said, "I am the vine, you are the
[1:34:15] branches."
[1:34:17] Well, now if that vine put
[1:34:21] forth the first branch and out of that
[1:34:25] branch wrote a book of Acts, the second
[1:34:28] branch will make another book of Acts.
[1:34:31] The third branch will make another book
[1:34:33] of Acts. And every branch that comes out
[1:34:36] of that vine will be the same as the
[1:34:38] first branch was. Amen. Let's stand
[1:34:41] together. God is the same yesterday,
[1:34:44] today, and forever. God bless you for
[1:34:46] your patience today in this message of
[1:34:50] being faithfully the
[1:34:53] same. Amen. And let's just I know we
[1:34:56] don't have any music, but let's just go
[1:34:58] ahead and just sing this chorus to be
[1:35:01] like Jesus.
