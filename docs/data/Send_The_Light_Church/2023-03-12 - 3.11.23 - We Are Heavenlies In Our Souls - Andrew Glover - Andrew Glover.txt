possible only believe only believe only believe all things only believe hey man how many believers do we have here this evening amen I'm thankful this afternoon to be a believer amen I thank God he sent us a prophet in this generation that told us that there's three kinds of Believers and amen the beautiful thing about it is he didn't just tell us there was three kind but he actually told us how to identify uh the Believers that we see going around us he said you know the just listened to it the other day he said the believer he said he believes the word regardless he said to make believer he said he'll stick around long enough to find some fault and then he's gone he said the unbeliever he said he just gets up and walks out he said he won't even stick around to find fault amen and I tell you I thank God that we've been identified as Believers Amen in the resurrection power of Jesus Christ amen we want to say God bless you all this evening mind is a real honor to be here again and it's good to see everyone out here and all of our friends here this evening different pastors brother Dan God bless you and I see brother Bailey back there and your wife God bless you all and came over to support the meetings and of course we sure appreciate brother John and appreciate the work here and what's being done for the kingdom of God and we want to bring you greetings this evening from our pastor brother Sean Martin as actually brother Seth's father there he sends his greetings to you this evening and sure glad to have Seth with us this time again and amen let's just buy our hearts together this afternoon and let's invite him I I believe you are under expectation of his word tonight let's just ask him to come and speak to his Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here this afternoon Lord we have not come to be seen or to be heard but Lord we have come for one purpose for one motive and one objective and that is to honor you and to lift up the name that is above every name Lord you said that we're two or three are gathered together in my name you said there I will come and I will be in their midst and Lord we're not gathered here tonight in the name of a denomination we're not gathered here tonight in the name of a Creed or a Doctrine but oh God we're gathered here in the name that is above every name Lord that at the name of Jesus every knee has to bow at the name of Jesus every tongue has to confess and Lord at the name of Jesus every demon has to turn loose so father we exalt the name of Jesus tonight may you come in this room father I just want to speak the name of Jesus over ever home Lord over every life over every situation father there's no other name that can change the conditions But Your Name Lord now father we surrender our hearts and our minds into your hands Lord may you come father you see the need of the congregation here Lord a congregation this size father there's no way that I as one individual Lord can minister to ever need and seek to every situation but Lord I know that if I can get myself out of the way and you can take control then Lord needs will be mad Hearts will be touched lives will be changed father we invite you have your way Among Us Lord may you bless this congregation here tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God richly bless you if you have your Bibles this evening we want to turn to the book of Ephesians the first chapter we want to look here in the book of Ephesians the first chapter and I want to look here in the third verse of Ephesians 1 and 3 I I know this is a very familiar reading to you as Believers in the book of Ephesians the first chapter and then the third verse Paul here writing he says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ now I love uh the way Paul words this is it's not in the future and it's not just in the present but he said this has been done in the past so in other words you're in time catching up with what he'd done in eternity who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ now I want to look at one other verse with you in the book of Hebrews the sixth chapter I know it's a very another very familiar reading to you and we believe as Believers that Paul wrote the book of Hebrews in Hebrews the sixth chapter we want to look here in the 19th verse of Hebrews 6 Paul here writing speaking of Eternal hope he says which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul now Paul didn't say of the body or of the spirit but which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon from those passages of scripture tonight I want to speak to you here and I want to maybe title this tonight that we are heavenlies in our souls we are heavenlies in our souls and I've just been uh studying here some things from the adoption series blood Ram preaches it in 1960 in adoption part one he says in Heavenly places now we're not just out anywhere but we're in Heavenly places see we are assembled in Heavenly it means that's the position of the believer amen the position edition of the believer is Heavenly places that if I'm prayed up and you're prayed up or the church is prayed up he says and we're ready for the message we have assembled ourselves together as Saints we are called out we are baptized with the Holy Ghost we are filled with God's blessings we are called we are elected set together in Heavenly places now he said we are heavenlies in our souls amen amen that's a very powerful statement to me we are heavenlies in our souls he said our Spirits has been brought us into a Heavenly atmosphere what could happen tonight if we would be sitting here in a Heavenly atmosphere the Holy Spirit moving over every heart that's been regenerated and we have become a new creature in Christ Jesus all sins are under the blood Amen in perfect worship with our hands up to God our hearts lifted setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen worshiping together in the Heavenly places did you did you ever sit in one wife said he said that I would Weep For Joy and say God never let me leave here just Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he said see then he's we're in Heavenly places but we're not just in Heavenly places but we're actually receiving spiritual blessings in those heavenly places he then turns in paragraph 94 and says blessing us with what with Divine Healing amen with foreknowledge and Revelation and visions and powers and tongues interpretation wisdom knowledge all the Heavenly blessings and joy unspeakable and full of Glory every heart is filled with the spirit walking together sitting together amen not one evil fault Among Us not one cigarette smoke not one short dress not one this that or the other amen not one evil fault nobody got anything against one another everybody's speaking in Love In Harmony everybody in One Accord in one place then suddenly there came from Heaven Amen to sound like a Russian Mighty Wind there you are amen he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings amen so we now know that the position of the believer is in Heavenly places right amen that as Believers we're in Heavenly places and we are partaking of spiritual blessings now brother Brian list those spiritual blessings as for knowledge and Divine Healing amen visions and powers and tongues amen but tonight I wanna I just want to focus on one of those spiritual blessings and that is revelation amen one of the spiritual blessings to the believer in Heavenly places he said is revelation now when you start looking at this word heavenlies amen you find that the word Heavenly actually means to suggesting amen of the Blessed state of heaven so when you automatically think of the word heavenlies and your heavenlies in your soul amen then you're thinking well in order to be that I've got to go to heaven Amen to be Heavenly amen but I actually believe in the Father's prayer amen when he stood upon the Earth and he said father let thy kingdom come time he said let thy will be done Amen on Earth as it is in heaven Amen in other words he was praying that there would be a people on the Earth amen who would not just be manifesting Humanity amen but they would be manifest in deity amen From Another Dimension listen you're not just upon the Earth manifesting the humanity of 16 elements amen but you're here upon the Earth manifesting amen the deity of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in other words I believe amen there's a people on the Earth that does not have to go to heaven amen just to enjoy Heaven amen but they're actually enjoying Heaven on the earth amen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost listen amen whatever is in heaven is in your soul tonight amen whatever influences influence in your soul amen is the influence of Eternity myth and defend tonight in our souls amen we have passed from Death unto life in our souls we have passed from death and alive and we are heavenlies in our souls now 1961 the prophet has asked the question they say please explain the difference amen between the spirit and the Soul he said well now that's a hard one he said but the first thing is you are a Triune being just like amen father son Holy Ghost see amen there are three titles going to one person and that person is Jesus Christ amen your soul and your body and your spirit amen is going to one person now amen I can see brother John here tonight amen there's one person sitting there amen but there's three titles going to one person amen he's a father he's a husband he's a grandfather he's a pastor amen he's different titles but he's one person amen and he's got a body he's got a spirit and he's got a soul amen you cannot see his soul amen you cannot see his Spirit the only thing you can see is his body amen but if there was no soul there and no spirit amen then you're not seeing John Martin because he's a Triune being amen and listen friends amen don't let the devil water the god head down Amen to two Lords or three Gods amen there is one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ and he's the father of Eternity amen he's the mighty conqueror he's the Everlasting father he's the Prince of Peace he's the god which was the gun which he is and the god which shall always be and he's the same yesterday today and forever what he used to do he's still doing and what he's doing here tonight amen he will do it fair amen I feel like preaching here for a second my God is not dead my God is alive he's still a savior he's still a Healer he's still a deliverer he's still a revelation Giver he's still a devil defeater he's still a body changer he's God and he remains to be God listen he's God regardless of the condition of your life he's God regardless of what you're going through he remains God regardless of how hot you are how cold you are how indifferent you are how sick you are he's gone regardless of the condition amen see he is one God he is father son Holy Ghost he said now your soul body and spirit amen but it takes three to make you with just one of them you're not you see it takes three he said this is my hand this is my finger this is my nose this is my eye but who is me he said what's on the inside of me that's the intelligence see this eye this ham this body stands here amen my body could be here but me could be gone amen come on church you've been to enough funerals amen the body is there but the person is gone amen see because whoever I am inside me has gone on he said that's the part that is the spirit he said then the Soul is the nature of the spirit that when the Holy Spirit comes upon you it does not do nothing he said it changes or converts your spirit amen to a different soul amen and that soul is a different nature amen that's on the spirit amen so the the soul is the nature of your spirit listen as he was identifying the real you he was not identifying the real you from the outside in he was identifying the real you from the inside out amen the real you is not your body the real you is not your spirit amen the real you is your soul among church amen I tell you I might as well preach I'm here amen there's three kinds of Believers in every church right amen there's a make-believer there's the unbeliever and then there's the real genuine believer do you realize inside every one of you tonight amen there's three kinds of Believers amen your flesh is an unbeliever your flesh does not believed it will never believe your flesh disagrees with this message amen your flesh your flesh is a hybrid product amen then you go a step further and you got a spirit and that spirit is a make-believer if the music's rise and your favorite preacher's in town and there's no troubles or nothing man your spirit is sword in the heavenlies amen but wake up on Monday morning and receive a bad dream support amen and that Spirit can drop quicker amen than an airplane and a turbulence amen because that spirit is a make-believer amen but inside of that body and inside of that spirit amen there is a soul in there amen and that Soul believes the word amen regardless of the body regardless of the spirit listen you're not serving God by your flesh you're not serving God by your spirit amen you're serving God from your soul amen that's why you're still believing amen because you don't just have the Holy Ghost on your flesh and you don't just have the Holy Ghost in your spirit but the baptism of the Holy Ghost has taken residency in the soul of the believer and you're not just sealed to the next meeting you're not just sealed to the next Youth Camp you are sealed until the day of your Redemption [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah the soul is a different nature that's on the spirit the soul is the nature of your spirit he said first you is evil you is hatred you as mean you had malice in Strife amen but now you're loving now you're sweet and now you're kind he said it's your nature amen it's your soul oh that's been changed amen it's your soul thank you brother it's your soul that has been changed now people take this quote and say well there's two Souls I say they can't read because the prophet said amen the old soul died and the new Soul which is the new nature was born into you see your brain is not your intelligence your spirit that's in you is your intelligence amen your brain is a bunch of matter of sales and so forth it has no intelligence in itself if it did then as long as you laid out there whether you was dead or alive it would still operate but it's not your brain it's your spirit inside of you and your soul is the nature of that Spirit see it's the soul of the spirit that controls the spirit amen that controls the body amen listen the prophet of God said there's a control tower amen one in your flesh and one in your soul he said whichever one is on the control tower of your soul amen will send out a warning signal amen for the needs of the body listen if the devil is on the control tower of your soul then you're going to be mean you're going to be evil you're going to have malice you're going to fulfill strife amen but if Jesus Christ the son of God the person of the word amen is taken the residency of the preeminence of the control tower of your soul amen then it'll control that spirit and it will control that body I love to think how the prophet said amen that a Believer is actually a twofold being he said he is one of the earth to die he said but he is one of the heavenlies to live he said if you've got the holy spirit amen then you are a candidate for association with the Unseen World amen and the supernatural he said see when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart he said then quickly he becomes then a twofold being he is one of the earth to die but he is one of the Heavens to live in his body he is still subject to death but in his soul he is passed from Death unto life amen in his body he has Earthly contact with five senses but in his Spirit what is the spirit it is the nature amen of the Soul he said he has a contact with God through the Holy Ghost and the angels of God visits them and speaks with them and they are messengers sent from God Amen to reveal and to bring messages from God to this individual then there are two worlds right amen there are two worlds there is a scene world and there is an Unseen World amen there is a reverend priesthood twice looking at the Unseen he said there's a scene world there's an Unseen World he said in the things which are seen are temporary but the things which are not seen are Eternal listen if you've got the Holy Ghost Amen in your soul amen you're living on the earth but your fellowship and with Heaven amen you're living on the earth come on your body our bodies are getting weaker our hair is getting thinner or it's disappearing or it's getting grayer amen more wrinkles are appearing amen because in this body we are still subject to death but if the soul of a man has been regenerated it has brought a vision of the supernatural God who can change the body amen from mortality to immortality listen friends amen we need the Holy Ghost now more than we've ever needed it before they say well we write for message amen what do you think the message he is amen the message ain't about to fussing and fighting amen and arguing over quotes amen the message is none other than Jesus Christ and he is the same yesterday today and forever when you receive the Holy Ghost amen there's a contact with God through the Holy Ghost listen I said his pain as I know how we need the leadership of the Holy Ghost we need it more than just on our flesh we need it more than just in our spirit we need the Holy Ghost in our souls brother remember said it very plain he said you could have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life he said die and be lost and go to hell come on church amen I know that staggers Pentecostals amen but thank God we're not a bunch of suck here tonight amen we're seed who can take the meat of the word and can feed upon that meat and allow that meat to transform us amen from the Earth to Glory put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing amen but the world with God's name attached to it seek the world and the church are all of the same lump he said just like Jacob and Esau were amen of the same parents I love this brother but the spirit of God makes the difference the spirit of God makes the difference he said it doesn't matter if you call yourself a Christian anyone can do that amen the point is whether or not amen you have the spirit of God in you no this replacing this in you amen for without the spirit you are a reprobate and you are none of his amen without the spirit of the Holy Ghost you are a reprobate and you are none of his now think of this tonight because the prophet amen tells us that as Christians amen we're in a Warfare and we are actually in a spiritual warfare now the problem of God says it like this he said I'm not a preacher anybody knows that he said but I'm made up in a spiritual form amen of watching things and seeing things move and forewarning people of the things that's coming to pass he said that's my makeup he said I cannot help that no more than you can help yours he said God has put us each one in the body to do certain things he said so I watch every little move every objective every motive amen cause everything is governed by a spirit among everything is governed by a spirit he said that this church amen was put here for a purpose amen there is a spirit behind this church amen there is a spirit behind your home amen behind every building there is a spirit now if you know if you want to if you want to get deep in this for a second we can amen the prophet of God said you go in these Arenas out here and he said you've got to preach for about five nights Amen to finally get the atmosphere right amen because there's been all kinds of spirits in there and he said those Spirits are hanging around Amen in those dimensions in the atmosphere and he said in order to have a gospel meeting you've got to drive the spirits out Amen to welcome the Holy Spirit now come on we can go a little bit deeper can't we hey man how did those Spirits get in there amen those Spirits got in there amen by people who had the devil on the control tower of their soul and they were not looking for the gospel they were looking for a fight they were looking for a theater show they were looking for some filthy something amen and by the control tower being controlled by the devil amen they invited those demons into that building listen them doors couldn't invite them demons them walls couldn't invite them demons amen but Spirits contact spirits well we might as well preach and behind everything there is a spirit he said behind everything there's a spirit there is a motive and there is an objective behind everything there is a spirit there is a motive and there is an objective he said this church comes here Amen to greatly exalt some human system or something then its motive it's not right but if it's put here to try to achieve something for the kingdom of God then the motive and objective both is right if the motive is directed that way but if you can change the direction of the motive you will change the outcome of the situation if you can change the direction amen if the spirit that is governed amen can be changed come on Church it will it will change the whole thing now and then you all know amen that you get to preach on the pulpit and then he gets up and gets to preach him and I know how it is nowadays amen some asked me one time they said what'll kill them eating in about five seconds I said start preaching on sin and you'll lock that thing up tighter and I don't know what amen because we live in an age where nobody wants to be wrong because everybody's rights nothing's wrong anymore bro I mean everything's right you're right I'm right everything's right and what's amazing to me is a lot of times around the message amen everybody's right brother rhyme is wrong amen when I tell you what that is that's a devil amen it's a spirit of Pride I'll tell you what I believe I believe every preacher is wrong every church is wrong and this message is Right amen what a prophet said Israel I don't care what your name is I don't care how long you've been preaching how long you've been teaching if what you're saying is not lining up with what a prophet is already saying amen it's not welcome in the house of God we're not following Babylonian confusion we are following the saith of the Lord and it's Vindicated the saith the Lord It's a scriptural but saithful and it'll lead us out of time into eternity so let's go ahead and clarify this everything's wrong and the message is right the message is right now you say then why does the preacher get up there and preach against television well he ain't preaching against the person that's God and he's preaching against the thing that's motivating it come on Church well but I don't know why these preachers preach against skinny jeans we ain't preaching against the boys wearing them we're preaching against the spirit that Anointed The Pervert in Hollywood to design them to put them on our boys to make him look like sissies instead of men well I don't know why they're preaching against girls wearing makeup and then we ain't preaching against the girl wearing the makeup we're preaching against the spirit that God on an immoral woman amen through a sex spirit amen to anoint our young girls to look like Jezebels rather than Daughters of God come on it's still right or wrong friends and there's a standard and there's a spirit listen we don't want to be governed by the spirit of the world we want to be led by the spirit of Christ because we are motivated by a spirit everything we do is motivated by spirit I'm out every word we say is motivated by a spirit the prophet of God said whatever your spirit is is what moves you amen you are motivated by a spirit if the spirit of Jesus Christ is on the Christian the believer no wonder he's a peculiar person because there's something moving in him amen God is in him the spirit of Christ is motivating him and he has to move as the spirit moves him could you imagine John the Baptist walk down there and say oh well that's all right and this is all right amen as long as the spirit of Elijah was on him he acted like Elijah when you take these people that ghost now and starts off and says oh I'm going to be a Christian and they start off all right amen but the first thing in about six months they start going back and they start this way or that way you can tell right then that the anointing is leaving them you can tell right then that the anointing is leaving them for as long as the spirit of Christ is in you it'll make you Christ like amen can I say it like this amen we need the anointing we need Isaiah said the anointing will destroy the Yoke of the enemy because of the anointing the Yoke shall be destroyed amen but can I propose this to you amen we cannot just be around the anointing and we cannot just let the anointing be on us amen but we have got to get in the anointing and the anointing has got to get into US you say then what is the anointing amen Christ is the anointing the Bible said If any man be in Christ If any man be in the anointing he is a new creature all things are passed away and behold all things shall become new amen Paul says again in Colossians 1 whom God would make known what is the richest of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is amen Christ in you the hope of glory we can say it like this the anointing in you is the hope of glory see then to think tonight amen that the anointing is Christ and you are the body that the headship of Christ has come upon he said it's Christ coming to his body we all know that the anointing is Christ that comes on the word amen that makes the word live see Christ is the anointing it's the spirit that comes up on the word amen that quickens the word to make it live now can I ask you this question where is the word according to a prophet amen the word is in your heart amen then what is the heart God in it it's got a little compartment amen that's called The Soul amen then the word is in the heart and the soul of a Believer if you believe in Divine Healing whatever more amen in Christ the anointing come into his body do you see the connection there it's just like a husband and a wife becoming one the church has got to get to the ministry until the church and Christ become one listen when the church and Christ become one he can anoint you amen for every blessing that's in the Bible when the church in Christ becomes one amen and a prophet stood on the earth and said the headship is here amen the head is home the body amen listen friends we are not looking for headship we are in Divine possession of the headship of Jesus Christ we are not looking for Direction when I might as well go and preach we're not a headless body we're not a headless group of people we are the Bride of Jesus Christ who has received the headship of Christ we're not following commonly devised fables we're not following stories and made up things we're following the Vindicated manifested anointed word listen friends if the anointing comes in you it will anoint you for every word that's in the Bible listen I love to shout and I'll shout my shoe heels off with you I love to dance the aisles and I'll dance my shoes off with you I love to feel the Holy Ghost amen but I need the anointing amen I needed to do more than just make me shout I needed to do more than just make me speak in tongues amen we need the anointing to live right we need the anointing to forgive we need the anointing to learn I say welcome back the anointing in the church of living God when that anointing comes in when it comes into you and you come into that anointing it will unlock every spiritual blessing that's in the word because everything that's promised in the age you're living in is yours man everything brother John that is Promised in this age is yours then Christ is the anointing can I take it a step further Christ is the mystery of God revealed can I say it like this the anointing Christ is the mystery of God revealed now you know when he preaches Christ the mystery what does he break it down in a three-fold purpose he said the first fold is God reveals himself and he said the revelation of God is Christ right amen he said in the second fold is he will take preeminence in a body by the revelation of himself he said then the third fold is by the revelation of himself having preeminence in a body he will lead that body back to a Garden of Eden condition listen if you can get out of your feelings and get in the anointing Your Glory bound if you can get out of the situations and the backgrounds of your life and step into this anointing it'll lead you from time back into eternity it'll Lead You from One Dimension to and listen friends we're not living on the verge of another church age we're living on the verge of the blending of Time and Eternity we're living in the seasons we're where the word has brought Dimensions so close together we're living in the time where the dimensions are becoming so close together that before this service is over we can be changed come on friends before this meet Miss dismissed our loved ones could appear behind us come on friends you say We'll preacher it ain't six or nine o'clock in the morning he said six or nine some morning amen but do you realize when it's six or nine here in the evening could be six or nine somewhere else in the morning come on church I'm not a crazy man I'm in the anointing I'm in the anointing the anointing has taken preeminence in my body the anointing is taken preeminence of my vocabulary I no longer speak I can learn how to see it I no longer think like Eliana said oh I know preachers say well they say well you got to be careful preaching this bright age amen you're not going to take my identity away from me I am the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm in a bright age I'm following a bright light with a bright anointing with a bride message upon my soul and it's going to change me some morning well it's the truth you're getting the anointing it'll change you so this anointing is Christ now you all know that Revelation 10 7 says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished right amen what is the mystery of God the mystery of God was Christ Christ is the mystery of God revealed then the prophet of God said my Ministry is different I know brother Dan loves these points my Ministry is different my Ministry is to declare him amen he is here he's here the proud of God said Christ the anointing is here he said now I believe as we people have perfect absolutely perfect Vindication that Jesus Christ is with us do you believe that Jesus Christ is with us and so if he's here amen he's here to answer and to minister to us every blessing that he promised in the word if he is here then he's here to answer amen and to minister to the church every spiritual blessing that is in the word he said we pray and lay hands upon the sick and we expect you to believe that amen God especially that now listen to what he says never move from it never move from it he said let nothing shake you now that's a powerful that's powerful instructions never move from it and let nothing shake you what is the devil trying to move the church from Brother what is the devil trying to shake the church from can I tell you what he's trying to move the church from well he's trying to shake the church from from the Revelation amen of the presence of Jesus Christ being here now regardless of the conditions listen friends he's here I know he's coming but he's here amen this is the appearing of the Lord if you can see us appearing you will see him in his coming if you can see him in the appearing of the scripture promise of the age you're living in then you will see him in the Fulfillment of the promise of the second coming listen he is here regardless of the conditions regardless of what's going on in Washington he's here regardless of what fault she's doing he's here regardless of what Trump and Obama and Biden regardless of what any of them is doing he is here friends listen amen The God Who can change the scene he's here there's a man here who can turn come on brother Amen brother Brian didn't preach there's a man coming who can turn on the lights he said there's a man here who can turn on the light and I say that same man he's not in a tomb in Jerusalem and he's not in a tomb and Jefferson meal but he's right here tonight in the Dynamics of his Resurrection come on church if you're in darkness you ain't got to stay in darkness if you're in confusion you ain't got to stay in confusion there's a man here who can turn on the lights he can lead you out of the prison Barabbas he can lead you out of the trials because he's here to make good the promise of his word to those who can receive his word here then if he's here he's going to be somewhere if he's here he's got to be somewhere then I proposed you the question where is he he's here he's in the bright body if he's here then he's got to be somewhere and he's in you come on said deity is not in heaven amen deity is in the earth deity is in you he said then there's a pressure against you you all know any any believer here amen that can really testify that you got the Holy Ghost you know there's a pressure against you you know there's a spirit against you and the polygons say what it is is it's the gates of hell he said now what is the Gates of Hell against he said it's not against the denomination it's not against the government because they're all recognized he said see amen but that's not what the gates of hell is against brother it's against the spiritual revelation of Christ being here now the same yesterday today and forever any believer that will stand on the promise of Hebrews the 13th chapter and the eighth verse that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and and forever it will put a Target on your back and the devil will do everything he can he'll try to shut your doors he'll try to stop your ministry he'll try to squash your influence he'll try to set your anointing but I want to tell the Devil he's come too late the seed is already in the body and the quickening traumatizing power of the Holy Ghost has released upon the soul of the believer listen we are heavenlies in our soul we have come to a spot you can beat us you can bang us you can shoot us you can establish you can do whatever you want to us but you'll never turn us around you'll never shut us up you'll never back us off of our confession because we're heavenlies in our souls by the quickening power of the Holy Ghost glory to God I feel like preaching here now are you hearing me friends don't you let the devil move you from that don't you let the devil shake you from that regardless of how you feel he's here regardless of what's going on in your family he's here come on send the light church regardless of what's going on in your church he is here not a crazy man I'm a witness I'm not a crazy man I'm a I'm a witness of the presence of Jesus Christ he's here now I love the problem that God says it like this he said the whole secret was the revelation there's where the trouble is people don't understand that the whole Church of the Living God is built upon a spiritual revelation of Christ amen Matthew 16 right Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against it and he said he is the word John 1 1 3 right John 1 14 and when that word comes into you now we're bringing it on are we when that word comes into you he said it's sharper than a two-edged sword it discerns the faults and the intents of the heart he said there's the word coming in there's the word coming in when the revelation of every word of God is true can I say that to you the way the prophet says it the revelation of every word of God is true can we take it another step hang your soul come on Church where's that word coming to that word's coming to your soul hang your soul on any phase of it now if you study this quote it's actually in the mark of the beast the Seal of God part one Long Beach 61. remember says hang your soul on any face of it and it amazes me brother John is he stops and there's a semicolon and it says revelation hang your soul on any phase of it Revelation in other words the prophet is telling you the word of God coming in the church is not just in book form it's not just in letter form but what's coming into the church in the age you're living in is the revelation of the book you've been carrying it's the revelation of the scriptures you've been listen Church there's people carrying the same Bible you're carrying they're reading the same scriptures you're reading amen and they've been through the same things you've been through come on church and it destroyed them they're no longer serving God some of them are atheists and don't even believe in God but here you are in the house of God on a Saturday afternoon amen with your hands raised to God with an amen in your soul and you're still believing the word you know why because you hung your soul Amen on the revelation of the word of God and the age she was living in I say hang your soul on it listen young people you want to hang your soul on something hanging on this message you want to hang your family on something father hanging on this message this message is the revelation of Jesus Christ made Vindicated in the season we're living in amen hang your soul on it now we go into Hebrews 6 19 again and Paul says it very beautiful brother John I love how he says it he said which hope we have not which hope we're trying to get but which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul it's brochure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil now look at this word Soul it is the breath of life it is the vital force which animates the body and shows itself in breathing the soul it says the Breath of Life the vital force which animates the body and shows itself in breathing look at this next definition the soul is the seed of the feelings the desires the affections the aversions our heart our soul look at this next definition the soul the human soul and so far as it is constituted by that right use of the age offered it by God it can attain its highest end and can secure eternal blessedness amen your soul is the only thing that can attain the heights of God your soul is the only thing that can attain the depths of the love of God your soul is the only thing that can attain the things that God has to offer you as a human Amen to change your view to change your focus to change your life is the soul is the only thing that can receive it and when that Soul receives those things that is offered by God it will actually secure Eternal blessedness I love this one the soul as an Essence which differs from the body listen and is not dissolved by Death yeah the soul which is distinguished from the body amen and is not dissolved by death it is distinguished from other parts of the body glory to God come on Church your body amen listen your body can become paralyzed but your soul can't your body can get cancer but your soul can't come on Church your body can go blind your body can go deaf your body can go down let your soul can't amen because the soul amen has passed from the ability to be touched amen by the ailments of humanity into a dimension with God come on church if you got the holy ghost in your soul you'll ought to be the happiest person in Flint Michigan tonight if you've got the Holy Ghost and you know come on friend what are you feeling right now I'll tell you what you're feeling you feel a little tug in your heart can I tell you what that is that's not the personality of a Preacher that's not the words of your favorite preacher amen that is a witness from the Eternal Dimension that whatever is in heaven is in your soul by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then I can get on the page with William Branham tonight and say you can no more die than God can I think it's time to start eating these things I think it's time to start feeding on these Revelations it's the only anchor of the Soul it's distinguished from other parts of the body now amen I got to reading the other day studying and I come across Hebrews 6 19. I I normally don't study uh different translations of the Bible but this one really stood out to me from the Amplified Bible it says this hope this confidence Assurance which we have as an anchor of the soul I love this part it cannot slip and it cannot break down under whatever pressure Bears upon it this hope we have amen is a confident assurance and the confidence Assurance is the anchor of the Soul and it cannot slip and it cannot break down under whatever pressure Bears upon it it is a safe and steadfast hope that enters within the veil I love this one of the Heavenly Temple the most holy place in which the very presence of God dwells amen is where the anchor of the soul is hooked to then there's a connection between the soul the anchor and the presence of God listen friends the problem of God said a man under pressure is what he is when he's under pressure his real true characteristics will show when he's under pressure get him all riled up and all stirred up and then you'll see the real man come out if he's got a temper it'll show itself if he's Meek in gentle it'll sow itself amen but put him under pressure once and God puts all of his children in a test to see whether there's any flaws in them now can anybody agree with me that everybody is under pressure well six of you are there must be something good in the water up here we're gonna take some back home everybody's under pressure he said see it's a neurotic age everybody is all built up haven't got no time that builds up to a place amen that it breaks up things it causes people to have hard feelings when they snap off and say things they don't mean to say see everybody is guilty of it I'm guilty of it you're all guilty we do things under pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise he said see there's an excess pressure built up today and before I go any further I might say this I believe it's the enemy coming down and pressing he said I believe it's the devil he said because we know the coming of the Lord is at hand the Bible said in the last days the devil would go about like a roaring lion and if he now listen church if he could get you under pressure amen hurry and running amen over something you will make decisions you would make if you would sit down and think it over then let me ask you this oh according to Paul can receive as much pressure as you can put on it but it will never break down can I ask you this where is the pressure coming from that's coming upon your soul I'll tell you where it's coming from it's coming from your body and it's coming from your spirit your body and your spirit will actually join together and we'll put pressure upon the real you which is your soul you know why because pressure is an influencer come on Church you let pressure come into church it'll influence decisions it'll influence the way things are conducted amen pressure is an influencer and pressure from your body and pressure from your spirit amen will try to influence your soul but love I love what the prophet said he said listen the soul amen is anchored and it's not waved about with every Doctrine and everyone tossed about from one to another amen it don't take sides over here and take sides over there and don't know where it stands amen the soul is established the soul takes sides with the word the soul of a Believer takes sides with the word of God listen friends amen your body will take sides against you your spirit will take signs against you amen but your soul will take sides with the word now you know I'm telling you the truth your soul will take sides with the word you know what I'm talking about it's Saturday or maybe we'll go to a Wednesday okay amen cause it's always harder to get to church on Wednesdays ain't it I mean you know you have a good Monday good Tuesday if anything's going to fall apart it'll fall apart on Wednesday right amen now watch amen it's a devil trying to influence the real you because the real you take sides with Hebrews the 10th chapter and the 25th verse when the Bible said forsake not the assembling of yourselves together then listen friends it's not your body amen that believes that your body tells you you're too tired to go to church your body tells you you worked all day you're physically wore out and as soon as you go in there and you sit down amen that crazy song leader is going to get up and he's going to be all on fire and he's going to be singing the joys of God and he's going to say come on Church let's sing Come On Church raise your hands give God a hand clap of praise and you know your body's wore out and you just need to stay home and kick your feet up and get your cold iced tea and get you some ice cream and hopefully the live streaming Link Works that's your body that says that but your soul in there says without your feet I can't get there without your feet I can't without your hands to steer the car I can't get there and your soul says I'm going to church so your soul amen will actually bring your body under the influence of your soul and will say I'm going to church and your body will say okay I'll get you there but when you get in there you ain't using my feet to stand up on and you ain't use it come you know what I'm talking about brother John amen that body will say on Wednesday you ain't using my voice to preach you ain't using my eyes to read amen you ain't using my hands to study amen but you get in here amen and you and before long because your soul is already in the heavenlies amen those hands that wasn't going to raise they begin to raise and those hands that wasn't going to clap they begin to clap and those feet that wasn't going to stand up they begin to stand up you know what happened your soul amen brought your body and their subjection to the word and your soul took sides with the word and made your body obey now can we go a step further your spirit your body okay now you got your body moving but now your spirit says don't nobody love you down there to church if you didn't go tonight what nobody miss you they never call and check on you anyhow so you might as well stay home I mean what do you even why are you even trying to go for do you see how brother so-and-so looked at you did you see brother Dan preaching the other night did you see him look right at you can I just ask y'all a question where are preachers supposed to look okay come on well he looked at me well he looked where are where are we supposed to look for ceiling I'm in the floor we gotta look at peoples we're preaching to me but the devil will get in that spirit and through the five senses of the Elder and inner man he will begin to try to influence the service amen by your spirit amen but the problem of God said your soul will take signs with the word now listen to this he said Your Soul Is Anchored to Christ Jesus and you're born again the life of God is living in you and you know beyond any shadow of a doubt that you have passed from Death In The Life your whole hope is built Yonder and Calvary and the love of God pours through your heart you believe every word that God says is the truth he said now listen you're willing to die for any phase of it you're willing to die for any phase of it then let me ask you this what is the anchor of the soul the prophet said you sell out the world and the things of the world and everything that pertains to anything else to have this that's right put your whole anchor right on that it's the anchor now listen this is powerful it's the anchor of the soul to see his revelation of his word then the anchor of the soul is the ability to see the revelation of his word when you can see the revelation of his word you have received the anchor of the Soul come on church and what is the revelation of the age it's the personal presence of the Divine one in the midst of the church I say tonight hang your soul on any phase of the revelation of the word people say well we've got the Bible that's all we need amen and them same people will say we don't need to read brother Branham we've got our Bibles and them same guys will read Dr Dobson they'll read Max Lucado they'll quote Billy Graham they'll study Oral Roberts amen because there's no anchor in those words come on church I might as well preach we are not following a man we are following the tide ends foreign they say well I can tell you're one of them tapeworms and they actually mean it to me to be an offense but actually take it as a compliment they say I can see that you're on them tapeworms I remember one time I was preaching the guy coming up to me he said well all I can see is you read brother random I said well you actually can see pretty good I said because I'm reading a Vindicated voice well brother Andrew I think we need to go read Luther I think we need to go read Wesley do you not realize when you're reading this message you're reading Matthew Henry you're reading Clark you're reading come on Church you're reading Luther because a prophet is not the bringer of something new he is the revealer of the word and when a Prophet come in this age he sang through Matthew Henry oh can I preach can I preach he went through Clark he went through those commentaries and said this is truth and that's not then the message of the hour has filtered out everything that's not truth and has restored the truth from those voices Amen to the bride listen friends it's time to quit saying whatever denominational hiring is saying and say what the voice of Revelation is said in the AIDS that you're living in I remember one time I just feel good here right now I know one time brother guy told me he said well do you realize when you realize what he's kind of funny how I said he said Do You Realize one day you're going to realize that brother Brandon ran other men I said really he said yeah he said and you didn't know that I said actually I did he said you did funny brother Bill he said you did I said yeah he said well how did you know that I said brother Ram told me he did it that's right that's right amen he said what brother Brandon I said you ain't did it's in Daniel 70 weeks his opening comments I've been reading through all these commentaries looking for Daniel 70 weeks and he said I couldn't find it there come on he told us he studied amen listen friends this message is not some plagiarism I'll tell you who the plagiarizers are or the cowards just walked away from this truth and won't stand behind the pulpit and say they're still saying what a Vindicated Prophet said well it's the truth anyhow but we're going to hang our soul on the revelation of the word in the age we're living in listen friends when you hear his voice speak to you the prophet said hang your soul Amen on the voice of the word that's speaking to you he said I'm the Lord that healeth thee come on church I know that's a scripture in the Bible but we got 1100 books and tapes that breaks down every aspect of I am the Lord that healeth thee I'm the Lord that giveth the eternal life I love thee I Know Thee before the foundation of the world I put thy name upon the book Thou Art mine fear not it's me do not be afraid I am with you amen amen so we believe in the Bible being the full Revelation am I going too long the full revelation of Jesus Christ so we believe that the word this Bible is the word of God direct quote and therefore you can hang your soul upon any phase of it now what did Paul say I'm going to give you some scriptures here in first Thessalonians 5 23 he says the very God of Peace sanctify you holy I pray God your whole Spirit soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ for faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it Romans 8 11 if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors amen not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live out the flesh you shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live if from your soul amen controls the spirit and from the spirit you mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live what is he speaking of he is speaking of the quickening power the problem God said if Christ is raised Jesus from the dead and dwells in you it will Quicken make alive your mortal bodies because it's already life and when it comes into your body say somebody say with me when it comes into your body it brings your whole body subject to it he said subject to what amen the word of God when the quickening power which is the spirit of God by revelation of God comes into the soul of a Believer amen it will bring the whole body subject to it if it's in you listen friends he's the god that could create bread he's the god that created the winds and waves he is not just part God he is all God so let us remember I'm tying this together now okay he also created our bodies and won't our bodies have to obey him come on church if the creator of the body is on the control tower of the Soul amen then the body will have to control have to obey the control tower which is where the house of the Creator is he said you've got to surrender your thoughts you've got to surrender your life your faith to him and watch that body obey what he says if you're a drunkard and you can't quit drinking then surrender that life to him and you'll drink no more if you're a habitual smoker and you tried to give it up and you can't do it Just Surrender that to him and Watch What Happens he'll make that body come back in subjection to that word come on Church he'll make that body come back into subjection that word yes sir but you got to surrender it to him you've got to believe he made our bodies that obey his will also amen if you're a Christian you have to well you say but brother Bradham he makes our bodies obey oh I believe we have jurisdiction over that then you're not fully surrendered if you think you're still in control of your body then you're not fully surrendered I'm preaching to you to the Creator that controls your body by the voice of his word y'all remember the story I know I know some of you heard brother hibiscus testimony I heard it one time it really stood out to me but they had said like this she said we was out there hunting with brother Brandon one time he said while he was out there hunting he said there was a guy he said he was a ruffle Feller and he said he told us she said I'm gonna go down here over the over the bank down here he said a long ways away from Brother Bear and brother Ed he said I got down there or that guy got down there he said I was up here brother brother Branham he said and that guy got down there and the only reason he went down there was to smoke a cigarette so he went down there lit him up y'all heard it went down there lit him up a cigarette and brother Ed said brother ma'am hollered over there and said I can't remember the guy's name right now he he's what was it but but Suffolk that's right he said hey uh he said bud when did you quit smoking he said just now I'm on Church of prophet didn't see him life a cigarette I'll go a step further and say brother Ram didn't even smell the smoke amen but a word and a soul of a Believer is a discerner of what's going on around the camp come on church and when that word was spoken amen Bud's body had to come subject Amen to the word of God to rebuke that demon of nicotine what can I tell you this tonight in closing that same God is in this building tonight and he will bring your body under subjection to the same word oh yeah remember brother M talks about the Indian chief he said some time ago he told me said since me received the Holy Ghost there's been two dogs in me he said one of them's a black dog and one of them's a white dog they argue all the time they growl fight at one another said the white dog wants me to do good and the black dog wants me to do bad I said well Chief which one wins the fight he said well depends on which one Chief feeds the most so I think that's a good answer that's just depends on the warring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of God now we've all heard it said I know you preached it brother John that our bodies come subject to the word right amen I was praying the other day and while I was praying the Lord just began to deal with my heart and I asked the Lord a question I said Lord I said how do our bodies come subject to the word what what what is the formula what what is the what is the atmosphere that we get into you know is it when we get in a good meeting and man the music's going good and the words being preached man we feel the chart what what what do we do how does our bodies come substitute now I'm a firm believer that if you've got a question just keep listening to brother Branham and before long your question will turn into an answer and it did for me he said we are carnal and that part must perish the carnal part must perish but the inside we are a spirit man and the Soul inside he said that's faith in God's word okay then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by faith by accepting what God Said pretty simple isn't it but it's a power packed revelation we bring our body under subjection to the word by Faith by accepting what God said listen if you're sick right now you can accept what God Said read it in the word by faith and your body will have to come subject your body will have to come subject amen just by you accepting what God Said now you all know the story it's a very it's a very powerful Story the prophet of God says it like this he said there was a little girl down there named Georgia Carter he said she now do you all know Georgia Carter how she got in that condition she got in that condition of tuberculosis as a little girl by an uncle who was taking her to piano lessons piano lessons and he raped her on the way to piano lessons and when he raped her amen he took advantage of the girl and it give her body TB so a little girl was a victim of a filthy uncle and she was laying in a bed for nine years and eight months and she didn't even do anything herself to put her in that condition you ever thought about that she had every reason to be angry she had every reason to be mad but she was in there and she was believing for a miracle now can we can we preach this she was believing for a miracle laying in a bed in a tuberculosis case with an uncle abusion or can I go a step further her home was not even a Heavenly atmosphere you say how can you prove that because according to the prophet when it was time for him to go by there her mother was over at the window praying that God would not let that imposter come by her house because she had already got her daughter all worked up so there was nobody in there singing songs with Georgia Carter to create an atmosphere Amen to welcome a miracle in the room but a prophet was out in the woods praying and while he was out there praying he heard behind in the back of a little sheep and that bass said go by the way of Carter's he said I got up and I took off running down there he said I ran right into the Carter's house now let me let me let me let me preach this to you because just as you are a Triune being Georgia Carter was a trying being she had a body she had a spirit and she had a soul her body was in a terrible condition her body was tuberculosis stricken her body was in that condition amen I don't think her body was in a strong condition she hadn't walked in nine years and eight months she hadn't been able to do what everybody else was doing her body was in a horrible condition can we go a step further her spirit no doubt was a roller coaster one day she was up one day she was down one day it's today I don't know if I'll ever get out of this bed her spirit was a make-believer amen but in her soul in her soul she believed the word of God and the prophet of God said it like this he said when you can when you can let your faith loose to God's spirit it will bring your body in subjection to God's Redemptive blessing to you you realize the prophet of God shows you that his ministry amen was not necessarily the ministry of land on of hands I'm not I've not left Georgia so stay with me his ministry he said was not necessarily the ministry of land on of hands he said that's a Jewish sign but you know Jairus said come lay your hands on my daughter shall live but for Roman Centurion said just speak the word he said see that's all the Gentiles just say the word so Jesus turned and said I have found Faith Like That not in Israel see just speak the word because what happened now bear this in mind the Roman knew that every sickness and disease was subject to his word the Roman Centurion brother knew that every disease every sickness was substitute his word now if you can realize the same it's all over see when you can realize the same that every demon somebody help me every demon every sickness every disease every Affliction is subject to the word of God every demon ever sickness every Affliction ever spirit is subject to the word of God he said see when the Roman Centurion recognized that his word was sufficient he said the demon that was over his child amen lost the effect over that child come on church and when William Branham walked in Georgia Carter's house he looked right at her her body was in a terrible condition her spirit was against her but her soul believed I'll get up out of this bed and I'll walk again and he said Georgia in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ rise up out of that bed and walk and a little girl who hadn't walked in nine years and eight months stood up on their feet and the prophet said she took off running are you hearing me I might as well preach it to you amen she took off running he said when she got out there he said she blessed the grass he said she blessed the trees you know what else I love he said she turned and went over and started playing the piano for nine years and eight months she had not had a piano lesson oh God she had not had a piano lesson in nine years and eight months but when the word okay when the word come under the influence of the anointing that was in her soul it released the ability to go over and play the piano again can I go a step further brother rammstead and today she's my piano player at the Milltown Baptist Church do you realize when Georgia Carter was healed the Milltown Baptist Church was shut down but when Georgia received her miracle that Miracle opened up an entire church amen by the manifestation of the anointing of the word I'm on church I come to tell you get up out of that bed it's time to walk again it's time to believe again it's time to pursue the things of God again hello that Roman Center and I'm gonna close with this that Roman Centurion knew the word he knew the word was true so he confessed I love this brother he confessed the word to the word he confessed the word to the word he said if you'll just speak the word my daughter will be healed if you'll just speak the word word if you'll just speak the word he was in the presence of the word but he had broke out of this Earthbound Dimension into that third pull anointing where the spoken word alone was in God but it now had come into the voice of a Roman Centurion he said just speak the word I love this that word confession he's the high priest of our confession you know what that means confession means to say the same thing so you say the same thing God said and that makes it right because you're just repeating God's word and when the inspiration of the holy spirit is here to inspire you remember God will make your body come into your confession God will make your body come into your confession if you say well I'm a drunkard and I want to drink don't worry you'll soon be one if you say I'm a sinner and you want to sin you'll be right into it but if you say you're a Christian and you believe it all along then your testimony will bring you right into it amen your testimony is the vehicle from the confession to the manifestation if you can confess it your testimony will ride you into the manifestation of it your testimony will bring you right into it what did the Bible say they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives if you believe in healing believe God has healed you confess it and God will make your body obey your confession he's the high priest of your confession sitting at the right hand of the father now with his own blood to make intercession for any confession that he died for do you love him tonight amen he died to rid sin Church sickness is the result of sin he said but you go right I'm giving you some stuff right now you go right out of this building testifying that you're saved what if you got this bill and said well I don't know then you're not saved but God will make your body obey your confession see he's the high priest of our confession before you can be healed you have to confess it first before you can be healed you have to confess it first John Ryan was always healed but his eyes were still closed and the prophet of God said I love this brother the prophet God said I realized something I had to give him something to say Amen I had to give him something to say so I told John Ryan you go downtown and you sell them papers and say extra extra Read All About It God has healed my blinded eyes the morning he woke up he was as blind as it ever been but now he had something to say and one day he walked in the barbershop and sit down and every time he had been in there I just imagined brother the barber said you want your regular haircut and this time he said no give me number three up there [Applause] we're kind of chuckled and said yeah that's real funny you don't know what it is because you've never seen it he said well I see it right now it's like this on this side a little fan on this side a little bit what are you saying I'm saying confess the word from your soul get in your testimony confess it and ride it into the manifestation let our musicians come tonight the soul is the real you you say well I got the baptism holy spirit that still has nothing to do with it that's just a temporal gift for you he says the real gift is your soul down in there see that was born of God and that controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God well I'm a Pentecostal I belong that if you don't line with that word there's something wrong you see you're a real you're a real father ain't God because that real start in your soul before there even was a spirit it was your soul he said then that Soul didn't come from God then it wasn't the term of God to begin with you're deceived he said you're in a patch of wheat bearing the world's record of the weeds and coming forth acting like the world loving the world because the love of God is Not In You and God is love how many can say Lord let this quickening power bring my body subject to your word he said see you believe there is he said then you go acting like there is you believe there's a change he said you believe you become a Christian you come and confess Jesus Christ to be your savior you believe it then when you go outside and your critic friends they say I don't see no difference in you but you believe there is then you go acting like there is then after a while everybody knows there is isn't that powerful after a while everybody will see the manifestation of your confession you love him tonight friends I believe the anointing's in the body I believe that the bridegroom is acting through the bride once you stand to your feet with us I believe that word in your soul has come into you by the baptism has been quickened by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the prophet said then from a little group of the true seed of the word of God of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin of his word and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word in this virgin who knows no man-made creature doggies The Word of Promise in himself like it was in Mary see God himself made manifest now this brother brother John this one it's a powerful statement he will act himself by his own Word of Promise so to fulfill all that has been written of him as he did when he came from the Virgin womb in this bride he will manifest himself like he came from the Virgin womb how you say preacher what do you mean came from the Virgin womb well according to my Bible Mary knew no man had nothing to do with that it was of the Holy Ghost right according to my Bible she accepted the word she received the Word of Promise and confessed that word and when she confessed that word being unto me according to Thy word she became the womb to carry the manifestation of Genesis 3 15. of Zechariah 9 of Isaiah 7 of Isaiah listen friends it's all through the Bible we can't preach it one night you are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and you're carrying in your soul the word of change listen I believe things can happen right here tonight do you realize right now while the word's going forth you may not feel nothing but your body is coming subject to that word feelings have nothing to do with it I love to feel him I want to feel him every day of my life but when I don't fail him brother Bill it don't change the word that's in my soul because in my soul we're in the heavenlies y'all just the other day we were out in some meetings I want to share this testimony with you and I'm done just the other day out in some meetings I just want to show you that just while the words being preached things are changing it was out in some meetings in Canada I was out there last year for the Youth Camp there at brother biscals and when I was out there I I met brother Murphy Wong so you've probably heard of brother Murphy and I met him out there and brother Murphy told me sperlander he said my daughter here just got married a few years ago and he said they've been trying to have a baby he said it's been I don't know how long they've been married he said you pray that God will just give him a child so they really want a child and I said yeah I said will he praying for that so I was preaching on that Wednesday night and I had no idea the condition or what was even happening or what what the doctor had even said and I began to preach on the third pool and I said see when Jesus Christ come down veiled in human flesh and said let there be a squirrel let there be a squirrel let there be a squirrel I said there was no squirrel DNA laying there brother Johnny didn't come down and say abracadabra abracadoo out of the squirrel residue I make a squirrel out of you there was no scroll guts laying there there was no squirrel DNA laying there it was a creative word spoken and brought something into creation and when I said that sister brother Murphy's daughter sitting back there she told me this year she told me her testimony she said brother Andrew she said last year when you said that she said in my soul I received that word she said two years before that she said brother Ron had been here brother Ron Spencer for a camp and when he was here he saw a vision that I would have a child and he said sis you're going to have that baby she said after that I went to the doctor and the doctor told me I was going to have to have a surgery a surgery in order to have the child she said so I began to think well brother Ron had that vision and the doctor will perform this surgeon I'll have the child she said because brother Andrew according to the doctor without the surgery I could never conceive a child she said but when you said that that Wednesday night she said I received that into my soul and she said Lord there's nothing there to conceive a child with but you're still a Creator she said brother Andrew she said the next morning I got up and she said I felt led to go in there and take a pregnancy test and she said I come to Camp last year amen with a positive pregnancy test she said look over there there's the child amen today she said my vision and the word of God we've got the child listen friends I still believe God can bypass doctors I thank God for doctors but I still believe God he can change things even when you don't feel that your body's coming subject to this word you love him tonight I want you bow your hearts with us here this evening how many can say Lord let this word come into my heart let this word anchor my soul let the revelation of this become my life I want to hang my soul
