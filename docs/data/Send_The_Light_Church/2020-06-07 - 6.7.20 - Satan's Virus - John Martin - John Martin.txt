TRANSCRIPT
========================================
before we begin reading its look to the all three men our dear Heavenly Father we thank you for the desire you place in our hearts to be here and Lord we're not looking to stained-glass windows or how big the churches or even how many people are here when you're here all things are possible you said just where two or three would be gathered together you would be there in the myths Lauren we're believing for the unseen God to come and move supernaturally in all of our lives today prepare us for the revelation of your word Lord we have worshipped you we have expressed our love to you and now Lord I pray that you give us ears to hear the love that you have for us today were the desires to walk in and lord whatever you would speak I pray that you would give us a heart to receive it Lord pray that you'd be with every one of our brothers and sisters that are not here today Lord we ask that the Holy Spirit would just reveal thyself to each one Lord keep them in this late hour that we're in Lord bless this word now as we commit this service in your hands for your honor and glory we pray in Jesus Christ's name galatians chapter 5 starting with verse number 7 he did run well who did hinder you that he should not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump and then also one verse in 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 verse number 3 but I fear but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ amen god bless you may be seated we want to entitle this message Satan's virus and for a subject the virus of unbelief as I was doing some research on viruses I came across some very interesting information viruses are tiny infectious agents that can wreak havoc a lot of times when we've gotten viruses it has slowed us down we feel sluggish and just not just under the weather as a word and just like a believer when he gets a spiritual virus it can slow him down from running the race well amen a virus on its own is inert and I never even knew what that word meant until I looked it up in other words it has no inherent power of action or motion or resistance it is inactive or sluggish by nature having little or no ability to react a virus is not even alive it's merely just a piece of information and the information is not always good obviously what makes some viruses dangerous even deadly is when they attach themselves to a living cell in our bodies they gain their power by worming their way in to a living cell and the only way they can survive or reproduce or replicate is by getting inside a living host and they live off of that once they're in they quickly hijack the cells machinery giving them the ability to reproduce itself and boy do they ever they start off in fourth gear and they just mass-produce like a printing press and they even spill out into other cells and that's how the body gets so infected that you can't even keep up yes they have no life of their own they survive off of living cells by perverting them from the original intentions that God created them for these tiny infectious agents as I said they wreak havoc in our bodies and cause great confusion to the point that it just spirals out of control and and then hospitals doctors they can't do nothing about it Cobin 19 has caused a great pandemic across the world which we all know nearly 7 million cases of the virus have claimed nearly 400,000 lives the unknown of its capability and that's what it was at the beginning into some degree it is still not everything is known about it but the unknown of its capability has caused a great fear and panic to spread throughout the world leaving the world in a quarantine only to come out wearing a mask it keeps mutating into faucets or facets as we watch it continue to it economy our economy I say it's like a burn anybody's ever gotten a real bad burn after you you know quickly put cold water on it if you don't leave it under water it continues to burn it continues to eat away at the flesh and that's what fear does it continues to mutate and cause problems in the world amen people begin to have begun to lose sight of their purpose staying inside that they're losing hope of a better future being cooped up has caused many other problems suicide depression divorce people are losing their mind and and they're carrying out radical behaviors this virus has just gotten things out of control his fear continues to mutate to different facets people's minds are becoming more confused Satan is trying to gain control look at these riots fear is leaving society with great anxiety unrest and unsureness Luke 21 verse 25 jesus said that there would be distress of all nations upon the earth with perplexity distress of all nations is that not what we're going through right now with perplexity I mean just can't figure it out it's it's it's so broad and it's so inter in so many different areas it's just not a simple little thing this distress men's hearts are failing for fear and for looking after those things which are coming upon the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken Luke 21 verse 35 for us as a snare it shall come upon all that dwell upon the face of the whole earth this if I haven't seen this scripture as much fulfilling the effects of the whole earth in this time I don't know what has it just it's becoming worse and worse amen why why are people looting now it's because they because they can get away with it they're taking advantage of the situation the riots are no longer about George Floyd they have become a platform for the enemy to destroy more and more there's no concern to help no they're just complainers let's join together and complain since we can't fix anything let's complain about it fear is a platform that the devil uses to manipulate people and people are looting and taking advantage of the situations because they can get away with it the devil's got a virus right here inside the church it's just the knowledge without the life of Christ it's a strip of knowledge I don't know how many times I've heard in the past month or so people telling me that they know God there okay and they know God and that's all that matters ya know where did God ever say that's all that matters nowhere but see Satan has confused their mind they're taking advantage of the Liberty that there is in Christ and they're looting remember that virus only feeds off of the life and to me the virus s in the church is feeding off the life of the church our opening scripture 2nd Corinthians 11 verse 3 but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that's in Christ just as the most soft obese deceived Eve to his cunning crafting ability to get Eve to doubt is how the devil is corrupting the minds of the people today from the simplicity of just believing all the word they have no problem believing part of the word but we can't be content with that something that I thought was very scary is when years ago when we were going through brother Branham made mention that Eve just disbelieved one word and in one place where the brand said that evil Eve 99.98% of the word point all two percent caused all the problems that we deal with today and how can we just stand on I believe in God so did even look what happened she didn't down that unbelief is like a virus it has no life of its own it's just a strip of knowledge from the tree of knowledge of good and evil Satan has no ability to create he only has the ability to corrupt and pervert that which God has created from this original purpose and there are seeds of doubt that can reproduce and eventually leaven the whole lump he did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth how many times has did we hear the Prophet and the message say if Eve just if Eve doubted just one word where does that put us we can't take that part out of the scripture amen we can't hide behind that I believe the Prophet I believe the message I believe what he said if you believe the message you will take the message and follow the message not just say I believe it and then you do what you want to do just loot because you can get away with it this persuasion cometh not of him that call with you a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump Satan has the ability to persuade called believers from obeying the truth to the virus of doubt it's a definite germ of knowledge that can affect the whole system just a little bit of just well this is not a big thing in the big picture where does that lead you it doesn't lead you to hungry for more God for for wanting to and always leads you away but as long as we think we've got it covered we feel comforted and that to me is how the devil corrupts our mind from the simplicity of believing in Christ believe everything don't doubt it doubt has the ability to hijack the mechanism a free more agency get in there and begin to to reproduce is doubts and spilling over and others and before you know it what you say to others they're beginning to believe mass-producing until leavens the whole lump doubt accepts knowledge but faith but faith accepts the word and that's why we'll never have think about all the wars that have been fought over religion they haven't been because they had a revelation but people will fight for what they believe in though I believe I'm a Christian I okay okay why don't we just get into this word and start living and that's what matters that's what we need that's what the world needs it's not about defending our belief it's about being an instrument that God can use in this hour to help others when Paul told Timothy about the perilous times that were coming in this day he described a spiritual virus that has infected the church you can say Amen to that's the truth believers were more into themselves that's what this virus does did you know the virus of unbelief can cause people today to do what they want to do that's what it did to Eve that low most of tobey's just said you know you can you'll be like God I just do just the devil never said you're gonna go away from God and you're gonna come on my side he deceived her through his subtilty his craftiness and his ability to be able to say something to the minds of believers and make it look so close jesus said because iniquity would abound in the last days the love of many would wax cold iniquity just do what you want to do you don't have to do what God has asked you to do and that's becoming easier to do today there's more Ludi 2nd Timothy chapter 3 verse 1 look at this virus here this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come now I want you to notice that these are symptoms that a person has after they've been infected by the devil's virus this is basically describing the nature Satan in the church not in the bars but in the church for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters God resists God is resisting the church it is the Murrays the few is it the brave the few no the proud that's right the few the proud and the Marines it should be the few the humble and the bride that's what it should be but the church their bolsters instead of giving God the credit instead of lifting him up and saying he is he is my life they become boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy I can't imagine this being in the church without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers has anybody got accused in the last week this is a this is an ongoing situation here false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good hard hard for some people to find something good about you because the anointing the virus that's on them is judgmental they want to find something traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God say late they love God but they've been infected unbelief the unbelief of putting God first and only knowledge has no life of its own having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away now you would have thought Paul would have been describing the riots lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God hurt ready high-minded fears incontinent despisers of those you would think he'd be describing the physical riots and Wars of mankind but he's describing the church the symptoms of a spiritual virus and how bad it can get instead of an of a church it infects believers now it doesn't take away their salvation necessarily they just need the vaccine they just need help they need to get it out of their system remember God said in Genesis chapter 2 verse 17 for in that day in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die knowledge has no life of its own and in this hour people are ok with a form of godliness but they're but they're denying the power God has power to overcome the virus to overcome on belief and then to get us to run the race well not just run it but run it well Satan found a way to mass-produce his knowledge without life he hijacked Eve in the garden and started mass-producing his evil nature that's why we all got to get born again because it brought for death and a little leaven left the whole lump and people are living off the life of God every person that's born they're living off the life of God whether their seed of God or not whether they're born of God are born again or not all life comes from God they're living off that life but God intended every person to be born by his will and Satan has got in there and perverted it and and it just mass-producing don't let unbelief keep you from walking into further truth yes we're believers yes we have the truth but there is more truth for us and we're on different levels you know how the virus is infected people differently some they have it they'd only realize it some have it and there's just totally knocks them out well we don't know everything what's it happening inside of us we don't our heart is deceptive it was deceitful who who can know how hard it it takes the word to unveil it's why we come to church to find out where we're at and when we hear the word of course it's gonna be like whoa Satan sees we got some unbelief in us I mean God sees me we have some unbelief in us and it has to get out of there amen Satan has wormed his way into the church and has hijacked 'add the hosts corrupting believers from believing more of the word that's exactly we did the eve eve believed is probably everything perfectly don't you think it wasn't until the last bit before she fell the the children of Israel that came out of Egypt they believed they believed in God they they they watched the pillar fire they move when the spirit moved God was with them their shoes didn't wear out you've heard me say they had BlueCross BlueShield but yet they did not continue to walk as God show them more light that virus 11 the whole love there was just if it wouldn't have been for those 10 spies coming back with a rapport but they would have just let Joshua and Caleb stand at the pulpit said were more than able to take the land they all could have went in a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump that's why it's important to let your speech be positive it can make a difference in somebody else's life it's no longer about escaping the tired the tiny a man made religion to have the freedom of religion in our country no people are taking advantage of the so called liberty and looting for their own personal gain they may not be robbing the liquor store and coming up with cases of liquor or TVs or all the other things that we see that they're looting but believers are looting their time and doing what they want to do instead of giving it back to Jesus this quarantine opened the door for people to take their liberty and not go to church if they don't want you to get involved in other things to get distracted from their god-given responsibilities to not carry the burden of the local church the body the pastor or the ministry this quarantine opened the door from lukewarm Laodicea who are already in need of nothing are you going to church well it's about 50/50 that sounds like lukewarm to me jesus said I'd rather have you cold or hot but lukewarm not interested because thou sayest I'm okay because they'll say us I am me nothing Jesus has seen the very fact that people have the attitude because thou sayest because this is where you're at because you have that it's a sure sign that you got a virus that's your wretched miserable blind naked and you don't even know it terrible virus lair to see them the worst age of all ages the most deceptive of all ages people's minds have been corrupted from the simplicity in this Brook from the simplicity that's in Christ in this age more than any other age people don't want to let go of the Liberty to do what they want to do people feel it's in bondage if you follow the word Satan is always providing us a way that we don't have to do it unbelief is the virus and it will infect the whole body that's why we have to take God and believe every word of God amen verse 18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold by the vaccine now tried in the fire that thou may s be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see God has the vaccine but we got to go after it gotta want it got a hunger for it as many as I love I rebuke and chasten who wants to go to a church like that I'd rather go to a church where every time I go the only message I hear is that God loves me it's different that's a different love than this love it's a human love they got human churches for human lovers but it's no vaccine for unbelief amen it's no vaccine from believe the real vaccine is to repent and not just repent but be exile yes about it knowing that that's the answer yes that's the answer behold I stand at the door and knock I got the vaccine with me Let Me In If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and sup with him and he with me Christ the word is our only vaccine against this terrible virus of doubt it's the hour that we need to be building up our immunity notice when people get a natural bias it affects some slightly and others more it can be devastating well others it may act just like an allergy runny nose a little cough not a big deal the answer no matter where you're at with unbelief build your immunity get serious about it your doubts are not leaving on their own you're gonna have to take a stand with the word when he's preached you got to say amen to the Word of God amen believe every word of God Colossians chapter 3 verse 16 let the word of Christ dwell in you richly richly not partially richly do you ever talk to somebody and they're always talking about the same thing and you notice it is that all you ever talk about it's like a one-track mind you know you know when the Word of God is dwelling in someone richly there's they just want to talk about the word and you can you can tell when the virus is in somebody real heavy-duty because all they're doing is talking about themselves what what they're doing what they got going it's their life I'm so glad that we have a vaccine it's the Word of God amen cast out all unbelief teaching and admonishing one another I like this I want you to teach me in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs I want you to admonish me I want you to help me in Christ emphasis gonna help me with my lord with my relationship with him you can help me don't just sit there and look at me say Amen I'm gonna help your brother John how can I help you care God will take it the rest of the way but if you can't if you can't get to that place we got to keep praying build yourselves up in the most holy faith amen build your selves up in the most holy faith you can do this laying on your bed how he can move the Lord I believe Lord I believe your word begin to quote those scriptures that you know the songs that you know jesus loves me this I know and begin to build your faith you know brother Brandon said if you want to know where Christ is at it's where you left him and we're living in an hour where it's so easy to leave him because Satan has convinced us as long as we've got the main thing yeah we're okay but is it is it what spirit would that be would that really be Jesus saying that so it's got to be another Jesus another spirit which there is not another but there's mimics right so we need to let the word have preeminence inside of us how do we do that Jesus is knocking at the door just open the door present your body to him lad the doctor the great physician come in and fill you with his word when you believe thou has to leave if you want to get rid of the virus just be zealous repent sorry Lord for Doughty I'm sorry for looting I'm sorry for the I just want to be so close to you first Peter chapter 5 verse 6 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time how I was back there and I was thinking about that pillar of fire you're the Mighty and of God it's not fair for me to say I am humble the word will let me know whether I'm why because it's desire the words desire is to see me walk in all truth it doesn't want to pat me on the back for the half that I'm doing because he wants a bride without pride without spot without wrinkle sound for us cos you know I did this morning I admit tiny and it's a wrinkle in it Romans chapter 12 verse wanted nothing to do with the message by the way Romans chapter 12 verse 1 I beseech you therefore by the mercies of God that you present your bodies you want to get rid of the virus present your body a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to God which is your reasonable service the least thing you could do is say Lord Here I am have your way with me you begin to put the stipulations in well this is how my mom and dad believe this is how I know present your body a living sacrifice be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God God wants to transform John Martyn God God is not interested in spanking the church he's not interested in beating up the church to make the church feel bad you know when I used to get in trouble I had thoughts that my daddy didn't like me because he wasn't giving me what I wanted per have anybody tell you what if you loved me you wouldn't do that what is Colonel nature for a person to feel that God doesn't love them if they give them the truth God is interested in one thing getting his bride to a place to have a rapture that's the ultimate now through that process they will become more like him they'll love their enemies they'll lay down their life for the others they'll have the same nature at that point so it's not just one or two or three things down here that we need to get all bothered about or upset or even just focus only on them our goal is to become in His image and God's calling us to that an unbelief is the virus as keeping us from that and that's why we got to separate from that day men we've got to separate from all unbelief if you're gonna quarantine yourself quarantine yourself from all unbelief just get locked in with God the faith of God with you in the message God's Word calls for total separation from unbelief brother Graham said when Satan tried to whitewash it for him speaking of Jesus Jesus said it is written trying he called it whitewash that's what Satan tries to do to us tries to trick us whitewash the word just maybe sugarcoat it maybe not put the emphasis on the importance of it maybe just take it out of its place a little bit and he said yes and it's also written he with stood Satan upon the word because that's what it was the word in the beginning was the word st. John 1:1 in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was what was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the word of God now brother Brennan said it's always a connection with the spoken word God promised for the day and when it comes it's so unusual touch this till people can Harley grasp it because we're so used to forms and ideas of our own that is hard for us to grasp what's truth if they would have only searched the scriptures really appreciate the person who who just sent this quote to me they didn't even know how it tied in with today's message but the Lord did if they would have only searched the Scriptures that a virgin is to conceive see I was it was so unusual to him because it was out of line of the thinking but she was exactly in the scripture and sword is today brethren the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and his promise word of this hour is so unusual good men he said stumbles over it it's so unusual they say the dead was raised up in the blind see in the death here and the Holy Spirit deserves a thoughts for towels the things that come to pass never failed at one time oh they can't grasp it it's so unusual so they say well it's telepathy it's an evil spirit just like they did in that day the unusualness of the word of God in other words when you hear something new that you're not doing of course it's going to seem unusual odd and right away that's an open door for the devil to say that si you don't have to do that how do we what are we growing into are we growing into the statue are we growing into the statue of John Martin a brother Ben brother Mike a brother Larry brother Ron what statue are we growing into are we just coming to our old way of thinking we're not there we're not there so it's okay for the word to come to us and it go wow I haven't seen that like that because he's calling us to that that's it that's the way it's supposed to be we're supposed to hear something that causes us to get closer to God if we don't if we'd come to church only to feel better we're going to miss are going to miss it is part of it is part of the fivefold ministry brother Darrell was telling me again this time when he came this is a lot of people if they had a choice they would choose evangelist to preach to them all the time he says it's like sugar it's like candy it's sweet that feels taste good he says but the bride can't survive on that they need the meat potatoes and that doesn't taste good always especially if I cook but we still gotta eat it right still have to pray pray for the cook all right let's continue this quote we're almost done but when a man is born in the world for a believer he becomes a Nazarite when he separates himself from anything that's contrary to the word a total separation Jesus said I come to separate a man from his wife to tear up the family and when and and he that won't take up his cross and follow me is not worthy to be called mine so don't tell me we're not going to be tried in their own homes in their own workplaces I am faithful for every relationship that I have but there is no relationship that's more important than the relationship that we have with God and we will be tried God will allow the enemy to come in our other relationships and get us to disbelieve and it's our job to separate from the unbelief and take a stand with God's Word amen Brennan says a separation from everything and anything from the church from a community from a belief or from a family or anything that would stand between you and believing the entire Word of God not just the Word of God but the entire Word of God if your soul will not punctuate every promise for this hour with an amen he said there's something wrong somewhere he said you need a separation so Jesus was the Word made flesh and he was completely separated from sinners and unbelievers and the word itself flowed completely and thoroughly flew flowed through him and he said I do nothing until I see the father do it first Wow can you imagine getting to the place with Christ that you don't do nothing he gets instructions from the Lord it was asking questioning him about things and he said verily I say to you the son of man can do nothing of himself except what he sees the father doing and watch everything that he said was perfect and yet he had not to ask about it think about it it was perfect and His perfect truth will always separate from err see what I think is so beautiful about the Saints the way that I see what the ministries for the way that I see what preaching is for the way that I see when I'm supposed to be doing it's not about giving us information that we haven't seen before it's not about getting new information it's about giving you the tools to get a closer walk with the Lord you're the one that got to walk out with a hunger and a thirst and a yearning and a desire for more of God if all three doing is relying on Church and listening to a couple tapes and that's enough to feed I have so many times fed my face with food and I wasn't hungry and you know what it did make me sick I was just trying to stay awake we got to have a hunger we got to have a thirst there's got to be something inside of us that says I want to know you more I want to have more of you Lord the virus of doubt is increasing in this hour it's not getting less it's increasing and to me there's fear like there's never been on the planet there's an unsureness and everything well what it does is it causes a great mistrust the thing is the Word of God is the only thing that you and I have that we can trust it and it needs to be so real to us and we need to build ourself up in the most holy faith jesus said when the Son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth that his return what that isn't coming by hearing the word naturally it doesn't they did they did Hebrew said they heard the word naturally but it didn't profit them because it wasn't mixed with the voice of God speaking to them personally and you get that to happen you got a hunger bore right he gives more grace to the humble but just walking around and say well you know I'm bright you know we do need to show that badge to the devil we do but we don't need to show that Bread edge to one another to one another we need to be humble you want to be bold take the sword of God's Word cut the promises out and tell the devil work where he belongs but to one another lay down your life serve one another Steve one another better than yourself show the badge of love and humility in the life of Christ now when you recover from the virus or you get the victory over it even if you get a little victory over it because it takes time to recover right takes time sometimes the more victory you get I want you to occupy your time for Jesus I'm going to show you this is so important work while state because the Bible says the night cometh when we won't be able to work first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 55 first Corinthians 15:55 as we're getting ready to close Oh death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory and I just want you to we know well the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law no brother man taught us that sin is unbelief so the sting of death is unbelief and the strength of unbelief is the law we know what to do and not doing it you understand but thanks be to God which giveth us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ faith in Christ faith in the word therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as ye know that your labor is not in vain no no why would he be saying this at the end when he is talking about it being all over death and there's no victory sin can't get us any more but thanks be to God let's he gives us the victory why didn't why didn't this chapter stop at verse 57 we have something to do when you stay busy for Jesus that's less that the devil can get in here because right now the devil throws so many things at our lives they can be health issues work if you issues desires plans that you want to do right so many different things he throws at us to distract us and they can get us down but if you're always abounding in the work alone if you're steadfast in the work of the Lord you've got one purpose stay focus on that purpose just stay focused be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord now Paul was not saying that to the believers who were full-time ministry or that didn't have a family this was to everybody we all have the same problems we all have jobs in in other responsibilities but it's up to us to make the choice to stay busy for the Lord amen our labor is not in vain I you know I was talking to a brother and he brought up you know brother you have done so much for the Lord he says I remember when you used to send all those semis down well I done well free out about those and I just likely forgot about everything I ever done and I just assumed my right hand not know what the left hand is doing but I'll tell you what God's got a good record of everything I want to stare at what I need to be doing now not what I did back then I want to see Jesus today keep running the race well don't just run the race run it well fight the good fight of faith lay hold of eternal life don't let that virus of unbelief begin to creep in and slow you down from running the race with all your heart Jesus has stuff for you to do yes she does well I don't know what it is it could be right after church walking out and he lay something on your heart to go pray for something call somebody he has a work for us the lady amen amen whenever it would be he's the laborers are few the laborers are few help us Lord don't let anything persuade you from what he has called you to do imagine if the Lord said to me you know I have called you to get a bride ready in Fenton Michigan and I want you to just preach the word that's all you got to do well everything else that I did for the kingdom wouldn't have got done think about it whatever your hands find good to do stayed busy I'm telling you that the virus of unbelief won't about a creep in you did run well who did hinder you from that you should not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you see the Spirit of Truth is always in a call call you to walk in further truth my my dad never said please don't grow up anymore stay the way you are I'm really happy the way you are don't change what happens
