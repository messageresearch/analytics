[2:29] well turn with me if you would to the
[2:31] book of nehemiah chapter 12
[2:34] nehemiah chapter 12.
[2:37] that's uh after the chronicles between
[2:40] ezra and esther it's not a book we often
[2:42] read into
[2:49] we're going to start we're going to read
[2:50] two verses verse 27 verse 43 but before
[2:53] we do let's look
[2:55] to god in a word of prayer
[2:58] our gracious heavenly father
[3:00] we stand here in need of you
[3:03] lord unless you come
[3:05] and build the church
[3:07] they that labor labor in vain
[3:10] lord we need the great builder the great
[3:13] revealer
[3:16] lord you said upon this rock i'll build
[3:18] my church
[3:19] lord we pray that you'd come
[3:22] to the ministry of the word now
[3:24] and reveal yourself to us that we might
[3:27] become
[3:29] a stronger church
[3:31] stronger vessel for you a vessel that
[3:33] you could use for your honor and for
[3:35] your glory
[3:36] pray that you'd cleanse us from all sin
[3:40] from unbelief from all iniquity from all
[3:42] thoughts anything presumptuous anything
[3:45] lord that's been displeasing we just
[3:47] pray that the blood of christ would just
[3:49] cover us today amen lord come in and
[3:53] commune with us speak to our hearts and
[3:55] call us up higher
[3:57] help us to see
[3:58] lord
[3:59] what you're leading us to
[4:03] father we pray that you bless
[4:05] prepare our hearts now
[4:08] for this word we commit all of our needs
[4:10] and our lives into your hands
[4:13] receive glory now we pray in jesus
[4:15] christ's name we ask amen
[4:18] amen nehemiah chapter 12 verse number 27
[4:25] and at the dedication of the law of
[4:27] jerusalem
[4:30] they sought the levites out of all their
[4:32] places to bring them to jerusalem to
[4:34] keep the dedication with gladness
[4:36] both with thanksgiving
[4:39] and with singing and with symbols and
[4:41] salt trees
[4:42] and
[4:43] with harps let's drop down to verse 43
[4:48] also
[4:49] that day they offered great sacrifices
[4:52] and and rejoiced for god had made them
[4:55] rejoice
[4:56] with great joy
[4:59] the wives also and the children rejoice
[5:03] so that the joy of jerusalem
[5:05] was heard even afar off
[5:09] god bless you may be seated
[5:15] homie's been practicing trying to yield
[5:17] your vessel since wednesday
[5:21] think about
[5:22] that lucifer when he was made he was
[5:25] made perfect
[5:27] for the purpose
[5:29] for the greatest purpose that
[5:31] could have been given him
[5:33] which was to do the perfect will of god
[5:37] and he lowered himself to the lowest
[5:40] purpose that there is
[5:42] which was to serve himself
[5:44] here we were born
[5:46] with the purpose to serve ourself
[5:49] and through the process of regeneration
[5:53] and god conforming or transforming the
[5:57] way that we think to prove what is the
[5:59] good and perfect will of god that god is
[6:01] calling us to the highest purpose that
[6:03] we could have in our lives which is to
[6:05] do the will of god amen
[6:07] but it doesn't happen by coming to
[6:09] church coming to church does not
[6:11] manifest christ
[6:13] it doesn't automatically osmosis make us
[6:15] a christian we have to take the word
[6:17] that we hear and and apply it in between
[6:21] services
[6:23] and then it will become materialized
[6:27] in preparation for our church dedication
[6:29] coming up i want to
[6:30] speak on the subject rejoicing and
[6:33] entitled this message he has made me
[6:35] glad
[6:37] nehemiah had a burden for god's people
[6:41] and it led him to pray and to fast and
[6:44] to to mourn and to weep
[6:47] and god opened the door for him to
[6:49] to help build the people back up because
[6:52] they were broken
[6:53] and part of that rebuilding was to
[6:54] rebuild this wall
[6:56] nehemiah was instructed to rebuild a
[6:59] wall around jerusalem to to protect the
[7:02] people
[7:03] that's what it was for against any
[7:05] attacks of the enemy and it took less
[7:07] than two months to do it about 52 days
[7:11] and this to me was an amazing
[7:13] achievement
[7:15] but the greater achievement was the
[7:18] ability to stay focused in building the
[7:20] wall while overcoming all the scorning
[7:23] the laughing the mocking
[7:25] the despising
[7:27] and everything the enemy threw at them
[7:30] now say you try to do something for the
[7:32] lord and it becomes a lot harder than
[7:35] just doing the act because you have to
[7:37] withstand the enemy's attack against you
[7:40] to keep you from doing it
[7:44] he's thinking about the the timing of
[7:46] the dedication of this this service that
[7:49] they had
[7:50] the actual
[7:52] wall was
[7:53] completed in chapter seven and one would
[7:55] think that after the wall was done that
[7:57] you know you'd have the the dedication
[7:59] service
[8:00] at that time but they didn't
[8:03] the people were not ready for true
[8:05] dedication
[8:09] it took a revival of the people in
[8:11] chapters 8 and 10 8-10
[8:14] for the people to be spiritually ready
[8:17] rushing a dedication service before the
[8:20] people would be ready would just be a
[8:22] waste
[8:23] it wouldn't glorify god
[8:26] but now in chapter 12
[8:28] everyone was ready for the dedication
[8:31] everyone came to church
[8:32] the choirs the musicians the the priests
[8:35] they even took up an offering
[8:39] god had his people to to just walk
[8:42] around that wall as a great
[8:44] uh possession
[8:46] uh
[8:47] around and they were singing and they
[8:49] had dedicated the the the wall with
[8:52] gladness with with singing and they were
[8:55] just rejoicing
[9:00] they were prepared the wall was done
[9:04] the bible says that god had made them
[9:08] rejoice
[9:10] with great joy the wives also the
[9:13] children rejoiced
[9:15] it's a rejoicing time
[9:17] it was so great that the joy of
[9:18] jerusalem was heard even afar off
[9:23] praise the lord
[9:25] it's sad to say that many believers have
[9:27] lost their joy
[9:32] no one is hearing
[9:33] about their joy from afar off
[9:37] whether they say satan stole it
[9:40] or sin had gotten in the way and
[9:42] separated their fellowship
[9:45] with god they ended up missing
[9:48] their joy
[9:49] and oftentimes believers
[9:52] can become lazy when this happens in
[9:54] other words
[9:56] they just blame it on somebody
[9:59] they don't want to labor before the lord
[10:01] to get purified and to to to maybe deal
[10:05] with the little the little things that
[10:08] the little foxes that spell the vine as
[10:10] it were
[10:13] it's hard to be joyful when we're out of
[10:15] fellowship with god
[10:18] when we haven't maybe forgiven
[10:21] someone that done us wrong
[10:24] more and more believers are are lowering
[10:26] themselves to to try and just to survive
[10:28] with a
[10:31] it's true happiness like the world
[10:33] satan has brainwashed the world into
[10:36] thinking that we're to rejoice and to
[10:38] give thanks when we feel something is
[10:41] worthy of our rejoicing something's
[10:43] worthy of our thanksgiving
[10:48] like if there's a surprise birthday
[10:49] party
[10:51] a paid vacation
[10:53] or our team won
[10:56] or we win the lottery
[10:58] or some someone did something nice for
[11:00] us something special for us
[11:04] this is what the world would deem worthy
[11:06] of our rejoicing and our thanksgiving
[11:09] the whole world operates in this this
[11:11] vein of thought
[11:13] they're programmed to exercise this
[11:15] happiness only when their senses have
[11:17] declared something is worth
[11:20] rejoicing over
[11:22] something is worth giving thanks for the
[11:25] situation
[11:27] we don't want to confuse joy with being
[11:29] happy
[11:30] they're really not the same at all
[11:33] happiness is circumstance driven
[11:38] but joy is holy ghost driven
[11:40] it's god driven it's a it's a deep peace
[11:44] in christ the bible says god have made
[11:47] them rejoice with great joy
[11:51] there's nothing wrong with happiness but
[11:53] what we really need is joy
[11:57] so the world rejoices when they see and
[11:59] they feel things worthy of their
[12:01] thanksgiving but the believer doesn't
[12:03] operate
[12:04] with those senses
[12:06] come on now
[12:08] he operates by a different sense the
[12:10] sixth sense called faith
[12:12] he sees things in a different light it's
[12:14] a greater light
[12:16] they are shown to him by a different
[12:18] source
[12:21] he's able to rejoice
[12:23] when the world wouldn't think there's
[12:25] anything to rejoice about
[12:27] he's able to give thanks
[12:29] when the world wouldn't deem it
[12:32] a situation to give thanks
[12:36] and it's because god is the one that
[12:38] makes them glad
[12:40] on the inside
[12:42] they don't need the circumstances to be
[12:44] right they don't need their feelings and
[12:46] their emotions to declare a worthiness
[12:48] for them to express to thanksgiving
[12:52] they don't need to see situations with
[12:54] their own understanding to exercise a
[12:57] thankfulness
[12:58] god is the one that has made them glad
[13:02] their relationship with god is much
[13:04] deeper than circumstance driven
[13:10] it's not
[13:12] about our circumstances
[13:15] it's about us and god
[13:19] we must learn to walk and abide in the
[13:22] spirit of christ
[13:25] that's where we get joy
[13:29] it's in his presence
[13:31] the bible tells us
[13:33] in his presence is fullness of joy
[13:38] we don't want to try to
[13:39] lower ourselves to just try to be happy
[13:42] through outside circumstances
[13:46] and trying to tough it up and and trying
[13:48] to be a christian and put us a smile on
[13:51] all we need to do is get serious with
[13:53] god get in his presence
[13:56] die out to the flesh
[13:59] philippians chapter 4 verse 1 says
[14:01] therefore my
[14:02] dearly beloved and longed for he says my
[14:06] joy
[14:07] and
[14:08] crown so stand fast in the lord
[14:12] stand fast in the lord
[14:15] my dearly beloved i beseech
[14:18] eudius and beseech sinchi
[14:23] that they may be of the same mind
[14:26] in the lord
[14:30] i don't know if these are brothers or
[14:31] sisters
[14:36] but we all need to be of the same mind
[14:38] in the lord
[14:39] and i ain't treat the also
[14:42] true
[14:42] yok fellow help all right there it is
[14:45] those women which labored with me in the
[14:47] gospel
[14:48] with cl clement also and with other my
[14:51] fellow laborers whose names are in the
[14:53] book of light he says rejoice in the
[14:56] lord always
[14:59] and again i say rejoice
[15:04] always i don't know it's
[15:06] i don't know how many times you've used
[15:07] the word always
[15:10] but i'm pretty sure when you use it you
[15:12] mean it always
[15:18] always tell me the truth
[15:20] i always love you
[15:24] rejoice in the lord always
[15:28] and after you do that again i say
[15:30] rejoice
[15:32] send in a message to us
[15:34] let your moderation be made known unto
[15:36] all men that the lord is at hand
[15:41] notice we're not called to just be happy
[15:46] we're called to rejoice it's different
[15:51] and we're not called to just rejoice
[15:54] but we're called to rejoice always
[15:58] we want to get the full message
[16:01] rejoicing sets the atmosphere for god's
[16:04] presence
[16:05] in heaven
[16:07] we know there's rejoicing
[16:10] in hell
[16:11] there isn't
[16:13] think about this
[16:15] they're they're weeping they're gnashing
[16:16] of teeth there's torment
[16:19] we need to stay in an atmosphere in our
[16:22] minds and our thoughts in our church in
[16:25] our fellowship and rejoicing in the lord
[16:29] not looking at circumstances not looking
[16:32] at feelings and emotions but because
[16:34] we've spent time with god and inside of
[16:37] us he has made us glad
[16:42] rejoicing sets the atmosphere for god's
[16:44] presence to do amazing things look at
[16:46] the
[16:47] syrophoenician woman her circumstances
[16:51] she she had a need with a family member
[16:54] she just wanted god to move in the
[16:56] behalf of of healing
[17:02] but she was met not only with those
[17:04] terrible circumstances but she was met
[17:06] also
[17:08] with
[17:09] god
[17:11] not not finding favor
[17:15] with her request
[17:19] it's not meat
[17:22] it's not it's not kosher it's not in the
[17:25] in the in the process it's not in the in
[17:28] the way
[17:32] in fact you are viewed
[17:35] as just a dog
[17:42] but she did agree with the lord
[17:47] and because of that
[17:49] she didn't get all down and discouraged
[17:51] because of her circumstance
[17:53] she kept the right attitude
[17:57] and it brought the divine promise to
[17:59] pass amen
[18:03] rejoice in the lord always it doesn't
[18:05] matter what the word says to you doesn't
[18:07] matter how much god does not lie to us
[18:11] he tells us the truth we are just dogs
[18:14] by the grace of god we're saved by the
[18:16] grace of god we're his bride but we're
[18:19] nothing without him we are everything
[18:21] with him
[18:23] that's why we rejoice
[18:28] rejoice in the lord always
[18:30] and again i say rejoice
[18:33] word rejoice means to be glad
[18:36] to be full of cheer
[18:39] now you would think
[18:42] when you went to a football game
[18:45] or a baseball game or a hockey game or
[18:48] any kind of game and you would see the
[18:50] people uh that were cheering for their
[18:52] team
[18:53] full of cheer and
[18:55] glad
[18:56] you would think they would be rejoicing
[19:01] well they are in the world
[19:04] because of circumstances
[19:09] how often do you see the team rejoice
[19:11] when they lose and they do bad
[19:15] no you don't they start booing the
[19:17] quarterback
[19:19] the goalie
[19:24] not a christian
[19:26] just because something goes wrong no
[19:28] he's instructed to go help somebody amen
[19:31] to steam others better than themselves
[19:34] to wash feet
[19:36] if a righteous man falls seven times
[19:39] let's help him back up seven times
[19:44] somebody's done you wrong forgive him
[19:46] once twice three times let's go seven
[19:49] hey no let's not stop there let's go
[19:52] 490.
[19:56] it's that's the mind of christ
[20:01] and we're to rejoice doing it
[20:05] i wish not
[20:05] wasn't a christian you gotta do this
[20:09] the world is trying to be glad
[20:15] they're trying to be glad while leaving
[20:17] the lord out
[20:19] but you can't
[20:21] we don't want to be conformed to the
[20:23] world's way of rejoicing
[20:27] don't accept having to have
[20:28] circumstances right
[20:30] in your home
[20:34] with your job
[20:35] with your family
[20:37] with the bills
[20:39] that has nothing to do
[20:41] with rejoicing in the lord
[20:44] amen that's right
[20:46] you don't need evidence
[20:51] you have christ
[20:53] rejoice in the lord always he has made
[20:56] me glad not my bank account
[21:00] he has made me glad
[21:03] keep your eyes off your circumstances
[21:06] look to the lord for your joy
[21:10] he will keep the imperfect peace whose
[21:12] mind is stayed on thee
[21:14] for he had made them rejoice with great
[21:19] joy
[21:21] psalms 92 verse 4
[21:23] for thou lord has made me glad
[21:26] amen for thou lord has made me glad
[21:29] through
[21:30] thy work
[21:32] not my circumstances
[21:36] through thy work i will triumph in the
[21:39] works of thy hands
[21:41] what's god doing this morning he's
[21:43] working on us
[21:45] we will rejoice that he's dealing with
[21:47] our heart and he's calling us up higher
[21:52] rejoice in the lord always and again i
[21:54] say rejoice you know we've gotten so far
[21:56] away from rejoicing that we forgot what
[21:59] it feels like
[22:04] remain glad everywhere at all times
[22:08] dwell in the state
[22:10] of god's joy
[22:13] don't settle for worldly happiness i'll
[22:15] tell you
[22:16] it's it's fun but it's so short-lived
[22:20] it's so short-lived
[22:24] i mean
[22:26] even sarcasm laughing about somebody
[22:30] something
[22:31] it's good for the moment
[22:33] but 60 seconds later you feel bad about
[22:36] it
[22:38] it's because you're not rejoicing in the
[22:40] lord
[22:41] amen
[22:45] doesn't the bible say that are rejoicing
[22:54] are rejoicing in that we
[22:57] sin james you're rejoicing is
[23:00] you're boasting you're rejoicing
[23:03] just don't rejoice in the world okay
[23:05] that's all i'm trying to say that's the
[23:07] point i'm trying to say
[23:11] paul writing this letter that we read
[23:13] here out of
[23:14] of philippians
[23:17] held to his conviction
[23:19] that he who had begun a good work in him
[23:22] that he was going to
[23:24] keep working on it keep working on it
[23:26] until jesus returned
[23:29] he was settled on it
[23:31] he didn't write this letter from a
[23:34] resort with white sandy beaches
[23:38] he wrote it from a prison cell
[23:43] and i'm sure the circumstances were
[23:46] really bad
[23:49] terrible circumstances
[23:52] but paul wasn't staring at the
[23:54] circumstances
[23:57] because
[23:59] he
[24:00] was made glad by god
[24:02] and that's why he could say rejoice in
[24:05] the lord always and again i say rejoice
[24:09] you know too often we're having a good
[24:11] time we're in a good mood we feel good
[24:13] and we're trying to hey what's wrong
[24:15] with everybody else
[24:23] some people have a hard time rejoicing
[24:26] when things aren't going the way they
[24:28] want them to go
[24:33] despite prison and being beaten and
[24:35] hated and persecuted used and abused and
[24:38] cast out such terrible circumstances
[24:42] but paul knew
[24:43] that everything was working out for his
[24:45] good
[24:49] that wasn't just a scripture to quote
[24:50] what you wanted it was real to him
[24:56] he committed himself to god's eternal
[24:59] purpose
[25:02] rejoice in the lord always
[25:05] because god
[25:07] makes us glad
[25:11] god has called us for a greater purpose
[25:13] than just the stuff that happens to us
[25:15] naturally
[25:16] our goals and our our desires and what
[25:19] we're plans are what we want to do and
[25:21] even our attempts to do something uh we
[25:24] save for the lord but it can be carnal
[25:30] paul wasn't the only one
[25:32] that had terrible circumstances
[25:35] look at the apostles in acts chapter 5
[25:37] verse 40 and to him they agreed
[25:40] and when they called the apostles and
[25:43] beaten them and commanded them that they
[25:45] should not speak in the name of jesus
[25:48] and let them go
[25:50] they departed from the presence of the
[25:52] council
[25:53] rejoicing
[25:55] not talking about how bad they were
[25:59] but rejoicing that they were counted
[26:02] worthy to suffer for the shame
[26:06] suffer shame for his name
[26:13] see is a a a natural a human being
[26:17] that's walking carnally in the flesh
[26:21] oh this isn't worthy of my thanksgiving
[26:24] this is not worthy of my appreciation
[26:29] but they were in the presence of god
[26:32] because the presence of god was staying
[26:34] with them even though they were in the
[26:36] presence of the council the presence of
[26:38] god was still inside of them
[26:42] they weren't looking at
[26:43] what they were going to give them
[26:45] to rejoice in
[26:47] hey you got front row tickets
[26:51] no you got front row beatings
[26:55] it doesn't matter god greater is he
[26:57] that's in me then than he that's in the
[26:59] world
[27:02] how could a man be stoned like stephen
[27:08] the glory of god shining forth from him
[27:12] something inside of him saying father
[27:14] forgive them they don't know really what
[27:16] they're doing
[27:18] because there was something greater
[27:20] inside of him than outside circumstances
[27:24] saints we need to learn to get into this
[27:25] presence get our joy from the lord
[27:29] it's a real thing
[27:37] that verse 42 and daily in the temple
[27:39] and in every house they ceased not to
[27:41] teach and to preach jesus christ it
[27:44] didn't stop them from spreading the word
[27:47] persecution shouldn't stop you from
[27:48] spreading the word
[27:50] apostles had a revelation of 8 romans 8
[27:53] 28.
[27:55] they were called for a greater purpose
[28:00] acts chapter 16 verse 22
[28:04] you know i say like this the apostles
[28:06] they and paul they loved fulfilling the
[28:09] purpose of god
[28:13] that's why they didn't mind suffering
[28:15] why because they knew
[28:18] that eternal life was going to come
[28:19] forth from their labors
[28:22] somebody was going to get saved
[28:25] that is the eternal purpose of god
[28:28] acts chapter 16 verse 22 and the
[28:31] multitude rose up early against them and
[28:33] the
[28:34] magistrates rent off their clothes and
[28:37] commanded to beat them
[28:40] and when they had laid many stripes upon
[28:42] them and cast him to the prison charging
[28:44] the jailer to keep them safely who
[28:46] having received such a charge thrust
[28:49] them to the inner prison and made their
[28:50] feet
[28:52] fast in the stocks but tell you these
[28:54] are some more terrible circumstances
[28:56] aren't they
[29:01] but look what happened
[29:03] at midnight
[29:05] there were two people
[29:07] filled with the holy ghost
[29:11] they prayed
[29:14] and they sang praises
[29:16] unto god
[29:18] why did they sing praises
[29:20] because god had made them glad
[29:25] you can look at your circumstances
[29:28] or you can look to the god inside amen
[29:33] and whatever you look at is whatever
[29:35] you're going to express
[29:40] that's why we got to keep our eyes on
[29:42] the promise amen no man the bible says
[29:45] that no man can take your joy away
[29:48] now you can forfeit it
[29:50] to worldly pleasures
[29:54] no man can take it
[29:55] jesus said in john chapter 16 verse 22
[29:59] you know
[30:00] therefore i says you now therefore have
[30:02] sorrow but i will see you again
[30:06] and your heart shall rejoice and your
[30:09] joy no man
[30:11] taketh from you now that's a promise of
[30:14] jesus christ you either stand on the
[30:16] promise or you call god's word a liar
[30:21] we all here should be filled with the
[30:23] joy of the lord
[30:26] amen
[30:27] the world will drain you
[30:30] circumstances will drain you
[30:32] but god is here to fill us up
[30:35] god is here to make us glad
[30:37] god is here to take us through
[30:41] but you know what is needed just a heart
[30:44] to believe the word
[30:46] that god is speaking directly to me
[30:49] most people want to sit in church and
[30:51] when they see eighty percent of the
[30:53] people say yes i got it now then they'll
[30:56] think seriously maybe i should try to
[30:57] get it
[31:00] seriously
[31:01] that's how we sit in church
[31:06] but god only needs one
[31:10] one man on fire
[31:12] one man to believe it
[31:15] won't you be the one to take god's word
[31:17] seriously amen
[31:19] won't you be the one to say god wants me
[31:22] to be filled with joy god wants me to be
[31:24] glad i receive that lord i receive it
[31:27] from you
[31:32] oftentimes when someone does this wrong
[31:34] our old worldly nature
[31:36] wants to just get back at them some way
[31:40] right just
[31:42] you'll be standoffish
[31:49] first thessalonians chapter 5 verse 15
[31:53] as if
[31:54] someone stoled your joy because they did
[31:57] something to you
[31:59] shame on you
[32:01] shame on you
[32:05] god gives us something greater than that
[32:09] see that none render evil for evil unto
[32:12] any man
[32:15] but ever follow that which is good
[32:18] both
[32:20] among yourselves
[32:21] here in the church
[32:24] and to all men out in the world
[32:28] rejoice ever more
[32:33] don't be picky choosy
[32:40] don't be picky choosy about what songs
[32:42] are song whether
[32:44] how the song service went how the
[32:46] preaching went
[32:48] as if that has anything to do with you
[32:50] and your relationship with god
[32:54] that ought to be stronger than anything
[32:56] you ought to be bringing a greater
[32:58] presence to the church to make it better
[33:03] amen
[33:04] rejoice evermore at all times rejoice
[33:09] don't be happy
[33:11] be joyful
[33:13] you're happy it'll stop
[33:17] i mean
[33:18] you can go to
[33:20] places and
[33:21] you know
[33:22] they'll just tell jokes and you'll laugh
[33:24] for an hour
[33:28] and when it's over
[33:29] you're over
[33:33] but spend an hour in the presence of god
[33:38] they don't don't stop when it's over
[33:42] and the joy of the lord's our strength
[33:44] we need the joy
[33:47] rejoice ever more pray without ceasing
[33:50] in everything give thanks
[33:53] for this is god's will
[33:57] for the church
[34:00] the bible says
[34:01] concerning you
[34:04] concerning you
[34:07] who cares about the person you're
[34:10] sitting next to
[34:12] when it comes to the joy of the lord
[34:14] you
[34:15] you be the one that takes the joy
[34:19] and if we all become that determined i'm
[34:21] not saying not care about one another
[34:23] but the prophet did say if there's only
[34:25] one going to make it in that city you
[34:26] make sure you're that one
[34:30] so you have to get that serious about it
[34:32] you know if you get full of joy you will
[34:34] be able to help the person sitting next
[34:36] to you
[34:38] don't wait for some preacher to come by
[34:40] and make you feel good for about an hour
[34:43] and 40 minutes
[34:46] and then go home and continue to do the
[34:48] same things that brought your that took
[34:49] your joy away to begin with
[34:54] we're talking about something that stays
[34:56] with you 24 7.
[34:58] seven days a week
[35:00] 30 days a month
[35:03] 12 months a year
[35:06] get everything give thanks
[35:08] take it personally because it's
[35:09] concerning you and it's not my will
[35:13] not preaching my wealth this is god's
[35:15] will
[35:18] if we stop judging circumstances worthy
[35:23] enough for our gratitude
[35:26] worthy enough
[35:29] for our rejoicing
[35:32] and take the scriptures personally
[35:35] if we humble ourselves to do all things
[35:38] without murmuring and complaining
[35:41] if we just accept the will of god for
[35:43] our lives that in everything we're to
[35:45] give thanks it will make a difference
[35:56] you
[35:57] to god's word
[36:01] let him make you glad
[36:05] if i
[36:07] could do whatever i wanted to do
[36:10] in my flesh
[36:13] and still be glad in the lord
[36:16] oh i would try to do it
[36:19] and so would you how do i know that
[36:21] because we try to do it all the time
[36:27] we can't it won't work
[36:29] might be happy for a little bit but
[36:31] god is looking to have all of us
[36:35] all the time
[36:36] to do his will all the time it's a
[36:38] different life because we're not of this
[36:41] world
[36:45] when you're going through trials
[36:47] learn to give thanks
[36:50] when you're suffering learn to give
[36:52] thanks when you're asked to do something
[36:56] learn to give thanks
[36:58] don't say well it depends
[37:03] live by the sixth sense believe god is
[37:06] in it
[37:10] rejoice in everything give thanks
[37:14] look what peter said in first peter
[37:15] chapter 4 verse 12
[37:18] beloved think it not strange concerning
[37:21] the fiery trial
[37:24] which is to try you
[37:28] as though some strange thing happened
[37:29] unto you why do we think it's strange
[37:33] because we don't want it we didn't ask
[37:35] for it
[37:37] we had never prayed for it
[37:41] but you know what we need it
[37:48] here's what we need to do when we
[37:50] recognize that we're
[37:52] going through a trial
[37:54] rejoice
[37:56] rejoice
[37:57] in as much as you are a partaker
[38:01] of christ's
[38:03] sufferings what an honor
[38:05] he suffered for me
[38:07] it's about to honor
[38:08] to be able to suffer
[38:10] and be a partaker of that suffering
[38:13] that's an honor
[38:17] that when his glory shall be revealed
[38:20] you may be glad also with exceeding joy
[38:26] how many times you you go through a
[38:28] child you realize
[38:30] god
[38:31] was there
[38:37] i'm sure those
[38:39] three hebrew children were in there in
[38:40] the fiery furnace
[38:43] they weren't talking to jesus like this
[38:45] what'd you make us go through i thought
[38:47] we were yours
[38:50] i think there was a rejoicing going on
[38:53] there was great joy in their heart that
[38:55] god had not left them god had not
[38:57] forsaken them that god was going to see
[38:59] them even in the middle of this trial
[39:05] god is wanting us to have faith
[39:08] in our situations
[39:10] instead of questioning our situations
[39:19] i feel like saying amen
[39:23] if ye be reproached for the name of
[39:25] christ happy are you
[39:28] you ever get reproached and you're not
[39:30] happy
[39:33] but if you get reproached for the name
[39:35] of christ you're happy
[39:37] for the spirit of glory and of god
[39:40] resteth upon
[39:43] you
[39:44] on their part is evil spoken of but on
[39:46] your part he's glorified
[39:49] you have a different attitude than they
[39:50] do
[39:52] first peter chapter one verse five first
[39:54] peter chapter 1 verse 5
[39:56] we are kept by the power of god
[40:01] in only one avenue
[40:03] through faith that's the only world will
[40:05] ever be kept is you've got to believe
[40:09] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[40:11] revealed
[40:13] in the last time how many believers were
[40:14] in the last time
[40:16] wherein you greatly
[40:18] rejoice
[40:20] not just a a beanie peasy little bit at
[40:22] church
[40:24] but you greatly rejoice
[40:26] though now
[40:28] through now no though now for a season
[40:30] if need be ye are in heaviness through
[40:33] manifold temptation i mean the darts are
[40:35] coming from every angle
[40:38] that the trial of your faith
[40:42] it's much more
[40:43] precious
[40:44] than anything that you can think of on
[40:46] this world
[40:48] more precious than of gold that perish
[40:51] though it be tried with fire it might be
[40:53] found unto praise
[40:55] and honor
[40:57] and glory at the appearing of jesus
[41:00] christ
[41:02] look at this whom having not seen
[41:05] we love think about this
[41:08] we are to fall in love with jesus christ
[41:12] somebody we have not seen
[41:17] the way we fall in love with jesus
[41:19] christ is to fall in love with his word
[41:23] that is the way you fall in love with
[41:24] somebody
[41:26] i mean think about this if we're going
[41:28] to have some sort of dating app and
[41:30] we're going to go there my name is so-so
[41:32] i've got blue eyes i'm this tall on this
[41:34] way this is my hobby this is what it man
[41:37] i don't like this i don't but i like
[41:39] this and that and before you somebody's
[41:41] on the other side says oh they they they
[41:44] like to go uh hiking i like that oh they
[41:47] like to they they like to go canoeing
[41:49] they they like baseball you know what
[41:51] that's my type of person
[42:00] they're reading god's word amen
[42:04] something inside says that connects with
[42:07] me that's what i'm looking for
[42:10] it matches my type that's my type
[42:17] too often we're wanting the word to be
[42:18] something different than what it is
[42:20] that's why we get in the part where we
[42:22] we
[42:23] pick certain scriptures ignore others
[42:26] pick certain quotes ignore others pick
[42:28] certain preachers ignore others and
[42:30] before you know it we make something
[42:32] that it's not
[42:45] we in
[42:47] whom having not seen we love
[42:50] in whom though now we see him not yet we
[42:53] believe the word
[42:55] he rejoiced with joy unspeakable and
[42:59] full of glory amen
[43:02] you don't need me to to rejoice
[43:06] you don't need circumstances to be right
[43:08] you don't need anything to be right
[43:11] just god
[43:12] you you be right with god
[43:16] get in his presence say god fill me fill
[43:19] me not being satisfied with how much you
[43:21] got
[43:23] be hungry for more be thirsty you want
[43:25] to be full of glory joy and speak of
[43:28] full glory
[43:31] not just a little bit
[43:33] receiving the end of your faith even the
[43:36] salvation of your souls
[43:40] if you believe
[43:42] then rejoice
[43:44] rejoice
[43:47] look at all the pain and suffering jesus
[43:49] went through
[43:50] yet he was full of joy
[43:54] and that joy was never driven
[43:56] by outward circumstances
[43:59] it was driven by an inward circumstance
[44:04] amen
[44:05] he had the father's joy in his heart
[44:09] for god so loved the world that he gave
[44:11] his only begotten son he was out to do
[44:13] the work of the father
[44:16] the bible says for the joy that was set
[44:19] before him he endured the cross
[44:24] something inside of him
[44:27] he was able to be so full of joy that it
[44:29] gave him strength
[44:32] to give his life
[44:34] that we could sit here one day
[44:36] and know him
[44:42] he operated
[44:44] by the sixth sense of faith
[44:47] it wasn't like i don't deem this
[44:50] um
[44:51] worthy
[44:52] of rejoicing in my thanksgiving my
[44:55] appreciation
[44:56] i don't think i'm sorry i'm out of here
[45:00] no he wasn't carnal christian
[45:05] he saw something inside he had a vision
[45:09] for souls
[45:11] yes
[45:13] god give us that burden give us that
[45:15] vision
[45:16] he chose to endure the cross for you and
[45:20] i he wasn't ashamed to call his brethren
[45:24] too often we're ashamed to be associated
[45:26] with somebody because we don't like
[45:28] something about somebody
[45:31] shame on us
[45:33] shame on us we should be washing their
[45:35] feet we should be helping them we should
[45:37] be so full of the love of god amen
[45:44] it shouldn't be just something preached
[45:45] from the pulpit it should be something
[45:47] preached by the body
[45:49] amen
[45:50] not judging the body saying this one
[45:52] don't got it that no god look what they
[45:54] did who cares satan can do that
[45:58] he's an accuser of the brethren
[46:01] looking for somebody that would get on
[46:03] their knees care about somebody have a
[46:06] burden build the wall build the body get
[46:09] the rejoicing going
[46:13] psalm 16 verse 8 i have set the lord
[46:16] always before me
[46:17] because he's at my right hand
[46:20] i shall not be moved
[46:22] therefore my heart is glad my glory
[46:25] rejoices my flesh also shall rest in
[46:27] hope
[46:29] for thou will not leave my soul in hell
[46:32] neither will thou suffer thine holy one
[46:35] to see corruption
[46:39] that will show me the path of life and
[46:42] in thy presence is fullness of joy
[46:45] at thy right hand there are pleasures
[46:47] forevermore
[46:50] don't you want to be in the right hand
[46:51] of god
[46:56] i'll tell you
[46:58] there's no moodiness there
[47:02] let's take a look here at matthew
[47:04] chapter 20 21 15.
[47:08] you don't have to know the lord very
[47:10] long
[47:14] to get in his presence
[47:16] to feel the joy of the lord
[47:18] to to to to get the benefits of of
[47:21] rejoicing
[47:23] the bible says that when the chief
[47:24] priests and the scribes saw that saw the
[47:26] wonderful things that jesus did
[47:29] the children crying in the temple
[47:32] saying hosanna
[47:34] to the son of david
[47:36] they were so displeased
[47:38] you ever come into church
[47:42] somebody is kind of quiet and somebody's
[47:44] really trying to enter in
[47:46] and you're sitting there
[47:48] and you keep going
[47:54] like come on
[47:57] you know what i'm talking about
[47:59] how about somebody gets back from a
[48:01] men's meeting
[48:04] gets back from a special service and
[48:07] and they're really trying
[48:11] to put forth an effort to build an
[48:13] atmosphere
[48:15] and the majority are just
[48:18] that's
[48:23] well that's what was happening in this
[48:24] situation
[48:28] they were so displeased because they
[48:31] themselves weren't in the same mood
[48:35] they didn't have the same
[48:37] rejoicing going on
[48:43] and said unto him
[48:45] hearst thou what these say
[48:49] and jesus said unto them yea have ye
[48:52] never read out of the mouth of babes and
[48:54] sucklings thou has perfected praise
[49:00] now this word perfected it means repair
[49:04] or to restore
[49:06] are you with me
[49:07] i think we need to repair and to restore
[49:11] our praise to god
[49:14] i don't think we should wait
[49:17] until you feel the circumstances just
[49:20] right
[49:22] what kind of relationship is that with
[49:24] your god
[49:27] i'm just gonna wait
[49:29] i'm just
[49:30] you don't need to wait to rejoice
[49:33] you don't need to wait to praise
[49:36] all you need to do is breathe
[49:38] all ye that have breath praise ye the
[49:40] lord
[49:41] he's worthy of all praise at all times
[49:45] his praise shall continually
[49:48] be in my mouth
[49:49] continually
[49:54] we have a church to dedicate
[49:57] we have our lives to rededicate amen
[50:01] and we need to prepare with proper
[50:03] worship
[50:05] it's easy to worship with our lips
[50:08] you're the old saying in the world
[50:10] put your money where your lips are at
[50:12] your mouth is that
[50:14] i need i believe we as christians we
[50:16] need to put our life where our mouth is
[50:17] at
[50:21] i always remember
[50:23] never can't forget brother johnson i'm
[50:24] sure brother bruce
[50:26] remembers brother johnson would say
[50:28] it's not my notes but
[50:30] he would say don't ever jump higher than
[50:32] you can walk
[50:36] make sure you can walk the talk
[50:42] i'm okay with jumping i'm okay with sean
[50:44] i'm okay with having a great time i'm
[50:46] not okay with it just being left at
[50:47] church
[50:49] take it home
[50:51] take it home keep rejoicing keep jumping
[50:54] keep bringing christ to those in the
[50:56] home around you your neighbors
[50:59] spread the gospel make it real
[51:06] true worship isn't for babies
[51:10] look at all what the disciples had to go
[51:13] through all their sufferings
[51:15] timothy was wanting his worship to god
[51:18] to be without
[51:20] suffering and so was peter before he got
[51:23] the holy ghost
[51:27] we are not going to have this in our
[51:28] church
[51:30] you're going to do this i'm going to
[51:31] find another place
[51:35] imagine how long suffering god has to be
[51:38] with us
[51:39] he's trying to get the truth to us
[51:42] now our flesh doesn't want it
[51:45] but we get inoculated with the holy
[51:47] ghost
[51:48] we can't sit still with it
[51:53] you just got to tell somebody about the
[51:55] love of god
[51:59] god has high expectations for worship
[52:02] given to him
[52:04] we must always remember as humans we
[52:06] live in a physical realm that's subject
[52:08] to emotions and feelings
[52:11] sometimes we don't feel like worshipping
[52:13] god let me reword that the majority of
[52:16] the time we come to church we don't feel
[52:18] like it
[52:20] and then we put all the pressure
[52:23] on the song leader up here
[52:28] come on
[52:30] because we don't feel like it
[52:34] he's got to do a better job than that if
[52:36] i'm going to worship
[52:41] where is your relationship with god amen
[52:45] is this how you're going to treat him
[52:47] because you don't feel like it
[52:50] i tell you true worship is not for
[52:52] babies
[52:55] anybody can worship and offer a
[52:57] sacrifice when they feel like it that's
[52:59] right
[53:01] but try praising god when everything the
[53:03] bottom falls out
[53:06] try trusting him
[53:08] try singing all as well and meaning it
[53:10] because you're a believer
[53:16] john chapter 4 verse 24 john chapter 4
[53:19] verse 24 god is a
[53:22] spirit
[53:23] even though we're humans we come in with
[53:25] feelings of emotion and baggage get it
[53:27] off
[53:29] because we're going to meet god in
[53:30] spirit form
[53:32] come on god is the spirit and they that
[53:35] worship him must it's an absolute must
[53:40] i don't have to it'll never reach him
[53:47] they that worship him must worship him
[53:49] in spirit
[53:50] and in truth what do you say about that
[53:53] you know not what you worship you know
[53:55] you know what's going on
[53:57] you think
[53:59] you think you know what you worship
[54:05] in spirit means out of flesh
[54:08] try to keep it simple in truth means all
[54:11] that god is
[54:13] get to a place where it's all god
[54:16] that's all you see
[54:18] it's him
[54:19] only him
[54:21] i know there's other people in the room
[54:23] i know things are but i'm so in tune
[54:25] with him it's all him right now
[54:27] take me lord take me lord
[54:31] that's the spirit we need to get into
[54:33] the spirit of the word
[54:37] out of our emotions and feelings out of
[54:39] our
[54:40] circumstance-driven
[54:43] attitude and into the realm of god's
[54:45] spirit where faith can see that god has
[54:48] complete control of what's happening
[54:50] right now
[54:52] complete control
[54:54] he's doing something here i don't know
[54:56] what he's doing we're getting tuned
[54:59] get out of the flesh get in tune
[55:01] god wants to do something in us
[55:04] jesus said in verse 23 now the same
[55:07] chapter
[55:08] the hour cometh and
[55:11] now is
[55:12] now is
[55:14] that's right this second
[55:15] now is when the true worshiper shall
[55:18] worship the father in spirit and in true
[55:21] for the father is looking right
[55:25] he's coming down every aisle he's
[55:27] looking
[55:31] will you be the one will you be the one
[55:35] to step out of your flesh
[55:37] say lord i'm sorry for my carnality
[55:39] today
[55:40] but i just want to worship you why
[55:42] because you're worthy
[55:45] not because we had a good day a good
[55:47] week
[55:48] but you're worthy
[55:51] i don't care what how hard your week was
[55:54] i don't care how you feel i don't care
[55:55] how sick you are he's worthy he's worthy
[55:58] get your eyes on jesus he's worthy
[56:01] he's worthy of all praise i feel like a
[56:03] hypocrite praise him anyways he's worthy
[56:09] don't put your
[56:11] yourself
[56:13] in a place
[56:14] where you think it doesn't deem worthy
[56:19] why we have fallen
[56:22] we're talking about grace here
[56:27] when you first got saved
[56:29] he didn't say well let's just stick this
[56:31] thing through
[56:33] no something inside of you was bubbling
[56:35] it's a bubble in i gotta praise him you
[56:38] weren't thinking about how bad you were
[56:41] you were thinking about how much he
[56:43] saved you from your badness
[56:45] he's here to do the same his mercies are
[56:47] new every day
[56:50] just
[56:51] enter into the spirit
[56:53] we want to dedicate this church with the
[56:55] right spirit the right attitude
[56:58] want to dedicate our our lives to to
[57:01] never look back to never go where we
[57:03] came from we're heading into in the in
[57:06] a forward direction
[57:11] don't just sit here and be a part be the
[57:13] part
[57:15] let god use you
[57:18] marching in the symphony that god you
[57:21] have a part to play in this church
[57:24] play that part come with all your heart
[57:27] amen
[57:32] be a true servant
[57:35] and serve
[57:37] serve
[57:38] that's what they do they serve
[57:41] they're not served they sir
[57:44] we're all servants of god
[57:46] we all serve
[57:49] get our thoughts away i deserve i need i
[57:53] pretty soon you're going to deem things
[57:55] worthy or not worthy of your
[57:56] thanksgiving
[57:59] there are two completely different
[58:01] sacrifices that we need to offer to god
[58:05] one
[58:06] the sacrifice of praise
[58:09] to
[58:10] the sacrifice of our lives
[58:13] hebrews chapter 13 verse 15 says by him
[58:17] therefore
[58:18] let us offer the sacrifice
[58:21] of praise
[58:22] to god
[58:24] once
[58:26] you feel good
[58:28] once in a while
[58:30] at church
[58:31] periodically
[58:35] offer the sacrifice of praise to god
[58:38] continually
[58:40] what does that mean that is the fruit of
[58:42] our lips
[58:43] giving thanks unto his name
[58:46] thank you lord thank you lord thank you
[58:48] lord thank you lord i'll never forget
[58:50] this
[58:50] brother johnson was preaching one time
[58:54] and i guess he had maybe got done
[58:55] preaching
[58:56] a a service on being thankful or
[58:59] something along those lines
[59:01] and that night he was
[59:03] by the fire and i don't know if he was
[59:05] doing marshmallows or what it was
[59:07] but it seemed like one of the
[59:08] marshmallows popped
[59:10] came
[59:13] right on his eye and the devil came in
[59:14] and said well
[59:16] what are you going to be thankful about
[59:17] that for
[59:19] he says
[59:20] devil i'm thankful that it didn't get in
[59:22] my eye
[59:25] find something to give thanks for
[59:28] there's always something if you've got a
[59:31] spirit of thanksgiving in you
[59:34] the whole world judges deeming things
[59:37] whether they're worthy of our
[59:39] thanksgiving or not but we're not of the
[59:41] world
[59:42] we're christians and we need to rise up
[59:47] i'm thankful that we're here
[59:50] but you know what i don't i don't mean
[59:52] this building now
[59:54] i'm thankful that we're here but i don't
[59:55] want to be here i want to be a bear
[59:57] i want to be in this image i want to be
[59:59] in his lightness
[1:00:02] i want to handle life the way he does
[1:00:05] i want to think the way he thinks
[1:00:07] you know he's he knows all the evil
[1:00:09] that's going on in the world but he
[1:00:10] don't sit there and dwell on it
[1:00:13] not about knowing the evil
[1:00:16] he's he's still
[1:00:18] his mind is looking for the seed that
[1:00:21] hasn't come in yet
[1:00:26] it isn't about making a little bit of
[1:00:28] your time through the week to try to
[1:00:30] help in that scenario help god out
[1:00:33] friends it's about being sold out to an
[1:00:35] eternal purpose it's about being called
[1:00:37] to his eternal purpose and if we can
[1:00:39] love god that much that we give our
[1:00:41] lives to god
[1:00:47] how can we have the joy of the lord
[1:00:51] and not be committed to god
[1:00:59] don't try to get by
[1:01:01] day after day with just happiness to
[1:01:02] happiness to happiness
[1:01:05] you'll be searching
[1:01:07] like a
[1:01:08] gerbil in a scroll cage
[1:01:11] durable cage
[1:01:13] you know what i'm trying to say they
[1:01:14] just go around around chasing their tail
[1:01:16] get nowhere
[1:01:18] there's something more everlasting
[1:01:22] and it's right here inside it's about
[1:01:24] your relationship with god inside
[1:01:28] now he may ask you to do something just
[1:01:30] do it
[1:01:32] just do it
[1:01:35] he may ask you to stop doing just stop
[1:01:37] doing it
[1:01:40] i mean i should just start spending some
[1:01:42] time with him just spend time with him
[1:01:46] don't make it complicated
[1:01:50] he's here to take our complicated lives
[1:01:53] and simplify them
[1:01:56] he's here to take our our complexity of
[1:01:59] i just got so many things going on i
[1:02:01] just i just and make them peaceful
[1:02:07] this up and down happiness and give us a
[1:02:09] steady joy
[1:02:13] full glory
[1:02:15] his glory
[1:02:17] all right number two the sacrifice of
[1:02:19] our lives romans
[1:02:20] chapter
[1:02:21] 12
[1:02:22] verse 1 i beseech you therefore brethren
[1:02:25] by the mercies of god
[1:02:27] that you offer
[1:02:29] or present
[1:02:31] your bodies
[1:02:32] a living sacrifice
[1:02:36] holy and acceptable in god which is your
[1:02:39] reasonable
[1:02:41] service
[1:02:44] and i'll tell you what this we really
[1:02:46] prove true worship
[1:02:50] um i think honestly if we can't come in
[1:02:53] here
[1:02:54] and give our all in worship i question
[1:02:57] what's happening outside
[1:03:03] look
[1:03:04] the devil would like to bring us down
[1:03:07] amen
[1:03:09] till we come to the place of a carnal
[1:03:13] former
[1:03:14] church
[1:03:16] that's man directed
[1:03:19] with no moving of the holy ghost
[1:03:22] don't let god
[1:03:24] don't let the devil use you
[1:03:28] don't settle for this wherever you think
[1:03:31] we are and i know you all are rejoicing
[1:03:33] because we have this nice church and you
[1:03:35] should but don't settle
[1:03:37] don't settle for this just because this
[1:03:40] is better than that don't settle
[1:03:43] the beauty of the church is the
[1:03:45] character of the people we need to get
[1:03:48] characterized
[1:03:51] i need more of his character
[1:03:55] i wake up in the morning with aches and
[1:03:56] pains i want to wake up in his lightness
[1:04:00] i wake up with wrong thoughts i want to
[1:04:02] wake up with the right ones
[1:04:07] every time somebody comes into your mind
[1:04:09] give thanks
[1:04:11] pray for them give thanks
[1:04:13] don't sit there as a judge and say well
[1:04:15] this is worthy or this is not worthy
[1:04:18] just do what god does
[1:04:24] offer
[1:04:25] your body a living sacrifice
[1:04:28] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:04:30] acceptable and perfect will of god amen
[1:04:33] jeremiah chapter 33 verse 11 jeremiah 33
[1:04:36] verse 11 the voice of joy the voice of
[1:04:39] gladness the voice of the bridegroom the
[1:04:42] voice of the bride
[1:04:45] the voice of them that say
[1:04:47] shall say
[1:04:49] a voice of them that shall say praise
[1:04:51] the lord of hosts
[1:04:55] i think there ought to be a unison here
[1:04:58] god wants us to praise him
[1:05:01] i believe the voice of the bride praises
[1:05:03] him
[1:05:04] for the lord is good
[1:05:06] for his mercy endureth forever
[1:05:09] and a then that shall bring this
[1:05:11] sacrifice of praise into the house of
[1:05:14] the lord
[1:05:16] did you bring it
[1:05:18] did you bring it
[1:05:22] don't wait to get here
[1:05:25] start building it before you get here
[1:05:27] bring it with you
[1:05:31] i
[1:05:32] brought my wallet
[1:05:38] i didn't bring my phone
[1:05:41] i had to ask
[1:05:44] brother mike
[1:05:45] to text my wife and
[1:05:47] bring my phone because i didn't bring it
[1:05:50] now either i brought my phone or
[1:05:52] identity i brought my wallet or dinner i
[1:05:54] bring my praise and i don't
[1:05:57] you don't assume
[1:05:59] i didn't bring my phone i assumed i did
[1:06:02] but i did it don't assume that you
[1:06:05] brought your praise
[1:06:07] bring your praise be able to pull it out
[1:06:10] and say here it is
[1:06:11] praise you the lord
[1:06:13] in the house of the lord he wants to be
[1:06:15] praised here this church is getting
[1:06:17] dedicated to the lord
[1:06:20] make it the way he wants it
[1:06:23] don't bring god down here
[1:06:26] come up in the heavenly places
[1:06:29] lift the name of the
[1:06:30] lord his name is a high tower the
[1:06:33] righteous run into it and they're safe
[1:06:35] we don't come here to work on our
[1:06:37] natural problems we come here to work on
[1:06:38] our spiritual problems
[1:06:43] the whole world is full of places you
[1:06:44] can go take care of natural needs
[1:06:47] now i'm not saying god don't care about
[1:06:49] him all he does but don't lower him to
[1:06:50] just be concerned about that
[1:06:53] he's getting a bride ready
[1:06:55] amen he's getting a bride ready for a
[1:06:56] rapture
[1:07:04] psalms 105 verse 43 43 and he brought
[1:07:08] forth his people
[1:07:11] with joy
[1:07:14] and is chosen
[1:07:15] with gladness now noticed
[1:07:17] he
[1:07:18] brought forth in other words he's the
[1:07:20] one that made them glad
[1:07:22] i say it like this when you make a
[1:07:24] decision that you're going to stop
[1:07:26] deeming whether things are worthy in
[1:07:28] your eyes to be grateful or not
[1:07:31] put that
[1:07:32] that childish when i was a child i
[1:07:34] thought as a child i put away childish
[1:07:36] things
[1:07:38] and start praising god and thanking him
[1:07:40] because he's worthy
[1:07:43] because the scriptures tell us he
[1:07:45] brought forth his people with joy and is
[1:07:48] chosen with gladness
[1:07:51] isaiah 63 verse 3 i'm sorry isaiah 61

[1:08:21] when they get to church
[1:08:23] and say god take this vile life of mine
[1:08:26] make it mourn your image
[1:08:29] to give unto them the
[1:08:32] give them beauty
[1:08:34] for ashes
[1:08:36] the oil of joy for mourning
[1:08:39] the garment of praise
[1:08:42] for the spirit of heaviness
[1:08:45] that they might be called trees of
[1:08:48] righteousness
[1:08:49] the planting of the lord
[1:08:51] that he
[1:08:53] might be glorified
[1:08:56] isn't that beautiful what god can wants
[1:08:58] to do for us
[1:08:59] we just got to let go and let him have
[1:09:01] his way

[1:09:41] and two wings you know just

[1:09:48] will worship him that will reverence him
[1:09:50] that will humble themselves and who are
[1:09:52] we

[1:10:39] in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[1:10:41] hide me
[1:10:43] he shall set me up upon a rock
