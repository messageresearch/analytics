[36:44] uh first of all say happy Mother's Day.
[36:47] Amen.
[36:49] Going to say a few words about the
[36:51] mothers after we read the scriptures,
[36:52] but if you turn if you would turn with
[36:55] me into the book of Genesis this morning
[36:59] for our Mother's Day message. Genesis
[37:02] chapter 17 and or and then also chapter
[37:05] 35. Two scripture readings there.
[37:08] Brother Gideon want to pass his
[37:09] greetings along to the saints
[37:12] here
[37:15] and express
[37:17] his his thoughts towards us and his
[37:19] prayers and his appreciation for the
[37:22] church
[37:25] here.
[37:27] Amen. Amen. Before we begin reading here
[37:30] in God's book, let's look to him and
[37:32] just ask him to help us see the very
[37:35] intent that he has for us this morning.
[37:38] Our heavenly
[37:40] father, come to you, Lord, as that
[37:43] chorus that we just
[37:45] sang. Humbling
[37:48] ourselves, Lord, we know that
[37:51] you you give more grace the more we
[37:55] humble oursel.
[37:58] So Lord, it's our heart's desire and our
[38:01] prayer, our
[38:03] intent, our mind, our thoughts to humble
[38:05] ourselves at this moment that you
[38:08] would you would look down upon us in
[38:11] your mercy that you' forgive us of our
[38:13] sins and our trespasses
[38:15] today. Anything that would stand in the
[38:17] way of us being blessed by your amazing
[38:21] grace today. We need you, heavenly
[38:23] father.
[38:25] We need you and we're coming to you with
[38:29] confidence, Lord, that you're here to do
[38:33] exceedingly because it's your desire to
[38:35] see your wife
[38:40] victorious. And Lord, we're so thankful
[38:42] to be yours, to belong to you. You've
[38:46] chosen us. We we don't even know how or
[38:51] why
[38:53] or we just can't even see, but we're
[38:56] filled with thanksgiving this morning.
[38:58] Filled with gratitude to you. Now, Lord,
[39:01] we ask that you come and help our eyes
[39:04] to
[39:05] see, our ears to hear, our heart to be
[39:09] able to
[39:10] understand the things that you have for
[39:13] us today. that we might leave here
[39:15] strengthened,
[39:17] fortified, and all sure drawn to you. We
[39:21] give you the praise and the honor for
[39:22] it. Now, as we wait further upon thee,
[39:26] thy blessings and thy word in Jesus
[39:28] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Genesis
[39:32] chapter 17 starting with verse number
[39:35] one.
[39:38] And when Abram was 99 years old and
[39:43] nine, 90 years old and nine, the Lord
[39:45] appeared to Abram and said unto him, I
[39:49] am the Almighty God. Walk before me, and
[39:54] be thou
[39:55] perfect. I will make my covenant between
[39:59] me and thee, and will multiply thee
[40:04] exceedingly. Amen. Then chapter 25,
[40:09] uh, excuse me, chapter 35. Genesis
[40:11] chapter
[40:19] 35. We'll begin reading verse 11 and 12.
[40:24] And God said unto him, I am God
[40:27] Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply.
[40:31] A nation and a company of nations shall
[40:35] be of thee, and kings shall come out of
[40:38] thy loins. And the land which I gave
[40:41] Abraham, Isaac, to thee I will give it,
[40:44] and to thy seed after thee will I give
[40:47] the land. Amen. God bless you. May the
[40:50] Lord add his blessings to the reading of
[40:53] his word. The promise is unto you, to
[40:57] your children, to your children's
[40:59] children, as many as the Lord our God
[41:01] shall call. God has given us the
[41:04] spiritual seed of Abraham, a promise.
[41:09] And I believe the greater the revelation
[41:12] that we have of that, the greater we can
[41:15] become that. So, it's important that our
[41:18] vision is exactly what the word says.
[41:21] Well, I want to say God bless you to all
[41:22] of our mothers today.
[41:26] God never intended our mothers to be
[41:29] honored a day of the year.
[41:33] He intended them to be honored every day
[41:36] of the year.
[41:39] Every single day. And he even said he'd
[41:41] promise us if we would do that with
[41:44] longer life than what we'd normally
[41:46] have.
[41:48] showing how much it means to God that we
[41:52] naturally honor our our honor completely
[41:57] our natural mother and our
[41:59] father. Abraham Lincoln had a profound
[42:02] gratitude and admiration for his mother.
[42:06] He said, "All that I am or hope to be, I
[42:09] owe it to my angel mother."
[42:13] He said, "No man is poor that has a
[42:15] godly mother." Amen.
[42:19] He said, "The best thing a man can do
[42:21] for his
[42:22] children is to love their mother."
[42:27] So, I want to say, "God bless each of of
[42:29] our mothers today." Let's give them a a
[42:31] hand clapping. Amen.
[42:40] I think God has chosen us to be his
[42:44] wife, to be the one he multiplies and
[42:48] brings forth more of his
[42:51] seed. We are all blessed indeed
[42:55] today. Our scripture reading here, 24
[42:58] years after Abram began his journey from
[43:01] following God's call, the Lord appeared
[43:04] unto Abraham. He was 99 years old and he
[43:07] and Sarah were waxed old and well
[43:10] stricken. The Bible says and their flesh
[43:13] had no capability to perform the
[43:16] promise.
[43:18] And their flesh had no strength to
[43:20] perform the promise. Amen. No matter
[43:23] their desires there that the strength
[43:25] was not there. So the Lord appears to
[43:28] Abram and says, "I am El Shadi.
[43:32] I am the breasted one, the almighty God,
[43:36] the one that is able to nurture you, to
[43:39] give you nourishment in your body, to
[43:40] make you strong enough to manifest this
[43:44] promise. When I think of the most of us
[43:47] here at one time needed our mother's
[43:50] breast for
[43:52] nutrition, we were totally dependent
[43:55] upon our
[43:57] mother. It may taken a little bit
[44:00] sometimes maybe to get things going, but
[44:04] it was all uh natural after
[44:08] that. And when we get things moving with
[44:11] God, it
[44:12] becomes all super spiritual with that.
[44:16] Amen. Amen. Sometimes it's hard kind of
[44:19] getting connected where our strength
[44:20] comes from because we start going from
[44:22] pillar to post and leaning out on other
[44:24] people and looking for people to give us
[44:26] admiration to get us some partial
[44:28] strength. But really our strength comes
[44:30] from the Lord.
[44:33] A baby gets strength from its mother's
[44:35] milk. They say that every possible
[44:38] vitamin, mineral, nutrition needed for a
[44:40] baby's body is found in a mother's
[44:42] breast milk. Amen.
[44:45] Did you know a mother's milk is
[44:47] considered a living fluid? It isn't
[44:51] something you go to the store and you
[44:52] buy some formula. It's really considered
[44:55] a living form uh living fluid. It it uh
[44:59] constantly adapts to the baby's body's
[45:02] need. And when it's changing throughout
[45:05] the day and also changing uh throughout
[45:07] it its time that it's drinking milk as
[45:10] it's
[45:12] growing, the milk is filled with immune
[45:14] boosting substances including antibodies
[45:16] and
[45:18] HMOs that protect the baby from
[45:20] infections and help build a stronger
[45:23] immune system.
[45:25] So Abraham was 99 years old and he
[45:28] needed this. Right.
[45:32] Uh I just got a quote right before I I
[45:34] came up here and I just want to read
[45:41] this. He says, "Don't think you're past
[45:43] hope. You're
[45:44] not." Abraham when he was past age of
[45:47] hearing, God appeared to him and said,
[45:50] "I am Elshette, the Almighty God."
[45:52] Elshetted means the bosom. The the
[45:54] mother nurses her fretting child to
[45:57] health. No matter how old you are, how
[45:59] far you're gone, he's El Shad. Lean on
[46:02] his bosom and his word. Amen. And nurse
[46:06] from it. Draw from it till your body
[46:10] receives strength.
[46:20] And that's what God said to
[46:23] Abraham. I'm going to supply what you
[46:26] need. They're all your strength for me.
[46:28] I am the one that will provide strength
[46:30] needed to bring forth the
[46:33] promise because remember in himself he's
[46:36] just say how am I going to do this? I'm
[46:37] old. I've it's just like an impossible
[46:39] situation. We all look at our lives. How
[46:41] we how are we going to bring forth the
[46:43] image of Jesus Christ in these bodies
[46:45] with this nature that's warring against
[46:47] us and craving the wrong things and and
[46:49] not submitting to the things of God. But
[46:51] if we if we really wait on the Lord, we
[46:54] we spend time, we get our strength from
[46:56] him, we can we can we can we can we can
[47:02] Genesis
[47:03] 18:14. Is there anything too hard for
[47:06] the
[47:09] Lord? God said, "At the appointed time,
[47:11] I will return unto thee according to the
[47:13] time of life, and Sarah will have a
[47:17] son." Amen.
[47:19] The word of God is our strength. It's
[47:21] our rest. It's our final resting place.
[47:24] Hebrews 11:11 says, "Through faith also
[47:27] Sarah herself received strength to
[47:29] conceive
[47:30] seed and was delivered of the child when
[47:33] she was past age because she judged him
[47:37] faithful who had promised."
[47:40] Of course, when we look at Abraham and
[47:43] Isaac,
[47:44] we we think of the times of their
[47:47] battle, right?
[47:49] when they when they questioned as it
[47:51] were and and almost uh laughing as it
[47:56] were the scripture uses the word
[47:58] laughing that how can this
[48:02] happen and to the carnal mind to the to
[48:06] the person who is still stumbling it's
[48:09] hard for him to realize that he's going
[48:12] to be in the image of Jesus Christ
[48:15] and it almost wants to laugh at that
[48:17] promise But the Bible says that we shall
[48:20] overcome all things
[48:23] and and we have to do it through faith
[48:25] just the way Sarah did. It was through
[48:27] faith.
[48:29] First John 3:2 says, "Beloved, now we
[48:32] are the sons of God, and it does not yet
[48:35] appear what we shall be, but we know
[48:36] that when he shall appear, we shall be
[48:39] like him, for we shall see him like he
[48:42] is." And how's that going to happen?
[48:45] We're going to receive strength from God
[48:48] from conceiving the word of God into our
[48:50] lives. That's why it's so important when
[48:51] we come to church that we we're we're
[48:53] not just here. We're just not mentally
[48:56] agreeing with the word. We're not even
[48:58] just saying the word a amen to the word.
[49:01] But what we're doing is we're saying so
[49:03] be it into my heart and into my life.
[49:05] Let it come. Let thy word be born in me.
[49:09] Amen. Romans chapter 4:1
[49:12] 17. Romans chapter 4:1 17 we're going to
[49:16] read a few scriptures here 17-2 as is
[49:19] written I have made thee a father of
[49:22] many
[49:24] nations before him whom he believed even
[49:27] God who quickened the dead and calleth
[49:29] those things which be not as though they
[49:31] were we have to do the same thing I mean
[49:34] Jonah had to do the same thing
[49:37] everything else is a lion vanity this
[49:39] flesh is a lion vanity
[49:42] this this thing that is keeping me from
[49:44] getting ultimately close to God. It's a
[49:47] lying thing. It's it's it's it's
[49:49] vanity. And and did not say vanity
[49:52] vanity. All is vanity. Only only thing
[49:54] that is not vanity is what is eternal.
[49:57] God's love, God's word. That's what's
[49:59] eternal. And we need to become that
[50:03] not use that so we can have a better
[50:05] life.
[50:07] It's a different
[50:09] concept.
[50:10] Verse 18, who against hope believed in
[50:13] hope that he might become the father of
[50:16] many nations. Who against hope believed
[50:20] in it anyways, that he might become the
[50:23] father of many nations according to that
[50:25] which he has spoken. So shall what?
[50:29] We shall be.
[50:32] So shall we be. We're the seed of
[50:34] Abraham. Amen. And being not weak in
[50:37] faith, he considered not his own body.
[50:39] now being dead. So don't consider your
[50:43] nature just has a hard time. Don't
[50:44] consider that. Don't look to that.
[50:49] When he was about a hundred years old,
[50:52] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
[50:53] womb, he staggered not at the promise of
[50:56] God through unbelief, but was strong in
[50:59] faith, giving glory to God. In other
[51:02] words, it's going to happen. Amen. Yes,
[51:05] we're going to have those times that we
[51:07] say, "God, come on. When's this thing
[51:10] going to happen? It's been 25 years."
[51:13] Yeah, we're going to have times that
[51:14] we're going to say, "Well, I just don't
[51:16] feel any different. Nothing seems to be
[51:18] happening." That's okay. But you got to
[51:20] end up saying, "But I still believe."
[51:25] You've got to let the inside man come
[51:27] out and take a stand on the word of God.
[51:30] We don't walk by feelings. We walk by
[51:32] faith.
[51:34] Amen.
[51:36] And being fully persuaded that he
[51:39] was what he had promised, he was he able
[51:43] he was able also to
[51:46] perform. And therefore it was imputed
[51:49] unto him for righteousness. And now it
[51:52] was not written for his sake
[51:56] alone that it was imputed to him but for
[52:01] what? What's the next word? But for
[52:05] us, this is written here for us. Amen.
[52:10] We might as well just pay attention.
[52:13] This this is God speaking right now.
[52:14] This is God speaking. This is to us. But
[52:17] for us to whom it shall be imputed if we
[52:21] believe on him that raised up Jesus our
[52:23] Lord from the dead, who was delivered
[52:25] for our offenses and was raised for our
[52:27] justification. So as the as uh Abraham's
[52:31] natural body was nurtured by faith to
[52:35] bring forth a natural promised son. So
[52:38] Abraham's spiritual body is being
[52:41] nurtured by faith to bring forth God's
[52:44] spiritual promised son in us. Amen. Come
[52:47] on now. That's the most glorious thing
[52:50] that I know of. Christ in you, the hope
[52:53] of glory. Amen. Genesis
[52:56] 3:14. No, I'm sorry. Not Genesis,
[52:59] Galatians. Galatians chapter 3, if
[53:01] you're writing it down, Galatians
[53:02] chapter
[53:03] 3:14, that the blessing of Abraham might
[53:07] come on the Gentiles through Jesus
[53:11] Christ, that we might receive the
[53:14] promise of the spirit through faith.
[53:17] Now, what is the spirit? The spirit is
[53:20] the literal life of God.
[53:24] The spirit is not some gift we put in
[53:27] the closet, say, "I've got the gift. I
[53:30] pull it out when I want it."
[53:32] It's the life of Christ inside of you.
[53:35] It is the promise to the spiritual seed
[53:37] of Abraham.
[53:40] You know, Jesus said to to those
[53:42] Pharisees, he said, "You say you're
[53:44] Abraham's seed, but if you are Abraham's
[53:46] seed, why do you seek to kill me?"
[53:49] So Abraham did not this. does not say
[53:51] there's a fruit of the spirit. If we've
[53:53] got if we've got if we are the seed of
[53:56] Abraham, we need to bring forth the
[53:57] fruit of Christ. Amen.
[54:00] Verse 16. Now to
[54:02] Abraham and his seed was the promise
[54:05] made. He saith not and to seeds as of
[54:10] many, but as of one and to thy seed
[54:15] which is Christ. Amen. So here's the
[54:19] thing. Every one of us is going to be
[54:22] just like Jesus. He is the firstborn
[54:25] among many brethren. Every seed brings
[54:28] forth of its own kind. We're not looking
[54:30] for some hybrid seed. We're not looking
[54:32] for something that's almost like him. We
[54:34] are believing that we are the seed of
[54:36] Christ. We have full expectation to
[54:38] believe that we're going to manifest
[54:39] Christ. And we need to start telling the
[54:41] devil where we're standing.
[54:45] Because if you're going to wait to feel
[54:47] good, then you will need cheerleaders.
[54:50] You will need somebody saying, "Come on,
[54:51] we can make it."
[54:54] But when you just believe it, I'll tell
[54:56] you, Abraham didn't have any
[54:57] cheerleaders in out there.
[55:01] He had the word of God. I think the
[55:03] prophet told us one time he went 15
[55:05] years without hearing from God.
[55:08] Think about that.
[55:12] We go two days.
[55:15] Come on now. We got to hold to the word.
[55:17] Hold to the promise.
[55:19] Romans chapter 8 vers
[55:21] 11. But if the spirit because remember
[55:25] the promise is the spirit right to the
[55:27] Gentiles. But if the spirit of him that
[55:30] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[55:33] you. Amen. Then he that raised up Christ
[55:37] from the dead shall also quicken your
[55:40] mortal body right now by the spirit that
[55:42] dwelleth in you. That's how important it
[55:45] is to get the Holy Ghost.
[55:48] And it's how important to get more of
[55:49] the Holy Ghost. How important not to
[55:52] entertain thoughts? I've got enough.
[55:55] Don't entertain that thought. You know,
[55:57] just as it comes out, let it go out. I
[56:00] need more. I'm pressing towards more.
[56:02] There's more for me because I look at my
[56:04] life and I see there's more of Christ I
[56:06] need to manifest.
[56:09] The spirit of God brings us into the
[56:11] image of God. Verse 19, the same
[56:14] chapter. Romans 8:19. For the earnest
[56:18] expectation of the
[56:20] creation is waiting for the
[56:23] manifestation of this group of people.
[56:27] Not everybody is going to manifest
[56:29] Christ.
[56:31] But those that receive the the fullness
[56:33] of the Holy Ghost are going to manifest
[56:36] the fullness of God.
[56:38] For whom he did verse 29. So sorry,
[56:41] verse 29. We're skipping here. For whom
[56:43] he did forno, he also did predestinate
[56:47] to be conformed to the image of his son,
[56:50] that he might be the firstborn among
[56:52] many
[56:55] brethren. The bride does not have
[56:58] strength to bring
[57:00] forth the image of
[57:03] Christ on her own. She she certainly
[57:06] does not. So what is she doing? She's
[57:10] drawing strength from El Shadi. Amen.
[57:13] From the breasted one, the almighty God.
[57:16] We get our strength from the milk of the
[57:20] breasted one. Amen. Now, I think we need
[57:23] to spend more time feeding on the
[57:25] breasted one. More time with a a shadow,
[57:28] the almighty God. Right. 1 Peter chapter
[57:32] 2 verse one tells us where 1 Peter
[57:34] chapter 2 verse one if you're writing it
[57:36] down. Wherefore laying aside
[57:41] laying aside the things that is keeping
[57:43] you from feeding
[57:46] on Christ. All malice, all guile,
[57:50] hypocrisies, envying and all evil
[57:53] speaking.
[57:55] As newborn babes, desire the sincere
[57:59] milk of the word that we that ye may
[58:02] grow
[58:04] thereby. If so be you have tasted that
[58:07] the Lord is gracious.
[58:11] God is gracious. He'll supply every need
[58:14] according to his riches and glory. God
[58:16] is a gracious God. Amen. We got to lay
[58:19] aside and spend time with him. draw
[58:24] strength from you. It's not a natural
[58:26] thing. You don't come into church and
[58:28] draw strength, friends.
[58:30] You don't go into a barn and have to
[58:32] worry that you're going to become like a
[58:33] horse. You don't. And you don't ever
[58:36] have to worry about coming into church
[58:37] and becoming a Christian because you
[58:39] won't. It takes eating the word,
[58:42] drinking the milk, drinking the sincere
[58:44] milk of the word, desiring to become
[58:46] like Christ. Amen.
[58:49] God is a real God with a real
[58:51] relationship with a real spirit that
[58:53] wants to really fill our hearts and and
[58:55] change our lives from glory onto glory.
[58:58] Amen.
[59:00] To whom coming as unto lively stones
[59:03] disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of
[59:07] God
[59:08] and precious. You also as lively stones
[59:12] are built up a spiritual
[59:14] house, a holy priesthood to offer
[59:18] spiritual
[59:20] sacrifices. The ones that are acceptable
[59:22] to God by Jesus Christ. So don't come in
[59:26] here in the flesh and try to play praise
[59:29] God will not be acceptable.
[59:34] God is a spirit and they that worship me
[59:37] must worship me in spirit and in truth.
[59:40] Amen. Now, God is building us today.
[59:44] He's trying to build his house in us so
[59:46] he can come and have it. But, you know,
[59:48] I'm going to tell you this. If I gave
[59:50] you a million dollars and you were going
[59:51] to go buy a house, you wouldn't choose
[59:53] some dump in the inner city that had
[59:55] crime all around you, had bars all
[59:57] wrapped up around you. You wouldn't
[59:59] choose that.
[1:00:01] I'm telling you, God's coming to choose
[1:00:02] a house he feels welcomed in. He feels
[1:00:05] welcomed with his word. That's right.
[1:00:08] It'll be word everywhere on that house.
[1:00:12] So, we need to lay aside the things that
[1:00:14] are keeping us from spending
[1:00:16] time from feeding on Christ and simply
[1:00:21] desire the sincere milk of the word.
[1:00:24] Don't think you're a baby because you
[1:00:26] desire the sincere milk of the word.
[1:00:30] I'm telling you, we will need strength
[1:00:32] until we're out of here. I remember
[1:00:35] brother Bill telling us one time, he
[1:00:37] said, "I I believe what'll be happening
[1:00:39] is we'll have a sword in one hand
[1:00:42] fighting off the devil as we're entering
[1:00:44] into the rapture."
[1:00:46] So, we need the sincere milk. We need
[1:00:48] the strength that comes from the
[1:00:50] breasted one. Al
[1:00:53] Shi spend more time feeding, nurturing,
[1:00:56] drawing strength from Christ as newborn
[1:00:59] babes desire the sincere milk of the
[1:01:03] word. Wonder how much time do you spend
[1:01:08] feeding and desiring the sincere milk of
[1:01:11] the word?
[1:01:13] How much time this
[1:01:17] week, this past week, because this is a
[1:01:19] new week it started, have you spent
[1:01:21] feeding on the word just desiring God, I
[1:01:25] want to be fed. I want to be fed. I want
[1:01:29] I'm coming to you for the reason of
[1:01:31] getting strength that I can become more
[1:01:33] like you.
[1:01:36] Not so I don't have this problem with my
[1:01:37] neighbor,
[1:01:39] but I'm coming to you that I might have
[1:01:41] strength to become more like you. How
[1:01:44] much
[1:01:49] time I want to ask you this question
[1:01:51] then. How much time do newborn babes
[1:01:54] spend breastfeeding?
[1:02:03] Breastfeeding a baby for a year would
[1:02:06] conservatively
[1:02:09] take00
[1:02:11] hours. And what that equivalents to,
[1:02:13] brother Marty, is a full-time job, 40
[1:02:17] hours a week, three weeks
[1:02:20] vacation, seven paid holidays, couple
[1:02:23] sick days, and you would spend the rest
[1:02:25] of time breastfeeding.
[1:02:29] a 40hour week
[1:02:33] breastfeeding. That is what God was
[1:02:35] calling Abraham to do.
[1:02:38] Spend time with me. Believe this. Build
[1:02:40] your faith up. Build yourself up in the
[1:02:42] most holy faith. This son is coming. We
[1:02:45] are going to come into the image of
[1:02:47] Jesus Christ. But we've got to be
[1:02:49] willing to feed.
[1:02:54] Let's spend more time. I'll say like
[1:02:56] this full
[1:02:57] time. Drawing strength from El
[1:03:00] Shedi. You shall seek me, you shall find
[1:03:03] me when you search for me with all thy
[1:03:07] heart.
[1:03:09] Psalm or Isaiah chapter 40
[1:03:12] 28. Now don't get quiet on me. What I
[1:03:15] want you to say is, I'm going to start
[1:03:17] feeding some more. I'm going to start
[1:03:18] feeding some more.
[1:03:20] We had to bring that statistic in to
[1:03:22] show how much we need to be spending
[1:03:25] time with God.
[1:03:27] We live in a busy world. You know what
[1:03:28] we do? We try to get all of our things
[1:03:29] done. Well, and try to fit some in over
[1:03:31] here.
[1:03:33] And the devil says, "I know what to do
[1:03:34] with you. That's a that's so stupid. I
[1:03:36] know what to do. I'll get you so busy.
[1:03:37] Give you so many problems. I'll get you
[1:03:40] I'll get you where you don't even have
[1:03:41] time."
[1:03:43] And and and you know your testimony will
[1:03:45] be two weeks from now. I've just been so
[1:03:49] and I got all these problems
[1:03:51] and it's like are you gonna stop? Are
[1:03:54] you going to stop the roller coaster?
[1:03:55] You going to stop the scroll cage? Are
[1:03:57] you going to stop the cycle? And are you
[1:03:59] going to say God is my strength?
[1:04:04] Isaiah 40:28. Has thou not
[1:04:09] known? Has I not heard that the
[1:04:13] everlasting God, the Lord, the creator
[1:04:16] of the ends of the earth, he faintth
[1:04:18] not, neither is
[1:04:21] weary. He's the source of strength. He's
[1:04:23] like the sun that never stops shining.
[1:04:26] He's this He's the son of God that has
[1:04:28] so much strength. He can give you
[1:04:29] strength whatever you have need of,
[1:04:30] whenever you have need of it. It's still
[1:04:33] shining when it's dark out there. It's
[1:04:35] just shining somewhere else. Amen.
[1:04:38] There's no searching of his
[1:04:40] understanding. He giveth power to the
[1:04:43] faint,
[1:04:45] to them that have no
[1:04:47] might. He actually increases strength to
[1:04:50] them.
[1:04:53] Even the youth shall faint and be weary.
[1:04:56] The young man shall utterly fall.
[1:05:00] So it isn't how old you are physically.
[1:05:05] It's who you're connected to
[1:05:07] spiritually.
[1:05:09] But they that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:05:12] renew their strength. They shall mount
[1:05:15] up with wings as eagles. They shall run
[1:05:17] and not be weary. And they shall walk
[1:05:21] and not faint. Amen.
[1:05:25] Because of his strength. Psalms 59:9
[1:05:28] says, "I will wait upon thee." because
[1:05:31] of his strength, I will wait upon thee.
[1:05:34] For God is my defense.
[1:05:39] We need to just put more of our
[1:05:42] attention to God taking care of all of
[1:05:43] our problems, even our natural problems.
[1:05:47] He's not just a a spiritual God to take
[1:05:49] care of our soul
[1:05:51] problems, but he's a spiritual God that
[1:05:53] can take care of every problem that we
[1:05:55] can have on planet Earth.
[1:06:01] Psalms chapter 8 verse one. Psalms
[1:06:04] chapter 8 verse one. Oh Lord our Lord,
[1:06:08] how excellent is thy name in all the
[1:06:11] earth.
[1:06:13] Who has set thy glory above the heavens.
[1:06:16] Amen. Out of the mouth of babes and
[1:06:21] sucklings, thou has ordained
[1:06:26] strength because of thine enemies, that
[1:06:29] thou mightest still see the enemy and
[1:06:33] the avenger that thou mightest the enemy
[1:06:36] and the avenger. Out of the mouth of
[1:06:39] babes and sucklings has thou ordained
[1:06:42] strength. Why? because they are
[1:06:44] connected to El Shadi.
[1:06:47] They're connected to El Shadi. And I'll
[1:06:50] tell you, I like it that that God didn't
[1:06:52] say to Abraham when he was 76 years old,
[1:06:55] El Shadi.
[1:06:57] He's 99 years old and saying, "I'm El
[1:06:59] Shadi." Amen. Now, this word El Shadi,
[1:07:02] the breast of what? It's only mentioned
[1:07:04] about seven times in the Bible.
[1:07:12] Now say we were in God at the
[1:07:19] beginning and we are his wife. We're the
[1:07:22] the part the feminine part of him.
[1:07:28] But God showing us that in in short he's
[1:07:32] neither male or female in itself.
[1:07:38] But he has what it needs to nourish us.
[1:07:42] Amen.
[1:07:43] And we need to look to him as one that
[1:07:46] can give us strength in a time of need.
[1:07:48] Amen.
[1:07:51] I am the one who's able to do
[1:07:53] exceedingly above all that you could ask
[1:07:56] or even think. He's always been a God of
[1:07:59] the impossible. Amen.
[1:08:02] He took a
[1:08:03] situation when Adam and Eve separated
[1:08:07] from
[1:08:08] him. He took an impossible situation. He
[1:08:11] had to fulfill his word. The day you
[1:08:14] eat, the day you die. Amen. But since
[1:08:17] Abraham and Isaac were a part or
[1:08:19] Abraham, I'm so sorry that Adam and Eve
[1:08:22] was a part of him. He took that place
[1:08:26] that we wouldn't die. You talk about a
[1:08:29] God that takes the impossible and makes
[1:08:32] something amazing out of it. God is able
[1:08:34] to take all of our lives and no matter
[1:08:37] where they're at, he makes everything
[1:08:38] beautiful in his time because that's the
[1:08:41] God we serve. That may not be the person
[1:08:44] you're married to. That may not be the
[1:08:45] person I'm married to, but that's the
[1:08:47] God we serve today. That may not be the
[1:08:49] government we're in,
[1:08:52] but it is the God we serve today. We
[1:08:55] don't serve a natural kingdom. We serve
[1:08:57] a spiritual kingdom. Amen.
[1:09:00] God is here wanting you to reflect on
[1:09:04] every single thing that God has done for
[1:09:07] you.
[1:09:10] Count your blessings. We sung it.
[1:09:15] It will surprise you. It'll like kind of
[1:09:18] lift you up and oh yeah, he's actually
[1:09:20] done this for me before.
[1:09:25] Think about the needs he's met in your
[1:09:26] life.
[1:09:30] He has literally extended beyond our
[1:09:34] expectations at times.
[1:09:36] We all can testify that he's healed our
[1:09:38] body numerous times. Amen. Even though
[1:09:40] we still need healing, we need to
[1:09:43] reflect on his goodness where he did
[1:09:44] heal us in the past.
[1:09:46] He's delivered our minds from oppression
[1:09:48] of the
[1:09:49] enemy. He's raised a a standard up
[1:09:52] against the enemy when he came in like a
[1:09:54] flood. He's done things that we have to
[1:09:56] stand back. I don't know he did that.
[1:09:59] We've all been in situations where if it
[1:10:01] would have been 3 seconds, we would have
[1:10:02] been dead because that car would have
[1:10:04] hit us. I mean, he has done so much for
[1:10:07] us. Amen. He's our source of strength.
[1:10:11] He's our source of comfort.
[1:10:14] He has placed peace in our heart when
[1:10:15] our understanding couldn't figure
[1:10:16] something out.
[1:10:18] Yet, we had a peace to stand there and
[1:10:20] know it's still okay. Even though we
[1:10:23] can't answer the devil's questions,
[1:10:26] Yes, because that's what the devil does.
[1:10:29] He'll put questions in you. Try to
[1:10:31] figure that out. I don't need to figure
[1:10:34] it out. I got a God who I trust in.
[1:10:38] Then I'll tell you that is much greater
[1:10:40] riches than all the understanding we can
[1:10:43] have.
[1:10:46] And we need to look to him and say, I
[1:10:49] can do all things through Christ who
[1:10:52] gives me strength to do them.
[1:10:55] is the bride in herself. She can't
[1:10:57] become in this image. But if the word
[1:11:00] says love your enemies through Christ I
[1:11:03] can love my enemy. Amen.
[1:11:07] Can the redeemed of the Lord say so?
[1:11:10] What are we waiting for? You got to be
[1:11:11] like Jonah. Count those things which are
[1:11:13] not or like Abraham those things which
[1:11:15] are not as though they were against hope
[1:11:17] believed in hope. Count everything else
[1:11:19] a vanity. Count your past failures a
[1:11:21] vanity. Count the seaweed you're staring
[1:11:23] at, the the situation you're in, the the
[1:11:26] things that you're feeling in your
[1:11:27] bosom. Just count it seaweed and vanity
[1:11:29] and and and look to the Lord and believe
[1:11:32] that he's able to meet your need.
[1:11:34] Whatever it would be, whatever it would
[1:11:36] be, I can do. Let's sing. Let's just
[1:11:40] let's sing it. We could sing it, but
[1:11:42] let's let's say it together. I can Let's
[1:11:46] put it up there. Philippians
[1:11:49] 1 or or 4:13. I can do all things
[1:11:55] through Christ which strengthenth me.
[1:11:59] Amen. Your strength comes. Look to the
[1:12:02] hills from which cometh your strength.
[1:12:04] My strength, my help cometh from the
[1:12:06] Lord. Amen. I can do all things Christ.
[1:12:10] He is our strength.
[1:12:13] Amen. He's a present help in a time of
[1:12:16] need.
[1:12:19] I'm an overcomer through Christ
[1:12:22] today. Today, I'm an overcomer through
[1:12:25] Jesus Christ. I'm healed through Jesus
[1:12:28] Christ today. I'm victorious through
[1:12:30] Jesus Christ today. In fact, greater is
[1:12:33] he that is in me than every lie that's
[1:12:36] ever told to me by the devil.
[1:12:38] You know what's gotten me in the mess
[1:12:40] I've gotten in? Me listening to the
[1:12:43] devil.
[1:12:46] Me trying to take things into my own
[1:12:48] control. Me doing it my way. Me
[1:12:50] listening to Frank Sinatra too
[1:12:57] much. We all grow up with the spirit of
[1:12:59] Frank Sinatra.
[1:13:01] I'm going to do it my way.
[1:13:05] We got to denounce that thing. Die
[1:13:07] daily.
[1:13:10] God has given us the
[1:13:12] checkbook. Amen. That's right. He's
[1:13:15] given his his name to use. In my name,
[1:13:19] you shall cast out devils. Cast the
[1:13:22] devils out of your life. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:25] Cast the devils out of your family.
[1:13:27] Amen. In my name, cast the thoughts out
[1:13:29] of your mind in my name. Submit yourself
[1:13:32] to me. Draw nigh to me. Submit yourself
[1:13:34] to the word and I'll draw nigh to you.
[1:13:37] And then resist the devil and he'll flee
[1:13:38] from you. It's a promise of God
[1:13:41] today. I'll say it like this. Walk in
[1:13:44] his
[1:13:45] strength. Walk in his strength. Walk
[1:13:48] before God in his strength and you will
[1:13:52] be
[1:13:55] perfect. You will be complete. Our
[1:13:58] opening scripture today, if we could
[1:13:59] turn there. I am the Lord
[1:14:02] God. Walk before
[1:14:05] me and be thou
[1:14:07] perfect. Walk before me.
[1:14:11] Not out there. Don't come visit me on
[1:14:14] Sundays and Wednesdays. Walk before me
[1:14:17] and be complete.
[1:14:19] I am what completes you. Amen. And I
[1:14:23] will make my covenant between me and
[1:14:24] thee and will multiply thee exceedingly.
[1:14:28] You know, God is able to make all grace
[1:14:31] abound to us.
[1:14:33] He owns a cattle on a thousand hills.
[1:14:37] You know, we don't need to preach a a a
[1:14:39] prosperity message. What we need to to
[1:14:42] preach is a a prosperity relationship
[1:14:45] with Jesus Christ.
[1:14:47] One where we're in love with
[1:14:49] him and let God be
[1:14:52] God. He didn't make Abraham uh a Lazarus
[1:14:57] and he didn't try to tell Lazarus how to
[1:15:00] be an Abraham.
[1:15:03] And he loved them both.
[1:15:06] He loved them
[1:15:08] both. I mean, think about it. He didn't
[1:15:10] raise Abraham up, but he did raise
[1:15:12] Lazarus up. Think about it. It's not
[1:15:16] what we have in this world that matters
[1:15:17] to God.
[1:15:19] It's what we give to him that's what
[1:15:21] matters to God.
[1:15:24] Like I made mention, Ela is used in
[1:15:27] reference to multiplying, exceeding and
[1:15:29] being fruitful seven times in the Bible.
[1:15:34] God's expressing his desire for us to be
[1:15:36] spiritually uh fruitful a and to
[1:15:40] multiply spiritually. How do we do that?
[1:15:43] How do I multiply spiritually? I don't
[1:15:46] just become in his
[1:15:50] image, but I have fruit inside of me.
[1:15:53] Imagine for a moment if I didn't bring
[1:15:54] anybody to Christ.
[1:15:57] That means I would have no seed inside
[1:15:59] of
[1:16:02] me. We went and bought some
[1:16:07] um what do they call those tomatoes that
[1:16:10] are from the heirlooms
[1:16:14] um this weekend? And um they're from
[1:16:18] Sicily. They're about 125 years old. I
[1:16:21] guess their original seed that was from
[1:16:23] Sicily 125 years ago.
[1:16:27] Every seed brings forth of its
[1:16:29] kind. If we receive the Holy Ghost, you
[1:16:33] receive seed inside you.
[1:16:37] You're the God puts within us. He makes
[1:16:40] us ambassadors
[1:16:44] to share the very life of Christ with
[1:16:47] somebody that they may be changed
[1:16:50] from their old nature to become like
[1:16:52] him. It's just how it works. That's how
[1:16:54] I came in.
[1:16:56] We all came in through somebody,
[1:16:59] right? It wasn't just you
[1:17:02] alone. Nobody ever, you know, look at
[1:17:05] the
[1:17:07] unic. Philip asked, "Do you understand
[1:17:09] what you read?" How can I like somebody
[1:17:12] tells me
[1:17:14] God wants to use us to bring Christ to
[1:17:17] others? Amen. Amen. Ela has given us
[1:17:21] nourishment to spiritually grow and to
[1:17:24] multiply exceedingly. Let's take a look
[1:17:25] at second Peter. I know we've said these
[1:17:27] scriptures before, but it just bears
[1:17:30] repeating because it's of a spiritual
[1:17:32] u a
[1:17:34] multiplying, a growing, of being
[1:17:36] fruitful. Second 2 second Peter 1:3
[1:17:39] according as his divine power his divine
[1:17:42] strength and power has given unto you
[1:17:45] and I all things that pertain unto life
[1:17:49] and
[1:17:50] godliness through the knowledge of him
[1:17:52] that have called you to glory and
[1:17:54] virtue. Now I could I can't I could do
[1:17:58] this. I could put $1,000 into your bank
[1:18:01] account.
[1:18:04] I
[1:18:07] could. Now you have the choice. Are you
[1:18:10] going to use it or you going to let it
[1:18:12] sit
[1:18:18] there? God has given to us all things
[1:18:20] that pertainth unto life and godliness.
[1:18:23] They're there in our account.
[1:18:26] Amen. But if we don't believe them for
[1:18:29] our life, we don't tap in and say, "I
[1:18:32] can do all things. Christ has promised
[1:18:34] me peace in my home. God has promised me
[1:18:37] joy. God has promised me love. God has
[1:18:40] promised me what I need right now to
[1:18:42] help my mind." If you don't tap into
[1:18:45] that, it's still sitting there in your
[1:18:48] account.
[1:18:53] So, you've got to believe the scripture
[1:18:54] is for you.
[1:18:57] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:18:59] great and precious
[1:19:01] promises, that by these you might be
[1:19:03] partakers of the divine nature, having
[1:19:07] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:19:08] world through lust. And besides
[1:19:11] this, give all diligence. Don't give
[1:19:14] just a little bit here and
[1:19:16] there. Add to your faith virtue. That
[1:19:19] means
[1:19:20] strength. Well, we know where our
[1:19:22] strength comes from. If you want to add
[1:19:24] to your faith virtue, that means spend
[1:19:26] time with God. Amen. Spend time feeding
[1:19:30] on the word, breastfeed on this word.
[1:19:34] Get the nutrients that you need from the
[1:19:36] word of God today. Amen.
[1:19:39] Add to your faith virtue and virtue.
[1:19:41] Knowledge. You'll get knowledge as you
[1:19:43] read it. Amen. And knowledge,
[1:19:45] temperance.
[1:19:47] I'll tell you, you'll get the knowledge
[1:19:48] of how to live, how to treat others, how
[1:19:52] to act,
[1:19:54] how to carry yourself, temperance. No,
[1:19:57] you'll have the ability to close your
[1:19:58] mouth when your flesh would want to open
[1:20:00] it.
[1:20:02] It's true. This is what God, this is
[1:20:04] this is the Holy Ghost. You think the
[1:20:05] Holy Ghost has a problem? The Holy Ghost
[1:20:08] doesn't have a problem being the Holy
[1:20:11] Ghost. Amen.
[1:20:14] I mean, the Holy Ghost just stood there
[1:20:16] in Jesus while they mocked him and put
[1:20:18] the crowns of thorns and the bloods
[1:20:20] running down his face. He didn't revile
[1:20:22] back.
[1:20:23] He didn't try to manipulate. He didn't
[1:20:25] do any of that. I'm telling you, what we
[1:20:27] need is a real God in our life. The real
[1:20:29] Holy Ghost. We need a bubbling inside.
[1:20:32] We need it coming out, coming out,
[1:20:34] coming out. Cup overflowing. It don't
[1:20:37] happen by spending time in the in the in
[1:20:40] in in in some little uh wiggle tail
[1:20:43] place where no water's coming in or no
[1:20:44] water's going out. You've got to get
[1:20:46] under the the where the fountain of the
[1:20:48] living water is and spend time with the
[1:20:50] Holy Ghost and let it come bubbling
[1:20:52] inside of you. You got to be like that
[1:20:54] policeman when they went up there and
[1:20:55] said, "We're looking for the revival."
[1:20:57] And he says, "You've arrived. You
[1:20:59] arrived. You can't get any closer. It's
[1:21:01] right here inside of me.
[1:21:04] It's got to be inside.
[1:21:08] And besides this, giving all diligence
[1:21:10] add to your faith virtue, virtue,
[1:21:11] knowledge, knowledge, temperance,
[1:21:12] temperance, patience, and to patience,
[1:21:14] godliness, and to godly brotherly
[1:21:16] kindness, brotherly
[1:21:23] kindness. That thing that brother Rand
[1:21:25] said, whatever you do,
[1:21:28] lay aside everything else till you get
[1:21:30] it. You need the capstone.
[1:21:34] You need charity.
[1:21:37] For if these things be in you and
[1:21:40] abound, they make you that you should
[1:21:42] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[1:21:45] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. I am
[1:21:49] El
[1:21:51] Shadi. God wants us to go forth and
[1:21:54] multiply, be fruitful, and
[1:21:56] multiply. Well, the only way we're going
[1:21:58] to do that is him in us. Amen. The only
[1:22:01] thing I can multiply is my wrath,
[1:22:05] my anger.
[1:22:08] I'm going to tell you, Brother Bob.
[1:22:15] You better
[1:22:17] listen
[1:22:23] or God bless you, brother Ron.
[1:22:32] You know, here's the thing. You can't
[1:22:33] get
[1:22:34] painted. You can't get warmed by a
[1:22:36] painted fire.
[1:22:40] But I'll tell you, if it's
[1:22:42] real, your spirit bears witness.
[1:22:46] You know the love of God when it's by
[1:22:48] you.
[1:22:49] And I'll tell you, I would to me to me I
[1:22:52] would I
[1:22:54] would that if nobody could love me. I
[1:22:59] want us to love them.
[1:23:02] Because you think about all the people
[1:23:03] that are going to hell, God loves. He
[1:23:06] says, "I take no pleasure in the death
[1:23:08] of the wicked. I would that all men
[1:23:10] would be saved. If that spirit in me, it
[1:23:14] will quicken my body. It will quicken me
[1:23:17] to love.
[1:23:19] not just have this like I'm serving God
[1:23:21] over here, but over here I'm I'm just
[1:23:23] kind of, you know, I live in the world.
[1:23:26] That's right.
[1:23:28] And the Lord said to Abraham, "I am the
[1:23:29] Almighty. Walk before me. Be thou
[1:23:31] perfect, and I will make my covenant
[1:23:33] between me and thee and will multiply
[1:23:35] thy seed exceedingly." Abraham was old
[1:23:39] and weak, unccapable of bringing forth
[1:23:42] the promise of his own son. And the Lord
[1:23:44] said, "I am El Shadai, the Almighty God.
[1:23:46] Walk before me and be thou perfect. So
[1:23:50] God was giving him a track to run
[1:23:53] on. Walk before me and be complete. Be
[1:23:56] in be
[1:24:00] entire. Be everything without
[1:24:04] blemish. And I say to the seed of
[1:24:06] Abraham today, walk before God and be
[1:24:09] complete. Amen.
[1:24:12] If we walk in the steps of our father
[1:24:14] Abraham, right, that didn't mean go
[1:24:17] to Israel
[1:24:19] or wherever they were walking in their
[1:24:22] journey and walk the the same geographic
[1:24:27] location, but it means walk in the the
[1:24:29] steps of our of our father's faith
[1:24:34] that you have a spiritual promise. He
[1:24:36] had a natural promise.
[1:24:39] And your promise is Jesus Christ. We
[1:24:41] can't lose vision of that. It isn't to
[1:24:44] make it through the week.
[1:24:47] Isn't to make sure our bills get paid.
[1:24:58] and all other things will be added. I'll
[1:25:00] tell you get that revelation, you'll
[1:25:02] bypass a lot of problems.
[1:25:04] Hebrews chapter 6 verse one.
[1:25:11] Therefore, leaving the principles of the
[1:25:14] doctrine of Christ,
[1:25:16] let us go on unto perfection,
[1:25:19] not laying again the foundation
[1:25:23] of I guess I got to start all over
[1:25:26] again.
[1:25:31] repentance from dead works and of faith
[1:25:33] toward God and of the baptism and the
[1:25:37] doctrine of baptism and of laying on of
[1:25:39] hands and the resurrection of the dead
[1:25:41] and of eternal
[1:25:45] judgment. So we got to leave that. We're
[1:25:48] leaving
[1:25:50] that. Verse nine says, "But beloved, we
[1:25:54] are persuaded better things of you
[1:25:58] and the things that accompany salvation,
[1:26:01] though we thus speak." So what
[1:26:03] accompanies salvation? Going on to
[1:26:05] perfection.
[1:26:10] Some people claiming salvation, once
[1:26:13] saved, always saved, don't go anywhere
[1:26:15] else outside of what happened to them 20
[1:26:17] years ago, and they just do whatever
[1:26:18] they want to do.
[1:26:21] That's not scriptural.
[1:26:24] God has persuaded better things with the
[1:26:26] bride.
[1:26:28] The foolish virgin, nope.
[1:26:31] The lukewarm believer, nope. But the
[1:26:34] bride, he's persuaded better things.
[1:26:37] Verse 10. But God is not unrighteous to
[1:26:40] forget your work and labor of love which
[1:26:42] you have showed towards his name. And
[1:26:44] that you have ministered to the saints
[1:26:46] and do minister. And we desire that
[1:26:48] every one of you do show what the same
[1:26:51] diligence. Add to your be diligent now.
[1:26:54] Make your calling election sure. Show
[1:26:56] the same diligence to the full assurance
[1:26:59] of hope unto the end.
[1:27:02] So, we ought to
[1:27:04] leave the service, every
[1:27:07] service, no matter if we feel that the
[1:27:11] that the the Lord corrected
[1:27:14] us or we felt we're on victory lane.
[1:27:19] We ought to leave church with such a
[1:27:22] hope inside of us that I'm going to
[1:27:24] become more like Jesus this week.
[1:27:28] I don't need a cheerleader up here.
[1:27:31] I have the word of God. I get strength
[1:27:34] from the word of God.
[1:27:38] That ye be not
[1:27:40] sloughtful, but followers of them who
[1:27:43] through faith and patience inherit the
[1:27:45] promises.
[1:27:47] That's right. Patience. I mean, Abraham,
[1:27:49] look how long he had to wait. I think we
[1:27:51] should never complain about our
[1:27:52] situation.
[1:27:54] Think about that.
[1:28:02] For when God made promise to Abraham,
[1:28:05] because he could swear by no greater, he
[1:28:06] swore by himself, saying, "Surely
[1:28:09] blessing I will bless thee, and
[1:28:10] multiplying I will multiply thee." And
[1:28:12] so after he had patiently endured, he
[1:28:16] obtained the
[1:28:20] promise. And God is saying today,
[1:28:22] "Surely I'm going to bless you, bride."
[1:28:25] Amen. I am going to bless you, bride.
[1:28:28] Stay focused on what the prophet said.
[1:28:34] Don't let God become the two times that
[1:28:36] you sit in church a week.
[1:28:39] Let God become your life. Amen.
[1:28:42] Amen. Matthew 5:48. Be ye therefore
[1:28:45] perfect, even as your father which is in
[1:28:47] heaven is perfect. Don't be like
[1:28:50] everyone else who can only love those
[1:28:52] who love them. who can only be kind to
[1:28:54] those who are kind to them, who only
[1:28:57] wants to smile to them, who smiles at
[1:28:58] them, who's not being mean to them,
[1:29:02] don't be like them. Anybody could do
[1:29:04] that,
[1:29:06] but be strengthened with the love of God
[1:29:09] and love those who hate you, right? 44.
[1:29:12] Love your enemy, bless them that curse
[1:29:14] you, do good to them that hate you, and
[1:29:16] pray for them to displayfully use you
[1:29:19] and persecute you. Now, think about
[1:29:21] that. that they don't just use
[1:29:23] you, they despitefully do it.
[1:29:29] I mean, you know, sin is out there just
[1:29:31] despitefully out there. That ye may be
[1:29:35] the children of your father which is in
[1:29:36] heaven. For he maketh the son to rise on
[1:29:38] the evil and on the good and sends rain
[1:29:40] on the just and the unjust. God, Jesus
[1:29:44] said, "Be ye perfect even as your father
[1:29:46] in heaven is perfect." Amen. Paul is
[1:29:48] telling us to go on to perfection. God
[1:29:50] is coming without uh uh for a bride
[1:29:52] without spot or without wrinkle. And we
[1:29:55] need to walk before Jehovah Jaba our El
[1:29:58] Shadi with with
[1:30:02] strength be perfect to be complete
[1:30:06] that means press towards not say I'm
[1:30:10] here oh me I need help
[1:30:12] where do you know where our help comes
[1:30:14] from spend time with God I mean that
[1:30:16] that that that chorus that we sung
[1:30:19] before the word humble
[1:30:22] yourself go home and humble self
[1:30:25] literally go home and make time to spend
[1:30:27] with God in prayer.
[1:30:31] Well, brother Jean, I do I spend fill in
[1:30:34] the blank. I don't care what what number
[1:30:35] you put in that blank that you spend
[1:30:37] with God. What I want you to do is erase
[1:30:40] that. Cross it out and put more time in
[1:30:43] there
[1:30:45] because God wants to do great things in
[1:30:46] our life. He wants us to be fruitful to
[1:30:48] multiply. Amen. And we need to spend
[1:30:50] time with the breasted one to get the
[1:30:52] strength that we need to draw strength
[1:30:55] to multiply and that spiritual seed in
[1:30:58] our life. Amen. Daniel 12:2 tells us,
[1:31:01] "And many of them that slept in the dust
[1:31:03] of the earth shall awake, some to
[1:31:06] everlasting life, and some to shame and
[1:31:10] everlasting contempt." Amen.
[1:31:12] And they that be wise shall shine as the
[1:31:16] brightness of the firmament, and they
[1:31:18] shall turn many to righteousness, and as
[1:31:20] the stars forever and ever.
[1:31:25] Don't you want to shine in heaven?
[1:31:28] I honestly don't want to be this some
[1:31:30] little dot in the corner that nobody
[1:31:33] sees,
[1:31:36] right? I want to shine.
[1:31:39] The only way I'm going to shine is do
[1:31:41] something that's
[1:31:42] everlasting, eternal. Do something for
[1:31:45] Christ. Something that makes something
[1:31:47] last. I could go and I could bake you
[1:31:49] cakes. I could build you houses. I could
[1:31:51] I could do whatever you'd want me to
[1:31:54] do, you know, within reason. As long as
[1:31:56] you ask me to build a ship or something
[1:31:58] like
[1:32:00] that. The thing is up there, it's it
[1:32:04] it's nothing. It's not even lasting. I'm
[1:32:07] sure they're not going to have a
[1:32:08] bridgeport at trust or a bridgeport up
[1:32:11] in heaven so I can work. They're not
[1:32:13] going to have a a new CNC's with numeric
[1:32:16] miracle controls that we can do most
[1:32:18] most awesome things.
[1:32:21] But you know what they will they will
[1:32:23] have that one soul that you spent time
[1:32:26] with that their soul meant more to you
[1:32:29] than anything else. That you gave up
[1:32:31] your time. You cared about your child.
[1:32:34] You cared about your neighbor. you
[1:32:37] cared and because you did, they're there
[1:32:40] for eternity. Now, I know if we could
[1:32:42] just focus on
[1:32:44] that, it'll become important to us.
[1:32:47] So, I'll say go home, spend time with
[1:32:49] the
[1:32:50] Lord. Proverbs 11:29, he that troubleth
[1:32:54] his own house shall inherit the
[1:32:57] wind. Did you ever walk through your
[1:32:59] house and say, you going to straighten
[1:33:02] up right now, or I'm going to straighten
[1:33:04] you up?
[1:33:06] Has that ever happened? How come nobody
[1:33:10] is wanting to say anything right
[1:33:16] now? And you know what happened when you
[1:33:19] did that, right? You inherited the wind.
[1:33:23] You had nothing but chaos, confusion.
[1:33:28] Everybody wanting to be just go off,
[1:33:30] leave,
[1:33:33] just I tell you, there's a way that
[1:33:35] seemth right unto man, but the way
[1:33:37] therein is the ways of death. He that
[1:33:40] troubleth his own house shall inherit
[1:33:42] the wind, and the fool shall be a
[1:33:44] servant to the wise of
[1:33:48] heart. The fruit of the righteous is a
[1:33:52] tree of life, and he that winth souls is
[1:33:55] wise.
[1:33:57] Put your priority into winning the
[1:34:00] character of your children to Jesus
[1:34:02] Christ.
[1:34:04] That's all that matters. It doesn't
[1:34:05] matter where the shoes are
[1:34:09] at. You know, it used to matter to me
[1:34:11] where the shoes are at. I'll be honest
[1:34:12] with
[1:34:14] you. I don't care where anything's at
[1:34:17] now.
[1:34:19] I just want there to be God in our home.
[1:34:25] I want when my kids, my grandkids, the
[1:34:27] people that come over and they look at
[1:34:29] me, they don't really see me.
[1:34:34] But you know what it takes for that to
[1:34:35] happen? It takes dying out to the flesh.
[1:34:39] that flesh that just wants to be
[1:34:42] recognized and noticed and look at me
[1:34:45] and reputation and and and and you you
[1:34:49] reduce yourself to love to where the
[1:34:51] only thing that matters is Jesus Christ
[1:34:53] in your life.
[1:34:55] Yes, sir. All right, we got time. Do we
[1:34:57] got time?
[1:35:00] All right. Yeah. I don't know if you
[1:35:01] heard me. I'm going to take it like you
[1:35:03] didn't hear. I'm gonna say it one more
[1:35:04] time. Do we have time?
[1:35:10] How much time? Don't tell me it's
[1:35:12] Mother's Day. You got stuff you got to
[1:35:22] do. All right. I'm not going to read
[1:35:25] everything, but I am going to read a
[1:35:27] little bit
[1:35:29] more. John chapter 15. This is important
[1:35:31] because we're talking about fruit, being
[1:35:34] connected to God.
[1:35:36] John 15:1 says, "I am the true
[1:35:40] vine to every branch in me that bringeth
[1:35:42] forth not fruit is taken away, and every
[1:35:45] branch that beareth fruit, he purchased
[1:35:47] it that it may bring forth more fruit."
[1:35:50] I want you to think here that God's
[1:35:53] interest is not we just be call his.
[1:35:58] He's interested in the fruit. He's
[1:36:00] interested in being connected. In fact,
[1:36:03] we can be connected to God at one time,
[1:36:06] stop bearing fruit, and he will cut us
[1:36:09] off. Think about that. He is so This is
[1:36:12] so important to God that we're always
[1:36:14] bringing forth
[1:36:17] fruit. So you you I want you to in in
[1:36:20] the in the light of these scriptures
[1:36:21] that we're reading, I want you to think
[1:36:22] about
[1:36:23] predestination because, you know, we
[1:36:24] think of predestination, we're always
[1:36:26] connected. We're all, you know, we're
[1:36:27] always there. Nothing's going to happen.
[1:36:28] Nothing's going to separate us. That's
[1:36:29] true. But think about all the people
[1:36:31] that literally believe that they're
[1:36:32] predestinated, but they don't make it.
[1:36:34] So just because we're believing in
[1:36:35] predestination, it doesn't mean we make
[1:36:38] it. That's why Jesus said, "Search the
[1:36:41] scriptures." So the scriptures are
[1:36:44] teaching us what we need to do if we are
[1:36:46] predestined. Amen. What will happen? No
[1:36:48] matter if a righteous man falls seven
[1:36:50] times, seven times he'll get back up. So
[1:36:51] every branch in me that beareth not
[1:36:53] fruit, he taketh that branch away. It's
[1:36:57] not part of me. And every branch that
[1:36:59] bear
[1:37:00] fruit, he doesn't say, "Well, that's
[1:37:02] good
[1:37:03] enough. It's good enough. You're bearing
[1:37:05] fruit." He literally purges it that it
[1:37:08] may bring forth more fruit. He is a God
[1:37:11] that wants to bring the very best out of
[1:37:13] us.
[1:37:16] Now, you are clean through the word
[1:37:18] which I have spoken to you. That's how
[1:37:19] important it is to receive the word of
[1:37:20] God when we come to church. Abide in me
[1:37:23] and I in you. As the branch cannot bear
[1:37:26] fruit of itself except it abide in the
[1:37:28] vine no more except you abide in me. So
[1:37:32] the key here is to stay connected to
[1:37:34] God. Spend time in his presence. You'll
[1:37:37] have strength to bear all sorts of fruit
[1:37:39] when you spend time with God. But if you
[1:37:41] don't spend time with him, you're not
[1:37:42] going to bear fruit. He said, "I am the
[1:37:45] vine." Verse 5, "You are the branches.
[1:37:47] He that abideth in me and I in him. The
[1:37:49] same bringeth forth much fruit." And
[1:37:51] don't forget this, you that are reading
[1:37:54] the Bible, Jesus is speaking. For
[1:37:57] without
[1:37:58] me, you're not going to get anything
[1:38:00] accomplished that day.
[1:38:03] Don't try to go through the day without
[1:38:04] me. Amen. Without me, you can do
[1:38:06] nothing. Amen. If a man a man abide in
[1:38:10] not in me, he is cast forth as a branch
[1:38:14] and is
[1:38:15] withered, and men gather them and cast
[1:38:18] them into the fire, and they are burned.
[1:38:19] You ever been away from God so long that
[1:38:22] you just lost your joy?
[1:38:25] You just you feel withered, puny,
[1:38:28] no excitement, no no drive. You're just
[1:38:31] kind of
[1:38:32] like But what what we need to do is just
[1:38:35] spend time with the Lord.
[1:38:37] Spend time with them. Spend time with
[1:38:39] our shi.
[1:38:42] If my words abide, if you abide in me
[1:38:44] and my words abide in you, shall ask
[1:38:46] what you will and it shall be done unto
[1:38:48] you. Amen. You spend time with me, I'll
[1:38:51] put my word in you. You abide in my
[1:38:53] word. I'm going to give you what you
[1:38:54] want. And you don't. The promise is
[1:38:57] off. Here is my father glorified that
[1:39:01] you bear much fruit.
[1:39:04] And I will claim you as my
[1:39:06] disciple. As the father as the fa as the
[1:39:09] father have loved me, so I've loved you.
[1:39:11] And this is why I want you to continue
[1:39:13] in my love. Go on to perfection. Now, if
[1:39:16] you keep my commandments, you shall
[1:39:17] abide in my love. Even as I've kept my
[1:39:18] father's commandments, and I abide in
[1:39:20] his love. Remember God, the father kept
[1:39:22] giving Jesus
[1:39:23] commandments. He wasn't born came 12
[1:39:26] years old and said, "Okay, go to the
[1:39:28] cross."
[1:39:29] No, it was a building up, a building up.
[1:39:32] And he knew what he was called
[1:39:35] to. But when it was time for him to go,
[1:39:39] he kept the father's commandments. He
[1:39:41] said, "Thus be because my father loves
[1:39:45] me because I lay down my life that I may
[1:39:48] take it up." He kept growing in the
[1:39:51] word, right? It kept it kept his focus
[1:39:55] and and and that's one way you can know
[1:39:56] you're growing in God's love is when you
[1:39:58] literally take the word of God seriously
[1:40:02] and you're you're you're willing. Now
[1:40:04] look, there may be this church, this
[1:40:09] church, I can't probably say this. This
[1:40:12] church may be filled up with 99%
[1:40:17] hypocrites, but that doesn't mean God
[1:40:20] doesn't want you to live this word.
[1:40:22] Have a sincere marriage with the word.
[1:40:26] Let the word become real to you. Don't
[1:40:29] wait till everybody in the front row is
[1:40:31] lined up before you're going to start.
[1:40:33] They may never get lined up.
[1:40:36] They may fake it to the end and then
[1:40:38] quit.
[1:40:40] Don't don't let you get your excitement
[1:40:43] about coming into praising God have
[1:40:44] everything to do with with the brother
[1:40:46] who's leading the worship up here.
[1:40:49] I mean, you can't count on our our our
[1:40:51] brothers to have the most fantastic day
[1:40:54] while we go along. It doesn't matter
[1:40:55] what we do and we expect them to pump us
[1:40:57] up.
[1:40:59] Come into church between you and God and
[1:41:02] have a relationship with him.
[1:41:07] Don't focus on the
[1:41:09] hypocrite or who you think might be a
[1:41:12] hypocrite.
[1:41:14] Focus on the one that you're in love
[1:41:16] with.
[1:41:19] Verse 11. These things have I spoken
[1:41:21] unto you that my joy might remain in
[1:41:22] you, that your joy might be full. And
[1:41:24] this is my commandment that you love one
[1:41:26] another as I have loved you. Greater
[1:41:28] love have no man than this, than a man
[1:41:30] lay down his life for his friends. I
[1:41:33] wonder how many how many friends do I
[1:41:36] have here
[1:41:41] today? Now, when we're in the world,
[1:41:43] this is how it happens. Brother Ron,
[1:41:46] you're my friend, aren't you? Will you
[1:41:48] do something for me?
[1:41:51] That's how it is in the world. We're
[1:41:52] friends, right? I help Will you help me?
[1:41:57] But that's not what the scripture is
[1:42:00] saying. This scripture is saying not for
[1:42:03] me to hold you accountable to love me.
[1:42:06] This scriptur is about me laying down my
[1:42:08] life for you.
[1:42:13] We may not get anybody to love the way
[1:42:16] they should.
[1:42:18] But, you know, I I'm so thankful,
[1:42:20] brother Ron, that my salvation and my
[1:42:22] love relationship of being his bride has
[1:42:24] nothing to do with how much somebody
[1:42:26] loves me.
[1:42:28] It has to do with how much I love them.
[1:42:32] You're my friends, if you do whatever
[1:42:33] I've commanded you, henceforth I call
[1:42:36] you not servants, for the servant
[1:42:39] knoweth not what the Lord doeth.
[1:42:43] I've called you
[1:42:45] friends. For all things that I've heard
[1:42:47] of my father, I've made known to you.
[1:42:50] You have not chosen me, but I've chosen
[1:42:52] you, and I've ordained you, that you
[1:42:53] should go and bring forth fruit, and
[1:42:55] that your fruit should remain, and that
[1:42:57] whatsoever you ask in the Father's name,
[1:42:59] he may give it to you. These things I
[1:43:02] command you, that you love one another.
[1:43:04] What a fruit to be bearing today is the
[1:43:07] love of God. Let's stand together. God
[1:43:08] bless you.
[1:43:12] Psalms 18:1 I will love thee, oh Lord,
[1:43:14] my strength. The Lord is my rock, my
[1:43:17] fortress, my deliverer, my God, my
[1:43:19] strength, in whom I will trust, my
[1:43:22] buckler, my horn, my salvation, my high
[1:43:25] tower. I will call on the upon the Lord
[1:43:28] who is worthy to be praised. So shall I
[1:43:31] be saved from my
[1:43:34] enemies. I am the Lord God Almighty.
[1:43:37] Walk before me and be thou complete. The
[1:43:41] only way we'll be complete is to be
[1:43:44] complete in Christ. Spend more time with
[1:43:46] the Lord. Will you make that commitment
[1:43:48] to him today? Spend more time with him.
[1:43:52] Amen. Let's sing that little chorus.
[1:43:53] There is a There is a place.
[1:44:02] There is a
[1:44:06] place that I can
[1:44:09] go. There is a
[1:44:12] peace that I can
[1:44:15] know. There is a
[1:44:18] joy I can
[1:44:21] attain. There is a
[1:44:24] strength that will remain.
[1:44:28] There is a

[1:46:13] You know, there's so many people in the
[1:46:14] world that don't know that source of
[1:46:16] strength. That's right.
[1:46:18] They don't know where to go
[1:46:20] to and they're fumbling around looking,
[1:46:23] reading
[1:46:24] books, looking to people, depending on
[1:46:28] others. And God is our source of
[1:46:31] strength. What a blessed people we are.
[1:46:34] that God has provided us a place that we
[1:46:37] can go and wait upon
[1:46:40] him and know that the answer is on the
[1:46:44] way. that we can receive a a
[1:46:48] peace that we can receive everything
[1:46:50] that we have need of in the presence of
[1:46:53] Almighty God.
