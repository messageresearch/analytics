[31:54] to Genesis chapter 1. I want to read a
[31:58] couple of scriptures here.
[32:04] Praise the Lord.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 1 verse 26.
[32:14] And God said, "Let us make man in our
[32:17] image, after our likeness, and let them
[32:20] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[32:22] and over the fowl of the air, and over
[32:24] the cattle, and over all the earth, and
[32:27] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[32:29] upon the earth." So God created man in
[32:32] his own image, and the image of God
[32:34] created he him. Male and female created
[32:38] he them.
[32:40] I'd like you to turn to St. John 14.
[32:50] St. John 14 verse 19 and 20. It says,
[32:53] "Yet a little while and the world seeth
[32:56] me no more, but you see me because I
[33:00] live, ye shall live also. At that day
[33:03] you shall know that I am in my father
[33:06] and ye in me and I in you."
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[33:13] Dear Lord Jesus, we're grateful, Father,
[33:16] Lord, for all the things that you've
[33:18] given to us. Heavenly Father, we're
[33:20] thankful for a place to worship you and
[33:24] the abilities, Father, to pay the bills,
[33:26] Lord, and and put food on the table and
[33:29] have a house to live in. But Lord, more
[33:31] than that, we desire to have you living
[33:34] in our hearts.
[33:36] We just pray that you'll be merciful to
[33:38] us tonight. That you just come and break
[33:40] the bread of life. Forgive us of our
[33:42] sins and our shortcomings. Cleanse us of
[33:45] our unrighteousness, Lord. And may you
[33:47] just come and walk with us. Lord, we
[33:50] just ask you to we just invite your
[33:52] presence in Jesus Christ's name we ask
[33:55] it. Amen.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[34:00] Amen. So I'd like to speak for a little
[34:03] while about oneness.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; So the word oneness means to be one with
[34:11] oneness or united.
[34:14] So now the first man and the first woman
[34:16] in the garden of Eden was in perfect
[34:18] harmony with God so much that God could
[34:21] come down at any time he desired and
[34:23] talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; And that's perfect oneness.
[34:30] And the thing that I thought was so
[34:32] interesting about that when I read that
[34:33] quote was that God came down and spoke
[34:37] to Adam and Eve lip to ear. It wasn't
[34:41] Adam and Eve chasing after God and said,
[34:43] "Hey, will you talk to me?"
[34:45] &gt;&gt; He came down because they were in
[34:48] oneness.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; He came down anytime that he wanted to,
[34:52] anytime he desired to talk lip to ear to
[34:55] Adam and Eve. And that is perfect
[34:57] oneness. God and his creation. God
[35:00] speaking lipto ear with Adam and Eve.
[35:02] And they were so perfect in harmony with
[35:04] God till there was they were one with
[35:07] God. God and his family was one. Amen.
[35:12] And any man and his family, a correct,
[35:14] good, noble, obedient family is one with
[35:17] one another. Any family. And if there's
[35:19] something in that family that moves them
[35:21] apart, well then you know there's
[35:22] something wrong. The family's broken
[35:24] somewhere. They should all be one.
[35:26] Father with mother, mother with father,
[35:28] children with a parent, parents with the
[35:30] children, all in agreement. And when you
[35:32] see that, you'll see one lovely picture.
[35:35] And that is God's purpose. And his
[35:38] purpose as father supreme was to be one
[35:41] with his family, his earthly family,
[35:44] Adam and Eve. And the only way that that
[35:46] could be done, one with his family or
[35:48] with God, was because God's nature was
[35:52] in them.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that made them with God's
[35:55] nature in them. Then with each other and
[35:57] God, they become all one. And isn't that
[36:00] a beautiful picture?
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; God and his family,
[36:04] father overall, supreme. No death, no
[36:08] sorrow, no heartache, no nothing. Just
[36:11] joy unspeakable. Never to be sick, never
[36:14] to have a heartache, just one with God.
[36:16] And what a picture. Because the very
[36:18] nature of God was in these people. And
[36:22] therefore what they did, they followed
[36:24] just in line with God and God was with
[36:27] them and that made them one. Amen.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; If you turn over to Genesis or to St.
[36:33] John 17
[36:36] &gt;&gt; and read verse 8 to 11, it says, "For I
[36:40] have given unto them the words which
[36:42] thou gavest me, and they have received
[36:45] them, and have known surely that I came
[36:47] out from thee, and they have believed
[36:49] that thou did send me. I pray for them.
[36:52] I pray not for the world, but for them
[36:54] which thou has given me. For they are
[36:57] thine, and all mine are thine, and thine
[37:00] are mine, and I am glorified in them.
[37:04] And now I am no more in the world, but
[37:06] these are in the world, and I come to
[37:08] thee, holy father, keep through thine
[37:11] own name those whom thou hast given me,
[37:14] that they may be one as we are.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; And that is God's purpose. His purpose
[37:21] is nothing else but that he might be one
[37:25] with his creation. Jesus prayed that the
[37:28] church and he would be one like he and
[37:30] the father was one. That the church, we
[37:33] are members of the body of Christ. We
[37:34] would be one together just like he and
[37:37] the father are one. And at that day we
[37:40] would know that he was in the father,
[37:42] the father was in him and he is in us.
[37:44] That together we are one. And what a
[37:47] union, a oneness that would be to see
[37:49] God in his church till every member is
[37:52] just perfectly in harmony with each
[37:54] other and God. Amen.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; That's the church that Jesus is coming
[37:58] for.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; That's what is prayer. That's when it'll
[38:02] be answered and we will be one. And it
[38:05] is the only grounds of fellowship that
[38:08] God has ever laid down for himself and
[38:11] his church is the oneness of himself and
[38:14] his people.
[38:17] Everything that Jesus did, he always
[38:20] pointed to his oneness with his father.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "I can't even move. I can't do
[38:27] anything until I see the father move
[38:30] me."
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; I came in my father's name and you don't
[38:33] even receive me. But he said, I that
[38:36] oneness that I have, I want to share it
[38:39] with my creation. Amen. Amen.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; That's what he wants. the oneness of
[38:45] himself and his people. And that's the
[38:47] only grounds of fellowship. That's the
[38:50] only way that you can have those grounds
[38:52] is by a union to be united with him
[38:55] forever.
[38:57] Not just for a week or a couple of days.
[38:59] You know, people sometimes they come to
[39:02] church and they they get all enthused.
[39:04] They come to the altar and they repent
[39:06] and everything else, but they never stay
[39:07] long enough to get born again.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; They never stay long enough to become
[39:11] one with God. And the first thing that
[39:13] happens then they're back out doing the
[39:16] same things that they always did. Amen.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, he said, "So just
[39:21] like when you unite with your husband,
[39:23] the woman to unite with her husband, it
[39:26] is a vow unto death." Now then when you
[39:30] unite with God, it's the same thing that
[39:33] the church united with Christ. It's
[39:36] until death we part. And then if you
[39:39] never sin or do anything wrong, you'll
[39:41] be eternally united with God. And only
[39:45] death can take you away from God. And
[39:47] not physical death, but the sin of
[39:49] death. Sin is death. And that will take
[39:52] you away from God. So to be united with
[39:56] him in the spirit of his power, that is
[39:58] eternal life. And you're eternally
[39:59] united with him. And I want to get that
[40:02] to you. United eternally with the
[40:05] eternal God. Perfectly in harmony with
[40:07] him. perfectly united together. A church
[40:10] that is both God and his church is one
[40:14] united together.
[40:16] So if you notice how that Eve was united
[40:19] with Adam, she became a part of him.
[40:21] God, did you notice in Genesis 1:27,
[40:25] which is where we started? Amen. And if
[40:28] we go back there and you and you bring
[40:29] that scripture back up, he said, "So God
[40:33] created man in his own image. In the
[40:36] image of God created he him male and
[40:39] female created he them." Amen.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; He created him. Man, male and female
[40:46] created him. So the man was both male
[40:48] and female when he come to the earth
[40:51] being in the spirit of feminist and
[40:52] masculine. Then God took from his side a
[40:56] rib. So, did you notice the body part
[40:59] was a byproduct,
[41:02] right?
[41:04] &gt;&gt; But not the spirit.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Not the spirit. The body part of the
[41:13] woman was a byproduct. After the
[41:16] creation had been finished, God took
[41:18] from the side of Adam and a rib and made
[41:20] a woman, but not the spirit. The spirit
[41:23] was part of Adam, for he was both man
[41:26] and woman, spiritually speaking, both
[41:29] masculine and feminist. So if you look
[41:32] over in in Hebrews 10,
[41:35] praise the Lord. Amen.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; We just got to get the fire a little
[41:43] burning here a little bit.
[41:46] In verse 5 in Hebrews 10, Paul writing
[41:49] about this oneness relationship with
[41:53] God.
[41:55] He said, "Wherefore, when he cometh into
[41:57] the world, he saith, sacrifice and
[41:59] offerings thou wouldest not." It is not
[42:03] that I can come and sing better than
[42:05] anybody else or what kind of offerings I
[42:07] can have, but he said, "A body thou hast
[42:11] prepared for me."
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:14] That is where oneness becomes.
[42:17] Amen.
[42:19] And then if you go to Ephesians 5.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:28] In Ephesians 5, it says this
[42:33] verse 30.
[42:39] It says, "For we are members of his
[42:42] body, of his flesh and of his bones,
[42:47] not
[42:48] a byproduct,
[42:51] &gt;&gt; but part of that glorified body."
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus's body was not born of
[42:58] sexual desire like yours and mine is.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Yours and mine, we are we're our body
[43:07] which is a byproduct. It's not part of
[43:09] the original creation.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; It's not.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; It was. The only reason that we're here
[43:16] and we live in the house that we live in
[43:18] is because two people came together with
[43:21] a desire that they loved one another and
[43:24] through their union, you came into
[43:26] being. Amen.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:29] So he says, "But we are members of his
[43:32] body, of his flesh, and of his bones."
[43:38] And he says, "For this cause shall a man
[43:40] leave his father and his mother and
[43:41] shall be joined unto his wife, and the
[43:44] two shall become one flesh." Amen. And
[43:47] this is a great mystery. But I speak
[43:50] concerning Christ and the church. So
[43:53] now, Brother Brandham said, "So, don't
[43:55] you see this great picture? We in flesh
[43:58] are different. We are like a byproduct,
[44:01] a created being by holy wedlock. but in
[44:05] the spirit. If we're born again of the
[44:08] spirit of God, then are we sons and
[44:11] daughters of the great God of heaven.
[44:13] Amen.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; And we return back to that same oneness
[44:17] that Jesus had if we yield ourselves to
[44:21] that Holy Spirit.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Look at 1 Corinthians 12.
[44:30] Praise the Lord. Amen. That's why it's
[44:33] so important. People just miss the whole
[44:36] significance of being born again. But if
[44:39] you're never born again, you'll know
[44:41] why. You can't you you it's just a book.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; It will always just be a book.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; It will always just be dos and don'ts.
[44:51] It'll always just be a striving to
[44:53] become better. And brother Benham said,
[44:55] he said, "We're not reformers. We're not
[44:58] trying to reform people. We're trying to
[45:00] get people to be find out who they
[45:02] originally were at the beginning. Amen.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12 verse 12 says, he says,
[45:11] "For as the body is one and hath many
[45:14] members, and all the members of that one
[45:16] body, being many are one body, so also
[45:20] is Christ. For by one spirit are we all
[45:23] baptized into this body, not this flesh,
[45:27] because this flesh is corruption. Amen.
[45:31] Whether we are Jew or Gentiles, whether
[45:33] we be bond or free, and have been all
[45:35] made to drink into one spirit. Amen. We
[45:39] are in his likeness, in his unity, in
[45:42] the perfect image of the living God.
[45:44] Because we became sons and daughters,
[45:47] not separated, but the same spirit, the
[45:51] same God, the same person joined in
[45:54] wedlock to the eternal. Praise the Lord.
[45:58] Amen.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the cornerstone of the
[46:02] Christian walk. Oneness.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Oneness. We have to be one with our
[46:10] heavenly father. Amen.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:14] God, the same person joined in holy
[46:16] wedlock to the eternal. See how God
[46:19] planned it that we should not be a
[46:21] different but him. Not some other being
[46:25] of some other tribe but a real union and
[46:28] offspring of the almighty done by a holy
[46:31] union. And the body comes our body comes
[46:34] from our mother and father.
[46:36] Our union. That's how we came here. But
[46:40] if you're born again of the spirit of
[46:42] God, that spirit that's inside of you
[46:46] came from God and it's going back to
[46:48] God.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:54] Don't
[46:55] but the spirit come from God and God
[46:58] separating himself as Adam was
[47:01] separated. So we want to remember that
[47:06] &gt;&gt; because so if we go back to St. John 14
[47:11] I want you to notice
[47:15] in St. John 14
[47:19] verse 19 and 20 he says yet a little
[47:22] while and the world seeth me no more so
[47:27] when he gave this statement the world
[47:30] saw him but they only saw the body the
[47:34] outward they didn't see Jesus told
[47:37] Nicodemus Nicodemus said how can I be
[47:39] born again he said shall I climb back up
[47:41] in my mother's womb and and and come
[47:43] back out he says And he and Jesus told
[47:46] him, he said, "You being a teacher," and
[47:48] he said, "You don't even understand the
[47:51] first parts of the moving of the Holy
[47:53] Ghost.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; You you're not even getting past first
[47:56] base."
[47:59] &gt;&gt; He says, "Because here I am." He says,
[48:01] "I'm standing right here in front of
[48:03] you, but yet I'm still I'm in a heavenly
[48:05] place."
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Looking at my father. Amen. So in verse
[48:10] 19, he says, "Yet a little while, and
[48:12] the world seeth me no more." So in verse
[48:15] 19, the world was seeing him,
[48:19] but you see me, but the disciples didn't
[48:22] really see him.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; They just saw the body.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Philip asked him that one time. He said,
[48:28] "Oh, Jesus." He says, "Please show us
[48:30] the father."
[48:31] &gt;&gt; And Jesus looked at him and said,
[48:33] "You're just looking at the body
[48:35] &gt;&gt; because there's a oneness here."
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; There's a oneness that's that you
[48:40] haven't even gotten to yet.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Because you haven't been to the upper
[48:43] room. you haven't been born again and
[48:45] your eyes are. He says, "Have I been so
[48:46] long with you that you don't even know
[48:48] me?" I wonder how much of the church is
[48:51] like that
[48:52] &gt;&gt; that they've been so long following
[48:55] after God and they don't even know him.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; But the real union that brother Renham
[49:01] talked about, he said in the garden, the
[49:03] real union was God could come down to
[49:05] his creation and speak to them whenever
[49:09] he wanted to. It wasn't them chasing
[49:12] after him and saying, "Lord, speak to
[49:14] us. Speak to us. Speak to us." God moved
[49:16] on his face of the earth.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; God moved on his creation. The father
[49:21] came and spoke to Jesus. And Jesus knew
[49:24] enough to wait till the father moved
[49:27] before he did anything
[49:29] &gt;&gt; because everything that he did glorified
[49:31] God, not himself.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[49:37] So we see in chapter 14 he says yet a
[49:41] little while and the world will see me
[49:43] no more. But if you look over at chapter
[49:45] 17
[49:47] and you look at verse 11,
[49:50] he says, "And now I am no more in the
[49:55] world."
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Where physically
[50:00] he was in the garden fellowshipping with
[50:03] the spirit,
[50:06] &gt;&gt; but he was getting ready.
[50:09] He was now no longer in the world.
[50:14] But you, all of us, we are still in the
[50:18] world. And because of that, I come to
[50:22] the Holy Father. And he said, "Keep
[50:24] through thine own name those whom thou
[50:27] hast given me that they may be one
[50:31] &gt;&gt; as we are one."
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:34] Brother Brennham said, he said, "So ye
[50:36] in me, I in you, that they might be one,
[50:39] the Father, even as you and I are one,
[50:42] God and Christ, Christ in the church,
[50:45] just as we are one." So they should be
[50:47] one. Then how can you be one?
[50:51] That's the question tonight. People are
[50:53] always wondering, "How can I be a better
[50:54] Christian? How can I do this?" Be one
[50:56] with God.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the question's answered.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Then the rest is it's a rest. It's no
[51:04] longer a struggle if you get the Holy
[51:06] Ghost.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "Because if you abide in me and
[51:12] my words abide in you, see, abide, my
[51:15] word in you, then ask what you will, for
[51:17] it isn't you anymore. It's the word
[51:20] that's in you, and that word is God."
[51:23] Amen.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; So, if you flip back to St. John 14
[51:27] again
[51:30] and we started well
[51:33] let's just look at verse 20 he says so
[51:36] at that day
[51:38] what day when I'm no longer in the world
[51:42] right now I'm in the world but there's
[51:44] coming a time when I won't be in the
[51:46] world and in that day that's the time
[51:50] when you will know that I am in my
[51:52] father and you are in me and I am in
[51:57] you.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; And that's the whole problem
[52:01] &gt;&gt; because we've not become one with our
[52:04] heavenly father.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; We got too much of ourselves stuck in
[52:08] the picture.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Too much of our own ideas, too much of
[52:11] our we we're not because look at what
[52:13] verse 21 says. He that hath my
[52:16] commandments and keepeth them, he it is
[52:18] that loveth me. And verse 21
[52:23] is going right back to St. John 1:1
[52:27] In the beginning was the word and the
[52:29] word was God and the word was with God
[52:34] and then the word came down and became
[52:38] manifest
[52:39] and walked amongst us. We could hold
[52:42] him. And those are the same commandments
[52:44] that Jesus is talking about here in
[52:46] verse 21. He said, 'If you can become
[52:48] that,
[52:51] he it is that loveth me, and he that
[52:52] loveth me shall be love to my father,
[52:55] and I will love him and will manifest
[52:57] myself to him.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[53:02] Adam was a part or Eve was a part of
[53:04] Adam. She was flesh of his flesh and
[53:07] bone of his bone. And the difference
[53:10] with Adam and Eve was that Adam was a
[53:14] created being from God. Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; His body was not created by the union of
[53:22] beast.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; It was created by God himself.
[53:28] God brought the the the pod ash and and
[53:32] all of the chemicals together and the
[53:34] dust and the and everything and he
[53:36] brought it together. God created that
[53:38] body. That's not so with yours.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; That's not so with mine.
[53:44] And when he brought them together and
[53:46] then when he took the rib out of Adam
[53:49] and he created Eve, she
[53:54] was the same thing. She might have been
[53:56] a byproduct, but she was not a a an
[54:00] attribute of a union between two people.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:06] Amen.
[54:08] She was flesh of his flesh and bone of
[54:10] his bone. And that's what the correct
[54:12] union is. And that's what the correct
[54:14] union of the church is. Spirit of his
[54:16] spirit, word of his word, never
[54:18] deviating from the word. The real true
[54:20] believer will not compromise on any
[54:23] word. Why? A real true believer can't
[54:26] compromise on the real word.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus couldn't compromise on the word.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Satan told him, he said, "Hey, if you're
[54:33] if you're, you know, okay, you could be
[54:36] God, you you could be the son of God,
[54:38] but if you're God, then you have
[54:40] creative power. turn these stones into
[54:42] bread.
[54:44] You're hungry. How many times have you
[54:47] thought of that? Well, I'm sick. I'll
[54:50] pray and God will give me a miracle and
[54:52] it didn't happen. And other times, I
[54:55] need this and you pray and it didn't
[54:57] happen. But if the spirit of God comes
[55:00] down and directs you to pray, it'll
[55:03] happen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll happen every time. Amen.
[55:10] So he says never deviating from the
[55:12] word. The real true believer will never
[55:14] compromise on the word. Remember it was
[55:17] just one word that Eve compromised on.
[55:20] But the true believer, he won't
[55:22] compromise on any word. It'll hold the
[55:24] sword of faith rather the sword of the
[55:26] word and claim every divine promise God
[55:29] made.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they were God's examples to us
[55:34] what we should be. And them ever
[55:37] present, never failing. When they spoke,
[55:40] God answered. He watched them daily
[55:44] night. When they'd lay down to sleep, he
[55:46] watched over them. In the daytime, he
[55:47] guided them. He fed them. He loved them.
[55:49] He communed with them constantly all the
[55:51] time. Praise the Lord.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When you leave this
[55:56] world and this worldly nature and you're
[55:59] born again of the spirit of God, God
[56:01] will do all those things for you.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; I remember when I gave when I
[56:05] surrendered to him, he took the swearing
[56:09] away. I didn't even ask him to.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; I just said, "I want whatever you
[56:14] whatever it is, give it to me."
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. One time I was working, I was I
[56:20] used to be a truck mechanic and work on
[56:21] these great big trucks and and they'd
[56:23] break the axles and we'd have to cut the
[56:26] the bolts off with a setylene torch and
[56:28] then beat the and then changed it and
[56:31] and I'm underneath this truck and I had
[56:33] cut the bolt off and I had this big
[56:35] drift and a 10 pound hammer and I went
[56:38] bam right on my thumb
[56:41] and I'm
[56:45] and my my buddies, "Come on, Bruce. Let
[56:49] it out." I said, "What do you want?"
[56:51] They go, "We know you want to swear."
[56:54] I said, "There's
[56:57] no swearing in here.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; You cannot manufacture that."
[57:02] &gt;&gt; And if you have to manufacture that,
[57:04] maybe you need to find out what it is
[57:06] you think you got.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Because it will take that away.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; It will.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; It will.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:15] Praise the Lord.
[57:18] It will take and you
[57:21] praise the Lord. So we can be in God
[57:25] united because Adam and Eve was before
[57:27] the fall before the disbelieving of the
[57:29] word was an example of what we could be
[57:32] to him to be united with him is life. To
[57:36] be separated from him is death. And now
[57:38] we must follow his commandments. So
[57:41] let's go back to St. John 17 again.
[57:45] So in St. John 17,
[57:48] he's no longer
[57:51] Jesus is identifying himself that he's
[57:53] no longer in the world.
[57:57] He's moved on. I'm no more in the world.
[58:01] But in verse 20,
[58:05] he says, "Neither pray I for these
[58:08] alone," which was his 12 disciples and
[58:12] those that they had influence over. He
[58:15] said, "Neither pray I for these alone,
[58:17] but for them also which shall believe on
[58:20] me through their word."
[58:24] So what are you doubting?
[58:27] &gt;&gt; That's you.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. because we believe because we
[58:31] heard the report from the disciples that
[58:33] actually were eyewitnesses.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, he said that they all
[58:41] may be one as thou, Father, art in me,
[58:45] and I in thee, that they also may be one
[58:48] in us, that the world may believe that
[58:51] thou hast sent me. And the glory which
[58:54] thou gavest me, I have given them that
[58:57] they may be one even as we are one.
[59:01] I in them, thou and me, that they be may
[59:05] made perfect in one.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; You cannot be made perfect until you're
[59:12] in one unity with God.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Without that oneness,
[59:20] you're just I don't know what you're
[59:22] doing.
[59:25] That's what God wants. He wants us to be
[59:28] one.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:33] All of those quotes are out of the
[59:36] message oneness.
[59:38] But in the oddball, brother Brandon
[59:41] brings out this other example
[59:43] that I want to spend some time on. He
[59:47] says, "I am likening God so that you
[59:49] won't be mixed up in what I've said
[59:51] today. God is a great diamond, the
[59:54] eternal. And when a diamond is brought
[59:57] out of the blue stones of Africa, I've
[59:59] been in the mines and watched them in
[1:00:00] the great how they process this and get
[1:00:03] the diamonds out and how they go through
[1:00:05] the crusher and the great blue fire
[1:00:06] diamonds, black diamonds, they come out.
[1:00:09] They have not much form, certain form.
[1:00:12] They're just a great stone and really
[1:00:16] they have no fire in them at that time
[1:00:20] because it's hid.
[1:00:24] They're just a diamond, a stone around
[1:00:26] smoothed out a lot of them. But this
[1:00:28] diamond, it must be cut. Now, it's
[1:00:31] against the law to have one not being
[1:00:34] cut. It must be cut and then you have to
[1:00:36] have a receipt where you bought it
[1:00:38] because there is millions of dollars in
[1:00:39] them. And I'm liken God to that diamond.
[1:00:44] So in the beginning, before the world
[1:00:46] was ever formed, there was God.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; There was Elohim.
[1:00:53] And if you think of him, just think of
[1:00:55] it
[1:00:57] like a basketball or a soccer ball.
[1:01:00] Brother Brandham said it was just a
[1:01:02] stone.
[1:01:04] And when you looked at the outside of
[1:01:05] that stone, you could not see what was
[1:01:08] inside of it.
[1:01:10] because it had never been cut.
[1:01:13] And God takes his word and cuts.
[1:01:19] And when God said, "Let there be light,"
[1:01:22] there was a chip happened on that stone.
[1:01:25] And out came a little chip called the
[1:01:28] logos. Amen.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; And now when the light that was inside
[1:01:32] the master diamond reflected off of
[1:01:35] that,
[1:01:36] then the seven colors could come out of
[1:01:39] it
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; and it could start to dis to display the
[1:01:44] attributes that were hidden in the
[1:01:46] diamond
[1:01:48] because the diamond it does it just
[1:01:50] looks like a rock. It doesn't look like
[1:01:53] it's much of anything.
[1:01:55] So, brother Brandham said, "So, a
[1:01:56] diamond is cut." So it will it will
[1:01:59] reflect what's on the inside of it. The
[1:02:02] fire that's in the diamond. And it has
[1:02:04] to be cut and to every little way, every
[1:02:06] little shape. Three points. Put the
[1:02:09] three points to a diamond and put a
[1:02:11] light against that three-point object.
[1:02:12] It will give seven colors. See, it'll
[1:02:14] make them seven colors.
[1:02:17] When God created Adam in in Genesis 1
[1:02:21] verse 26 and 27, he said, "Let us make
[1:02:24] God in our image." And God chipped the
[1:02:27] diamond and off came Adam.
[1:02:31] His spirit was the same spirit as God's.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:39] And then as that diamond was chipped,
[1:02:44] different attributes of the creative
[1:02:47] power of God could be displayed.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; But the light came from inside the
[1:02:53] diamond. Amen.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Those little chips couldn't display
[1:02:57] anything until the light reflected on
[1:03:00] them.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; And every one of those little chips has
[1:03:04] to be chipped again and molded so that
[1:03:07] they can reflect the light that's coming
[1:03:11] from God.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:14] So, Adam and Eve, when they had the true
[1:03:17] oneness, the light of God could come
[1:03:20] down and talk to them, lift to ear, and
[1:03:23] they reflected everything that God was.
[1:03:28] If they didn't like the way the wind was
[1:03:30] blowing, Adam could say, "Wind, stop.
[1:03:34] It's blowing a little bit too fast. I
[1:03:37] just want a simple breeze.
[1:03:40] if it's if it's too dry, I need a little
[1:03:43] bit of rain.
[1:03:45] He'd call for that. If he didn't like
[1:03:46] where a tree was, he could. And all of
[1:03:49] those things did not reflect what Adam
[1:03:52] was.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; It reflected what God was.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Because it was oneness.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; It was oneness.
[1:04:04] So he says, so brother Benham said, so
[1:04:06] notice God was wounded for our
[1:04:08] transgression, bruised for our iniquity.
[1:04:11] See, he was cut and bruised. That great
[1:04:15] diamond that from him might be reflect
[1:04:18] the gifts to the church. So, if you
[1:04:21] think about it, you've got this rock
[1:04:25] that has all these attributes inside of
[1:04:28] it and it gets chipped and the logos
[1:04:31] comes out and then it gets chipped again
[1:04:35] and the world comes into existence and
[1:04:38] the logos broods over that and life
[1:04:41] comes out of there. Those seeds,
[1:04:44] everything that was in there was already
[1:04:46] in the master diamond when it was
[1:04:48] chipped off.
[1:04:51] All those seeds, all those attributes,
[1:04:53] all those things, all the look all the
[1:04:56] animals. God created all the animals.
[1:04:58] Brother Adam Bradom said, "Oh, he
[1:04:59] started with a tadpole and then he went
[1:05:00] to this one and he went to that one and
[1:05:02] then he went to the fish, then he went
[1:05:03] to and all these things." So God created
[1:05:07] all those things. You believe that?
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; But we didn't know what they were.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; They're just things that God created.
[1:05:16] But God brought them to somebody who was
[1:05:20] one with him.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; He brought them to Adam and he said,
[1:05:24] "Adam, what is that?"
[1:05:27] And he said, "Well, that's a rainbow
[1:05:28] trout."
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; And God didn't argue with him. God said,
[1:05:32] "You're right. That's what a rainbow
[1:05:34] trout is."
[1:05:36] And when he saw an elephant, he said,
[1:05:38] "Adam, what is that?" And Adam said,
[1:05:41] "That's an elephant." Because it has the
[1:05:43] attributes of an elephant. and it has a
[1:05:45] long nose on it and it's big. It has big
[1:05:48] legs and things like that. It's not a
[1:05:50] cat. Doesn't have hair on it. And never
[1:05:53] one time in the book of Genesis does God
[1:05:55] ever argue with Adam
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; because they were one.
[1:06:00] Jesus when he finally came, the problem
[1:06:04] that God saw is that he kept trying to
[1:06:07] reflect his word on fallen flesh
[1:06:11] till there came a time when he had to
[1:06:13] chip off his own diamond again and
[1:06:16] create a body that was not born of
[1:06:20] desire
[1:06:22] because it wasn't our desire that asked
[1:06:24] for him to come.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who, which one of you was, you
[1:06:27] know, when you were four or five said,
[1:06:29] "Oh, you know, I think I need a savior."
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; God came of his own accord
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; and he made a body that was likened unto
[1:06:41] ours, but it wasn't sinful flesh.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; It wasn't. And then he was able to
[1:06:49] bruise that body. And in the bruising of
[1:06:52] that body, make a a way back for the
[1:06:57] believer
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; to be one with God.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; But where'd the spirit come from?
[1:07:04] From the diamond before the world began.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; God kept chipping off. And that was you.
[1:07:10] And it was chipping off. And that was
[1:07:12] you. And that was you, Brother Beckman.
[1:07:14] Chipped off. Not Not after when your
[1:07:16] parents came together and you were born
[1:07:18] on your birthday. You were chipped off
[1:07:21] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:07:23] that chip followed you until the day of
[1:07:28] God's reckoning when he called and you
[1:07:32] answered.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; And that's what Psalm says.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; When he calls, I will answer.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; When he called, I'll answer. And God,
[1:07:41] because he called me, I am one with him
[1:07:44] because I came from him. It's not a
[1:07:47] different chip.
[1:07:49] It's not us bringing something to God
[1:07:51] and saying, "But it's God that chipped.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; He chipped. He chipped it again. He
[1:07:57] chipped it again." And you look at your
[1:07:59] life. Your life was a mess.
[1:08:02] You tried to your best to be good. You
[1:08:04] tried your best to be whatever best is.
[1:08:08] And you kept failing and everything
[1:08:09] else. But one day, God called. And when
[1:08:14] he filled you with his spirit, then the
[1:08:17] word of God could it quit being a letter
[1:08:20] and it became life.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; It became a part of you. So much so that
[1:08:25] you don't even have to think about it.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; I have the attributes of my father. In
[1:08:30] fact, I look at him every morning when I
[1:08:33] get up in the and look in the mirror. I
[1:08:34] go, "Oh, there's dad."
[1:08:37] I don't look like brother John because
[1:08:39] there's no connection physically between
[1:08:42] me and brother John.
[1:08:44] There's no connection. But you look in
[1:08:47] the mirror and you'll see a connection
[1:08:49] with your family, with your your earthly
[1:08:52] union. But that's not one. That's not
[1:08:56] oneness with God.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Oneness with God is when God steps down
[1:09:02] behind the veil
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; and starts living through you. Not of
[1:09:06] your own intellect or your own idea, but
[1:09:09] he starts living that word which was
[1:09:12] born in you from the beginning. Amen.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Which makes one. Amen.
[1:09:19] It isn't. He says that great diamond
[1:09:22] that from him might reflect the gifts to
[1:09:25] the church. And it isn't the light
[1:09:26] because the light must return back when
[1:09:28] the sun is off of it to where it has
[1:09:30] been cut from. But every little piece
[1:09:33] that comes from the chipping is not
[1:09:36] destroyed. It's put to use. You know,
[1:09:39] people today, they they're all afraid.
[1:09:41] People are afraid they're going to miss
[1:09:42] it. They're afraid that God's going to
[1:09:44] somehow reject this. Brother Brandham
[1:09:48] gives a great example. I love it. He
[1:09:50] said, 'When you have a diamond, a rock,
[1:09:54] and you take it and you start chipping
[1:09:57] away at it, every little piece they
[1:10:00] keep.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Every little piece. And then they chip
[1:10:03] them again and they chip them again. And
[1:10:05] he and back in the 60s when he preached
[1:10:08] this, he said they take the smallest
[1:10:11] little chip and he says they put it on
[1:10:14] the end of a needle
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; and they put it on a record
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; and it brings out hidden music
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; because when you buy a record and nobody
[1:10:24] knows what a record is anymore
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; because you're going to see
[1:10:29] see the record has music but you have to
[1:10:34] have a dime. time in order to play the
[1:10:38] record,
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; in order to see the hidden mystery
[1:10:42] that's hid in that piece of plastic.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; You can't.
[1:10:48] And brother Brennham said, he said, "God
[1:10:51] chipped you off of him.
[1:10:53] You're a chip."
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And one day he takes you and he
[1:10:58] takes his chip
[1:11:01] which is Jesus Christ and he places that
[1:11:04] Jesus Christ down on you and he says and
[1:11:08] the attributes of the record can now be
[1:11:11] heard.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:14] And if you know anything about
[1:11:16] technology,
[1:11:17] I'll tell you how far off we are because
[1:11:21] we went from records that were played by
[1:11:24] diamonds.
[1:11:26] We went to CDs.
[1:11:29] CDs are played by light. There is
[1:11:32] nothing touching the record, but a light
[1:11:36] touches it. And the light is able to
[1:11:38] bring the music out. But after we had
[1:11:42] CDs for a while, we switched everything
[1:11:45] to digital.
[1:11:48] And when everything went digital, you
[1:11:50] talk to a real person that knows
[1:11:52] something about
[1:11:55] this piano.
[1:11:58] If I had a guitar, I could show you on a
[1:12:00] guitar. This piano has a hammer in it,
[1:12:03] which is just like God.
[1:12:07] That hammer is hitting a wire. And when
[1:12:09] it hits that wire, that wire vibrates.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; And when that wire vibrates, it makes a
[1:12:15] sound.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; But when a digital piano, which sounds
[1:12:20] like a piano, there's no vibration.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; There's no life.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; There's no life. Oh, it sounds like a
[1:12:28] piano.
[1:12:31] But the life, the life in a violin is
[1:12:34] the bow making the wire vibrate. The
[1:12:38] life in the church, the oneness in the
[1:12:41] church is the Holy Spirit moving on you
[1:12:44] and causing you to vibrate.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; And it makes the sound of God. It makes
[1:12:49] the life of God become manifest because
[1:12:52] oneness is what we're looking for.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking to become brother John.
[1:12:56] I'm not trying to become brother
[1:12:58] Brandham. I want to become who I was
[1:13:00] before the foundation of the world when
[1:13:01] I was with him. When he chipped me off.
[1:13:05] Amen.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:08] Amen. You see, we've gotten so far off,
[1:13:11] we don't even we Nobody wants DVDs.
[1:13:15] Nobody wants Blu-ray discs. Nobody wants
[1:13:18] records. Now, there there's a revival
[1:13:20] right now. People are looking for vinyl
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; because they're trying to go back to
[1:13:26] feel that vibration.
[1:13:29] But see, they can't. They can't. You
[1:13:31] can't do it with a iPhone playlist.
[1:13:35] You can't do it. It's just it's not the
[1:13:40] same.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; It's not the same. The church, the
[1:13:45] reason God sent a prophet, the reason he
[1:13:48] fulfilled Malachi 4, all of it was to
[1:13:51] get you to vibrate when the spirit moved
[1:13:54] across your heart
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; to bring you back to where you were.
[1:13:59] When God asked Job, he says, "Where were
[1:14:01] you when I laid the foundations of the
[1:14:03] earth?"
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; And Job is wise enough to say
[1:14:11] nothing because God was rebuking him.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; He said, Job, he says, you're talking
[1:14:15] about things you don't know anything
[1:14:16] about. He says, but you know, I did
[1:14:18] create all this stuff. I put the stars
[1:14:21] in the place. I did all I I lift up who
[1:14:24] I lift up. I put down who I put down. I
[1:14:26] am the God of the heaven and earth.
[1:14:29] Amen. I am the one that you should be
[1:14:32] reflecting.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we want to reflect. We
[1:14:36] don't want to reflect just another
[1:14:38] church group or another
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; church believer. I mean,
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; because they're all digital.
[1:14:46] You'll find out. You go, you're going to
[1:14:48] be, "Oh, yes, I'm a Christian. Oh, yeah.
[1:14:51] Yes, I read the Bible. Oh, really? Good.
[1:14:54] There's no vibration."
[1:14:56] You ask him about it, they go, "Oh, no.
[1:14:58] Well, it doesn't really mean that."
[1:15:02] I worked with a guy one time.
[1:15:06] He told me, he said, he said, "Bruce,
[1:15:09] you know, because I'm kind of weird,
[1:15:12] everybody see when when you when you're
[1:15:15] a chip off the block, you are unusual
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; and you can't be usual because God's
[1:15:21] unusual
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; and you walk in someplace and they all
[1:15:24] know you're unusual."
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; And I had a man, he come, he told me, he
[1:15:28] says, he goes, "I got to be a reader in
[1:15:30] church." I said, "Oh, wow. That's great.
[1:15:32] That's a great honor." I said, "What?
[1:15:33] what is that?
[1:15:36] And he says, "Well, it's Lent." And he
[1:15:37] says, "I'm a Catholic." And he says, "I
[1:15:39] get to get up and read the scriptures in
[1:15:41] the mass." And I said, "That's a very
[1:15:43] honorable thing. That's that's
[1:15:45] wonderful." And he was I was all he was
[1:15:48] really excited about it till he got
[1:15:50] hurt. And then he started using all
[1:15:53] kinds of language. And I looked at him.
[1:15:54] I said, "Is that your Lenton language?"
[1:15:59] Amen.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Is that the language you know people ask
[1:16:02] they say, "Well, Bruce, what are you
[1:16:04] giving?" I I gave up everything for Lent
[1:16:08] and I'm not going back to it
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; because there's something inside
[1:16:12] vibrating. When the word of God strikes,
[1:16:15] when the spirit of God strikes, there
[1:16:17] has to be a vibration.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It can't be just a dead
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; I remember taking my grandson. We we
[1:16:28] went to a car show and this guy had this
[1:16:30] car and and he had Guitar Hero. You know
[1:16:33] Guitar Hero? Oh yeah. That's not real
[1:16:36] guitar playing. I don't know if you know
[1:16:38] that.
[1:16:40] That's just pushing buttons and
[1:16:41] following colors. I'm really good at
[1:16:43] Simon says. You ever seen Simon? That's
[1:16:46] the age I'm from.
[1:16:48] We we were handing around Simon with my
[1:16:50] brother-in-law and and they were they
[1:16:52] were listening to the tune or they were
[1:16:55] watching the flashing of the lights for
[1:16:56] the order because you know it starts up
[1:16:58] with one and then that start they were
[1:16:59] watching and I was listening to the tune
[1:17:02] because I have that gift.
[1:17:05] So as long as I could hear the tune I
[1:17:07] could I could follow the tune and I'd
[1:17:09] always win.
[1:17:12] You see? But that's not playing music.
[1:17:15] That's not playing. That's That's not
[1:17:17] That's Pick up a guitar. There's a It
[1:17:21] You have to strike the string.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; God has to strike our hearts.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; God has to bring a vibration in us.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; And then the word of God will become
[1:17:32] alive. It's too dead.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Because we've never had him prick us.
[1:17:38] Amen.
[1:17:40] Amen.
[1:17:42] I hope you see what I mean.
[1:17:45] the chip from Christ, the gift from
[1:17:48] Christ, you put it upon the Bible and
[1:17:50] it'll speak out hidden mysteries of God
[1:17:53] to the believer.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:57] When I read this the Bible and the
[1:17:59] spirit of God is there, all of a sudden
[1:18:02] I start seeing things
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; because it starts to vibrate. Amen.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; He says, "Praise the Lord. You put it
[1:18:14] upon the Bible, it'll speak out hidden
[1:18:16] mysteries of God to the believer. He
[1:18:17] knows the secrets of your heart. He
[1:18:20] knows every person. Do you believe that?
[1:18:22] And it won't be the diamond saying, "You
[1:18:24] see what I am?" He'll be saying where he
[1:18:27] came from. The diamond is a diamond
[1:18:30] because he's off of a diamond.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; There is never a diamond. And I got a
[1:18:35] couple of diamonds on my ring, but
[1:18:37] they're not they're just a little chip
[1:18:39] off the big diamond somewhere.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; This evening, you have to be a chip off
[1:18:46] of the big diamond.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Brother Brandham says, he
[1:18:51] says in the audible, he says, "Now, you
[1:18:53] see a pen, you could get a pen, but it
[1:18:57] won't play the record. A regular sewing
[1:19:00] needle won't play the record." Praise
[1:19:03] the Lord.
[1:19:04] I don't know if you know what on a
[1:19:06] phongraph,
[1:19:08] this is really old, but on a phonograph,
[1:19:12] the diamond is on the end of the needle
[1:19:15] and the needle goes up and there's two
[1:19:17] magnets and it vibrates between the
[1:19:20] magnets to make the sound.
[1:19:23] There's a vibration.
[1:19:25] Praise the Lord. I like it.
[1:19:30] He says the diamond won't be saying,
[1:19:31] "You see what I am?" He says, "A diamond
[1:19:34] is a diamond because he's off of a
[1:19:35] diamond." And a pin won't play the
[1:19:37] record right. A regular sewing needle,
[1:19:39] it won't play it right, but a diamond,
[1:19:41] it's the best. It brings out a clear
[1:19:43] diamondpointed needle.
[1:19:46] And may God tonight, your record of
[1:19:49] life, remember brother Brandham said
[1:19:52] that. He said, he said, "We all have a
[1:19:55] record
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; and it's placed
[1:19:59] and then it's played." And he says,
[1:20:02] "When you get to the end of the record,"
[1:20:04] he takes the needle off of it and he
[1:20:06] takes the record and he puts it back in
[1:20:09] the sleeve. He puts it back. And then on
[1:20:12] the day of judgment, he takes it out. He
[1:20:14] puts it on the phonograph player and he
[1:20:16] sets it down there and listens to see
[1:20:19] what kind of life came out of that
[1:20:22] record when the needle struck it.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Oneness with God.
[1:20:28] oneness.
[1:20:31] That's what we need.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:35] May your record of life, whatever what's
[1:20:37] wrong with you, whatever you're desiring
[1:20:40] from God, may the great master who holds
[1:20:43] the needle in his hand, may he put it
[1:20:46] upon your life and reveal to us what
[1:20:49] you're here for, what you want,
[1:20:52] and then we'll know that he's here. And
[1:20:56] what are we then today? We are stars.
[1:21:00] And I know in the last couple services
[1:21:02] we've heard about you are the light of
[1:21:03] the world. You you can't be the light
[1:21:07] unless you're reflecting a light from
[1:21:09] somewhere.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Because there is no light in us
[1:21:14] because we're sin born. But if you're a
[1:21:17] chip off the old block,
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; if you go back and read the adoption
[1:21:21] series, brother Brandham says, he says,
[1:21:23] oh, he says he's got the tutor. And the
[1:21:27] book of Galatians talks about it says
[1:21:28] we're under tutors. We're under people
[1:21:31] that are trying to chip us into shape.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; And he said he'll ask the tutor, he
[1:21:36] says, "How's my son doing?" And you know
[1:21:39] what he always says? Every time you find
[1:21:41] it in the message, Brother Brandham
[1:21:43] says, "He's a chip off the old black."
[1:21:48] Amen. Are you a chip off the old block?
[1:21:50] Are you just hanging on or are you just
[1:21:54] bringing trying to trying to mold
[1:21:56] yourself into something that
[1:21:59] that
[1:22:02] Amen. We are stars. Every born again
[1:22:05] Christian is a testimony to the Lord
[1:22:08] Jesus Christ. a star to reflect his
[1:22:10] power in the holiness of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:12] Christ to reflect him that is life to
[1:22:16] reflect him in his speech to reflect him
[1:22:18] in his healing power to reflect him in
[1:22:20] his resurrection to reflect him in every
[1:22:22] way that he was reflected to us by God
[1:22:24] the father we are stars and we cannot be
[1:22:28] an ordinary we have to be unusual we
[1:22:31] cannot be usual because God's people are
[1:22:34] peculiar people
[1:22:36] always been through the ages is although
[1:22:39] peculiar yet the star is brilliant not
[1:22:43] brilliant in the world's educational
[1:22:45] world affair but brilliant as a
[1:22:47] sacrifice before the lord and we
[1:22:50] prostrate ourselves as the magi did in
[1:22:52] the presence of the king of kings to
[1:22:54] reflect his light and you're a star
[1:22:57] every Christian's a star to guide the
[1:22:59] lost to guide the weary the foot of the
[1:23:02] traveler to those who are seeking and
[1:23:04] the star cannot be guided by itself It
[1:23:08] must be led by a spirit.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Every every part of your life
[1:23:16] has to be led by the spirit of God.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:21] Amen.
[1:23:23] It must reflect the brilliancancy of God
[1:23:26] in its life. To abstain from the things
[1:23:28] of the world, to live godly and soberly
[1:23:30] in this present life, it must reflect
[1:23:32] the light of this great one that shine.
[1:23:36] And that's what he is. He is only a
[1:23:38] reflection of the word. And that's what
[1:23:40] he is today. A reflection of the word.
[1:23:44] Trying to find somebody to reflect
[1:23:47] himself through
[1:23:50] oneness.
[1:23:53] Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; You want to be that?
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[1:24:05] Dear Lord Jesus,
[1:24:09] Lord, your word,
[1:24:11] when it struck our lives, there was a
[1:24:14] vibration.
[1:24:15] And we're so thankful
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; for that vibration.
[1:24:19] We're so thankful that it sprung to life
[1:24:23] and the word of God became real.
[1:24:26] And the word, we'd be reading it and
[1:24:29] say, "Oh, I think I've I think I know
[1:24:31] this." Though you've never seen it. And
[1:24:35] Lord, as sons and daughters, we meet
[1:24:38] people from across the world, different
[1:24:40] nations, different states, different
[1:24:42] areas, and we can tell there's a kindred
[1:24:45] spirit when the spirit of God is born in
[1:24:49] their hearts. And I pray, Lord, tonight,
[1:24:52] though the message might seem simple,
[1:24:55] Lord, I pray that you'll just deal with
[1:24:57] us, Lord. That you'll let us remember
[1:24:59] that we're a chip. We're a chip of the
[1:25:02] master diamond, Lord. And through the
[1:25:06] chip, we can reflect the light that's
[1:25:09] behind us. We can reflect the light of
[1:25:12] the invisible God to this dying world. I
[1:25:15] just pray that you'll just grant every
[1:25:18] request, Lord. May you give each and
[1:25:20] every believer, Lord, give each answer
[1:25:24] their prayers. Reveal yourself to them.
[1:25:27] Show them that you are real and that you
[1:25:28] are God and you don't change. and you
[1:25:31] don't fail
[1:25:33] and and you always keep your promise. I
[1:25:37] pray, Father, I pray that you'll just
[1:25:39] move by your spirit. We love you. We
[1:25:42] commit this all into your hands. In
[1:25:44] Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:53] and I don't have a song.
[1:25:58] So, it's all yours, Brother John.
[1:26:03] [Applause]
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Few.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; I am one of the few.
[1:26:19] I am one of the few. Yes, I'm one of the
[1:26:25] few. And by faith in God's word, I can
[1:26:29] claim it.
[1:26:31] Though the way may seem long and the
[1:26:34] opposition strong, for the bride,
[1:26:37] there's a way provided.
[1:26:42] If I plan to go through just to hope
[1:26:46] will not do, I must be firmly decided
[1:26:52] to follow the Lord by obeying his word
[1:26:57] and believe that I'm one of the few.
[1:27:03] I'm one of the few. Yes, I'm one of the
[1:27:07] few. And by faith in God's word, I can
[1:27:11] claim it.
[1:27:13] Though the way may seem long and the
[1:27:16] opposition strong, for the bride,
[1:27:19] there's a way provided.
[1:27:23] If I plan to go through just to hope
[1:27:27] will not do, I must be firmly decided
[1:27:34] to follow the Lord by obeying his word
[1:27:39] and believe that I'm one of the few.
[1:27:45] And believe that I'm one of the few.
[1:27:51] Oh, how do we become one?
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; By become one with the word.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; By obeying the word.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Um
[1:28:05] Jesus
[1:28:07] was perfect.
[1:28:10] He was one with the father.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; We're born in sin. So we become more and
[1:28:17] more one with the father
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; through taking the word that we heard
[1:28:22] tonight
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; and striving to become more like Jesus.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. It cannot happen without us
[1:28:32] claiming it and and and
[1:28:37] confessing it and and just believing
[1:28:40] every time we hear the word. Brother
[1:28:42] Brandham said, "The Holy Ghost says amen
[1:28:45] to every word of God."
[1:28:48] And uh we're becoming more like him.
[1:28:50] It's an invisible union. Brother
[1:28:52] Brandham said, "We're becoming more like
[1:28:55] Jesus." Let's sing uh one of them. One
[1:28:58] of them.
[1:29:01] Amen.
[1:29:03] There are people almost everywhere whose
[1:29:07] hearts are all afflicted. With the fire
[1:29:10] that fell at Pentecost, which cleansed
[1:29:13] and made them clean, it is burning now
[1:29:17] within my heart. All glory to his name.
[1:29:21] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:29:24] them.
[1:29:26] One of them.
[1:29:29] One of them.
[1:29:32] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:29:35] them.
[1:29:37] One of them.
[1:29:40] One of them.
[1:29:43] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:29:46] them.
[1:29:48] Though these people may not learned nor
[1:29:52] boast of worldly fame, they have all
[1:29:55] received their Pentecost baptized in
[1:29:58] Jesus' name and are telling now both far
[1:30:02] and wide. His powers yet the same. I'm
[1:30:05] so glad that I can say I'm one of them.
[1:30:11] One of them.
[1:30:13] One of them.
[1:30:16] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:30:19] them.
[1:30:22] One of them.
[1:30:24] One of them.
[1:30:27] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:30:30] them.
[1:30:32] They were gathered in the upper room all
[1:30:36] praying in his name. They were baptized
[1:30:39] with the Holy Ghost and powerful service
[1:30:43] came. Now, what it did for them that
[1:30:46] day, he'll do for you the same. I'm so
[1:30:50] glad that I can say I'm one of them.
[1:30:55] One of them.
