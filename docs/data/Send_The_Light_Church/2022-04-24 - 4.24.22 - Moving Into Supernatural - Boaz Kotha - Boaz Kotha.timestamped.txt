[8:02] was four stage you know
[8:04] and we couldn't do anything and
[8:07] we tried to do our best to
[8:10] take him to the hospitals and do some
[8:12] treatments
[8:14] but
[8:15] at the end of the you know
[8:17] 15 20 days he said don't take me
[8:20] anywhere i know my time has come you
[8:23] know
[8:24] and as i said you know
[8:26] when our time is finished you know
[8:29] and nobody can stop you know
[8:32] and he died in in my hands and in in in
[8:35] front of me and
[8:37] i saw the
[8:38] you know
[8:41] the the pulse coming down from
[8:44] 94
[8:45] down to zero
[8:46] and he opened his eyes in front of me
[8:49] and you know he just gave his last
[8:51] breath and
[8:52] but before
[8:54] he passed away
[8:56] he called me and my brother
[8:59] and he said
[9:00] don't stop
[9:02] the work
[9:03] which i have carried for 55 years
[9:06] and
[9:09] it's tough you know
[9:13] this morning
[9:15] i also lost one of my closest associate
[9:19] minister
[9:20] this morning you know india time
[9:23] you know u.s time three o'clock in the
[9:25] morning and i got a phone call
[9:27] so it's tough when you lose some of your
[9:29] dear ones you know
[9:31] but we have a great uh
[9:33] hope that we will meet them
[9:35] we will see them you know we'll see all
[9:37] our dear ones you know and
[9:41] he's been a great missionary you know
[9:43] yeah
[9:44] my dad has been a great missionary you
[9:46] know and
[9:47] we built 109 churches you know
[9:50] for the poor ministers and you know
[9:53] raised many orphans boys and girls you
[9:56] know
[9:57] many of them are preachers you know many
[9:59] of them are
[10:00] standing for the lord you know
[10:02] and in the in the nation of india it's
[10:05] not easy to
[10:06] you know
[10:07] raise
[10:08] uh
[10:09] anybody you know and we feed more than
[10:12] 550
[10:13] mouths every day three times you know
[10:16] and
[10:17] that's all by the grace of god you know
[10:19] nothing nothing great about us you know
[10:23] as the bible says in as much as you have
[10:25] done unto the least of these my
[10:27] brethrens
[10:28] you have done it unto me so we are just
[10:31] trying to fulfill
[10:32] what matthew 25 40 44 talks about you
[10:36] know
[10:37] james 1 27 you know and
[10:39] so
[10:40] it's the grace of god it's been tough
[10:43] you know because since the kobe
[10:46] uh the lack of support you know without
[10:49] the support you know we can't go far you
[10:51] know and
[10:52] so
[10:54] remember the ministry in india in your
[10:56] prayers
[10:57] since january 1
[10:59] baptized 172 people you know
[11:02] and it's it's the it's the greatest
[11:05] achievement
[11:06] you know in spite of kobe you know
[11:10] yeah this is the world we are living in
[11:12] where
[11:13] all the mouths are shut you know
[11:15] eyes are open you know
[11:17] no shaking of hands no hugging no you
[11:20] know no close you know no fellowship
[11:23] but thank god you know that we could
[11:25] still
[11:26] have meetings and revival is going on
[11:29] people are hungry for the word of god
[11:31] you know people are hungry for the
[11:32] message you know
[11:34] and
[11:35] that's how we could
[11:36] you know reach out to the unrich people
[11:39] you know and
[11:40] and without the grace of god without
[11:41] your prayers and without your support
[11:44] you know i don't think we can obtain we
[11:47] can go far you know as we have gone far
[11:51] till now you know so continue to uplift
[11:53] us in your prayers you know
[11:56] we live in a very
[11:58] you know it's a the prophet of god said
[12:01] we live in a golden age you know
[12:03] but
[12:04] we still are in such a dangerous age you
[12:07] know
[12:08] that where we need to
[12:10] uh see
[12:12] uh the state we are in today you know
[12:15] we need to see the situation the
[12:17] position we are in today you know and i
[12:21] mean when i say
[12:22] we need to see our state or our position
[12:26] our situation means i want to talk about
[12:29] you know spiritually you know you know
[12:31] physically you know we have our own
[12:34] heartaches our battles you know and
[12:37] and so we are spiritually you know
[12:40] every day is a battle for us you know
[12:42] you know and i i was just i had another
[12:46] message all together prepared you know
[12:49] um
[12:50] last night you know but but after i
[12:53] uh got the news
[12:55] of the death of my associate minister
[12:57] you know
[12:58] suddenly the lord brought me to this
[13:01] you know that we need to move on you
[13:03] know
[13:04] we can't stop in one place
[13:07] the problem today is when we stop
[13:11] you know you know it doesn't matter
[13:14] what
[13:16] fallen state we are
[13:18] it doesn't matter how many times we fall
[13:21] but it all matters
[13:23] are we rising up or not
[13:25] and we need to rise up from our
[13:27] situation you know
[13:28] you know that's what paul is
[13:31] speaking about you know you know
[13:33] by the mercies of god
[13:36] we need to present our bodies as a
[13:39] living sacrifice
[13:41] which is holy acceptable unto god and
[13:44] which is original sacrifice you know
[13:46] service you know
[13:48] we don't do any uh
[13:51] you know
[13:54] we are not doing anything to god you
[13:57] know
[13:58] you know god is doing everything for us
[14:00] you know you know we need to be grateful
[14:03] or thankful to what god is doing for us
[14:06] you know you know you know how we can be
[14:08] a living sacrifice how we can move on in
[14:11] our lives you know
[14:13] you know how we can you know
[14:15] be
[14:16] a blessing
[14:18] to god to people you know
[14:20] when we renew our mind you know
[14:23] the prophet said you know
[14:26] the people are in such a state that they
[14:29] are losing their minds
[14:32] you know people are becoming insane
[14:35] you know and this is the this is the
[14:38] time we are that we need to be careful
[14:40] of every step every move we make today
[14:43] you know you know
[14:45] and how can we renew our mind is solely
[14:47] by the word of god you know you know and
[14:50] when we renew our mind every day when we
[14:53] dedicate our ourselves to god every day
[14:56] you know that will prove
[14:58] and that is acceptable and it's the
[15:00] perfect will of god
[15:03] we are all born natural how many of you
[15:05] believe we are all natural you know you
[15:08] know you were all
[15:09] born you know by the curse of sin you
[15:12] know and you know
[15:14] because of the sin because of the fall
[15:16] in the garden of eden you know
[15:19] death came in you know
[15:20] in in in the garden of eden you know
[15:25] they were born natural you know but
[15:27] thank god you know they was covered
[15:30] spiritual you know you know
[15:32] you know after sin
[15:34] the fallen aid and glory of god left
[15:37] them
[15:38] amen you know
[15:41] they were covered in sin you know
[15:44] and sin makes us decrease our spiritual
[15:47] life
[15:47] you know to natural life you know you
[15:50] know
[15:51] we were born natural you know but when
[15:53] we are you know born again you know when
[15:56] we are when we are accepted
[15:58] christ when we are baptized when we are
[16:01] filled with the holy ghost you know
[16:03] we are no more natural we are no more
[16:05] carnal you know
[16:06] we are spiritual you know and we can't
[16:09] stay there you know we can't stay in our
[16:11] natural state
[16:13] we can't stay there we can't stop you
[16:16] know we might fall we might fail but we
[16:19] can't stop
[16:21] we need to move on amen and that's what
[16:24] god wants us don't stop
[16:28] no matter what circumstances comes in
[16:30] your life
[16:31] maybe no matter how many
[16:33] bigger storms rages in your life come
[16:35] over you know
[16:37] we need to move on
[16:39] we need to move on from from natural to
[16:41] spiritual from spiritual to supernatural
[16:46] if we don't move on to supernatural then
[16:49] we are in trouble you know
[16:51] you know
[16:52] we are spirit being and
[16:54] it was the original design of god that
[16:57] we need to be
[16:58] filled with the spirit
[17:00] and the satan always perverts that you
[17:03] know right
[17:04] when we came with our body we came also
[17:07] with the spirit you know
[17:09] what makes the natural man is the spirit
[17:11] body and the mind you know
[17:14] and you might say brother how can a
[17:16] natural
[17:17] being become a spiritual being what
[17:20] makes you spiritual you know
[17:22] coming to church
[17:23] no
[17:24] giving tights and offerings no
[17:27] praying singing dancing no
[17:31] the prophet said there is only one
[17:33] qualification to be spiritual from
[17:35] natural is hunger for god's word
[17:39] that's the only qualification today
[17:42] that we can be spiritually you know
[17:45] moving on you know from natural to
[17:47] supernatural
[17:49] is hunger for the word of god
[17:53] that's the only qualification
[17:55] it doesn't matter whatever background is
[17:57] today it doesn't matter what our
[18:00] generation
[18:01] was and is you know right
[18:03] it's sinful the whole world is sinful
[18:05] you know
[18:06] you know
[18:07] but
[18:08] when we try to
[18:10] move on when we try to hunger for the
[18:12] word of god that is the only place that
[18:15] god takes you know
[18:17] interest in our lives
[18:19] and he will try to see that he will give
[18:22] strength to move on you know
[18:26] the problem today is church has become
[18:28] very churchy you know
[18:31] church has become too religious you know
[18:33] right you know you know if you have a
[18:35] broken spirit and a willing heart
[18:38] that's what god needs you know god
[18:40] almighty can use any one of you he can
[18:42] use any one of the children here you
[18:45] know you know i'm happy when i see the
[18:47] children writing notes you know you know
[18:51] that's true you know maybe they are the
[18:53] tomorrow's preachers you know they are
[18:55] the tomorrow's backbones for the
[18:57] ministry for the church for the family
[18:59] you know you know
[19:01] that's why you know
[19:03] even
[19:04] the word of god is told strictly to the
[19:06] parents train up a child in a way they
[19:08] should go you know
[19:10] i thank god for my father and my mother
[19:12] you know
[19:14] you know being a land of 33 million gods
[19:17] and goddesses
[19:18] you know
[19:19] not one not two 33 millions gods and
[19:23] goddesses all dead
[19:26] i can't stand and say this in india they
[19:28] will kill me
[19:31] that's true brothers you know
[19:33] i cannot even say jesus is the only god
[19:35] and living god you know
[19:38] but i can boldly stand here and stay say
[19:41] in the land of america
[19:44] that 33 million gods and goddess is all
[19:46] dead
[19:47] but i am so happy that i serve a living
[19:50] god
[19:51] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[19:53] and forever
[19:55] he was the word he is the word and
[19:56] always be the word you know that word
[19:59] manifested in the flesh
[20:02] all we need today is a broken heart all
[20:05] we need is a willingness a willing heart
[20:08] to serve him you know
[20:10] if you're not willing you know you can't
[20:12] come and sit here you know
[20:14] if you can't if you're not willing to
[20:16] serve god you can't practice songs at
[20:19] home you know
[20:21] you have so many other things to do but
[20:23] why you are doing so much so many things
[20:26] is to please god
[20:29] why you are here is not only to benefit
[20:32] of your soul you know hunger for the
[20:35] word of god but it is to please god
[20:38] how can we please god by faith how faith
[20:42] comes by hearing the word of god
[20:45] and that's the only qualification today
[20:47] for the living church for the church of
[20:50] the living god that we need to hunger
[20:52] for the word of god
[20:55] he's not looking for the ability he's
[20:57] looking for the availability you know
[20:59] many people today they don't have time
[21:02] you know to come to the house of god and
[21:03] listen to the word of god
[21:05] they have time for everything
[21:08] but they don't have time for god
[21:11] and i think this is the time that we
[21:14] need to come closer
[21:16] to god you know in the united time and
[21:18] sign he says
[21:20] we need more prayer meetings
[21:23] we need more fellowship you know you
[21:25] know the the greatest connection
[21:27] between god and man today is the
[21:30] fellowship with god his word and his
[21:33] people
[21:36] we need revelation today
[21:38] and if we need revelation today more of
[21:40] the revelation today we need to
[21:43] unlearn religion in our life
[21:48] religion is coming you know
[21:51] you know
[21:52] sister sue was telling me about you know
[21:55] she did not take the vaccine brother
[21:57] bill's wife you know
[21:59] no
[22:01] she said because she did not take you
[22:04] know the vaccine they said you can't
[22:06] work here
[22:08] but she saw that many of the
[22:10] people they started taking vaccine you
[22:13] know
[22:14] you know
[22:17] i want to tell you we can't bring
[22:19] religion between you and god
[22:23] religion will not help us you know
[22:25] and if we need revelation we need to
[22:28] unlearn the religion what religion has
[22:31] taught us
[22:32] thank god for calvary thank god for
[22:34] jesus christ he has paid the price for
[22:37] us
[22:38] the prize was paid once for all amen
[22:41] fasting doesn't help us
[22:45] amen
[22:47] no
[22:48] fasting helps us but fasting doesn't
[22:50] help god
[22:52] i was testing you
[22:54] you know fasting helps us
[22:57] fasting doesn't help god
[22:59] fasting is not paying for sins
[23:02] doing good is not paying for sins
[23:06] goodness is the fruit not the root
[23:10] sometimes we say oh our good works will
[23:12] save us
[23:13] no our good works will not save us you
[23:15] know
[23:16] religion will teach us to do good
[23:20] to find already what is found
[23:24] no revelation
[23:25] no life amen that's right if we don't
[23:28] have the revelation of the word of god
[23:30] we can't move on
[23:32] spiritually we can't move on
[23:34] supernaturally
[23:36] you know thank god for jesus christ what
[23:38] he did on calvary hebrews 10 14 says for
[23:41] one by one offering he had perfected
[23:43] forever them that are sanctified
[23:48] if we do not grow spiritually
[23:50] then we are growing religiously
[23:54] and if you don't check it then from
[23:56] spiritually you will become religiously
[23:59] and religion will make us carnal
[24:05] amen
[24:06] and carnal mind is a demon's food
[24:12] many times most of the people today and
[24:15] all our lives we have lived that life
[24:18] you know born again on sunday
[24:21] and gone again on monday
[24:25] that's true
[24:26] we have we have lived that cycle
[24:30] unknowingly knowingly we have lived all
[24:33] our life
[24:34] born again on sunday gone again from
[24:37] monday to saturday
[24:40] that's why i said the church has become
[24:42] too churchy
[24:46] again
[24:46] gone again
[24:48] you know
[24:49] but in supernatural the supernatural 56
[24:52] he says i thought of a parable there he
[24:54] said my sheep know my voice
[24:57] a stranger they will not follow
[25:01] the sheep was born under the tutorship
[25:03] of this shepherd
[25:05] he learns that voice
[25:07] he will never pay attention to anybody's
[25:10] else voice
[25:11] he learns that shepherd's voice
[25:14] another shepherd might call they might
[25:16] do whatever they want to but there's
[25:19] some little something about that
[25:21] shepherd
[25:22] that the sheep recognizes
[25:24] see that's the way it is with god's
[25:26] sheep strange voices
[25:30] it just don't sound right
[25:32] they just don't go
[25:34] that's all if sheep can be tempted but
[25:37] when it finds out that it's a wrong
[25:39] shepherd
[25:40] it will turn away
[25:43] and here come a shepherd down the street
[25:45] walking walking along
[25:47] he's talking about india you know and
[25:49] behind him a string of sheep a city
[25:51] block long and them sheep walking right
[25:54] by that produce and things that wouldn't
[25:57] turn right or left they kept their eyes
[26:00] on the shepherd moving right on through
[26:04] oh god what a shepherd means not look
[26:07] right or left not be tempted by this or
[26:10] that but walk in the footsteps of the
[26:12] shepherd
[26:14] hallelujah not only god has given us a
[26:18] shepherd in this house
[26:20] but there is a great shepherd too know
[26:24] a mighty shepherd a chief shepherd which
[26:26] god has given you know
[26:28] and he talks about you know while he was
[26:31] traveling in that british jeep riding he
[26:33] says there was a shepherd had a whole
[26:35] lot of animals upon a hill and he was
[26:37] feeding them they were leading them and
[26:39] taking them places and in there he had
[26:42] sheep
[26:43] in there he had goats mules camels
[26:46] everything he was feeding them all they
[26:48] were all grazing the shepherds was
[26:51] watching them i said my shepherd
[26:54] here means many thing he said a shepherd
[26:56] is a grazier you know he said you know a
[26:58] strange thing he says when the night
[27:01] comes you watch said all the sheep go
[27:04] right straight to the shepherd
[27:07] the mules will stay out
[27:10] in the pasture
[27:11] the camels will stay out in the pasture
[27:14] the the goats will stay out in the
[27:16] pasture but the sheep all come straight
[27:19] to the shepherd when night comes
[27:22] praise the lord
[27:25] just a wizzle you know
[27:28] i know i live in that country you know
[27:31] just a whistle you know he might have
[27:32] hundreds and hundreds of flock you know
[27:36] different flocks different sheeps you
[27:38] know
[27:39] but when the night comes
[27:42] all the sheaves which belongs to their
[27:45] you know
[27:46] place they go there in the night time
[27:49] and i think
[27:51] we need to come back to the pavilion
[27:54] praise the lord it's time we need to
[27:56] come back to the pentecost
[27:58] it's time that we need to come back to
[28:00] the old time religion
[28:02] it's time we can't stop natural
[28:06] in natural life
[28:08] doing the things of this world
[28:11] the lust of flesh the pride of life
[28:14] how long you know
[28:16] how long will be trying to be busy in
[28:18] this world you know right
[28:20] we have learned the art of doing nothing
[28:23] right
[28:24] that's true
[28:26] we have learned the art of doing nothing
[28:33] we have become busy for nothing
[28:37] you call anybody hey what are you doing
[28:40] brother i'm busy
[28:44] busy for nothing
[28:47] busy doing nothing
[28:51] it's time to come back to
[28:53] you know pentecost it's time to come
[28:55] back to pavilion it's time to come back
[28:58] where we have left god
[29:02] we have spent all our life
[29:04] born again gone again
[29:08] we must grow spiritually every day amen
[29:12] as you know what makes us from moves us
[29:15] from natural to supernatural
[29:17] natural to spiritual is hunger for the
[29:19] word of god
[29:20] physical hunger no food you will die
[29:24] you know this morning my blood sugar was
[29:26] below 100 you know never has been in my
[29:28] life you know it's been almost fasting
[29:31] is almost more than 250 and and the
[29:34] post lunch is almost about 400.
[29:37] the first time in my life for many years
[29:40] it's below 100 this morning and i just
[29:42] came running i said sister i need
[29:44] something to eat
[29:47] no hunger for the food you know no
[29:49] hunger no food physical language you
[29:51] will die
[29:52] in the same way you are not hungry for
[29:54] the world you will die spiritually
[30:00] and if you want to live spiritually if
[30:02] you want to move on to supernatural if
[30:04] you want to move on spiritually you need
[30:07] to kill your flesh
[30:10] and i think killing your flesh is a bunt
[30:12] offering to god
[30:15] that's why paul says i die daily
[30:19] and that's a good opinion you know in
[30:22] these days we need to die daily
[30:25] my brothers my sisters the revelation of
[30:27] god will make us hungry for god and his
[30:30] word
[30:31] church experience will not help us
[30:36] let us not only stay in the church
[30:39] there is more beyond these church doors
[30:42] it is very easy young people i am
[30:44] telling you it is very easy to live
[30:46] holy
[30:48] in the four walls
[30:50] it's very easy to be holy in the house
[30:53] you know
[30:54] live a holy life
[30:55] in the church you know
[30:58] but it all counts
[30:59] how we
[31:00] execute ourselves how they function when
[31:03] we are all by ourselves amen that's
[31:05] right that counts
[31:08] that's very important in our life
[31:11] how
[31:11] we are when we all are by ourselves
[31:16] church experience will not help us
[31:19] we need revelation we need mountain top
[31:21] experience amen
[31:24] let us not stop you know jesus never
[31:26] stopped at get so many

[31:51] calvary he tried to stop him in grave he

[34:11] experience we need to move on to hell
[34:13] experience
[34:14] last three years i'm telling you this is
[34:17] one of the worst
[34:19] hell experiences in my 50 years of my
[34:22] life
[34:26] when you see the persecution rising in
[34:28] the nation of india the hindu government
[34:34] bibles are being burnt

[34:41] jobs begging on the streets
[34:44] children's little children eating from

[34:55] the whole ground excavated and
[34:58] dug in and the bodies just thrown and
[35:01] they filled up
[35:07] heap of bodies

[35:28] distribute provisions for almost 650
[35:32] families
[35:34] families i'm talking about
[35:38] help more than 427 children
[35:42] with food and provision they're all
[35:44] believers
[35:47] my heart is for the believers
[35:50] but they are poor
[35:52] there are needs of the bible the bibles
[35:54] are being burned the bibles are being
[35:56] taken away
[35:57] the printing bible printing shops are
[35:59] being closed
[36:03] the government wants to wipe out
[36:05] christianity wipe out all the churches
[36:08] by 2023
[36:15] he might take you to through hell
[36:18] but he did not stay there
[36:21] he might take you to the grave
[36:22] experience but he did not stay there
[36:24] amen he might allow the enemy to nail
[36:27] you
[36:29] to pierce you
[36:31] to mark at you to spit on you
[36:33] to make fun of you
[36:39] but you don't have to be nailed there
[36:41] and stay there forever
[36:43] he's reason
[36:47] he's no more there
[36:53] only revelation will lead us to
[36:55] resurrection
[36:57] when moving towards resurrection you
[36:58] need to go through grave experience amen
[37:02] you need to move on
[37:05] there is power in the resurrection amen
[37:09] then he was alive he said who do you say
[37:11] i am
[37:13] revelation said you are the messiah amen
[37:16] you are the son of the living god you
[37:18] are christ
[37:20] jesus said flesh and blood did not
[37:22] reveal you but my father in heaven has
[37:24] revealed you amen hallelujah you won't
[37:28] get revelation in the church
[37:31] you will get revelation on the
[37:32] mountaintop experience
[37:34] you need to grow higher
[37:37] your survival should have a revival
[37:40] and only revelation can bring that
[37:42] revival in you and i believe we are the
[37:45] candidate of revival today
[37:48] the prophet said don't search for
[37:50] revival here and there you are the
[37:52] revival
[37:54] you are the revival amen
[37:56] we are looking for revival here and
[37:57] there we are looking for oh
[38:03] whom should i invite whom should i go
[38:04] and come to church no no no you'll be
[38:07] the fire first amen
[38:09] you'll be that revival first when you be
[38:12] that revival everything will come
[38:14] running to you
[38:18] that little spark of fire bro
[38:21] it can lit the whole mountains
[38:24] sometimes you see the californian fires
[38:27] a little spark
[38:29] it can
[38:30] take thousands of mountains hundreds of
[38:33] mountains
[38:35] oh
[38:36] your survival should have a revival amen
[38:41] no revival no survival
[38:44] and only revelation can bring that
[38:46] revival in us
[38:47] and i thank god i am a candidate of
[38:49] revival
[38:50] i am a revival
[38:52] hallelujah
[38:54] moses did not stop right
[38:57] in egypt 40 years in the back side of
[38:59] the desert 40 years but it was time
[39:03] god had mercy upon moses he wanted to do
[39:05] greater things in his life and i want to
[39:07] tell you my brothers my sister when god
[39:09] wants to use you when god wants to see
[39:12] that you are a vessel of honor that he
[39:16] can use you he will bring you through
[39:18] that desert he will make your failure he
[39:20] will make you a zero
[39:26] what did moses say i am a bitter failure
[39:29] but thank god
[39:32] he showed him that light
[39:34] he showed him that supernatural
[39:37] moses could have been happy just looking
[39:40] from the lower part of that desert
[39:44] he could have just seen
[39:47] oh it's good
[39:50] sometimes we do that oh the message was
[39:52] good
[39:54] the sermon was good
[39:56] the court was good
[39:58] the lifeline was good
[40:00] this tape was good
[40:03] no no no let us not talk the message he
[40:06] said leave the message
[40:10] he said come out of this mess age
[40:18] not the word
[40:20] is it come out of this mess age
[40:23] the world we are in it's totally messed
[40:26] up
[40:28] the church needs to wake up to the
[40:29] spiritual atmosphere are you there
[40:33] it is i be not afraid he says the little
[40:35] boat as it dashed on across the lake it
[40:38] must have been about that time that
[40:40] satan must have raised up and said oh i
[40:42] have caught them alone without him
[40:45] now my time to settle the score with
[40:48] them for they had been casting out my
[40:50] demons and so forth i will settle the
[40:52] score with them that's when satan can
[40:55] settle the score when he finds that you
[40:57] have gone off without jesus
[41:04] that's when satan will get the church
[41:06] when you get interested in so much in
[41:09] something else besides prayer meetings
[41:13] when you get so interested that you are
[41:15] supposed to have a natural growth
[41:17] instead of a spiritual growth then
[41:19] remember satan's on the road he has
[41:22] caught you without jesus
[41:28] he says my prayer wake up
[41:31] the church again to the old
[41:32] old-fashioned
[41:34] all-night prayer meetings
[41:38] wake the people up to spiritual
[41:39] atmosphere it takes that to bring
[41:42] children into the kingdom it takes an
[41:45] atmosphere
[41:50] we are living in a faceless generation
[41:52] that's what paul said
[41:54] follow me as i follow christ
[41:58] you know
[42:00] it takes the atmosphere the prophet said
[42:05] and in the in the message the
[42:06] supernatural he says
[42:09] that's the reason at pentecost they had
[42:12] to go to an upper room and pray until
[42:14] holy ghost came
[42:16] because it's the attitude of the people
[42:19] that brings the result
[42:23] it's the attitude what attitude you come
[42:26] to the house of worship amen
[42:31] he says that's the reason i had
[42:32] pentecost they had to go to an upper
[42:35] room and pray until the holy ghost came
[42:37] because they got in one place and one
[42:40] icon
[42:41] it's the atmosphere what brings the
[42:43] result you believe that you know
[42:46] and it's the atmosphere that brings the
[42:48] miraculous and wonders and powers of god
[42:51] among the people it's the atmosphere of
[42:53] the people and when people get to a
[42:55] place
[42:57] oh they're reasoning and wondering and
[43:00] stewing and thinking and all tore up and
[43:02] don't know where they do stand half of
[43:05] them not even scripturally thought how
[43:08] can you expect the atmosphere to be
[43:10] right in
[43:12] you can't do it it won't be right
[43:15] it got to be one accord one place and
[43:18] settle down with one more tear
[43:22] that something is fixing to happen
[43:26] and that's the hardest thing today
[43:29] is to people get in that atmosphere
[43:32] atmosphere of worship and the atmosphere
[43:35] of believing
[43:37] my brother is my sister truth is where
[43:40] god is
[43:42] amen do you believe that
[43:44] truth is where god is
[43:46] revelation is where god is
[43:49] revelation is where god is and god is
[43:52] going
[43:53] holy spirit will bring us
[43:55] the revelation of the truth and the
[43:57] revelation is the truth revealed
[44:00] that's why he said you shall know the
[44:02] truth and the truth shall make you free
[44:05] what is the secret of your strength
[44:07] today
[44:09] when you walk in revelation amen
[44:12] walk by faith
[44:13] not by wallet
[44:16] sometimes we walk more than our wallet
[44:18] you know
[44:19] but we need to walk by faith we need to
[44:21] walk in revelation
[44:23] and no bank balance no money no problem
[44:26] right
[44:27] we need to walk in faith
[44:30] we must be kingdom minded amen
[44:34] when you are spiritual you will be
[44:36] kingdom minded

[46:11] he just said do what i tell you
[46:14] and that's what we need sister do what
[46:17] he tells us to do
[46:22] and when we have that revelation
[46:25] i'm telling you
[46:27] whatever it tells us to do we will do it
[46:32] if we don't have the revelation we will
[46:34] start reasoning
[46:37] and that is where the problem today
[46:39] why
[46:40] the big question why is bothering us all
[46:46] he said calm down your nets peter i am
[46:48] the creator of the fish
[46:51] peter you are the creation too
[46:54] amen
[46:56] creation is longing for the creation of
[46:58] man
[46:59] fish is born again peter is gone again
[47:05] hallelujah
[47:07] you know just one word he cashed the net
[47:09] all the fish are gone come you know in
[47:11] the net
[47:13] our hearts desire that he should
[47:15] manifest
[47:17] when he manifests that means his word
[47:19] has manifested in our life
[47:25] how many of you desire to go into the
[47:27] net of jesus
[47:29] not in the
[47:31] www world wide web
[47:34] that's dangerous
[47:37] internet is nothing but entering into
[47:39] the net of the enemy
[47:44] how many hours we spend
[47:48] have you ever calculated
[47:51] per day per week
[47:53] what is your screen time
[47:57] just go and look into that
[47:59] you don't even know you have passed many
[48:02] hours
[48:04] many hours
[48:07] don't even know
[48:09] don't even realize don't even understand
[48:11] but what is the enemy doing he is taking
[48:14] you into that net
[48:20] one day
[48:21] a believer came to the pastor one week
[48:24] he said pastor
[48:27] there's a
[48:29] web you know the spider web in my home
[48:31] it's all spreading
[48:33] what should i do
[48:35] he said go clean it
[48:37] he went and he cleaned that sunday you
[48:39] know and by the next sunday again it
[48:42] formed you know
[48:43] almost two three times
[48:46] he said what shall i do about my web you
[48:48] know
[48:49] what shall i do i'm cleaning it but it's
[48:52] not going
[48:53] on the fifth sunday the pastor god said
[48:55] man he said damn it
[48:56] go kill the spider
[49:00] not the web not not cleaning the web
[49:03] go kill that bug
[49:06] and i want to tell you
[49:08] we need to kill that every bug
[49:11] which is destroying our spiritual life
[49:16] it is serious
[49:19] we don't even know how
[49:22] calmly
[49:24] those bugs
[49:26] are coming in
[49:27] and destroying our lives
[49:32] if you would have killed that spider on
[49:34] the first week
[49:36] you wouldn't have so many
[49:38] ups and downs
[49:41] we need to target the right one
[49:45] we need to target the enemy
[49:49] we need to kill that enemy
[49:55] our desire should go that we need to be
[49:57] in the net of jesus christ
[50:00] not in the world wide web of sin not of
[50:02] the enemy and the devil
[50:04] i don't want to be in his class
[50:08] satan will take you to the brim of the
[50:10] hell
[50:11] and he will push you down he will not
[50:13] come with you
[50:15] he will throw you and he will come back
[50:17] to your own
[50:21] you must move on from natural to
[50:23] supernatural
[50:26] revelation is much needed we need to
[50:28] obey the revelation because revelation
[50:30] has power when we obey amen amen what we
[50:34] need to obey it's the word of god
[50:37] revelation has to manifest and if my
[50:40] preaching has no manifestation it's dead
[50:44] if this word has no manifestation no
[50:47] power it's dead
[50:51] when jesus is in us when his presence is
[50:54] heaven is touching earth
[50:56] amen
[50:57] how is heaven touching her it's because
[50:59] of you
[51:01] religion will only talk
[51:05] sing about heaven

[51:10] heaven amen

[52:55] sometimes you try to be a bonsai plant
[52:58] you know have you ever heard about a
[52:59] bonsai plant
[53:01] the bonsai plant never grows
[53:05] no fruit looks green
[53:08] we can't be like that

[53:15] he was hungry
[53:16] it was green
[53:18] it was good
[53:20] but
[53:21] no fruit

[53:34] today

[54:06] families brother

[54:14] humble man that was my father

[54:32] they will become a revival
[54:34] if you move on to spiritual to
[54:37] supernatural they will move on they will
[54:39] look to you but if you stay there
[54:41] natural
[54:42] they will stay there all their life
[54:46] i want to tell you you will have no time
[54:48] even to regret
[54:53] there will be such a time that you can't
[54:54] even regret
[54:57] you will be in pain
[54:59] but you can't do anything about it
[55:05] i'm a candidate of revival
[55:08] i don't want to be on the cross
[55:12] i don't want to be in get some money i
[55:13] don't want to be in the grave right
[55:16] i don't want to be the hell right i want
[55:19] to resurrect
[55:22] i want to move on
[55:26] if i can't move on i want somebody to
[55:29] give me a hand who can push me
[55:40] be a helping hand brother mark
[55:44] sister be a helping hand
[55:50] you can't do good
[55:51] to anybody's physically do something
[55:53] spiritually for them pray for them
[56:04] no one is perfect
[56:07] in noah's ark
[56:09] no one was perfect
[56:12] you know there were animal children in
[56:14] the noah's ark
[56:17] brothers were talking about the noah's
[56:19] ark in kentucky which i would go someday
[56:22] you know
[56:23] but in the bible it talks about
[56:25] noah's heart
[56:27] had a giraffe
[56:30] what's the
[56:31] what's the
[56:33] lifestyle of giraffe
[56:36] the giraffe
[56:37] always looks down upon others
[56:42] all it does is looks down
[56:46] it's true
[56:48] that's the lifestyle
[56:50] and there are many people in the church
[56:51] they always look down others
[56:54] sometimes we act like a giraffe
[56:58] there was a porcupine in the in the
[57:00] noah's ark
[57:03] what does the porcupine do
[57:05] the more you hug the more it hurts
[57:10] i love you brother instead of that
[57:13] warmth of love you feel is pricking you
[57:17] by his words
[57:20] words more powerful than the
[57:25] there thorns people
[57:27] there they act like jira always look
[57:29] upon somebody you know oh he is not good
[57:32] he is not good what about you
[57:36] are you good
[57:38] my bible says no one is good
[57:43] sometimes we act like tortoise
[57:46] touch him it will go in
[57:49] you know have you ever tried to touch
[57:51] the tortoise it will take the head
[57:53] inside
[57:56] oh i have made my own boundary my own
[57:59] wall you won't come in i won't come to
[58:01] your home i won't come to your church
[58:03] you won't come to
[58:06] we have made boundaries we have made
[58:08] camps
[58:10] we don't want to mix with others
[58:14] we don't want to go into the other
[58:15] churches and tell them about this truth
[58:19] but the same prophet
[58:30] have you ever seen the ostrich
[58:33] it's always in the water forever
[58:35] depressed
[58:40] you know the snake
[58:44] what's that quality what's the lifestyle
[58:46] poison
[58:50] the snake has poison only in that teeth
[58:53] but you know where the poison is in us
[58:56] from head to toe
[59:02] the snake
[59:03] that serpent in genesis become a dragon
[59:06] in revelation
[59:11] that's why cardinal
[59:13] minds
[59:14] carnal believers are food for demons
[59:18] this obedience is the food for the enemy
[59:21] and i want to tell the children
[59:23] james are you listening
[59:26] you're playing with your watch
[59:30] disobedience is the food for the enemy
[59:36] and delayed disobedience
[59:39] is
[59:44] delayed disobedience ah delayed
[59:46] obedience is disobedient
[59:50] i did it dan no you didn't do it on time
[59:55] i did it mom i finished it what you said
[59:58] no you didn't finish it all the time
[1:00:02] you think it is obedience but it is not
[1:00:04] obedient it is
[1:00:06] disobedient it's a delayed disobedience
[1:00:12] my brothers my sisters
[1:00:15] we need to move on
[1:00:18] we must be witnesses
[1:00:20] acts 5 32 he says we are his witnesses
[1:00:23] of this thing and so is also the holy
[1:00:25] ghost whom god has given to them that
[1:00:27] obey him
[1:00:28] amen
[1:00:30] how many of you believe that the book of
[1:00:31] acts is still living again
[1:00:34] he's still
[1:00:36] you see the scripture you see the
[1:00:38] chapter wise all the books have got pull
[1:00:41] stuff but the book of acts does not have
[1:00:44] a full staff
[1:00:45] it's the act of the apostles
[1:00:48] it's the book of power it's the book of
[1:00:51] revelation it's the book of signs and
[1:00:53] wonders
[1:00:57] all the 65 books of the bible
[1:00:59] what it has got everything
[1:01:02] the book of acts has god
[1:01:05] because it's still going on
[1:01:10] it's still moving on in science
[1:01:13] and wonders
[1:01:15] dr luke says we believe it
[1:01:17] but we don't believe the bible
[1:01:19] the way we must believe
[1:01:24] luke wrote the book of acts that it is a
[1:01:25] legal language
[1:01:27] witness means we have seen it our
[1:01:29] testimony should have a report
[1:01:33] obedience is the key to open heaven
[1:01:35] disobedience is the food for devil obey
[1:01:38] the holy spirit and it will come into
[1:01:40] your life
[1:01:42] as i said you before falling is not
[1:01:44] important when you are in the fallen
[1:01:46] state get up
[1:01:48] when you get up obey jesus christ when
[1:01:51] you get up obey the lord when you get up
[1:01:54] over his word
[1:01:56] and a spiritual man obeys the wise of
[1:01:58] god
[1:02:00] and also the signs
[1:02:02] thank god for the sign
[1:02:05] of this end time and for the voice of
[1:02:07] this end time
[1:02:10] music is not a worship but a part of
[1:02:12] worship
[1:02:13] singing is not a worship but a part of
[1:02:15] worship giving is not a worship but a
[1:02:18] part of worship obeying the voice of god
[1:02:21] obedience to the word is the highest
[1:02:24] form of worship amen
[1:02:27] in this last days god is restoring the
[1:02:30] structure amen
[1:02:32] structure means the word of god
[1:02:35] word
[1:02:36] revival in the end time spoken word
[1:02:38] becomes the written word and the written
[1:02:40] word will become a living word and that
[1:02:42] has happened in this century
[1:02:47] the bible says the bible
[1:02:49] specifies ark of the covenant it was
[1:02:52] just a box
[1:02:54] for natural it was foolishness for
[1:02:56] spiritual for spiritually minded it was
[1:02:58] life eternal
[1:03:02] said and i if i be lifted up from the
[1:03:04] earth will draw all men
[1:03:06] unto me
[1:03:08] god is bringing that structure means the
[1:03:11] word of god you know
[1:03:13] david was bringing the ark means david
[1:03:15] was bringing the structure of the word
[1:03:18] of god
[1:03:19] david brought the ark on the bullock car
[1:03:22] actually the priest must carry it but
[1:03:24] they were bringing it on the bullet car
[1:03:26] structurally david was wrong it was to
[1:03:29] be carried by priests
[1:03:31] we all know what happened the ark of the
[1:03:34] covenant was left out the house of
[1:03:36] obedience
[1:03:40] i'd like to just give a statement when
[1:03:43] chosen ones become frozen ones
[1:03:47] when chosen ones becomes frozen ones
[1:03:51] god will fix the
[1:03:53] god will pick the forsaken ones
[1:03:58] forsaken ones are now overcomers
[1:04:02] what happened
[1:04:03] obed adam was a forsaken nobody cared
[1:04:06] for him
[1:04:07] but see
[1:04:09] god took
[1:04:10] him and now he's an overcomer now he's
[1:04:14] victorious
[1:04:15] one quality we need now is hungry for
[1:04:18] the word of god obedient was the first
[1:04:20] second one the first second one now
[1:04:22] become a chosen one
[1:04:24] when our comes to you that means when
[1:04:27] the word of god comes to you
[1:04:30] you not only become blessed but you are
[1:04:32] also becoming blessing to others
[1:04:36] not only you are blessed you become more
[1:04:38] generous
[1:04:40] the forsaken was honored by god
[1:04:44] oh when david saw the blessing
[1:04:48] the victory what obeyed adam god
[1:04:51] david planned to bring that ark in the
[1:04:54] right manner
[1:04:56] see we need to carry the word of god in
[1:05:00] our heart in our life in the right
[1:05:02] manner with the right attitude with the
[1:05:05] right motive
[1:05:08] if you don't do that
[1:05:11] you know the philistines thought sister
[1:05:13] that that ark of the covenant oh because
[1:05:16] wherever they were taking they were
[1:05:18] getting
[1:05:19] victory
[1:05:21] the philistine thought oh even we will
[1:05:23] get the victory
[1:05:25] they took the ark of the covenant i want
[1:05:27] to tell you
[1:05:28] you know what happened
[1:05:32] it destroyed them
[1:05:34] that's why the bible says christ for
[1:05:37] some is arising and for some he's the
[1:05:40] falling
[1:05:45] how do you take
[1:05:47] how you take
[1:05:49] the word of god
[1:05:52] with you
[1:05:53] with what attitude with what motive
[1:06:00] david now this time
[1:06:02] he took it in the right way
[1:06:05] who should carry the ark of the covenant
[1:06:08] the priest
[1:06:10] what was he doing he was dancing in the
[1:06:12] spirit not 34 not 64. brother mark it
[1:06:16] was 104. and when you are spiritual my
[1:06:19] brothers and sisters you won't listen to
[1:06:21] any criticism
[1:06:23] david did not pay attention to mikhail
[1:06:27] ark represented the presence of the king
[1:06:29] of kings
[1:06:31] i am that great i am was there
[1:06:34] david no longer he was a king but he
[1:06:37] became humble worshiped god with humble
[1:06:39] praises and i want to tell you when you
[1:06:41] come into the house of god don't look to
[1:06:44] the left or the right you need to
[1:06:46] worship god in spirit amen
[1:06:52] amen
[1:06:54] if you're standing like a statue that
[1:06:56] means you're dead
[1:06:58] you are alive but you are still dead
[1:07:02] paul said it is no longer i
[1:07:04] but christ in me he said i am dead
[1:07:08] i die daily but christ is living in me
[1:07:11] moses on the mountain
[1:07:13] on the mountain of god
[1:07:15] he said i s he surrendered in front of
[1:07:17] that burning bush
[1:07:19] my brother is my sister the prophet of
[1:07:21] god said you are a star
[1:07:25] your duty is to reflect the brilliancy
[1:07:27] of christ
[1:07:29] stars is giving the reflection of the
[1:07:31] sun moon is giving the reflection of the
[1:07:33] sun jesus is the light the son of god
[1:07:36] the son of righteousness
[1:07:39] what is the structure today it's the
[1:07:40] word of god nothing else
[1:07:43] fasting prayer whole night prayer you
[1:07:45] know potluck dinners
[1:07:48] all well
[1:07:49] get together all well but more important
[1:07:52] is fellowship with god's word
[1:07:55] for the word of god together important
[1:07:57] for building and foundation praise the
[1:07:59] lord
[1:08:01] buildings are important foundations are
[1:08:03] good
[1:08:05] but we need more of the word of god to
[1:08:07] build us spiritually amen god is raising
[1:08:10] a structure
[1:08:12] he's raising a generation of people who
[1:08:14] will not compromise
[1:08:16] don't compromise when it comes to
[1:08:18] glorify god
[1:08:20] don't compromise when it comes to
[1:08:21] worship god when you do it
[1:08:24] do it for the glory of god and the glory
[1:08:26] of god will manifest
[1:08:28] because of the structure what is the
[1:08:30] structure the word of god
[1:08:32] the foundation is the word of god which
[1:08:35] brings forth revelation
[1:08:38] god doesn't need people he needs
[1:08:40] obedience
[1:08:42] the obedient remnant
[1:08:44] noah
[1:08:45] everything he built was according to the
[1:08:47] plan of god build an ark of go forward
[1:08:50] build it according to god's structure
[1:08:52] god said noah you build it and i will
[1:08:54] feel it
[1:08:57] he's telling to the ministers and the
[1:08:59] ministries today build it according to
[1:09:01] god's structure plan
[1:09:04] you build it god will fill it
[1:09:07] noah did not invite anybody into the ark

[1:09:21] they all came
[1:09:23] he said no why you build it i will fill
[1:09:25] it
[1:09:28] and the lord is telling to every
[1:09:30] minister and the ministers today you
[1:09:32] build it
[1:09:35] and he said i will feel it
[1:09:38] what we need is
[1:09:40] neology no theology
[1:09:43] and that is what many ministers lack
[1:09:46] today

[1:11:36] to christ
[1:11:38] not by seeing at the white skin
[1:11:42] not seeing america
[1:11:44] he said i came to jesus christ
[1:11:47] because he saved me
[1:11:49] by his blood on the cross of calvary
[1:11:53] no almighty dollar but almighty god
[1:11:56] amen
[1:11:58] communion with him brings wealth health
[1:12:01] blessings communion every day means
[1:12:03] remembering him every day
[1:12:07] jesus is the superstar
[1:12:10] there's no star there's no superstar
[1:12:12] here we are only star
[1:12:15] but he is a superstar
[1:12:17] hallelujah
[1:12:19] later glory will be greater than the
[1:12:20] former glory the bible says
[1:12:23] come back to the structure
[1:12:25] what is that the word of god no

[1:12:45] it will kill you
[1:12:49] remove that tea out of diet
[1:12:51] and you will die
[1:12:53] so no conviction
[1:12:55] it will become a diet
[1:12:57] a formal church remove that tea you will
[1:13:00] die
[1:13:03] i will we must embrace the structure
[1:13:06] that is the word of god
[1:13:08] what is the structure
[1:13:11] one hour of prayer one hour of worship
[1:13:15] you know how many times a baby a little
[1:13:18] baby cries for milk every day
[1:13:20] do you know mothers
[1:13:24] do you know
[1:13:30] generally speaking seven times
[1:13:35] every day a baby will if she's really
[1:13:37] hungry she will cry for milk seven times
[1:13:42] we must crave for the milks of god's
[1:13:44] word
[1:13:45] like little babies
[1:13:47] that's why jewish people
[1:13:49] they pray for seven times the
[1:13:51] muhammadans
[1:13:53] they pray for five times
[1:13:56] how many times we pray every day
[1:14:03] i was coming in the flight it's a ramzan
[1:14:05] time you know ramadan you know
[1:14:09] i was seeing you know high officials
[1:14:12] top rich bureaucrats
[1:14:15] they did not care who was looking at
[1:14:17] them
[1:14:20] in the whole hour 21 hour of my journey
[1:14:22] i saw people those mummadans
[1:14:26] they were bending in on their knees
[1:14:29] touching their head onto the floor
[1:14:36] have you ever gone on our knees
[1:14:38] do you know how elijah prayed
[1:14:42] when that hand you know he saw that you
[1:14:45] know that mighty hand you know

[1:15:30] into supernatural
[1:15:35] how can we move
[1:15:38] into spiritual from natural
[1:15:43] no craving means something is wrong with
[1:15:46] the baby
[1:15:49] no craving no crying means something is
[1:15:51] wrong in the blood in the mind of the
[1:15:53] baby
[1:15:56] but there was a time in the life of the
[1:15:58] apostles in the in the book of acts
[1:16:01] 2 43 47 he says
[1:16:03] the fear came upon every soul and many
[1:16:06] wonders and signs were done by the
[1:16:08] apostles and all that believed were
[1:16:10] together and had all things common and
[1:16:13] sold their possessions and good and
[1:16:16] parted them to all men as every man had
[1:16:18] need and they're continuing daily one
[1:16:21] according the temple breaking bread from
[1:16:24] house to house did eat their meat with
[1:16:26] their gladness and singleness of heart

[1:16:31] the people and the lord added to the
[1:16:34] church daily

[1:16:48] fellowship

[1:17:38] lies amen
[1:17:44] we have this word
[1:17:45] this structure
[1:17:48] this is the most important structure
[1:17:51] that we need today
[1:17:54] if we need to move on
[1:17:57] into another
[1:17:58] realm
[1:18:00] we can't live in these four dimensions
[1:18:09] don't think of

[1:18:15] but we need to move forward
[1:18:19] our goal is that seventh dimension
