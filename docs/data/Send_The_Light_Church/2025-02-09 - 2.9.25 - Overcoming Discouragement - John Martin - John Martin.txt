Lord we know we need your help today and Lord we just commit ourselves and the scriptures now into your hands please bless them give us Revelation as we know that is the only thing that'll stand against the enemy we thank you now and praise you for these things in advance in Jesus Christ's name amen amen turn with me if you would to the Book of Joshua chapter one greetings to each and every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus so good to see our friend Lindsay with us here today um she was the one that I kind of inspired this a message today and um so if you enjoy it just let her know and if you don't enjoy it then just let me know and I'll make it right want to talk about overcoming discouragement today amen the Book of Joshua chapter 1 very familiar scriptures verses 1-9 let's read them together now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your fo foot shall tread upon that I have given you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness this Lebanon even into the Great River the river of frates all the land of the Hittites unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not be any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong be of good courage For unto this people shall thou divide for inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong very courageous that thou mayest observe to do Accord according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper whether soever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth uh but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do accordingly to all that is written there and there's the reason to read the Bible right there for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous Thou shalt have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and be of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever thou goest amen God bless you may be seated has anybody ever been discouraged before that should be an Anan anonimous Vault there when uh we are discouraged um the first thing that we're looking for is to be encouraged in simplicity um and there I'm sure there are times uh in our life that we've experienced a a major a problem in our physical body um maybe maybe like our pendex or um uh heart conditions um uh maybe even as as bad as a an ABS tooth that needs to be taken care of and these things can cause like a headache can cause pain can cause discomfort and you're and you're if you've been in pain for a long periods of time those of you that have back pains and things it you you just you begin to go crazy honestly um but when you're having um symptoms like this and you you just want to get rid of the the pain in your head and you go for the asper you just you just need some sort of relief uh but the root cause is still there and when it comes to discouragement yes we we want to be encouraged but it's better to get to the root cause because then you can have Victory um and you don't need to be encouraged if you get to the root cause I mean I won't need eventually if I take take care of the absess the pain in my face is going to be gone so I don't need to keep doing aspirin for 3 weeks or um baking soda or whatever just just just take care of the of the issue are you with me all right so we want to talk about the underlying issues there to try to help us down the road now here Joshua is being commissioned by God to go over and take possession of what God had promised their fathers which didn't get to go over simply because they had something in inside of them that would not allow them to go over the promised land which we can't have inside of us and that is simply unbelief and when they faced the Giants they were definitely giant problems it was discouraging to them but God tells them exactly the territory that belonged to them just like he tells us but the rulers they had they actually had to fight to take possession even though God gave it they had to take possession so God wants us to prosper and to be in health and to be happy and to be full of joy and to have this happiness inside of us but we literally it's not going to be given to us we have to take possession of it so it's going to require facing fears facing things it's going to require work it's going to require getting out of our comfort zone to take a hold of what God has already promised us now fighting these giant problems is going to bring bring uh bring us up if I could say it like this all of us to the temptation of discouragement because you know we're we're if we're driving to church and all of a sudden we got a flat tire you know that's going to be discouraging and so we've we've got to look at this flat tire situation and not get discouraged I know it's I'm just but I'm telling you you can take this message you can apply to anything in your life you still got to deal with the flat tire but you don't need to deal with it with discouragement we can't sit here and say well brother John you can't expect us you know to never be discouraged if we get a flat tire what I am telling you is you need to start looking at the flat tire in a way that's without discouragement so God commands them He commands them to be of good courage to be strong to not be afraid and to not be dismayed now this is the Commandment that he gives them and if we take this commandment into our heart when we're facing our situations it is impossible for discouragement to get in there because look Joshua and Caleb were part of the 12 Spies that went over over there but you know they all didn't come back with the same report they saw the same thing but they didn't view it the same way 10 of them VI like the problems that they were having were too too sermonic they were we were grasshoppers in their sight and and it was we we couldn't take the land they came back with a fear they were dismayed they were that means that that dismay it means more to be than discouraged it's a stronger sense of shock or surprise something unexpected and discouragement is a loss of confidence or courage think about that discouragement if you look it up is a loss of confidence or courage basically it's called bad courage so Joshua and Caleb they did have good courage they said we're more than able they didn't look at the problem they looked at the promise and the more of God we can get in our problems the more chance that we can overcome them and the more we try to handle the problems without God you know we're going to be just like those 10 spies scared out of our wits what to do I liked our first song that we sung today I'm Bound for the Promised Land amen now how do we remain strong enough in a state when we're facing our problems how do we stay strong enough when we're facing them how do we not get dismayed or afraid while we're dealing with real problems in life how do we learn to overcome when we come up to the temptation of getting discouraged because of what we're dealing with well God tells Joshua and I believe God is telling us today by meditating on God's word day and night and speak the word speak it don't turn to the left don't turn to the right but remain with what the Bible says amen we we're fighting demonic thoughts and the only thing that can overcome demonic thoughts is the word of God uh Mind Over Matter only works so long because the devil knows how to get to every element on the on on Earth with Humanity except he can't go through the word of God that's why the Bible says submit yourselves therefore unto God resist the devil and he'll flee from you we know courage and confidence are choices and the 12 Spies was a good example of that they're not based on anything courage and confidence is not based on anything discouragement is not based on anything in other words it's not true how many times have you looked at something got discouraged and it wasn't even true it's just an imagination it's something that the devil places in your mind to make it look the way he wants it to look to you like there's giants either you have confidence that you can water ski or you don't have confidence we don't even we don't even know yet we don't know if it's true or if it's an imagination either we have courage to get in the Water behind a boat grab onto the the handles and get up and go or you don't have confidence it's either or but you understand we the devil the way the devil presents to our mind is it's fact I don't I can't so we got to look at the root of discouragement it's something that the devil um makes a picture of in your mind so if courage and confidence are choices they are the way that we think about a situation it's the attitude that we choose about the problem that we're looking at amen so if they are choices then discouragement is also a choice I want to drive that home today discouragement is a choice but you know when the Devil comes to you he does not tell you it's a choice he says it's because of this because of this it's because of the Giants it because what they said how they treated me no discourage me is a choice in life we've heard the saying people can knock me down but they can't keep me down because it's a choice discouragement may be staring Us in the face but we can choose to say I'm not discouraged it's an attitude it's a view of how you're you're staring at the problem and it's it's not well I I think management should take care of this and the and and the husband the wife should take care of this and the teacher should take care of this and the neighbor should take care of this and Verizon should take care of this now your attitude needs to take care of it it needs to start with the right mental attitude will bring any Divine promise why do we need the Divine promises because it we need something to get us to where we want to amen and if the right mental attitude does it then we need to have the right mental attitude when we're staring at problems Proverbs 24:16 for a just man falleth seven times what he what does he do he riseth up again amen but the wicked shall fall into Mischief in other words he doesn't get back up he still dwells ing in this miserable problem so if we want to get up if we want our problem resolve we must first have an attitude in our mind that we're more than able to go through this because God is with me and greater is he that's in me than he that's in my problem there are things in this world that can discourage us but we always must remember that discouragement is nothing but a choice it's not our problems that discourage us but it's our attitude about the problems you know Satan is allowed to present a present a situation to us that looks like Gloom he's allowed to do that that's scripture but we don't have to sit there and say yeah I believe you if I choose to never be discouraged then I will never be discouraged no matter what the problem is job he kept his heart upon God now job's his friend well presented to job that maybe he had an issue a problem going on he was a secret sinner God has you know probably left you that's why you're going through the test that you're going through job's one wife well she said nothing seems to be going your way you might as well just Curse God and die job said you're speaking like a foolish woman job's wife definitely chose to be discouraged dismayed and bothered about the whole situation but job said though he slay me yet will I trust him amen I choose to trust God now if we can actually say that with all of our heart with our situation that we will not spend any time being discouraged looking at our problem because it's just a matter of attitude and if what job went to he could have the right attitude he went through so much more than we've ever gone through I I am Telling You discouragement is nothing but a painting that the devil gives us I'll say take it off the wall and get put it in the garbage don't let it hang in your wall don't let it hang in your in in your rooms and your car at work in your relationships just get the get the get the picture out put up Jesus Psalms 27:1 says the Lord is my light and my shield Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is my strength the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid now just think about all your situations I don't care if you're bothered by your your wife your husband your your job uh the the government the the the taxes that are due the bills the the car I I you must stand upon the Lord is the answer to the problem God does not want to share his glory with anyone he he wants to be the strength the light and the life of of of of of each and every one of us now when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and they fell though a whole should encamp against me I mean all my friends are against me they're not my friends anymore than my enemies though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear it's a choice am the war should even rise up against me in this will I be confident his confidence was in God Amen that God was really with him and I'll say it like this in order for God to be with us we can't sit around and do nothing right and expect God to be with us there's a reason we need to pray there's a reason we need to get into the word to meditate upon it day and night there is a reason that we should seek to be in the house of the Lord to get in the prayer rooms to listen to the tapes because there's a part that we need to pray why so that we have faith to believe in the realness of God in our lives it's not just saying well we know God is real no we know he's real here so when discouragement comes when the when the devil plants these thoughts that we can just I shall not be moved I'm not going to fear I'm staying with David I can write my own Psalms today that's why we need to spend time with God Thomas Edison said came face to face with discouragement but he chose to remain positive saying I have not failed I just found 10,000 we ways that the light bulb won't work but he it it took a lot of work now I think he also said uh opportunity lies uh all around us we just don't recognize it because it's camouflage it it's dressed in overalls and it looks like work and and if I could just say this that discouragement is there I mean he could have quit after a hundred times but he didn't he knew he had a vision it was a real vision and we need to have a vision we're more than able to take the land we're more than able to get in the image of Christ we're more than able to overcome these things to get delivered of these things to to to be victorious got to have that Vision Isaiah 12:2 says behold God is my salvation I will trust and not be afraid for the Lord Jehovah is my strength in my song he also has become my salvation therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of Salvation you got to count it joy that that you're actually laboring right you got to you got to labor you got to draw you got to dig in you got to press in you got to believe you got to get past all these doubt you got to say he is mine God Is Mine peace is mine love is mine I shall not be denied you can't sit there and say oh I deserve to have God just love me again without me loving him without me believing without me trusting in other words if God really wants me to have these promised lands he's going to have to take the Giants out himself God will not honor that he honors faith without Faith it's impossible to please him the reason we got problems is because God wants to see faith in our life wants to see it in manifestation not just I know God I believe God I I now that doesn't mean anything show me it manifest it David said My Help Cometh From The Lord our encouragement comes from the Lord our encouragement comes from the word of God amen Psalms 563 says what time I am afraid I will trust in thee what time is it what are you going through how bad is it you know what at that time I will trust the Lord in God I will praise His word in God I will praise the Bible because that is what gives us encouragement that's what gives us strength that is the only thing that could defeat the Devil in his imaginations is the word of God therefore I will praise the word of God Amen you know a lot of people want to get praise but they don't want to give it a wrong that's the spirit of the devil in God I will put my trust I will not fear what flesh can do unto me you ever been afraid of somebody come on be honest you ever been afraid the way they're acting the way they're they're behaving the way they come across the way they that's just the devil in a human being there nothing but the devil in a human being amen I'm so glad that the god that I know is not like that amen Charles Stanley said nobody else can make us discouraged it is a choice that we alone make when facing disappointments wow I didn't know that quote after I got into this he also went on to say disappointment is inevitable but to become discouraged there is a choice that I make God would never discourage me he would always point me to himself to trust him therefore my discouragement is from Satan as you go through your emotions that we have hostility is not from God bitterness is not from God unforgiveness is not from God these are all attacks from Satan you know a lot of people don't recognize the devil in their mind most of the time when we Face discouragement or become discouraged we don't even recognize the devil he makes us to get into a feeling of being trapped looking at the circumstances no way out what are we going to do I always like how brother Bill used to say it he says Satan will come and he said there's a fire in the room there's no way out and God God will say there's a fire in the room but there's the door God is always made a way of Escape but see the way Satan presents things is that there's no way of Escape they're like giants but I'm going to tell you what we need to get a relationship with God where we can hold to his unchanging hand we need more of the Holy Ghost in our life we need more of the realness of God it needs to can't be some religion something we just slap on our bodies when we go to church it needs to be something on the inside of the inside something that holds Us in the middle of a trial something that can take the test come buy of me gold try it in the fire that's what God's looking for in a Believer the devil knows how to discourage a man by simply dropping negative thoughts into his mind I say it's one of his favorite tools and if a person is not aware of the devil's devices they will often accept those thoughts and become affected then by them so discouragement truly isn't what happens to them around them it's what they accepted and how their attitude was towards it a spirit of discouragement is always lurking around always looking for opportunity no doubt it's never enjoyable being with Negative Nancy or negative Ned but the negativity will not affect you unless you allow it to now sometimes you may have to step away and go pray though none go with me though none want to have a good attitude I'll still have it I'm so glad it became a choice I'm so glad I didn't have to get 10 people around me that believe like I do I'm so glad that there was a Joshua and a Caleb against 1.8 million people and you know what he never changed his attitude you notice that for 45 years never changed his attitude he never allowed the people around him to discourage him he never said oh if it wasn't for you I'd be in the promised land right now he did not even have that attitude CU he knew all things work together for the good don't ever blame someone for your discouragements don't try to say someone else brought me down it's what soul and soul said to me it really bothered me if this or that wouldn't happen then I would this is the way they make me feel what are you doing what are you doing you're giving yourself over to somebody else look you're the vessel of God it's not to the devil because the devil will actually use other people to get to you but you know what though a host should Camp about me I'm not going to fear what they're going to say to me I'm not afraid because I know in whom I believe we got to stop giving the devil our mind if we have to depend on what other people think and say about us to feel good I'll tell you this we got low self-esteem you need to get into the altar get a hold of [Music] God the answer to discourage is not needing someone else to pick us up from negative thoughts but by taking responsibility of those thoughts in our own mind if I accept negativity why do I need to depend on somebody else to help me get those out it's not some song or joke or some emotional speech we need we don't need anyone to to make a choice in our mind we make that choice how many times have we heard something like there's you know there's like five people there or 10 or a certain amount of people and they're watching something and then they're all asked what did you see what did you see what did you see are you looking through a mind of positiveness or a mind of negativity are you looking through uh uh emotions that are not connected to the word or or you're looking through the emotions of what you want I mean here's the thing I'm sure Joshua and Caleb could have came back and said you know I these boys they got a point they got a point they are giants we've never faced this before this is a problem we've never faced before the problems that we faced before is that God took care of the Egyptians and that's my my faith can only go that far that God's got to just you know he's got to take care of the problem without me believing it you know I'm telling you there's more to the Walk of Christ than just justification friends more than just baptism we got to go in and take on the image of Christ we got to get in there and believe amen that's not happening then if I could just speak just a moment on the promise from from God for us for the I say it like this the promised land for us is a spiritual promised land and God has promised us just like he did in type to Joshua now our promise is that we've been predestinated to be in the image of Jesus Christ that is our Promised Land we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him the Bible says the whole creation of God is groaning and travailing and pain waiting for what the manifestation of the sons of God now this is our Promised Land perfect love 1 John 3:13 Marvel not my brethren if the world hate you we know that we have passed from Death unto life because we love the Brethren we're a we've gotten to the place that we're able to Love Like Jesus loves amen so this is the promised land now we've called the promised land or the Holy Ghost the promised land and it is but in part remember the prophet said the Holy Ghost is is our Josh today and Joshua took them into the promised land was not the promised land are you with me Joshua led the children of God into the promised land and the Holy Ghost is leading us into the image of God when he the spirit of Truth had come he will lead and guide you into all truth Amen Let us make man in our own image this is what's happening to the bride the bride is becoming into the image of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost leads us to the promised land who God is now it can get discouraging when the devil drops thoughts into our mind that we can't overcome that we'll never be ready in time for the Rapture that we'll really never ever get to a spot that we can love our enemies that we can't really become into the image of Christ and we can't stop doing the things that we're doing or that we can't develop the habits to do the right see these are thoughts from the devil I can't get over this I can't get past this these are discouraging thoughts but you don't accept those it's a choice remember it's a choice don't be a doubting Thomas I'm not going to believe until I can put my finger until this thing is gone from me I won't believe or I until I see until I see something more manifested in me I won't believe no you got to believe first you know God he believed first before the Earth was created he always believes first think about this we're all born sin shape and iniquity he has this Vision I have an expected end for you he believes for us all we need to do is believe in him that's all we going need to do is just believe in God I'll just say if we accept these kind of thoughts it'll get us discouraged it'll get us dismayed but I'm saying today don't accept those thoughts don't even accept them in other words recognize that this thinking or these thoughts are from the devil I like to say it like this it's devil thinking it's double thinking you ever you ever wonder what goes on in hell like really what goes on in there all you got to do I mean if you watch TV you'll know you you know all this stuff that is evil is getting worse and worse the Bible says but you know it all starts one place it starts in our head and I think we're we're we we are we're so gullible sometimes that we actually are involved in the devil thinking we need to recognize negative thoughts and negative thought patterns we need to learn to try the spirit to see whether it is of god or not amen because as that quote we read uh God is is not going to put discouraging thoughts in me that is not going to come from God that's going to come from the devil so therefore when we have the thought say it this is of the devil I'm not going to think it don't sit there and ponder it and say Well it it's not negative it's not bad it's it's not God it's not it's like this swissland to where I could just think about no it's not either you're thinking the thoughts of the devil or you're thinking the word of God am and the devil wants you to say well it's okay what you think it's not okay what you think because it will as much as much as you enjoy yelling at somebody throwing something across the room putting your fist up at somebody as you're driving by whatever it might be as as as fulfilling as it may be at that moment it will definitely bring you down so you can't go by how you're feeling at the time it's not eing the peaceful fruits of righteousness remember when you accept the devil thinking you're thinking like the devil so you don't have to wonder how the devil thinks you don't we've all been guilty of thinking like the devil we all been guilty of thinking like we're like grasshoppers compared to this problem that we're facing that we can't overcome these giant problems in our mind don't accept those thoughts they bring discouragement choose to reject those thoughts and that type of thinking remember always remember that we have a choice we have a choice about what we're going to think about and I'll say this I'll say this don't sit there and think about the things for a while and then make a decision you'll you'll get caught you'll get caught the devil knows what he's doing has anybody ever G fishing with a big sign says don't bite this hook no you want to hide the hook you want to show the bait you want to make it look certain ways you want the spinner going you want the smell there you want it moving through the the the pad the you want it to look appealing the devil wants his thoughts to look appealing to you yeah they they look like this what's harmless you can think about this I didn't say anything it's all on my mind huh oh my oh my that's that's exactly what he did to the 10 spies he the devil put in the mind of the 10 spies this very uh unpredictable no way to overcome situation but remember it was they said it's a land that flows with milk and honey it it's good grapes you know here they are let's it's true it's it's beautiful but also put along with that thought that we can't have it don't accept those thoughts don't entertain them the devil's going to present thoughts but we have a choice in our thoughts he's going to tell you you're doomed it's hopeless there's no answer you might as well give up in this situation you might as well just not even put your hard to go into church oh there's a good one there's a good one you can go but don't put your heart into it I'm going to say those thoughts those thoughts that there's no answer it's hopeless those are Thoughts From Hell you ever want to know what's going on in hell that's what's going on in hell yeah Thoughts From Hell we're in a battle and we must be willing to battle those thoughts in our mind and what it is it's the devil just be honest with you nobody wants to think that the devil isn't in them the devil may not be in your heart but he's definitely in your head and wants to get in there wants to get in the boxing arena with you come on let's go at it CU he's been there he's he's who's ever who whatever thought is going on in your head I'm telling you he's fought it with many millions of other humans before he ever got to you he knows how to battle you but God has allowed the devil free will to place thoughts in your mind I want you to remember that as much as we don't want to think them God has allowed the devil yep you just you go put any thought you want in in my children's in my priz you just go ahead he doesn't stop it and it is our responsibility to cast those same thoughts out that the devil has given us so God has allowed the devil to put the thoughts there and God has said to his bride you cast them out and the bride will because that's the only way she overcomes all things 1 Peter chapter 5:8 1 Peter chap 5:8 be sober be vigilant this is how our mind needs to be now because your adversary the devil as a roing lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour sinner Saint a clean heart not a clean heart having a good day having a bad day it don't matter the devil is walking around seeking may may devour what is the answer be sober be vigilant because not every thought that comes in your head is of God every thought that you're thinking is not right it's about time we accept that and you know what it takes to accept that truly truly humility humility that's why God dwells with the humble why he resists the proud because the proud is always right he's right in his own eyes is he thinks he's right verse n what's the answer whom resist steadfast in the word of God in the faith in the word knowing that the same things that you're going through are the same things that are going through in your brethren that are around the world in other words the devil wants you to feel isolated nobody has got it like you got it I will say this for assurity God has never put anything on anybody that they couldn't bear because God is faithful he won't do that amen and any good parent would never put something on their children that they couldn't handle but now in order for you to resist the devil you got to recognize him if you're going to sit there and allow that thought to be in your head yeah yeah they said this they yeah they they did this to me yeah they stabbed me they did this you're allowing all those thoughts then you're going to walk around I don't know how to handle this because you got the devil inside I mean as soon as you recognize it get it out resist it it's learning how to defeat the Devil with the word of God we're all in this battle together every single person that you know of you think about the people in the world they don't even know the devil's speaking to them and they're actually doing the things of the devil living like the world beating people up and say they deserved it because they said that to me right going drinking shooting up I'm doing this because you know my husband or my wife they did that listening to the devil and they're blaming it on somebody else in other words they don't recognize the devil they just recognize the person but you know we don't fight against flesh and blood Ephesians verse chapter 6 verse 10 Ephesians 6 ver10 if you want to write it down finally my brethren be strong in the Lord be strong in the Bible be strong in the word not your not just your thoughts that but strong there's a difference between you know I I I look at my stomach I looked at my stomach couple of times and I think wouldn't it wouldn't it be good to exercise a little bit John but I'm going to be honest with you they weren't strong thoughts because I haven't done it yet be strong in the Lord and the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood think about all the problems that we have guaranteed you can identify a person to that problem I don't care if it's Mom dad kids neighbors I don't care whatever your problem there's the person and and and if it's not if it's just a flat tire eventually you become that person the devil knows how to camouflage for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities think about this people are fighting against principalities the powers and the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places right here this is is where we're wrestling people don't even know they're in a battle so what's the answer Paul what's the answer he tells the Ephesian church that the most Spiritual Church wherefore take upon you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day right and having done all to stand I just wonder you know a lot of times we the way we think we don't recognize we just we just allow oursel to think these things and then we wonder why we get down and discouraged and bothered it's because you didn't put the armor on quick you didn't discern quick enough that was from the devil that thought you want to get in and watch the whole movie right you want to think the whole thing through you want to you want to understand from this direction and that because he presents it in an exciting way because he's presenting it in a finger pointing and if I can finger point enough I'll be able to say you see it's their fault I'm discouraged because of them therefore I don't feel I need to try anymore God understands my situation God understands you won't make it into a Promised Land you need to change your attitude look I don't want you to get upset at me I want you to get upset at the Devil he's the one lying to you not me I'm on your side he does the same thing to me why we need to pray one for another amen God commanded Joshua the only answer there was to overcome Satan's discouraging thoughts was to keep God's promise inside of him keep it in front of you keep it in your head keep it in your thoughts keep it in your mind keep it in your heart and speak it out we sing it I I will not be denied that's what you need to tell the devil when he lies to you we're more than able to take the land God is greater inside of me this is the battle that's happening don't look to the other person to change their thought let's say you got a you have a problem with a family member and this family member is just being a little bit out of whack you know what I mean by that I don't need to go any further you know what I'm saying about that instead of putting your energy to change this person's out of wackness into a better whack look to the word of God because there's an answer in the word of God how to handle that problem amen well brother John I don't know I I don't know I I you nobody told me I my mom and dad never told me I don't know how to do that how much time have you had to get in the word and read it but you refus to do it and then you come to church and you want to be picked up at church when you won't take time at home to get a hold of God I'm telling you there's going to be a Rapture it's going to happen we're either going to be ready or we're not going to be ready and there'll be nobody's nobody's responsibility but our own get into the word there's an answer sometimes it's a soft answer and sometimes you warn them that are unruly you got to have the answer for the situation this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt make shall thou shal have good success a lot of people don't read the Bible because it's it's not it's not entertaining enough not enjoyable and some people read it because they want to get more knowledge and both of those are wrong you you you read it so you can live it so you can know how to live for God so you can know how to please him well I already know that well then you know what just called God a doo bird he don't know what he's telling you I don't know what to tell you you need to change your attitude if the word says it then just do it don't say you already know because if you already know you'd already live it that's it if you already know you would already live it because some that says they know something but they don't live it is speaking from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it's not the tree of life and he said he build his church upon the Revelation which comes from the Tree of Life the only way to overcome the thoughts of the devil is by submitting to the word of God can you say Amen James 4:7 James 4:7 yes we're going to have to hurry and now in my thoughts that just be honest with you I thought we were going to be done early and here it is going to be late again submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he'll flee from you don't try to beat up the Devil Without God draw nigh to God draw nigh to him spend time praying loving submitting reading his word listening to the tapes draw nigh to God you know what's going to happen after you do that he's going to draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you Sinners creating me a clean heart right and purify your hearts what you double-minded in other words you allow your mind to think think thoughts from the devil that come from hell and then you allow yourself to think good thoughts you can't do that you can't say well I I I I believe in God over here and then over here you're thinking like the devil get rid of it knock this thing off get serious with God how many want healing not just for your body but a Brokenness your spirit your mind your emotions I just want to say this if you want healing if you want to be healed it must you must start with healing your thoughts and this is where you have control there is no other doctor here this is you this is you saying I will submit my mind to the word of God if you want healing inside your spirit your emotions and those the inner part of your being you got to control your thoughts change what you're thinking about the Bible says he as a man think so is he so if you're thinking you're broken you're broken and one of the hardest things to do is convince somebody that they've been set free when they've been bound so long it's a true statement now if you never been bound what's easy to say I'm free and being bound for you know look I haven't smoked cigarettes in whatever 40 years 50 more than that I spend a long time anyways tried it a couple of times because that's what my brother did and I want to be cool he was older than me one I want to be accepted it's so now every time I feel it have you ever smoked I gota go oh back way back there are you a smoker have you ever smoked look if if you're smoking the Deliverance is much harder because you've been bound so long than just once or twice there God you got to start with your thinking that these things are not for me this drinking is not for me this swearing is not for me this pornography is not for me I got to start in my mind this is not for me this is not of God this is not in the word I'm changing my thoughts get serious with the word of God because if you heal your thoughts you will heal your life too many people you know give me this pills give give me some counseling give me this give me that and I'll be fine that's TR no it ain't when it comes to the devil you got to get involved with your self-will right aspirin aren't going to take care of that blessed are they who see God's promise in a middle of a terrible problem can you say Amen blessed are they who see beautiful things in Humble places where others see nothing Mary condo said discard everything that does not spark Joy discard everything that doesn't spark Joy you know here God gave the promised land to the children of Israel you just got to go now possess it and 10 spies have this thought we can't do it but they did not disregard that thought it didn't spark joy and they didn't disregard it now I am sure Joshua and Caleb saw the same Giants right but that thought didn't spark joy and so they disregarded it you understand what I'm trying to say you've got to you've got to heal your thoughts if you want to you want to have more joy in your life you got to get rid of every other thought that doesn't spark the joy Apostle Paul told the Corinthian Church in 2 Corinthians 10:3 we're just please bear with me now now we're almost done for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare they're not carnal but they're Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds now that's what happens when we're discouraged it's a stronghold it can be a stronghold it's one thing to get as discouraging thought it's one thing to be in to be set in a in a set mind of discouragement discouraging thoughts is the root and cause of discouragement so if you don't accept the thoughts of discour discouraging thoughts you won't get discouraged so you literally have to work for it you have to resist the devil you have to submit to the truth work there's that work there and it's an inner work not an outer work an inner work God working on the inside amen casting down imaginations cast them down you got to call it out this is not the truth this is absolutely a lie look what job had to go through he had to do a lot longer than we did and I'm telling you he had so many other all so many other things to prove to him that it wasn't an imagination his kids kept dying things kept burning up look at Jonah they that uh observe lying vanities forsake their own mercies you you you got to just cast it down call it out look at it it's of God not of God make the decision and then go with it don't sit there and allow it to be there until it's gone don't do that you're a Believer cast down imagination every thought and every High thing that exalteth itself against the word of God and bring it into captivity what what we what into captivity every thought to The Obedience of the word of God now look if we're willing to do that we're going to be a happier people Joy is g to come in sadness is going to get out because the devil he does not bring good thoughts he's a Salesman now right he'll say you just drink this vodka you're gonna have a good time yeah he can do that but he's not telling you the whole story so he he he's a Salesman it may look like it's good but it's not and having a Readiness this is that be sober be vigilant having a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when when when is this going to happen when you fulfill what you're supposed to do when you're your personal obedience is fulfilled all right two more scriptures Philippians 4:7 that were quitting no no we're quitting we're never going to quit but we'll be finished with today's service and the peace of God Philippians 4:7 and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts right and your minds through Christ Jesus finally Brethren whatsoever things are true now it can't just pass one of the test here it's got to pass them all whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise then think on these things so you know I'm going to be honest with you I don't think there's anything on TV that matches this I think God gave Joshua the answer which is the word of God meditate upon it day and night amen get more of the word inside of you those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you right you know there's a lot of people that want peace and all they got to do is truly give their mind to the Lord right give their mind to the Lord they say oh I gave my heart to God why don't I got peace give your mind to the Lord Isaiah 26:31 with this Thou shalt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee you can't just say God's in your heart and then you don't keep God in your mind you're not really trusting in God then this is the answer to help us not to be discouraged let's Stand Together discouragement is a wrong choice that we make in our mind when we Face discouraging situations choose to build yourself up in the Most Holy Faith keep reminding yourself of the promises of God hold on to your beginning confidence steadfast to the end stay in the word however much time you're s spending in the word I want you to make a commitment today I'm going to spend a

to play that softly if we could just bow our hearts and our heads maybe close our eyes for just a moment thinking on this very thought that the only real peace that we could ever have that would be

our hearts as we receive this joy in our hearts Lord we're literally manifesting what the Holy Ghost is God we give you ourselves we give you ourselves and now may there not be a doubt in any one of
