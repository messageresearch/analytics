bewhere I'll bewhere [Music] praise the Lord there I don't think there could have been a better uh better song to to end uh the worship and to bring in the message this morning because we want to talk about a guide and being led by the Lord amen so I just want to welcome everyone here this morning especially our our guests Olga and Gary God bless both of you thank you for the courage to come by a new church and not know what you're going to uh see there but may the Lord uh bless you is our prayer and we just hope that something would be said for each one of us to help us along the way amen turn with me if you would in your Bibles to the book of St John it's good to see the Welsley family back amen it's been trying times amen how many's always praying for the Wesley family amen I want them to be en encouraged to know that the body is praying for them because it's easy to feel alone yeah very easy and the devil tells you that you got to fight fight that amen before we begin reading in here let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer our heavenly father we we want to thank you for your presence this morning we want to thank you for coming into this building inside of your children today Lord and we want to thank you for the atmosphere that's been created through Worship in which you said that you do inhabit the Praises of your people amen now Lord we pray that you'd come and and magnify your word inside of our hearts May It Be what we have need of to help us in our journey Lord please break the bread of life to us and help us Lord as we look into that we just pray for Revelation now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen St John chapter 14 starting with verse number five and concluding with six Thomas saith unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way and Jesus said unto him I I am the way that's right I'm the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me amen amen then just turn the page to chapter 16 we're going to read one verse there verse number 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he will he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come amen amen God bless you may be seated how many enjoyed the uh last service with brother Godwin Andrews I mean it was such a wonderful service and he knows he knows the scriptures uh I I need to write them down I just be honest with you that's why I have a lot of notes uh especially as I get older I heard uh uh uh Tim Hawkins say that uh he had a he's a a comedian a Christian comedian um and I don't know if you know those two words can go together but at this moment I'm putting them together and uh well after he had done one of his um shows uh afterwards they wanted him to go in the back and into a room and they were going to he was they wanted him to give autographs you know to the people who wanted to to see him and so he said okay so he's sitting there there's a pen and there was like a 100 people that came through and wanted his autograph and the first um person came through was an older lady and says could you just do me a favor could you write down your favorite scripture for me right underneath your your name and uh uh yeah sure yeah I'll do that so he his favorite scripture is Psalms 348 oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him but at that moment he just he just kind of forgot the scripture he just got like a brain fog so he's just he just well all the scripture is good so he just throws out a Psalm Psalms Psalms 387 and so with all 100 people he signs his name and put Psalms 387 under every one of them so after the end when he's done he's Lord I just sure let that be a good one let that be a good one so he read it and this is what it is for my loins are filled with lome disease with a loome disease and there's no soundness in my flesh so you can imagine all 100 people are now looking this up and saying this is his favorite scripture we need to pray for him so I I I just I don't want to take any chances I just want to write down the scriptures make sure I got the right one life is filled with a lot of twists and turns things happen all around us things happen to us from other people but there's nothing that's more important than what happens inside of us amen and so for a subject this morning we want to look at God leading us to the character a a character relationship with him now we we all know God to some measure amen but God has greater sights in mind than just leading us partway so we want to entitle this message our guide a guide is someone who who shows us around we've all been probably on some sort of tour guide and usually that guide is is telling us about the area that we're we're visiting maybe we're sightseeing learning about the history of some Town notice they've been trained they've been trained to to to to tell you about the area and and and you learn about things we could say that they've been there done that and a guide is someone that you can have confidence in now if you're going uh hunting in uh an area that you've never been before and it's it's filled with uh grizzly bears and and uh uh wild animals you you and and and snow can come anytime you you really want to have a guide with you amen there's been people that have died in the wilderness all because they did not have a guide they thought they could make it something happened something difficult happened maybe it got night the snow but there's many stories on people getting killed all because they did not have a guide to lead him through so a guide is someone who keeps you from getting lost he keeps you from getting into danger he's someone that advises and directs you in the right way to go am God even placed a North star in the sky to help us to know what true north is amen and a guide to help direct man in his travels God has placed an unmovable and unshakeable word for us to point us to True heaven and a living word which we want to get into the Holy Ghost is the Living Word to guide us to that relationship Amen brother Bram s in the message a guide he said that's the trouble with Christians today they wait till the darkness settles over them then they find out that they've they've been left without the guide we need a guide amen God has always had a guide for his people remember in the Old Testament when God would lead the children of Israel in the wilderness he he led them by Night by a a cloud uh a pillar of fire in the in in the day by a cloud and that was that was Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit leading them every single day but there's wrong guides there's there's wrong guides out there there are people there are churches if I could say it like this who think they're guiding but they're really blind they don't fully know what they're doing Abraham Lincoln was trying to bring a truth across uh and he was being rebutted and the questionnaire asked him or he asked the he asked the questionnaire because he was trying to bring a point of TR truth across and he said how many legs does a a calf have and he said four and uh Abraham said well what if his his what if we were to make his tail a leg then how many legs would he have and and the man said well well five and and Abraham Lincoln said it doesn't matter what we would call uh a leg a leg is on the truth is he only has four legs no matter what we would think amen and the and the point is there's many people who want to make truth a certain thing but truth is truth and that's all there is to it we we we we can imagine and wish God would do this and allow this and this would be okay but truth is truth it stands on its own Matthew chapter 23 verse 23 Jesus speaking here and he says' woe unto you scribes and Pharisees I'll call you hypocrites for you pay tithes of mint and Anis and uh common and have omitted the weightier matters of the word of God right judgment mercy and faith and look what he says here these ought you have these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other done so he's saying you he he's saying you you don't you shouldn't just not do the little things the little things are important don't leave those undone but don't leave out the most important things the weightier things amen and then he says in verse 24 he says you're blind guides you strand at a knat and swallow a camel you ever strain something with cheesecloth right you're trying to keep certain things to get out and they would they would strain the little gats but then they would open their mouth and put a camel in it the obvious thing the weigher matters amen there's war unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you make clean the outside of the cup or and the and of the platter but within they are full of exorts and excess Thou blind Pharisees cleanse first the that which was within the cup and the platter that the outside uh of them may be clean as well in other words even though you clean up the outside you're not clean outside not the sight of God you have to clean the inside first and then the outside is clean Matthew 15:14 says let them alone let these these blind leaders these Hypocrites alone they be blind leaders of the blind in other words if you truly are searching for truth you're not going to stay in a church that's preaching half of it because the other path is Blindness he says just let them alone be they be blind leaders of the Blind and if the blind are leading the blind then both both shall fall in the ditch amen I don't want somebody leading me into a ditch I want somebody helping me get out so we want to watch who we're following we want to pay attention to who we're listening to we want to be careful to what ADV device that we're taking the spirit of air will always lead you into all the truth if I could say this the spirit of Truth um I'm not sure did I say that right thank you something just like not clicking there the spirit of air will always lead you away from part of the truth that's the statement I want to make see it's okay if you have some of the truth the devil don't mind that but he's always on working at getting you a little bit away from the truth where the spirit of God is always trying to lead you closer to the truth because the motive of God is to get you into all the truth am and and and the motive of the devil is to get you completely away from it but he can't just do that to you so he gives a little bit at a time the spirit of air will lead you to compromise with the word right it will lead you to settle for something less than what you already know to be the whole truth the spirit of Heir helps us to make excuses why we compromise with the word of God how many has how many has heard this this voice speak to you amen well I I'll raise my hand he's alive the the devil is doing his dirty work amen turn with me if you would to St John or first John I'm sorry 1 John chapter 4 I want to read some verses here uh trying we want to discern when when when there's so many voices right so so many thoughts that come into our head and we we got to we've got to be active in Discerning not just thinking that I always think good thoughts that only good thoughts that everything I think is right you can't be thinking that because God has allowed the enemy to speak to us and and it's our job to discern all right 1 John 4 ver1 says beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirit where they are of God because many false prophets are gone out to the world so there's only two Spirits there's the spirit of God the spirit of the devil which would just call this the spirit of air for a second because we don't have to when we look at the Devil we look at we think of something that's just um solid black right right just nothing good but remember he's the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so he he has he can appear as angels of light he can he he has enough truth to get your attention and says this is the way to go but really he won't Lead You In the right way verse two hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is the spirit of antichrist which you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world every spirit that manifest Jesus Christ in your flesh is of God because he's the same yesterday today forever but every spirit that doesn't manifest it just speaks it it just wants to to to to have a show as it were to talk about it but it doesn't manifest it we're told to get away from that it's a spirit of error in other words a form of godliness but denying the power to manifest the word we're told to get away from that spirit because it will lead you away from Christ God wants to manifest himself in each of us do you believe that amen verse four ye are of God little children and have overcome them those those Spirits those those wrong uh uh uh false prophet those wrong Spirits because greater is he that's in you that's down deep inside you than he that's in the world now remember when you were in the world I'll remember when I was in the world I did not want to do anything that I didn't want to do basically anything that was against my will it became my enemy I wanted to do my will do my own thing and I I I felt uh the world was was was okay because it was a place that I could do what I wanted to do whereas you know when I was in my home I had to do what my dad said and you know I want to be free from that I want to get a car I want to feel the freedom so you you come to Christ and you learn that there's these spirits that are in the world and I just want to drop it down now the worldly nature that we were born with right so that's what we've got to overcome is that worldly nature and verse five says they are of the world therefore they speak therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of God and he that knoweth God heareth us and he that is not of God heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of air how important it is to be of God right because truth is important to you I'll just say if you belong to God truth is important to you the spirit of Truth is important to you I mean there was a time in my life that I didn't know God and Truth wasn't that important to me but once I learned that Jes Jesus is the truth he is the way he is the life then it became important to me so we've heard if a trumpet gives an uncertain sound how are we going to know to prepare for battle so the the word is truth and if we don't preach the word if we don't love the word we don't come become one with the word then you know we're going to end up being bombarded by the devil now did you ever notice when geese they're flying up in the sky they're always flying in a V formation and you notice that the geese they're not fighting over one another who's the leader right and they can all just you know come down in a in a big lake or a pond and I'll tell you when it's time to go uh uh e even if another flock will come uh when that when that uh the leader of of those geese when he starts cracking he starts giving his noise like a you know like geese do if there's anybody that knows how to do a geese sound right now would be real good to say it uh you know he'll start doing that they'll all start getting ready and all of a sudden he'll take off and all of them take off they don't say no we're not going right and I'll tell you we the children of God are led by the spirit of God and when God is leading in we just follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit there's no I got to think about it and I got to you know make sure it works out with me and if it doesn't then no we just work in the formation of the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen because we need that for our lives amen anything short of it will miss it I want to make a statement here and I want to try to try to back it up try to prove it by the scriptures God has set back the holy spirit to guide us into a perfect relationship with him you can't just read that verse but that is the truth and the reason I want to bring that out is because I want us to focus you know because often we'll say well I've got the Holy Ghost and then we'll forget about a relationship right amen but the purpose of the Holy Ghost is to lead us back to a perfect relationship with him and I'm saying perfect I mean complete and so what does God want hopefully we'll have time to get through it but I'll say like this God wants preeminence in our life amen Nicodemus came to Jesus by night and he said uh we know that thou are a teacher come from God no man can do the things that thou doest except God uh he be of God right now even though Nicodemus Jesus said he was a master of Israel he still needed a guide to the new birth and every single person that's born in this world that if they're going to make it the heaven they've got to be borned again because those are the words of Jesus Christ and I'll say it like this we need a guide to be born again we just can't make it on our own and think we got it all figured out that's what the Holy Ghost is for is to guide us to a perfect relationship a complete birth a complete birth there's a lot of people who partially get born again that's and they say they got the new birth but it's not all the way because if it was all the way they would never go back brother Orlando right they would never go back amen and that's why it's important to make sure we get all the holy ghost that God has for us a lot of people think that since Jesus died at Calvary for their sins and they repented and and they got baptized that um they're going to go to heaven so what would be the need of pursuing more Holy Ghost it's like two different subjects to them are you with me amen the Bible tells us 1 Corinthians 12:12 if you want to write it down by one Spirit are we all baptized into the body of Jesus Christ amen we need to be baptized with the Holy Ghost amen right I'll say like this we need to stay baptized with the Holy Ghost we need to keep we need to keep the oil flowing amen there's more to Heaven than what Jesus has done for you there's more to Heaven than just what Jesus done for you what is there more it's about about what you've done for Jesus in other words if it was just what Jesus done then everybody would be saved but see up there there is a love relationship because the only way you can get there is through love you have to love God more than yourself or you're not going amen that's just all because you got to deny yourself you got to pick up your cross you got to follow him so up in heaven there's going to be a bunch of people who have a love relationship with God they they care about they care about God they care about his word they care about his will and and that's what's going to be filled in heaven is as people who care about God more than they care about themselves God is always wanted to be with someone who unconditionally loves them see there's a lot of people say you know I love God I mean I love John 3:16 I I love that he supplies I love that he's a comforter I love that he heals me I love but what about I love to obey him I love to trust him in my trials amen I love to hold to God's unchanging hand what about that love God is always wanted to have a relationship with someone who would love him unconditionally who loves his word and just respects the word and respects his will that's what God wants to be back and the Holy Spirit God sent back the Holy Spirit to lead us to that place that place of relationship Bible says we've been predestinated to be in the image of God so I want to say this believers who never fall in love with the Bible never become established with God I know it's a strong statement but I'll just I'll back it up in 2 Chronicles 20:20 believe on the Lord so shall you be established you've got the you've got to fall in love with the word because see the look The Devil is not trying to get you where you're strong at he's coming at your weaknesses he's he's trying to trip you up if you're faithful coming to church well then he's going to try to get you somewhere else maybe you're flying off the handle when you get upset you understand he's going to try to zap the victory right out of you but he's going to he's going to he's going to come after your weaknesses so we must become one with the word the the word needs to become the headship of our life we need to love the Bible amen love the Bible I'm okay I like that there a good ring to that I love the Bible I love the word of God the holy spirit is the Living Word of God there's no difference there's no difference between the Holy Spirit and the Bible one is written form the other is manifested it's invisible but when it comes and lives inside you it manifests it isn't that beautiful amen I just love that turn with me if you would to St John 13 I want to try to get into this love relationship here a little bit and show you so uh in St John 13 Jesus is telling his disciples that he's he's leaving it's time for me to leave and and they're getting sad and and in verse 33 he says little children yet a little while I'm with you you shall seek me and and as I said unto the Jews whether I go you cannot come so now I'm saying it personally to you so I'm leaving now this thing I want you to do while I'm gone a new commandment I give you that that you love one another as I have loved you that you Lo uh I'm sorry that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another so you got to keep this love going while away and and by this shall all men that you know will know that you're my disciples that if you have love one for another so if you want somebody to know you belong to Christ you have to learn to love them unconditionally amen amen this all there is to it unconditionally anybody has favorites anybody say I love them because they love me but we're really looking for the person who loves everybody those that have something against them because that's the one that God you'll see the manifestation of God the most in amen it is because the hardest thing is to love your enemy I don't just well you know I I love them but you know I just I can't I don't I don't feel like talking with them you I just feel uncomfortable no true love of God is you want to help that person you want Lord if I could just get with them I know I can make a difference in their life it's a faith now I'm not saying you're prophesying that you will but it's a faith that you have love Faith That worketh by love I think the scripture says all right let's continue reading here uh verse 36 Simon Peter said unto himl where are you going where goest thou and Jesus answered where I go thou cannot follow me now but Thou shalt follow me afterwards and Peter said unto him Lord why can't I follow you right now I am ready to lay down my life for your sake and Jesus answered him will thou lay down thy life for my sake verily I say unto you uh unto thee the the shall not crawl till thou has denied me three times so here's here's someone and we have all probably felt that you know we won't deny the Lord right but I tell you the only thing that will not deny God is God right that's why we need to get filled with God because then we won't deny him but we're flesh eventually we're going to cross the word are you with me amen all right verse one chapter 14 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God then believe also on me Jesus said in my father's Kingdom House my father's kingdom are many residents many mansions if it were not so I would have told you so I go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also so this place that Jesus is talking about is is is not what we would think like just a place like like like our church is a place that's in Fenton it's not like that that's right alone it's not like that alone but rather it's a place of a relationship amen not a GE graphic place but the place that he's talking about that he's going to prepare it's it's it's it's a relationship one of love one of his character it's the Bible Jesus said it's a place where Christ receives you it's a place where you and Christ are now together so see it's not a geographic place it's a place of relationship he's talking about I'll say that this place is is what we would call the spiritual Promised Land that's right now there's no it's no different than the natural Promised Land given to the children of Israel I'll just say it like this God had given the land but it wasn't prepared for dwelling yet right it was filled with giants you just couldn't go there put your lawn chair out and live in some peace and in the comfort it had to be prepared before you got the lawn chairs out amen and it is no different for the Christian when we come into this world we are not fit for God's holy spirit we were aliens with God we were separated from God our nature didn't even care about God to be honest we were born in sin shap and in iniquity and the land is not prepared that the nature of our of our our being is not prepared for God so he's he has to prepare that place amen now just as the the children of Israel had to have faith that God gave him the land and just trust him keep walking keep moving forward God did the work if you noticed right because you know they couldn't beat the Giants on their own sir they were like grasshoppers but they believed in the God that was greater than their obstacles and we've got to believe in a God that's greater than our nature that we are truly Overcomers that we can be like Jesus Christ we can have a relationship in this evil hour that we're living in so close to God that we can make a Rapture amen I believe it with all my heart this is the place that Christ is going to prepare in each one of us he's working inside of us with the Holy Spirit the Bible tells us that we are God's workmanship created in Christ Jesus for it is God which worketh in US to both will and to do of his good pleasure so he's given us Faith to overcome we just got to learn to trust we got to learn to obey we got to learn to like if I could say it like do all things without murmuring and complaining don't Grumble just do what the Bible says love the word don't just well I don't feel like do it I ain't got time and you know this you know I'll just this is on a back burning don't do that that's what you're saying about your relationship with Jesus Christ but you don't realize it see the devil is trying to get you to say trying to get you to think that your relationship is solid with him no matter what you do no matter what choices you make out there no matter how you you live how much time you give him no matter where your heart is at everything's okay between you and God is that the truth so we need to be cautious we need to be aware of these Spirits amen let's continue reading here and Jesus said whether I go you know not St John 14 ver4 and the way uh and where I go you know I'm sorry and whether I go you know if I just read the word I would not make any mistakes you know I just need to become a better reader and Thomas saith unto him Lord just like just like Peter we really we don't know where you're going and how can we know the way if we don't know where you're going and Jesus said unto him I I am the way I am the truth and I am the life and no man cometh to the father but by me amen Jesus is the way to heaven he is the way to the father and if I could say it like this he is the way to the spirit we know God is a spirit that's what the Bible says God is a spirit they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth amen and Jesus said I came from the father and I go back to the father I came from the locus the spirit and I'm going back there am now he says it's expedient if I go away if I do not go away the comforter will not come why is that because the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in Jesus Christ the fullness of God's spirit amen God great is the mystery of Godly is God was manifested in the flesh it was God in Jesus Christ God's desire is to inhabit our bodies just like he did Jesus Christ the body of Jesus Christ amen and I'll tell you Jesus Paid the price for our sins and he made an opportunity for for each of us to receive as much of the Holy Ghost as we want I want to say it like that you want more there's more for you you if there's a deep calling there's a deep to the respond if you're satisfied with what you have that's it I that's it that's all you're going to get but God is interested in filling your filling you up from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head from one end to the other front and back why because he just wants to manifest himself in you he loves you and he wants Your Vessel it's a love relationship Jesus encompasses all life all truth and he is the only way to get there he said I am the bread of life that come down from heaven and unless you eat it you have no life in you right he said the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life Jesus is the truth he is the word of God he is the Bible and we're going to catch in a minute Jesus said the Holy Ghost was the spirit of Truth well we just read Jesus said he said I am the truth and then the Bible ALS Jesus also said this that that the Holy Ghost was the spirit of Truth so which one is it it's the same it's the same they're one that's when you receive the Holy Ghost you receive God you got deity in you amen that's why you can say to this mountain be moved that's why you can cast out demons why you can have power over your nature because God is inside you the Creator amen verse seven if he had known me you should have known my father also and henceforth you know him and have seen him and Phillip not quite being in the spirit I I would be too right at that point without the Holy Ghost Philip saith unto him show us the father and it suffices and Jesus sayith on him have I been so long with you and you have not known me Phillip come on I want to answer we've been spending time you've been coming to church you've been hearing the word you've been in the message you don't know yet what this means he that have seen me have seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believest thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he's the one that's doing the works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sake verily I say to you how is a Believer how many believes in Jesus Christ amen all right this verse is for you verily I saying to you he that believeth on me then the works that I do shall you do also right can't get away from it and Greater Works than these shall you do because I go to my father that's the bride's ministry right there Greater Works more of them more of them are you with me okay verse 13 and whatsoever you shall ask now this is prayer we're talking about prayer this is the power of prayer whatsoever you ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son but you got to believe it now right you just can't say it oh some sort of wish list you've got to believe it if you ask anything in my name I will do it right and if you love me then keep my Commandments is it it's almost like it's you know two different subjects but you know what he's doing he's trying to tell you this is a relationship it goes both ways it isn't just about what you want from me just use my name or whatever you want he says but look if you truly love me you want me to do that then you need to do the things I'm asking you to do too see he's teaching us a relationship amen and if and I will pray the father see now here's Jesus praying he's telling us to pray and now Jesus is praying for us and I will pray the father and he will give you and he shall give you a another comforter now notice this that he may abide with you for ever how many people could stand today Pro you know pretty much all over the world stand and testify not everybody in the world but so many people in the world the churches could stand and say yes God uh God blessed me one time it was so great I couldn't even think straight I was on cloud n for so many days and I just wanted to lay down my life and and and do everything I could to be a a good Christian and and for some reason I don't feel that way anymore now that is not the promise right the promise that Jesus is talking about is shall abide with you forever so either the devil is lying to you and telling you you don't have it and you're saying yeah I guess I don't so I'm also not or you need to get more because we're talking about the promise of having God With Us forever right amen now this is a guide the Holy Ghost is going to guide us to a proper relationship the reason that God is sending the comforter is to bring us into proper relationship with him because you notice the disciples Walk With Jesus for three what three years three and a half years something like that and look they had power they cast out demons they he all matter of diseases they saw Miracles they saw people raised from the dead they were in glorious meetings they saw fish multiply and BR multiply they seen it all they were they walked with a man amen chosen they were chosen of the man but they were missing a relationship inside they had a carnal relationship oh you know what I'm never leaving the church you know what I'm just GNA I'll be willing to die for you see they were staring at the outside they were thinking about knowing Christ from the outside that's why they were they were they were sad that he was leaving and Jesus is saying look it's going to be better than ever because I'm going to come and live inside you now amen right all right so even the spirit of Truth the comforter now it's called the spirit of Truth whom the world it cannot receive because it seeth him not neither does he neither knoweth him so the world don't know God but you know him praise God you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you so now he's talking to his disciples and he's saying you know what I just want to make this real clear you do not have the Holy Ghost he's dwelling with you and and shall be his future and shall be in you right so when people come to Christ now they come and they give their heart at the altar and they get baptized it does not mean they have received the Holy Ghost but I'll tell you though they got enough Holy Ghost to lead them to the relationship that God is requiring he said I will not leave you comfortless but I will come to you this same Jesus that's talking said I'm coming back to you but it won't be in the form of a physical body it's going to be in the form of the spirit what's inside this body why now think about it why is he saying I won't leave you comfortless why because look as the children of Israel were facing these Giants they knew they needed help but there was only two with another spirit that said we're more than able right I don't want to try to live a Christian Life and try to to to have the character of God without the Hol without the comfort of the Holy Ghost I need someone to take charge I need someone who's who's who's willing to to take care of these giant in in my nature that I don't like amen and I need the comfort of the Holy Ghost and that's what the the the the the comforter is for is to bring us into a a prepared land to take care of the giant so the land can be prepared for a dwelling are you with me so faren all right verse 19 yet a little while and the world sees me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also and at that day you shall know that I am in the father is he talking about a literal day in the calendar or is he talking about a time at a time where Jesus Christ and you become one amen at that day you shall know that I am in the father and you in me and I in you now most people wouldn't think that Jesus would talk like that because it doesn't make sense how can you be in something and something be in you the way the only way to really really be in Christ is to be in the word in other words you're living the word you believe the word you live you eat you sleep you you feed on the word of God every day this has become you the word you make a choice on whether you're going to obey the word or not amen but the way to be in Christ is to be in the word and the way for Christ to be in you is to have the Living Word inside of you amen do you see how it works then it's so it's not a a day it's not a a place like in Fenton but it's a relationship it's a place of a relationship I go to prepare a place for you so it's Christ in us taking over it's a meeting place and he that and I'm going to show you in these following verses he defines what he says in verse 20 here he that have my Commandments and keeps them he it is that loveth me we're talking about a relationship right now and he that loveth me shall be loved to my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him I love this place I love this place right here this is the place I want to be I want to be in a place where I love God enough to keep his word and that God loves me enough to manifest the word in me and then it don't matter what fire I'm in it don't matter who's yelling at me it don't matter if the if if explosions happen everywhere it just doesn't matter because Christ is in me the hope of glory if I have him I have everything amen Judas saith unto him not as scary Lord how is it thou will manifest thyself unto us but not unto the world and Judas Jesus said Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he goes right back to what he said if a man loves me he will keep my words how many times has he said that in these verses and my father he's going to love him something special is going to happen The Father loves everybody but something special is going to happen if we love God Amen and he says we will come unto him and make our bold with him do you know Jesus will not come into somebody who really don't want him there I mean his desire is to live in everybody but he will not he will not cross some free more agency so I'll just say it like this there's enough Holy Ghost for whatever you want you just got to be willing to want it more than you don't want ites that make sense he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which he which ye hear is not of mine but the fathers would sent me these things have I spoken unto you but yet uh uh uh being yet present with you but the comforter I'm going to end with this here but the comforter I'm not going to end the service with this I'm just going to end this reading with this one but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your Rance whatsoever I said unto you now what is he going to teach us what's he going to bring to our remembrance the kind of character that we need to have have Amen to to turn the cheek to go the Second Mile Amen to to to love like he loves am to to live for others to be like he is now I'm just saying you brother Brandon just made it so clear he said if the spirit of Beethoven lived in me then I would play the music that Beethoven played if the spirit of r B lived in me then I would paint pictures just like rant did and if the spirit of Jesus Christ lives in me I won't be able but to help do the same works that Jesus did amen so let's our Focus now to understand this we all got some Holy Ghost right amen praise the Lord praise God for the Holy Ghost we got amen amen but don't you want more see if you want more there's more but you got to go after it amen what what what more do you got to do well Lord what would you have me to do today what would you have me to obey today lay on my heart what you want me to do because the key to getting into this place that he's going to prepare is that we have to love love the word we have to obey the Commandment so it you you you can't wait for the preacher to be said you need to do this and you need to do that and you need to stop doing it it don't work like that it don't work like that it works by love Lord I just I want to be like you I want when people to see me under the fire I want them to see Christ come out I I want the Holy Ghost to Bubble over right I I don't want them to see me being all bothered upset and giving reasons why I'm flying off the handle now if you want that you'll spend time with the word and you'll ask God God what do you want me to do I believe if you pray that with your heart and you keep meaning it eventually he's going to show up and tell you what to do because he wants to give you a chance to prove your love the Bible says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God God wants us to prove with our life to manifest with our lives offer our life to him all right St John chapter 16 16 now you know no matter how many notes I get I never get done so we're not going to be to finish everything but you just have to pray that it God just reveals it all to you it's my desire that you have it all amen St John chapter 16 verse number 7 nevertheless I tell you the truth is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send them to you I'm going to send directly to you now here is the workings of the Holy Ghost right this is what we want to get into this is God working what's going to happen when you get the Holy Ghost and when he has come he's going to reprove the world the carnal the world part of your nature he's going to reprove it he's going to convict he's going to rebuke it he's going to he's going to show its faults of sin and he's going to show the real righteousness and you're going to bring judgment you're going to be the one that says I don't want this in my life and I I I resist you Satan I submit myself therefore to God I resist the devil and he will flee from me this is the workings of the Holy Ghost in Simplicity in a man's life of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because I go to the father and you see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged now here's the thing you know we can get all bent out of shape of all the bad stuff that's happening in the world and there's a lot of it and it just seems to keep escalating like the lids off of hell we know that and things are just getting worse out there we're still looking for some little bit of Hope but you know what things are going down we cannot change the world I wish I could just stand up today don't want ever stand here this is where we just kneel before the Lord I wish I could just stand there and say I'm making a declaration there should be no more abortions we're getting rid of all the clinics we're breaking all the laws I wish I could say that and it would be over but you can't change the world but you know what you can do you can judge the world that's inside of you you can take a stand against that nature that's been there and you're you haven't overcome yet yet and you know what why do you want to murmur and complain and get all bent out of shape out there when you're letting sin rain right here come on I mean the Holy Ghost is for you if the world don't want it that's fine but the Holy Ghost is for you but you got to be you got to get real with it amen verse 12 says I Jesus said I have yet many things to say unto you but you can't handle it you can't handle it you ever come to church hear the word being preached and he said can't wait to get out of there or maybe you know what he said that right at me he was thinking about me when he said I I I locked him with his eyes he was looking right at me brother bman you know that's the way the devil does it you know but you know what God has confidence that we can live the whole word that we can be Overcomers that we can be just like him because we've been predestinated to it it has to happen how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth all of it he's not satisfied job said I'll not be satisfied till I awake in his likeness I want to awake in his likeness I want to be like him I've seen myself so much I don't like myself I don't but I like Jesus in me I like that part for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and it shall show you things to come so the spirit of air is going to speak about himself the spirit of Heir wants you to get what your flesh wants but Jesus had to come to a place where he denied himself said not my will Lord thine be done so the father's will is the most important thing how what would you think if I told you that we we didn't we we just made it halfway really that's what you would say I'm glad I'm not asking lots of questions the holy spirit is never going to lead us away from the truth the holy spirit is never going to lead us away from church come on I want to hear I want to hear the whole church say Amen to that the the Holy Spirit would never lead us to compromise with the word to separate from the body of Christ or to make our personal lives more important than our relationship with Jesus Christ amen so church is important very important brother brand said in the me in the message questions and answers he said someone said to me not long ago said why brother brandom uh why why uh we don't need anybody to teach us when the Holy Ghost comes we don't need anybody to teach us you know the scripture right okay the Bible says that you don't need need any teaching brother B said then why did the same Holy Spirit set in the church teachers see see set the church in order we've got to have teachers that's right but you ought not just to have anyone but now as far as the scripture or teaching it takes a Holy Ghost anointed that's it's brother brother Bruce that is that's exactly the word that brother BR said that's right as soon as you said that it's like you're reading my notes and God has set the church in order by Apostles prophets Gifts of healing Miracles and so forth he set the church in order and put the teachers and so forth in there to guide and to direct the church amen see different than the man-made denomination Nations who are just led by man God did put men in the church directed by the Holy Ghost to lead the church so we see the balance here we've got to come to church Braham said in the message the church and its conditions he said see the holy spirit is sent from God to take the word of God and to give it to us as we have need of so when you don't come to church you know what you're saying I don't need the word I don't need the word or or let's just try to say it real nicely I already have the word now look I'm only speaking to those who want a complete relationship with Jesus amen I'm not I'm not speaking to those who who only want it part way or think they can they've been tricked by the devil and think this is all we need to do and we're we're going to make it look I am not here to judge whether you're going to make it or not make it but I am telling you what it takes to be in a Rapture he's not rapturing immature Christians he's marrying a wife that's mature without spot without wrinkle and I'll say it like this it's going to take more than you just saying Jesus died for me and I I Believe In The Blood brother brandom said that blood has to be applied yes he said the light that was in that blood needs to come back onto the believer and he needs to manifest that word and when so in the Old Testament when I see the blood I'll pass over you in the New Testament when I see the life of that blood manifest in you I'll pass over you so look I I know this is strong I know this is hard but look I love you God loves you and God wants us to make it we've got to become more serious and don't be looking at churches while I can take it or leave it don't do that because in here God is trying to get you his word CU you need it amen let's Stand Together God bless you amen praise the Lord thank you for your your patience and I thank the Lord that he thank the Lord for his grace I I i' like to uh pray and if I could I'd like to read a prayer uh that uh brother brandom prayed it was in the message the impersonation of Christianity if you just want to maybe close your eyes for a second just think about these words as as he's praying them he says now in Christ Jesus name with heads bowed before God not me uh will you raise your hand and say God put your spirit in me this is my hand God bless you many hands amen and father God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thy son the ever brooding wooing cing Holy Spirit I ask that you today will take your place in in the heart of every person that raised their hand that signified to you that they
