I believe [Music] Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe amen there is the separation between what can be accomplished and and what is hindered is just simply believing and we become completely manifested just through believing and I'm so thankful as brother Brandon said God is hidden Simplicity and all we have to do is believe the more we can get away from our understanding and figuring it out um the more that God can have his his way good morning to each of you I just wanted to give thanks for everyone that labored in some way for the couple's meeting yesterday God bless each each of you from the from the setup to the cleanup to the watching of the kids to to and putting this whole thing together um to our our sister serving and I just want to say thank you and God bless you to each of you making it possible that we could have this this time together and I'm so thankful that there's the love of Christ in our church to where we can do these things and in in reach out and just create an atmosphere of love and respect and and and just to grow as the Bible says in Grace and in the love of God so may the Lord bless you uh we appreciate brother George Smith uh coming and being here with us um and this is the only service that he they'll have here and so what we want to do is take advantage of this opportunity um and just pull the word from him like the things that are on your heart the things that you're Desiring just Lord give me Revelation through this ministry today and let me leave here with something more than I had before I came amen um we're just going to turn this over and to to our brother and say and sing um Lord I receive Lord I receive as our brother comes to minister the wonderful Words of Life Lord I receive Lord I receive all things are possible Lord I receive Lord I receive [Music] D Lord I receive all things are possible Lord I [Music] good morning it's good to be here this morning right if you have your Bible we're going to look in the book of Galatians and um it's right after Corinthians and I think brother John for the invitation and to be one of them some people say well which one of them we're the ones going up we're not part of the other ones I just want to read these first five verses here to get started Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but of Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead and all the Brethren which are with me unto the churches of galatia Grace speak to you and peace from God the father and from our Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself for our sins that he might Deliver Us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our father to whom be glory and ever forever and ever amen you may be seated now the um last time I was here was last year about this time we were in another church the first time I've actually ministered in your nice new church it's beautiful and the beauty of the church is in the beauty of the people but um we finished the book of Acts and if you don't remember then we'll have to start over but it was a good journey we had through the book of Acts and I'm not a theologian I don't you know put this together for certain reasons but I see where the way the Lord has directed this it's it's designed to make you want to go and read more of the word you see and Jesus himself said over next in John 8 32 you shall know the truth how are you going to know the truth because you were in the truth you got in there and you studied it you shall know the truth the truth shall make you free now the alternative to that because there's the A and the B you know so you shall know the truth and truth shall make you free but the alternative is to remain captive and possibly very deceived ignorant and with a no care attitude I'm sure you know a few people like that you know but God has employed the spirit of Elijah five times I don't know of any other Ministry that he um love so much that he used that many times but God employs the spirit of God the spirit of Elijah five times throughout history and the promise of our age is in Malachi 4 verses 5 and 6. now this isn't new to most of you but just to you know lay the groundwork and Jesus referred to this same verse when he's speaking over in Matthew 17 11 and he clarified it a little bit made it a little more clear to turn the hearts means to restore to bring back to original and so we've been brought back to the original Apostolic Faith the apostolic Doctrine and the scripture you see so your homework for this week is to study Matthew 17 verses 10 through 13. keep in mind that Mr Schofield was a trained lawyer just like Martin Luther and so he looked at things in a a certain way and so all his all the work that Mr Schofield did or brother Schofield was with pen and pencil they didn't have a computer okay he had a few friends had paper that had pencils and they did all this work and they finished all their work on January 1st 1909. so yeah all that was already done and then you go study those verses see what he says about it in the in the bottom of the page and it's amazing because that has always been there for the last 110 years or so and why didn't we read it they yet unfulfilled yeah it's right there in the Bible but anyway God fulfilled his word in our generation and he sent his restoration Prophet exactly in the spirit of Elijah we knew he was William Branham and He restored the faith back to the scripture and so now we can know the truth and the truth sets us free it's not because so-and-so said so no because the word says so you see now in Acts chapter 15 we had a situation where there was controversies came up with yearly Believers and so the apostles had a bit of a conference and they came up with an epistle or a letter to be read in the groups back then and we would call it today we would call it Church order and so um so brother Paul and brother Barnabas stayed there in Antioch for a while and they had completed their first missionary journey they were resting enjoying the Revival and Paul was receiving letters from places where they had been now he was their father in The Gospel he had brought the gospel to them and um uh so he wrote letters back planting doctrinal seeds correcting situations and their trips were all on foot either on foot on a donkey maybe a horse but nothing like today so if we look at Acts chapter 15 for a minute uh let's see here you'll have to bear with me I'm getting used to these new progressive lenses and uh so chapter 15 of Acts verse 36 and some days later Paul said unto Barnabas let us go again and visit our brother in every city where that we have preached the word of the Lord and see how they do so they'd finished one Journey they stayed there a while and that's when he was getting these letters so between verses 35 and 36 is where we find him writing this letter to the Believers in several areas of galatia this was an area that was under Roman rule at the time and he described it in his first trip in Acts 13 and 14 and later in chapter 16 of Acts but of great significance at this point I'd like to say that um Martin Luther um said the words of Saint Paul are not dead words they're living creatures and they have hands and feet they are alive you know it's not just flat you know and so um so we must read the word carefully not like a newspaper you see and if you remember when brother Brown was telling about beyond the curtain of time it was all based on the fact that he preached what Paul preached and we all that were there we said we're depending on that not that you knew my name and my grandmother's and all that no that you preached but Paul preached you know so it's very important now back in those days they did not have the um advantage of voice recordings or video recordings with the luxury that we have to hear the changes in voice and and decide for each one of us what he really meant no they didn't have that it was letters they wrote it very carefully and that's why and keep turning in First Corinthians chapter one um First Corinthians chapter 1 verse 21 he says for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe so preaching is Forever part of the word of God and you know not everyone today understands Kentucky English uh I know it's hard to believe but uh I've been to different parts of this country and uh and other countries around the world and we have you know we have the English recordings but there's still an infinite number of interpretations even in English and but he plainly said say what the tapes say so you know it's my uh it's my opinion at least that you must pray before you even open your Bible you know you must get into the proper spirit before you even listen to God's Prophet you don't just turn on like changing the stations on a radio you know and so today uh with your permission we're going to preach out of brother randoms absolute it's called Holy Scripture now these people in galatia which is currently a part of Turkey these people were Greek citizens okay but they were descendants from the Gauls that's g-a-u-l-l-s um people from the north from France Belgium Switzerland along with original Celts and they were a blend of Italian Greek and Jew as one historian writes a stream from the torrent of Barbarians which poured into Greece in the third Century before Christ so not real Pleasant people but that's that's what the Galatians were so even though they had been in the area for 200 years they did they just had a different set of values you know when somebody moves in here from Canada or from wherever they just see things a little differently you know they go through Walmart and they pick up different stuff than you do different set of values and uh so as new believers they were not totally settled in this new way they had heard they were baptized and they believed but they weren't totally settled and therefore they became easy pickings for these judaizing missionaries that came up from Palestine which were converts from very strict Jewish religion following the exact words of Moses converted into the liberty of Christ and what they were proposing to these people no you can't just come into this you've got to come through Judaism okay something's wrong here so these wheel these well-meaning legalists were intent on bending the minds of the new believers and um these lovely people were just simply out of balance and that's why we brought our friend here to there's nowhere earlier to put it we'll put it down here and you can imagine but um that's to give you a visual when I say balance that's what we're talking about got to be even can't be you know lopsided and no everything's got to be even so these people were out of balance so Paul had to administer the grace of God to bring the situation back level again refocus on Calvary okay and um I'll try not to get lost here in order pages but um there's two things he had to deal with in the book of Galatians one they were teaching strict obedience to the law of Moses which must be mingled with faith in order for the sinner to obtain justification in their narrow of you they could not see Jesus as a replacement for the law of Moses they did not understand the scriptures and the grace of God and they were not flexible and able to turn the corner they couldn't stay balanced they couldn't just follow what the word says see and two um then the Justified believer is made perfect by keeping the law so they were teaching that Christ Alone was not sufficient this message needs our help and I have heard that a lot of times in my short lifetime brother Brandon's okay yeah he didn't really know his Bible too well so we're going to help him that's not the way it works no he had the Vindication we're just repeaters and so when Luther came along you know in the the fifth messenger his message was Christ Alone we don't need all these Trinkets and all this stuff and candles and blah blah blah you people that came from Catholicism you know exactly what we're talking about so he had to stand against all that stuff but we've come full circle now and we've got all the trinkets again under the guise of Malachi 4. it's pathetic we're going to get to that why we're doing that so after prayer Paul wrote what we know is six chapters to bring balance to these followers in galatia so we've read the salutation of um uh Paul over here in first in chapter one and so it's a lengthy salutation but with all respect and love of the Brethren you know it's it's all one sentence he was great at using words what we read there verses one through five is one sentence you see so we could eat we could learn even from that and um and the fact is that we always have the twin that shows up anytime you have a a move of God whatever size or small or big there's always the twin to try to knock it down every time you see so um verse six and seven I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ into another gospel which is not another but there are there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ you see so they had gone off on a side road of imagination they they wandered off the track thinking that it's going to be okay yeah we we love Paul we love Christ but you know this this law this sounds a little more something we can do we put our two dollars into it no so acts 4 says neither is there salvation in any other for there's no other name under Heaven given among men who are most whereby we must be saved so there's only one way to God by the cross that's why it's up here so you can see it every time you come to church there's no other way Allah will not take you to the Cross Allah will take you to the hot place guaranteed sorry but it's true there's only one way to heaven you see and so to keep the foundation steady and level uh we can look at over a second second Timothy that's right back here um Second Timothy chapter 3 where he um he's writing a letter to Timothy he says over here in verse 16 all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction for righteousness that the man of God may be perfectly thorough be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works so bottom line is God Is Not the author of confusion that's comes from somewhere else you see so our messenger plainly said you read your Bible and pray every day and uh if you study the message at all you'll find it where he says back to the word over 200 times so it might be important it wasn't just a little hint back to the word over 200 times and um the the fact is that God knows what is going on he knows how to take care of things and he's a god of order he's not a god of disorder and however it falls no and that's why brother John took so much care to you know make things look nice here there's a reason you know and so um uh verse 8 and 9 but though we okay that's him his helpers you know John Martin George Smith William Brandon whoever we or even if an angel comes out of heaven um preach any other gospel unto you then that which I already have preached to you by Revelation let him be accursed in other words you don't pay attention you don't try to reason with him you cut it off you see yeah and if you wasn't paying attention verse 9 as I just said to you so say I now again if any man preaches any other gospel uh unto you then that which we have than what you have received let him be accursed so that is why we have so many problems today worldwide in churches around the world not just the people carrying these books but big and small churches because they're not sticking with Paul said my brother branham's the only person I know that God took beyond the curtain time brought back and told what he saw and it was in line with scripture and so that was the that was the Crux of it right there I preach what Paul preached no problem well if if we would examine our experience in our Doctrine by scripture we wouldn't have so many problems it's got to be it's got to be Bible or forget it you see so um I'm you know it's too bad that that it uh hurts people's feelings but we're not playing games we're not giving out gold stars you don't get free coffee if you come to church you come you listen you live it you know so if we apply the magnifying glass we'll find that every confusing issue that we have leads right back to verse 8. which is because they're not saying what Paul said that's the filter that's the verse for the time that we're living in and so if any issue doesn't pass through the word test with the message with Paul forget it I don't care how nice it sounds what the promises are you gotta stick with the truth that's right okay so 11-23 is where he testifies of his apostleship being called of God because Vindication is very important either you're with God or you're not and you can't pretend this isn't this isn't Disney no it's reality and um that is why we're very careful about what we hear what we speak because many people today have great ideas you know convictions they'll fight you for their version of the truth I've seen them they will literally fight you and burn your house down for their version of the truth but if it doesn't square with Paul we're not interested you see I hate to be very repetitious but it has to be said so I have one simple question of them for them okay where is your Vindication now you're fighting for this version where's your Vindication where's your picture of the pillar of fire right you know so it's not there so the word has not been quickened so it's only words on paper to a lot of people and um it will never be quickened until you're born again now if you don't enjoy the word then you need more time in prayer you need to get closer to God so that his word can feed you so anybody with Elementary education can open the Bible That's not hard to do but the word has to be revealed to you personally brother Brian says look for Revelation more than anything else it's more important than your job your wife anything because if God's not revealed to you then it's just words on paper you see so that's why we take our time and go through this uh slowly if we can and to be sure that everybody understands because we didn't come here to waste time when you come here just to see what George looks like or why did you know John where what is that purple whatever it's not blue yeah did you dress yourself so we have to create the atmosphere for the work you see Hunger for the word okay let's look at verse 13 of chapter one it says here for ye have heard of my conversation in time past that means my lifestyle with the Jews religion how the beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it because he was zealous for what he believed he was a follower of Moses and anything that didn't line up with Moses out of here and of course we have movies and everything else about it but he was very zealous and uh profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in my own Nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers so right there traditions of my fathers he knew it wasn't it was revealed to him there wasn't word but they had it was so ingrained in them so ingrained just like when Peter uh you remember back in chapter 10 of Acts Peter being you know come from Judaism and he wasn't a real educated person but just in their everyday life just like you the you guys were in Catholicism it's just your everyday life we do it because that's what they told us they didn't have to match the Bible and so Peter back there um no we don't eat these things we don't eat those things and then that sheet came down from heaven with all these animal centers you know because that was his vision it wasn't mine he had to get the interpretation to it but no Lord I'm I'm holy I'm Jewish I've never touched that kind of stuff but God was showing him it's time to turn the corner it's okay to go to the Gentiles now and you know the whole story okay verse 15. but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the Heathen that's us immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood neither one after Jerusalem to them there were Apostles before me but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter in a boat with them 15 days that's two weeks but other of the Apostles I didn't see any except James the Lord's brother now the things which I write to you behold before God I align on afterwards I came to the regions of Syria and celicia and was Unknown by faith unto the churches of Judea which were in Christ but they had heard only that he which persecuted Us in times past now preaches Faith which ones he destroyed and they glorify God in Me now that had to be a big challenge for those people back there yeah because here's the guy and he killed Grandma it was that simple and then these people are in jail and everything because they're part of the way and so uh now he's preaching the truth well it would take a little bit of time to adjust to that you know um brother Ryan who says we with our American Spirit would have never picked Paul forget it bad boy but God says don't touch him he's my man now why God let him do all these other things only God knows why did God permit William Branham to to listen to his mother-in-law and all those thousands and thousands of people destroyed in the flood that he could have avoided all that God knows he didn't ask us to figure it out so all the Church of Jesus Christ back at that time would have been very suspicious of this guy Paul but once they had Fellowship once they heard him defend the name of Jesus Christ they were at peace and they glorified God in Me it was all settled it was back balance okay chapter two we're only having one service today right is there any food left over from Allison last night so chapter two is all about the circumcision and the Face-Off he had with Peter and you can read it very carefully verses 20 through 21 where are we at here at the end of the chapter he says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ lives in me in the Life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God Who Loved Me gave himself for me I do not frustrate or contradict the grace of God for if righteousness comes by the law then Christ is dead in vain so the law was over here that's all they knew just remember all they had was the Bible down through Malachi they didn't have a new testament they were living it out it wasn't written you know they had they had the um the testimonies of the Apostles but the scriptures was back here that that's the only Bible they had and so um if that's if that's all there is and we have to obey these these rules well then why did Christ die but the message was you all memorize this back here here's the Fulfillment of it here this day this scripture is fulfilled same thing we're preaching today the Bible says it we saw it we heard it and people still don't believe because they like their Traditions they like the the Baptist the Methodist the whatever you know they're going around around Circle and not really getting out of their comfort zone but you've made a bold step to come away from whatever you were to believe the truth amen so God knows what he's doing so in his explanation of the truth he had to deal with uh items of the law that these people wanted to impose on these new Believers these people in galatia so if we focus on Father Abraham for example uh Romans 4 Galatians 3 and James 2 Abraham believed God and it was counted or attributed like credit to your bank account attributed to for righteousness and second Corinthians 5 7 we walk by faith not by sight so a plea a Believer simply believes God by faith Revelation not because you learned it by memory anybody can read and memorize but what about being revealed you know get on inside to where it's a part of us so that's what chapter two has to deal with chapter 3 verse 1 all foolish Galatians who has Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ have been evidently set forth crucified among you great question you know and see most people back then couldn't read so it's not like today uh they sure didn't have cell phones or anything they couldn't read and they depended on the clergy to tell them you know the truth and um uh in verse two he says this only what I learn of you received you the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of the faith ah another good question are you so foolish having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh so he's he goes right to the point doesn't fool around see and um on down through five have you suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that ministereth to you of the spirit and works miracles among you does he do it by The Works of the law or the hearing of faith so what Paul was doing he was making Christ real to those people yes this is only uh probably 50 years after the crucifixion more or less and it was something very fresh this is the new religion you might say but it's based in their scripture it wasn't based on on anything else and so brother bran says today that The Minister's job is to make Christ real to the people so we read it we try to make it real too he had you know he had his many ways of making Christ real so we Gentiles are the children of Abraham and we walk by faith just as Paul did you know and it's like he told us over here in chapter two I'm crucified with Christ now it's not me it's Christ's living units so it all fits together and yes there's some repetitions necessary so verse 6 of chapter 3 even as Abraham believed God it was accounted to him for righteousness now there's one there's many other places know you therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture for seeing that God would justify the Heathen through faith preached before the gospel under Abraham saying in these shall All Nations be blessed so then they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham so yes we are children of Abraham we're living in the 21st century not under Traditions not under customs of the elders and God does not expect us to dress like Abraham and then live in tents and so forth but to have the same Faith perfect faith we believe right alongside Abraham you see and um what Abraham Christ uh would they be or even William Brandon would he be comfortable walking alongside you know would you be comfortable if Abraham was walking beside you one day or if Christ or brother ran him you know so we are of the same of the same uh thinking um verse 8 and the scripture foreseeing the god justify the Heathen yeah we read that okay so that's referring back to Genesis 12 3 where that God made the promise to Abraham let's look at that real close uh Genesis 12 and verse 3. and if you didn't bring your Bible well I'll say shame on you because you came to battle without a gun uh 12 and 3 and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him the curseth thee and indeed shall all the families of the earth be blessed there's the promise right there now we have in the Middle East we've got the Jews which are children of Abraham and we've got the Arabs which are children of Abraham yes because if you study your Bible you'll find out that um you know uh Hagar brought Abraham a son and his name was Ishmael okay the Seed of Abraham and he had 12 sons and Isaac had 12 sons so now God's got to divide things up and when he divided the land he gave the children of Ishmael more square miles than he gave the children of Isaac and they're not happy with that they want to push Isaac's people into the sea and be done with them well it's not going to happen but um uh the fact is they're all children of Abraham you see and they have the promise now when you go over there some of you have been there um you're going down the road okay here's the Israelites living here the Jewish people and the Arabs living over here so the Israel people they have the nice painted fence cars washed trees trimmed houses painted but over here you've got people living in misery yeah the car's on blocks the weeds are grown up and so the tourists ask how come and the tour guide says very simple Genesis says I'll bless those who bless thee I'll curse those that curse thee so if I was a if I was you know Arab um I saw there's an obvious difference here I would I would say well let's try it for six months see if it works let's just let's just honor the god of Israel see if if the promise works you know but um uh they um they live the way they do and so Christ alive in your daily life shows which side of the fence you live on Amen okay we're in chapter three and verse 10. for as many as are of works of the law are under the curse for these written curses everyone that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident but the just shall live by faith and see he didn't make that up he's quoting scripture which is in habakkuk 2 4. and the law is not of Faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them so he's quoting from a scripture written 600 years before Christ the scripture that Paul also uses in Romans 1 17 and in Hebrews 10 38 and we're most familiar with you know when Martin Luther you know was reading it it struck him about 500 years ago God's word is living it's got fingers and toes it's moving it's real verse 13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed to everyone that heneth on a tree that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith you see so Christ suffered and died we all believe that and he was buried he rose again the third day for you and for me to bring the blessing of Abraham unto us the Gentiles it's all by faith there's nobody here that's seen God we have his word this is where we see him you see so we jump down to verse 24. of chapter three wherefore the law was our Schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ so there was a good purpose in the law it kept us in the word it brought us to Christ that we might be justified by faith okay but after that faith has come we're no longer under the Schoolmaster okay that's that's finished we graduated to Faith you see and uh verse 26 for you are all the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ for as many as you as you have been baptized unto Christ have put on Christ that's the purpose of the baptism is to show the world what has been done on the inside look over at Romans chapter 6 real quickly here just for a minute let's see Romans 6 and verse 3. of Romans 6. know you not that so many no you're not that so many of us were as were baptized in the Jesus Christ were baptized unto his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism unto death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by glory of God the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life and that's the whole purpose of water baptism so back to Galatians chapter 3 verse 28 there's neither Jew nor Greek that's what he was dealing with there or we could say today neither African-American Mexican whatever there's neither uh Bond or free there's neither male or female for we all one in Christ Jesus and if we beat Christ then are you Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so God looks at us differently than we see each other he only sees redeemed people he sees you know redeemed people worshiping him all focusing on the Lamb of God and that is one of the benchmarks of this wonderful message that we Proclaim the um the attention was never on the messenger it's my personal opinion because I was there when he died that one of the main reasons God probably took him at that time because idolatry was gaining strength you see the attention was never on William bran it was on Jesus Christ the son of God see and we have The Loving Story of of elies are going to seek the bride for Isaac in Genesis 24. brother REM said that's an exact picture of my Ministry aliens are going to get the bride for the bridegroom okay so and yes we're breezing through this so that you can go back and read it for yourself but chapter four uh more comparisons of Grace versus law verse 8 for example how be it then when you knew not God okay you didn't know God you did service unto them which by Nature are no Gods which okay they're worshiping idols um but now after that you have known God or rather are known of God I'll turn you again to weak empirically elements where until you desire again to be in bondage why are you going back to that stuff You observe days and months and times and years and he says I'm afraid of you lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain Brethren I beseech you be as I am for I am as you are you have not injured me at all you know how though through infirmities of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first and my Temptation which was in my flesh you despise not nor rejected but received me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus verse 28. now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise but as then but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now and it's going on to this day and will go on to the last day because you can never appease the enemy if you had a if you had a map with a thousand pieces to it 999 would be the the Islam people and one is Judaism they can't stand that they want to wipe that one out also so God is in charge of this whole thing see we don't have to bite our fingernails he's in charge he's got the whole thing under control because he sees the whole thing on one page he knows the end from the beginning okay chapter five uh verse one what do we have here Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty where with Christ have made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage verse 6 for in Christ Jesus for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision available anything or uncircumcision but Faith with which worketh by love and then verse 13 for Brethren ye have been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if you bite and devour one another take heed that she be not consumed because you will be if you keep it up verse 16. this I say walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh and that's why when Temptation comes things start to get tough go back to the word put on the proper music change the atmosphere we are miserable because we make it that way a lot of times we we go to the wrong websites we we do things no get back to what's right to see where are we at here 15 16 yeah 17. for the flesh lusts against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh we all know that we're adults and these are contrary one to another so that you cannot do the things that she would but if you be led of the spirit you are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication and cleanness lasciviousness idolatry which care for hatred variants and relations wrath strife seditions heresies and things man it's a whole big list of bad things right he says here of the which I tell you before as I have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God so there it is it's black it's white you got a choice verse 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let's not be desirous of vain Glory provoking one another envying one another no no contention no bad attitudes those aren't fruits of the spirit those aren't you you can't be hateful and read the word of God one is going to win and you're going to lose out you know so there's a lot of good instruction in these six chapters and in six and verse one Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault okay it happens you which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest also thou be tempted Okay so is possible and we've we've known there's people fall into traps you know and but they have a genuine desire to be free unless they're lying to you and then of course you're going to get worse but those that are strong spiritually the clean life restore such a one in meekness in other words in humility not with power not with shaming and you sorry thing no in meekness do as you would want to be treated because we're all human you know so uh just imagine Jesus stopping by and washing your feet that would make you pretty humble that's right you know so verse 2 very ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ how do we wear one another's burdens it's a good question by staying in prayer okay stay in prayer with the correct atmosphere around you at all times so that you are there when you're needed you can't be excuse me can be fighting in court and all kinds of bad things and then called on for service no you gotta you got to stay in in the spirit of Christ so that you're there when you're needed and in that capacity you can help those that are in need of comfort be a help when possible be patient with all and when needed we can warn the ones that are acting inappropriately uh-huh that's true first Thessalonians chapter five let's look at that must be a good reason to be in here first first Thessalonians um chapter five uh we got here uh first Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 14. now we exhort your brethren warn them that are unruly in other words acting you know why they shouldn't Comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient towards all men that's that's the order of things of how we can help people you see uh I'm sure you're familiar with alums of Bible it's another translation which is very similar to ours Brethren knew the man he says now beseech you my brother and correct those who offend now this is this is from first Thessalonians 5 14. I beseech you my brother correct those who offend comfort those who lack knowledge I'm sorry correct those who lack courage bear the burdens of the weak and be patient towards all men so thus we fulfill the law of Christ as spoken by our master in in Matthew 5 44. love your enemies bless them that curse you so do give to them they hate you pray for them which despitefully use and persecute you now that sounds impossible but those are that's Jesus commands it's not just you know bless those that take you out to supper bless those that you know buy you something no you got to be nice to everybody see we don't know we don't know who the elect are we don't know who the enemy are we kind of okay looks like it might be them but you gotta be nice to everybody until they just cut you off entirely you know and the devil doesn't know who the good people and bad people are so he just smacks everybody you know yeah so the law of laodicea is hold a grudge wait to get even never show any weakness that's laodicea but that's contrary love your enemies bless them that do good bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them which despitefully used you and persecute you and if you read any church history you'll see how that the Saints of the past that's what they did they went the extra mile they they suffered so uh we don't want to be part of laodicea no so verse 3 of chapter six if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing he deceives himself now we've seen some of those people you know we call them one abuse you know you know some of them just be yourself I mean if you can't do nothing else but but just straighten up the chairs or run the vacuum just do something I don't know how to build a place but I know how to you know keep clean you know so um because you see others can see right through you they know when you're a wannabe they know when you're a fake and small children especially can see through you you can't lie to those little kids they can see through you yeah yeah okay verse 4. but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another for every man shall bear his own burden so we should not compare ourselves to others we we use the measuring stick of the word am I Measuring Up am I level with the word you see not with a b and c because each one of them will give account to God by themselves they will give account to God you do as God leads you and he will bless you because when we get there now why didn't you do this John well because you know this and that sorry I showed you to do this you should have done that you know yeah and he will bless you okay verse six let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things so we got to be positive never competitive never looking down on anybody just be positive say good things about one another nice beard you got brother you know nice haircuts you got verse 7 be not deceived God is Not mocked for whosoever whatsoever of man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth through his flesh of the flesh reap corruption he that soweth it to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting okay and let us not be weary well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not verse 10 as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them that are of the household of faith so first we get things done here then we can help those people overseas you got to be sure everything's done correctly here you know verse 14. but God forbid that I should Glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world uh by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world so we Glory only in the cross not in anything else anywhere we glory in the cross Verse 18 Brethren the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you with your spirit amen so that is our brief uh run through of the book of Galatians and if you read it carefully you will probably get more out of it but um there's only so much person can take in one sitting you know you don't eat so much chicken so if you don't take so much word at one time so may God bless you and we'll see you again soon together wow that was the speed through the book of Galatians wasn't it but really really good really good thank you praise the lord we heard some more about Abraham and about faith and I do believe the Lord is is calling our faith to rise higher in our church and I believe it's because he wants to do more that we have to believe more there's a requirement first and um we have to keep our eyes on the word on Christ and get get them basically off of one another or off our problems are off our difficulties or even the very thought of I can't believe I'm having a hard time believing um our Brotherhood instructed us today that we need to spend more time in prayer more time in the word so that Christ can become more real to us because ultimately uh we've got to we've got to put on Christ we've got to Manifest this this love for one another this burden for one another this being Christ to one another and put off the old man um and so may today we take heed to the things that we heard the what our brother brought to our attention to our memory may we just be stirred to to put on Christ and to want to be our very best for him not you know sometimes we go to somebody's house and we want to we want to just we want to be respectful and and be our best uh behavior when we're in their house um but it's it's yes this is God's house but we just want to be on our best for Jesus no matter where we're at what we're doing and um what a a blessed people we are to be in the truth and to better come to a place and and hear the word of God and her brother mentioned over and over and over it's it the word is our absolute the word the word the word and and um and and many are fighting over over what brother Branham said and if we just get the revelation of the word our life will manifest what he really said and we don't have to prove anything our life will do it and um the very the very fact that you can love like Christ late on your life like Christ to serve like Christ that what greater manifestation do we need and you don't have enough to be a theologian for that you just the love of Christ shed abroad in a heart you know amen so we really appreciated that word let's let's sing to be like Jesus I know that's our desire today to be like Jesus to be like Jesus [Music] on Earth I love long to be like him all through life's journey
