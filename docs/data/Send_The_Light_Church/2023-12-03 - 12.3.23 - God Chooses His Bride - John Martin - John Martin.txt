he's with us when we're driving we believe he's with us in our homes amen why would we question that he's here in church amen he wants to do exceedingly above all that we would ask or even think of him to do for us in our lives be certainly appreciated that Brother Bruce obeying the Lord in singing that song and I think that's a that's a good testimony for all of us God put something on your heart for for his people we need to do it amen amen amen but I want to say thank you and thank the Lord but I want to thank you for our time yesterday what a wonderful wonderful Christmas time together a celebration some worship some some good fellowship and I I am at all because of the workers the laborers the cleaners the givers the preparers so much was put in and I think about this so often when I'm I sit down to eat dinner at home if we make it and because sometimes we go out and get stuff you know um all the time that's put in to Preparing the meal amen much more than what it takes to eat it mean brother ronal was telling me spent so much time on making those cookies yesterday that we ate yesterday enjoyed and so I want to say thank you from the bottom of heart for all the labor preparation and the cleaning may God reward you on the other side very much is my prayer amen well let's go to the Lord in a word of prayer and then we'll get right into the word our heavenly father we thank you this morning that you've given us all health and strength to be here today we are missing those Lord who are sick and body we pray that you would be with them Father we thank you for the desire that you placed in our heart to love you to serve you to give you our lives and Lord that that Still Remains there inside of us and we thank you that you haven't taken it away we thank you that you haven't taken your your Holy Spirit Away we thank you that Lord You're Still Here revealing your word to your people father we ask Lord as that song that was sung that you would come now the breaking of the bread of life to us Lord unless you reveal to us what we read what we he Lord it will not profit us and we just ask Lord that your presence would come to each one of our hearts Lord no matter how tired we might be no matter uh what the things that we're thinking about we just pray that you would help us to to get in that same vein where you're at this morning that we might be able to receive from you Lord what you have for us believe that you're here to give us your word father now we pray that you'd bless the reading of the word bless our eyes and bless our hearts for Lord you told your disciples and you told us blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear this morning we're a blessed people we thank you Lord for doing what no man can do we commit the service to you now pray that you'd meet every need that there would be amongst us and may there not be uh Lord doubts or questions but Lord May there be an atmosphere of Faith this morning we pray these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen St John chapter 15 and then also if you could put your finger in Romans chapter 8 we got two scripture readings this morning we want to entitle this message God chooses his bride God chooses his bride brother Brandon preached a message it's one of my favorite messages in uh California in ' 65 at there the end of April called the choosing of a bride and it it it I recommend if we got time at the end I want to read quote that he spoke at the end of that and for a subject this morning how do I know that I'm chosen how do I know I'm chosen St John chapter 15 start with verse we're just going to read one verse actually one verse number 16 ye have not chosen me but I've chosen you amen and I ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and that whatsoever you shall asking the father ask of the father in my name he may give it you Amen in Romans chapter 8 verse 29 and verse 30 for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that we might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did pre destinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified amen and God bless you you may be seated bam said in the message the revelation of Jesus Christ he said may this little time of coming together not only be for the edify of our own Souls but may it be to the enlightening to Enlighten us in such a way and Inspire us to we go and tell others amen may it be a time of rededication uniting with the full body of Christ and being ready for the Rapture these are comforting scriptures right here to know that the all knowing god knew us before the world ever began that's right and by this for knowledge he predestinated us to be the bride of Jesus Christ and one day soon we're going in a rapture we won't be going into a tribulation do you believe that we that we we by God's grace he paid the price so we didn't have to go through tribulation and because we came under full obedience to the word we get to escape tribulation said in the message Revelations chapter 4 part one he says immediately after the church age is over the leodan church age then the Rapture comes so I want to say today that we're still in the leoan church age and that's why we battle such lukewarmness at times because we're still fighting that thing and even though we received the message and we're becoming the bride of Christ that spirit is still here and we still bump heads with it amen 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 15 just trying to lay a foundation because the bride is is going to be raptured amen 1 Thessalonians 4:15 says for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first amen then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words amen these words are comforting but I have to ask the question to myself how do I know that God has chosen me I think that's a good question in the message the door to the heart brother Braham said and as myself I believe tonight if the Rapture would come and they went according to your worthiness I would perhaps be the last one to go and he says I don't say that to be humble he really meant that there are many other people that have read the same scriptures that they read that we just read this morning so my question is has God chosen them as well as us are they elected too has God predestinated them because they read the same scriptures has God already revealed who's going in the Rapture I remember years years ago he was an architect that I I dealt with that actually made the plans up for the shop um years ago so you know how long ago that was and uh I remember him telling me so confidently that the Lord had revealed to him that he was going into the Rapture and it wasn't just well I really think no it was sure amen and um he was going to be alive until the Rapture took place but he he passed away quite a long time ago and so there's this thing of people feeling that they're Chosen and predestinated and that they're going to be here for the Rapture brother Bram said in the message the Rapture he says but to the church the bride now he calls the church the bride here to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her it's a revelation to her amen that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture right she's waiting for the revelation of the Rapture now it is a revelation for the Revelation is Faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation so the true bride is waiting for the revelation of the Rapture or the faith to be raptured or what brother Rand called rapturing Faith are you with me all right one thing to help you if you're tired is say Amen to every word of God Amen the Rapture is actually the changing of our bodies our bodies change and this poses another question to me how do I know my body is going to be changed how do I know that brother brandom ask eight questions in a row in the message recognizing your day in its message he said and the Gentiles are called out the bride is ready the Rapture is at hand he says but can we realize that can we actually believe that is it a story that's been told is it a myth to us is it something that sounds real is it something that we that we outside can believe or is it something on the inside is it a part of us that it's more than life to us he said What attitude do we set in this morning in this Tabernacle amen amen he said remember it's a small flock that receives it right so how do I know that I'm really chosen that God has really chosen me is it because I've been called the Bible says this if he's called you but many are called few are chosen so I can't go by The Calling I can say I'm chosen all day long but does that mean I'm chosen how do I know I'm chosen if all I have to do is claim it then all the other churches denominations Independents they're in right all you got to do is claim it amen all I have to do is believe it then all the people they that say they believe it are in so I think this is a real good question how do I know I'm chosen it's not just saying we believe people people need to search the scriptures to see that if what they're believing is is what the chosen believe amen that's absolutely the truth you got to search the scriptures many will come to me in that day and say Lord Lord didn't I do this and didn't I do that and didn't I speak in tongues and didn't I cast out devils and didn't you use me in a mighty way I had this this feeling inside of me that I was chosen I had this peace about it many will come to me in that day how do I know I am not one of them that come to him in that last day it's awful quiet here now I'm not pointing any fingers this is all pointing at me but I think it's a good question for all of us to my humble opinion the only way we can be sure is by non-stop walking in the light that God gives us right amen that is the only way that you even have a chance you've got to walk in the light as he shows you you can't say well I don't need that the most important thing I did was get baptized that is not good we're talking about bride there's a difference between the bride and those who go through tribul a we need to be pressing in we need to be adding and adding God's divine nature to our character we need to be growing because if our bodies are going to change something has to change first and that's our nature and that happens here that happens right now through fre more agency we must possess an attitude of hungering and thirsting for all of God's word nothing short of it will work if you remember when brother Brandon came back from the curtain of time what were the last words they were saying to him as he was go leaving keep pressing on well there's a difference between just hanging in there and pressing on pressing in is you have a purpose to become something that you're not and that's why I believe Paul had that attitude he keep pressing towards the mark amen it just it just lines up with the word now the devil's always trying to keep us from pressing in brother brandham said in the message modern events are made clear by prophecy he says you see you get to the place each one of you get starchy gets off amen and they can't receive new revelation right you mean I just can't come sit down in church anytime I want to and receive a revelation listen if you're not prepared if your heart's not right you you don't want to be starchy that's why I'm saying say Amen to the word amen get get into the word and enter in because as you say Amen all of a sudden you begin to change you begin to feel different right amen amen Satan has deceived so many people from getting away from God God's word amen want to talk about Lucifer for just a moment so you can see what how things are going on Lucifer's ultimate goal was to exalt himself his throne his kingdom above the stars of God that's what the Bible tells us in one way he's achieved that in one way he has achieved that and in another way he cannot achieve it in the one way he has he took a third of the angels that were in heaven and he has more souls in his kingdom than God does I don't 70 80 90 I just say it's a lot more I want you to think about Satan has more souls in his kingdom than God does okay praise God we got we got some that believe that statement I'm going to prove it through the scriptures God said to Eve because you've chosen a different headship I will greatly multiply thy sorrow in thy conception amen okay that's pregnancy now God didn't say I'll increase it by 0.1 or 0.25 or or by two I won't double it he he said I will greatly multiply it that means there's going to be a lot more children are you with me Jesus said wide is the gate and Broad is the way that lead to destruction and many there be which go in there at because straight is the gate Narrows the way that lead to life and few there be that find it many is a large number few is a very small number that's why Paul said I had to become all things to a large number that I might win a few it's just it's it's a it's a numbers game but you see the major majority of the people that we talk to are going to hell when they asked Jesus in Luke 13:23 Lord are there few that be saved he answered said strive to enter into the Straight Gate for I say unto you for uh for many I say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able right not be able amen it is the truth that sets us free it's the truth that puts us in position with him amen truth is so important this is why we should always pray for the ministry and pray that we have a heart to receive all the truth because man shall live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God right amen now in one sense because Satan's kingdom is greatly multiplied with many more souls above numbers but we must must remember that his kingdom has an end so that these souls are going to be no more think about that's what's sad that's why we need a burden for souls he cannot live forever one day there's going to be no more it's a paradox Satan thinks he's destroying the seed of God through the self-willed birth he really thinks he's destroying the seed of God and as we know the natural birth is unacceptable to God that's why a man must be born again amen and God's seed will become Born Again by the will of God to live by God's word to obey God's word to be conformed not to this world but to be transformed into the image of Jesus Christ we've been predestinated that into eternity the Bible says we have received the bride of Christ I believe has received a kingdom that cannot be moved amen but Satan's kingdom will be moved right and that's why anything that isn't built on the word of God is going to be shaken amen so when it comes to Satan's seed there's nothing there to Quicken brother brandham said amen so that's why you can keep giving some ofbody the word the word the word the word and nothing happens right so many people hear the gospel and their nature never changes right amen that's why it really takes more striving to enter in than what the devil tells people more pressing in than what the devil preaches more than just a a lukewarm walk to overcome and to please God than what the devil Whispers in people's ears so how do I know I'm chosen how how do we know that God has chosen you how do we know that God has chosen us amen now 2 Timothy 2:19 says nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure having this seal that the Lord knoweth them that are his yes and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity isn't that funny I I what a terrible thing to say after you're saying the scripture isn't that funny but you know that's not what I meant what I meant isn't it odd the Lord knoweth them that are his why didn't he just say hey so just relax I know I know who belongs to me so just relax he didn't say that he says I got a message for my own right for my seed I got a messag amen that we need to get out of knowing to do the right thing and choosing not to do it we got to get out of that we got to come out of that attitude amen and enter into obedience amen the Lord knoweth them that are his he said my sheep know my voice and what do they do follow the word depart from iniquity follow him they come with ears of I got to hear what his voice is speaking to me right you know too many people got this mentality they're going to come to church learn about God and feel closer to God we got to become God amen amen that's right Messiah it's it's the truth amen God is choosing those who are departing from iniquity that's what the Bible is saying here so we need to be serious about the word we need to take uh the word to our heart more seriously we need to fear God you know I think what's missing a lot in this age brother brother Bruce is talking about how things are shaking up shaking up in the world they say hate has risen 388 per against Israel since this war started no since I'll say it like this since that Israel was attacked and and they're faulting Israel for not getting into that but they're faltering Israel for standing up for themselves so hate is risen against Israel 388 per. that's what they said some have some of you seen that okay now what else is risen hate against blacks Spanish against everybody hate is on a rise right and Jesus told us it's going to happen we're living in a dangerous hour that we need to take God's word and get it in their heart I I believe the bride of Christ is the only one that's not going to be so affected by all these other things in the world and she's going to focus on the word she's going to keep her eyes on the author and the finisher of her faith and she will become what work was started inside her 1 Peter chap 4:1 17 says the time is come that judgment must begin right here right here begin at the house of the Lord and if it first began with us what shall be the end of them which obey not the gospel right so this is a real serious thing when we come here we're not just listening to brother John's opinions about The Bible amen God's word's going forth amen and and and we we receive that word we we take that word and we judge our life with it we find out where we're standing with God and if the righteous scarcely be saved woo tell the devil that one time when he says oh you're okay you're okay give them the scripture right here the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and The Sinner appear now that word scarcely means with difficulty the righteous with great difficulty with much work are saved so the bride is not floating into her place in Christ just because she's in the message come on the Bible says wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit themselves to the commit the keeping of their souls to him and wello as unto a faithful Creator so this difficulty that we're going through when we come to the house of the Lord and we hear you should stop smoking that hurts if we're smoking if we here you should pay your tie that hurts if we're not paying our tithes amen if we say we should lay down our life for one another it hurts if we're not laying down our life for one another amen but you're suffering for well doing you're committing your soul unto him who's a faithful he's a faithful Creator he created your soul he will keep your soul amen but we've got to come under subjection to the word right now the bride allows the word to judge her brother B say that's why she comes to the house of the Lord find out where she's at with God she'll be hum she'll be contrite and she'll recognize the headship of the word she'll recognize it because Jesus is not going to lead you to go do your own will but we've all experienced that Satan Satan's not going to come to you and say hey this is me Satan I want you to go do this he comes to you and says I'm God I want you to go do this right that's how he got me he ever get you you like that man let's just be honest be a home be a family he's a [Applause] liar you can know him because it doesn't line up with the word right amen now you would think that God would choose a religious spirit to be his bride because it's religious and it's you know people you know have you ever been told well you you're religious aren't you anybody ever said that to you oh you you must be religious you believe in God and you would think that God would choose a religious spirit to be his bride but a religious spirit is Antichrist the Bible says the two spirits in the last days would be so close Jesus said that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible in other words the elect are the only ones that can see the difference the other one can't see it they say they see it they see they understand they think they're right but they don't see it I'm going to tell you a religious spirit will not take correction it has no headship that's why it doesn't take correction it judges others but it will not judge itself it only uses the word as a cloak or a covering for their own lives other words they G to pick and choose what they're going to use the word for and you know how Jesus said remember Lot's wife well let's remember the Pharisees for a minute they knew how to act all high is good self-righteous in front of others but it wasn't genuine it was only a show and God isn't interested in how religious we could be or how we can put on a show he is interested in a genuine humility a genuine contrite spirit that's what he's looking for and that happens outside of people come on we need to love the word whether it's fun or not so how do I know God's chosen me we need to be sure we need to make sure can you can you be can you make sure that you are is that can I can I find out can I be sure because look we're all standing here think we're the bride right none of us are going to say no I'm not the bride why would you ask me such a thing we believe we're the bride how do I know second Peter 1:10 says wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election a sure thing right for if you do these things you shall never fall why what are those things what are those things he's talking about well you go back in earlier in the chapter this is only verse 10 but earlier in the chapter he's talking about God's divine nature amen and that we have the promises of God's word given to us that we might obtain God's precious or God's divine nature through these promises right now he tells us to add to our faith this thing that we say yes I am I am add to that add what these virtues are the divine nature of Christ it isn't us it isn't what we were born with it isn't what we went to college for it's it comes from God Amen and and we've got to keep adding and if we keep adding we keep doing these things we're not going to fall we're not right because you're always pressing in you're always uh adding to it's when you you think I got enough see that Spirit of Leo DEA keeps us from pressing in we think well I came to church what else you want me to do I don't want you to do anything but the Holy Ghost wants you to become him amen that's what that's what's going on so we need to give diligence amen that means use speed make effort be Earnest labor study ende it means work right verse 11 for so in entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in entrance shall be ministered unto you so you come to church and you hear the word being ministered right that word is showing you how to get in amen too often we got to attit well I don't need that well if it's the entrance you need it now of course of course if I speak my mind my words my opinion you don't need that and you should never take it but if it's God's word you don't sit there and say well I don't know if that's the way I view it it's not about the word or the preaching suiting you amen it's about coming to church humbly and saying I know my life isn't right I know I'm not in His image I know I'm not hungering and thirsting for God like I should so therefore I'm going to bring myself under subjection to the word all right verse 12 wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things always put you in remembrance of these things well you talk about going to church and hearing the same thing over and over praise God though you know them and be established them you I'm still going to preach them yay I think it meet as long as I am in this Tabernacle to Stir Up Stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly I must put off my off this my Tabernacle even as the Lord Jesus Christ have shown me moreover I Endeavor that ye may be able after my decease after I'm gone that you have these things always in remembrance what things is Paul talking about to keep [Applause] adding the nature of God to your character don't stop for anything give diligence make sure that you're continually adding your your your your whole goal is not just to make it to church twice a week come on coming to church don't give you the divine nature of God if it did we'd have a lot of goats sitting here today who's been in our barn anyways a lot of chickens a lot of plants going to the greenhouse you're not a plant because you walk into the greenhouse we're not a Christian because we walk in we don't got God's divine nature because we walk in there we come in here to hear from God and say God I'll take your word into my heart and I will live this word amen am serious about that that's what we need more Amen brother Braham said the only thing that we're taking with us when we leave is our character amen we've got to add God's divine nature to our character now Leo is sitting around in need of nothing can you say Amen they're they feel they're already chosen they're already going in a Rapture they're not sitting there in their churches taking you know we you know we're the foolish virgin they don't think like that we think like that but they don't think like that they think they're going in a Rapture they think they're chosen while she's going to church for every other reason than to get dressed in the word the invisible the bride is having an invisible Union with the word of God the Bride Comes to church because she knows that the she must become the word amen that's it I know we got other needs I know we have other desires and we have other requests and there's nothing wrong with it but we must become the word or else we're not going into Rapture what if we have everything that we could possibly want in this life with God money riches friends popularity every need met physically healthy one day you'll die and you still doesn't mean you're going to go on a rapture we must become the word amen and and it takes more than just saying well brother John it just sounds like you're just lacking a little faith I know I'm bride I believe there's more people that believe that they're chosen than they're not than there are chosen because look if my daughter an said to me dad you don't have to get the garbage out of the garage I already got got it for you well if I believe her I'm not going to go to the G garage and get the garbage and if the devil tells me I'm already chosen there's no need for me to be diligent about making sure of my calling you understand so there's voices that speak to us and we got to call them out when they don't line up with the word you got to say get behind me devil I'm pressing into this word amen now Church natural believes that she's chosen she has just enough conviction to try a little bit but God's testimony of her is that she's lukewarm and he said I'll spew thee out of my mouth but God's chosen bride isn't too proud to give diligence to make sure she don't worry about who's looking at her she already knows she's nothing without Christ amen She's continually adding his divine nature to his to her character she's continuing to manifest more and more of the word because that's on her heart that's why she comes to church she realizes that she can't make a Rapture without being in His image because that's what we've been predestinated to and it ain't going to happen at the last moment it will for your body but not your nature your Nature has changed now if that a't ain't true than everybody's going everybody's body is being changed your Nature has to be changed now you've got to be serious about having God's nature manifest in your life right brother brandom said in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says the bride has to be the word not agree with it has to be it in other words you can't tell the difference between the two the bride has to be the word for he is the word right amen she cannot stand on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word because she's a part of it amen she was taken from Christ from the sight of Christ yes and to be sure that the whole Rapture now Luther was aart Wesley was aart the prophets was aart just in the Revelation that they were making up the body the feet the toes the arms and so forth until the head which would get to in a few minutes she see that makes the entire Rapture it's the body of the word it's the body of the word which is Christ amen outside of that he said you're lost he said outside of that you're lost I don't care how good you are I and he says or what your relationship is boy when I read that I just went like this because that's serious business amen I don't care how good you are or what your relationship is or what your fellowship is or what your church is you're lost outside of that word being in you yes and that word comes in by one Spirit by the spirit now we can receive the knowledge of the word and I don't need God's spirit for that I can sit in the room and learn all day about God Amen up here but the spirit of the word can only come in here by the by the word of the spirit can only come in by the spirit in other words it bypasses this faculty of knowledge and understanding and got to figure it out it's the love for the word when you love the word then the spirit of the word comes in right but you can study the word without the love of the word dos and don'ts and you never receive that into your heart I hope you're with me you understand what I'm saying now there were 10 virgins they all live good clean lives we're told they dressed proper they went to church they tried to help others they were Justified and they were Sanctified can you say amen Amen brother randam tght us that was a portion of the Holy Ghost is being justified being Sanctified so they had oil when they started now five of them took oil with them I'll say enough for justification and sanctification because they could not have lived good clean lives without being Sanctified the problem was that they didn't take enough of the oil to bring forth the divine nature of Christ are this if you you we just got to get this Revelation they had enough oil they all all their lamps were lit when they started five did not take oil those five already started with the oil they were Justified they were Sanctified you could not tell the two between in as far as living good clean lives but they didn't think they needed to get any more and that's the downfall don't listen to the devil that tells you that you may not like me because I preach you need more but it is from God you and if you don't believe it you'll see it one day these these virgins brother uh Jesus called them foolish because they would not believe his word and I believe his word told them you need to get more oil but they said I have enough I don't need to go to the altar I don't need to seek God I can do it at home do you do it at home if you did at home you do it here now the other five well they went on to get more of the Holy Ghost I think that's who God's coming for don't you I think that's who God's choosing he's not looking for just justification and sanctification he's not going to be married to just that would okay look all of you want to be I'm not getting about to get where I want to get to which is the good stuff I'm just going to say this every one of you want to be married to somebody that loves you how many people are Justified and Sanctified they clean up their lives because they have to they got to do this or they're going to get in trouble but they're not in love with the word God is looking for someone who's in love with him which is the word amen you can't separate God and the word you can't separate Christ in the Christ in the Bible they're they're one in the beginning was the word the word with God and the Word was God we have got to love that word and that word it hurts it cuts it feels bad but that's only to the flesh it isn't to the soul amen but God has not redeemed your body your body is going to die that's why brother Bruce we're getting older but that Soul has got another body waiting am yes thank the Lord amen now Peter was chosen by God we know that one day Jesus called to him and said come and I'll make you Fishers of Fishers of Men Peter had a choice to make was he just going to tag along or was he going to get serious about his calling right amen was he just going to be satisfied that he was a disciple or was he going to follow Jesus unto the Regeneration the new birth remember that's what Jesus told him to do right was he going to be content just thinking that he was converted or was he going to get converted I imagine that set Peter back when he when when Jesus told him he says Hey when you're ConEd converted strengthen your brethren what do you mean converted I already told you I'm sold out but I tell you what when you get converted you're not living for yourself anymore you're actually helping other Sheep amen you're loving other sheep you're laying your life down why why why why why aren't you concerned about yourself anymore because God's already taken care of you you are content with what you have amen and now your life has been given to God and God Gets In Your Vessel you know what he does he doesn't say oh it's all about you it's all about you it's all about you no it ain't about you right it's about others Paul had to give up everything he was in love with the souls of others and I it was the love of God in Paul you believe that Peter said we have to keep receiving more the divine nature of God giving all diligence add to your existing Faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance Faith patience godliness godliness brother kindness brother kindness CH keep adding keep adding and be mindful is it is it happening do I see it thank you thank you let's we got to wake up to the word this word has to become real to we got to receive it we've got to receive it we can't just say oh we agree with this brother John I don't want you to agree with it I want it to become part of your life amen B said in the message the identified Christ of all ages he says now we find out that our Pentecostal Brethren are living in the glare of a Pentecostal age and they still miss it they're trying to interpret the Pentecostal message when they're Plumb past that when we're PM past that we're living up to the rapturing time for the coming of the end time I say there's a lot of people that are just in the glare of I'm in the messag try and interpret the message just like the pentecostalist did instead of receiving the message which is manifesting what that message actually spoke right it's a two totally different subjects one is yes I've received the message but the other has the message received you it's one thing to say I'm in the message but it's another thing to say the message is in me Saul was a chosen vessel and God had to kick him off his high horse right amen it was at that time Paul had to make a choice was he going to give up everything and be led by God I'll tell you what it took he had an he had so much pride some of us have too much pride yes to come to the Altar and say Lord have I been wrong have I been just trying to get by on what I already have come on alter is in our heart I'm not necessarily meaning this but there's a alter in our heart this is where things have to take place amen Paul never stop pressing in for more of the Holy Ghost because the true Holy Ghost keeps leading us to more of Christ when he the spirit of Truth come he will lead and guide you into all truth it isn't just oh the message is the truth okay I'm done no it now wants us to start living all of it right and it it and it only happens scarcely I it it happens with hard work it it takes a a lot of energy it takes I I I need more than what I have it can't be well you got to convince me you got to make me feel like I want you know what you're telling me I'm not a Salesman I'm not one to make you feel like you you need this I'm I'm just confessing I'm just delivering the word the word's the word I I do it out of love there's no doubt about that but I can't make you feel like doing the word because if I could the devil will come by a week later and get you to stop doing it right but if you receive the revelation of the word nothing can keep you from following the word nothing oh my how much time do you got today but I'm I'm only half done all right Philippi of Philippines Philippians Philippians chapter 3 I want you to read these scriptures with me because this is like Paul's after 33 years Paul he doesn't say I I don't need to go to the altar anymore I don't need to press in anymore verse 12 says not as though I've already attained or or either either were're already perfect but I follow after I'm still following I'm not saying you know I'm there I'm still following after if I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Jesus Christ he knew that God got a hold of his life but something inside of him wanted to get a hold of God's life Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do of forgetting those things which are behind me that's not just the bad things but those are the good things and reaching forth to those things which are before me I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many be perfect be thus minded and if in anything ye be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you I say if you are God's chosen bride God will reveal to you what you need to press into believe that with all my heart nevertheless we're in two we have already attained now there's things that we have already attained if you've already been baptized in the correct name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you don't you you don't need to do that again you've already attained to that but let us walk by the same rule let us have the same let us mind the same thing in other words there's still more for us to do even though we've been baptized come on Amen Brethren be ye followers together of me and mark them which walk so as you have us for an example thank God that Jesus Christ left us an example in Paul I have something to follow because you don't know how many people try to tell me something they were off the word come on can you imagine following somebody that's off the word what's going to happen to you the blind lead the blind they both fall in the ditch amen we have Paul for an example stay with it amen that's who brother brandham followed he said I preached what Paul preached right and he said we're all resting on that we're all resting on that all right look at this verse 18 for many walk not some not few for many walk of whom I've told you often and now tell you even weeping there was a heart here in Paul weeping that they are the enemies of the Cross of Christ W how do we know how do we know look it this is how we know know whose end is destruction whose God is their belly and whose glory is their shame and let's just wrap this all up who mine Earthly things their mind is down here their mind is not up here amen feeding themselves with this they're enemies of the Cross because the cross came not just to save God isn't going to have a bride that's just saved they're going to look at Jesus Christ as Lord and God demands that so much that every knee all of those Souls that go into Satan's kingdom are going to Bow their knee one day and they're going to confess with their mouth one day who is the real Lord amen right so I know it's in the heart of God that his bride has this relationship in which he's Lord in other words he's the the real head of their life the word is the real headship not just save me and give me everything I want but you are my everything verse uh 20 for our conversation is in heaven from once we look for for our savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself all right I love that there's the Rapture the changing of our Brethren of our bodies I mean now we need to give diligence keep seeking to possess more of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is what will manifest more of God and our nature amen nothing else would do it you cannot train yourself to to to be like God now God is choosing how do I know I'm chosen God is choosing a bride who possesses the very same nature the very same love that he has not a feeling of love not an emotion not works of righteousness not knowledge not understanding he's looking for the same love inside his bride that he has towards her do you believe that say Amen because we got a lot of we got a lot of more hay in the fork yet as brother John le fontain would say St John chapter 15 ver2 when we opened up with verse 16 but I want to turn to verse 12 Jesus said now this is you you'll notice he starts here and he says this is my commandment and he says it at the end in verse 17 so let's capture this whole thing this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you right now here's the thing if I brother Ryan you know you're close I just you know if I love brother Ron because he you know he gives me his tie when I want it and um he takes me out to dinner and um he brings me double stuff Orioles and I have my reasons for loving him oh Bo I I can just I I'm gonna just do this great thing for brother Ron because I love him and the Bible says I got to love him but if he steps on my toe puts a knife in my back does something behind me to hurt me to kill my influence and I still don't love him the very same and I'm not loving him the way that Christ loved me right so this is not a commandment of we need to try to love one another more this is we need to get God's love in Us in order to love in order to obey that commandment and he says here in verse 13 Greater Love have no man than this than a man laid down his life for his friends amen and you are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you Amen in other words you don't do what God asked you to do no friendship that's what he said henceforth I call you not servants but uh for servants know uh knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you you have not chosen me you didn't have nothing to do with it but I have chosen you and I've ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit that your fruit should remain and that whatsoever you shall ask in my in the father's name in ask of the father in my name he may give it to you these things I command you comma that ye love one another amen do you see that he has chosen you and ordained you to bring forth a fruit of loving the way he loves yes so forget about saying I'm predestined I'm chosen I'm elected start looking at your life and say how can I love the way he loves Lord fill me with more of you because until we get there everything else is a smoke screen and it don't mean anything it's a distraction to the real it's a distraction to the real we need the love of God so strong that whatever is put before us we can handle it Jesus is expressing that this is his love it's not our love for God it's his love inside of us our love is selfish right amen wrong motives respect to persons but God's love it's without respect to persons the bride is the only group that's been ordained to love the way that God's love right think about that everybody else's love is less wow she's the only one that's been ordained to go forth and bring forth the fruit of God's love everybody else stop short Jesus said a new commandment I give you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one for another right all men that means your enemies yes the people who hate you the people accuse you the people who say you know what I don't think this of you somehow God wants to get inside of you and manifest his love amen now what is God looking for in his bride he's looking for character more specific his character his nature his love his will his word brother Bram said it's the only thing that we're taking with us when we leave and he also said only perfect love can enter in there so we can conclude that character must be perfect love right okay what is that it's power to lay down our life right yes for those we think are worthy and for those that we think are unworthy that's correct power to lay down our lives for those that we think are good and for those that we think are not good for those who we love and for those who despitefully use us for those who bless us and for those who curse us we have power to lay down our life for both we don't sit there and say well I'm having a hard time with this person when you have God's love you don't have a hard time amen when you have your when you have your love you have a hard time we know power without character is what Satan satanic so let's it what does that really mean this is the John Martin version here free more agency to choose without submission to God's word is satanic because that's the very nature we were born with to do our will amen the nature we were born with now brother brand said in the message going through some quick quotes here at the end brother brand says I've been more determined to do everything I can to persuade men and women please be sure of this now he's talking about when he got back from the curtain of time he says I've been more determined to do everything that I can to persuade men and women he says please be sure of this colon if God's love doesn't anchor in your heart supremely don't you take any sensation or motion right you be sure that you can turn the other cheek that Christ is all and all in you he said don't miss it my brother he says just remember I'll say this with Faith that I had in that Vision whatever it was I speak it in the name of the Lord except you have that perfect love you'll never be there cuz nothing could ever be there without it he says your spirit would be out of place there it couldn't come there you ever be you ever were were you ever around a spirit you felt uncomfortable with do you think God wants to have a spirit outside of perfect love in heaven we need to be serious about this not not just say well I feel like I got it I I I try to have it no brother bam said lay everything else you got going in your life lay it aside go after it get it be serious because if your heart hungers for it God will give it to you you knock you seek God will give you the love of God is shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Ghost when you seek the Holy Ghost you're getting the love of God Amen that's why people are so deceived they think well I've got the Holy Ghost oh my look you don't ever have to tell anybody you got the Holy Ghost you're a written epistle read of all men somebody that's been trained in the The Gospel they know whether it's the right Spirit or not amen he said your spirit would be out of place there it couldn't come there there'd be no way for it to come no more than it would be for a grain of corn to rise up out of the ground without a germ of life in it no matter how natural it would look it could not rise my friend you old people you young people you don't know what time you're going to leave here we don't know that but let me persuade you as a Christian brother that loves you except you're born again and the spirit of God of love and I so glad he put it like that the spirit of God of love comes into your heart you'll certainly miss that place amen it's word brother Braham said accepting God's provided way at the end time he said I is not seen ear is not heard quoting the scripture neither is it entered to the heart of men what God has for them in store that love him yes oh just to look past the curtain of time then I've tried harder than ever before in my life to try to win people to Christ since then he says you can't afford to miss it don't do it be sure you're right with God and and other things will be all right look we got enough we have we all have enough sin garbage things that have happened in our life that we're not proud of to certainly miss it on some sort of Merit so forget about how good we are right or we're a little bit better than soand so what we need is just to Humble ourselves and say God I know what I need is more Holy Ghost right amen amen in the message leadership brother B says you're either for God or against God and the outward expression shows what's on the inside now it doesn't always show it right because you a teabag is is revealed when it's in hot water so it's when you're going through trials that show what's on the inside it's when you go through trials that shows what's really on the Inside Yes amen okay many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm going to heaven he said that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven he said no sir now he said this in December of 65 so it wasn't like he lived 10 more years after this this this is after the culmination of his whole understanding and and Ministry and with the things that God had revealed to him right here at the end many of you think I've got the baptism of Holy Ghost and I'm going to heaven but that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven so how do I know I'm chosen you can only have he says you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell how is that how is that because we're a Triune being we can feel the Holy Spirit on the outside and it feels good it does we can have the the Holy Spirit on that inner realm and and cry crocodile tears and feel the emotion of God's presence that doesn't mean it's hit the inside of the inside because the inside of the inside is where your nature is generated from all right I'm going to just wanted to say that before I read this look here you are an outside person you have five senses that contact the outside of your body God gave you five senses not to I love this not to contact him you know Thomas wanted to see it right not to contact him but your Earthly home to contact one another right see taste feel smell and hear right then you have a spirit on the inside of that and it has five Outlets conscious and love and so forth five outlets and that contact the spirit world with that but with your spirit your physical contacts physical your spirit contacts spiritual but inside of that you've got a soul yes and that soul is that Gene that came from God yes amen now here's the thing if you believe that you are that Gene of God then why is it so hard for you to battle giving your life more to the word and saying God I got to become that word if you're the gene of God you will want to be that word you will want to give up the things of this world you will get serious with the word amen true I love love this message I'd be lost without this message this message was sent to get us ready amen he says and he's he's going on next verse or next paragraph here he says and like a baby formed in a mother's womb when the baby comes into the mother's wom by a little germ it crawls into the egg and it doesn't form one cell a human and then a next a dog and then a next a cat and then next a horse it's all human cells because it's building off the ariginal human cell it's building it's adding add to your faith virtue amen it's a it's a continually building you because you've been predestinated to be predestinated to come into the image of Jesus Christ it's a constant building and when a man has been born again by the word of God predestinated to eternal life called the elected yes it will be word of God on top of word word on word not a church Creed and then word and then Creed it won't work it can't have that leaven in it only one eternal life that's Jesus Christ the word yes he got to get rid of our thinking amen get rid of our ideas and get serious about God I have a hunger for this word I have a hunger to become this word it don't happen over time people have been in this message for I don't know how many years and then they leave the message right it ain't about coming to church and being faithful and that's it to me being faithful is the foundation if you can't be faithful you ain't going anywhere with God but you've got to do more than just come to church you've got to receive the word amen when you receive it you become it Jesus said if a man love me he will keep my words if a man loveed me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our bold there I just I don't got time I'm sorry that it's this late but in Deuteronomy I believe it's chapter 7 Jesus said or God said I've have not chosen you because you were the greatest among all the people on the planet the greatest he said no you were the fewest he says I chose you because I love you right that's why he chose us amen now here he said if now don't you think he's going to choose a bride that loves him the same amen can you imagine being married to somebody you believe in giving but your spouse believes no I don't I don't think we should give I think we should only give to those who we want to give to can you imagine we're married to Jesus and we say no I I don't think you should be that nice to that person over there I don't I I don't I never got along with them on the planet you think he wants to be married to that no no he wants to be married to someone that looks up to him and says I'm just like you I think like you I believe like you I love like you I serve like you I give like you that's who he he wants to marry he wants to marry someone that's just like him amen it does not appear but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now I'll tell you if we we love God this is what he says if a man love me he will keep my word amen and my father will love him and we will come onto him and make our abold right how many people are claiming God's with me God's with me you look at their life and they're not subject to the word it doesn't matter what we claim it's about letting the word come and dictate to you what the elect will really be submit yourself to the word right we don't have time to read it but I'm just going to share it with you read Romans 8 chapter chapter 8: 33-39 if you've got God's love in your heart nothing can separate you from it amen but if you just got your love in your heart for God you'll be separated right but God's love nothing can separate you when you have God's love inside your heart am brother Bri s the message Elijah he saysi a poor preacher I don't know how to carry a subject but I know one thing I love God I know that with all my heart and tonight brother I couldn't help it if he'd condemned me at the end of the road and say William brandom you go to hell and I'd go down there into the pits of hell if there is such a thing as love there I would love him there and he says I couldn't help it what is he saying that there's something inside of him that's controlling he's first yes I love him my allegiance is to the word of God not to a church not to a Creed not to money not to popular not to what I can get out of life but my allegiance he's I I can't preach I'm not worthy but I'd love him there amen you tell me what's important you tell me what's important all the things that we think are important to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might that's what's important amen that's what he's calling us to my last quote can you say Amen praise the Lord Brother John in questions and answers brother Brandon says but I don't deserve the Lord because I you know he's I don't deserve the Lord because I think he'd send me to hell if I didn't I'm sorry I am so sorry he says but I don't serve the Lord because I think he'd send me the hell if I didn't I serve him because I love him I serve him because there's something in me if you go out and say well I have to quit doing this and and because my church don't believe in it he says you're just playing the part of a hypocrite he said that's right but if you do it because you that you love to and it's a contribution to God and something that's in your heart making now look at this something in your heart making the love of God so great greater to you than these things now you're on the right line see it has to be the love of God inside of you but if I didn't drink and smoke and chew and cuss and do these things I'd still go to hell sure i' join all the churches was baptized and had my name on all the books and played a good part and lived a good life he quotes except a man be born again he can't even see the kingdom of God let's Stand Together the bride's nature will change into the nature of God it has to we have to not just be where we're at we can't just be where we're at we got to go higher go higher God is calling us higher and I believe by this shall all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for another amen praise the Lord I Want to Love You More brother John I already feel you love me I want to love you more all you have to do is cross me and then we're going to see if I love you enough amen right because they did everything they pulled his beard they did everything to him but you know what he still went and laid down his life for you and I I'm not afraid of what people will do to me I'm afraid if I don't got the Holy Ghost I'm afraid if I don't got the love of God in my heart that's what I'm afraid of Amen I need to
