force we need to we need to take what belongs to us amen amen well if we could just be seated just for a moment and I I hate to do that because you just stood but I wanted to give a little mission

brother give greetings to all the saints with uh you we're remembering you all in our prayers every day amen so praise the Lord for the work that they're they're doing there in India is that's a good report isn't it amen amen well let's let's pray for them let's pray for them that's a that's definitely a heathen Nation with uh many many distractions there but God can get the word to his seed amen amen I believe that all right let's stand for the reading of the word of God one just one more time unless you want to stand for the whole service amen we're going to turn in our book uh the Bible to the Genesis chapter 22 and then also Romans chapter 6 um we want to entitle the message today yielding ourselves yielding ourselves and as I was walking um by the Sunday school I heard uh the Sunday school teacher uh just say one thing when I was walking by just happened to be when I was walking by she said when we yield ourselves to God then he can do something with our lives so I thought if I was going to hear anything that would be a good one to hear amen let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer our heavenly father Lord we're about to read your word but we are not sufficient in oursel to know the revelation of it we need you we need you Lord even when the truth is spoken we need the revealer inside of us to open it to us to make it uh to to feed our souls Lord as only you can we're just instruments we're all instruments here we ask that you would take control of this little room here and of every spirit that You' collect us of any wrong any negativity that you would come and fill our hearts with faith and that your Holy Spirit would take control now Lord would you bless our ears to hear would you bless these lips Lord that they speak according to the words that you'd have to be spoken and Lord come and build your church Lord build your church as you said that you promised upon this Rock I will build my church Lord we're depending upon you to bring the Revelation to us we commit the service and ask your blessings now on these scriptures in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen amen Genesis chapter 22 starting with verse number 15 and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn sayeth the Lord for because thou has done this thing and is not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and multiply and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice voice amen then one scripture in Romans chap 6 Romans chap 6 verse number 16 know ye not that the whom you yield yourselves servants to obey his servant ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness amen God bless you you may be seated for a subject we want to take possessing the Gate of the enemy and when we look at this title yielding ourselves to God while possessing the Gate of the enemy can kind of seem like two different subjects so if I'm going to yield myself to this song or listen to the words and and get into it is one thing but to go ahead and possess something in fact it would be actually something that the enemy is using which take a lot of effort to do it seems like this like two different things being done at the same time but in reality when we yield ourselves to God we are promised the possession of the Gate of our enemy word possession when we have possession of something that means we have control of it amen and whosoever has possession of a Gateway or a a canal can control what passes through and we got uh certain natural canals the Baltic canals the Suez Canal the Panama canal canal and these are are important uh gateways for shipments to to to pass through and uh our minds are like gateways where information passes through them amen and sometimes when the wrong information passes through we know that the enemy Is possessing that gate for that moment because God would never allow the wrong thing to pass through into our minds Paul said in Philippians 4 finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever Things Are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure and lovely and of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things when God is in control of the gate only the right things pass through and he said these things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me and do and the God of Peace shall be with you right so when we let the wrong things come through we can get all full of anxiety but not when you let let the write things through so we see that these Gates can be possessed or in control by the enemy Jesus said there were two gates one was straight one was wide God was in control the Straight Gate yes he called it narrow not much room to get through you've seen those long long narrow uh real high walls there ain't much room for a boat to get through there is just one way to get through and Satan he's in control of the wide gate described as very broad lots of room doesn't matter what you think about amen the God of Peace wants us to think on the things these these things that were meant of a good report and pure and lovely and holy we might look at that scripture and say well that's pretty straight that's pretty narrow you can't think about you know other things than that but you notice it leads to peace it leads to life it leads to the right direction but Satan just wants you to think about anything look at any news and just get involved in any old kind of thought that comes into your head just Broadway of thinking now Abraham's seed was promised possession of the gates of their enemy and I'll say it like this it's a spiritual seed the spiritual Seed of Abraham is Promised the possession of the Gate of the enemy the natural seed was absolutely afraid of their enemy because the Giants were in control amen they were too afraid to enter in into the promised land because their enemy controlled the gates it took a spiritual seed of God which was led by Joshua and Caleb to go into the promised land and those Gates just came down amen now we are the seed of Our Father Abraham by faith the Bible says we've been promised possession of what comes in and what goes out of these Gates the reason we need possession of the enemy's Gates is so we can fully and completely yield ourself to God now there's where your your connection comes in uh it's very difficult to yield to something when something else is trying to distract you remember as a 15-year-old boy and I was taking my driver's license and driving on M59 of course I hadn't had a lot of experience driving and getting to be behind the wheel you know all that is when you were first got your driver's license you all excited and had all these feelings going and you're in control and you just you're free and all these things were going on and this uh driver's ed teacher started polling on me from the seat it's one of those bench seats you know back in the day and I'm just driving and I'm thinking what is she doing but she was seeing if I was going to get distracted or if I had control of the vehicle there's a reason that the police don't want you texting when you're driving because they feel you won't have control they don't want you drinking drunk and driving so I'll say it like this God wants us to have possession of the gates that are inside of us or else we won't be able to yield ourselves completely to God now the Lord doesn't want us involved in the things of the world why we're trying to serve him because they're a distraction 1 John chap 2:1 15 says love not not the world neither the things that are in the world they're a distraction now the world I'm just going to say it like this it's the world nature it's not the world that we not this world not this world it's the world nature that we were born with they that nature is what brought the the the terrible things that are happening in the world and if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world look at this it's the lust of the flesh that's inside of man right and and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life look at me I'm going to do this is not of the father but it's of the world Amen and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of of God he's the one that abides forever amen we know the way that leads to life amen it's straight it's narrow but I'm so glad that I'm not in a place can you imagine being lost in this world and not knowing the way to get to heaven how horrible that would be just to be just wandering and and no no Avenue no way to to to get a hold of God but God made a way for those that truly love him amen now we've got a choice who we want to serve who we want to yield our life to and Paul said know ye not that to whom you yield yourself servants obey his servant you are to whom you obey whether unto sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness so our our body has the ability to yield you made it decision to to yield yourself and come to church you didn't have to nobody made you but you yield yourself to that well all day long we have that same Choice happening inside of our mind with thoughts that come to us now remember the thoughts that come to our mind they're not all from the Lord if I could say it like this the majority are a distraction the majority are a distraction Jesus said in Luke 16:13 no servant can serve two masters for he will either hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon you can't yield to both at one time you just can't it is the devil's job to get us to think that we're serving God no matter what's what what we're doing but people will either despise their flesh or they will despise obeying the word of God Amen it's that that this this all there is to it and and and the devil is is is is is trying to say it it's okay what you do what you think what you say because they deserve it it don't matter don't matter your attitude you know God's still with you you're still silvering God that is you cannot give me scripture for that why would you why would you accept that if you don't call the devil out that means he can stay in the gate now if our greatest enemy is ourself that means the gates that the enemy uses must be present as well brother bam taught us that there are five gates to the body see taste smell hear and feel and it's through these Gates that information enters and we're able to process things we we see things we we see colors we see food and and and we see pictures and we see words and that information now we take it and we process it inside we walk into a room and it it smells it it it it gets our attention right if you're hungry you walk into the kitchen and and you smell some food cooking Bo that smells really good sometimes we walk into a a a a room and uh that that's got chemicals and stuff in it and it doesn't smell good right and our nose takes that information and we we we process it we know we got to get out of here or we can't wait for dinner are you with me now inside of our bodies is a spirit with five gates I know brother Brandon preached this two different ways which one's on the inside but just go with me here because that doesn't matter right this second inside our bodies is our spirit with five gates memory conscious affection imagination and reasoning it is through these Gates these channels these canals that information passes through into the spirit man are you with me and inside our spirit is our soul and brother ROM says that's who you are you want to know who you are you are a soul that's what he said the soul that sinth shall die the Bible says James said Brethren if any of you do Heir from the truth and one converteth him let him know that he which converteth The Sinner from the air of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide on multitude of sin am see there's only one thing that's going to save the body that's a rapture right and and actually that's going to be changed so either way the flesh and blood is not going to inherit you know the kingdom of God the soul only has one gate in which it can enter in and brother Bram said that's by Free Will We Will what's going to go in there brother Bram said there's only one of two things that lies inside the soul and that's either Faith or doubt think about that statement we're here today listening to the word of God and inside of us is either faith in the word or we're questioning things and anytime you question things you will never be able to achieve what only can be achieved by faith I say doubt your doubts believe the word of God it is the devil's desire to have possession of the gates so he can control what information goes through through what what passes through these channels because as he gets as he controls what's going in now he can conform your nature you see why God wants control the gates so he can change your nature into the nature of God especially our soul because brother brandom said our soul is the control tower of our entire life only Faith or doubt can by there and Jesus said you cannot serve two masters it'll be one or the other are you with me this morning the devil wants to control the Gate of her soul brother BR said in the in the message work is Faith expressed he said speaking of the Soul he said that's the guidepost that's the control tower the inside of the inside the soul controls the spirit and the spirit controls the body so it doesn't it isn't how we look out here it's how we look down here it's important what's going on down here it's important to not love God out here when everybody's looking it's important to love God in here when nobody's looking amen the inside of the inside that's what really really counts now when we're born the first time we're born with a self-centered satanic nature can't do nothing about it the Bible says we were children of Wrath when we were born by Nature Amen in other words we yelled we screamed we got mad we got upset we blamed we manipulated others we did what we had to do to get what we wanted because our nature was just selfish right you you could not be a family and and and and have some of your kids if they didn't get what they wanted from you they would go to the you know the spouse the other parent they would do whatever they had to do to get it and we had to bribe them clean your room first do your chores take out the garbage to get them to do something that they should just do because mom or dad asked that's why Jesus said we must be born again or we can't enter the Kingdom of Heaven Colossians 3:8 now Colossians 3:8 they put that up but now ye also put off all these I want to ask today how many of you have put these off not how many you don't like but how many have actually put them off or they're still on put off all these not not one or two of them but all of them anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth why this is this is a we're reading out of the Christian Bible this morning lie not one to another see you put off the old man with his deeds and it put on the new man which is renewed in the knowledge after the image of him that created him so now we're putting off the things of that first satanic selfish nature and we're yielding ourselves to His Image praise the Lord amen now when the enemy has control of our gates I'll just say bad things happen we act abnormal the Bible says unseemingly uncharacteristic of a Believer professing to be Christlike we'll start putting others down we'll start esteeming ourselves instead of others we'll spend more time worrying about our reputation than God's reputation we'll spend more time worrying about our will instead of God's will now these are the bad things that happen when the enemy has possession of the gates when the enemy has control of the gates we can begin uh he can begin to take control of literally our spirit we'll begin to make excuses of why we just can't go the Second Mile why we just can't live for others why we don't feel like turning a cheap for anybody why it's okay not to follow every word of God that proceedeth out of the mouth of God why it's okay to just let the sun go down upon your wrath because that's just the way it seems to be happening every night why it's okay to gossip a little here a little there or to think ill of others because nobody I didn't say it this is when the enemy has control of our gates when he has control he can steal our joy our joy in serving God our joy in serving his people we just don't got time for it no joy when he's got control he can fill our minds with anxiety and fear and turmoil confusion discontentment becoming dissatisfied all the time this is not the Lord Jesus in control of our gates things can go south pretty quickly when the enemy's got control and most of the times that it's happening people don't even realize it that the devil's there because the devil's so good at saying I feel the way I feel because of what they did because of what she did because of what he did because of my circumstances like God is Not greater than our circumstances whatever happened to though he slay me yet why I trust him whatever happened to going down into the lion's den and still trust you whatever happened to going into the fiery furnace and not bowing before the devil there are people who have viewed in themselves to God and continue to yew themselves to God it's a reality Christ in you is greater than the world that's inside that you're born with you believe that amen praise the Lord now both Spirits have the ability to supply thoughts through the gates both Spirits God and the devil now I want to just take one today one gate that's all I'm taking did you know how long this would take to go through all these I want to take one gate and that gate is just memory you can take any of them and the same thing God gave us this gate of memory for good second Peter chapter 1 I just want to share some scriptures if I can second Peter chap 1:12 wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye once know knew uh though you know them and be established in the present truth yeah I think get meat as long as I'm in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly I must put off this my Tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me moreover I will endeavor that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance isn't that wonderful our memory that God gave us was for good it's so his word could remain in our mind at all times amen all times 1 Corinthians chapter 15 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse1 moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also you have received wherein you stand by which all so you're saved man that that just just it's it's great by which you are saved if if if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless you believed in vain if you don't keep the word of God in your memory what good would it have been to even first believe it first believing something doesn't make make it settled for your life you still got to keep it in your memory you still got to walk with it you got to still hold to it amen you want to hold to God's unchanging hand hold to the word of God Amen that memory grade is very important Jesus said in John 14:26 the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you that's the job of the Holy Ghost we come to church and we we hear the word we're being reminded of something going down the road and we go over the speed limit and we hear this little voice say slow down oh shouldn't talk like that shouldn't think like that that's the Holy Ghost where would we be without the Holy Ghost we would be like a ship without a sail we'd be like a a Rudder A Ship Without A Rudder too playing without wings God wants us to continuously remember Calvary Jesus said when we take communion this do in remembrance of me so you can see that God gave us a memory for the good amen and when these thoughts come to our gate whatever God would tell us and if we just step in line with what he said now we're in line with God that's why he gave us that memory is so he could speak to us and we could remember to do what we should be doing amen not get tell us towards our conscience and just oh it doesn't matter you know it's not that big a thing and you know everybody does it and before you you know you're just like the world we're able to take the information that God brings to our remembrance through the holy spirit in and we accept it through that Free Will right that free will say yes I'm going to do it or no it doesn't matter Our member gate is important it's an important gate we must remember that both Spirits have the ability to use this gate even though God gave it for the good SAT wants to use it for his Advantage did you ever hear you ever been somewhere in a restaurant or somewhere and they're playing an old song that you used to like when you were in the world oh boy ah that was a good one those were the good old days that was my favorite group you know all those things that come to you when you hear it that's just the enemy trying to use that gate you listen long enough pretty soon you'll start don't do that don't let the enemy stop them before the devil can get in there all because of memory gate if Saint wants to discourage you there's many ways that he can do that for sure maybe when you're talking to someone that you had a problem with in the past no more you don't got a problem with them now but you did you had a problem with them in the past and as you're talking to them the devil says you remember how they treated you last time remember how they acted last time towards you remember how they lied last time that's the devil using that gate because what it's going to do is oh yeah okay you are not forgiven no I never didn't make that right I never did Cover I never did love at least not with God's love right God's love there's no end to it but you see how the enemy can use that gate maybe he wants to discourage you maybe Satan will will bring up your sins of the past am something that you did so long ago sure you're still ashamed of it but he'll bring them up even though they've been under the blood for how long he'll still bring them up uh and then he'll again and again and try to get you to think that they're still over you that's just Satan using the gate that God gave you called memory for his advantage and that's why we need possession of that gate to not allow Satan to do that we had time we could go through every one of these Gates but to whom you yield yourself servant to be his servant you are you can't serve two masters we can't have two different Gatekeepers you can't if that stuff is happening the wrong gatekeeper there and you got to call them out is if you don't call him out he'll stay there you get a sliver inside your skin in it'll stay there until you decide to pull it out now Satan wants to stay there because he wants to control you he doesn't like this idea that you got baptized and you started serving Jesus Christ made his job harder but he's got to use a different tools now to get you we can't be double-minded about situations the Bible says a double-minded man is unstable in other words your mind has to be the mind of Christ we're engaged in the greatest battle ever fought sat wants to control the gates so he can transport all of his negativity into the inside of us and God wants to control the gates so he can see his will being done in our life and that he could receive Glory with every horrible situation that happens right I don't care how horrible the situation is if Christ is in you you can shine God can get Glory out of it but when you get involved and you start doing figuring that's just Satan tricking you confusing you Galatians 5 verse one tells us that we need to stand fast in the Liberty where where withth Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage Christ set us free but Satan is always working to bring that bondage back Paul having a great concern for us he says in 2 Corinthians 11:2 for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I've espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chased virgin to Christ one husband not two we can't serve two masters but look what he says about the other in verse three but I fear less by any means as the serpent beg galed Eve to his tricky subtility so your minds should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ Simplicity it's not hard we've got it all right here there's no confusion in this word if you just set your heart to follow this word the devil don't got to chance to get in but if your heart isn't in love with him and you're just trying to get by with the the things that you I gotta read I gotta pray I gotta go to church if you got this half-heartedness Satan's got a easy way to get in I'm telling you the truth just you've heard of kisss keep it simple silly don't want to use the other word keep God's words first in your mind Minds at all times keep God's word first in your minds at all times look I'm trying to get to this get away from this I don't mean it wrong just for a bit here Satan gets a lot of people because they say well in my heart God knows that I love them but they let their mind go wherever they want to go say whatever they want to say think what they ever want to think look if your heart is where it needs to be in Christ your mind will be too it's a just a trick of the enemy when we were in the world we heard of taking uh we never heard of taking possession of our thoughts we just heard do what you're told to do your mom said this your dad said this just do it but today as Christians we know the Bible we've been told so many things the scripture tells us that that demons the rest of the demons have been Le loosed and I'll tell you this world is getting worse and worse all the time the devil knows he has but a short time I'll just say it's imperative for us that we take possession of the gates that are inside of us Amen to to focus on how really important that is things that we don't spend much time like we should thinking about now we've been promised as the Seed of Abraham that we would take possession of these these Gates but we're no match for the devil we're no match for the devil we need someone greater than the devil to take control of the gates and that's no one else other than the Holy Ghost and God promised to do it if we would submit ourselves to the word of God I hope you can see where this yielding is coming in we've got to be willing to submit ourselves to the will of God now you want a closer walk with God God says draw nigh to me and I'll draw an eye to you don't just well God you know I need you God you should be helping me and and you just see all this going humble yourself draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you what does it matter what you got to do if you got to go dip seven times and a dirty Jordan humble yourself and go do it whatever he asked you to do do it if you want victory in your life if you want victory in your life now let's notice in the scriptures here the God told Abraham for because thou has done this thing what thing what thing because thou has o obeyed my voice Abraham submitted to the word of God and it's the very same thing that is asked of you and me to not withhold anything from God to put God first to love him with all of our heart this is the key to making the whole Bible come alive in your life and I know the devil wants to tell you oh yeah you've given God your heart it's about time that we start proving to God proving that we're doing it because when all thy ways please the Lord he'll make even thy enemies to be at peace with you well brother John you don't know my enemies no I say you don't know my God the word is more faithful than what we think Deuteronomy 10:2 I'm love these I haven't really saw this scripture I got a hold of this I just want to read it Deuteronomy 1012 and 13 and now Israel what doth the Lord thy God require of thee but to fear the lord thy God and to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul to keep the Commandments of the Lord and and his statutes which I command thee this day for thy good that's what the lord requires of us and if we just did that one thing but I'll say it like this if you do just that one thing you give your life to God that's what it means to give your life to God right there not just to I accept him as my savior and I'm going to go on and do what I want to do with my life it just doesn't work like that Mark 12: 28 and one of the scribes came having heard them reasoning together and perceived that he had answered them well asked Jesus which is the first commandment of all and Jesus answered him the first of all the Commandment says here oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and Jesus said and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with what all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is is like namely is like namely this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these he kind of put it in a nutshell didn't he for us and the scribes said unto him well Master thou has said the truth for there is one God and there is none other other but he and to love him with all your heart with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbor as himself is more than all the things that you could ever think about doing for God right there God has a priority that's why he could say meno come to me Lord didn't I do this didn't I do that depart from me I never knew you this is the most important thing I like how Jesus answered here in verse 34 and when Jesus saw that they answered discreetly he said unto him Thou Art not far from the kingdom that's right you're not not far from the kingdom of God if you have this understanding you're not in yet but you're not far from it and no man after that does ask him any questions I'm so glad the Bible is true from cover to cover I'm so glad God made it plain to me there's not a man in the world that can come and talk me out of this word amen you know that's the wonderful thing about the Holy Spirit that's God inside that's the The God Who created everything that we see everything that we see when we walk out of these doors everything in here you might think oh well man made this oh I'm telling you God made the materials that made that man made that everything that we see God made and he made it by things that are not seen it was by faith and God wants us to have faith in this word it's the seed of Abraham we're entitled to This Promise of possessing the Gate of our enemy we will bring forth as a Seed of Abraham we will bring forth the same faith that Abraham brought forth because Genesis said God said in the beginning every seed will bring forth of its own kind and Abraham laid a seed of faith it was that faith that God could raise up his son from the dead if God wanted him dead that God could do anything and because he did that obedient act because he didn't withhold what was dear to him he was willing to to to give up everything that was dear that he might pleased the heavenly father because you have done this thing your seed that's you and I are going to possess the Gate of the enemy but it's through faith it's not a gift God's not going to hand it to you as a gift you've got to leave here you got to think about the things you're thinking you got to recognize what's going on inside and you got to take a stand amen are you with me we're in this greatest battle in our minds and we need the help of of the Lord James chapter 4 are you getting a little something out of this all right Lord help us to get through this quickly James chapter 4 from whence cometh Wars and fightings among [Music] you come they not hence even of your lust that war in your members so inside of us the black dog and the white dog right ye lust and have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight you war and yet you have not because you ask not you ask and you don't even receive because you don't ask for the right reasons you adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the Friendship of of the world is enity with God now I am not talking about this world I'm talking about the worldly nature that's inside of us the friendship with that worldly nature is enity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is an enemy of God in other words you cannot serve two masters you cannot be just thinking I can think whatever I want to think and it doesn't matter and then oh yeah I want to try to serve the Lord you can't do that I'm telling you there's some people that haven't even haven't been up to the altar in a long time we just need to get this thing settled there are some people that haven't even been up to the altar come on this this word needs to become real to us Paul said in Romans 8:7 he said because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the word of God neither indeed can be so you got to recognize your carnal nature isn't going to be ever going to be subject to this is impossible there's nothing you can do you have to die out to it not ask God to give you help so your carnal mind can do it God does is not going to be friends with your carnal mind he he hates it he hates my carnal mind he hates all of he hates the carnal mindset back to James do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in US is lusting to Envy but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resist the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble amen what was that song that we sang at the beginning or before brother the first song humble yourself let him have his way yield yourself to God it takes a humility to yield yourself he God resists the proud but he giveth grace to the humble submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you notice submit first to God don't try to resist the devil and take care of your problems without God because that's what you're doing but submit to God submit to the word then you can resist the devil then you can take control of the gates in your battle when the battle is Raging always remember the first thing is the word submit to the to the word amen now what do I do what do I do how do I fix this no submit to the word get humble amen fear the lord respect the Lord stay within the boundaries of the word let God fight your battles amen yield ourselves to God that's what it means submit yield ourself to God well how's that going to help me at the situation I mean you know going to church and God and religion that's just you know whatever that's just for my soul when I die w wow it's amazing how the devil has got so many people to think that they can't possess the power of the Holy Ghost I'm here to say God is still alive he is he is the same yesterday today and forever he can get inside of your mind he can get inside of your heart just like the devil can but God don't want to come in there periodically he wants a relationship how can he have a relationship when we're only part-time in God you know somebody's going to work part-time for me they don't get the full-time benefits it's just all there is to it we're not going to get the full-time benefits with God if we're going to part-time him he's going to withhold certain things amen as we yield oursel to God we're automatically taking possession of the gates of our enemy as we're submitting to the word we're taking possession of those Gates and now God now God can filter the right thoughts through our mind now we can start thinking lovely things about others not ill but lovely now we can start talking about a good report not negativity now we can think on the things that are pure all because the gatekeeper is there in control of Our Lives draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you Sinners and purify your hearts did he label him he double-minded like he labeling somebody when our hearts are not all for God our minds are not all for God when our hearts have am miixed right the word of God fell in a heart that was also had some seeds of the world they grew together and he said purify your heart you double-minded only one gatekeeper not two love God with all of your mind with all of your heart when we yield ourselves to the holy spirit this word of God we have the Bible says we have access into God's grace now needs can be met I think we ought to be happy to really have the authority to kick Out the Devil you ever been so mad about a situation but you just didn't have strength to kick the devil out you know what I mean you're just so mad you know it's a devil but you have no strength are you with me am I just saying something that I've experienced and nobody else experienced I like it when the god takes control look because thou has obeyed the voice of the Lord you're going to take possession because you've obeyed the voice of the Lord now I think what I'm trying to say here is I'm not here to tell you what I want you to start obeying I'm here to say to you you need to get serious about making sure you're obeying what God is telling you to do am he may be telling you something different than you I don't know but it isn't just well you just do this one thing and everything's going to be okay no I don't I don't know what your what what what the battle is I just know that that God is going to test us just like he tested Abraham and he's got tests for us he wants to see what we're going to do he wants to see it manifested because when he was getting ready Abraham's getting ready to kill his son and and that God stayed his hand the voice said now I know now I know now I know well he he's God he knew everything before it happened but he said now I know he wants to see the manifestation amen it's not complete until we manifest that word so we can't manifest it until he brings a trial and he brings a test now we have possession now of the very gate that was once used by the enemy the one that he torments us with and puts terrible thoughts in and all because we submitted to the word we put God first not second we've set our love and our affections upon the Lord now God can come in and take control of Our Lives we trade peace for torment I'll do that any day of the week he gave us joy instead of Sorrow he gave us love instead of ill and hurt and hate I'll say god reigns amen he reigns inside of us the Bible when the when the battle is is Raging in the believer's mind we have the Holy Ghost as a gatekeeper we don't handle things like we used to we don't just look at the outward appearance and start judging situations we know we're in a spiritual battle we don't fight against the flesh we don't fight against humans we don't fight against flesh and blood I just going to read one more scripture if I can okay you with me Paul said in Corinthians chapter 10:3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war like the flesh when you read the Old Testament you see nothing but fleshly battles swords and killing and look even when they came to get Jesus and one of Peter's Brothers in the church sold Jesus out for 30 pieces of silver and they came to get Jesus and Jesus and Peter drew his [Applause] sword and he was getting ready to start taking care of business standing for what's right nobody's going to treat my family like that not going to come against my Jesus and he took his sword and he cut a part of the servant's ear off of his enemy and immediately you would think Jesus would have said hey that's a great things thanks for standing with me but he didn't say that he said Peter put your sword away they that kill with the sword will end up dying with the sword in other words what you sow spiritually you're going to reap right amen you want to be negative you want to talk negative you don't want to cover your brother you you want to just take things into your own way it's going to come at you that's just all there is to it because see every seed brings forth of its own kind every seed I just love the spirit of the Lord he just picked up that ear and he put it back on the servant he healed him is a reality we can have the power of God in our life this is not a story that I just seen on TV one time this is the word of God that was true and God is the same yesterday today and forever let's finish reading this all right for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh our our our battle is not in the fleshly realm it is in the inside of man the spirit of man for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but they're Mighty through God to the pwing down of strongholds casting down imaginations imagination is a gate right yes and I'm saying that gate was given to us for good if we had time we could go into that but there are wrong imaginations casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the word of God every High thing H you don't got to do that that's a high thing that's exalting that's that's exalting against the word and bring it into captivity put it into a cage every thought to The Obedience of Christ every thought God has got to be the god of our mind not just our heart of our mind he's got to be the gatekeeper in our mind and having in a Readiness to Revenge I'm going to Revenge all Disobedience when when your obedience is fulfilled see as you yield yourself to God you take possession of the age let's stand together we've got the Holy Ghost as our gatekeeper greater is he that is in you you than he that is in the world the key is yielding ourselves to the Holy Spirit to the word of God submit to it give way to God accept his authority in our minds amen amen amen let's sing that chorus or that song Let the Holy Ghost come in is that your desire to have more of the Holy Ghost just it this is just an opportunity here for you to get to dive into Christ more personally in your life would you be redeemed from every int sin have the Holy Spirit constantly within make the consecration trust in God and then let the Holy Ghost come in oh let the Holy Ghost come in let the Holy Ghost come in make the consecration trust in God and then let the Holy Ghost come in would you have the spirit in your heart to cheer would you be relieved from every doubt and fear make the consecration trust in God in then let the Holy Ghost come in let the Holy Ghost come in let the holy go come in make the consecration trust in God in then let the Holy Ghost come in do you want the fire of God to fill your soul burn up all the draws and sanctify the whole make the consecration trust in God and then let the Holy Ghost come in let the Holy Ghost come in have your way Lord let the Holy Ghost come [Applause] in make the consecration trust in God and then let the Holy Ghost come in do you want the power to make you true and brave so that that you can rescue those that Christ would save make the consecration trust in God in then let the Holy Ghost come in oh let the Holy Ghost come in let the Holy Ghost come in make the consecration trust in God in then let
