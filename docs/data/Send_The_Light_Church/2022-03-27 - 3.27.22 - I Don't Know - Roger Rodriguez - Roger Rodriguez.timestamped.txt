[35:00] lord i believe
[35:03] all things are possible
[35:07] lord i
[35:09] believe
[35:11] [Music]
[35:41] to be here this morning
[35:55] his own work work of the lord
[35:59] i want you to take your bibles
[36:02] and open your your the word the bible
[36:06] and we're going to go to the book of
[36:07] acts
[36:09] 4 20
[36:10] 4
[36:24] to
[36:36] so we're going to read in the name of
[36:37] our lord jesus christ
[36:45] so we cannot speak the things which we
[36:47] have seen and heard
[36:51] let us pray
[37:06] of the elected of this time age
[37:10] in front of your bride lord
[37:12] you're beloved
[37:14] we are here
[37:16] we need your help
[37:18] and we need your blessings today this
[37:20] morning
[37:21] amen
[37:24] you may be seated
[37:30] we were here about two years ago
[37:34] around that time
[37:39] and at that time i felt very very
[37:41] blessed
[37:45] brother john
[37:47] and many of you that are here
[38:15] so sometimes that excuse me
[38:17] uh
[38:18] barbecue meat
[38:22] or the excuse could be a cake
[38:26] or maybe ice cream
[38:28] but always
[38:30] around
[38:43] and if we're the dwelling place of god
[38:47] and we are the dwelling place of the
[38:48] holy spirit
[38:51] we're going to radiate
[38:54] the word
[38:57] so that would always be among us
[39:01] and we're in service
[39:04] the world is going to be here
[39:08] and if we're in a fellowship outside
[39:11] and the world will be with us also
[39:14] [Music]
[39:17] like last night we were sharing like we
[39:18] were last night
[39:21] and those games those activities
[39:24] the word also will be there
[39:40] so when we are with people that are not
[39:41] christians
[39:45] we're letting them read our letter
[39:48] we are they are reading us
[39:53] they're reading the gospel that's
[39:54] written within us
[39:58] so we but if we show back character
[40:05] or perhaps weakness that we have
[40:08] and they're
[40:20] because the word is fixing those those
[40:22] faults
[40:36] it is a
[40:50] those missiles fall at night
[40:53] thousands of missiles have fallen
[40:56] and had terminated cities
[41:00] but we're in a worse battle than that
[41:11] [Music]
[41:17] because you know the devil doesn't bring
[41:18] anything good to your mind
[41:25] he'll say well the holy spirit is being
[41:28] reflected very bad in you
[41:31] he doesn't tell you that the god is
[41:33] showing himself to you
[41:35] he says look at your children
[41:38] they're whirly
[41:40] look at your wife
[41:42] look at all the falls he's got
[41:46] the infirmity
[42:00] and if you have a pain in your head
[42:03] oh you got a tumor now
[42:09] if your eye hurts
[42:13] behind your eyes there's a
[42:14] tumor so
[42:17] those are evil thoughts
[42:20] 24
[42:22] hours a day
[42:26] what the lord says
[42:42] to give you
[43:22] but i want to share with you this
[43:23] testimony
[43:36] we have worries
[43:47] they both grew up together
[44:06] our children got together along and they
[44:08] love one another
[44:12] so my nephew was as soon as he grew up
[44:14] he became very rebellious
[44:17] and he's very tremendous
[44:20] he got on top of the ruffled houses
[44:25] he tells his dad i want to be a
[44:27] christian but i can't
[44:29] i can't
[44:34] when he got to be a certain age at a
[44:35] young age he had a child
[44:40] he was 16 or 17.
[44:43] he
[44:44] had a girlfriend he had a child
[44:47] so it was a life of hurricanes
[44:54] he was proactive and there was more
[44:57] active than he should be
[45:01] so one day he came to the house of my
[45:04] father-in-law
[45:06] they came like they were arguing
[45:11] and my father-in-law he was a christian
[45:14] he was a deacon in the church
[45:16] and he had a man a man that had
[45:18] testimony
[45:21] so he noticed that there was a a a
[45:24] problem there in the family
[45:26] so he started speaking to them
[45:29] he started
[45:43] he said to his uh
[45:45] my father-in-law hey grandpa
[45:49] i cannot be a christian
[45:51] i don't have the strength
[45:56] i desire
[45:58] but i can't
[46:00] my
[46:01] father-in-law
[46:03] pray for them
[46:04] that day
[46:06] it was a friday afternoon in the evening
[46:10] and they went home
[46:26] was driving on a sunday morning
[46:29] he was going to church
[46:32] and he saw an accident in the road
[46:36] and so he stopped
[46:50] so he looks like he's seen a card that
[46:52] he knew
[47:06] so he went to see if he could help them
[47:11] so he saw a young man dead on the ground
[47:16] he saw the car
[47:20] so he calls one of my brothers-in-laws
[47:36] that's my brother's car
[47:40] because there's an accident in the road
[47:43] and there's beside the car there's a
[47:44] young man dead
[47:47] he had blonde hair and he was slim
[47:51] and he's dead that's my nephew please
[47:53] pray for him
[47:57] so the brother of our church when he got
[47:58] near
[48:02] he recognized that
[48:04] that his nephew
[48:07] so he got there down on the road
[48:13] a man driving by said hey pray for him
[48:18] so the brother prayed for him
[48:25] oh as soon he was praying for him he
[48:27] just took a breath
[48:29] and he got back his life
[48:44] he was arguing with his father
[48:58] they're there in the house
[49:28] his son was
[49:42] my nephew was dead
[49:45] he had been on a motorcycle and had an
[49:47] accident
[49:51] he hid an electrical
[49:53] post
[49:57] and his ribs perforated his lungs
[50:01] he had alcohol he had drank alcohol
[50:04] and he had died
[50:06] but we got to the hospital
[50:10] my brother-in-law he hugged me
[50:12] and he cried
[50:15] he died as a drunkard
[50:18] he's lost
[50:24] and i said
[50:32] god is more powerful than a drunkard
[50:35] don't say that
[50:50] i couldn't be there at the funeral
[51:20] so the funeral was a
[51:23] late one day
[51:28] i couldn't be there because i had a
[51:29] flight coming here
[51:34] i couldn't
[51:58] the brother that had prayed for his
[52:00] nephew before
[52:04] [Music]
[52:16] i got in that family
[52:19] there was only one girl
[52:21] and there were five brothers
[52:24] and the father was there
[52:27] so the one that helped me was her mother
[52:42] his brother frank was the one that
[52:44] prayed for his nephew
[52:46] he calls the boys that dies father
[52:48] and died
[52:51] i got some news for you
[52:55] it's a news that nobody knew
[52:57] he said
[53:23] it happened that i went to the hospital
[53:24] on the in that evening
[53:28] i went to visit somebody that was sick
[53:30] in the hospital a neighbor
[53:33] and the neighbor told me something
[53:36] and the neighbor said
[53:39] he said i'm very sad
[53:54] and he was
[54:06] because over there hospitals are being
[54:08] abandoned
[54:09] [Music]
[54:22] so this man was moved you know
[54:26] because he could see that that young man
[54:27] was dying
[54:29] and no one could do anything for him
[54:32] and he says
[54:35] but then his mother came
[55:06] do you want to give your life to the
[55:07] lord
[55:08] yes the young man said i want to give my
[55:10] life to god
[55:13] and that woman prayed for that young man
[55:17] and that woman
[55:28] and he died
[55:32] [Applause]
[55:46] that we have promises
[55:49] the lord says in his word
[55:52] that you would be saved
[55:55] in your house
[56:14] our children
[56:19] but because of hope
[56:26] our minds become full of bad thoughts
[56:31] and we start believing the devil more
[56:32] than than the promises
[56:37] there's more promises
[56:40] there's more promises
[56:57] [Music]
[57:04] [Music]
[57:06] why do we believe the father of lies
[57:12] why do we let negative things come to
[57:13] our minds
[57:16] we have to shake ourselves
[57:21] and put the
[57:22] put the dog the devil on notice
[57:27] [Music]
[57:37] because we have the true father
[57:40] he has given us the spiritual truth
[57:45] why do we keep receiving the trash that
[57:49] the devil wants to give to us
[57:52] we have
[58:08] because there's more promises
[58:11] because the promises are bigger
[58:13] amen
[58:16] amen
[58:33] 18th of december
[58:34] not
[58:47] and she spoke to my mother about the
[58:49] love of god
[58:54] he didn't hear nothing about the end of
[58:56] the world
[58:59] he didn't hear nothing about the book
[59:01] you know apocalypse or revelation
[59:05] oh the world's gonna end
[59:08] heard
[59:09] about the love of god
[59:12] that night
[59:15] understood
[59:30] and that day she was unfaithful to my
[59:32] father
[59:35] but after that she had a new husband
[59:38] the heavenly husband
[59:42] so that day she came home
[59:44] given
[59:57] and that night she came home eating
[59:58] black beans
[1:00:01] and my dad was my father was scared
[1:00:04] you're going to die eating that food
[1:00:07] because beans
[1:00:10] we call beans
[1:00:22] good time to eat
[1:00:39] never made a decision for the lord
[1:00:43] he said no that's very serious
[1:00:47] i'm going to give my life to god and go
[1:00:49] back
[1:00:51] when i give myself to god
[1:00:54] it has
[1:01:05] never accepted the lord
[1:01:16] [Music]
[1:01:36] perhaps
[1:01:37] he identified himself there with her and
[1:01:40] maybe he felt her there
[1:01:45] because when somebody dies
[1:01:49] you go back to those places where you
[1:01:51] had taken
[1:01:52] with that person
[1:01:54] yeah human things
[1:01:55] you know
[1:01:58] how many here are not human
[1:02:02] we are being among humans
[1:02:18] two thousand
[1:02:20] 20.
[1:02:23] my wife says
[1:02:25] you know we live in tennessee
[1:02:28] and we're close to nashville
[1:02:32] we live in murfreesboro
[1:02:35] if one day you come by there
[1:02:37] let me know
[1:02:40] they give me free coffee and panera's
[1:02:41] [Laughter]
[1:02:44] we'll go get some coffee
[1:02:59] and that's in chicago
[1:03:03] [Music]
[1:03:15] they don't want to
[1:03:16] eat so they can save money
[1:03:19] they don't want to buy clothes
[1:03:21] [Music]
[1:03:23] because first you have to take care of
[1:03:24] the knees at home
[1:03:27] so it really is a blessing
[1:03:42] god
[1:03:54] rare to see someone like that
[1:03:56] see
[1:04:10] i remember
[1:04:17] [Music]
[1:04:46] [Music]
[1:04:53] yeah bar parlor
[1:04:54] and we met there
[1:04:57] seven or eight hours later
[1:04:59] we had a good saturday
[1:05:01] [Music]
[1:05:05] so that sunday we were in church in the
[1:05:07] service
[1:05:13] because it's a spanish congregation it's
[1:05:15] a mix
[1:05:18] they preach in both languages
[1:05:35] we found out that our his father was
[1:05:37] sick
[1:05:39] and i'm the only son
[1:05:42] i can't go to venezuela
[1:05:45] because we're we're fixing our papers to
[1:05:47] stay here
[1:06:29] i didn't want to stay here i didn't want
[1:06:30] to stay here
[1:06:32] i didn't want to come to the united
[1:06:33] states
[1:06:36] because the the lord obligated me to
[1:06:38] come here
[1:06:40] but that's a very long story
[1:06:42] my dad's sick
[1:06:45] [Music]
[1:07:11] we became friends at church
[1:07:15] he had a tambourine
[1:07:20] so when they had those fast uh songs
[1:07:24] by the piano
[1:07:26] and
[1:07:40] so i could use their tambourines
[1:07:46] i was only seven or eight years old
[1:07:50] so from then on we were just friends
[1:07:55] those days i like the tambourine better
[1:07:56] than my friends
[1:07:58] you know children's things
[1:08:02] so we went to secondary you know school
[1:08:06] and we were also in bible school
[1:08:21] become a little bigger
[1:08:36] so that
[1:08:50] because the world will mistreat you
[1:08:54] because you don't believe that the
[1:08:55] world's going to mistreat you
[1:08:58] then you find out
[1:09:01] that the world treated you bad
[1:09:04] it's when the world
[1:09:27] so my friend
[1:09:30] became in charge of my dad over there in
[1:09:32] venezuela
[1:09:54] because that's the only way you can help
[1:09:56] us a person that's sick like that
[1:10:00] if the government finds that that
[1:10:01] someone has coven
[1:10:04] they'll take you and put you in a
[1:10:05] hospital
[1:10:07] for you to die there
[1:10:11] those are the sad stories of those
[1:10:12] countries
[1:10:25] uh nurses to be with him people yeah
[1:10:33] but his health was going down
[1:10:39] so it happened that more than a week
[1:10:41] passed
[1:10:47] and he says his friend says i don't
[1:10:48] believe your father was taking his
[1:10:49] medication
[1:10:52] because the medication that i brought to
[1:10:54] him is still the same
[1:10:56] yeah my dad wasn't taking his medication
[1:11:02] because he didn't believe he was sick he
[1:11:03] didn't have covenant
[1:11:06] and he was a man that had a lot of faith
[1:11:10] that's nothing that's a little cold
[1:11:13] and he did not drink it
[1:11:17] so he preferred to go better with the
[1:11:19] friends in the corner
[1:11:22] and he would take his little whiskeys
[1:11:33] yeah there's a reality there the people
[1:11:35] have at hand there
[1:11:40] you know they used to make uh moonshine
[1:11:42] here in the united states
[1:11:48] even though he was sick you still go
[1:11:49] drinking
[1:11:51] drinking
[1:11:52] you know
[1:12:05] i spoke to my dad
[1:12:19] and you know i was here in the united
[1:12:20] states my heart was broken
[1:12:25] and i talked to my father about many
[1:12:27] things
[1:12:28] i thanked him
[1:12:31] for being a good father
[1:12:34] many things
[1:12:49] he didn't think he was going to die
[1:12:53] so that wednesday we spoke
[1:12:57] and i cried a lot with him on the phone
[1:12:59] you take it easy my son
[1:13:17] speak to him very quickly because my
[1:13:19] father is going to die quickly
[1:13:22] he had just come from work and he went
[1:13:24] he took off he said
[1:13:26] he went to see his dad
[1:13:28] and no one did it with kovac
[1:13:40] but his health kept
[1:13:42] going down
[1:14:00] from the church there there were
[1:14:02] nurses that was taking care of my dad
[1:14:08] they told him something happened last
[1:14:10] night
[1:14:12] that
[1:15:08] what
[1:15:25] [Music]
[1:15:46] remember in november he was sick
[1:15:49] and i had that little box there
[1:15:52] i had my doubts about sending it
[1:15:56] because i could see that he was he was
[1:15:58] getting worse and worse
[1:16:02] when i received the good news that
[1:16:04] tuesday
[1:16:18] i was very
[1:16:46] okay you remember the old television all
[1:16:49] you see was little lines
[1:16:51] and they were going off little by little
[1:16:55] your dad is going off
[1:17:00] so they put him on the phone
[1:17:03] and we spoke to him
[1:17:06] and i i could hear his last brief
[1:17:08] breathing
[1:17:13] the lord had already had taken him
[1:17:29] she he was the husband of a christian
[1:17:31] woman
[1:17:33] they were married for 50 years
[1:17:37] almost 51 years
[1:17:40] and he never gave his life to god and
[1:17:42] all those times
[1:17:56] i wanted to call him to the altar
[1:18:00] it was a little pool he needed just a
[1:18:01] pool
[1:18:05] but the pastor didn't want to do that
[1:18:08] but that day
[1:18:21] and he gave a testimony that he had been
[1:18:23] a christian that week
[1:18:36] and he does things that are impossible
[1:18:56] he comes and does something that you can
[1:18:57] you can do in 50 years
[1:19:02] so the testimony of my nephew
[1:19:19] and he changed the order
[1:19:22] so there was salvation
[1:19:25] yeah and that's the way it is
[1:19:28] every day
[1:19:32] the lord saving
[1:19:34] children of christians
[1:19:39] and even sometimes the christian doesn't
[1:19:40] know that it was god that saved them
[1:19:43] i've spoke to brothers
[1:19:46] did they think
[1:19:47] [Music]
[1:20:04] because there was no one that could tell
[1:20:06] them about what happened to their
[1:20:07] children
[1:20:12] there was a young man a sister from the
[1:20:15] church
[1:20:22] [Music]
[1:20:30] and he said to the friends leave me
[1:20:32] alone
[1:20:34] i'm gonna have to fix myself with god
[1:20:37] in five minutes within five minutes he
[1:20:38] died
[1:20:40] and those friends of his said
[1:20:54] with all the sadness that you have at
[1:20:56] the death of your child of our sons
[1:21:10] [Music]
[1:21:18] [Music]
[1:21:24] to know
[1:21:30] [Music]
[1:21:39] there were prayers coming up before the
[1:21:41] presence of god
[1:21:43] did you know that your prayers
[1:21:46] they never expire
[1:21:49] they never end
[1:21:52] they're always there
[1:21:56] you can pray for your nieces and nephews
[1:21:57] today
[1:21:58] [Music]
[1:22:00] and those prayers will be there
[1:22:01] throughout eternity
[1:22:04] because you're interceding
[1:22:20] because the lord says for us to do it
[1:22:49] that's why i did it
[1:23:11] [Music]
[1:23:17] and also in puerto rico they use that
[1:23:19] instrument
[1:23:22] so miguel he played michael he played
[1:23:23] the quattro
[1:23:25] and he also played the piano
[1:23:28] he also played the organ
[1:23:30] he played everything
[1:23:44] [Music]
[1:23:58] a handsome sonata
[1:24:02] his wife became pregnant for the third
[1:24:04] time
[1:24:08] she was very ahead of her pregnancy
[1:24:13] and michael he was a taxi driver
[1:24:18] and one day he did not come home
[1:24:22] two days
[1:24:23] went by
[1:24:24] and the police were looking for him
[1:24:27] three days
[1:24:28] he
[1:24:59] [Music]
[1:25:07] you know you go to the funeral
[1:25:09] procession you go through all that
[1:25:22] and i knew about him because his father
[1:25:24] was a christian
[1:25:26] i'll miss
[1:25:27] within a month
[1:25:29] a month later
[1:25:35] there was a delinquent that came to the
[1:25:37] police station
[1:25:48] with the death of the taxi driver
[1:26:07] they were the ones that
[1:26:09] made him responsible to kill the taxi
[1:26:11] driver
[1:26:13] it was like an initiation in the game
[1:26:15] in the game
[1:26:21] so his conscience was being so
[1:26:23] tormented by what he did
[1:26:29] so god moved upon him and made him he
[1:26:31] went to
[1:26:32] the police
[1:26:36] he said if i didn't kill him
[1:26:40] the other gang members would have killed
[1:26:42] him
[1:26:45] but he gave himself up because he just
[1:26:46] couldn't take it
[1:26:49] he couldn't take what he did
[1:26:53] he read in the news that he had left
[1:26:56] three two children
[1:26:58] and he the wife was that man that died
[1:27:01] his wife was having a third one
[1:27:04] but this delinquent
[1:27:06] he told a story
[1:27:12] because when michael saw that this man
[1:27:14] was going to kill him
[1:27:16] said to
[1:27:21] please give me an opportunity to make
[1:27:23] myself to fix myself up with god
[1:27:29] give me five minutes
[1:28:06] [Music]
[1:28:12] and my nephew he gave him five minutes
[1:28:17] to my father he gave him a week
[1:28:25] what if you don't have the opportunity
[1:28:26] of one minute
[1:28:29] what if you die
[1:28:31] so fast
[1:28:34] that you don't even have a minute
[1:28:37] what would happen to you
[1:28:40] we leave
[1:29:02] we need a firm rock to stand on
[1:29:11] where he went to he speak to the young
[1:29:12] people
[1:29:15] that's one of the functions that i did
[1:29:17] at the church
[1:29:18] then i would speak to the youth
[1:29:24] would tell them it's not only just to
[1:29:25] come to church
[1:29:27] and bring in your bible
[1:29:30] and being in those youth camps
[1:29:35] singing the youth choir
[1:29:48] to have an experience with god

[1:30:21] and then in january the church will give
[1:30:23] you that you a paper that shows that
[1:30:25] you gave an offering
[1:30:28] and then you you use those things for
[1:30:29] taxes
[1:30:31] it's not about them

[1:30:37] that you
[1:30:39] say
[1:30:40] they have you have been sealed by god
[1:30:43] it's an assurance
[1:31:00] and the only thing you did here was
[1:31:01] materialized
[1:31:02] to come on the scene
[1:31:05] when we leave that we read the bible
[1:31:08] we understand
[1:31:10] that we were there
[1:31:12] before the foundation of the world

[1:37:15] and the brokenness
[1:37:17] [Music]
[1:37:26] you are going to have that joy
[1:37:29] and that's what i'm speaking of
[1:37:32] that insurance
[1:37:43] the last five years of my mother
[1:37:49] she had a terrible cough every day
[1:37:54] they had given her some kind of
[1:37:55] radiation treatment
[1:37:58] and the radiation itself ruined her
[1:38:01] lungs
[1:38:05] and it was always a continual
[1:38:08] coughing
[1:38:12] oh the cough was like good for her
[1:38:26] [Music]
[1:38:28] does bother me
[1:38:31] but one of these days i'm going to
[1:38:32] conquer him
[1:38:35] and she had that cough
[1:38:38] and she would speak
[1:38:39] she would testify
[1:38:41] and she would cough
[1:38:43] and she would sing
[1:38:45] and she would cough
[1:38:47] and she would speak about the lord
[1:38:49] and she would cough
[1:38:51] and once in a while she would not come
[1:38:53] for four hours
[1:38:55] it was uh
[1:39:23] you carry your
[1:39:24] problems but you can rejoice in the lord
[1:39:31] because god has given you something
[1:39:32] that's supernatural
[1:39:36] and that supernatural thing is the joy
[1:39:38] of
[1:39:51] hour
[1:40:09] [Laughter]
[1:40:20] together let's start together
[1:40:24] because we always have to read the word
[1:40:25] let's go to romans
[1:40:28] so we can think about the uh we can
[1:40:30] start the preaching
[1:40:33] and we're gonna go to romans chapter one
[1:40:45] [Laughter]
[1:41:01] he
[1:41:05] i want to read this scripture
[1:41:09] romano uno says once romans chapter 1
[1:41:12] verse 1
[1:41:14] verse 6
[1:41:20] among whom you are also called of jesus
[1:41:23] christ amen
[1:41:25] yes
[1:41:26] call of jesus christ
[1:41:30] and
[1:41:56] can we continue
[1:41:58] [Laughter]
[1:42:12] so we can introduce the theme i mean
[1:42:14] okay
[1:42:17] i feel like i'm in venezuela
[1:42:20] i feel like i'm at home
[1:42:23] and that's the way
[1:42:24] the services are in venezuela
[1:42:43] because the american culture is very
[1:42:45] formal
[1:42:48] so everything is planned
[1:42:49] [Music]
[1:42:51] people are busy
[1:42:56] [Music]
[1:43:04] sometimes we come to church with our
[1:43:06] clothes
[1:43:10] [Music]
[1:43:21] the subject that i've been thinking
[1:43:22] about for a while
[1:43:25] it's an expression
[1:43:29] in the spanish version
[1:43:33] that we belong to god
[1:43:46] because it's not the same saying in
[1:43:47] spanish to english
[1:43:50] because
[1:44:15] i say to you i'm from tennessee
[1:44:21] and then my father was from tennessee
[1:44:23] also
[1:44:25] and then my grandfather from tennessee
[1:44:27] also
[1:44:30] and then my thank you my great
[1:44:32] grandfather
[1:44:34] also from tennessee
[1:44:37] because perhaps six or seven generations
[1:44:40] you're going to look at me
[1:44:45] you're a strange tennessean
[1:44:50] and why
[1:44:52] i'm going to ask you
[1:44:53] you're going to say
[1:44:55] you don't even speak english yes i speak
[1:44:57] english
[1:45:12] when i'm hungry
[1:45:17] i have been here for many generations
[1:45:26] [Music]
[1:45:55] and you know to all americans
[1:45:57] everybody's
[1:45:58] atlantis are all mexicans
[1:46:03] oh that's a mexican that came from
[1:46:04] venezuela
[1:46:22] oh you're latin you're
[1:46:23] spanish
[1:46:37] and when they speak
[1:46:45] i know how the colombians they speak
[1:46:49] we speak they speak spanish
[1:46:54] we have many different in the culture we
[1:46:56] have many differences
[1:46:59] and dialects
[1:47:02] and they have different uh slangs
[1:47:20] and when you speak to somebody oh he's
[1:47:21] from costa rica
[1:47:25] because in costa rica they speak a
[1:47:27] little different than the other
[1:47:28] countries in central america
[1:47:33] and mexican you know from far away
[1:47:46] and if you go to south america
[1:48:16] oh you're from chile
[1:48:18] he might get offended
[1:48:21] or vice versa
[1:48:27] they perhaps they speak almost like the
[1:48:29] paraguays
[1:48:44] we come from
[1:48:54] and if you hear me speaking
[1:48:56] latinos you know there are spanish
[1:49:10] some people ask me are you from russia
[1:49:12] or somewhere
[1:49:15] because my english is very rough
[1:49:22] they're expression that you can change
[1:49:28] i might say a word in in spanish
[1:49:31] to another spanish and it might change
[1:49:34] to be very rude
[1:49:38] so because you can interpret them
[1:49:40] indirectly
[1:49:42] so over here they might sound
[1:49:44] nasty
[1:49:46] because there's a way of saying things
[1:49:48] here
[1:49:50] and they sound very very pretty very
[1:49:52] nice
[1:49:55] now if i see you with a bunch of boxes
[1:49:58] because that's happened to me
[1:50:01] and i see that you need help with the
[1:50:03] boxes
[1:50:05] i asked him one time
[1:50:07] can i help you with the box and he
[1:50:08] looked at me mean
[1:50:10] do you do you need anything
[1:50:14] i don't need anything
[1:50:17] so i asked him in the wrong way
[1:50:21] because i spoke from the spanish
[1:50:24] so then i learned
[1:50:27] can i help you yeah
[1:50:29] that's it
[1:50:32] you see how nice and tender that is
[1:50:39] [Music]
[1:50:46] so there's not much here
[1:50:48] only only for the flute
[1:51:04] so then
[1:51:16] people from the south
[1:51:29] i learned the dialects and the sounds
[1:51:46] i've been i've gone with my boss to
[1:51:49] different places
[1:51:52] and we spoke to somebody that we have
[1:51:54] found in the way
[1:51:57] and my boss says oh he's from california
[1:52:00] i said how do you know he's from
[1:52:01] california
[1:52:03] because i live i lived there and i knew
[1:52:05] how they spoke
[1:52:11] so i said i didn't understand anything
[1:52:21] [Music]
[1:52:36] [Music]
[1:52:39] we think we have a plane dialect
[1:52:44] oh i don't speak with dialect
[1:52:47] but the people from the south knows
[1:52:48] you're the way you talk
[1:52:57] why am i trying to show you where we
[1:52:59] come from
[1:53:05] i've been here three years now
[1:53:09] [Music]
[1:53:14] i've come to adapt to the customs here
[1:53:17] in this country
[1:53:22] we don't celebrate the fourth of july
[1:53:24] okay
[1:53:28] because our dependence was the july the
[1:53:30] 5th
[1:53:35] we don't celebrate the day of grace
[1:53:38] why
[1:53:39] thanksgiving
[1:53:40] because there was something that was
[1:53:41] done here
[1:53:44] historically
[1:53:45] thanksgiving is an american holiday
[1:53:53] they came the spanish they went to
[1:53:54] venezuela
[1:53:56] christopher columbus
[1:53:58] they came with three ships
[1:54:03] and that ship they carry prisoners
[1:54:19] and those are kind of people that
[1:54:20] columbus took to venezuela
[1:54:24] so then he finds a group of indians
[1:54:32] they take things from the natural
[1:55:01] and we all got mixed with them
[1:55:09] our genetics are very different
[1:55:45] central america
[1:55:48] so we the latins that come here are
[1:55:50] spanish people that come here
[1:55:53] we start to adopt the of the customs of
[1:55:56] here
[1:56:00] i want thanksgiving to come already
[1:56:05] because we have turkey everywhere
[1:56:10] and venezuela the only turkey when
[1:56:12] somebody gets married
[1:56:17] and when you want turkeys i hope
[1:56:18] somebody gets married
[1:56:24] so there are things that you adapt to
[1:56:40] we're living
[1:56:42] and we start to lose
[1:56:46] things of where we came from
[1:56:51] what if i go out there and the fifth of
[1:56:52] july start burning fire firecrackers
[1:57:19] and i will put artificial fire
[1:57:36] a a a spanish custom
[1:57:40] because we're we're we're burning judas
[1:57:45] because it was judas who gave up the
[1:57:47] lord you know he's a stranger
[1:57:49] so that is a catholic custom
[1:57:53] what if i did that here
[1:57:56] they'll call 911
[1:57:59] [Music]
[1:58:04] as a latin person or spanish i can't do
[1:58:07] that here
[1:58:09] so i become adapted
[1:58:12] to your customs here
[1:58:16] because i don't want to be like the odd
[1:58:18] birds
[1:58:28] in english
[1:58:34] so there's about three latin families or
[1:58:36] spanish
[1:58:38] while the pastor is preaching
[1:58:42] you'll see us with their phone like this
[1:58:45] oh no respects
[1:58:59] and what the pastor is preaching
[1:59:01] the text
[1:59:02] it shows it it interprets for us
[1:59:09] because we want to learn english
[1:59:12] we want to know what they're saying from
[1:59:13] the pulpit
[1:59:17] sometimes you hear the phone bad and
[1:59:19] they put crazy stuff
[1:59:23] i used to i remember i used to play the
[1:59:24] flute
[1:59:39] so wanna come to this point
[1:59:54] that we were taught
[1:59:56] in the gospel
[2:00:04] in the 60s or 70s
[2:00:09] to come to a church in the message
[2:00:13] let's say if you go out there you they
[2:00:14] put christmas uh light bulbs and stuff
[2:00:20] will kill you
[2:00:23] what do you do with that
[2:00:38] and they become
[2:01:05] that's in peru
[2:01:09] nobody knows
[2:01:11] that in that hill
[2:01:13] there was a city right
[2:01:19] [Music]
[2:01:20] there was an ancient city
[2:01:27] for hundreds of years nobody knew
[2:01:30] there was a city there

[2:01:58] [Music]
[2:02:05] [Music]
[2:02:14] and it covered it
[2:02:30] observed
[2:02:32] covering us
[2:02:33] and is covering us
[2:02:40] making us to get used to things
[2:02:47] and something that a christian didn't do
[2:02:49] in days come by
[2:02:51] and now
[2:02:54] modernism
[2:02:55] of the gospel
[2:02:57] of the message
[2:03:11] all the houses of the christians had
[2:03:12] televisions
[2:03:17] no no no christians had tvs
[2:03:20] no
[2:03:22] why
[2:03:25] because they said it was a devil's box
[2:03:30] and then it was a bad influence for the
[2:03:31] children
[2:03:33] because it made the christians cold
[2:03:36] no one had tvs
[2:03:46] [Music]
[2:03:49] let's buy a tv so we can see the movies
[2:03:52] of

[2:04:34] and the movies of the birth of jesus
[2:04:44] [Music]
[2:04:47] oh it went into the rooms
[2:04:50] even to the bathroom
[2:04:52] i've been to homes where they've had tvs
[2:04:54] in their bathroom
[2:04:58] i mean there's things that happen you
[2:05:00] can't you can't back up
[2:05:03] you have to see you have this even
[2:05:04] living
[2:05:06] yes
[2:05:08] so that television
[2:05:10] found a night found a bride
[2:05:13] found a bride
[2:05:16] and that bride is called
[2:05:18] computer and they got married
[2:05:22] and they had a son
[2:05:25] a smart tv
[2:05:26] [Laughter]
[2:05:30] and now
[2:05:45] see
[2:06:01] [Music]
[2:06:14] with
[2:06:28] a christian woman you can identify is
[2:06:30] easier to identify
[2:06:32] but a man
[2:06:33] a christian man
[2:06:37] in times past you would look at him
[2:06:40] and you would say that man is a
[2:06:41] christian he's different
[2:06:53] there was something about that
[2:06:54] individual
[2:07:02] sometimes we were the brothers at the
[2:07:04] church talking
[2:07:07] and you know what the conversations are
[2:07:24] oh
[2:07:38] it's a series that people watch like
[2:07:40] levels
[2:07:44] yeah they come by seasons
[2:07:46] seasons
[2:07:49] [Music]
[2:07:51] maybe one season brings 20 chapters
[2:07:59] and every chapter lasts one hour
[2:08:04] and so you start watching that that in
[2:08:06] on my monday
[2:08:09] and by wednesday you finished it
[2:08:15] yeah but it was five seasons
[2:08:20] yeah you saw the whole thing
[2:08:22] in one week
[2:08:25] he ate all those five seasons
[2:08:29] you asked yourself
[2:08:33] and what time of day did he pray
[2:08:39] what did he do
[2:08:43] to
[2:08:44] see one season in one day
[2:08:49] and the season of 20 hours
[2:08:54] and you take those message uh you you
[2:08:56] add those things up
[2:09:00] and you don't have the time
[2:09:13] and what time did you listen to the
[2:09:15] message or read your bible
[2:09:22] i mean
[2:09:23] it's like a lie
[2:09:27] you might think it's a lot as a joke
[2:09:42] and they think that i'm not
[2:09:43] understanding them
[2:09:46] because i don't speak the complete
[2:09:48] english
[2:09:49] but i understand
[2:09:51] and i ask myself
[2:09:53] what is this
[2:10:12] and i took a subject
[2:10:16] and the pastor
[2:10:20] after i finished preaching
[2:10:26] his head was downward and all the time
[2:10:28] he was preaching
[2:10:33] i accused myself
[2:10:37] i have fallen into those traps
[2:10:44] i like this series on facebook
[2:10:48] and also netflix
[2:10:52] that is a pastor
[2:11:05] i admired him
[2:11:20] he's coming
[2:11:35] [Music]
[2:11:48] in this final day
[2:12:03] you already read so much
[2:12:14] [Music]
[2:12:32] don't lose your step
[2:12:46] and according
[2:12:58] they're going to come and blanket us and
[2:13:00] convince us
[2:13:18] [Music]
[2:13:42] going to come and and he's going to give
[2:13:44] us the receipt how much you owe
[2:13:48] because when we don't do what he says
[2:13:52] he's going to he's going to
[2:13:53] you're going to have to pay
[2:14:10] and they can give us a voice of warning
[2:14:14] but it's happening
[2:14:16] they're men
[2:14:19] pastors
[2:14:20] ministers
[2:14:36] and that's very sad
[2:14:48] this been in my heart for two months
[2:15:32] oh we found out by the internet brother
[2:15:33] brendan had a little christmas tree
[2:15:36] and that's okay
[2:15:38] you could have your little tree
[2:15:42] and next year but you'll get something
[2:15:44] else
[2:15:45] and perhaps something else
[2:15:49] and we found out that the christmas tree
[2:15:51] comes into church
[2:15:54] and they may be behind the poop in one
[2:15:55] day
[2:15:58] so then with that little tree there
[2:16:00] comes the lights
[2:16:16] what happened here
[2:16:29] he's very kind he's very sweet
[2:16:44] he's very sweet
[2:16:57] so no one would come
[2:16:58] and tell the pastor anything
[2:17:04] and that's how the world is creeping in
[2:17:11] don't stay a step
[2:17:16] [Music]
[2:17:23] [Music]
[2:17:38] [Music]
[2:17:53] why are you losing the originality of
[2:17:55] the what you had before
[2:17:59] come up from amongst them
[2:18:01] and do not touch the unclean thing
[2:18:06] why are we accepting those things
[2:18:10] why are we becoming more modern
[2:18:14] we have to have come to limitations
[2:18:21] [Music]
[2:18:24] not that the world's creeping it but we
[2:18:25] are creeping into the world
[2:18:28] we have to be watchful
[2:18:32] oh he's too old
[2:18:34] it's antiquity
[2:18:48] never lose the original of the words
[2:19:17] to have someone here stand and speak
[2:19:19] about the people
[2:19:24] i believe that we have the same message
[2:19:28] and we have the same message revealed
[2:19:30] word for the age that we're living in
[2:20:12] and i'm very grateful
[2:20:15] [Music]

[2:20:42] to four hour messages
[2:20:46] and

[2:20:54] to never give up on any of our loved
[2:20:55] ones
[2:20:58] any of our friends any and that we love
[2:21:02] and

[2:21:40] and
[2:21:43] may god help us
[2:21:45] to
[2:21:46] to
[2:21:48] to not get relaxed

[2:21:54] allowed in
[2:21:57] to to become
[2:21:58] the head
