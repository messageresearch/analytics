in the presence of my precious brothers and sisters I want to say thank you for your prayers for us while we were away for a few days it was good to get away it's better to be back amen just want to make that clear where we stand on the topic amen how many's come to draw closer to the Lord amen amen amen let's look to the Lord before we enter in to the word of God today Father we want to thank you that you've given us health and strength to be here today know that there are others Lord that for reasons beyond their their their because of their situation Lord they would like to be here but cannot and I just want to thank you that you have given us your grace to be here together and we pray for those that are not able that you would be with them Lord and that you would Supply every need that they would have father as we come into your house today you you see the very uh thoughts and intents of our heart your word is still deser erning thoughts and intents today Lord we just ask that you would graciously look down upon us in your goodness and Lord that you'd give us faith that whatever needs that we have in our lives that we could just believe in the power of almighty God to meet those needs according to your riches and Glory because you are more than able you are Jehovah Gyra you are here to do all that we would have need of and I just pray that our faith could just rise a little bit more this morning bless the word to our heart let it bring Faith to us Lord and Lord when the enemy would try to get our minds to drift here and there and Lord just to be uh distant Lord I just pray that you draw us back to the word father help us to to just recognize you in your presence today Father we commit the service with all of our needs into your hands We Trust You Lord that that you'll have your your Liberty and your way inside of us for we ask these things now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen turn with me if you would there's two scripture readings one is in St John chapter 19 and the other is in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and there's just going to be one verse in each of those St John chapter 19 and first 1 Corinthians chapter 1 where would we be without the word of God there would just we'd be lost absolutely is the only thing that doesn't contradict itself only thing that's perfect and our our souls are anchored to it all right St John chapter 19 we're going to read verse number 30 it says here Jesus on the cross after he had he just getting ready to die and he's looks at his mother and has compassion on her condition because he's leaving and has compassion on on one of his disciples John and uh he's takes care of them in the natural and then he says here in verse number 30 when Jesus therefore had received vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost amen and then in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse number 18 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse number 18 Paul speaking to the Corinthian Church he says for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God amen amen God bless you you may be seated the price that God had required of Adam's sin was paid in full when Jesus said it is finished and because we were born in sin after Adam's sin our debt was paid in full at the same time that Jesus said it is finished now we understand according to the prophet that a a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received as a pardon and there was this man that was in jail at at the time of Abraham Lincoln and he had done something wrong and he was going to receive the death sentence and uh Abraham Lincoln did not have time I I think this is how the story goes they didn't have time to go there so he just wrote on a note and pardoned this man and he said I pardoned this man and he signed it Abraham Lincoln and he gave it to one of his uh Soldiers the men there and he he he came to the jail where he was and he he handed him the note and he said uh you're here this note is from you from Abraham Lincoln and he unlocked the jail cell and the note read that I I pardon so and so from uh the death sentence and the man that uh after he read the note and the door was open something inside of him uh w just couldn't believe this was real that this really wasn't given to him by Abraham Lincoln that the word was not the word of Abraham Lincoln amen and so he just didn't believe it and he sat there in the jail and so when the time came for the uh uh for him to to to die and be executed he was executed then there was an uproar because uh Abraham Lincoln had signed it it was just as good as gold that he was pardon yet he he died and so the Court ruled the judge ruled that a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received as a paron amen and and though Christ died for the whole world right you have to receive the pardon in order to be pardoned Jesus said in John 5:39 search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life that's right and they are they which testify of me so it's it's almost like I really care what I think about God I don't care what I think about the scriptures what matters is what the scriptures say to me amen because that's who that's really who God is the scriptures not what I think but what the scriptures say verse 4 he says and and ye will not come to me that you might have a life in other words so many people stay in the jail cell right they will not come out and they will not search the scriptures and find out exactly what it really means to believe in God Goen very familiar scripture in John 3:15 whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life so the key here is to believe for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved and he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he have not believed in the name of the only begotten son and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and Men love to stay where they're at amen because their deeds were evil amen God has provided way there was nothing greater that God could done if God forced his holy spirit to be put on one person to change their life without freeor agency just just to do it then he would be guilty and have to do it to everybody so God did his part he finished the work of of paying the price and now it's up to us it's up to us to take Faith in what the scriptures are telling us to get saved and to go I'm going to say this to go beyond the denominational belief of Salvation and going into the this the the scriptural belief of a nature change because there's a difference there's a difference it's a complete word of God become born again the right way God's way amen the harder way but it's the precise way it's the the the the correct way I'll say it like this it's the only way Jesus said I am the way the truth the life and no man cometh to the father but by me God coming in the flesh and paying the price on the cross of just death it opened the door for us to have access now to the power of the cross I want to entitle this to the divine power of the cross I I believe there's power today that we have access all because of Calvary amen now the cross did not make us born again the cross only made a way for us to become born again and today we must work out our own salvation with fear and trembling and I'll say like this the more we fear the more we tremble the more we search the scriptures the more we want to be sure the more accurate we're going to get it but the more we think well this is the way I think it should be and this is the way we're going to run our home and this what you know what we're going to miss it it we got to become completely Born Again into the divine nature of God Amen the cross was the the only way provided for us to receive salvation the Bible says without the shedding of the blood there is no remission of sins so we could say without the shedding of the blood there's no salvation there's no healing there's no Deliverance there's no nature change without the cross now it's funny to me how how people can just say you know I believe in the cross I believe in the salvation but they don't believe in the nature change I question whether they believe in Salvation And I have a right to do because there are things that accompany salvation without the shedding of God's own blood there's no peace that passeth all understanding there's no joy unspeakable and full of Glory there's no way to love others actually the way that Christ loved us because he told us to love others the way he loved us and I can't love others with my own carnal fial love I need the agape love of God the shedding of God's own blood opened the door to the promises of God for our lives and inside inside the cross is hidden the treasures or the power to become just like Jesus Jesus most people I don't think they're really interested in that right I I mean they wouldn't mind it so bad if they didn't have to give up anything right they wouldn't have to Die daily crucify the flesh they you know kind of admit that part of their their their nature is wrong their life is wrong and to to take a stand against it I love this scripture and I want to dig into it today 1 Corinthians 1:18 our opening scripture for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God now there's a lot into this this verse and I want I wanted to take it from the Amplified version so you just please forgive me if you don't believe in the Amplified version but it really brings out more of a light it says for the message of the Cross is foolishness or absurd or illogical to those who perish who are perishing and are spiritually dead because they've rejected it right but to us who are not saved but to us who are being saved I love that it is uh the manifestation of the power of God Amen in other words God's power is manifesting in the lives of of those who act upon the word each day if the word is real to them and they take God at his word then the word will become manifested in their lives and if all they do is they believe in some religion which is I believe this and fill in the blanket don't matter what it is it is just a religion it's just a covering and many people use this message as a covering but you cannot denominate the real message you can make it what you want to make it but God has made it what it is and it's a Living Word and God will stand behind the messag so it starts with faith only believe not not works now just obedience to what the word says that's the only work Jesus said in John 7:37 the last days that great day of the feast Jesus Took he stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink now the thing is nobody's going to come to Jesus if they're not thirsty they're not going to drink so he's not speaking to them amen he's speaking to those who are hungry and those that are thirsty and he that believeth on me as the scripture have said there's the key he that believeth on me is the scriptures is not as as the Devils believe but as the scriptures say out of his belly you can't help it shall flow rivers of Living Water you can't help it when it's bubbling and people are going to see [Music] it for the message of the Cross is foolishness absurd ill logical to those who are presently perishing and spiritually dead because I love this reason because they have rejected it in other words it's all about free more agency you're going to reject the word or you going to receive it but to us who who are being saved did you know I'm being saved today amen it's exciting amen my salvation you know you can say well I was saved before the foundation of the world you can say I was Bor saved at cover and you can say well I was saved when I gave my heart to Christ but I'm telling you today I'm being saved and I I'm I'm proud of it I'm proud to say it because the the the claws of Satan are everywhere so Paul is speaking of two different groups here one group is just scoffing at God's sacrifice of the Cross and the other is is being saved today by it being saved today by it so one group says today is the day of salvation the other group says I don't need salvation today I'm already saved one group is working out their salvation with fear and trembling the other group feels there's really nothing to work out I'm saved one group is fighting the good fight of fath faith and the other is just kind of sitting back losing more of their faith every day and wondering why they're so weak one group is earnestly contending for the faith and the others just kind of put their their shield down their their sword down one group is holding the beginning of their confidence steadfast to the end and the other group well you know what they've just let go of that confidence and they begin to in their heart the Lord delayeth his coming I might as well just go do this and I might as well go do that and everything Remains the Same see two different groups one group is being saved today she is manifesting the divine power of the cross the other group is not letting the word save her from her situations that she's in she's refusing to manifest the power of God she just wants to just make some [Music] excuse and we just got to be I'm I'm I feel we just need to be honest with oursel just be real with yourself because that's the only way to get ahead one group doesn't believe the other group believes but but brother bam told us of a third group and this group acts like they believe that they really don't right they're a make believer amen they had still a form of godliness but they deny the power of the Cross yes there's no manifestation of the power of the cross in their life that actually changes their nature into the divine nature of God but they're still claiming still going to church but their their lives are really what are they manifesting they're manifesting they're in love with themselves still that was the thing we're supposed to be delivered from I did not have to teach my kids to love themselves I I just remember myself growing up in love with what I wanted to do the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want the price that the father had required by his word was paid when Jesus said it is finished but there's still work to be done Jesus said you must you must go forward and get born again right it's finished but you must go forward and get born again a complete nature must take place to where all things are of God in your life is that the scripture let's say Amen to the word it's that this is not brother John preaching this is the word of God Jesus said follow me into the Regeneration he said I go to prepare a place for you when the Holy Ghost comes he will lead and guide you into all of the nature change he that truly believeth in me he said the works I do shall he do also Paul said we've been created unto good works so there's still a work to be done Jesus finished paying the price with the death of his In the Flesh he tasted death for every man the Bible says so we wouldn't have to be eternally separated from him but we need the power of the Cross daily to stay connected to him or we'll drift away and I'll say it like this to have our lives completely changed and I think brother Ry was telling me and I used to hear from Brother Johnson you you you go one day without praying and you know it you know it you go two days the kids know it or the wife knows it I'm sorry and you go three days and the dog even knows it so you know you can't just say well I still believe you you got to stay connected in the vine you still got to you you still got to say God take away this desire to want to please myself and help me to actually honor you as king of kings and Lord of lords and and the creator of everything that I look at and the birds help me to honor you and worship you too often we look at those things and we say man those are beautiful well to look at those things and say God you're beautiful because it took a beautiful God to make them there's no power without believing in the power of the cross I want you to remember that statement there is no power without believing in that power the power of the Cross cannot be activated in your life unless you're trusting the word for you it's all of us can say I believe the word but can you say I will believe this word because I believe something's going to happen in my life because that's what the word is for if none go with me still I'll follow amen we've got to believe without faith it's impossible to please God God impossible second Peter uh 1: uh 3-7 I just want to read these uh We've read these before and I think it's good to be reminded of these because we're talking about the divine power of of God and it's hidden in the cross and I I'll just say it like this when Jesus finished the work what it did is it opened the door now for the promises of God to come to pass in your life right that's what it did without Calvary we wouldn't have access to the Holy Ghost we just do our best to try to be a good person well we know how far that would go second Peter chapter 1:3 according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue so where have you been called to okay I I didn't get to hear the message that Brother Bruce preached on Wednesday but I heard it was a good messag amen and the thing is you all if we all go back to the beginning when we were called we were called to him we were not called to be part of a church right part of a group part of the the brandom nightes we were called to Christ to be his wife and I'll say it like this it's glory and virtue now according to his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto this life unto godliness unto the through the knowledge of him that called us so now we got to dig in the scriptures search the scriptures find out what this knowledge is how we can become like him amen now whereby are given unto you and I exceeding great they're not little baby promises they're exceeding great and precious promises that by these we might be partakers of what a divine nature now it's starting to talk about how we Act Right how we handle things what how we're going to react when the pressure comes on us if the divine nature comes out or our old nature comes [Music] out having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence I mean effort effort add add add add add you know certain things are easy to add right like calories no effort because there's a natural a natural appetite soon as that chocolate bar hits my tongue I mean it just sets me in a rage for another bite now if I want to start eating healthier I I I mean that takes effort I mean if I'm going to add Health to my life is it's going to take more than a few pills and and and it's going to take more than just a couple prayers I'm going to have to be willing to say no five candy bars is too much I'll start cutting down to four and then three and then two but you see you got to keep adding you got to keep adding to that divine nature it don't just come with the calendar how long you've been in the message it comes with you adding to it you working you believing amen that you are going to become just like Jesus and it needs to be your heart's desire it won't happen with just a desire because I believe everybody that came out of Egypt wanted the Promise Land I believe that but there's only two that had a different spirit and what was different about their Spirit they wholly followed the Lord Amen in other words they kept adding kept adding kept adding whatever God told them to do they just added it to their to to their life I will do this I will do that I will go here I will obey this we got some Christians nowadays all they want to do is go to church when it's convenient for him right and that ought to be good enough well I think that's good enough for a tribulation I'll say it like it is because if you're going to make this Rapture you're going to have to put everything you got in into it brother John I don't know that's that's pretty strong I'd rather have you hate me now and love me then you'll never regret giving your All to Jesus our minds must accept the promises of God the word of God for our lives we can't just say it's true and then and then don't accept it don't because if you don't won keep adding to your life these virtues how will your nature ever change and I'll say it like this it starts in our mind our mind that's why we're here at church to receive the word and into our mind into our hearts we need the mind of Christ amen Paul said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus what kind of mind did he have he humbled himself to obey all the word yeah to become a servant to live for others well you know what I I I've got these you know I don't think people are interested in the mind of Christ it's like they want to claim there something but they're not willing to fight for the mind of Christ to fight for the nature but they'll fight because this is where they stand I want to fight the good fight of Faith that's that's the fight we'll never get the mind of Christ without really wanting it bad enough we've got to press into it we got to have that spirit that presses into to it we got we have to start dismissing our carnal mind that that mind that God hates the Bible says he hates the carnal mind it's enmity with him we got to be willing to start working at casting down reasonings that say oh no you don't need to go to church no you don't have to do that look if you don't cast that down you're never going to change you can't expect God to come and just Bless you that's right and start serving him that don't work like that we've got all the opportunity that he I'll tell you if we all died right this second we God don't owe us one thing that's right but we've got to cast down the doubts that the devil gives us cast down the excuses cast down everything that exalts itself against the knowledge of God the knowledge of the cross the cross was to bring us to a nature change we originally born with a nature that doesn't even believe in the nature of God I tell you when I was in the world and somebody told me you know you need to stop doing that you you you need to realize that God serving God is is more than just going to a Catholic church and doing what you want to do and you know what that just didn't you know that didn't turn me on I wasn't excited about that because I know I could go to the Catholic church and and and still do what I want to do in the world because the the preacher never told me to change so there was there was nothing there being convicted but when I heard the word when I heard the rest of the word then I began to get stirred and start searching for the truth amen we must die to that thinking daily and take God at his word amen change it starts with changing the way we think and what's so beautiful about this is that we can do that right this second we don't have to wait till we leave church I love what uh James Allen or alen James said the greatest discovery of any generation is the man can Al alter his life by altering his attitude or the way that he thinks so it starts in the mind God cannot and will not work against our Free Will and that's why our minds have to change we must accept the word into our minds and allow it to change our attitudes brother Brandon said that our mind is the womb to our soul right and our soul is the nature of our spirit so if we don't change our mind if we don't change the way we think then how is our how is our nature going to ever get changed it's so simple our nature must keep on changing until All Things become God now that's our goal we can't lose track of that we're not a group that believes in Two Souls we're a group that believes in one Soul that's converted from an ungodly nature to the nature of God that's what we are so in other words we believe in the power of transformation amen it changes the selfish nature into the divine nature of God and it happens as we accept the word of God into our mind and we say I want this for my life yes if we're only going to be satisfied with just coming to church and really never have a drive to change do you know there's a greater a greater damnation coming and I it's happening on a daily basis that you listen to this statement brother brandham said a man never leaves the sanctuary the same way he came in he is either drawn closer to God right and that closer could be this simple Lord I Repent of my past that's closer to God or you're further away because you don't feel you should have to do all that stuff now you you may feel like you're the same but in reality to God you're closer or further away and to whom much is given much is required now here's the scary we we need all the word to make a rapture we do now the downside is if you don't want all the word it's going to be much greater what is left after the word what is left there is no there is no Grace outside God whereby are given unto us great exceeding great and precious promises that by these we might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust this happens now one thought at a time one thought comes in your head this is how it happens one thought one minute at a time one hour at a time one day at a time and you begin to change by taking control of your mind see here's the biggest problem in the world the world has gone crazy right they don't care about the Constitution they don't care about God they don't care and they don't even care that they're wrong they are so used to letting their minds just think whatever they want to think there's no control of their mind if I could say it like this a mind that has no control is out of control and it's not not sound you can't depend on it that's why you cannot depend on yourself am but you can depend on God Amen and he don't want us to depend on ourself that's right he don't want us to say you know I'm going to take us through no he wants to say God he just tell you a real man a real man gets on his knees and he says I can't make it without God I'm going to look to him that's a man anything short of that is not a man Romans 12: 2 and be not conformed to this world don't let the world just you know draw you in that direction because there's a big poll in the world but be ye transformed how do we do this how do I become transformed by the renewing or the renovating of your mind we renovated no brother Stan renovated this room sister Amanda's uh room is being renovated right now what you do is you take something that isn't what it is at that point and you bring it back to where it should be so you renovate it you go through the process of taking out the old and putting in the good but but how does this happen is in your mind you have to make different decisions I'm not going to think about that I'm not going to do that I'm not going to go in that direction I'm going to put God first and that is how you become transformed it's in your fingertips God is already paid the price it is finished we have access to the divine power that's in the Cross by simply taking the word and believing it for what it says amen I love the rest of this that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God there's only one will that's acceptable to God that's his perfect will and it's good it's good just like everything God created he said it's good his will is good and it's the only will that's good my will is perverted amen well I love the word this morning the divine power of the Cross gives us access to God's grace we do not have to listen anymore to the devil we don't have to just take all the thoughts that come into our mind and say yeah they're true no we can try the spirit see if it be of God and the ones that are not I resist you devil I will give my life to God I will they that are pure right have this hope that they're going to be like Christ one day and they take their mind and they say I'm going to start being better today than I was yesterday because when we're in the world we just actually don't care what we think about we don't care what we say we don't care how we treat people we just don't care you cross me and I'll cry CR you you look at me and I'll Christians Christians that's not Christlike and that's why I don't want a form I want the genuine amen I want the real thing amen and how do I know I got the real thing I get up tomorrow and I do it again and if I fall I get back up I say sorry Lord and I do it again I don't I don't put my name in a book I don't say spoken tongues I don't do this thing I got baptized no I look at my life I look at my life and it tells me where I'm going it tells me where I'm at right because I've searched the scriptures you don't have to think about thinking we're something arrogant proud unthankful self-centered we can be transformed by simply accepting the word of God into our mind by saying I don't want to be like that anymore I don't want to do that I don't want to hurt I don't want to I don't I don't want to be selfish anymore I actually want to love God more than I do he gave his life for me you just accept that into your Minden you think about it you begin to let it mean more to you than it did yesterday and then it drops down into your heart that's when it becomes real amen is when it drops down into your heart but it's hard to have something in your your heart if your mind is over there all the time you understand that's how the devil here you take a Christian he's just walking with the Lord he's real strong he's going to do this I want to help and you know he's real strong for a while and then all of a sudden he's way over here how did that happen it did not happen overnight it didn't happen because one bad thing happened to him and he fell that's not how it happens it happens because the he begins to slip in his dedication I don't you know I God before you know it you keep doing that and God just what you're doing is you're grieving the Holy Ghost right and before you know you're over here and you're just going to church but nothing's happening are you with me I I think some you ought to jump up and say I love the word of God because the word of God is the only thing that can help our lives we come here to come to to let the word discern what's really happening inside of us and I understand that my shoe is not going to fit every one of you but I believe that God's going to preach all sizes here before we leave I believe there's a shoe to fit us and we all want the same thing is that right we all want to be closer to God we all want to make a Rapture that that's all of our testimony we want that amen we become transformed by simply accepting God's word into our mind we begin to meditate upon it day and night yes we feed on the word we just don't well you know say our prayers before no the word means something to you there's a there's you you you honor this you honor it you respect it you fear it you know you can't live without it just like the children of Israel they were fed from Heaven the bread that came down a type of feeding on Christ daily and having the attitude you cannot just eat the word today and not eat it tomorrow you got to eat it fresh every day and if we sincerely do this we sincerely do this I believe we be able to our life our life will prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God before you know your spouse is going to be saying what is going on with you people at work are going to be saying why are you so happy you know it's one thing to go into a restaurant and you know put on your BT Duds but it's another thing to live it in your home now I tell you you want a better Church which we all do Let's Get Better Homes let's make some sacrifices at home so we can get like a burden you know instead of coming to church all selfish about me come on I'm going to preach it whether you like it or not I'm going to preach it we ought to be Christians that live for others amen right that care about others that we we're interested in the welfare of others not com to church and say well you better just do your job up there and help me if you don't encourage me it's a bad service the word can never be bad the spirit behind what is said can be bad but not the word amen word's the word verse three for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you so I'm speaking to all the men here women you're off the hook for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you first thing not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think don't think you're better than somebody else don't think you're you're more capable so you don't have to humble yourself to God's word don't think you don't need to follow the word don't think you you don't need to do certain things that the word says don't think more highly than you ought to think according okay but got to think soberly amen so I remember when I was drunk Brother Bruce I couldn't think straight and I remember my dad trying to trick me to see if I was drunk or not and I tried so hard to answer his questions to prove I had a sober mind when I wasn't sober you think different and a Christian who's not filled with the spirit walking in the spirit he does not have a sober mind you can't just act like you got a sober mind and think you got a sober mind a sober mind comes from God to think soberly how is that according as God has dealt to every man The Measure of Faith now what is faith faith is when God speaks to you personally and whatever God has spoken to you that is how you think in other words come to church you hear the word of God God speaks to you you don't leave here and say well I just forgot that it was a good service we'll have a good day see you later God bless you no you take and you live you think soberly you think according to the faith that he spoke to you in that service because he wants you to carry it out don't think for a second God wants you to sit here in your nature not to get changed that might be what you want but that is not the mind of God we need the fear of God we need to get moved by the Holy Ghost you'll never regret it your flesh May hate it but your soul inside don't think of yourself more highly than you ought to think think soberly second Timothy 1:7 For God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind that's soberly because Jesus went to the Cross now you have access to the power of love the power of a sound mind but you have to be the one that says I'm not going to be wishy-washy anymore I'm not going to do my will God's will my will God's will my will God's will I'm going to actually pay attention to what God's speaking to me at church and I'm going to leave the building and I'm going to please God Amen God has given you the spirit of aound mind you're God is not giving the spirit of fear well I don't know if I can do this I you know I'm just afraid if I try then you know I'll blow up and you know so why should I just even try that's a spirit of fear on you that is absolutely a spirit of fear I'm gonna tell you a spirit of Faith a spirit of faith says when you fall seven times seven times you're going to get back up I am not afraid of falling if I was afraid of falling I wouldn't even be trying because I know I'm going to fall I know it what did the prophet mean about backsliding under times a day I think we just need to gain control of our minds think soberly think sound God give me God gave me this promise I receive it I got a sound mind I'll tell you when you got a sound mind how many would want to buy a brand new car and put spaghetti sauce in the gas tank you don't want that garbage why would we want or allow the thoughts of the devil to entertain us in our mind we got a sound mind but you know what it don't stay sound You're The Keeper of the house amen you're the keeper you're the one that chooses want the word or it doesn't matter if I don't have the word and I tell you when you have that attitude you're going down your spiritual life is going down the more you don't have boundaries or the more you make boundaries I'm going to tell you I'm going to tell you about your boundaries your boundaries are up and down every one of us here because they're based on emotions that's why one minute you can love somebody and the next minute you just I can't I I want to talk to them anymore right that's not a sound mine sound mine is I love them all the time amen no matter how they treat me praise the Lord thank you Jesus God has given us the power of a sign sound mind but it's our responsibility to keep it sober we've got to cast down our negative thinking yes I don't like what he said take a moment and find out is that what he said or is that what God Said any any thought that would kind of puff you up and exalt you and make you feel like you're something better than some you got to cast that down right through the cross we have the power to Humble ourselves in the sight of the lord we and we have the promise that he will exalt Us in due season he that exalteth himself shall be abased he that humbles himself shall be exalted right amen the way up Up Is Down a cross gives us access to God turn with me if you would to Romans chapter 5 verses one and two and we're not going to be able to get through everything you know I good thing I didn't say you know I just want to take my time this morning and U go an extra hour or to can you can you imagine I I I I try so hard to just only do but it just never never happen so you know when you pray for me just make it part of your prayer Lord let it be you know condensed when brother John is ministering like condensed milk you know you get a whole gallon in a can you know what I'm saying all right the cherubin have been ordered to step back and let everyone that is of a humble and contrite spirit come to Christ did you know that Romans 51 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God so whatever your life needs whatever you're Desiring you have access by faith into God's Grace Grace is all we need Grace is what saved us we didn't we didn't ask God to come down from glory to save us right it wasn't in our minds it wasn't in our thoughts it was Grace and today he has Grace for us whatever our needs whatever our desire is that we want God to have in our lives he's given us access he's asked us to come boldly Before the Throne the scripture tells us there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit right now the key here is your motive when you take your step has to be I want to walk with Jesus amen I want to do his will I want to treat people I want to love people I want to reach out to people am to a person whose heart and mind is in that Spirit of thinking there's no condemnation but if we're in a mindset well I don't really need to do that it's not church church is in it to Wednesday I can kind of do what I want to do well then there's going to be condemnation in your mind are you with me we have to be willing to walk after Christ we just can't sit around we have a work to do John 628 then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God I want to work the works of God what do I got to do and Jesus answered and said to them this is the work of God that you believe on him who have sent and if you believe as the scripture said that you will keep adding you will keep you you will add because you believe in the power of the Cross God works when we work the gospel works if we believe it brother briam said in the message my new minist my new ministry he says when he looked upon the apostles and he looked upon the Harvest he said the Harvest is ripe and the laborers are few pray the Lord of the Harvest that he will send laborers into the Harvest he says how many remember that well why would you have to pray to the Lord of the Harvest to send laborers into the Harvest if the lord of the Harvest was standing there knowing it would be done why God has so arranged it amen we put up that that that that quote there God has so arranged it that his well you just listen to this God has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and I yes and as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do we're paralyzing his program but when the church moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we are in God's will doing his program so we have a work to do when God speaks I'll just say God is not a God that when he speaks he doesn't care what you do he is a God that let you do what you want to do but his will is for us to do what he tells us to do and if we don't do what he tells us to do you paralyze God in your life how is God gonna how is if you belong to God now if you belong to God how is God going to bless you he's not going to now if you don't belong to God he may Bless you that's right that's right because he prospers the wicked right that it certainly but the thing is it's not about getting blessed or not getting blessed it's really about walking with Christ by loving your husband that's what it's all about we have to believe enough to put our faith into action 1 Thessalonians 2:13 maybe we just have to wrap this up real quick for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when you received the word of God which you heard of us you receed received it not as it was the word of just men but as it is in truth it's the word of God now there it is right here which effectually worketh also in you that belief so it worked in the apostles it worked in Paul but it'll work in you too if you believe we're transformed by accepting the word into our mind pondering it long enough that it drops into our heart and says God I want this for my life and then it begins to work out and becomes manifested and that is the power the divine power of the Cross amen there are so many scriptures that we're just going to like let them go let's stand together last one 2 Corinthians 3 17 now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty the Lord doesn't go where he's not welcomed amen he goes where he feels a liberty to be there am we had brother jera Jeremiah over our house yesterday praise the Lord he's helping us and we did everything that we could to let him know you're welcome come come come whatever you want stay for dinner we shot shot some hoops we wanted him to have Liberty so he would feel welcome if we turn down part of God's word we not giv him Liberty so by us worship and say God come into my heart Come Into My Heart Lord give me all of your word help me to live it you're giving God Liberty are you with me now the Lord is that Spirit where're the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty but we all with open face beholding as a glass the glory of the Lord we're changed into the very same image of Jesus Christ from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord amen we need the Holy Spirit I'm going to tell you you know what the the holy spirit is it is this word this is the holy spirit when and this is it so often we want more Holy Ghost right it's like sometimes we want the Holy Ghost without obeying the word and that's I'm say this is this is so easy when you receive the word just one word you can't receive that word without receiving the Holy Ghost because they're one and the same now I know we're going after a a fullness of the Holy Ghost I understand that but look sometimes it comes a drop at a time a word at a time a scripture at a time a service at a time but don't try to receive the Holy Ghost without receiving the word that'll just grieve the Lord give them Liberty receive the word into your heart amen amen let's bow our hearts and we'll sing a few songs amen maybe there'd be someone here today that says brother John God knows God knows my heart he knows the stand I'm taken today the word is had an effect I want to draw close to him and take this word just remember me in prayer if you would just raise your hands I want to pray with you God bless these hands amen God God sees your desire it's all about a relationship amen amen our heavenly father Lord I come to you with my my hands and my heart lifted to you as well we thank you for bringing us out of the world it certainly is an awful place today thank you Jesus thank you we thank you for the price that you paid at Calvary and certainly when you said it is finished it is finished there was nothing more that needed to be done the price for Redemption was paid now Lord you've left it into our hands to to activate the power that is in that cross to become into the image of your of your son and to become completely born again to see our nature changed from Glory unto Glory we thank you Lord that we're amongst the people that believe in the power of God they believe in this same gospel Lord that we still have access to and I pray for every every hand that was lifted the very sincere heart behind that hand Lord no matter how small that desire is or how great it is I pray Lord that You' give it to them because Lord they have put their faith in you you said he that cometh to me I will in no wise despise you won't turn him down lord we have a full expect expectation that what we have prayed for what we have desired that you truly are here you are looking down upon our hearts today bring to pass Lord even exceed above what they were asking for Lord May somewhere through the course of the day even the course of the week May they be reminded of this moment Lord they took that step toward you that you're going to keep your promise towards them Lord that you're going to bless them and may they come back may they be that one leper that comes back to give you praise and honor may they be that one Lord to go home get on their knees and say God thank you for the desire you rep placed him thank you that I'm thinking about you thank you for putting that song in my heart today thank you for wanting me to act the way you want me to act help us to be those grateful children Lord in the days to come we commit Our Lives into your hands now and we thank you for these things for we humbly pray in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen let's sing at the cross at the cross [Music] last and Did My Savior Bleed and did my sovereign D would he devote that sred head for such a worm as I at the cross at the cross where I first saw the light and the burden
