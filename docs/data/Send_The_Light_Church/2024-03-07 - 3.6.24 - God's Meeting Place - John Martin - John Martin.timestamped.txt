[4:12] amen that should be the thing that
[4:15] we we tell all the more because we only
[4:19] got a little bit more time to tell am
[4:23] brother Johnson you could see his desire
[4:25] to
[4:27] just to be used by God
[4:30] to tell about
[4:32] Jesus and I think that is a Priceless
[4:37] desire
[4:43] to I if God carries I want to wear out
[4:47] for
[4:48] Jesus If he if Jesus carries I want to
[4:52] wear I want to
[4:53] be doing all that I can do for him
[4:56] because he's done everything for me amen

[5:40] well he also wanted to thank you for
[5:43] your support for the Bibles that are uh
[5:47] the need is met um for Mala there's a
[5:51] number of um a couple different number
[5:54] of pastors that had grouped together to

[6:00] uh that he just he just been blessed the
[6:02] needs have been met so uh he wanted to
[6:05] share his Thanksgiving to you for your
[6:08] support and he really feels when they
[6:10] get the Bibles there's going to a a
[6:12] Revival is going to strike out over
[6:14] there so he's got that that
[6:16] Vision um brother Jason dears who who
[6:20] you know we're uh supporting it left
[6:22] today for Israel in Egypt so let's
[6:24] remember his trip there that God would
[6:27] Prosper it amen
[6:30] well if you have your Bibles and You'
[6:31] like to turn with me today to uh Psalms
[6:35] 23 we just want to just take a look at
[6:39] the Psalms in a maybe a little different
[6:42] light than I've ever uh seen it
[6:45] before uh but Psalms 23 is actually the
[6:49] they say the most popular and Best Loved
[6:51] Psalms for
[6:54] funerals it adds uh strength and hope uh
[6:59] to the Souls that are left
[7:01] behind um I've often uh looked at this
[7:04] Psalms is not just for someone that dies
[7:07] naturally but when they
[7:10] die uh uh in to their flesh to their
[7:14] fleshly nature their fleshly
[7:16] will and tonight we want to just uh take
[7:20] another onion another peel off the onion
[7:23] as it were to this
[7:25] Revelation and and uh look at uh psalm
[7:29] 23 and dying out when we come to
[7:33] church and it just really shines a
[7:36] little bit of light that I hadn't quite
[7:38] seen before so let's let's keep that in
[7:41] mind as we read this and then have we'll
[7:44] have a word of prayer Psalms 23 the Lord
[7:46] is my shepherd I shall not want he
[7:49] maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures
[7:53] he leadth me beside Still Waters he
[7:56] restoreth my soul he leadth me in Paths
[7:59] of righteousness for his name's sake and
[8:02] yay though I walk through the valley of
[8:04] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[8:07] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[8:10] staff they comfort me thou preparest a
[8:14] table before me in the presence of my
[8:17] enemies thou anointest my head with oil
[8:20] my cup runneth over surely goodness and
[8:23] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[8:26] life and I will dwell in the house of
[8:28] the Lord forever amen want to entitle
[8:31] this God's meeting place let's look to
[8:33] the Lord in a word of prayer Heavenly
[8:35] Father Lord we thank you for the
[8:37] faithful that have gathered out Lord
[8:40] this midweek service and going through
[8:45] uh some much difficulty uh many uh miles
[8:51] Lord just to be here in your
[8:54] house and father there are are uh many
[9:00] that are are sick at home Lord that
[9:03] can't be here today because of
[9:06] sickness and Lord you see that we're a
[9:09] very needy people we just ask that your
[9:12] presence would be with us and with each
[9:15] family in their
[9:17] homes and Lord that you would you would
[9:20] meet with them for you promis that if
[9:23] just two or three would be gathered
[9:25] together you would be you would meet
[9:26] right with them in that place Lord
[9:30] that meeting place under the shed blood
[9:33] of
[9:34] Calvary Lord we pray that you would give
[9:37] us something through these scriptures
[9:39] that might help us to to be closer to
[9:44] you when we do meet with you father when
[9:46] we come to church break the bread of
[9:48] life as only you can today and Lord
[9:51] we'll be careful to give you the praise
[9:53] for all these things for we ask it in
[9:55] Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless
[9:59] you may be
[10:02] seated well as we know there's been a
[10:05] great falling away in this hour there's
[10:09] also been a great falling away from the
[10:12] church and after Co had hit uh more
[10:15] people stay away from church than ever
[10:18] before but God has minished the True
[10:22] Believer to endure to the end to be
[10:26] faithful to the end to hold our begin in
[10:29] confidence steadfast to the end Hebrews
[10:32] tells us 10: 25 not forsaking the
[10:37] assembling of ourselves together as the
[10:40] manner of some is but to exhort one
[10:44] another to exhort one another that puts
[10:46] the responsibility in all of us amen and
[10:49] so much the more as you see the day
[10:52] approaching amen well we know the day is
[10:56] approaching amen I'll be before we can
[10:59] meet God we have learned through the
[11:02] message that God has some
[11:05] requirements we just can't approach god
[11:08] with some any old attitude and expect
[11:11] his grace that's right James 4:6 says
[11:15] wherefore he saith he saith God
[11:19] resisteth the proud but giveth grace to
[11:23] the humble amen so we've got to approach
[11:26] him uh humbly amen amen can you say
[11:30] amen and another thing that we want to
[11:32] think about is even though he is he has
[11:35] told us to cast our cares upon Him
[11:39] coming to church is not all about
[11:41] us in other words God has a will for our
[11:45] lives and we need to remember that when
[11:47] we come into God's house now Psalms 100
[11:51] verse2 says serve the Lord with gladness
[11:55] come before his presence with singing
[11:57] know ye that the Lord he is God he it is
[12:01] that made us and we and and not we
[12:04] ourselves we are his people the Sheep of
[12:07] his
[12:08] pasture and look at this enter into his
[12:12] gates with Thanksgiving and into his
[12:15] courts with praise be thankful unto him
[12:18] and bless his name for the Lord is good
[12:22] as Mercy is Everlasting his truth
[12:24] endureth to all generations so we see
[12:26] here there is a a an entrance that needs
[12:30] to be made when we come into the
[12:32] presence of God
[12:35] uh we just can't come without this
[12:38] because this is a
[12:41] requirement we know the Old Testament
[12:44] they had to make sacrifices for their
[12:46] sins before they could before they could
[12:49] enter in further into the sanctuary is
[12:53] that a true statement amen and we know
[12:56] that Christ became our Eternal sacrifice
[13:01] so we do not offer those types of
[13:04] sacrifices now our sacrifice is now
[13:07] giving thanks to the one who made that
[13:10] Sacrifice by entering into his gates
[13:13] with Thanksgiving and into his courts
[13:15] with praise Hebrews 13 F 15 says by him
[13:19] therefore let us offer the sacrifice of
[13:23] praise to God continually that is the
[13:25] fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
[13:28] name but to do good and to communicate
[13:33] forget not for what such sacrifices God
[13:36] is well please I think sometimes we can
[13:38] come to church and we can forget about
[13:40] to praise Him forget to communicate to
[13:43] him the way that we should see it's not
[13:46] about just us coming to church for what
[13:48] we want it's about coming to church to
[13:50] give God what he's worthy amen amen
[13:55] verse 17 obey them which have the rule
[13:57] over you and submit yourselves
[14:00] uh for they watch for your souls as they
[14:02] must give an account that they may do it
[14:05] with joy and not with grief for it is
[14:07] unprofitable for
[14:10] you so coming to church without being
[14:14] prepared to offer your best sacrifice to
[14:17] God is being
[14:20] proud I hate to say it you may be tired
[14:23] you may feel like I just had a bad day
[14:26] you it does not matter
[14:29] God deserves to be praised that's it
[14:31] that's all there is to it there's
[14:33] there's nothing more to the situation it
[14:35] just doesn't matter God deserves to be
[14:37] praised no does not matter how we
[14:41] feel and if we come without that
[14:45] sacrifice and we come with that I say
[14:48] it's a proud Spirit we just don't
[14:49] recognize it God has every right to
[14:53] resist our request whatever reason we've
[14:56] come to
[14:57] church Jesus himself said the father is
[15:00] is searching for them that will worship
[15:03] Him in spirit and in truth so God is
[15:06] looking for that God is looking for that
[15:09] praise we got to be on the same page
[15:11] with God and give him that praise when
[15:13] we come in to meet with God
[15:15] Amen so now we've entered into church
[15:18] with this sobering humble Spirit we've
[15:22] come in with grateful Hearts we've come
[15:24] in with praise we've come in with
[15:26] Thanksgiving we come in with gladness I
[15:28] was glad when they said unto me let us
[15:30] go to the house of the Lord and and we
[15:33] have this reverence and this great resp
[15:36] respect for God's word and now we enter
[15:40] into the Psalms the Lord is my shepherd
[15:44] I shall not want
[15:49] amen this reverence this respect it's
[15:53] not about what I want it's about what he
[15:57] wants for me that's
[15:59] right Jesus said in John 10:14 I am the
[16:04] Good Shepherd and know my sheep and am
[16:07] known of mine so there's there is some
[16:10] sort of connection there's a deep
[16:12] calling to the Deep we know the voice of
[16:14] God it's his
[16:16] word right and when the word is spoken
[16:19] to the Sheep they catch it so there's a
[16:21] communication going on John 10:7 then
[16:25] said Jesus unto them verily verily I say
[16:28] you I am the door of the
[16:31] sheep I am the
[16:34] door in other words if we want to meet
[16:37] with God we've got to come through Jesus
[16:40] Christ we've got to come through the
[16:42] word we've got to come through him it's
[16:44] not how we feel what we think we have no
[16:47] specialness with
[16:49] God we all come to the door
[16:52] amen all that ever came before me now
[16:56] this is think about this verse eight all
[16:59] that ever came before me they're thieves
[17:00] and
[17:04] robbers in other
[17:07] words they may say the Lord is my
[17:10] shepherd I
[17:14] want they don't they they they're not
[17:17] coming to church with the right motive
[17:21] I'm
[17:22] sorry you know we can come to church and
[17:25] said well he'll give me the desire of my
[17:27] heart and and we can lay this whole
[17:30] list but there's more to church than
[17:32] that that's all I'm saying there's more
[17:35] to church than
[17:37] that coming to commune with god with
[17:41] selfish reasons all that ever came
[17:45] before me in other words the people are
[17:47] coming before the
[17:49] Lord but they're coming with selfish
[17:55] reasons and we think it's it's okay I'm
[17:57] still coming to God he ought to be happy
[18:00] with
[18:02] me he's happy when we have this
[18:07] reverence and respect that the Lord is
[18:09] my shepherd I shall not want we can't
[18:13] deviate from that when we come into the
[18:15] house of the
[18:17] Lord he said I am the door and by me if
[18:21] any man will enter in he shall be saved
[18:24] and shall go in and out and find green
[18:28] pasture but that's what we do when we
[18:31] come to to God's house to hear the word
[18:33] right is to feed on the
[18:36] word after Jesus foretold that he was
[18:40] going to suffer many things and be
[18:42] rejected he said to all the people in
[18:45] Luke 9 verse 23 If any man will come
[18:48] after me let him deny himself take up
[18:52] his cross and follow me in other words
[18:55] Jesus was teaching them right there cuz
[18:57] he is the shepherd
[18:59] he's the Good Shepherd he's the great
[19:01] shepherd He Is Our Shepherd he was
[19:04] teaching them not to
[19:07] want to deny
[19:10] yourself it's not about our will that
[19:14] the Bible teaches us we should say if it
[19:18] would be the will the Lord will do this
[19:20] and we'll do that now I'm just going to
[19:22] do this no if it would be the will of
[19:25] God because not everything that I
[19:28] thought was the will of God for me was
[19:31] the will of God in fact I found out it
[19:34] was wrong and it got me in
[19:36] trouble look what happened to uh Sarah
[19:40] and Abraham and
[19:43] Hagar thought it was the will of the
[19:45] Lord so it's a serious thing the Lord is
[19:50] my shepherd I shall not want now notice
[19:54] this verse two verse two he maketh me to
[19:59] lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me
[20:03] beside Still Waters he restoreth my soul
[20:07] he leadth me into Paths of righteousness
[20:10] for his name's sake It's All About Him
[20:16] leading me to the house of God
[20:22] Amen I'm so grateful that the Lord is
[20:26] the really the one that's in control of
[20:28] the
[20:30] Bride
[20:31] amen he maketh me to lie down in other
[20:35] words our flesh is flesh if our flesh
[20:38] had its way we wouldn't be here at
[20:40] church
[20:41] today it's a
[20:43] truth if we thought we could get away
[20:46] and and and being the bride and and and
[20:50] and and and and only have to go to
[20:53] church you know once or twice a
[20:56] year I believe that there would be a
[20:58] group now that would believe that and
[21:01] only do
[21:02] that not the Bride of course but you
[21:07] understand because we're all we're like
[21:08] a mix we're we're mixed but it's he that
[21:12] maketh us to lie down in Green Pastures
[21:15] he's the one that's leading us you know
[21:18] we we come into church and no matter how
[21:20] busy the day is we all sudden we just we
[21:22] just sit and we subject ourself to the
[21:25] word we just calm down
[21:28] it's him leading Us beside Still Waters
[21:31] we don't have to worry about somebody
[21:33] coming in here and and doing jumping
[21:36] jacks and you know making a a confusion
[21:39] in the church because God is leading us
[21:42] to a place of order amen and look at
[21:45] this verse three he restoreth my soul
[21:49] every time we come into the church we
[21:52] hear the word of God God's word is being
[21:54] preached to us our nature is being
[21:57] changed what is happening he's
[21:59] restoring it isn't just uh it isn't just
[22:02] well he saved my soul back at Calvary he
[22:04] saved my soul you know 10 years ago when
[22:06] I got baptized no that every time we are
[22:10] changed by uh from from one Glory unto
[22:14] another when the word is being preached
[22:16] if you really receive that word into
[22:18] your heart it will change your character
[22:20] amen it will change you and it will
[22:23] restore your soul to be just like the
[22:25] the the character of Jesus Christ
[22:29] he leadeth me in Paths of righteousness
[22:31] so we here we're going to hear the word
[22:33] of God if we believe the word of God
[22:35] that word that he's speaking to us is
[22:37] going to lead us in a path of righteous
[22:40] living when we leave
[22:43] here Psalms to
[22:46] me happens when we go to church I
[22:49] believe
[22:51] that now the purpose of meeting
[22:56] God hey I want us to think about our
[23:00] purpose and the purpose of meeting with
[23:04] God as the high priest as the priest
[23:08] would go further into the Tabernacle
[23:11] remember it was you had the outside
[23:13] Court the inner court or the holy place
[23:15] and then then you had the holiest of
[23:18] holies now as you enter deeper into the
[23:24] Tabernacle shall we say the holiest of
[23:26] holies it is a type of when we come in
[23:31] to here that we enter in deeper into the
[23:34] spirit of God we're no longer just
[23:37] sitting here in church you know brother
[23:39] BR talked about us being in a three-
[23:41] room house
[23:43] amen and and and he said that that that
[23:47] outside place where you're you're just
[23:49] eating uh that's just like coming to the
[23:51] church and you're hearing the
[23:53] word right but he says you want that
[23:57] communion to get real close you you go
[23:59] into the living room and you sit down
[24:01] and you converse with one
[24:04] another and you get to know one another
[24:07] more but he said there's no life there
[24:10] comes there life comes forth when you go
[24:13] into the
[24:15] bedroom and so as we come into the
[24:17] church we hear the word but we've got to
[24:20] enter deeper into the spirit of that
[24:22] word it's got to become personal to
[24:26] us or otherwise were missing the purpose
[24:29] of meeting with
[24:32] God so inside the holiest was the
[24:35] holiest of all was the Ark of the
[24:37] Covenant inside the ark was the very
[24:40] life of God that's where Aaron's bod uh
[24:44] Rod buted it was where the Mana was
[24:48] always fresh it never got
[24:50] mold and the Arc of the Covenant the the
[24:53] the testimony of God the word of God was
[24:56] inside of that
[24:59] and God placed a mercy seat on top of
[25:02] that
[25:03] Ark and and at uh above that or at each
[25:09] end of that he placed two cherubin on
[25:12] The Mercy Seat amen
[25:14] yes and he said in Exodus
[25:18] 25:22 and there I will meet with
[25:24] thee and I will commune with thee from
[25:28] Above The Mercy
[25:30] Seat from between the two cherubin which
[25:33] are upon the Ark of the Covenant now
[25:36] what's he going to commune about this is
[25:39] important of all things which I will
[25:43] give thee in commandment unto the
[25:46] children of
[25:49] Israel notice there's no communion going
[25:53] on about what they
[25:56] want nothing
[25:59] there the whole communion was what God
[26:02] was going to speak to them
[26:05] right this is an
[26:07] important important thing to understand
[26:09] when we come into church we don't
[26:11] reverence the word enough we don't
[26:13] reverence enough what God is speaking to
[26:16] us and I'm not saying pointing any
[26:19] fingers directly to you but there's a
[26:21] looseness of a spirit that would just
[26:24] have us to come into church and not
[26:25] reverence the word enough
[26:29] I say this is to me the this the reason
[26:32] that the serious believer comes to
[26:33] church because he wants to hear directly
[26:36] from God brother brandom said it like
[26:38] this we come to church to find out where
[26:41] we stand with God where we're at with
[26:44] God which is is lining up right
[26:48] here
[26:50] with these
[26:52] scriptures God wants to commune with us
[26:55] AB about his will for our personal lives
[26:59] he says I stand at the door and I
[27:03] knock If any man will hear hear his
[27:06] voice open the door he'll come in he'll
[27:08] commune there'll be that communing it's
[27:11] it happens here in the heart it don't
[27:13] happen in this
[27:16] building it happens in the heart the
[27:18] word affects the heart the what's
[27:22] happening inside it's bearing witness
[27:24] that this is the Holy Ghost this is God
[27:26] speaking to me if none go with me still
[27:29] I'll follow there's a realness that
[27:31] takes
[27:33] place sometimes our reasons for coming
[27:35] to church are not the same as
[27:39] God's in other words sometimes we act
[27:42] like God hasn't created us for his
[27:46] purpose we forget
[27:49] that so if I ask you the question why
[27:52] did the Lord lead you to this church I
[27:55] know sometimes I get in trouble for
[27:56] asking questions question sometimes but
[27:58] you know Jesus asked a lot of questions
[28:02] brother Brandon asked a lot of
[28:04] questions I like to ask questions to
[28:07] kind of provoke
[28:09] thoughts so you don't have to answer
[28:12] them but why did the Lord lead you to
[28:15] this
[28:16] church what was his purpose in doing
[28:21] that what you to think about that was it
[28:24] was it to straighten things out here
[28:29] was it to sit on the seat of the
[28:31] scornful and find
[28:33] fault was it just to be part of a
[28:35] community of
[28:37] Fellowship was it to have a place to
[28:40] feel better about yourself your choices
[28:42] or the lifestyle that you're that you
[28:44] want to live what was the reason the
[28:48] Lord LED you
[28:56] here why did the Lord lead you here why
[29:00] I believe it's
[29:02] because it's God's desire is to get us
[29:06] the
[29:08] truth the way that God works his desire
[29:11] his nature is literally to see all of us
[29:14] walking in more truth than we did
[29:21] yesterday that that this is a hard pill
[29:24] to swallow for
[29:26] some
[29:28] because we want to feel like we've
[29:31] achieved we're in we're there and it's
[29:35] not about being in or
[29:37] out it's about walking
[29:40] pleasing and we are
[29:43] missing part of God in our
[29:46] life in the aspect of walking just like
[29:50] he walked living just thinking like he
[29:53] thinks acting living for others there's
[29:56] we we we know that the God who created
[30:00] heaven lives inside of us we know that
[30:04] we're not missing that but we are
[30:08] missing being able to yield all of our
[30:11] life to
[30:12] God and the devil tells us on a regular
[30:15] basis that we live for
[30:17] God and and and we're always doing the
[30:20] best that we
[30:21] can when I know that I'm not doing the
[30:24] best I
[30:26] can so so now look it's not for me to
[30:30] tell you what you should be living
[30:33] more it's it's up to the job of the Holy
[30:37] Ghost to speak to our hearts and show us
[30:40] what we should be doing
[30:42] more I believe that God wants us to grow
[30:46] in the love of God to grow into the
[30:48] statue of a perfect man to keep adding
[30:51] the virtues of Christ to our character
[30:54] to keep moving on to Perfection as the
[30:57] ible says to walk in more truth today
[31:00] than we did yesterday as it were to walk
[31:03] in more truth than what we're presently
[31:05] walking and now this statement should
[31:07] challenge
[31:10] us John said in third John verse four he
[31:14] says I have no Greater Joy than to hear
[31:19] that my children walk in
[31:22] truth and I know you know at any given
[31:25] time any of us could say well I'm
[31:27] walking in this
[31:29] truth but what about the other part of
[31:31] our life that has been refusing to do
[31:34] what God's been asking us to do what
[31:37] about that part God's concerned about
[31:39] that part we may not be thinking about
[31:42] that part that's why it gets so easy for
[31:44] us to come into to church sometimes why
[31:46] people come into church sometimes and
[31:48] they don't have that reverence and that
[31:50] respect for the
[31:52] word and they're going to miss out
[31:56] they're going to miss out on their soul
[31:57] being
[31:59] restored it really because it takes us
[32:02] uniting with the word yielding to the
[32:04] word dying to our to our fleshly will to
[32:08] see that character come to to
[32:11] manifestation God is on a mission to
[32:14] totally restore our
[32:17] soul he restoreth My Soul David said and
[32:22] I believe that is when our
[32:25] character is the character of Jesus
[32:29] Christ it you don't got to go through
[32:31] the course of a day to see well you know
[32:33] I kind of messed up
[32:35] there didn't brother bradam say we me we
[32:37] backslide 100 times a day all of us have
[32:40] no problem looking at where we could
[32:43] have done better right I mean just just
[32:45] being honest so we can see that there is
[32:47] a greater need for God's the preeminence
[32:50] of the Holy Ghost to be in our life and
[32:53] I believe this comes from when we
[32:56] receive the The Living
[32:58] Word Jesus said my words are spirit and
[33:01] they are life now we can hear the
[33:03] natural word we can agree with it we can
[33:04] read it we can memorize it but when that
[33:06] word becomes
[33:08] living now David said this statement he
[33:10] says I hide Thy word in my heart I hide
[33:13] it here in the heart so I may not sin
[33:17] against thee amen so you know that takes
[33:22] effort because the devil is trying to
[33:24] say oh you don't need that you're fine
[33:26] you're you're
[33:28] good but I
[33:30] know there's none good no not
[33:34] one Jesus said in John
[33:37] 8:31 he said to this he I'll just read
[33:41] it he said then Jesus then said Jesus to
[33:44] those which believed on him so he had a
[33:47] believing audience these were Believers
[33:51] that believed on him and he said if you
[33:55] continue in my word then are ye my
[34:00] disciples
[34:02] indeed God is not a God to not give us
[34:06] more light he is not a God to do that
[34:10] his nature is to see us in His image he
[34:13] created man in His image he wants us to
[34:16] walk like he walks talk like he lay down
[34:18] our life like he laid down his life give
[34:21] give
[34:23] give and ye shall know the truth
[34:27] and the truth shall make you
[34:31] free we don't got time but you know what
[34:34] these these these uh Pharisees were
[34:37] saying after this they said well we're
[34:39] already
[34:41] free you preach that to a message church
[34:44] and they say who are you I'm already
[34:46] free see that
[34:49] Spirit there's being honest yeah I'm
[34:53] free but yet I see that there's things
[34:56] what Paul say I I I I I go to do things
[34:59] that I don't want to do I want to do
[35:01] things but I I don't end up doing them
[35:05] there's there there's that battle so I
[35:07] think that in itself should should cause
[35:09] us to want to Hunger for More Of God in
[35:12] our lives and not just say well we're
[35:14] always going to be like that till the
[35:15] Rapture comes that's not a good
[35:19] attitude John
[35:22] 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of
[35:25] Truth has come he will guide you
[35:29] into what what's that word all
[35:35] Truth for he shall not speak of
[35:38] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[35:41] that shall he speak and he will show
[35:44] thee show you things to
[35:49] come God leted us and guided
[35:53] us to to the to the message to the word
[35:57] to
[35:59] him how many times have we heard of
[36:02] people say yeah I I got baptized I I I
[36:06] gave my life to God and they're they're
[36:08] they're living in the world you know
[36:10] what I'm saying right but the very
[36:12] nature of God is to lead them into all
[36:17] truth he's thinking about it when
[36:19] they're
[36:21] not so the purpose that God has has done
[36:26] this led us to this plac is that that he
[36:29] could give us more light that we could
[36:31] walk
[36:32] in I believe
[36:35] that now the Bible says Jesus said he
[36:39] will show you things to come well what
[36:41] things what's he going to show
[36:44] us the most important thing I believe
[36:47] that he could show us is who we
[36:53] are the ministry the the Malachi for the
[36:56] message that was sent is to show the
[36:59] bride who she
[37:02] is I believe that brother bam said that
[37:06] God would raise up a minist the
[37:09] Ministries to to break things down and
[37:12] to to help
[37:14] them dig deeper so she could recognize
[37:17] because when she recognizes who she is
[37:21] then she's an invincible Army
[37:24] right so I believe that the things that
[37:27] God is trying to show us through the
[37:29] ministry is who we are to
[37:33] become who we are to become we're not
[37:35] there yet but and I'll tell you it's
[37:39] hid it's
[37:41] hid right because the flesh is looking
[37:45] for this great manifestation here and
[37:48] there and God said it will not be a
[37:51] public
[37:52] show it won't
[37:54] be it'll be hid
[37:59] it's going to be those who love the word
[38:00] who's willing to die out to the flesh to
[38:03] become the
[38:04] word 1 John 3:2 said beloved now are we
[38:08] the sons of God and it does not yet
[38:11] appear what we shall be but we know that
[38:13] when he shall appear we shall be like
[38:16] him for we shall see him as he is we're
[38:19] going to be like him I believe that's
[38:21] what he's trying to show us as he's
[38:23] opening the word this isn't just a bunch
[38:25] of instructions that the Bible says or
[38:27] the bunch of instructions that brother
[38:29] John wants us to do or the these
[38:31] ministers want us to do no this is what
[38:34] the bride is going to
[38:36] become now the foolish virgin says no
[38:39] way I ain't going to do that I don't
[38:40] have to do that are are you with me you
[38:43] see the two Spirits out there that are
[38:46] that are
[38:47] battling the word is showing who the
[38:51] bride
[38:52] is who she really is because remember
[38:56] there are many that
[38:58] claim brother bah told that story in the
[39:00] choosing of a bride where all these uh
[39:04] women uh thought that this Cowboy Rich
[39:07] Cowboy or whatever was going to marry
[39:10] them choose
[39:12] them they had this
[39:15] confidence yes he's going to choose me
[39:17] he's going to choose
[39:19] me but they didn't have the
[39:22] spirit they didn't have that humble
[39:25] spirit
[39:27] a and and and God chose that little
[39:30] woman just willing to take the back seat
[39:33] willing to keep working in the
[39:37] background she had character amen amen
[39:41] First Corinthians 2:9 I'm just going to
[39:44] read it you don't have to turn there you
[39:46] all know the scripture but as it is
[39:47] written ey have not seen ear is not
[39:49] heard neither have it entered into the
[39:51] heart of man the things which God had
[39:54] prepared for them that love him amen
[39:57] prise Lord look at this next verse but
[40:01] God have revealed them unto us by his
[40:07] spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[40:10] things yeay the Deep things of God we
[40:12] come here God is trying to show us
[40:16] things that are to come in our lives the
[40:18] nature that we're going to have how
[40:20] we're going to be Overcomers amen praise
[40:23] God how we can not let the devil just h
[40:26] over us and and and and and Hold Us Down
[40:29] with depression and sickness and and all
[40:32] this stuff that he's made us more than
[40:35] conquerors he's showing us things to
[40:37] come this word is
[40:39] powerful amen Jesus said the spirit of
[40:43] truth will show us things to
[40:47] come and John said every man that has
[40:50] this hope in him purifies himself even
[40:54] as he is pure
[40:57] Amen brother Braham said in the message
[40:59] the law having a shadow he said for God
[41:02] has made a sacrifice to perfect every
[41:06] believer that's in Jesus
[41:09] Christ God has made a sacrifice to
[41:13] perfect every believer that's in Jesus
[41:16] Christ Jesus is that
[41:19] sacrifice and every man that has this
[41:22] hope purifies himself he has a part to
[41:27] play and that's taking the word of God
[41:30] that we hear and obeying it right amen
[41:35] coming under subjection to it not well I
[41:39] don't know if I agree with it I don't I
[41:41] don't know if I see it that way I wasn't
[41:44] really really taught that way that just
[41:47] really doesn't fit into my
[41:50] schedule it can't do that the word is
[41:54] supreme over all of us right the word is
[41:57] the headship of all of us this church
[42:00] our ideas our opinions what we want what
[42:03] we don't want God is the head it's all
[42:07] there is to it the final say
[42:11] so for God so loved the world that he
[42:15] gave his only begotten son to the
[42:18] church can you say
[42:21] Amen all right we got to get you know
[42:24] we're we're missing some people here
[42:26] so that means we got to do double duty
[42:30] you know double
[42:31] duty with amens all right Ephesians
[42:36] 5:26 I hope they put this on the board
[42:39] Ephesians all right now look at this the
[42:42] word is in church for a
[42:44] reason he says that he might sanctify he
[42:48] he he gave his only begotten son to the
[42:50] church that he might
[42:52] sanctify and cleanse it
[43:03] I thought he did that at
[43:06] Calvary well the Bible says here with
[43:10] the washing of the Water by the
[43:15] word there's something that happens in
[43:18] church
[43:21] that's because of Calvary the Holy Ghost
[43:24] could come back upon the believer in the
[43:27] church
[43:30] right the word be becomes real to the
[43:35] believer can enter inside the Living
[43:38] Word enters inside of the
[43:42] believer cleanses him washes him
[43:45] purifies
[43:47] him fills
[43:49] him the word does a job when we come to
[43:54] church it's not there for knowledge we
[43:56] don't it's not about getting head
[43:59] knowledge it's not about learning
[44:01] another another mystery or something no
[44:04] it's about a cleansing that's taking
[44:06] place a washing so we need to feel that
[44:10] I need to be washed we need to know why
[44:12] we're
[44:13] here you know too often we get these
[44:15] hoty attitudes of just you know what I
[44:17] just don't feel good after that
[44:24] preaching do you what you're saying when
[44:28] you think those
[44:32] thoughts that he might present to
[44:36] himself a glorious
[44:39] church not having a
[44:42] spot not having a
[44:44] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[44:48] should be holy and without blemish I am
[44:51] not
[44:53] there I am not there I am not there I
[44:57] haven't been
[44:59] there but I'm pressing in that's all I
[45:02] know to do I don't know to do anything
[45:08] else Paul said who wrote 14 books that
[45:11] you and I preach out of that believe was
[45:15] still pressing towards a Mark that he
[45:17] hadn't attained
[45:19] to who am I to come into the church and
[45:22] feel like I'm there yes the Lord's my
[45:24] shepherd and here's the list of the
[45:26] things that I want from the Lord
[45:29] today what about the things the Lord
[45:31] wants us to
[45:33] do are you with me all right John
[45:39] 17:15 I pray Jesus praying here I pray
[45:43] not that thou should us take them out of
[45:45] the
[45:46] world but that thou should us keep them
[45:50] from the
[45:52] evil that's in the
[45:54] world verse 17
[45:57] sanctify them through thy truth Thy word
[46:04] is
[46:05] truth we've got to look beyond what
[46:08] Christ did for us at Calvary and look to
[46:12] where Christ is at
[46:14] today did not brother Brandon say man
[46:18] has a a a paraphrasing a terrible habit
[46:22] he's always looking at what God did do
[46:24] or what God is going to do and is
[46:26] missing what God is trying to do right
[46:29] now and I understand we do not have the
[46:32] that that gift flowing that brother
[46:34] brandom had but you know what God's
[46:37] still
[46:38] here he's promised to be where just two
[46:41] would be gathered together in his
[46:43] name I want to just say this how could
[46:46] you think God's not here when you
[46:48] brought him with you God is here and he
[46:51] wants to accomplish his purpose and his
[46:54] will but we understand we've got to let
[46:57] this be the house that God made it
[47:01] for in the message hear ye him brother
[47:04] bam says now I want to ask you a
[47:06] question right here where we're at be
[47:10] honest don't you just feel kind of
[47:13] scoured out and made different he says
[47:16] do you he said raise your hand just
[47:20] feels like the Holy Spirit has just
[47:23] cleansed our hearts
[47:26] when the word just cleanses us from all
[47:29] we are this is the washing of the water
[47:33] of Separation by the word the word what
[47:37] washes us and cleanses us and then he
[47:40] quotes Jesus sanctify them Father
[47:43] through thy truth he said Thy word is
[47:45] truth is that
[47:47] right and we're washed of the Waters of
[47:50] separation from our sins by the word of
[47:54] God the word separates us and sets us in
[47:58] place he said how wonderful now I just
[48:00] want to just say this for a second okay
[48:03] we come to church we get in the prayer
[48:05] room and we say
[48:06] God would you be merciful to me and
[48:10] cleanse me of my sins cover me with your
[48:13] Holy Blood and make me ready to hear
[48:17] your word we do that and so we feel as
[48:20] prepared as we could be when we enter
[48:22] into the sanctuary and we come into the
[48:24] sanctuary and we're hearing the word and
[48:26] God speaks something and all a sudden
[48:28] your heart goes whoa whoa whoa whoa
[48:33] whoa because there's something there
[48:35] that God wants us to deal with you
[48:38] understand generally we can ask God to
[48:40] cleanse us and he will but if there's
[48:43] something God's wanting us to deal with
[48:45] it's because he wants our character to
[48:47] be like
[48:48] his and it's it's not just um to to
[48:53] confess that thing
[48:56] but to wash our life from it you
[48:59] understand to wa to separate there's a
[49:01] separation from that thing he said the
[49:03] Waters of Separation so it's a real
[49:06] meeting place that happens between us
[49:08] and God if I come over your house you
[49:10] come over my house we can just you know
[49:12] as it were shoot the breeze have fun
[49:13] talk about anything you want to talk
[49:15] about and we can laugh and we can have
[49:17] fun but when we come into God's house
[49:19] see this is where God has the
[49:21] preeminence in all of our
[49:23] hearts to speak his will to
[49:28] us Braham said in the message the Queen
[49:31] of
[49:33] Sheba he said after his finished word
[49:37] then he sent into the church first
[49:39] apostles prophets evangelist pastors and
[49:41] so forth in his church
[49:44] to perfect the
[49:47] church it's not to get what we want it's
[49:51] not to come to church with all different
[49:53] reasons it's for the purpose purpose he
[49:56] sent them
[49:57] for and I'm not trying to do away with
[50:00] casting our needs upon him I'm just
[50:03] trying to get the the priorities
[50:06] right the priority needs to be the Lord
[50:10] is my shepherd I shall not want he
[50:12] maketh me to lay down in green
[50:14] presentant he leadth me besides Still
[50:16] Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me
[50:19] in Paths of righteousness for his name's
[50:21] sake it's all about him getting me ready
[50:26] to be a bride without spot without
[50:30] wrinkle Psalms 34:1 says I will bless
[50:34] the Lord at all
[50:36] times his praise shall continually be in
[50:39] my
[50:40] mouth and look at verse two my soul not
[50:44] my flesh not my carnal nature my soul
[50:47] shall make her boast in the
[50:51] Lord in other words our soul should be
[50:54] able to rejoice in the word even though
[50:58] our flesh is being
[51:02] corrected now look The Humble shall hear
[51:07] therefore and be glad well who won't be
[51:10] glad who won't be
[51:13] glad
[51:14] huh the proud those that those that
[51:18] aren't here with the right attitude with
[51:20] the right Spirit they're they're not
[51:22] going to be glad that they came amen oh
[51:26] magnify the Lord with me and let us
[51:28] exalt his name
[51:30] together all right the Lord is my
[51:32] shepherd I shall not want he maketh me
[51:35] to lie down and G pastures he leth me
[51:37] beside Still Water restoreth my soul he
[51:39] leadth me in Paths of righteousness for
[51:40] his name say verse
[51:42] four yay though I walk through the
[51:46] valley of the shadow of death I will
[51:49] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[51:54] rod and thy staff they comfort
[52:02] me God gives us his word as a staff to
[52:07] lean
[52:08] upon to help hold us up brother the
[52:11] Johnson was up
[52:14] here and he's leaning upon his staff it
[52:18] was given him
[52:20] support he lifted up in the air and said
[52:23] if I end up going somewhere
[52:25] I'm going to have to take this with
[52:28] me and the word of God is there so we
[52:31] can lean upon it amen it supports us
[52:35] when we're weak and we're feebleminded
[52:37] when we come to
[52:39] church he holds us up his he his his
[52:43] grace his word is has Grace in it when
[52:46] we haven't been able to pray through
[52:50] right he has Grace for us he has Mercy
[52:52] for us when we fallen short of his glory
[52:55] so his word is a staff that we can lean
[52:59] upon that Comforts us praise
[53:01] God but his word that comes forth over
[53:05] the
[53:06] pulpit is also a rod of
[53:12] correction we should have heard a lot
[53:14] more amens with that I I don't know what
[53:17] happened on that one but the the Bible
[53:20] said thy rod and thy staff they comfort
[53:23] me now we can't forget
[53:26] this I believe his Rod should comfort
[53:33] us I it's the one thing I just I just
[53:36] really I just
[53:38] love about brother vman's
[53:41] testimony and I don't mean to just bring
[53:43] him up but just just because he's made
[53:46] mention of it
[53:47] and he just feels so good when the word
[53:51] corrects his
[53:53] life it just it makes him feel closer to
[53:57] God that that God cares enough to to
[54:01] help them and
[54:04] uh the the word of God is a rod of
[54:09] Correction now we know there's going to
[54:12] be a great white Throne judgment right
[54:14] every knee is going to Bow every
[54:16] tongue's going to confess we're all
[54:17] going to the whole world's going to have
[54:19] to give an account to God one
[54:22] day and what are they going to give an
[54:24] account they're going to give an account
[54:26] whether they live their life for themsel
[54:28] or they live their life for
[54:32] God now I'm going to say the
[54:36] unwilling they will be there to give an
[54:41] account but for the genuine believer the
[54:43] bride of Christ does she stand there in
[54:46] the white Throne
[54:48] judgment no she's sitting with the judge
[54:55] and judging those who were
[54:57] unwilling and they're even going to be
[54:59] judging the Fallen
[55:02] Angels now the genuine bride she does go
[55:06] to the great Throne of
[55:09] judgment every time she comes to
[55:14] church 1 Peter 4:17 says for the time is
[55:18] come that judgment must begin where at
[55:23] the house of God Amen
[55:25] and if it first began at us who are
[55:30] willing to subject themselves to the
[55:32] word of God what shall the end of them
[55:35] that obey not the
[55:37] gospel and if the righteous scarcely be
[55:41] saved where shall the ungodly and The
[55:43] Sinner
[55:44] appear so this this is a house of
[55:50] correction and to the believer they're
[55:54] grateful amen they've come because they
[55:57] want to be pleasing to
[56:01] God but you know the world churches have
[56:06] made Church something different than
[56:09] what it is
[56:11] now they want to be
[56:14] entertained they want to just feel
[56:17] good don't say anything that don't make
[56:20] them feel
[56:21] good I've heard that some preachers will
[56:24] not preach certain things because
[56:27] everybody will leave the
[56:31] church they're they're they want a
[56:34] meeting place but they're not meeting
[56:36] with God we we we learn in Revelations
[56:38] 13 they actually kick God out of the
[56:40] church they're having a meeting place
[56:42] without God they're just meeting with
[56:45] one another a a lodge a a a fellowship
[56:49] of
[56:51] men in other words they don't care
[56:55] about being pleasing to
[56:59] God they have need of enough the Bible
[57:02] says in need of
[57:04] nothing so when God corrects us and we
[57:08] take that correction willingly we say
[57:12] yes Lord you know what we're doing we're
[57:15] willingly walking through the valley of
[57:18] the shadow of
[57:19] death we're dying out to our will we're
[57:23] dying out to the flesh that wants to
[57:29] be having its own
[57:33] way and we have to be willing to walk
[57:36] that
[57:37] walk so when we walk through that Valley
[57:40] we're choosing to die out to our will
[57:43] when God gives us his word we're we're
[57:45] willingly we're choosing the harder way
[57:48] we're choosing to deny ourselves to pick
[57:50] up our cross to follow him we're
[57:52] choosing his word of above our
[57:57] flesh how beautiful it is when God looks
[58:00] down and he sees his children walking
[58:03] through the shadow of the Val the Valley
[58:06] of the shadow of death I believe it's
[58:08] pleasing to
[58:10] God our natural our fleshly nature is
[58:15] literally dying out before his eyes
[58:19] because we're resisting our will and
[58:22] we're surrendering our will to God's
[58:25] word I believe he's pleased with
[58:28] it we just have to keep willing to come
[58:32] to
[58:33] church and walk through that Valley of
[58:35] the shadow of death amen now look what
[58:38] he says here when we're hearing the word
[58:40] and we're the word is telling us to to
[58:42] to do his will to die out to our fleshly
[58:46] wanting to just use our time and consume
[58:48] it for
[58:50] ourself he says I will fear no evil
[58:55] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[58:59] staff they comfort
[59:01] me we don't have to fear walking through
[59:06] this Valley just because it hurts us and
[59:08] we don't get to do what we want to do we
[59:10] don't get to make the plans we want and
[59:12] we don't it's okay it's okay he's with
[59:18] you I wouldn't trade that for
[59:21] anything I'd give everything up but I
[59:24] could not give up
[59:26] him couldn't give up this
[59:29] word the correction of God ought to
[59:33] comfort
[59:35] us I'm not going to fear what God wants
[59:38] me to do I believe the Bible says great
[59:41] peace have they that love thy law and
[59:43] nothing shall offend them they're so in
[59:47] love with the
[59:51] word so when we come to church God has
[59:55] prepared a message for
[59:57] us God has a table spread where the
[1:00:00] saints of God are fed come and dine the
[1:00:02] master cth amen it's a five course
[1:00:06] meal as it were I believe it has
[1:00:09] everything that God wants us to have
[1:00:11] amen now sometimes you know this little
[1:00:15] children when they're up at the table
[1:00:17] and it's time to eat um uh children that
[1:00:22] are immature they will say something
[1:00:25] like this oh do we have to eat that I
[1:00:29] wanted to I wanted
[1:00:32] this right are you with me we all seen
[1:00:37] it but not the adults the adults are
[1:00:40] correcting the children they're saying
[1:00:43] this is what we have to eat today let's
[1:00:45] be thankful for what we have and let's
[1:00:47] eat this are you with me but it ain't no
[1:00:50] different when we come to
[1:00:53] church
[1:00:55] you can tell
[1:00:58] often who are the immature ones who
[1:01:01] don't want to eat the
[1:01:03] word you
[1:01:06] can and then you can tell the mature
[1:01:10] ones the mature ones they're always
[1:01:12] saying thank you for the
[1:01:18] meal it's it's a blessing brother
[1:01:20] Johnson I wish I wish honestly if I
[1:01:25] could go back to the very
[1:01:28] beginning I as a young
[1:01:30] Christian I just wish I would have never
[1:01:33] ever left the service without saying
[1:01:35] thank you for the
[1:01:37] word I can't remember how much I did or
[1:01:40] how much I didn't I just know being on
[1:01:43] this side I just try to make it a real
[1:01:47] strong point that when my wife or an
[1:01:50] make dinner to to to to not just say
[1:01:54] thank thank you but to talk about this
[1:01:56] meal took so long to
[1:01:59] make to carry some dishes to the
[1:02:03] sink to really give some Thanksgiving
[1:02:06] for the all the time that it took to
[1:02:08] prepare it amen I believe God takes time
[1:02:12] to get us the food it ain't brother John
[1:02:15] it's God giving us the food we need to
[1:02:18] be more thankful
[1:02:21] amen thou preparest a table verse five
[1:02:25] before me in the presence of my
[1:02:33] enemies who is our
[1:02:35] enemy we just learned that last service
[1:02:38] well we've learned it many times but
[1:02:40] who's our greatest enemy in church
[1:02:45] ourselves and God has given us a five
[1:02:48] course meal right in the presence of our
[1:02:51] enemy our enemy don't want to hear this
[1:02:53] word our enemy don't want to die out our
[1:02:57] enemy don't want to be corrected our
[1:02:59] enemy you don't want to know what our
[1:03:00] enemy wants to hear you're the best
[1:03:02] thing that this world has ever
[1:03:07] seen you are such of a model
[1:03:12] [Laughter]
[1:03:14] Christian there there's there's you know
[1:03:16] what you weer just close the doors and
[1:03:18] go home you're so you're so sold up I
[1:03:22] don't know what we're doing here wasting
[1:03:23] our time we're so like
[1:03:25] Jesus you understand I'm saying our our
[1:03:29] flesh Who We Love sometimes is our
[1:03:34] enemy but God prepares a table before me
[1:03:37] in the presence of my
[1:03:40] enemies thou anointest my head with oil
[1:03:44] and my cup runneth
[1:03:50] over what destroys our
[1:03:53] enemy
[1:03:55] it's when the Holy Ghost enters
[1:03:59] in when the Holy Ghost comes inside and
[1:04:03] takes the
[1:04:04] preeminence your flesh has no control at
[1:04:08] all that's the
[1:04:11] truth the more you get filled with God
[1:04:15] the more your cup runs so you're so
[1:04:18] filled that your cup runs
[1:04:21] over look your enemy can't do a thing
[1:04:25] brother Brandon said the devil can't do
[1:04:26] anything unless he's got a vessel to
[1:04:28] work through and if you're so full of
[1:04:30] God the devil can't do
[1:04:32] nothing
[1:04:34] amen I believe God wants to fill us with
[1:04:38] himself the fill our cup with the oil of
[1:04:42] Joy so full that it it runs over that
[1:04:45] it's bubbling it's
[1:04:47] bubbling but we've got to be willing to
[1:04:50] die out to our flesh in order for the
[1:04:52] Holy Ghost to come now we can have
[1:04:54] Services where God anointing can just go
[1:04:58] from one to the next on top and he'll
[1:05:00] Bless the people and that is wonderful
[1:05:02] but I am not talking about that I am
[1:05:04] talking about when you receive so much
[1:05:07] of God inside you're willing to keep
[1:05:09] these Commandments he comes inside and
[1:05:11] makes us a bold
[1:05:13] there that he'll stay with you in the
[1:05:16] days to
[1:05:19] come Isaiah 61:3 says to a appoint unto
[1:05:24] them that mourn in
[1:05:28] Zion to give unto them Beauty for
[1:05:32] Ashes the oil of joy for
[1:05:36] mourning the Garment of Praise for the
[1:05:39] spirit of
[1:05:41] heaviness that they might be Trees of
[1:05:45] Righteousness
[1:05:47] planted planning of the Lord the
[1:05:49] planning of the Lord that he might be
[1:05:52] glorified in the them amen don't you
[1:05:55] believe that I believe that this is what
[1:05:57] God wants us to do he wants to turn
[1:06:00] things around in our lives amen surely
[1:06:03] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[1:06:06] the days of my life and I will dwell in
[1:06:09] the house of the Lord
[1:06:14] forever where does the goodness of God
[1:06:17] lead us
[1:06:20] to surely goodness and mercy shall
[1:06:22] follow me all the days of my life
[1:06:24] where does the goodness of God lead us
[1:06:27] to the Bible says the goodness of God
[1:06:30] leads us to
[1:06:33] repentance I don't be zalias therefore
[1:06:37] repent find
[1:06:40] something to repent for find
[1:06:45] something God is in the restoration
[1:06:48] business and it all must be through free
[1:06:51] more
[1:06:53] agency remember brother bam said he
[1:06:57] said you can't wait till the doors are
[1:06:59] open that's right you can't wait I I
[1:07:03] think about the the sacrifices that are
[1:07:05] made to come to church
[1:07:08] and you
[1:07:10] know I believe God is well pleased with
[1:07:13] the
[1:07:14] sacrifice when we give our best to be in
[1:07:18] the house of the Lord I believe God is
[1:07:22] pleased with it
[1:07:25] amen now I have some
[1:07:29] quotes I'm really done with Psalms 23
[1:07:34] praise the
[1:07:35] Lord I believe when you read 20 Psalms
[1:07:39] 23 I want you to think about what
[1:07:42] transpires when you come to
[1:07:48] church and I would like to I would like
[1:07:50] to read some quotes if I could just get
[1:07:52] a few a little bit of a time but but if
[1:07:56] I can I
[1:07:58] understand
[1:07:59] now when we come to church we feel we're
[1:08:03] in pretty decent shape when we come to
[1:08:07] church but here is what we got to
[1:08:12] remember there's usually
[1:08:15] things that we are not aware
[1:08:19] of brother BR said in the Harvest time
[1:08:21] he said what is the biggest lie that was
[1:08:23] ever told he said it's got
[1:08:26] 99% truth in
[1:08:31] it the True Vine and the false Vine but
[1:08:35] when it comes to the place when it's got
[1:08:37] about
[1:08:38] 99% truth and 1% lie that's the
[1:08:42] deceiving type that's the kind you got
[1:08:45] to watch is them kind and that's that's
[1:08:49] just what the devil's good at he told
[1:08:52] Eve everything truth but but one thing
[1:08:55] in the message Unity of God in the in
[1:08:57] the one
[1:08:59] church he said and so deceiving is the
[1:09:02] wrong thing now excuse me a lie if it's
[1:09:07] just right out a real lie then anybody
[1:09:10] can detect
[1:09:11] it but that lie that comes about 99%
[1:09:15] truth in it that's the one that's
[1:09:19] deceiving did you notice how the devil
[1:09:22] deceived Eve every everything he told
[1:09:24] her was exactly the truth but one thing
[1:09:28] said your eyes will be open you shall
[1:09:30] know right and wrong and so forth and
[1:09:33] you shall be as gods and because uh you
[1:09:35] don't know what's right from wrong now
[1:09:38] but you will see all those things were
[1:09:41] true but when she said the Lord said we
[1:09:46] would die he said surely you won't die
[1:09:50] see just so much truth in it and then
[1:09:54] just a little bit of a lie why am I
[1:09:57] saying these scriptures
[1:09:59] because because out there the devil is
[1:10:03] speaking to us all the time and you know
[1:10:05] what he's speaking 99% truth because he
[1:10:10] knows we know the truth right so he has
[1:10:13] to tell us mainly the
[1:10:16] truth in the message Oneness now
[1:10:18] remember the devil takes a whole lot of
[1:10:20] the word pretty near 99 and 9 % of it 99
[1:10:27] hunds and 99% of that
[1:10:30] hund he'll make it just
[1:10:33] exactly but then he'll jump off of there
[1:10:36] and that's the one that causes death
[1:10:38] right there yes that breaks the chain
[1:10:41] right in the middle down you go every
[1:10:44] word what Jesus uh what did Jesus say
[1:10:48] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:10:49] every word not by a few of God's words
[1:10:53] shall you live that's right but by 99
[1:10:56] and 99% of God's worth no but by every
[1:11:01] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:11:03] God man shall live by
[1:11:05] that that's how important it is for us
[1:11:08] to want to come in and hear the rest of
[1:11:10] the word that the devil hasn't been
[1:11:12] telling
[1:11:15] us what shall I do what Jesus called
[1:11:19] Christ Eve had the
[1:11:22] word Satan is against the word and look
[1:11:25] almost 99 and 99 hundreds of it Satan
[1:11:28] admitted it was right so close the Bible
[1:11:30] said in the last days would deceive the
[1:11:32] very elect if it were possible see how
[1:11:35] it comes in how it's always been how
[1:11:38] it's been going out the same way United
[1:11:42] of unbelief in all the full word of God
[1:11:45] you got
[1:11:46] it that's what brought death is the
[1:11:49] uniting of unbelief with the
[1:11:51] word unbelief just a little bit part of
[1:11:55] it a little bit teeny bit one 100th of
[1:11:59] 1% but it must be 100% the
[1:12:04] word see we're here come because we want
[1:12:08] to see the devil exposed in our
[1:12:13] life all right brother Bram said in the
[1:12:15] message presuming he said I only got one
[1:12:18] more page on this so just so you know
[1:12:22] let's he said in the message presuming
[1:12:25] let's presume
[1:12:26] nothing stay with the word and God is
[1:12:30] obligated to make it he said that word
[1:12:35] is a
[1:12:36] seed and that word will bring forth
[1:12:39] everything it promised to bring
[1:12:43] forth it'll do it it'll take the world
[1:12:47] out of
[1:12:48] you he said it will sanctify you it'll
[1:12:53] make you live a different life it'll
[1:12:56] make you do things you thought you
[1:12:58] couldn't do because it's the word in
[1:13:02] you don't presume you have it watch your
[1:13:07] life I love this honestly I I could come
[1:13:12] up here and never say a word except just
[1:13:13] read brother
[1:13:14] brandom but listen to this don't presume
[1:13:17] you have it watch your life what great
[1:13:20] advice the prophet's telling us and
[1:13:22] measure up and see what your life is see
[1:13:26] the way you're living see if you're in
[1:13:28] the faith search it out and see if
[1:13:31] everything is going just right see if
[1:13:35] the world still got a
[1:13:37] love so much it'll call you away from
[1:13:40] the things is really of God to love the
[1:13:43] world if it is brother check up right
[1:13:47] stop right here Satan you take that
[1:13:51] dirty thing back I'll not rece receive
[1:13:53] it he
[1:13:55] said well over at soul and Soul's Church
[1:13:58] they can do that brother so and so lets
[1:14:02] his people brother Bram says I don't
[1:14:05] care what brother so and so does the
[1:14:07] word says not to do it that settles it
[1:14:10] that's right so let's not compare with
[1:14:13] anybody
[1:14:15] else brother Bram said in God's only
[1:14:18] place provided place of worship he said
[1:14:21] now bread is a type Jesus said man shall
[1:14:23] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:14:25] word of God not not just a word here and
[1:14:30] there denomination would be would have
[1:14:33] you to believe it but the word of God is
[1:14:36] perfect it's God himself in letter
[1:14:41] form called a
[1:14:44] seed and the right kind of un
[1:14:47] adulterated faith in the word will make
[1:14:52] will bring the Pro seed to its life so
[1:14:55] here we are we all come to
[1:14:57] church we all want that life inside of
[1:15:00] us what's needing is one thing that you
[1:15:04] believe it like you've never believed it
[1:15:07] before that you believe it's personally
[1:15:09] for you that you mix it with a personal
[1:15:17] faith God keeps his word brother BR says
[1:15:20] but if you're baptized into this big
[1:15:23] arcade then stay with it till God
[1:15:26] confirms the word in you sure he'll give
[1:15:28] it to you it's what you look at looking
[1:15:31] at the word the word will bring you
[1:15:34] peace wasn't that the
[1:15:36] first song or chorus that Brother Bruce
[1:15:39] saying the word will bring you peace
[1:15:41] amen the word will bring you Deliverance
[1:15:45] the word brings you exactly what you
[1:15:47] have need of God always keeps his
[1:15:50] word in the message the seed is not erir
[1:15:53] with the shock I only got two more he
[1:15:56] said the stalk Hagar two wives doubted
[1:15:59] the promise but
[1:16:03] watch but watch that brought forth but
[1:16:07] watch what that brought forth when Hagar
[1:16:10] the second wife of Abraham which was
[1:16:13] just absolutely a concubine wife but she
[1:16:17] brought forth a man but what kind of man
[1:16:20] was he
[1:16:22] question the Bible said he was a wild
[1:16:25] man he lived by his bow and no man would
[1:16:29] conquer him he was
[1:16:33] untameable unconvertible
[1:16:37] unregenerated he could not be tamed he
[1:16:40] was a wild man because he was
[1:16:43] contrary to God's
[1:16:47] word and anything that's contrary any
[1:16:50] preacher any lay member any church
[1:16:54] that's contrary to the word of God will
[1:16:56] bring forth a wild adulterous bunch of
[1:17:00] worldly Hollywood and cannot stay with
[1:17:02] an unadulterated word because it's not
[1:17:05] even included in the
[1:17:09] promise we got to stay with the word
[1:17:11] that's what the prophet's
[1:17:13] saying 100% last one message Shalom
[1:17:16] brother bam said oh yes let's stand
[1:17:19] together oh yes he permits crosses and I
[1:17:24] want you to I want you to listen very
[1:17:25] closely to this quote he permits crosses
[1:17:30] that's us baren
[1:17:32] across Crossroads Junctions he always
[1:17:36] does that in order to perfect us for his
[1:17:44] service I love this quote he permits
[1:17:50] those things to happen he says can't you
[1:17:53] you understand that he does that so he
[1:17:57] can perfect you for the calling he has
[1:18:01] called you
[1:18:03] for that's your growing pains he did he
[1:18:08] did Daniel that way you know so I just
[1:18:11] think about we go through test we go
[1:18:14] through trials things do not happen the
[1:18:17] right way in our life things go wrong
[1:18:20] things go sour things go belly up but we
[1:18:25] there's one group of
[1:18:28] people that he
[1:18:30] promised that these things would happen
[1:18:33] so you could fulfill your
[1:18:35] calling is't that
[1:18:38] beautiful how important it is to stay
[1:18:42] with the word stay with coming to church
[1:18:45] get a hold as many people as you can and
[1:18:48] tell them the hour is later than we
[1:18:52] think
[1:18:53] whatever we got to go through the hedges
[1:18:55] the byways whatever we got to do bring
[1:18:57] them
[1:18:59] in because they listen to the news they
[1:19:02] listen to the TV they got their friends
[1:19:04] and none of them are telling them 100%
[1:19:06] truth am none of
[1:19:09] them they need to hear all the truth
[1:19:12] because that's what we need in this hour
[1:19:16] is all the truth amen amen is that your
[1:19:20] desire amen let's let's bow before the
[1:19:24] Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we thank
[1:19:26] you Lord that you have given us the
[1:19:29] greatest thing that you could give us
[1:19:30] and that was your word you've never lied
[1:19:33] you've never failed you've never come
[1:19:35] short there'll be no man
[1:19:38] ever on the day of judgment we'll be
[1:19:41] able to say that you came short of your
[1:19:45] word even Thy word declares that Thy
[1:19:48] word will not return unto you void but
[1:19:51] it will accomplish what you sent it
[1:19:54] for and Lord we know that as we come to
[1:19:57] church
[1:19:59] Lord you we know
[1:20:02] that your
[1:20:04] word it's for the whole world to
[1:20:08] whomsoever will receive
[1:20:10] it but we know there's only one group
[1:20:13] that will receive
[1:20:16] it and Lord I pray that there
[1:20:20] would that those of us Lord that have
[1:20:25] made this their home church that believe
[1:20:28] this truth that you sent in this
[1:20:30] age Lord that not one of us would miss
[1:20:34] it
[1:20:36] Lord I
[1:20:38] pray Lord as the prophet made
[1:20:43] mention one time he
[1:20:46] said if you see me going down the
[1:20:51] Falls if you love me you'd hit me over
[1:20:53] the head and drag me
[1:20:59] out Lord wherever we're at with you
[1:21:02] whatever we get into in the days to come
[1:21:05] Lord let there not be one that would
[1:21:07] miss
[1:21:10] it Lord I pray God
[1:21:14] May whatever has to transpire in our
[1:21:17] lives to get 100% of this word inside of
[1:21:21] us Lord we don't want to just agree with
[1:21:24] this word we want to become this word
[1:21:27] because you said that we'll be just like
[1:21:29] you when you return we're holding on to
[1:21:32] that promise

[1:21:37] your word is preached here by the
[1:21:39] different ministers Lord that come

[1:21:44] dwelling place inside of us may it

[1:22:11] that you put us

[1:22:26] to to just continue to to reach out to
[1:22:29] others and not to to to to assume that
