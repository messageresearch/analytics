amen how many's happy to have brother Bruce like a special special blessing for the Bruce was in the back and just tell me he says you don't know I'm happy I'm gonna be he just said those words referring to his future in as he was walking back in the church with brother Ron y'all were singing about being happy and I just thought it was so perfect amen God hasn't expected in for all of us amen god bless you I am sorry I don't know you hi Jim Connie okay is this your first time it is well praise the Lord Jim and Connie god bless you we're so grateful to have you and we're so grateful for brother Marc inviting you we pray that you would just enjoy the service bless the word if you love the word of God you'll like being here because we love the Word of God above everything amen we'll turn with me if you would to the book of Saint Luke if you have a Bible it's always good to be with God's people amen Saint Luke chapter two we're going to begin reading with verse number eight through 14 then we'll have a word of Prayer but this is this is where the Angels introduced the Lord Jesus as a baby amen starting here with verse number eight and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you Is Born This Day in the City of David a savior which is Christ the Lord and this shall be a sign unto you he ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in the manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on earth peace and goodwill toward men amen let's just pray and ask God to bless this precious word to a seventy Father Lord were not even worthy to read your holy word it is the only book Lord that is perfectly true that we can have confidence in above every other book that's been written and Lord you've given us your word that we might have a roadmap how to get to heaven how to make sure that we be found pleasing in your sight and Lord we ask that you would take this scripture that we read Lord the scriptures that we will read Hereafter and Lord that you wouldn't reveal them to us and anoint them to us and help us to catch the meaning of the message that you have for us tonight for we desire in a heart to know you in a greater way Lord we commit this service and all of our hearts into your hands now come receive glory through everything that's said and done we pray in Jesus Christ precious name Amen amen god bless you may be seated usually this scripture would be taken at a Christmas time and rightly sold but today we want to take our text from verse 11 for unto you Is Born This Day in the City of David a savior which is Christ the Lord and we want to take for a subject today dividing Jesus in half to better understand our relationship with him we want entitle this message Savior or Lord and it's something maybe we we wouldn't want to do is divide Jesus in half but we want to to better understand our relationship with him jesus said in little further in this book in Luke chapter 6 verse 46 jesus said these words he said why call me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say so as we split Jesus right down the middle I want to talk about the two different relationships that we can have with Jesus most people know Jesus as a savior that no end they know them as a savior a savior is someone who rescues another from danger so whether we're rescuing a soul or we're getting rescued from losing our job or our home or our health or finances or a marriage or an accident we mostly know Jesus as someone who rescues us or saves us from really just a it seems like a manifold situations in her life a number of problems that were having we need a savior we need someone that will rescue us and help us with our situation and this is in really where most people know Jesus as a savior Jesus is good to all men Psalms 145 verse 9 says the Lord is good to all not just to some but to all Acts chapter 10 verse 34 says that God is no respecter person so he doesn't respect one person he you know he's not racist he's no respecter persons that James chapter 1 verse 5 the Bible says if any man if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him so God even gives out wisdom to those that just ask you got asking faith of course but but but that's the type of God he is that's the type of Savior he wants to to rescue and how Matthew chapter 7 verse 7 Jesus saying ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened Amen it's a promise that the Savior gives us most of our relationship with Christ is centered on the side of Christ who provides for us or who rescues us from so many problems in our life we know God in that way the Bible records many times people that Jesus had rescued them there were two thief's on the cross one asked and he received Jesus rescued him because he was asking remember me when you come into your kingdom the other just kind of mocked had a negative attitude the very last moment of his his life since he wasn't humble since he didn't believe he wasn't rescued so he never even got to know Jesus as the Savior there was a Greek Cyrille Phoenician woman she had a young daughter that was grievously mixed vexed by a devil and she cried Oh have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David but Jesus the Bible says did not answer her a word kind of a ignored he might say that Jesus was rude to her somebody don't answer you you think they're being rude and even the disciples were trying to tell Jesus would you just send her away so they were being rude it was a real confusing situation in church that day in Matthew 15 verse 24 but he answered and said I am NOT sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel can you imagine Jesus coming and saying I am not sent to you that's basically there was no hope he did not provide a hope for this woman but you know what it did turn her off the very next verse she came and worshiped him saying lord help me I need to be rescued amen and then Mark sat in chapter 7 I'm taking this from two different Gospels here chapter 7 verse number 27 but jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for it's not meet to take the children's bread and to cast it unto dogs oh my mind if that didn't offend her you know some people you know we can come to church robbing guilty of this another no not our visitors this is not to our visitors what I'm saying this is everybody else we've come to church and we hear something that just wasn't right and we can get offended by we need to have we need to learn from this woman of what pleased God in verse 28 and she answered and said unto her yes Lord yet the dogs under the table eat the children's cross in other words they didn't come right from Jesus but from his people that's pretty humbling and he said unto her in verse 29 for this saying now this is what I underlined that for this saying it was for what she said the attitude that she had go my way the devil is gone out of my daughter Jesus rescued a mother's daughter from a devil sickness there was a woman with a blood issue she was rescued she tried everybody else to rescue her lots of doctors could not get rescued but she tried Jesus and Jesus was the answer and he Jesus loves to help us no matter what her situation is not to be a little ones situation because God loves to help there was a Centurion that besieged Jesus one time for one of his servants have had palsy and Jesus was willing to come to his house and pray and rescue but he said no I'm not worthy I'm not worthy that you should come under my roof but if you just speak the my servant shall be healed and the seer Tyrion understood how authority works and this is important he himself did not have faith to heal the servant but he had faith in someone that was authority over the devil and that that's important and in verse 9 of Matthew chapter 8 verse 9 he says from a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth into this man come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he do with it and when Jesus heard he marveled and said to them that followed verily I say to you I've not found so great faith no not in Israel it wasn't his faith that he could do it it was his faith that Jesus could do it our faith needs to be in Jesus amen one time there were 10 lepers and Jesus rescued all of them no respecter persons but there was only one that came back and he wanted to work on his relationship we want to get into that Jesus said in mark chapter 9 and we know there's a lot of Scripture we don't have to go go to them but I want to at least quote some of them if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth he's no respecter of persons I ask and it shall be given God is good to everyone he's gracious he's merciful he's no respecter persons God will rescue even his enemies just like you guys you and me he loves his enemies he blesses them that curse him he does good to them that hate him and he is long-suffering towards them which despitefully use him and persecute him to those that take the name of the Lord in vain right that's the truth he maketh the Sun to rise on the evil and on the good he sends rain on the just and the unjust that is what our God is it's his character it's just who he is he loves to help if he could do that for his enemy we should really believe he wants to do that for us his children amen he would that all men would be saved the Bible says God can save us and rescue us from a multitude of situations in her life he's awesome we can testify of his amazing grace his saving grace of his faithfulness and still never know him as Lord and this is what I wanted to buy him today into to do from the house because so often we just kind of want to put him together and think they're the same awful quiet if we don't know him as Lord furthermore he will never know us as his Lord I'm going to say some things obviously maybe haven't heard of but I want you to I want you to think I want to provoke your relationship with Christ that's what we're doing here it's one thing to know Christ as a savior as a healer as a provider but it's totally different to know him as Lord you can know the saving grace of God and never come to know the side of Christ is Lord unto us is born unto us was born 2,000 years ago a savior which is Christ the Lord but we got to come to know him as Lord that word Lord means supreme in authority it means controller it means master and we're talking about our relationship with him we know as according to Philippians chapter 2 verse 9 the Bible says wherefore God also have highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name and that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father now Jesus Christ is Savior Jesus Christ is Lord the world can choose to ignore today the Ault but ultimately God will make sure to it that every knee is going to bow humbly reverently to Jesus and that every mouth will acknowledge what admit will agree Foley that's what it means to confess or profess that Jesus isn't Savior but he's Lord he's the supreme authority to the glory of God the Father before they go to hell what a privilege we have today to bow before him and call him Lord of lords and King of Kings willingly but the majority of the people will never experience that side of Jesus in fact very few will because Lord has everything to do with surrender your will to his that's what we want to get into the Lord has everything to do with your unconditional surrender to his will your desire is no longer for what you want the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want amen you have forfeited your wants and your desires is to you to you to heal completely to God's will your will is no longer on the forefront of your plans just like Jesus said not my will but thine be done you have forfeited your will and now your will is to achieve God's will as a subject to your Lord you're subject to your Lord you simply present yourself to the complete domain over you this is a totally different part of a relationship with Christ then God dealing with us with all the things that we want him to rescue in our life and I felt strong about this message for the aspect of us being able to understand the difference because so often when we see Jesus moved so graciously in her life and meet our needs we can't deny him amongst us but it has nothing to do necessarily with where our relationship is with God and as the Bride of Christ our relations he has to become Lord of our lives as foolish virgin no I don't have to but as bride he has to that's important so Paul was teaching lordship in in Romans chapter 12 verse 1 and 2 when he said I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present yourself your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service if somebody I went to work and they told me I want you just to present yourself just you just give your all and I don't want you taking the breaks now you just I want you to do exactly what I say don't make any mistakes and that your reasonable service and all I don't work here but Paul is calling this calling this a reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God now I'm not talking about what job you should take what car you should buy or what vacation you should go on I'm talking about giving yourself completely over to his will that you must prove that it's your reasonable service I'm talking about how you live your life out how you how you present yourself to be transformed into God's will we need to be able to prove it too often we we spend time proving things that is just God being good to us and gracious to us and and providing for us but I'm not really interested in you proving that it was God's will for you to have the house that you're in for the car that you drive for the job you're at for the boat you bought I'm interested in you proving how to live your life completely to the will of God because I got scripture for that I don't got scripture for the car you want let's take an example of this in 1st Peter chapter 2 and we're just going to talk about what's acceptable to God first so it is the will of God that with well doing you put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free not using your liberty as a cloak for maliciousness but as servants of God honor all men don't pick and choose love the Brotherhood fear God honor the King servants be subject to your masters with all fear Wow this is this is not a gift this takes the dying of your own will not only to the good and gentle but to also the froward for this is thank worthy if a man for conscious towards God now this is all about your your consciousness towards God your relationship with God if a man for conscience toward God endured grief suffering wrongfully for what good is it when you're buffeted for your own faults and you take it patiently but if when you do well and you suffer for it take it patiently this is acceptable with God so you're proving what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God I've got scripture here this is what I want you to prove I want you to prove to me this because this has to do with lordship not Savior you can rescue some you all the rescuing that God has done it's him and His goodness doing it but when you do this you're letting him use your life to prove out to who's ever watching that God gets all the glory see it's normal to prove someone's wrong when they're wrong right but don't be conformed to the world that's the way the world does it but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God it's not about buying the right boat for your life it's about you yielding your will to God's control for even unto here where you called look at verse 21 because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps God is not interested in seeing us suffer but the only way that character can be developed is if we're willing to suffer because character is not a gift it's a victory Matthew chapter 7 verse 21 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is neversea lordship comes with giving God pre-eminence let them have freedom as he has domain his will is first notice they're not saying Savior or rescuer they're saying Lord many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works many had access to the name of Jesus he is a provider a rescuer revealer to many believers his name is used to cast out devils his name is is used to talk about the future to prophesy the future but it has nothing to do with the relationship it has nothing to do with the part of Christ that's Lord and too many people want to claim Lord just because God used them in and provided for him and met their needs on the Savior side and then why profess unto them I never knew you relationship Lord Lord is about relationship when it comes down to the end of the road doing all of his will is the only thing that will matter the works think about all think about the children of Israel that died in the wilderness because Jesus himself said they all died in the wilderness right when they when they were saying they are our fathers eight men in the in the wilderness and Jesus said there everyone dead so at the end of the road what was important not forty years God provided for them saved them from the snakes and you know gaper gave them water and and and their shoes and wear out that didn't matter the and what mattered at the end is did they do the will fulfilling only part of God's will come short of lordship so this calling about lordship is it's a high calling it's not easy we should all be struggling to fulfill it [Music] the way I read the scriptures there's still things I'm struggling with every day in my life if I ignore those things right well I think I'm a pretty good Joel but when I realized that I need to do all of God's will I've got dying out to do I got surrendering to - I have no no no no authority to call him Lord maybe Savior lord help me with the situation but he's calling us to a lordship relationship where he can have dominion over us and what a privilege it is verse 24 therefore whoever we hear at these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken unto him waking on I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon the rock so I'll say it like this the more that you do what God tells you to do the more of a rock you're building your relationship with Christ with don't look at the things that you're already doing if you want a bill you have to look at the things you're not doing the rain descended the floods came the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock hey men well there was a lot of winds today wasn't there and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand the rains descend the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall event I'll just say it like this it's not a matter of whether we know what's right or wrong in tough situations that go on in our life what is necessary is that if you stand for Christ he'll stand for you if you're willing to suffer wrongfully this is acceptable to God it's your reasonable service so it's like you're building your relationship with God that's the rock it isn't like nothing's gonna happen to us no things are gonna happen to us bad things are gonna happen but we need Christ there yeah when we're all when we are born again we are born to do God's will that we probably heard that thousands of times but we're really born to manifest his will John 1:11 says he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received and to then gave he power to become sons of God even to them that believe on his name so we have to receive him receive the word which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor of the will man but of God I don't believe God would ever will and give birth to someone that would rebel against him it's just not in his nature so he has that expectation of us 1st Peter chapter 1 verse number 23 being born again not if the corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever second Corinthians chapter five verse ten sorry for so many scriptures tonight I guess there's more of a teaching than the preaching for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that every one may receive the things which he done his body according to what you have done whether it be good or bad so we're all coming before the judgment seat of Christ every one of us now we're fortunate because today at this very moment we are standing at the judgment seat of Christ we're willingly judging ourselves by the word that God gives us and if we judge ourselves proper which is on wrong and our right Lord then we will sit with him on the throne and judge everybody else who was unwilling to judge themselves verse 11 knowing therefore the terror of the Lord knowing the real situation about seriousness is we persuade men we're interested in helping other men not to be damned but we are made manifest unto God and Trust also are made manifest in your conscience so before others verse 14 for it's the love of Christ that constrains us to do this because we thus judge that have one died for all then we're all dead we don't have a will anymore right it's been forfeited verse fifteen in that he died for who for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves Benanti him which died for them and rose again so we see here that our will has been forfeited now we've given our will over to God and the relationship of lordship begins now here's the problem to many people like the children of Israel they were satisfied with how much God was in their life they didn't they never battled that God was with them the battle was that they that they had to continue on when in their flesh they didn't want to give up more of their will they thought they would lose their life by going and facing the Giants and a lot of times we were facing the enemy in her life that will those those habits whatever it might be we face those things and we were too afraid to deal with them because we we think that we can't overcome them to Christ but all we have to do is will to do God's will and God will fight our battles take men it's the truth I know it wasn't Joshua's strength in himself that took those giants it was his faith in golf right and we've got to believe greater is He that's in US and he that's in the world yes verse 16 wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more in other words we don't know him no more as this day this baby is born the relationship is in the spirit we know Christ by the spirit God is a spirit they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth so our relationship as lordship it happens in the spirit is not outwardly it gets manifested out early but it's it starts inside so therefore if any man is really in Christ he's no longer the same he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things become new and all things are of God now this is where every one of us are at were in this process of all things becoming new all of us can stand and testify of how many things are passed but is he Lord of everything as the song goes he sees now Lord until he's Lord of everything that Lord at all until he's Lord of everything because that's what it really means brother John what are you doing preaching telling me that Christ is not Lord of my life I am not telling you that yes what you're thinking and we we trust by the grace of God that God is speaking to us concerning the things that we need to surrender over to him all things are of God who reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and given to us a Ministry of reconciliation and you know I'm going to tell you the problem with John Martin is that the people the problem with John Martin is he don't want to do all of God's will the problem with John Martin is that he only wants to do most of God's will and I'm just that's right that's right that's the battle right there that we're in but as lordship he's given us a responsibility the greatest battle that we have is not allowing the devil to convince us that we don't have to do everything the word says brother Brandon said in a message convinced then concerned he said talking about Moses Moses likewise when he thought to take over down in Egypt and he killed that Egyptian had got unconcerned he wasn't concerned about it if God was going to be with him why wasn't he with him in other words it didn't happen the way that he planned it so when it didn't go his way he lost his concern so he went out he married a beautiful woman and so he had a baby by her Gershom and they were settled down and he was going to inherit a big flock of sheep out there from Jethro the midnight priest and he was everything was on easy street he would live with his wife and have a little home and you know just doing fine a good job well was going to be fall he was going to fall and everything was going to be alright he was unconcerned he didn't feel the taskmasters whip no more he wasn't concerned about his brethren down there about the poor midwives the women having their babies that a burst of their heads and thrown him to the crocodiles and now they made them serve hard down there in slavery and bondage he wasn't interested so he got to a place where he lost his concern he had his home pay for just like we do today that's the first thing we think about pay for a home he said that's good you ought to that's right but there is something ought to be come before that he said it's God God first and listen to this the going on of the church it's every man's duty in this church right here to see that that thing goes on right and you put your force to it to bring every man every woman boy and girl that you can in the streets and the hedges and the byways to bring him into the church we don't want to become what happened to Moses because things didn't go the way we worked on us how many times we tried to go out and share Jesus with somebody and they just you know totally made us feel like a heel made us to question come on maybe earlier in our on our in our Christian walk and then we kind of get discouraged and you think well maybe what I need is wisdom how I talk to them if I need to know more of the Bible maybe I gotta just give them and before you know it became so complexed and hard and we just kind of got discouraged from it yeah I am telling you the responsibility has not left us God still holds us accountable to the responsibility God is still concerned if God is living in us we will be concerned now I'm not questioning God's now Adina's what I in question in the is he lordship because too often we have that well God is in me as my savior I see him moving all these things in my life and you can't get in a question or doubt you know when I'm not trying to what I am trying to get across is a different relationship than what you have a different relationship Luke chapter 14 verse 26 if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children brothers and sisters ate his own life also he cannot be my disciple now that disciple was real important as we get into some scriptures coming up and whoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple verse 33 so likewise who suffer he be of youth that forsake not all that he had he cannot we're talking about a lordship relationship here why so many people ignore these scriptures is because they're satisfied with just seeing God in their life and rescue from the situation in that situation and they can say God is with me I believe in God but they're missing the part of God that we need to have in order to make a rapture John chapter 13 st. John chapter 13 verse number three my-my-my so many scriptures so many faults not enough time pray for me Jesus verse 3 Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and he went to God and he raises from supper and laid his side his garments and took a towel and girded himself and after they had forth water into a basin began to wash the disciples feet to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto Him Lord does that wash my feet I'm questioning you what you're doing and jesus answered and said to him what I do thou knowest not now well that was an obvious thing is you don't want to question God amen but thou shalt know Hereafter and Peter saith unto Him thou shall never wash my feet jesus answered if I watched be not thou has no part with me that's not good Simon Peter said unto Him Lord not my feet only but also my hands in my head and just keep it going and jesus saith unto Him he that has washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but it's clean everywhere and he are clean but at all Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say to you that this servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are he if he do them lives their situations and for okay about given our two sons you about how wrong your bad they are but for some reason there's no concern to get down on her knees pray to get a burden Lord show me how to help my sister my brother my enemy might my neighbor by my fellow co-worker whatever it might be if you don't do it you're not going to be happy God deserves such a joy for those that are willing to suffer for him when you think about Jesus as your Savior provider of all your needs or the rescue of your situations we need to realize there's more than one side to Jesus when we look at Jesus that way we're looking at Jesus he's the one doing all it's a one-sided relationship Jesus is doing all the sacrificing he's doing all the rescuing we pray lord help me comes in the house he's faithful he loves to do it he has no regrets none he's a joyful giver and sometimes we can get so carnal that we're breaking about that as if we found a greater favor than somebody else in the church let me just say like this you're just a better factor in your relationship if that's all you don't miss Savior you're just a benefactor and if you're lost praise God for salvation but we're not talking about that today we're talking about the maturity of our relationships with Christ now when we think of the other side of Jesus as the Lord of our lives then Jesus becomes the benefactor he becomes the benefactor why calls me Lord Lord and do not the things I say God has an input in the relationship he wants to take your body your life and he wants to use it to give himself glory no man can say that Jesus was lord but by the holy ghost it takes the Holy Ghost inside manifesting it out who the Lord really is because our flesh don't want to do it our flesh wants glory reputation look at me look God look what God look what God's doing through me I wouldn't be the Holy Ghost that would be John Martin's ghost [Music] lordship is more about perfecting our relationship with Christ as we decrease he increases when it becomes less about us and all about the Holy Ghost his will and his purpose Christ becomes the benefactor of the relationship he didn't save us for just the purpose so he could do all the providing he wants a relationship st. John chapter 14 helps us to understand more how to perfect a relationship from Savior the Lord you get time read that but in st. John chapter 14 verse 14 jesus said if ye shall ask anything in my name I will do it that's a rescuer that's one side the relationship but look at the very next verse if you love me do what I ask you to do this is the other side of the relationship where he becomes the benefactor there is a reason God wants you to do what he asked you to do he's getting something out of it he wants he's going to get something out of it he don't have you do things in vain there's some soul that he's got in mind somebody that's gonna get help [Music] he doesn't do things in vain there's a purpose verse 21 he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him when your relationship moves towards obeying the word you will come to know God more because he's gonna reveal himself more the promise here is if you if you keep his Commandments Jesus says we will come in the Holy Ghost God Almighty his name is Jesus he'll be your friend will come into you and will manifest himself in you now you can't make that happen you can't force it knowledge can't do it quoting the scriptures won't do it it's a love affair it's I'm willing to do what you ask me to do the reward is now you get to know Christ more you what is greater what greater thing could we have with God but to know him more to know God is beautiful it's life I'd rather know God more than any other thing Philippians chapter 3 verse number 10 I have to skip so much here but Paul speaking he says that I might know him and the power of his resurrection the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death that if by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the Dead there the only way we really know that Christ in the Fellowship of his sufferings is not by how much we suffer but how much we surrender our will because if you surrender your will you will be suffering yeah you you can't do the will of God on a flowery bed of ease you can't be an administrator you have to lay down your life you have to pick up your cross you have to get down and wash somebody's feet so they could really see the love of God people don't want to suffer but it takes suffering to know Christ if I'm going to love God the way that he tells me love is which is to obey Him I'm gonna have to suffer cuz my flesh don't want to my flesh does not want to obey no flesh does so why doesn't be crucified why why we have to die out die daily and to do that require suffering until we're in the new bodies yes we're gonna be battling amen I just write these down if because we don't have time to go from but first Peter chapter 3 verse 17 and 18 first Peter chapter 4 12 through 15 16 through 19 I guess that would be first Peter chapter 4 chapter chapter 4 verses 12 through 19 oh my my these scriptures talk about suffering that it is the will of God for us to suffer as a Christian and second Timothy chapter 2 verses 1 through 13 write that down spend some time reading that Paul was tellin Timothy to be strong in in the grace of the Lord Jesus endure hardness as a good soldier he he speaks that he himself suffers trouble as an evildoer therefore all things for the elects sake he endures well that's that ain't sitting on a you know a platform like this and enjoying yourself no therefore i endure all things for the elects sake that i may also that they may also obtain salvation see there's a purpose and our suffering is not for us just to be you know cramped into some do's and don'ts we're suffering that somebody can be saved if you can't see somebody else's salvation in your suffering you're looking at the situation wrong and he says in verse 12 if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we suffer we should also reign so it's a requirement it's a requirement for unto you is born two thousand years ago on the Sea of David a savior which is Christ the Lord you shall you shall find him when you seek for his shirt for him with all your heart love him with all your heart Colossians chapter 1 verse 17 and 18 I just want to close with this he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence God desiring the preeminence will not force it he'll continue to have a relationship with us as a savior rescue us from our situations anytime it's going to enter into the lordship we have to be willing to surrender our will with two gods what an opportunity we have to surrender our will to gods can I just read one more global okay this is just one more time brother grant said that don't mean a thing show showmanship we got too much Hollywood but it don't bring the spirit and the power of God down it might bring enthusiasm but it don't bring the power of God there they're not willing to pay the price Sampson prayed right what did he pray in closing I might say this Lord let me die with the enemy that's the trouble they don't want to pay the price of dying you got your owns your your ones your own self worked up into a community into a bunch of people that you associate with and play cards and stay home and watch programs and eat tater chips and drink cokes the church sits empty that's right make you sign a card you'll come six months out of the year Sunday school such a man-made enthusiam enthusiasm what you need is the Holy Ghost oh you say I got it you sure don't act like it yes sir let the preacher preach an hour or something other like that and you're ready to call the trustee board and throw him out that's right you want to eat your cake and keep it - he says you can't do that no sir he says you've got to surrender yourself you've got to pay the price you've got to get cleaned up and I tell you the whole church world needs a cleaning all the way from the pulpit to the janitor's room that's right
