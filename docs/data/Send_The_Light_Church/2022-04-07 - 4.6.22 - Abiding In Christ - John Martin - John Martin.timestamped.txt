[33:35] mid-week service if you turn with me in
[33:39] the book of saint john chapter
[33:41] 10
[33:42] and we're going to have three scripture
[33:44] readings
[33:45] before we're seated
[33:49] but we have
[33:50] an important subject i feel tonight to
[33:53] try to look at
[33:54] um
[33:59] abiding in christ i want to entitle this
[34:01] message i really didn't have a title for
[34:03] it until today but if i could say it
[34:06] like this
[34:07] it's a lot easier to get detached from
[34:10] god
[34:11] than we realize
[34:14] and uh
[34:15] i i just i want us to be secure i don't
[34:18] want us to miss it and that's why i want
[34:19] to go through these scriptures
[34:21] and
[34:23] for those that are not here those that
[34:24] are live streaming maybe they can
[34:28] also
[34:29] uh
[34:30] when they get a chance
[34:32] because it's for them as well amen let's
[34:34] let's just look to the lord in prayer
[34:36] before we begin reading heavenly father
[34:38] we're not worthy to even approach your
[34:41] word it is so
[34:43] holy
[34:44] so righteous so perfect and we are so
[34:47] unholy so
[34:48] unrighteous and so imperfect
[34:51] lord but
[34:52] you've given us grace you've covered us
[34:55] with your blood and
[34:57] and now lord we're asking that you give
[34:59] us eyes to see to catch the real meaning
[35:02] of your word tonight
[35:03] and god that you would uh
[35:07] give us revelation of the very point
[35:10] that your you would have for us lord
[35:12] because we don't want to miss it for
[35:15] anything lord
[35:16] we ask that you would uh take the
[35:20] any
[35:21] deceivingness that the enemy had tried
[35:24] to put on us
[35:26] uh lord that you just
[35:27] help our eyes to see where you want us
[35:30] to be and how you want us to be standing
[35:32] in this hour please bless your word lord
[35:35] as we read it now we commit the service
[35:38] with all the needs that we have we ask
[35:40] that your word would minister to them
[35:42] and lord to those that are
[35:44] live-streaming those that are sick that
[35:45] couldn't make it lord we just pray your
[35:48] grace would be with each and every one
[35:50] of them we thank you for these things
[35:52] for we ask you jesus precious name amen
[35:56] amen our first scripture reading is in
[35:58] saint john chapter 10 we want to start
[36:01] with verse number 27 this is a familiar
[36:04] scripture my sheep hear my voice and i
[36:07] know them and they follow me
[36:09] and i give unto them eternal life and
[36:11] they shall never perish
[36:13] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[36:16] my hand
[36:18] my father which gave them me is greater
[36:21] than all and no man is able to pluck
[36:23] them out of my father's hand what is
[36:27] security amen
[36:29] turn with me to the chapter 15. a few
[36:32] chapters over
[36:33] starting with verse number one of saint
[36:35] john chapter 15 i am the true vine and
[36:38] my father is the husbandman and every
[36:40] branch in me that beareth not fruit he
[36:43] taketh away
[36:45] so no man can take us out of the hand of
[36:48] of the father
[36:49] but here
[36:51] he himself detaches us
[36:54] if
[36:56] we do not bear fruit every branch in me
[36:58] that beareth not fruit is taken away and
[37:01] every branch that beareth fruit he
[37:03] purgeth it that it may bring forth more
[37:06] fruit
[37:07] now you are clean through the word which
[37:09] i have spoken unto you abide in me and i
[37:12] in you and as the as the branch cannot
[37:14] bear fruit of itself except it abide in
[37:16] the vine no more can you except you
[37:18] abide in me
[37:20] i am the vine here are the branches he
[37:22] that abideth in me and i in him the same
[37:25] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[37:28] you can do
[37:29] nothing
[37:31] amen and then in hebrews chapter 3
[37:35] hebrews chapter 3
[37:36] verses 10 through 12 and then we'll have
[37:39] you be seated i know you've been
[37:40] standing in a while
[37:43] hebrews chapter 3 starting with verse 10
[37:46] wherefore i was grieved with that
[37:48] generation and said they do always err
[37:51] in their heart
[37:54] and they have not known my ways
[37:59] so i swear in my wrath they shall not
[38:01] enter into my rest
[38:03] take heed
[38:04] brethren lest there be
[38:06] in any of you an evil heart
[38:09] of unbelief
[38:11] in departing from the living god
[38:14] god bless you may be seated
[38:22] well if we're abiding in christ we will
[38:25] bear the fruit of the spirit amen
[38:28] now inside of all fruit is the seed
[38:32] and i believe if we're bearing the fruit
[38:34] of the spirit we're going to be bringing
[38:36] souls to christ
[38:38] i just believe that that's christ in you
[38:41] doing the work of
[38:43] of
[38:43] of of of the kingdom
[38:46] of to those that have yet to be saved
[38:51] and
[38:53] even though there is an eternal security
[38:57] we have been warned that if we don't
[39:01] stay connected we don't keep abiding in
[39:03] christ
[39:04] that he will detach us
[39:07] and it's a scary
[39:09] scary thought the bible says it's a
[39:11] fearful thing to fall into the hands of
[39:13] a living god
[39:14] and
[39:15] we think of god being loving and how
[39:17] could he
[39:18] do anything that would would harm us
[39:20] well it's not in his heart to harm us at
[39:23] all and he wouldn't do anything to harm
[39:25] us but we
[39:26] ourselves by not abiding in christ
[39:30] could literally force
[39:32] a situation
[39:35] and uh in our last scripture reading
[39:37] here in hebrews it talks about the
[39:40] children of israel this is a well-known
[39:42] story but we
[39:44] we understand that this story was
[39:45] written for our admonition that's what
[39:47] it was really about was for us
[39:50] we understand that god's people were
[39:52] delivered out of the hand
[39:56] out of the out of egypt by the mighty
[39:58] hand of jehovah and it's basically a
[40:00] perfect type of a christian believer
[40:03] today who's come out of the world it was
[40:05] by the grace of god that he called us
[40:07] that we recognized that we we we weren't
[40:10] a part of this world anymore
[40:13] and that he saved us and this is what he
[40:15] did for the children of israel when they
[40:17] were in egypt
[40:19] we also learned that god's people are
[40:22] murmured and they complained a lot after
[40:25] they were delivered
[40:28] and uh
[40:30] this negative attitude that continued on
[40:34] with them it it brought them to a
[40:37] situation to where they they they
[40:39] wandered in the wilderness for 40 years
[40:43] because of this negativity
[40:45] it wouldn't lasted that long if they
[40:47] would have been just with a good
[40:49] attitude do you believe that something i
[40:52] want to bring to our attention
[40:53] joshua and caleb were there with him
[40:56] during this 40 years
[40:59] the only difference is is they didn't
[41:00] murmur and they didn't complain about
[41:02] what was going on
[41:04] they still held on to god's promise
[41:08] they had to put up with everybody else's
[41:11] negativity they had to put up with the
[41:14] results of what the church had to go
[41:16] through
[41:18] but they remained faithful
[41:23] they went through the same tests the
[41:25] same trials the same hardships the same
[41:27] disappointment the same sufferings but
[41:30] they weren't murmuring and complaining
[41:32] about it right amen
[41:34] the bible says
[41:36] that they came out of egypt a mixed
[41:39] multitude
[41:42] like the prophet taught us that in every
[41:44] church there's three types of believers
[41:48] there's the believer the mate believer
[41:50] and the unbeliever
[41:54] there are just certain things that some
[41:56] believers don't believe
[41:58] right
[42:02] you know we look at as an unbeliever who
[42:03] is just completely out in the world he's
[42:06] the antichrist doesn't believe in god
[42:09] just he's just he's an unbeliever
[42:12] but he wouldn't be in the church if he
[42:13] was like that
[42:15] so i wanted to find the unbeliever as
[42:18] someone who just doesn't believe all the
[42:20] word
[42:21] they believe part of it but they don't
[42:24] believe all of it
[42:25] there's just certain things that
[42:27] believers don't believe and if you don't
[42:29] believe all the word you're not a
[42:31] believer
[42:35] man shall live by most of the word no
[42:37] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[42:40] the mouth of god and god wants us to
[42:42] believe every word
[42:45] and then there are those who appear to
[42:47] believe
[42:48] they act like they believe they talk
[42:50] like they are a believer
[42:52] but they're missing the power to lay
[42:55] down their life and live for others
[42:59] life just goes on
[43:01] about them
[43:04] it's more on the outside
[43:07] and then you have the genuine believers
[43:10] they don't just say amen to the word
[43:12] they actually
[43:14] are living the word
[43:16] they're living for others they've given
[43:17] their life to christ and now the work
[43:19] that they're doing is the work of christ
[43:21] through them
[43:26] their character
[43:28] the believer's character is becoming
[43:29] more and more
[43:31] like the image of christ
[43:36] now no matter how much murmuring
[43:38] complaining was going on in the camp
[43:39] joshua and caleb were still working out
[43:42] their own salvation
[43:45] the other ones they they weren't fearing
[43:47] they just they were murmuring they were
[43:49] going oh we should have just you know
[43:51] was better back in the world could do
[43:53] what you want to do
[43:56] but joshua and caleb they were still
[43:59] working out their salvation
[44:01] amen
[44:02] they were still had the fear of god they
[44:05] still held to the word of god
[44:08] they still believed
[44:12] now they weren't immune from the chaotic
[44:14] confusion that was always being created
[44:17] at the camp
[44:19] they were just
[44:20] overcomers they kept their eyes on the
[44:23] promises of god
[44:26] their whole thought process was
[44:28] different
[44:29] so no matter what kind of believer we
[44:31] are
[44:32] we are all going to experience the
[44:35] wilderness
[44:37] we're going to it it doesn't matter if
[44:40] you don't like the outdoors or not every
[44:42] one of us is going to be tested we're
[44:44] going to be proven we're going to go
[44:45] through things
[44:48] just because we're going through trials
[44:50] doesn't mean
[44:53] it doesn't mean one thing or another
[44:59] god
[45:00] wants to prove who we are
[45:05] take heed brethren lest there be in any
[45:08] of you
[45:10] in any of you an evil heart of unbelief
[45:13] in departing from the living god
[45:18] now lucifer
[45:20] he had an evil heart of unbelief
[45:24] he departed with a third of the angels
[45:27] cain had an evil heart of unbelief
[45:30] he departed from the advice that god
[45:32] gave him
[45:34] his own word
[45:35] there are many examples
[45:37] in the bible that talk
[45:38] about departing from the living god
[45:42] but you know who else can have an evil
[45:44] heart of unbelief
[45:47] god's people
[45:49] that's why we're
[45:51] we want to be careful
[45:54] of the thoughts that we think about the
[45:57] decisions that we make
[46:00] what we're going to do with our life and
[46:02] how we're going to serve god and all
[46:04] those things that every one of us have
[46:06] to define
[46:09] but god's people can depart
[46:12] from the living god
[46:14] they can have an evil heart of unbelief
[46:16] look at the disciples look at the
[46:18] disciple judas
[46:20] i mean he walked with jesus all the way
[46:23] he was part of the miracles he he took
[46:26] care of the offerings
[46:29] but
[46:30] he manifested the son of petition
[46:34] look at the disciples of god that
[46:36] followed jesus for a while turn with me
[46:39] if you would to saint john chapter 6
[46:41] and they were these disciples were even
[46:44] helping out with the ministry these
[46:46] weren't just followers these were those
[46:48] that actually ministered and helped
[46:54] but they departed after
[46:56] the preaching become too difficult what
[46:59] god was expecting out of their lives
[47:01] become too hard
[47:02] saint john 6 verse 63
[47:06] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[47:08] flesh prophetess nothing the words i
[47:10] speak unto you they are spirit in their
[47:12] life jesus said
[47:13] and he says but there are some of you
[47:16] that believe not
[47:20] for jesus knew from the beginning
[47:22] who they were that believe not and who
[47:25] should betray him so at the beginning
[47:28] now they were all professing to believe
[47:30] all professing to follow all professing
[47:34] to just to stand as a disciple of christ
[47:39] and he said therefore said i unto you
[47:42] that no man can come unto me except
[47:44] there were given up to him of my father
[47:46] not one i want us to believe today all
[47:49] of us here that god had put something
[47:51] inside of us
[47:54] and that's why we have come to the
[47:55] father that's why we're here today
[47:58] but you can't just
[48:00] uh
[48:02] rest on that statement and forget about
[48:04] everything else
[48:06] because these that walked away thought
[48:09] the same thing
[48:13] and verse 66 says from that time
[48:16] many of
[48:17] his who
[48:19] disciples
[48:21] went back and walked no more with him i
[48:23] know some of this is is
[48:25] you've heard this before
[48:27] but
[48:28] this was a disciple
[48:30] of christ
[48:32] these were those in the ministry
[48:34] they got to a point
[48:36] where they walked back they stopped
[48:39] abiding in christ
[48:41] they had an evil heart of unbelief and
[48:43] departing from the living god
[48:46] these were not unbelievers
[48:50] but many of his disciples went back and
[48:53] walked no
[48:55] more how many people have left this
[48:56] message right
[48:58] how many people have just
[49:00] stopped going to church
[49:02] come on this is a real situation
[49:07] then said jesus unto the twelve will ye
[49:11] also go away don't you love it that
[49:15] he's interested in
[49:17] whether we're going to stay connected or
[49:18] not
[49:19] amen
[49:21] then simon peter answered him lord to
[49:23] whom shall we go that was the words of
[49:25] eternal life
[49:26] and we believe and are sure that thou
[49:28] art the christ the son of the living god
[49:31] jesus said he that endureth to the end
[49:34] the same shall be saved we've got to
[49:36] keep that in mind amen
[49:39] it's not what we think about god it's
[49:41] not how we feel about god it's not even
[49:44] the knowledge that we have about god
[49:49] god's people are not
[49:51] immune of developing an evil heart of
[49:54] unbelief
[49:58] you don't like something god wants you
[50:00] to do i mean it's easy to get a hard
[50:02] heart right
[50:04] let's just take a look at the the
[50:05] children of god that came out of egypt
[50:08] these were god's people and the bible
[50:10] says they cried and god heard their cry
[50:13] by a reason of their afflictions
[50:16] so god heard their cries and he came
[50:18] down he called them people and i'm going
[50:19] to help them
[50:22] they danced in the spirit
[50:24] they rejoiced in the very presence of
[50:26] god
[50:28] they sang songs of deliverance
[50:31] your shoes never wore out
[50:34] i got to get a pair
[50:36] at least once a year
[50:38] because my crack on the bottom
[50:41] and i try to buy the best ones i can buy
[50:44] but their shoes never wore out
[50:49] they could prove that they were
[50:50] spirit-led
[50:53] by day and by night
[50:56] god gave him oh a a rock where water
[50:59] came out
[51:01] and the bible says that that christ
[51:03] followed them
[51:05] so god was faithful god fed them
[51:08] these these people of god experienced
[51:11] miracles
[51:13] they witnessed the supernatural works of
[51:15] god for 40 years
[51:18] but these people had an evil heart of
[51:21] unbelief
[51:27] jude chapter 1 verse 5 says i will
[51:29] therefore put you to remember so he once
[51:31] knew this how that the lord having saved
[51:34] the people of the land of egypt
[51:35] afterwards he destroyed them that
[51:37] believed not
[51:39] and the angels which kept not their
[51:41] first estate but left their own
[51:42] habitation he have reserved an
[51:44] everlasting chains on
[51:47] under darkness unto the judgment of the
[51:49] great day
[51:52] now these believers never thought
[51:57] they departed from god
[52:00] you couldn't get one of them to say
[52:02] i
[52:04] i i i'm leaving god no
[52:07] they said they'll leave the prophet
[52:08] leave the message
[52:11] leave this direction that they're
[52:13] leading me
[52:17] but they never thought they had an evil
[52:18] heart of unbelief
[52:20] they battled fears complexes but they
[52:23] still believed in god
[52:26] not evil
[52:27] they still believed in the miracles of
[52:29] god they still believe that moses was a
[52:33] prophet
[52:37] but like a lot of people they think you
[52:39] know brother brandon went off the deep
[52:40] end or something who knows what the
[52:42] devil told him about moses
[52:45] now it's difficult to understand how a
[52:47] group of believers that had repented
[52:50] that walked with
[52:52] with god for 40 years and had all these
[52:55] signs wonders
[52:57] miracles
[53:00] and they got to a point where they were
[53:02] willing to go over at the end
[53:04] but they had departed from god now it's
[53:07] hard to understand that
[53:10] god's testimony to them was different
[53:13] than their own testimony
[53:15] a lot of times god's testimony is
[53:17] different than our testimony
[53:20] but they had an evil heart of unbelief
[53:23] in departing from the living god
[53:25] now to understand this a little bit more
[53:29] we want to look at the scriptures before
[53:32] and after so turn with me if you would
[53:33] to hebrews chapter 3
[53:36] verse 5. i'll show how easy it is to
[53:40] slip away from god
[53:43] and not even realize it
[53:46] verse 5 says and moses verily was
[53:48] faithful in all his house as a servant
[53:50] for a testimony of those things which
[53:53] were to be spoken after but christ as
[53:56] his son over his own house whose house
[53:59] we are
[54:00] if we hold fast
[54:03] the confidence and the rejoicing of the
[54:05] hope firm on to the end amen if you just
[54:09] let go of your confidence you let go of
[54:12] your rejoicing of your hope
[54:17] think about it
[54:20] you can develop an evil heart of
[54:22] unbelief amen
[54:27] it's important that you keep rejoicing
[54:30] you keep your eyes on the promise that
[54:32] you will manifest all of christ
[54:38] there's a promised land for us
[54:42] we are god's house if we keep moving
[54:44] forward
[54:46] into all of god's promise because he
[54:49] gave them a promise he gave us a promise
[54:51] amen
[54:53] god is not going to live in an
[54:55] unfinished house right we're his house
[54:59] no matter what we claim no matter how
[55:01] much we we're attached we say we're
[55:03] predestined we've got to get finished
[55:06] you know the bride have made herself
[55:08] ready we've got we've got to put on the
[55:10] responsibility to get to the place that
[55:13] we're in his image amen
[55:18] god is not going to keep living
[55:20] in a believer
[55:22] if he doesn't hold fast his confidence
[55:26] so
[55:28] it's not st where we start out but it's
[55:30] how we finish
[55:32] verse 7 wherefore as the holy ghost say
[55:36] it now this is the holy ghost talking
[55:39] this is what the holy spirit is really
[55:41] trying to say
[55:43] to the believer's hearts that's you and
[55:44] i today
[55:46] if we will hear his voice
[55:49] and harden not your heart
[55:52] as in the provocation in the day of
[55:54] temptation in the wilderness when your
[55:56] fathers tempted me proved me and saw my
[55:58] works for 40 years
[56:02] now we've seen god working among us for
[56:04] many years
[56:06] many years
[56:07] he has proven himself to be faithful
[56:10] over and over to us
[56:13] yet how many times have we doubted god
[56:17] how many times we said
[56:19] lord why me
[56:20] this isn't fair
[56:22] it's too hard for me why am i going
[56:24] through this
[56:26] how many times have we came to church
[56:28] heard the word but neglected to walk out
[56:31] living that word
[56:33] giving so little attention to it
[56:37] how many times we required god to give
[56:39] us some signs some proof that what we
[56:41] heard was really of god not of some man
[56:46] when your fathers tempted me and proved
[56:49] me and saw my works 40
[56:52] years
[56:54] it's not the action but the reaction god
[56:57] is looking how we're going to react
[57:00] verse 10 wherefore i was grieved with
[57:03] that generation think about here's a
[57:05] group of people where he performed all
[57:07] these miracles for 40 years they had a
[57:09] testimony they could write books that
[57:12] god jehovah was with them but here he
[57:15] said he was grieved with him
[57:18] how could god be blessing these people
[57:20] like he has and yet grieved
[57:22] so we can't go off of god's blessing us
[57:25] and that's the end of the story
[57:31] the bible says
[57:32] they do always air in their heart
[57:36] and they have not known my
[57:38] ways so i swear in my wrath that they
[57:41] shall not enter into my wrath i'll say
[57:44] there is a big difference between having
[57:47] experiences with god and knowing the
[57:50] ways of god
[57:53] not just knowing the ways
[57:55] but walking in the ways
[57:59] a big difference
[58:02] god showers his blessings on the just
[58:04] and the unjust
[58:06] and it doesn't matter how god uses you
[58:08] how many times he can use you
[58:10] that has nothing to do with knowing
[58:12] god's ways
[58:14] right it's true
[58:15] yeah they could say yeah our shoes
[58:17] didn't wear out that's not the way he's
[58:19] talking about
[58:22] but god he performed these miracles i
[58:23] was sick i looked to the to the stick
[58:25] and i got healed that's not the ways
[58:28] that he's talking about because jesus
[58:30] said they have not known my ways what
[58:32] ways is he talking about right it's not
[58:35] having these experiences with god that's
[58:38] knowing his ways
[58:39] god has a way for us to walk in amen
[58:42] this is his word he wants us to walk in
[58:45] all the word amen that's his way amen i
[58:48] am the way the truth and the life
[58:53] he says
[58:54] they air
[58:56] in their heart
[58:57] they always air in their heart the air
[59:00] was in their heart
[59:02] the heart is deceitful above all things
[59:04] who can know it it takes god even to
[59:06] show us what's in our heart amen
[59:08] they didn't know god's way
[59:12] god's way
[59:14] of trying his children
[59:20] god is allowed
[59:22] to put us through tests and trials
[59:26] because he wants to prove who we are
[59:32] the same
[59:34] son
[59:36] that made
[59:37] moses the meekest man ever amen
[59:42] that same son made pharaoh so hard that
[59:46] he wanted to kill
[59:50] trials
[59:51] prove what's on the inside of us
[59:56] it's important to know god in the middle
[59:58] of your trials
[1:00:00] it's important to know god's ways in the
[1:00:02] middle of the fire
[1:00:05] when he sends you through the fire and
[1:00:07] you're being tested and he allows
[1:00:09] persecutions in your life and things to
[1:00:11] happen that's when you got to know your
[1:00:13] god amen
[1:00:18] so you keep walking forward in praise
[1:00:21] and confidence that he's taking you
[1:00:23] through
[1:00:28] because he will claim you as his house
[1:00:31] whose house you are
[1:00:33] if you hold your confidence steadfast to
[1:00:37] the end
[1:00:39] that means it doesn't matter what you're
[1:00:40] going through i'm still going to be in
[1:00:42] this image i'm still going to be in this
[1:00:44] lightness i'm still going to be ready
[1:00:48] we think this is not a big deal but it's
[1:00:50] a huge deal
[1:00:52] because character is developed in the
[1:00:54] trials
[1:00:58] you know we can talk about the the
[1:01:00] wonderful times of rejoicing in all the
[1:01:03] but that has nothing to do with it
[1:01:08] it's important that we know god
[1:01:11] in our lives what we're going through
[1:01:13] what's happening
[1:01:16] this is knowing god this is knowing
[1:01:18] something has got to hold us something's
[1:01:20] got to anchor us
[1:01:23] gonna keep us from the murmuring the
[1:01:25] complaining and wishing things were
[1:01:26] different joshua and caleb said though
[1:01:29] though he slay me i yet i'll trust them
[1:01:31] i'm still gonna walk with them there's
[1:01:32] still a mountain for me
[1:01:35] they kept their eyes on the promise
[1:01:39] we're going through a lot of junk in
[1:01:40] this world
[1:01:43] but i tell you what's so scary he says
[1:01:46] i swear in my wrath
[1:01:47] that they shall not enter into my rest
[1:01:52] god put up with her nonsense for 40
[1:01:54] years
[1:01:56] unconditional love that's our god
[1:01:58] but he made a decision at the end
[1:02:01] to keep himself from them
[1:02:05] think about that statement he made a
[1:02:07] decision to keep himself from them we
[1:02:10] know it as he kept them from the
[1:02:12] promised land but what is the promise
[1:02:14] then what's our promised land
[1:02:19] that's right
[1:02:20] i don't want god to make a decision to
[1:02:22] keep me from him
[1:02:25] amen
[1:02:26] the promised land for them was rest from
[1:02:29] their
[1:02:32] enemy it was the completion of god's
[1:02:36] promise amen
[1:02:38] right i'm going to take you out of egypt
[1:02:39] i'm going to put give you in the land it
[1:02:41] wasn't some something haphazard he did
[1:02:43] afterwards
[1:02:45] it was all part of the
[1:02:46] promise the promised land is rest our
[1:02:51] promised land is rest from our ungodly
[1:02:55] nature amen
[1:03:00] it's when we can possess the gate of the
[1:03:03] enemy that gets in there and tries to
[1:03:05] control us and make us feel things and
[1:03:08] do things that we don't want to do
[1:03:12] of course we can't we can't
[1:03:15] defeat the devil
[1:03:17] but christ in me can defeat the devil
[1:03:20] amen listen to what brother branham said
[1:03:22] in the message adoption
[1:03:24] part two he says now we have a promise
[1:03:28] because our promise is a spiritual rest
[1:03:31] he said theirs was a physical rest
[1:03:34] he says but the man outside of canaan
[1:03:37] knows nothing of it he's still wandering
[1:03:40] not saying that he's not a good man i
[1:03:42] don't say that i don't say even
[1:03:46] the man even in egypt's not a good man
[1:03:49] but until he's come over here into the
[1:03:51] possession he just doesn't know
[1:03:54] and the possession
[1:03:56] that the promise that was given to the
[1:03:58] church is not a natural land
[1:04:02] but a spiritual land
[1:04:05] for we are the royal priesthood a holy
[1:04:07] nation
[1:04:08] then in this royal priesthood this holy
[1:04:11] nation peculiar people called out
[1:04:13] elected chosen and set aside
[1:04:15] then all
[1:04:16] the world is dead on the outside
[1:04:25] all of it i'll tell you i got some more
[1:04:27] dying out to do
[1:04:30] just being honest
[1:04:32] and we are led by the spirit sons and
[1:04:35] daughters of god are led by the spirit
[1:04:37] of god not by man but by the spirit
[1:04:41] now listen to this now he goes and he's
[1:04:43] going to really describe this promised
[1:04:46] land i just love this
[1:04:47] and all in love the whole thing is
[1:04:50] bundled up now
[1:04:52] but the thing i want to try to get to
[1:04:56] you is this
[1:04:58] how he's going to describe the promised
[1:04:59] land the man that is in christ with the
[1:05:03] holy ghost
[1:05:04] can bear with a man when he's wrong
[1:05:10] long suffering gentle patient he's sweet
[1:05:14] he's humble he's faithful he's filled
[1:05:16] with the spirit never negative always
[1:05:20] positive he's a different person
[1:05:22] now that's the holy ghost that's the
[1:05:25] promised land that's our rest right
[1:05:27] there it can't be described any better
[1:05:29] than that
[1:05:32] it ain't saying i belong to church i'm
[1:05:33] in the message i've been saved i've been
[1:05:35] no that doesn't have nothing to do with
[1:05:37] it god did this for me no that does
[1:05:38] nothing to do with it are you
[1:05:40] manifesting the fruit of christ are you
[1:05:43] abiding in christ
[1:05:50] he said not just
[1:05:52] a man that we once had it
[1:05:54] if we shouted we had it
[1:05:57] us methodists all when we shouted we we
[1:06:00] was in the land that's good that's all
[1:06:02] right i believe that too
[1:06:05] then the pentecostals come along
[1:06:06] speaking with tongues they
[1:06:08] they had it everyone spoke with tongues
[1:06:11] had it i believe that too but
[1:06:13] still
[1:06:14] we found out that a lot of them didn't
[1:06:16] have it you see
[1:06:19] we're now coming down to this great
[1:06:21] hidden mystery that's been hid since the
[1:06:23] foundation of the world and now being
[1:06:25] revealed in the last days to who to the
[1:06:28] sons of god
[1:06:29] you believe that to be true the sons of
[1:06:31] god are manifested
[1:06:34] they're manifested oh i love that
[1:06:37] amen and he quotes this romans 8 19 for
[1:06:40] the earnest expectation of the creature
[1:06:42] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:06:45] sons of god so what do we what what's
[1:06:47] the what are we going to manifest
[1:06:49] some badge god's chosen me
[1:06:58] with
[1:06:59] earnest expectations the whole creation
[1:07:02] is waiting
[1:07:03] for the manifestation see the
[1:07:05] manifestation what is the manifestation
[1:07:08] is the making known
[1:07:14] now the whole world the muhammad's out
[1:07:16] yonder they're looking for it
[1:07:18] all around everywhere they're looking
[1:07:19] for it where are these people
[1:07:23] we've had it we've had the mighty
[1:07:25] rushing wind we've had the thunders the
[1:07:26] lightnings we've had the oil and the
[1:07:28] blood we've had all kinds of things but
[1:07:30] we failed to hear that little still
[1:07:33] small voice
[1:07:36] that attracted the prophet that was
[1:07:38] wrapped up in the robe around him and
[1:07:39] walked out and said here am i lord see
[1:07:43] the whole creation is groaning and
[1:07:46] waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:07:47] sons of god
[1:07:49] so brother brandon says that still small
[1:07:51] voice speaking in our hearts
[1:07:54] that we are the ones that have been
[1:07:55] called to manifest christ the word in
[1:07:58] flesh again
[1:08:00] and he says but the thing i want you to
[1:08:02] try to try to get to you
[1:08:04] is this that a man that is in christ i'm
[1:08:06] just re
[1:08:07] quoting this with the holy ghost can
[1:08:10] bear with one another when he's wrong
[1:08:13] long-suffering gentle patient he's sweet
[1:08:15] he's humble he's faithful filled with
[1:08:16] the spirit
[1:08:17] never negative always positive he's a
[1:08:19] different person now all these things
[1:08:22] are truly the love of god manifested
[1:08:28] those are just the manifestations of the
[1:08:31] love of god the i believe that the
[1:08:33] children of god
[1:08:35] are going to manifest perfect love amen
[1:08:40] amen
[1:08:41] that's the fruit of the spirit now
[1:08:43] that's the promised land that brother
[1:08:45] brandon said that the best thing he also
[1:08:47] went on one place he said
[1:08:49] you know there's a lot of theologians
[1:08:51] that have tried to hit this and they can
[1:08:52] do a pretty good job but the main thing
[1:08:54] i'm trying to get to you is this
[1:08:57] we put so little emphasis on living the
[1:09:00] life now you can't live that life that's
[1:09:03] being talked about if everything is
[1:09:05] sweet and dandy and everybody's loving
[1:09:08] on you and you got all kinds of money
[1:09:10] and you're very popular well it's very
[1:09:13] hard to manifest those things
[1:09:16] but go through a trial
[1:09:18] go through the wilderness
[1:09:21] and manifest what joshua and caleb did
[1:09:24] amen that's where you see it amen
[1:09:29] the believers have always erred in their
[1:09:32] heart not knowing my
[1:09:34] ways
[1:09:35] this is the way that god's talking about
[1:09:38] it's this life that you live not the
[1:09:40] experiences that you've had with god
[1:09:43] but the life that you're living
[1:09:46] so i swear in my wrath they shall not
[1:09:49] enter into my rest
[1:09:51] what a heartbreak what a judgment call
[1:09:57] it wasn't good many will come to me that
[1:09:58] day and say lord lord didn't i have all
[1:10:00] these experiences with you
[1:10:03] but i never knew you they didn't know
[1:10:05] his ways
[1:10:08] verse 12 take heed brethren
[1:10:11] lest there be in any of you an evil
[1:10:13] heart
[1:10:14] of unbelief
[1:10:16] and departing from the living god so
[1:10:18] when i talk about departing from the
[1:10:19] living god i'm talking about departing
[1:10:22] from holding on to your rejoicing firm
[1:10:24] to the end
[1:10:26] amen
[1:10:28] as soon as you you stop rejoicing
[1:10:31] you know what happens when you stop
[1:10:32] rejoicing
[1:10:34] you start a little murmuring
[1:10:36] start a little complaining
[1:10:39] you know what this isn't right i don't
[1:10:40] like that
[1:10:43] i don't like how you know this or that
[1:10:46] about this or that i don't want to say
[1:10:48] anything but you understand what i'm
[1:10:50] saying
[1:10:51] it's easy to begin to murmur and
[1:10:54] complain if you
[1:10:56] depart from the rejoicing you you depart
[1:10:59] from
[1:11:00] from holding your confidence steadfast
[1:11:02] to the end now our promise we should be
[1:11:06] our whole vision should be taking over
[1:11:09] this ungodly nature
[1:11:13] that's where our whole vision should be
[1:11:15] not what we can gain more knowledge or
[1:11:17] no more mysteries or have a more of a
[1:11:20] hallelujah service
[1:11:22] i tell you i want to leave here and i
[1:11:23] want to better live the life i want
[1:11:25] about when when the chips are down i
[1:11:27] want just christ to pour out of me i
[1:11:29] don't want to have to work at it i want
[1:11:32] christ just to i want to enter into that
[1:11:34] rest
[1:11:36] want christ to do it for me
[1:11:39] but how many believers
[1:11:41] have let go their confidence
[1:11:45] that they will manifest christ
[1:11:50] maybe in the heat of the battle
[1:11:53] maybe when their face is slapped
[1:11:56] or maybe when they've been taken
[1:11:58] advantage of
[1:11:59] used or abused
[1:12:02] how many believers have left their
[1:12:04] confidence and their rejoicing slip away
[1:12:09] god is defining this the scriptures is
[1:12:13] defining this as an evil heart of
[1:12:15] unbelief
[1:12:19] now if these if the children of israel
[1:12:21] would have held on to it
[1:12:22] yes we're more than able to take the
[1:12:24] land we're more than able to be an
[1:12:25] overcomer
[1:12:29] christ died that he might live inside of
[1:12:32] me and overcome my flesh
[1:12:35] if they could have just held on to that
[1:12:37] they wouldn't been fearful
[1:12:40] are you with me
[1:12:42] but it always starts in the heart the
[1:12:44] air always starts in the heart not the
[1:12:46] mouth the heart
[1:12:50] before you know it things start to slip
[1:12:52] out of the mouth
[1:12:56] god has a spiritual rest for us
[1:13:01] all the enemies
[1:13:04] have to be kicked out
[1:13:09] and we got to be the one to say get
[1:13:10] behind me satan
[1:13:14] the gates that were once occupied by an
[1:13:17] ungodly nature
[1:13:19] have been taken over by the holy ghost
[1:13:22] because remember the children of israel
[1:13:25] they didn't take the giants
[1:13:28] it was god who fought the battle right
[1:13:30] all they had to do was believe
[1:13:34] they they what'd they do they held on to
[1:13:36] the rejoicing they walked around the
[1:13:38] walls of jericho seven times rejoicing
[1:13:42] blow the trumpets walk seven times all
[1:13:44] you do is obey hold their confidence god
[1:13:47] is somehow going to do it the walls came
[1:13:49] down
[1:13:51] so i'll tell you i don't care what's
[1:13:52] going on in your life i don't care how
[1:13:54] negative it is how bad i if it's not of
[1:13:57] god god is more than able
[1:14:00] but you got to hold your confidence
[1:14:02] nobody can live that for you nobody can
[1:14:04] believe for you
[1:14:06] joshua came to believe with all their
[1:14:08] heart but they could not believe for a
[1:14:10] 1.8 million people
[1:14:12] you've got to believe it for yourself
[1:14:14] don't none go with me still i'll follow
[1:14:18] amen amen you got to hold it to the end
[1:14:21] i know we're going through tremendous
[1:14:22] things tremendous things
[1:14:25] and more is coming
[1:14:28] it's gonna be a squeeze
[1:14:31] we gotta hold on
[1:14:34] turn with me to hebrews chapter four
[1:14:38] verse nine
[1:14:40] there remaineth therefore a rest
[1:14:44] to the people of god
[1:14:47] there's a rest for us
[1:14:51] for he that has entered into his rest
[1:14:54] he also have seized from his own works
[1:14:57] as god did from his
[1:15:00] in other words you don't have to try to
[1:15:03] stop drinking
[1:15:04] right
[1:15:05] you don't have to work at it
[1:15:09] no you you enter into christ
[1:15:11] and it is his work that takes care of it
[1:15:14] he takes it out of you
[1:15:16] because he already paid for it at
[1:15:17] calvary it's his life inside of you
[1:15:20] you've now entered into his rest
[1:15:25] it's now christ
[1:15:27] in you the hope of glory he's taken over
[1:15:30] i love this verse verse 11 let us labor
[1:15:33] therefore
[1:15:34] to enter into that rest how much time
[1:15:36] are we spending trying to enter into the
[1:15:39] holy ghost
[1:15:41] you know what are we waiting for
[1:15:43] waiting for somebody to generate it at
[1:15:45] church
[1:15:46] waiting for it to happen when you pop on
[1:15:48] the tape
[1:15:50] after you go through the motions
[1:15:53] no we need a labor we need a laborer
[1:15:56] there's too much formality
[1:15:59] need to cry out to god
[1:16:02] i'll tell you when the children of
[1:16:04] israel cried out to god god came and
[1:16:06] saved them as soon as they stopped
[1:16:07] crying out because they had it
[1:16:10] they started complaining they didn't
[1:16:12] start crying out they started
[1:16:13] complaining about things we got to keep
[1:16:15] crying out for god god come have your
[1:16:18] way in my life lord
[1:16:21] labor to enter into it read listen to
[1:16:24] the tapes rapturing faith lies in those
[1:16:27] tapes
[1:16:28] labor labor labor don't just come to
[1:16:31] church
[1:16:31] right
[1:16:32] it's true learn to labor with your life
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:37] lest any man fall
[1:16:40] after the same example
[1:16:43] of unbelief
[1:16:46] when you're laboring to enter into your
[1:16:48] rest you're moving forward with
[1:16:50] confidence you're rejoicing you're
[1:16:52] thanking god for the promise thank you
[1:16:53] lord i'm an overcomer i can do all
[1:16:55] things through you christ
[1:16:58] but
[1:16:59] if you're not doing that you're falling
[1:17:02] after the same example of unbelief and
[1:17:04] you don't even realize it the children
[1:17:06] in israel didn't realize it what was
[1:17:08] going to happen to them
[1:17:11] if they knew they were going to be
[1:17:12] doomed 40 years ago they probably would
[1:17:14] have quit
[1:17:18] the devil he don't want us to know what
[1:17:20] we're doing when we're doing the wrong
[1:17:22] thing
[1:17:26] i know that to be the truth
[1:17:31] what an exhortation keep laboring until
[1:17:34] all of christ is manifested inside of us
[1:17:38] don't be satisfied for how much you know
[1:17:40] of god
[1:17:44] don't just brag about your shoes not
[1:17:46] wearing out and the miracles that have
[1:17:47] been happening
[1:17:49] you know last year
[1:17:51] these had 40 years of miracles to talk
[1:17:53] about
[1:17:57] that wasn't joshua and caleb's attitude
[1:18:03] don't let your confidence slip away
[1:18:06] don't fall after that same example i'm
[1:18:09] so glad we have this in the word to tell
[1:18:11] us how we need to be
[1:18:16] verse 12
[1:18:18] just hold on to god's word of promise
[1:18:20] for the word of god is quick it's
[1:18:24] powerful
[1:18:25] it's sharper than any twitch or a
[1:18:26] piercing even the dividing son of the
[1:18:28] soul spirit and the joints and the
[1:18:30] marrow and is a discerner of the
[1:18:31] thoughts and intents of the heart all we
[1:18:33] need is to rely on the word of god
[1:18:37] if god's word said it i believe it amen
[1:18:41] it can cut that devil right out of us
[1:18:43] it's so powerful it's so sharp
[1:18:47] it can discern whether our motives are
[1:18:49] right or wrong
[1:18:51] when the prophet said check your motives
[1:18:53] that means you can know your motive if
[1:18:55] you want to know bad enough
[1:18:57] amen
[1:18:58] now i'll tell you the majority of the
[1:18:59] time i'm going to be honest with you do
[1:19:01] you remember this the majority of the
[1:19:02] time our motives are mixed
[1:19:06] and that's what makes it so difficult
[1:19:09] to discern
[1:19:12] but if we take time to say lord i'm i
[1:19:15] don't want no wrong motives search my
[1:19:17] heart lord i want this to be pure clean
[1:19:19] i want to only be you
[1:19:21] it takes that
[1:19:24] neither is there any creature that is
[1:19:26] not manifest in his sight but all things
[1:19:28] are naked and open unto
[1:19:30] the eyes of him of whom we have to do
[1:19:33] now look at this wonderful verse
[1:19:35] seeing then that we have a great high
[1:19:37] priest that is passed into the heavens
[1:19:39] jesus
[1:19:40] the son of god let us hold fast our
[1:19:45] profession
[1:19:47] don't let one ounce of complaining
[1:19:49] negativity murder ever be among you
[1:19:52] among you you are the children of god we
[1:19:55] don't do that get it out of your life
[1:19:57] get it out of your home get it out of
[1:19:59] your conversation take a
[1:20:02] stand you know that devil will try to
[1:20:05] slip in there
[1:20:07] and then they always say that's not no
[1:20:08] big thing it's just you know you all
[1:20:10] have you know down days and before you
[1:20:12] know it you got down weeks and then down
[1:20:14] months and then a down year
[1:20:20] so the lord
[1:20:22] is warning the believer here in hebrews
[1:20:23] chapter 3 verse 12 take heed brother
[1:20:25] blessed there be in any of you an evil
[1:20:28] heart of unbelief in departing from the
[1:20:31] living god or
[1:20:33] just letting go of your rejoicing that
[1:20:36] you're going to manifest all of christ
[1:20:40] but exhort one another look at this
[1:20:43] verse 13. we have now the job of helping
[1:20:46] one another
[1:20:47] but exhort one another daily while it's
[1:20:49] called day lest
[1:20:51] any of you be hardened
[1:20:53] through the deceitfulness of unbelief
[1:20:58] just a little unbelief not a big deal
[1:21:01] you can become hardened
[1:21:04] for we are made partakers of christ if
[1:21:09] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[1:21:11] that fast to the end
[1:21:13] we can't let the things of the world get
[1:21:15] us down
[1:21:16] amen we can't let the trials that we're
[1:21:18] going through understand that the things
[1:21:20] that you're going through in life
[1:21:23] are similar
[1:21:25] to the things that the children of
[1:21:26] israel went through in the wilderness
[1:21:31] we're being tested we're being proven
[1:21:34] yeah we're living in a scientific age it
[1:21:37] wasn't scientific back then
[1:21:40] but yet the testing is to prove who we
[1:21:42] are
[1:21:44] a complaint back then is the complaint
[1:21:46] in 2022
[1:21:48] right a murder back then is a murmur
[1:21:50] here that's what god's looking at he's
[1:21:52] looking at what we are
[1:21:54] he would never put anything on us that
[1:21:56] we couldn't bear that's not our god god
[1:21:58] would only put on us what we can bear so
[1:22:00] there's never ever an excuse or a reason
[1:22:02] to complain
[1:22:05] i'll just say it like this tell the
[1:22:06] devil to get behind you get behind me
[1:22:08] saying i ain't listening to you and
[1:22:09] listen to those thoughts
[1:22:12] you gotta labor to enter into that rest
[1:22:15] it ain't gonna fall on your lap
[1:22:17] god is not some santa claus
[1:22:21] i'm all for the testimonies
[1:22:24] and confidence
[1:22:26] that we have in god
[1:22:29] at those times of rejoicing
[1:22:32] i'm all for
[1:22:34] the things that god has done for us and
[1:22:36] we need more testimonies
[1:22:38] we really do
[1:22:40] i'm all for the the songs of zion
[1:22:43] i'm all for lord lord he's my lord
[1:22:48] but it's got to go beyond that
[1:22:51] it's got to go beyond that saints we
[1:22:53] stopped there and we feel like the
[1:22:56] children of israel felt
[1:23:01] i got god's with us we got to moses
[1:23:03] intercedes for us
[1:23:06] god listens to him he listens to god
[1:23:09] he bails us out every time we're
[1:23:11] complaining we don't got the same old
[1:23:13] preacher preaching the same old manna
[1:23:17] they just want
[1:23:18] meat you're getting a good month next
[1:23:21] month a good dose of
[1:23:23] other than john martin
[1:23:26] but he bailed him out
[1:23:29] gave him meat
[1:23:31] and then that got him in trouble
[1:23:38] god made a promise to us saints
[1:23:41] and it's up to us to hold our confidence
[1:23:43] until we manifest all of christ
[1:23:46] that should be our goal
[1:23:47] i know we got other things going on in
[1:23:49] life we want other situations taken care
[1:23:51] of we're but you know what we need to
[1:23:53] focus on what's the main thing and that
[1:23:57] god is building a house inside of us
[1:24:02] and he wants this house to be complete
[1:24:04] he doesn't want the windows open and
[1:24:06] crack in the roof and this problem over
[1:24:09] here
[1:24:10] god wants a complete house
[1:24:14] first john chapter three verse two first
[1:24:16] john chapter three verse two says
[1:24:17] beloved now are we the sons of god and
[1:24:20] it doth not yet appear what we shall be
[1:24:22] but we know that when he show up here
[1:24:25] we're gonna be like him for we're gonna
[1:24:27] see him as he is
[1:24:30] we've been called
[1:24:32] and we've been predestinated
[1:24:34] to this image
[1:24:37] so where is the rejoicing of this hope
[1:24:45] shouldn't we be rejoicing shouldn't be
[1:24:47] focusing on manifesting this
[1:24:51] shall we just be excited for the things
[1:24:53] that god
[1:24:55] has uh delivered you from in your lives
[1:24:57] and the fruit of the spirit that you can
[1:24:59] honestly uh be hated be talked behind
[1:25:02] your back slap everything else and you
[1:25:04] can still love that person shouldn't
[1:25:06] there be some rejoicing going on
[1:25:10] yes what are we waiting for for
[1:25:13] everybody to start being nice before
[1:25:15] we're gonna like shine in his image
[1:25:18] it don't happen like that
[1:25:20] verse three and every man that has this
[1:25:23] hope you got this hope
[1:25:25] in him
[1:25:26] purifies himself
[1:25:30] there's a labor to enter into that rest
[1:25:33] there's i i want to be an overcomer i
[1:25:35] want to shine for jesus
[1:25:37] i want to be joshua and caleb i want
[1:25:39] every promise in the book it's mine i
[1:25:41] want to stand with the lord's despised
[1:25:44] view
[1:25:48] colossians chapter 1 verse 26 we just
[1:25:51] need to hold
[1:25:53] our confidence and are rejoicing
[1:25:56] firm to the end
[1:25:58] amen firm
[1:26:00] amen don't ever come in the church
[1:26:03] and just feel like okay i'm here at
[1:26:04] church now what
[1:26:09] verse 26 even the mystery which had been
[1:26:11] hid from ages and from generations but
[1:26:14] now is made manifest
[1:26:16] to his saints okay now we're just
[1:26:18] keeping in mind
[1:26:21] the whole earth is groaning waiting for
[1:26:22] the manifestations of the sons of god to
[1:26:25] whom god would make known
[1:26:27] what is the riches of the glory of this
[1:26:29] mystery among the gentiles which is
[1:26:31] christ
[1:26:32] in you
[1:26:34] the hope of glory
[1:26:38] no brother brandon went on to say hey
[1:26:41] the methodist said they had it when they
[1:26:42] shouted
[1:26:45] penick also said they had it when they
[1:26:48] spoke in tongues
[1:26:51] so
[1:26:53] i'm not going to be satisfied until i
[1:26:55] see christ more in my life
[1:26:58] i'm focusing on what i am to be what
[1:27:02] this word tells me i should be living
[1:27:04] not how far i've come right and being
[1:27:07] satisfied like i've attained
[1:27:09] i haven't detained
[1:27:11] about pressing towards amen that mark
[1:27:14] for the prize of the high calling
[1:27:17] whom we preach warning every man and
[1:27:20] teaching every man in what all wisdom
[1:27:24] what's the purpose of doing this that we
[1:27:26] may present every man perfect in christ
[1:27:29] jesus i do not want
[1:27:31] the lord saying
[1:27:33] i swear my wrath you're not going to
[1:27:35] enter in
[1:27:37] because of my murmuring am i complaining
[1:27:40] and and not
[1:27:42] focusing on what's important to god it's
[1:27:45] important to god that i manifest christ
[1:27:48] it wasn't important to the children of
[1:27:50] israel that they went into that promised
[1:27:52] land crazy
[1:27:54] but
[1:27:56] think about it
[1:27:58] if i
[1:27:58] if i have a thousand dollars i'm going
[1:28:00] to give you and you won't take it how's
[1:28:03] that going to make me feel
[1:28:06] no i don't want it i don't want i want
[1:28:08] your money
[1:28:11] god gave us a promise
[1:28:13] gave the children of israel promised and
[1:28:15] they didn't want it because they feared
[1:28:18] they weren't strong enough to what to
[1:28:20] believe to overcome
[1:28:23] that's why we need to exercise our faith
[1:28:25] that's why we need to get into the
[1:28:27] message listen to the tapes read the
[1:28:29] word faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:28:32] the word of god we need to build
[1:28:34] ourselves up in the most holy faith we
[1:28:36] need
[1:28:37] labor to enter into that rest
[1:28:40] we can't fall after the same example of
[1:28:42] unbelief
[1:28:44] amen
[1:28:46] that's why we warn every man teach every
[1:28:48] man
[1:28:50] verse 29 word to i also labor striving
[1:28:53] according to his working which worketh
[1:28:54] in me my day how many want god working
[1:28:57] you mightily
[1:28:58] amen hebrews chapter two verse one
[1:29:01] well i need to
[1:29:03] get going because it's you know getting
[1:29:05] at the end
[1:29:06] you know and i need to go faster
[1:29:08] now hebrews chapter 2 verse 1 therefore
[1:29:12] you and i
[1:29:13] you and i ought to give
[1:29:15] the more earnest heed
[1:29:17] to the things which we have heard
[1:29:20] lest at any time
[1:29:22] we should let them slip
[1:29:26] for if the word spoken by angels was
[1:29:28] steadfast and every transgression and
[1:29:29] disobedience received a just recompense
[1:29:32] of reward how shall we escape
[1:29:35] how are we going to escape if we neglect
[1:29:38] that means to be careless or to make
[1:29:40] light of
[1:29:42] so great a salvation
[1:29:45] which at the first began to be spoken by
[1:29:48] the lord and was confirmed unto us by
[1:29:50] them that heard them god also bearing
[1:29:52] the witness both with signs and wonders
[1:29:54] and divers miracles and gifts of the
[1:29:56] holy ghost according to his own so god
[1:29:58] gave those children of israel everything
[1:30:01] signs wonders he was with them but they
[1:30:04] became careless
[1:30:06] they neglected they made light of
[1:30:10] that's why i'm so against the doctrines
[1:30:12] of just you know once saved all we saved
[1:30:17] like they don't doesn't matter what they
[1:30:19] do afterwards they're saved well god
[1:30:21] saved the children of israel but
[1:30:23] afterwards he destroyed them
[1:30:25] that should put the fear of god in those
[1:30:27] believers
[1:30:31] but you know satan comes to church too
[1:30:35] he's working in the minds of the people
[1:30:38] trying to get them to compromise and
[1:30:40] that's not necessary that's a little too
[1:30:41] strict and that's just brother sullen so
[1:30:44] that's just a man and you know god is
[1:30:46] with me and
[1:30:49] no
[1:30:51] we need
[1:30:52] to fear the lord
[1:30:54] it is the beginning of wisdom amen
[1:30:58] all right i like to try to get going on
[1:30:59] a positive note with all this if i could
[1:31:02] hebrews chapter 10 verse 30.
[1:31:05] hebrews chapter 10 verse 30.
[1:31:08] lord help us to get through this because
[1:31:09] it's always the you know the best part i
[1:31:11] never get to the best part
[1:31:14] for we know him
[1:31:17] that have said vengeance belongeth unto
[1:31:20] me i will recompense saith the lord and
[1:31:22] again the lord shall judge his people
[1:31:27] now i don't understand why people want
[1:31:29] to judge others
[1:31:31] the lord is the one that judges his
[1:31:32] people
[1:31:37] i don't understand how people don't
[1:31:39] plead
[1:31:41] for mercy more for others
[1:31:45] if vengeance belongs to the lord why do
[1:31:48] we try stealing it away from god
[1:31:51] like i want to do it that don't belong
[1:31:53] to you don't steal it from god
[1:31:56] if the lord is going to judge his people
[1:31:58] then why do we
[1:32:00] judge god's people
[1:32:03] if god is going to make recompense who
[1:32:05] are we to try to take advantage and
[1:32:08] punish somebody or avenge somebody
[1:32:12] it's not our job it's god's
[1:32:15] okay so verse 31 it is a fearful thing
[1:32:18] to fall into the hands look at this of a
[1:32:21] living god we're going back to this
[1:32:22] living god not a dead letter not some
[1:32:25] god way over there but god that's living
[1:32:27] inside of us amen
[1:32:29] but call to remembrance of formal things
[1:32:31] in which after you were illuminated ye
[1:32:34] endured a great
[1:32:35] fight of afflictions partly while you
[1:32:38] were made a gang stock both
[1:32:42] uh by reproaches and afflictions and
[1:32:44] partly
[1:32:45] uh
[1:32:46] wealth ye became companions of them
[1:32:50] that were so used so i'll tell you we've
[1:32:52] all
[1:32:53] gone through some terrible things amen
[1:32:56] for ye have had compassion of me in my
[1:33:00] bonds and took joyfully the swallows of
[1:33:02] your goods knowing in yourselves that
[1:33:04] you have in heaven a
[1:33:06] better and enduring substance
[1:33:09] cast not
[1:33:11] away
[1:33:12] therefore your confidence
[1:33:15] which have great recompense of reward
[1:33:19] free of need of patience
[1:33:23] the children of israel had need of
[1:33:26] patience
[1:33:28] and they didn't do the will of god
[1:33:31] but ye of need of patience that after
[1:33:36] after ye have done the will of god
[1:33:39] ye might receive the promise
[1:33:42] so what we're go the things that we're
[1:33:44] going through god has given us time
[1:33:47] to handle it the right way
[1:33:49] to keep rejoicing
[1:33:52] believing in the promise
[1:33:55] so we can receive the promise of christ
[1:33:57] in me
[1:33:58] if christ is so filled inside of you you
[1:34:01] don't care if they're burning your body
[1:34:05] you don't care what they're doing to you
[1:34:08] they could be stoning you like they did
[1:34:10] stephen
[1:34:12] you would be still saying father forgive
[1:34:14] them
[1:34:17] christ and you the hope of glory
[1:34:20] even here on this earth for yet a little
[1:34:22] while and he
[1:34:24] that shall come will come and will not
[1:34:26] tarry that's our promise saints now the
[1:34:29] just shall live by faith but if any man
[1:34:34] draw back
[1:34:36] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[1:34:43] keep rejoicing don't complain
[1:34:46] but we
[1:34:48] are not of them hallelujah who draw back
[1:34:51] unto perdition
[1:34:53] but of them that believe
[1:34:55] to the end to the saving of the soul
[1:34:59] today is the day of salvation amen
[1:35:04] don't say well i was saved back 20 years
[1:35:06] ago
[1:35:08] i could i could beat you i can i would
[1:35:10] say before the foundation of the world
[1:35:13] but today is the day of salvation today
[1:35:16] god is wanting to prove us today
[1:35:20] we are none of them that draw back or
[1:35:22] shrink from
[1:35:24] into some church formality
[1:35:26] sitting on a pew
[1:35:28] only saying amen to our
[1:35:31] favorite scriptures or our personal
[1:35:33] agendas or the things that we agree with
[1:35:35] the most
[1:35:38] blending in with others
[1:35:40] being satisfied with just a fellowship
[1:35:43] no sir
[1:35:45] we believe in the power of god
[1:35:48] that's going to take us through
[1:35:50] we're not a people that believe in
[1:35:53] slipping into lukewarm state of
[1:35:56] complacency in this age we're not of
[1:35:58] laodicea amen
[1:36:01] we're none of them who are are content
[1:36:03] with how much they're manifesting christ
[1:36:06] we're part of the group that will not be
[1:36:08] satisfied until they awake in his
[1:36:11] likeness amen
[1:36:16] we're not a van that act like we've
[1:36:17] attained
[1:36:20] we've apprehended
[1:36:22] we're spiritual enough
[1:36:24] no sir
[1:36:25] we press towards the mark
[1:36:28] we keep pressing towards the mark
[1:36:30] we're not proud and arrogant
[1:36:33] and uncaring of others
[1:36:36] no we're humble and we're living our
[1:36:37] life for others
[1:36:39] we believe in saving souls
[1:36:42] we don't we're not of those that sit on
[1:36:45] the seat of the scornful judging others
[1:36:48] while making excuses for the things that
[1:36:50] we do
[1:36:53] we're out of those that are forsaking
[1:36:54] the cement of ourselves together but
[1:36:56] we're of that group that are actually
[1:36:58] exhorting one another helping one
[1:36:59] another let's go my brother let's go my
[1:37:01] sister i know you got this going i know
[1:37:03] it's a big thing in your life but you
[1:37:04] got to press into christ
[1:37:07] i'll say it if you could come to church
[1:37:09] and all you had to do was come to church
[1:37:10] and you'd manifest more christ than if
[1:37:13] you went in a barn you turn into a horse
[1:37:16] or an air barn you turn into a goat
[1:37:21] you have got to take the word that you
[1:37:23] hear don't let it slip but labor to
[1:37:25] enter into it believe it with all your
[1:37:27] heart until you see it manifested this
[1:37:30] is the word of life that's being
[1:37:31] ministered
[1:37:35] first john chapter 2 verse 19.
[1:37:37] they went out from us
[1:37:40] but they were not of us
[1:37:42] for if they had been of us
[1:37:44] they would no doubt have continued with
[1:37:46] us but they went out
[1:37:49] that they might be made manifest that
[1:37:52] they were not all of us
[1:37:55] we got to stay with the word
[1:37:59] i want you to write this down because i
[1:38:02] don't got time to read it numbers 32 6
[1:38:06] to 13. you read that when you get home
[1:38:08] okay
[1:38:09] numbers 32
[1:38:11] 6 to 13 or tomorrow when you have time
[1:38:14] but turn with me if you would to joshua
[1:38:16] chapter 14
[1:38:18] joshua 14 chapter or verse 6
[1:38:22] then the children of judah came unto
[1:38:24] joshua and gilgal
[1:38:27] and caleb this under junipeth
[1:38:31] the
[1:38:32] kenzite said unto him thou knowest the
[1:38:35] thing that the lord said on to moses the
[1:38:38] man of god concerning me
[1:38:41] and thee
[1:38:46] so
[1:38:47] i hope that you can remember
[1:38:50] what the lord spoke to your heart to the
[1:38:53] prophet of this age
[1:38:55] because it ain't changing
[1:38:57] this is
[1:38:58] many years now well look verse 7 40
[1:39:01] years old was i when moses the servant
[1:39:04] of the lord sent me
[1:39:06] from
[1:39:07] kadesh barnia to spy out the land and i
[1:39:11] brought him word again and it was in my
[1:39:14] heart nevertheless my brethren i love
[1:39:17] that he called him brethren i love it
[1:39:20] that went up with me made the heart of
[1:39:23] the people melt but i
[1:39:27] wholly followed the lord my god there's
[1:39:31] a difference between everybody and you
[1:39:34] you are not stopping you are holy
[1:39:36] following the lord no matter what
[1:39:38] happens you're going through
[1:39:47] and moses swear on that day saying
[1:39:49] surely the land where unto thy feet of
[1:39:51] trodden shall be thine inheritance and
[1:39:53] thy children forever because thou has
[1:39:55] holy fall the lord my god not because
[1:39:58] you know he
[1:40:00] yeah he could say because he was
[1:40:01] predestinated
[1:40:03] and it would be a true statement
[1:40:05] but the thing is what does that mean it
[1:40:08] means holy following the lord
[1:40:17] the elect
[1:40:18] will holy follow the lord
[1:40:21] they will
[1:40:23] and now behold the lord have kept me
[1:40:25] alive
[1:40:26] as he said these
[1:40:28] forty and five years
[1:40:30] so he's 85 now even since the lord spake
[1:40:34] this word unto moses
[1:40:37] excuse me
[1:40:39] well the children of israel
[1:40:41] wandered in the wilderness
[1:40:45] just
[1:40:46] did not really
[1:40:48] know god's ways just experiencing
[1:40:52] things with god but not knowing his ways
[1:40:55] and now lo
[1:40:56] i am this day for score
[1:40:59] 85 years old as yet i am as strong this
[1:41:03] day as i was
[1:41:05] in the day that moses sent me to spout
[1:41:07] the land as my strength was then even so
[1:41:10] is now my strength now for war both to
[1:41:13] go out and to come in
[1:41:18] how many times did you barely make it in
[1:41:19] the church
[1:41:20] [Laughter]
[1:41:23] remember you're a joshua you're a caleb
[1:41:27] now therefore give me this mountain
[1:41:30] oh i love that attitude
[1:41:32] whereof the lord spake in that day for
[1:41:35] thou
[1:41:35] heardest in the day that the amicrites
[1:41:38] were there and that the cities were
[1:41:40] great and fenced if so be the lord will
[1:41:43] be with me then i shall be able to drive
[1:41:46] them out as the lord said
[1:41:48] and joshua blessed him
[1:41:50] and gave unto caleb the son of
[1:41:52] jeffudini
[1:41:54] hareb for in a heritance
[1:41:58] he kept his eyes on the promise for 45
[1:42:01] years but he didn't have anybody
[1:42:04] supporting him
[1:42:08] just joshua and caleb that was them that
[1:42:11] was it
[1:42:12] everybody else was just murmuring
[1:42:14] complaining at church
[1:42:17] amen god is not forgetting his promise
[1:42:20] if everybody around you forgets you stay
[1:42:22] with the word
[1:42:24] stay with the promise god has promised
[1:42:26] you that you will awaken his likeness
[1:42:28] you will be like christ before he comes
[1:42:31] that's your promise that should be your
[1:42:33] interest amen
[1:42:37] arab therefore became the inheritance of
[1:42:39] caleb the son of japheth the kazanite
[1:42:42] unto this day because that he verse 14
[1:42:46] because
[1:42:47] one reason
[1:42:50] because he had wholly followed the lord
[1:42:52] god of israel so today let's stand
[1:42:54] together today i ask this question
[1:42:57] are we wholly following the lord
[1:43:04] remember there were 1.8 million people
[1:43:06] that thought they were following the
[1:43:08] lord holy
[1:43:27] i
[1:43:28] am so
[1:43:40] i am so needy lord
[1:43:45] to be more like you
[1:43:50] share all my rights away
[1:43:56] in this world of sin
[1:44:01] i am
[1:44:03] [Music]
[1:44:12] i am
[1:44:20] amen let's close our
[1:44:23] [Music]
[1:44:32] eyes all my rights away every one lord
[1:44:38] in this world of
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:42] sin i am so needy
[1:44:47] [Music]
[1:44:53] amen as she continues to play back
[1:44:55] quietly
[1:44:56] [Music]
[1:44:58] if i could just get you to
[1:45:00] close your eyes and
[1:45:02] maybe just focus
[1:45:04] not on me
[1:45:05] and focus on the lord for just a moment
[1:45:11] i want you to ask
[1:45:13] yourself this question because that's
[1:45:15] all that matters too it does not matter
[1:45:17] to anybody to the person next to you
[1:45:25] but are you fully following the lord
[1:45:30] have you
[1:45:32] let murmuring and complaining slip in
[1:45:36] have you
[1:45:38] let slip your rejoicing in your
[1:45:40] confidence
[1:45:47] i believe that god just wants us back on
[1:45:50] the right track
[1:45:53] god just wants us to
[1:45:56] surrender our all to him
[1:45:59] rededicate
[1:46:02] refocus on the promise that god has for
[1:46:05] us
[1:46:09] that he's called us to manifest him
[1:46:13] i know the trials that we go through the
[1:46:15] things that we
[1:46:16] we face are very difficult they're very
[1:46:18] hard
[1:46:21] god knows that
[1:46:22] that doesn't mean god's not with us
[1:46:25] but god wants us to keep rejoicing that
[1:46:28] he's going to take us through
[1:46:31] he's going to see us through he's going
[1:46:33] to see us through every test every trial
[1:46:36] i want you to visualize yourself
[1:46:40] as the brother of joshua
[1:46:42] or the or a sister of caleb
[1:46:46] i want you to visualize yourself as as
[1:46:49] one that is holding your confidence
[1:46:52] steadfast to the end that you're you're
[1:46:54] not going to entertain or listen to the
[1:46:56] thoughts of the enemy or be used by the
[1:46:58] enemy
[1:47:01] but you have
[1:47:02] an answer
[1:47:05] you can tell the devil to get behind you
[1:47:08] i'm going through i'm moving forward

[1:47:17] lord share all my rights away
[1:47:22] lord help me to labor to enter into your
[1:47:24] wrath lord
[1:47:26] help me to set aside some more time
[1:47:30] put away my busy schedule
[1:47:33] to get interested in in some of the
[1:47:35] things that are lacking in my life so
[1:47:37] things are lacking in my house things
[1:47:39] are lacking in my
[1:47:41] uh manifesting your image lord to others
[1:47:45] help me with my my temper lord help me
[1:47:48] with my
[1:47:49] maybe i'm just not being sweet like i

[1:47:53] enough maybe i'm not
[1:47:55] being able to bear with somebody who's
[1:47:57] who's doing me wrong
[1:48:00] but lord i'm focusing today on this lord
