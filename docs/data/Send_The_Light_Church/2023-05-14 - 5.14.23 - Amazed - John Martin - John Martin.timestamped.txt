[38:00] after you have passed on Beyond the Veil
[38:04] that's the real Spirit of motherhood the
[38:06] real Spirit of a Mother's Day Mother's
[38:09] Day is
[38:10] 365 days a year
[38:12] this is the day that they sell flowers

[39:02] always feel like a mother like a good
[39:05] mother
[39:06] but you've got to deny those thoughts
[39:11] and know that you have done your very
[39:14] very best
[39:16] where we have failed because we're human
[39:19] beings that just comes with the

[39:26] your best
[39:27] amen turn with me if you would this
[39:30] morning to the book of First Samuel
[39:31] chapter 12.
[39:41] and before we begin

[41:20] we're leaning upon you and trusting you
[41:22] this morning Lord as we've opened the

[41:28] Lord we ask that you would now open our
[41:31] eyes and our understanding
[41:34] Lord that you would help us to recognize
[41:37] you in the unveiling of your word
[41:40] and I pray that you withdraw us all
[41:42] closer to you this morning that when we
[41:44] would leave here we could all say within
[41:47] our hearts it was good to be in the
[41:49] house of the Lord today Father we thank
[41:52] you for these things we commit now
[41:54] ourselves into your hands receive Glory
[41:56] and Honor we pray in Jesus Christ's name
[41:59] amen amen first Samuel chapter 12
[42:04] starting with verse number 22.
[42:08] for the Lord will not forsake his people
[42:12] for his great name's sake
[42:15] because it have pleased the Lord to make
[42:17] you his people
[42:20] moreover as for me God forbid that I
[42:24] should sin against the Lord in ceasing
[42:27] to pray for you but I will teach you the
[42:30] good and the right way only fear the
[42:34] lord
[42:35] and serve him in truth with all your
[42:38] heart
[42:39] for consider how great things he have
[42:43] done for you
[42:45] God bless you may be seated like to
[42:47] entitle this message amazed I just want
[42:50] to brag a little bit about Jesus this
[42:52] morning
[42:54] consider how great things he has done
[42:56] for us
[42:57] you know we're living in a world
[43:00] that makes it very difficult for us
[43:03] to focus on the Lord
[43:07] and we need to remember
[43:10] that we're not a part of the world Jesus
[43:12] said I am not of the world
[43:14] he said in John 18 36 my kingdom is now
[43:17] this worth my kingdom world of this
[43:19] world then would my servants fight so he
[43:22] made it real clear that he wasn't a part
[43:25] of the world even though that he loved
[43:27] the world he gave himself
[43:29] for the souls he himself is not apart
[43:33] God has called us out of the world to
[43:36] separate us
[43:38] he said wherefore come out from among
[43:40] them and be separate saith the Lord so
[43:43] there's a calling out and Deuteronomy he
[43:45] says he have has chosen us to be a
[43:48] special people unto himself above all
[43:51] people that are upon the face of the
[43:53] Earth
[43:55] and he said in his prayer in John
[43:57] chapter 17 I pray not that thou
[44:00] shouldest take them speaking of us
[44:03] them out of the world but that thou
[44:06] shouldst keep them from the evil
[44:09] so here we are he he just like he placed
[44:12] the children of of uh Daniel and and the
[44:15] three Hebrew children in Babylon
[44:18] he placed them in a worldly ungodly
[44:22] place
[44:23] and he didn't
[44:25] God's desire at that point was not to
[44:27] take him out of there but to leave them
[44:29] there and be an example amen that we can
[44:32] serve God in an ungodly time
[44:36] that they are not of the world even as I
[44:38] am not of the world sanctify them
[44:40] through thy truth Thy word is truth as
[44:42] thou has seen set me into the world even
[44:45] so I also send them into the world so
[44:49] God wants to send us back into the world
[44:51] that he's not a part of that he doesn't
[44:53] want us to be a part of but he sends us
[44:55] back into the world for a purpose
[44:58] and that is to get those that are in the
[45:00] world out of the world
[45:03] once again Jesus is clearly identifying
[45:06] the separation from the world and John
[45:09] says love not the world neither the
[45:13] things that are in the world if any man
[45:15] love the world the love of the father is
[45:17] not in them for all that the that is in
[45:20] the world the lust of the flesh the lust
[45:22] of the eyes the pride of life I'll tell
[45:23] you every one of those we battle
[45:27] it's not of the father but it's of the
[45:30] world so notice right here inside of us
[45:33] is the enemy
[45:34] that's drawing us and trying to get our
[45:36] attention
[45:38] for all that is in the world the lust of
[45:40] the flesh the lust of the eyes the part
[45:41] of life is not of the father of the
[45:43] world the world passeth away and the
[45:44] lust thereof but he that doeth the will
[45:46] of God abideth forever
[45:49] we're stuck in this world
[45:54] some Believers are stuck in this world
[45:57] without a purpose and a vision
[46:01] and that
[46:03] is the most difficult thing
[46:07] because now you're constantly battling
[46:10] things with nothing to push forward into
[46:16] they really don't hear the voice sending
[46:19] them out
[46:20] to win a soul because if that becomes
[46:23] your focus now you're not as distracted
[46:26] you will be distracted but you're not as
[46:29] distracted because you're focused on a
[46:31] purpose
[46:33] this world can take a real toil on us
[46:36] all the pressures the problems
[46:39] all the things that we face
[46:41] we got problems financial problems
[46:44] sometimes
[46:45] sometimes we've got car problems
[46:47] sometimes we got furnace problems
[46:51] tax problems
[46:54] sometimes it's too hot in church and
[46:55] sometimes it's too cold
[46:58] sometimes we got marital problems
[47:00] relationship problems problems at work
[47:03] problems with the family
[47:06] all these problems create a pressure
[47:08] right
[47:10] right makes it very difficult
[47:14] to consider God
[47:16] service
[47:21] well do things to try to fix things we
[47:23] become overwhelmed that we just can't
[47:25] even see straight we need this problem
[47:26] taken care of
[47:28] and it makes it difficult to see God
[47:32] no matter how we try to escape
[47:35] we can try to
[47:37] outrun the pressures but they're there
[47:41] we can even try taking a little vacation
[47:42] but when we come back
[47:45] they're there
[47:46] sometimes we go somewhere and then we
[47:47] find out they're there where we went
[47:52] sometimes we'll try a little
[47:53] entertainment to get the stuff off our
[47:55] mind
[47:56] and that helps a temporary fix sometimes
[47:59] but you know after that's done we're
[48:00] back dealing with the pressures again
[48:05] this world as we know it is experiencing
[48:09] a pressure that is never seen before and
[48:11] eventually it's going to pop into the
[48:12] Great Tribulation
[48:15] fear is dominating the world
[48:17] men's hearts are failing for fear
[48:19] anxiety seems to be the new Norm in
[48:21] people's lives it's no longer do you
[48:24] have an anxiety it's how much anxiety
[48:26] you're dealing with
[48:28] the scale
[48:30] the love of many people is getting
[48:32] colder and colder
[48:36] that if they do find any love it's it's
[48:39] just a little and it's for themselves
[48:42] this world is spowing downward and I'll
[48:46] say it it's taking a lot of people with
[48:48] it
[48:49] you've all seen in a drain where things
[48:52] go down in the drain what's ever around
[48:54] can go go with that drain and we've got
[48:57] to fight against the grain amen
[49:01] even though we're not a part of the
[49:02] world it's still making havoc on our
[49:04] lives
[49:05] I believe we all struggle with things
[49:08] we're all struggling to overcome the
[49:10] things that we're dealing with right
[49:12] none of us are exempt from it I'm sure
[49:14] at times that we all feel
[49:16] that
[49:17] that we have at the hardest
[49:20] and sometimes you do for a season
[49:24] but just
[49:28] just wait a little bit and somebody's
[49:30] got it harder than you
[49:33] you don't got to look very far
[49:35] but when we stop to consider God
[49:40] that's the thing that we need to do is
[49:42] to stop and consider God we can't wait
[49:44] for things to get better in this world
[49:45] this world is not getting better and
[49:48] this world is cruel it may not get
[49:50] better for us
[49:52] but yet we need to stop and consider god
[49:55] consider how great he is in our lives
[49:59] and when we do I believe
[50:01] we'll be amazed
[50:04] count your blessings see what God have
[50:05] done it will surprise you
[50:09] when we
[50:11] stop and just
[50:13] turn Our Eyes Upon Jesus
[50:16] look
[50:18] just look into his face
[50:21] it melts you
[50:23] maybe the picture can't always be there
[50:25] but if you just close your eyes you'll
[50:27] see them
[50:30] when we get down to pray it and just get
[50:32] our minds cleared out from all the
[50:34] things that we've been dealing with
[50:37] I'm amazed of what happens on the inside
[50:40] of me and I'm sure you feel the same way
[50:44] I want you to know
[50:46] I want you
[50:48] uh
[50:50] it is not me breaking up here I want you
[50:52] to Brave with me
[50:54] he's uh he's your Jesus too amen
[50:59] but when we stop to consider God it's
[51:01] always amazing another
[51:04] he stopped long enough and consider him
[51:07] long enough if you focus long enough and
[51:09] you keep your mind on him he will keep
[51:12] you in perfect peace
[51:14] it can't be one of these quick thoughts
[51:16] okay I had to do my prayers I got to do
[51:18] this and everything's going to be okay
[51:19] no we're facing a devil who's attacking
[51:22] us and we need to keep our minds on him
[51:26] peace will not be gifted to anybody
[51:31] you can say Amen to that
[51:34] but it will be rewarded to whosoever
[51:37] will dare to slow down and consider God
[51:40] enough
[51:41] [Music]
[51:42] he has a peace that passeth all
[51:44] understanding
[51:45] [Music]
[51:47] for me I'll take peace over any
[51:50] knowledge
[51:53] I don't need to figure it out
[51:55] I don't need to understand why people do
[51:57] what they do
[52:00] I'll take peace any day of the week
[52:02] above any understanding I could get
[52:05] [Music]
[52:06] mad it seems like the devil's always
[52:08] there trying to say why why why why why
[52:10] why
[52:11] trying to get you to get involved in
[52:15] figuring out his espanage right true
[52:20] but all you need is peace amen
[52:23] amen because you don't need to figure
[52:24] anything out you just need to have the
[52:26] God of Peace With You the peace of God
[52:29] living in you
[52:30] that's what we need in this hour
[52:33] how many times have you
[52:35] try to figure something out you did
[52:38] figure it out and you still didn't have
[52:40] peace
[52:43] the devil's always trying to take you
[52:45] down a bunny trail what he's doing is
[52:47] he's trying to get you away from the god
[52:48] that can keep you
[52:51] he is our peace he's the Prince of Peace
[52:54] the Mighty God the Everlasting father
[52:55] the counselor and he will give peace if
[52:59] your heart is at a place where you slow
[53:01] down and consider him
[53:04] that's always wanting he's wanting you
[53:07] to consider him and then he gives you
[53:09] peace amen
[53:12] you going outside of the boundary of him
[53:14] in any fashion formal way
[53:20] I I wouldn't be looking for peace to
[53:22] come
[53:25] when peace resides
[53:28] in my heart
[53:31] there's such a power
[53:36] that Satan's attacks
[53:40] do not bring you down
[53:48] now
[53:49] we've all been attacked and we know what
[53:51] it's like to be attacked it ain't fun
[53:56] and how Satan usually gets us
[53:59] is when something is done wrong to us
[54:03] and we say that wasn't right
[54:05] that wasn't fair
[54:07] this shouldn't happen they knew better
[54:12] and he sets this real clear
[54:16] aren't you with me on this aren't you
[54:18] with me
[54:21] and then of course when we say yeah
[54:24] that's that's true all sudden we get
[54:27] bothered
[54:31] and then and then the only way we can
[54:34] get peace is get the things straightened
[54:36] out the way we think it should get
[54:37] straightened out
[54:40] and then even after we straighten out we
[54:42] still don't got peace
[54:45] but that's the way the devil is
[54:48] I'll say when you get the peace of God
[54:50] there's such a power inside of you
[54:54] you are not moved you are not Disturbed
[54:58] you are not worried you are not
[55:00] concerned because you have placed
[55:03] yourself in the hands of God
[55:07] consider him don't consider your
[55:09] problems consider him
[55:12] when peace resides I'm amazed I stand In
[55:16] Awe I I stand back and I say God
[55:20] I don't understand what's going to
[55:22] happen I don't know how it's going to
[55:24] happen I don't know what my future is
[55:26] but God I'm amazed because of the peace
[55:29] of God I feel right now amen
[55:32] amen those Hebrew children were they
[55:34] were facing the furnace you talk about
[55:36] having to to have God on on the on the
[55:39] on the on the spot right it wasn't like
[55:42] well let's go home and think about this
[55:44] for a few days it was do or die you make
[55:47] your decision
[55:49] there was something inside of them
[55:52] I'm not sure what he's going to do but
[55:54] I'll tell you what I ain't bowing down
[55:56] there's a piece of God that's inside of
[55:59] me my decision has been made I'm going
[56:01] to serve the Lord I'm going to love him
[56:03] all the days of my life I will follow
[56:05] him no matter what
[56:08] and I believe that peace kept them in
[56:10] that hour
[56:11] what kept Daniel in that from going to
[56:13] that Lion's Den when he pushed those
[56:15] doors open it was the peace of God in
[56:17] his heart
[56:19] God wasn't standing there with some sort
[56:21] of Sword it could no
[56:23] It's A Love Affair
[56:26] true love affair
[56:30] I don't want
[56:33] a life with horrible things in it
[56:38] but if I have to have a life that has
[56:40] horrible things that happen in it I want
[56:43] the peace of God to keep me
[56:47] his choice what he wants to do
[56:53] you ever just been going through
[56:55] something and you get alone with God and
[56:57] you begin to cry and bathe in his
[57:01] presence
[57:04] and you're you feel so secure brother
[57:08] Mark you're in that
[57:10] Refuge Brother Joseph you're in that
[57:12] City of Refuge
[57:15] and all is well
[57:18] even though it's going like this on the
[57:20] outside in here all is well
[57:23] but if you don't take time to consider
[57:26] God God will not gift you peace because
[57:28] of what you're going through and if
[57:30] you're not feeling it it doesn't mean
[57:32] God don't love you and it doesn't mean
[57:33] God don't care but God wants to be first
[57:36] in your mind first in your heart first
[57:38] in your thoughts he wants to be
[57:40] represented as number one in your life
[57:44] Philippians chapter 4 verse 4 turn with
[57:46] me if you would to here
[57:48] we know these scriptures but
[57:51] it Bears repeating as we're talking a
[57:53] little bit about the peace of God
[57:54] rejoice in the lord always
[57:58] and again I say rejoice well what about
[58:00] what about what no read the word rejoice
[58:03] in the lord always and again uh say
[58:05] rejoice I've already done it Rejoice
[58:07] again
[58:08] just keep rejoicing keep counting your
[58:11] blessings keep your mind on him this is
[58:13] the important ingredient to going from
[58:16] where you're at to where God is calling
[58:17] you to
[58:19] God is calling you to be at peace
[58:22] let your moderation that means your
[58:24] mildness your gentleness
[58:27] let it be made known unto all men
[58:31] the Lord is at hand
[58:36] be careful for nothing don't be anxious
[58:38] about anything but in everything by
[58:41] prayer and supplication with
[58:45] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[58:47] known to God do you ever notice when
[58:50] somebody is complaining to you
[58:54] there's no thankfulness in it they're
[58:57] just Benton they're just complaining
[59:00] but notice when God wants us to come to
[59:03] him
[59:04] not about
[59:09] when God wants us to come to him and
[59:12] we've got this
[59:13] anxious feeling he doesn't want us to be
[59:16] anxious because the only time you're
[59:17] going to be anxious is when something's
[59:19] bothering you is that right
[59:21] and he said do all things without
[59:22] murmuring and complaining so when he we
[59:25] come to God
[59:27] we got our needs he doesn't want us
[59:29] anxiously bringing the knees with
[59:31] complaining look what's going on in my
[59:32] life Lord
[59:34] he wants us to come to him as we know
[59:36] he's going to take care of it
[59:38] [Music]
[59:39] amen so we come with a Thanksgiving Lord
[59:42] I'm glad I'm coming to the source that
[59:45] can help me with my needs
[59:49] amen then make your request known to God
[59:51] so you're properly approaching God just
[59:53] the way that Esther would
[59:55] and the peace of God which passeth all
[59:59] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:00:02] Minds through Christ Jesus
[1:00:05] not through you figuring it out not
[1:00:08] through you orchestrating the way you
[1:00:10] think it needs to go not by you
[1:00:12] intervening but by you subjecting
[1:00:14] yourself to God and trusting God we'll
[1:00:16] do the work amen he will keep you
[1:00:20] now this promise isn't that he's going
[1:00:22] to work everything out the way you want
[1:00:23] it
[1:00:25] Right This Promise is he's going to keep
[1:00:27] you through it all
[1:00:28] and I'll tell you I take that over any
[1:00:30] day over anything over every need being
[1:00:33] provided by every human being that could
[1:00:35] help me
[1:00:37] because there's things coming in our
[1:00:39] life that nobody can help us
[1:00:42] God will put you in a position that you
[1:00:45] know God is the only one that can help
[1:00:48] you
[1:00:48] and at that moment what we need is God
[1:00:57] why does God give you peace
[1:01:03] look every time there was a need
[1:01:06] God just come over and okay you need
[1:01:09] this you need this you need everything
[1:01:10] everything pretty soon which is give me
[1:01:12] give me give me
[1:01:13] don't need nothing
[1:01:16] but imagine that he gave you peace
[1:01:18] instead of
[1:01:19] giving you what you wanted
[1:01:23] what would you rather have
[1:01:25] you know they were all fronting the
[1:01:27] disciples were all frightened because
[1:01:28] Jesus was leaving he says don't let your
[1:01:30] heart be troubled
[1:01:33] look I I'm I'm I will come
[1:01:37] I'm going to send you the comforter my
[1:01:39] father will send you the comforter
[1:01:42] that he may abide in you it'll no longer
[1:01:45] be me here comforting you from the
[1:01:47] outside with a hug but praise God I'll
[1:01:50] be on the inside of you I'll be hugging
[1:01:52] your heart I'll be right there with you
[1:01:54] invisible
[1:01:57] but we know it's him I'm so glad that
[1:02:00] I'm so grateful for Calvary that today I
[1:02:04] can be with Jesus and that Jesus can be
[1:02:06] with me and is so real in my heart that
[1:02:08] no there's nothing can mind it away the
[1:02:11] peace of God is so strong in our lives
[1:02:13] that nothing can shake us
[1:02:17] gifts and callings are without
[1:02:18] repentance
[1:02:22] but peace will not be gifted to us
[1:02:27] there will need to be a strong
[1:02:29] consciousness of keeping God on your
[1:02:31] mind
[1:02:32] do you believe that
[1:02:34] amen verse 8 says finally Brethren
[1:02:36] whatsoever things are true honest just
[1:02:39] pure lovely things of a good report
[1:02:45] let there be any virtue they're in
[1:02:47] Praise think on these things
[1:02:49] the way you think
[1:02:51] your attitude your conversation
[1:02:55] has to pass a very hard exam
[1:03:00] well brother John I'm thinking up
[1:03:02] because it's true they just hit me right
[1:03:04] in the side of the face
[1:03:07] well they just used me brother John they
[1:03:09] made me go on a third mile
[1:03:12] to help them
[1:03:14] it's a true thing and I just want to
[1:03:15] think about it
[1:03:17] well
[1:03:21] is it lovely
[1:03:24] is your is it pure
[1:03:29] is there any strength about what you're
[1:03:31] thinking about does it is it giving you
[1:03:33] strength to want to serve them more
[1:03:37] does it make you want to praise God
[1:03:39] then why are you thinking on it
[1:03:45] we can't expect to let this go any way
[1:03:47] we want to go because we're in control
[1:03:49] of it and then expect God to move on
[1:03:51] your behalf on the scene we got to
[1:03:54] recognize it is the devil that's trying
[1:03:56] to bring you down it's trying to spiral
[1:03:58] you downhill
[1:04:00] and you've got to stop him in his tracks
[1:04:03] that's something that God will not gift
[1:04:06] anybody
[1:04:07] he's not going to come and just take
[1:04:09] over your mind just because you wish him
[1:04:12] to he set you out in a battle and he
[1:04:16] expects you to pick up the sword he
[1:04:18] expects you to put the helmet of
[1:04:19] salvation he expects you to put that
[1:04:22] Shield up to quench all the fiery dust
[1:04:24] of the devil and if we are going to be
[1:04:26] lazy and sit in the back and it just
[1:04:28] doesn't matter don't expect God to gift
[1:04:31] you with peace he is here he's given us
[1:04:34] the remedy but we've got to stand his
[1:04:36] soldiers and fight the good fight of
[1:04:38] faith
[1:04:40] we have to Ace this test
[1:04:42] I mean Ace it
[1:04:45] from one side to the other to have peace
[1:04:47] reside in your life
[1:04:49] those things which you have both learned
[1:04:51] and received and heard and seen to me do
[1:04:54] and the God of Peace shall be with you
[1:04:56] that's right
[1:04:58] um how many can stand and testify I have
[1:05:01] felt the peace of God in my life
[1:05:04] what a testimony
[1:05:06] it's what God wants to see
[1:05:09] he's amazing
[1:05:12] God has been faithful to keep peace in
[1:05:15] my life
[1:05:16] it's all the turmoil that's happened
[1:05:19] with all the needs that I've had
[1:05:21] sometimes it just seems like there's no
[1:05:24] remedy
[1:05:26] but he's kept me
[1:05:29] not in a turmoil
[1:05:32] not in a frenzy
[1:05:35] now that I gotta call every single
[1:05:37] person I know to
[1:05:41] but something on the inside holds me
[1:05:43] it's between me and God
[1:05:47] I'm amazed at the power that there is
[1:05:49] just in the peace of God
[1:05:53] he's a very present help in a time of
[1:05:55] trouble
[1:05:58] sometimes the way the Lord helps us you
[1:06:01] know we got all these needs and we want
[1:06:03] the Lord to help us sometimes the the
[1:06:05] way that he chooses to help us is just
[1:06:07] give us peace
[1:06:10] doesn't take care of the situation the
[1:06:12] way we want it to but he gives you peace
[1:06:15] that's a present help in a time of
[1:06:16] trouble
[1:06:18] you know we're expecting God to do this
[1:06:19] that and the other and God may want to
[1:06:21] help you in another way but he's still a
[1:06:23] present help in a time of need
[1:06:24] [Music]
[1:06:28] I'm amazed of how problems in life can
[1:06:31] make us feel
[1:06:33] so overwhelmed and God then takes those
[1:06:37] problems as opportunities to give you
[1:06:41] peace
[1:06:43] to show he cares about you
[1:06:46] to show that hey I know you don't know
[1:06:49] what's going on
[1:06:50] but I've got this thing orchestrated
[1:06:54] just wait for the part of the song to
[1:06:56] come and you'll see it all come together
[1:07:00] until then I have something for you
[1:07:03] peace I leave with you not as the world
[1:07:05] give out peace unto you God has a peace
[1:07:09] that will surpass every situation
[1:07:12] [Music]
[1:07:14] the Bible says Thou will keep him in
[1:07:16] perfect peace whose mind has stayed on
[1:07:19] thee
[1:07:21] because he trusteth in thee
[1:07:25] you're trusting in the Lord
[1:07:28] God is ready much bigger than all of our
[1:07:30] problems
[1:07:32] I'm amazed of how God takes care of us
[1:07:36] I really am
[1:07:38] we take so much for granted
[1:07:41] whatever you have you you can have a
[1:07:43] tendency of taking it for granted
[1:07:46] people you've heard this people that
[1:07:48] actually went through the Great
[1:07:49] Depression
[1:07:50] even if they got everything paid they
[1:07:53] got lots of money
[1:07:54] finally they still live
[1:07:57] in in such a way
[1:08:00] because of how the tribulation
[1:08:03] a Great Tribulation no great
[1:08:06] depression thank you thank you I'm so
[1:08:09] grateful to you all that really know
[1:08:11] what I'm saying without me having to say
[1:08:13] it it just takes a lot of pressure off
[1:08:14] me
[1:08:15] but you see things can lay an influence
[1:08:19] on us
[1:08:21] and
[1:08:23] if it wasn't for God in our lives taking
[1:08:25] care of us
[1:08:28] we would have no anchor honestly
[1:08:33] but he has brought us through so many
[1:08:34] things and he's much bigger than all of
[1:08:36] our problems we do not have to depend on
[1:08:39] herself
[1:08:43] we have to do our job
[1:08:45] but we don't have to depend on ourselves
[1:08:48] my God shall supply all of your need
[1:08:51] according his riches and Glory
[1:08:54] forget about you having to do it
[1:08:58] you'll fall flat on your face over and
[1:09:00] over I've talked to men who have tried
[1:09:02] they have had businesses I I've spent
[1:09:06] time with people trying and telling me
[1:09:08] they're trying and things aren't working
[1:09:10] and you know what they're depending on
[1:09:12] themselves
[1:09:14] and I believe God wants us to do our
[1:09:17] part no doubt about it
[1:09:22] but God wants to be first in your life
[1:09:26] God wants us to depend on him
[1:09:29] I'm amazed at how faithful God really
[1:09:32] takes care of us
[1:09:34] I'm amazed that there's only one thing
[1:09:36] that it requires of us and that's to put
[1:09:38] him first
[1:09:39] I'll do I'll handle everything I'll do
[1:09:42] everything I'll take care of everything
[1:09:43] put me first
[1:09:46] Jesus said our heavenly father knows
[1:09:48] what you have need of
[1:09:51] but seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[1:09:54] his righteousness and all these things
[1:09:56] shall be added unto you
[1:09:59] amen what a promise
[1:10:04] um
[1:10:05] I'm amazed that he takes my problems
[1:10:08] and produces opportunity
[1:10:11] to give me peace and to meet my needs
[1:10:15] he may not give me what I want but he
[1:10:18] gives me what I need cast all your care
[1:10:21] upon him for he careth for you you ever
[1:10:24] cast your care in somebody
[1:10:29] you almost like complain
[1:10:31] you know what I'm talking about
[1:10:35] you shouldn't have I need
[1:10:37] come on
[1:10:39] who wants to go with me on this
[1:10:42] who wants me to just bypass this part of
[1:10:44] the situ this part of the sermon
[1:10:47] God wants us to cast our cares on him
[1:10:51] he cares for you more than any other
[1:10:53] human being can care for you he's he's a
[1:10:55] friend that's ticking culture than a
[1:10:57] brother
[1:10:58] God will arrange
[1:11:02] that you have to look to him
[1:11:06] even if there's somebody that has helped
[1:11:08] you uh a thousand times in life
[1:11:13] God doesn't like it
[1:11:16] that you don't depend on him
[1:11:19] and he will arrange it he will make it
[1:11:23] to where you
[1:11:26] have to look to him
[1:11:28] amen
[1:11:31] Saul let's just take the word cast your
[1:11:34] cares upon Him He cares for you
[1:11:37] God's long suffering it's incredible how
[1:11:40] many has been a beneficiary of the
[1:11:42] long-sufferings of God
[1:11:44] he waited 120 years in the days of Noah
[1:11:47] he's waiting right now for the cup of
[1:11:49] iniquity to be full
[1:11:51] he is patiently waited for us
[1:11:55] when for us to surrender our heart
[1:11:59] even now when God wants us to do
[1:12:01] something he waits and often suffers a
[1:12:05] long time until we do the thing that we
[1:12:07] need to do
[1:12:08] and I'm amazed at how long-suffering God
[1:12:12] is to me
[1:12:16] now look back and I say
[1:12:18] what
[1:12:19] what were you thinking what were you
[1:12:22] doing what was going on
[1:12:26] Mercy rewrote my life
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:30] if it wasn't for God we wouldn't be here
[1:12:33] and I know that things could be better I
[1:12:36] understand that we look at our lives we
[1:12:38] we look at our homes we look at our we
[1:12:41] haven't reached the goal of so many
[1:12:42] things have interfered but I'm telling
[1:12:44] you if it wasn't for the grace of God we
[1:12:46] would all be out just serving our own
[1:12:49] flesh in any way we we wouldn't even
[1:12:51] care about being in the house of God we
[1:12:53] wouldn't care about our brothers and
[1:12:54] sisters
[1:12:58] God's patience is amazing
[1:13:02] Jesus said in your patience possess your
[1:13:05] souls
[1:13:06] well brother John what do I need to do
[1:13:08] that for my soul was saved
[1:13:13] do you possess it
[1:13:15] you got control of what's going on
[1:13:19] possessing your soul is not easy
[1:13:21] it takes time patience learning to yield
[1:13:24] to the Lord
[1:13:28] so we need to get rid of that and I
[1:13:30] don't know the terminology once saved
[1:13:32] always say once free doesn't always
[1:13:34] predest I say you know my soul is taken
[1:13:35] care of I don't have to worry about we
[1:13:37] need to get rid of that thinking
[1:13:39] amen it has its place but as soon as you
[1:13:43] take the word out of its place
[1:13:49] then it don't keep you
[1:13:52] and what we're looking for is something
[1:13:53] to keep us in the center of his will in
[1:13:56] the center of the word in the center of
[1:13:59] pleasing him and pressing in towards
[1:14:01] that
[1:14:03] hi Colleen amen
[1:14:06] more patience is one thing that we all
[1:14:08] could benefit from do you believe that
[1:14:10] nobody likes to go through trials I
[1:14:12] understand
[1:14:14] but we do need patience right
[1:14:16] I was talking to a man just yesterday
[1:14:19] and one of the needs that he had was
[1:14:22] is that he just needed patience
[1:14:30] we all need patience from time to time
[1:14:32] we all could benefit to have more
[1:14:33] patience we all have said I wish I would
[1:14:35] have bit my tongue I wish I won the bit
[1:14:37] my lit I wish I would have bit my lip I
[1:14:39] wish I I wouldn't have said something I
[1:14:41] wish I would have just been quiet
[1:14:45] I'm amazed how God can take what we're
[1:14:48] lacking in our lives
[1:14:50] and make our lives more complete with
[1:14:53] just patience
[1:14:55] with just patience Hebrews 10 36 says
[1:14:58] for ye have need of patience how many
[1:15:01] years need of patience
[1:15:02] after that you have done the will of God
[1:15:05] you might receive the promise
[1:15:08] there is a will of God for all of our
[1:15:10] Lives amen James says knowing this that
[1:15:13] the Trine of your faith
[1:15:15] work with patience
[1:15:18] but let patients have her perfect work
[1:15:22] that ye may be perfect and entire
[1:15:24] wanting nothing
[1:15:29] God can take what we're lacking and make
[1:15:33] us whole
[1:15:36] we never think about it like that we
[1:15:38] think I can't be whole till I get what I
[1:15:41] want till I get this thing straight to
[1:15:43] this to this to this then I can be whole
[1:15:46] no you need to let patience have its
[1:15:48] perfect work and that will make you
[1:15:50] whole wanting nothing amen
[1:15:53] I'll take that any day over having to
[1:15:57] have every situation right I'll tell you
[1:15:58] I don't know how you
[1:16:01] older brothers
[1:16:03] sisters feel
[1:16:06] but I wish I had half the wisdom that I
[1:16:08] have now when I was young raising my
[1:16:10] children
[1:16:12] I think I feel like I would have did a
[1:16:14] better job but that doesn't mean I would
[1:16:16] have
[1:16:18] I didn't say that but I do know I've
[1:16:22] heard this many times I wish I had the
[1:16:24] wisdom that I have now that it that when
[1:16:27] I was younger
[1:16:28] because you could apply those things
[1:16:31] but just take the wisdom
[1:16:33] from above that's James is talking to us
[1:16:36] about just let patients have its own way
[1:16:40] amen
[1:16:42] amen it's working something
[1:16:44] working something we're so quick to
[1:16:46] straighten things up we need to be quick
[1:16:49] to trust God quick to lean on him quick
[1:16:52] to say God Have Your Way in this
[1:16:54] situation and because of that trust a
[1:16:57] peace comes into your heart
[1:17:00] I love the word of God I love that we
[1:17:03] have something to direct Our Lives I
[1:17:05] have something that can be applied to
[1:17:07] our lives to make it more real
[1:17:11] I don't want God just on the outside
[1:17:14] I want God on the inside taking care of
[1:17:18] the inside amen I'm amazed how he can
[1:17:21] take nothing and make something out of
[1:17:23] it amen he took the Earth that was
[1:17:25] without form and void and he made the
[1:17:28] beauty that you and I behold the the all
[1:17:31] the animals and the the plants and all
[1:17:34] the things we see and we look at we just
[1:17:36] take a moment we go wow that is awesome
[1:17:39] looking
[1:17:41] just taking the time to consider and it
[1:17:44] all started with nothing
[1:17:46] and that's our God he can take nothing
[1:17:49] and make something with him he can take
[1:17:51] our lives that was without form without
[1:17:54] void it was just a nature full of sin
[1:17:58] and selfishness and didn't care about
[1:18:01] anything and he can make a beautiful
[1:18:03] life out of it he can make it to where
[1:18:05] people look at you and they don't see
[1:18:07] you anymore they see Jesus Christ in you
[1:18:09] they see something you couldn't do it
[1:18:11] would take the power of God to create
[1:18:13] such a beautiful nature
[1:18:18] I love the word
[1:18:21] I'm amazed of what he's done in my life
[1:18:24] don't you feel that way
[1:18:29] it's not bragging about you
[1:18:32] it's breaking about God changing you
[1:18:37] and you need to declare it you need to
[1:18:39] publish it
[1:18:42] you need to give God thanks and glory
[1:18:45] for what he's done in your life amen
[1:18:48] that was our opening scripture
[1:18:50] we can't
[1:18:52] go back and just you know while we're
[1:18:55] saved and now we're just going to deal
[1:18:56] with everything on our own no
[1:18:58] God's now coming around before God came
[1:19:00] in our life we did everything
[1:19:03] right we paid our bills we went to work
[1:19:07] we out fought our argued we did whatever
[1:19:10] we had to do to deal with life
[1:19:13] the way we thought it needed to be dealt
[1:19:15] with but then God comes into our life he
[1:19:18] makes it beautiful he makes all things
[1:19:21] beautiful in his time
[1:19:24] we start handling things the way God
[1:19:26] handles things
[1:19:27] Ephesians chapter 2 turn with me if you
[1:19:30] would
[1:19:38] wow I'm half done
[1:19:40] with three quarters of the time gone
[1:19:46] this means not only do you need to
[1:19:48] listen real good
[1:19:50] you need to pray that it speeds up
[1:19:54] Ephesians 2 we've walked according verse
[1:19:57] 2 to the course of this world according
[1:19:59] to the prince of the power of the Earth
[1:20:00] the spirit that now worketh and the
[1:20:02] children of Disobedience so this Spirit
[1:20:03] was in you that's not in you now
[1:20:06] but now it's in the children of
[1:20:08] disobedience
[1:20:09] among whom also we all had our
[1:20:11] conversations in times past in the lust
[1:20:14] of the flesh fulfilling the desires of
[1:20:15] our flesh and of our mind and we're by
[1:20:18] Nature the children of anger
[1:20:21] upset
[1:20:23] Wrath
[1:20:24] even as others
[1:20:27] but God who is rich in Mercy for his
[1:20:30] great love wherewith he loved us even
[1:20:33] when we were dead and our sins have
[1:20:35] quickened us together with Christ by
[1:20:37] grace are you saved
[1:20:39] and his race is up together made us to
[1:20:42] sit in this one place in Heavenly places
[1:20:44] in Christ Jesus
[1:20:46] that in the ages to come he might show
[1:20:48] the the exceeding Riches of his grace in
[1:20:51] his kindness towards us
[1:20:54] and he's doing it through Jesus Christ
[1:20:56] for by grace are you safe through faith
[1:20:59] and it's not of yourself it is the gift
[1:21:01] of God
[1:21:05] he gives it to whomsoever will repent
[1:21:10] I believe that with all my heart
[1:21:13] it's not of Works lest any man should
[1:21:16] boast
[1:21:18] for we are the workmen we are his
[1:21:20] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[1:21:23] good works notice what we're created
[1:21:25] unto
[1:21:26] no longer working for ourselves
[1:21:28] but living for others
[1:21:31] which God have before ordained that we
[1:21:33] should actually walk in them
[1:21:36] now we heard a little bit about God's
[1:21:40] Great Masterpiece Jesus Christ the other
[1:21:42] night
[1:21:43] but God is a great master builder in our
[1:21:46] lives
[1:21:47] and he's building Us in that same image
[1:21:49] as Jesus Christ and are built upon the
[1:21:52] foundation the Apostles of the prophets
[1:21:54] Jesus Christ himself being the Chief
[1:21:57] Cornerstone in whom all the building
[1:21:59] that's all of us Saints are fitly framed
[1:22:04] together
[1:22:06] amen did you you ever like something
[1:22:09] kind of like broke and you're trying to
[1:22:11] piece it back together
[1:22:14] and sometimes you could just like you
[1:22:16] know exactly how it goes back together
[1:22:18] just just like the Chinese ticket
[1:22:21] it just goes together
[1:22:23] and this is it and then sometimes we've
[1:22:26] had to pick some pieces up and try to
[1:22:28] put it together we can't quite it's just
[1:22:30] not matching you think it goes here but
[1:22:32] something's missing
[1:22:34] God doesn't want a church that's having
[1:22:35] a hard time working together
[1:22:39] well it's just not fitting into my idea
[1:22:41] well I don't care about your idea
[1:22:44] and you shouldn't really care about
[1:22:48] we need to Endeavor to keep the unity of
[1:22:51] the spirits and it it takes work
[1:22:56] I'll tell you what has made me so
[1:22:58] successful a lot in life is learning
[1:23:00] that I can yield to others
[1:23:05] I can yield to somebody else I don't
[1:23:07] have to brother Stan knows this
[1:23:09] he's one of the easiest men to work with
[1:23:11] for has been for me
[1:23:15] you don't have to do things my way
[1:23:20] but we are going to do them together
[1:23:23] so that means if I have to yield I will
[1:23:25] yield
[1:23:29] and if we learn to have that christ-like
[1:23:31] nature see God's the same way he'll give
[1:23:34] us his will he'll say this is the way
[1:23:36] walkie in it right but if you choose not
[1:23:39] to he'll let you go he'll let you build
[1:23:41] your life do your thing whatever you
[1:23:43] want to do
[1:23:46] right but somewhere down the road it's
[1:23:47] not going to work
[1:23:51] because God's way is the right way
[1:23:57] God has taken nobodies
[1:23:59] like you and I and has made somebodies
[1:24:03] can you say Amen to that I don't want to
[1:24:06] hurry by his pride here but I can
[1:24:08] testify God has taken a nobody and made
[1:24:10] somebody
[1:24:16] I myself am nothing today
[1:24:20] just like I was then
[1:24:22] then I didn't have the knowledge and I
[1:24:25] thought it was somebody
[1:24:27] today I still know I'm a nobody but he
[1:24:29] can take this nobody and make somebody
[1:24:31] for his glory
[1:24:36] he has taken lives without character
[1:24:39] and he's brought character into them
[1:24:42] Jesus said you must be born again you
[1:24:45] must be born again
[1:24:47] you can't make it without being born
[1:24:49] again
[1:24:50] your old nature must die
[1:24:54] your hate must die and your love must be
[1:24:58] born Anew his love must be born Anew in
[1:25:02] you your old nature must rot his nature
[1:25:05] must come into your life amen it's not a
[1:25:08] do's and don'ts it is a is a
[1:25:12] surrendering of your life and having
[1:25:14] God's life come inside of you now that
[1:25:16] is a reality brothers and sisters
[1:25:19] and I don't know where you want to stand
[1:25:21] with this but I'll say it like this
[1:25:24] the Bride of Jesus Christ does not stop
[1:25:26] that process until she awakes in his
[1:25:29] likeness
[1:25:32] you think about job and how great a man
[1:25:34] he was and he was great in fact he
[1:25:36] testified to Satan he was perfect and
[1:25:38] there was none like him
[1:25:40] but I'll tell you what I liked about job
[1:25:42] he never acted like he was there
[1:25:46] like he he met and I don't have to do
[1:25:48] any more here's a man that was perfect
[1:25:51] and he still kept himself humble he
[1:25:54] still wanted to please God
[1:25:56] that's what I like about Paul
[1:26:00] and that's what I like about every
[1:26:01] spirit that yields himself to God
[1:26:04] second Corinthians 5 17 therefore If any
[1:26:07] man be in Christ he's a new Creature if
[1:26:09] anybody agrees with this word say amen
[1:26:12] amen you're not don't don't worry about
[1:26:14] me
[1:26:15] don't worry about me
[1:26:17] love the word amen love the word agree
[1:26:21] with the word you want to change in your
[1:26:23] life get into the word don't just say
[1:26:26] Amen because it's time to say Amen
[1:26:28] say Amen because you want it inside of
[1:26:31] you show God your hunger show them your
[1:26:34] thirst show them you mean business with
[1:26:36] him
[1:26:37] [Music]
[1:26:38] if you don't it'll be like water going
[1:26:40] off a deck's back you'll walk out of
[1:26:42] here
[1:26:43] God help us to receive the word this
[1:26:45] morning
[1:26:47] therefore If any man be in Christ he's a
[1:26:49] new creature old things are passed away
[1:26:51] behold all things are become new
[1:26:54] all things
[1:26:55] well I'll tell you I don't gotta look
[1:26:57] very far in my life to see I need some
[1:26:59] new things
[1:27:00] so I'm going to press into that and all
[1:27:04] things are of God who have reconciled us
[1:27:08] to himself by Jesus Christ and given
[1:27:10] unto us the ministry of reconciliation
[1:27:13] man is this something Brother Joseph is
[1:27:17] this some plaque that I could just put
[1:27:18] on the wall I got the ministry of
[1:27:20] reconciliation
[1:27:22] or did he actually give me a
[1:27:24] responsibility
[1:27:27] because you know what I'd rather have
[1:27:29] the plaque
[1:27:34] you are written Epistles
[1:27:39] your life
[1:27:41] is now the plaque in demonstration
[1:27:45] reaching out
[1:27:47] for someone who's not as fortunate as
[1:27:49] you
[1:27:51] someone who's not living
[1:27:52] like you're living not doing and I'll
[1:27:55] tell you what
[1:27:57] even if
[1:27:59] 98 of their life is perfect God can use
[1:28:02] you to help two percent
[1:28:05] come on
[1:28:09] the Revelation that I got
[1:28:12] is that we're Christ to all people
[1:28:16] he has given us a responsibility to help
[1:28:19] every single person
[1:28:22] I'm amazed that he took my life it was
[1:28:24] full of corruption full of sin and in
[1:28:27] his hands he did something with it
[1:28:29] I could have been stuck
[1:28:32] like the world
[1:28:33] living for myself
[1:28:36] I could have been stuck in a church
[1:28:41] living for myself
[1:28:45] but he took my life and he took out that
[1:28:48] Spirit of selfishness right
[1:28:52] right and he showed me the real beauty
[1:28:53] of life is living for others
[1:28:56] it's a Ministry
[1:28:59] and it's not a
[1:29:01] eight to five Ministry
[1:29:03] it's a Ministry
[1:29:06] he does everything beautiful in his time
[1:29:09] and if there's something in your life
[1:29:10] that you would like to see God make more
[1:29:13] of him give him some more of your time
[1:29:16] spent some time in prayer Pray more read
[1:29:19] the word more just place that there and
[1:29:22] say God you know I'm not satisfied with
[1:29:25] this in my life and I want to see the
[1:29:27] beauty of your character in me and he
[1:29:29] will do it he will do it because it is a
[1:29:32] love affair and if you want it bad
[1:29:34] enough God will take every wrong desire
[1:29:37] out he'll take every selfish thing out
[1:29:39] and he'll make your whole life for
[1:29:41] others
[1:29:44] and as long as you say
[1:29:46] I think I'm doing pretty good the way
[1:29:48] I'm at Brother John
[1:29:50] the more chance you're going to have to
[1:29:52] stay right there
[1:29:55] Psalms 92 verse 4 says for thou Lord
[1:29:58] have made me glad through thy Work
[1:30:02] through thy Work in your life I will
[1:30:04] Triumph in the works of thy hands O Lord
[1:30:08] how great are thy works and how and thy
[1:30:13] thoughts are deep very deep
[1:30:16] and thy thoughts are very deep oh my God
[1:30:20] does not a shadow thinker about us
[1:30:23] people need the Lord
[1:30:27] God wants to work in people's life
[1:30:30] God wants to Triumph
[1:30:32] through the works of his hands
[1:30:36] to help people
[1:30:37] but people are bound with demons of self
[1:30:41] and it's sad that so many people have
[1:30:44] not found the true Liberty
[1:30:46] of living for others
[1:30:50] people want Liberty to do what they want
[1:30:52] but they're bound to their desires
[1:30:56] true Liberty is living for others
[1:30:59] true Liberty is doing the will of God
[1:31:03] true Liberty
[1:31:04] is having the right balance
[1:31:08] you know what I love this word and this
[1:31:11] morning you can love it with me
[1:31:13] or you can despise the truth that's up
[1:31:16] to you
[1:31:17] I thank God that He Set Me Free From
[1:31:19] Myself
[1:31:22] it's sad when you see people they're
[1:31:25] bound with more demons than they even
[1:31:28] realize
[1:31:30] because it's all about them life is all
[1:31:32] about them
[1:31:38] he that the son is set free is free
[1:31:40] indeed
[1:31:42] I'm amazed that God can take nothing
[1:31:47] and make something with it
[1:31:50] just as the devil can't do anything
[1:31:51] unless he's got a vessel to work through
[1:31:53] God can't do anything unless he's got a
[1:31:55] vessel to work through we are his hands
[1:31:57] his feet his mouth we are the expression
[1:31:59] of his desire helping one another
[1:32:02] and
[1:32:03] his heart
[1:32:05] of expressing
[1:32:07] life to others
[1:32:10] needs to be pulsating out of us all the
[1:32:12] time because God wants to take our time
[1:32:14] and use it if we only give him a little
[1:32:16] bit he'll only take and use a little bit
[1:32:18] but God wants all of our life amen yes
[1:32:21] we got to go to work yes we got to eat
[1:32:23] yes we got to have some family time but
[1:32:26] you know what
[1:32:27] God deserves your life
[1:32:30] he deserves to take your life and do
[1:32:32] what he wants to do with it
[1:32:37] how he's thankful for for God in your
[1:32:39] life
[1:32:41] he'll give
[1:32:43] his same nature that he has to you about
[1:32:47] caring for Souls
[1:32:50] the Bible says knowing the terror of the
[1:32:52] lord we persuade men and it is the love
[1:32:56] of God in his people
[1:32:58] that constrains them to reach out and
[1:33:00] help somebody
[1:33:02] I mean there's a lot of people that say
[1:33:04] come to my church I'll tell you what you
[1:33:06] give a little bit extra in the office
[1:33:07] and I'll tell you I'll play a I'll play
[1:33:09] a double portion upon you
[1:33:16] how about the man that'll give and give
[1:33:19] and give and not ask anything for in
[1:33:22] return that's the nature of our heavenly
[1:33:25] father
[1:33:26] when that nature comes inside of us
[1:33:28] we're expressing that same Ministry
[1:33:31] we're living out that Ministry that he's
[1:33:34] given us he's made us ambassadors to
[1:33:37] reconcile
[1:33:38] the whole world or as many as Paul said
[1:33:40] I became all things to all men that I
[1:33:42] might win some of them to Christ in the
[1:33:44] message Called Love brother man says I
[1:33:46] asked my wife not long ago I said I want
[1:33:49] to ask you something honey
[1:33:52] I said what is the real true value
[1:33:54] placed on
[1:33:57] I believe I told you the other night
[1:33:59] what the true value is he said nothing
[1:34:02] but lost
[1:34:04] Souls
[1:34:07] he said that's the real true value
[1:34:09] nothing but lost souls
[1:34:11] is the only thing that's got any value
[1:34:13] to it he said money passes away homes
[1:34:16] Decay and go away everything in Earth
[1:34:20] moves away the only value lasting value
[1:34:23] he said I'd rather have one soul in
[1:34:27] glory
[1:34:28] that I've won that I've won to Christ
[1:34:32] to know and see that light of God
[1:34:35] circling around that Soul through all
[1:34:38] eternity and my name being associated
[1:34:42] with that than to have every penny of
[1:34:45] money in this whole earth
[1:34:48] because I'd lose it all
[1:34:51] but you send but what you send there is
[1:34:54] eternal amen
[1:34:56] amen and that's the reason
[1:34:58] well I'm trying
[1:35:00] God
[1:35:02] is faithful
[1:35:04] if we can just have his mind long enough
[1:35:06] to care about the things that he cares
[1:35:09] about
[1:35:10] it's easy for me to go buy my fourth
[1:35:14] house my 16th boat my 34th car
[1:35:18] and say you know what God cares about me
[1:35:21] and what I want it's easy to say that
[1:35:23] it's easy to have that attitude
[1:35:25] but I tell you what you got to put the
[1:35:28] CL you got to put the Robes of humility
[1:35:30] on the clothes of humility to say not my
[1:35:33] will Lord but thy will be done
[1:35:37] God knows the true value in life
[1:35:41] how many of you been Amazed by God's
[1:35:43] faithfulness in your life
[1:35:45] yes
[1:35:46] [Music]
[1:35:47] but she's been so faithful to us
[1:35:50] his mercies are faithful
[1:35:53] we
[1:35:55] we've all needed deliverance from all
[1:35:57] sorts of things and we still do at times
[1:35:59] do you know what
[1:36:01] God's faithful to deliver us
[1:36:04] the Bible says if we confess our sins he
[1:36:06] is faithful and just to forgive us and
[1:36:10] to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[1:36:14] you talk about the beauty
[1:36:16] now we can walk outside and we don't
[1:36:19] have to worry about if I make a mistake
[1:36:22] I'm going to be eternally Damned
[1:36:25] because we know we have a loving father
[1:36:26] there that when we slip and fall he sees
[1:36:30] our hearts desire we get back up and we
[1:36:32] say Lord I'm so sorry I'm so sorry Lord
[1:36:35] I want to please you and he's right
[1:36:37] there not to hold that thing over your
[1:36:39] head
[1:36:40] right that's the faithfulness of our God
[1:36:43] Psalms 86 13 for great is thy mercy
[1:36:47] toward me and thou has delivered my soul
[1:36:50] from the lowest hell
[1:36:53] we've all had
[1:36:55] Red Sea experiences where just God came
[1:36:57] in her life
[1:36:59] and he
[1:37:01] took care of the situation
[1:37:03] the children of Israel couldn't do
[1:37:05] anything in their situation
[1:37:08] they they left the world
[1:37:11] and here they were led by the spirit of
[1:37:14] God
[1:37:15] they thought they were being chased
[1:37:18] but they were being led
[1:37:20] and as they were being led they were
[1:37:22] being chased by the devil and they were
[1:37:25] cornered between some Mountains and the
[1:37:28] Red Sea and there was no way out
[1:37:32] and God delivered yes amen
[1:37:35] and God does that in every one of our
[1:37:37] lives
[1:37:40] and we need to stop and consider
[1:37:42] how great our God is
[1:37:46] and if we just did that more instead of
[1:37:48] worried about this next problem we're
[1:37:50] dealing with and then the next problem
[1:37:51] we're dealing with and the next thing
[1:37:52] we're wanting and the next place we want
[1:37:54] to go and the next thing that we're we
[1:37:56] need to take time to consider God in our
[1:37:59] life that he is amazing and that we need
[1:38:02] to give him the glory and the honor and
[1:38:04] to praise all the time and let
[1:38:06] everything else go
[1:38:09] what happens
[1:38:11] when you start worrying about your next
[1:38:13] problem
[1:38:14] well as we got to do is look at the
[1:38:15] children of Israel when they got another
[1:38:17] site they were rejoicing they were happy
[1:38:19] they were excited but the more problems
[1:38:22] they encountered the more they murmured
[1:38:24] the more they complained the more they
[1:38:25] said we should just go back to I told
[1:38:27] Moses don't you do this
[1:38:30] are you with me and I'll tell you are we
[1:38:34] staying on the side of worship are we
[1:38:37] staying on the side of Praise are we
[1:38:39] staying on the side of Thanksgiving are
[1:38:41] we really considering how great our God
[1:38:43] is are we continuing to be bothered by
[1:38:46] things now look says God is trying to
[1:38:49] take us from where we're at to a place
[1:38:52] that we live Victorious over the devil
[1:38:54] the devil is under our feet not on our
[1:38:57] inner ears and on our shoulders and
[1:38:59] trying to keep us down
[1:39:02] he is here to to lead us through
[1:39:06] remind them
[1:39:08] of the Red Sea remind them of the things
[1:39:11] he's done for you already
[1:39:16] it's a relationship
[1:39:21] limitations chapter 3 verse 22 says it
[1:39:24] is of the Lord's Mercies
[1:39:27] that we are not consumed
[1:39:31] because his compassion failed not
[1:39:35] they are new every morning
[1:39:38] great is thy faithfulness
[1:39:41] I'll tell you
[1:39:43] if you just
[1:39:45] if you could pause just a moment
[1:39:49] in your life
[1:39:51] and look at all the times
[1:39:54] that you could not handle something
[1:39:58] and God took care of it for you amen
[1:40:00] amen
[1:40:02] you didn't do what you should have done
[1:40:08] and God had mercy on you and he just
[1:40:11] took care of it amen
[1:40:13] that'll make us want to come to the
[1:40:15] house of God and worship him to praise
[1:40:18] him to give him thanks you know so often
[1:40:21] we forget
[1:40:23] about the things he's done in the past
[1:40:25] and he don't want us to forget
[1:40:28] he wants us to forget about all the
[1:40:30] problems that we're having in the praise
[1:40:32] him that he's going to take care of them
[1:40:36] great is thy faithfulness
[1:40:40] I want to read a scripture and I'm not
[1:40:42] going to get to all that I want to but
[1:40:44] this scripture it Bears repeating second
[1:40:47] Timothy chapter 2 verse 13.
[1:40:50] second Timothy chapter 2 verse 13. I
[1:40:54] want you to think about how good and
[1:40:57] faithful God has been to you
[1:40:59] the scripture says if we believe not
[1:41:02] yet he abideth faithful
[1:41:06] he cannot deny his own
[1:41:12] I'm so grateful that when I have denied
[1:41:16] him
[1:41:17] he could not deny me
[1:41:20] I'm so grateful amen amen that when Paul
[1:41:23] when Peter cursed denied
[1:41:27] ignored gave up forsook
[1:41:30] the Lord that God did not deny him
[1:41:33] that's right amen
[1:41:36] and I'll tell you we have come short and
[1:41:38] we have failed and we have denied to
[1:41:40] stand for the truth of this word for the
[1:41:43] mercy of God sometimes we have not
[1:41:45] wanted to be merciful to somebody
[1:41:46] sometimes we've not wanted to love
[1:41:48] somebody sometimes we don't want to lay
[1:41:50] down our life sometimes we've been so
[1:41:52] selfish with our life
[1:41:55] and God was merciful to us
[1:41:59] and we just need to stop and consider
[1:42:03] great our God is amen and when we do
[1:42:05] we'll see he we're amazed because he's
[1:42:09] amazing
[1:42:10] we're Spellbound we're as it were I'd
[1:42:13] like to use that word but I'll tell you
[1:42:15] we stand in all we stand in with our
[1:42:18] mouths wide open with our hearts just so
[1:42:21] humbled because our God takes care of us
[1:42:26] He's Worthy
[1:42:27] to be praised
[1:42:30] he's worthy to be praised
[1:42:34] well I'm going to have to just
[1:42:38] you stop eating I stop preaching that's
[1:42:40] just all the others to it but I'm
[1:42:42] telling you I always save the best for
[1:42:44] last
[1:42:51] you remember there was a man called
[1:42:52] Legion remember what happened to him
[1:42:58] even the Devils inside of him screamed
[1:43:00] out
[1:43:01] I ajure Thee
[1:43:03] I adjour Thee by God don't torment us
[1:43:07] hear the devil was using the name was
[1:43:10] using God
[1:43:12] to tell God what to do
[1:43:16] the devil's a liar
[1:43:18] and you know what he likes to do he
[1:43:19] likes to hide in people
[1:43:22] because as soon as Jesus saw him
[1:43:26] that that devil wanted to hide
[1:43:30] didn't want to have to come out
[1:43:35] but God
[1:43:36] had Deliverance in store for this man
[1:43:39] did he
[1:43:41] the Bible says that when he was
[1:43:42] delivered that he really wanted he
[1:43:45] besought Jesus oh Jesus let me just stay
[1:43:48] with you that's right I want to stay
[1:43:50] with you
[1:43:52] and what did Jesus say
[1:43:54] no
[1:43:56] he said Return to thine own house and
[1:43:59] show how great things God has done unto
[1:44:02] thee amen God wanted this man to go tell
[1:44:07] everybody how great God is
[1:44:09] God wants us to leave here and go tell
[1:44:12] everybody how great God is how he has
[1:44:15] delivered us how he has blessed us how
[1:44:17] he has set us in Heavenly places how
[1:44:19] he's changed our nature how he's done so
[1:44:22] many great things in our life
[1:44:25] Psalms 26 verse 7 that I may publish
[1:44:28] with the voice of Thanksgiving and tell
[1:44:31] of all thy wondrous Works Lord I have
[1:44:33] loved the habitation of the house and
[1:44:36] the place where thine honor dwelleth
[1:44:41] how many believe that God's honor dwells
[1:44:43] here
[1:44:50] I'm amazed that there is a way that I'm
[1:44:52] speeding up just so you know I'm still
[1:44:54] not doing all my notes so you just be
[1:44:55] thankful
[1:44:58] that's an order
[1:45:00] I'm amazed that there's a way to get the
[1:45:01] devil off your back
[1:45:04] you know sometimes you can Shout
[1:45:08] you can tell them
[1:45:11] you get mad you can rebuke them
[1:45:15] and he's still there
[1:45:19] why
[1:45:21] why
[1:45:22] you know there's a way to get the devil
[1:45:24] off your back
[1:45:27] all you have to do is submit to God amen
[1:45:32] amen
[1:45:35] to met yourself unto God
[1:45:38] then you'll have strength to resist them
[1:45:41] because you're not bigger than the devil
[1:45:48] but when you humble yourself under the
[1:45:50] mighty hand of God you submit yourself
[1:45:52] to God then you can stand there with the
[1:45:55] authority that you have met his
[1:45:57] requirements
[1:45:59] and the devil don't even want to be by
[1:46:01] you anymore
[1:46:02] there's a way to get the devil off your
[1:46:05] back
[1:46:06] we don't understand all the ways that
[1:46:08] God
[1:46:10] does things and we know his thoughts are
[1:46:13] higher and his ways are higher
[1:46:16] but everything that God does is good
[1:46:21] everything he created in the beginning
[1:46:23] when he got done Creed he said it is
[1:46:25] good and everything that he does or
[1:46:28] allows in your life is good
[1:46:31] God will never be accused
[1:46:35] will never be found guilty let me reword
[1:46:38] that on the day of judgment
[1:46:41] that he was nothing but good amen
[1:46:45] that's why we're supposed to count it
[1:46:47] all joy with our fiery trials
[1:46:49] God ain't messing up God ain't there's
[1:46:52] just God didn't come down here to build
[1:46:54] our kingdom
[1:46:57] he came down here to get us out of this
[1:46:58] place
[1:46:59] and to build his kingdom inside of us
[1:47:03] Psalms 31 verse 19 says oh how great is
[1:47:06] thy goodness which thou has laid up for
[1:47:08] them that feare thee
[1:47:11] when we stop to consider God's goodness
[1:47:13] it changes our perspective
[1:47:17] Romans 2 4 says at one time we despised
[1:47:22] The Riches of God's goodness
[1:47:25] and the forbearance and the
[1:47:26] long-suffering not knowing that it was
[1:47:29] actually the goodness of God that was
[1:47:31] leading us to repentance
[1:47:36] but today we do know
[1:47:38] it's his goodness that leads us to
[1:47:39] repentance
[1:47:40] it's a Godly sorrow that works
[1:47:43] repentance unto salvation
[1:47:46] Psalms 139 verse 17. how precious
[1:47:51] are thy thoughts unto me
[1:47:54] oh God and how great is the sum of them
[1:47:58] so we don't understand all God's lives
[1:48:00] we don't understand his ways we don't
[1:48:01] understand but we know they're very
[1:48:04] precious the thoughts that God has
[1:48:06] towards us and actually the sum of them
[1:48:09] the sum of God's thoughts to us are
[1:48:12] amazing did you ever want to know what
[1:48:15] God sums you up with
[1:48:18] how he sums you up with what he really
[1:48:20] thinks
[1:48:22] the Bible says his thoughts towards us
[1:48:24] are very precious he doesn't think ill
[1:48:27] of us he doesn't think evil of us
[1:48:30] his thoughts can be summed up
[1:48:32] you're very they're very you are very
[1:48:35] precious his thoughts of you are
[1:48:36] precious he's gentle
[1:48:39] he's a real gentleman you're the apple
[1:48:42] of his high
[1:48:43] you are the scars in his hands
[1:48:46] you are the love in his heart you are a
[1:48:48] part of him his thoughts towards you are
[1:48:51] precious in fact
[1:48:53] Jeremiah 29 11 says for I know the
[1:48:56] thoughts I think towards you saith the
[1:48:57] Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil
[1:49:01] to give you an expected end
[1:49:05] this is the sum of his thoughts to give
[1:49:09] you an expected end
[1:49:12] that's why we know that everything is
[1:49:15] going to work to help you in the end
[1:49:18] everything is going to work to help you
[1:49:21] in the end it don't help now you may
[1:49:24] hate it now you may wish it didn't
[1:49:26] happen now but what he has orchestrated
[1:49:28] is going to help you in the end amen for
[1:49:31] I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:49:33] present time are not worthy to be
[1:49:36] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:49:38] revealed in us let's Stand Together God
