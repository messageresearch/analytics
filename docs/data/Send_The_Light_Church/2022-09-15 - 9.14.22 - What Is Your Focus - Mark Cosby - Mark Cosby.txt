in the next moment just say a word or two brother demars has done a tremendous work in turkey you know turkey is the country where mount air fat is and they have found the cross in fact they have data dedicated a big part for noah's ark i wanted to go with brother demar just just to go up and see it for myself but uh it really happened it wasn't just a story it really happened i know brother newman's pastor brother huffman i met him probably 30 years ago when my wife and i was very young uh coming through south dakota and he's a precious brother so let's really pray for him uh just like i spoke a good word for brother uh brother george smith the other day i can say the same thing for brother demars he's ministered down in ann arbor and i wanted to go with him but the holy spirit just seemed like but i do want to tell you thank you for the prayers for my sister the lord has now i believe give me permission that he's going to give me strength [Music] about 40 years ago my dad's passed away and my sister flew from hawaii to be with my stepmother because she was a little afraid and she was alone and a man ran out of gas nearby and and tried to break in the store he couldn't get in and he come down knowing that my dad had passed away went into the back door pried it open with the tar tool and and killed my stepmom and my sister started screaming you should have just been quiet he wouldn't have known then he came in and beat her and she she's still alive thank god she's about five years older than me and when my my brother marshall two and a half years older would take advantage of me she'd always take up for me so i kind of love her for that her name is evelyn and she's married to a catholic man uh he's not mean to her he cooks for and all of that but here within the last three years i believe it has been she broke her hip and uh so remember her and there's a little fuss going on uh as brother martin preached last sunday there are sometime little differences in churches hey hey it's going to be that way but look it's to test us what are we going to do you know are we going to get this curse and give it up and throw in the towel and not even try no no i'm getting out of here sister anne really blessed me with the song i think this last sunday that i've never heard before sister hands got a good voice and i appreciate her god bless you all thank you brother john god bless you amen the old rugged cross there's god was faithful to go to calvary for us and we have to be faithful to stay true to the cross so how many no matter how many times we slip fall wherever at we got to get back up and just stay true to the cross but we had another psalm but we're going to save it if it's okay uh from sister ian but we're gonna save that till saturday the lord willing and we just appreciate her always willing to give up her spots um we're trying to fit it in but it's time for the preacher and we got to bring the preacher on amen let's stand together somebody's looking forward to the word amen amen well it's been a while since we've heard brother mark minister so let's get right behind him let's support him with amens let's let's get into the to the very message that god has for us amen we're not going to hear from a man we're going to hear from god amen listening only believe as our brother mark comes we appreciate his faithfulness [Music]

word of prayer uh dear heavenly father we want to this invite your presence here just to reveal your word lord any man can turn back these pages but only you can bring the words to life lord i pray lord you move me so plum out the way lord that you they would just hear you and only you lord i just want to be uh just a mouthpiece for you to use lord and i pray you just bless each person that's here tonight lord bless each person in the live stream i pray to soften our hearts lord let us just hearken unto what you would say lord and let us be obedient to all your word lord not just some but all lord and lord we pray that you just have the preeminence lord from the start of this service to the end lord we ask all these things in jesus christ then we pray amen may we turn to philippians chapter three and read verses 10 through 16. say amen when you get there so start with verse 10 that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead not as though i had already attained either already perfect but i follow after if they may apprehend that which also i am apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count that myself to have apprehended but there's one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before verse 14 i press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if anything you be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you nevertheless we're to we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing god bless you guys may be seated so the title of our little sermon today is what is your focus so a lot of things that we could uh get distracted on could be when you're trying to focus on something and you're narrowing like if i'm looking at this clock i'm trying to focus on what time it is so if i'm trying to look at small print i'm trying to really focus on it so a lot of times our focus can get away from god but we can still be serving god reading the word praying but we lost our focus we lost our vision that god has given us so uh we'll go to philippians 2. uh actually before we go there there's something uh you notice what paul said apprehended so when you apprehend something you're pretty much like grasping something you're taking a hold of something see your walk with christ you got to take it by force because the devil is going to give you every excuse to just give him the bare minimum god just doesn't want your bare minimum but he wants all of you if you get if you're if you're marrying somebody you want that person to have all of you not just some of you so christ is coming to marry the bride and he wants all the bride because the bride's gonna make herself ready the bride's gonna be without spot or wrinkle and that just doesn't happen when he comes but that process is happening right now the shaping the molding process is happening right now this very moment so each decision that you make is either going to take you away from that or draw you towards that so your decisions are important each decision that you make so let's go to philippians 2 like i said before me verses one through eight probably very familiar scriptures we kind of want to really take our time and break it down if there be therefore any constellation in christ so look that word of constellation so it's comfort aviation of misery or distress of mind refreshment of mind or spirits a comparative degree of happiness in distress or misfortune springing up from any circumstances that abates the evil or supports and strengthens the mind as hope joy and courage and like so if any comfort of love if any fellowship of spirit if any bowels of mercies verse two fulfill ye my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves so look the word up lowliness is freedom from pride humility humbleness of mind so i look the word up strife as well excursion or contention for superiority contest of emulation either by intellectual or physical effort strife may be carried between students or between mechanics so we're not trying to fight each other we're not trying to get each other's strife we're here to walk together see this walk you're not i'm not walking against you i'm not running against you i'm not fighting against you but i'm fighting alongside you this is a battle we need one another and we got to lift one another up and build one another and that takes effort yes that takes crucifying the flesh because your natural human nature doesn't want to necessarily work together that's right teamwork is something has to be built you look at the sports team basketball football whatever hockey you take it all the same thing you need to build chemistry and that team they can have all the best superstars in the world but if they don't have chemistry they're going to do horrible just on paper doesn't do good they have to build it it takes time takes discipline it takes effort so with the body of christ if we want to be a well-working oil machine we got to work together we got to pray together we got to cry together we got to rejoice together that's what god just didn't die for us to be all over hearing you over there and over there but he died that we could be a functioning body if i don't have my left arm i'm lacking something if i'm missing fingers i'm going to be handicapped right right so we need all we need one another let's go to verse verse 3 again let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem utter other better than themselves so it's not all about me it's about me lifting somebody else up that's the reward see christ didn't come on this earth to just say i'm the son of god listen to me but he became a servant as we read further down in here see he didn't have to say everywhere he went that he was the son of god his life proved what he was and our life needs to prove what we are so if we claim to be christians you don't have to say it to every person you walk by but your life the way you act the way you think the way you talk the way you live is going to prove what you really are amen praise god let's keep going so looking at every man on his own things but every man also in the things of others so there's five love verse five let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus so every day i do not wake up with the mind of christ can i get an amen amen i have to strive to have the mind of christ it's a gift but you have to fight for that gift it's something that he doesn't say here you can have it today because your name is mark cosby no it's something i have to strive for because my carnal flesh does not want to serve god and if it does it wants to give god the bare minimum mediocre mediocracy and so this mind is something that we need every day we can't take it or leave it but if something says let this mind be in you which is also in christ jesus so if you want to do these things the bible says doing everything without strife and vain glory and loneliness of mine you need the mind of christ otherwise it can't be done so go to verse six who being in the form of god thought it not robberly to be equal with god verse seven but made himself of no reputation house human beings we like to we may not save we like to look good sometimes fancy cars fancy houses and we try to we want to get the approval for others right it says human nature but christ came he knew where he came from he knew he was on the throne of he knew he knew he was deity he knew all these things he knew he was holy but he didn't boast about it it says right here but he made himself of no reputation what took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men so if he's our perfect example then we need to serve others we need to be servants that's what he's calling us to that's the whole plan of god we need to serve one another that's how you show somebody christ by living for them verse eight and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself if you don't know what if you want to know what true humility is look at the life of jesus christ in the word of god it's going to show you what humility really is i don't want just some definition i think what it is what the dictionary gives me but i want to look at the life of christ because that's what humility was he was he's the very definition of humility in my eyes and so he humbled himself and became obedient unto the death even the death of the cross our focus needs to be on what god is trying to do in our life right now it's wonderful to thank the lord for all the things he has done for your life in the past praise god but let's not just live in the past he wants to he wants to give you testimonies today right now of what he's doing in your life right now because says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so what is christ trying to do your life right now today that's that's what you have to wait to seek that personally that's something the pastor can't do for you i can't do for you sister ann can't do for you but you have to seek it personally for your life he wants to give you a vision but a vision has to get to seek after a vision a vision just doesn't fall into your lap praise god so working him seeing things not just so we can have testimonies that i woke up this morning let's praise god but how is your nature changing what is god trying to fix in your life because there's things we have bad habits things we need to add in our life but if we're not seeking after those things it is good the things that you're doing good right now but god is looking for the things that we're not doing right now that's what's going to change us and mold us because it's good i can say i'm good at doing this but if i'm failing at all these other areas that one good thing isn't going to outweigh all the bad things right so let's keep going so i like the word up focus it's a central point of concentration so if i'm focusing on something if i'm looking at this door i'm looking just at the door and nothing else i'm focusing so that's how our walk with god is it's a straight and narrow we can't be looking to the left and to the right at all these this pleasurable things we got to keep focused focused when the doctor the eye doctor asks you to focus on these letters you're really trying to focus on those letters and if you can't see them then it's going to be corrected with glasses so sometimes god has to correct our focus by chastising us us making a mistake some sometimes a lot of times god will let you make a mistake because he's trying to talk to you but you're not listening so he'll let you make that mistake and he's a gracious father and he's going to help you learn from that mistake but the thing is he can't force you to learn from that mistake you have to make the what the decision see this whole life is about decision this whole life is about change either you're going to change for the good or change for the bad it's no middle water so think about each decision you make you're going to change either for the good or the bad and even a good decision can have uh certain consequences others might leave you your family might disown you whatever it is but if you're if you're living for the gospel of jesus christ and suffering for him that he's gonna bless you he's gonna bless you with more parents amen he is i have many moms and many dads you know brother john sister one of my dads and moms so he'll bless you so a focal point i like the word a focal point the point at which elements are aspects coverage the center of activity or intention so christ wants to be the center of your life he wants to be the main principal point of focusing your life and if he becomes that then all things are going to line in place will you have hardships and trials yes those that live godly will suffer persecution but those trials are meant to build you to give you more of the character of god to make you more in his image and there's a lot of things we we may not understand but just take him at his word he doesn't he said if thou cannot believe not if thou cannot understand a lot of times human beings we want to understand everything we want everything laid out like gps like i gotta make this left turn here make this right turn here sometimes god is only gonna light a couple steps ahead and you gotta trust him abraham he didn't know where he was going but he took god at his word and look where he led him he's the father of our faith now because what he took god at his word so he he could have had all the excuses in the world he never heard god speak to him before the first time ever but we have examples all around us of god working in others lives abraham didn't have that so we need to have the faith of abraham just because you don't understand something doesn't mean god isn't leading you so paul i look paul he was always focused on his high calling he even told us to press towards the mark of the high calling of god in christ jesus he was focused on he was focused on getting to know the lord in a personal and intimate way even after 30 plus years of serving them he said oh that i may know him we we need that kind of desperation paul didn't say well lord i've known you for 30 years i've known enough but he was as is a new babe in christ he wanted to know him just as much as he wanted to know him when he first got to know him if that made any sense so the thing is if you want to know him he said i love i'll read one more time philippians 3 10 that may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformed to his death so it's going to take suffering to know him amen christ had to suffer to fulfill god's will so if he had to suffer to do that we have to suffer to know him as well so it's no excuses we can say so he he recognized see paul had recognized who he was in lord jesus christ he recognized he must be submitted to the lord daily and he was focused on working for the lord he was a servant he didn't care what he had to do to serve god he got stoned shipwrecked he didn't care jailed he didn't care what he had to do when i think of focus in order to focus on the lord you must constantly have a spiritual vision for your life because how many times people have a a vision to grow their business to to have an uh to work out to build muscle see those visions they can be good things but they can be distracting because they're carnal see carnal visions they're going to pass away but a vision from the lord isn't going to pass away because that vision is going to constantly keep him before you if that vision doesn't then there's something wrong with that vision because a vision a true spiritual vision shouldn't distract you from the lord in fact it should keep you on that straight and narrow and that vision will go to proverbs 29 18. so proverbs 29 18 probably very familiar scripture where there is no vision that people perish so if we don't have a vision then we're walking around aimlessly and you could be reading the word and praying every day but god is wanting to give us a vision he wants to give us an expected end he promised that but if you can't catch and be connected with him how can he give you that vision anything a vision you have to seek after a vision it's not something a pastor can necessarily give you that's something that i could give you don't just do things because i say it but do it because you love the lord so the thing is we don't want to walk around aimless like i said before and i've been there it's not fun because you could be doing all these things all these other people churches catholics you know bath that is baptist methodists they they are technically serving the lord but they get caught up in dogmas they get caught up in creeds and yeah they're even in pro matthew 7 it says many will come to me today they say lord lord lord they're not cast out devils and he'll sick in your name and these people weren't atheists they weren't devil worshipers but they were going to church every wednesday and sunday they were giving offerings and ties but the thing is what jesus said is i did not know you workers of iniquity so god had called them to a personal walk a fully surrendered life where they thought they could just do what they wanted to do they could take the word they wanted to take so the thing is we can't take what we want in the word we need all the word if i'm at a buffet i can pick and choose but we need to rake all the word in we need to gather it because god is a god of all his word not just partialities because if not then he would he would have to forgive eve he would he would have to say eve you were right but no he couldn't but he god is his word lying upon line priest upon priesthood he is forever settled in heaven so he can't go back on it it's forever god is his word just like as i give my word to somebody and i don't do something i say i'm going to do then there's going to be consequences for that but god he can't he's his word so i got a quote to read and i think it's just about where the churches are getting we're the children of god but we're losing our inheritance by our conduct the things that we do and the things that we permit to be done and the way that we live and act and so forth we're living millions of miles below our privilege and i believe we're doing that because we lose sight of the vision we lose sight of our focus of who we are we forget who we are in this word what god is calling us to be am i right yes praise god it says we're living millions of miles below our privilege we should be living a victorious life every day there's no excuse why we can't if jesus has overcome hell death and the grave then what excuse did we have he even said all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth so there's no demon no sickness no devil that can stop you if you're fully submitted to jesus christ now it can stop you if you're not but if you're fully submitted there's no devil in hell that could stop you there's no addiction there's no habit that can stop you if you're fully surrendered to him on a daily basis and he's called us to be overcomers and i said this statement many times i'll say it again it's not necessarily you overcoming yourself but it's you letting the overcomer overcome inside of you because the children of israel when they saw those giants they said we're grasshoppers but joshua and caleb saw the giants and knew that their god could conquer those giants they didn't know how but they saw god move they saw the the the testimonies they had of getting fed bread of the egyptians being drowned the plagues they saw those things they said there's different spirit in them i believe there's different spirit than us let's take let's be joshua and caleb's i believe there's still joshua and caleb's today that take god at his word no matter the circumstance that's where i'm at uh and then someone see the work of god being done and dr so-and-so and dr jones say is this and the other doctor says it's this and we believe it instead of looking into the word the word verifies it that what's sheep food it comes out of the word so that's all we need is the word i don't care what dr so-and-so said if he's doubting the word god says this i don't know what you say but god says this my god doesn't say that what you're saying but my god says this you gotta take god at his word if you don't have faith you can't have a walk with god faith is one of the triangle but faith is the foundation of your walk if you have no faith then you can have no walk it's impossible amen even says without it even says in the word it's impossible to please god without faith that's a requirement see we got to get ourselves focused to whether we live or die sink or drown it's calvary christ that's the thing god wants us to come back to we got to remember where you came from you got to remember what he did for you it's not something he wants you to forget if you forget calvary then you you lose your strength because that's where your strength came from if he didn't die upon calvary and resurrect we couldn't have we couldn't be here today a lot of times see we you have to conform to the word the word the word doesn't conform to your life but you have to conform to the word that's how god works he wants he's the one who's going to shape and mold you you're not shaping him over to him he's perfect so we must submit to the word daily do not think that the word is going to submit to your selfish needs and desires it's not god doesn't work that way he'll knock at the door of your heart as in that picture right there but you have to let him in that's a requirement see that don't think the word is going to submit to you it's not going to conform to your busy schedule sometimes we get so busy that we lose sight of who we are we lose sight of why we're on this earth we're not on this earth this to work pay bills and die we're not a lot of people have that philosophy that i'm working my pay bills and my kids are going to do that and no no we can live a joyous life you can have nice things i'm not saying you can't have nice things you got to live like a poor man i'm not saying that at all what i'm saying is don't let those things get in the way of your walk don't let them become an idol in your life because anything you put before god is an idol your car can mean idol your your family your wife your girlfriend they can be an idol in your life but the thing is you have to put things in a proper place let's go to romans 8 29. so what a statement i just said you have to conform to the word and look look what uh he's calling us in romans 8 29 i think we read that scripture actually oh wrong way praise god i love the word so 8 29 so it says for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to what to be conformed to the image of his son so right there the word is telling me that i'm supposed to be conformed to him not the work not the the word conformed to my my life but i got to be conformed to his image to the image of his son that he might be the first among many brethren i i just love that because i'm supposed to be like him not he like me he became like me in the likeness of sinful flesh that he could come like him that's the whole motive why he did that so i'm gonna be just like him but the just like him part doesn't start at that moment but it starts right now when you give your heart to god that's when it's starting that process is just starting and until until you're called on this earth before he comes that's when it's over but until then we got so much work to do i know there's so many flaws and so many things in my life that i need to work on praise god that he's gracious and merciful to help me with those so that needs to be our focal point that image being conformed to this image in order for that to happen you have to worry about the thing is the most important thing is you can take care of this fleshly body all you want to you can eat healthy i'm not advocating not to eat healthy please don't give me that one thing is don't focus so much on the outward shell the inward shell was so much more important because if we're not focused on the inward man then the outward man is gonna perish as well see because our soul when god died for you he didn't die for these pest houses but he died for what's inside of there that soul and he in fact he's promised to give you a new body a glory like in his image but but the thing is still take care of your body because the thing is god is loaning this to you and you have to take care of your body the things you eat the things you put into your body take care of your body advocate that praise god this needs to be our focal point because if that's not our true focal point then we're gonna we're not gonna fall on his example and guess what guess what he was guess what jesus was a servant the very god of heaven was a servant he served others he got he was willing to get dirty he washed other's feet he was willing to be about the father's business amen no matter what no matter how how he felt no matter how sick he felt no matter how many people uh he healed he didn't care he was still always about the father's business and was willing to help he's also willing to help build others even hurting them necessarily they could hurt their car like when peter he rebuked peter but he did it because he wanted to show peter to build peter see god doesn't do things just to do things he does it with a perfect purpose and his intent is to build you up to to call you higher in first john 1 14. and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory in the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so we can't separate god in his word they're one and the same so you can't have god without his word you can't have the word without god and a question i'm gonna pose to you guys please don't answer this but answer within yourselves who and what is your focus on there's only two things you can focus on either god's will or your will self-will and we all know self-will is satan's will i'm not gonna i'm not gonna sugarcoat i'm gonna just put it right blank are we trying to build a kingdom down here a earthly fleshly kingdom or we laying up treasure in heaven because like i said it is good to focus on retirement but that the only thing i'm not here to retire to live here the rest of my life i'm here to go in the glory i don't know about you guys but that's where i'm going so don't get so caught up in trying to build a life down here that you forget where you're here because when you do that you forget who you are in the word the word is calling like i said the word is calling to be in his image to be overcomers don't let these things in your life hinder you giants and financial issues he promised to take care of your knees just seek his kingdom let's go to matthew 6 with me so matthew 6 19-24 very familiar scriptures so it says lay that up for yourselves treasures upon earth he's telling us right now where moth and rusted corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven or neither moth nor rust of corrupt where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also for where your treasure is there will your heart be also so whatever your bulk of majority of your time is wherever you're putting your energy and effort into that's where your heart's going to be if it's not in the things of god and there's going to be the things of the world and that's how you get distracted that's how satan gets you to get you so busy that you forget about christ and you may not necessarily forget about them intellectually but here you forget about them because if you're not growing here you become spiritually malnourished if i don't eat in the physical realm then i become malnourished if i'm not feeding on the spiritual realm i become malnourished and i don't want to be spiritually malnourished because i become spiritually malnourished then i can't be a soldier i can't be a proper soldier in god's army and then the satan's gonna say he's gonna have a field day with you if you're not prayed up if you're not in the word if you're not seeking god and submitted he's gonna have a field day with you and you can do nothing about it because you are powerless against satan yourself but when you get connected see if i unplug that tv it can't turn on but when i plug it up it has power so when i'm plugged in the word of god and in prayer then i have power it's not my power but it's his power he's given me and i'm responsible in how i use that power because he's given us authority but we don't want to misuse that authority see a policeman he's given authority but he has a decision either to use the authority properly or misuse the authority properly and i don't want to be guilty of misusing what god has given me because i'm going to be judged on how i use the gifts he's given me uh and many other things just gifts isn't just a gift of singing and gifts are so many things you can you have a gift of helps you can have a gift of being a people person just be able to talk to anybody anytime anywhere see there's so many gifts we don't look at and god the thing is you once you recognize the gift that you have you give it back to god and let him use it through you okay that's that's what the whole point of a gift is there's talents if jesus told us about and this one man he hid his talent and didn't even use it and he was he was held responsible for that so i don't want to be held responsible for not using my gift the way he wanted me to use it praise god i forgot where i was um verse 23 verse 22 the light of the body is the eye if therefore thy eye be single that whole body should be full of light but if the eye be evil that whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in me be darkness how great is that darkness so verse 24 no man can serve two masters so you cannot try to serve god and have one foot out in the world you cannot do that it will make you sick it will not profit you and you be considered a hypocrite free that you will hate the you eat for either you hate the one and love the other or else you will hold to the one who despise the other even jesus told us you cannot serve god and mammon you can so make your choice today serve god with all your heart not partialities not 99 but give them 100 of your life every single day praise god there are many distractions in this layout to see in age this is the age of distractions you have technology you have internet you have smartphones you have the iphone 14 15 coming out next year you have all these things samsung galaxies all these things that can be blessings but also be cursings because the devil can use him to take your time away get all these tv shows on tv i'm not saying you can't watch shows or anything but don't let them distract you from what you're here for see jesus called us to be overcomers and your biggest distraction is your flesh it's the only thing that will keep you from a closer walk with god and keep you from finding your purpose here on earth so your biggest enemy is yourself my biggest enemy is mark cosby he's the only person that's going to stop him from walking with god not not not communism not the government not politics they're not going to stop you from walking with god but you yourself are going to stop you walking from god that's why jesus told us to crucify your flesh daily and then you pick up your cross you have to crucify daily otherwise you'll get distracted now notice you have to make the choice you have to make the choice to fight and to keep fighting the choice to overcome that distraction this is not just something that you serve the lord for 20 years and you have to crucify anymore no in fact your flesh is going to want to distract you more and more and more because because as you grow in the lord much is given much is required so a lot of times like people at work or whatever you know you do this job for 20 years and kind of like you know they lack they don't do as much as they used to do when you're walking with god you can't do that in fact when you're working for 20 years you should still be giving your best how you do anything is how you do everything i love that quote do everything as you do unto the lord that's how i live my life everything i'm doing whether it's cleaning the toilet at my house i'm gonna do with the best of my ability as i'm doing it to the lord and i believe if we have that type of attitude we wouldn't cut corners on things it wouldn't be lazy and thoughtful in things be disciplined in your prayer life reading the word of god your work whatever you're doing at home be disciplined the more areas you can be disciplined in the less chance of likelihood you'll be lazy in other areas discipline is key the word disciple has discipline in it so the disciples were what discipline they had to crucify daily they had desires like you did dreams like we do goals like we do they had all these things but they had to cut certain things out that weren't pleasing unto the lord they were human beings just like you and i the bible may not have said you know say everything that they they thought in their heads but we could we could definitely come to the conclusion that they had thoughts of of the devil bringing to their mind of uh you don't have to do this today you don't have to go speak to this person you don't have to pray today because you're human beings like us god didn't call superhumans he called he called us this he called them the words i'm slowed down so we're sinners saved by grace so he knew that we're sinners saved by grace that's why he had to die for us so we could become like him if we don't die to ourselves we can never truly become into his image never now moses now notice moses he went down after he got his glasses focused and seen that it was god's program what he wants to do he went down he fought hard he had many great battles one of his great trying battles i like to bring it we had just achieved it by showing signs and wonders by different things that god has showed him to speak the word it will become a material and happen same thing today we have today we speak the word over the sick and watch it heal and do these other things that god's word spoke through human lips you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt it but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said jesus said so now we have to believe that and hold to it and take it and believe it and all these things this word is full of many wonderful promises you can say to this mountain be moved i think a lot of times we don't have enough faith to move that mountain we don't have enough faith to to hit to heal to heal is sick it says laying hands in the sickness shall recover like a lot of times we can doubt and just a little bit of doubt is not going to bring it to pass so god is the same god as he was in paul's day as he was in moses's day as he was in peter's day and brother branham's day see it's not about who the person is but it's about you taking a hold of god's word because the needs that you have god wants to fulfill those needs but you have to believe that he can fulfill those needs in your life see if you can't take god at his word then he can never be permanent in your life because god works on the basis of you believing him otherwise like this door right here he's not gonna bust he's not gonna bust the door in like like a swat team member he's gonna knock at the door and you gotta open it he's not gonna blow it up with dynamite he's not gonna get a rocket launcher and blow it up but no he's a gentleman he's going to let you let him in just like if i invite you to my house if i never let you in unlock the door then you could never have entry same thing and you just be knocking all night and i won't do anything so the same thing you walk with god you gotta let him in if you want victory let him in if you want to overcome your habits let him in amen if you want to you want to praise pray and heal somebody let him in if you want to move that mountain let him in oh you had a faith as a grain and a mustard seed that's all he said and you could have what you asked but the thing is don't just ask this anything i want three cadillacs and a bentley that's not something that's going to benefit you anything it's not even going to help you in fact won't you pray lord give me a greater burden to help somebody lord how can i speak to this individual to help him point him closer to you amen or lord help me help to change my nature lord it's things i'm struggling with give me the strength to overcome those things are going to build you it's good yes the lord wants to give you the house he wants to give you the car but he said but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness remember say it one more time but seek ye first the kingdom of righteousness and all these things will be added unto you he knows you need to pay the rent he knows you need a car he knows you need gas in your car he knows all these things you have need of but just seek him with all your heart seek the kingdom and he's going to bless you with the things that you need i love saying this statement he's not going to fulfill your greeds but your needs a lot of times we we greed for things and we don't really need it i'm not saying like i said you can have nice things but don't lust after those nice things praise god let's keep going let's go to romans chapter eight how we doing on time romans chapter eight verse one through 1-9 praise god so it says there there is therefore no now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit notice that this a decision a choice so it was either walking after the flesh but after the spirit just because you've given your heart to god doesn't give you the green past that you're always going to be in the spirit you still have to strive to be in the spirit you still got to make a decision to serve god every day because his mercies are new each day today is a new day i believe brother john said this statement the hardest thing is to get up the next day and do all over again that's the hardest thing because you can have a victorious day yesterday but tuesday has many trials and hardships but the thing is you got to be so anchored in that that doesn't distract you it doesn't even move you for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh for our sin condemned sin in the flesh so he came and condemned these things in the flesh he he won your sickness your healing your your habits you could be delivered from so you got deliverance you got healing and all these things is given to you at your hand at your disposal but how how serious you are obtaining these things because god is looking at your your desperation he's looking at how serious you are if you want to overcome something in your life show god how desperate how much you mean business don't just live with the thing that you've been addicted for for many years because god didn't intend for us to live with these giants and as i preached a long time ago he didn't intend for us to live in the with these giants in our land a lot of times we like to coexist with our giants like i said before but god didn't call us to coexist he called us to to kill these giants david wasn't willing to coexist with goliath in fact he cut his head off and he even he even said to the to israel the armies you're going to let this uncircumcised philistine defile the armies of the living god so are you going to let this giant defile your walk with god are you no i don't think so so you take that giant and you take god's word and cut away cut to you you see pieces where are we at now we'll go to romans 4 or romans sorry 8 4 that righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so number time that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so you have to be walking in the spirit verse 5 for they that are after the flesh do mine the things of the flesh but they they're after the spirit the things of the spirit notice it's no middle ground it's either one or the other either you're walking in the spirit or you're not you're walking in the flesh or you're not it's it's either it's no it's black and white a lot of times the human beings we like to say well i'm still serving god but you're cold so are you really serving god really he'd rather have you hot or cold not lukewarm for that for for to be currently minded is death so for me not to have the mind of christ is death i was going to say like it is but to be spiritually minded as life and priest life and peace so to have the mind of christ is life and peace because life and peace that that mind of christ is like i said can keep you focused on what you're what your goal is your end goal he wants to give you an expected end he promised to do that but the thing is you have to seek him with all your heart that's what jeremiah tells us so then they there in the flesh cannot please god actually let me jump at the verse seven i skipped it because the carnal mind is enmity against god so your carnal nature your carnal mind is totally against god it can't even be subject to the law of god we go back into the old testament when they would sacrifice sin they would be forgiven but they still have that same desire to sin but when the perfect sacrifice the lamb of god was sacrificed when you truly repent and turn from your ways that desire leaves you when you're truly delivered that desire leaves you so you don't have to be a victim and be in bondage anymore because christ died for your freedom and rose again that you could be free praise guys keep going verse uh verse six so then they that are in the verse eight so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god let's jump down to verse 12 with me therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live once again it goes back to crucifying you've got to crucify so we need a balance in our life we need a perfect balance see it's a good see a good thing can be too much so if i could work and pay my bills but if my work is or is this engulfing my whole life and god becomes put in second place then that's a false balance and we're going to read what a false balance is in a second let's go to proverbs 16. well proverbs 16. we're going to stay in a book of proverbs for a little bit not too long but a little bit so verse 16 and we'll go with verse verse 11. so it says a just weight and balances are the lords all the weights of the bags are his work a just weight and balance are the lowers so if we want a perfect balance it has to be in the lord we can't ourselves cannot have a perfect balance because as human beings we're not we're we're unbalanced as it is and it takes god to give us that perfect balance that's why i said that vision has to be ever before you and then the thing is you have to have a vision of your own you can't just piggyback off of somebody else's vision yes you can help that vision but you still need a vision for your personal life as well because i can't walk for you you can't walk for me all right let's go to proverbs 11 a couple over a couple verses or chapters over so a false balance is an abomination to the lord so if we have a false balance the scriptures tell me it's an abomination to the lord if we if we're putting work over god then that's an abomination even for putting the family over god that's an abomination the family has its place it needs to be second place and god first place so i need to be last god my family then then i'm gonna be then me because god promised to take care of me he promised to supply not only my physical needs but most important my spiritual needs because god can bless you with all these material things he says he blesses the just and the unjust i don't want just physical blessings but i want spiritual blessings going to help me grow into his image that's the only thing that's going to matter at the end of the day what's done for christ is going to matter not how many uh hot meal plates i gave to the homeless people not how many cars i owned in my life now how many uh designer shoes i have or how many nice sunglasses i have that's not gonna matter all these things are gonna pass away but what's done for him the decisions you make for him that's what's going to matter that's what's going to build you let's go to proverbs 20 23. diver's weights are an abomination to the lord and a false balance is not good so the scripture is constantly telling me in proverbs a false balance is not good i like the word of divers it's different various weight of importance power or influence so we don't want to be influenced by the wrong things like i said before a good thing can become a bad thing if you do too much of it like you you can eat too much of a one food even a carrot can turn you orange but is this is it still good at the end of the day yes it's good but you ate too much of it so i'm engulfing on too much of my my of the world and its pleasures you need it needs to be a balance work yes god expects you to work but doesn't expect you to engulf your whole life where you have nothing no time to do anything because you have a family you don't want to just work your whole life away and not build something with your family and your wife see god expects you to make time for him don't just pencil him in your schedule but you make time for him sometimes you're going to have to sacrifice you don't have to sacrifice things it could be things doing around the house or you want to go out and watch a tv show whatever it is a lot of times this christian life is suffering you're going to have to put things aside to follow that vision let's go to john chapter 3 verse 1 let's go to john 3 3 john 1 2. time just flies huh so john three verse one second oh third john so it says we'll start verse verse two beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prosper so the lord wants you to prosper in good health he does but that shouldn't be your main focal point your main focal point should be your soul prospering that's what god's desire is if your soul isn't prospering then you're missing why he called you because he's constantly trying to restore you back into his image adam and eve they were made perfect but before the fall everything was perfect and god is trying to get us back to that that image and it takes it's gonna take time it's gonna take a lot of trials a lot of hardships a lot of heartaches but don't don't worry about those things that are happening they're there to build your character they're more precious than gold the bible says right praise god so when we're really focusing on something we're really directing our effort so we need to be like i said before focus your intention on god god is trying to speak to us every day it's like how many are familiar with the radios you gotta get a tune well that's how your walk is you gotta tune it to the right frequency when you're turning that radio if you're not exactly the right frequency it's kind of fuzzy but when you hit that right frequency it's clear that's how you walk with god is you gotta tune it because the devil wants to act like he is god he wants to even use the word he even try to use the word against the very word imagine that so the thing is god has when god speaks something we're talking about men's meeting don't don't question it just follow after it god isn't going to confuse you he's not the author if god has told you to do something and it lines up with the word perfectly he's not gonna then right after just say oh whoa don't do that anymore do this no god is not the author of confusion in fact he wants to give you peace he promised to give you peace that passes all understanding so if i said if i want a closer walk with god i have to put all everything in my focus my heart my soul my mind my body everything all my attention to him he wants my heart he wants my time he wants every part of me god is looking for believers that will give him every part of their life open every door of your heart to him don't just open some doors but open every door to him he's knocking because there's doors that we haven't opened to him yet but we have to be the one that opens the door not the pastor not not brother roger not brother johnson but we have to do it personally it's a personal walk it's an intimate walk i can't have brother roger walking on my road with me it's a straight and narrow it's only room for you and him that's the only two people it doesn't matter what age you are you can have a personal walk with god in fact i would even recommend you start young i wish i would have started younger amen so let's go to revelations 3 14. so the greatest distraction of this age is self right the greatest action is yourself the satan wants you to put so much focus on yourself that you forget about others and walking with god and the thing is it's not just about being a good person because there's gonna be good people that go to hell i'm sorry there's gonna be people that don't drink don't smoke they're going to hell see god isn't looking for this people with good morals but he's looking for people that serve him and want to have good morals see good morals i'm not i'm not disputing them you should have good morals you should be a good person you should help others but even paul said i could give i can get my body to be burned i can feed the poor but if i have not charity it profits me nothing so if you don't have the love of god inside your even brother branham said lay everything aside until you get perfect love so perfect love is going to be needs to be the focus and the theme of your life because that's what god is the scripture of god is love for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son he gave it for us take it personal he died for you personally brother johnson he died for you personally brother bruce he died for me personally and you see you got to put yourself you got to read as if he's speaking directly towards you because he is speaking to you he's speaking right this is a love letter written back to you that's how personal has to be don't think god is just somewhere out there but he's in his word he's inside of you the the very god that you serve living inside of you you can conquer any problem in your life because it's god conquering the problem and you're just moving out the way so he can solve that problem for you so let's go to 14. so this is the age we're living in and unto the angel of the church of laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness in the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that thou were cold or hot so then because they are lukewarm and either cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because i'll say as i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and know it's not that they are wretched miserable poor and blind and naked as i said before if i was walking across the street naked you would say something to me but these people are not naked but they're spiritually naked and they don't even know it they think that they have all they need well i know enough of god he's my savior but he doesn't want to just be saved he wants to be the lord of all your life that's his desire savior and lord see these people they accepted they accepted the sacrifice oh he died for me i believe it all hallelujah but they never made him the lord of their life because not that the wretched miserable poor and blind and naked i count he even i counsel you to buy of me gold and try and fire he's giving him an open invitation take my invitation i want to come into you my son my daughter but if he can never get past that door then we're going to miss it and go to hell and that's how serious it is this is a serious game it's a serious time it's no game and god is waiting for us to get serious to get down to business to get focused on him that's what he's waiting for he's been waiting since the the fall of adam and eve in the garden for us to get to this point we're living in the greatest time ever right now we're so close to the coming of the lord let's work while there's light let's build others while there's light yeah let's let's preach the gospel to others that haven't heard it amen it's not right for somebody to hear it five times somebody here once right there's so many there's still souls out there otherwise we'll be going home right now so what is god trying to do in your life right now and no matter how old you are how young you are god can use you yeah we got so many scriptural examples in here i counsel you to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mays be rich and white remnant that thou mayest be clothed and the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and knowing that i what i said thou may see notice in each age look the author of the bible god has given an open invitation and the same word that saved the individual who hearkened to it the same word that condemned the unbeliever so we have a choice you you take that gold that he's given you and you counsel to buy of me gold tried in the fire he wants you to be rich not necessarily with material goods but spiritually rich because i can have all this money but not know god just because i have all these things and nice things doesn't mean i have a walk with god it doesn't how many people you see ceos tikes all these people nba players billionaires all these things billions of dollars isn't going to help me at the end of the day i can't take it with me verse 19 as many as i love i rebuke and chasten right brother ferguson be zealous therefore and repent so he's gonna chasten us as we learn in the ministry not just to do it to do it for a reason he's trying to build something in you he's called us to a certain purpose and if he doesn't do these things we can't we can't be ready for it because god is calling each one of us to a purpose i don't know necessarily what it is in your life you have to figure it out personally for yourself you have to have a personal walk and let him reveal that to you because i can't reveal it to you i can't do anything i i can't i'm sorry one thing i can do is give you failures that's all i got so i got behold i stand at the door and knock if any man notice he says any man invitation any man you don't have to be black white hispanic orange white purple but if any man hear my voice he's not a respecter of persons and open the door i will come into him and what's up with him and he with me to him that overcometh like grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne i want to be there i don't know about you guys but i want to be there he that happened here is speaking to us let them hear what the spirit saying to the churches what are you crucifying your desires and wants that go against the will of god our lazy and thoughtful nature that once they give god barely to live no effort why are we crucifying the flesh because if you don't then you will put your will before god's will and to top it all off you'll be caught up in laodicea and not even know it and like i said before you're overcoming yourself we have to overcome our desires and our dreams and our plans not every dream and every plan you have is gonna be in god's will i'm sorry to say it's not that's why it says if the lord will not to say it just to say because it sounds good but i actually asked the lord is this your will for me to get this car for me to get this job because it's because you're making a lot of money in this job doesn't mean that's what god wants you to have because that job can have so many distractions so many spirits in there and all that money isn't going to matter if it's affecting your spiritual walk with god i'll rather i'd rather take a 20 000 pay cut and be in god's will then then make that extra twenty thousand dollars because god's gonna supply my needs he is he promised to if you if we can live a fully submitted surrender life to god on a daily basis like i said before there's no devil or demon that can stop or distract us from god's perfect will these the three things i got what does it mean to live a fully surrendered life one waking up every day and realizing there's a battle between your human nature and your spiritual man number two realizing that you cannot serve god until we crucify our old man and our human nature and then we can pick up our cross number three realizing that no one can make the choice but you not your pastor not your spouse not your brother or your sister get in such a habit of truly crucifying your flesh that it gets scared to come out i'm gonna get some i'm gonna get some scripture with that too actually so i don't think i'm just making it up so go go to second corinthians 12 with me because you can get to a place like that it's possible look what uh the lord said to paul in second or second corinthians 12 9. and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness check this out here most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure he said i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches and necessities what in persecutions in distress for what for christ's sake for when i am weak then i am strong so you can glory in your trials your sickness your reproaches all these things you can glory in get glory being persecuted for walking the gospel's sake you don't have to be a victim and complain don't murmur complain the bible tells us in fact do all things without murmurings and disputings god doesn't want to hear your murmurings and i don't want to hear your murmurings and i want to hear my own murmurings because all they're going to do is they're going to break you down instead of build you up so and we can attain these i i'm by god's grace i'm gonna start glory to my infirmities by his grace and my sicknesses all these things because they're there for a reason they're to help you they're not to not to hurt you not to hinder you but they're here to build you up praise god that's uh give me like three more minutes five more minutes can i get five more minutes all right seven more are you guys sure all right i believe the victory is being made more into his image amen oh so quiet that's what we're here for that's the victory right that's quiet there let's go to first peter uh one seven through nine first peter 179 that the trial of your faith being what much more precious than gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found at the praise and honor and glory at the paring of jesus christ whom having not seen you love and whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoiced with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your salvati your faith even the salvation of your souls go with a little second peter with me with a hurry second peter chapter one so it's something we should be doing on a constant basis simon peter is serving an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you the knowledge of god in jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given to us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby we are given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature that's what we need the divine nature of god that's the only thing that's going to help you in this world having escaped the corruption that is in the lust of the world verse 5. and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue into your virtue knowledge into knowledge temperance to temperance patience and to patients godliness and to godliness brother and kindness and brother colonist charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall never be barren or unfruitful focus talking about focus once again so it says for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see you fart off we need our glasses adjusted we need a better prescription and cannot see it far enough he had forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fail first so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though though you know them and be established in the present truth verse 15 moreover i've endeavored that you'll be able to after my decease to have these things always in my remembrance this may be the last sermon i might preach but i want to go out pointing to you guys to stay focused on christ don't take your eyes off of jesus christ couple quotes and i'll i'll close i know it's hard it cuts me and i hate to say anything to people but friends i have to stand at the judgment someday to answer before you people that's right and your blood will be upon my hands you will serve god with reverence and your pure heart holy for love for him walk every day in that mood of love all the time do good things to others and do good charitable deeds and love god notice that part love god and worship him that's the way you're supposed to live and treat your neighbor as yourself that's right we must focus our lives this is from uh look 1963 we must focus our lives i love this this quote i found i was like wow thank you lord not what somebody else says but our focus focus our lives to him and he is the word see if we get our lives lined up with the word then the word in our life becomes the same who praise god he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will it will be granted to you verily i say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart notice that don't doubt not one speck of doubt can be in there your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said if you want deliverance you can have it if you want if you want healing in your body you can have it if you want if you want a greater hunger and thirsting for god you can have it oh my now what i said what not what i said what you said you can have because you and he become the same praise god because the mind that was in christ is in you and the mind that was in christ was to fulfill the father's word which he was the word there you are then you and the word are focused in together only one more time then you and the word are focused in together you become a living unit of god how great musicians you can come up i just we need to be focused this age is so full of distractions and satan will get anything and any any place to distract you from your high calling this is a high calling we're living and we have to be up for the test you got to be up to discipline yourself you got to be up to lose sleep for prayer i'll say it again you gotta be able to lose sleep for prayer lose sleep to read the word of god and have a balance don't just read all word and no prayer you need to have a balance pray more than you read because you can read too much all right you can read the letter killeth but what the spirit brings to life and through a prayer life that's what's going to happen i'm going to bring that to life for you i don't want to just read the word i want to be the word i want to be a living epistle that's what the word calling me to be a living epistle your life is going to do a lot more than you just cramming scripture down in somebody's throat because how many times have people done that how many times have people just cram scripture down people's throat you know a lot of people turn their back on god i hear a lot of catholics because they were cramming this stuff down in their throat and now they turn their back on god i want to live a life that will draw somebody to christ because it's not me living it but it's christ in me as paul said in galatians no more me lives life but christ didn't be crucified can we sing what a day there is coming a day when no heartache shall come no more clouds in the sky no more tissues [Music] is peace forevermore [Music] on that happy golden shore
