[12:50] I don't even think we I don't even know
[12:52] if we even we've never seen that song we
[12:54] just sung and probably not probably
[12:57] hardly anything on that list to Be Sung
[12:58] tonight so if I don't know the words I'm
[13:01] sorry because I don't even know we were
[13:03] gonna sing them so it's fresh every time
[13:05] we're fresh
[13:07] we're like we're like a dog chasing a
[13:08] rabbit what the hottest Trail would go
[13:10] down
[13:11] [Music]
[13:24] we hear about the wars
[13:30] there's questions in the little
[13:33] children's eyes trouble in the East
[13:36] again
[13:37] the whole world is shaking with no ship
[13:42] place to stand there are mournful sounds
[13:45] that are heard throughout the land
[13:49] [Music]
[13:50] here's what I'm listening for
[13:53] but I keep listening for a different
[13:58] sound
[14:00] the sound of the city that Johnson
[14:04] coming down
[14:06] the sound of the Bride being united with
[14:11] the lamb
[14:13] I keep listening I keep listening
[14:19] I keep listening for a different
[14:24] sound
[14:29] I remembered the preacher saying
[14:33] it shall come to pass that will come a
[14:38] generation
[14:39] that will be the last
[14:42] I can't believe we're standing here to
[14:46] see the end of time and that preacher's
[14:50] voice it's set going in my mind
[14:56] [Music]
[15:03] [Music]
[15:08] coming down
[15:10] the sound of the Bride being united with
[15:15] the lamb
[15:17] so I keep listening I keep listening
[15:23] I keep listening for a difference
[15:38] [Music]
[15:48] being united with the lamb
[15:52] sound of a chorus Singing Glory to the
[15:57] lamb
[15:58] I keep listening
[16:01] I keep listening
[16:04] I keep listening
[16:07] I keep listening
[16:21] I'll tell you what since the last time
[16:23] we were here I've gained about 30 pounds
[16:27] and uh where are we anyway
[16:31] and you know what uh actually when I was
[16:34] here last time I had a full head of hair
[16:36] I mean it was black
[16:38] and looked good and fixed and so now uh
[16:42] that's not the case anymore and tell me
[16:45] you were here last time you had a full
[16:47] head of hair
[16:49] it was black it was black you know Just
[16:53] For Men it's keeping it black but I'm
[16:55] glad he's he's here tonight would you
[16:58] make Tim welcome
[17:03] praise God Tim has been singing with us
[17:06] well he started on 15 he's been singing
[17:09] with us for all these years and he's a
[17:11] great blessing to us if we need it fixed
[17:14] we caught him
[17:17] but I'll tell you what he's got a lovely
[17:19] wife and two children and he made a
[17:21] great sacrifice to fly in to be with us
[17:23] so we sure appreciate that also
[17:26] um this guy standing right beside him he
[17:30] was running around chasing dogs and cats
[17:33] last time we was here
[17:34] but now he's married he got three kids
[17:36] got a lovely wife into his name is Caleb
[17:39] Caleb not only does Caleb sing but
[17:42] Caleb's rights
[17:43] and he's got some great songs you're
[17:45] going to enjoy his singing tonight would
[17:47] you make Caleb welcome
[17:48] [Applause]
[17:51] praise God and I've waited for the last
[17:54] one to introduce her because uh I was 12
[17:58] years old we were singing in a little
[17:59] town called Calhoun George anybody ever
[18:01] heard of Calhoun it's just a bump in the
[18:04] road and I was only 12 and we pulled Our
[18:07] Big Bus who was traveling full time with
[18:09] my family then we pulled up beside this
[18:11] church by railroad tracks and I tell you
[18:14] what our bus was longer than the church
[18:16] and that's the truth and we got all set
[18:19] up and I went back to the bus and got
[18:20] dressed and came back in and I said how
[18:22] did I miss that it's just sitting on the
[18:24] back row all by herself the hair way
[18:28] down to their knees big brown beautiful
[18:31] eyes I didn't know her from nobody but I
[18:34] said I'm gonna marry her one day
[18:36] that's the truth six years later she
[18:39] came to Tennessee and asked me to marry
[18:41] and I said yes
[18:43] that's not how it happened but we didn't
[18:45] get married and we're celebrating 45
[18:47] years of marriage
[18:48] [Applause]
[18:53] now I'll tell you what folks a lot of
[18:55] like brother John said a lot of waters
[18:57] went under the bridge and when it comes
[19:00] to heartache pain and trials she's had a
[19:03] double portion in her life I don't know
[19:05] very many people that would have a blood
[19:08] transfusion on Thursday this Thursday
[19:11] check out the hospital drive all the way
[19:14] to Dayton and we drove the rest away
[19:15] yesterday and she's here to sing for you
[19:18] tonight could you give her one more one
[19:20] for tonight

[23:45] foreign
[23:45] [Music]
[23:57] you're saying that it won't be long
[24:01] but long I've carried these troubles and
[24:04] trials yet today I'm just as strong I'm
[24:08] not worried about tomorrow if I'll ever
[24:12] make it to the throne cause God don't
[24:15] take just part of a man and my heart's
[24:19] already gone
[24:20] [Music]
[24:29] I can't wait for the living days nothing
[24:33] here satisfies it's just a few more days
[24:37] to sing his brains and we're going down
[24:41] [Music]
[24:47] somebody say Amen
[24:49] [Music]
[24:56] some folks are laying up Treasures
[24:59] they're getting all that money can buy
[25:02] they're getting into
[25:04] still watch it for you see every man
[25:07] born must die I'm not taking nothing
[25:10] with me I think this world is not mine
[25:15] Treasures are waiting on the other side
[25:18] where my heart's all ready gone
[25:23] I've been laid
[25:25] [Music]
[25:27] late I am by now I can't wait for my
[25:31] living date nothing here satisfies
[25:35] there's just a few more days to sing is
[25:38] praise and we're gonna go together
[25:42] what you see is just a part of me cause
[25:45] my heart's already
[25:50] all right
[25:55] [Music]
[25:57] [Applause]
[25:59] we want to sing Caleb I want Caleb to
[26:02] come and we're going to sing a song that
[26:03] he wrote every time I hear this song
[26:06] it just moves me because if God knows
[26:09] when a sparrow Falls and he does
[26:12] how much more does he know about your
[26:14] problem tonight if it greets him when a
[26:17] little bird falls out of the sky how
[26:19] much more valuable are you him to him
[26:21] tonight he knows all about what you're
[26:24] going through you may wear a big smile
[26:26] and inside just be breaking all apart
[26:28] but God knows and he loves you he loves
[26:31] the sparrow just think if he loves a
[26:33] sparrow that much how much more does he
[26:36] love you God's good to see brother
[26:38] Samuels God bless you let's give them a
[26:40] big hand would you just a patriarch of a
[26:42] mess
[26:43] [Applause]
[26:49] [Music]
[26:53] the mind is such a Battleground and
[26:57] soldiers laws need to be found you
[27:00] stumbled and you dropped your sword you
[27:04] feel that you have failed the Lord tears
[27:08] are streaming down your soul your true
[27:11] desires to be whole but you ain't you
[27:18] wait
[27:21] take no thought in what you say it's not
[27:25] you speak in any way the spirit of life
[27:30] within is rising up to combat sin so let
[27:35] the master take control to reach out to
[27:39] An Empty Soul Don't Wait Don't Wait
[27:46] For he knows when the sparrow Falls and
[27:51] how much more to him you are there's
[27:55] rips and tears from when you fell but
[27:58] his focus is
[28:01] that this world may bring we will remind
[28:05] you of Earthly things
[28:08] would you remember
[28:11] [Music]
[28:17] [Applause]
[28:19] see there comes a fork in life's Road
[28:23] where there's two men standing both
[28:25] alone
[28:27] one offers Earthly things the pleasures
[28:31] that this world can bring have what you
[28:35] want today and there'll be no price to
[28:39] pay but you wait
[28:46] for there's passion in the other's eyes
[28:49] to crosses laying by his side the
[28:53] character in his countenant shines from
[28:56] in your heart is Mercy binds everything
[29:00] that sets you down you feel again that
[29:04] you've been found always
[29:07] don't wait
[29:11] he beckons you his way
[29:16] for he knows when the sparrow Falls how
[29:22] much more to him you are there's rips
[29:25] and tears from when you fail but his
[29:28] focus is
[29:31] that this world will bring will remind
[29:34] you of Earthly things
[29:37] but you remember
[29:41] you're a child of the king
[29:48] for he knows when the sparrow Falls how
[29:53] much more to him you are the strips and
[29:57] tears and when you fell put his focus is
[30:01] behind the veil and the Sorrows that
[30:04] this world will bring we will remind you
[30:07] of Earthly things but you remember
[30:12] you're a child of the king
[30:18] oh your child of the king
[30:26] each other
[30:38] [Music]
[30:43] we wrote a song of kind of unusual song
[30:46] and it's the title of our latest CD
[30:48] uh you know folks uh When the Children
[30:51] visit across the Red Sea they had the
[30:53] right song but there's a little wrong
[30:55] side you see they should have been
[30:57] praising and dancing God when they came
[30:59] down to the river just to think of all
[31:01] that God had led them through all the
[31:03] plagues he put on pharaoh to get him out
[31:05] of there all the Miracles she performed
[31:07] but they waited till they got to the
[31:09] other side to worship God when you come
[31:12] down and there is power and just as
[31:14] there's healing and praise when you come
[31:16] down to a trial just start praising God
[31:19] right then that's the time to praise God
[31:21] and you know what just watch the clouds
[31:23] the sea will part back for you I wrote a
[31:26] song called singing in the rain and you
[31:27] put your hands together we may fumble
[31:29] fumble through the words but we'll start
[31:31] in the key of one two three what key is
[31:34] that
[31:36] I think it's a we'll start in a and
[31:39] we'll just move on up to the the I will
[31:41] keep singing until we get the right kid
[31:43] all right Singing in the Rain how many
[31:46] is ever sung in Trials this is all about
[31:49] that
[31:49] [Music]
[32:15] forecast might be the same

[35:24] Singing in the Rain you know we sing
[35:26] some of these songs that uh some of
[35:28] these older songs we sing I told the
[35:30] boys are there son you can't expect me
[35:31] to play that song in the same key I did
[35:34] 30 years ago and they said yeah Dad you
[35:36] can so I put Tim on how I know he said
[35:39] that's too high I said no it's not you
[35:41] can sit here
[35:42] that's slow
[35:46] let's loaded this song here I wrote this
[35:48] song One Day many years ago Vicki went
[35:50] to the doctor we hadn't been married too
[35:51] long
[35:52] maybe 10 15 years is that a long time
[35:56] but we've been married a while I guess
[35:58] but I she went to the doctor and the
[35:59] doctor said we found a lump in your
[36:02] breast
[36:03] and they wanted to take it out and so
[36:05] that was on uh during the week we went
[36:08] to the church on the weekend just got
[36:09] got it took care of the preacher played
[36:12] hands on her went back to the doctor the
[36:13] next week to get ready to take the X-ray
[36:16] again and the lump was gone
[36:19] let's say that
[36:21] now you know what it always don't happen
[36:24] like that
[36:25] sometimes you may pray and pray and pray
[36:27] like Daniel did Daniel Prayed for 21
[36:29] days he thought God then forgot about
[36:31] him but God said Daniel the first time
[36:34] you started praying I sent the angel
[36:36] your way now the Prince of Persia tried
[36:38] to block him he just sent Michael and
[36:40] his prayer came through you might be
[36:43] there tonight you might be thinking man
[36:45] God has just not forgotten about me he's
[36:48] already sent the answer your way we're
[36:51] gonna sing this song and it's going to
[36:52] be high for me so I'm gonna drop it in a
[36:54] flat so it'll be D how y'all liking all
[36:56] these keychains
[36:58] I was just thinking man what keys you
[37:00] want to do next but this song is called
[37:02] there's power in prayer
[37:04] when a child of God falls on his knees
[37:06] and begins to pray the devil goes into a
[37:08] nervous fit there is power in prayer
[37:12] [Music]
[37:19] [Music]
[37:21] oh Daniel turned his head and prayed but
[37:27] no answer came for 21 days
[37:31] he thought that God
[37:34] I heard his servants pray in there
[37:40] but an angel sent from God that same day
[37:45] but the Prince of Darkness stood in his
[37:48] way
[37:49] the angel overthrew him I can hear
[37:52] Daniel say there's power and prayers
[37:58] there's power in prayers he Caleb if you
[38:02] believe
[38:09] he's all that you need there's power and
[38:13] praise
[38:15] he's a God that don't fail when you are
[38:19] down so cast all your cares on him cause
[38:24] I found he can take a heartache
[38:34] somebody shout hallelujah
[38:37] praise God
[38:41] foreign
[38:44] but no answer came my days turned to
[38:48] weeks my Greeks turned to pain and I
[38:52] cried oh Lord it seemed that you haven't
[38:56] heard my prayer here's what I like
[39:00] but God said I
[39:02] said our first time you call but Satan
[39:05] tried to block your answer to stall
[39:09] reinforcement's been made Satan's had to
[39:12] withdraw there's power in prayer
[39:17] there is power in prayer if you believe
[39:22] that you're not there for you to receive
[39:26] the problems
[39:31] [Music]
[39:34] he's a God that don't fail that's right
[39:37] when you are down
[39:39] cast all your cares on him cause I found
[39:43] he will take a heartache
[39:56] foreign
[40:04] and I fit my notes better but I I know
[40:07] it probably might have looked better I
[40:09] don't know y'all look pretty good

[40:11] felt any better I never felt the love of
[40:13] God as much as I feel in this place done

[40:51] prayer oh here's the good news but God
[40:55] said I heard the first time you call but
[40:59] Satan tried to block your answer to Soul
[41:03] reinforcement's been made Satan's had to
[41:06] withdraw there's power somebody say

[41:12] power in prayer if you believe

[41:26] Praise

[1:05:47] my mother was on one floor of the
[1:05:49] hospital with cancer
[1:05:51] my daddy was on the seventh floor at the
[1:05:53] same time in the hospital
[1:05:56] my dad had a heart attack my mother had
[1:05:58] cancer
[1:05:59] and I remember my dad got better and he
[1:06:02] got out I remember looking out the
[1:06:03] window one morning
[1:06:04] [Music]
[1:06:06] as the sun was coming up
[1:06:08] and the angels packed my mom and took
[1:06:10] her to heaven and I had wrote this song
[1:06:12] and I couldn't really finish it I
[1:06:13] thought wow you know how come I had two
[1:06:16] verses I couldn't get the other verse
