[13:25] In that city where the lamb is the lie.
[13:30] In that city where there cometh no
[13:34] night.
[13:36] I've imagined over there and we're free
[13:39] from toil and care. I am going where the
[13:43] lamb is alive.
[13:46] Here we have our days in sunshine. But
[13:50] we know
[13:52] that the sun shine is upon us now so
[13:56] bright
[13:58] will be changed into the clouds and rain
[14:01] and go
[14:03] to that city where the lamb is alive.
[14:09] In that city where there cometh the lie.
[14:14] In that city where there cometh no
[14:18] night.
[14:20] I've imagined over there and we're free
[14:24] from toil and care. I am going where the
[14:28] lamb is alive.
[14:31] There the flowers bloom forever and a
[14:35] day
[14:37] shall be one eternal day without an eye.
[14:43] And there too shall ever ever wiped
[14:46] away.
[14:48] In that city where the lamb is the lie.
[14:54] In that city where the lamb is alive.
[15:00] In that city where there cometh no
[15:03] night.
[15:05] I've imagined over there and we're free
[15:09] from toiling care. I am going where the
[15:13] lamb is alive.
[15:16] Here we have our disappointments all the
[15:20] while
[15:22] and our foundest hopes but meet the
[15:25] bitter blight.
[15:28] Though by night we weep and mourning
[15:31] brings a smile.
[15:33] In that city where the lamb is the
[15:37] light.
[15:39] In that city where the lamb is alive.
[15:44] In that city where there cometh no
[15:48] night.
[15:50] I've imagined over there and we're free
[15:54] from toil and care. I am going where the
[15:58] lamb is alive.
[16:01] Let the sunlight fade and like night
[16:04] bring its gloom.
[16:07] Not a shadow can my blissful soul of
[16:10] light.
[16:12] For I know up there in heaven there is
[16:15] room.
[16:17] In that city where the lamb is alive.
[16:23] In that city where the lamb is alive.
[16:28] In that city where there cometh no
[16:32] night.
[16:34] I have a mansion over there and we're
[16:37] free from toil and care. I am going
[16:41] where the lamb is alive.

[33:48] Jesus speaking here and he says, "I am
[33:50] that bread of life.
[33:55] Your fathers did eat man in the
[33:56] wilderness and are dead. This is the
[33:59] bread which cometh down from heaven,
[34:01] that a man may eat thereof and not die.
[34:04] I am the living bread which came down
[34:05] from heaven. If any man eat this bread,
[34:07] he shall live forever. and the bread
[34:09] that I will give him give is my flesh
[34:14] which I give for the life of the world.
[34:18] The Jews um therefore strove among
[34:22] themselves, saying, "How can this man
[34:25] give us his flesh to eat?" Then Jesus
[34:28] said unto them, "Verily I say unto you,
[34:31] except you eat the flesh of the Son of
[34:34] Man and drink his blood, you have no
[34:35] life in you. Whosoever eateth my flesh
[34:38] and drinkkeeth my blood have eternal
[34:40] life, and I will raise him up at the
[34:42] last day. For my flesh is meat indeed,
[34:44] and my blood is drink indeed. He that
[34:47] eateth my flesh and drinkketh my blood
[34:49] dwelleth in me, and I in him. As the
[34:52] living father hath sent me, notice
[34:55] living father hath sent me, and I live
[34:58] by the father, so he that eateth me,
[35:02] even he shall uh live
[35:06] by me. This is that bread which came
[35:09] down from heaven, not as your fathers
[35:11] did eat and are dead. Um he that eateth
[35:16] of this bread shall live forever. these
[35:18] things said he in the synagogue as he
[35:21] taught in Capernium. Amen. God bless
[35:23] you. You may be seated.
[35:28] Well, when brother Ron was singing when
[35:30] you all were saying come and dine,
[35:33] I knew we were on the right track that
[35:35] we want to title this message the
[35:36] believer's appetite. And for today's
[35:38] thought to consider, what are you
[35:40] feeding on?
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus himself is declaring here, I am
[35:46] the bread of life. Brother Brennham said
[35:48] in the message, God keeps his word. He
[35:50] says, you know, the Holy Spirit feeds on
[35:52] the word.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread
[35:56] alone, but by every word that proceedth
[35:58] out of the mouth of God." That's what's
[36:00] the matter. One of these things today
[36:04] that makes the church in its anemic
[36:07] condition is because it doesn't take
[36:10] time to feed on the word. Yeah.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll just get it when I come to
[36:18] church. That is not going to make you
[36:21] become the word.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; And I have to say amen to what the
[36:25] prophet said
[36:27] &gt;&gt; because I think we just we've learned
[36:28] to, you know, go with our our daily
[36:30] scripture on the phone or our daily
[36:32] bread at the table or a little devotion
[36:35] here.
[36:38] But if you got the Holy Spirit living
[36:40] inside of you,
[36:42] you feed on the word.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; And it's just it's time to really, I
[36:49] think, evaluate every so often, I should
[36:51] say, what are we feeding on? What have
[36:53] we been feeding on? Because what you eat
[36:56] is what you are.
[36:58] What you eat is what you are. You become
[37:00] what you eat. Uh if you eat a bunch of
[37:03] candy bars all the time, you're probably
[37:06] not going to get very strong.
[37:09] Now, I don't uh honestly I don't eat a
[37:12] lot of meals, but I I do take a lot of
[37:15] vitamins.
[37:17] So, I'm getting the nutrients in there,
[37:20] you know, for my body.
[37:22] And um it's important that you're
[37:25] getting what you need to be a strong
[37:26] Christian. Amen. To a believer, the word
[37:30] of God is literally it means everything
[37:32] to them. It's their very appetite.
[37:34] Brother Brandham said in the message,
[37:36] "Have not I sent thee?" He said, "The
[37:38] Holy Spirit, it feeds on the word of
[37:40] God." So when you get saved, the best
[37:43] thing to do
[37:45] is to sit down with your Bible
[37:48] &gt;&gt; and constantly read.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; That builds you. You see, that's what
[37:54] God did. It's not the reading of some
[37:57] novel. You're not reading so you can you
[38:00] you're reading so you can hang your soul
[38:03] on every punctuation of it. It's right
[38:05] because it is the word of God you see.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Too often people just say, "Well, I got
[38:11] saved and you know, I'm saved. That
[38:12] should be good enough. The church can,
[38:14] you know, do its job and if I go there,
[38:16] everything should be okay." No.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; No. You need every word of God.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if God gives you another day
[38:23] of life, that means he's given you you
[38:25] have the responsibility
[38:28] of of doing what he wants you to do that
[38:30] day.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; It isn't like you just got free time to
[38:34] do whatever you want to do.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Now, I like to type Joshua and Caleb as
[38:39] the elect that came out uh of Egypt
[38:43] because they came out as a mixed
[38:44] multitude, right? So, they were not all
[38:47] elect. And God is speaking to Joshua as
[38:50] the elect in Joshua chapter 1 vers8. He
[38:52] said, "This book of the law shall not
[38:56] depart out of your mouth, but thou shalt
[38:59] meditate therein day and night, that
[39:02] thou mayest observe." Here's the purpose
[39:04] of reading the Bible. So you can observe
[39:07] to do according to all that is written
[39:09] therein. For then thou shalt make thy
[39:12] way prosperous, and then thou shalt have
[39:14] good success. You know, many people want
[39:16] to go on with life and try to be
[39:18] prosperous, have good success without
[39:20] the word of God because they see it
[39:23] happens in the world. The wicked prosper
[39:29] and so they just say, you know, I don't
[39:31] need God. I can prosper.
[39:33] Well, if you're the wicked, you can do
[39:35] that.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; But if you are God's, you can't do that.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; He just won't let you. He's not going to
[39:44] bless you for not trying and bless
[39:46] others for trying.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; He's not that type of God. He's a fair
[39:50] God. He's a just God.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Verse seven, he said, "Only be thou
[39:57] strong and very courageous."
[40:01] Basically, be like a lion
[40:03] that thou mayest observe to do according
[40:06] to all the law which Moses my servant
[40:08] commanded thee. Turn not from it to the
[40:11] right hand or to the left that thou
[40:14] mayest prosper whether the whethersoever
[40:17] thou goest.
[40:19] We need the word.
[40:22] Joshua and Caleb were the elect.
[40:26] And God calls the elect
[40:30] to do all the word, to eat all the word,
[40:32] to to become all the word. Now, that's
[40:34] what he's telling the he is not telling
[40:36] the foolish version that.
[40:40] They don't care what their appetite is.
[40:43] Brother Brandham says the crow will go
[40:45] and he'll eat on anything.
[40:48] He says, "But not that dove.
[40:52] Feeds only on the word of God." To the
[40:55] genuine believer, the true genuine
[40:58] believer, the word of God is important
[41:01] to follow. It's not just, "Well, yeah, I
[41:04] believe it intellectually. I got the Ten
[41:06] Commandments hanging up and I'll never
[41:08] deny it. It's not that. It's that their
[41:11] life has to display it.
[41:14] It's a priority for them. They make the
[41:17] word of God a priority. They meditate
[41:18] upon it day and night. They purpose to
[41:21] follow it. They don't turn from the left
[41:23] to the right. They don't they they don't
[41:25] let their problems or their trials
[41:27] distract them from following the word.
[41:29] You know, a lot of people, they say,
[41:30] "Well, I would have done this, but I got
[41:32] this going on.
[41:34] you don't understand what I'm going
[41:35] through.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; I mean, what a testimony. You don't
[41:38] understand what I'm going through.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Like there's a separate Bible for them
[41:42] or something.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; I mean, we need we need to take God's
[41:46] word as his it is his word.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; And you we can't say int we can't say
[41:52] amen intellectually to the word.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; We've got to say amen in our heart. So
[41:56] when we walk out of here, that word
[41:58] becomes our priority. Amen.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; They observe to do all according to the
[42:06] law. Just like Joshua, just like Caleb,
[42:08] we're no different. We're the same elect
[42:10] of God. We got the same
[42:14] the same hunger, the same appetite for
[42:16] the word of God.
[42:18] To the genuine believer, obeying the
[42:20] word of God is critical. It's
[42:22] imperative. It's vital. It's an
[42:25] absolute. It's not just something we try
[42:27] to fit in our schedule or when it don't
[42:29] hurt us or or when it's convenient for
[42:32] us, we can do it. Or if it's a show in
[42:34] front of somebody. The word of God is
[42:36] important to the believer when nobody's
[42:38] looking.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "My sheep know my voice."
[42:44] And what? They follow it.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; And we know the word of God is the voice
[42:50] of God.
[42:52] Not their thoughts, not their opinions,
[42:55] not their ideas, but the word of God.
[42:58] Too often we take what we feel above
[43:02] what the word of God says.
[43:04] And that's when we begin to compromise.
[43:08] We begin to say, "Well, I I don't need
[43:10] to do this. I don't need I know the
[43:11] prophet said that, and I know Jesus
[43:13] said, and I know Paul said that, you
[43:15] know, but it just doesn't matter. Even
[43:16] if we go to church, come on.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; It just doesn't matter. you know, we
[43:21] don't have to we don't have to really,
[43:23] you know, do everything.
[43:28] Jesus said, "The sheep follow the word
[43:31] for they know his voice."
[43:35] &gt;&gt; But a strange idea, they will not
[43:38] follow. Right? A stranger that will not
[43:41] follow. A strange idea, something that's
[43:43] contrary to the word of God, they will
[43:45] not follow.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; They just say, "Absolutely not." There's
[43:48] no thinking about it. There's no
[43:50] meditating upon it. There's no deci
[43:52] decision about it. I've already made my
[43:55] decision. The word of God is my absolute
[43:57] for my life.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; And this word, I I'll tell you, if
[44:02] everybody around you fell and went back
[44:05] in the world, I'm telling you as a
[44:07] believer, as the elect of God, you stay
[44:09] with the word
[44:11] &gt;&gt; because not everybody that sits in
[44:13] church is going to make it. Amen.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; But to the to the elect, they cannot be
[44:19] deceived. They will not be deceived. And
[44:21] they will hunger and feed on the word of
[44:23] God as if it's their last day, and they
[44:26] need it.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "His sheep hear his voice,
[44:34] and he calleth his own sheep by name,
[44:37] and he leadth them out."
[44:41] Out of what? out of their personal
[44:44] carnal way of life.
[44:48] He's leading them into the life of
[44:49] Christ.
[44:52] Not just
[44:54] all the mysteries,
[44:57] but how to live a Christian life right
[45:00] in our homes,
[45:02] right in our jobs,
[45:07] right amongst one another. Amen.
[45:13] It's personal. He callth his own sheep
[45:16] by name. He said uh nobody's going to
[45:19] God said nobody is going to make it into
[45:21] the promised land except Joshua and
[45:23] Caleb. He calls them by name
[45:26] &gt;&gt; because they were of another spirit.
[45:29] God knows your name.
[45:36] Just because you don't get a a call back
[45:38] or a text back, don't get offended.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; God's got you covered.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; God's got your name.
[45:50] God is the I never said, "I'll never
[45:51] leave you, forsake you." God is the one
[45:54] that gave that promise.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; We need to be looking to the word as our
[45:59] absolute.
[46:03] Not everyone follows the word. Too many
[46:06] follow their feelings, their own
[46:07] understanding. Even though the Bible
[46:09] says lean not to your own understanding,
[46:11] they're still lean to their own
[46:12] understanding.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; There's something personal about the
[46:17] bride. They have learned to care about
[46:19] the word
[46:21] as much as God cares about the word.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; That's the difference between the bride
[46:28] and not the bride.
[46:30] The bride cares about the word just as
[46:33] much as God does
[46:37] because and you've got to care about as
[46:39] much as God does. That's the only way
[46:41] you'll get washed by the word.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you'll say, "I I don't need
[46:46] that. I don't think I need to do that."
[46:48] You know, they they they live in another
[46:51] age. They live in even though they're
[46:54] living in Leodysia,
[46:56] their belief systems back in Luther's
[46:58] age.
[46:59] Right. I repented.
[47:03] I I I I I got baptized and I'm saved.
[47:06] And that's all I feel is needed or is
[47:09] necessary. I don't feel to be some, you
[47:12] know, some called Christian or something
[47:15] like that.
[47:18] But the bride, their appetite is all the
[47:21] word of God.
[47:23] The believer looks to every word for
[47:25] their spiritual leadership.
[47:28] They don't they don't call somebody and
[47:30] say, "What do you think about this
[47:31] situation?"
[47:34] They don't say, "Well, what's your
[47:35] opinion?" Hey, I'm just calling to find
[47:38] out what you think.
[47:41] Well, the way I look at it, no, they the
[47:44] bride looks to the word.
[47:46] The bride has received a message that
[47:49] has opened the word
[47:52] and the believer cares enough about the
[47:56] relationship about God that they
[47:58] literally spend time
[47:59] &gt;&gt; in the word of God.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; They feed upon it. They don't say,
[48:04] "Well, I'll just wing it and then I'll
[48:05] get what I need at church." No, you come
[48:08] to church to find out where you're at
[48:09] with God. You You feed at home.
[48:14] Come on.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's a different it's a
[48:18] you come to find out like today you're
[48:20] going to find out whether you've been
[48:21] feeding or not. That's what you're going
[48:23] to you're going to find out if you need
[48:24] to be feeding more. That's what you're
[48:26] going to find out. He calleth his own
[48:28] sheep by name and he leadth them out. He
[48:30] says, "Listen, John Martin. This is my
[48:33] word. Obey it and it will it will call
[48:36] you out of your situation that you're
[48:39] in."
[48:43] &gt;&gt; That's what the word does. It gives you
[48:45] what you need for your situation.
[48:47] Otherwise, what we have is a bunch of
[48:49] Christians
[48:51] that are just living the life they want
[48:54] to live and have an excuse for crossing
[48:58] the word of God. Come on.
[49:02] It's awful quiet in here.
[49:06] The sheep of God come to church
[49:07] personally to hear from God through
[49:10] what? The spoken word.
[49:13] I mean, God's word is alive. God is
[49:15] here. You know, we can fall asleep. We
[49:17] can daydream. We can go over here. We
[49:19] can wish uh we can't wish that you can't
[49:21] wait till the service is over. We could
[49:23] be thinking about what we want to eat,
[49:24] what we're going to do later today. We
[49:27] could be thinking about a lot of things,
[49:28] but I'm saying this to the bride. I know
[49:31] God is here speaking to her.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; I know that
[49:36] &gt;&gt; because he promised to be.
[49:40] It's just if you're not in that vein,
[49:42] it's like that brother Brand talk about
[49:44] so often about the TV waves, right? If
[49:47] if we had um what it took in these
[49:51] monitors to hook up to the TV, we could
[49:55] be watching TV right now because we got
[49:58] a monitor to receive it. But I don't
[50:01] think we have it.
[50:04] But if we got a monitor to hook up to
[50:07] God,
[50:09] we're going to hear God's voice today
[50:12] &gt;&gt; because he's here.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; It's just a matter of us taking it
[50:16] serious and believing it and and going
[50:19] beyond, well, we're just, you know,
[50:21] having church.
[50:23] No, we're we're having our relationship
[50:24] with God is what we're having. Brother
[50:27] Brandham said in the message the
[50:28] atonement
[50:31] um he said then how can you say you can
[50:35] stay at home and be just as good a
[50:38] Christian as you would be at church
[50:42] says you can't do that.
[50:44] The Holy Spirit feeds on the word.
[50:47] That's why I'm glad God sent a prophet
[50:53] &gt;&gt; because it vindicates Hebrews 10:26.
[50:56] Forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[50:59] together and all the more as you see the
[51:00] day approaching.
[51:02] The Holy Spirit feeds on the word. The
[51:04] Bible is God's spiritual diet for his
[51:06] church.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; I love that one. The Bible is God's
[51:10] spiritual diet for his church. And the
[51:12] Holy Spirit is the one who brings it to
[51:13] you and places it into your heart with
[51:16] thanksgiving. You water it. We got to
[51:18] praise. Praise the word. Praise the word
[51:21] as it's coming forth.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And every divine promise will
[51:26] produce exactly what God said it would
[51:27] do. It's got to. It's the word of God
[51:30] and it's life.
[51:35] Turn with me if you would to John
[51:37] chapter six.
[51:39] We want to just kind of continue on in
[51:41] the verses here from our opening
[51:44] scripture. Many therefore of his
[51:46] disciples when they heard the preaching
[51:49] of Jesus, they said, "This is a hard
[51:52] saying, and who can hear it?"
[51:57] Many of the disciples,
[52:01] these were not unbelievers,
[52:04] these are disciples
[52:07] already. People were following God,
[52:09] following Jesus. They were in a sermon,
[52:11] they heard a sermon, and they said,
[52:13] "Well, the preaching is kind of hard.
[52:15] It's not encouraging today."
[52:19] I don't know what they were saying, but
[52:21] it they their attitude was not good. Let
[52:24] me just say that
[52:26] it was a hard saying for them. Who can
[52:28] hear? Who can bear this? You got to give
[52:30] all your heart to God. Who can bear
[52:32] that? I'd rather go to a church where
[52:34] they're not preaching that.
[52:36] I'd rather go to a church where I can
[52:38] feel just, you know, so so encouraged by
[52:42] the singing.
[52:44] I I I want to go where the word can feed
[52:47] me.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Because I I I tell you, you you can have
[52:50] mega churches, honestly, feel good, but
[52:54] never become more in his image.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Never be no more like Jesus, never want
[53:00] to die out, never want to live for
[53:02] others. Of course, coming to this church
[53:05] doesn't make you do that either.
[53:07] You actually have to believe it
[53:09] &gt;&gt; and then you become it. That's the key.
[53:12] The thing that we have here is we have
[53:13] what it takes to get ready. It doesn't
[53:15] mean we're going to get ready. We have
[53:17] to say, "I will take the word and get
[53:19] ready." And when Jesus knew in himself
[53:23] that his disciples murmured at it, he
[53:27] said unto them, "Does this offend you?
[53:31] Does this offend you?
[53:34] Verse 63. It is the spirit that
[53:37] quickenth. The flesh profitth nothing.
[53:39] The words that I speak unto you, they
[53:42] are spirit and they are life.
[53:46] See, we can see here in the flesh and
[53:49] it's not going to profit us anything.
[53:50] We're just going to go out
[53:53] worse than when we came in.
[53:55] But in reality, if we allow the Holy
[53:58] Spirit to quicken the word to us, the
[54:01] words that I speak unto you, they are a
[54:03] spirit and they are life. They are the
[54:05] thing that changes our lives. If you
[54:07] ever notice just, you know, coming to
[54:09] church and but if your heart's not in
[54:12] it, you really don't it doesn't do you
[54:15] any good. Come on. It it just does. You
[54:18] don't you leave and you just Why did I
[54:20] even come? I came because I had to.
[54:23] My mom and dad, I had to because of
[54:25] this. I had to because of that.
[54:28] But that's because the spirit didn't
[54:30] quicken the word to you.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Because just one word from God can turn
[54:34] your life around. One word from God can
[54:37] turn your life around.
[54:40] But
[54:42] it's just like any life that comes
[54:44] forth.
[54:46] Every one of us that were born when we
[54:49] became life, it was the it was the egg
[54:52] and the sperm that came together and it
[54:55] brought forth life.
[54:57] And even though God is here to birth his
[55:00] word in us, if we are not hungering for
[55:02] that word, God come into me. God reveal
[55:06] yourself to me. Change my life. Change
[55:08] me. Bring me more into your image. If
[55:10] you do not have that vision, life is not
[55:13] going to come forth.
[55:16] And we're living in a dark age of
[55:19] lukewarmness,
[55:22] complacency
[55:23] here. The disciples were murmuring.
[55:27] And he said in verse 64, "But there are
[55:29] some of you that believe not."
[55:33] There are some of you that believe not.
[55:35] For Jesus knew from the beginning who
[55:37] they were that believe not and who
[55:39] should betray him. Now notice he knew
[55:42] from the beginning.
[55:44] He didn't say anything.
[55:47] He knew from the beginning. He gave the
[55:50] parable. He said, "Let the wheat and the
[55:51] tears grow together. Just let it go."
[55:54] God's got everything under control. God
[55:57] knoweth them that are his. Amen.
[56:01] They're still in the congregation. He's
[56:03] speaking to them. He says he's they're
[56:05] still in the congregation, but they
[56:06] don't believe. In other words, it's a
[56:08] make believe. And he said in verse 65,
[56:12] "Therefore said I unto you that no man
[56:14] can come unto me except it were given to
[56:16] him of my father." In other words, all
[56:18] that the father has given me will come
[56:19] and I will not lose a one.
[56:23] 66 From that time many of his disciples
[56:26] went back and walk no more with him. To
[56:30] turn away from God is the mark of the
[56:32] beast.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; It's 666.
[56:38] You don't want to turn back from the
[56:41] word.
[56:44] He said he would forgive every sin
[56:49] except the the the the sin of um
[56:56] Say it again,
[56:59] blasphemy,
[57:01] rejecting the Holy Ghost.
[57:06] Well, the Holy Ghost is the living word
[57:09] &gt;&gt; and it's much more dangerous than what
[57:11] we realize.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Then said Jesus unto his own elect, the
[57:18] 12, will you go? Will you also go away?
[57:24] He says, I I want you to take a stand
[57:26] with the word. Be with the word or
[57:29] without the word. Take take your pick.
[57:32] Jesus said, I'd rather have you hold or
[57:34] hot or cold. Make a decision.
[57:37] Choose you this day whom you'll serve,
[57:39] the word or your will.
[57:42] Will you also go away?
[57:48] Then Simon Peter answered, "Lord, to
[57:50] whom shall we go? Thou has the words of
[57:54] eternal life." Now notice what we're
[57:55] feeding on. "And we believe and are sure
[57:59] that thou art the Christ, the Son of the
[58:00] living God." And Jesus answered them,
[58:02] "Have not I chosen you 12, and one of
[58:05] you is a devil?"
[58:09] And he spake Judas and Scarat the son of
[58:11] Simon, for he it is that which uh that
[58:15] should betray him, being one of the 12
[58:18] right in the congregation right to the
[58:22] end.
[58:25] You know, God is not afraid of anything.
[58:28] He is not afraid of a devil.
[58:31] He's not afraid of someone who just is
[58:34] going to betray him, taught behind his
[58:36] back. He's not afraid of it. He's not
[58:39] moved by it
[58:42] because God knows who he is
[58:46] and the elect knows who she is.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Vengeance belongs to God. He'll take
[58:53] care of it.
[58:56] Paul told Timothy, "Nevertheless, the
[58:58] foundation of God stand sure having this
[59:00] seal. The Lord knoweth them that are
[59:02] his, and let everyone that nameth the
[59:05] name of Christ depart from iniquity." If
[59:08] we're going to say we're a believer,
[59:09] then we need to make sure we're
[59:11] following the word. Following the word
[59:14] is not just going to church.
[59:18] That is I, if I'm not mistaken, that's
[59:20] just in a few few a few little places in
[59:24] this Bible.
[59:27] There's a whole lot more to the good
[59:29] book.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. The B said the way of a true
[59:33] prophet. He says if the Holy Spirit is
[59:35] in you, it only feeds on the word. So a
[59:38] believer must make sure he's feeding on
[59:41] the word daily. Brother Brand says if
[59:44] you want to get become more spiritual,
[59:46] read your Bible and pray daily.
[59:49] It it'll get you where you got to get
[59:51] to. I believe this word is what's
[59:54] carrying us to our to our Isaac.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. John
[1:00:00] chapter 10 verse 25.
[1:00:03] Jesus answered them says, "I told you
[1:00:06] and you believe not. The works that I I
[1:00:10] I do in my father's name. They bear
[1:00:12] witness of me. But you believe not
[1:00:14] because you are not of my sheep as I
[1:00:16] said unto you." Now, here's a real scary
[1:00:19] scripture. a real scary scripture. If we
[1:00:23] don't take the word of God seriously,
[1:00:27] that is Jesus saying you're you you are
[1:00:30] not of my sheep.
[1:00:33] That's how important it is to make sure
[1:00:36] that we're following the word.
[1:00:39] Because if Jesus could come out and just
[1:00:40] say, "Hey, you're not in my sheep." I He
[1:00:43] doesn't want everybody He's not going to
[1:00:45] tell everybody you're my sheep
[1:00:48] just because, you know, to make him feel
[1:00:49] good.
[1:00:52] The thing is we can distinguish. He
[1:00:55] says, "Come on, you know them by their
[1:00:57] fruits."
[1:00:59] Right? Jesus said, "You'll know them by
[1:01:01] their fruits."
[1:01:03] So, we're we're fruit inspectors today.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice. I know them.
[1:01:11] Verse 27 says, "My sheep hear my voice
[1:01:16] and I know them and they follow the word
[1:01:20] of God."
[1:01:24] the voice and and you know we can't can
[1:01:26] you imagine that we we had to depend on
[1:01:30] hearing an audible voice from God all
[1:01:32] the time
[1:01:35] like can you imagine me standing up here
[1:01:36] and saying well this morning when I was
[1:01:39] praying at 5:00 in the morning God came
[1:01:41] in an audible voice and he spoke all
[1:01:44] these things that I'm speaking to you
[1:01:45] today or can you imagine you getting up
[1:01:49] in the morning and you can't go to work
[1:01:51] and you can't make do anything until you
[1:01:53] hear the literal voice of God.
[1:01:59] We have the word of God. It is the voice
[1:02:02] of God.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; But it needs to become alive to us.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Many people read this book, they're
[1:02:09] going to hell.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; But how many can read this book and say,
[1:02:15] "Even though I don't hear literally, I
[1:02:18] hear with my heart that this is God
[1:02:20] speaking to me." Amen.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; I don't know about my sister, my
[1:02:24] brother, my father, my mother, my child.
[1:02:27] I don't know about them.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; But for me, I accept this is God
[1:02:32] personally speaking to me.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:39] Verse 28.
[1:02:41] And I give unto them eternal life, and
[1:02:44] they shall never perish, neither shall
[1:02:45] any man pluck them out of my hand. What
[1:02:47] a comfort right there. Just follow God.
[1:02:50] Nobody's going to pluck you out. My
[1:02:52] father which gave them me is greater
[1:02:54] than all and no man is able to pluck
[1:02:56] them out of my father's hand. I and my
[1:02:58] father are one.
[1:03:00] As we follow the word each time we come
[1:03:03] to church, then we become one with God.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; But to go ahead and come to church and
[1:03:11] not follow what we hear, you're we're
[1:03:13] not becoming one with God. Brother
[1:03:16] Brandham says you're either closer to
[1:03:17] God or further away.
[1:03:19] You can get so far away from God that
[1:03:22] you're actually comfortable being away.
[1:03:26] That's shocking. That That is shocking.
[1:03:29] Like it's okay if you're not feeding on
[1:03:31] the word of God. You can literally get
[1:03:32] to a place
[1:03:34] seriously, you can go so long without
[1:03:36] eating that you don't even care about
[1:03:38] eating.
[1:03:42] Yeah.
[1:03:46] All right. Remember how just before
[1:03:49] Jesus went to to Calvary,
[1:03:52] he gave an important message and I might
[1:03:55] uh share this down the road.
[1:04:00] What was the main message that Jesus
[1:04:02] gave to his disciples before he went to
[1:04:04] the Garden of Gethsemane?
[1:04:07] That that
[1:04:09] his disciples would be one with him as
[1:04:12] Jesus was with the father. That was the
[1:04:15] last message they gave. It was an
[1:04:17] important message.
[1:04:19] I want you to think about this was the
[1:04:21] same message that Brother Bruce left us
[1:04:23] his last message.
[1:04:26] Same one that Jesus gave, brother Bruce
[1:04:28] gave.
[1:04:30] And I want to just read a few verses
[1:04:32] here in St. John chapter 17 verse 20.
[1:04:34] Neither pray I for these alone, but for
[1:04:38] them also which shall believe on me
[1:04:41] through their word.
[1:04:45] In other words, God has a five-fold
[1:04:47] ministry that he gives us the word
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; that they all may be one. God wants us
[1:04:55] to be one. Put away the differences.
[1:04:59] Put away I don't have to humble
[1:05:02] yourself. Become one with God.
[1:05:06] That they all may be one as thou Father
[1:05:08] art in me and I in thee. That they also
[1:05:11] may be one in us. that the world may
[1:05:13] believe that thou has sent me and that
[1:05:15] the glory which thou gavest me I have
[1:05:17] given them that they may be one even as
[1:05:19] we are one. See that was a strong
[1:05:22] message that Jesus wanted his disciples
[1:05:24] to have in so much that this became his
[1:05:27] prayer his prayer with his disciples.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to leave you with.
[1:05:33] And he goes and he he leaves that and
[1:05:35] then his prayer is God um if it's
[1:05:38] possible let this cup pass for me but
[1:05:40] nevertheless not my will but thy will be
[1:05:42] done
[1:05:44] but before that to carry on his part his
[1:05:47] concern was for the body
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; and that they would become one notice
[1:05:53] when brother Brandan goes beyond the
[1:05:54] curtain of time he describes that place
[1:05:57] as perfect love that they were all
[1:06:00] coming up and saying my precious other
[1:06:04] that they were all expressing
[1:06:07] thank God you came and gave us the word
[1:06:09] so we could be here.
[1:06:12] So this oneness as we come one with the
[1:06:14] word you automatically have love one for
[1:06:17] another. You automatically are living
[1:06:18] for one. You automatically are concerned
[1:06:20] about one another
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; because that the word is concerned about
[1:06:24] you. It died at Calvary.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Now you become the word. You become the
[1:06:29] same God to others as Jesus was to you.
[1:06:31] the very same thing. You're his you're
[1:06:34] you you you're you're his ambassadors.
[1:06:37] You're his representative. You're his
[1:06:38] disciples.
[1:06:40] You're just like him. Amen.
[1:06:44] In verse, what verse are we on?
[1:06:47] 23. I thought so. And I in them and thou
[1:06:49] in me, that they may be made perfect in
[1:06:53] one, and that the world may know that
[1:06:55] thou has sent me and has loved them as
[1:06:59] thou has loved me. God loves us the same
[1:07:03] as he loved Jesus. Isn't that beautiful?
[1:07:06] In the message, Queen of Sheba, brother
[1:07:08] B says, God intends the Holy Spirit to
[1:07:10] lead the church.
[1:07:13] That's our leader.
[1:07:15] That's the one that was sent to us.
[1:07:19] And we're to be dominated by him. I like
[1:07:23] that word. We're to be dominated by him.
[1:07:25] And him alone, brother Bram says, that
[1:07:28] directs us. Then we stay in that word
[1:07:31] level in the word balanced as as brother
[1:07:36] uh George would say the Holy Spirit
[1:07:39] feeds you sheep food and sheep food is
[1:07:43] the Bible
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; and it feeds on the Holy Spirit. The
[1:07:48] soul that's hungering for God feeds on
[1:07:50] the word of God. Amen.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, I think we need to get
[1:07:54] rid of a little bit of our anemic
[1:07:56] situation
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; and start feeding on the word of God
[1:07:59] more. Don't just give God a little bit
[1:08:01] and think, well, that's enough. That is
[1:08:03] not enough to become him. You we need
[1:08:06] like every word of God. We got to hunger
[1:08:08] for every word of God. We got to become
[1:08:10] every word of God so we can manifest
[1:08:11] that life to others. Amen.
[1:08:15] All right. John chapter 15 verse number
[1:08:18] three. submission or obedience to the
[1:08:20] word of God is the only thing that can
[1:08:22] bring oneness with God.
[1:08:26] So, we got to abide in the word. And
[1:08:28] that's what we're going to get into here
[1:08:29] for a little bit. Abiding. John 15:3
[1:08:32] says, "Now you are clean through the
[1:08:33] word which I have spoken unto you." Now,
[1:08:35] I I remember going to a church and in
[1:08:38] that church, um, Brother Marty, what
[1:08:41] they would do is they would take this
[1:08:42] water and they'd sprinkle it on you
[1:08:46] and you'd become like clean
[1:08:49] through this holy water. But that's not
[1:08:51] what Jesus said.
[1:08:53] It's the word that cleanses us. So, I'll
[1:08:56] say it like this. It's not coming to
[1:08:57] church and hearing the word of God
[1:09:00] sprinkle on your ears.
[1:09:02] It's you taking the word in your heart
[1:09:04] and saying, "Lord, I love that word that
[1:09:06] you just gave me."
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; And that word cleanses you.
[1:09:13] Abide in me and I in you. As the branch
[1:09:18] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[1:09:21] abide in the vine, no more can you
[1:09:24] except you abide in me. Now, I don't
[1:09:27] know if you've ever done I'm sure you've
[1:09:28] done this. How many has ever uh by
[1:09:31] mistake by mistake broken off a a limb
[1:09:36] or a flower to a plant? By mistake.
[1:09:42] Okay. Now, what is the first thing that
[1:09:44] you think?
[1:09:46] Oh, no. It's going to die.
[1:09:50] It's not going to make it. And I I've
[1:09:53] done it a number of times and I've not
[1:09:54] wanted to tell Sher I did it.
[1:09:57] So, I'll go cut it. put it and say,
[1:09:59] "Here's a flower I picked for you."
[1:10:04] But in reality, if we don't stay abiding
[1:10:06] in the word, we're we're not going to be
[1:10:08] able to bring forth the life of Christ.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; It's just impossible.
[1:10:12] I mean, so many churches are out there
[1:10:14] that there's a form of godliness.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; But they have no power to overcome. They
[1:10:19] have no power to to work through things.
[1:10:22] They have no power to become in the
[1:10:24] image of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:28] They they didn't go on to get deity.
[1:10:30] They didn't go on to get the Holy Ghost,
[1:10:32] which is the living word of God.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; We can't, you know, Brother Brandham,
[1:10:36] you can go to a college for five years
[1:10:39] or however many years and get all these
[1:10:41] degrees that you can plaster a wall with
[1:10:43] it and still not have a personal
[1:10:46] relationship with Jesus Christ.
[1:10:49] But if you are just sincere and honest
[1:10:51] in your heart and not for five minutes,
[1:10:56] but if you get on your if you're if
[1:10:59] you're sincere from here on out and you
[1:11:01] get on your knees for five minutes, more
[1:11:03] can be done in that five minutes than
[1:11:05] all your effort trying to learn about
[1:11:07] God.
[1:11:13] All right. Verse five. I am the vine.
[1:11:15] You are the branches. He that abideth me
[1:11:16] and I in him, the same bringeth forth
[1:11:18] much fruit. For without me can do
[1:11:21] nothing. And if a man abide not in me is
[1:11:23] cast forth as a branch and is withered
[1:11:25] and men gather them and cast them into
[1:11:27] the fire and they are burned.
[1:11:30] So that's eventually going to happen,
[1:11:32] don't you think?
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:36] If you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:11:42] you, ye shall ask what you will and it
[1:11:45] shall be done unto you. But you have to
[1:11:48] abide in the word. The word must abide
[1:11:51] in you. Jesus' commandment is for the
[1:11:55] word to abide, not to visit you
[1:11:59] and and not just to be in your mind
[1:12:04] because because your mind is like uh you
[1:12:07] know what your mind is? It's like
[1:12:08] watching a show. What is going to happen
[1:12:12] next? What's the next episode?
[1:12:15] There's nothing solid. That's why we
[1:12:18] need the mind of Christ.
[1:12:20] The word must abide in the heart.
[1:12:25] Not just the word visit us. Not we just
[1:12:28] visit the word. Not just hear it in some
[1:12:32] song or you know somebody sends us a
[1:12:34] quote on the phone.
[1:12:36] We've got to abide. There's a difference
[1:12:38] between abiding and just visiting.
[1:12:43] Like if any of you came over to our
[1:12:45] house, you would be visiting.
[1:12:48] But I am the only one here in this room
[1:12:50] anyways that abides there,
[1:12:54] right? But I'm telling you, I will share
[1:12:56] it if you come and you want to pay the
[1:12:57] taxes and stuff like that.
[1:13:03] Now, in the ark of the covenant, the ark
[1:13:06] always was abiding in the camp of the
[1:13:09] Hebrews.
[1:13:10] Wherever the pillar of fire led them at
[1:13:12] night, the covenant went with them. They
[1:13:14] just picked up the the covenant. It went
[1:13:16] in in the daytime when the the pillar of
[1:13:18] the cloud went, they picked up and and
[1:13:21] the ark of the covenant went with them.
[1:13:23] So the ark of the covenant always abided
[1:13:26] with God's people.
[1:13:29] Always. They never left it.
[1:13:33] Now, inside the ark of the covenant
[1:13:35] contain three things. The Ten
[1:13:36] Commandments, Aaron's rod, and the the
[1:13:39] pot of mana.
[1:13:41] And you dare not touch the ark or you
[1:13:44] would die
[1:13:46] because the covenant inside the covenant
[1:13:49] was the very life of God
[1:13:53] and you just couldn't go up there and
[1:13:54] you know do whatever you wanted to do.
[1:13:59] Now Aaron's rod was always budding.
[1:14:03] You know, you just we could take any
[1:14:07] stick
[1:14:09] that we want from a tree and throw it in
[1:14:12] a box and I'm telling you, life is not
[1:14:14] going to come forth from it.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; But Aaron's rod always had life. It was
[1:14:20] bearing fruit, flowers, almonds. It was
[1:14:23] there. You when it opened up, it was
[1:14:25] just as if it just got picked. And it's
[1:14:28] because the life of God was in it. Now,
[1:14:31] the mana that was in the pot, that never
[1:14:36] got spoiled. It never got mold on it. It
[1:14:40] never stank.
[1:14:42] It was just as fresh as it came out of
[1:14:44] the oven.
[1:14:47] And why was it? How could it be kept
[1:14:49] that way in this wooden box
[1:14:52] that was overlaid with gold inside and
[1:14:55] out? And it was because the life of God
[1:14:58] was in there.
[1:15:01] And that ark is nothing but a a a a a a
[1:15:03] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:15:03] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:15:04] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:15:04] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:15:04] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:15:04] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:15:04] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:15:04] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:15:04] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:15:05] type of the believer today
[1:15:08] where there's literally
[1:15:11] wood, this humanity,
[1:15:14] but it needs to be overlaid with gold
[1:15:17] inside and out. Come by me gold tried in
[1:15:20] the fire. Get your life wrapped around
[1:15:23] me inside of you, outside, Jesus on the
[1:15:25] inside, working on the outside where
[1:15:27] we're becoming all Christ. Then the life
[1:15:29] of God is there. It's no longer a form
[1:15:31] of godliness, but you truly got joy.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; You've got peace. You've got love. You
[1:15:38] don't have to have everything worked out
[1:15:40] right.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; All you need is God. You got everything.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; I got Jesus. I got it all.
[1:15:53] When Jesus walked the earth, he was the
[1:15:56] ark of the covenant to man.
[1:15:59] Much could be said here, but inside of
[1:16:02] Jesus was life. Turn with me if you
[1:16:05] would to Hebrews chapter 8:7. For if the
[1:16:08] first covenant had been faultless, then
[1:16:11] should no place have been sought for a
[1:16:13] second. So, the ark of the covenant,
[1:16:18] God,
[1:16:20] the bride has a covenant with God that
[1:16:24] nobody else has.
[1:16:26] Think about that.
[1:16:34] Um,
[1:16:37] now
[1:16:40] we could almost say it's like a deed.
[1:16:44] Going out on a limb here because this is
[1:16:48] um or if I could say like this a will. A
[1:16:53] will.
[1:16:54] So like sometimes when uh a family
[1:16:59] member passes away, a mother or father,
[1:17:02] um you may have something that would be
[1:17:05] willed to you because they're no longer
[1:17:07] alive and it's given to you. And and a
[1:17:10] lot people had that that benefit. I
[1:17:13] didn't have that benefit when my dad
[1:17:15] died. I actually had to help pay for him
[1:17:18] to get buried.
[1:17:21] But uh it becomes yours. And so the
[1:17:25] bride has a covenant with God that they
[1:17:28] get something that everybody else don't
[1:17:30] get.
[1:17:32] And so he he he makes a covenant. He
[1:17:36] tries to give it to everybody. He said,
[1:17:37] "This is my will. Here's the covenant.
[1:17:41] You keep my word, I'll give you eternal
[1:17:43] life." He says it to everybody, but
[1:17:47] obviously nobody could keep it. Not a
[1:17:50] person.
[1:17:52] All our sinners come short of the glory
[1:17:54] of God. But God gives something to the
[1:17:58] bride.
[1:18:03] Now what he gives to the bride is what
[1:18:06] allows them to keep the covenant. Are
[1:18:10] you with me?
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; All right. So the first covenant had if
[1:18:14] the first covenant had been faultless,
[1:18:15] then should no place have been sought
[1:18:17] for another covenant, a second. for
[1:18:19] finding fault with them. He saith,
[1:18:21] Behold, the days come, sayeth the Lord,
[1:18:23] that I will make a new covenant with the
[1:18:25] house of Israel, and with the house of
[1:18:27] Judah, not according to the covenant
[1:18:29] that I made with their fathers in the
[1:18:30] day that I took them by the hand, led
[1:18:32] them out of Egypt, the land of Egypt,
[1:18:34] because they continued not in my
[1:18:37] covenant, and I regarded them not,
[1:18:40] sayeth the Lord. So, as soon as you
[1:18:42] leave the word, don't expect God to go
[1:18:44] with you.
[1:18:46] For this is the covenant that I will
[1:18:48] make with the house of Israel after
[1:18:50] those days, sayeth the Lord. I will put
[1:18:53] my laws into their mind, and I will
[1:18:57] write them in their hearts, and I will
[1:19:00] be to them a god, and they shall be to
[1:19:02] me a people.
[1:19:06] So, this is why we should come to the
[1:19:09] altar and seek more of the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:12] I can't say it any simpler than that.
[1:19:17] The Holy Ghost is literally the living
[1:19:20] word of God.
[1:19:22] And what the devil is offering the
[1:19:24] church is an intellectual word of God.
[1:19:28] You know, you don't have to put your
[1:19:30] heart into it. You know, just
[1:19:32] intellectually receive the word
[1:19:35] and that and feel good about it that you
[1:19:37] understand it.
[1:19:40] But never take time to see am I living
[1:19:43] this word when I leave.
[1:19:47] But God will not come in unless we want
[1:19:50] him to come in. What a what a beautiful
[1:19:53] God we serve. He doesn't force himself
[1:19:55] in. Can you imagine him forcing himself
[1:19:58] in on one person? They they would be so
[1:20:01] upset. Get out of here. What are you
[1:20:03] doing?
[1:20:05] I don't I don't want this. I don't want
[1:20:06] to be a Christian. I want to go live in
[1:20:09] the world. What are you doing?
[1:20:12] So he waits till somebody wants him more
[1:20:16] than they want anything else. You shall
[1:20:18] seek me and find me when you search for
[1:20:20] me with all your heart.
[1:20:24] He'll put himself inside of you if you
[1:20:27] really want him.
[1:20:31] All right. Verse 11. Now notice what's
[1:20:34] going to happen when he puts the laws
[1:20:36] inside of you.
[1:20:38] And they shall not and they shall not
[1:20:41] teach every man his neighbor and
[1:20:43] everyone his brother, saying, "Know the
[1:20:45] Lord, for all shall know me from the
[1:20:48] least to the greatest." So what is he
[1:20:49] saying right here?
[1:20:51] When you truly have God inside of you,
[1:20:55] you don't got to be taught everything.
[1:20:58] What h what happened in Africa when the
[1:21:02] Holy Spirit came down and all those
[1:21:05] naked women
[1:21:07] As soon as the Holy Ghost came down in
[1:21:10] their midst, something inside of them
[1:21:12] said, "Cover."
[1:21:15] And this is what happens when you
[1:21:17] receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:19] You have no need that any man teach you,
[1:21:21] but the Holy Spirit inside you teaches
[1:21:23] you all things.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Now, we have a five-fold ministry. We
[1:21:27] need that. But the five-fold ministry is
[1:21:29] teaching us that the Holy Ghost is all
[1:21:32] that we need to make it.
[1:21:43] For I will be merciful to their
[1:21:45] unrighteousness and to their sins and to
[1:21:47] their iniquities will I remember no
[1:21:49] more. In that he saith a new covenant.
[1:21:53] He made the first old.
[1:21:56] Now that which decayth and waxth old is
[1:21:59] ready to vanish away.
[1:22:02] We're no longer depending upon the
[1:22:05] ability to keep God's word in our own
[1:22:08] self. It will will certainly fail.
[1:22:12] Ezekiel 11:19 kind of verifying this is
[1:22:15] I will give them a new heart and I will
[1:22:17] put my I will put a new spirit within
[1:22:20] you and I will take out oh how beautiful
[1:22:23] and I will take the stony heart out of
[1:22:26] their flesh and I will give them a heart
[1:22:27] of flesh. I remember, brother Ron,
[1:22:30] Brother Marty, when I was young, I was
[1:22:33] something to be reckoned with.
[1:22:37] You didn't want to get me mad.
[1:22:41] But God
[1:22:43] took out that heart
[1:22:47] and gave a heart that's
[1:22:50] full of love.
[1:22:53] That is okay. If it doesn't get its way,
[1:22:56] it's going to be okay.
[1:23:00] That can't live peaceably with all men,
[1:23:03] that can't live for others.
[1:23:07] That's all God's doing. He's the one
[1:23:10] that put that spirit in. I never went to
[1:23:12] some classes and learned how to be a
[1:23:13] good boy.
[1:23:17] Verse 20. That they may walk in my
[1:23:20] statutes. Notice what he's doing it for.
[1:23:22] that they may walk in my statutes and
[1:23:24] keep my ordinances and do them, and they
[1:23:26] shall be my people, and I will be their
[1:23:28] God. The purpose that God gives you, the
[1:23:31] Holy Ghost, is so that you can follow
[1:23:33] the word.
[1:23:35] And if you are, if you if you're
[1:23:37] predestinated,
[1:23:38] if you're predestinated, you will become
[1:23:41] the word.
[1:23:42] And if you're not predestinated to the
[1:23:44] word, you cannot become the word.
[1:23:47] So to me, instead of gambling, taking
[1:23:51] chances, get serious about hungering,
[1:23:54] thirsting for for more of God.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brand said in the message,
[1:23:57] questions and answers, law having a
[1:24:00] shadow. He says, "Now when a man's
[1:24:02] speaking or preaching up here at the
[1:24:04] platform or a message is going forth, if
[1:24:07] the man is of God, he's anointed of the
[1:24:10] spirit to preach the word."
[1:24:13] And that's the Holy Spirit. The Holy
[1:24:16] Spirit is moving there. That's just your
[1:24:20] gift there trying to get you started.
[1:24:22] But the Holy Spirit is coming through
[1:24:24] the word
[1:24:26] and the Holy Spirit will always the Holy
[1:24:29] Spirit feeds on the word of God and it
[1:24:33] will recognize the word and be what?
[1:24:36] Reverent.
[1:24:39] It'll be reverent. And then when the
[1:24:42] time comes when the Holy Spirit has left
[1:24:45] the platform has has left the platform
[1:24:49] off, the minister comes out of there,
[1:24:52] then you're in order.
[1:24:56] I believe God is a God of order. He's
[1:25:00] not a God of confusion. He's a God that
[1:25:03] takes confusion and brings order. He's
[1:25:06] not afraid of confusion. He's not
[1:25:09] intimidated by confusion. He can take a
[1:25:12] situation and he can make all things
[1:25:14] beautiful in his time.
[1:25:17] Jesus said, "If you abide in me, my
[1:25:19] words abide in. You shall ask what you
[1:25:20] will and it shall be done unto you." We
[1:25:23] need to eat daily the bread of life.
[1:25:26] When Jesus taught his disciples to pray,
[1:25:28] he said, "Give us this day our daily
[1:25:31] bread." We need we need the word of God
[1:25:36] spoken to our heart personally.
[1:25:39] I mean, we can we can we can go on
[1:25:41] through the course of the day. How many
[1:25:42] has ever gone through the course of the
[1:25:43] day and you didn't pray?
[1:25:47] Come on, be honest. Who Who's lying
[1:25:49] here?
[1:25:51] Okay, all the liars, lift your hands
[1:25:53] now.
[1:25:54] Okay, now when when we've gone when
[1:25:58] we've notice I'm including myself in
[1:25:59] this group. When we've gone on through
[1:26:02] the day,
[1:26:04] um it doesn't mean
[1:26:08] the car blew up and we had to get a new
[1:26:09] engine. We we we
[1:26:13] literally made it through the day and
[1:26:16] and and and if you do it enough, you
[1:26:18] know what the devil tells you?
[1:26:21] What's the big deal about praying? You
[1:26:22] can make it without it. And and before
[1:26:25] you know it, you become laxed in prayer.
[1:26:29] And then what you're doing is you're
[1:26:32] slowly separating yourself from the
[1:26:34] vine.
[1:26:36] And then you're just out in the world
[1:26:37] before you ever before you ever came to
[1:26:40] Christ just kind of making it through
[1:26:41] without Christ. So it can be done and it
[1:26:44] seems reasonable
[1:26:47] but it's death.
[1:26:50] It's absolutely death.
[1:26:52] So we can try in ourselves to be the
[1:26:54] best Christian or we can focus our
[1:26:57] efforts on falling in love with God,
[1:27:00] eating the bread of life, getting the
[1:27:03] word inside the ark. Amen. which is our
[1:27:06] heart.
[1:27:08] When we seek the Holy Spirit, we're
[1:27:10] seeking the living word of God, not just
[1:27:12] well, you know, what's Brother John
[1:27:13] gonna say today.
[1:27:16] You know, can we talk about can we
[1:27:18] remember what was said in the sermon
[1:27:19] today?
[1:27:21] I think what's important is did God
[1:27:23] speak to us?
[1:27:26] So, when we seek the Holy Spirit, we're
[1:27:28] seeking the living word of God. We come
[1:27:30] to church not to hear a sermon. we come
[1:27:33] to church that God speaks to us.
[1:27:35] Personally, I think every one of us
[1:27:37] should be able to go home after every
[1:27:39] service and say, "This is what God spoke
[1:27:42] to me."
[1:27:44] I think we should all be able to say
[1:27:45] that. And if we can't do that, I think
[1:27:47] we should be practicing it.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, um, help me to pay attention.
[1:27:53] Help me to to hear from you because I'm
[1:27:56] sure we could all go home and say what
[1:27:58] we've heard, some things that we heard,
[1:28:01] but what did God speak to us personally?
[1:28:03] That's really more important. I'd rather
[1:28:04] have God speak to me one word than to be
[1:28:06] able to quote the whole sermon
[1:28:09] because that one word is personal
[1:28:11] between God and me. And if that's where
[1:28:13] God's at, that's where I want to be. I
[1:28:16] want to focus on that. If the word
[1:28:19] remains in our minds alone, it will not
[1:28:21] produce life.
[1:28:23] It will not bud forth the fruit of the
[1:28:26] Holy Ghost. It will not produce
[1:28:28] Galatians 5:22. It will not keep God's
[1:28:31] commandments. So the word must enter our
[1:28:34] hearts.
[1:28:35] It must abide there.
[1:28:39] Psalms 1 verse1 says, "Blessed is the
[1:28:41] man that walketh not in the counsel of
[1:28:43] the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of
[1:28:45] sinners, nor standeth in the seat of the
[1:28:47] scornful, but his delight is in the law
[1:28:50] of the Lord, and in his law doth he
[1:28:52] meditate day and night." There it is.
[1:28:59] And he shall be like a tree planted by
[1:29:01] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[1:29:03] his fruit in his season. His leaf also
[1:29:05] shall not wither. and whatsoever he
[1:29:07] doeth, it shall prosper. The ungodly are
[1:29:10] not so, but they are like the chaff of
[1:29:12] the wind with the chaff which the wind
[1:29:14] driveth away.
[1:29:17] God has a way of separating the lawless
[1:29:21] and the uncaring
[1:29:23] and the ungodly from the believer.
[1:29:28] Those who choose not to have God's law
[1:29:31] living in their heart. Those who choose
[1:29:34] their own will above God's will for
[1:29:36] their lives, they are like the chaff
[1:29:39] which the wind driveth away.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Basically, our will is sinking sand.
[1:29:47] Therefore, the ungodly, verse 5 says,
[1:29:49] shall not stand in judgment, nor sinners
[1:29:52] in the congregation of the righteous.
[1:29:55] Now, that word stand, the ungodly shall
[1:29:58] not stand in judgment. We're all going
[1:29:59] to judgment. That's not what that means.
[1:30:00] That word stand means abide. The ungodly
[1:30:03] shall not abide in judgment. In other
[1:30:06] words, they're going to be judged and
[1:30:08] sent. The bride will remain. The bride
[1:30:11] remains at judgment.
[1:30:14] For the Lord knoweth the way of the
[1:30:16] righteous, but the way of the ungodly
[1:30:18] shall perish. It shall come to an end.
[1:30:20] So the man who delights himself in the
[1:30:22] word of God, he never withers
[1:30:25] and he always prospers whatever he does.
[1:30:28] Wow. You know what? That sounds to me
[1:30:30] like wisdom.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; But the ungodly are not so. They are
[1:30:34] lawless. They're uncontrollable.
[1:30:36] They are their own god. Their lives are
[1:30:39] never planted. They're tossed to and
[1:30:41] fro. Peter said they're barren,
[1:30:43] unfruitful, blind, cannot see a far off,
[1:30:46] and have forgotten that their old that
[1:30:47] they were purged from their own sins.
[1:30:51] Jude said it like this. They they were
[1:30:53] before of old ordained to this
[1:30:55] condemnation, ungodly men, turning the
[1:30:58] grace of God into lasciviousness and
[1:31:01] denying the only Lord God and the Lord
[1:31:04] Jesus Christ. That word lascivious means
[1:31:06] uncontrollable
[1:31:08] wantingness.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Like every day want want
[1:31:13] not thinking about God's will now, but
[1:31:15] they want uncontrollable
[1:31:18] wantness. It refers to a you look this
[1:31:21] word up.
[1:31:23] It refers to a lack of moral restraint.
[1:31:28] It disregards legal
[1:31:31] standards, rules, or proper boundaries.
[1:31:34] It just defies them. It does not care.
[1:31:40] ungodly men
[1:31:45] sometimes a form of godliness but
[1:31:47] denying the power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:31:49] Paul said turn away from them ungodly
[1:31:52] men turning the grace of God into
[1:31:55] uncontrollable wantness.
[1:31:59] God gives us grace and it's not enough.
[1:32:04] We want more. We want our own will.
[1:32:10] God's will is the only thing that should
[1:32:12] matter to the believer. Says, I will put
[1:32:14] you I will therefore put you in
[1:32:16] remembrance. Therefore, you once knew
[1:32:18] this that how the Lord how the Lord
[1:32:21] having saved the people out of the land
[1:32:22] of Egypt were afterwards he destroyed
[1:32:24] them that believe not.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; So you got to keep on believing.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; You can't just you know once saved
[1:32:32] always saved no matter what you do.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; That is not doctrinal. That is not in
[1:32:37] the word.
[1:32:39] If you were once saved and you decide to
[1:32:42] do whatever you want, God can take your
[1:32:45] name out of the book of life.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; He can destroy you just like the
[1:32:49] examples in the Bible. So what we have
[1:32:51] to do is we actually have to have a life
[1:32:53] that continues on to believe,
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; continue on to grow in Christ to become
[1:32:59] Let me ask you a question and answer
[1:33:01] this question with me. Is there anybody
[1:33:05] in here that believes that your life
[1:33:09] should not be closer to God more today
[1:33:13] than it was a year ago? Let me see your
[1:33:14] hand.
[1:33:20] We all believe that our lives should be
[1:33:24] closer to God.
[1:33:26] Yeah. Each day, absolutely. But we
[1:33:29] should be able to look back a year from
[1:33:30] now
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; and say, "I know that I know that I know
[1:33:34] I'm closer to God.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; I know that I'm more in his image."
[1:33:39] Now, that is a sign that you are walking
[1:33:42] towards Christ.
[1:33:44] You know, Brother Brham says it's real
[1:33:46] easy to know where you're going. James,
[1:33:48] he says, just look at what you're being
[1:33:50] drawn to.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; What are you feeding on?
[1:33:56] Because Christ is drawing us to his
[1:33:59] image. He's not drawing us to just have
[1:34:02] prosperous lives.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Prosperous in him.
[1:34:08] All right. They despise dominion, speak
[1:34:12] evil of dignities. They speak evil of
[1:34:15] those things which they know not. But
[1:34:17] what but what they know naturally is
[1:34:18] brute based in those things which they
[1:34:21] corrupt themselves. Woe unto them for
[1:34:22] they have gone the way of Cain and ran
[1:34:24] greedily after the heir of Balum for
[1:34:27] reward and perished in the gainstain of
[1:34:29] Kora. These are they said these are
[1:34:32] spots in your feast of charity. In other
[1:34:34] words, they go to church.
[1:34:37] They feast with you feeding themselves.
[1:34:40] They come to church without the fear of
[1:34:42] God.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Feeding themselves without fear. Clouds
[1:34:45] they are without water carried about
[1:34:47] winds. Trees whose fruit wither, who
[1:34:50] whose fruit twice dead, plucked up by
[1:34:52] the roots, raging waves of the sea,
[1:34:56] foaming out of their own shame,
[1:34:57] wandering stars to whom is reserved the
[1:35:00] blackness of darkness forever.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; I say it's time to make sure that we're
[1:35:08] abiding in the covenant of God. Amen.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Peter said the wherefore the rather
[1:35:14] brethren give diligence to make your
[1:35:16] calling and election sure for if you do
[1:35:18] these things you shall never fall.
[1:35:22] Peter said wherefore laying aside all
[1:35:24] malice
[1:35:26] lay aside all g guile hypocrisies envies
[1:35:30] all evil. Lay it aside. Just make a
[1:35:33] decision. I'm not going to have that
[1:35:36] anymore in my life. Lay it aside. It's
[1:35:38] time to grow. It's high time to awake
[1:35:41] out of our sleep. The bridegroom is
[1:35:43] coming. He is coming as newborn babes
[1:35:47] desiring the sincere milk of the word
[1:35:49] that we may grow by. In other words,
[1:35:51] literally come to church with no other
[1:35:54] thing than a hunger.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; I know I got a responsibility and I come
[1:35:58] here. I got to pray for my brothers and
[1:36:00] sisters. I understand that
[1:36:02] some of us have have jobs here, but many
[1:36:06] of us don't.
[1:36:08] And I think it should we should come
[1:36:10] here with a literal hunger for God.
[1:36:14] Like I want to get something out of this
[1:36:16] that's going to make my personal life
[1:36:18] better.
[1:36:20] That's going to help me overcome trials
[1:36:23] better.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; That's going to lead me to such a a a
[1:36:28] joy in the middle of of sorrow of of of
[1:36:32] of of tri trials and tribulations.
[1:36:36] Let's make more time to personally eat
[1:36:38] the bread.
[1:36:40] Jesus said, "I am the bread of life.
[1:36:44] Eat it until it becomes real, until it
[1:36:47] becomes life and joy and peace and all
[1:36:49] the things that you wish you had." You
[1:36:51] know, a lot of times we want things
[1:36:53] better in our home, but we're not doing
[1:36:54] anything to make them better.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; We want things better in our marriage,
[1:36:58] but we don't do nothing to make them
[1:36:59] better.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; We want things better in the church. We
[1:37:02] want a better preacher.
[1:37:06] What are we doing about it?
[1:37:09] Let's spend some time praying.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Eat on the word.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Let it become real. Eat the son of God
[1:37:18] until we manifest the son of God.
[1:37:21] Brother Brandham said in the message,
[1:37:22] thirsting for life. We're closing. He
[1:37:26] says, "Now listen, I know the Lutheran
[1:37:28] said the just shall live by faith." All
[1:37:31] right. There's a many of them started
[1:37:33] out that they that wasn't that that
[1:37:37] wasn't just
[1:37:40] Methodist said, "Brethren, when you
[1:37:43] shout, you got it." He said, "Many of
[1:37:45] many of them shouted, but they didn't
[1:37:46] have it." The Pentecost also said, "When
[1:37:49] you speak in tongues, you've got it."
[1:37:51] Thousands speak with tongues and having
[1:37:54] got it. The life proves they they've got
[1:37:58] it. the life, the fruit of the life.
[1:38:03] So, brother, this is a he's talking
[1:38:05] about the atmosphere that he's feeling
[1:38:07] in the church. And this here is so
[1:38:09] profound to me, and I just wanted to
[1:38:11] share it because I hope it's a blessing
[1:38:13] to you. He said, "A real sweet feeling
[1:38:16] in your heart
[1:38:18] knowing that you've passed from death
[1:38:20] unto life
[1:38:22] and you're at peace with God,
[1:38:25] a real tender heart that feeds on the
[1:38:27] things of God than to have all
[1:38:32] the" And he stops. He says, "Now
[1:38:34] remember, I believe in shouting. I
[1:38:36] believe in speaking with tongues. I
[1:38:39] believe in everything that God said. I
[1:38:42] believe in every miracle, every sign,
[1:38:44] but I would rather have this
[1:38:49] than all the rest of it put together.
[1:38:53] Wouldn't you rather have it? I'd rather
[1:38:56] have that real sweet, mellow Holy Spirit
[1:38:59] moving in my life
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; and making all the world pass away than
[1:39:04] to have all the noise.
[1:39:10] I don't know what it is, but it just
[1:39:12] seems like people want to make a show. I
[1:39:14] don't get it. I don't get it.
[1:39:19] Now, so I believe in shouting. Sure. I I
[1:39:21] shout and I scream myself. That's right.
[1:39:24] I believe in every gift.
[1:39:26] I wouldn't be here preaching healing. I
[1:39:29] believe in all those things. Notice
[1:39:32] this. This This is the prophet who's had
[1:39:34] the gift of discernment and healing. And
[1:39:36] he's saying this. He says, "But brother,
[1:39:38] that isn't it. That's not it. These
[1:39:40] gifts and signs, that's not it. It's
[1:39:42] Christ in your heart. That's it. Then
[1:39:45] you'll stay. Then you'll stay." See,
[1:39:48] that's life. He says, "Then you'll
[1:39:49] stay." In other words, how many people
[1:39:51] say, "I did this. This happened to me in
[1:39:53] my life. You should see back then in my
[1:39:55] life. This happened." And where are they
[1:39:57] at today?
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; So, you know, and here's the prophet
[1:40:00] telling us ahead of time, that's not it.
[1:40:03] Don't look at that.
[1:40:05] It's when the Holy Spirit is abiding
[1:40:07] inside and the life remains inside
[1:40:12] because the life never left the ark of
[1:40:14] the covenant. The life of God should
[1:40:16] never be leaving us.
[1:40:19] It should be abiding in us. Amen. Let's
[1:40:22] stand together. God bless you. Let's
[1:40:25] purpose in our heart to spend more time
[1:40:26] eating Christ, the word. It's the true
[1:40:30] believer's appetite.
[1:40:39] Come and dine. The master call it come
[1:40:41] and dine.
[1:40:45] He's calling us to eat the word of God.
[1:40:53] Let's sing that.

[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm thankful
[1:44:27] that I still have a desire for more of
[1:44:29] God.
[1:44:30] I'm
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; thankful for that. There's part of God
[1:44:34] that I have not experienced
[1:44:38] and I'm I'm thankful that he placed a
[1:44:40] calling inside
[1:44:43] for more of him
[1:44:45] um as the deer as the deer man.

[1:50:47] Amen.
[1:50:49] What a purpose to live to bring glory
[1:50:52] and honor to God with our lives. Amen.
[1:50:56] Amen. Now, I'm going to ask a question
[1:50:59] here and I don't want you to raise your
[1:51:01] hand until
[1:51:03] um you understand that I'm going to ask
[1:51:06] you to do something.
[1:51:09] So, you may not want to raise your hand,
[1:51:12] but I wonder if there's someone here
[1:51:14] today
[1:51:17] that you want.
[1:51:21] You not only want more of the Holy
[1:51:23] Ghost,
[1:51:26] but
[1:51:28] you're going to set your heart
[1:51:32] to seek more Holy Ghost.
[1:51:34] I just want you to raise your hand.
[1:51:37] Amen. Amen. Well, there's too many
[1:51:41] hands. I was going to all have you come
[1:51:42] forward,
[1:51:44] but I just if we could just believe for
[1:51:46] one another.
[1:51:48] Um, that's how the prophet taught us to
[1:51:50] pray one for another. And sometimes we
[1:51:54] can have more faith for one another than
[1:51:56] we can ourselves. But I I don't I
[1:51:58] believe if we all pray one for another,
[1:52:01] I believe every one of us is is
[1:52:04] somebody's going to be praying for us.
[1:52:07] Amen. And I just believe that's just how
[1:52:08] God works. Let's pray together. Our
[1:52:11] heavenly father, Lord, we thank you,
[1:52:14] Lord, for you. Where would we be without
[1:52:18] your saving grace in our life? Where
[1:52:20] would we be without you loving us when
[1:52:23] we were in our sins? And we didn't even
[1:52:26] think about you, care about you. But
[1:52:28] Lord, you made yourself known to us. And
[1:52:31] you loved us when we were yet without
[1:52:34] you. And now you've brought us onto
[1:52:36] yourself, Lord. Now you have come into
[1:52:39] our lives and you have touched our lives
[1:52:42] and your spirit, Lord, lives inside of
[1:52:45] us. But Lord, we have recognized just by
[1:52:47] the the lifting of our hands that there
[1:52:50] is more of your Holy Spirit that we're
[1:52:53] hungering for, that we're desiring in
[1:52:56] our very life, Lord. And I pray for
[1:53:00] every hand and every mind and every
[1:53:04] heart and every spirit and every soul
[1:53:08] today, Lord, who's who's uh given their
[1:53:11] themselves over to the word of God
[1:53:13] today, has lifted their hands and
[1:53:16] saying, "God, I I want more of your
[1:53:18] spirit in my life." They want to make a
[1:53:21] this covenant so rich and so beautiful.
[1:53:24] and they they they they want uh their
[1:53:27] their life never to wither. The they
[1:53:29] want the fruit of the Holy Ghost. They
[1:53:31] want whatever they're doing to prosper.
[1:53:33] And Lord, I pray for each heart here
[1:53:35] today. May there not be a one that is
[1:53:38] not blessed from the receiving of the
[1:53:40] word of God today. It is your word,
[1:53:42] Lord. That when we receive your word
[1:53:44] that we become your word automatically.
[1:53:47] It just happens when we receive your
[1:53:49] word into our heart. For your word is a
[1:53:52] living word and it brings forth life
[1:53:54] inside of us Lord. May it bypass Lord
[1:53:57] just our our go from our ears into our
[1:54:00] mind and just drop down into our heart
[1:54:02] and may it become so real Lord that we

[1:56:20] to a land where joy shall never end.
[1:56:25] I'll
[1:56:27] fly away.
