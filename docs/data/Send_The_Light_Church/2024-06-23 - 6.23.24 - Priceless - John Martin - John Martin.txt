with you here in the room but when I do that I I kind of feel like I'm not doing my best to prepare myself and I just appreciate you building the atmosphere of faith that this word can become alive inside each of us amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of we're going to have two scripture readings one is in Matthew Chapter 13 and then the second is in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 how many's how many uh likes the temperature right now everybody happy not too hot not too cold I I don't want to hear that you're a lukewarm Church watch you on fire amen let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer father we thank you that we could come into your house today to worship you to honor you to lift your name up and to give you thanks for saving us Lord for calling us from a a world of sin and and placing us in a position Lord that we know who we belong to and that we are Eternal creatures that we have a home Beyond this place called Earth father we ask that you would come this morning in a very intimate way to each and every one of our hearts Lord that we might hear from you we might be drawn closer to you and Lord that we could be strengthened by the holy spirit this morning we commit this service in your hands and Lord we're resting solemnly that you just bless your word give us Revelation as we look into it give you the praise for all these things we pray now in Jesus Christ's name amen Matthew Chapter 13 starting with verse number 45 two verses there uh this is scoffield calls this the sixth mystery of the Pearl and again the the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls and when he had when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it amen amen and then First Corinthians chapters 6 uh verse 19 and 20 what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own for you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are Gods amen God bless you you may be seated may the Lord just bless us this morning uh I just want to share a little bit a tidbit how many wants to know just know a little bit something about your pastor all right it's always nice to know something personal about your pastor God bless this young man here we we welcome you may God bless you this morning well this this morning I happen to be looking in the mirror and you know when you look at your body it's so at least mine is so imperfect so I I just I had to get one of those scales out brother Bruce I happen to have us one of those in in in the in the house and I was measuring my ears and and I noticed not just by sight but I took a scale and I made sure that what I was seeing is correct and I I actually my one ear is bigger than the other ear I and uh definitely imperfect this body is imperfect amen but God purchased all of us amen not just our soul but he he purchased our spirit and our bodies and even though our bodies don't inherit the Kingdom of Heaven God still purchased it and and he wants to use it on a temporary basis amen first Thessalonians tells us that and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless until the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen this morning as we're listening to God's word the word can actually discern or aunder the the soul and the spirit that's inside of us right amen just like the word can discern the very thoughts and intents of our heart amen this morning we want to talk about our our worth what our our worth is amen the Bible says that we're bought with a price everything has a value when you go to garage sales you look at what you think would be a good deal that you could use when you're hunting for a house you're you're looking for a good deal when last week we bought a car and of course you you don't want to spend too much money on a car you want to spend what you think would be a good deal many of us have been on Facebook Marketplace looking for a good deal amen the company I work for they manufact your custom tools and and parts in each job when it's quoted it takes so much time to do that job and our time is valuable uh because we have to pay of the employees and the expenses and and so each job has a certain amount that we would bid to get that job and if if if if if we we just can't do the the job for uh it takes eight hours to do and you just can't do it for $2 right you you would you wouldn't be a to get anywhere amen let's say your AC goes out at your home and you want to replace it because it's pretty hot out am and you get a quote for $46,500 are you going to replace that AC unit for that price no way Jose because the quoted value is higher than what you think it's worth now let's say your family is expanding you want to buy a new home gated in a gated community it's got the swimming pool it's all blocked in it's real nice and it's just a newer home and and and and they this the going price is the same 46 $1,500 now are you going to want to buy that uh yeah a couple of those because you you the value of that is is such a good price for you it's worth it to you amen Jesus is that Merchant man amen seeking goodly pearls that's you amen now when he found you and I'll say you as the whole because he's not going to one is not going to be left behind he sold all that he had and he bought it and you are bought with a price everything has some kind of value your body does your spirit does your soul does Amen now we're taught that if your body weighed 150 pounds and you combined the value of all the uh elements there in inside uh that you would be worth at one time about 84 cents your body that's the value of your body brother Bram said in the message separation from unbelief he says but that soul brother that's in there tonight in the front of God is worth 10 million worlds true amen 10 million worlds that's right now you take care of that 84 cents yeah but you'll just let anything come into that Soul amen he said let's be sensible brother let's really serve the Lord amen now brother brand made mention of 10,000 worlds it's 10 10 million worlds what he's trying to do is put a something out there that is unconceivable man hard to imagine the value it's so far out there so he makes the statement he's really not saying it's worth that right are you with me amen Jesus taught that our soul is more valuable than our body if you want to turn to Matthew chapter 10 or up on this screen verse number 27 says what I tell you in darkness that speak in the light amen and what you hear in the air that preach ye upon the housetops Amen in fear not them which kill the body now that word fear means reverence don't don't reverence them that which are which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul that's right that ought to make us Fearless right there amen but rather reverence him that is able to destroy both soul and Body in hell so he's separating the the the the different part of us and and he's he's telling us to reverence one but not the other the one that has control of the Soul we all got a soul and that's why we're here today is to get our soul more like the nature of God amen amen verse 29 are not Two Sparrows sold for a farling and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear ye not therefore ye are more valuable than many sparrows now notice he didn't say all the sparrows he just said many of them so is he is he talking about my soul what's the comparison here wherefore okay whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him I confess before my Father which is in heaven so he goes right back to verse 27 that what I tell you speak it but whosoever shall deny me before men him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven Matthew 16 we just trying to show the different the the the the the different values here verse Matthew 16: 26 for what is a man profited if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul Jesus is asking us to put an actual price tag on our soul right amen and the body could have everything in this world and the Soul could still be lost so what shall a man give in exchange for his soul think about this world there people go to church and they don't even think about their soul right they're wanting something that makes them feel good but Jesus could not value your soul worth one world what shall you give in exchange for his soul he could not say it was worth one world how about two how about three or four a thousand or 10,000 or 10 million you cannot compare something natural with something that has a chance of Eternity amen right and that's what every human being has he has a chance of Eternity of course the soul that doesn't get converted now that doesn't get born again cannot enter the kingdom of God that's right right so it has to be converted it has to be changed and and and souls are going to perish right many many go in there at Jesus said few be that find it so more people do not get converted than ever do get converted amen right now our soul that is priceless it lives in a a body that's not worth very much look at the kings in the past celebrities movie stars we hear people dying all the time athletes musicians great men that have had Great accomplishments but when it was over it's over right it's really over so how can we how can we compare this world to Eternity Psalms chapter 90 if You' like to turn there Psalms chapter 90 starting with verse number n are you getting something out of this all right for all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend our years as a tale that is told so you just think of somebody that's gone on and you could just tell the tale of the years that they've had the days of our years are three score and 10 70 right but if by reason of strength they be 80 years yet is their strength and labor sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away amen praise the Lord amen our bodies stay here from where they came but our souls leave amen who knoweth the power of thine anger even according to thy fear so is thy wrath God wants us to reverence him amen so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom amen we only got so many days many don't make it to 70 amen I don't have a we don't have a we don't know if we're going to wake up we don't even know if we're going to meet here next week it's by the grace of God so we need to take take this soberly James said that our life is but a vapor or smoke it it appears for a while and then it's gone we've all seen a vapor how it just is there and then it's not there anymore amen right we only have so much time to get our soul completely converted or if I could say it like this to those who feel it's already completely converted we've only got so much time to get our nature completely changed am and it's a work in process right because God is coming for a bride without spot a wrinkle now if if our nature did need to be changed then look all we need to do is just Lord I accept what you did at Calvary and I don't need to worry about my nature change but we do we do need that that because that's part of the that's part of the process amen first Peter chap 1 verse 23 I hope it's okay just going through these scriptures kind of quick being born again not of corruptible seed but incorrupt Able by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever for All Flesh is as grass our body right is as the grass and the glory of man as the flower of that grass so just think of all these people that had done great things or that you uh got records and sports and the grass withth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the go goel is preached on to you the only thing that's going to last is the word of God that's inside our soul amen if that doesn't happen it don't matter what we achieve in this life it doesn't matter what we do it'll Veil to nothing that's right people can really get mixed up on the value of things like how much they're really worth or how much others are worth you know some people wouldn't give a Wooden Nickel for somebody body or how much Jesus is worth some just swear take his name in vain there are those who thought the life of Jesus was worth 30 pieces of silver that's right some thought a thief and a robber was more valuable than Jesus people can really get mixed up on the on what things are are valued at or like taking up an offering in Mark 12: 41 and Jesus sat over against the treasury and be behold how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were Rich cast Rich cast in much so just so you know we want to follow this scripture today we want to talk about this one know and there came a certain poor Widow and she threw in two mites which make up a farling and he called unto his disciples you know he's always teaching called unto his disciples and he saith unto them verily I say unto you that this poor wiow have cast more in than all they that have cast into the treasury and they're thinking how can this be I mean I got a calculator I know how to add but see God is looking at the value of the antenna of the heart and he says for all they did cast of their abundance it's what they had that they I got this to give today so I'm going to give today but she of her want in other words I do not want to put this in right but I'm going to yes sir she cast in all that she had you talk about being able to trust God that much even all her living I'm so glad that God sees everything amen amen sees everything and and if we could just have if we could look through the eyes of God and see things the way that he sees them I think there'd be a lot less drama in our life don't you amen now Satan has got gotten many people to devalue the church in this age they've they've kicked out Jesus out of the church and he's actually standing on the outside of the door of Freemore agency knocking and and asking if he could come in and S with people because the people that are the head of the church don't put allow the Holy Ghost to be behind the pit am because if they did there wouldn't be very many people in the church right I mean look at even his own disciples left him when he began to preach the strong word of God now Moses was just an Avenue for the people to get out of the claws of pharaoh they were happy they rejoiced when they when they they left Egypt but after that they didn't want to listen to this man they wanted to get a different leader right amen the prophet in this age was just an Avenue for some people to get out of the Clause of denominations like they got this great Revelation about how bad the denominations and I'm so glad that we I'm in a message now that just believes that you know to come out of her and I did that I'll tell you when I was in the denomination I knew something was wrong with it right amen and I think God is not just calling us out but he's calling us in into a relationship with him into the the promised land of a nature change there's more for us Church ought to be respected amen a place where God speaks not man not all that's just brother John you know how he is right well we know how he is the but do we know really how God is that's why Jesus said he that has ears to hear Let Him hear what the spirit is saying amen it's a good prayer to pray God give me ears today that's a good prayer to pray Satan has devalued the church he's brought disrespect right into the sanctuary talking joking entertainment pass the coffee you've you've been into these churches where they have just about everything defiled the sanctuary with iniquities no reverence people can't endure sound Doctrine anymore they don't want that they want something that doesn't hurt them they want a certain type of ministry rather than I just want to hear from God I don't care what I don't care how it feels I just want to hear from God Amen there's a famine in the land for the hearing of the word amen that's true brother bam said this is where we come and we let the word of God discern our heart and tell us where we're really standing with him yes now a proud person says I don't need that I know where I'm standing with God that's that is a person who thinks they know their heart where the scripture tells us we don't know our heart we have to allow God to speak and and see if our our heart becomes our conscience becomes tender uh be becomes uh open and and and tender to where God can speak to it and say yes that's true because it's going to be a a still Small Voice it's not always going to be some rocket thing and we have some um something happen out here that makes your eyes go real big right right know it's about a real genuine relationship and and we go we we we leave church and we go and we spend every day out there doing what we want to do and and and and and to this is a place that is truly the place that we hear from God we don't hear from man now if you're hearing from man you're in a place of carnality Amen I'm just going to say it you know flesh is contacting flesh and and it's got to be the inside contacting God right it just got to be Satan's goal is to de to devalue us he not only wants to devalue the church in the ministry but he wants to devalue us he wants to make us feel like our soul is only worth 84 cents like it's not worth trying to get the Holy Ghost come on like it's not worth trying to to go up to the Altar and get closer to God Amen it's not worth spending extra time in prayer it's not worth living for others right devaluing who we are amen how many times is the devil lied to you try to make you feel like you weren't worth anything come on Amen how many times you felt nobody just tells me they appreciate me come on I like the story that was told about the Old Violin there is an estate sale going on and you have been to estate sales and auctions where they're auctioning off things and well there was one going on and there were things that were being sold some were pretty good priced and some was a bunch of junk it wasn't going for very much and one of the items that came on to be bided was an Old Violin and the auctioneer just said who'll give me $35 and I tell you from the look of it it was all dusty it just didn't look one of the strings was hanging it just didn't look very good nobody bit on it he said 25 and he said 10 he said who will start the bid off for five and nobody nobody bit on it the auctioneer said it was made by a 21 year old boy back during World War II when money was scarce and his name was Jack jock Francis and nobody had heard of the lad and it just sounded absolutely horrible when he strung it trying to get the attention of the people someone in the midst of them stood up went up to the front grabbed the Old Violin dusted it off said just a minute here I see something here and he put the string back on he tuned it up real quick and he began to play Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound and the whole audience got in in awe of what was really happening that such a beautiful uh tune uh music could come forth from an in instrument that just didn't look like it was worth anything and then he said uh who give me 100 and then 200 and 300 and before you know it the the thing was selling for thousands of dollars all because there was now an awareness by the people of the value of that violin am it was the same violin right what changed was how it was viewed and Satan's job is to try to get us to look at our lives is not valuable right amen because we place so much emphasis on on how others communicate with us and talk to us and the thoughts that we think and we need to know who we are we need to know who we belong to and that never changes but this one violin it was from Paris France it was made during the Nazi occupation of Paris and the bridge was stamped with his name jock Francis the artwork on the back by an artist of a Margaret depicting Christ and Mary Magdalene and today if you would go on Google you would find out that you can buy that same violin for $95 $5,000 wow God saw your value way before you were born amen God it was during the devil's occupation here on Earth right amen but I'll tell you on your Bridge he stamped the blood of Jesus Christ he has provided away every time we come to church to really hear the voice of God speaking to us personally our souls are Priceless in the sight of God today amen that's right God knows what it's like to be separated from him eternally we down here people down here don't think about that they they don't spend time thinking about what happens after death what happens when I die because if we take time to think of that thought we may Recon consider our what we do down here right Calvary is what makes our soul value Priceless amen it's Calvary it's because he saved it not All Souls are going to be saved so what is the value of a soul that's in Hell eternally separated from God it's the life of God's blood coming inside of US changing our nature that's what makes it Priceless amen and now God knows that our soul even when it's not converted if it belongs to him if it's part of that great pearl of great price if it's part of that whole Pearl it's just as Priceless in an unconverted State as it is when it's converted but I'll say this to you you can't rest going on the other side without being converted because then you're you're just proving that you were not part of that great price amen you've got to get converted you've got to get serious about getting a nature [Music] change God bought you you were his from the beginning and then you got lost you got lost you really got stolen from the devil amen but God bought you back amen amen that's right you're bought with a price all we have to do now is believe the word of God enough to follow it to obey it right that's what brings about a change nature turn with me to First Peter chapter 1 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 13 and if you want if you get tired you can just stand up shake yourself I know some of you are working in that heat 1 Peter chapter 1:3 wherefore G up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children now not fashion yourselves according to your formal desires and lust and your ignorance but as he which have called you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner of way that you conduct yourself that's right because it is written for is Holy for I am Holy for if ye call on the father who without respect to P persons judgeth according to Every Man's work past the time of your sojourning here in fear for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things amen as silver and gold from your vain conversations received by the tradition of all the denominations that you came from right but with the precious blood of Christ amen as of a lamb without blemish without spot the Precious Blood of the Lamb think about this there there is nothing greater in the existence of the whole universe right nothing is more valuable than God's own son that was per perfect that he died that blood the value of that blood he placed as great as us when we were dead in our sins think about that the value of us being saved is the same as the value of the blood of the Son of God Amen I'll tell you that's pretty Priceless am Amen to me that's priceless who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God that raised him from the dead and gave him glory that your Faith and Hope might be in God God valued you the same as his only begotten son God exchanged himself for you think about that you're not just a uh something that set aside separated from God like this is separated but we are a part of God Amen we are just as much part of God as God is amen amen I would say we're Priceless amen amen I would say we're Priceless seeing he have purified your souls and obeying the truth that's how you do it through the spirit unto UNF loved of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently in other words get rid of the hypocrisy get rid of the the the respect to Persons get rid of all that get filled with the love of God being born again there it is not of corruptible seed but in corruptible by the word of God Amen second Peter or 1 Peter chapter 2 I believe that we are Priceless in the sight of God Amen I think we need to view one another the same way amen we're really do 1 Peter chapter 2 vers1 wherefore laying aside all Mals all Gile all hypocrisies all enviance and all evil speaking can you say Amen to that amen let's just make a commitment I'm got to lay it aside not well wait wait till I feel better just lay it aside as newborn babes desire the sinere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as Lively SES dis disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious there you go there you go see the see men are not going to Value you they're not going to uh place you in in a very good spot you know if you can't give them a if you can't benefit them they're going to put you aside right it's the TR truth amen but not God he's chosen you ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ boy that's a responsibility right there wherefore also is contained in the scriptures behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect and precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded oh God is is is elect he's precious he's the Chief Cornerstone he is the Capstone amen but we're a part of him the word of God a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them that stumble at the word there are people who can't take the word they're going to stumble it's going to be offensive to them yeah because why because they're disobedient amen where un to they also they were appointed but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of them called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in times past were not a people but now are the people of God which have which not uh obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy many are called but few are chosen amen many people but only few Are Holy only few are chosen only few are peculiar only few are Priceless I believe this scripture is referring to you are you priceless amen amen amen so if you're Priceless it does not matter what that's right the word is preached it doesn't matter what anybody says it doesn't matter how you feel it doesn't matter what the devil says right it doesn't matter when the Lord corrects how he corrects why because you're Priceless amen your feeling should not dictate to you your value that's right amen that's right we are not carnal people that have to be feeling like we're worth something we by Revelation know what we're worth amen that's it amen look if I got to if I can talk you into feeling your Priceless that means somebody that's can come by and talk you out of it we're Priceless and I'll say it like this we hold our value we hold our value it don't depreciate it doesn't go the other way you know you buy a car you drive it off the lot wait a week see go go to try to sell it back don't even drive it you lose but you don't lose your value doesn't matter who looks down on you doesn't matter how how they belittle you when you're feeling like you're getting picked on I want you to remember the donkey story there was this old farmer and you know what his donkey had come to the point in his life where he just wasn't worth anything anymore and he was just going to bury him CU he was just too much of a pain and so he had this one well that was all dried up and couldn't be used anymore for drawing water so he just took that old donkey and he threw him in the well and he began to take this dirt and just one by one start filling up the well and the dirt hit the donkey's back and you know the donkey had been so good to his master all these years uh lifted many burdens for the old farmer plowed many Gardens and he was down there feeling like he just wasn't worth anything kind of like feeling used you ever been you ever felt like you were used before that's exactly how this old donkey was feeling just used no respect so this is dirt was hitting him he was just thinking what am I going to do this must is this is this going to be my end is it true that this is this is what I really am I'm just not worth anything and then something on the inside of of them said no I am worth something I am valuable amen and when that dirt hit his back that old donkey just brushed his back like this and the dirt fell out and he stepped right up a little higher and that just kept happened until he reached to the very top and was able to walk over and get back on the ground now I'll tell you that's the way that we need to believe who we are it don't matter what Satan tells us amen look Satan comes to church too amen he's trying to keep you from believing the word of God for your life and sure your flesh is just like my flesh that doesn't want to Humble itself and and to follow the word that's a true statement but you know we're not here to build our flesh amen we're here because we're Sons and Daughters of God we're Priceless in the sight of God and we're going to be Overcomers whatever's thrown at us that's right I'm sure you've heard the the story about the slave that came to America and uh he was he was different than all the other slaves and there was actually other slave owners that envied not having this guy this man this slave and and so they they would go to the the owner of the slave and they said we would like to buy this slave from you we'll give you double what you paid for him and the slave owner would tell him he's not for sale that's right he's not for sale we we purchased them he's here he's staying with us and uh and and so they began to ask questions because this man when he was out on the field he worked like nobody else right you know the Bible talks about working with eye service in other words you work as long as the boss is look at but when the boss ain't looking then it doesn't matter but that slave wasn't like this this slave he he always carried himself in such a way that he didn't let things get him down he kept on working at all cost and he worked harder than the others and so they asked him why is he like this do you feed them something different do you give them more breaks do you give them easier jobs do you give them benefits after work and no no no none of that but I'll tell you I what I was wondering the same thing when we were first learning about it and we learned that where he comes from he is his dad his father is a king over in the land that he comes from am and they're taught to conduct themselves just like a son of a king amen and so when he came here he didn't say well things are different I guess it's hopeless now I'm in a different situation there's no way no he knew who he was amen and he conducted himself like a son of a king amen amen now believe we that are Priceless no matter what we're going through we ought to La act like we're Children of the king amen amen we hold our value and if you keep your value let me just say this you'll keep living for others right but if you don't keep your value all of a sudden you'll start living for yourself right eternal life is living for others eternal life is not doing things for others it's not doing things for people right it's actually living for somebody's Soul am to get either somebody to Christ or to get somebody closer to Christ amen that's what eternal life is because you're you're already Priceless you already got everything you want because you got Christ you got joy you got peace you got everything you could possibly want there is nothing more that you want if you never get another thing you're still living for others [Music] amen Deuteronomy 7:6 says for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God have chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all the people that are upon the face of the earth now that's pretty special the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than uh any of the people but ye were fewest of all people but because the Lord loved you we just can't even I cannot fathom that love I can't wrap my head around it I it's it's like Priceless to me just like 10,000 worlds I can't understand the value of my soul converted it's going to take eternity to keep unfolding for me to understand amen Jeremiah 31:3 I want you to write this down Jeremiah 31:3 the Lord have appeared of old unto me saying yay I have loved thee with an Everlasting Love Therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee now catch this Everlasting Love Priceless we hold our value we hold our value God is not exchanging his love he's not withdrawing his love his loving kindness draws us to him it is the goodness of God that leads man to repentance amen we're Priceless I remember telling my son 30 years ago when he was just a boy every night before he'd go to bed when I tuck him in I'd say I love you bigger than this whole world He's 33 years old now but I haven't stopped telling him amen I tell them at least six out of seven days a week at least and I'll say one of those at one of those days I'm telling them I still love him bigger than this whole world yay I have love thee with an Everlasting Love Therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee we know the scripture in Romans 8 I'm just going to quote it quick I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God Amen in everlasting love amen John said beloved what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us we're Priceless we hold our value the Bible says it doth not yet appear but we know that when he appears we're going to be just like him think about that just like him amen that's priceless amen priceless Psalms 139:13 Psalms 139:13 for thou H has possessed my rins thou has covered me in my mother's womb and I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well I one place I remember brother B saying that the natural birth is more of a mystery than the than this than the than the the the spiritual birth of of of of the Son of God he's we're protected God makes sure that you know when we're born we're going to make it amen that's why we're here today my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them when as yet there was none of them how precious are the thoughts are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of themen Priceless amen Priceless for I know the thoughts I think toward you thoughts of Peace he wants to give us an expected in am the sum of God's thoughts we're Priceless we hold our value regardless of what we're going through well I'm having a bad day what do you want me to do what do you want me to do like you're the only one that has bad days that's right how many I just want to say who in here doesn't have a bad day raise your hand that's right well my day is is harder than your day oh it is it is it is I see I know this I know this I'm not going to debate whether your day is harder than my day right but I will debate with you you that God will never put anything on you that you can't bear because our God is faithful amen amen God is able Ephesians 2 time is is getting getting away from it Ephesians 2 vers1 and and you Havey quickened who were dead and traspasses and sins so you were Priceless when you were dead in your trespass passes and sins but notice he didn't just forgive you of your trespasses and your sins what did he do he quickened you he changed you right he made you different than what you were before amen where in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we've all had our conversations in times past and the lust of the fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the Mind were by Nature the children of if you don't give me what I want I'm going to get mad at you but God we don't do that anymore though do we no but God who is rich in Mercy amen for his great love where with he loved us amen even when we are dner sins have quickened us together in Christ have raised us up together made us to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Priceless the very fact that we're here today and we didn't get S back in the world with so many right ought to show you how valuable you are am you can take it you can take the furnace Isaiah 43 this is going going to be one of our last scriptures here Isaiah 43:1 but now thus sayith the Lord the that created thee oh Jacob and he that formed thee oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy name and thou art mine when thou passest through the water I will be with thee through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire Thou shalt not burn neither shall the flame Kindle under upon thee for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopia and siba for thee since thou was precious in my sight thou has been honorable I have love thee therefore will I give men for thee and people for thy life amen isn't that powerful so here's another version of that verse says you are Priceless to me I have loved you and I honor you so I will trade other people for you and I will give up other nations to save your lives we are Priceless amen we are absolutely priceless in the sight of God know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and you are not your own you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are God's we cannot truly conceive the value of how much we we're worth but I'll say it like this it's beyond our comprehension amen one thing we can say that we are truly Priceless amen and we hold our value God is going to see us through and we're going to be just like him when he returns God values us as much as himself I'll say that just pray for that Revelation because if you get a true revelation of that you're you're not going to be discouraged amen amen you need something to hold you amen amen one day a young boy asked his father what the value of his life was instead of answering the father told him he just just picked up a rock he said take this rock and go to the market and if anybody asks you the price of of of the rock uh you just hold up two fingers but don't say a thing so he went to the market with this rock and uh some lady said how much is that that rock I I would like to buy that rock I'd like to put it in my garden and the the little boy just did what his dad said he just raised two fingers he said $2 I'll take it I'll take it so the boy just went home with The Rock and he told his father when I went to the market a woman said he give $2 for this stone that you this rock that you just picked up the father said now I want you to take that same Rock and I want you to go to a museum and I just want you to go in the museum and when you see the the the owner there CU he'll come to you you're just stand there with a rock and if he asks you how much that rock is you just you just hold up two fingers but don't say a thing and so he goes to the museum and he walks in there and he's just staying there and he waits for the owner to come and he says wow look at that that that that rock it is it is it looks so valuable uh h i I I'll I want to buy that for you and I want to put it in the museum and he said how much is it and he just holds up two fingers like this he says $200 I'll take it the boy just takes the Rock and he leaves he goes home and he tells his dad what happened at the Museum he says okay son I want you to go to one more place I want you to go to a precious stone store and when you go in there they're going to want to look at the Rock and they're going to ask you how much that rock is and you'll just do the same thing you don't say nothing you just raise two fingers just like this and so he went to the the the stone store and and there had many other uh precious stones in that store and so uh the owner came up and he said this is magnificent I've never seen anything like this I want to add this thing is valuable I want to buy this and put it with my collection how much is it worth and the boy just hold up two fingers and he said 200 $1,000 I'll take it the boy went home and he told his dad what happened and he said son you know the value of your life no see it doesn't matter what anybody else says it doesn't matter who what family you came from it doesn't matter to the color of your skin it doesn't matter if you were born with the Rich it it it it doesn't matter none of that matters what matters is how do you value yourself who are you going to hang out with how are you going to carry yourself are you going to Value yourself as just something that's of less value or are you going to Value yourself is this [Music] word so I think it's silly that we sit here and we think about what we think others are worth right and we be affected by what other people say or think or what they don't say or what they don't think to me what matters is your conne ction to God it truly is when you're connected with God you feel Priceless you feel unworthy amen it I would say to you that kind of feel like you're not worth as much as you want to feel like you're worth stop doing what you're doing stop hanging out with who you're hanging out with start reading the Bible more yeah start listen listening to the tapes more start spending more time in prayer and get to know who you are because you're Priceless in the sight of god let's Stand Together amen you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood of peculiar people you're Priceless if you view yourself as Priceless then live for others amen let's sing that that uh chorus I'm a child of the king his Royal Blood now flows through my [Music] veins that's it that's the right one well we can catch it oh I wouldn't just do the the chorus unless Brother Bruce knows it ah no this is not

and say if you be the Son of God questioning his identity how much more will he come to us amen so we just got to quickly let him know where we stand let him know let's sing that um Shout to the Lord
