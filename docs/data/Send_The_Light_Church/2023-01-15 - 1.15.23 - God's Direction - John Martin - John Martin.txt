amen you may be seated um we want to just welcome Becky and Jordan thank you guys for coming we love seeing you guys and um they'll actually have a testimony for us they both have testimonies it's like just to invite them up here God bless you all I'm Jordan romberger I'm Kathleen romberger's nephew and we had a a nice ceremony yesterday for her I know she was a soldier in the church here and she inspired me many times just even coming here praying and she spent a lot of time at home also um I have a little story to tell just from when I was probably just about 10 years old so maybe 30 some years ago even back then she was just serving the lord faithfully and um even at that young age I remember her calling my sister Kayla and her two kids Steve and Emily up to the porch on my grandparents house up Northern Michigan at the time and she said the Lord just led me to pray with you and she just started praying in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and up till that point I had no memory of the physical presence of the Lord or the Holy Spirit move in but it was kind of like brother Branham described the Whirlwind but I didn't hear it it just could feel it moving and all of us were just crying and praising the Lord and her um praying while we were feeling this and I know all of us felt it and even at that young age just her obedience to the Lord in the moment has stuck with me for 40 years and 30 years and um so I just appreciate that and even I heard on her dying last day she was still asking her son and daughter you know are you saved and she's still just up until her last moments there um and of course we're still praying for that for their salvation and uh full obedience to the word um she has uh a card here on some of her favorite scriptures I just wanted to repeat one of them second Timothy 3 16-17 all scriptures inspired by God and profitable for teaching for reproof for correction for training and righteousness that the man of God may be adequate equipped for every good work I feel like she lived that and she was always reading her Bible and uh inspires me to dig in more because I know it's it's true [Applause] good morning it's really good to be here with you all um yesterday brother John asked if Jordan and I could sing and I was like we do praise the Lord but I'm I'm not sure that's our gift to the body um and then he said well what about a testimony and I I am into that there's always a reason to give a testimony so um I just thought you know we come maybe once or twice a year you don't maybe know there might there actually are new faces that I don't think I've seen you may not know a whole lot about us so I thought I'd just share a little bit of of my background um I grew up in a message church I'm so thankful for that my dad was the pastor there for uh over 40 years so I feel just so incredibly privileged to have had that start in the word but I would say I was probably junior senior year in high school when I really started feeling that thirst and hunger for the word and was so blessed to have some some uh a younger couple in the church that just took me in a good friend we met just week after week delving into the word and it just really ignited the fire in me and um again just feel so thankful and blessed that I never felt the pull of the world uh calling me away not that I haven't you know had a lot to overcome but you know my encouragement is to the young children is just just stay with it God will bless you he will bless your life and you know he can redeem anything I believe that I've seen it but if you can stay with the word you'll be blessed so we're still at my home church that I grew up in in Troy Ohio I'm very blessed and thankful that Jordan came my way and decided to stay I love being close to my family my church obviously is my family so we have a 15 year old son 13 year old daughter and an eight-year-old son they are all dispersed the two older ones are on a youth retreat with our church and Tate decided to go to church with his cousins Hannah and Huey this morning we also had our daughter Willow so I'm I know Kathleen had you you pray for us she died the day that she was born about 11 and a half years ago so I just Rejoice to know that Kathleen is there with her being able to tell her about her family and I I just feel like it really seems like God is calling some people home so that we have we have something more to look forward to maybe they're up there calling out to Jesus to come quickly for all of us and reunite us and I just wanted to share too just a little bit about what God's been doing in my life the last couple years I feel like I am just so blessed to see healing take place in my life not physically yes I've I've battled with asthma kind of my whole life and I've seen him deal with that and other things but really just on an emotional and a spiritual level he is healing my heart he has really given me the opportunity to learn how to live in the moment so not thinking about the past that's all under the blood good bad shame sorrow not worrying about the future because we don't know what it brings but to just be right here in this moment and just to have an openness to whatever it is believing that as I take a step forward he's going to be leading me I don't need to think about I don't need to think about the next words that come out of my mouth he's going to lead me and I just feel you know to see you know now now in thinking about Kathleen and her life and you know it's we just don't know what tomorrow is going to bring so I want to be where he is and that's right now and um he's just revealing that to me more and more that it's okay to pause it's okay to be silent it's okay to not worry to set that all down and so I'm here today and I'm grateful [Applause] thank you so much for those testimony I just love it uh you got to be present in the moment spiritual awareness is this the key God's always trying to move or move in our lives and we got to be able to recognize what he's doing at that present moment I love that spoke volumes um let's sing uh this is getting to worship as the deer hey [Music] [Music] you

of times how much he appreciated the support and I say God bless you for all your love and support for brother Marty and his family I know that's what sister Kathleen would want and just continuing to pray for them amen amen we appreciate those testimonies amen they were very very helpful for us amen God bless you turn with me if you would to the Book of Exodus chapter 14. I'm going to read one verse have you be seated and then we're going to go through these scriptures a little bit here um Exodus chapter 14 verse number 15. amen and we'll have a a word of prayer amen Exodus chapter 14 starting with one verse 15 and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore cry is thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward amen let's bow in a word of our heavenly father Lord there's been many sermons preached off of this verse here very well known to us all we pray Lord that your presence would come and open it up for this moment for this hour for the present for you are not a god of the past not a god of the future when you want to make yourself known you always want to be made known as the I am God the very present God lord you know the needs to be among us you know the needs of them that are with us through the live stream and we just pray that you would make these scriptures real to us and give us the what we have need of to help us in this journey we pray Lord that you would be with brother Marty and the family and the days to come may you keep them encouraged keep them strengthened and keep them moving forward Lord as Lord your entire bride until that morning Lord that you call us away father we commit ourself and ask your blessings now the remainder of the service in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated uh this morning um we received uh a text from a brother in Ohio and he sent a little picture and um I just want to put that on the board and and and this is what he sent me isn't that the cutest thing and it's it was a blessing but he wrote in the text with this Jesus said feed my sheep feed my Lambs feed my sheep go forward amen go forward and I thought well that's our opening text wherefore Christ thou unto me speaking to the children of Israel that they go forward I don't think it was a coincidence that it was sent I think it was the right timing I want to title this message God's Direction God's direction for a subject Faith forward Faith forward if we could just start back at the verse 1 and and it's a familiar story uh the children of Israel had come out of of Egypt and they were on their Journey the beginning of their Journey towards the promised land now remember that they had seen great Miracles already before they started the journey seen the plagues they've seen how God had moved in their behalf there was light in their Camp there wasn't what the other came up when all the others were battling stuff it seemed like God's hand was with the children of Israel so it wasn't like they didn't know God at all and the god that had revealed himself to them was a a God that was capable he was a capable God and so here let's just pick this up in verse number one the Lord was speaking to Moses saying speaking to the children of Israel that they turn and encamp before uh this place between May doll and the Sea and over against the Bell before it shall before it shall ye in Camp by the sea for pharaoh will say of the children of Israel so I just one other thing I want to say is that God is doing the direction here God is directing them amen and Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel they are in Tangled in the land in other words they're trapped the Wilderness have shut them in and I will harden Pharaoh's heart that he shall follow after them and I will be honored upon pharaoh and upon all his hosts and the Egyptians that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord and they did so now I never see this to just hear of late but God has other plans God had other plans than just to help the children of Israel get to the promised land okay God had plans to be honored with the enemy of Israel and all as it did was cause more problems for Israel more hurt more suffering more battle more fear to arise but God wanted it and what's so important about this is there's things going on Beyond us when we're going through our trials and God don't have to tell us about them God don't even have to get our okay but it will cause similar things that happen to the children of Israel God wanted their enemy to know who was really in control who holds the final say so who is the creator of the universe and who controls the forces of life children of Israel they just did not like being put in a corner all right with no way out the enemy coming after them and and they were dealing with thoughts that would have been better if we would have just sitting comfortable back in Egypt they didn't like being in that position none of us like being in a position of what am I going to do right now because of this but that's what faith is all about God's direction is always Faith forward amen we must always keep in mind that the things that happen around us aren't always what we expect God's ways are higher than our ways his thoughts are higher than our thoughts he's got things in mind and our confidence is not us figuring out how we're going to take care of our situation our confidence is that God's in control and the quicker we can get to that part get to that part then none of this what we're going through is going to matter when you whenever you got things figured out or you've got to figure things out you got to drop it as quick as possible Proverbs tells us be not wise in thine own eyes but trust in the Lord with all thine heart lean not to thy own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and what he shall direct thy path God was the one that led him in this direction they didn't make a mistake and go the wrong way right they were under the direction of God a lot of times God directs Us in paths that we don't want to go but this is not a walk of understanding it's a walk of faith it's not by sight it's not by reasonings not by our ability to figure things out if there's no faith involved don't expect God to be involved we can only please God by faith without it it's impossible I know we we have to use our mind in figuring things out down here we got a flat tire let's fix the tire we're out we we need a route of milk we go to the store we buy milk I mean we have a mind to figure things out to help us in this life but when it comes to God there's no figuring there's a trust there's a confidence that who that God is in control of our of our very being we are the Sheep of this pastor and he is leading the way he is the great Shepherd every man even the even the Bible says Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou Anonymous my head with oil my cup runneth over even though we don't want anything to do with Egypt or our enemy God does he makes it that here who's our greatest enemy ourselves right okay so he's prepared a table right for for our inner man right in the presence of this carnal nature that wants to bring us down and even though God is leading us to a promised land and we got so many hindrances God is going to use all things to work out the Bible says that he makes all things to work out according to his will amen amen and if he wants honor through our difficulties or situations or or even our enemy that we don't want to have anything to do with but God still wants honor then he deserves the honor that he wants it's not up to us to say we got to get away from this thing right God will take care of it amen we just got to walk forward yes sir yes sir keep marching forward God wants your enemy to see that God is in control of what blessing you if God God wants to bless you but he wants the enemy to see that and he wants to bring honor somehow through the difficulty and he knows exactly how to do it so we just again just trust him don't try to figure it out amen all right verse five and it was told the king of Egypt the people fled and the Heart of pharaoh and his servants turned against the people and they said why have we done this that we have let Israel go from serving us and he made ready his Chariot and took his people with him and he took 600 chosen chariots and all the Chariots of Egypt and captains over every one of them and the Lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued after the children of Israel and the children of Israel went out with a high hand now everyone in Israel at that moment they came out of Egypt if they all got together and said let's have a vote in a church okay what's the vote let's vote that the Egyptians do not come after us just to leave us alone and let us go serve God they would all voted that way so God outvoted them but think about this if the Egyptians wouldn't have came there'd be nothing written in history of how God destroyed the mighty Army of Egypt with by the Finger of God with a flood it would have never happened see you see so when we're wanting things to go a certain way God's got something else in mind and that's that's the beauty of trust you don't got to figure it out God knows what he's doing amen amen so when God hardens somebody's heart don't ask why did God do this don't do that it was to bring God honor somehow and sometimes we have to suffer more because God wants to see honor somewhere think about that no nobody wants to suffer but it's important that we're encouraged that God is in control to have a life without suffering you if we don't suffer with him we cannot reign with him if we deny him if we deny a god that is allowing suffering the Bible says he will deny us it's part of it but our encouragement comes that God is with us and he's building character Romans chapter 9 verse 7 says for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for the same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout the earth that is what God wanted but what did the children of Israel want I just bought these chains off of me I want to get out of here I want to be free from that God was wanting more God wants more than what's going on in our lives and he deserves it because he's God we we are his creation we're not equals if we can create anything it's because he spoke into us to create it because we can't do anything on our own he makes us join heirs amen verse 9 but the Egyptians pursued after them and all the horses and Chariots of pharaoh and his Horsemen his army and they overtook them and camped in camping by the Sea behind this place before this place see these places I don't know how to pronounce these places so that these are these places are you with me all right and when Pharaoh Drew Nye onto those places the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were so afraid and the children of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord I honestly think this would have been anybody's natural reaction I mean look what's happening just nobody wants to be in this kind of predicament but now let me ask you a question does God want you to do that when you when we run into a situation that we don't feel comfortable and out of control and something's happening and we're going to get hurt does God want us to be afraid okay so it is a natural thing to be afraid but yet we know it's not God's will for us to be afraid and they said unto Moses because look this is what happens if we stay in the flesh because there were no graves in Egypt has thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore has thou dealt with us to carry us forth out of Egypt it's not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians could have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness and Moses said unto the people fear not because it was fear that was speaking to them It Was Fear God has not given us a spirit of fear but Power love and a sound mind be fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show you this day for the Egyptians who you have seen today ye shall see again no more forever now this is kind of ironic here because he's saying stand still and two verses later he's saying go forward but the stand still is standing still in your heart Isaiah chapter 30 verse 15 says in quietness and confidence shall be your strength you stand still in your heart of of Faith you do not fear you do not worry you're you do not allow the enemy to get you out of your confidence with God that's right the Lord shall fight for you in verse 14 and ye shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward Oh What a Mighty word god orchestrates a difficulty almost unbearable no humanly way to fix this situation and he says go forward that's what our God does who saved us the god that we serve today he is the same yesterday today and forever he is still orchestrating things in our life that we don't like we don't feel comfortable it has nothing to do with our plans it doesn't seem like it's going to help us with any situation but it has to do with God and what he's trying to get accomplished in his realm America and who are we to say to God it had been better if this brother or this sister didn't say that to me it had been better you know if if this trial wouldn't have happened to me who are we to say that it'd be best for us to say Lord I'm Gonna Stand still and watch you save me out of this situation I'm going to stand still and see the hand of God he is the I am the present help in a time of trouble it gives a chance for God to get Glory through your attitude through your confidence to your steadfastness to your faith because without it you know God's still going to move forward you know if I don't praise him he'll get some rocks to do it if I don't stand in the midst of my trial and praise God he's going to get somebody else to do it there's no turning back with God forward he said go forward he's always moving forward and he has an expected end for each one of us and that expected end is forward it's always forward it's not sideways it's not take a back seat it's not you know let's withdraw and think this thing through it ain't nothing like that has nothing to do with our understanding it's always forward always forward we don't know what's in front we don't know what's behind our obstacle the obstacle is there yes God wanted honor but he also wanted his children to believe in him and they were at a place that they allowed fear to Encompass their life right the Bible tells us in First Peter chapter 4 we've all experienced this verse 12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trials which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened unto you now we have a Promised Land just like the children of Israel did and between this very second in our life as we're here in the church or live streaming this very second between now and that complete promised land for our lives is a our trials commitment and we've heard we're either in a trial coming out of a trial or getting ready to go into one so between now and the fullness of the manifestation of Christ in her life there are going to be trials yes we're going to be like him one day we have an expected end with him but between now and then there's going to be a lot of strange things that are happening but God doesn't want us to look at their strange things happening to us he wants us to learn from this set of scriptures to stand still and see the salvation of God he's wanting to get Glory somehow in this situation we don't know he just wants us to trust him that he's going to fight the battle he promised never to leave us never to forsake us he said I'll be with you even in you to the end the Bible says that we could have confidence that we can boldly say that God supplies our need amen the Bible says that be content with such things as you have I will never leave you I'll never forsake you that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper I will not fear what man shall do unto me don't fear but be bold speak be bold the Lord is my helper not you're going to take care of the situation not you're something special you're something smart you're something no but the Lord he's my helper I'm gonna exalt the Lord I'm gonna look to the hills from what's cometh my strength the Lord is my helper keeping that your testimony First Peter chapter 1 verse 4 2 in inheritance and this was ratted last yesterday in the um the memorial for sister Kathleen but I think a different maybe a different version of the Bible but the same uh here in Saint uh King James to an inheritance we have a Promised Land Incorruptible undefiled and that fateth not our way is reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time so we are kept by the power of God Amen see the the the the children of Israel facing the Red Sea they were kept by the power of God they did not turn around and say all right come on you Egyptians God is with us and I'm going to prove God's with no stand still see stand still and see we're kept by the power of God through faith if you want to activate the power of God you've got to activate faith I mean there was a time in the children of Israel life that God did everything God did all the plagues he brought him out he destroyed the enemy and he got into a place and they said okay now if you're going to go any further if you're going to go on the promise anything you're really going to manifest Christ you are going to have to believe for this promise that's how we're kept amen we're kept by the power of God through faith wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be you're in heaviness through manifold Temptations well it was needful for the children of Israel to go through this at the Red Sea they didn't want it but it was needful who did it help I believe it helped Joshua and Caleb I do I believe those were the two that got the good out of what was happening that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto the praise Hallelujah and to what the honor which would see you was wanting and the glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ now I'll say it like this David said that one thing he desired of the Lord he loved to see the the Lord in the house of God he loved coming to church and seeing God Amen of course you have to see it through faith you can't be looking at this Tabernacle here this outside Veil that is full of problems and mistakes because every Veil is full problems and mistakes but it's the word the word and God uses the word through a donkey he uses the word uh brother random said that that first Bible was written up in the sky in the stars the word is everywhere if we can see it amen so when God is here and he appears to us here and he re he shows himself to you personally God I see you that's the moment that we should give God praise and glory and honor because that's what he's looking for too many Christians sit and just want want want from God and are unwilling to give the praise that he's looking for I'm telling you don't let don't be that one don't be that one you you look for every opportunity to praise God whom having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet you believe you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory now that is exactly what God wanted the children of Israel to do to believe even though they don't see to Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory to really stand still and see the salvation of God that's what God was wanting out of them look at verse 9 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls we need to keep our eyes looking forward to the end to the end see too many people I got salvation I already got it and then they're always bothered about what's going on in their life the scripture makes it real plain receiving the end even I'm sorry receiving the end of your faith well what is that even the salvation of your souls did not Jesus say he that endured to the end the same shall be saved so we need to look forward look forward look forward and if the children of Israel could have sit there and say I know they're coming but you know what they can't touch us because I'm in the palm of his hand amen I'm in the palm of his hand I will not fear what man can do unto me I'm looking forward amen the children of Israel didn't know what was going to happen carnally they thought if they went forward they were simply going to drown in the water but spiritually if we're going to walk with the Lord we're going to have to walk by faith is there anything in the Bible where God honestly teaches us to try to figure things out like I gave you enough knowledge I gave you enough experiences figure it out on your own I remember when I was young this is how my dad taught me to swim he sent me on the dock and he is figure it out and I had to figure it out quick God wants us to grow in faith in Trust not I know God so much I got him figured I don't know what he's going to do because you know he said this said that don't don't figure him out trust him out believe him out have confidence until he comes through amen Proverbs 3 5 we read it again trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not to thy own understanding don't lean upon your opinion don't lean upon your knowledge don't don't lean upon your ability to figure things out to reason or to to even look at the impossibility of your Red Sea experience because we all get them and we don't get just you know it didn't stop what the children of Israel at the Red Sea they were out in the wilderness and how many things did they go through trials with so you know trials are going to be there and we don't want them and I understand that I'm okay I can even say Amen let's sing about how we don't want them that's good but you know what we need to get to the place where we just say God not my will thy will be done I will trust you through my trials Amen in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy path and how is he going to do that he's going to direct our path to speak the word amen by faith speak the word by faith the word told me to stand still and see the salvation of God I'm going to speak that word I'm not going to try to conjugate some uh personal thing in my mind that I think God's saying how many times we try to do that and it messed up just speak what's already been spoken God will meet you there to take care of the rest oh I love his word amen amen he will direct us to move forward from our Bleak situation with confidence with courage with assurance he's not going to just take away the Bleak situation so you don't exercise faith no The Bleak situation is there for multiple reasons to think about that in the Bible the the Bible says that God worketh all things uh for his purpose and and somehow he's using the Nations and the governments and the armies and all the terrible things that are going on and climate change and you could list all the problems in the world and somehow our God is so great that he makes everything work out for his purpose so we don't have to sit here and ever feel that things are are out of control things have just gotten a little bit too far that's just the devil uh trying to tell you so you become fearful with the situation we need to keep our eyes looking forward to the end to the end of our faith even the salvation of our souls he will direct us to hold our confidence steadfast to the end Hebrews 3 3 14 says we are made partakers of Christ if we hold our confidence at the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end so we we could literally say if we just take the word for what it says that I'm really not a part taker of Christ until the end foreign because let me just say this Christ is the same yesterday forever he's he is eternal he was he was from the beginning the he was from the Bible says in the beginning was the word the word of God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh he is the alpha and Amiga before there was anything there was a logus and the Bible says for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end in other words if we don't if we just start out with Christ and we we go through the we repent we get baptized and we serve God solid for two years and then for the rest of our time we decide that we don't want to do it we got other things in mind in reality the way the tree falls that's the way it lies so how could we really be a partaker of Christ when Christ is eternal and we decided only to do it for a season come on now I I need you to agree with the word God wants us to look forward to the end to keep our eyes looking forward these are just tricks of the enemy to to lay back to take it easy this once saved all we saved I understand we all make mistakes and we go down the wrong trail we we mess up terrible I understand and I'm okay with that because there's not a human being that hasn't happened to you but I am not for this I I I started serving the lord here and I've lived a pretty decent light I haven't heard anybody and if I don't want to go to church and I don't want to read another listen to the table and just kind of do what I want to do and still think that that's Christ's there's a reason this is here we need to hold not just our confidence but the beginning of our confidence what we had at the beginning you know what we all had at the beginning when you first gave your heart to God you were on fire you were on fire you want to tell the world you didn't care if you had wisdom or not you wanted to tell the world and after you told so many people and you started getting all these trials and tests and people were persecuting you you begin to back off a little bit come on we've all experienced it but that beginning confidence we got to hold it to the end he didn't bring us this far to lose us amen being confident of this very thing what very thing that he which had begun a good work in us we all can testify he started a good work in us all right we can all testify let's testify of this that he will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ let's look forward to to to testifying to the and having that testimony not just the beginning but what he's going to do amen Hebrews 3 1 wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus that word consider notice he wants us to consider hmm well what that means is to fully OBS to observe fully and discover to discover so he is our high priest now he's just not the high priest in the holiest of holy in heaven but he's the high priest of whatever we say amen of our profession not just with the word so we have something to do with this situation consider that what we say is how it's going to be and that's why if we don't speak the right things if we don't speak a positive testimony what can he do he can only operate through faith are you with me great is his faithfulness great is his faithfulness the Bible says in first Thessalonians 5 24 Faithful Is He that calleth you who also will do it consider how faithful God is he will do it Nike wants you to try to do it but we know better we're no match for the devil he will do it he called us and he will do it amen the devil is going to tremble at your humility when you get down on your knees and you say God I need you I need you Lord now the devil's trembling not because you're flexing your muscles and saying you're something but you're getting under God's muscles you're getting under the mighty hand of God you're humbling yourself under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you into season when is his season you know when we consider the faithfulness of God that he's our high priest of our profession that means whatever we testify about God's faithfulness he's going to intercede as the high priest whatever we testify positive about God in our situation he will move in our behalf and if we testify negatively he's literally keeps God from helping us I'm not saying God is going to do bad things he just can't move by doubt and fear why cry a style unto me why why I don't operate like that speak and move forward he only operates through faith the children of Israel walked forward in God's Direction by faith not by sight God told him to go right into obliques direct it orchestrate this Bleak situation and told him to move forward into this wall move forward I'm sorry how do I do it Lord I'm going to trust you he will make a way through there if he wants me to go through there I don't have to figure it out he's the god of the supernatural so we need to learn to speak positive confessions in the middle of our trials amen not when we're feeling good and everything seems to be good and that the money's there and before we our health is there and oh we just we like the songs that the they're playing at church and we got the sermon we want to listen to and you know well I'm just gonna praise him no it's when there's nothing going your way everything seems to be upside down that's when you need to speak a positive confession amen speak faithful testimonies amen amen Revelations 12 verse 11 says we will overcome the Devil by the blood of the Lamb by the word of Our Testimony and we will love not our lives unto the death the word of Our Testimony is much more important it's it's one thing to say I trust in the blood and it's another thing to live it by giving a positive testimony not saying well how many times have we battled this I know the Lord forgave me for this and this and this and this but this I'm having a hard time with come on how many times I just don't think God's happy with me anymore what that's not a positive testimony what you're doing with that statement is limiting the power of God and God does not want to be limited amen right he's more than able to take care of any situation [Music] I want us to remember that we're not in some quick Sprint to get somewhere he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you even in you to the end so this is a journey to the end we're in a long race it requires patience endurance amen fortitude he that endures to the end the same shall be saved so we're not in some Sprint get done get it over with and let's go on with our life no our life is Jesus Christ from here on out everything that we should do it should be about God God should be in the middle of it God should be directing it and God is trying to accomplish what he wants to in her life we're in a long race and unfortunately this race requires us of keeping our flesh crucified to keep it under subjection to keep it under Authority that's what this race requires that's why you need patience we're in a long race that requires it requires praying without ceasing they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength we're in a long race that requires us to to pick up our cross and to carry it as a testimony of our love for God and what he did for us at Calvary you don't want to pick up your cross what you're saying is I don't love enough what Christ did for me at Calvary and I don't mean to be strong but we just got to get rid of our personal attitudes I don't have to do this and it's okay if I do this and I let that go we got to pick up our cross and every time you pick it up you're saying thank you Jesus for Calvary thank you for going the cross for me thank you for making a way for me everybody wants a a gospel that just appease to their carnal nature they're not thinking about a nature change enough it's a love affair with Jesus that's what it is when you pick up your cross you're saying I love you Jesus we think it doesn't have anything to do with Jesus it has everything to do with him we're in a race that requires us to lay down our will and live for others that's God's will he's the captain of our salvation that's the race we're in it wasn't okay we got it through the Red Sea let's Rejoice now and it's all over with God is not going to orchestrate any of our lives that it's going to be easy for us till we get out of here but what he's looking for is some strong soldiers that is willing they make a decision in their heart though he slamming yet well I trust him I'm going all the way with you Jesus it's not a Sprint of repent be baptized we've entered a race to the end of our life amen we've entered a race to the end of our life had his sister come up to me and we were just talking about how sister Kathleen held her faith to the end and she just made mention about we really thought God was going to move and and do something for our sister and and as he has so many times I want to testify of that [Music] but he didn't and and she said it just sought the Lord and the Lord just showed her she ran her race she ran her race now we're all in a race that race is over when God calls you so I say it like this this is the only time that you're going to have to be your best for Jesus amen Amen to three more agency you you need to give your all to the Lord amen we're in a race that requires us to keep Pace to keep up to keep faithful to keep our confident to not allow the devil to come into her mind and give us reasons why we don't have to try kerbet buffin started writing hymns when he was only 18 years old he said many there are who starred in the race but with the light they refused to keep Pace others accept it because it is new but not very many expect to go through I'm going through yes I'm going through I'll pay the price whatever others do I'll take the way with the Lord's despised View he said I'd rather walk with Jesus alone and have for a pillow like Jacob a stone living each moment with his face in view then shrink from my pathway and fail to go through now here it is on every mind of the children of Israel I'll say except Joshua and Caleb they wanted to shrink from their pathway that God was directing and said didn't we tell you when we were back in Egypt if you were going to make his goal we'd rather stay here and serve so we don't have to go through you know trials in our life I don't want to shrink from my pathway when he's directing me to go forward there's no time to shrink and go back with God he's always pointing us to go forward to speak and go forward move forward the Bible says follow them who through patience inherit the promises of God follow them Hebrews 10 verse 35 cast not away therefore your confidence don't cast it away how do you cast it away you start looking at all the problems because your confidence is what has great recompense of reward think about that your confidence that's what's going to get you to your reward for you have needed patience that after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not Terry now the judge shall live by faith it's just all there is to it but if any man decide not to keep going forward God said my soul shall have no pleasure in him now this is a serious thing we can think this is not a big thing the sermon is going to be over in a little bit and I can go on with life but I'm telling you this is a serious thing amen your soul belongs to God it does not belong to you you do not make decisions of what you want to do right it's God's will or we're in trouble it's God's will or we're in trouble he says the Bible says but we are not of them who draw back unto Perdition but of them were of the group that believe to the saving of the Soul we've got to keep moving forward in faith and in confidence to move with Assurance I'll say Blessed assurance a lot of times we get hooked up and I need somebody to encourage me and I want somebody to say this to me and I need somebody to spend time with me I mean we need to learn to get along with God and to know where our true help comes and I do believe in encouragement I do I need it as much as anybody and I long for it as much as anybody but to live off of it where is my relationship with God forward onto battle not questioning not doubting not wondering not thinking things are strange he has Us in the palm of his hands he's going to do something he's going to you know what this is the truth when you can get to the place where you do not care why he does what he does in your life you're just happy that he's with you and you praise him no matter what you know a lot of times as parents you get to that place with your children or an employer with his employees that you have to spend some time talking about why we're going to do what we're going to do and that's okay some of the time but there comes a time where a parent says this is what you got to do and you got to do it now and the child can't be going you know what why explain it first but by then the car may come by every parent wants their child to just trust what they're saying amen just trust them believe it God wants us the same way to not lean to our understanding but trust him trust him so keep moving forward in faith Onward Christian Soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before Christ the royal master leading against the full full word into battle see his Banner's goal God did not want Israel to fight against those that were coming after him their own enemy that we're chasing him but God wanted them to move forward in battle but what was the battle of faith it was a battle of faith of trusting God of of a speaking God is with me I'm in the will of God doing his will I I have repented I've left Egypt I'm marching forward I'm going to stand still and see God fight these battles see so he wants us to move forward in battle but it isn't against any person any situation it's a it's a battle of faith because Satan's trying to get us to question to doubt to wonder what's going on and what we have to do is increase our faith I mean if we're going to make a Rapture it's going to require not just a little bitty faith that well I know when I get the church the doors will be open because they were for the last umpteen Sundays we need a rapturing faith that means we have to build our faith build yourself in the Most Holy Faith keep building keep looking for every situation that happens in your life as an opportunity to build because God is not going to hand us character right right it's not a gift God did not tell the children of Israel oh yeah just because you came to the Red Sea yes you did exactly the right thing now there's a Promised Land walk in there's no enemies there's going to come a time where he's going to expect you to have faith to believe second Timothy chapter 3 verse it's awful quiet I think if I was outside this company really entering into the word today the word is real God is still giving us direction to fight the good fight of Faith he's still leading Us in that direction to move forward that's the only way we can second Timothy 3 10 but thou has fully known my Doctrine my manner of life my purpose my faith my long Charity My long suffering my charity and my patience but then he goes on to say my persecutions my afflictions which came on to me at Antioch Iconium lystra what persecutions I endured not that I had to go through I mean you can't believe what I had to go through no that I endured but look at his testimony hallelujah look what he spoke a positive testimony but out of them all the Lord delivered me not out of them all I figured it out no his testimony was God one place Paul said we are troubled on every side yet not to stressed we are perplexed but not despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but were not destroyed but out of them all the Lord delivered us the Lord delivers what a testimony you know we've heard so many times if you count your blessings it'll surprise you what God have done I understand we can talk about the trials we can talk about the problems and they're honestly they're real but there comes a time for the believer now that he's got to start talking about the testimony what he's done for others he'll do for me now the Bible says they overcame them by the word of their testimony so we have to start testifying the Lord has delivered me the Lord has given me Victory the Lord will see me through the Lord will give me strength I love her sister she wanted to testify I think the church should be filled with people who want to testify of how great God is how great God has been in their life we shouldn't be sitting hoping that we get something that makes us feel like that no we should have a relationship like that that we can't wait to tell somebody what God's done for us look at verse 12. he didn't leave us out of it this is for us yeah and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus are going to suffer persecution and he said evil Manner and seduces are going to wax worse and worse and deceiving and being deceiving that's what you see every time you like uh anytime any news or anything that's coming out this new information you don't know what to trust and basically I'll say for the most part don't even try to figure it out just stop looking at it read the Bible you can have confidence with that but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of of of knowing of whom thou has learned them in other words continue to move forward in what God has already spoken to you God's direction is to move forward to continue in the things that you've learned to hold your confidence steadfast to the end to run the race with patience the one that he has set before us the one that he has directed for our life not Lord why did you why has this happened to me why do I got to do this again why me Lord oh don't act like the children of Israel that had to have it handed to them testify like Joshua and Caleb is one one we just got to be I have a positive confession and I know it's hard but it's easy to do if you don't stare at how bad you are all your mistakes all your problems your situation just none of that another one thing him he is my all in all he saved me he redeemed me he is in the midst of sanctifying me he is in the midst of purifying me he is making me in His image and I will testify of my God that he is more than able more than Abel he has made us a conquerors man amen he is conquered for us no wonder the children of Israel when they got on the other side of the Red Sea they were rejoicing at that moment they realized they did not do it was all God they were praising God but they didn't hold their confidence steadfast to the end as soon as they got a little further in the wilderness they begin to look back and murmur and complain and wish they didn't have to go through their trials wherefore Christ thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward go forward the word of Our Testimony is so important Proverbs 18 21 says death in life are in the power of the tongue you have a choice and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof like it or not we are what we eat it's not what it's not what comes uh inside that defiles a man but what comes out so you're going to get a lot of thoughts it's important that you meditate on the word of God day and night be planted by the tree of righteousness that the thoughts of my my heart the the meditation let it be acceptable unto thee o God it's important to always maintain a testimony of Life watch what you say amen let your testimony be I know the Lord is with me why talk about the wall talk about God's with me right here how many times have we heard brother random say something along the lines when that Pillar of Fire was there he was Fearless with that pillar fire was there and they I believe it was spoken that there were some that were not they were not afraid of brother Branham but they but it was that pillar fire because that was the one that discerned the thoughts and intents our confidence is in him he's with us he will make a way for us so let us have a testimony of confidence now of assurance speak positive things well brother John you don't understand it's okay I don't I'm not leaning towards it anyways but I'm a Believer in God if I have to take sides I'm going to take sides that I'm a Believer not an understander my understanding has gotten me into so much trouble being funny in the middle of the greatest crisis that the children of Israel were going through they were murmuring they were scared but God was counseling them why are you crying to me in this situation speak and go forward God's direction for us is a direction of faith forward not back up not regroup not huddle not redo the plans not maybe I made a go forward I mean I yesterday I went to uh go get some Stone and I here I am running late can you bear with me just a little bit so there's so many things I want to do I wanted to come to the church we got a chance to change couple of these lights and I want to change a couple more for my wife they just take so long to do and uh I didn't get to it but I had a chance to get some stones for her Greenhouse so you know he's got so many things to do and and so I went to the shop and got a hold of the person uh are they actually called and um I'm grabbing the truck and going to West Broomfield to get these stones I get all the way there I pull in the driveway and I don't have the money to buy the stones and it's already getting dark and I feel so bad that I planned this with the other person I didn't mind going through what I went through but I just felt bad for them so uh I didn't know what I was going to do if I made a decision called Cheryl and she was going to meet me halfway it was closer to three quarters away I had to do most of the driving the way back to meet Cheryl I'm saying Lord I don't know if I'm out of your will but if I am I'm sorry that's all I can do that's all you can do we don't always know if something's wrong we're just Lord I'm sorry and you go forward amen it gives the CH of the Lord a chance to speak to you to deal with you because I because that trial when I was going through it I just thought trials doesn't mean you're out of the will the Lord in great easy blessings doesn't mean you got the favor of God man amen we've just we've got to see and trust God for every situation oh my my okay I'm just want you to know I appreciate your prayers I have to skip a lot again that's just me but I want to at least get to a couple scriptures oh my see this is the best part I don't even like skipping the best part let your testimony be a testimony of faith now a lot of times we feel that our faith is weak how can I have faith for my situation I feel weak there's things that we have to do to exercise faith for a life we can't sit and feed on all the things of the world and expect to have faith faith comes from God and you can read in it Revelations 10 uh or I'm sorry Romans chapter 10 verses 8. uh through 17. we don't have time to read it all but I would like love for you to read it because the word of God is nigh unto thee it's in your heart it's in your mouth you have to testify of it if you're not willing to stand up and speak a word of faith I say this to you spend some time praying spend time reading the Bible spend time listening to the tapes brother random said that there was actually rapturing faith lies in them so if we feel our faith is weak I can't give you faith Faith doesn't come from humans Faith doesn't come from that you know Daily Bread I've done with the day or like your calendar or a text or a phone call I mean I love them all and God can be in them all but you can't stop there because we are all going to go through a test that God is going to demand that we stand and watch his salvation or will shrink back amen so I say spend more time with God Amen God will give you Faith to have a positive testimony come out of your mouth that God is going to see me through amen Mark chapter 11 verse 22 God wants us to speak a word of faith and move forward and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God how many times have we heard brother Brandon say those words when we're listening to a tape same words have faith prayer line have faith just have faith in God verse 23 for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say to this mountain whatever it might be be thou removed that whosoever shall say to this sea this Red Sea be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith now I want to say this none of us can muster that faith right none of us can sit and say I am going to believe for this faith comes from God Amen I understand you want this or this or this or this but you have to ask get along with God and say God this is what I want but not my will thy will be done if this is your will for my life and you'll know because there'll be such a strong strong think about all these examples in the Bible where the people were blind something was going on with them and they just wanted Jesus to heal them and Jesus would say can if thou believed Not all men have faith we have to exercise it God is looking for him that hungers and thirsts for righteousness to dig in and say God I've got to hear from you and when that faith is in there your testimony will speak and I believe the the the rottenness of ill feelings and and jealousies and and bat biting and gossiping and this I don't care about uh serving God with all my heart and all these things that are standing in your way he'll give you faith for because it's his word the problem is the mountains we want removed are the things that are standing in the way to give us the things that we Lust For and how do we expect God to give us faith for that seek ye first the kingdom of God in his righteousness and all other things shall be added unto you I want to end with this John chapter 16 verse 23 and in that day you shall ask me nothing very well I say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask in my father's name he will give it to you do you believe that scripture I wonder are we in that day are we looking for it ask the father in my name Jesus is getting our direction to the Oneness of God and the power that we sung about is in the name of Jesus Christ he promised to give it I want such a close relationship with God such a a Oneness with God that when I speak it's not really me speaking don't you want that that when you speak it's not you it's not your thoughts it's his thoughts it I would rather be found testifying of what the word wants me to testify about than to be standing at this wall and talking about the realness of how bad of a person I am and that I can't possibly manifest Christ that that's not the right testimony the right testimony is I will crucify this flesh I will overcome I will move forward in faith I will hold my confidence I will move forward in the direction that God wants me to go let's Stand Together he is the same yesterday today and forever amen God's direction for us is to move forward not wait move forward in faith forward in confidence I just love it remember the the the the the man that came across the prayer line and he was blind and there had been some before maybe some after that brother Brandon had prayed for and instantly got healed but this man when he went through and God said you're healed thus saith the Lord he thought something was wrong so he went through the prayer line again and brother Branham said God said you were healed what did Brother Brandon tell him to do move forward keep testifying of what God is going to do for you what God has done for you keep testifying just move forward what so what was he doing he was
