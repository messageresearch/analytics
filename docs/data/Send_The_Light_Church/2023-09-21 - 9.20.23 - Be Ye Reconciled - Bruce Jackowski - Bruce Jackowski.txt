Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is here Jesus is here [Applause] [Music] all things are possible Jesus is here amen amen if you'll turn with me this evening to Second Corinthians chapter 5. we have uh two scriptures readings tonight amen so II Corinthians 5 and then we'll go to Romans 5. amen second Corinthians 5 starting in verse 17. therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ stead be ye reconciled to God for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that he might be made that we might be made the righteousness of God in him amen and if you turn over to Romans 5 Romans 5 verse 10. it says so if for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also join God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement amen as far hits for word of prayer dear Lord we're grateful father Lord that that we can gather together father Lord we can read your word but it it takes a holy spirit to come father to anoint the vessel and anoint your word anoint the hearers lord lord Jesus open our eyes father I pray that when we go we can say did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us Lord I pray you'll speak to each and every one of us we love you Lord we thank you for all these things in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen you may be seated amen so just go back to Second Corinthians because that's where we'll start we're going to take a text here out of um oh I lost it out of verse 20. be ye reconciled to God brother Branham said so now many people can open up this word like this but it takes the Holy Spirit to interpret the word don't you think so you see we can pull back the pages but it takes God the Holy Spirit to reveal it the Bible it's a mysterious Hidden book and there's no need of trying to learn it by education and it doesn't come that way the Bible plainly says God said I have hid it from the eyes of the wise and The Prudent and we reveal it to babes such as we'll learn so the Bible's not a western book it's an Eastern book and a few trips across the sea will let you become more acquainted with the customs of the Bible and the things and then it becomes a new book to you when you once live with the Jewish people and where the Bible was written and in the Oriental types now most of us we can't just quit our jobs and sell our house and go live in Judea for six months and learn the customs of the Jewish people and then go over into India and learn the customs of the people over there so I appreciate that brother Branham says we'll never understand it until we go and live and learn but we don't have that opportunity but the key to that whole scripture is it takes the Holy Spirit Lord to interpret the word it takes that's what it takes amen so in Jehovah Jireh brother Branham says so now that may seem strange to just a mind that has never studied the Oriental Customs we have so many Customs we have so many things the Bible was written as an Eastern book for an Eastern people and we are our Western people trying to put a western interpretation to an Eastern book amen so just to show you an example of that brother Branham says but look he says a person that's got unconfessed sin or something in their heart you could pray for them all night long and they'll never do any good that demon will hold right there or if that person was supposed to do something that didn't do it and God put that disease on them to bring them to to reconciliation or to correction you just can't do it so we see where brother Bynum took reconciliation and he intertwined it and replaced it with correction that these two completely different English words in that just in that quote he shows that he's using them interchangeably so I want to take a look tonight to be reconciled amen so in second Corinthians 5 we're just going to start in second Corinthians 5 17 it says so therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature he's a new creature old things are passed away and behold all things are become new that's a good place to be that's a really good place because the old ways when you become into Christ then the old things that you used to do they no longer have a hold on you anymore you know you used to go run with this certain crowd of people and he used to you know you'd get out of work and maybe we're gonna go to the bar we're gonna have a drink and and then we're gonna laugh and complain about our boss and our job and then we'll go home and everything else but when you come into Christ those things old things are passed away All Things become new the way you dress it becomes new the way you act it becomes new your old habits your old language your old your old everything it's all new amen and and that's a good place to be amen but he asked that question he says if any man be in Christ and you'll notice that Romans 5 starts out with the same question if so in verse 18 He says and all things are of God so whether it's a trial or whether it's a blessing or or whether it is God is in everything amen God is in everything all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation now we take those two words and and we see reconciled and that's in the past tense and we see reconciliation which has got the same word but it's a process and we assume that those two words are the same word like they would be in the English language but they're not in the English language when we talk about reconciliation or to reconcile something normally it's used in accounting um in the English dictionary it says to bring into harmony amen so we find out you know when when I get a bill a bill will come in the mail and and I'll open it up and now I look at it and it says oh this is the light bill and I owe a hundred dollars and then I go to the bank and I get a hundred dollars and I go and I pay that bill and now once I've paid that bill then it's reconciled and it's no longer owed but next month it comes again and then I have to pay it again if the debt goes up I have to pay more if it goes down I get to pay less but that's the way we see reconciled um you might want to leave that scripture up there so so when we look at these two words we think of it as a certain way we think of of um it being something that's going to to bring us into harmony with God but when Paul when Paul you know see the thing about Corinthians the Corinthian Church it it was um it was the most uneducated Church they had Church order issues they had problems they had to you know Paul had to explain everything to them and and try to teach them and and bring them into Harmony and that and he wrote this to them and he wrote this to them you know Corinth is over by turkey it's over in Asia Minor and that's what brother Branham said it's an Eastern book so we need to take a look so reconciled now um you got you got my first uh I gave this so reconciled is this Greek word I'm not even going to try to pronounce it it's only used six times in the in the New Testament and it means to change mutually that is figuratively to compound a difference and you'll notice that in this particular word it says to change mutually and that means you have to be in agreement so you know when two people come together and whether they're making a business deal or they're making a simple deal like hey what are we having for dinner tonight Donna has to be in mutually agreement with me or I have to get in agreement with her white Crick right and then so because this this says it's a change mutually then it takes two people to make it and it also that is figuratively a compound of a difference and you can't have compound with one a compound is two or more and they have to come together so now let's uh go back to verse 17. uh sorry 18. so he says all things are of God who hath reconciled us see there's two people and we have to be in mutual agreement with God to be reconciled to Jesus Christ so there's two things happening there one is we have we have a debt and there's somebody else is coming along to pay the debt we've seen that song I owed a debt that I could not pay He Paid a Debt he did not owe so so he says all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ which is compound and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation so now that's the interpret the second slide that I gave you sister Amanda so this is a different word it's only used four times in the New Testament and it means to exchange an exchange that is restoration to a Divine favor I'm going to give something and I'm going to be restored to Divine favor which is going to create an atonement because without an atonement you can't you have Divine favor amen so go back to the scripture uh verse 18. so all things are of God who hath reconciled us see the compound to himself by Jesus Christ and it's given us to us the ministry of reconciliation or an exchange there is no agreement there it's something I'm going to give and God's going to do something for me amen amen so verse 19 says to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself and that's the first interpretation that first word again reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them I thought it was really interesting that when I looked at that I said the world is lost but God in Christ he came together with them made an agreement with the world and he's not holding them accountable for their trespasses he's not holding them accountable for it that's what it says and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation so this is that second word again where he says unto us the word of an exchange as we go farther into this you'll like it I promise verse 20. so now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ stead be ye reconciled to God that word there reconciled is the exchange word the same word that the they interpreted as reconciliation it's the exchanged word and what I like is that in the original it says on behalf of Christ therefore we are ambassadors as if God were inviting through us we entreat on behalf of Christ now I'm going to entreat because if I'm an ambassador I'm somebody who's a representative from a country and all of the government is on my shoulders so we're an ambassador for Christ and we entreat others to be reconciled to God but we need to be reconciled to God Amen amen praise the Lord yes so then verse 21 says for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him brother Brennan said he said in the Paradox he said he had to become that he had to become sin to die to satisfy his own laws of righteousness he predicted and said the day that you eat thereof that day you shall die and he had to fulfill there was nobody else could do it but himself amen amen so let's go to Romans 5. so we find out that Paul when he was right into the Corinthians he's you know we started out he says therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creature and Romans 5 and verse 10 he says for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life amen that word there being reconciled both of those words in that scripture are the ones where it is an exchange there was no mutual agreement it was an exchange amen we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement and that word atonement is the Greek word for reconciliation it's the same word amen foreign so when you look at the Bible you don't so the thing is is that we brother random said well we can't learn it by education we have to have the Holy Spirit come down and show us the other morning I was I was up and after I said my prayers and that I normally the first thing I do is is I open up lifeline and I read the quote for the day and I read the quote and and the scripture that they had underneath it was Romans 5 10. and and I started reading that and reading verse 11 and then it just seemed like the Lord came and started speaking to me so so we see what we see is that these two words are not the same as you having a debt and you having to pay that debt it's not the same so let's go and take a look if you're going to know these things then you have to go back to the beginning so let's go to Genesis 3. amen Genesis 3 we know is the fall and in Genesis 3 15 now look the Lord has already spoken to Adam and he's spoken to The Serpent and now he's still speaking to the serpent and he says I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel and that word enmity means hostility or hatred it also means you'll see that that brother Branham also said it's it's like a great big wall he said it was a chasm you know after the curse God cursed the serpent so the Serpent's Seed could never mingle again with the human seed there was a Chasm made so great that it could never cross ever again amen amen and then down in verse 22 just to save some time down in verse 22 says and the Lord God said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden we know that God at the beginning before he created the heavens of the earth before he created Adam and Eve that he was alone with his thoughts and his thoughts were his attributes but one of the things that had never been displayed to Adam or to his creation was God's hatred God had an attribute of hatred he does he he has an attribute and he had to display it he had to display it and it must have really broke his heart he had to turn his head away because look at what it says therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden that you just think about it how many I mean I'm not gonna ask for raised hands but we're all praying for God's will for our lives right Lord what should I do what's the next thing I should do what do you want me to do today what what did I miss today that I should have done or anything else and here is God's commandment to Adam on that day get away from me get away from me drove him look at verse 24. so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life it was so it would this sin was so God was so angry that he had to put a cherubim not just any old angel he put a guard of The Mercy Seat he put a guard a seraphim a cherubim a mighty angel with a flaming sword that Adam could never get back to the Tree of Life he could never get back to the fellowship he had with God there was no way back because of this mistake be irreconciled how is he gonna do that how is he ever going to be reconciled to God when man has no Adam you know Adam when he saw that he was naked and he saw that he his heart condemned him and he went he said what am I going to do what I'm going to do and he went and he hid he hid from the presence of God and when he hid from the presence of God then he went and he actually said I'm going to make something to reconcile mutual agreement I'm gonna make a way back and he sowed fig leaves together God rejected it because there was enmity now say me and brother Ron I count him as my friend I hope you count me as your friend so we have Fellowship but if brother Ron would happen to offend me then there becomes a wall because now I don't trust him and there's an enmity there's a Chasm there's there's something that's you know brother Ronnie walks by I shake his hand I hug him now he's going to be watching me all my steps but you know but you can tell you can say the fellowship's not the same something has happened enmity has come in enmity has come in amen in the message Oneness brother Branham says so now Eve she was United until she broke one word or doubted one word being true and that separated her every word man should not live by bread alone but by every word who's living by every word brother Keith are you sister link yeah well you're gutier than I am because when we get up in the morning we break God's word maybe we forget about him till after breakfast maybe we don't thank him for the day maybe we maybe we get in a hurry we get in all these other things man shall live by every word amen so we could be in God United because Adam and Eve before the fall before the disbelieving of the word was an example of what we could be in him to be United with him is life to be separated from him is death and now if we follow his Commandments and broken cistern's brother Adam said so you see God first set the human race on Earth and he told them to live by his word and now the word of God is like a chain and you're passing across hell with it and the chain is only its best at its weakest link and God wants us to keep every word of it now that was the first of the Bible just to break one word pledge the whole human race into the darkness of death amen now the thing is in the conferences brother Brandon makes this statement he says so remember his commandment was the day that you eat thereof that day you die and God cannot defy his own law and be just so he can't even walk over his jaw his law he can't even walk over his judgment the curse that he put on the ground for Adam's sake God couldn't step over that because then he's no longer just he couldn't do that so you see there when Paul Ronan Corinthians he said he became sin because your sin won't work God already knows you're a sinner you're you've been a sinner and that's a whole different message but the thing is is that there is nothing that we can do to atone for this failure on human beings parts so God cannot defy his own laws and be just so he made a great Chasm between him and man enmity he made this great big Chasm you remember Lazarus Lazarus he he was a beggar and and when he died he went in it was in the bosom of Abraham and then there was the Rich Young Ruler and the Rich Young Mueller when he died he went into hell and he said oh Abraham he says dip your finger in the water and bring it over and touch my tongue that my thirst could be quenched because I'm I'm parched and he said I cannot come from here to where you're at because the chasm is way too big God's anger was that strong he was that disappointed in Adam and Eve and what they had done with his word praise the Lord in the called out brother Branham said God will make you pay for your sin he hates sin but I thought he was a god of love he hates sin because he's a holy God and a holy God cannot tolerate sin if he could have stood sin he would have stopped the whole thing when the first sin was committed but that isn't what the scripture said when he saw that man had sinned and he says if he touches the tree of life he said that is not a good thing and I am going to make sure that he can never touch that tree of life I am going to put cherubims with flaming swords round about it it's pretty hopeless that's that's pretty hopeless if he could have stood sin he would have stopped the whole thing when the first sin was committed but sin requires death and they that do such is dead already and sin and trespasses in the message pardon brother Bynum says so when man sinned in the Garden of Eden he crossed a great Chasm separating himself from the Eternal God man at that time was eternal with God he had no sickness no sorrow or death I love this next statement man was not made to die hell was not made for man praise the Lord hell was created for the devil and his angels and not for mankind because they were created on Earth to be Sons and Daughters of God but when man sinned and stepped across the boundary line between right and God right and wrong he separated himself from God leaving himself no way back he was totally lost he could not come back because he had sinned but God rich in Mercy accepted a substitute because he had said the day that you eat thereof that day you die and God's justice and his Holiness requires death because it's his word and he must keep his word in order to be God reconciled reconciliation let's go to Ephesians 2. and see what Paul said about it got your attention now Ephesians 2 verse 13. he says but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off right great chasm our Maiden I by the blood of Christ for he is our peace not you not what you think you can do or what you can bring to God he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us Jesus Christ see there's reconciled a mutual agreement between two Lost Sinner that's you and the holy God that's God and by mutual agreement we compound our resources to light the Slate clean to be reconciled for he is our peace what made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us amen having abolished in his flesh the enmity the hatred even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances now this is an interesting scripture so God in the book in The Book of Genesis back there when he had fellowship with man God reached down and called people and had fellowship with them but when he called Israel out of Egypt the only way that they could have fellowship with him was through the law of ordinances that Moses brought down from the mount and God told Moses he said he said come here I'm going to tell you everything that I require of this people for them to be reconciled to me knowing full well that they could not for keep the word knowing full well they could not keep the word but in those ordinances and the things that he wrote down it revealed more about the Unseen God because you notice that when they feel when they made up the Tabernacle in the wilderness there was Mercy there wasn't there the law was there the law was in the in the Tabernacle um in the Ark of the Covenant the law was there The Mercy Seat sat on top of the law the cherubims guarded The Mercy Seat but you know what you couldn't go in there because there was a veil there was a partition there was hatred there was there was there was something standing there to keep you from being reconciled and every year people came they came every year that is is they sin they go to the priests they say what is God's law require God take the law an ordinance written out he'd say okay you did this you defrauded your brother this is what you have to do you have to buy this bring this bring this and then I will accept your sacrifice you bring it to the priest you don't get to slay the lamb you don't get to slay your own sacrifice the priest does the priest does the washing the priest does the offering the priest offers the sacrifice for you and then says you're good to go see you next year but only once a year does somebody go up and break through the Veil to the mercy seat and put blood on it that all of our sins they couldn't be reconciled they were pushed on amen look at verse 15 so he says having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contain an ordinances for to make in himself of Twain one new man so making peace verse 14 where it says broken down the middle wall of partition between us that word means to break up to destroy to dissolve to melt to put it away Jesus Christ who is our peace when he had made both one and hath broken down he wiped it away having abolished in his flesh the hatred even the law of Commandments contained ordinances for to make it himself of Twain one new man so making peace amen if thou if a man is in Christ then all things are made new amen it's been reconciled amen praise the Lord and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby you see God had a Chasm there that we couldn't cross but he he made a way I I love the idea that God couldn't even step over his own word he couldn't even step over it so he had to become sin to fulfill his own word to pay the sacrifice because you're not good enough you will never be able to be good enough but when he went and did that it washed away all of that it melted it away it pushed it away so that when I accepted Jesus Christ not because of my goodness not because of what I can do not what I can bring it's a mutual agreement I see I'm completely useless amen and I make an agreement with God and God says I will pay the way I will pay the price if you think about you look at the Book of Ruth when when Ruth came back to Judea she was not even Of The Bloodline only through marriage she wasn't even she she had no Jewish blood in her at all and when she went and labored in the field Boaz who was a blood relation to you Naomi but no relation to Ruth when he redeemed Naomi he had to marry the moabite praise the Lord yeah oh hey she had no rights she had nothing he had to by his own free choice by his own free choice say I will redeem Naomi and Ruth and raise up seed praise the Lord Amen to reconcile to reconcile that which has no ability to reconcile we have no we have nothing to bring to God not a thing our best efforts in the morning praying and crying out to God unless the blood of Jesus Christ is before you God doesn't even have to hear it amen but when you're born again if a man be in Christ and all things have become new then praise the Lord amen I've been reconciled amen amen amen Ephesians 2 16 he says and that he might reconcile both unto God and one body by the cross having slain or destroyed the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them which were nigh for through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the father amen now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God Amen brother Brandon in the unveiling of God says but since Pentecost since the crucifixion when the veil was rent from the top to the bottom for that generation Jesus was that God veiled see when Jesus came he had to come according to all of the written ordinances that were contained in the Old Testament he had to come he had to fulfill every prophecy he had to he could not leave one of them undone he had to fulfill them all he had to he had to come and when he came when he stood and he chose the disciples he gave them gifts but they could not be reconciled they cannot be reconciled till he went to Calvary because the enmity stopped them from that the hatred was still there men at sin man had failed the word of God but God himself came down and fulfilled the word God himself came down and did that and when he came down and did that he could destroy he could rip rip it right up look at it's what the scripture says amen Jesus was that God veiled and when he died at Calvary God sent fire and lightning and ripped the veil from top to the bottom that the whole Mercy Seat was now in plain view amen but they were too blind to see it and Moses said there Paul said reading of Moses when Moses is read yet the veil is still on their heart brother sister that's what the Jews did when the veil was rent and brought God in a plain view hanging on the cross he was in plain view but they couldn't see it amen look at Hebrews 10. praise the Lord praise the Lord amen he's Mighty to be praised why because you can't do it do it there is nothing you can bring look at Hebrews 10 1-3 it says for the law having a shadow of good things to come yes a shadow because the shadow was you know brother Branham talked about he says if I had he says you know if I see a shadow he says it's it's a reflection of light shining on something that's real a shadow is not real a shadow is just a reflection of light on something and he said so you could see a shadow and if you notice in the daytime and that and you go and See Your Shadow it's distorted it's distorted because you may look at your Shadow and you might be eight feet tall well when the reality comes and the light is is brought into reflection with you and you become one with your Shadow find out what your real height is or it may look at your wide and fat because of reflection off a window or something else but when you come into the reality of it then when the reality comes there is no need for a shadow amen so he says the law the law all the written ordinances that's what we read all the written ordinances The Ten Commandments all of the laws that are contained in Leviticus everything that's in Deuteronomy which is the second law everything that's in numbers all those things all of them they're just a shadow they're a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of those things because the very image was Jesus Christ that was the very image and can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the Commerce there unto perfect or reconciled they could never get reconciled never the balanced book was always going to be out of balance because they didn't have their funds to pay off the debt amen for then would they not have ceased to be offered that's a good question he says if the law could do it why would he have to come back every year if the law could take care of it because of the worshipers once purged should have had no more consciousness of sin but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year and that's why you can't take the English word reconcile which means to bring back into Harmony and apply it to the New Testament reconcile because when God reconciled you all you were allowed to do was given Exchange just give an exchange say I I Surrender Lord and when you do that then it becomes a mutual agreement and when it's a mutual agreement he takes care of all of it he takes care of every bit of it he takes care of every shortcoming he takes care of every every spot every wrinkle he takes care of every failure he takes care of all your all your troubles he takes care of all of it if you can just give it to him if it can just lay it at his feet amen amen for in those sacrifices there is Remembrance again made of sins every year you see when the English when we think of reconcile and we think about reconciling our bank book or whatever else the debts just keep coming they just keep coming they just keep coming but he that's been purged from his sins you're free amen let's go to Hebrews 2. praise the Lord amen amen be ye reconciled Hebrews 2 verse 11. for both he that sanctifieth that's Jesus Christ and they who are Sanctified are all of One well I sure like that hahaha because a lot of times I don't feel very sanctified but through his blood I'm sanctified amen and Paul says I'm one with him if he Sanctified me which he did then they that are Sanctified and he that did the sanctification it's a mutual agreement it's a pure reconciliation amen praise the Lord praise the Lord and they are Sanctified are all one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren see it's not you calling him your brother he's not ashamed to call brother Mark his brother his son on one hand but his brother that's co-equal co-equal a brother you know in a in a court proceeding when you have an inheritance it's evenly distributed if there's no if there's no will all the heirs their joint heirs and Joint means equal and he that sanctifieth and he that's been Sanctified are all of One praise the Lord that ought to be enough welder should be jumping and go ahead run the aisles amen saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God hath given me for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood now here's the key he says for he knows that you are flesh and blood which means you're born in sin shaping and iniquity right that means you can't help it this body is cursed it's you know the devil has a right to give sickness to it the devil has a right to put you in the corner and let you blow up and go off the handle yeah he's got a right to get in there and push you to the limit to to commit murder commit adultery to do all kinds of wicked things because your flesh and blood you are flesh and blood God is going to redeem this but that's not till the body change so right now he's Redeeming the inside amen the Holy Ghost is on the inside it's on the inside it's the inside that becomes new when I became when I when I was a sinner I looked like me when I became a saint I still look like me but something on the inside had changed amen for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that's why he couldn't do it with a lamb a lamb wouldn't work it had to be Flesh and Blood Flesh and Blood like you have flesh and blood that fell in the Garden of Eden and when it fell in the Garden of Eden God said I have to have some way to redeem my lost seed either must be a way to get them back but the chasm was so great because if he broke his law to save his children then he's no longer God a true reconciliation amen praise the Lord amen amen for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver or liberate them who through fear of death were all of their lifetime subject to bondage or slavery for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord yes to be reconciled to be free free of my sin free of my shortcoming free of my thoughts free of everything that that bothers me he has taken it and nailed it to the Cross because when he nailed the ordinance to the Cross then I'm no longer accountable for those things praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen and then in verse 17 it says wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren then he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in all things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people hallelujah Hallelujah amen amen I hope you're hearing me because praise the Lord amen let's go to Romans 8. look at what Romans 8 says in light of these things amen in light of these things look at what Romans 8 says therefore there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death amen that's the Ten Commandments he's made me free from that It's Made Me free from the ordinances this otherwise you're going to tell me you don't believe the Scripture it says he took those written ordinances and nailed them to the tree I just read it he nailed it to the tree and took my place so I don't have to die praise the Lord I don't have to have 30 stripes for every time I mess up praise the Lord praise the Lord amen he says look at what verse 3 says for what the law could not do the law could not reconcile you for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh praise the Lord I'm such a failure every day I make mistakes I get depressed I get upset I yell at my wife she yells back we we have all these problems but God is not we're weak but God doesn't expect us to pay for the penalty of our own failures he sent himself he did not take the form of angels but he took a form of a Seed of Abraham walked where we walked felt Temptation like we feel we fall he did not he was tried he fulfilled every scripture he did all these things so that I could be reconciled amen amen amen praise God Amen God's sending his own son for the likeness of sinful flesh see in the likeness of sinful flesh what did Corinthians say he became sin he was not sin but he became sin he had no fault but he became fault he had no shortcomings but he became them where he saw you can't handle your temper he became that where he saw you can't overcome this problem or that problem he became it he became it that if you if you mutually agree if you mutually say Lord reconcile me he who has the bank of Heaven he can come down and pay the debt and you know what once he blotted it away that's the other scripture we read he said he blooded it away it's gone the electric Bill's not coming again that's the difference the bill doesn't come again does not the scriptures tell us it says does Jesus Christ go to the calvary and then he has to go back and be crucified again and then go back and get crucified again and get crucified again for your sins he said no he said this man by one time one blood one sacrifice reconciled all of it took care of all of it set us free amen amen praise the Lord amen amen it gives us a lot of Hope brother Johnson I'm telling you we're failures we know that he condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit oh Hallelujah Hallelujah amen and forsaking all brother Branham said so we do not want to try to enter his into thy presence with sin upon us is that right we don't want to do that therefore knowing that each day troubles and things that beset us that might not even be noticed in our own thinking but when we come to think of a holy God who even angels are dirty in his sight now dwell on that for a bit here was God and he wanted to express himself back in the Garden of Eden and angels looked dirty in his sight so when Adam fell and Eve fell that anger was released that hatred of sin was released and it made such a huge Chasm brother random said he said Adam could never come back you think God drove Adam out of his presence he drove him out and then Adam had to go get an innocent lamb and kill it sacrifice it not knowing that God would accept it because the first lamb that was slain God did the slang so from that point all the way to Mount Sinai Moses from that point on there was always that doubt will God accept this will God accept this you know when God met Abraham on the mountain and God told Abraham he says Abraham he says come up to the spot because Abraham was at this question he said Lord he said you gave me a promise I'm going to be the father of many nations he says all I got is Eliezer it's a Damascus and he says Ishmael I mean where where is my son God told Abraham the sacrifice that he must bring go back and read it Abraham didn't come up with his own idea the two turtle doves and the and the lamb and the Bullock and that he didn't do that God came down to Abraham and said do this this and this and this and then in Abraham he took those things and brother Branham said he he he he laid him out he got him going and he says the horror of Darkness came and he said the birds came and brother Branham and I think brother John preached about this about he had he had to shoo the birds away away from the sacrifice they had to keep the sacrifice clean Waiting for God and he said a a lamp came down and walked amongst there and he said a deep sleep the horror of hell It Came Upon him and he said and then God spoke to him after he accepted the sacrifice see there's no sacrifice you can make there's nothing you can bring to be reconciled to God except accepting Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ is the Fulfillment of all of what God promised amen amen praise the Lord amen the angels are dirty in his sight and then we know Lord that we have not even a chance unless we come through the blood of Jesus Christ and then we are the children of God and our mistakes are overlooked as we confess them okay Colossians 2. praise the Lord amen Colossians 2 verse 9. for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and we are complete in him which is the head of all principalities and Power and whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands how is that possible God is doing the circumcising right the Bible talks about circumcising your heart try it are you going to get a knife and cut your heart God Is circumcising Us putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ you see God is doing this buried with him in baptism wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead amen amen and you being dead in your sins and we are right dead in our sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh has he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses remember that first scripture we read God reconciling himself reconciling the world not imputing their trespasses wow in Christ he did that and you being dead in your sins and uncircumcision or your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinances amen blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to the cross oh I would love to be humble and sweet but I just have the wrong genetic makeup right oh I would love not to be hot tempered but I got the wrong I got the wrong flesh body because none of the fault of my own but because I'm flesh and blood amen some of us are smart not if there's no fault of our own some of us are not some of us are are you know we're creative and others we're thinkers people are all different but you see God he realized that and his forgiveness of all your trespasses is the blooding Out means to smear out that means obliterate erase it figuratively pardon sin blatted out wipe it away in the original it says having blotted out what was written by hand in ordinances which was against us that's the Ten Commandments Leviticus all the law he says and has removed it from the midst having nailed it to the Cross you see that law was the enmity that kept you from The Mercy Seat those ordinances is what kept you from finding peace with God but God himself came down and took his own law the ordinances that he had wrote that Moses he had given to Moses and he nailed it to Calvary and fulfilled all of it that I could be reconciled amen and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it amen amen brother Branham says so now in that day God guarded the tree to keep them from getting it and now the sword is turned right back the other way now running them right back to that tree so that they will receive the life driving people hurting them to the Tree of Life how marvelous be ye reconciled amen yeah God has taken care of whatever your fear is God's taken care of it whatever your problems are God is taking care of it your secret things he's taking care of it it's done he became sin so you don't have to die if you can just exchange it just give it to him let's bar heads dear Lord Jesus we're so thankful that the word of reconciliation father it has come to us and we're thankful Lord that you saved us and you you paid the sacrifice that we couldn't pay we didn't have we didn't have a way to take care of all of our sin but he who had no sin came and became sin to set us free and I pray Lord you know just take this simple thought Lord and father that you'll deal with us with it that will dwell on it that will think about it we'll meditate on it and may we see the light of the day may we see that we're truly free you've washed it all away it's gone blotted out just wiped away obliterated praise the Lord You're greatly to be praised you're wonderful you're our counselor you're everything you're our healer you're amen my judge my lawyer you're the police you're you're you're everything The Advocate Lord Jesus we're so thankful for all that you've done for us I just pray that you'll Quicken this word to our hearts in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen amen say that once you're washed into blood it says though you never did that's right but I just wanted to clear that point because amen don't know how to walk in the spirit without the Holy Ghost amen but we don't want to give up trying to be more perfect amen didn't say that amen praise the Lord amen let's Stand Together amen redeemed how
