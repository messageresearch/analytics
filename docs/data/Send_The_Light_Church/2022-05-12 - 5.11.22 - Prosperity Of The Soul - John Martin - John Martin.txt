receive lord i receive lord i receive all things are possible lord i receive amen we're trusting in the lord that we have received tonight amen when we were on vacation we were able to spend a lot of time in the word and we had a number of messages lined up for when we got back and so um after mother's day we just started searching through those and trying to figure out which one that we were going to minister on today and this one looked good and that one looked good but i just couldn't feel that on the inside i don't know this may be just a little bit loud here and so i just do not want to come up at the pulpit not knowing this is what the lord wants it's just scary so i just got neutral as neutral as i could and had it as it were start all over starting tuesday so i didn't have as much time as i wanted to but i i trust in the lord that what he has for us today we can receive it amen let's look to him in a word of prayer our heavenly father we thank you for this time of worship it's time to express our love to you and courses and and these songs lord we love you we want to express that we love you and we can say that we love you because you first loved us you reached down your hand to us and lifted us up out of the world and made us new creatures and has called us to be in your image and we just thank you today that we could gather together with brothers and sisters of light precious faith that you've called just like you've called us lord and you're calling us to a high calling and father uh this evening as we enter into the the ministry of the word the reading of the word and lord these quotes that we we have to read we just pray that not only the inspiration of the holy ghost would fall upon us uh but lord that the revelation of what you're trying to get across to us lord would land upon every heart today we commit the service and you would pray that you'd meet the needs that would be among us for lord you know that we're all going through situations lord we have many uh dependence upon you and we just pray lord that somehow through the ministry that you would just give us faith to know that you've got those things in handled uh today father we thank you for this we ask it all in jesus precious name amen amen turn with me to third john third john and we know third john only has one chapter so that'll be verses one through four we want to talk about prosperity today prosperity that's why i'm wearing my money tie because we want to talk about prosperity the elder unto the well-beloved gaius whom i love in the truth beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospers for i rejoice greatly when the brethren came and testified to the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth may god bless the reading of his word you may be seated any natural man would want to prosper most people end up trying to work hard enough for some kind of of retirement so they don't have to work but they can have enough prosperity to enjoy uh life at the end of their work career we've got some people that have retired do we not and i i would say that it wouldn't hurt those of us that are retired it wouldn't hurt our feelings if we had another couple hundred thousand we wouldn't we wouldn't complain about it that's for sure um but others don't wait till retirement to have extra things so they work harder in life they work smarter and they try to prosper and and some people prosper and honestly some do not few people work rentlessly in order to prosper and there are even some that will go to extremes to prosper they'll do wrong things they'll cheat they'll lie they'll steal the they'll do tax evasions there's a show on tv called the american greed has anybody ever heard about that or seen it and and that's what that's all about the people have tried to take advantage of people and the government just so they could prosper there are some scriptures in the bible that would call for a concern about financial prosperity does the lord want me to prosper is that a good question itself will be an awful quiet today first timothy let's look into it first timothy chapter 6 verse 8 says and having food and remnant let us be there with content but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and too many foolish and hurtful us which drown men in destruction and perdition for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith we're talking about faith in our men's meeting one thing that uh hinders faith is is desiring of of of of riches and pierced themselves through with many sorrows so does god want me to be content or does he want me to prosper i mean personally i don't want to fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lust i don't want to drown in destruction and perdition i don't want to covet after the prosperity of money i i don't want to pierce myself through with many sorrows i i don't want to be a part of that amen maybe i should just be content with food and remnant in luke chapter 18 verse 24 jesus oh and when jesus saw the man was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god so here jesus himself is just talking about the prosperity of riches and how hardly shall they that have him even enter in in james chapter 2 verse 5 hearken my beloved brethren have not god chosen the poor the poor of the world yet rich in faith but he chose the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom of god which he had promised to them that love him so does god want me to be content or does he want me to prosper i need to get this thing straight first timothy chapter 6 verse 17 charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high-minded nor trust in uncertain riches they have wings right they fly away but in the living god who giveth us richly all things to enjoy that they do good that they be rich in good works ready to distribute willing to communicate line up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life now of course all of us here we feel we've gotta we've got a hold of eternal life we've got it that's scary when the scripture is telling us that we need to be fighting the good fight of faith laying hold of eternal life i believe that god wants his children to prosper i believe that he wants us to be content with what he has provided us paul said i have learned in whatsoever state amen therewith to be content job said the lord giveth and the lord taketh away i believe the lord wants us to always be content and he always wants us to prosper well brother john how can we do that at the same time we can be content with what we have while we're prospering so with that being said should we be preaching or believing in a prosperity message prosperity can be a very deceptive subject many people have jumped on the bandwagon of the prosperity gospel some things i've just gotten off the internet if i could read these the prosperity gospel is an umbrella term for a group of ideas popular among charismatic preachers in the evangelistical tradition that equate christian faith with material and particularly financial success faith for the natural wikipedia just defines the prosperity gospel also known as the word of faith movement notice the word of faith well we want the word of faith where the believer is told to use god prosperity theology sees the holy spirit as a power to put to use for whatever the believer wills see how easy it can be deceptive in the 1980s tv evangelion was the promoter of prosperity teaching using terms like just send an offering in and we'll send you a free copy of today's message we'll be it just we'll pray and you could for sure you'll be prospering all sorts of stuff like that was happening and in the 1990s and 2000s it was adopted by influential leaders in the pentecostal movement and charismatic movement in the united states and has spread throughout the world now this is what the wikipedia says not me prominent leaders in the development prosperity theology include e.w kenyon oral roberts a a allen roger robert tilton t.l osborne joe olsteen kofi dollar kenneth copeland reverend eich and kenneth hagin by the way joel olsteen's net worth is estimated at 50 million dollars he knows about the prosperity gospel the preachers associated with the movement have some of the largest congregations and best-selling books in the country and they have host uh television programs that seem to air at all hours all of the night and are some of the most watched programs around the world the prosperity gospel goes by many names word of faith health and wealth name it and claim it this different gospel teaches that god provides rewards including personal happiness financial wealth and physical health for believers who have sufficient faith the preachers of this gospel may quote the word but they twist it to support their false theology by taking passages out of context can you see how deceptive prosperity can be viewed for me for what i believe i would never ever advise seeking to be rich i would never ever advise seeking to prosper without it being the will of god the reason i would never advise seeking to be rich is because i don't believe it's wisdom from above i just don't think that's what god would inspire me to ask for a good example of that would be solomon when the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night and god said ask what i will give thee imagine that god came to you and said ask what i will give thee that sounds scriptural the bible says ask and you and it shall be given solomon could ask for a lot of things he was a young man as young men you got a lot of ideas but his only concern was how he could do his job better for the kingdom of god and i love that he wanted to do his best for god that there was nothing else on his mind now think about that we all got a lot of stuff going on in our life a lot of things i got a lot of things if i got a lot of things you got a lot of things and you got about to put all that aside and focus on one what is that one thing that you want of god first kings chapter 3 verse 10. and the speech pleased the lord and solom uh that solomon had asked this thing and you know the thing that he he asked that he might be able to do his best job for god just the wisdom of what oh of what was needed to help the people because there were so many people you know we could just say there's so many things going on in our life what is that one thing and god said unto him because thou has asked this thing and has not asked for thyself long life neither has asked riches for thyself nor has asked the life of thine enemy but has asked thyself understanding to discern judgment god had given solomon the job of ruling righteously and whatever god has given you to do for the kingdom that needs to be your focus because we're not going to be here long rich or poor amen behold i have done according to thy words lo i have given thee a wise and understanding heart so that there was none like thee before neither shall there be any uh arise like unto thee and i have given unto thee that which thou has not asked i love that both riches and honor so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all the thy days and if thou i this is important for all of us a good lesson here and if thou will walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my commandments as thy father did walk then i will lengthen thy days notice the wisdom from god i would never advise anyone to seek riches the brandon said the message i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision he said not long ago in california some of the armenian people who had all sold out their winery and things sent me a check that amounted to more than a million dollars now that seems like maybe not much now but it was a lot in 1949 and i wouldn't even put my hands upon it i sent it back i'd rather be poor and living in a shack and have favor with god and the feeling that i had i had the satisfaction i love him than all the wealth in the world that the world owns now here is here's the messenger here's a minister that he could give a lot of it uh all of it to missions or you know he could do a lot with this money but notice the attitude that he had in the message faith in the son of god brother bryan says brother sister i had a million and five hundred thou five hundred thousand i'm one million five hundred thousand dollars given to me at one time and refused to put my name on it and told them to take it back that's right and in a message believe us though this brother branham said there was two fbi agents that brought it and he refused to even look at it he said fbi agents brought it to me and i refuse to even look at it i wonder if we got any solomon's here brother branham says i i had twenty five thousand 000 given to me 25 000 given to me in one check at the platform in texas where a man from the texas oil owner there that come up his mother was healed out of the wheelchair they just flew in there and i said sir and i tore the check up right in front of him that's right someone offered me here not long ago i said brother branham uh would you buy uh we'll buy you a nice cadillac to ride i said no indeedy i will never do that i want you to notice the attitude that the prophet has there was a time that brother branham was telling the story about the squirrels coming into existence and hattie wright was there and she wasn't very wealthy she just lived in an old place that had holes in the walls and everything else but she believed the prophet she believed god's prophet and when brother branham told that story she said that is nothing but the truth as if she was there but she wasn't there she just believed it and we can believe it amen the same way and something happened where the spirit of god came on brother branham and said you ask what you will whatever you want god will give it to you and she looked over she she needed money for a lot of different things i mean she lived in a poor house and we did and then sister gabriel brother jonathan says well i'm not even living in a household she was poor very poor but she was interested in the salvation of her two boys it was it was about the soul of her two boys not they grow up with great educations but the salvation as soon as she spoke at that very time the spirit of god of conviction came upon those two boys and they came to her mom and just gave their heart to jesus christ at that moment amen amen i would never advise seeking to prosper without it being the will of god so how do i know it's the will of god the scripture teaches us here in 3rd john chapter 2 beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospers i want to entitle this the prosperity of a soul it seems like what most preachers forget about when they're preaching the prosperity gospel is they leave out the soul part they leave out the prosperity of the soul here in the book of john we discover what god's priority of prosperity is and what ours should be the prosperity of our soul needs to be first too many people have lost focus on what they should be laboring for to prosper we need to be uh we need to be interested in a soul prosperity movement not just a a prosperity gospel but a soul prosperity gospel now i know that's not as interesting to the flesh but it's pleasing to the lord amen our emphasis needs to be on the spiritual and not the natural i think the devils conform so many believers into thinking that well my soul is good enough i'm in good enough shape here now let's just focus on the natural things in other words there's no focus on spiritual prosperity so when i think about prosperity it's real simple if i have a hundred dollars in the bank next week i got 200. that the week after that i've got 300 and there's a prosperity going or if you're you're you're sick and week one goes by and you're feeling better my health is prospering though next week goes by you're you're doing better your your your your health is increasing it's prospering so what about our souls what is the prosperity of our souls is it coming to church and just saying i made it to church and did my part heard more truth luke chapter 12 verse 16. i want to kind of provoke us a little bit amen luke 12 16 and he spake a parabon to them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plenty plentiful and fully and he fought now notice what happened he thought within himself saying what shall i do because i have no room where to bestow my fruits and he said this will i do i will pull down my barns and build greater and there and there will i bestow all my fruits and my goods and i will say to what my soul think about it when you're when you're putting your emphasis on the natural your soul is getting put in the back burner and i will say to my soul soul thou has much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry i'm okay with my soul it's i'm saved i got saved um ten years ago what about the prosperity of that soul that got saved but god said unto him thou flew this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou has provided so is he that laith up treasures for himself and is not rich toward god god's looking at our attitude let's look at laodicea the prosperity revelations 3 verse 17 because thou sayest i am rich and what nothing and knoweth not that thou wretched and miserable poor and blind and naked how many has felt miserable i'll tell you the devil has a way of getting us down doesn't he but i think you know god has some good counsel for us god's counsel for the church is to buy of me gold tried in the fire well that's the very life of christ and that's what makes us rich is christ not just i i know i'm saved and now i just focus on the natural part of my life the lukewarm believer today is going to get spit out of god's mouth and god is is standing at the door of every man's heart wanting to come in and prosper the soul to bring prosperity to the soul not is not satisfied with just getting saved that is not where god is at amen he's interested in prosperity yes our souls need to prosper amen not survive but thrive yes and prosper amen our soul is really who we are these bodies are going to leave and we our soul we the real we need to prosper amen and our pr our souls prosper when we walk in the truth that has been given to us and the truth that he presents to us when you walk in truth that is when your soul will prosper now here's the thing in order to get excited about that you've got to get excited spiritually because it's not going to help naturally amen this is the thing that this this spirit was wrong to begin with trying to to bring in the faith just so we're going to be blessed naturally now i want you to think about this statement everyone that has died in every believer that has died and gone on to be with the lord the majority of them at one time were healed of god can you say amen to that that god had healed them while they were here on earth we could say that that that god prospered their health and healed them but they ended up dying you understand what i'm saying but when your soul is prospered now that don't go backwards that's storing up for the other side and we we forget about that we put the emphasis on what we need here god just wants to be first to seek him first and it's it's really hard to do that the way that we should be doing that right because we feel we're doing that when we come to church but there's so much more to that what was the truth that you heard last month right in the church here right and can you say of a surety yes it's been hurting my flesh but i've been walking in it right or you say i made it to the church there were some good services and so eyes are so prospering i enjoyed the services they were but it's their soul prospering brother branham said in the message who is god talking about our soul he says how do you ever get here how did you ever get here on earth anyhow how's that germ of life ever formed notice it's by the creator god so i want to i just want to go into our soul just a little bit if i could brother branham said in the message believe us thou this he says and friends we know that the germ of life comes from the male sex you are your mother's flesh but you are your father's blood life comes from the male sex so to understand where god's where we want to go with this that god is our husband the church is his wife so the germ of life to the church comes from god amen brother adam talked about the seed of god that that was placed inside of each and every one of us from the very beginning now we didn't know it until it began to germatize right it isn't he all sudden put the the seed there the seed was always there it just wasn't germinated we didn't notice it brother brandon said in his life story he said that's uh that's is like a corn of wheat that fell into the ground there it lies a germ of immortal life that's what's living inside of us jesus said in john 12 24 verily verily i say unto you except a corner wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit so then he says this amazing statement next verse he that loveth his life shall lose it but he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal it's got to be more than a statement right so here a corn or wheat it's got to die or it's never going to bring forth so even though the seed of god was inside of us when we were in the world it couldn't come forth it couldn't come forth or else it would have why because the holy ghost hadn't germinated yet and that was the calling no man can come except the father calls so many are called but few are chosen those that have that seed inside gonna recognize i'm going somewhere here with this there had to be a dying out in our flesh in order to respond we could respond and still hang on to our life we had to give up something now when god first called me he didn't tell me everything i was doing wrong he just told me i was an outright sinner without him i'm going to die so i did the best i could to repent give him everything i had but that wasn't enough he kept telling me you got to take care of this and you got to cut your hair you got to get rid of that world of music you got to stop there smoking it it would seem like non-stop but that's good signs of god amen because he's trying to prosper my soul but the call understand is not just to salvation as we would know it or if i could say it like this it's not just to justification the call wasn't just to justification the call was to become him if the seed of god is in us to be him we can't stop short of that and that's what the devil is trying to put on the church are you with me there will be many believers who never come to full manifestation of christ jesus said not all that say lord lord shall enter in a good good good scripture brother branham said in in the message show us the father and it sufficeth us he said he's talking about the agricultural hour he said it's kind of a little 4-h club now they got a little machine that turns out corn just makes corn the agriculture hour they had it and many farmers are sitting here probably know of it and that machine will run out grain of corn so perfect that you can take a handful out of that sack a a a handful out of the uh the true sack that that is corn and run it out of the machine and uh that has grown in the field and then mix them together and you couldn't tell them apart if you had to one made by the machine one made by god you put them together and he says you couldn't tell them apart if you had to now remember he's talking about christians here and this over here that machine run will make just as good a corn meal as this one will it'll make the same kind of corn flakes you take and cut it open and put them in a laboratory perhaps and the skin under it will look thick under the microscope and the hearts in the right place put it under the analysts and it'll be the same amount of potash and the same amount of calcium and the same amount of moisture just exactly the same he said there's no way in the world of telling him only one way he said bury them bury them the one that's made just rots away that's all there is to it but the one that god made it's got a germ of life in it and it will reproduce itself again not going to come out quarter way not going to be the mini corns or mini wheat mini wheats you know any wheat sir in the message the rapture brother branham says that if you want to put that down it's first corinthians 12 13 and by one spirit we are all baptized and he said that spirit is the life of christ is that right congregation says amen the life of christ which he was the word seed brings the seed of life he says you get it if that life is laying in the seed and this baptism of the holy ghost comes upon it it's bound to bring that seed to life we should have every right to expect christ manifested in our life and if we don't we got to get down in the ground and die out because we got too much of this flesh still living it's not going to stop midstream it's going to keep bringing forth more and more and more because it's that soul that needs to prosper in the message things that are to be brother man says don't stay in the seed go right on out into the perfect part prosperity our souls don't stay there we have a choice we can be church view warmers or we can hold ourselves accountable god's speaking to my heart and i want to prosper in the message of the masterpiece brother branham said the grain seed in the original fell at nicaea for it was the first denomination notice that the life that was in the stock tassel all ends up in the seed the life that comes out of the original seed come out through the different processes three different processes and then turns back to its original condition he said hallelujah oh my i'm the happiest person in the world that god has let me see this watch how perfect the word and this nature works together what brother branham is saying here is that the natural types the spiritual what god does in a a natural corner wheat he does it and he did it through the church ages and we've been taught this through luther through wesley through pentecost through justification sanctification and baptism of the holy ghost we understand that right but this just didn't happen in history with the natural church and we just didn't pop up in the end at the end time message this is a type of what every believer goes through and it doesn't matter if he's in the message or he's not in the message this is a type of the stages of what the true seed of god will go through every one every believer will go through these steps and if he is a seed of god that's germinated he's not going to stop with justification amen his soul is going to prosper it's going to prosper into sanctification it's going to prosper into the holy ghost being sealed by the holy ghost and then after he's sealed he's going to go on amen amen there's more there's more don't come to church without expecting more it's a bad thing to get into you can't ex you can't put your your all your uh emphasis on well if if the music gets me feeling good or if the preacher gets me in that condition of trying harder you can't do that you're gonna miss the message if you've been baptized in the name of jesus christ you've been justified in the sight of god but remember you can't stay there it'll die you will die as sure as anything the seed will never remain in justification it's contrary to the law of god now i'm going to go ahead and try to explain this some of us i believe this will be a blessing for all of us but to show where you can't stay there you'll die well we've heard brother branham said that these denominations this this luther this justification that just shall live by faith this was their message they preached that message and they kept preaching that message and god says whoa whoa whoa well we're turning a quarter we're turning this corner because god's building a building and not a wall so he's telling the church sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost so every one of us needs to be turning corners not us as a group turning a quarter but you as individuals need to be turning corners you need to be building your builder we're a spiritual house built up for for god's inhabits where are you in this process i'm telling you sure is anything if you stop where you're at you will die in this age you will die in the message the pergamos church age here here's what i'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species brings forth of its own kind even according to genesis 1 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass and herbs eating seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was soul whatsoever now whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and thence into fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started in the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it's the same seed we don't want the seed that looks like the seed that doesn't have life we want to the seed to our seed to bring forth life in these last days the true bride of christ christ's seed will come to the headstone and and she will be a super church a super race as she nears him so do we see the day approaching yes amen do we see him they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image i love this this is in order to be united with them they will be one they will be the they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god denominations cannot produce this it's the wrong seed well just for a minute why denominations because they stopped because they stopped because if any denomination would have kept growing in the lord they would have accepted this message that they would have been part of the message because god's message is growing to the statue of a perfect man [Music] and when we get these ideas of just coasting you're not prospering spiritually no matter what the focus is naturally right the true life of christ will move right on through the star through sanctification the life cannot remain in justification it's impossible you would be very unhappy you plant seeds and you hold me tell me does a garden who don't even want to participate in this imagine plowing the garden planting the seeds and none of them coming forth bad well what if they came forth but they only came but they didn't bring forth fruit we'd all be disappointed god's going to be disappointed if we don't bring forth the fruit of the manifestation of christ in their lives so it's not up to the preacher to get us motivated it's not it's not you're in sore condition it's between you and god it's you taking the word that you're hearing and saying i believe it i'm going forward with what i'm hearing that's where it's going to come as you activate your relationship with the lord that's what's going to get you excited amen how can a man stop the law of god it can't if the seed of god is in you you couldn't stop it if you had to it's like a fire shut up in your bones now we're in the age of the full maturity of jesus christ where the nature christ must bring forth it must be in the bride we must start prospering more in our souls focusing on the souls notice what brother branham said about the denominations as soon as they stopped walking they died showing us at any time that the word of god stops in our life we die no i i'm not lutheran enough wesley but if i stop i'm john martin dead call me whatever denomination you want we've got to be coming with anticipation i'm going to become more like christ if that's not there that's the first thing that needs to get done amen we don't want to make the same mistakes as the denominations we won't make the rapture we should be seeking out more truth to walk in amen when we come to church brother brandon said like this we need to come to find out where we're at with god well if every time we come to church oh how do you know that i already know that oh you heard that i already i already already are then what are we here for here for the fellowship here for the music here to appease my conscience that i came to church i mean there's a lot of reasons that the enemy can throw at us but what we need is to start prospering our souls that's between you and the lord it's it's it's a one-on-one it's you and god jesus said in matthew 6 verse 32 for after all these things you the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you you notice god would that you would prosper in health and in all things even as your soul prospers you've got to put the priority on the soul sure we all want to pray it's just a natural thing to prosper in every way but where how many times have we focused in the last week about my soul prospering colossians chapter 3 verse 1 if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ is sitting on the right hand of god set your affections on things above not on the things of the earth and i you know i'm okay with everybody that wants to prosper and use the word to get them to prosper but that just has nothing to do with the soul it has nothing to do about getting ready for a rapture it has nothing to do with the perfect will of god for a man's life god didn't spend time trying to teach lazarus how to be a good businessman we just need to abide in the calling that god's called us i believe in and reaching forth i believe in not uh being under the foot of the devil but i don't believe in using god for me naturally without seeking the prosperity of my soul first i just don't i would feel like a robber i'm robbing god using god i don't want to use god i want to follow this scripture i want to seek first the kingdom then all things added i i want to to to prosper in my soul and and let god trust god for all the needs he says we are dead and your life is hid with christ when christ who is our life shall appear then shall we all he also appear with him in glory christ didn't die for the prosperity of our natural man alone but he died for the prosperity of our souls brother branham said in the message from that time says just remember i'll say this with the faith that i have in that vision whatever it was i'll sp i'll speak it in the name of the lord he said except you have perfect love you'll never be there he said cause nothing could ever be there without it and then he went on to say your spirit would be out of place there because we got this concept that somehow when i die i'm going to be changed i'm going to be so in love with everybody i'm going to be fit for heaven why would that if that's so true then why would the prophet tell us whatever you do lay everything aside that you got going and focus on getting that because that's the prosperity of the soul are you with me amen he said it couldn't come it couldn't come there there'd be no way for it to come no more than it would be for a grain of corn to rise up out of the ground without a germ of life in it no matter how natural it would look it could not rise my friend you owe people you young people you don't know what time you're going to leave we don't know that but let me persuade you as a christian brother that loves you except you're born again and the spirit of god's love comes into your heart you'll certainly miss that place now it's true that we come in here a sinner we repent we get baptized the same day we're justified we're i mean we are on the top page with god but the next day that you live god's going to want you to walk up amen now wherever you're at on your page i'm just asking you to look up what is your next step don't wait for the preacher to persuade you be persuaded in your own self i i am my my heart is fixed i know the direction i'm going i know what image i'm to become and i know what's on my heart when i come to church i want to walk in the truth that's presented to me often we come with so many other needs and so many other things i uh third john verse 1 the elder unto the well beloved gays whom i love and the truth beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper too many people stop right there and be in health they preach their prosperity message but they don't even mention even as they so prosperous some preachers think hey if you're if you're prospering well out here that shows that you're doing good with your soul but that's the way they think and they push the one we need to push our souls for i rejoice greatly when the brethren came and testified to the truth that is in thee that thou even as thou walkest in the truth now notice he's talking about prosperity here it's not a new subject i have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in truth when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you he will lead you and guide you into all truth now i'm not there today i'm not there today so i know that the holy ghost is leading me into more truth amen amen so am i going to be just at ease with my soul cross looking at the other things or am i going to seek to walk in the truth god is able to make all grace abound in her life the more humble we are the more grace is available to us and the more we seek to prosper our souls the more god would have us to prosper in all things it's that simple amen but we've got to be the one to seek the prosperity of our souls just just make the decision don't debate it don't think about it next week just make the decision i'm going to put more attention to the prosperity of my soul whatever i got to do pray more seek the lord more spend more time just get more earnest with god whatever it is god will show you the truth he wants you to walk in amen amen let's stand please walking in more truth is the key to the prosperity of our souls walking in truth have you ever been just sitting at home not in church not listening to a tape not reading your bible not praying and all of a sudden something spoke to your heart that god wanted you to do something that tells me you don't have to be in church to hear the truth it's just being in tune with god amen i think god is calling us to prosper in our souls who knows what he would do otherwise but as long as we're prospering in our souls that's all that matters will be a tool that god can use for his kingdom i wish i had time to get into it but you remember that that this shepherd will leave the 99 sheep and go get that one because that's where his heart is at and he's happier with that one that came in than us 99 sitting here and what's the scripture say the scripture says that heaven rejoices over that one he really don't care how heaven don't care how much money i got don't care what my blood pressure is how healthy i am but he is interested in my soul prospering we got to move on praise god for where we're at yes let's move on to where god's calling us to amen amen let's bow our hearts in a in a word of prayer our gracious heavenly father you have been so good to us lord you have you have kept us we thank you for the keeping power of the holy spirit in our lives we thank you
