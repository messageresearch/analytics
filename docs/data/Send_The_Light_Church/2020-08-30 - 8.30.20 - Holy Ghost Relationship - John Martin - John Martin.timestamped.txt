[3:14] sister ali
[3:16] in
[3:18] her
[3:20] um
[3:21] her love for the lord coming to church

[3:48] let's
[3:50] look to the lord in in prayer at this
[3:52] time
[3:53] our
[3:54] gracious heavenly father
[3:58] we're truly unworthy lord to be
[4:01] holding
[4:03] this
[4:04] child in our hands
[4:07] for lord
[4:09] life
[4:10] comes from
[4:12] you and to think that we're holding
[4:17] the life that you created
[4:23] we're unworthy lord
[4:26] to be holding life that you created
[4:28] today
[4:31] god we know that the enemy would love
[4:34] nothing but to destroy life
[4:37] for
[4:38] when you walked the earth you said he's
[4:40] come
[4:41] to destroy but you come
[4:44] that they may have life
[4:46] and have it more abundantly
[4:49] lord and we pray
[4:51] for little emma jane this morning
[4:58] lord
[4:59] we pray
[5:01] lord that your
[5:03] holy life
[5:05] would be instilled within her
[5:08] from a very early age lord
[5:13] lord that she would
[5:15] stay on the path of righteousness
[5:19] that she would be guided
[5:22] on that straight in narrow that leads to
[5:25] eternal life
[5:27] lord we know that
[5:31] eternal life is a gift
[5:35] but lord it has to be chosen
[5:39] father we just pray that you bless
[5:42] little emma jane spiritually laura that
[5:45] father when she would reach that age of
[5:47] accountability that she would accept
[5:51] you
[5:52] she would choose the right path
[5:56] as this world is growing
[5:58] evil and darker and
[6:01] more horrifying
[6:03] in a much more rapid pace than we've
[6:06] ever seen it before
[6:09] lord i pray
[6:11] knowing that there'll be times that the
[6:14] enemy would like to come in and cause
[6:16] trouble
[6:18] and bring his sickness
[6:21] lord we're asking that you would hear
[6:23] the prayers of these parents standing
[6:25] here
[6:28] lord you are a prayer answering god
[6:32] and thou art no respecter of persons
[6:35] and i pray lord as they
[6:38] take a stand for you
[6:40] that you would stand for their prayers
[6:43] lord whatever they would bring
[6:45] before
[6:46] you that you would hear and answer their
[6:50] prayers
[6:52] and father is
[6:54] lord we're dedicating little emma this
[6:56] morning
[6:58] to you and committing her into your
[7:00] hands and
[7:02] lord we're also praying that you'd bless
[7:04] these parents
[7:07] lord
[7:09] that they would be
[7:11] exactly in the place that you would have
[7:13] them to be
[7:16] father that you would bless
[7:18] their relationship first with you
[7:23] and that you would bless their
[7:24] relationship with one another
[7:28] in god that you would help them through
[7:30] the
[7:31] trying
[7:33] times that they're in oh
[7:35] god you're a mighty god that's able to
[7:38] do extremely above what we're asking

[8:45] and to think that we're
[8:47] the family of god
[8:50] and one day we're going to be eternally
[8:52] together in heaven
[8:56] and there will be no partying from one
[8:58] another
[9:01] i think we're just blessed
[9:03] we're a blessed people this morning that
[9:05] we could come to church and worship the
[9:07] lord and spirit and truth
[9:10] out of all the churches in the world
[9:15] god has sent a message to the bride
[9:20] even to be in a church where the truth
[9:23] is being preached
[9:27] we're blessed
[9:30] we have a chance to worship the lord in
[9:33] spirit and in truth
[9:35] and even though the songs are over the
[9:39] the choruses are over
[9:41] we want to continue to worship the lord
[9:43] amen
[9:44] in spirit and truthful god bless you
[9:47] let's stand together for the reading of
[9:50] god's word
[9:53] i want to say thank you for all your
[9:54] prayers that you have
[9:56] been praying
[9:58] for for my son jonathan from our family
[10:01] and
[10:02] for for ali i mean this young couple
[10:07] um
[10:08] needs
[10:10] god's
[10:11] help
[10:12] grace and leadership
[10:15] and uh
[10:17] when we take a stand
[10:19] for god
[10:20] even though we don't understand
[10:22] everything but when we take a stand for
[10:25] god god will take a stand for us
[10:29] we
[10:30] appreciate
[10:32] our brother
[10:34] tyler
[10:36] sister brooke taking that stand
[10:39] baptism and
[10:42] when we had our bible study this week at
[10:44] the house
[10:46] i kept calling
[10:49] blair
[10:50] emerson
[10:51] kept calling him by his middle name
[10:55] and
[10:58] i think i'm going to know his middle
[11:00] name
[11:02] more than his first name
[11:05] but what
[11:06] a confidence that we can have when we
[11:09] put make take a stand for god god is
[11:11] going to just take care of us
[11:15] it's nothing we have to figure out
[11:17] either he just does it
[11:19] amen so may we all
[11:21] continue
[11:22] our walk with the lord today amen
[11:25] amen we want to
[11:27] preach on the holy ghost relationship
[11:30] this this morning amen let's look to the
[11:32] lord in prayer and then we'll read one
[11:34] verse of scripture our heavenly father
[11:37] we thank you this morning that you've
[11:39] called us together from the north and
[11:40] the south and the east and the west of
[11:43] this little location we gathered
[11:45] together lord called church a place lord
[11:48] that we've dedicated to you years ago
[11:51] that it might be built for the
[11:54] relationship of man to you lord and
[11:57] father we invite that your spirit would
[11:59] come to the ministry of the word lord as
[12:02] it's been prayed as our brother ahmadi
[12:04] had prayed lord that we would be able to
[12:06] step out of the way that you would be
[12:08] able to speak directly to our hearts
[12:11] lord may it be so may there be such a
[12:13] faith in the camp today
[12:15] lord that we would just believe the word
[12:17] of god
[12:18] and and lord there would be no
[12:20] consideration that being a word from a
[12:23] man but lord it would be you and i asked
[12:26] that lord that you would confirm that
[12:27] word by dealing with our hearts and
[12:29] convicting our hearts and and drawing us
[12:32] closer to you father
[12:35] pray that you would give us revelation
[12:37] of this word lord
[12:39] draw us all closer as we commit now to
[12:41] you in jesus name amen
[12:44] amen first corinthians chapter 12 just
[12:47] one verse verse number three
[12:49] wherefore i give you to understand that
[12:51] no man speaketh by the spirit of god
[12:53] call it jesus accursed
[12:55] and that no man can say that jesus is
[12:58] lord
[12:59] but by the holy ghost
[13:01] and god bless you may be seated
[13:04] before i start i just have a question
[13:07] and um
[13:08] i'm going to ask
[13:10] you not to raise your hand at all
[13:14] if you don't really
[13:17] fully be
[13:20] feel what i'm going to ask you because
[13:21] i'm going to ask for a showing of hands
[13:26] but i don't want you to feel obligated
[13:30] i know we're actually missing a number
[13:33] of people here today but
[13:36] i still wanted to do this
[13:39] because this is even though we believe a
[13:41] lot missions
[13:43] here
[13:45] the the heart of
[13:50] of the ministry
[13:52] uh is about building our relationship
[13:54] with god
[13:56] and in the past two months i just have
[13:58] this question the best two months how
[13:59] many feel
[14:01] that your personal relationship with god
[14:05] has been
[14:07] helped
[14:08] because of this ministry here because of
[14:11] coming
[14:12] amen i mean it's so so important because
[14:14] we haven't had much of a five-fold
[14:17] ministry here and we may not for just a
[14:20] little bit even though we believe in it
[14:22] i'm in the reason
[14:24] completely the reason is i'm just trying
[14:26] to use wisdom in the safety of our
[14:28] church
[14:31] but i've kind of this has come to me a
[14:33] number of times these services that
[14:35] we've been having
[14:36] you know god told brother brandon to
[14:38] store up
[14:39] in the storehouse
[14:41] i really feel that's what's been
[14:43] happening here
[14:45] but i i didn't know if it was just me or
[14:47] if if you all felt that way that's why i
[14:49] asked that question
[14:53] a holy ghost relationship god intended
[14:55] from the beginning
[14:57] to have us have a holy ghost
[14:59] relationship
[15:01] with him
[15:03] no man has been willing to have a
[15:05] relationship with god from time to time
[15:07] but mostly under his terms
[15:11] under his
[15:12] spirit we see that with nicodemus
[15:17] we see that with the rich young ruler
[15:20] he wanted to have a relationship with
[15:23] god but just under his terms
[15:25] we see that with the 70 disciples that
[15:28] followed him want to be a part of the
[15:29] ministry until he began to
[15:31] to share more of his word and then they
[15:34] left
[15:35] we see this with the multitudes that
[15:37] followed jesus for one reason another
[15:39] for the loaves to be fed
[15:42] but after a while they left
[15:46] and he was left with his 12 disciples
[15:48] and he says are you going to go too i
[15:50] mean everybody else is leaving the
[15:51] church
[15:54] where would we go lord
[15:56] for thou alone has the words of eternal
[15:59] life
[16:02] we can't
[16:03] have
[16:05] a whole
[16:06] a relationship with god or a holy ghost
[16:10] relationship with god
[16:12] apart from a nature change
[16:15] apart
[16:16] from a new birth
[16:18] and that comes as a result of a holy
[16:20] ghost relationship and that's why we
[16:22] want to talk about this today first
[16:24] corinthians chapter 12 verse 13 says by
[16:26] one spirit we're all baptized into one
[16:30] body of christ
[16:32] we can't get away from this relationship
[16:36] we need the spirit of god amen almost
[16:39] everyone here has a holy ghost
[16:42] relationship
[16:47] and
[16:48] and a carnal relationship with god
[16:54] and we often mix them together
[16:57] but jesus is always separating them
[17:01] because the carnal mind is enmity with
[17:03] god
[17:05] and they that are in the flesh cannot
[17:06] please god
[17:08] first corinthians chapter 2 verse 14
[17:10] says that the natural man receiveth not
[17:12] the things of the spirit of god for they
[17:14] are foolishness unto him neither can he
[17:17] know them because they are spiritually
[17:19] discerned so as long as we're in the
[17:21] flesh we'll never ever ever ever know
[17:24] god ever
[17:26] there hasn't been one man that's ever
[17:29] been in the flesh and has ever known god
[17:32] amen you can't figure out god
[17:35] amen
[17:37] we have the tendency of just blending
[17:39] these two relationships together
[17:42] but god's word
[17:44] separates the two
[17:46] so when brother brandon makes this
[17:48] statement that we've come to church to
[17:49] find out where we're at with god i
[17:51] believe
[17:52] what he's in one way that we could say
[17:54] that we're trying to find out where
[17:56] we're at in our relationship with him
[18:00] amen
[18:03] god separates the carnal from the
[18:06] spiritual relationship
[18:09] we have a spiritual relationship
[18:12] while we're living in the flesh by
[18:14] simply
[18:16] walking in the spirit let's see that's
[18:18] the only way because we're in the flesh
[18:19] we're we're fleshly beings we're natural
[18:22] i i should say we we go about doing our
[18:25] jobs but that doesn't mean our
[18:27] relationship
[18:28] with god is carnal and natural
[18:32] we have to get into the spirit
[18:35] we have to walk in the spirit pray in
[18:37] the spirit worship in the spirit
[18:41] so we don't fulfill the lust of the
[18:43] flesh
[18:44] if we don't do that we can have the
[18:45] tendency of of viewing god in a carnal
[18:49] way
[18:56] we cannot exercise a holy ghost
[18:59] spiritual relationship while walking in
[19:02] a carnal mind amen
[19:05] now we've all been taught that
[19:06] justification which is
[19:08] repentance and baptism i praise god for
[19:10] those who've gotten baptized
[19:13] it is a work of the holy ghost
[19:18] it is god working through the holy
[19:20] spirit in the heart of man that brings
[19:23] him to a place just as if he never done
[19:27] it
[19:32] but
[19:34] if i could say it like this we've also
[19:36] been taught
[19:38] that we can be filled with the holy
[19:40] spirit
[19:41] sealed with the holy spirit
[19:43] and still grieve
[19:46] god
[19:50] so what does that tell us
[19:53] tells us that
[19:54] whatever
[19:55] state we're in our level with the lord
[20:02] whatever we're at in our relationship
[20:04] with god we still have a need for more
[20:07] of the holy spirit in our relationship
[20:10] we still have a need for more of a holy
[20:12] ghost
[20:13] relationship
[20:16] too often people hide behind the
[20:18] thoughts
[20:20] that they have the holy spirit so why do
[20:22] they need to seek after more holy spirit
[20:27] hide behind the thoughts that god has
[20:30] promised that he would never leave and
[20:32] never forsake them so why do they need
[20:34] to seek for more holy spirit that jesus
[20:37] holds them in the palm of their hand and
[20:39] no man can pluck them out so why do i
[20:41] need
[20:43] to seek more of the holy ghost
[20:45] that nothing can separate them from the
[20:47] love of god so why do i need to seek
[20:49] more of the holy ghost
[20:52] because everyone has a holy ghost
[20:55] relationship and a carnal relationship
[20:59] with jesus
[21:01] and when believers find themselves
[21:02] thinking this way they don't realize it
[21:04] at the time but they're exercising their
[21:07] carnal relationship with god
[21:12] don't tell me
[21:14] you don't know what kind of relationship
[21:15] i have with god
[21:18] they're finding an excuse to remain in
[21:21] the state that they're in
[21:26] to be really exercising a holy ghost
[21:28] relationship for every one of us we need
[21:30] to be pressing towards getting more of
[21:32] the holy ghost
[21:33] pressing towards the mark
[21:35] manifesting more of the world not word
[21:38] manifesting more of the word not being
[21:40] satisfied with how much we are
[21:42] manifesting or that we're just saved
[21:46] amen
[21:48] we need to be exercising being steadfast
[21:50] unmovable and always abounding in the
[21:53] work of the lord
[21:54] now this to me is a holy ghost
[21:57] relationship and this is exercising a
[21:59] holy ghost relationship
[22:02] it's not about getting deeper into the
[22:04] knowledge of god
[22:06] it's about getting deeper into the love
[22:09] of god
[22:10] deeper into a holy ghost relationship
[22:13] where you lay down your life for one
[22:15] reason
[22:18] for souls
[22:21] let god use you i'm telling you you
[22:23] place yourself in god's hand and he's
[22:25] not going to make you a wallflower he's
[22:27] not going to make you a vase he's not
[22:29] going to make you a picture he's going
[22:31] to make you a living life that goes out
[22:33] there and fulfills his purpose
[22:37] you know the thing is that
[22:39] without that vision many people perish
[22:44] and we can make our relationship so
[22:46] carnal that the only thing that we
[22:48] really think about is ourselves
[22:52] but we can get trouble with that can't
[22:53] we bring marty
[22:55] brother braham says that's why
[22:58] mission work was always in the will of
[23:00] god he would always stand behind every
[23:02] single person who was trying to break
[23:04] get a soul
[23:07] no i can't say that about anything else
[23:09] in my life nothing
[23:12] even if i go to work
[23:14] because i could be going to work with
[23:15] the wrong attitude
[23:16] the wrong motives
[23:18] but mission work is always the right
[23:21] motive for every one of us
[23:25] we do understand that according to what
[23:27] jesus said when we stand before him to
[23:30] give an account of our relationship
[23:33] that there will be no substitute
[23:36] for complete obedience to the word of
[23:38] god
[23:40] matthew chapter 7 verse 21 so good to
[23:43] hear brother marty
[23:45] i mean
[23:46] when he was at home you couldn't hear
[23:48] any of the amens
[23:51] and i i i really like demons
[23:56] not for me
[23:58] but to know that there's hearts get into
[24:00] the world we really appreciate brother
[24:02] bruce he's like the example of amens
[24:05] amen
[24:07] matthew chapter 7 verse 21 not everyone
[24:09] that saith unto me
[24:12] lord lord
[24:14] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[24:17] but he that doeth the will of my father
[24:18] which is in heaven
[24:20] men who will say to me in that day lord
[24:22] lord
[24:23] have we not prophesied thy name in thy
[24:25] name cast out devils
[24:27] and in thy name did many
[24:29] wonderful works
[24:33] what are they doing here
[24:36] what are they doing by asking this
[24:37] question
[24:39] they're wanting to substitute the using
[24:41] of the name of jesus christ for
[24:44] obedience
[24:46] they're wanting to substitute their
[24:48] terms of the relationship with god
[24:51] they're wanting to substitute their
[24:52] carnal relationship for god's required
[24:55] holy ghost relationship
[25:00] he's not saying no you didn't do those
[25:03] things
[25:05] but those things didn't mean anything
[25:08] because it wasn't a holy ghost
[25:10] relationship
[25:12] you know we get stuck on things
[25:16] many people wanted to see the miracles
[25:18] that jesus did
[25:19] many people want to see the miracles of
[25:21] the prophet
[25:22] people like hearing testimonies of
[25:25] things that god's doing right
[25:28] but who is interested in a relationship
[25:31] that's filled with the holy ghost with
[25:34] god
[25:36] because it brings a man under subjection
[25:38] to the will of god
[25:41] and it's not appealing to the flesh
[25:44] verse 23 but then i will profess unto
[25:46] them i never knew you
[25:52] and resolved is depart from me
[25:54] in this relationship just get away
[25:59] in other words the relationship that
[26:01] people think they have with god today
[26:04] a lot of people it's not correct
[26:07] because they're they're going to church
[26:09] testifying do you know what i did i
[26:10] prayed over this person and just this
[26:12] happened
[26:14] i'm doing all these wonderful works
[26:16] i got this gift that i'm using
[26:20] and the emphasis
[26:22] is on that
[26:23] and not upon the relationship
[26:30] i wonder how many people are using the
[26:32] name of jesus christ this morning and
[26:34] don't even realize
[26:36] though it works has nothing to do with
[26:40] their relationship with god
[26:44] all over the world
[26:46] i question
[26:48] is the relationship that i am presently
[26:50] having with god
[26:54] on my terms
[26:56] or his
[27:01] people don't mind using the name of
[27:03] jesus as long as they can still do what
[27:06] they want to do
[27:10] we understand that jesus wants to be the
[27:13] lord of each and every one of our lives
[27:16] every day
[27:17] and in every way
[27:19] he wants his way
[27:22] not just today
[27:25] john chapter 13 verse 12.
[27:28] so after he washed his disciples feet
[27:30] this is the last supper taken his
[27:33] garments and sat them down he said unto
[27:35] them
[27:36] know ye what i have done to you
[27:39] most the things that god does to us
[27:41] we don't really
[27:43] always know what he does until he shows
[27:46] us and reveals it to us
[27:48] he says you call me master
[27:51] and lord
[27:53] and
[27:55] ye say
[27:56] well in other words you're saying the
[27:57] right thing because i really am
[28:00] right
[28:01] but
[28:03] if i then your lord and master have
[28:06] washed your feet
[28:08] you should do this you should do what i
[28:10] tell you to do
[28:15] because i'm telling you to watch one
[28:16] another's
[28:19] it's too many people want this
[28:21] relationship well i got a relationship
[28:23] with god he's my lord
[28:26] don't want to wash anybody's feet
[28:30] that's not by the holy ghost
[28:33] that's not calling jesus lord by the
[28:35] holy ghost that's your ghost
[28:40] for i have given you an example that you
[28:43] should do as i have done to you
[28:46] amen thank god for the example that he
[28:48] gave us all
[28:50] we can have confidence in the word of
[28:52] god amen
[28:54] one day
[28:56] every single person
[28:58] will bow and confess
[29:00] that jesus is lord of lords and king of
[29:03] kings
[29:04] amen
[29:05] philippians 10 that at the name of jesus
[29:08] every knee should bow of things in
[29:10] heaven and things in earth and things
[29:13] under the earth
[29:14] and that every tongue should confess
[29:16] that jesus christ is lord to the glory
[29:19] of god the father
[29:21] amen now the word confess means fully
[29:24] agree fully acknowledge today people are
[29:27] walking around and
[29:29] they may believe that there is a god
[29:33] some may say jesus he is god
[29:39] but their life is not saying he is god
[29:44] because they're not fully confessing to
[29:47] the word of god to to following the word
[29:51] so it no matter how much they say lord
[29:54] lord
[29:58] they may be saying the right thing
[30:02] but
[30:03] we can only call jesus lord by the holy
[30:07] ghost the only way that he'll accept it
[30:11] he don't want to be accepted
[30:14] with less
[30:21] amen brother
[30:24] god
[30:25] wants
[30:26] to be lord of all of our lives
[30:28] and this is we're all in this boat
[30:30] somewhere
[30:31] this is not like well there's three
[30:34] people in the church
[30:35] you know that are there
[30:37] and the rest of us the message must be
[30:39] for today
[30:40] i'm sorry it's not like that
[30:46] oh you just be honest with yourself just
[30:48] look what happened yesterday
[30:52] just roll back the camera of yesterday
[30:54] think of the thoughts you thought the
[30:56] words you said the actions you did
[30:58] and tell me which one of those were
[31:01] was that all holy ghost
[31:07] think of the many confessing believers
[31:10] of
[31:11] all faiths that are gathering this
[31:13] morning to confess that jesus christ is
[31:16] lord
[31:17] many of them singing he is lord
[31:20] many of them are praying in the name of
[31:22] the lord
[31:23] many will say to me
[31:29] profess to them i never knew you
[31:32] people are missing the boat
[31:35] they're
[31:36] they're missing the required holy ghost
[31:38] relationship this should be the thing
[31:40] that we're focused on
[31:42] that's what our testimony should be
[31:43] that's what we should be striving for is
[31:46] our relationship with god and it has to
[31:48] be a holy ghost relationship it cannot
[31:50] be a carnal relationship
[31:53] it is the only way that god will accept
[31:55] a relationship
[31:57] god is a spirit they that worship him
[31:59] must worship him in the spirit
[32:02] so if we're going to have a relationship
[32:04] with god it has to be in the spirit
[32:07] can't be carnal can't be what we think
[32:09] about god it can't be well i know this
[32:11] is uh what god is because this is what
[32:13] the bible says this is what the preacher
[32:15] says this is what brother brandon said
[32:18] it can't be a knowledge relationship
[32:22] we don't know god through knowledge
[32:25] we know god through faith through
[32:27] revelation
[32:29] upon this rock i'll build my church and
[32:32] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[32:34] against it
[32:38] wherefore i give you to understand that
[32:40] no man speaking by the spirit of god
[32:42] call it jesus accursed
[32:44] so you got the holy ghost
[32:47] you're not going to accuse somebody
[32:50] can't stand in the presence of god and
[32:52] accuse another person
[32:54] it's not the nature of god
[32:57] it's your nature
[32:58] it's a nature we're born with the first
[33:00] time not the second time
[33:04] and that no man can say jesus is lord
[33:07] but by the holy ghost
[33:11] paul had a very carnal understanding of
[33:15] who jesus was before he was converted
[33:18] he thought he knew the lord god almighty
[33:23] but he had to give up all his carnal
[33:26] thinking
[33:27] that day he was
[33:30] riding
[33:32] on his road to damascus amen
[33:35] acts chapter 9 verse 4 and he fell to
[33:38] the earth and heard a voice saying unto
[33:40] him saul saul why persecuted thou me
[33:45] and he said who
[33:47] art thou
[33:49] lord
[33:50] now here's a man that was taught
[33:52] under the greatest men of that day
[33:57] he was more zealous than them all
[34:00] he stuck out above everybody
[34:06] and now he's saying who art thou art
[34:14] just because we feel we know who the
[34:16] lord is
[34:17] you're not the first
[34:20] we're not the first
[34:25] and the lord said i'm jesus whom they'll
[34:27] persecute us it's hard for thee to kick
[34:29] a kick against the pricks i i would
[34:32] think that there's things in her life
[34:34] that we try to get by with
[34:38] and then the lord comes
[34:42] what are you doing
[34:44] what are you doing who art thou lord
[34:47] what do you mean i can't do this
[34:54] philippians chapter 3 verse 10 still
[34:56] speaking on paul here paul
[34:58] wanted
[34:59] to know jesus
[35:02] wanted to know the lord he said oh that
[35:03] i might know him and the power of his
[35:06] resurrection the fellowship of his
[35:07] sufferings being made conformable unto
[35:10] his death if by any means i might attain
[35:12] to the resurrection of the dead
[35:14] paul did not want to know god
[35:18] or to know jesus
[35:20] in the flesh
[35:22] out of curiosity
[35:27] it wasn't that paul didn't know jesus
[35:31] because
[35:32] he had this amazing experience on the
[35:36] road to damascus
[35:39] i mean
[35:40] how many people could say
[35:43] what happened to them is is what
[35:45] happened to paul
[35:48] you know what i'm saying he had this
[35:50] experience where he was literally
[35:52] knocked off his horse he was blinded by
[35:55] the light of god he couldn't see
[36:00] somebody had to lead him away
[36:03] and this was an experience that he had
[36:05] with god
[36:06] he got to a place that his eyes became
[36:09] healed and he could see somebody prayed
[36:11] over him the body did and he received
[36:13] his sight
[36:15] and the bible says that he was he was
[36:17] filled with the holy ghost
[36:21] so he he knew god
[36:27] galatians chapter 1 verse 11 but i
[36:30] certify you brother and that the gospel
[36:32] which i preached of me is not after man
[36:35] for i neither received a man neither was
[36:37] i taught it but by the revelation
[36:40] of jesus christ
[36:42] so
[36:43] paul was all done sitting under the feet
[36:46] of gamalia
[36:47] he was all done he wasn't going to go to
[36:49] the disciples and sit under their feet
[36:51] and say teach me the gospel
[36:54] no he went got serious with god in his
[36:56] home amen
[36:58] his home was in little ways away in
[37:00] arabia
[37:03] he spent some time there seeking god
[37:08] and he got to know jesus by revelation
[37:11] without another human being around
[37:14] today you can be in church hearing these
[37:16] words and receiving revelation from god
[37:20] and i hope you're in the spirit to do
[37:22] that today
[37:25] because he wants to give it to you
[37:28] first corinthians chapter 2 verse 2 for
[37:30] i
[37:32] am
[37:33] determined to know
[37:36] to not know anything among you save
[37:40] jesus christ and him crucified
[37:44] it kind of sounds like to me that paul
[37:46] knew everything
[37:48] about jesus
[37:51] that's all he knew
[37:54] all the revelation he got
[37:57] was from jesus
[37:59] got filled with the holy ghost
[38:01] his own testimonies i don't know nothing
[38:03] among you except jesus christ
[38:06] and yet here he's
[38:08] all that i might know him
[38:12] what was going on here's a man that knew
[38:15] jesus but something inside of him says
[38:18] all that i might know him
[38:21] know him
[38:23] in the power of the resurrection and the
[38:25] fellowship of his suffering why did he
[38:28] want to know him what was going on the
[38:31] holy ghost inside of him was hungering
[38:34] to manifest more of christ
[38:39] to be able to love his enemies
[38:46] to truly intercede in prayer and
[38:48] compassion
[38:50] and love for those that despitefully
[38:52] used him
[38:57] the holy ghost inside was hungering to
[38:59] know god in that measure
[39:02] to know him in the fellowship of his
[39:04] sufferings
[39:06] to know him in the power of the
[39:08] resurrection to be able to manifest the
[39:11] power of god in his life amen
[39:17] we don't believe in a dead religion
[39:22] we don't believe in just carnal words
[39:25] and just some
[39:27] ten commandments on the wall we
[39:29] follow brother branham
[39:33] we believe in the power of god that
[39:35] changes a man's nature
[39:37] it's got to change his nature
[39:46] that
[39:49] is the holy ghost that i want to see in
[39:51] our lives
[39:53] one where we cannot be satisfied with
[39:55] salvation
[39:57] one where we can't be satisfied that i'm
[39:59] in a church that preaches the truth
[40:03] but i'll not be satisfied to awaken his
[40:06] likeness
[40:08] that's the holy ghost that we need
[40:10] that's the holy ghost relationship that
[40:13] we're looking for
[40:15] that i might know him in the power
[40:18] of his resurrection the fellowship of
[40:20] his
[40:22] sufferings romans chapter 8 verse 11 but
[40:25] if that same spirit of him that raised
[40:28] up jesus from the dead dwells in you
[40:30] he that raised up christ from the dead
[40:32] shall also quicken
[40:34] in your mortal body by the spirit that
[40:38] dwelleth in you
[40:41] a quickening
[40:45] a holy ghost relationship quickens us
[40:49] look at the very next verse therefore
[40:51] brethren
[40:52] we are debtors
[40:55] not to our flesh
[40:57] to live after our flesh
[41:00] for if we live after our flesh
[41:03] we're going to die
[41:05] but if we through the spirit
[41:12] uh
[41:15] the john martin version of mortified
[41:20] the deeds of the body
[41:22] we shall live amen raw there and as long
[41:27] as we got breath in our lungs we need to
[41:28] mortify the deeds of our flesh
[41:31] i'll tell you today this flesh wants to
[41:35] rise up just as much as it did at the
[41:37] beginning
[41:39] [Music]
[41:43] we can never escape it right
[41:48] can i ever take the oars out of the
[41:49] water
[41:51] can never say i'm there i've attained
[41:55] we got to keep pressing on
[41:59] a holy ghost relationship god does not
[42:02] want a carnal relationship with his
[42:04] bride
[42:05] god's intentions from the beginning was
[42:07] to have a holy ghost relationship with
[42:09] man
[42:11] we understand that when god created man
[42:14] originally he created man in his own
[42:16] image
[42:19] not naturally
[42:21] but spiritually
[42:23] he had the very nature that god had
[42:26] inside of him
[42:28] god created man to love god back with
[42:32] the same love that he loved him with
[42:35] it was part of the nature
[42:37] god wanted to feel loved
[42:40] the same way that he loved
[42:42] them this love was shed abroad in their
[42:45] heart by the holy ghost
[42:49] in other words to love god the same way
[42:51] that he loves us
[42:55] it requires a holy ghost relationship
[42:59] it takes the spirit of god in us we
[43:01] cannot love god in our own feelings our
[43:04] emotions and our natural well he's just
[43:07] been so good to me
[43:10] how many people do you know they've said
[43:12] that you know god is good god and they
[43:15] name off all these things that god did
[43:17] for them
[43:18] but they ain't got enough holy ghost in
[43:20] their life to lay down their life for
[43:21] anybody
[43:25] so it is not a carnal natural love we
[43:28] could love god every day brother brandon
[43:30] said we could still miss it
[43:33] so we need to love god with his love
[43:40] that love and man was to be proven by
[43:43] the keeping of god's word
[43:46] the keeping of his commandments
[43:49] if you love me keep my commandments
[43:52] and do not partake of the tree of
[43:54] knowledge of good and evil
[43:57] for in the day that you partake of it
[43:59] you shall surely be separated from me
[44:02] from the holy ghost relationship that
[44:05] we're having
[44:06] in fact he said you'll surely die
[44:10] as long as adam and eve obeyed god's
[44:12] will they were a perfect there was a
[44:16] perfect holy ghost relationship they
[44:17] were in perfect harmony with god
[44:20] god brother and said god would come down
[44:22] in the cool the evening
[44:24] and he would just share his presence
[44:26] with them and fellowship with them and
[44:28] it was just a beautiful thing
[44:33] but when man injected his will now this
[44:36] is important when he injected his will
[44:39] instead of god's will into the
[44:41] relationship
[44:42] god separated them from his presence
[44:46] they were no longer having a holy ghost
[44:50] relationship yes amen generation
[44:53] generations
[44:56] genesis
[44:57] same three letters
[44:59] but
[45:00] a totally different word
[45:02] the beginning the sea chapter verse
[45:04] number 22 genesis chapter 3 verse 22 and
[45:06] the lord god said behold the man has
[45:10] become as one of us to know good and
[45:12] evil now lest he put forth his hand
[45:16] and take also the tree of life and eat
[45:18] and live forever
[45:20] therefore the lord god sent him
[45:22] forth from the garden of eden to till
[45:25] the ground where he was taken
[45:27] so he drove out man and placed him at
[45:29] the east of the garden of of eden
[45:32] cherubins and a flaming sword which
[45:34] turned everyway to keep the way of the
[45:37] tree of life
[45:40] so their holy ghost relationship
[45:44] got severed yes
[45:48] and even though they wanted to come back
[45:50] they couldn't
[45:52] [Music]
[45:57] god from the beginning is intended that
[46:00] a relationship would only be a holy
[46:01] ghost relationship
[46:06] it was not god's will for man to partake
[46:08] of the tree of knowledge of good and
[46:09] evil
[46:11] but when man made his choice
[46:15] to investigate it
[46:18] because he really didn't know
[46:20] she didn't know
[46:21] a lot about it
[46:23] just enough to what was enticing but
[46:25] didn't know everything
[46:27] that's why she could say
[46:30] he enticed me
[46:32] every one of us that fall in sin
[46:36] so often we're enticed by the devil we
[46:38] don't realize until it's late we were
[46:40] tricked
[46:42] are you with me can you say amen to that
[46:44] it's the truth
[46:48] and man is still making that choice
[46:51] today
[46:52] to investigate the tree of knowledge of
[46:54] good and evil
[46:56] it's amazing to me how much satan wants
[46:59] us to partake
[47:02] of it amen
[47:07] it's okay if you go to church
[47:09] okay if you read your bible it's okay
[47:11] you want to believe the message okay you
[47:12] want to pay your tithes
[47:16] as long as you partake of the tree of
[47:18] knowledge
[47:26] brother branham said man's first
[47:28] had to reject the truth before he could
[47:31] partake
[47:32] of a lie
[47:36] in other words he first disbelieved
[47:38] god's word
[47:40] before he partook
[47:42] of what satan had
[47:44] available to him
[47:46] that's
[47:47] on that basis
[47:48] is why brother branham could say the
[47:51] only sin is unbelief
[47:54] and everything else is just an attribute
[47:56] of not believing the word of god
[47:58] amen
[48:01] amen now there were two trees in the
[48:03] garden
[48:04] life and death right
[48:11] we're not ready for this yet but you can
[48:13] stay there
[48:14] hold on to it i had andy before service
[48:17] put something up for us to kind of give
[48:19] us a little visual
[48:23] i'd like to give you the definition of
[48:25] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[48:28] this tree
[48:30] was the birth
[48:31] of self-will
[48:37] it's the birth of self-will
[48:42] its propaganda was self-will
[48:45] its fruit bore seeds of self-will
[48:49] that were planted in the heart of man
[48:52] to do self-will
[48:54] and self-will always takes us away
[48:58] from god's will
[49:00] now this is what's really important
[49:02] because we want to do our will and have
[49:05] still have a relationship with god but
[49:07] you cannot amen
[49:10] amen
[49:12] and that's what satan was trying to give
[49:15] eve oh god does know you're going to be
[49:17] just like him you're going to be buddies
[49:20] this is still okay
[49:26] having the knowledge
[49:29] of god's good will
[49:31] and choosing
[49:33] to do
[49:34] your own will
[49:36] which is evil
[49:38] that's what the tree is
[49:41] having the knowledge
[49:43] of what's right
[49:44] and making a choice to do what you want
[49:46] to do
[49:49] that tree is just as live today as it
[49:51] was in the garden
[49:56] it's not one of those spooky things that
[49:59] oh
[49:59] oh my that evil devil oh
[50:03] that tree of knowledge it comes no
[50:06] it's so enticing it's so beautiful you
[50:08] can have your will you can do what you
[50:10] want to do
[50:16] the choices here the two trees
[50:20] life
[50:22] and death
[50:29] cool keep them going just let them fly
[50:31] revelation
[50:33] knowledge
[50:35] love
[50:36] love less i didn't want to put hate
[50:39] god's will
[50:41] or your will
[50:45] your will is to love god less
[50:48] your will is to be
[50:50] satisfied with the knowledge we don't
[50:52] need revelation
[50:54] but your will will always bring forth
[50:56] death amen
[50:58] god's will
[50:59] god is love
[51:01] to love him first to love the lord thy
[51:03] god with all thy heart with all thy soul
[51:05] with all thy might
[51:06] to have so much you just love your
[51:08] neighbor the same way
[51:10] you lay down your life for your enemy
[51:13] that's his way a love relationship a
[51:16] holy ghost love relationship
[51:20] god's will
[51:23] can only be received by revelation
[51:27] truly
[51:28] because he hid it from the wise and the
[51:30] prudent
[51:33] and he reveals himself to those he calls
[51:36] them babes i'll just say it like those
[51:38] the simplicity of somebody who wants a
[51:40] relationship
[51:45] a a child
[51:48] who
[51:49] hasn't reached that age of
[51:54] don't know the proper word to say in
[51:56] church but one where
[51:58] uh he hasn't reached that age where he
[52:00] thinks he knows more than his parents
[52:04] and he kind of depends on his parents
[52:07] doesn't want his parents to leave
[52:10] wants to hold their hand wants us to
[52:12] just stay with me i need you
[52:15] a dependency
[52:22] but a person who's like well i can do it
[52:25] my way
[52:27] i'm gonna have my own relationship with
[52:29] god it's between me and god
[52:33] will you leave
[52:35] that
[52:36] babe
[52:39] that that
[52:42] receiving
[52:44] god's word the sincere milk of the word
[52:49] because you already got it figured out
[52:50] and i'll tell you what that the attitude
[52:52] you stop revelation
[52:55] with that spirit you stop revelation
[52:57] because he resists the proud and he
[53:00] gives grace to the humble
[53:02] and to me revelation is grace
[53:05] you can't force it to happen you can sit
[53:07] in church forever and still never
[53:09] receive it
[53:10] but you just come once with a humble
[53:12] heart and god will reveal to you more in
[53:14] five minutes and you can learn in a
[53:15] lifetime
[53:16] amen
[53:17] god's will is the only
[53:19] way to eternal life
[53:23] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[53:25] has always
[53:27] bore the fruit of self-will
[53:30] in the heart of man
[53:33] for it is and always has been the mark
[53:36] of the beast
[53:39] so we're in genesis let's go to
[53:40] revelation chapter 13.
[53:43] you know this is the end time that we're
[53:44] living in and people are like
[53:47] you know starting to think more about
[53:48] the end time
[53:50] of course these some there's some people
[53:51] that are so lost in
[53:54] the world out there hatred and things
[53:56] are
[53:56] they're just messing things up terrible
[53:58] they're not even thinking about
[54:00] anything outside of this world
[54:04] revelation chapter 13 verse 14 now the
[54:07] devil he deceiveth them that dwell on
[54:09] the earth by the means of those miracles
[54:10] which were which he had power to do in
[54:13] the sight of the beast saying to them
[54:16] that dwell upon the earth that they
[54:18] should make an image to the beast
[54:22] which had the wound by the sword and did
[54:24] live
[54:26] he had power to give life unto the image
[54:28] of the beast
[54:29] that the image of the beast should both
[54:31] speak and cause as many as would not
[54:34] worship the image of the beast should be
[54:36] killed
[54:37] and he calls us all both small and great
[54:39] rich and poor bond and free to receive a
[54:41] mark in their hand or in their forehead
[54:44] and that no man might bow to buy or sell
[54:46] save he that had the mark or the name of
[54:48] the beast or the name of his number
[54:52] or the number of his name excuse me
[54:54] here is wisdom homie wants wisdom
[54:58] let him that have understanding count
[55:02] the number of the beast for
[55:04] it is the number of a man
[55:08] beast man same thing same number
[55:13] and his number is
[55:14] six hundred
[55:15] three score and six now think about this
[55:19] when god created man
[55:21] in his image
[55:24] he created him in his image
[55:27] he was above all the beast
[55:31] he was above every one of them
[55:34] but because of
[55:36] what happened in the garden causing
[55:38] every man to be born with the nature of
[55:42] self-will that's right
[55:45] he now
[55:47] became the same number as the beast
[55:52] yes
[55:54] peter calls him
[55:55] brute beast
[55:57] amen second peter chapter 2 verse 10.
[56:01] second peter chapter 2 verse 10 but
[56:02] chiefly them that walk after the flesh
[56:07] in the lust of uncleanness and despise
[56:09] government
[56:10] presumptuous are they self-willed
[56:15] they are not afraid to speak evil of
[56:17] dignities
[56:18] yes whereas the angels which are greater
[56:21] in power might bring aurelian accuration
[56:23] against them before the lord but these
[56:26] as natural brute beasts
[56:30] made to take and destroy speak evil of
[56:32] things which they do not understand
[56:34] which understand not shall utterly
[56:36] perish in their own corruption
[56:41] when man fell he became a brute beast by
[56:44] nature amen
[56:47] which is simply a physical
[56:50] irrational and
[56:52] unreasonable animal
[56:56] he's got his own will
[56:59] he's just going to do what he wants to
[57:00] do
[57:02] so god looks at him as a brute beast
[57:07] so reason we have to be born again yes
[57:09] amen
[57:12] the reason we have to have a nature
[57:13] change
[57:16] romans 8 verse 7 because the carnal mind
[57:18] is enmity against god for it is not
[57:20] subject to the law of god neither indeed
[57:22] can be so then they are in the flesh
[57:24] cannot please god
[57:26] [Music]
[57:28] we must be born again and get back to
[57:31] the holy ghost relationship how many
[57:33] people in that beast nature are trying
[57:36] to have a relationship with god
[57:42] it's crazy
[57:45] see
[57:46] inside a man they all want there's
[57:48] something that wants to know
[57:52] god but they're not willing to give up
[57:55] their
[57:56] their self-will right amen
[57:59] and satan says you don't have to give it
[58:01] up you can still know god you can still
[58:03] make it to heaven that is hogwash i'm
[58:05] here to tell you that will never work
[58:10] if jesus said you must be born again you
[58:12] must have a new nature change there's no
[58:15] and if about it
[58:18] we need the new birth amen
[58:21] first peter chapter 1 verse 22 amen
[58:26] seeing you purified your souls and
[58:28] obeying the truth
[58:31] praise god
[58:33] i'll say today this is
[58:38] what brother tyler and sister brooke
[58:40] have done and brother ben
[58:45] they're purifying their souls and
[58:46] obeying the truth they're obeying the
[58:48] truth they've repented they've gotten
[58:50] baptized
[58:51] i have to say that this
[58:53] is oh purifying your souls
[58:57] and i'll say every one of you that hears
[58:59] the word of god and you take correction
[59:01] to the word of god you are purifying
[59:03] your souls today
[59:05] it's not just in baptism
[59:07] but every time we come to church i'm
[59:09] telling you god's got an eye on you
[59:12] his word is a discerner the thoughts
[59:14] intents of our heart and he's constantly
[59:16] separating the carnal relationship that
[59:19] we're having with him to the spiritual
[59:21] relationship
[59:26] being borned again
[59:28] being born again not
[59:30] of
[59:31] corruptible seed
[59:33] amen
[59:35] we were born originally by a corruptable
[59:37] seed yes
[59:39] that's why we have to be born by an
[59:42] incorruptible seed which is what the
[59:45] word of god which liveth and abideth
[59:48] forever i say friends today when you
[59:50] hear the word of god you say amen from
[59:53] your heart the born-again experience is
[59:56] happening and you don't even know it
[1:00:00] it's not a feeling
[1:00:02] it's not an emotion
[1:00:04] it's not something where you're just
[1:00:07] whoa
[1:00:08] everybody sees it it's dropped by
[1:00:10] drought sometimes
[1:00:11] it's word by word here a little there a
[1:00:14] little
[1:00:15] but you begin to manifest more and more
[1:00:17] of the word
[1:00:19] because you've been born by the word
[1:00:22] it's not a one-shot deal
[1:00:25] it wasn't over when i got baptized
[1:00:31] still going on
[1:00:34] when i get up early to read the word
[1:00:36] it's going on
[1:00:39] but you know what else is going on
[1:00:47] satan
[1:00:49] want me to exercise a carnal
[1:00:51] relationship with
[1:00:54] god a non-holy ghost relationship
[1:01:01] that's claiming god
[1:01:03] without the holy ghost obedience
[1:01:09] and that's the battle amen
[1:01:16] lord help us
[1:01:19] amen being born again another credible
[1:01:20] seed but incorrupted by the word of god
[1:01:21] we're serving by forever for all flesh
[1:01:24] is as grass
[1:01:25] and all the glory of man is the flower
[1:01:27] grass the grass withereth and the flower
[1:01:29] thereof fadeth and
[1:01:31] there are falls away
[1:01:34] but the word of the lord endure forever
[1:01:37] and this is the word which by the gospel
[1:01:41] is preached unto you
[1:01:44] we don't have to wonder
[1:01:46] where the truth is at
[1:01:49] we don't have to go outside this door
[1:01:51] and go look for something
[1:01:59] just have ears to hear what the spirit
[1:02:01] is saying to the church
[1:02:07] god's interested
[1:02:09] in our souls and god's interest in his
[1:02:10] relationship with you
[1:02:15] how many times
[1:02:17] did you want to give something to your
[1:02:19] son or your daughter
[1:02:22] but you wouldn't give it to them until
[1:02:24] they were first willing to obey this
[1:02:26] simple little thing you wanted to do
[1:02:28] first
[1:02:30] their only interest is what they wanted
[1:02:34] but you had a greater interest in giving
[1:02:36] them what you wanted you want to know if
[1:02:37] they could be faithful
[1:02:42] sometimes you're here
[1:02:44] to learn how to be faithful to him
[1:02:48] maybe not what you're wanting to come to
[1:02:50] church for maybe not what you're
[1:02:52] interested
[1:02:53] but this is what your heavenly father is
[1:02:55] looking first
[1:02:58] amen second corinthians chapter 5 verse
[1:03:00] 14. as we're
[1:03:03] closing
[1:03:06] we're in the closing
[1:03:08] we didn't close yet
[1:03:11] jesus said he's coming soon 2000 years
[1:03:13] ago
[1:03:21] jesus suffered and died for you
[1:03:25] amen that you could have a holy ghost
[1:03:28] relationship
[1:03:30] that the holy ghost could come back on
[1:03:32] you
[1:03:33] he paid that price
[1:03:34] now it's up to us
[1:03:38] to press into that
[1:03:41] i believe the book the hebrews tells us
[1:03:44] that there remains a rest for the people
[1:03:46] of god
[1:03:47] there is a a living
[1:03:50] word of god called the holy ghost
[1:03:53] that can live inside of us
[1:03:56] and we can be at peace of everything
[1:03:58] else that's just going on chaotic in the
[1:04:00] world
[1:04:02] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 14
[1:04:04] for the love of christ constrains us
[1:04:08] because we thus judge that if one died
[1:04:11] for all then we're all dead
[1:04:14] jesus died suffered for us
[1:04:19] and that he died for all
[1:04:22] that they which live should not
[1:04:23] henceforth live unto themselves
[1:04:26] but unto
[1:04:28] him which died for them and rose again
[1:04:30] right amen
[1:04:32] here's the turning point now
[1:04:35] when we live for ourselves
[1:04:37] we're exercising
[1:04:39] our carnal relationship with god
[1:04:45] when we recognize i'm in debt to him
[1:04:48] i don't own my life anymore you're
[1:04:50] exercising your holy ghost relationship
[1:04:53] with him
[1:04:56] wherefore henceforth know we no man
[1:04:58] after the flesh yeah though we have
[1:04:59] known christ after the flesh yet now
[1:05:02] henceforth know we him no more
[1:05:05] paul could say this
[1:05:09] therefore if any man be in christ
[1:05:14] he is a new creature he has gone back to
[1:05:16] the image of god
[1:05:18] amen
[1:05:19] old things are passed away
[1:05:21] behold all things have become new
[1:05:24] and all things are of god
[1:05:28] who reconciled us to himself by jesus
[1:05:30] christ
[1:05:32] god has reconciled us back to him
[1:05:36] wherefore i give you to understand that
[1:05:38] no man speaking by the spirit of god
[1:05:40] called jesus accursed and no man say
[1:05:44] that jesus is lord but by the holy ghost
[1:05:48] if you want god to recognize the
[1:05:51] fullness of the meaning when you call
[1:05:53] him lord
[1:05:55] walk in the light of the word that he's
[1:05:58] given your heart
[1:06:03] because it's not him that say lord lord
[1:06:05] but it's him that doeth the will
[1:06:09] amen let's stand together
