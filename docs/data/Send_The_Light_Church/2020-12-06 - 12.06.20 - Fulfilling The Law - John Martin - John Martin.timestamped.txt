[2:54] but to fulfill for verily i say unto you
[2:57] till

[3:01] shall in no
[3:02] wise pass from the law till all be
[3:05] fulfilled
[3:07] whosoever therefore shall break one of
[3:09] these least commandments
[3:11] and shall teach men so he shall be
[3:14] called the least in the kingdom of
[3:16] heaven but whosoever
[3:19] shall do and teach them
[3:22] and shall be shall be called great in
[3:25] the kingdom of heaven
[3:28] for i say unto you that accept your
[3:31] righteousness
[3:33] shall exceed the righteousness of the
[3:36] scribes
[3:37] and the pharisees ye shall in no wise
[3:41] or no case enter into the kingdom of
[3:44] heaven
[3:46] and god bless you may be seated
[3:55] this morning we received a call about 10
[3:59] minutes after brother
[4:00] from brother boaz uh
[4:05] just before his dad or just after his
[4:07] dad had passed away
[4:09] so we want to pray for uh
[4:14] the family of brother prakash as they
[4:17] are
[4:19] going through a very hard time
[4:22] his daddy had passed away and he
[4:26] they labored together in the gospel
[4:29] and it's a hard thing as as the chanult
[4:32] family
[4:33] and the mead family and that the
[4:35] children are
[4:36] are suffering and will be suffering
[4:40] for a period of time and and perhaps to
[4:43] some degree with thoughts
[4:45] for until the lord comes but god
[4:49] is is able to bring a comfort and a
[4:52] sustaining power
[4:54] and let's just pray for the the family
[4:56] that god will be with him i
[4:58] appreciate your prayers for brother dan
[5:01] basicowski
[5:02] his liver is failing
[5:05] and he is not a candidate for a liver
[5:08] transplant so
[5:11] we're definitely in trying times
[5:14] and the hour is late we just need to we
[5:17] need one another we need to pray for one
[5:19] another
[5:20] hold one another up in prayer
[5:24] we need god in this hour amen
[5:27] before we get into the message i just
[5:30] had some
[5:30] thoughts on my heart this morning that i
[5:32] wanted to share
[5:34] and there's been a big uh spike
[5:38] in the colvit virus and it's again as
[5:41] this thing
[5:42] escalates fear seems to find
[5:46] its way with this virus as we're all
[5:50] aware that this virus is real
[5:53] it's unpredictable and it has
[5:56] monstrous capabilities
[6:00] the virus has also been a perfect
[6:04] betting ground for fear
[6:07] it is like this virus has opened the
[6:10] door
[6:10] for fear to capitalize on in the
[6:13] situation
[6:16] the bible teaches us that fear is a
[6:19] spirit
[6:20] of evil torment as we know god has not
[6:24] given us the spirit of fear but a power
[6:26] and love
[6:27] and of a sound mind it's two different
[6:30] spirits
[6:31] yet the spirit of fear
[6:35] is all around us fear
[6:39] wants us to believe in something that is
[6:42] not for us now think about that
[6:44] fear wants us to believe in something
[6:46] that's not for us
[6:49] the virus is real it's a sickness and
[6:52] the prophet
[6:53] taught us that uh sicknesses cancer
[6:57] is a spirit and the devil is using the
[7:01] effects of this virus to get people to
[7:04] believe in something
[7:05] that's not for them
[7:08] fear is a manipulator
[7:13] job is a good example of this he had
[7:16] uh or i should say
[7:21] jonah jonah i don't know why i wrote job
[7:26] but i'm sure job went through a lot of
[7:29] fear once
[7:30] something when he started losing his
[7:32] family
[7:33] i mean i think the devil came and said
[7:35] you're going down the tube
[7:40] but jonah is is a good example of this
[7:42] also he lacked
[7:43] oxygen because he was wearing a mask of
[7:46] seaweed and vomit
[7:49] and his stomach fluids were all around
[7:52] him
[7:53] it was a real situation
[7:56] to jonah and if anyone could identify
[8:00] with it
[8:00] it would have been jonah the spirit of
[8:03] fear was
[8:04] telling jonah that he had gone too
[8:07] far it was over for him
[8:11] this was going to be the end of him
[8:14] there was no more light at the end of
[8:16] the tunnel you reach the end
[8:19] so it was a real situation but he chose
[8:22] not to allow the spirit of fear
[8:24] to direct his life
[8:28] he called the spirit of fear a lying
[8:31] vanity and to observe it or to listen to
[8:35] it
[8:35] would mean forsaking his own personal
[8:39] mercies
[8:41] god has mercy for every one of us
[8:44] god is rich in mercies and i want each
[8:48] of you to keep
[8:48] focused on the lord
[8:51] the lord is with us regardless of the
[8:54] situation
[8:56] he promised never to leave us never to
[8:58] forsake us that he would be with us
[9:00] in every situation right to the end
[9:06] david said in psalms 23
[9:09] 3 he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in
[9:12] paths
[9:13] of righteousness for
[9:16] his name's sake so
[9:19] the holy spirit is leading us in paths
[9:22] of righteousness but look at this
[9:24] next verse in this path that he's
[9:27] leading you in
[9:29] you're going to walk through a valley
[9:33] of shadow of death
[9:36] and yea though i walk through the valley
[9:38] of shadow of death i
[9:39] will fear no evil for thou art with me
[9:44] and thy rod and thy staff they are the
[9:47] ones that comfort me
[9:51] so like jonah david clearly
[9:55] made a choice not to enter entertain
[9:58] a spirit of fear
[10:03] if you know god is with you you
[10:06] are his child you know god's with you
[10:08] right here
[10:13] if the spirit of god is with you why
[10:15] fear
[10:16] if the spirit of power and love and of a
[10:19] sound mind is with you
[10:20] why fear
[10:25] see fear is a manipulator
[10:29] and it wants you to believe in something
[10:31] that's not for you
[10:34] because when you fear you can't have
[10:37] faith
[10:41] now we all have a choice
[10:45] as we're walking through this valley of
[10:47] the virus
[10:50] choose not to fear
[10:54] choose not to fear
[10:57] you remember as the devil speaks to you
[11:01] and says all types of things to you make
[11:05] a choice
[11:06] not to fear
[11:09] you can't stop the devil from flying
[11:12] but you can stop them from coming and
[11:15] painting a big old
[11:16] nest in your head telling you this big
[11:19] story
[11:20] this is for you this is for you no it's
[11:23] not for me
[11:26] choose to keep your mind focused
[11:30] on the lord i'm not saying
[11:33] it's mind over matter but keeping your
[11:37] mind on christ will keep your mind
[11:39] in peace
[11:45] verse 5 thou preparest a table before me
[11:48] in the presence of my enemies thou
[11:51] anointest my head with oil
[11:53] and my cup runeth over
[11:56] god is still going to take care of us
[11:59] right
[12:00] in the middle of this fearful virus
[12:04] he's still going to take care of us he's
[12:07] still going to feed us
[12:09] he's still going to anoint us he's still
[12:11] going to make our cup
[12:12] to run over right in the presence of our
[12:16] enemy
[12:19] keep focused on the lord that's the
[12:22] message we have a rock
[12:28] moment by moment make a
[12:31] conscious decision
[12:36] you're not allowed to take an hour
[12:40] and give it to fear and expect your mind
[12:43] to be at peace after that hour
[12:48] you can't allow your mind to wander in
[12:50] the enemy's camp
[12:53] you can't allow any old thoughts in your
[12:54] mind you've got to keep it
[12:56] stayed on the lord isaiah
[12:59] 26 3 thou will keep him
[13:02] in perfect peace whose mind
[13:06] is stayed on thee because he trusteth
[13:10] thee the more you think on god
[13:13] the more you'll be able to trust the
[13:15] lord
[13:17] and the greater your trust will grow
[13:20] but you have to make the decision i'm
[13:22] going to stay here
[13:24] with the lord you just can't allow your
[13:28] mind to go anywhere
[13:29] and then expect to be kept in peace
[13:34] it's a battle we're in a battle
[13:38] and we're not denying what's out there
[13:40] we're just taking sides
[13:43] we're taking sides in our mind where
[13:45] we're going to be where we're going to
[13:46] stand how we're going to
[13:48] view this i believe there's mercies for
[13:50] me
[13:51] i believe there's grace for me i'm going
[13:54] to stay here
[13:54] i don't got the answers out there for
[13:56] everything in every situation
[13:58] friends i don't got it
[14:03] but i'm just going to do what the lord
[14:04] wants me to do
[14:06] make the choice to keep your thoughts on
[14:08] the lord he is
[14:09] your rock
[14:13] all other thoughts are sinking sin
[14:18] amen well this morning we want to talk
[14:21] on fulfilling the law
[14:28] many people don't want the law
[14:32] they're against the law they view the
[14:34] laws do's and don'ts it was what put
[14:36] them
[14:36] in prison and grace is what set them
[14:39] free
[14:41] therefore many people think that the law
[14:43] was done away with or it was destroyed
[14:45] when jesus came
[14:48] but jesus said one jot or one
[14:51] title shall in no wise pass away
[14:54] till all be fulfilled
[14:57] none of the commandments shall be done
[15:00] away with
[15:02] amen all the law has to be fulfilled
[15:07] so we don't want to think that it's okay
[15:11] to break to break even the least of
[15:14] god's commandments
[15:16] we don't want to think like that we
[15:18] don't want to teach or express
[15:19] it it's not a big deal because we've got
[15:22] grace
[15:24] come on jesus said that the law is
[15:28] so important that except your
[15:30] righteousness shall exceed
[15:31] the righteousness of the scribes and the
[15:33] pharisees you shall
[15:34] in no case enter into the kingdom of
[15:37] heaven
[15:39] the law is important jesus came to
[15:42] fulfill the law
[15:44] now how did he do it in one way
[15:48] he fulfilled the law that was given to
[15:50] adam in
[15:51] genesis chapter 2 verse 16
[15:55] and the lord god commanded the man
[15:57] saying of every tree
[15:58] of the guard thou shalt freely eat but
[16:01] of the tree of the knowledge of good and
[16:02] evil
[16:02] thou shalt not eat of it for in the day
[16:04] that thou eat serve
[16:06] thou shall surely die
[16:13] so he was speaking
[16:18] to adam when he spoke these words
[16:25] and god was a part of adam amen
[16:29] and when man partook of the tree death
[16:33] was the sentence surely
[16:37] death was what god required because god
[16:40] spoke it and when jesus died at calvary
[16:44] he fulfilled that part of the law that
[16:46] was required
[16:48] death god never did away with the law
[16:52] when jesus came mercy wasn't going
[16:55] uh uh going to to replace the law
[17:00] mercy is when he took our place
[17:06] but the law was still fulfilled
[17:10] when jesus laid down his life on mount
[17:12] calvary he not only fulfilled
[17:14] adam's death sentence but he tasted
[17:16] death for every man
[17:18] for every one of us
[17:21] because we were not born by the will of
[17:24] god
[17:27] if we were we would never have to be
[17:30] born again
[17:32] we were born with the wrong nature
[17:38] satan lied to eve in the beginning
[17:42] simply because he was just jealous and
[17:44] he wanted to be like the most high
[17:47] similar to the time when all the
[17:50] presidents and governors were jealous
[17:52] over daniel and he tricked king darius
[17:56] into signing
[17:58] a degree which could not be
[18:01] altered that
[18:04] whoever would pray to another god than
[18:07] to the king for 30 days
[18:09] would have to be thrown into the lion's
[18:11] den
[18:13] these jealous men knew that the law of
[18:15] the mesh and the persians could not be
[18:18] altered
[18:19] they knew it just like
[18:22] satan lucifer he knew that god would
[18:25] have to keep his word
[18:29] daniel chapter 6 verse 14 then the king
[18:33] when he heard these words were sword is
[18:35] pleased with himself
[18:36] and set his heart on daniel to deliver
[18:39] him
[18:40] and he labored till the going down of
[18:43] the son
[18:44] to deliver him now this is the heart of
[18:47] god that he had in mind when adam fell
[18:55] he didn't want to lose
[18:58] but he had already spoke the word
[19:01] he couldn't take it back
[19:05] that's exactly what god did for adam
[19:07] when he fell he
[19:08] loved him he made him uh cults to cover
[19:11] him and in genesis chapter 3 verse 15
[19:14] he said i will put enmity between thee
[19:16] and the woman in between thy seed and
[19:18] mercy
[19:18] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[19:21] shall bruise his heel
[19:22] god had already provided away
[19:25] at that moment because he loved adam
[19:34] god provided a way to the seed of adam
[19:37] when god would come
[19:38] himself to the body of jesus and pay the
[19:42] penalty
[19:43] of that death sentence that could not be
[19:45] altered
[19:46] for adam because what god speaks it has
[19:50] to come to pass
[19:53] it was calvary where god delivered us
[19:57] god had faith in his power of
[20:00] deliverance
[20:03] and i'll say it like this king darius
[20:07] had faith in the power that daniel
[20:10] served
[20:12] he said he said thy god
[20:16] shall protect thee shall deliver thee
[20:19] god had faith in his ability to deliver
[20:23] us
[20:26] hallelujah daniel chapter 6
[20:29] verse 16 the king commanded
[20:34] and they brought daniel and cast him to
[20:36] the lion's den and the king spake and
[20:37] said unto him
[20:38] thy god whom thou serve us continually
[20:42] he will deliver thee
[20:45] that's faith
[20:49] going against his word didn't want this
[20:53] to happen
[20:54] but his faith was in the god that daniel
[20:58] served
[21:00] daniel 6 verse 23 then was
[21:04] the king exceedingly glad for him and
[21:07] commanded that they should take
[21:08] daniel out of the den so daniel was
[21:11] taken up out of the den
[21:12] and no manner of hurt was found on him
[21:14] because
[21:16] he believed in his god
[21:21] i don't care what's going on it's all
[21:24] about you being
[21:25] focused on your god
[21:31] god believes in his power to help us and
[21:34] when we believe
[21:36] no hurt will come to our souls
[21:41] jesus said think not that i come to
[21:43] destroy the law or the prophets
[21:45] i come not to destroy
[21:48] but to fulfill for the law
[21:53] john chapter 1 verse 17 the bible says
[21:55] for the law
[21:56] was given by moses but grace
[22:00] and truth came by jesus christ
[22:04] grace and truth was the fulfillment
[22:08] of the law
[22:13] there's other parts of the law
[22:18] jesus said i am the way to the father
[22:22] he was the way to the father i am the
[22:24] truth of god that sets men free
[22:26] that gives them a new nature when
[22:28] they're born again i
[22:29] am the life my words are spirit and they
[22:32] are life
[22:33] jesus was the fulfillment of the law
[22:38] he brought grace he brought truth
[22:42] now not only grace was part of the law
[22:45] but
[22:45] mercy was part of the law
[22:49] matthew chapter 23 verse 13 20
[22:52] verse 23 i'm laying a foundation about
[22:55] fulfilling
[22:56] the law this morning please stay with me
[23:01] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[23:04] hypocrites for you pay
[23:08] tithes of mint and anise
[23:11] and come in and have omitted
[23:15] the weightier matters of the law
[23:19] and what are they judgment not on others
[23:23] but self-judgment
[23:25] mercy we all want mercy but we're
[23:28] talking about being merciful to others
[23:31] and faith these all ye have
[23:34] done and not to leave
[23:38] the other undone so there is
[23:41] a fulfillment of mercy that god wants us
[23:45] to
[23:45] to fulfill god is looking for us to
[23:48] fulfill that part of the law
[23:51] now we may have thought that the law was
[23:53] done away with when jesus came on the
[23:55] scene but it's not true at all
[23:58] jesus never came to do away with it but
[24:01] to fulfill it this is important to
[24:04] understand if we're going
[24:06] to fulfill god's will in our life
[24:09] john chapter 1 verse 1 and the beginning
[24:11] was the word the word was with god the
[24:12] word was god verse 14
[24:14] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[24:16] us when we behold his glory
[24:18] the glory is the only begotten son full
[24:20] of grace
[24:21] hallelujah and truth and if i could say
[24:25] it like this
[24:25] he was full of mercy
[24:31] full of mercy look at the woman caught
[24:32] in adultery
[24:34] full of mercy he fulfilled
[24:38] the law
[24:41] he fulfilled many parts of the law but i
[24:43] want to bring your attention
[24:45] to the part of the law that hasn't been
[24:47] completely fulfilled yet
[24:50] because jesus said one jot or one tittle
[24:52] shall no wise pass away
[24:54] till all be fulfilled there is more of
[24:56] the law
[24:57] to be fulfilled this is exciting
[25:03] first of all the law must be carried out
[25:05] through the bride
[25:09] for she will be the only one that will
[25:11] be able to fulfill the law
[25:16] god made a covenant with man and man
[25:18] could not
[25:19] keep his covenant because
[25:23] he could not keep the law
[25:26] it only put man in jail he was sold
[25:30] under the law the bible tells us
[25:31] the flesh is weak and he could not keep
[25:34] the law
[25:37] so what did god do he
[25:40] made another covenant
[25:44] because the law could not be fulfilled
[25:46] in hebrews chapter 8 verse 7
[25:49] for if the first covenant had been
[25:50] faultless then should no
[25:52] place had been sought for the second for
[25:55] finding fault with them he saith behold
[25:57] the days cometh saith the lord
[25:59] when i will make a new covenant with the
[26:01] house of israel
[26:02] and with the house of judah
[26:06] there wasn't a problem with the law
[26:11] there was really a problem with the
[26:13] covenant
[26:18] between god and man
[26:21] and that is that man did not have the
[26:24] ability to keep it
[26:27] man lacked the ability to love the law
[26:31] with all of his heart his heart had
[26:35] evil in it and though he wanted
[26:38] to do the right thing there was
[26:40] something inside of him that
[26:42] didn't want to do the right thing
[26:45] jeremiah 17 verse 9 says the heart
[26:48] is deceitful above all things and
[26:51] desperately wicked who can
[26:55] know it so a man that's always talking
[26:57] about where he knows where his heart is
[26:59] at
[27:00] you better be careful
[27:03] you're speaking contrary
[27:07] to what the bible says it takes the holy
[27:11] ghost
[27:12] to show us where we're at today
[27:15] there would be no need to come to church
[27:17] and find out where we're at with god if
[27:19] we always walked around
[27:21] thinking we knew where we're at
[27:27] man's nature was corrupted with
[27:30] selfishness
[27:33] under that first covenant
[27:37] and anytime we're under that first
[27:39] covenant oh i guess i gotta go to church
[27:43] well i guess i gotta go the second mile
[27:45] if i have to
[27:51] the nature under the first covenant it
[27:54] was corrupted
[27:56] it was a judgmental nature it was an
[27:59] eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
[28:03] it was corrupted with a lustful
[28:08] nature just like lucifer and i'm going
[28:10] to do my own thing
[28:14] so god sets out to make another covenant
[28:16] with man
[28:18] praise god for that where would we be
[28:19] without it
[28:21] hebrews chapter 8 verse 9 not according
[28:24] to the covenant i made with their
[28:25] fathers and the day when i took them by
[28:27] the hand i led them out of the land of
[28:28] egypt
[28:29] because they continued not in my first
[28:32] covenant
[28:33] and regarded them not saith the lord so
[28:36] what does god do he makes
[28:37] another covenant he sent
[28:40] his son to pay the price for our fallen
[28:43] nature
[28:45] and makes a way for the law to come and
[28:48] live back
[28:48] inside of a human being
[28:52] he sends back the holy ghost amen to
[28:55] live
[28:55] inside of man and when the holy ghost
[28:59] comes and lives inside of us
[29:01] the author he comes and lives inside you
[29:05] god can keep his own word
[29:09] hebrews chapter 10 verse 15 whereof
[29:12] the holy ghost also is a witness to us
[29:17] for after that he had said before
[29:20] this is the covenant that i will make
[29:22] with them after those
[29:24] days saith the lord i will put my laws
[29:28] into their hearts and into their minds
[29:31] will i write them
[29:33] and their sins and their iniquities will
[29:35] i remember
[29:36] no more
[29:40] so he's not doing away with the law
[29:45] he's taking it off the book
[29:48] and placing it in our heart
[29:51] and only he can do that only the holy
[29:54] ghost can do that
[29:56] man can't do that
[29:59] the holy ghost is speaking and bearing
[30:02] witness
[30:03] of this new covenant with man that god
[30:05] would place
[30:07] in to man's heart and into their minds
[30:09] amen
[30:10] the new covenant is to bring about a
[30:14] proper relationship between
[30:17] man and god god will not accept
[30:20] man's half-hearted efforts
[30:24] it's not good enough he wants a
[30:25] relationship with his word
[30:28] so he places the word inside of his
[30:31] people through the holy ghost
[30:32] and they become the word the living word
[30:36] they become the written epistles read of
[30:38] all men it's just
[30:39] written there in their heart and they
[30:41] become one with the word
[30:44] hebrews chapter 8 verse 10 for this is
[30:46] the covenant that i will make with the
[30:48] house of israel after those days saith
[30:50] the lord i will put
[30:51] my laws into their minds and write them
[30:53] into their hearts and i will be
[30:54] to them a god
[30:58] and they shall be to me a people
[31:01] and they shall not teach every man his
[31:04] neighbor
[31:05] and every man his brother saying know
[31:07] the lord
[31:08] for all shall know me from the least
[31:12] to the greatest and that's how the first
[31:16] covenant was here's the ten commandments
[31:18] i want to read them to you this is what
[31:20] you need to do
[31:21] you better go obey them
[31:28] but when god places into
[31:32] your heart his
[31:35] word a love for his word
[31:38] you have a desire to know him a desire
[31:41] to seek him
[31:42] and as you do he will reveal himself to
[31:46] you
[31:50] it's a different covenant
[31:53] that's why having a relationship with
[31:55] god outside the holy ghost is
[31:58] totally miserable incapable of
[32:02] fulfilling
[32:04] we need god on the inside we need to
[32:06] seek the holy ghost
[32:08] on the inside we need more of god on the
[32:10] inside
[32:13] first john chapter 2 verse 27
[32:17] but the anointing which you have
[32:19] received of him abideth in you
[32:22] and ye need not that
[32:26] any man teach you
[32:30] but as the same anointing teaches you
[32:33] all things
[32:34] is truth and there's no lie and even
[32:37] have taught you ye shall abide in him
[32:43] so you and the lord
[32:47] become one you no longer go to church
[32:53] to learn about god
[32:56] you go to church to learn
[32:59] where you're at with god
[33:07] you want to learn about god read your
[33:09] bible
[33:10] pray every day
[33:14] it's about where you're at and your
[33:16] intentions and your desires and
[33:18] and where you want to be it's your
[33:20] relationship
[33:21] is the time that you spend with god
[33:24] outside of church
[33:29] this you're coming you're subjecting
[33:31] yourself
[33:32] to god to speak to your conscience
[33:37] you're giving god preeminence that's why
[33:39] everybody don't stand up and everybody
[33:40] talks at one time
[33:42] we all got something to say but we're
[33:44] subjecting ourself
[33:46] to god to an office that he's provided a
[33:48] five-fold ministry
[33:51] and we don't take it lightly we don't we
[33:53] don't take it as a smorgasbord i'll take
[33:55] this and throw that away and
[33:57] you know dissect and be your own
[33:59] scientist
[34:00] no we're believers we believe god is in
[34:04] it
[34:06] hebrews chapter 8 verse 12 for i will be
[34:09] merciful to their unrighteousness and
[34:11] their sins
[34:12] and their iniquities while i remember no
[34:14] more isn't that beautiful
[34:16] what a beautiful covenant with god he
[34:19] doesn't hold anything over you
[34:22] when he goes under the blood it's in the
[34:24] sea of god's forgetfulness
[34:26] you might remember it
[34:30] but he made an agreement he's forgiven
[34:34] you
[34:35] he justifies you he puts you on the same
[34:39] plane
[34:43] but we still have to fulfill the law
[34:45] don't lose track of that
[34:47] in that he saith a new covenant he have
[34:50] made
[34:51] the first old now that which decayeth
[34:55] and waxeth old is ready
[34:57] to vanish away so we learn here in
[35:00] hebrews chapter 8 and 10
[35:02] that god promises to write his law
[35:05] in his people by the holy ghost and
[35:08] through the process
[35:10] man would truly know who god is
[35:13] and what he likes and dislikes and
[35:17] his nature and his character that it
[35:19] would be a personal one-on-one
[35:22] don't aren't you glad of that that that
[35:24] you don't need
[35:25] any man between you and god
[35:28] god didn't want to put any man between
[35:30] you and him there's no
[35:32] mediator between god and man than the
[35:34] man christ jesus amen
[35:36] god desires to reveal himself personally
[35:40] to you
[35:41] and when you desire to know god
[35:43] personally
[35:44] you'll spend time with him and say lord
[35:47] here i am
[35:48] have your way reveal yourself to me i
[35:51] believe in the realness of god
[35:56] just like david the bride
[36:00] will be a people after god's own heart
[36:06] they'll be the only ones that will
[36:08] fulfill the law
[36:12] the reason that it's hard for a lot of
[36:13] people to serve the lord completely
[36:16] is because they haven't received enough
[36:19] holy ghost
[36:21] you can receive just enough of god to
[36:24] get miserable
[36:27] god has never been
[36:30] a halfway he never caught you to a
[36:33] halfway relationship
[36:38] the battle is us learning to give our
[36:40] all to him
[36:43] but i'll say it like this if you try to
[36:46] do that
[36:46] without the holy ghost
[36:49] all the time you're going to be
[36:51] miserable and you're not you're going to
[36:53] just fail miserably
[36:54] you need god's help ask for the holy
[36:58] ghost
[37:00] ask for him to fill you forget about
[37:05] where you're at how much your problems
[37:08] are
[37:08] how unworthy you feel has nothing to do
[37:11] with it
[37:13] you're focusing on what you want with
[37:16] god
[37:16] and that is i want a relationship that's
[37:19] pleasing to god
[37:20] don't wait to get pleasing to have a
[37:22] pleasing relationship with god
[37:25] spend time asking for help i need you i
[37:28] need
[37:29] more of you inside of me that will give
[37:31] you your heart's desire
[37:36] there's nothing that i can do
[37:40] what house will i build him
[37:43] what am i going to do for god
[37:50] god's desire is to fill the heart of his
[37:53] people
[37:54] he wants to live in his people but he
[37:57] can't do it if there's a will
[37:59] that's stopping him from coming in
[38:02] so the wall that has to be broken down
[38:05] is the wall of self-will
[38:08] and that happens when you say into
[38:12] my heart
[38:16] and you want him to come in and you just
[38:18] i desire to desire it i want it keep
[38:21] yielding to it
[38:22] become a good yielder
[38:25] because god's a good filler
[38:30] the holy ghost inside every christian
[38:32] makes it easy
[38:35] for him to serve god to serve his word
[38:38] to serve the commandments to fulfill the
[38:40] law
[38:41] but that's why it's hard for some
[38:42] believers to be happy in serving the
[38:44] lord
[38:45] because they're trying
[38:48] they can't do it in themselves and they
[38:50] become unhappy and miserable
[38:53] they're not fulfilling the law unless
[38:55] you fulfill the law
[38:56] you will not be happy
[38:59] until you fulfill the law it's hard to
[39:02] remain happy
[39:04] it's the reason paul said i die daily
[39:10] let me just say this it's not just
[39:12] having the holy ghost
[39:15] but without yielding to the holy ghost a
[39:17] believer will eventually find himself
[39:19] miserably unhappy and without a
[39:22] purpose
[39:26] paul said i am crucified with christ i
[39:28] mortify the deeds of the flesh
[39:31] if we don't deny ourselves
[39:34] daily we can never fulfill god's will
[39:41] our will will stand in the way
[39:43] of god's progress for our lives
[39:49] god is capable to destroy any of us
[39:52] at any moment
[39:56] one day he's going to destroy the earth
[39:59] there's going to even be a new heaven
[40:01] god has power he created everything
[40:05] the thing is he has a respect
[40:09] not to go against our will that's how
[40:12] powerful
[40:12] he respects you even when you're wrong
[40:17] he respects you that's why i'll say it
[40:20] like this
[40:21] respect is something you can't have too
[40:24] much of
[40:35] god can only write his law in our hearts
[40:38] as we allow him to free more agency
[40:41] and only by obeying them through free
[40:43] more agency
[40:44] will you fulfill them and will give you
[40:46] joy
[40:47] and peace in the things that you really
[40:49] desire
[40:50] god put something inside a man to hunger
[40:54] if there's a deep calling god does not
[40:56] want his people
[40:57] to be unhappy miserable full of fear
[41:01] wandering in the wilderness he doesn't
[41:03] want that
[41:04] his desire is there's jordan cross over
[41:06] there's the promised land go
[41:09] we're the ones that say i don't know if
[41:11] i want to do that
[41:13] there's giants over there that's a hard
[41:15] to it's really hard just to give your
[41:18] all
[41:20] that's what they had to do they had to
[41:22] go in there and face
[41:24] death walk through the valley of shadow
[41:28] of death
[41:29] and trust that god was going to be with
[41:32] them
[41:34] and it was better to say you know what i
[41:36] think i'll serve god over here instead
[41:37] of going through that
[41:38] experience but i'll tell you if you want
[41:41] the holy ghost you're going to have to
[41:43] trust the lord
[41:46] i want more holy ghost i need more trust
[41:49] i need to spend more time with the lord
[41:54] too often we take our liberty that god
[41:58] gives
[41:58] us children that have been
[42:02] set free born again and you know what we
[42:05] do with it
[42:06] we please herself i'm saved
[42:10] liberty is not for our will it's not for
[42:14] our desires it's not for our plans it's
[42:16] not for our pleasures
[42:19] it's not to please ourselves galatians
[42:21] chapter 5 verse number 13
[42:24] for brethren you have not been called
[42:28] unto liberty
[42:32] i'm sorry for brethren you have been
[42:34] called unto liberty
[42:36] how come nobody you know said anything
[42:38] on that
[42:41] you better be paying attention
[42:44] we've been called on to liberty god has
[42:48] given us liberty
[42:50] only use not liberty for an occasion
[42:54] to the flesh but
[42:57] use your liberty by
[43:00] love to serve one another
[43:05] it's awful quiet we got one amen on that
[43:08] we all we all have a lot of amens on
[43:10] that because that's the word of god
[43:13] so a question to ask ourselves is what
[43:16] are you doing with the liberty that god
[43:17] has placed in your life
[43:20] god has given you liberty what have you
[43:22] what have you done
[43:23] with the liberty that he's placed in
[43:25] your life
[43:26] are you loving others with that liberty
[43:32] are you loving yourself are you serving
[43:36] others are you serving yourself
[43:39] a lot of people enjoy the freedom and
[43:41] liberty that our nation has
[43:44] but they don't want to humble themselves
[43:46] to give any kind of
[43:47] allegiance for what is done so they
[43:49] could have the liberty
[43:51] kind of spirit is that
[43:55] it's like a lot of believers today they
[43:57] love the liberty that christ gives them
[43:59] but they don't love god enough to serve
[44:02] others
[44:07] the law of god still needs to be
[44:09] fulfilled we still need to respect
[44:11] the word amen god's given us
[44:16] liberty for a purpose verse 14
[44:20] for all the law is fulfilled in just
[44:24] one word even this
[44:28] thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself
[44:32] think about just the whole law that
[44:34] we're talking about
[44:35] to be fulfilled in just one word love
[44:39] if we would always love one another we
[44:42] would be able to fulfill
[44:45] the word of god the law of god just
[44:50] like jesus did he fulfilled the law
[44:53] when he loved the world so much that he
[44:56] gave himself
[44:58] amen you have a chance
[45:03] to fulfill the law if you take that
[45:06] liberty that god gives you
[45:08] and love one another i love this word
[45:13] now i know it's a kind of crazy heart
[45:16] with this a virus going around
[45:18] and it kind of keeps you from distancing
[45:20] and
[45:21] all this stuff but i'll say it like this
[45:24] it has nothing to do about outwardness
[45:28] it's all about what's in your heart
[45:32] if you're so in love with god you will
[45:35] find a way to get it out
[45:36] and love others it may be through a
[45:39] phone call it may be through a text it
[45:41] may be through a card
[45:42] but you have an opportunity to forgive
[45:45] somebody
[45:47] you have an opportunity to show mercy to
[45:50] show love
[45:51] to show grace to be long-suffering to
[45:54] make
[45:55] god manifested in your life in your
[45:58] spirit
[46:00] or you can take that liberty and say
[46:04] it's all about what's happening in these
[46:06] four walls right here
[46:08] it's all about me
[46:12] that's not you're not fulfilling the law
[46:15] what you're saying is the law stopped
[46:16] with you
[46:19] that's what you're saying the law
[46:22] needs to be fulfilled through you
[46:25] there's a responsibility that comes with
[46:27] the law
[46:30] just love one another we have to do our
[46:33] part today to fulfill the law today
[46:35] the law is still in motion
[46:39] jesus told us to love one another the
[46:41] same way that he loved us
[46:43] in other words keep fulfilling the law
[46:47] in one word he covered our sins
[46:51] he forgave us he put things behind
[46:55] he put them in the sea of forgetfulness
[46:58] now what are you doing
[46:59] with that love inside of you
[47:02] whose sins are your covering who are you
[47:05] being merciful to
[47:07] what are you forgetting and putting
[47:09] behind you
[47:11] see you have a chance to fulfill the law
[47:16] you know the law that most people want
[47:17] to use
[47:19] is how come you're not wearing a tie
[47:22] today
[47:25] if you're a christian how come you're
[47:26] not giving me more
[47:32] you know it's judgmental
[47:39] the only time some christians think
[47:41] about the other side of the law
[47:44] is god giving to them
[47:48] god loving them god being merciful to
[47:50] them god being gracious to them
[47:53] but god has called us to fulfill the law
[47:58] to lay down our lives for one another
[48:01] to be merciful to one another blessed
[48:04] are the merciful for they shall obtain
[48:06] mercy
[48:13] it's not out of our reach
[48:16] only the bride will fulfill the law
[48:21] his mercies when you think about it his
[48:23] mercies
[48:24] since calvary have been new
[48:27] every morning for us it wasn't just
[48:31] at calvary those mercies are real today
[48:36] and they're in action today all we got
[48:38] to do is ask god to forgive
[48:40] and he doesn't say well you know let's
[48:42] just have a little talk about this are
[48:44] you going to do it again
[48:49] no he knows we're frail he knows we're
[48:51] human
[48:52] but he's there to be merciful to us
[48:55] what about us who are we going to be
[48:59] merciful to
[49:02] well brother john you don't know what
[49:03] they did to me
[49:05] you don't know how it hurt me
[49:10] so what you're telling me is you can't
[49:12] fulfill the law of christ
[49:14] he's still being long-suffering with you
[49:19] god is still still fulfilling the law
[49:23] with you
[49:26] he's still not making you die
[49:31] he's still not giving you the death
[49:33] sentence
[49:37] i understand that he forgave you at
[49:40] calvary
[49:42] but he's not going to calvary again
[49:46] that means he's still forgiving you
[49:48] today for what you did
[49:50] yesterday and don't you tell me your
[49:53] sins
[49:54] are less than mine don't you do that
[49:57] don't you
[49:58] look at somebody and think that their
[50:00] sins are worse than yours
[50:02] that's unless your righteousness exceeds
[50:04] the righteousness
[50:05] of the scribes and the pharisees you
[50:07] shall no wise enter in
[50:13] and don't you say your sins are too
[50:15] great that god cannot forgive you
[50:17] don't you belittle the power of almighty
[50:20] god
[50:20] [Music]
[50:22] god is greater than any sin
[50:31] one day there will be no remembrance
[50:37] of what that devil did to us
[50:42] we don't know how long he's going to
[50:44] suffer billions and billions of years
[50:46] for all we know in hell
[50:53] but god said i know the thoughts i think
[50:55] toward you saith the lord
[50:57] thoughts of peace he wants to give us an
[51:00] expected end
[51:01] but what is the end that you expect of
[51:03] somebody else
[51:06] he's going to fulfill the law but what
[51:09] about
[51:10] you what about christ
[51:13] in you reaching out to somebody else
[51:17] do you have an expected end for them
[51:21] or if you cut them off
[51:24] god give us time to get through these
[51:26] beautiful scriptures we have today
[51:29] god does not want these laws written in
[51:31] our minds and our hearts to have some
[51:34] sort of
[51:34] collection of facts or some encyclopedia
[51:37] so we can describe
[51:39] what the law is he put them in our
[51:42] hearts
[51:43] and our minds so we can fulfill them
[51:47] james chapter 2 verse number 8 james
[51:50] chapter 2 verse number 8
[51:53] if ye fulfill the royal
[51:56] law according to the scriptures now
[52:02] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[52:06] ye do well let me just say this
[52:12] if you do not fulfill
[52:15] the law of christ you're not doing well
[52:21] if you do not love your neighbor
[52:25] just like you love yourself you are not
[52:28] doing well
[52:31] well brother john i think i'm doing just
[52:33] fine thank you
[52:34] you're not doing well on the side of god
[52:39] now i'm just reading the scriptures you
[52:41] can disagree with me
[52:42] but i really don't care because i'm just
[52:45] stating what the scriptures say
[52:50] now if i start saying something
[52:51] different than the scripture says
[52:54] that might bother me
[52:57] but if you stay with the word it doesn't
[52:59] matter if the whole world's against you
[53:04] look at verse 9 but if ye have respect
[53:08] to persons
[53:11] you commit sin
[53:14] and are convinced of the law you
[53:17] are a transgressor
[53:22] if you're going to respect who you're
[53:24] going to love
[53:26] and when you're going to love them ye
[53:29] are committing
[53:30] sin you're a sinner
[53:34] you're sinning i don't say you're sinner
[53:37] but you're sinning
[53:38] so you're a christian sinning so what
[53:41] kind of category is that
[53:44] not a good category right because when
[53:45] you think of a christian you think of
[53:47] christ
[53:47] like but the scripture is just telling
[53:49] us here that if we have respect to
[53:51] persons
[53:52] if you're going to choose well i like
[53:54] you i'm going to love you but i don't
[53:56] like you
[53:56] and i'm not gonna like you
[54:01] you're a transgressor you're not
[54:04] fulfilling the law of christ you're
[54:05] fulfilling your own law this is my law
[54:08] i like him i don't like him
[54:12] i'll do it this time because he's only
[54:14] done it once but if he does it
[54:16] you know seven times
[54:21] got a peter spirit on you we need a
[54:24] jesus spirit 7 times 70.
[54:33] we don't want to have respect to persons
[54:38] instead of fulfilling we become a
[54:40] transgressor of the law
[54:42] god has called us to fulfill the law
[54:46] that means you've got to love everybody
[54:47] the same
[54:49] come to grips with it sooner or later
[54:52] don't be a judge of who's worthy and
[54:55] who's not worthy
[54:58] having respect to pus persons puts you
[55:02] on the side the same side with all the
[55:04] transgressors
[55:06] don't view people as worthy or unworthy
[55:10] view people in one way
[55:13] love one word love that's it
[55:18] forget about what they've done forget
[55:20] about how many times they've done it
[55:22] forget about how it makes it does not
[55:23] matter
[55:24] view them one way love well brother john
[55:28] i'm just not going to become their
[55:29] friend and i'm not going to let them use
[55:30] me
[55:31] love get a revelation of love
[55:35] don't tell me what you're going to do
[55:36] and not going to do fulfill the law
[55:39] love
[55:44] we have no problem
[55:48] given our opinions on what the gospel is
[55:51] for our lives
[55:54] but by this one word all men shall know
[55:57] you're my disciples
[55:59] one when we manifest love
[56:03] to everybody the same you know what
[56:06] people will never ever know how true you
[56:10] are to god
[56:11] until you allow somebody to slap you on
[56:14] the face
[56:16] to pull your beard to use you
[56:20] to betray you they will never know the
[56:22] love of god in your life
[56:24] until you allow them to misuse you
[56:31] because the power of love is seen
[56:35] when god is forgiving you
[56:40] when it came personal to you and you
[56:43] know god forgave you know
[56:44] despite the what the sins you've done
[56:48] and how are people going to see the love
[56:50] of god in you if you no
[56:52] you're not worthy of that i don't like
[56:54] you because you
[56:58] how are you going to fulfill the law
[57:01] of god you've got to fulfill the law
[57:06] well we just read it we just read it
[57:12] brother john you don't know how bad that
[57:14] person is
[57:16] you have not had the experience that
[57:18] i've had with that person
[57:20] you don't know how they made me feel you
[57:22] don't know what they said behind my back
[57:25] you don't know how they tried to destroy
[57:27] me
[57:29] what does that have anything to do with
[57:31] the word of god does your word supersede
[57:33] the word of god
[57:36] don't make an excuse of why you can't
[57:40] love your neighbor as god has loved you
[57:44] there is no excuse god will not give you
[57:46] in fact he put you on the side of the
[57:48] transgressor
[57:49] because you decided sometime in your
[57:52] life to be a respecter persons
[57:57] god came to fulfill the law and you tell
[57:58] me which one
[58:01] of us on the planet that was worthy
[58:04] of calvary
[58:09] so why are you going to decide who's
[58:11] worthy of god's love in your life
[58:15] you know i can tell you this i could sit
[58:17] here and say well i think
[58:19] you know bob is not worthy of my love
[58:21] but you know
[58:22] tom uh you know he is that's my love
[58:26] that may be true because my love is
[58:28] limited
[58:30] but not god god's love is worthy
[58:34] to be loved by everybody how do i know
[58:37] that
[58:38] calvary calvary
[58:41] if it did it at calvary it'll do it
[58:43] inside of me
[58:46] that's why paul said i'm crucified with
[58:48] christ
[58:50] nevertheless
[58:54] i'm dead right i'm crucified but
[58:55] nevertheless i live because christ
[58:58] liveth in me christ is living the love
[59:02] of god through my life that's why he
[59:05] could
[59:06] uh why he could lay down his life and be
[59:09] a servant
[59:11] become all things to all men that he
[59:13] might win some to christ
[59:16] he showed us how to fulfill the law of
[59:18] christ
[59:19] he laid down his life for us
[59:23] for the brethren john lay down his life
[59:26] for the brethren
[59:28] if you think about it paul was not a
[59:31] respecter persons
[59:33] if he would have been a respecter
[59:34] persons i think he could avoided a lot
[59:36] of persecution
[59:39] he said well you know i'm kind of
[59:40] stretching the boundaries here i can see
[59:42] somebody's getting bothered about what
[59:43] i'm saying
[59:49] look i i'm sure there is
[59:52] spirits that are not happy with the word
[59:55] that's being preached right now
[1:00:00] but you know those spirits that might be
[1:00:04] bothering you
[1:00:05] are not of god
[1:00:12] the holy ghost is in unity with the word
[1:00:16] the word of god amen so be it may it be
[1:00:19] done in my life
[1:00:20] may the law of god be fulfilled in me
[1:00:23] may the world
[1:00:24] see that i'm laying down my life for
[1:00:26] everybody
[1:00:29] galatians chapter six verse number one
[1:00:33] brethren

[1:00:40] now this is for you who sometimes feel
[1:00:43] you just
[1:00:43] this situation is so bad with this
[1:00:45] person i just want to take my hands off

[1:01:01] the
[1:01:01] spirit of meekness considering
[1:01:04] yourself lest you also be tempted
[1:01:11] what are you doing when you're doing
[1:01:12] this what are you really doing when
[1:01:14] you're doing this
[1:01:16] you are bearing one another's
[1:01:19] burden and when you bear one another's
[1:01:22] burden
[1:01:23] you're fulfilling the law of christ
[1:01:28] that's what jesus did when he said i
[1:01:30] didn't come to do away with the law
[1:01:32] but i come to fulfill it the fulfillment
[1:01:35] was
[1:01:35] when he bore your burdens
[1:01:40] but christ is still alive and if he's
[1:01:42] living in us
[1:01:44] we will bear one another's burden
[1:01:47] and when you do you fulfill the law
[1:01:52] i think it's awesome
[1:01:55] amen it's awesome brother i love it i
[1:01:58] love the word
[1:02:00] i love it i love it i love it i love
[1:02:03] that the word
[1:02:05] can challenge me and show me where i'm
[1:02:08] coming
[1:02:08] short of laying down my life for
[1:02:10] somebody
[1:02:14] you know satan is always telling us
[1:02:17] you're there
[1:02:18] you're there you're in the message
[1:02:21] you're in the truth
[1:02:23] you know what the same spirit laodicea
[1:02:25] has
[1:02:27] need of nothing
[1:02:31] i need him i see
[1:02:35] selfishness in my nature i need him
[1:02:39] i see me not want to lay down my life
[1:02:41] for somebody i need him
[1:02:44] i need to fulfill the law of christ
[1:02:47] and i can't do it on my own i need the
[1:02:49] holy ghost
[1:02:50] i need god living inside of me
[1:02:54] god is not coming to find out
[1:02:58] who could be the best person in their
[1:03:00] flesh
[1:03:02] he's coming for those who've been washed
[1:03:04] in the blood
[1:03:06] who's covered with the blood who's
[1:03:08] filled with the holy ghost
[1:03:10] who's got god on the inside of them
[1:03:17] they are one another's burden you know a
[1:03:18] lot of people
[1:03:24] think that people are so below them
[1:03:29] that they don't
[1:03:33] want to bear their burden
[1:03:36] this is the to me the saddest thing
[1:03:41] they view somebody else's
[1:03:44] problem as their problem
[1:03:48] they refuse to carry
[1:03:51] any of that burden to get underneath
[1:03:55] and help lift up and make sure that
[1:03:59] things are going good
[1:04:02] you've got to have a heart and a mind
[1:04:05] of god's laws to restore
[1:04:08] because that's what christ did he
[1:04:10] restored
[1:04:15] there's got to be somebody here today
[1:04:18] that's excited about this word if not
[1:04:21] i want you to know i'm excited about it
[1:04:23] today i'm excited about this
[1:04:26] word today for if a man
[1:04:29] think himself to be something when he's
[1:04:32] nothing
[1:04:32] he's deceiving himself in other words i
[1:04:36] don't have to
[1:04:40] i'm above the law
[1:04:43] i don't have to bear
[1:04:48] i don't have to do that but let every
[1:04:51] man prove his own work
[1:04:52] and then shall he have rejoiced in
[1:04:54] himself alone
[1:04:55] and not in another
[1:04:59] be the one to fulfill the law you be the
[1:05:02] one
[1:05:04] it doesn't matter who else in this
[1:05:06] church
[1:05:08] doesn't want to go all the way with
[1:05:09] christ
[1:05:11] god is coming for those who are going
[1:05:13] all the way
[1:05:15] be the one to fulfill it don't be the
[1:05:17] one to say
[1:05:18] well i'm fulfilling it
[1:05:22] a little bit more than bob
[1:05:25] i think i'm fulfilling it more than
[1:05:26] anybody in this church
[1:05:29] no they that compare themselves with
[1:05:32] themselves is unwise
[1:05:34] compare with jesus compare with paul
[1:05:39] there's a reason paul's in there he laid
[1:05:41] down his life
[1:05:43] he followed the example that jesus did
[1:05:48] amen and god wants us to
[1:05:52] to do our part to fulfill the law to
[1:05:55] finish the work that he gave you and i
[1:05:57] to do in our age paul is not living in
[1:06:00] this age
[1:06:01] paul can't do it for you peter can't do
[1:06:04] it for you brother branham's not here to
[1:06:05] do it for you
[1:06:09] but you are here to do it to do
[1:06:12] the work of the lord to lay down your
[1:06:15] life for somebody that needs you
[1:06:18] that needs the lord that needs the lord
[1:06:23] let the love of god
[1:06:28] come out of you to where people don't
[1:06:30] see you anymore
[1:06:35] you can't go to somebody and say hey my
[1:06:37] name is john martin
[1:06:38] i love you so much i'm going to do this
[1:06:40] for you and i'm going to make you so
[1:06:42] good i'm going to take care of your
[1:06:43] problems and
[1:06:44] you know when you get done you're gonna
[1:06:46] be thinking of john martin
[1:06:48] it's not about john martin
[1:06:51] it's about getting out of the way and
[1:06:53] letting people see jesus
[1:07:00] that's fulfilling his law
[1:07:04] so help somebody in the name of the lord
[1:07:08] don't help somebody in your name amen
[1:07:18] god has called us to get grace and mercy
[1:07:20] to others
[1:07:22] that's how you fulfill the law of the
[1:07:24] lord paul
[1:07:26] showed us how to do it he took the
[1:07:28] liberty
[1:07:29] that god gave him that set him free
[1:07:33] from being a murderer from accusing the
[1:07:36] wrong things
[1:07:38] he had this liberty you know what he did
[1:07:40] with it he didn't go
[1:07:42] around just testifying i'm saved i'm
[1:07:44] saved
[1:07:45] i'm saved i'm saved he took that liberty
[1:07:49] and he didn't make an occasion for the
[1:07:52] flesh
[1:07:55] but he became a servant he
[1:07:58] actually became all things to all men
[1:08:01] knowing
[1:08:02] that there was just a few of them they
[1:08:04] was going to get to save
[1:08:08] that's what he did with his liberty
[1:08:11] he died to himself that god could use
[1:08:14] his vessel
[1:08:16] and he laid down his life
[1:08:19] to fulfill the law didn't do away with
[1:08:23] the law
[1:08:24] don't let the law be done away with in
[1:08:26] your life don't say i'm done with the
[1:08:28] law
[1:08:28] now i'm not serving i'm not helping i'm
[1:08:30] not laying down my life i'm not
[1:08:32] bending over i'm not bearing anybody's
[1:08:34] no don't do that
[1:08:38] be the vessel that god can use to
[1:08:40] fulfill the law
[1:08:42] it's still being fulfilled it will be
[1:08:44] fulfilled that law
[1:08:45] when we get to heaven there ain't going
[1:08:46] to be something different
[1:08:49] than what there is now
[1:08:53] god is god he remains the same
[1:08:57] his people will have his word in their
[1:09:00] heart do you believe that
[1:09:02] amen second corinthians chapter
[1:09:05] 5 or second corinthians chapter 5 i just
[1:09:07] got a few scriptures
[1:09:09] god gave paul a ministry of
[1:09:11] reconciliation
[1:09:13] for what purpose to fulfill
[1:09:16] the law
[1:09:20] verse 18 all things are of god who have
[1:09:22] reconciled himself
[1:09:23] by jesus christ and given to us the
[1:09:26] ministry
[1:09:27] of reconciliation to restore others
[1:09:32] back to god to wit that god was in
[1:09:35] christ reconciling the world to himself
[1:09:37] not putting their trespasses unto him
[1:09:39] and what not a period
[1:09:42] and is committed unto us the word of
[1:09:44] reconciliation so it didn't stop with
[1:09:46] jesus
[1:09:48] in other words jesus is still doing it
[1:09:52] but he's doing it through vessels that
[1:09:55] will take on the responsibility
[1:09:58] of fulfilling the law
[1:10:02] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[1:10:05] we're not christ
[1:10:08] we didn't become a new god we're just an
[1:10:11] ambassador for god
[1:10:13] as though god did beseech you by us we
[1:10:15] pray you in christ said
[1:10:17] be ye reconciled to god
[1:10:21] he didn't use his liberty for himself
[1:10:25] oh i'm free i'm saved i'm a christian
[1:10:28] it's all about me
[1:10:29] no he had a vision for souls
[1:10:35] he fulfilled the law of christ
[1:10:39] when you stop with yourself
[1:10:43] you're not fulfilling the law
[1:10:47] i know that's hard but there ought to be
[1:10:50] something inside of you with every heart
[1:10:53] you come in contact with be reconciled
[1:10:55] to god
[1:10:57] be reconciled back to god have a
[1:10:59] relationship with him
[1:11:01] that's all that matters everything's
[1:11:03] going to perish
[1:11:05] i'll tell you this virus is nothing
[1:11:07] compared to what's coming on the planet
[1:11:09] [Music]
[1:11:11] there's such destruction men are going
[1:11:14] to seek to destroy themselves that's how
[1:11:16] horrible it's going to be
[1:11:22] why we have a chance let god use you as
[1:11:25] an ambassador
[1:11:26] to reconcile others to christ
[1:11:30] for it made him
[1:11:33] to be sin for us who knew no sin that we
[1:11:35] might become the righteousness of god in
[1:11:37] him so
[1:11:38] that is our purpose with others
[1:11:42] he took the liberty that god gave him as
[1:11:45] a treasure and i want to close in this
[1:11:46] scripture in second corinthians chapter
[1:11:48] four
[1:11:53] paul took the liberty that god gave him
[1:11:55] as a treasure of power that laid down in
[1:11:57] his heart
[1:11:59] he lived for others and as he did he
[1:12:02] fulfilled the law of christ and we see
[1:12:04] here
[1:12:05] in chapter 4 verse number 6 for god
[1:12:08] who commanded the light to shine out of
[1:12:11] darkness
[1:12:12] have shined in our hearts remember he'd
[1:12:14] write the law
[1:12:15] in our minds and our hearts to give the
[1:12:18] light
[1:12:19] of the knowledge that he wrote inside of
[1:12:21] us of the glory of god
[1:12:23] in the face of jesus christ but we have
[1:12:27] this treasure in earthen vessels
[1:12:30] that the excellency of the power may be
[1:12:33] of
[1:12:33] god and not of ourselves
[1:12:38] what are you doing when god gives you
[1:12:41] the word
[1:12:42] and you talk it in here and you do not
[1:12:46] share it with others
[1:12:49] what you're saying is it's yours
[1:12:54] i'm in debt today for what god did for
[1:12:57] me
[1:13:02] it's not all for me i got to give it to
[1:13:05] somebody
[1:13:07] amen that's what these scriptures god's
[1:13:09] given you a treasure
[1:13:11] this is what you're supposed to do with
[1:13:12] the treasure he's given you remember the
[1:13:14] person who went
[1:13:15] buried his treasure he just you wrapped
[1:13:17] himself in it he says it's all about me
[1:13:19] what happened to him god called him a
[1:13:21] wicked servant
[1:13:24] because a wicked servant stops
[1:13:26] fulfilling the law of christ
[1:13:30] it's all about them but a wise servant
[1:13:33] takes the word that treasure that god's
[1:13:36] given him and shares the love of
[1:13:38] god fulfills the word in just one word
[1:13:41] fulfills the law with just one word
[1:13:44] loving
[1:13:45] everybody and you can show love in a
[1:13:48] so many it's a countless ways that love
[1:13:50] can be shown
[1:13:52] amen so we have this treasure in our
[1:13:55] vessels
[1:13:56] we are troubled
[1:14:00] on every side yet not distressed we are
[1:14:02] perplexed but not in despair
[1:14:04] we are persecuted but not forsaken we
[1:14:06] were cast down but not destroyed
[1:14:08] what's really going on in our life
[1:14:11] always bearing about in our body
[1:14:15] the dying of the lord jesus that the
[1:14:17] life
[1:14:18] also of jesus might be manifest in our
[1:14:20] bodies
[1:14:21] what's happening the fulfilling of the
[1:14:24] law
[1:14:26] for we which live are always delivered
[1:14:29] unto the death
[1:14:30] uh for uh unto death for jesus sake that
[1:14:33] the life
[1:14:34] also of jesus might be man manifest in
[1:14:37] our mortal flesh
[1:14:38] so then death worketh in us
[1:14:42] but life in you
[1:14:45] we have a chance for the law to be
[1:14:47] fulfilled if we deny yourself
[1:14:50] and let christ love through us to others
[1:14:54] what a blessed opportunity we have to be
[1:14:57] used by god let's stand together
[1:14:59] may god bless you with this word may god
[1:15:02] fulfill the law in your life may
[1:15:04] he use your vessel
[1:15:07] to carry out this ministry that he's
[1:15:09] giving every one of us
[1:15:13] to love one another let it be said of
[1:15:16] you
[1:15:17] people could not tell who your enemies
[1:15:20] were
[1:15:21] let it be said of you
[1:15:24] that all that people ever saw was you
[1:15:26] loving everybody
[1:15:28] now i know it's a tall order but it's
[1:15:31] the fulfillment
[1:15:33] it's the fulfillment of the word
[1:15:36] i'll tell you there's not jesus died for
[1:15:39] the whole world there was not
[1:15:40] one sin that he wouldn't that he could
[1:15:43] not pay the price for
[1:15:47] that means if that same god is living in
[1:15:49] me he'll have the same attitude no
[1:15:51] matter what they do to me
[1:15:54] no matter what they do to me it's not
[1:15:56] about me
[1:15:58] i deserve everything that everybody's
[1:16:00] ever done to me
[1:16:02] let me say that again i deserve every
[1:16:04] evil thing
[1:16:05] that everybody has done to me
[1:16:08] because i know i'm a filthy creature
[1:16:14] but it's not for me to judge them
[1:16:18] but if christ died for me christ died
[1:16:21] for them
[1:16:23] if god's still forgiven me god wants to
[1:16:26] forgive them
[1:16:29] amen that's about our hearts and a word
[1:16:31] of prayer i just want to say every heart
[1:16:35] is about
