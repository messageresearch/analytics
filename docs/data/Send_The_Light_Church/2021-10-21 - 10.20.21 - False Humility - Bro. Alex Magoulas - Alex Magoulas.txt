TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is here jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible jesus is here aren't you glad for that tonight i know that he's here and our gathering together is not in vain amen if he weren't here we would just be having a lodge meeting or something tonight i mean you could go do that anywhere but to know that he's here amen that's what makes all the difference since he's here and we're here why don't we just go ahead and bow our heads for word of prayer this evening look to him now lord we are so grateful that you've brought us here tonight lord even in the natural that you've kept us safe throughout the day and washed over each of us different ones that have gone to jobs and have driven in different things lord we look at our life on this earth our it's like a vapor lord our frame is but dust we're such fragile beings in the natural and we don't even realize it so many times how how closely we uh we come to even the end of our our natural life on this earth but lord the scripture says that you shall give your angels charge over us to keep us in all our ways the scripture says all so that the angel the lord campeth around about them that fear him and delivereth them and we're thankful for deliverance tonight we're thankful that you've ordered every footstep the footsteps of a good man there ordered of the lord father and you've brought us here to this place this divine appointment this evening and father since we've gathered together we know that you keep all of your appointments and we just ask now as we've invited you and we've made a place for you tonight that you'd be welcome into our midst lord what a travesty would be to invite you and to come before you in prayer and ask you to come tonight and then let you sit with unwashing feet tonight to let you be neglected we want to give attendance to the reading of the word into doctrine to your presence tonight and father in the name of jesus christ we just ask that you would be magnified in this place that something of eternal value would be said to edify and to encourage your believers to give direction and strength to us and father we would be remiss if we didn't thank you lord for all that's said and done tonight we committed into your hands we give you all the praise and the glory and the honor bless the reading of your word now and the utterance thereafter we ask in jesus christ's name amen if you have your bibles this evening we'll just get straight into i'll have you turn to colossians the second chapter while you're turning there i want to read psalm 118 i'll just go and read it to you for the sake of time but the scripture says the lord is on my side i will not fear what can man do unto me amen colossians chapter two we're going to read verses 18 and 19 tonight i didn't know if i was going to preach this or what and sometimes as a minister you you're just not real sure but i i've kind of had this i've ministered on and kind of studied it recently and i felt real good about it so i'm just gonna preach it again tonight so the bible says here in colossians chapter two and we trust the word is always a blessing to us verse 18 the apostle paul by the spirit speaking he says let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind and not holding the head amen from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increaseth with the increase of god so it doesn't just increase but it increases with the increase of god amen may the lord bless the readings words you're seated tonight i'd like to take a thought this evening based off this idea of voluntary humility or false humility tonight i thought i would look up the definition of this being of course the resident expert on humility i was talking to brother here one time a while back and he let me know that he was he was an expert on humility he said i'm so humble brother i wrote a book on he was joking of course but he said he wrote a book on it so that's that's about how some people are they're so humble they're proud of it so that's not what i'm trying to present tonight no don't get all skittish but god has a sense of humor too and god's got a sense of humor too amen some people they're so proud or they're so humble they're proud of it and they'll let you know that they're more humble than you and so that's kind of what this definition this idea of voluntary humility i looked it up and trying to get a better sense of it in the greek and it's akin to what jesus talked about he said when a hypocrite he said he said don't be like the hypocrites he said when they fast they disfigure their faces and now why do they do they have a purpose in doing that when they fast or they do religious things they want you to know just how miserable they are because and jesus tells you what they want to appear unto men to fast so they're not doing it for god they're doing it for you to see them do it and that's the idea this idea of asceticism or voluntary humility or a false humility jesus says they fast and they want you to know they fast so that you know they fast and jesus said their reward is that people see them do it so the reward is to be seen that way amen but he says but when you do it and when you pray whatever you do you're not doing it to be rewarded by men you do it so your father will see in secret and your father will reward you openly amen so the whole idea here of of a false humility is it's something that you do so that people will look at you and see something that you're not right amen so praise the lord the prophet isaiah talks about the same thing in isaiah the 15th chapter about a chosen fast there's a wrong reason to do it and there's a right and i'm not preaching on fasting and different things tonight but this idea of a self-imposed sense of humility it's for the express purpose to appear humble to others amen so this is why i say this what appears humble to men is not necessarily what is humble before the lord amen amen and so i preached the sermon a while back i don't know if i mentioned that but i just just throw this out here real quick it ties into this very idea there's a real difference between our reputation and our character our reputation is what everybody thinks about us but our characters who we actually are and it's not that your reputation is unimportant but it's unimportant compared to your character amen because we came into this world with nothing and when we leave the prophet said the only thing you're taking with you is your character you're not taking your reputation with you what everybody thinks about you oh he's just an anointed brother he's a great preacher she's a great singer they're this to that what people think about you doesn't matter amen we see it so many times we go to a funeral somebody wants to preach oh he was a good man he did this and he was like this and he might have been the lowest guy in town i mean we preach everybody into heaven it's like i told somebody a while back oh we gotta preach everybody who wants to stand there and say they're not in heaven i said well if you want me to say nice things about you the funeral give me something to work with because i'm not going to lie for you in the pulpit you know amen but we present this oh they're such a great person and they are dedicated and they are helping the community but i want you to understand those things don't put them anywhere and they don't put you there and then what a person thinks about you does not determine your eternal destination but the character that you have and many times this is why i'm saying this many times your character might not always match what people think is your reputation i want you to understand our lord jesus had a reputation as an illegitimate child as a renegade as a troublemaker he wasn't the kind old priests that come and kiss the names and come when you were sick he's the one flipping tables and causing trouble i did preach about that last time amen he had a bad reputation get any good thing come out of nazareth praise the lord amen so your reputation is what people think you're about your characters who you are and i want you to notice jesus lets you know hypocrites are more concerned about their reputation than their character their great need is not to be humble but for you to think that they're humble that's their need amen praise the lord brother branham says this and the meanest man i know in 1962 he says i think that's what's the matter with all of us today the churches we don't associate our associate ourselves in enough in real humility not a false but something that you stay there until something's happened to you humilities is too much wind and thunder and not enough still small voices i think that's true we look and now he tells you this we look and see that it's true because the fruit that it bears upon our people somehow it's just isn't what it i'm sorry somehow it isn't just like it used to be right and then we sit here all the good old days it's not like what it used to be used to be this way well what changed amen people's at it thank you brother people's attitudes their expectations their approach to god has changed amen god didn't change the word of god didn't change but people's approach to god what people value amen this nation was founded on a principle of religious freedom and people suffered and died for this and you can't hardly get in the mood for the word of god nowadays they're moved by entertainment they're moved by politics moved by every false show of humility and and you gotta this guy's you know he gets up here and he kisses the babies and we're gonna sign this bill and we gotta get all these people we're impressed with hollywood and glitter and glamour all the wrong things and then we sit there wondering why is it different it's because the people have valued the wrong thing what changed people embraced pretense over authenticity we've accepted edificate or entertainment over edification amen we took this very concept of humility like these pharisees like these hypocrites we took the very concept of humility and we we homogenized it we packaged it we market it and we labeled it we advertise it you can be as humble as me if you buy my book amen well if you can do this if i could be like this person i and we we we've marketed like we do everything else in america we've marketed this idea of humility until it looks nothing like what the bible said now i'm saying this for a reason because our culture pushes this especially upon our men you know listen if a man gets up and he voices his opinion he's a he's aggressive and he's a toxic man but it's okay for the woman to do that now so if the woman acts like a man supposed to it's okay but if a man acts like a man he's a bad person our whole culture is now centered on this idea of taking away a man's masculinity and even in the churches we're not allowed to say what we want to say we're not allowed to preach this bible because it's a hate crime but they can push every kind of nonsense and every kind of perversion and if you say something about it you're a troublemaker well you're just some stuck up holy roller no i'm humble enough to believe the word of god i just believe it the way god says it amen and many people even in churches they they compromise and they change this why because they're not looking to god for their reward they're looking at the almighty dollar or whatever it is popularity amen but for a person this is the thing when a man is truly humble a man that's truly humble or a woman that's truly humble they humble themselves to the word and the will of god because there's only one reward they're interested in it might not be the biggest church it might not be seven figures in their bank account but they've got one reward they're looking for at the end of the day at the end of their earthly journey they're looking at the guy in the balcony and they're looking to hear him say well done they're not worried about their reputation as much as they're worried about what the man in the balcony has to say listen what does it matter if the whole world embraces you and god rejects you what does it profit a man if you would gain the world and lose his own soul amen i think about brother talk about the value of a soul why would a man sell his soul it's only because he doesn't really realize the value of it it's no different than a modern day esau sold his birthright for a mesopotamia he didn't realize what the birthright was really worth that's why he didn't esteem the birthright amen and that's why you see so many churches today that either take grace and they turn into disgrace and lasciviousness and you can do whatever and all kinds of nonsense or we'll go the other way towards some sort of legalism and this and that they can't stay with the true message of grace amen i believe that's the message we have it's a true message of grace not a man's idea of a message of grace but it's the true grace of god amen and listen this is what i'm coming to you tonight listen churches they don't like the true preaching of grace do you know why churches don't like the true preaching of grace i'll tell you why because real grace biblical grace makes everything of jesus christ and nothing a man that's why they don't like it they want to have something to do with it or something they can they can inject their own ideas they can't just lay down and say you know i had nothing to do with this i'm here tonight by the grace of god and god alone you didn't choose him he chose you and he called you and he brought you out of the murdery clay but sea man wants to have a reputation oh he's you know he's a better this or he's a greater than that that's got nothing to do with the message of grace amen now listen your reputation might get you far in this life but it's meaningless before an almighty god who knows the very thoughts and intents of the heart because only your character will come i made this point the other day and i'm going to make it again you know sometimes i preach this stuff and huh maybe i've been thought of or accused at some point say brother you you come off kind of suspicious sometimes and i i made this point well i mean to amen listen this is the most ungodly deceiving wicked age there's ever been you've got five people a day that call you on your cell phone wanting to get your social security number or sell you swamp land or you you've got a warrant out for your arrest in texas call this number they're trying to deceive you everywhere you go every news channel every voice on the internet everything son of god is trying to pull you away from this kingdom it's more deceiving today than it's ever been help me out somebody listen satan's not content to just stay on the internet he's not content to just stay on cnn he'll come right in your home right in your church right into your own life if you let him right well praise the lord listen uh a youth of growing up outside of church a youth of watching television advertising and and and watching the news tonight has filled me with a great sense of disbelief and the power of man to tell the truth i think it was georgia of course i'm not here to quote george orwell tonight but he said i noticed from an early age every time i read a newspaper it was wrong and that's about listen they're looking to sell you something and if they can lie to you and sell you more they're going to lie to you because they want money and churches preachers many of them in the same way oh praise the lord well listen brother brown saw an ad one time saw that for that dish soap and they saw that said man i'm gonna be a hero in my home you got that stuff but i'll just dip it in there so he had had the breakfast made up got all the plates all eggy said and sister meaty's gonna wash the dishes i've got let's watch this dipped it in the water pull it out guess what it was exactly the same as he put it in did it two or three times well i guess i'm doing the dishes man he thought he's gonna be the hero guess what advertising lied to him shocking but ma'am said guess what he said i don't believe anything on television no more that's about how i feel about it say brother you just warned these people listen paul when i read you the scripture what's he saying verse 18 don't let any man be god he's warning the church listen you read paul's epistles that's what he does all the time you say oh man you're just getting you're getting worked up listen i remind you that paul when he when he went to melitus and he called the elders of ephesus together and he gets them together what did he do he warns and he said i warned you day and night is that right don't forget watch listen paul he tells timothy amen i'll read it to you first timothy chapter four paul says now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed and seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies and hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron go to verse six for the sake of time but he goes through some of these things and paul makes this point i want you to catch this now he says if you put the brethren in remembrance of these things remind them of the deception remind them how it's supposed to be in the latter times if you remind them of these things put them in remembrance of these things thou shalt be a good minister of jesus christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine whereunto thou hast attained amen listen paul did not tell timothy that if you present some deep reasoned intellectual i'd be a theological argument and you just confound the people you'd be a good minister neither did he tell somebody listen if you just preach like a house on fire and get the people excited and they all just get behind and they love you oh man that should be a good ministry he didn't say that right amen see that's what we do listen well he this brother brother brown talks about that actually oh this brother he's so annoying and he just preaches like this and he makes the point hitler was anointed christian's annoyed listen heaven was a good preacher kirsten's a good preacher stalin's a good preacher listen they might listen that's what i'm coming to man there's a lot of difference between a good preacher and a good minister there's a lot of people they're good preachers but they're not very good ministers well praise the lord see that's their reputation oh he's a good preacher i've never heard anybody preach oh man he just saw this and he saw that that's the reputation but what's the character say because a minister is a servant and a true minister is looking to hear well then when nobody wants to hear it when nobody wants to believe it amen listen these men these apostles these prophets of old they didn't sit there and preach to a church like i'm preaching to you tonight where everybody just loves everything they had to say the people that pursued hated them for it they killed them for it but they did it anyway because they were faithful to the call of god what is the minister of servant amen listen my goal i'll just say this personally my goal in life is not to be a good preacher so much but to be a good minister to be faithful with the word of god amen and a good minister will remind you of the deception he'll remind you about seducing spirits and doctrines of devils amen because he's not trying to impress you he's not concerned about what you think about him he's concerned about your soul oh man this guy's a good preacher listen there's stadiums full of good preachers there's churches with 50 000 people and they got a good preacher and there's one person in the building even stayed hey man a good minister his reputation is not it doesn't influence his his approach to god amen his appraisal is from god that shall be a good minister amen as i mentioned acts chapter 20 paul he goes to these elders he says don't forget i was i said i warned you day and night hey man maybe they got tied up man paul you're just always saying the same thing but listen there was a reason for it brother ram talks about it in the fifth seal that stern little apostle he said he looked out into eternity and he saw it coming that's why he warned him that's why he put it out there listen i'm i'm not here to tell you tonight oh man you just be able to get away with anything nothing's coming your way everything that satan has all hell is against this revelation this man not only did he warn him day night but he with tears he said tears they warned them day and night what do you want them grievous wolves he said grievous wolves are going to come in and enter in not sparing the don't think for one second you taking a foothold it would be okay well we'll work it out he won't spare one if he could help it not sparing the flock he says also of your own selves oh praise the lord somebody didn't say if you get on cnn listen to don lemon hey man he didn't say if you listen to joe biden you're your favorite politician or your least favorite politician of your own selves shall men arise and what shall they do draw disciples after them amen well jesus says that false prophets they were sheep's clothing listen the grievous wolves don't wear grievous wolves clothing they wear sheep's clothing they look like you they sit in church with you they act like you they're 99.99 with you hey man amen that's like i said look cnn's not drawing disciples we're doing this we're worried about everything out there amen what about what's trying to come in here not necessarily this building but i mean we're not exempt is what i'm trying to get at we're so worried about what culture and the popular ideas and hollywood says about it but of your own well praise the lord that's what i'm saying you know i somewhere in the message we got this idea that we're exempt from that like how well it can happen in a message church listen it's happening every age listen wherever men are it happens because that's what satan uses he uses men he's got ministers that look like ministers of life is that right well praise the lord every age they lose their first love men arise in the race they draw men after away from the lord amen and we act like well i'm not in the message church listen it's already happened in message churches you've got two souls and five souls and a hundred this and polygamy this and blasphemy this and thunder you've got every kind of thing and it calls itself message but it's the fruit of it it's not what it was it's not the bible amen and this is what i'm trying to say amen it has already happened and if it has happened before that means it can happen again and likely is happening now somewhere it's likely going on now amen and i it's like i had to i did a youth bible study here about a month or so a couple months back these young people you know they get raised in a certain church and they just they just take it for granted not just young people but even older people we just take it for granted oh you know the pastor would never lie to me well that's what all these people thought in their church too well the deacon or this star brothers oh brother so-and-so he's he's got this many people he's got a twitter account or whatever it is listen all these people thought the same thing and they were all deceived you've got to go back and you've got to see it in the word you've got to have a revelation for yourself amen well praise the lord brother graham says this he said anything that's unusual it springs up if it's called into question and i think it's no more than right it should be calling the question is it i think that pastors sometimes are suspicious of things that they hear and i think they have a right to be listen if your pastor's looking at something i don't know about that listen let's see he's doing his job is why hey man he's going to make sure he's being fed the right way but praise the lord he says they've got a right to be because if i understand the translation of the word pastor it means a shepherd therefore he is a feeder or a herder of a group of men and women of which the holy spirit has made him the overseer of and he has a right to know what kind of a food his sheep is getting and where it's coming from i think he has a right to what's this got to do with me well i'll read the next sentence if a pastor or sometimes people would just seem to be a little suspicious that should never bother anyone it should only be respects to the man's heart for a man of them that's standing there we'd question it amen i tried to be very careful for myself i'm just speaking for myself as a minister i try to be very careful that i don't ask people to trust me i want to trust the word of god some guys go oh you should just take my word for i i don't want you to take my word for it i'm actually kind of insulted like i'm just too stupid to deceive you listen if i say something you say you know what i want to see that in the word i say praise god somebody wants to read the bible somebody wants to hear a quote i say praise god listen paul when he come to the marines they were more noble than those in thessalonica they searched the scriptures they they said they don't offend me if a man wants to see it in the world i say praise god we all know i'll see it there well praise the lord that's the truth amen listen paul paul paul let you know for himself he said if we or an angel from heaven or anybody would preach it let's say he threw himself right in there he said don't even let me do it to you if it's a different gospel let him be cursed amen so i don't need you know people they do this it's like a bandwagon religion amen well we're in this camp we're in this camp we don't not to be doing that we're supposed to know better listen again i'll use paul paul himself at corinth he had the very same thing well we're with apollos's group and you have these other guys oh paul we're with you paul we're not with that group and the church that we're with paul's group hey hey paul we're right here with you we're behind you paul we love you more in that group and paul didn't say good job boys let's get over here we'll show them hey paul we're right behind you you know what you need to go repent you're being carnal amen i don't need you to rally behind me you follow me as i follow christ and if i don't follow christ you don't follow me paul doesn't need the acclamation he doesn't need his own followers he's looking for disciples of jesus christ and while we're being suspicious tonight i'll just be real honest with you some guy and i you know it's like anything else as a minister you have people that say oh brother i'm behind you you'll never fail please don't say that you put me in a bad spot amen oh brother i'm right behind you and i'll follow listen i don't need it and i don't want it i just want you to follow the word amen because even this apostle like i said he rebuked this idea these texts and this division and if he felt that way about then what is it today right and besides that most of the time some guy gets behind him oh man i'm wishing you know i'm right behind you behind you all the way he's usually not actually with you he's trying to sell you something he's a salesman amen brother brad said nine times out of ten he's the one causing the trouble well praise the lord amen what's this all got to do with humility well this is my message tonight amen now you've probably not heard this too many times preached this way but my message to you tonight is to quit being so humble because usually when i preach it somebody gets up and they're like amen somebody was waiting for this i don't wait for a preacher to tell me all these years quit being so humble now let me qualify now amen now i'm making a point we humble ourselves too much towards men and not enough to god because we fear men more than we fear god amen that's why it ain't like it used to be that's the false humility amen it's not what it used to be it's not quite the same because people have lost the fear of god they fear men they fear politics they fear they fear everything in the world but they don't fear god so and that's what i'm getting at i don't believe in being fake humble hey man if i'm arrogant i'm just gonna admit it i guess it's better than being fake humble hey man listen i made this point on the way up here to my wife i said most message people i'm just be real honest with you now most message people they're just too nice we're just too nice we're always trying to be nice to every and get along when we don't cause trouble well the bible says there's as much as within you you should live peacefully with all men and i'm like that supposedly this there's a point somewhere that you can't live peacefully with all men or would you say live peacefully with all men but it doesn't say that if you can do it because there comes a place in a christian life as a christian you've got to stand and be identified and bear the reproach of this word listen there are going to be times in your life where you can't play nice because you've got to stand for the truth praise the lord well hallelujah see most people in church are just too nice that's why so much foolishness goes on in the first place we just permit it well praise the lord i'll give you some quotes so you can say amen tonight it's like i heard a brother the other day if you can't say amen you should at least say ouch amen brother braham says this a lot of people has the wrong impression of christ some people think that christ was a christ was the greatest of all men he was the example man not only was he man but he was god man he was god with us emmanuel he was the humblest of all men but you can be too humble oh there that's a good quote phew you can be too humble you can get so humble until the devil would make a puppet out of you he was humble enough to wash the disciples feet he was forgiving enough to pray for those who drove spikes in his hands but he was man enough to plate ropes and run the money changers out of the house now i'm just i'm just using these quotes and these this one's like about deacons but this pertains to us because he's talking about this idea here but the mayor talks about this in church order in 1963 he talks about jesus actually he's shown as a type when he does that as a type of being a deacon and he's ordained these deacons and brother bram says this he says now i know he says look i'm not saying it dishonorably by you trustees or deacons or pastor but i'm just telling you see what's truth and this is what it must be he says what does it he says no everybody's talking to these deacons and stuff these trustees he says everybody you all good natured every one of you men are good natured if it wasn't so i'd say well all but brother stone so in other words if you weren't good nature we'd yeah we're not going to have this guy all the brothers so he's not got a good nature we're all praying for him it's funny he says but you do have good natures and you're long-suffering gentle quiet sort of men that's fine but don't be a with that amen jesus was good in nature too but when it come time to say things it is written my father's house is made a house of prayer and you're making it a den of thieves see he didn't know when to speak and when not to now i'm just going to drop this in here that's usually where we get it mixed up we usually speak when we shouldn't and we don't when we should but jesus knew when to speak and when not to that's what we got to do never was a person like jesus he was god and remember talk about being a dick in the church he took over he put some ropes together and he didn't wait to gently walk them out he beat them out of the house of god amen praise the lord again brother brahma says in 58 church order the pastor must be a man that's got a very humble way about him but not too humble but what it could be like the lord jesus when he seen wrong going on in the church he played the ropes and ran them out of the church amen again brother graham says the very first step to successful christianity to show that a man has received the holy spirit is humility real god given humility it must be given humbly but yet a church without a doctrine it's like a jellyfish it has no backbone you've got to have a backbone in it god talked to moses brother man says that's what's the matter with the church tonight we got a wishbone instead of the backbone what we need is something in there that'll stand you up he says amen every man that's ever amounted to a hill of beings had to fight for what he got god don't give it to you on a silver platter listen we own ourselves too much to men and not enough to god amen we're gonna humble ourselves to god and a man that will humble himself to god will occasionally humble himself to man and sometimes he'll stand right up in their face depending on what the will of god is amen if you humble yourself to god god might have you humble to this man if you're wrong or he might have you getting his face in tom he's wrong just like john the baptist did king ahead if you're humble to god then you're pro the whole thing praise the lord i'll give you this example brother brand was at the chicago ministerial association one day and you probably know this story but the lord showed brother man i think it's three days prior that they were laying this trap for him they were going to question him on the serpent scene the preaching of grace and predestination and all these different things the initial evidence and so he saw this in the vision he knew there was a trap they were going to change the location they're going to try to trap him he tells these two other brothers and they're like well man we don't even want to go now and the one quarter of the rams talking about is billy paul come up to him and it's funny how a teenage son how he acts but billy paul says oh you're going to go over there and fuss with him because you know how brother man thought about fuss and see we do that we justify that well i don't want to fuss with people but the map said we don't fuss well that's true but that's not what brother bram was going to do oh daddy you're gonna go over there and fuss with them people he said no i'm not going to fuss i'm going over there to guard the mercy seat i've got the word of god i'm anointed by the spirit i'm going over there to guard that mercy saint listen there's a time to be silent but there's a time to speak what we need is some men of god what we need is some women of god that'll go mercy seat in their homes guard this mercy seat in their church go to this mercy seat in their own lives don't let the devil take one thing from you if god give it to you if it's your possession by the grace of god you don't have to humbly well you know i better share with the devil he don't have one thing to do with it that's not you being nice that's not you being humble that's a compromiser it's a compromising cowardly unbelieving spirit that's right amen amen well praise the lord there's a time to be silent but there's a time to speak amen that's what peter dealt with then the booger acts when they when he goes and raises the man up to the gate beautiful and the elders take him aside he said we don't want you to teach in this then we don't want you to do this and peter said listen we can't but speak the things which we have stealing hard i'm obligated to speak what i've seen whether it be right in the sight of god to listen unto you more than god you know judge we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard that's why i can't hold my peace about this message that's why i can't compromise it i'm a witness of what it's done for me i'm a witness of what it's done for others i can't hold my peaks i can't back up on it i can't change it for no man not arrogance that's humility when you used to say you know what i'm going to stand on the word of god no matter what anybody says about it no matter what anybody thinks the word will accuse you of being arrogant but that's humility amen listen the prophet samuel one day he he'd been crying all night kind of like paul he got up one day and the next day he goes down to the armies of israel and king saul's down there he's just gone to the uh malachites and god had told him to utterly destroy everything man woman child whatever and he goes down there he defeats these armies but he takes the best of the flocks and the women and all these things he picked them for a spoil and samuel he shows up at the camp knowing that he's known this man has been rejected he shows up and says what is the meaning this bleeding of the sheep and the longing of the oxen and samuel he says i've taken these things before the lord i did this for god oh i know god said this but i did this thing but i did it for the lord it's okay i'm here to bless god since what we do well yeah i know the bible says this but listen we we can have a bigger meeting we have a bigger this we can we can do we can do more if we just do this we're doing it for the lord samuel says does god delight in sacrifices and burn offerings to obey is better than soccer buddies amen oh what's the big deal god will accept it right brother bam talks about that young fellow said come to me but the man said that young fellow come oh god he just loves me so well brother graham said god is a good god that's true but he's a god of anger oh the god i think that'd be a good sermon title he's a god of anger too he's a god of judgment he's a god of wrath we fail to get that amen you make him so good till you make him some old dodie grandpa he's not a dirty grandfather he is almighty god he don't have no grandchildren he has sons and daughters of god not shook hands and adopted him you must be born again and the blood applied amen samuel tells him listen you've rejected the word of the lord god's rejected you from being king amen and it's at that point saul admits i want you to really catch this now saul admits the reason i did this actually says i feared the people amen i feared the people that see he feared the people more than he feared god he was so worried about brother bram says his pride and his popularity he feared what the people well the people are going to think something about it doesn't matter what the people think if god made you king only god can take you out of it amen he was more concerned about what men thought of him than what god did brothers and sisters that's not a humble man am i looking that's not a humble man that is a coward amen and i'd rather meet god as an infidel than a coward or a hypocrite amen real humility is not how much you can humble yourself to other men it's how much you can humble yourself to god and the will of god and as i said earlier sometimes that will cause you also to humble yourself to men amen but true humility the root or the cause of it it's it's that you humble yourself to god first amen amen to prove this just a few days later here comes another battle israel's got another battle just a few days later and there's a little shepherd boy by the name of david going now we all know the story of david and we love the story of david he goes down there and he sees this philistine and he tells king saul let no man's heart fail thy servant will go and fight amen and notice david's reputation with his own brethren oh we know the naughtiness of your heart you're just a not you're a troublemaker david oh he's the youngest of course so yeah no offense to the youngest here hi moses oh he's the youngest he's just he thinks he's a big shot he's trying to play with the big boy oh we know the naughtiness of your heart we know your pride david now notice they accused him not of humility but of pride and yet he was humble because he believed god because true humility always looks like pride to an unbeliever i mean if you're trying to look humble it's not going to look humble to the world they're going to think you're arrogant oh it's the pride of us david's pride he's just so stuck up believing god and he thinks he's all that now he was just humble enough to take god at his word he's just doing this to cause trouble he just thinks he's all that but i love david's response is there not a cause do i have a reason to do this listen i've got a reason to be here i'm going to reason listen tonight you and i haven't got a reason to be here what am i here because we think we're better than somebody we're not here for some religious pretense we're here because there's a reason we've got a cause to stand and believe this message and to preach a token and to confess it over our homes we've got a reason to stand and fight tonight not against flesh and blood blood principalities powers rulers of darkness god chose a few handful of people out of michigan defining its demon powers which if it existed since time immemorial you've got to cause the fight you're not arrogant you just believe god let them say what they want because at the end of the day they weren't singing songs about king saul they weren't singing songs about david's brethren they were singing solace saying the thousands but david ten thousands you might get called a renegade you're gonna you're gonna get accused of being arrogant but you're going to have a testimony and that testimony you're going to overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony amen that's why paul could say i am not ashamed i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ it is the power of god and the salvation i don't have one reason to apologize or back up for this gospel now listen if david had gone there and said i'm going to do this brother said oh well we just think you're being arrogant he kind of well i don't want to think that about me what would have been the result of it i mean see he wasn't moved by what his brethren thought about him or even what the king thought about it now i'm just going to drop this in here real quick if you want to see if a person is really humble as opposed to fake humble or whatever you want to really know if a person has humility or they're humble you look at how they respond to two things how do they respond to criticism and how do they respond to flattery right because the way they respond that will show you if they're concerned about their reputation or if they're concerned about the will of god amen brother brown makes this i i i use this for a while i thought martin luther said brother graham talks about it actually it's a sermon the law having a shadow but he said brother bram says you are dead your life it's hid in god and sealed by the holy ghost he said how could the devil ever get to him brother ben uses this example he said did you ever hear a dead man tell a lie he said did you ever hear a dead man fuss back at you you could stand at his casket and fuss at him all night he will never say a word why he's dead listen if your life is hidden with christ and god and you're dead to the things of the world i can make fun of you all night long i can try to lift you up oh you're just so great and flatter you they don't move you any more than a dead man in a casket you're dead it doesn't affect you and if you've really died to the things of the world it don't matter if they love you and they make a god out of you or whatever or they want to make you the devil and shoelace they can say whatever they want it doesn't move you because you were never motivated by what they said in the first place amen it astounds me i drop this in here this astounds me it's incredible because people they they go to church and we sit here and people that sing songs about the devil and they testify with the devil this and then we'll just sit here talk about the devil all day long we'll fuss about the devil we'll shout about the devil we'll call him every kind of name in the book and run them down and listen i i see people do this i'm thinking why do they care what the devil says about him amen people in church i noticed this now even around the message message people forgot church people forgot the devil's not your biggest enemy satan is not your biggest enemy tonight you are your biggest enemy tonight well they said this listen if you're dead it doesn't matter you get this guy under submission you crucify this thing that stuff won't move here no more i can preach a whole nother sermon on that but people want to do that they want to fuss and they want to fuss and they want to fox we're going to fuss with the devil and brother brahm said he wants you to foster them as much as he wants if he could he gets you to fuss with them day and night he says it's like a snake if you got a snake you don't punch it you leave him alone listen he's already defeated we act like he's the boogeyman you are your own biggest enemy see we love to preach this oh it's us versus this and that's versus the no you crucify this guy you put him on a cross every day and you make sure he's dying and write it out the rest of that won't even move you brother ram said you're like a mystic you walk in a world alone you and god amen oh we love beating up the devil what about yourself no one wants to die like i always say we all want resurrection life but none of us want to die listen if you have died to self and you can rot out satan can't move you pop culture can't move you men's opinions can't move you politics can't move you you're not moved by what you see you're not moved by what you feel you're moved by one thing what you believe that's the only thing that moves the believer we walk not by sight but by faith so who is your real enemy then i'm saying this because i want you to understand where i'm coming from this idea of deception and all these things going on this this false humility why this is why i'm preaching the same and we we come from a country that's where i'm gonna kind of bring this to a head tonight we come from a country we went to the henry ford museum today we saw the the replica of the declaration of independence we live in this great country a country as i said earlier it was founded on religious freedom it was founded think about these men some of them were businessmen some of them were shopkeeps some were 39 years old some were 70 years old these men signed their name on a paper and defied the greatest nation and kingdom that was in the world at the time because they believed in the call that they were standing for this country out of this country america this i don't i've haven't checked out the number but we have sent more money for missions i'm talking about the whole country now throughout there are 200 some years of existence we've sent more money we've had more preachers with some some of the greatest ministry that's ever been come out of this country will you bring it on this last church come out of america and i'm saying all this for a reason you look in america you look what god could have done with it and yet today in america by and large you go to most churches most of what calls itself christianity most of what calls itself christianity and america today has failed it's failing brothers and sisters it's hardly anything like it used to be amen it's not what it used to be amen we've we've done more we've god is god has waved every kind of assignment from this generation let's we've got the message in our own language and yet it's more and more christianity has failed in america most churches today are about as christian as disney and hallmark i'm saying all this now listen churches in america used to be the primary influence of our culture amen people went to church on sunday they went to church on wednesday they heard the word of god they based their lives and their decisions maybe they were even just raised that way and they weren't even it but they were our laws in this country the women conducted themselves that was the greatest influence in our country but somewhere that changed amen now america's greatest influences of their culture is media and entertainment and all this stuff now this is why i'm saying this we tend in church we blast that all these the the television and the news and the radio and all the stuff but here's what i want you to understand christianity in america has not failed because of hollywood it's not failing because of liberal politicians or socialism or communism or foreign interference america in america christianity is failing because christian men stopped acting like men amen well these guys do this no you've got it backwards christian men stopped acting like christian men that's why all these influences took over they let the bars down the goats listen we we want to demonize everything else but christian men stopped acting like men christian women stopped acting like ladies that's why it all come in you've got no one to let not us personally i'm saying necessarily but we've got no the churches they've got no one to blame but themselves why is the wise why does america listen to the hollywood star why are they listening because you all let the bars down well praise the lord you say i don't know about that i got a quote for you here so praise the lord i'm ready i got my ammunition brother man says don't worry about communism whipping us we done whipped ourselves it's our own rotten morals and where did it start from because the gospel was let down at the pulpit where it began sissified preachers with not enough real baptizing of the holy spirit in their soul to stand and tell the word of god listen i get it we see all these millennials and this that and they're dumb they don't know anything well who didn't teach them that's right that's good brother brown said don't spank the child for juvenile delinquently speak the parents it's parent delinquency they let them get by with it he said that's the reason i wreck across that clergy there how can you read the same bible i am some of those 400 prophets down there in israel read the same bible that mike kai read but he was willing spiritually to take his stand amen he said amos in his day that fearless prophet of god he walked up there to samaria he looked over that city he's seen all the corruption that was in it he said the very god that you claim that you love will destroy you well that's denomination that's pentecostals listen like i said i'm saying with them nothing more to come right into message church he's done it before you are not exempt because you have a 1963 cloud on the wall or the hoffman's head of christ inside that does not accept you it takes the baptism of the holy ghost and the word of god and if we let down the bar one inch we have allowed a place that's why the bible says be angry and sin not don't give place to wrath amen don't let the sun go down your wrath neither give place to the devil listen he can only take what you let him take it's no different than israel today they've had a six days war they've had all kinds of aggressors and they have possessed land but over the years they've compromised for peace well we just need to give up a little bit we just need to give this back and their enemies are the ones that come against them first and we'll do the same thing with this model well you know i know the message says this but i don't want people to think i'm a fanatic why do you care they're not the ones that dictate where you're going to the end of your life well i don't want to get persecuted well all that live gothic christ listen we don't i'm just gonna be real honest with you we don't even have it hardly as bad as they have some places even the world today we get so worried well i don't want to offend somebody well woe under them who are offended in him we should be worried about attending god and not other man that's right i know what this preacher to do a bunch of sissies that's all it is well praise the lord you look at our food you look at you look at men in their estrogen i'm gonna go on a rant now i guess hey man listen it's like i said our whole culture has been designed to sissify the man do you know why because he's more pliable when the government wants to do whatever we want well we don't want to fight we don't want to hurt nobody man we used to shoot people for raising our taxes what's the truth i got in trouble for this last time i'm not advocating violence tonight listen it's it's it's by satan's eating is by design he doesn't want you to stand on the word of god in the face of adversity he wants you to go with the flower well don't hurt nobody's feelings moving to safe space there's no safe space in the tribulation but a rapture to get you out of here listen brother brown said if we can you know we would preach or an invincible army brother bram said so well what he actually said was if she if the bride knows who she is what she stands for she can do the great works she'll be an invincible army if she can discern and withst stand not discern and politely ask well you know maybe we could maybe we could compromise a little bit maybe we could just you know get along with people you know brother you just you're just you're just always causing trouble so did jesus listen when they come to the house of jason the book of acts they said these that have turned the world upside down that have come bunch of rivalrizing troublemakers well praise the lord discern and with listen if you can discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan is just as powerless before you as he was back there on the shores of galilee hey man i said we get rid of the fear and the scare in our lives and our homes let's serve god let's let's humble ourselves according to the word of god amen my humility i don't oh there's a brother he's so humble he's just so sweet what i want is there's a brother that believes god no matter what anybody else says about it there's a sister that takes god at his word and believes what she's prayed no matter what everybody else says about it that's the kind of testimony we gotta have tonight amen familiar quote tonight brother branham says this he says how we need in jeffersonville i see how we need here tonight in fenton how we needed jefferson for thousands of live voices the thunder of god thundering on sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lies walking around the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's thunder against the enemy i'm going somewhere he says the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil we do i'm gonna show the devil listen i don't need to show him anything what i praise the lord we do this like we're gonna give him well hallelujah somebody's gonna get mad at this i guess we do this well i'm gonna go give him a black guy i'm gonna show him i'm gonna show him nothing he's already defeated you you don't have to defeat him tonight quit acting like you're fighting with it he's defeated oh i'll show him you want to show him live this kind of a life oh i could shout i could listen so could the prophets are male but only one of them people could call down fire from heaven why at your word lord i've done this the devil don't care how loud you can holler i mean you can still holler now man but i'm just saying satan's not impressed but he's not impressed by how loud you can get or how smart you are doesn't even move him i gotta finish this quote sometime tonight you don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shot but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil now watch this because the people like this he said the same quote keep going here he says just like well you say well if he could preach like a billy graham or an oral roberts or somebody a great influential speaker he'd be oh no sometimes the devil just laughs at that oh i wish i could be like so-and-so i wish i could sing like sometimes the devil just sitting there laughing it don't mean nothing to him he don't pay no more attention to that than nothing you get all the theology you want to and all the seminary training the devil just sit back and laugh at it but when he sees that life look at those disciples down there that maniac child that day with epilepsy saying come out of them devil come out of them devil come out of them double the devil sitting there now aren't you just making a pretty shame of yourself now you see what you're doing jesus told you he commissioned to cast me out now what are you gonna do but brother when he's seen him coming amen one come walking quietly uh-huh oh my he didn't have to say nothing the devil was already scared right then that's the kind of you don't have such a reputation to help you don't even have to open your mouth you walk in the room and they start crying out how did you come to torment us before the time didn't have to sit there and kick the pulpit and get mad and run around he just walked up that's why even when the weakest christian gets on the knees the devil's tremble the devil was already scared then he knew he had to leave right there because there come a life not only a sermon but a life said come out of him oh my that done it quietly he know what he was talking about he knowed what he was doing amen listen we ought to know what we're doing hey man i mentioned those three things earlier she should know who she is man we we sit and we preach it you ought to know who you are by now you've been in the i've been in the mystery for 40 years i shouldn't have to tell you who you are you should know that by now let's go a little bit further with it let's take this great commission and roll over everything that gets in our way hey man why are people so tossed about today they're scared of everything they're scared of each other i know why the scripture tells us why the wicked flees when no man even pursues we're so scared about things happening just that are never even going to happen what if they don't like me when this person we'd burn all these bridges and cross all these bridges and we never even yet tom the one can play with no man pursues but the righteous they're as bald as a lion i was reading the kids out of first chronicles here the other day let's talk about david's mighty men i love this description the bible says every one of them had a face like a lion no that's not why i have my beard tonight everyone yeah you looked at these guys and you said man i don't want to tangle with those guys amen every one of the mighty men i said god give us a church tonight that's so rugged such battle-hearted soldiers amen that everybody looks at them and runs the other way amen praise the lord somebody we're not here tonight a bunch of green recruits we are veterans we've been through some battles i hope we've won a few listen there's something wrong if we lose every battle because joshua's army don't lose battle listen joshua lost one battle and he said hold everything this isn't normal i'm not used to losing and some people sit in church that's all they do well i got defeated here and undefeated there and the devil this the man where are you gonna get some victory at well this is our victory that overcometh the world eating our faith hey man listen we ordained to have victory we're not ordained to be witch we're ordained to do the whoopin hey man now listen it's not the size of the dog in the fight that's what we do well my church i'm not real big i'm i'm the least in my this and this it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog hey man it's not god's not going to give it to us on the silver platter now it's time to stand up and fight amen i hope you know where i'm coming from tonight amen we let all this nonsense go even in our lives and our churches and the pressure of this age it's like every age but it's worse this age the pressure is just just you know just to go with the flow don't don't cause any trouble don't we we don't want to we don't want to we don't want to make any waves or anything amen but listen if the lord is the light of my life what can man do unto me god is for us who can be against us praise the lord so i hope you'll take this to heart tonight don't be too humble amen don't be so humble that you let the enemy push you around you let men push you around humble yourself to god amen listen if you can humble yourself to god you can stand before anything i believe that if the lord's on your side there's no reason to ever fear as you stand to your feet tonight let's be concerned tonight with our character we want to perfect holiness in the sight of the lord the scripture says let let's let's dedicate ourselves maybe just power our heads from it let's let's just have a rededication i know you have a dedication service this this week and i believe you have a blessed service but for ourselves as individuals why don't we just rededicate ourselves tonight say lord i want to i want to be more sold out tonight than i've ever been i don't want to look back from this night in my past and see that i've let the bars down that i've compromised but i want to i want to be able to stand tonight and say lord i'm more sold out to you tonight as i get ready to go into this these meetings this weekend i want to come with a real fervent sea and an expectation lord i'm more dedicated i'm more ready i'm more willing to fight i'm more willing to stand i'm more willing to believe you tonight than i've ever been in my life if you don't feel that way tonight now is the time we sing that song at the beginning jesus is here i believe that with your head's bowed let us pray heavenly father lord tonight i pray you take these these blessed saints here lord out of all the people in fat and they might be a just a small group but i believe they're mighty men of valor i believe they're chosen and set aside for service unto the king lord tonight may we stand we not falter can we not be like a brute a a reed shaking in the wind then we stand like a john the baptist then we stand like an isaiah like a jeremiah like a william branham may we stand in the face of adversity and realize our humility to god amen lord our humility is that lord what right do we have to hold our peace what right do we have to compromise this word you've done everything you made us who we are you give us life

teach my children the message of the hour each of their souls i've got a wife tonight her soul they're each with ten thousand worlds to you for my own soul worth ten thousand lord it cost the son of god amen it cost the son of god to purchase this what kind of a price could we put on that to sell out or to compromise oh god we want to be more dedicated tonight yes lord i pray this people you just give them a a real backbone lord if there be one here tonight like a sham guard been pushed around and pushed around lord may you give him a real backbone tonight just to take the word of god and
