[31:51] forward. Amen. and just sing the only
[31:53] real peace. Amen.
[31:58] The [singing] only
[32:00] real peace that I have, dear Lord,
[32:05] [singing] is in you.
[32:10] The [singing]
[32:10] only real peace that I have, [singing]

[32:21] In all life frustrations,
[32:25] I need you. I know [singing] I do.

[32:44] The [singing] only real peace that I
[32:48] have, dear Lord, [singing] is in you.
[32:55] The [singing] only real peace that I
[32:59] have, dear Lord, is in you. [singing]

[33:51] In all life's frustrations,
[33:55] I need you. I know I do.
[34:02] For the only [music and singing]
[34:04] real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in
[34:10] you.
[34:13] Amen. Isn't that the truth?
[34:18] &gt;&gt; There is nothing that gives you peace
[34:20] like God.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; His peace passes all understanding.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; His peace will see you through every
[34:28] storm.
[34:31] And I'm so grateful that God has peace
[34:34] for his children. Amen. We're going to
[34:36] read a little bit about it in our
[34:38] opening scripture. If you want to turn
[34:40] there to the book of Numbers, Numbers
[34:42] chapter 6. We know that we don't often
[34:44] read out of this book. It's
[34:47] uh kind of
[34:49] uh just it has numbers and things in
[34:52] orders and a lot of compartmentalizing
[34:57] structure, sacrifices. And so we don't
[35:00] read often in this, but we do want to
[35:04] take our opening scripture from here
[35:06] today. I want to welcome my
[35:08] mother-in-law here today. And as uh
[35:11] maybe brother Ron had already mentioned,
[35:13] Cheryl's mother Nancy Whailing. And uh
[35:17] Cheryl was telling me that today um we
[35:20] have four generations.
[35:22] Her mom's here, her daughter Ann is
[35:25] here, and her granddaughter Emma is
[35:28] here.
[35:29] So, usually we only see that when we
[35:32] have Thanksgiving and gettogethers, but
[35:35] to have it in church, that's a blessing.
[35:37] Amen.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; So, we want to welcome her. And I when I
[35:41] came in, I saw your coat on. I thought I
[35:43] better turn up the heat cuz
[35:46] [laughter]
[35:47] in our house, uh, she was a little bit
[35:49] cold. And you can imagine how our house
[35:51] is. It's just like the sanctuary. So,
[35:54] uh, I asked if we could turn the heat up
[35:56] there a little bit. So, um, I, uh,
[35:59] turned it up a little bit here and
[36:01] hopefully we'll be able to get warm and
[36:03] and enjoy the word today. But before we
[36:06] begin reading, let's just look to the
[36:08] Lord in a word of prayer. And that's his
[36:10] blessings on the furtherance of this
[36:12] service today. Heavenly Father, we thank
[36:15] you for the peace that you have for your
[36:17] people.
[36:21] It is the necessary
[36:24] thing to help us through troubled times.
[36:29] Your peace keeps us in a place of calm
[36:34] and uh confidence
[36:37] and assurityity
[36:40] that we will make it through.
[36:44] And so we thank you today for your
[36:47] peace. And we thank you today for your
[36:51] grace
[36:52] because it's your grace that gives us
[36:55] peace, Lord.
[36:57] Father, we pray that uh you would bless
[37:01] your people today as they have gathered
[37:03] in your house to worship you, to receive
[37:05] of your word. May you come in this time
[37:10] as the word is being delivered that you
[37:12] would give us ears to hear, eyes to see,
[37:16] a heart to receive.
[37:18] Lord, let us leave here with more of you
[37:20] than when we came
[37:22] and that we would have more trust in you
[37:27] to help us in our daily life with all
[37:29] the trials and things that we go
[37:31] through. Lord, we're depending upon you.
[37:34] Ask these blessings upon the word upon
[37:37] your people now for we pray these things
[37:39] and give you thanks in advance now in
[37:42] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Numbers chapter 6 starting with
[37:47] verse number 22.
[37:50] And the Lord spoke
[37:53] unto Moses saying,
[37:57] speak unto Aaron and his sons. Now this
[38:01] is the priesthood. God is speaking to
[38:03] Moses the prophet saying to the
[38:05] priesthood
[38:08] saying, "Oh th on this wise ye shall
[38:12] bless the children of Israel. saying
[38:16] unto them, "The Lord bless thee and keep
[38:20] thee. The Lord make his face to shine
[38:23] upon thee, and be gracious unto thee.
[38:27] The Lord lift up his countenance upon
[38:30] thee, and give thee peace,
[38:33] and they shall put my name upon the
[38:37] children of Israel, and I will bless
[38:40] them." Amen. God bless. You may be
[38:42] seated.
[38:46] We want to entitle this message, God's
[38:47] grace is enough.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; And for a subject, there is strength in
[38:54] God's grace.
[38:57] Here we see in our opening scripture
[38:59] here that we know that the children of
[39:02] Israel did not deserve God.
[39:09] But God came and he blessed his people.
[39:13] And he wanted the ministry to say to the
[39:16] people, "The Lord bless thee. The Lord
[39:18] keep thee. The Lord make his face to
[39:21] shine upon thee and be gracious unto
[39:25] thee. The Lord lift up his countenance
[39:28] upon thee, and give thee peace."
[39:33] This was the grace of God given to his
[39:36] people.
[39:38] And we all need grace.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard of someone being a
[39:43] thorn in your flesh?
[39:48] Like uh
[39:51] it's kind of a repeat thing. When you
[39:53] think of a thorn in your flesh, you're
[39:55] thinking something that's repeat.
[39:58] Well, thorn in my flesh refers to a
[40:01] source of continual annoyance or trouble
[40:04] or pain.
[40:07] Now, I don't want you to go home and
[40:08] start talking to somebody about them
[40:11] being a thorn in your flesh,
[40:15] but we have to just
[40:17] lay the foundation here.
[40:21] And if you want, you can turn with me to
[40:23] 2 Corinthians chapter 12.
[40:26] There was given to Paul a thorn in the
[40:29] flesh.
[40:31] The Bible says, "The messenger of Satan
[40:33] to buffet me lest I should be exalted
[40:37] above measure." Now, he had this problem
[40:41] to which Satan continuously
[40:44] buffeted him. Was a thorn in his side.
[40:48] Now, anybody that's ever had something
[40:50] prick them continuously,
[40:53] it's the automatic thing. Stop. This
[40:55] thing's got to stop.
[40:59] Well, we'll pick this up in verse eight
[41:02] here. Paul having this, he says, "For
[41:05] this thing I besought the Lord three
[41:08] times,
[41:10] three separate times, that it might
[41:13] depart from me."
[41:17] And God said unto him, "My grace is
[41:21] sufficient for thee,
[41:25] for my strength is made perfect in
[41:27] weakness.
[41:29] And this was such a powerful revelation
[41:33] to Paul
[41:35] that he began to look at his trials
[41:38] differently.
[41:41] He said, "If God's grace is all that I
[41:43] need, THEN WHY DO I got to worry about
[41:45] all my problems?"
[41:48] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Most gladly, therefore,
[41:50] will I rather glory in my infirmities
[41:54] that the power of Christ may rest upon
[41:57] me."
[42:00] Therefore, I take pleasure in
[42:02] infirmities, in reproaches, in
[42:05] necessities. I need this thing for my
[42:07] family, and persecutions, and what I'm
[42:10] going through, in distress. Distress for
[42:12] Christ's sake, for when I am weak, then
[42:17] I am strong.
[42:23] It's much easier
[42:27] to be strong when you trust God.
[42:32] When we try to be strong in ourself and
[42:35] in trying to figure it out and handle it
[42:38] and and do it and rely, the Bible says,
[42:42] "Lean not to thine own understanding,
[42:47] but to trust in the Lord
[42:50] and and and and Jesus was was re this
[42:52] was a this was a revelation to Paul. It
[42:56] was literally Jesus speaking to Paul by
[42:59] revelation. He came to church and he
[43:01] heard the word and something spoke to
[43:04] this is FOR YOU PERSONALLY PAUL. MY
[43:06] GRACE IS SUFFICIENT FOR YOU. EVERYBODY
[43:08] CAN'T RECEIVE THIS REVELATION BUT IT IS
[43:10] FOR YOU.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; I'll say today this word is not for
[43:15] everybody but it is for them who will
[43:18] receive it.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Now that word sufficient it means
[43:23] enough. Just simply means enough. It's
[43:27] enough to meet the need or the purpose.
[43:31] It also means to avail. In other words,
[43:34] my grace will avail for thee, Paul. It
[43:38] also means to be content.
[43:42] Be content with my grace, Paul. It's
[43:45] sufficient.
[43:47] So sometimes we just want the thorn to
[43:50] stop. We want our trial to stop. We want
[43:53] this thing to stop.
[43:56] And and God is wanting us to see him
[43:59] there in the trial handling everything.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; My grace is going to take care of this.
[44:09] But we just can't have the knowledge of
[44:11] his grace taking care of everything. As
[44:13] brother Ron was sharing that we have to
[44:16] have faith in what he said.
[44:19] In other words, we've got to believe
[44:22] that God's grace is really going to take
[44:24] care of it.
[44:27] Now, God provided grace for us to be
[44:29] saved.
[44:31] And think about, I want you to go back
[44:32] before you were saved.
[44:35] We were spiritually dead in trespasses
[44:37] and sin. The Bible says we walked
[44:40] according to the course of this world.
[44:42] And I'll say it like this, the devil's
[44:44] plans.
[44:46] We just did whatever he put on our heart
[44:48] to do. We just did it when our life was
[44:51] buried in the lust of fulfilling our
[44:54] flesh.
[44:56] And we were by nature, our own nature,
[44:59] we were the children of wrath even as
[45:01] everybody else in the world. So we were
[45:03] no different at one time. But the Bible
[45:06] says God was rich in mercy
[45:10] &gt;&gt; for his great love wherewith he loved
[45:14] us.
[45:16] So, we didn't know that we were even
[45:19] lost. God had to come by and say, "Hey,
[45:21] knucklehead, you're lost.
[45:24] You're going to die without me."
[45:28] And his love showed us that we were lost
[45:31] and that Christ was the only way back to
[45:33] the father. Acts 4:12 says, "Neither is
[45:37] there salvation in any other, for there
[45:39] is none other name under heaven given
[45:42] among men whereby we must be saved."
[45:47] The only name is Jesus Christ
[45:53] and it's a revelation.
[45:55] And God's speaking in Isaiah 43:11, if
[45:58] you want to write it down, God is
[46:00] speaking here and he says, "I even I am
[46:03] the Lord and beside me there is no
[46:06] savior."
[46:09] Showing us that the father and Jesus are
[46:12] one. And now did not Jesus say that
[46:14] &gt;&gt; me and my father are one. And he said,
[46:17] "Philip, when you've seen me, you've
[46:19] seen the father." And I just say it like
[46:22] this. God was manifested in the flesh.
[46:25] That's why we pray for our food.
[46:28] Everything we do in the name of the
[46:30] Lord. There is no other name given among
[46:33] men whereby we must be saved. Going back
[46:35] to Ephesians chapter 2 verse8. For the
[46:38] Bible says, for by grace now are you
[46:42] saved.
[46:44] By grace are you saved. It's through
[46:47] faith and that not of yourself. It is
[46:52] the gift of God.
[46:56] not of works, lest any man should boast
[46:59] and say, "Look at me."
[47:02] For we are his workmanship, created in
[47:04] Christ Jesus unto good works, which God
[47:07] have before ordained that we should walk
[47:11] in good works. Amen.
[47:15] So Jesus said, "My grace is sufficient
[47:18] for thee,
[47:19] and grace is what saved us."
[47:23] And when we realized that we could do
[47:25] nothing to save ourselves,
[47:30] God's strength
[47:33] became our strength when we became weak
[47:37] and we realized there was nothing we
[47:39] could do to save oursel.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; So I'm just I'm laying the the the
[47:43] foundation that we all can understand.
[47:46] When we got saved, we realized there was
[47:48] nothing we could bring to the altar to
[47:51] say, "God, I've done this and you know,
[47:54] am I allowed to go to heaven?" He
[47:57] revealed to us that we are sinners and
[47:59] that there is no way for us to be saved
[48:02] but by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; And that was the grace of God. And we
[48:07] are all saved by his grace through
[48:10] believing that Christ died for us.
[48:14] So, we had to become perfectly weak in
[48:16] order to trust in his grace. This is
[48:18] where I'm going with this.
[48:22] Now, ever since Jesus came into our
[48:24] lives, we've been crying, "Grace,
[48:25] grace."
[48:28] We've been crying, "Lord, thank you for
[48:30] your grace."
[48:32] We've been singing, "Do you know grace?
[48:35] Look where you came from and where you
[48:38] are today."
[48:40] So if God's grace was sufficient to save
[48:43] our souls, then his grace is sufficient
[48:47] to meet every need that we have.
[48:52] The problem is we're not trusting him
[48:54] for the needs that we have.
[49:00] And it's the same grace. Think about it.
[49:02] The the greatest thing that God could do
[49:04] is save us.
[49:08] Now, when I'm talking about save us, I'm
[49:11] not saying uh you were in a car and you
[49:14] were burning and I just grabbed you out
[49:17] of the car and I saved you from getting
[49:18] burnt or dying.
[49:21] I'm talking about that his grace
[49:23] literally took my ugly nature and made
[49:26] it his nature.
[49:28] Come on.
[49:30] That is the greatest thing that God can
[49:33] do is take a devil and make him with the
[49:37] nature of God.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Now, if he CAN DO THAT WITH MY NATURE,
[49:42] HOW COME HE CAN'T do that with all my
[49:44] needs?
[49:47] &gt;&gt; We got to start putting God to the test
[49:49] here.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; We got to be say, "God, I'm trusting
[49:52] you." Amen.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; What we what the problem is in all of
[49:55] our trials and our tests, we're not
[49:57] getting weak and saying, "God,
[50:00] &gt;&gt; I'm totally dependent on you.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; I'm totally trusting in you. You're
[50:06] going to take care of this situation.
[50:08] You're going to SEE ME THROUGH. I DON'T
[50:09] HAVE TO WORRY about my future."
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; I don't have to worry about what's going
[50:14] to happen next week. I don't have to
[50:16] worry about my kids
[50:18] because I serve a God whose grace is
[50:21] sufficient.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; We have to do the same thing that we did
[50:30] when we got saved to see our needs be
[50:32] met. And what is that?
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Become completely weak, completely
[50:36] dependent upon God and say, "God, I
[50:39] trust you."
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Just like you trusted him for salvation.
[50:47] Can you Can anybody prove to me that
[50:48] you're saved?
[50:51] Can you prove it to me?
[50:55] Can you Can you prove it? Can you
[50:56] scientifically prove it?
[51:01] The Bible says it's through faith.
[51:05] As soon as you stop believing,
[51:08] you stop your salvation.
[51:12] Yeah. I hate to I hate to say it like
[51:13] that, but you got to the Bible says
[51:17] you've got to maintain your beginning
[51:19] confidence to the end.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; It's you don't you know you go and you
[51:25] buy a house or you buy a car and you go
[51:27] to the bank and you sign the papers and
[51:29] that's it. That house or that car is
[51:32] yours
[51:34] and as long as you keep paying the
[51:36] payments that's yours. But what happens,
[51:39] Sister Lynn, if you stop paying on it?
[51:42] they come and get it. You got to keep
[51:45] believing every day
[51:48] who you are, who you belong to.
[51:52] Grace works when you believe.
[51:58] Now the word grace is unmmerited favor.
[52:02] So it was unmmerited favor that saved us
[52:05] and it's unmmerited favor that will see
[52:07] us through every situation in our life.
[52:11] Jesus said, "My grace is sufficient for
[52:14] thee."
[52:16] It's enough. Think about your situation
[52:19] in your life right now. Every one of
[52:20] you, I don't want you to think about
[52:21] anybody else, but I want you to think
[52:23] about your situation.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Do you wish
[52:31] that it wasn't there?
[52:33] Amen. Love it. Honesty.
[52:36] Do you wish you didn't have to go
[52:38] through it?
[52:40] Do you ask God to take this cup of
[52:42] suffering away from you?
[52:46] Are you battling not wanting to deal
[52:49] with your situations?
[52:52] Let me ask you this. Are you battling
[52:54] being content?
[52:56] Are you battling trusting?
[53:00] Turn with me if you would to Philippians
[53:02] chapter 4. Paul just gets through
[53:05] talking about how to be content for
[53:08] peace and how to possess it and how to
[53:10] how to dwell in it, how to dwell in
[53:13] peace. And we kind of had that last song
[53:15] and I just said, "Thank you, Lord. Thank
[53:17] you for that."
[53:20] But, you know, we need peace in our
[53:22] situations.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; We We just We need peace. And peace
[53:27] comes from trusting in God.
[53:32] And you literally can be content
[53:36] when you got a thorn in your flesh.
[53:39] So here he is in verse chapter 4 verse 6
[53:43] says, "Be careful for nothing, but in
[53:45] everything by prayer and supplication
[53:46] with thanksgiving, let your request let
[53:48] it be made known unto God.
[53:52] And the peace of God which passes all
[53:54] understanding, it's going to keep your
[53:57] heart and your mind, both circles. Now,
[54:01] through Christ Jesus, notice who it's
[54:03] through. It isn't through your
[54:05] understanding.
[54:07] It isn't through somebody saying to you,
[54:09] "Yeah, I I'll do this for you." It's
[54:12] through trusting in God.
[54:15] Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are
[54:17] true and honest and are just and are
[54:20] pure and lovely, whatsoever things of a
[54:23] good report, if there be any strength,
[54:26] if there be any praiseworthy, then
[54:28] you're allowed to think on these things.
[54:31] But if there's not, DON'T THINK ON it
[54:34] &gt;&gt; because what happens when you think on
[54:36] the wrong things? Can anybody does
[54:37] anybody got a testimony for me
[54:41] of what happens when you think on bad
[54:42] things?
[54:44] Do you get peace from doing that?
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Do you GET STRENGTH AND JOY AND FEEL
[54:50] LIKE GOING ON?
[54:52] &gt;&gt; NO. You get beat over the head by the
[54:54] devil.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; God does not speak to us in that way.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; So, we got to learn we all got this
[55:02] responsibility now if we want peace that
[55:04] we have to take our minds and set it
[55:07] upon the right things.
[55:10] Now verse nine, these things which you
[55:13] have both learned, in other words, Paul
[55:16] taught it and received. So he said, I
[55:20] received, I said, amen to the word. I
[55:22] heard it
[55:24] and you seen it in me.
[55:27] You seen it manifest in me that I got
[55:29] this peace. And he says to the church,
[55:31] he says, "Do and the God of peace shall
[55:34] be with you." In other words, what he
[55:36] did for others, he'll do for you. IT IS
[55:38] NO SECRET WHAT GOD can do. What he if he
[55:41] gave peace to one person, he can give it
[55:43] to another.
[55:45] But you got to follow the script. You
[55:48] can't make your own script.
[55:50] You can't deviate from it.
[55:52] You ever deviate from a recipe? What
[55:55] makes a recipe your recipe? Change one
[55:58] ingredient. Right? So when you change
[56:02] one ingredient, it's not the same.
[56:06] If you want the PEACE OF GOD, YOU GOT TO
[56:08] KEEP THE INGREDIENTS,
[56:10] you got to go to the script.
[56:17] And then Paul shares a personal
[56:19] testimony in verse 11 as what helps what
[56:23] helped him to overcome the the feeling
[56:25] of having to to run away from his
[56:28] situation. And and and God, take this I
[56:30] I this bothered ME SO MUCH. I PRAY THREE
[56:33] TIMES, TAKE THIS AWAY from me.
[56:37] And he says, you know what? I'll gladly
[56:40] bear this pain now. Why? Because when I
[56:44] was having this pain
[56:47] in my side,
[56:50] I felt like no one was with me,
[56:55] that God wasn't with me, that I was
[56:59] bearing this pain by myself.
[57:02] But when God told me that his grace was
[57:05] with me, I no further felt that I was
[57:09] alone
[57:11] that I had something more to to think
[57:15] about. I had to keep my mind not on the
[57:17] wrong things but the right things. And
[57:19] what was the right thing? That his grace
[57:21] was with me.
[57:24] His
[57:24] &gt;&gt; grace was with me. If you've got God's
[57:27] grace, you got everything.
[57:31] What a powerful revelation.
[57:34] And starting in verse 11,
[57:37] he says, "Not that I speak in respect of
[57:40] want.
[57:42] For I've learned in whatsoever say I'm
[57:44] in therewith to be content." So Paul,
[57:46] he's starting out. He's making this
[57:47] statement. I I don't want you I'm not
[57:49] talking right now of I want a car. I
[57:52] want a house. I want I I I want a boat.
[57:55] I want another gun. He's not talking
[57:57] about I got to learn to be content and
[58:00] not want those things. He's not talking
[58:01] about that. HE'S TALKING ABOUT WHAT GOD
[58:04] has ordained for your life. Learn to be
[58:07] content.
[58:10] God knows what he's doing.
[58:13] He says, "For for I have learned." In
[58:17] other words, it wasn't a gift.
[58:19] In whatsoever state I am, I am I I I am
[58:25] therewith to be content.
[58:29] Wow. That you know, in order to do that,
[58:32] you can't complain.
[58:34] You can't murmur.
[58:40] You know what it means to be content.
[58:43] You're you're you don't say anything
[58:46] about the thorn.
[58:50] And you have to learn that
[58:53] because as sure as anything and I've
[58:55] seen Emma uh play and sometimes she
[59:00] wants another Oreo cookie.
[59:06] Grandpa will let her have one.
[59:09] But we all have to learn to be content.
[59:14] And here's the big thing. It's not about
[59:16] the cookie or the cars or the bolts or
[59:18] the guns. It's about the trials that
[59:21] we're going through.
[59:23] Do we have the attitude that we're
[59:24] content
[59:27] or are we murmuring and complaining
[59:29] about them? It's some it's not a gift.
[59:31] You have to learn it. And so Paul
[59:34] says,"I know both how to be a base or
[59:39] abase, I'm sorry, abase and I know how
[59:42] to abound
[59:44] everywhere and in all things I am
[59:48] instructed both to be full and to be
[59:52] hungry, both to abound and to suffer
[59:56] need." So what is Paul saying here? It
[59:59] doesn't matter what's going on. I'm
[1:00:02] content.
[1:00:04] I'm right there content.
[1:00:07] And verse 13 is what I want to get to. I
[1:00:10] can do all things through Christ which
[1:00:14] strengthens me.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; My grace is sufficient for you, Paul.
[1:00:20] I'm going to take you through. Don't
[1:00:22] worry about it.
[1:00:24] And so now we don't look to handle all
[1:00:27] of our problems ourself. We get real
[1:00:29] serious about hearing from God.
[1:00:32] God, what do you want me to do? I know
[1:00:35] this. We We can all put in the line
[1:00:37] right here with every one of our trials.
[1:00:40] No matter what your trial is, when it
[1:00:41] comes into the blank, Lord, oh, what
[1:00:44] what do I need to do?
[1:00:47] Trust God.
[1:00:50] It ain't different for anybody's trial.
[1:00:54] The trial is just a tool that God is
[1:00:57] using to build character.
[1:01:01] And what gets you there is trusting God.
[1:01:06] I can do all things through Christ which
[1:01:08] strengthenth me. Why? Because God's
[1:01:11] grace is sufficient.
[1:01:14] Okay? So, we're going to go ahead and um
[1:01:17] I'm going to ask every one of you to go
[1:01:19] dig a hole out here. We're going to
[1:01:20] plant a tree and I'm going to give every
[1:01:22] one of you a a shovel and you're going
[1:01:24] to go out there and you're going to dig
[1:01:25] the hole. And as you're digging, your
[1:01:27] shovels or a couple of your shovels are
[1:01:30] falling apart.
[1:01:33] Now, your shovel is not sufficient
[1:01:38] to dig that hole.
[1:01:41] You need to get another shovel to dig
[1:01:43] the hole.
[1:01:46] When we think about God's grace, it's
[1:01:49] never broken. It's never missing. it.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; There's nothing lacking. It can handle
[1:01:57] everything. If it can save you and
[1:01:59] change your nature, it can meet every
[1:02:01] need you have.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless thee and keep thee.
[1:02:09] The Lord make his face to shine upon
[1:02:11] thee and be gracious to thee. The Lord
[1:02:14] lift up his countenance upon thee and
[1:02:17] give thee peace.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We shouldn't be afraid of
[1:02:21] anything.
[1:02:23] God has not given us a spirit of fear
[1:02:24] but of power, love, and of a sound mind.
[1:02:27] That means we should not be afraid of
[1:02:29] our trials
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; because God's grace is with us.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Psalms 20 verse one. If we could put
[1:02:38] that up. I didn't I didn't uh give that
[1:02:41] to you, but I just I want to share this
[1:02:44] with you. Psalms 20 verse one, two, if
[1:02:47] you want, write it down.
[1:02:49] David said, 'The Lord hear thee in the
[1:02:53] day. The Lord hear thee in the day of
[1:02:55] trouble.
[1:02:57] How many feels like you're in a day of
[1:02:58] trouble?
[1:03:00] Yes. Will the Lord hear thee in the day
[1:03:02] of trouble? The name of God of Jacob
[1:03:04] defend thee, send thee help from the
[1:03:09] sanctuary,
[1:03:11] strengthen thee out of Zion.
[1:03:14] God sent his word to heal. God sends his
[1:03:18] word to meet needs.
[1:03:21] You know, the word does cannot do
[1:03:23] anything for you unless you believe it.
[1:03:29] We've got to believe that there's help
[1:03:30] in the sanctuary of the Lord.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; And we need to be content with our
[1:03:36] trials. This is a very hard one,
[1:03:40] but we need to be content.
[1:03:43] You know when you you order some food or
[1:03:46] you get your favorite meal cooked and
[1:03:48] you're sitting down and you're eating it
[1:03:50] and it's just perfectly done.
[1:03:54] You're content.
[1:03:56] You say, "Yeah, I bought the right
[1:03:58] doughnut this time."
[1:04:01] I mean, you're really content because
[1:04:03] we've all bought doughnuts before and
[1:04:05] you took a bite and you thought, "I
[1:04:07] didn't ask for yesterday's donut, right?
[1:04:10] You know what I'm talking about. You
[1:04:11] want a fresh one, right? want to taste
[1:04:13] good.
[1:04:17] That feeling of contentment, so
[1:04:21] peaceful, so it's everything's okay.
[1:04:25] That is how we need to be in our trials.
[1:04:29] Now, only God can give that to you, that
[1:04:32] peace.
[1:04:33] But we can learn to be content
[1:04:37] because that is not a gift.
[1:04:40] It is not a gift. The problem is that we
[1:04:43] haven't learned to stand still long
[1:04:44] enough to know that he is God in our
[1:04:47] trial.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; That he
[1:04:54] Jehovah Gyra, the one that saved you, is
[1:04:57] in our situation. He's the answer to our
[1:04:59] problem. He's the peace in the storm.
[1:05:01] He's the way maker through our trial.
[1:05:05] You know, Brother Brandham said it like
[1:05:06] this. People have a hard time. God's
[1:05:08] people have a hard time seeing God
[1:05:10] what's happening right now. They're
[1:05:12] always thanking God for what he did or
[1:05:14] looking to the future, what he's going
[1:05:16] to do, and they're missing God right now
[1:05:17] in their life. This is the most
[1:05:19] important time to see God.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; He when he made it known when he he's
[1:05:24] talking to Moses, MO MOSES SAYS, "WHO DO
[1:05:27] I TELL that's that's that set me? TELL
[1:05:30] THEM THAT I AM THAT I AM NOT I was not I
[1:05:34] was the God that that created the world
[1:05:36] or I'm the God that's going to take you
[1:05:37] in a the bride in a rapture in the
[1:05:40] seventh age. Tell them that I am what I
[1:05:42] am. God is a present help in a time of
[1:05:44] need.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; And when these things drop down into our
[1:05:49] heart, we can trust God. Then we can
[1:05:52] really believe that we can do all things
[1:05:53] through Christ. Paul said,"I have
[1:05:56] learned in whatsoever state I'm in
[1:05:58] therewith to be content."
[1:06:01] And it's something that we all have to
[1:06:03] learn.
[1:06:05] We all have to learn to be content. We
[1:06:08] all have to learn to be still and and
[1:06:10] know that God is God.
[1:06:14] So, I'll just say it like this. Let's
[1:06:16] get to learning it.
[1:06:19] Let's get to learning it. Let's, you
[1:06:20] know, let's make a commitment. I'm going
[1:06:22] to learn to trust God. The way that you
[1:06:25] get content is trust him. Right?
[1:06:29] If you're in a fire and the you're
[1:06:31] starting to see fire or you're in a car
[1:06:33] and you're start or you're in a house
[1:06:35] and the house is engulfed, you're not
[1:06:38] going to stay in the house. You do not
[1:06:40] trust that the fire department is going
[1:06:43] to get there in time. You're going to
[1:06:45] get out of the house
[1:06:48] because it's burning.
[1:06:53] There's no contentment there. There's no
[1:06:55] peace there.
[1:06:58] Those three Hebrew children when they
[1:06:59] walked in that furnace,
[1:07:02] their mind was made up what direction
[1:07:04] they were going.
[1:07:06] They weren't going to give in to the
[1:07:08] devil. And God met them there because
[1:07:11] they trusted in God.
[1:07:14] Now, God supplies our needs. God's grace
[1:07:17] was sufficient for me in my situation.
[1:07:21] Therefore, I will rest in his grace. I
[1:07:24] will have peace in his grace. I will
[1:07:26] have contentment in his grace. I I all
[1:07:29] because of his grace. I
[1:07:33] can overcome.
[1:07:38] Learning to be content.
[1:07:40] I'll just say it like this. It takes
[1:07:41] character.
[1:07:44] Character is not given to us.
[1:07:47] Character is overcoming.
[1:07:50] It's a victory. It's saying I have
[1:07:53] overcome in my mind and my life. I can
[1:07:55] look back. This is what my problem is
[1:07:58] today. I don't have it. That's
[1:08:00] character.
[1:08:04] Character is not saying you fix my
[1:08:06] problem.
[1:08:10] Every man has to overcome. Jesus looked
[1:08:14] at the church in the Leodysia and he
[1:08:16] said, "To him that overcomemeth, why
[1:08:18] grant to sit with me on my throne as I
[1:08:21] have sat with my father on his throne."
[1:08:25] God does not give that to anybody.
[1:08:30] He He brought the children of Israel out
[1:08:32] of Egypt. That was grace. But now he
[1:08:36] said, "Now you overcome and take the
[1:08:38] land.
[1:08:39] You get the character to overcome your
[1:08:41] trials and get there because I am not
[1:08:44] giving you that. That you're going to
[1:08:47] have to overcome yourself."
[1:08:53] So remember, whatever's going on in your
[1:08:55] life, guarantee
[1:08:58] guaranteed God wants you to trust in
[1:08:59] him.
[1:09:01] So, the quicker we can learn to be
[1:09:02] content in our situation, the greater
[1:09:04] we're going to have the victory. All
[1:09:05] right. Philippians chapter 2:12. We need
[1:09:07] to hurry because you know how it is.
[1:09:09] I've only just begun. And we got so much
[1:09:12] to go through. [laughter]
[1:09:14] Philippians chapter 2:12. Wherefore, my
[1:09:16] beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not
[1:09:21] in my presence only,
[1:09:24] not just at church,
[1:09:26] but now much more in my absence. away
[1:09:30] from you. Work out your own salvation
[1:09:34] with fear and trembling. Don't lose the
[1:09:38] fear of God.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Don't lose I could be wrong.
[1:09:43] Don't Don't get I you know I got it. I
[1:09:47] got this. No problem. I got I don't need
[1:09:49] you.
[1:09:51] For it is God which works in you both to
[1:09:57] will and to do of his good pleasure. So
[1:09:59] why did Paul have a thorn in his flesh?
[1:10:04] The Bible tells us because of the
[1:10:06] abundance of revelation.
[1:10:09] So he wouldn't get lifted up.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; So whatever trials going on in your
[1:10:14] life, understand that God knows what
[1:10:16] he's doing to build character in your
[1:10:18] life.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; For it is God which workketh in you both
[1:10:22] to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[1:10:25] It's not our good pleasure. Our good
[1:10:27] pleasure is to be, you know, sitting on
[1:10:29] a a lazy boy,
[1:10:32] taking it easy, sipping lemonade, taking
[1:10:36] in the sun, listening to our jam.
[1:10:43] So do all things without murmuring and
[1:10:46] comput and disputing. So what's he
[1:10:47] saying here in verse 14? Be content. Be
[1:10:50] content.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Don't murmur about the things that are
[1:10:54] happening in the church.
[1:10:57] Don't murmur about the things that are
[1:10:59] happening in the home. Don't murmur
[1:11:01] about the things that are happening in
[1:11:03] your personal life.
[1:11:06] You're not going to get God on the
[1:11:07] scene.
[1:11:09] You're not going to, you know, you're
[1:11:10] not going to manipulate God to do
[1:11:12] something for you with your murmuring
[1:11:13] and complaining. You know, we could do
[1:11:14] that with others. You just, you ever
[1:11:18] have somebody just complain COMPLAIN
[1:11:20] COMPLAIN? YOU'RE LIKE, "YOU BETTER TAKE
[1:11:21] CARE OF THIS.
[1:11:28] You can't do that to God. You can do
[1:11:30] that to other humans, but you can't do
[1:11:32] that to God.
[1:11:35] You know, God allowed the trial in our
[1:11:37] life for a reason. And I believe he he
[1:11:40] has confidence that you can take care of
[1:11:42] it, that you can go through it. Why?
[1:11:46] Because the Bible tells us that God
[1:11:47] would not put anything on us that we
[1:11:49] can't bear. That God is faithful. that
[1:11:52] with this trial, he will make a way for
[1:11:54] you because his grace is sufficient.
[1:11:57] It's all we need. We don't need to to
[1:12:00] understand.
[1:12:02] We need to trust in him. I'll say it
[1:12:05] like this. Paul learned to ride out the
[1:12:08] storm.
[1:12:12] He got whipped. He got shipwrecked. He
[1:12:15] got stoned. But you know what he did?
[1:12:18] Praise you, Lord. You're here. Your
[1:12:20] grace is sufficient. What happened to
[1:12:22] Stephen when they were stoning him? The
[1:12:24] glory of the Lord was ON HIS FACE.
[1:12:26] FATHER, forgive them. They don't know
[1:12:27] what they're doing. God's grace is
[1:12:30] sufficient for our trials. They're
[1:12:31] nothing compared to what others had to
[1:12:33] go through.
[1:12:35] The thing is, we need faith to call on
[1:12:37] God. It's faith that gets a hold of God.
[1:12:41] We don't just have faith for our
[1:12:42] salvation and try to work everything
[1:12:44] else oursel.
[1:12:48] So do all things without murmurings and
[1:12:50] disputings. Why? That you may be
[1:12:52] blameless.
[1:12:56] When you when you complain,
[1:12:59] you're not blameless.
[1:13:02] You may be blameless
[1:13:04] and harmless. When you complain, you're
[1:13:05] not harmless.
[1:13:08] The sons of God without rebuke in the
[1:13:12] midst of a crooked and perverse nation
[1:13:15] among whom you shine as lights in the
[1:13:17] world.
[1:13:19] If you don't murmur and you don't
[1:13:20] complain, I'm going to tell you, you
[1:13:21] stick out like a sore thumb. You shine.
[1:13:24] You shine for Jesus. Hallelujah. The
[1:13:27] Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord
[1:13:30] make his face to shine upon thee and be
[1:13:33] gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his
[1:13:35] countenance upon thee and give thee
[1:13:38] peace. That's what the ministry said to
[1:13:41] the children of Israel.
[1:13:45] You have to receive it.
[1:13:48] You have to receive it.
[1:13:50] They're not just words. It's God's will
[1:13:53] for your life. Verse 16, holding forth
[1:13:56] the word of life. Holding forth the word
[1:13:59] of life. This is God's word. I'm holding
[1:14:01] it. That I may rejoice in the day of
[1:14:03] Christ. That have not run in vain,
[1:14:06] neither labored in vain. Amen. Let's go
[1:14:09] down to uh 1 Peter chapter 4 verse one.
[1:14:12] And
[1:14:14] um if you say amen, I'll go faster.
[1:14:19] That's just it's just normal. It's just
[1:14:21] normal. Those are the rules. You say
[1:14:23] amen, I go faster. You don't say amen,
[1:14:25] then I got to go over it again.
[1:14:27] All right. First Peter chapter 4:1,
[1:14:29] we're still talking about trusting God
[1:14:33] in our trials here. For as much then as
[1:14:35] Christ have suffered for us in the
[1:14:38] flesh, Peter says, "Arm yourself." Put
[1:14:42] the armor on. Put the armor on. Arm
[1:14:45] yourself likewise with the same mind.
[1:14:50] For he that have suffered in the flesh
[1:14:52] have ceased from sin. In other words, if
[1:14:55] you choose, Lord,
[1:14:58] you want me to have this thorn in my
[1:15:00] flesh, if you want me to go through
[1:15:01] this, I'm going to trust you. When you
[1:15:04] trust him, you are ceasing from sin
[1:15:08] because you're trusting in God's grace
[1:15:10] to take you through. I I I can just say
[1:15:13] this. Um I'm 65
[1:15:16] and I remember being a young teeny
[1:15:19] bopper going to high school and playing
[1:15:22] hockey
[1:15:23] and then thinking I was something. You
[1:15:25] know, you all heard one time I was in a
[1:15:28] gong show. Oh man, I was going to live
[1:15:32] it up. But you know, I got gonged
[1:15:35] and the air just went out of my head.
[1:15:38] I remember one time I'm going to play
[1:15:41] tennis for a position on the school
[1:15:42] team. I'm going to show the coach that I
[1:15:44] was better than I could be on the team
[1:15:46] because there's only so many spots.
[1:15:47] Well, you know, I lost.
[1:15:54] And God had to bring me to a place to
[1:15:57] realize
[1:15:59] that I can't make it without him.
[1:16:05] So, I began to serve the Lord after I
[1:16:07] got saved.
[1:16:09] And anybody that knows me knows I was as
[1:16:13] about as quiet as a mouse.
[1:16:20] And all of a sudden, we're having kids.
[1:16:22] I don't know about raising kids. I
[1:16:24] didn't have a mom and dad together.
[1:16:27] And all of a sudden, they're sick and
[1:16:28] they're throwing up and they're they got
[1:16:30] cuts. I got to take him to emergency and
[1:16:32] you know what it is to have a family and
[1:16:34] you don't you don't even know what to do
[1:16:36] because you weren't taught this.
[1:16:40] And then the Lord said, "Oh, you're
[1:16:41] going to have a business over there." I
[1:16:43] never wanted a business. Never. And
[1:16:46] you're going to have one. Don't even
[1:16:47] know how to do it.
[1:16:50] Oh, you're going to start You're going
[1:16:52] to start ministering. I don't even like
[1:16:54] speaking in front of people.
[1:16:57] scared out of my wits for months.
[1:17:01] Still never like coming behind the
[1:17:03] pulpit.
[1:17:07] But I'm going to tell you, and through
[1:17:08] my all my years, I'm standing here today
[1:17:10] and I got one thing with me that I've
[1:17:12] had from the beginning. I wouldn't trade
[1:17:14] it for anything. I will trust the Lord
[1:17:16] for every situation
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; because that's what it's going to take
[1:17:20] me through.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; I don't need to know about the end. I
[1:17:24] don't need to know what's going to
[1:17:25] happen. All I need to do is trust him.
[1:17:27] And he he he places the light in front
[1:17:30] of you for one step at a time. You do
[1:17:33] what he says, you put lights in the next
[1:17:35] one, and then you keep going. It's a
[1:17:37] walk of faith.
[1:17:39] Thy word is a lamp to our feet and a
[1:17:42] light to our path.
[1:17:46] When you learn to trust God's
[1:17:49] for everything
[1:17:51] is when things turn out better.
[1:17:57] All right. Verse two. That he no longer
[1:18:00] should live the rest of his life in the
[1:18:02] time of flesh and the lust of men. Think
[1:18:04] about this. That you should no longer
[1:18:07] live the rest of your time in the flesh
[1:18:12] to what? To the lust of other men,
[1:18:15] but to the will of God. That's what God
[1:18:18] has called us to do. For the time passed
[1:18:22] of our life may suffice us to have
[1:18:25] wrought the will of the Gentiles when he
[1:18:27] walked in the lascivious, lust,
[1:18:29] excessive wine, revelings, banquetings,
[1:18:31] you know, all the things that are in the
[1:18:32] world. And think about this, the people
[1:18:35] that in the world wherein they think
[1:18:37] it's a strange thing that you don't run
[1:18:41] with them to do the same excess of riot,
[1:18:44] they speak evil of you when you stand
[1:18:46] for God.
[1:18:52] They say, "Hey, come on. Let's go do
[1:18:54] this.
[1:18:56] They think it's strange that you don't
[1:18:57] want to do it.
[1:19:01] They'll even speak evil of you."
[1:19:04] Hey, that's part of the persecution.
[1:19:06] They that live godly in Christ Jesus
[1:19:08] shall suffer persecution.
[1:19:10] Who shall give an account to him that is
[1:19:13] ready to judge the quick and the dead?
[1:19:14] All right, let's drop down to verse 12.
[1:19:17] Oh, there's so much I you just Well, we
[1:19:21] can make copies and hand copies out to
[1:19:22] everybody. You just go home and, you
[1:19:24] know, finish this on on your time. 1
[1:19:27] Peter 4:12 says, "Beloved, think it not
[1:19:29] strange concerning the fiery trial,
[1:19:34] which is to try you as though some
[1:19:36] strange thing has happened to you." Now,
[1:19:39] I'm pretty sure we all can say
[1:19:42] we're not in that trial now. We can say
[1:19:46] that we were either just in that trial.
[1:19:50] I'm sure sometime in the past we were in
[1:19:53] this trial
[1:19:56] and it was a fiery trial
[1:19:58] and we thought, why in the world do I
[1:20:01] have to go through this?
[1:20:04] And so Peter's saying, 'D don't think
[1:20:06] it's strange concerning the fiery trial
[1:20:08] that's which is to try you as though
[1:20:10] some strange thing happened unto you.
[1:20:14] It's not a strange thing. God
[1:20:16] orchestrated this. He knew it was going
[1:20:18] to happen years ago
[1:20:21] and he knew the time it was going to
[1:20:23] happen
[1:20:26] and he's going to supply the grace to go
[1:20:28] through it.
[1:20:32] You got to trust in his grace.
[1:20:35] You have to learn to be content.
[1:20:38] You have to learn and trust God that you
[1:20:41] can do all things through Christ now
[1:20:42] because he strengthened you for this
[1:20:44] trial.
[1:20:46] So verse 13 says, "But rejoice in as
[1:20:49] much as you are partakers of Christ's
[1:20:51] suffering that ye that when his glory
[1:20:53] shall be revealed, you may be glad also
[1:20:56] with exceeding joy." Now you know what?
[1:20:59] If when God finally, this is the truth.
[1:21:02] You know when you've gone through a
[1:21:03] trial and you murmured and you complain
[1:21:08] and you doubted
[1:21:12] and the trial subsides
[1:21:17] and you're happy about that it's that
[1:21:19] it's
[1:21:20] over
[1:21:22] but you know you failed because you
[1:21:24] didn't trust him.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; And you know what that means, right?
[1:21:31] That means another trial is coming. It
[1:21:32] may not be the exact same one because
[1:21:35] God uses all different trials
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; to build our character.
[1:21:40] But God wants us to be glad with
[1:21:42] exceeding joy. Remember the Lord bless
[1:21:45] you and keep you, make his face to shine
[1:21:47] upon you and be gracious unto you.
[1:21:51] Remember God has blessed you with grace.
[1:21:55] Just believe for it. Verse 14.
[1:22:00] If you be reprobate, no, I'm sorry. If
[1:22:02] you be reproached for the name of
[1:22:04] Christ,
[1:22:05] happy are you. For the spirit of glory
[1:22:07] and God resteth upon you. On their part,
[1:22:10] he is evil spoken of, but on your part,
[1:22:12] he is glorified. But let none of you
[1:22:15] suffer
[1:22:17] for doing the wrong thing. Let me just
[1:22:19] say it like that. A murderer, a thief,
[1:22:21] an evildoer, a busy body, another, it
[1:22:23] just doesn't matter. Don't suffer
[1:22:27] from doing the wrong thing.
[1:22:30] Yet if any man suffer as a Christian,
[1:22:34] let him not be ashamed,
[1:22:36] but let him glorify God in this behalf.
[1:22:40] For the time is for the time is come
[1:22:43] that judgment must begin at the house of
[1:22:45] God. And if it first begin with us, what
[1:22:47] shall the end of them that obey not the
[1:22:49] gospel of God?
[1:22:51] And if the righteous scarcely be saved,
[1:22:53] where shall the ungodly and the sinner
[1:22:55] appear?
[1:22:57] Wherefore let him that suffer according
[1:22:58] to the will of God commit the keeping of
[1:23:01] their innermost part of them, their
[1:23:04] soul, to him in welloing as unto a
[1:23:08] faithful creator. God is a faithful
[1:23:11] creator. He's not only he didn't only
[1:23:13] create our salvation,
[1:23:16] but he keeps us.
[1:23:18] He just doesn't give us grace to be
[1:23:20] saved. He gives us grace now to walk
[1:23:22] with him in life. Oh, what what a
[1:23:25] wonderful thing it is to walk with God.
[1:23:29] God has blessed us. He is keeping us,
[1:23:33] right? The Lord bless thee and keep
[1:23:36] thee. The Lord is keeping us in the
[1:23:38] middle of our trial. God is with us.
[1:23:41] Don't doubt it. Don't question it.
[1:23:45] The Lord will be gracious to you. All
[1:23:47] right. First, I quoted this. I'll just
[1:23:49] read it. First Corinthians 10:13. There
[1:23:52] have no temptation taken you. But what s
[1:23:54] is as common to man.
[1:23:57] But God is faithful. He will not suffer
[1:24:00] you to go through anything above that
[1:24:03] you're able.
[1:24:04] But will with the temptation, he will
[1:24:07] also make a way of escape that you may
[1:24:09] be out of bed. Now notice the way of
[1:24:12] escape
[1:24:14] is his grace.
[1:24:18] He gives you grace to bear it. He
[1:24:19] doesn't take it away always.
[1:24:22] I mean, I I would not want to go through
[1:24:24] life without God.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; I would not want to go through trials
[1:24:29] without God.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; I would be blaming everybody.
[1:24:35] I would be I would not be the same John
[1:24:37] Martin right now. I would be so mean.
[1:24:42] [laughter]
[1:24:43] I would not be the same person. We
[1:24:45] would, none of us would be the same
[1:24:46] person. Christ comes in and his grace
[1:24:49] changes our nature.
[1:24:56] Praise God.
[1:24:58] Verse 19. I want to read Philippians 4:1
[1:25:01] 19. We never got to this. I wanted to
[1:25:03] read it. I don't know how far we're
[1:25:05] going to get.
[1:25:06] But my God shall supply all your need
[1:25:11] according to his riches and glory by
[1:25:13] Christ Jesus. So, what is your what is
[1:25:16] your what does your trial need? What
[1:25:18] does your situation need right now?
[1:25:22] Now, remember, we can't be saying things
[1:25:24] like, I want God to take this away.
[1:25:28] No, but what does it need?
[1:25:34] We we need to trust in his grace
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; because the only way God is going to
[1:25:42] supply all your need
[1:25:44] is by trusting him.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; If you don't trust him, how can you
[1:25:49] expect God to bless you?
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "My God, my God." He made it
[1:25:56] wasn't the God of the Bible.
[1:25:59] It wasn't the It wasn't Paul's God.
[1:26:04] or Moses is God or Peter's go.
[1:26:09] Paul said to the Philippian church, "My
[1:26:11] God shall supply all your need."
[1:26:16] It's the God that you trust in.
[1:26:21] We know God is God. You you you remember
[1:26:25] when uh Judas was asking Jesus not a
[1:26:28] scariot, how is it that you will reveal
[1:26:31] our yourself to us but not to the world?
[1:26:34] Remember when he asked that question?
[1:26:37] How is it that some Christians seem
[1:26:39] their needs seem to they just seem to be
[1:26:42] blessed and their their needs are being
[1:26:44] met and others there's just a a
[1:26:46] struggle.
[1:26:51] Now I this is not a blanket statement
[1:26:54] for everybody but you understand
[1:26:58] because it's not a blanket statement for
[1:27:01] for everybody. Look what Job went
[1:27:03] through there. You know he he didn't do
[1:27:05] nothing wrong. He was a perfect in the
[1:27:06] sight of God. But yet he went through
[1:27:08] the trial. But I'm just saying how do
[1:27:11] you ex without faith it's impossible to
[1:27:13] please God. So we have to trust God in
[1:27:17] our trial if we want to get the upper
[1:27:19] hand.
[1:27:21] If we want to get the advantage of what
[1:27:24] we're going to get, if we want to get
[1:27:26] more peace, more grace, more
[1:27:29] contentment, then we got to trust him
[1:27:31] more. The key is trusting God.
[1:27:39] Paul had a revelation that God's grace
[1:27:41] was sufficient to meet all his needs.
[1:27:44] That God's grace was enough for him. We
[1:27:47] don't have to search it. And I'm telling
[1:27:49] you, we all have that today. We all have
[1:27:52] God's grace today. We don't need
[1:27:55] anything else. We just need to look to
[1:27:57] him more.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; God didn't put anything on us that we
[1:28:01] need God's grace and something else,
[1:28:03] right? We just need God's grace and
[1:28:05] grace alone.
[1:28:08] So I say to you, church, the Lord bless
[1:28:10] you. The Lord keep you. The Lord make
[1:28:13] his countenance to shine upon you and be
[1:28:16] gracious to you.
[1:28:19] God give us peace.
[1:28:22] All right. Do we got time for just it's
[1:28:25] a little blessing? I want to encourage
[1:28:27] you. Okay. All right.
[1:28:30] It's it's about how powerful God's grace
[1:28:32] is. Luke 22:31.
[1:28:36] And this is where um Jesus is talking to
[1:28:40] Peter
[1:28:42] and he just pretty much tells them
[1:28:45] what's happening in the spiritual realm
[1:28:47] when he's going through he's going to be
[1:28:48] going through a trial. And the Lord said
[1:28:50] unto Peter, he said,"Simon, Simon,
[1:28:54] behold, Satan has desired
[1:28:58] to have you
[1:29:00] and to sift you like wheat." I wanted to
[1:29:02] bring a sifter with me on this one. A
[1:29:04] little visual. You've seen those sifters
[1:29:07] that sift out the flour.
[1:29:10] So, here it is.
[1:29:12] Jesus is telling Peter, "This is what
[1:29:14] Satan wants to do to you spiritually."
[1:29:17] Spiritually now,
[1:29:19] but I have prayed for you,
[1:29:22] that your faith fail not.
[1:29:26] And when you aren't converted, then you
[1:29:29] got a job to do. Strengthen your
[1:29:31] brothers.
[1:29:33] And he said unto him,"Lord, I don't know
[1:29:36] what you got going in your mind right
[1:29:38] now, but according to my understanding,
[1:29:40] I am ready to go with thee both into
[1:29:42] prison and to death.
[1:29:45] My mind is made up."
[1:29:48] And he said, 'I tell you, Peter, the
[1:29:52] shall not crow this day, the same
[1:29:56] day that we're speaking
[1:29:58] before thou shalt deny that shall that
[1:30:01] that thou shalt three times deny me that
[1:30:04] you even know me.
[1:30:07] Wow,
[1:30:09] that would not been a good sermon to
[1:30:12] listen to be at.
[1:30:15] But Jesus spoke the truth. See, a lot of
[1:30:18] times our feelings and our emotions, we
[1:30:20] feel like we're sold out to God. Right?
[1:30:26] Hours later, you know what Jesus asked?
[1:30:30] Told Peter? Can't you pray with me one
[1:30:32] hour? You said you're ready to go to
[1:30:34] prison and death for me. I can't even
[1:30:35] get you to pray for one hour.
[1:30:38] What is going on?
[1:30:42] Mark chapter 14 verse 66. And Peter
[1:30:46] was beneath the palace. And there come
[1:30:49] one of the maids of the high priest. And
[1:30:51] when she saw Peter warming himself by
[1:30:55] the fire, she took she looked upon him
[1:30:57] and said, "Art thou also
[1:31:01] uh and thou also was with Jesus of
[1:31:04] Nazareth?" But he denied, saying, I know
[1:31:07] not. Neither understand. I don't even
[1:31:09] know what you're TALKING ABOUT.
[1:31:12] I DON'T I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THAT. I
[1:31:14] DON'T EVEN KNOW JESUS.
[1:31:17] And he went out into the porch and the
[1:31:20] crew.
[1:31:23] And a maid saw him again and began to
[1:31:26] say to them that stood by, "This is one
[1:31:29] of them."
[1:31:31] And he denied it again.
[1:31:34] And a little later after that, there
[1:31:36] stood by uh they that stood by again to
[1:31:39] Peter, surely thou art one of them, for
[1:31:42] thou art Galilean, and thy speech
[1:31:45] agreeth thereto.
[1:31:47] But he began to curse
[1:31:51] and to swear,
[1:31:53] saying, I know not this man of whom ye
[1:31:57] speak.
[1:31:59] And the second time and and the second
[1:32:02] time the crew
[1:32:05] Peter called to his mind, it came to his
[1:32:09] mind the word that Jesus said unto him
[1:32:12] before the crow twice, thou shalt
[1:32:15] deny me three times. And when he thought
[1:32:19] thereupon,
[1:32:21] he wept.
[1:32:25] This is how important it is to believe
[1:32:28] the word of God over how we feel about
[1:32:30] the word of God. The word of God is
[1:32:33] always right.
[1:32:35] But I want to say this.
[1:32:37] Do you notice Jesus prayed for Peter
[1:32:40] that his faith failed not?
[1:32:43] Peter fell, but he got back up. You
[1:32:45] notice he didn't stay down for 20 years.
[1:32:49] He got back up. He went in to the upper
[1:32:52] room and he got the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:59] And that's what we need to do is get the
[1:33:00] Holy Ghost.
[1:33:04] But I'll say it like this. Do you know
[1:33:07] Jesus prayed for you too
[1:33:09] in St. John chapter 17? He prayed for
[1:33:12] everybody sitting here.
[1:33:15] And I believe with all my heart if you
[1:33:17] can receive it,
[1:33:19] he prayed that your faith wouldn't fail,
[1:33:24] that we would be one. And I'll tell you,
[1:33:26] when Peter went and got the Holy Ghost,
[1:33:27] he became, that was the beginning of his
[1:33:30] nature change.
[1:33:32] That was the beginning of his nature
[1:33:34] change. Not when he was casting out
[1:33:37] devils, not when he was using the name
[1:33:39] of Jesus, because that all happened
[1:33:42] before he got the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:45] The Holy Ghost is what gives us a nature
[1:33:47] change. It actually changes our nature
[1:33:51] and makes us what we ought to be. Let's
[1:33:53] stand together. The Lord bless you and
[1:33:55] keep you. The Lord make his face to
[1:33:57] shine upon you and be gracious unto
[1:33:59] thee. The Lord lift up his countenance
[1:34:01] and give thee peace.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, encouraging the Hebrew church, he
[1:34:11] said, "Let us therefore come boldly unto
[1:34:13] the throne of grace." Amen.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; That we may obtain mercy and find grace
[1:34:17] to help in a time of need.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing Marvelous Grace.
[1:34:33] Marvelous
[1:34:35] grace of our loving
[1:34:39] Lord.
[1:34:41] grace that exceeds
[1:34:44] our sin and our guilt.
[1:34:48] Y on Calary's
[1:34:51] mount outpour
[1:34:55] there where the blood of the lamb was
[1:35:00] spilled.
[1:35:02] Grace, grace,
[1:35:06] God's
[1:35:07] grace.
[1:35:09] Grace that will pardon and cleanse
[1:35:14] within.
[1:35:16] Grace.
[1:35:18] Grace.
[1:35:20] God's
[1:35:21] grace.
[1:35:23] Grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1:35:30] Thin and despair like the sea waves cold
[1:35:37] threatening the soul with infinite loss.
[1:35:44] Praise that is greater. Yes, grace
[1:35:48] untold
[1:35:50] points to the refuge the mighty
[1:35:55] cross.
[1:35:57] Praise.
[1:35:59] grace.
[1:36:00] God's
[1:36:02] grace.
[1:36:04] Grace that will pardon and cleanse
[1:36:09] within.
[1:36:11] Grace,
[1:36:12] grace,
[1:36:14] God's
[1:36:16] grace,
[1:36:17] grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1:36:24] Dark is the stain that we cannot
[1:36:29] hide.
[1:36:31] What can a veil to wash it away?
[1:36:37] Look, there is flowing a crimson
[1:36:42] tide.
[1:36:44] Wider than snow you may be today.
[1:36:50] Praise.
[1:36:52] Grace.
[1:36:54] God's
[1:36:55] grace.
[1:36:57] Grace that will pardon and cleanse
[1:37:01] within
[1:37:03] grace.
[1:37:05] Grace.
[1:37:07] God's
[1:37:08] grace.
[1:37:10] Grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1:37:17] marvelous,
[1:37:19] infinite, matchless
[1:37:21] grace
[1:37:23] freely bestowed
[1:37:26] on all who believe.
[1:37:30] You who are longing to see his face.
[1:37:36] Will you this moment his grace receive
[1:37:42] grace?
[1:37:44] grace. God's
[1:37:47] grace.
[1:37:49] Grace that will pardon and cleanse
[1:37:53] within
[1:37:55] grace.
[1:37:57] Grace,
[1:37:59] God's grace.
[1:38:02] Grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1:38:11] Amen.
[1:38:13] all our sin.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Boy, that ought to make us that ought to
[1:38:17] make a Methodist shout.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; That'll just make us so happy.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; That God's grace can take care of all of
[1:38:27] our sin.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heart before
[1:38:31] the Lord. And
[1:38:34] maybe there's something on
[1:38:37] your heart that you just want to commit
[1:38:40] to him.
[1:38:42] your heart. You don't need to lift your
[1:38:44] hand, but maybe there's just something
[1:38:46] in your heart. You want to commit to
[1:38:48] him. You want to trust him.
[1:38:52] You just believe in God's grace. As we
[1:38:54] go to him in prayer, heavenly father,
[1:38:56] Lord, we thank you for your marvelous
[1:38:59] grace, your amazing grace. How sweet the
[1:39:03] sound that saved wretches like us, Lord.
[1:39:08] God, you've you've brought us from the
[1:39:12] world to a place with you. Oh, we thank
[1:39:16] you, Lord. We thank you for the grace
[1:39:19] that you've brought in our life. Lord,
[1:39:21] we could all stand and testify of things
[1:39:24] that you have done for us and that we
[1:39:27] all end our testimony with saying it was
[1:39:31] the grace of God.
[1:39:33] Lord,
[1:39:35] what we're desiring, Lord, is to trust
[1:39:38] that grace a little bit more.
[1:39:41] And we're coming to you in prayer, Lord,
[1:39:43] with these these things on our heart and
[1:39:46] our desire to trust you more. I pray
[1:39:48] that, Lord, you would receive our faith
[1:39:51] now as we cast our faith toward you,
[1:39:55] trusting you for the grace that is to
[1:39:57] come. Lord, help us to never murmur.
[1:40:02] Take that away from us. Take the
[1:40:04] complaining.
[1:40:06] Take the fingerpointing.
[1:40:09] Take the blaming. Take the excuses.
[1:40:12] Take everything that is unlike you that
[1:40:15] we may be harmless and blameless, the
[1:40:17] sons and daughters of God.
[1:40:20] Lord, help us to trust in your grace
[1:40:22] more.
[1:40:24] May this word that you have uh spoken
[1:40:27] today, may it find a place in our heart
[1:40:32] that will stay with us forever and
[1:40:34] forever.
[1:40:36] We thank you for this now and we give
[1:40:38] you the praise for it. For we humbly
[1:40:40] pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing Amazing Grace before
[1:40:46] we're dismissed. Amen.
[1:40:50] Amazing
[1:40:53] grace, how sweet the sound that saved a
[1:41:01] wretch like me.
[1:41:06] I once was lost, but now I'm found. Was
[1:41:14] blind, but now I see.
[1:41:20] It was grace [music] that taught my
[1:41:25] heart to fear and grace my fears
[1:41:32] relive.
[1:41:35] How preious
[1:41:37] did that grace
[1:41:41] appear
[1:41:42] the
