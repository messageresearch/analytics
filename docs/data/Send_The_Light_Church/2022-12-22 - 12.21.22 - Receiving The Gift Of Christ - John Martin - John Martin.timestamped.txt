[34:33] loves and think that she's just been
[34:35] going through such a hard trial long

[34:42] sister in in prayer and our brother

[37:23] we commit them into the god that we
[37:25] surrendered our heart in life to now ask
[37:28] all these things in Jesus Christ's
[37:30] precious name amen amen Saint Luke
[37:34] Chapter 2 we're going to start with
[37:36] verse number seven and Mary and Joseph
[37:40] went to Nazareth to be taxed while they
[37:43] were there Mary gave birth to Jesus and
[37:47] she brought forth her firstborn son and
[37:50] wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[37:52] laid him in a Manger because there was
[37:54] no room for them in the end
[37:58] and there we're in the same country
[38:00] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[38:03] watch over their flock by night and lo
[38:06] the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and
[38:09] the glory of the Lord Shone about them
[38:12] and they were sore afraid and the angels
[38:15] said unto them fear not for behold I
[38:18] bring you good tidings of great joy
[38:22] which shall be to all people
[38:25] For unto you
[38:27] is Born This Day in the city of David a
[38:31] savior which is Christ the lord and this
[38:34] shall be a sign unto you you shall find
[38:37] the babe
[38:38] a wrapped in swallowing clothes
[38:41] lying in a manger and suddenly
[38:44] there was with the angel a multitude of
[38:47] heavenly holes praising God and saying
[38:50] glory to God in the highest and on Earth
[38:53] peace in Good Will
[38:55] toward men and came to pass as the
[38:58] Angels were gone away from them into
[39:02] heaven the shepherd said one to another
[39:04] let us go
[39:05] uh go even unto Bethlehem and see this
[39:10] thing which is come to pass which the
[39:12] Lord have made known unto us and they
[39:14] came with haste and found Mary and
[39:16] Joseph and the Babe Lane and the major
[39:18] and when they had seen him they had made
[39:21] known abroad saying which was told them
[39:25] concerning this child
[39:27] and all they that heard it wandered at
[39:32] those things which were told them by the
[39:36] Shepherds amen God bless you you may be
[39:40] seated
[39:41] amen
[39:44] in Matthew chapter 1 verses 22 and 23 I
[39:48] want to read this Matthew chapter 1
[39:50] verse 22 and 23 now all this was done
[39:55] that it might be fulfilled which was
[40:00] spoken by the lord of the Lord by the
[40:03] prophets saying Behold a virgin shall be
[40:05] with child and shall bring forth a son
[40:07] and they shall call his name a manual
[40:09] which is being interpreted is God With
[40:14] Us
[40:15] so I think that kind of sums up a little
[40:17] bit I should say of the reading that we
[40:20] had here this is uh obviously about the
[40:24] the birth of of of Jesus Christ but yet
[40:28] it was the gift of God given to mankind
[40:32] like to entitle this message receiving
[40:34] the gift of Christ
[40:38] this great event was Christ to the
[40:40] masses and if I could say that's where
[40:42] they got that word Christmas is Christ
[40:45] to the mass it was peace and Good Will
[40:48] toward men the Bible says it was good
[40:51] tidings of great joy to all people it
[40:55] was the birth of a savior which was
[40:57] Christ the lord
[41:00] and uh the thing I've
[41:03] thought often thought about is that
[41:06] Christ is viewed
[41:10] more as a Christmas present than as a
[41:14] relationship
[41:16] in the world and sometimes those
[41:21] that way of looking uh at Christ can
[41:25] come the same way
[41:28] uh Even in our walk with the Lord
[41:31] now the Angels did not say one thing
[41:35] about the requirement of salvation
[41:38] right they just shared the good news of
[41:41] God's Gift uh had come
[41:45] and even though the Shepherds didn't
[41:46] understand the requirements of Salvation
[41:49] at this point they were telling everyone
[41:51] about the good news of the Savior was
[41:55] born and that the Savior was the Lord
[41:57] Jesus Christ and the Bible says all they
[42:00] that heard it wandered at those things
[42:02] which were told them by the Shepherds so
[42:05] they were still sharing the good news
[42:07] that that Christ he is the savior he he
[42:10] is the uh Jesus Christ as Lord
[42:15] the Bible says in Acts 4 verse 12
[42:18] neither is there salvation in any other
[42:21] for there is none other name under
[42:23] Heaven given among men whereby we must
[42:26] be saved there is no other way to to
[42:30] receive eternal life than through Jesus
[42:32] Christ
[42:35] like the angels and like the Shepherds
[42:37] when we're sharing Christ
[42:40] with others
[42:42] we want to share the good news
[42:45] and after someone has received the good
[42:48] news then we've got to give them the
[42:51] other part of the good news which is the
[42:53] requirements but it's not looked at so
[42:55] much as good news
[42:57] but it's still the whole Bible is good
[43:00] news
[43:01] and that's what Paul and all the
[43:03] apostles did and and that's what really
[43:06] brought all the persecution is when they
[43:09] began to talk about the requirements if
[43:12] you just if you just talked about God
[43:14] you know gave himself for the whole
[43:16] world and he's our savior and and uh you
[43:20] know you can make it and well there's no
[43:22] persecution in that
[43:24] sharing the good news brings Good
[43:26] Tidings of great joy but sharing the
[43:28] requirements that's what brings the
[43:30] persecution
[43:33] and that's why there's some churches
[43:35] that stay away from the requirements
[43:39] and just share the other part and that
[43:41] makes you feel good
[43:43] unfortunately there's too many people
[43:45] sharing Christ as a Christmas present
[43:48] right
[43:50] usually when we get a Christmas present
[43:52] there's no strings attached
[43:54] it's just a gift
[43:56] you don't know anything you don't got to
[43:58] do nothing you don't like it put it in
[44:00] the closet you like it wear it share it
[44:03] it's yours to do what you want but
[44:05] that's not the way credit is with Christ
[44:09] but they
[44:11] they share Christ
[44:13] in part
[44:15] they share God died for your sins
[44:19] that you couldn't do anything to save
[44:20] yourself that without him you're lost he
[44:23] paid the penalty for the sins of the
[44:25] whole world and these are all true
[44:28] statements they're all accurate but they
[44:31] stop there many of them stop there
[44:38] they're all good tidings of great joy
[44:42] but if we stop there and we don't share
[44:44] the requirements
[44:46] the gift of Christ will be portrayed
[44:49] as a Christmas present
[44:53] God died for us at Calvary
[44:55] a Christmas present here it is just just
[44:58] receive it it's much lighter than a
[45:02] relationship
[45:03] then God has requirements for us
[45:09] the very gift of God spoke out about the
[45:12] necessary requirements when he said
[45:13] unless you forsake mother and father
[45:16] sister brother husband wife you can't
[45:19] follow me
[45:20] unless you deny your own will you can't
[45:23] follow me unless you pick up your cross
[45:25] you can't follow me unless you lose your
[45:28] life you'll not be saved
[45:32] now this is not the way that people View
[45:37] the gift that God had given man
[45:41] they they view so many people view that
[45:45] God gave Jesus Christ to die on the
[45:49] cross for their sins
[45:51] and it was freely given and there was
[45:54] nothing they could do to save themselves
[45:56] and it stops right there
[46:01] and unfortunately you're taking up part
[46:04] of the Gospel
[46:05] and if you take part out that part part
[46:08] will be taken out of the book of life
[46:10] amen
[46:11] so you need to hear what
[46:16] God had to say what Christ had to say it
[46:19] the very gift that came and presented
[46:22] himself told us the requirements
[46:25] the Angels were sharing Good Tidings of
[46:28] great joy to all people imagine that
[46:30] these angels painted another picture
[46:34] about this baby being born
[46:37] saying something like this
[46:40] that this this gift is going to be
[46:44] rejected of men
[46:46] despised oppressed smitten of God and
[46:49] Afflicted it was going to be crucified
[46:52] by the world who wouldn't accept the
[46:54] requirements
[46:57] now that one is seen like such a a great
[47:01] message
[47:02] from the Angels it wouldn't seem like
[47:04] Good Tidings of great joy
[47:09] it would sound like
[47:13] that it wasn't good news
[47:19] but when God gives us his word
[47:24] he expects us
[47:26] to receive the word amen
[47:29] to walk in the light as he gives the
[47:31] light
[47:33] and then we really have fellowship with
[47:35] him
[47:37] when the time had arrived even his own
[47:40] disciples struggled
[47:43] with the news that he would suffer in
[47:45] Matthew chapter 16 verse 21 he says from
[47:48] that time forth beget Jesus to show unto
[47:51] his disciples how he must go to
[47:53] Jerusalem and suffer many things and the
[47:55] Elders of the chief priests and scribes
[47:57] and be killed and raised again the third
[47:59] day
[48:01] and then Peter took him
[48:03] Peter took them
[48:05] I mean I can imagine he just kind of
[48:07] grabbed him by the collar took him
[48:11] shoved him up against hey I got to get a
[48:13] hold of your attention you're not
[48:14] speaking the good news
[48:18] be it far from thee Lord this shall not
[48:21] be unto thee
[48:23] this was not the way of good news this
[48:25] is what was not good tidings of great
[48:28] joy
[48:29] this was not the way of a savior this
[48:32] was not peace and Good Will unto all men
[48:34] it left the disciples feeling lost
[48:39] alone
[48:41] troubled
[48:44] and we must understand
[48:47] that there's
[48:49] the whole word of God
[48:51] is what God gave us to live by
[48:56] and we cannot
[48:58] fall under the the the the
[49:02] Smorgasbord of just taking what we want
[49:05] to take of the Bible and saying that I'm
[49:08] bride
[49:09] and and and I'm predestinated
[49:12] we've been predestinated to fulfill the
[49:15] word right we've been predestined to
[49:18] manifest the word we've been we've been
[49:21] we've been we're the elect is the ones
[49:24] that are going to go all the way
[49:27] easy to stand back like all the other
[49:29] churches who don't even know the message
[49:31] and say I have received Christ in my
[49:33] life
[49:35] and are not living the word
[49:40] but Jesus turned and said unto them
[49:42] Peter
[49:43] get thee behind me Satan
[49:46] Thou Art in offense unto me for thou
[49:49] savior is not the things that be of God
[49:50] but the but those that be of men
[49:55] the things that be of God or his acquire
[49:57] his requirements his will
[50:00] the things that be of men are Christmas
[50:02] presents
[50:03] give me without any responsibility
[50:06] give to me without me having to give up
[50:08] anything without having to do anything
[50:13] the good news the word of God and flesh
[50:16] had spoken and was being rejected by his
[50:19] own disciples
[50:21] God was about ready to tear down the
[50:23] middle petition between man and God
[50:28] because of sin and here their own
[50:31] disciples didn't understand that and
[50:33] they were coming against it
[50:37] in John chapter 1 verse 11.
[50:41] he came unto his own
[50:44] and his own received him not
[50:48] but as many as received him
[50:52] to that person to those people
[50:55] to then gave he power to become sons of
[51:00] God even to them that believe on his
[51:02] name
[51:05] you know a lot of people will take that
[51:07] well I believe and I'm a son of God
[51:11] but they're missing the power
[51:13] they have a form of godliness but
[51:16] they're denying the power thereof
[51:19] when you truly believe you will have
[51:21] power to manifest yourself as God
[51:27] as a Son of God as a daughter of God
[51:31] I'm just trying to get your attention by
[51:33] saying it like that
[51:34] but it isn't okay I've been baptized I
[51:38] got this plaque I'm putting it on the
[51:40] wall I'm a Son of God I'm in the message
[51:41] it's not like that
[51:44] and too many people
[51:46] are falling for that
[51:48] when there should be uh an expectation
[51:52] inside of those who have received him to
[51:55] become him to manifest him the Bible
[51:58] says it does not yet appear what we
[52:00] shall be but we know that when he show
[52:02] up here we shall be like him
[52:04] and the whole earth is groaning and
[52:07] waiting for this manifestation and if
[52:09] we're not seeing that power in our lives
[52:11] we need to get underneath and be calling
[52:13] upon God and say God this is what your
[52:16] word says
[52:17] [Music]
[52:19] that next verse really
[52:23] explains
[52:25] why some people don't have the power
[52:29] which were born not of blood nor of the
[52:34] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[52:38] but of God
[52:41] amen
[52:44] no I'm just going to be honest with you
[52:46] that these children here do not live in
[52:50] my home
[52:51] they're not my sons and daughters
[52:56] and
[52:58] they don't have to do my will
[53:02] because they live in another home they
[53:04] have a different father
[53:09] but if they lived in my home
[53:12] they would do my will
[53:14] is that true Anne
[53:16] there's there's
[53:18] no doubt about that
[53:21] at any age
[53:25] and the thing is if we're born of God we
[53:27] will be doing the will of God Amen
[53:29] that's just all there is to it
[53:32] and the thing is too many people are
[53:34] claiming this Christ it's a Christmas
[53:36] present and they're bypassing whether
[53:39] they even have to follow suit with the
[53:42] with doing what the word says
[53:45] they let the devil trick them and think
[53:47] that this doesn't matter that doesn't
[53:49] matter it's okay if I don't do that and
[53:51] God sees this and we're just all human
[53:53] and it just that list is endlessly
[53:55] before you know it everybody's their own
[53:57] church
[53:58] everybody's their own believer
[54:01] but all yet claiming
[54:03] born again
[54:08] that's why we need to be fruit
[54:09] inspectors we need to make sure that
[54:12] we're following the heart of the message
[54:15] the heart of the Bible from cover to
[54:18] cover I say is the heart of the Bible
[54:20] it's from cover to cover but you know
[54:22] what I'm saying don't
[54:25] it's not about pulling eight scriptures
[54:27] out and saying these are great I believe
[54:29] these
[54:30] it's about pulling out the other million
[54:33] that we're not doing and saying I need
[54:35] to be doing these
[54:36] and that dovetails together right it's
[54:39] got to dovetail together aren't you glad
[54:42] that God gave you and I the opportunity
[54:45] to become a Son of God become a daughter
[54:47] of God where would we be if God did not
[54:49] send somebody our way to tell us about
[54:52] the truth
[54:55] I'm so thankful that we can really
[54:57] believe on him
[54:59] Believe In The Name of Jesus you know
[55:01] many people use that name in vain
[55:05] they they use it for a show they use it
[55:09] for so many reasons
[55:12] but they don't cherish it and and come
[55:15] humbly subject to that name
[55:18] you know someone who wants to receive
[55:20] Christ and have the power to become a
[55:22] son or daughter of God we want to share
[55:25] with them the good news but after they
[55:28] receive the good news we want to share
[55:29] with them the requirements
[55:31] come here because it really is a two-way
[55:35] street it's not a Christmas gift
[55:37] all of us are starting to get gifts
[55:38] probably
[55:40] of some degree we're going to get gifts
[55:43] somewhere around Christmas right I say
[55:46] for the most part we get something
[55:49] nobody's going to ask us do you want
[55:51] this gift if not I'm not going to give
[55:54] it to you unless they open up they say
[55:56] come on you know I already got I I told
[55:59] you I got one of those but what I'm
[56:00] saying is you're going to hand the gift
[56:02] you're going to get receive a gift and
[56:04] that's it
[56:06] and when we read about that
[56:08] word in the Bible the gift of God the
[56:12] gift
[56:13] we think of the gift that same way
[56:22] we
[56:24] not that we can do anything to earn
[56:28] anything
[56:34] but if we
[56:36] we receive Christ today we do everything
[56:39] we can today we plead the blood today we
[56:43] surrender to Christ today
[56:45] I believe we're as just as clean and
[56:47] pure and the sight of God as can be
[56:49] because the blood of Christ makes us
[56:51] that way
[56:53] but if he gives us time to live after
[56:56] that day and we do not continue to walk
[57:00] in the light that he gives us for the
[57:01] next day the next week the next month
[57:04] and we decide that we're just going to
[57:06] kind of begin to do our own will again
[57:10] well I'm sorry friends
[57:13] but as the the way the tree falls that's
[57:15] the way it lies
[57:18] we've got to continue
[57:20] on the course
[57:22] you just got to you're playing with fire
[57:24] and danger and and once saved always
[57:28] save it doesn't matter and God loves me
[57:30] and he's not changing his love for me
[57:31] and it gets into so many things
[57:35] and that's why God set a prophet to
[57:37] straighten that stuff out
[57:40] to make it clear
[57:42] and God has blessed us with the truth
[57:46] to help others
[57:48] who don't have the truth
[57:52] there was a a religious man named
[57:55] Nicodemus
[57:56] the Bible says he came to Jesus by night
[58:01] and this word that was made flesh in
[58:04] Christ Jesus discerned the thoughts and
[58:07] intents of his heart and he said unto
[58:10] him verily I say unto you except a man
[58:12] be born again he could not see the
[58:15] kingdom of God amen well before it was
[58:18] here's good news here's the Savior he's
[58:21] come
[58:22] he went to Calvary we didn't even ask
[58:24] him to
[58:27] now the same Jesus is telling us that we
[58:31] got to become born again
[58:35] it's not a it's not separate
[58:39] it's just part of
[58:42] it's part of the Salvation that he
[58:45] brought to us it's part of the it's part
[58:48] of the good news
[58:50] amen
[58:52] as many as receive the gift of God to
[58:57] them gave he power to become the sons of
[59:01] God you know just getting baptized and
[59:04] just saying I I believe I've confessed
[59:07] with my mouth and I believe doesn't give
[59:09] you salvation doesn't give you power
[59:13] it doesn't
[59:16] you've got to believe with everything
[59:18] that you got
[59:21] the gift is not a Christmas present
[59:24] right this peace and goodwill towards
[59:27] all men is not a Christmas present the
[59:31] gift of God is not a present
[59:37] you know we've had to preach the
[59:39] Christmas message for I don't know how
[59:40] many years now and you can never preach
[59:42] the same way you know anybody that's
[59:44] ever her sister Kathleen's probably one
[59:47] that's heard from the beginning you'll
[59:48] never hear two the same
[59:51] how can you say you believe on his name
[59:54] and you don't want to come to church now
[59:57] I'm not necessary I'm not speaking to
[59:59] anybody here and I may not be speaking
[1:00:01] to anybody in the church it could be
[1:00:02] just simply somebody who's live
[1:00:05] streaming
[1:00:06] that doesn't go to this church but maybe
[1:00:09] you do
[1:00:11] how can you say you believe on his name
[1:00:13] but you don't want to come prepare
[1:00:15] before service
[1:00:19] how can you say you believe on his name
[1:00:21] you don't want to pay tithes
[1:00:23] you don't want to dress right
[1:00:25] you don't want to help the infirmities
[1:00:27] of the weak
[1:00:28] you don't want to help the church how
[1:00:31] can you say you believe on his name
[1:00:35] how can you say you believe on his name
[1:00:38] and gossip and hold grudges and cut your
[1:00:40] hair
[1:00:42] paint your face taught behind people's
[1:00:44] back and say you believe on his name
[1:00:49] calm your savior
[1:00:51] how can you rebel against the word of
[1:00:54] God when you know what you should be
[1:00:56] doing and say you believe on his name
[1:01:00] it's another gospel that you're thinking
[1:01:03] of another spirit
[1:01:07] I'll say it like this the Devils have
[1:01:09] that same belief
[1:01:11] and they tremble
[1:01:13] they believe on the name of Jesus
[1:01:17] the devil's
[1:01:19] they know the authority of that name
[1:01:23] when it's spoken by faith
[1:01:28] they know who the savior of man's soul
[1:01:30] is they know that's why they're doing
[1:01:32] everything they can to try to hinder
[1:01:35] people from believing the right way
[1:01:39] he's getting the majority of them to
[1:01:42] believe in a false way many will come to
[1:01:44] me in that day and say Lord Lord didn't
[1:01:46] I do this that and the other
[1:01:49] I never knew you
[1:01:53] they didn't want to give all
[1:01:56] their heart to God they don't mind if
[1:01:59] God gives all of his heart to them
[1:02:06] help me keep me from my sins help me get
[1:02:08] to heaven provide all my needs down here
[1:02:11] but as far as me giving my heart
[1:02:14] to you
[1:02:16] that's what we struggle with on a daily
[1:02:18] basis and the only way that we can
[1:02:19] succeed on that
[1:02:21] is to Die daily you cannot give your all
[1:02:25] to Christ without dying that day you
[1:02:27] can't
[1:02:28] you either serve one or the other that
[1:02:30] day
[1:02:31] we want to say We believe We want to say
[1:02:35] he's our savior we're quick to say that
[1:02:37] but are we quick to say I'm dead to
[1:02:39] myself and I'm suffering for the cause
[1:02:41] of Christ
[1:02:45] when we receive God he gives the
[1:02:48] believer power to become
[1:02:51] to begin to manifest the word
[1:02:55] to show everybody else that you're
[1:02:59] different than what you used to be by
[1:03:01] this shall all men know you're my
[1:03:03] disciples there is a power when the love
[1:03:06] of God comes in your heart you begin to
[1:03:08] lay down your life for the cause of
[1:03:10] Christ
[1:03:12] amen God's gift to mankind is not a
[1:03:14] Christmas present
[1:03:17] the peace that he has for us
[1:03:21] amen The Good Will unto all men it's not
[1:03:24] a Christmas present the gift is for
[1:03:26] believers now I will say this
[1:03:29] that God's spirit his love and His
[1:03:33] blessings they do fall in the just and
[1:03:36] the unjust because that's just the
[1:03:37] goodness of God
[1:03:39] but when we're talking about a savior
[1:03:41] when we're talking about power to become
[1:03:44] a Son of God well there's some
[1:03:46] interaction that needs to take place
[1:03:48] there's some requirements that comes
[1:03:50] from God and that I'll say it like this
[1:03:53] when he gives us the requirements that's
[1:03:55] light
[1:03:57] that's light that we didn't have and as
[1:03:59] he gives us that light we walk in it and
[1:04:02] as we walk in it he gives you power
[1:04:05] he's looking for one thing from from the
[1:04:08] believer and that's truly his heart's
[1:04:11] desire to please him
[1:04:13] three more agency if you are willing to
[1:04:17] to to love me from your heart I will
[1:04:19] give you what you need to walk this walk
[1:04:21] amen no doubt about it
[1:04:25] we don't got to muster it up we don't
[1:04:27] gotta it's all him but he's looking for
[1:04:30] our heart and he knows our heart
[1:04:34] amen
[1:04:36] how can you truly have peace
[1:04:39] without accepting Christ the word we
[1:04:41] live in a world where peace
[1:04:44] is a necessity
[1:04:46] with all the craziness that's going on
[1:04:48] he is our peace the Bible says
[1:04:51] For unto us a child is born unto us a
[1:04:55] son is given and the government shall be
[1:04:58] upon his shoulders and his name Shall be
[1:04:59] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[1:05:01] God the Everlasting father the Prince of
[1:05:05] Peace
[1:05:06] he is our peace
[1:05:08] how many people long for peace but they
[1:05:12] don't want to do the requirements of
[1:05:14] peace they don't want to keep their
[1:05:16] minds stayed on the lord it's too hard
[1:05:19] to do they don't want to think on these
[1:05:22] things that are of a good report and
[1:05:24] true and and holy and pure and lovely
[1:05:29] and they don't want to do the things
[1:05:31] that Paul said Paul said do the things
[1:05:33] that I've done
[1:05:34] what you've seen me do do and the God of
[1:05:37] Peace will be with you there's
[1:05:39] requirements
[1:05:41] alone
[1:05:42] it's requirements
[1:05:45] to manifest God
[1:05:47] in this hour
[1:05:54] we got to accept the word
[1:05:57] the word is Christ
[1:06:01] and this word needs to become more
[1:06:03] important to us
[1:06:06] than what it is
[1:06:08] in fact as the days go further
[1:06:11] and we get closer this word needs to
[1:06:14] become more precious to us we need to we
[1:06:17] need to open this book and say God I
[1:06:19] need you right now speak to me speak to
[1:06:22] me out of your word now he can take this
[1:06:24] letter which if your heart is not in it
[1:06:28] it's a dead letter
[1:06:31] but you get your heart your your heart
[1:06:34] where it needs to be in your
[1:06:36] relationship with Christ and you say God
[1:06:38] speak to me all sudden this dead letter
[1:06:40] becomes life amen it becomes real it
[1:06:44] becomes life to you
[1:06:48] and if you sincerely accept this word
[1:06:51] into your heart and say God I want to do
[1:06:53] it he will change your nature
[1:06:56] he will begin to you know this
[1:06:58] born-again experience it may start at a
[1:07:00] certain time
[1:07:01] but it can lay dormant for a long time
[1:07:05] it cannot go through there's many people
[1:07:07] who started the race but didn't finish
[1:07:10] and you've got to keep walking in New
[1:07:12] Light the more you're anxious and
[1:07:14] excited about walking in the light
[1:07:16] that's presented to you the more you're
[1:07:18] going to grow in Christ
[1:07:20] second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 16.
[1:07:28] if
[1:07:29] you accept the word
[1:07:34] Christ the word into your life he will
[1:07:36] begin to change your nature if you
[1:07:40] continue to yield to him he will
[1:07:43] continue to change your nature
[1:07:46] and the moment that you stop he stops he
[1:07:51] doesn't keep going
[1:07:52] it doesn't matter if we come and sit in
[1:07:54] church
[1:07:55] I think brother Mark was telling us he
[1:07:57] heard someone say that there's going to
[1:07:59] be a lot of time there's going to be
[1:08:01] tithepayers in hell
[1:08:03] so you can continue doing part of the
[1:08:06] word
[1:08:08] and still not your nature not be
[1:08:11] changing
[1:08:13] so we're interested in seeing change in
[1:08:15] our life that to me is the most exciting
[1:08:17] thing where once I I I wanted to get rid
[1:08:21] of this thing I I didn't want it my life
[1:08:23] but for some reason it just stayed there
[1:08:26] and to see that prayer go before the
[1:08:30] Lord help me with this Lord I really
[1:08:32] know this is not you you don't want this
[1:08:34] and I'm calling upon you and I'm seeking
[1:08:38] you for help that is what really brings
[1:08:41] the Simplicity of a change nature
[1:08:45] verse 16 second Corinthians 5 16
[1:08:47] wherefore
[1:08:49] henceforth know we no man after the
[1:08:52] flesh though we have known Christ after
[1:08:54] the flesh yet now henceforth know we him
[1:08:57] know more
[1:08:59] we don't know Christ anymore from a
[1:09:01] Bible study we don't even know him
[1:09:03] anymore from somebody just telling us
[1:09:05] something about him we know Christ in a
[1:09:08] personal way now
[1:09:10] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[1:09:14] a new creature
[1:09:17] not he knows more about the Bible
[1:09:20] right
[1:09:21] he doesn't know the stories more he
[1:09:24] doesn't know the quotes more
[1:09:27] he he's a new creature
[1:09:30] so something is something is changing
[1:09:33] brother Mark ministered unchanging in
[1:09:37] our in our men's meeting today changing
[1:09:40] old things are passed away
[1:09:43] and behold all things are become new
[1:09:47] and all things are of God
[1:09:52] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:09:56] whoa I thought it was just Good Tidings
[1:09:59] of of of of of of of of of
[1:10:02] joy and peace and a savior's born and
[1:10:06] and that's all there was to it
[1:10:10] no now a man has to give up his whole
[1:10:14] will to do all the will of God
[1:10:17] and it's something that we face on a
[1:10:19] daily basis and if we're just honest
[1:10:21] with yourself and we take time do we do
[1:10:24] we
[1:10:25] do the will of God
[1:10:28] are we doing are we seeking the will of
[1:10:30] God are we just seeking to have God part
[1:10:32] of our life and doing our own will
[1:10:34] because if that is really what's
[1:10:37] happening we're looking at Christ too
[1:10:40] much as a Christmas present
[1:10:42] as a present and not God's life given to
[1:10:47] us
[1:10:50] God became us that we could become him
[1:10:53] and so it's it's it's not God God became
[1:10:57] us so he could give us eternal life
[1:11:00] you know we've got to become him
[1:11:03] when we go to heaven he wants us to be
[1:11:05] just like him
[1:11:09] so the for those of you who are not
[1:11:11] willing to obey the word of God
[1:11:14] need to reflect on your belief here
[1:11:18] Jesus said in John 5 39 search the
[1:11:21] scriptures for in them you think you
[1:11:22] have eternal life
[1:11:24] and they are they that testify of me
[1:11:26] brother around we're sharing that with
[1:11:27] me I believe last service
[1:11:30] Jesus said in 1412 John 14 12 verily
[1:11:33] verily I say unto you he that believeth
[1:11:35] on me
[1:11:37] the works I do shall he do also and
[1:11:40] Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:11:42] because I go to my father so
[1:11:46] there is an old nature that just is
[1:11:50] continuing to shed away and even though
[1:11:53] Maybe
[1:11:54] like we're not going to have service
[1:11:56] this Sunday some of us have missed
[1:11:58] services
[1:12:00] some of us go on vacation
[1:12:02] some of us are going to have surgery
[1:12:06] we still got to continue to build Christ
[1:12:09] in our life we've got to find a way to
[1:12:12] get that word inside and nature needs to
[1:12:15] continue to change through our trials
[1:12:18] through our test
[1:12:20] the works I do shall he do also see all
[1:12:24] things
[1:12:25] become of God all things
[1:12:28] verse 18. and all things are of God who
[1:12:32] have reconciled us
[1:12:35] to himself by Jesus Christ here's God's
[1:12:38] gift to us
[1:12:39] and has given us the ministry of
[1:12:43] reconciliation
[1:12:46] we'll get to that here in a second to
[1:12:48] wit that God was in Christ reconciling
[1:12:52] the world unto himself not imputing
[1:12:55] their trespass is unto them see there's
[1:12:57] God's gift to the world and is committed
[1:13:00] unto us the word of reconciliation
[1:13:05] when the Holy Spirit cometh unto us the
[1:13:07] word of reconciliation that's the
[1:13:10] responsibility that God has given to us
[1:13:15] so this gift comes with a responsibility
[1:13:19] because he's he's wanting to reconcile
[1:13:23] the whole world but he's not here in the
[1:13:25] flesh anymore
[1:13:26] so he's using us
[1:13:28] and I'll tell you I know it's hard
[1:13:31] I know it gets lonely
[1:13:34] I I I know it it just seems frustrating
[1:13:37] because people don't want God enough but
[1:13:39] I'm telling you as long as we're here we
[1:13:42] need to be sharing Christ with as many
[1:13:44] people as possible
[1:13:45] [Music]
[1:13:46] just like the Shepherds did
[1:13:49] bring in the good news of God's gift to
[1:13:51] others just share it share it you can't
[1:13:53] get out get on the phone text somebody
[1:13:55] but just start sharing Jesus with
[1:13:57] somebody because if you don't focus on
[1:14:00] that you're going to drift off in your
[1:14:01] own little world
[1:14:03] right and believing all of our worlds
[1:14:06] they got problems
[1:14:07] they got problems
[1:14:12] and we need God to help us verse 20 says
[1:14:15] now then we like the Shepherds were our
[1:14:19] ambassadors for Christ
[1:14:21] as though God did beseech You by us we
[1:14:24] pray you in Christ that be reconciled to
[1:14:27] God
[1:14:28] so brother Mann said
[1:14:31] that we backslide a hundred times a day
[1:14:35] that means if I backslide I'm I need to
[1:14:38] be reconciled
[1:14:40] I need to be reconnected
[1:14:43] to God
[1:14:45] and all of those 100 times that we
[1:14:48] backslide
[1:14:49] and it might be a lot more now
[1:14:52] in our in our thoughts and in the things
[1:14:54] that we do
[1:14:56] um we probably don't even recognize them
[1:14:58] a lot of them
[1:14:59] because we get so caught up in
[1:15:04] pretty much thinking that
[1:15:06] we're right every man's right in his own
[1:15:08] eyes so what is there to to to to
[1:15:12] reconcile with
[1:15:15] but look we've been predestinated to
[1:15:17] carry this message to others
[1:15:21] we
[1:15:23] we who are serving God if we're
[1:15:26] backsliding what about those who aren't
[1:15:28] pressing in
[1:15:30] and they need to be reconciled
[1:15:34] and by you caring about somebody enough
[1:15:37] to share Jesus with them
[1:15:40] you're fulfilling the will of God
[1:15:42] brother Brandon said Mission work is
[1:15:43] always in the will of God we can be
[1:15:45] doing that in our homes
[1:15:47] in our in our neighborhood and and at
[1:15:49] work but you talk about predestinated
[1:15:52] we're predestinated to carry this
[1:15:55] message
[1:15:56] to reconcile others that's what we're
[1:15:58] predestinated to we're elected we're
[1:16:01] chosen of God to carry this word to
[1:16:05] somebody
[1:16:06] how can we be part of God's elect and
[1:16:10] not do that right not be concerned about
[1:16:13] it
[1:16:14] how can we
[1:16:15] we focus on wanting God to be concerned
[1:16:19] about us but we're not concerned of
[1:16:21] others
[1:16:22] how can that be
[1:16:25] God's gift is not a Christmas present
[1:16:27] it's a life that lives inside of us so
[1:16:30] as much as you believe God is concerned
[1:16:33] about you you must be that concerned
[1:16:36] about others because that same Christ
[1:16:38] lives in you
[1:16:40] can't separate that you can't have this
[1:16:43] life over here for yourself in some
[1:16:45] other life for somebody else
[1:16:48] we are the chosen ones we are the elect
[1:16:51] lady that is that carries the word
[1:16:54] to somebody else
[1:16:57] we definitely live in a world of people
[1:16:59] hurting
[1:17:01] that need the love of Christ
[1:17:05] now those that believe in God's Gift in
[1:17:08] some other way that's being presented
[1:17:10] tonight I just want to say we need to
[1:17:12] get back to Christ we need to reflect on
[1:17:15] our intimate relationship with Christ
[1:17:17] just how intimate is it
[1:17:19] because God's Gift of Christ is not a
[1:17:23] Christmas present to us it's ready for
[1:17:26] those who believe and Paul said of an
[1:17:28] Angel
[1:17:29] or myself come preaching any other
[1:17:31] gospel then what has already been
[1:17:34] presented let him be a curse and we know
[1:17:38] there's so many people who will focus on
[1:17:41] only part of the word
[1:17:44] the part that appeals to so many people
[1:17:46] but then their nature doesn't change
[1:17:52] and and really
[1:17:56] they're the ones that's going to be
[1:17:57] heard at the end
[1:18:00] and to have God use you to pull one out
[1:18:03] of the fire here to pull one out of the
[1:18:05] fire there
[1:18:06] that's glorious
[1:18:08] just one soul
[1:18:10] just one so helping one sold her eyes to
[1:18:13] come open
[1:18:16] now a Believer can't walk any higher
[1:18:18] than what he has received from Christ is
[1:18:20] that true
[1:18:21] amen
[1:18:23] while man
[1:18:25] is trying to build a man-made religion
[1:18:28] God is building his church by revelation
[1:18:31] so it's hard to grow in Christ if we're
[1:18:34] not receiving the revelation of the word
[1:18:36] I wish your church attendance and ties
[1:18:39] and you know just the easy thing of of
[1:18:41] this that and the other could get the
[1:18:43] job done but
[1:18:45] we need revelation
[1:18:47] and the just shall live by faith and we
[1:18:51] need to be focused on receiving the
[1:18:54] faith of the word that's being precious
[1:18:55] we come to church
[1:18:58] because a Believer cannot walk
[1:19:00] any higher or any closer or any more
[1:19:03] with God than the receiving of God
[1:19:06] because the knowledge of God won't do it
[1:19:08] how many people have got the knowledge
[1:19:11] that go the seminaries they debate they
[1:19:14] go back and forth
[1:19:16] but there's no life
[1:19:19] all right Colossians chapter 2.
[1:19:25] are you getting a little something out
[1:19:26] of this
[1:19:27] praise the Lord
[1:19:30] help us to get through this Colossians
[1:19:32] chapter 2 starting with verse 6 as ye
[1:19:36] therefore
[1:19:38] as ye have therefore received Christ
[1:19:40] Jesus the Lord
[1:19:42] sawaki and him
[1:19:45] that's pretty that's pretty clear as
[1:19:47] you've received this gift of God now
[1:19:49] walk in them
[1:19:53] wear it walk in it live it Proclaim it
[1:19:57] share the good news walk in the light
[1:20:01] this true gift that God has given us is
[1:20:06] to be walked in
[1:20:08] to be displayed For unto you is born
[1:20:11] this day into the city of David a savior
[1:20:14] which is Christ Jesus the Lord so as
[1:20:16] you've received Jesus Christ the lord so
[1:20:20] walk ye in him
[1:20:22] walk in him
[1:20:26] verse 7 rooted
[1:20:28] and built up in him
[1:20:31] established in the faith as ye have been
[1:20:34] taught abounding therein with
[1:20:37] Thanksgiving
[1:20:40] the believer who never gets rooted in
[1:20:42] Christ
[1:20:43] will never be able to get built up in
[1:20:46] Christ
[1:20:48] he just won't be able to knowledge won't
[1:20:50] do it
[1:20:51] Jesus said
[1:20:52] because as soon as some hard trial comes
[1:20:57] some Temptation they would begin
[1:21:00] to break away from where they once were
[1:21:05] because their Roots were not deep enough
[1:21:08] to hold them down
[1:21:10] so it's imperative in this important to
[1:21:14] get keep getting the roots to go down
[1:21:17] get the roots to go down and build up
[1:21:20] the leaves build up the the the branches
[1:21:23] build up your life
[1:21:25] establish in the faith if it's hard to
[1:21:28] have faith in what you're going through
[1:21:29] find one small thing that you can have
[1:21:33] faith in and believe for that call
[1:21:36] somebody pray with them and say I'm
[1:21:37] believing with you and start building
[1:21:40] your faith because the Bible says build
[1:21:42] your yourselves up in the Most Holy
[1:21:44] Faith you can't expect not to uh you
[1:21:49] can't expect to receive faith if you're
[1:21:51] not building your faith in the greatest
[1:21:53] way to receive faith is when you hear
[1:21:56] the word say that's for me
[1:21:59] because faith is when God speaks to you
[1:22:01] personally and you take it personally
[1:22:03] you don't say well yeah I know that's
[1:22:05] the word that's not what I'm going
[1:22:06] that's not what I need you know what
[1:22:08] just have an attitude that God I'm here
[1:22:12] God I'm here
[1:22:13] whatever you'd have for me
[1:22:16] each and every time you receive Christ
[1:22:19] the word God's gift
[1:22:22] becomes more you become more rooted and
[1:22:25] you become more built up it is that
[1:22:28] simple it's not so much have you heard
[1:22:31] this before it's which part do we need
[1:22:34] to be reminded of which part do we need
[1:22:37] to be doing which part if we let slip
[1:22:39] away
[1:22:40] we just need to start building our lives
[1:22:44] around the world get more serious with
[1:22:46] the word when you get up in the morning
[1:22:48] you you just say God I'm just going to
[1:22:50] read one verse and I'm trusting you that
[1:22:52] that one verse you're going to speak to
[1:22:54] me and and you're gonna it's gonna be
[1:22:56] real clear what you want me to do and
[1:22:57] I'm going to do it that day
[1:22:59] something like that to where is not just
[1:23:03] so General General no get specific get
[1:23:06] get get get intimate get close because
[1:23:09] we've got to start finding out what God
[1:23:12] wants us to do every day and begin to do
[1:23:14] it
[1:23:17] continually bounding the Bible says
[1:23:20] there with with Thanksgiving so you're
[1:23:23] rooted you're built up established as
[1:23:26] you have been taught abounding with
[1:23:29] Thanksgiving I wonder how many has
[1:23:33] abounded with Thanksgiving
[1:23:36] just just today just abounded one bound
[1:23:40] I mean not just not just gave thanks but
[1:23:45] you can say I abounded in it
[1:23:47] see this is a hard one for us
[1:23:50] because we're facing so many problems
[1:23:54] so many so many things that we got to
[1:23:58] deal with
[1:23:59] but when you can start abounding in
[1:24:02] Thanksgiving you're trusting God for
[1:24:04] your situation that you know God is with
[1:24:07] it no matter how hard it is
[1:24:10] and you can just say thank you Lord
[1:24:12] sincerely because God promised I'll
[1:24:15] never leave you I'll never forsake you
[1:24:18] this thing that we're going through it
[1:24:20] could be for our faith to test us to see
[1:24:22] where we're going to be we don't know
[1:24:25] all that is behind it but what we do
[1:24:27] know is that God is with us and that
[1:24:30] just that just should make it so much
[1:24:33] easier for us
[1:24:37] we
[1:24:38] have not received Christ Jesus as a
[1:24:41] Christmas present those that receive
[1:24:42] Jesus Christ as a Christmas present
[1:24:44] don't walk in him
[1:24:46] but we that have received him as a
[1:24:49] person as a personal intimate he died
[1:24:53] for me and I'm going to live for him
[1:24:56] well we walk in him
[1:24:58] amen as we receive Christ as a new life
[1:25:02] a new nature will begin to develop
[1:25:05] around us and we will begin to see
[1:25:07] things change in our life
[1:25:11] but we have to continually
[1:25:14] continually desire that not just once at
[1:25:18] the beginning
[1:25:19] and we can't keep getting baptized every
[1:25:21] day
[1:25:22] right so what we can do though is keep
[1:25:25] saying God I want more of you I want to
[1:25:28] grow more in you I want this this habit
[1:25:30] out I want to start uh laying down my
[1:25:33] life for others I want to start reaching
[1:25:35] out for other Souls because we've
[1:25:37] received the Life of Christ
[1:25:41] not some present but the life
[1:25:45] we received eternal life and brother
[1:25:47] Branham said eternal life was really
[1:25:48] living for others you basically don't
[1:25:51] have anything to do with it it's not
[1:25:53] about your will what you got going what
[1:25:55] you want is he accomplished it is
[1:25:58] nothing to do with you
[1:26:01] eternal life is when you're actually
[1:26:03] laying down yourself to go help somebody
[1:26:07] and there's there's a big need there
[1:26:11] there's a big need there
[1:26:15] I'll say we don't start
[1:26:17] eternal life doesn't start when we get
[1:26:18] to heaven
[1:26:20] right
[1:26:21] eternal life starts now you start living
[1:26:24] for others now
[1:26:25] you don't wait till you get to the other
[1:26:28] side
[1:26:30] amen Colossians chapter 2 verse 6 as you
[1:26:33] therefore receive Christ Jesus the Lord
[1:26:35] saw walking and rooted built up and
[1:26:38] established in the faith as you've been
[1:26:39] taught abounding there with it with
[1:26:41] Thanksgiving here's verse 8 beware lest
[1:26:44] any man spoil you to vote to philosophy
[1:26:49] okay seduce you through the study of
[1:26:53] knowledge and reasoning
[1:26:55] that's what that means bewareless any
[1:26:57] man seduce you through the study of
[1:27:00] knowledge and reasoning and vain deceit
[1:27:03] after the tradition of men after the
[1:27:06] rudiments of the world and not after
[1:27:08] Christ
[1:27:10] so if an angel come preaching any
[1:27:13] preaching
[1:27:14] the word of God is a Christmas present
[1:27:17] one-sided
[1:27:21] well
[1:27:23] let me be accursed
[1:27:28] the years they're seducing Spirits out
[1:27:31] there
[1:27:33] presenting only the part of the Gospel
[1:27:39] and it's a philosophy
[1:27:41] it's a it's it's vain deceit it's it's a
[1:27:44] tradition of men it's the rudiments of
[1:27:47] the world and I tell you the Bible says
[1:27:49] it'll spoil you
[1:27:50] it'll spoil your relationship with
[1:27:52] Christ it will seduce you
[1:27:56] I think Galatians 5 7 says you did run
[1:27:59] well
[1:28:00] who did hinder you that you should not
[1:28:02] obey the truth amen this persuasion
[1:28:05] cometh not of him that calleth you
[1:28:09] so it's some other seed that came in and
[1:28:12] and trying to to mix it in trying to you
[1:28:14] know the devil as much as you know we
[1:28:17] hear the the gospel preach whether it's
[1:28:19] you know coming to church here or
[1:28:20] reading the Bible or listening to the
[1:28:23] tapes
[1:28:24] and and the word is calling us to a more
[1:28:27] consecrated walk with him all the time
[1:28:29] that's the spirit of God behind it
[1:28:32] and the devil is constantly working
[1:28:35] against that through everything else
[1:28:37] like that's really not that necessary
[1:28:40] that's going too far that's too much
[1:28:43] this is all you need to do
[1:28:45] and those are the spirits that we're
[1:28:47] wrestling against
[1:28:49] now watch this in verse 9 this is the
[1:28:51] same theme this is not a different
[1:28:54] subject for in him dwelleth all the
[1:28:57] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:29:01] and you are complete in him which is the
[1:29:04] head of all principalities and power so
[1:29:08] if the fullness dwelt in Jesus Christ
[1:29:11] and as you've receive Jesus Christ so
[1:29:14] walk in him you are complete in him you
[1:29:17] have what it takes to live the life you
[1:29:20] have what it takes to be an overcomer
[1:29:22] you have the power you can't separate
[1:29:26] um you can't separate the Life of Christ
[1:29:29] with with with
[1:29:31] um the word you can't separate the Life
[1:29:34] of Christ by just uh from your from your
[1:29:37] life because as you've received Christ
[1:29:40] the Bible says you're complete in him
[1:29:43] it's up to you to believe that you can't
[1:29:46] you don't let something spoil you or
[1:29:49] deceit you through reasoning and and
[1:29:52] knowledge and thinking that it can be
[1:29:54] separated you are one with him that
[1:29:58] means you can expect yourself to be an
[1:30:00] overcomer amen
[1:30:02] now tell all certain things to keep you
[1:30:05] down or or keep you discouraged but that
[1:30:08] you might at times have to encourage
[1:30:10] yourself in the Lord that's true
[1:30:12] it seems that you have to do that more
[1:30:14] and more because the love of many is
[1:30:16] waxing cold but you're still completing
[1:30:19] him
[1:30:21] you've received the complete package
[1:30:25] the complete package
[1:30:28] your gift from God shall supply all of
[1:30:32] your needs according to his riches in
[1:30:34] Glory by Christ Jesus now that's the
[1:30:36] word of God
[1:30:38] that happens when you believe
[1:30:43] that happens when you receive the gift
[1:30:47] now you receive the gift of God and
[1:30:49] you're completing him now you can do all
[1:30:52] things through Christ who strengtheneth
[1:30:53] you
[1:30:55] amen you don't need anything else
[1:30:58] you may not be able to
[1:31:01] to handle things but remember
[1:31:04] he can
[1:31:06] and he's in you
[1:31:09] and you're completing him
[1:31:12] and so whatever you need lies within you
[1:31:15] even though your brain says I don't know
[1:31:17] what to do and I don't know how to
[1:31:18] handle this and I don't know how to
[1:31:19] please and I don't know how to hold you
[1:31:21] must believe he's in you you must
[1:31:23] believe he's complete in you that he
[1:31:25] will supply every need
[1:31:27] [Music]
[1:31:29] you may not have what you need right now
[1:31:33] I understand that
[1:31:34] but you have the promise he will supply
[1:31:37] your needs
[1:31:39] you have the complete package
[1:31:42] he came unto his own and his own
[1:31:45] received him not but as many as received
[1:31:47] him to them gave him power to become
[1:31:51] even to them that believe on his name
[1:31:53] I'm believing the word of God this is
[1:31:55] what the word says and I'm believing no
[1:31:59] we have to be
[1:32:01] careful
[1:32:04] we have to be careful about this belief
[1:32:07] we want the belief to be very rooted
[1:32:11] very we want that we want our belief to
[1:32:14] be forever
[1:32:17] um we understand what happened about
[1:32:20] um the sons of skiva and they they took
[1:32:24] the name of Jesus and they wanted to
[1:32:27] cast out uh uh a devils
[1:32:30] and that demon spoke out and said Jesus
[1:32:33] I know Paul I know Jesus I know but who
[1:32:35] are you
[1:32:36] but yet they were acting like they
[1:32:38] believed
[1:32:39] and so I just say this we know the word
[1:32:45] tells us
[1:32:47] that God will supply our needs
[1:32:49] and that we can do all things through
[1:32:51] Christ
[1:32:52] and that he has given his power and we
[1:32:55] should stand on the word
[1:32:57] but know this of assuredly
[1:33:00] that when you stand there you will be
[1:33:02] tested so it's not about how much you
[1:33:05] can claim it right this moment
[1:33:08] but it's how much you can stand there
[1:33:10] after you've claimed it
[1:33:12] and this is so important because we will
[1:33:15] be tried
[1:33:17] you've got to remain in that place of
[1:33:20] firmness that God said it I believe it
[1:33:23] and I'm not I'm not deterring from here
[1:33:24] I am not getting off this I'm staying
[1:33:27] right here if God has promised me that
[1:33:30] I'm going to be like him I'm standing
[1:33:32] right here if God said that he'll he'll
[1:33:35] he he wants me to walk in the light then
[1:33:37] he'll give me power to walk in the word
[1:33:39] that just came forth
[1:33:42] he's given his power to walk in his word
[1:33:46] to walk into the authority of his word
[1:33:50] to walk in the power of His word
[1:33:54] and I'll say it like this I want my life
[1:33:57] to be more pleasing to the Lord
[1:34:02] I want to walk in the light of the word
[1:34:04] as he gives it to me
[1:34:07] when we truly receive the word
[1:34:09] we have power
[1:34:11] to walk in it
[1:34:13] it's only when we got the knowledge of
[1:34:16] we received the knowledge of the word or
[1:34:18] the reasoning of the word
[1:34:20] and we truly don't take the love of it
[1:34:23] into our hearts we've got to fall in
[1:34:26] love with the word I mean just love this
[1:34:29] word I love the word I love the word I
[1:34:32] love coming to church and hearing the
[1:34:34] word I love the realness of the word I
[1:34:36] love how it speaks to me how it just
[1:34:38] gets into my heart and it it Pricks me
[1:34:41] and it it washes me and it cleanses me
[1:34:43] and it directs my life and it gives me
[1:34:46] just what I need
[1:34:49] too many people only want the Christmas
[1:34:52] present
[1:34:54] the this these needs be met these wishes
[1:34:58] this this list this this this that I
[1:35:01] have
[1:35:02] and I I
[1:35:04] I know God loves us so much he wants to
[1:35:07] give us everything he wants us to
[1:35:09] prosper and everything
[1:35:11] but God wants something so much more and
[1:35:13] that's a relationship
[1:35:15] now that's the part that only we can
[1:35:17] give
[1:35:18] we can only give our heart God will
[1:35:20] never take it he will never he won't do
[1:35:23] it
[1:35:24] the key is having a deeper love for the
[1:35:27] word now we're going to be closing with
[1:35:29] this John 14 verse 21.
[1:35:33] John 14 21 he that hath my Commandments
[1:35:38] and keepeth them
[1:35:40] he it is that loveth me
[1:35:43] and he that loveth me shall be loved to
[1:35:45] my father and I will love him and will
[1:35:48] manifest myself to him now you can take
[1:35:52] this whole world but don't take that
[1:35:54] from me
[1:35:55] take everything I have but don't take
[1:35:58] that from me
[1:35:59] that is my life that's what means the
[1:36:03] most to me once you lose your love
[1:36:05] relationship things go south in your
[1:36:08] relationship with God
[1:36:10] that's when wrong things start coming in
[1:36:13] that's when Ron desires start coming
[1:36:14] that's when you stop caring about others
[1:36:18] you got to get back to the very root of
[1:36:21] love
[1:36:22] Judas saith unto him now to scare it
[1:36:24] Lord how is it that thou will manifest
[1:36:26] thyself to us
[1:36:28] and not to the world how are you gonna
[1:36:30] how are you gonna do this thing where we
[1:36:33] all won't see it only some of us will
[1:36:38] it's so easy
[1:36:40] it's man's love for the word
[1:36:43] if you love the word God will manifest
[1:36:46] himself to you
[1:36:48] is that it and the person next to us in
[1:36:51] the world not loving the word is not
[1:36:54] going to see Christ
[1:36:57] it's not going to have Christ manifested
[1:36:59] it's all through free more agency Jesus
[1:37:01] answered and said unto him if a man
[1:37:03] loves me he will keep my words
[1:37:08] and my father will love him
[1:37:11] and will come unto him and make our bold
[1:37:14] with him now if God so loved the world
[1:37:17] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:37:21] was the love of God manifested but
[1:37:24] that's not what we're talking about here
[1:37:27] we're talking about taking this gift
[1:37:30] that God has given and making a
[1:37:32] relationship out of it
[1:37:35] taking it to the point that you will
[1:37:38] continue to keep his word not just Lord
[1:37:41] I'm sorry for my sins get baptized
[1:37:44] and and and and and and now you're a
[1:37:47] sound or daughter of God no it's about
[1:37:49] building a relationship that the next
[1:37:52] time you come to church you know God's
[1:37:54] got a word for you because God is not a
[1:37:56] God who don't care about us he's a God
[1:38:00] that has a word for us it is our flesh
[1:38:03] and it's the spirit that get honest and
[1:38:05] the things that we listen to and the
[1:38:07] reason and the knowledge that seduces us
[1:38:10] and think that it's not that big a deal
[1:38:12] and then we miss out why we're not
[1:38:15] manifesting more the love of God
[1:38:23] if you love God you will love his word
[1:38:26] let's Stand Together
[1:38:29] we are a blessed people amen we're not a
[1:38:32] people that wander in darkness
[1:38:34] spalled by the philosophy of an easier
[1:38:37] way or seduced by the devil's deceit
[1:38:41] or tricked into thinking we don't need
[1:38:43] anything
[1:38:45] we have received the power of God
[1:38:48] because we view this beautiful gift that
[1:38:52] God sent
[1:38:54] is not a Christmas present
[1:38:57] but it's a relationship
[1:38:59] that you know what
[1:39:01] we have
[1:39:03] the control like some of us think it's
[1:39:06] too hot or too cold in here right
[1:39:09] so this is the control tower right here
[1:39:11] we can control if we want it hotter or
[1:39:15] cooler we can control how much we're
[1:39:17] going to manifest Christ right the
[1:39:19] promise is right there
[1:39:21] just love the word keep the word before
[1:39:25] you know it you're manifesting it that's
[1:39:27] his word it's not my word my words will
[1:39:30] fail I can't even keep my word but God
[1:39:33] keeps his word amen amen
[1:39:38] amen let's it's our heads in a in a word
[1:39:41] of prayer if you feel this way
[1:39:44] God
[1:39:45] has spoken to you just hold that before
[1:39:47] the Lord as we go to him
[1:39:50] in prayer Heavenly Father
[1:39:52] Lord I believe that
[1:39:55] we've all come short in one time or

[1:40:07] we're so grateful that
