[41:36] which the heaven shall pass away with a
[41:38] great noise and the element shall melt
[41:41] with fervent Heat their Earth also and
[41:43] the works that are therein shall be
[41:46] burned up seeing then that all these
[41:50] things seeing then that all these things
[41:51] shall be dissolved what Manner persons
[41:54] ought ye to be in a holy conversation
[41:56] and godliness looking for and hastening
[42:00] until the coming of the day of God
[42:04] wherein the heavens being on fire shall
[42:07] be dissolved and the elements shall melt
[42:10] with fervent heat
[42:13] nevertheless we according to his promise
[42:17] look for new heavens and a new Earth
[42:21] wherein dwelleth
[42:23] righteousness amen then in Revelations
[42:26] chapter 21 we're going to read the uh
[42:30] first 10 verses
[42:32] there and
[42:34] I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for
[42:39] the first Heaven and the first Earth
[42:43] were passed away and there was no more
[42:46] sea and I John saw the new the the holy
[42:50] city the New Jerusalem coming down from
[42:54] God out of heaven
[42:58] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[43:03] husband so notice the
[43:07] bride is getting ready to look more
[43:12] appealing to her husband she's adorning
[43:16] herself she's she wants to get the
[43:18] attraction of her husband amen and I
[43:22] heard a great voice out of Heaven saying
[43:25] behold the Tabernacle of God is with men
[43:29] and he will dwell with them and they
[43:31] shall be his people and God himself
[43:33] shall be with them and be their God and
[43:36] God shall wipe away all tears from their
[43:38] eyes and there shall be no more death
[43:40] neither sorrow or crying neither shall
[43:43] there be any more pain for the former
[43:45] things are passed away can you say Amen
[43:47] to that
[43:49] verse and he that sat upon the throne
[43:52] said behold I make all things new and he
[43:56] said unto me
[43:58] write uh
[44:00] for uh for these words are true and
[44:04] faithful amen and he said unto me it is
[44:07] done I am the alpha the Omega the
[44:08] beginning and the end I will give unto
[44:12] him that is a thirst of the Fountain of
[44:14] Life freely and he that
[44:16] overcometh shall inherit all things and
[44:18] I will be his God and he shall be my son
[44:22] but the fearful and the
[44:24] unbelieving abominable B the murders and
[44:26] hor mongers Sorcerers and
[44:30] adulterers and all liars shall have
[44:33] their part in the lake of which burneth
[44:35] with fire and
[44:37] brimstone uh which is the second death
[44:41] and there came unto me one of the Seven
[44:43] Angels which had the seven vows full of
[44:46] the seven last plagues and Tau with me
[44:48] saying come hither and I will show Thee
[44:52] the
[44:53] bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me
[44:57] away in the spirit to a great and high
[45:01] mountain and showed me the great City
[45:04] the holy Jerusalem descending Out of
[45:07] Heaven from God having the glory of God
[45:11] Amen God bless you may be seated may the
[45:14] Lord
[45:15] just bless us this morning with a
[45:18] freshness of these scriptures here
[45:22] amen God wants to become one with us
[45:25] amen he wants to dwell in us and the
[45:29] Bible tells us that all the former
[45:32] things are going to be passed away right
[45:35] and that all things are going to be new
[45:36] so I can say it like this I believe that
[45:38] the bride her old nature is going to be
[45:42] passed away amen wouldn't it be great
[45:45] one day to wake up and not have to
[45:47] crucify our flesh not have to deny it
[45:50] but just to know that it has passed
[45:53] away amen well many people
[45:56] are afraid to let the word of God
[45:58] control them and the Bible says but the
[46:01] fearful and the
[46:03] unbelieving they are in the same boat as
[46:05] the abominal and the murderers and the
[46:08] Liars so fear is a terrible
[46:12] thing and there are a lot of people that
[46:15] are afraid just to let the word to
[46:17] control them and others simply just
[46:19] don't believe it because they just don't
[46:21] think it's necessary they they they they
[46:23] they repented they got baptized they
[46:25] accepted what Jesus did for them on the
[46:27] cross and that is the extent of their
[46:30] relationship and so many people have
[46:33] lost hope in this world this used to be
[46:36] a great
[46:38] nation and it has fallen amen uh our
[46:42] borders have been open to to terrorists
[46:44] and who knows what else has come
[46:48] in it's definitely made it easier for
[46:50] the the drug drugs to come in and uh I I
[46:54] believe it
[46:56] trafficking human trafficking and all
[46:58] kinds of stuff it just made it easier
[47:01] because the borders have been open and
[47:04] there's problems those who voted for it
[47:07] have have come against it and I'm not
[47:09] into politics but I'm just stating some
[47:11] of the world of Affairs that's going on
[47:13] here in the
[47:14] states fear has gripped the world
[47:17] though Bible says men's Hearts would be
[47:20] failing for
[47:22] fear is there going to be a financial
[47:25] and an econ iCal
[47:27] crash is cyber terrorism going to be our
[47:31] downfall our deadly virus is going to be
[47:35] released is socialism going to take over
[47:38] is Russia or China going to Nuke
[47:41] us and what is our government doing
[47:44] about these
[47:46] things according to a poll in 2015 1ir
[47:50] of the population said that their
[47:53] Congress was
[47:54] corrupt
[47:57] just last year 56% of the survey res uh
[48:02] respondents said that their government
[48:04] was corrupt so it's
[48:06] increased and just this year it has
[48:09] risen over
[48:12] 60% we know politics is corrupt amen but
[48:17] think that those that don't have Christ
[48:19] what do they have to look to where is
[48:22] their
[48:23] hope so they try to grab on to some some
[48:27] politics some government some party but
[48:29] they they're losing
[48:31] hope politics and the government a
[48:34] business a church or home is nothing but
[48:38] selfs serving interest or behavior
[48:41] that's all it is and and the better
[48:44] lobbyist you are the better you can
[48:46] manipulate the more value be you become
[48:49] to those who's willing to pay to get
[48:52] their
[48:54] interest brand said in the the message
[48:56] uncertain sound he said quoting the
[48:58] scripture Babylon has fallen is Fallen
[49:01] become the habitation of every unclean
[49:04] spirit amen he says that's exactly where
[49:08] it's at sure we have no security in our
[49:11] nation it's uncertain everywhere
[49:14] uncertainties uncertain in your job
[49:16] uncertain in your politics uncertain in
[49:18] the Democratic party uncertain in the
[49:20] Republican Party uncertainty in all
[49:23] parties that's right and in the church
[49:25] church it's also uncertainty am we don't
[49:28] want to put our trust in this church
[49:31] amen let me say that again I want to
[49:33] hear amen we don't want to put our trust
[49:35] in this church we want to put our trust
[49:38] in the word of God that that is what we
[49:42] need because if you put your trust in
[49:45] anything but that you're going to miss
[49:52] it there's a fine line this is a vehicle
[49:56] that God has planned to meet us and to
[49:59] deliver the word to us but we don't want
[50:02] to look at church carnally
[50:05] man-made we've got to look at it it
[50:08] spiritually that God is in the body God
[50:10] is is is is washing the body with the
[50:13] body and God is using the the the the th
[50:17] this Pulpit as a as a as a a vehicle to
[50:21] get the word to to uh uh the Bible says
[50:25] to
[50:27] um an entrance shall be ministered unto
[50:30] you and and and this this word that
[50:33] comes forth is truly God speaking to the
[50:35] elect amen I believe that that's right
[50:39] there's been a massive decline just in
[50:42] the very interest of religion multitudes
[50:45] are leaving the church for all sorts of
[50:47] reasons a nation that was once founded
[50:50] on the freedom of religion the people
[50:52] don't even care about religion anymore
[50:54] amen they've lost their moral compass
[50:58] that's right their moral values Paul
[51:00] described this day as a there would be a
[51:02] great fall in way an
[51:06] apostasy today people are watching their
[51:09] uh their denominational values in their
[51:13] churches decline just shrink into more
[51:17] ungodliness they're watching gospel
[51:19] standards disappear and evil slip right
[51:22] into the ranks and I don't want to get
[51:23] into all the things that that people are
[51:25] letting into their churches for you've
[51:27] heard the the news but I believe that
[51:30] the spiritual borders have been let
[51:33] down and have been opened up to every
[51:36] and have become the habitation of devils
[51:39] and a hold of every foul spirit and a
[51:42] cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[51:46] amen Peter said knowing this that there
[51:49] shall come in the last days scoffers
[51:51] walking after their own lust and saying
[51:55] where is the promise of his coming for
[51:57] since the fathers fell asleep all things
[51:59] continue as they were from the beginning
[52:02] of the
[52:03] creation in other words they feel that
[52:05] nothing's changed I don't feel any
[52:08] closer to his coming now than when I
[52:10] first gave my heart to
[52:12] God because these these are not worldly
[52:15] people that he's referring to that are
[52:17] golfers these are worldly believers who
[52:20] believe in the second coming of the Lord
[52:23] amen but inside their heart they're
[52:25] saying where's the promised I don't see
[52:28] anything changing inside of
[52:30] me that's what they're saying they don't
[52:32] say it out loud but
[52:35] inside
[52:37] see they don't see spiritually the
[52:39] coming of the Lord and if they did they
[52:42] would be gathering all the more as they
[52:44] saw the day
[52:45] approaching
[52:47] amen people as a whole are are losing
[52:50] hope brother Bram said in the message
[52:52] the token he says how can you take any
[52:54] chance on any church membership or
[52:57] anything else how can you afford to do
[52:59] it seeing we're living in a time when
[53:02] there is no hope in politics there's no
[53:05] hope in the future the only uh the only
[53:10] thing lies in the coming of Jesus Christ
[53:13] the coming of Christ to get his church
[53:15] that's the only thing that's got hope in
[53:18] it Amen brother Bram said in the message
[53:20] of man running from the presence of God
[53:22] he says press on we must do it we must
[53:25] get down to it everywhere we go and tell
[53:27] the message and tell people that Jesus
[53:30] Christ is coming and he's God and he's
[53:33] coming soon there's not a hope left in
[53:36] the world right but the coming of the
[53:38] Lord amen but yet people are still
[53:41] trying to find Hope in different things
[53:44] amen there's no hope at all in this life
[53:47] amen that's right the Bible tells us
[53:50] that if in this life only we have hope
[53:53] in Christ right we are all men most
[53:56] miserable that's why some people you
[53:59] look at some Christians and they just
[54:00] don't seem to be very
[54:03] happy we're not living for this age
[54:07] amen we're not living for this
[54:10] life it's all about the life to come and
[54:16] how do we know about that life because
[54:18] our nature is changing inside of us
[54:21] that's right it's changing every week
[54:24] amen
[54:27] eternal life is living for
[54:32] others we're not living for this life
[54:34] can you say amen amen how do you know
[54:37] you have eternal
[54:40] life I mean if I was to ask some people
[54:43] that they would say because I believe St
[54:45] John 3:16 I
[54:48] believe but brother Brandon comes along
[54:50] he says well really eternal life is
[54:52] living for others so we can say we
[54:56] believe but we we should be able to take
[54:59] brother Brand's definition look at our
[55:01] life and see if we're living for others
[55:03] amen you know it's like uh Paul saying
[55:07] that uh we're saved by faith and James
[55:10] says no we're saved by works is
[55:14] both and we should be able to see that
[55:17] we have eternal life by how much we're
[55:19] living for others amen come on now this
[55:22] is just gospel I know our flesh wants to
[55:25] just feel that we're that we're we got
[55:27] eternal life no matter what and I'm all
[55:30] for that but I'm to the bride now the
[55:32] bride is the only group that will be
[55:35] living for others amen
[55:38] amen because there's no other hope
[55:41] except in Jesus Christ and his coming
[55:44] abam tells the
[55:46] story about uh a friend of his his name
[55:50] was Wilmer Snider Wilmer Snider anybody
[55:53] remember that story he was an insurance
[55:56] agent and he went to school with him
[55:58] when he was a boy and of course brother
[56:01] brandom he said he he had a a bad
[56:04] experience the way that he sold this
[56:06] insurance to his dad it didn't work out
[56:08] real well but he told Brother R says you
[56:11] you need to get some some life insurance
[56:13] for yourself Billy and amen and brother
[56:16] brother Brandon says well I I already
[56:19] got insurance he says oh I didn't know
[56:21] what insurance did he get he said well
[56:22] blessed insurance he said it real fast
[56:24] you know
[56:27] his wife looked at
[56:29] him finally coming to the realization he
[56:32] says yeah but brother ran says that
[56:34] won't get
[56:35] you in that won't put you in the ground
[56:39] he says I know but it'll get me
[56:44] out and that's what's really
[56:47] important we need to keep our focus on
[56:50] what's important in our lives it's not
[56:54] living for down here it's living for the
[56:56] other
[56:57] side too many people are focusing on
[56:59] this life they're not recognizing their
[57:05] purpose we shouldn't be just waiting for
[57:07] the
[57:08] rapture we should be preparing oursel we
[57:10] should be adorning oursel right
[57:14] right and when we're not doing that we
[57:16] should be living for others amen see the
[57:18] purpose is completely different it's not
[57:20] just
[57:21] waiting it's occupying till I come amen
[57:25] we need to recogniz recognize ourselves
[57:28] in the Bible brother bam taught us that
[57:30] and that when the bride really sees
[57:32] herself who she is then then the Rapture
[57:34] is going to take place so there's
[57:35] there's a process of Us coming to church
[57:37] and recognizing that that's what we are
[57:40] we are that word brother B told that
[57:42] story about the the chicken that the
[57:44] little Eagle that was in the chicken
[57:46] yard and for so much of its its life it
[57:49] was just amongst all the other chickens
[57:52] and it it would it tried to do the
[57:54] things that the uh other chickens were
[57:57] doing and digging in the dirt and
[57:59] looking for bugs and things like that uh
[58:03] but something never just sat right but
[58:05] couldn't explain it didn't know it one
[58:06] time the the eagle uh mother Eagle came
[58:10] by and uh where she had dropped that egg
[58:15] and and and when she cried out that
[58:18] scream of the Gospel was preached then
[58:21] she recognized that that there was a a
[58:24] spirit inside of her that bore witness
[58:27] with the with the spirit of that mother
[58:29] and recognize that there was a
[58:30] connection there and I believe that's
[58:33] what needs to be happening to us we need
[58:35] to recognize that we are the word we're
[58:37] just not saved but we are that word
[58:40] we're to become that word amen Jesus
[58:43] recognized himself in the scriptures
[58:46] amen says lo I come in the volume of the
[58:49] book it is written of me to do thy will
[58:53] oh God MH that's right we've got to
[58:58] recognize that's what we're to do is to
[59:01] to find our place in these scriptures
[59:04] and then when we do we will obey the
[59:07] word we will we will do the will of God
[59:10] and that's why we've come in this age is
[59:12] to manifest the complete word we I'll
[59:15] tell you what if all you want to do is
[59:17] believe then you really should have came
[59:19] up in Luther's
[59:21] age right amen this age we're to
[59:26] Manifest this is the manifesting age to
[59:29] manifest the word amen we must recognize
[59:32] that we are a part of the new thing that
[59:35] God is doing he says he makes all things
[59:38] new now the world is going
[59:44] down the world is not going to be made
[59:49] new he's going to burn he's going to
[59:52] burn the
[59:53] Earth
[59:55] this whole country is going to be blown
[59:57] up in different places right that's what
[1:00:00] we know it to be
[1:00:02] true so the world isn't going to be be
[1:00:05] made
[1:00:06] new but
[1:00:08] we are made new because we're a part of
[1:00:12] him am and this word is the only thing
[1:00:15] that can make us new
[1:00:18] amen we don't believe in the power of
[1:00:21] the Mind Over the
[1:00:23] matter we don't believe in
[1:00:25] selfhelp right we believe in self-
[1:00:29] crucifixion we we believe in letting God
[1:00:32] yelding herself to God let him come in
[1:00:34] and make our life more like his
[1:00:39] amen God hasn't left
[1:00:42] us I'm sure we all battle at
[1:00:46] times Where's God I want to see God more
[1:00:51] maybe he's left us maybe he's left me
[1:00:54] have you ever thought thoughts like
[1:00:57] that yes all right who who's not wanting
[1:01:01] remember all liars you know where they
[1:01:05] go we've all battled at some time or
[1:01:08] another Where's
[1:01:10] God people lose hope when they feel
[1:01:14] alone amen but we must remember God said
[1:01:17] I'll never leave you I'll never forsake
[1:01:19] you amen regardless of what your
[1:01:21] feelings tell you regardless of what
[1:01:23] your mind tells you amen regardless of
[1:01:25] what circumstances tell you I'll be with
[1:01:28] you even in you to the very end now as
[1:01:32] we receive the word that's being
[1:01:34] preached to us into our hearts that is
[1:01:38] actually what's preparing us to be the
[1:01:41] Tabernacle of
[1:01:44] God he didn't choose me because my name
[1:01:46] was John
[1:01:48] Martin he chose me because I belong to
[1:01:53] him that's right
[1:01:55] amen and now we're in this process where
[1:01:59] we're we're building together he gives
[1:02:01] me his word and I say yes Lord not my
[1:02:05] will but thine will be done and I begin
[1:02:07] to walk in the truth of that word it
[1:02:09] becomes important to my life and as I do
[1:02:12] that now I'm
[1:02:14] preparing my vessel a place for him to
[1:02:17] dwell in because I am a part of that
[1:02:19] Tabernacle amen I'm a part of that
[1:02:21] Tabernacle I don't know which part but
[1:02:23] I'm a part part of
[1:02:28] it now we all have to fight thoughts
[1:02:31] that make us feel too comfortable that
[1:02:33] we have already
[1:02:34] attained that's right the Bible says
[1:02:37] God's plan is to present to himself a
[1:02:40] glorious church not having spot or
[1:02:43] wrinkle or any such thing that but it
[1:02:46] should be holy and without blemish God
[1:02:50] wants to dwell in this kind of
[1:02:53] Tabernacle and the Bible tells us that
[1:02:57] this church this Tabernacle is called
[1:02:59] the New Jerusalem prepared as a bride
[1:03:02] adorned for her husband she keeps
[1:03:05] receiving the word and she keeps obeying
[1:03:08] the word and as we do this this is you
[1:03:12] adorning yourself for Jesus Christ
[1:03:15] Christ in you the hope of glory not just
[1:03:19] a a belief mentally not just part of his
[1:03:21] Spirit but now it's the whole word
[1:03:24] because remember in this age more is
[1:03:27] required of the Bride than it was in any
[1:03:29] other age amen and of course the devil
[1:03:32] keeps pointing us back to you know
[1:03:36] something something
[1:03:39] other so we don't press on that's his
[1:03:43] purpose that's and and that's why
[1:03:46] sometimes we look at the the the
[1:03:48] ministry here sometimes and it's it's
[1:03:50] it's it it it seems sometimes strong or
[1:03:53] hard but
[1:03:55] you'll never regret when you're on the
[1:03:57] other side ever hearing a a strong
[1:03:59] messag you'll never regret it on the
[1:04:01] other side it's only on this side and
[1:04:03] I'm telling you it's not the inner man
[1:04:05] that's doing it it's not the inner
[1:04:08] man all right 1 Thessalonians chapter
[1:04:15] 4 verse 13 says but I would not have you
[1:04:18] to be ignorant Brethren concerning them
[1:04:22] which are asleep that you suff not even
[1:04:25] as others which have no
[1:04:30] hope but if we believe that Jesus died
[1:04:33] and rose again even so them
[1:04:36] which uh also which sleep in Jesus
[1:04:39] Christ will God bring with him for this
[1:04:42] we say unto you by the word of the Lord
[1:04:45] that they which are alive and remain
[1:04:47] this is us this verse is US unto the
[1:04:51] coming of the Lord shall not pre prevent
[1:04:54] them which are asleep for the Lord
[1:04:57] himself shall descend from heaven with
[1:04:59] the Shout with the voice of the
[1:05:01] Archangel with the Trump of God and the
[1:05:03] dead in Christ shall rise first then we
[1:05:05] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:05:07] caught up together with them in the
[1:05:10] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:05:12] so shall we ever be with the
[1:05:16] Lord now look at this verse 18 wherefore
[1:05:21] Comfort one another with these words am
[1:05:25] now my question to you when is the last
[1:05:27] time you said that these words to
[1:05:31] somebody because we have a
[1:05:33] responsibility here to comfort one
[1:05:35] another with these
[1:05:37] words to talk about it amen because the
[1:05:41] more we we get our phones out we look at
[1:05:43] the news the less we're going to talk
[1:05:45] about it amen our Focus has to be on the
[1:05:49] New
[1:05:50] Jerusalem God is coming down to get us
[1:05:57] amen he wants to dwell on us amen these
[1:06:00] words ought to be encouraging that we're
[1:06:03] ever going to be with the Lord that
[1:06:04] we're not going to be left behind in
[1:06:06] some tribulation amen we've heard the
[1:06:10] shout it's w it's woken us
[1:06:13] up we're we're we're we're going out to
[1:06:17] meet the bridegroom every time we come
[1:06:19] to church we're coming out to meet the
[1:06:22] bridegroom right the word is coming to
[1:06:26] dress us it's his spirit it's the
[1:06:29] quickening
[1:06:30] power and this this
[1:06:34] message uh shakes us out of our sleep
[1:06:37] and you know every day our bodies need
[1:06:39] the rest right and I know as I'm getting
[1:06:41] older I'm I'm having less and less zip
[1:06:45] and zap in my
[1:06:47] life and we need the word to keep
[1:06:50] quickening us amen now if God makes all
[1:06:53] things
[1:06:54] knew don't doubt of what he's going to
[1:06:58] do in your
[1:07:00] life the Bible says he which have begun
[1:07:02] a good work he's going to finish it amen
[1:07:05] and we can't question it we can't doubt
[1:07:08] it we can't all a sudden start going by
[1:07:10] our feelings we St can't go by the news
[1:07:13] that's out in the world we've got to
[1:07:15] stay with the word the word says it we
[1:07:17] believe it and the more we do the more
[1:07:19] we'll be looking forward to to taking
[1:07:21] the word into our life and God there's
[1:07:23] got to be word that I can manifest for
[1:07:25] you in this in in this coming
[1:07:29] week we're not just standing behind I
[1:07:33] believe in in in this
[1:07:37] message as if that's all we got to
[1:07:40] do but we got to get the message
[1:07:42] manifested amen that's the hardest thing
[1:07:45] the easiest thing is to say Amen to the
[1:07:48] word when it's being preached the
[1:07:50] hardest thing is liveing
[1:07:52] it because the flesh is not going to say
[1:07:57] Amen the flesh is not saying so be it no
[1:08:01] no but we
[1:08:04] are the New Jerusalem we are the house
[1:08:06] of God we're the Tabernacle we're God's
[1:08:09] dwelling place and it doesn't seem like
[1:08:11] much right now we look at our our habits
[1:08:14] and our faults and our failures and
[1:08:17] these things should uh motivate us to to
[1:08:22] get more serious with God to to spend
[1:08:24] more time with God to to be with him in
[1:08:26] prayer more and and and and as we each
[1:08:30] year that goes
[1:08:32] by each year that goes by it gets
[1:08:37] harder the world is getting worse but
[1:08:40] here's the thing the bride is getting
[1:08:44] closer has to be because when he appear
[1:08:48] she's going to be just like him amen so
[1:08:51] we see the world going this way we see
[1:08:52] the bride going this way and the the
[1:08:53] question is where are you standing amen
[1:08:56] do do you see yourself growing more in
[1:08:59] his nature do you see yourself living
[1:09:02] more for others do you see yourself
[1:09:04] adorning yourself for the
[1:09:08] bridegroom and and thanks thank the Lord
[1:09:10] that's what we need to hear because look
[1:09:13] even if we don't see ourselves doing
[1:09:15] that you need to say Amen to it we need
[1:09:17] to start doing it because as we're
[1:09:19] approaching this year this could be the
[1:09:21] last year for us we don't know things
[1:09:24] could happen real
[1:09:25] quick things could happen real quick uh
[1:09:28] I don't know who they're going to get
[1:09:30] into the into the government but you
[1:09:33] know it doesn't
[1:09:35] matter we know that somehow something is
[1:09:38] going to be said where they say peace
[1:09:40] and safety everything's okay now but
[1:09:43] then sudden destruction's coming it's
[1:09:45] going to happen I don't know how it's
[1:09:47] going to happen but I'll tell you we
[1:09:49] need to just forget about all that stuff
[1:09:51] it just doesn't matter yes now if God
[1:09:55] has spoke to you to go somewhere and
[1:09:57] tell them about Jesus Christ do that get
[1:10:00] back and and start giving your All to
[1:10:02] Jesus
[1:10:05] Christ let's take a look at John
[1:10:08] 14 Jesus is not wanting us to lose hope
[1:10:12] he's not wanting his disciples to to
[1:10:15] lose hope because he was leaving In the
[1:10:18] Flesh and he says here in John 14 verse1
[1:10:21] let not your heart be trou
[1:10:24] LED ye believe in God believe also in
[1:10:28] me in my father's house are many
[1:10:33] mansions so we're talking about this New
[1:10:37] Jerusalem the new Tabernacle coming down
[1:10:39] right if it were not so I would have
[1:10:42] told you I go to prepare a place for you
[1:10:48] amen and if I go and prepare a place for
[1:10:51] you I will come again and receive
[1:10:53] receive you unto myself that where I am
[1:10:56] there you may be also amen and whether I
[1:11:00] go you know and you know the way now I
[1:11:03] can put myself in Thomas's shoes here
[1:11:07] Thomas sayith him Lord we know not where
[1:11:10] you're going and how can we know the
[1:11:13] way and Jesus said unto him I am the way
[1:11:17] I am the truth and the life and no man
[1:11:22] cometh unto the father
[1:11:24] but by me well there is a million things
[1:11:29] it seems hundreds of things that we can
[1:11:32] talk about in these
[1:11:33] scriptures but where was Jesus
[1:11:38] going where was he
[1:11:43] going he's
[1:11:47] going inside of us to prepare him a
[1:11:50] Dwelling Place amen that's where he's
[1:11:54] going he's not going somewhere up there
[1:11:57] in the
[1:12:01] sky and we know that by the next three
[1:12:04] chapters that we read here Jesus said in
[1:12:07] the same chapter verse 23 Jesus said
[1:12:10] I if a man love me he will keep my words
[1:12:14] and my father will love him and we will
[1:12:16] come unto him and make our abold with
[1:12:19] him see we see this is the process of
[1:12:22] reconciliation right the word Goes Forth
[1:12:26] if we love God enough to receive the
[1:12:28] word the word comes inside then the Holy
[1:12:32] Spirit comes inside of us to live that
[1:12:34] word and we're becoming the New
[1:12:38] Jerusalem amen the new Tabernacle this
[1:12:41] is the process this is where he's going
[1:12:44] to to to make a change and this is why
[1:12:47] we should not be uh ever fearful or or
[1:12:50] or wondering where we stand God is
[1:12:52] living inside of us us verse 26 but the
[1:12:55] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[1:12:58] the father will send in my name he will
[1:13:00] teach you all things and bring all
[1:13:02] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[1:13:04] said unto
[1:13:06] you so we see that process here that the
[1:13:09] Holy Spirit comes and he teaches us and
[1:13:13] he brings things to our
[1:13:15] remembrance chapter 16 verse3 says how
[1:13:18] be it when he the spirit of truth that
[1:13:20] come he will guide you into all Truth
[1:13:22] for he will not speak of himself but
[1:13:25] whatsoever ye shall hear that shall he
[1:13:27] speak and he will show you things to
[1:13:31] come
[1:13:32] amen now how does he guide us into all
[1:13:38] truth is he wanting us to to assemble
[1:13:42] ourselves in some great Seminary to only
[1:13:46] preach the
[1:13:48] truth is that the truth that he's
[1:13:51] talking about did he tell us to do do
[1:13:54] that no no this is a an individual
[1:13:58] working with all of us when he comes and
[1:14:03] he reproves the first nature that you
[1:14:06] were born with he reproves that nature
[1:14:10] he says this should not be in your
[1:14:12] life and that's him guiding you into all
[1:14:15] truth
[1:14:18] amen and he he brings things to your
[1:14:22] remembrance how does he show you or what
[1:14:25] things does he show you to
[1:14:27] come what is
[1:14:29] that what do is he's showing you the new
[1:14:33] nature that you're to
[1:14:36] have you're going to be just like him
[1:14:39] amen he's showing you things to come
[1:14:42] these are the things that are to come in
[1:14:44] your life the new nature of Christ a
[1:14:48] self Christ centered
[1:14:51] nature second Peter we've read this
[1:14:54] before 14 says whereby are given to us
[1:14:57] great exceeding great and precious
[1:15:00] promises that by these you might be
[1:15:02] partakers of the divine nature having
[1:15:05] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:15:07] world through lust so that's what we all
[1:15:09] want to escape right we want to escape
[1:15:12] the corruption that's in this world
[1:15:14] through the desires for those things
[1:15:18] look it uh brother Bram said eve lusted
[1:15:21] for knowledge how many times we get on
[1:15:24] our phones and lust to learn
[1:15:27] something lust to know what's happening
[1:15:31] you understand what I'm saying
[1:15:38] amen I I'm just trying to get us to
[1:15:41] spend more time with God that's it
[1:15:46] amen look we've all crossed the line I
[1:15:50] like what Brother Bruce said here we're
[1:15:52] all we we all need God we all need the
[1:15:54] blood to cover us we all need to be
[1:15:57] cleansed and washed and and filled with
[1:15:59] his
[1:16:02] Spirit now in order for us to be the
[1:16:05] real new Tabernacle the New Jerusalem we
[1:16:08] must have the same nature that God has
[1:16:12] because he's not going to dwell in a
[1:16:14] tabernacle that he feels uncomfortable
[1:16:16] with that's right so most people want to
[1:16:19] be saved but they could care less about
[1:16:22] their nature
[1:16:24] can you say Amen to that I think most
[1:16:26] people want to be saved but they're not
[1:16:28] paying any attention about the
[1:16:31] character but not the bride she's the
[1:16:34] only one that's got up she's has the
[1:16:36] revelation of this important aspect in
[1:16:40] her life that her nature must become
[1:16:41] like Christ yes not her
[1:16:44] knowledge but her
[1:16:46] nature that she acts the way that God
[1:16:49] acts when there's a problem I mean what
[1:16:51] makes God to me so super natural he
[1:16:53] could hang there on the cross and you
[1:16:55] could say father forgive them for they
[1:16:57] don't know what they're doing that he
[1:16:59] really demonstrated turning the cheek he
[1:17:01] really demonstrated loving his
[1:17:04] enemies and that is the nature that we
[1:17:07] must become that you know brother
[1:17:08] Brandon went on the other side where uh
[1:17:12] the the other side where there there was
[1:17:14] no no crying no pain no hurt everything
[1:17:18] was beautiful he he said that it was
[1:17:20] perfect love and there was no way to
[1:17:23] describe how perfect that love was amen
[1:17:26] and he said whatever you do go after it
[1:17:28] and get it because God is love and
[1:17:30] that's what we need to get amen that's
[1:17:33] the nature he wants to dwell with who in
[1:17:35] the world would want to dwell with
[1:17:36] somebody that just only likes him for
[1:17:38] certain
[1:17:41] reasons I I a God who created everything
[1:17:44] do you think he's going to see somebody
[1:17:46] that that they want to be saved but they
[1:17:49] they really don't they really want to
[1:17:50] keep their selfish nature right
[1:17:53] I I I can't see God saying yeah I'm
[1:17:55] going to save
[1:17:56] him and and and I I for sure can't see
[1:18:00] it being the
[1:18:03] bride and so God is yes he's calling us
[1:18:07] up higher but that's
[1:18:10] okay come up hither look when that
[1:18:14] magnet went over everything didn't get
[1:18:16] connected to it right right amen the
[1:18:18] aluminum didn't the plastic didn't it
[1:18:20] the tin didn't it it it it was it was
[1:18:23] just the the things that was uh
[1:18:26] magnetized that had a magnetism and only
[1:18:28] the bride has a has a a part of God
[1:18:31] inside of them and when the word is
[1:18:32] being preached inside of them they say
[1:18:35] Lord that is for me that word that
[1:18:37] you're preaching it's for me I know
[1:18:39] because I'm your bride am and I'm I'm
[1:18:42] going to receive that word I'm G to
[1:18:44] Adorn myself amen I want to attract
[1:18:48] attract
[1:18:49] God in the
[1:18:51] natural in the
[1:18:55] natural when you met your your
[1:18:59] sweetheart there was something inside of
[1:19:01] you that wanted to attract them to
[1:19:04] you
[1:19:06] right what one
[1:19:13] amen and
[1:19:17] look you have a desire that God would
[1:19:21] look upon you
[1:19:23] you want
[1:19:28] God to put you in a position that's
[1:19:32] close to
[1:19:33] him you you are his
[1:19:36] wife and you're you don't want just
[1:19:40] to you appreciate him saving you from
[1:19:43] your sins so
[1:19:45] much that you just want to be your best
[1:19:47] for him
[1:19:49] amen and so how do you Adorn yourself
[1:19:53] how do you get to where you you attract
[1:19:57] God his favor on
[1:20:02] you well what attracts God what attracts
[1:20:07] him what attracts them as His word amen
[1:20:11] now listen to this there's God created
[1:20:14] everything that's
[1:20:16] right there's nothing Heaven is his
[1:20:21] throne Earth Is His full to what house
[1:20:23] will you build me that's right what can
[1:20:27] we do for God that's going to say oh
[1:20:30] yeah I wish I would have had that you
[1:20:35] understand if there's something that he
[1:20:37] wanted more it would be already made
[1:20:40] because he's the Creator it he would it
[1:20:43] would be in his word there's not God
[1:20:46] can't make anything better than what
[1:20:48] he's already done right he can't have a
[1:20:50] better word today amen
[1:20:53] so this word is what attracts
[1:20:56] God and when the bride gets all the word
[1:21:00] there is nothing more that God could
[1:21:02] love about you than you becoming the
[1:21:04] word all the word amen and he's not
[1:21:07] looking for a bride with part he's
[1:21:10] looking for a wife that's without spot
[1:21:12] without wrinkle she's Washed by the
[1:21:14] Water of the word she takes that word
[1:21:17] and she manifests that word
[1:21:19] amen I'll say we' we've heard of love at
[1:21:23] first sight right yes how many times you
[1:21:26] heard somebody say oh when I seen her
[1:21:28] when I seen him it was love at first
[1:21:30] sight I just
[1:21:33] knew well what the Lord Jesus to me is
[1:21:37] love at first sight amen and it's Love
[1:21:40] at Second Sight and third sight fourth
[1:21:43] sight and every time you come into the
[1:21:44] house of God and you hear the word being
[1:21:46] praise there's a love inside you that
[1:21:48] says God I love you I want to be that
[1:21:51] for you Lord amen
[1:21:54] something inside of us is has going to
[1:21:56] want to please
[1:21:58] him it can't be just God pleasing us God
[1:22:01] giving
[1:22:03] us that's it's a it's a
[1:22:06] marriage and there's nothing that
[1:22:09] pleases God more than laying down our
[1:22:11] life and living this word for him that's
[1:22:15] we've heard this scripture before it's
[1:22:16] in 2 Corinthians 3:17 now the Lord is
[1:22:20] that Spirit where the spirit of the Lord
[1:22:21] is there's liberty
[1:22:23] amen a lot of times we we may not feel
[1:22:26] the presence of God like we want
[1:22:28] to first thing we want to do is look
[1:22:32] inwardly honestly I believe I could sit
[1:22:34] in a
[1:22:36] church with all around
[1:22:39] me people
[1:22:41] selfish but I believe if I give the Lord
[1:22:44] Liberty right here in my heart when that
[1:22:46] words being preached I will feel the
[1:22:49] presence of
[1:22:50] God that's right
[1:22:53] I tell you can be alone in your prayer
[1:22:56] closet it don't take long for the
[1:22:58] presence of the Lord to come if you're
[1:22:59] serious with God you get down to
[1:23:02] business and you give God Liberty how do
[1:23:03] you do that repent
[1:23:08] repent his presence will come you'll
[1:23:10] start crying there's no doubt about it
[1:23:12] because when God like brother darl War
[1:23:14] says when God squeezes your squeezes a
[1:23:16] man's heart tears come out of his
[1:23:18] eyes something
[1:23:20] happens but we are
[1:23:23] with open face beholding as in a glass
[1:23:27] the glory of the Lord amen we're
[1:23:30] changed into the same image of God from
[1:23:34] glory to glory even as by the spirit of
[1:23:38] the Lord
[1:23:39] right so brother brandom said it would
[1:23:42] be so simple that many would miss
[1:23:46] it because they're looking well you know
[1:23:49] how it is we want exciting things we
[1:23:52] want something we we don't want to who
[1:23:55] who has ever watched a movie and said
[1:23:58] this is
[1:23:59] boring right and you're like I don't
[1:24:02] want to this is I don't even want to
[1:24:03] watch
[1:24:08] this God is in his word it should never
[1:24:11] be boring
[1:24:15] amen but if we have to we have to get
[1:24:18] God to entertain in front of us see
[1:24:21] we're going to miss it right we're going
[1:24:23] to miss
[1:24:24] it we're attracted to the word we're
[1:24:28] attracted to the word the word is what's
[1:24:31] so beautiful for the bride am amen all
[1:24:35] right turn with me to First Corinthians
[1:24:37] chapter
[1:24:39] 2 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:24:41] 2 now God is continuing to reveal more
[1:24:45] and more to his bride and she is really
[1:24:49] coming to be more in the same image of
[1:24:52] Jesus Christ even though the world's
[1:24:54] going down there and you know how we
[1:24:57] were taught by the prophet that there's
[1:24:58] only going to be like one in a
[1:25:00] million you know just he's he's sending
[1:25:02] a message that it's not going to be a
[1:25:04] lot it's just going to be a few and we
[1:25:08] all we we're like a family right a lot
[1:25:11] of the family is missing
[1:25:13] today but we're we're like a family and
[1:25:17] the thing
[1:25:18] is we all want to
[1:25:21] just
[1:25:23] just believe that we're all going in a
[1:25:25] Rapture
[1:25:27] right you know I'd love to say there's
[1:25:30] nobody here that can stand up here and
[1:25:31] say who's going and who's
[1:25:33] not we don't know but I will say this
[1:25:38] that the righteous
[1:25:40] scarcely
[1:25:42] scarcely so so I believe we need to take
[1:25:46] this word more seriously amen more
[1:25:50] seriously all right
[1:25:54] very beautiful words here 1 Corinthians
[1:25:57] 2:9 says but it is written I Is Not Seen
[1:26:00] Nor Ear heard neither have it entered
[1:26:03] into the heart of man the things which
[1:26:06] God has prepared for them that love
[1:26:11] him wow isn't that beautiful God has
[1:26:15] something in store for
[1:26:17] us but God have revealed them unto us Us
[1:26:23] by his
[1:26:25] Spirit I'll tell you when God you feel
[1:26:28] the presence of God come around you when
[1:26:30] God opens his word to you that is God
[1:26:34] showing you what is in store for us when
[1:26:37] we get to heaven
[1:26:39] [Applause]
[1:26:43] amen for the spirit searcheth all things
[1:26:46] yay the Deep things of God for what man
[1:26:50] knoweth the things of a man say the
[1:26:51] spirit Spirit of man which is in him
[1:26:54] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[1:26:55] but the spirit of God that's right now
[1:26:58] we have received not the spirit of the
[1:27:00] world we were born with it but we got
[1:27:02] rid of
[1:27:03] it we're crucifying that out amen but
[1:27:07] the spirit which is of god that we might
[1:27:11] know the things that are freely given to
[1:27:14] us of God now what's freely given to us
[1:27:17] of God the things that that we want that
[1:27:19] going to be in heaven I'm telling you a
[1:27:22] double stacker trusted tool is not going
[1:27:24] to be in heaven we're not going to have
[1:27:26] a double story trusted tool that's not
[1:27:29] what he's given us he's given us his
[1:27:32] nature amen that's what's going to be
[1:27:36] with us on the other side
[1:27:39] amen Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:27:42] amen all right which things also we
[1:27:45] speak not in The Words which man's
[1:27:48] Wisdom
[1:27:49] teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[1:27:51] teacheth
[1:27:52] comparing spiritual things with
[1:27:56] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[1:27:58] not the things of the spirit of God for
[1:27:59] their foolishness unto him neither can
[1:28:01] he know them because they are
[1:28:03] spiritually discerned
[1:28:06] amen this
[1:28:08] nature is continually happening or this
[1:28:12] this this nature change is continually
[1:28:16] happening inside of us until our will is
[1:28:20] completely gone
[1:28:26] 2 Corinthians 5:17 says therefore If any
[1:28:29] man be in Christ he's a new creature old
[1:28:32] things are passed away behold all things
[1:28:37] are become new amen and all things are
[1:28:41] of God see God is making all of us new
[1:28:46] not just a new Heaven not just a new
[1:28:49] Earth but he's making a new you
[1:28:53] a new you all things are becoming
[1:28:57] new I love this beloved what manner of
[1:29:01] love the father bestowed upon us that we
[1:29:03] should be called the sons of God
[1:29:05] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:29:07] because it knew him not beloved now are
[1:29:10] we the sons of God and it does not yet
[1:29:13] appear what we shall be but we know that
[1:29:15] when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:29:17] him for we shall see him as he is and
[1:29:20] every man that has this hope in him
[1:29:22] purifies himself even as he is
[1:29:25] pure thank
[1:29:28] God that he's making all things new
[1:29:30] inside of us he's still working on me I
[1:29:34] got a few quotes I'd like to read if I
[1:29:36] could from brother brandom he said in
[1:29:38] the Easter seal he says notice God's
[1:29:41] life which is in the Greek called Zoey
[1:29:46] moving through them and in them
[1:29:49] quickening their minds to his
[1:29:54] word now let me say it real quietly now
[1:29:58] the spirit of God that moves amongst the
[1:30:02] people quickens the minds of the person
[1:30:05] to the promise of God see it does it
[1:30:08] look I'm I'm trying to show you and let
[1:30:11] you realize that I'm speaking now of the
[1:30:14] church and also quickened to the life in
[1:30:20] him so it's a real thing the spirit of
[1:30:24] God moving in our minds as we hear the
[1:30:26] word that it is a real
[1:30:29] thing although they only was his
[1:30:32] attributes to begin with but if God said
[1:30:35] in this day back in the beginning John
[1:30:38] Doe will be my servant millions of years
[1:30:40] ago now John Doe is born in sin shap in
[1:30:43] iniquity coming into the world speaking
[1:30:45] lies because he's mortal but maybe he
[1:30:48] gets a little religious feeling he'll go
[1:30:52] join a church maybe he'll He he'll join
[1:30:54] the Pentecostal Church don't know he
[1:30:57] might join anything but let him get
[1:31:01] under the atmosphere of
[1:31:03] God just once see John Doe is bound to
[1:31:08] recognize who his father
[1:31:11] is just as that ego recognized who his
[1:31:14] mother was amen it's got to recognize it
[1:31:17] see only that John Doe is God's
[1:31:20] attribute that's right that's become a
[1:31:23] word spoken and then the Holy Spirit
[1:31:27] seeks that word out here it is he calls
[1:31:30] them and gives them everlasting life and
[1:31:32] brings them into the presence of God
[1:31:34] which is God's word amen amen says look
[1:31:39] God had the same when he when he saw
[1:31:44] Jesus it was the finished work that God
[1:31:47] finished with Jesus when he said it is
[1:31:50] finished all all the plan was finished
[1:31:54] he's just speaking about that that
[1:31:58] God God is going to complete the work in
[1:32:01] us just like he completed in Jesus he's
[1:32:04] going to complete it in us and when the
[1:32:06] spirit of God comes upon you and you
[1:32:09] truly are one of God's attributes then
[1:32:12] he's uh that he's spoken of now if
[1:32:15] you're not he says you're wandering and
[1:32:19] frustrate and run here here and there
[1:32:23] and everything else and never come to
[1:32:26] the knowledge of the truth what a scary
[1:32:30] thing I don't want to be wandering I
[1:32:33] don't want to be
[1:32:34] floundering I want to know who I am I
[1:32:37] want to be in my position in my place he
[1:32:41] says if you are one of
[1:32:43] those uh the old things pass away right
[1:32:47] quick
[1:32:48] see if you're one of those attributes of
[1:32:52] God if you're one of those the old
[1:32:53] things are passed away right quick see
[1:32:57] and you become new and the Plan of
[1:32:59] Salvation is finished and then you're
[1:33:00] ready what to obey every word of God
[1:33:03] that is ever spoken to you I want to
[1:33:06] read that again then and your Plan of
[1:33:10] Salvation is
[1:33:11] finished you're ready to obey every word
[1:33:16] that God ever spoke to you see for
[1:33:20] you'll do it because you're submissive
[1:33:22] to his word amen amen you're you're
[1:33:25] getting ready you're adorning yourself
[1:33:28] for the
[1:33:29] wedding in the message
[1:33:32] influence brother R says the Bible said
[1:33:35] their Works do follow them that's right
[1:33:38] as the Holy Spirit told John on the the
[1:33:40] Revelation or in the aisle of piss thou
[1:33:43] must prophesy yet before Kings and
[1:33:45] Nations and people The Book of
[1:33:48] Revelations is still
[1:33:49] prophesying they rest from their labors
[1:33:52] but their Works follow them their
[1:33:55] influence that they had still follows
[1:33:58] them certainly it is but we can
[1:34:01] influence before we can influence we've
[1:34:04] got to recognize God we've got to be
[1:34:07] clean we've got to be humble we've got
[1:34:10] to get ourselves down and know just keep
[1:34:13] imagining and knowing how little you
[1:34:15] are wow you're nothing I'm nothing and
[1:34:21] none of us is nothing but he is all amen
[1:34:24] he is worthy of all praise oh lord of
[1:34:27] gor oh oh Lamb of God what we need is to
[1:34:32] get back to the temple we need to to go
[1:34:34] back to the altar of God and and to make
[1:34:36] an altar in our own
[1:34:38] Hearts where that we can surrender
[1:34:41] ourselves and then see the Lord God of
[1:34:44] hosts come in these last days and do
[1:34:47] what he did when he was here first and
[1:34:50] then you'll understand
[1:34:52] and cry woe is
[1:34:55] me amen and he says may we all come to
[1:34:59] the place of that Tabernacle where we
[1:35:01] can recognize ourselves unclean and live
[1:35:05] such a life that will influence others
[1:35:07] to the love of
[1:35:09] Christ
[1:35:11] what that ought to be our desire amen
[1:35:14] amen God is working in each one of us to
[1:35:16] make us completely
[1:35:18] new Jesus prayed in John chapter 17 he
[1:35:23] said that they all may be
[1:35:28] one when John saw the the New Jerusalem
[1:35:31] coming down he saw that the the
[1:35:34] Tabernacle was with man they became one
[1:35:38] and here Jesus before he goes he's he's
[1:35:41] praying as it were this last prayer with
[1:35:43] his disciples that they all may be one
[1:35:47] as thou father art in me and I in thee
[1:35:50] and they Also may be one in us that the
[1:35:53] world may believe that thou has sent me
[1:35:57] and the glory which thou gavest me I
[1:36:00] have given them that they may be one
[1:36:03] even as we are one i in them and thou in
[1:36:06] me and they uh that they may be made
[1:36:10] perfect in one notice all three verses
[1:36:13] say be one and that the world may know
[1:36:16] that thou has sent me and has loved them
[1:36:20] as thou has loved me think about that
[1:36:23] God loves you just as much as he loved
[1:36:26] Jesus
[1:36:28] Christ
[1:36:30] that's and Jesus was a great pattern for
[1:36:32] us he just he surrendered his
[1:36:36] life he didn't do anything unless the
[1:36:38] Lord showed him first and he he just
[1:36:40] became obedient now look now look we're
[1:36:42] all humans we all make mistakes but look
[1:36:44] it ought to be an example for us to
[1:36:46] start pressing towards amen amen God is
[1:36:49] making us one
[1:36:53] and he does that when we hear the word
[1:36:55] being preached and we're sincere about
[1:36:57] that word we sayl I want that I want to
[1:37:00] live that word lord it's it's that that
[1:37:02] that simple that quiet that real it's
[1:37:06] it's not always a bunch of Jumping Up
[1:37:09] and Shout because look this flesh
[1:37:10] doesn't want to crucify its
[1:37:12] flesh a lot of times when you know the
[1:37:14] jumping up and down and everything is
[1:37:17] when you're not thinking about
[1:37:19] crucifying your flesh
[1:37:22] and the spirit will fall on All Flesh
[1:37:25] right amen
[1:37:28] amen God is changing us to be one with
[1:37:32] him one in Hope one in Doctrine one in
[1:37:35] charity one in his just like he is in
[1:37:39] his
[1:37:40] image I I'll tell you this ought to be
[1:37:42] our goal for this year is to become just
[1:37:45] like Jesus to live for others I want to
[1:37:47] live I want to live for others more than
[1:37:50] I did this year amen amen I've been
[1:37:52] praying God help me help me to go out
[1:37:54] and do your work more my time is running
[1:38:00] out John said hereby perceive we the
[1:38:03] love of God because he laid down his
[1:38:06] life for us we ought to lay down our
[1:38:09] lives for the Brethren God help us to
[1:38:13] set our our factions on on things above
[1:38:15] and don't don't let this world get our
[1:38:19] attention because uh it'll us till the
[1:38:22] Rapture comes I don't want to be I don't
[1:38:24] want to be I don't want to miss it I I
[1:38:27] want to be
[1:38:29] ready and I I the only way I know that
[1:38:32] I'm ready is at this moment I'm giving
[1:38:34] My All to Jesus this moment that's the
[1:38:36] only way I know I'm
[1:38:38] ready I I hope you catch what I'm saying
[1:38:41] amen don't rely on something yesterday
[1:38:44] don't think you got tomorrow but right
[1:38:47] now give your all then you know you're
[1:38:49] ready right now amen
[1:38:52] we're not going to always feel like
[1:38:55] we're
[1:38:56] ready but we've got to believe that he's
[1:38:59] going to finish the work that he started
[1:39:01] in us that's what the Bible
[1:39:03] says he's going to make All Things New
[1:39:06] in our life let's Stand Together he's
[1:39:08] going to as we receive the word he's
[1:39:10] going to add a little here add a little
[1:39:13] there things are become new in your life
[1:39:15] I say every week we should see a change
[1:39:17] in our life may not be major as as we
[1:39:21] would
[1:39:22] think but we need to see a
[1:39:25] change because each week we hear the
[1:39:27] word and the word changes us and I know
[1:39:30] sometimes you know it don't happen real
[1:39:33] quick so you receive the word you
[1:39:35] receive the the seed you you Ponder on
[1:39:37] it you pray about it you you start
[1:39:39] saying God let it come to pass in my
[1:39:41] life and you see it down the road I
[1:39:43] understand that but you ought to be
[1:39:45] seeing Saint things happening for the
[1:39:47] same thing that happened two months ago
[1:39:51] right you understand that every week we
[1:39:53] need to be seeing a change we need to
[1:39:54] hold oursel accountable if we're not
[1:39:56] seeing the change that we' like to be
[1:39:58] seeing then then call on God God God's
[1:40:01] wanting us to spend time calling on him
[1:40:03] and saying God make this thing real to
[1:40:04] me we don't want to miss it for anything
[1:40:07] don't want to miss it for
[1:40:09] anything and you know my prayer because
[1:40:12] I know that in myself I I I'm
[1:40:15] insufficient I know that God is able to
[1:40:18] use this office to get us ready I know
[1:40:20] that but in myself I'm just saying I
[1:40:22] feel so insufficient and this is one
[1:40:25] strong reason I believe in a fivefold
[1:40:27] Ministry because I don't want us to miss
[1:40:31] it but I do believe this that no matter
[1:40:35] what vessel is standing
[1:40:37] here if you're his attribute God will
[1:40:40] use that vessel to get you what you need
[1:40:42] to get ready so our confidence is not in
[1:40:45] our s our confidence is not in our
[1:40:48] ability our confidence is in God but we
[1:40:50] must get dressed in the word we must
[1:40:52] become this new Tabernacle not wait for
[1:40:56] it to to come down as if you know he's
[1:40:58] preparing it in our hearts amen I hope
[1:41:02] you got the message let's just look to
[1:41:04] him in a word of prayer our heavenly
[1:41:07] father
[1:41:09] Lord our dependency is upon
[1:41:12] you we thank you for your precious word
[1:41:19] today Lord that you have showed all of
[1:41:23] us that it is the only thing that we can
[1:41:24] put our trust in it's the only thing
[1:41:28] that is true and Lord we have found
[1:41:31] precious promises in your word
[1:41:35] that Lord that you're going to see us
[1:41:37] through that you're going to finish the
[1:41:39] work that you're you're not going to
[1:41:41] leave us behind you didn't start a a
[1:41:43] work in us just just to to to let it sit
[1:41:47] aside but
[1:41:49] Lord
[1:41:52] we're the only ones that can get in the
[1:41:53] way of the work that you're trying to do
[1:41:56] father as we come to a close in this 20
[1:42:03] 23
[1:42:05] Lord I pray for your grace in our life I
[1:42:09] pray that you would give each and every
[1:42:13] one of us a greater portion of your Holy
[1:42:16] Spirit in the year to
[1:42:18] come Lord that we would be able to see
[1:42:22] your word unfold more and more in our
[1:42:25] life and that our hunger and our thirst
[1:42:29] uh for adorning you would grow in 2024
