read two scriptures and have you be seated i want to um welcome brother bruce and sister donovak amen amen thank the lord that he watched over them and their travels and my my my brother jordan is with family god bless you and we have a visitor here with us today god bless our visitor good to see brother stand back amen good to see mr amanda amen it's just good to be together with god's family amen let's bow our heart and the word of prayer heavenly father we're unworthy lord to be in your house unworthy to be in your presence we may not feel it like isaiah felt it the lord we want to we want to be that close to you do we feel so unworthy to be in your presence today father unworthy to read your word and worthy to have understanding and certainly unworthy to have the revelation of your word we ask today humbly that you'd come and bless us with revelation of your word today message that you have for us ask that we could leave this service today closer to you than when we came commit service in your hands and trust that you bless each scripture now to our hearts in the precious name of jesus christ we pray amen romans chapter 4 verse number 11 and 12 the scripture says that he receiveth the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet been uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that their righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had been yet uncircumcised amen god bless you may be seated we want to title this message steps of faith steps of faith um before we go that we had some pictures we wanted to show this is brother boaz sent these to us this this morning and just today he baptized five people amen and so i just wanted to share with you what he shared with us i know that you're giving for the cause there in india and it's just good to know that there are others all over the world pressing on amen bring jesus amen we appreciate brother boaz yes what a wonderful wonderful pictures amen let's continue to hold him up he sends his greetings to the church we certainly like that song that was sung today higher ground i believe that's what we need to be pressing into amen our faith must not be in any other thing but the pure word of god amen when you hear from god that true faith will simply allow you a place to rest right you're not up and down amen god can't lie brother branham said faith's final resting place is in the word of god amen and so it's important when god for god to speak to us if god doesn't speak to us we can't have faith in it our faith only goes so far in the word of god how many people read this that we know this to be the truth and when people read it yet they can't believe it right so it's not just saying this is true but it's having that word spoken to you amen to where it becomes a place where you can rest in it yourself now with each step of faith that we take in god's word god will pour out a greater blessing so our subject today we want to speak on blessings for believing entitled this steps of faith there are steps of faith that every believer must walk notice this walk is not a walk on the sidewalk i like to view it today as a as a stairway now whether you you you view it in in a walk on a sidewalk or a ladder it really doesn't matter because you you're you're moving forward that's the main thing but the reason i want to look at it as a ladder is because it's you're it's it's harder it's harder to go up number one and number two as you uh as you're following the lord um it gets harder as you go up the statue of a perfect man everybody's got faith down here but as you move up that perfect love there's only a few that have it right it's so it's it just becomes harder and um if if i could say it like this brother branham makes the statement says god is not obligated to give you any more until you walk in the light that he's already given you that's right amen it's important to understand steps of faith and that you got to take him in order um when you jumped out of bed today the next step you took was not into the sanctuary you had to walk certain steps to get in your car and then your car drove here and you got to get out of part lot and then you came in here it's no different where the lord is taking us jesus said how can you be faithful in the few in the things of god if you haven't been faithful in another man's things so we have to learn to be faithful and take the steps that he's placed in front of us before he'll give us more peter said in second peter chapter one verse five he said besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge and to your knowledge add temperance it's an emphasis add patience and to patients add godliness notice it's an addie this is supposed to be being added to our life and godliness to brotherly kindness into brotherly kindness ad charity amen so you're you're adding you're you're moving forward you're taking a step of faith each time for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shouldn't need to be barren or unfruitful that means no matter what situation comes up the god inside of you meets it meets the need amen amen you're not lacking you're not you're not bearing you're not unfruitful you don't you don't know what to do or how to un handle it but you're trusting in the living god and he just shines through you but he that lacketh these things is blind cannot see a fire off and is forgotten that he was even perched from his own sins so we don't ever want to be unfruitful if we lack these steps spiritually we won't be able to handle things so we want to take these steps we don't want to leave any out there are steps to a christian walk brother ram taught us justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost these are steps brother brandon went on to say that the baptism of the holy ghost made way for the holy ghost himself to come and live in us peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost so we see here there's there's steps that need to be taken amen there are steps of faith that every believer must walk we must learn to be faithful to what god has asked us to do before trying to do something else i think there's a big problem with that we just kind of ignore certain things that god tells us and we try to go on with other things in our life and we're going to end up coming short god is a master builder he's know what he's doing and if he put something in front of us he wants us to move forward in it amen we look at the steps of faith that our our father abraham took they weren't easy they weren't easy by no means and it took a long time from the time that he got called out to the time he offered isaac i mean there's a lot of years there right it was over 30 years yes but we look at it as a story that just happened in i don't want to say minutes but we think about the story in minutes and we think well you know that's not a big deal it happened no but it happened such a long trial in this man's life see we're not alone with what we're going through he started absolutely 100 correct but did you know he wasn't perfected until the end that's what the scriptures tell us because god is expecting more out of us he wants us to continue taking steps not the steps that we haven't taken are not right not saying that but there's more amen some believers start to feel like they've graduated from the altar come on like i'm beyond that point don't ever get beyond the point of the altar right amen the first step that abraham took was when he was called out he had to separate from his natural family in genesis chapter 12 verse 1 i want to start reading now the lord had said unto abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i was shelby now notice everything that happened in abraham's life in the natural is a type of what happens to us in the spiritual our land is not natural our land is the nature of jesus christ and it's filled with the giants of selfishness and look he says i will make you a great nation and i will bless thee and i'll make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and i'll curse them that curse thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed both i'll say it like this natural and spiritual so abraham departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and abraham was 75 75 years old when he had departed of haren and abram took sarah's wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that were they had gotten in heron and they went for to go into the land of canaan into the land of canaan they came so they heard god's voice god spoke to them the first thing god says come out of the world separate yourself from the world separate yourself from from anything that's that's worldly it's the first step that every believer has to take if you want to walk with god you got to separate yourself from the world now notice abraham didn't have somebody to go to and ask him what do you think do i need to do this can i still make it with god without doing this no he heard from god in his heart and he just obeyed it this is the first step we got to do and i'll say it like this no matter how much we've come out of the world there's still more of the world that god's trying to get out of us and even if he's taken all of it out at one time satan has a way of letting it slip back in so he started walking in the direction of the promised land or up the ladder towards the promise of god however you want to say it by faith we must separate and how we separate is we become obedient to what he has spoken you can't just say i believe and don't do nothing you can't sit there he couldn't sit there back in in his land where he was and say you know i believe god he spoke to me if you believe you will obey amen you'll take that step of faith even though you don't feel like it you don't want to leave your family you don't want to do the you you just like the comfortableness of where you're at you've got to walk by faith you got to take that step and and you you do that by the work of obedience the bible says in isaiah 55 verse 8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my ways your way saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways they're higher than your ways and my thoughts and your thoughts it wasn't like abraham was just like in a chaotic condition and he had problems with all his family he didn't get along with anybody and he couldn't wait to get out of there anyways it wasn't like that right he was very happy where he was but there was something calling him higher god's way of thinking is always higher for us and if it's higher of course we're not going to understand it our understanding is limited it goes so far and that's it so what do we need understanding for when we got faith when you've truly heard from god what do we need understanding for can you imagine uh noah saying no way never seen rain ain't doing it nope what i need to build an art for it's going to sit here it's going to be they're just going to make fun of me you don't need understanding if you got faith if you heard from god you have no problem doing what god tells you to do it's only when you don't hear from god and it becomes some letter some written letter amen hebrews chapter 11 verse 8 by faith abraham when he was called out into a place which he should afterwards receive for an adherence he obeyed so he got by faith he heard from god and then he obeyed and he went out look at this not knowing whether he went he didn't even know and i'll tell you brother sister when i came in this message i didn't know nothing about it but something inside of me told me to walk in it it's what establishes our life takes out all the guesswork it was many years before abraham had received the promise and really in part in part he didn't he wasn't able to experience all of it himself so i want to say to you don't expect god to make a great name out of you in a couple years abraham never saw this great nation amen or his name become great he didn't see all the families of the earth blessed he never seen all the blessings that god bestowed on others that blessed him he didn't see all the curses that uh that uh god put on others for cursing him yet it was his promise and he stepped out by faith and he obeyed what god told him to do there were many steps that abraham took as he sojourned he went through many things in his life he went through many lands and trials and famines and difficulties and each step he took he had to take it by faith he stepped out in obedience and that obedience brought another blessing a greater blessing to him there are many steps that we as christians must take god doesn't want us getting ahead of ourselves or ahead of his leading he wants us to be faithful with what he just told us to do what he just placed in front of us don't ignore it don't forget about it don't dissect the word don't question what's being preached i'll say amen to that not that i believe that uh my preaching is perfect but the problem is either we believe or where god told us to be or we don't right amen if you start dissecting one thing you start questioning one thing you start doubting one thing then you know what it just opens the door every time you come to church we need to learn to walk each step faithfully be ready for the next step that god gives you i i feel that i would be totally lost if i was in a church that i had to question the leadership of the church i think god has something better for his people i think god has something better for his people no wonder brother brian says make sure you choose your church not like you chose your wife in other words be more sure about it how can we be more sure about the wife we chose because when we chose our wife we thought this is it you can't choose a church like this like i think this is it you've got to know that you know that you know that you know well brother john i just don't know we'll spend some time with god you're here if you really want to hear you will hear there were many tests that abraham went through and each test that he passed proved he had faith yes if you don't pass the test it doesn't prove you have faith he was faithful to do what god god asked him to do now there came a time in abraham's walk with god that in order to get any closer to god to walk any further into god any higher with god he was told that he had to separate from the very family member that he came out of the world with yes think about that it wasn't an option abraham i need you to consider you know either or with lot it was a must amen god allowed there to be a family strife in genesis chapter 13 verse 8 and abram said unto lot let there be no strife yes i love the spirit of abraham he endeavored to keep the unity of the spirit let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee between my herman and i a herven for we be brethren yes amen amen brethren amen that's abraham's view even though lot was a mate believer abraham still conducted his spirit as a believer verse 9 is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if you take the left then i'll go to the right if you depart to the right then i'll go to the left he didn't manipulate the situation amen he trusted in god right amen you know a lot of times god gives us a choice what we're going to do with what we're given and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plane of jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom and gomor even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou cometh unto zorah that must have been a beautiful land like the garden of the lord the garden of eden this has been beautiful then lot chose him all the plane of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves one from the other lot chose for himself all the plain easy way amen no hills no valleys plenty of easy water to get to for his camels and always all that he was taking care of so he wouldn't have to work hard easy labors remember when god gives you a choice never choose the easy way never never never choose the easy way god's way is and always will be the harder way amen don't don't just i'm gonna hop in church i'm gonna expect everybody else to labor to get the atmosphere right you be the one to work for it amen you want god to bless you you labor amen matthew chapter 7 verse 13 says enter ye in at the straight gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there be which go on there at because strait is the gate jesus told us under the straight gate strait is the gate and narrows the way which lead unto life and few be that find it why won't they find it because most believers are looking for god the easiest possible way the way of least resistance they're still looking still wanting but they're looking the broad way i love the example that the prophet laid out i say for me i take it personally it was really for the whole bride us i'm taking it from me he shared it in the true easter seal this is what god said to him he said because thou has chosen the narrow path the harder way thou has walked of your own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way that is not what law lot chose he had a choice he wasn't manipulated he could have chose god's way but he chose the easier path brother man says bless god it's my way he said because of this momentous decision a huge part of heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision thou has made this in itself is that which will give and may come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine right now notice choosing the harder way brings you to the pentacle of love divine think about that statement it's true it all depends on what our goal was let's go was not that pentacle a perfect love amen he was just glued on what was easy for right now but there's harder way that brother branham trolls this is the exact same thing that happened abraham he took the steps of faith the harder way but it brought about the greater blessing now this is important because all of us when we come to church we hear the word and it may not be what we want to hear it may not be what we're praying for it may not be what we're interested in but i'm telling you god is giving us a step amen and if you make it as important to you as it is to god god will bless you for it we come to church we want a smorgasbord right we want to eat what we want to eat we want to leave what we but this isn't a catholic church we're not coming to get a slice we want all that god has for us now if you end up taking the easier way you're going to end up pitching your preaching towards the easier life now i'm not talking to the preachers when they make the statement but all of us preach all of us are preaching to somebody something what we think about the word amen and if you start pitching your tent towards the easier way you're going to actually start developing that same type of communication amen verse 12 abraham dwelled in the place that god led him the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the place that his flesh led him the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward sodom now he wasn't quite in the world yet but it eventually grew around him it consumed him it got so bad even his righteous soul was vexed every day the bible says amen because he chose the easier path amen he he he didn't take the step that god told him to take right so don't pitch your ideas towards the easier way don't pitch your life towards riches i mean riches are not cut out all that the devil makes him to be in luke chapter 18 verse 24 when jesus saw a man reject the offer to follow him he said how hardly shall the they that have riches enter into the kingdom right amen jesus says riches choke out the word of god in believers and that they actually become unfruitful one time they were fruitful and they become unfruitful first timothy 6 9 says but they that will be rich they that will be rich in a fall fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition now we're looking spiritually for the love of money is the root of all evil i wonder what's going on in the world right now what's behind it the love of money somewhere the love of money which while some coveted after they have erred from the steps of faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows we don't want to air from taking a step of faith amen genesis chapter 13 verse 13 genesis 13 verse 13 but when the men of sodom were but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly and the lord said unto abram after notice i want you to catch this word after he spoke again to him after that lot was separated from him he said now lift up your eyes look from the place where thou art northward southward eastward the westward for all the land which thou see us to thee i will give it until thy seed forever and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so it cannot be numbered so if amen can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered now arise walk through the land in the length of it and the breath of it for i will give it on to thee i think god wants us to get up and look at the promises of god look at the nature of god and start walking in love start walking in joy start walking in peace start walking in gentleness claim it don't sit there and wait till god gives you walk in it wherever the souls of your feet that have i've given you right now i've given you it you've got to walk in it by faith walk in the nature of god walk into steaming others better than yourself walk walking helping others walking laying down your life more amen because this is where the greater blessings come amen sodom had grew right around lot and one of those arrows had pierced him from what i understand he became the mayor he just pitched toward at the beginning and he said you know this is not so bad i don't want to become the mayor of this place i'm i'm i'm pretty you know righteous and you know they'll look up to me and i'll make a great name for myself genesis 14 verse 11 you know what happened there was a a war that took place it was like a world war there were many different kings that came together and it was kings on one side kings nations on the other side and they came together and they basically took over sodom and they took verse 11 genesis 14 and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrh and the rituals and they went their way and they took a lot amen abraham's brother's son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed and there came one of them that escaped and told abraham abram the hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of marie verse 14 and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued after them well that would have been a little drop in the bucket yes it would have been a little drop in the bucket compared to who he was going after and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued uh them onto uh hoba which is on the left hand of damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother love and uh and his goods and the women also and the people isn't that beautiful abraham went after his fallen brother right amen amen a mate believer who decided to go and live part way in the world right but see lot meta lost the vision but abraham never lost the vision right he's still a godly spirit with a godly burden that cared now it isn't like at that point lot said you know what i'm done with this i want to get out of this sodom hey what happened but he still wanted to help him yes see the spirit of christ in abraham amen that's what we need amen that's what we long for we're not gonna he didn't change a lot you can't change lot it took 100 lots to make one abraham you can't change people right you can only present to them the world and if they eat it they take it they recognize i am a seed of god they will become the word of god amen too often we're trying to make something that you can't go in that garden and try to take any vegetable make it different than what it is you can't do it every seed will bring forth of its kind amen it's a step of faith that we want to take to help those that are falling around us it takes faith to do it i mean abraham only had three a little over 300 guys and he goes what's all these kings that's faith yes real faith you need faith to go help somebody yes amen you can't just say well i don't know what to say you know they're not gonna listen you know they're too big there's too many there's greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world but it's got to be real got to be real abraham was a predestinated seed of god he was elected he was a real believer he didn't stagger at the promises of god through unbelief and he was blessed beyond measure but because he obeyed the steps that god told him to take you know god is real simple he's not complex you don't got to try to figure him out you don't got to be some sort of a mathematician some scholar you you don't got to be a know-it-all you got to be i love you all so all you got to be is i love you i'm serious about this relationship and i'll tell you if you do that god will show you what to do but lot he was the type of the make-believer he believed in god but he didn't choose to walk all the way with god now this is important because everybody in every church is tempted by the devil to only walk part way with god i don't care how long we've been serving them the devil's constantly trying to say you've gone far enough you're okay only thing you need to do now is just grow in knowledge head knowledge you know what i'm saying nothing to do about that's not the right step of faith if i could say it like this lot was a part-time believer he was a half-way believer that's why i call him a mate believer he had convinced his family of an easier life and you know what they followed him they stayed with him think about what i'm saying without a vision the family will perish we need a vision amen we need a vision for our family we need a vision for our church we need a vision for those that are lost a vision god's vision the bible says that abram believed in the lord he believed in god's promise and was counted unto abram's faith for righteousness because he believed i i believe if if we went up to lot we said lot do you believe in god of course i do of course i believe i'm a believer i walked with abraham i prospered like he prospered but he didn't continue to believe on the new things that god told him to do he began to choose the easier way of living galatians chapter 3 verse 6 says even as abraham believed god and it was accounted him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of faith that's you and i the same are the children of abraham and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all the nations be blessed so then they which are faith are blessed with faithful abraham we are our blessed people a peculiar people but we're a holy nation we are blessed of god the world may despise us but we've got a nature inside of us that keeps us happy when the bottom falls out amen amen we must remember that no matter how long we've been with god or accounted for us for righteousness the spiritual seed of god is promised to complete the nature change in other words we got to remember what the ultimate ultimate goal is it's not to be saved it's to become like christ it's to have the nature of christ it's to be able to lay down our life like christ laid down his life just because abraham was righteous he was not perfected yet right it's a very important statement it was years after abraham believed that god said unto him before it was accounted on his righteousness it was years after that that god said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be perfect be perfect now if you're doing everything that god has told you to do praise god amen if you're not start doing it amen and as soon as you do it be ready because he's going to be showing you something more that's the god we serve we serve that kind of god we do not serve a god that says all you have to do is repent be baptized and you know boom you go on with your life no god wants preeminence in her life he wants control of our life god did not want abraham to stop taking steps of faith he wanted abraham to continue taking steps until he manifested listen to this perfect love we could say well god knows everything he knows why does god put us through testing trials why did of the father of our faith went how many years number one without hearing from god i think the prophet said about 15. and then he had to wait around what is it 25 years for his son and then his son grew and got to that age and then he had this is the father of our faith right amen and we're supposed to walk in the same steps he did amen expect similar trials expect going through things that our father went through what type of believer today who is righteous but ought to be pressing onto perfection the nature change every believer needs to be pressing towards the nature change to where you can look at any time in the past week and say you know what i handle every situation just like jesus if we can't do that we need to be pressing amen not just saying well you know i'll never get there you know we all make mistakes with that how much are you going to try amen i say to the bride let us go to perfection jesus said be ye perfect even as my father in heaven is perfect i believe it's the desire of god this morning in this church that we move forward amen take take steps of faith towards perfection amen now when we're when we take these steps of faith what we're really doing is taking steps of obedience because it's not easy to have faith it's not i mean just look at every trial that we've been through and we're wanting god to move and god says i'm waiting to have faith first amen so faith is it's not easy but but god calls us to wait upon him amen they that wait upon the lord they'll renew their strength amen we don't walk by reasoning we cast it down we don't want by understanding we don't walk by sight we don't everything don't have to be perfect and the outside we just got to be connected with god connected with them look what happened to abraham when he leaned to his own understanding his own reasoning we all know the story a false seed came a hybrid seed even though abraham was a child of god the seed that came forth was not of god's will i'm speaking of ishmael i'm speaking of hagar and abraham are you with me do you believe that can you say amen don't make me stop because i got too much stuff and i don't want to be real alone today why wasn't it god's will because it was a natural seed it was a mixed seed it wasn't a spiritual seed of faith it was mixed with the idea with the lower thoughts of man now no matter how much abraham loved him because he loved him he said all that ishmael may live that he may be the one he had to separate from him this is important because it wasn't god to start with if you just follow it through he had to separate from them we don't got time to go i'll tell you when i looked at the start of these steps of faith i thought we could take a month and just go through all the steps of abraham there was a lot of them even though we are children of god when we mix our own reasoning with the word our lives will become a hybrid hybrid christianity hybrid message believer hybrid nature of god amen instead of a real believer no matter how much our flesh enjoys compromising we need to separate from all unbelief this is a perfect type of the believer who starts out in the spirit but he tries to perfect himself in the flesh and if we had time we could go in the book of galatians that's what happened to them they started in the spirit and they wanted to try to get perfected with all themselves without god being in control and we're very tempted to do that because you know it's easier to read the bible than it is to pray it's easier to sit in the prayer room say your prayers than it is to labor to get into the spirit it's easier to do the do's and don'ts to try to say you know i'm perfected than just pressing into it galatians chapter 4 verse 28 now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh what did he do persecuted him that was born after the spirit yes amen and notice even so it is now that's right if you notice the carnal believers will always persecute the spiritual believers but not the other way around amen so if you're a true believer be careful what you say about others nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman a and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free amen if you take the word from cover to cover this message from cover to cover you're walking in all the truth that god has given you that to me is the evidence of you are a seed of abraham amen but you begin to dissect and pick and choose and lay this aside all you're doing is show me your children of the bondwoman there's got to be some sort of scripture to tell me where i stand if i really want to know who i am how to get to heaven there's got to be something to tell me a carnal believer will be blessed naturally as long as he follows instructions he will be there's a prosperity message that some believers really gravitate to that they can benefit from naturally like if you do this you know god's gonna bless you but you can't compare those blessings with the blessings that you get from being a spiritual believer it goes way beyond the natural amen to where god comes inside and he's in control and you know it and you rest in peace you got to go all the way with god ishmael is a good example of this god told abraham in genesis chapter 21 verse 13. he said and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation because he is thy seed yes naturally he's the seed of abraham naturally after hagar and her son ishmael were kicked out and they went to the wilderness they felt doomed they were at a place where i didn't know what was going to happen i mean it it looked like ishmael was going to die and and hagar was pleading out to god and in genesis 21 verse 17 and the angel of god called hagar out of heaven and said unto her what a with thee hagar fear not for god have heard the voice of the lad where he is arise lift up the lad and hold him in thy hand for i will make him a great nation amen just like he told abraham for isaac verse 20 and god was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and he became an archer so god was with them and out of ishmael there came a great nation but it was a carnal nation lots of money lots of oil lots of riches but they were always fighting handling situations with anger strife confusion there's never been peace with them not even to this day they just don't know how to love because they're of a natural seed god still blessed them but the blessing was natural amen i'll tell you saints of god we don't want just the natural blessings of god we're here today for the spiritual blessings of god amen amen you got to keep focus on that genesis 25 16 he said these are the sons of ishmael and these are their names by their towns by their castles twelve princes according to their nations yes they are nations god made the he told hagar a promise and he kept his promise they became a great nation notice 12 patriarchs spiritual 12 princes amen carnal to this day they are the seed of abraham but it's the carnal seed of abraham and when that seed met up with jesus when he walked the earth that same seed persecuted jesus wanted to kill him well we're of our father abraham i know you are but if you were of that spiritual seed you wouldn't seek to kill me you wouldn't seek that so it just shows you're of the natural seed and he went on to say of the devil think about it we're interested in the word of god amen we're interested in obeying god's voice we're interested in making sure that i'm holding myself accountable to my brother my sister you know you can go all you want and say well it's none of your business it's between me and god that's fine you can do that but i need all the help i can get when it comes to christianity or this message it's no different brother brandon said there's always twins twin believers god will bless you if you only go part way with him and we see that in ishmael if you only take part of his word it doesn't mean god's not going to bless you he may bless you but if you take all the word you will be blessed beyond measure you won't be able to measure it amen because it goes much deeper than the outside amendment only the true seed of god will take all of god's word with them only the true seed because it's when you take god's word you're going to suffer and nobody likes to suffer it's not it's not the broad way i mean look at every everybody this whole world is going down the broadway like a running running for it it takes faith to walk each step higher with the word amen that's what we're supposed to be doing until we become manifested the whole world amen genesis chapter 22 verse 1. are you getting something out of this excuse me genesis chapter 2 verse 1. see i'm always once in a while i should say i'm waiting for those pages to turn but you know we got this up here and pages don't turn and i don't got no time to sit in my water genesis chapter 22 verse 1. this is what happened later later on abraham's life it came to pass that after these things that god did tempt i'll say it like this test abraham because god don't tempt anybody but he tested abraham many many many years and said unto abraham and he said unto him abraham and he said behold i am here the best thing to do when god gets your attention say i'm here i'm paying attention i'm listening amen and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of mora and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took of his young men with him and isaac his son enclaved the wood of the burnt offerings and rose up and went unto the place of which uh of which god had told him then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off and abraham said unto these young men i want you to abide here with the asses and i in the land will go yonder and and worship and come again to you now you have to it has to be real between you and god for this to happen it has to be real it can't be just a pretense it can't be just coming to church it can't even just be paying ties and offerings it has to be a real relationship this is think about you think after abraham had to wait 25 years for the son waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting brother brandon say to sarah do you feel anything yet not a thing well keep knitting those booties because he's coming and here had to he went through the trial of that long trial thought about is uh the only one that he had in his house was a servant god said no it's going to come through your loins and then that trial with hagar that was a fiasco and finally isaac comes and he surrenders this is the one circumcised them grew up they began to bond this is the one that's going to bring forth the father of many children and through him was going to come and now god was approaching him and saying give him back to me now we know the end of the story but he didn't a lot of times we go through tests and trials we don't know the end of the story what do we have to have when we don't know the end of the story we need to have faith and it's hard to get to that step of faith if you want to ignore all the other ones the past 30 years steps of faith are important what he went through was important before david got goliath he took that bear he took that lion amen we need to walk the steps of faith don't belittle what you're going through god's god's doing something amen god's taking us through he wants to see a nature change let's say you got everything that you could possibly want in life what would be next more of god right more of god let's just bypass the world and just to go after god more time going after god it'll be worth it all it'll be worth it all abraham had faith he didn't have feeling didn't emotion he didn't even tell everybody uh didn't didn't he the way that he expressed he was going up making some offerings even tell the family you know didn't even tell home before he left i don't know where that scripture is right now so i can't quote it but it's like you're just gonna go up make sacrifices but inside of him he knew he had that relationship with god it was so real what god was telling him to do and it wasn't easy this is what i'm trying to say when god speaks to us don't expect it to be real easy but you obey the word it's so important to obey it don't let it go and notice he went the lad they were going to go yonder what they're going to do boohoo and cry about what they were going through no way worship amen and when we're done we're coming back and abraham took the wood and the burnt offerings and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand in the knife and they went both of them together right isaac didn't know what was going on here isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire the wood but where is the lamb for the burnt offering what a comfort father abraham said to a son my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they both so they went both i'm sorry they went both of them together it really didn't look like abraham was doubting or questioning or murmuring or or dies acting does it i think the scripture tells us he staggered not at the promises of god through unbelief he was strong in faith giving praise worship you know when you know you're in god's will just worship yes amen worship what happened to david when he knew his son wasn't coming back he worshipped he would have changed it if he could but he couldn't so he knew he was in god's will what did he do worship amen just worship god he inhabits the praises of his people amen these steps of faith are not easy that's true verse 9 they came to the place where god had told them of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wooden and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood so i don't know it doesn't really tell you know what happened at this point but i'm sure it was getting intense and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i amen and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now i know that thou fearest god for now i know you mean you didn't know before god isn't going to know until we obey him god will not accept the knowing until we obey him he knows everything but he's not going to accept it now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou as not withheld thy son thy only son for me and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there was a ram caught in the thicket by the horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and abraham called the place jehovah jair god will provide yes god will provide whatever you need is god will provide amen as it is said today in the mountain of the lord it is it shall be seen and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time this is after he obeyed and he said by myself there is nobody greater i have sworn saith the lord for because thou has done this thing because you obeyed me that's right and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing i'm going to bless you and in multiplying i'm going to multiply you thy seed as the stars of the heaven as the sandwiches upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy who's our enemy certainly satan is but who else is irony our neighbor well wait a minute just i'm my wife my husband well wait a minute who's our enemy brother said our greatest memory is our self now if we just let our flesh do what it wants it always gets us in trouble doesn't it amen so we've got to possess the gates of the enemy the promise is for us that we can have such a holy ghost inside of us that it will possess those gates it will control our tongue it will control our thoughts it'll control our affection it'll control everything about us because the spiritual the seed the true seed of abraham is the spiritual seed of idol god that was not a promise to ishmael it wasn't it was a promise to isaac and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice god naturally blessed ishmael greatly but he blessed isaac beyond measure beyond measure so i'll tell you today what what what blessings do you want do you want the now blessings you want the ones that right now bless me naturally or do you want the ones that's going to take you through it's through if we just watch these steps of abraham god told him what to do he said here's the next step you take by faith you have to take that step yes got to offer them up i'll offer them up through that obedience yes god will bless you amen now i know you fierce me because you've done this thing i'm going to bless you greatly with blessing i'm going to bless you how's that happen brother john well wednesday we heard we really received a blessing from god wednesday what did any time god gives us his word it's a blessing so he gave us his word about tithes and offerings now that's a blessing spiritually not not physically not naturally but spiritually it's a blessing now when you take that blessing and you obey it then he multiplies it in blessing i will bless you it's through obedience to that that god really pours out his blessings so i i want i want i want to get to a place where god just overfills me with spiritual blessings in blessing i will bless thee god is a blesser he wants to bless his people he even blesses his enemies he's going to bless his enemies i can expect him to bless me the word blessing is often noted as god's favor or protection brother did say it one time he said the greatest thing he could say to somebody is god bless you some people don't understand that and they use the word in so many different faucet facets it's almost like a greeting god bless you god bless you sometimes people feel like they got something in their flesh yes god bless you or oh yeah god has really blessed me but when we say god bless you what we're doing is we're invoking god we're calling on god to god bless this person and that's the way we need to think about it when we say it that we're really invoking god to bless this person and when you do that that is the greatest thing you can say and anything short of that is short of the greatest thing you can say we hear a lot about the the blessings and the beatitudes where jesus said blessed are the poor blessed are the me blessed are the merciful but in order to get that blessing you have to step out by faith and do something right blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy so you want mercy you got to learn to be merciful now at one time we didn't do anything to deserve god's mercy right we were all in sin and he came and he was merciful to us but after a while he expects us to be able to forgive others if we're going to get god's forgiveness so when we want the blessings of god we've got to go through we've got to by faith do the harder thing this is what i'm trying to tell you we don't we don't believe in a prosperity message where you do nothing and get everything we don't it's not scriptural to me the fact that you have to be merciful to others and forgive others shows you have to work you don't work you don't eat you have a part to play for the blessings of god in blessing i will bless thee we can't continue to expect blessings without doing what the lord wants us to do amen now i'm just about done can you hold out a little bit if you can't say step down brother john we all want a closer walk with god we want to find more favor more protection more blessings don't you want a higher walk we have to follow the steps of abraham the ones he took amen each step of faith leads us to become obedient and in doing more what god has asked us to do if you live another year believe me god's going to expect more out of you in that year than he does today what do we do take it down to if you live another month he's going to expect more i'm just saying get your mind made up of growing acts chapter 20 verse 33 i want to show you how you can be blessed more that's what i want to show you this is kind of like the the saving the best for last type of thing you know what i'm saying acts chapter 20 verse 33 i have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel i haven't asked for anybody's tie and it's for their silver or their gold paul is speaking here ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and not only to my necessities but to them that were with me and i have showed you all things how that soul laboring you ought to support the weak and to remember the words of our lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive abraham was blessed to receive isaac but he was more blessed when he gave isaac back to god but it was a greater sacrifice amen we're blessed when we receive things homie was blessed at christmas and i'll tell you you didn't act like that when you were getting your presents so i can tell you who wouldn't be thrilled to get a 500 gift card from amazon in here we'd all be excited our our our mind we would be thinking about what we're going to do with it our lips would be talking about uh showing a thankfulness and appreciation to the person who gave it to us because we receive something we and and we can do something with what was given to us we would be blessed and we would be appreciative about it to a degree right but what's more blessed than that we don't realize we would be more blessed if you gave up your time you work extra hours you sacrificed and you got a gift card and you gave it to somebody now you would be more blessed don't seem like it to the flesh it's more blessed to give than to receive receiving a gift is easy to give one is much harder it's why people turn down the greater blessing because it's harder to give we don't want to give out of abundance no sacrifice there look at the little woman the widow the widow woman in church they took up an offering she gave more than everybody because she gave all i believe she was more blessed than all are you with me we need to start taking these steps of faith don't ask what this church can do for you rather ask yourself what should you be doing for the church it's more blessed to give than to receive romans chapter four verse one real quick this is uh romans chapter 4 verse 1 through 3 and what shall we say then that abraham our faith as pertaining to the flesh have found for if abraham were justified by works he would have to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god has accounted unto him for righteousness so these scriptures are telling us here that abraham was not justified by works and he wasn't but this is what i want to say to make it real clear you can have works without faith but it is impossible to have faith without works james chapter of james chapter 2 verse 20. remember that statement if you want to get an understanding of the proper order of of works and faith faith comes first then you work now tell you what you can't have faith and be justified before god until you do the works he'll give you so much time verse 20 but will thou o vain man will thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works when when when at the beginning no he believed at the beginning it was accounted unto him for righteousness at the beginning but he was justified by the works that god expected him to do afterwards when he offered isaac his son upon the altar amen seeing thou how faith had wrought his work faith brought about the works and by works was faith made perfect hallelujah amen there are steps of faith god is leading us to perfection to a perfect faith to meet a rapture we need perfect faith to make the rapture brother brandon says it lies in the tapes we need to spend more time hunting for it come on we got to start taking these steps if we're gonna make if we're gonna have faith for the rapture door it's it's no longer i know it's true i i believe it's for me but god's gonna find out because the whole though i'm telling you you don't have to be the message there's people that believe in the rapture amen it's not just saying i believe in the rapture we can't do that we got to follow the steps amen what is god expecting me to do amen all i'm trying to do is provoke you just start walking up with god we've been called to something the bride has been called to something greater than the lukewarm believer amen it's a different message to her it's a higher myth stand with me do you know the bible says that we are blessed when we read the word the bible says that we're blessed when we hear the word that's right but did you know the bible says that we're more blessed when we obey the word yes amen remember when they came to jesus this woman these i guess those women said blessed is the woman that took care of you when you were a baby and jesus said yea rather blessed are they that hear the word and keep it keep it abraham kept the word god didn't allow him to kill isaac but he kept the word amen and that's what made his faith perfect is following through with what he said he believed god's gonna try us we're gonna we're gonna be more tried than what we are have been going through it's gonna get worse but god ain't gonna let anything happen to us hallelujah he's not he's going to take care of us but it's so important that when we come to church and we hear the word of god walk in it follow it go home and say lord help me to do this word don't come with the picky choosy thing get rid of that come with the seriousness with god amen that that you're serious about walking the steps of faith like abraham did amen let's bow our hearts in a word of prayer look to him and this time every head bowed maybe my wife could just play a little little something don't you just look at yourself for just a moment ask yourself this question are you walking faithfully in those steps of your father abraham have we skipped any have we set any aside have you ignored some have you tried to make it without taking the next step even though we're here together as a family god deals with us as individuals this is between you and the lord it may not be a popular message i see perhaps most of mine or not but i believe it's god's message i believe it's the truth i believe god is calling us higher i want you to resolve in your heart your relationship with the lord these steps the days to come the preaching that you were here the tapes you'll listen to when god speaks to you just say yes lord i'll walk in it i want to prove my faith to you i believe with all your heart now as we go to him in prayer our heavenly father we need you we need you when we look at abraham in the years that he seemed like his whole life was one trial after another one long trial gone through so many things the lord you made him the father of our faith lord i know that you're calling us to take those same steps here lord
