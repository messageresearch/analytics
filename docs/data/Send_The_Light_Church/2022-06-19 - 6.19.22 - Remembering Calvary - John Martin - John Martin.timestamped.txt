[36:57] and
[36:59] if
[37:00] our fathers are not living
[37:04] we certainly have respect for fathers
[37:09] and
[37:13] we can be a father to everyone
[37:18] i remember being raised by a single
[37:20] parent that was my father
[37:22] he had to be my mother
[37:24] and my father
[37:25] sometimes we have to fill the gap and
[37:30] today for
[37:32] thinking about our heavenly father
[37:34] for our father's day message we want to
[37:37] uh
[37:38] have a subject of remembering calvary
[37:40] because
[37:41] he
[37:43] he is everything to us he's our father
[37:46] our mother our sister our brother
[37:48] and uh
[37:50] we want to honor him today
[37:54] this is our communion service we haven't
[37:57] had one in such
[37:59] uh a long time
[38:01] uh i would say
[38:03] we could always
[38:05] put put that
[38:07] on me
[38:09] but it
[38:12] should be more often than what we've
[38:13] been having that i will say
[38:16] um
[38:18] and
[38:19] the house should be full
[38:21] i want to say that as well
[38:24] um but
[38:26] that's those of us that are here
[38:29] um
[38:31] i believe god is very pleased with that
[38:34] amen
[38:35] let's look to him in prayer and then
[38:37] we'll begin
[38:39] with our opening scripture in john
[38:42] father as we approach you at this
[38:45] time
[38:47] we're certainly grateful for what you've
[38:49] done for us at calvary
[38:52] lord for if that had not transpired
[38:56] or we wouldn't be here with the same
[39:00] desire that we have today
[39:03] there'd be some false
[39:05] pretense of just trying to make it in
[39:07] our works but we know that

[40:24] and we're going to start with verse
[40:25] number 14
[40:33] through
[40:34] 23.
[40:40] this great day
[40:42] of calvary and it
[40:44] was the preparation the passover in
[40:46] about the sixth hour and the sick
[40:49] he and he saith unto the jews behold
[40:52] your king
[40:54] but they cried out
[40:55] away with him away with him crucify him
[40:59] but pilate saith unto them shall i
[41:01] crucify your king
[41:03] and the chief priest answered we have no
[41:06] king
[41:07] but caesar
[41:09] oh my my the decision that they made
[41:12] there
[41:14] then delivered he him therefore unto
[41:18] them to be crucified
[41:20] and they took jesus and led them away
[41:24] and he burying his cross went forth
[41:27] into a place called
[41:30] the place of the skull which is called
[41:32] in the hebrew golgotha
[41:35] where they crucified him and two others
[41:37] with him
[41:39] on either side one
[41:41] and jesus in the midst and pilate wrote
[41:44] a title and put it on the cross
[41:48] and the right the writing was jesus of
[41:50] nazareth the king of the jews
[41:53] this title then
[41:55] read many
[41:57] of the jews for the place where jesus
[41:59] was crucified was nigh to the city and
[42:02] it was written in hebrew in the greek
[42:04] and also latin
[42:06] then said the chief priests of the jews
[42:08] to pilate
[42:09] right not the king of the jews but that
[42:12] he said i am
[42:14] the king of the jews
[42:16] oh
[42:17] my
[42:18] just a constant belittling
[42:21] of the king of glory
[42:23] pilate answered
[42:24] what have i what i've written
[42:26] i have written
[42:28] then the soldiers when they had
[42:31] crucified jesus took his garments and
[42:34] made four parts to every soldier a part
[42:37] and also his coat now the coat was
[42:40] without seam woven from the top
[42:42] throughout they said therefore among
[42:45] themselves let us not rend it but cast
[42:48] lots for it
[42:50] uh whose it shall be
[42:52] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[42:54] would say if they parted
[42:56] my
[42:56] garment among them and
[42:59] for my vesture they did cast lots
[43:02] these things therefore the soldiers did
[43:04] now
[43:05] there stood by the cross
[43:09] of jesus's mother and his mother sister
[43:12] mary and the wife of cleopas and mary
[43:15] magdalene and when jesus therefore saw
[43:17] the mother
[43:18] and his disciples standing by whom he
[43:21] loved he saith unto his mother woman
[43:23] behold thy son
[43:25] and then he said to his disciple behold
[43:27] thy mother and from that
[43:29] hour the disciple took
[43:31] and
[43:32] took her onto his own
[43:35] amen god bless you may be seated so he
[43:37] can see here jesus is teaching that we
[43:40] need to continue on helping one another
[43:43] whatever
[43:45] whatever we can do
[43:51] i
[43:52] am am i allowed to just take one little
[43:55] break
[43:58] i keep forgetting
[44:00] but
[44:01] our little brother james chanult
[44:03] has a baptismal certificate and
[44:07] i want
[44:08] all of us to just give our little
[44:10] brother a hand clapping
[44:12] he was baptized
[44:14] in january 10th of 2021 and so we want
[44:18] him to come and get this and finally
[44:21] we know that this doesn't mean
[44:23] everything but i love the idea that it's
[44:26] you know could be hanging up or
[44:27] somewhere you could look that can always
[44:29] remind you
[44:30] amen god bless you
[44:33] what
[44:33] it's the greatest decision we can make
[44:35] is a decision for jesus christ
[44:38] amen
[44:40] well we got this little sign behind us
[44:42] here and it says golgotha
[44:44] is
[44:46] 5993 miles from fenton
[44:50] and brother
[44:51] roger rodriguez got this for us
[44:54] the first time he came to visit us but
[44:57] it was at that distance that jesus died
[45:01] for us
[45:02] at that location
[45:05] something transpired there
[45:07] for you and i
[45:10] and
[45:11] we are blessed today because of the love
[45:14] that he had for us and
[45:16] as we go through the service today we
[45:18] just we want to reflect on the lord we
[45:20] want to reflect on
[45:22] what he did for us
[45:25] isaiah chapter 53
[45:28] says he
[45:29] is despised and rejected of man a man of
[45:32] sorrows
[45:34] acquainted with grief
[45:37] and we hid it as it were faces from him
[45:39] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[45:44] surely he had borne
[45:46] our grease think about that
[45:50] 5993 miles away
[45:53] and he
[45:54] and carried our sorrows
[45:57] yet we did esteem him straight string
[46:00] smitten of god and afflicted
[46:04] but he was wounded for our transgression
[46:06] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[46:08] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[46:11] and with his tribes we are healed
[46:15] jesus did this for us
[46:18] they might have
[46:20] mocked him
[46:21] they they might have thought they were
[46:23] in control of crucifying him
[46:26] but jesus made it real clear
[46:28] that no man takes my life but i give it
[46:32] if he wouldn't have gave it freely we
[46:34] would not be saved today
[46:38] so it was through the giving the
[46:40] suffering
[46:43] the pain that he went through it was for
[46:45] you and i
[46:47] the scripture says in verse 6 all we
[46:49] like sheep have gone astray
[46:52] we have turned everyone to his own way
[46:54] and the lord
[46:56] had laid upon him the iniquity of us all
[47:00] so before we really came to christ we
[47:03] were just doing our own thing
[47:05] going our own way didn't even care about
[47:07] the lord
[47:08] and i'll tell you it is such an evil
[47:12] spirit to have upon us that after we
[47:14] come to the lord we still want to do our
[47:16] own thing
[47:17] still want to go our own way
[47:20] we need
[47:21] a greater
[47:23] experience with god something that holds
[47:26] us to him because that's the way it was
[47:28] meant to be
[47:30] he was oppressed
[47:32] and he was afflicted
[47:34] yet he opened down his mouth
[47:37] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[47:39] and his sheep before this shears is dumb
[47:42] so he opened not
[47:44] his mouth
[47:49] now
[47:50] imagine if you're suffering and you open
[47:52] your mouth
[47:56] there's a good chance
[47:57] you're going to express something
[47:59] negative a murmur
[48:02] like shouldn't be not fair
[48:05] but
[48:06] jesus didn't want any of that
[48:09] he kept his mouth closed
[48:13] he didn't yield to the feeling of what
[48:16] was fear but he committed himself to the
[48:18] father amen
[48:20] he was taken from prison and from
[48:22] judgment who shall declare his
[48:23] generation for he was cut off at the
[48:26] land of the living for the
[48:27] transgressions of my people was he
[48:29] stricken
[48:30] and he made his grave with the wicked
[48:32] and with the rich his death
[48:34] because he had done no violence neither
[48:36] was deceit
[48:38] was there any deceit in his mouth
[48:41] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him
[48:45] he put him to grief
[48:47] when thou shall make his soul an
[48:50] offering for sin
[48:52] he shall see his seed and he shall
[48:54] prolong his days and the pleasure of the
[48:56] lord shall prosper in his hands
[49:00] jesus died
[49:02] for us in our condition
[49:05] in the worst possible condition
[49:08] we didn't know god we didn't care about
[49:10] god we didn't want nothing to do with
[49:12] god in fact i remember the time that i
[49:15] was being
[49:16] i would be introduced to the lord
[49:19] i didn't want nothing to do with god i
[49:21] didn't want to give up my will
[49:24] i was very happy in the driver's seat
[49:27] doing what i wanted to do but the more
[49:30] that i learned that without him i will
[49:34] utterly be lost
[49:36] the more that i paid attention to what
[49:38] had to be said
[49:41] he became sin
[49:46] that we could be set free
[49:50] he became
[49:52] everything
[49:54] that we were collectively the sin of the
[49:57] whole world
[49:58] was upon him
[50:00] he didn't leave some out he didn't leave
[50:03] some of your sin out
[50:06] he didn't leave some of the people out
[50:09] he died for the sin of the whole world
[50:13] that's why
[50:15] if you have a heart
[50:19] to
[50:20] to repent a heart that believes
[50:24] in god's grace
[50:27] there is no sin that god will not
[50:29] forgive today
[50:34] now we're not going to talk about
[50:35] blaspheming the holy ghost
[50:40] that
[50:42] jesus said that that won't be forgiven
[50:48] but too often
[50:50] the devil tricks us
[50:52] gets us to a place where we think what
[50:54] does it matter because i did this thing
[50:56] in the past
[50:58] and we need to take a stand and
[51:00] and confess that god's blood is stronger
[51:04] than our sins
[51:06] is stronger than our unbelief
[51:09] and that if he could forgive us
[51:13] um
[51:15] for the sin that we've done in the past
[51:16] and the the evil nature that we were
[51:19] born with how much more is god going to
[51:22] see us through
[51:24] we got to stay under the blood and keep
[51:26] under the blood and and that's why we
[51:29] got to remember calvary
[51:31] he became us that we could become him
[51:34] and we're in that process of doing that
[51:37] we don't believe it happens by burning
[51:40] candles or or by giving money to the
[51:42] church or doing good works it happens in
[51:45] a process of when god speaks to you you
[51:49] obey his commandments and some
[51:51] supernatural things transpire in life we
[51:54] become more in his image mourn his
[51:56] likeness
[51:57] it's the hard way it's there's no easy
[51:59] magical thing about this it's a
[52:01] relationship
[52:05] god himself paid the debt
[52:07] of our sinful nature
[52:10] the one that we were born with
[52:12] all because of the unbelief that eve had
[52:15] in the garden
[52:18] romans 5 verse 19 says for as by one
[52:21] man's disobedient
[52:23] many were made sinners
[52:26] so by the obedience of one shall many be
[52:29] made righteous
[52:35] now when eve did it
[52:39] it was just a repercussion
[52:41] that sin had entered into the world and
[52:43] everybody that was born was born in sin
[52:47] now when jesus became the supreme
[52:50] sacrifice for the world
[52:53] that doesn't happen automatically
[52:57] right it doesn't there has to be a
[53:00] turnaround a a repentance an
[53:02] acknowledging of sin uh uh i want to to
[53:06] to to oh to do the will of god i want to
[53:09] be born again there has to be that
[53:11] transpiring in order for for us to
[53:14] become the righteousness of god to take
[53:16] on the righteousness of god
[53:19] and there's there's too much thinking
[53:21] that well eve did what she did called we
[53:23] did god did what you know he did not
[53:26] work now we're just automatically going
[53:27] to heaven and it's not the truth
[53:32] calvary was the fulfillment of the law
[53:36] james chapter 2 verse 8 says if he
[53:38] fulfilled the royal law according to the
[53:41] scripture thou shall love thy neighbor
[53:44] as thyself
[53:46] you do well this is exactly what jesus
[53:49] did for us at calvary
[53:51] he fulfilled
[53:53] the law
[53:55] now we heard
[53:56] the law said the day you eat there is
[53:59] the day you'll die
[54:02] but there was a part of
[54:05] god
[54:06] that had never been yet manifested
[54:09] and it was the giving of self for
[54:11] somebody else
[54:13] and this is what calvary is all about
[54:16] and this is what communion
[54:19] service is all about
[54:21] verse 9 but if you have respect to
[54:24] persons
[54:26] you commit sin
[54:28] and are convinced of the law as
[54:30] transgressors now notice this jesus died
[54:33] for the whole world no respect to
[54:34] persons
[54:37] but if we
[54:38] respect one person
[54:41] more than another person
[54:47] we're i'm being called a transgressor
[54:52] this is what puts me in a spot not
[54:55] worthy
[54:56] for communion
[54:58] this one
[55:00] thing
[55:03] it's not well i didn't pay my tithes
[55:06] it's not
[55:07] i haven't been faithful reading my bible
[55:10] or faithful listening to the tapes or i
[55:14] how has your spirit and your attitude
[55:18] been because the scripture says if i
[55:21] have respect to persons i'm not
[55:23] fulfilling
[55:24] the law
[55:26] the royal law
[55:28] there's other laws but you're not
[55:30] fulfilling the royal law i'm really not
[55:33] loving a person
[55:35] like myself
[55:37] i can never ever have an excuse of not
[55:41] to respect somebody
[55:45] in my humble opinion this moment in time
[55:49] called calvary
[55:51] is where the most incredible act
[55:54] was ever manifested
[55:57] the most incredible act was ever
[56:00] manifested when we look at god's
[56:03] creation
[56:04] and his creative power that he made the
[56:06] mountains and all the animals and we
[56:09] really stand in awe of god's creation
[56:13] but when we look at the power of god's
[56:15] love to forgive
[56:17] to redeem and to bring man back then we
[56:21] see the greatest manifestation of god
[56:29] we think it may not be that big a deal
[56:31] but it's a big deal try loving somebody
[56:34] that you don't feel is worthy
[56:45] yes god created the whole world and and
[56:48] the beauty and we the whole world is in
[56:51] awe of god's creation
[56:55] but if it had not been for calvary man
[56:58] would never know the greatest love
[57:04] this act of calvary was so dynamic it is
[57:08] what changed our life
[57:11] because of that now god can come and
[57:14] live inside of us and we can love others
[57:17] brother branham went so far as saying
[57:19] what lies within you is a creative power
[57:22] that you could create a world and go
[57:23] live on it
[57:25] if it was just us standing and looking
[57:27] at the the animals and the nature and
[57:30] the things that god created that still
[57:32] wouldn't be in us
[57:36] so i want you to stand in awe today of
[57:38] calvary
[57:41] i want you to
[57:42] remember what jesus did for you
[57:46] in the message love
[57:48] brother brandon said and the reason i
[57:50] chose this tonight is because my theme
[57:53] has always been love
[57:57] i think love is the most powerful force
[58:00] that the world has
[58:03] because god is love
[58:05] and there's no more powerful force
[58:08] than god
[58:10] for god so loved the world that he gave
[58:14] his only begotten son
[58:18] now it wasn't just the birth
[58:20] because imagine him being born but never
[58:23] dying
[58:26] he
[58:27] it was that death that brought us
[58:30] victory
[58:32] because that death paid the penalty of
[58:36] our sin not just our past sin but our
[58:38] present sin today not just our present
[58:41] sin but the sins that we will commit
[58:45] calvary needs to be just as exciting and
[58:48] real to us as it ever was
[58:50] and we need to wake up tomorrow thanking
[58:52] god for calvary that's right amen
[58:55] everything centers around calvary amen
[58:59] right in the middle of the chaos that
[59:01] satan caused in the garden
[59:04] god's great love prophesied a way back
[59:07] in genesis 3 15.
[59:10] right in the middle of the chaos
[59:13] god or putting things back in order and
[59:16] trying to
[59:17] straighten things out he said i will put
[59:19] enmity between thee and the woman and
[59:22] between thy seed and her seed and it
[59:24] shall bruise thy head and thou shall
[59:26] bruise his heel
[59:28] god
[59:29] from the foundation in the world was
[59:31] preparing a way for you and i and
[59:34] nothing was going to stand in the way of
[59:36] it
[59:39] genesis 22 verse 8 here's abraham
[59:42] speaking of calvary and abraham said my
[59:44] son god will provide himself a lamb for
[59:47] a burnt offering
[59:50] so they both of them
[59:52] so they went both of them together god
[59:54] will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[59:58] offering
[1:00:01] jesus said in matthew 20 verse 18
[1:00:04] behold we go to jerusalem and the son of
[1:00:06] man shall be betrayed and chief priests
[1:00:08] and the scribes and they shall condemn
[1:00:11] him to death everything was centering
[1:00:13] around calvary
[1:00:16] and shall deliver him to the gentiles to
[1:00:18] mock
[1:00:19] to scourge and to crucify him and the
[1:00:22] third day shall rise again
[1:00:25] even after his resurrection
[1:00:29] jesus talking to his two disciples in
[1:00:31] luke 24 25 we have a lot of scriptures
[1:00:34] today i hope that's okay with you
[1:00:36] then jesus said unto them oh fools and
[1:00:39] slow of heart to believe all that the
[1:00:40] prophets have spoken ought not christ to
[1:00:43] have suffered these things and to enter
[1:00:46] into his glory
[1:00:47] everything evolves around calvary
[1:00:52] and beginning at moses and all the
[1:00:55] prophets he expounded unto them and all
[1:00:58] the scriptures the things concerning
[1:01:02] himself
[1:01:04] himself
[1:01:06] acts chapter 2 verse 22 ye men of israel
[1:01:10] hear these words
[1:01:12] jesus of nazareth a man approved to god
[1:01:14] among you by miracles and wonders and
[1:01:17] signs which god did by him in the midst
[1:01:20] of you as you
[1:01:22] yourselves also know
[1:01:24] him being delivered by the determined
[1:01:28] determinate counsel and the
[1:01:30] foreknowledge of god
[1:01:32] you have taken and by wicked hands you
[1:01:35] have crucified and slain
[1:01:38] whom god are raised up having lose the
[1:01:41] pains of death because it is impossible
[1:01:43] that he should be holding of it
[1:01:47] you can't kill god
[1:01:50] you can't kill god's love
[1:01:52] you can shun it you can run from it
[1:01:56] you can try to make it one-sided
[1:01:59] but god's love will always prevail
[1:02:03] god's love will be throughout eternity
[1:02:06] there's never going to be a day in
[1:02:07] heaven where you won't see the love of
[1:02:09] god
[1:02:10] judgment day you will see the love of
[1:02:12] god
[1:02:14] his bride will be sitting with them
[1:02:16] on
[1:02:17] the judgment seat
[1:02:19] that's that means there's somebody that
[1:02:21] loved god when they had a chance and
[1:02:23] those that are not there did not move
[1:02:25] forward in loving god when they had a
[1:02:27] chance
[1:02:29] the love of god will always be
[1:02:31] manifested
[1:02:32] you wake up in the morning that's the
[1:02:34] love of god
[1:02:36] you want to do something for somebody
[1:02:37] that's a love of god
[1:02:41] calvary was a mystery to the world
[1:02:44] even even to lucifer
[1:02:48] first corinthians 2 8 says which none of
[1:02:51] the princes of this world knew for had
[1:02:53] they had known it
[1:02:55] they
[1:02:56] would not have crucified the lord of
[1:03:00] glory
[1:03:01] they thought
[1:03:03] they
[1:03:04] were going to do away
[1:03:06] with the son of god but what they did is
[1:03:09] open the door for you and me to come in
[1:03:15] god knows what he's doing
[1:03:19] we may think things can get out of
[1:03:21] control we may think things are not
[1:03:23] right but this world is completely going
[1:03:26] insane
[1:03:29] but god is still in control
[1:03:33] first peter chapter 1 verse 18
[1:03:36] for as much as you know that you were
[1:03:38] not redeemed with corruptible things as
[1:03:40] silver
[1:03:41] and a gold from your vain conversation
[1:03:44] received by the tradition of your
[1:03:46] fathers
[1:03:48] wow
[1:03:49] how many times have we thought well i go
[1:03:51] to this church
[1:03:54] i take the communion
[1:03:57] i go in the confessional box
[1:03:59] i did my catechism
[1:04:02] i acknowledge
[1:04:04] this
[1:04:06] this
[1:04:07] uh
[1:04:08] priest
[1:04:09] this
[1:04:10] minister as
[1:04:12] the one
[1:04:13] to
[1:04:15] speak to me the word of god
[1:04:19] traditions
[1:04:20] because that's the way i was raised
[1:04:24] and when i left that to go searching for
[1:04:26] another
[1:04:29] i wouldn't be satisfied until i found
[1:04:31] him
[1:04:34] now we
[1:04:36] were not redeemed
[1:04:39] by naturally going through the motions
[1:04:42] of things
[1:04:44] but with the precious blood of christ
[1:04:49] as a lamb without blemish and without
[1:04:51] spot and i'll just say this
[1:04:55] we could pour the literal blood of jesus
[1:04:58] christ upon us we could drink the
[1:05:00] literal blood of jesus christ and it
[1:05:03] would not change our nature
[1:05:06] but the spirit that was in that blood if
[1:05:09] it comes upon the conscious in the heart
[1:05:12] of man
[1:05:13] something changes within them
[1:05:17] this is why we need to believe in the
[1:05:19] blood
[1:05:20] when we come to church and we sing those
[1:05:22] songs
[1:05:23] i had like three songs written down that
[1:05:25] we were going to sing at the church and
[1:05:27] i i guess i should ask brother ron what
[1:05:29] songs he's singing because he's saying
[1:05:31] all of them
[1:05:36] who verily was
[1:05:38] foreordained before the foundation of
[1:05:40] the world
[1:05:41] but was manifest
[1:05:43] in these last times for you
[1:05:46] who by him do believe in god that raised
[1:05:48] him from the dead and gave him glory
[1:05:50] that your faith and hope might be in god
[1:05:53] seeing you have
[1:05:55] seen ye have purified your souls how do
[1:05:57] i do that how do i get clean
[1:06:00] in obeying
[1:06:02] the truth
[1:06:04] through the spirit
[1:06:06] unto
[1:06:08] unfain
[1:06:10] love
[1:06:12] of who
[1:06:13] the brethren
[1:06:15] see that you love one another
[1:06:18] with a pure heart
[1:06:21] fervently now that's a lot of words to
[1:06:24] put in one verse
[1:06:26] that talks about
[1:06:28] purifying your soul
[1:06:30] purifying your soul has a lot to do with
[1:06:33] you loving
[1:06:34] your brother
[1:06:40] everything points to calvary
[1:06:44] brother john johnson brought to us
[1:06:46] exodus chapter 12.
[1:06:50] god spoke to moses to take a land to
[1:06:53] kill it
[1:06:55] take of the blood and strike it on the
[1:06:57] two disciples then the upper door post
[1:06:59] of the house where they
[1:07:02] shall eat it
[1:07:04] so here back in exodus
[1:07:07] was pointing to calvary
[1:07:10] isn't that beautiful i just love what
[1:07:13] was brought out exodus chapter 12 read
[1:07:15] about four verses with me start with
[1:07:17] verse 11 and thou shall eat it
[1:07:20] with your loins girded your shoes on
[1:07:22] your feet your staff in your hand and
[1:07:24] you shall eat it with haste it is the
[1:07:25] lord's passover this
[1:07:28] this this coming to church is is not
[1:07:31] something to be some lazy boy sit back
[1:07:34] and it doesn't matter
[1:07:36] as long as you make it this should be a
[1:07:38] place of reverence and respect and i'll
[1:07:40] tell you if you're doing it in your
[1:07:42] homes you have no problem doing it in
[1:07:45] church
[1:07:46] for i will pass through the land of
[1:07:48] egypt this night and smite all the
[1:07:50] firstborn in the land of egypt both man
[1:07:52] and beast and against all the gods of
[1:07:54] egypt i will execute judgment i am the
[1:07:57] lord so god is going to judge the entire
[1:08:00] world every man-made religion every
[1:08:02] man-made will everybody's saying i'm
[1:08:05] going to do what i want to do i'm going
[1:08:06] to come to church when i want i'm not
[1:08:07] going to come when i don't want and
[1:08:08] nothing matters god is going to judge
[1:08:11] that
[1:08:18] brother he is our brother he's our king
[1:08:20] jesus said the queen of sheba will raise
[1:08:23] up
[1:08:24] in this generation and condemn
[1:08:27] the generation
[1:08:29] because of what she did
[1:08:32] do we believe enough
[1:08:34] to come to church faithfully
[1:08:36] do we or do we just believe in the gifts
[1:08:40] of god
[1:08:43] this place ought to be packed
[1:08:50] and the blood shall be
[1:08:52] to you
[1:08:54] for a token
[1:08:56] upon the houses where you are and when i
[1:08:58] see the blood i'll pass over you and the
[1:09:01] plague shall not be unto you to destroy
[1:09:02] you when i smite the land of egypt
[1:09:05] i want you to think about this brother
[1:09:07] branham said our tolkien was the spirit
[1:09:13] of god's blood
[1:09:15] that was shed at calvary
[1:09:18] and that when it comes
[1:09:19] into us
[1:09:21] then
[1:09:23] the
[1:09:24] spiritual death angel passes over us
[1:09:30] when god lives in you it's no longer you
[1:09:36] now it's christ in you
[1:09:39] and the death angel can destroy anything
[1:09:42] but what is it of god
[1:09:45] it's that simple
[1:09:47] that's why we need to be pulsating
[1:09:50] living out breathing walking the holy
[1:09:53] ghost in our life it ain't just
[1:09:55] something we talk about at church or
[1:09:57] once in a while at home we need to
[1:10:00] to be living out the holy ghost
[1:10:05] and this shall and this day
[1:10:07] shall be unto you for a memorial
[1:10:10] and you shall keep it as a feast to the
[1:10:13] lord throughout your generations and you
[1:10:14] shall keep it a feast by an ordinance
[1:10:18] forever
[1:10:20] we're talking about communion here we're
[1:10:22] talking about remembering calvary
[1:10:25] that's what
[1:10:26] communion is all about
[1:10:28] it's remembering what jesus did for us
[1:10:31] it's remembering his suffering it's
[1:10:34] remembering he was broken for us
[1:10:36] that he
[1:10:38] he took our place
[1:10:41] as brother as you saying
[1:10:43] he paid a debt
[1:10:45] he did not owe
[1:10:47] i owed a debt i couldn't pay
[1:10:49] what was that that was love manifested
[1:10:52] that's what that was
[1:10:54] jesus tried to point his disciples to
[1:10:56] cow to calvary in john chapter 6 verse
[1:10:59] 53
[1:11:01] then said
[1:11:03] thence then jesus said unto them verily
[1:11:05] verily i say to you except you eat my
[1:11:08] eat the flesh of the son of man
[1:11:10] and drink his blood ye have no life in
[1:11:14] you
[1:11:17] now we're talking about the same thing
[1:11:18] here
[1:11:19] the same thing that we just read in
[1:11:21] exodus
[1:11:24] everything from exodus
[1:11:26] to calvary it pointed
[1:11:30] to jesus christ giving his life
[1:11:33] and here jesus is talking to his
[1:11:35] disciples
[1:11:37] to the 70 disciples if i could say it
[1:11:40] like that
[1:11:41] he said except you
[1:11:44] you accept me as the the offering
[1:11:48] for you you'll die in your sins and how
[1:11:50] you accept this offering is my spirit
[1:11:54] into you
[1:11:59] it ain't just something that's
[1:12:01] done far away
[1:12:04] it's something that's right here
[1:12:07] here inside of me that's why when you're
[1:12:09] sharing jesus christ with somebody
[1:12:12] today it's afresh it's just as real as
[1:12:16] the day that he was crucified because it
[1:12:19] needs to be that way to that person and
[1:12:21] it needs to be the same way to us when
[1:12:23] we're sharing it
[1:12:28] now we're told that they couldn't
[1:12:30] stomach eating all the word
[1:12:33] and drinking the holy spirit like a lot
[1:12:35] of people
[1:12:36] they can't take the whole word
[1:12:38] they can't take the holy the whole the
[1:12:41] holy spirit they they don't mind spirits
[1:12:44] they just don't want the holy one
[1:12:48] in john chapter 6 verse 66 and from that
[1:12:52] time many of them many of his disciples
[1:12:55] went back and they walked no more with
[1:12:57] him
[1:12:59] think about that how many people have
[1:13:01] come for a while and they decide
[1:13:04] to walk away
[1:13:07] now the thing is
[1:13:08] i don't think any of those disciples i
[1:13:10] don't think anybody that walks away ever
[1:13:13] thinks they're leaving god
[1:13:16] they don't ever think that or they never
[1:13:17] would
[1:13:18] the devil has got them to think that
[1:13:21] they could still serve god their own way
[1:13:26] but the bottom line is when you walk
[1:13:27] away from
[1:13:29] the obedience of this word you're
[1:13:31] walking away from jesus christ
[1:13:34] the same thing the children of israel
[1:13:36] did they they walked with jesus for 40
[1:13:38] years
[1:13:40] jesus was amongst them their shoes and
[1:13:42] were out they they had healings among
[1:13:45] them
[1:13:46] but they didn't continue to walk with
[1:13:48] the word
[1:13:50] and and and we know how god felt about
[1:13:53] them
[1:13:54] now look at verse 67 then said jesus
[1:13:56] unto the twelve will you also go away
[1:14:00] you're you're my disciples too are you
[1:14:03] going to go away like them
[1:14:08] then simon peter answered lord to whom
[1:14:10] shall we go thou
[1:14:11] has the words of eternal life
[1:14:14] nope peter may have not been able to say
[1:14:19] i have a complete revelation
[1:14:21] on eating your flesh and drinking your
[1:14:23] blood
[1:14:25] but he knew what he said was the truth
[1:14:28] and it's okay maybe not to understand
[1:14:31] everything but it is not okay not to say
[1:14:35] amen
[1:14:36] you've got to say amen to the word
[1:14:38] you've got to believe the word you've
[1:14:40] got to take in the word
[1:14:43] you don't have to wait to understand it
[1:14:44] to say amen
[1:14:47] you wait till you believe it
[1:14:51] that's
[1:14:52] that's why brother man says the holy
[1:14:54] ghost says amen to every word because it
[1:14:57] wrote the word
[1:15:01] now peter didn't want
[1:15:03] jesus to go through this
[1:15:06] thing called
[1:15:08] calvary was his own disciple even
[1:15:11] jesus's own flesh
[1:15:13] didn't want to go through with it
[1:15:16] his flesh didn't want to go through with
[1:15:18] it
[1:15:18] so can i understand that sometimes
[1:15:22] we don't want to suffer for the lord
[1:15:24] sure i can
[1:15:27] but
[1:15:28] we must yield ourselves to god
[1:15:32] times we don't got to go we don't feel
[1:15:33] like going to church we still need to go
[1:15:35] to church
[1:15:37] we don't feel like praising god we don't
[1:15:40] feel like giving our lives more for god
[1:15:43] we still have to do it
[1:15:46] because he's worthy he went to calvary
[1:15:49] for us how could we not live for him
[1:15:53] how we ought to be the center of our
[1:15:55] lives
[1:15:57] what paul said in first corinthians
[1:15:59] chapter two verse two he says for i am
[1:16:01] determined not to know anything among
[1:16:03] you save jesus christ and him crucified
[1:16:08] that's it
[1:16:09] jesus christ and him crucified it is the
[1:16:12] center of paul's life
[1:16:15] it wasn't just a sunday wednesday thing
[1:16:17] or just some holidays or or just uh
[1:16:21] when we're talking about it
[1:16:23] on on good friday or east or something
[1:16:26] like that
[1:16:29] galatians chapter 2 verse 20 he says i
[1:16:32] am crucified with christ
[1:16:35] i am not i was
[1:16:38] i am i'm staying crucified with christ
[1:16:42] nevertheless i live yet not i
[1:16:46] but now it's christ with he lives
[1:16:48] in me
[1:16:49] and the life which i now live in the
[1:16:51] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[1:16:53] god who loved me
[1:16:55] there it is he loved me and he gave
[1:16:58] himself for me this is about what
[1:17:00] remembering calvary's about he loved you
[1:17:02] enough to die for you amen that's right
[1:17:06] calvary was the fulfillment of the law
[1:17:11] we knew one part the day you eat thereof
[1:17:14] is the day you'll die and it is the
[1:17:16] truth
[1:17:17] but there is a fulfillment to the law
[1:17:20] and that's the giving of yourself for
[1:17:22] another
[1:17:25] oh we need a revelation of that
[1:17:28] because god has put that same power
[1:17:30] within you it's his spirit living in you
[1:17:33] laying on your life for another person
[1:17:35] that's why one soul is worth ten
[1:17:38] thousand worlds
[1:17:39] just you laboring to bring one soul in
[1:17:42] is worth 10 000 of these planets with
[1:17:45] everything that we hold so dear to us
[1:17:51] god's divine love
[1:17:54] god never wants us to forget calvary
[1:17:57] nor to forget what it should produce in
[1:18:00] our lives
[1:18:03] i believe that the scars that jesus
[1:18:07] bore
[1:18:09] that were made
[1:18:11] at calvary
[1:18:13] are there today
[1:18:16] and will be an eternal witness
[1:18:18] for you and i to see
[1:18:21] now that's just what i believe
[1:18:25] i believe that's how much it means to
[1:18:27] him that we remember calvary
[1:18:31] when we look at them we'll be reminded
[1:18:34] of the god's greatest love
[1:18:37] that he died for us
[1:18:40] how often have we forgot
[1:18:42] something somebody did for us
[1:18:46] we forgot their their forgiveness we
[1:18:49] forgot their mercy we forgot their love
[1:18:51] we forgot the many things they did for
[1:18:54] us
[1:18:56] god don't want you to forget what he did
[1:18:59] for you
[1:19:03] amen
[1:19:04] remember when jesus approached thomas
[1:19:06] after he was risen
[1:19:09] thomas
[1:19:10] come here
[1:19:12] put your your finger
[1:19:14] in my hand
[1:19:16] put your hand in my side
[1:19:19] it was it was in a different body
[1:19:23] yet his finger was there
[1:19:28] his wound was still open
[1:19:31] do you believe that
[1:19:37] remember john crying
[1:19:40] when no one was worthy to open the book
[1:19:47] and
[1:19:49] so a voice said that weep not behold the
[1:19:52] lion of the tribe of juba the root of
[1:19:54] david he has prevailed to open the book
[1:19:56] and to loose the seven seals thereof
[1:20:00] and he said in revelations 5 6 and i
[1:20:02] beheld and lo in the midst of the throne
[1:20:05] the four beasts in the midst of the
[1:20:07] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[1:20:12] now you think about this if i
[1:20:14] you went out to the house and you saw
[1:20:17] we used to have sheep but now we got
[1:20:18] goats
[1:20:20] and when you look at the goats
[1:20:23] brother mark has looked at our goats
[1:20:25] more than anybody here
[1:20:27] outside of ann and cheryl
[1:20:31] because he has been so kind to help us
[1:20:33] with cleaning the stalls and
[1:20:35] taking care of them
[1:20:37] but if he had ever looked at one of
[1:20:39] those goats
[1:20:41] as it had been slain
[1:20:43] he would see the evidence of a slain
[1:20:47] goal
[1:20:49] it would there be blood there
[1:20:52] it would be
[1:20:53] limping dragging a leg something would
[1:20:55] be there indicating that it had been
[1:20:58] slain
[1:21:06] zechariah chapter 13 verse 6 and one
[1:21:09] shall say unto him what are these wounds
[1:21:12] in thy hands
[1:21:14] then he shall answer
[1:21:16] those
[1:21:17] with which i was wounded in the house of
[1:21:21] my friends
[1:21:25] i believe that god does never want us to
[1:21:28] forget what he done for us
[1:21:37] an eternal reminder
[1:21:39] reminds me of this story that
[1:21:42] someone gave and it might have been
[1:21:44] brother alex of course we've heard it
[1:21:46] many
[1:21:47] uh times
[1:21:51] about the
[1:21:53] the one
[1:21:54] uh girl who was so embarrassed with her
[1:21:58] mother because
[1:22:00] she just had this she looked gross on
[1:22:02] her face and it just was not a natural
[1:22:06] looking
[1:22:07] mother
[1:22:08] wasn't pretty at all to look at she was
[1:22:11] always
[1:22:12] embarrassed of the look and didn't want
[1:22:15] anybody to know that was her mother
[1:22:18] but then it was at the end that she
[1:22:20] realized that her mother went into the
[1:22:24] house when she was a baby
[1:22:26] and got burnt her old face was burnt but
[1:22:30] she saved her little girl's life
[1:22:35] i think god wants us to remember what he
[1:22:37] did for us
[1:22:39] that he went into the pits of hell and
[1:22:41] he paid the price he took away the keys
[1:22:43] of hell death in the grave for you and i
[1:22:47] yeah he's got scars
[1:22:49] but they're there to remind us of his
[1:22:51] love the love that he gave for us the
[1:22:54] love today that he has for us
[1:22:58] he never wants us to forget calvary
[1:23:00] that he suffered that he bled that he
[1:23:04] died paul was not in the upper room
[1:23:08] when jesus had the last supper with his
[1:23:12] twelve disciples
[1:23:14] but he still had a revelation of it do
[1:23:16] you believe that
[1:23:18] galatians one verse 12 says for i
[1:23:20] neither received it of man neither was i
[1:23:22] taught it but by the revelation of jesus
[1:23:25] christ
[1:23:26] this is such a
[1:23:27] a a
[1:23:29] fearful scripture to me
[1:23:31] because we come to church and the lazy
[1:23:34] way is to be taught by man
[1:23:37] sit there and listen to whatever the
[1:23:39] preacher's saying and try to be taught
[1:23:42] but it will do you no good to be taught
[1:23:44] by man you've got to be you've got it's
[1:23:46] got to be revealed to you by the holy
[1:23:49] ghost and that has everything to do with
[1:23:51] your heart preparation and your hunger
[1:23:53] to hear from god and looking beyond the
[1:23:56] veil whoever's talking
[1:23:58] amen
[1:24:01] first corinthians chapter 11 verse 23
[1:24:07] 5 received of the lord that which
[1:24:11] also i delivered unto you
[1:24:13] that the lord jesus the same night which
[1:24:16] he was betrayed he took bread
[1:24:19] and when he was and when he had given
[1:24:20] thanks he break it and said take eat
[1:24:23] this is my body
[1:24:25] which is broken for you
[1:24:28] this
[1:24:29] do what
[1:24:30] in remembrance
[1:24:32] in remembrance he wants us to remember
[1:24:36] the suffering how often we've come into
[1:24:38] church just so la da da de daddy doesn't
[1:24:41] matter doesn't matter if you're doesn't
[1:24:43] matter if you're a reverend nothing
[1:24:44] matters doesn't matter how you talk to
[1:24:46] anybody
[1:24:52] it was a serious moment for him
[1:24:56] in fact
[1:24:57] it was before the foundation the world
[1:24:59] he was thinking about it
[1:25:04] in fact it's part of his eternal purpose
[1:25:07] to get all his family together
[1:25:10] and
[1:25:11] calvary
[1:25:13] that suffering is what
[1:25:15] is the center of everything
[1:25:21] and he's bringing the words that jesus
[1:25:23] spoke when he's in the upper room
[1:25:25] take
[1:25:26] eat this body which is broken for you do
[1:25:29] this do in remembrance of me
[1:25:32] in the same manner also he took the cup
[1:25:34] and when he had stopped saying this cup
[1:25:36] is the new testament in my blood
[1:25:38] this do ye as often as you drink it in
[1:25:40] remembrance of me
[1:25:43] for as often as you eat
[1:25:45] this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:25:47] show the lord's death
[1:25:51] till i come
[1:25:56] god wants us
[1:25:58] to show the death
[1:26:00] he does
[1:26:02] and the best way that we can show it
[1:26:04] is actually when we're laying down our
[1:26:06] life for somebody that's 24 7. amen
[1:26:11] that's where you show the lord's death
[1:26:19] talk about it
[1:26:20] talk about what jesus did for you at
[1:26:23] home
[1:26:25] when you're in the car when you're at
[1:26:26] the dinner table
[1:26:28] when you're driving
[1:26:30] you know we can talk about a lot of
[1:26:32] things
[1:26:33] but i think he wants us to remember what
[1:26:36] he did for us
[1:26:39] you do show the lord's death till he
[1:26:43] comes
[1:26:44] in other words keep doing it
[1:26:47] god wants us to remember calvary his
[1:26:49] sufferings and his pains
[1:26:52] all that he went through just to save
[1:26:55] us
[1:26:57] hebrews chapter 2 verse 2 i just want to
[1:26:59] read this real quick before we go back
[1:27:01] looking unto jesus the author and the
[1:27:03] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:27:06] that was set before him he endured all
[1:27:09] that
[1:27:10] he had you and i in mind
[1:27:17] he was willing to die for you and i
[1:27:21] he despised
[1:27:23] the shame
[1:27:26] and is set down at the right hand of the
[1:27:29] throne of god wanting us to remember
[1:27:32] calvary
[1:27:36] despised it he didn't care
[1:27:39] what he had to go through the price that
[1:27:41] he had to pay sometimes if we you know
[1:27:44] this is the way sometimes that we act
[1:27:46] about reaching out to somebody we tell
[1:27:48] them something if they don't listen we
[1:27:50] quit
[1:27:51] but that ain't what jesus did for you
[1:27:54] that is not the attitude that jesus had
[1:27:56] for us
[1:27:58] he went all the way he gave all the way
[1:28:01] that's why his word says that we need to
[1:28:02] present our bodies a living sacrifice
[1:28:06] and to prove what is that
[1:28:08] acceptable and perfect will of god for
[1:28:10] our lives that good acceptable perfect
[1:28:12] will of god for our lives
[1:28:16] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:28:18] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:28:20] unworthily
[1:28:21] shall be guilty of the body and the
[1:28:24] blood of the lord how many have been
[1:28:26] thinking about this scripture
[1:28:29] and we should
[1:28:30] we should
[1:28:34] because if we eat the bread and drink
[1:28:36] the cup unworthily
[1:28:38] we're guilty
[1:28:41] of
[1:28:43] what calvary was all about
[1:28:51] if you reject calvary there's no more
[1:28:53] sacrifice for sin
[1:28:57] but he's honing in on what we need to do
[1:29:00] and it if it's okay i'd like to just
[1:29:02] spend a little bit of time
[1:29:04] with this
[1:29:07] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:29:10] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:29:12] cup so examine examine take a look at
[1:29:16] yourself
[1:29:18] i'm not saying you're bad i'm not saying
[1:29:20] you're good what i'm saying is take a
[1:29:23] look take a look examine
[1:29:26] um
[1:29:29] we know what the word examine means
[1:29:32] sometimes we pull something out of the
[1:29:34] oven and it's so burnt we have to
[1:29:36] examine whether it's edible
[1:29:39] did the burn the beans burn at the
[1:29:41] bottom of the pan
[1:29:43] sometimes we pull
[1:29:45] things apart in our cars and
[1:29:48] and we got to examine
[1:29:50] examine it
[1:29:52] sometimes we pull furnace filter out of
[1:29:54] the furnace and see if it's
[1:29:56] dirty examine it
[1:29:59] and we need to examine ourselves
[1:30:02] always
[1:30:03] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:30:05] unworthily
[1:30:07] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:30:11] to himself
[1:30:14] not to somebody else but to yourself not
[1:30:16] discerning the lord's body
[1:30:18] for this cause many are weak and sick
[1:30:20] among you and sleep we're going to get
[1:30:21] back to that for if we would judge
[1:30:23] ourselves we should not be judged
[1:30:26] but when we are judged we are chasing
[1:30:27] the lord that we should not be condemned
[1:30:30] with the world wherefore my brother when
[1:30:32] you come together to eat tarry one for
[1:30:35] another
[1:30:37] so when we take a look at this communion
[1:30:39] we have to analyze worthy or unworthy
[1:30:44] and in one way we're all unworthy
[1:30:48] we're all unworthy
[1:30:51] and in one way
[1:30:53] we're all worthy
[1:30:55] because his blood
[1:30:57] makes us worthy
[1:31:00] but in another way
[1:31:03] the way i want us to focus on
[1:31:05] is god is looking at the attitude that
[1:31:08] we are presently living with that's what
[1:31:11] these scriptures are
[1:31:13] it's not about whether his blood
[1:31:17] can cover us because that's not what
[1:31:18] he's speaking of
[1:31:21] and he's not speaking about
[1:31:23] like in romans that we've all sinned
[1:31:25] come short of the glory
[1:31:26] he's speaking of the attitude that we
[1:31:28] live with on a daily basis here
[1:31:32] it's not
[1:31:33] if
[1:31:35] if we been reading the bible listening
[1:31:37] to tapes paying our tithes
[1:31:41] it's really been about how we've been
[1:31:42] treating one another
[1:31:45] that's what it's been about
[1:31:48] it's it's
[1:31:49] how have we been treating one another
[1:31:56] have you been treating others just like
[1:31:58] christ treats you
[1:32:02] have you been loving others the way that
[1:32:04] christ has loved you we just went
[1:32:06] through that series
[1:32:08] the bible says not discerning the lord's
[1:32:11] body that's where it's happening
[1:32:13] it's not discerning the lord's body
[1:32:18] what does that really mean brother john
[1:32:21] discerning is something that happens
[1:32:23] inside of us
[1:32:26] it means we separate or withdraw from
[1:32:31] someone
[1:32:33] or oppose or discriminate
[1:32:36] to contend to differ to doubt to judge
[1:32:39] or to be partial
[1:32:41] now that's what it means not deserting
[1:32:43] the lord's body
[1:32:47] god doesn't want us having an attitude
[1:32:49] that wavers or staggers in how we truly
[1:32:52] feel towards someone
[1:32:56] there is no excuse
[1:32:59] for having a respect to persons towards
[1:33:01] somebody
[1:33:03] so this is what it really means
[1:33:05] to see if we're worthy or not worthy
[1:33:09] it's not that i live a little bit better
[1:33:11] life
[1:33:13] than sister lori or sister lori lives a
[1:33:15] little bit better life than brother mark
[1:33:18] that is not what it means
[1:33:21] it means how am i treating
[1:33:25] everyone
[1:33:27] not most people
[1:33:30] not 90 of the people in the church
[1:33:33] not everybody but the pastor
[1:33:37] not everyone but the song leader
[1:33:41] not everyone but
[1:33:45] everyone
[1:33:46] because a little leaven
[1:33:48] a little not treating some a little
[1:33:50] talking behind somebody's back that is
[1:33:53] where you're not discerning the lord's
[1:33:55] body
[1:33:56] and that's what makes us unworthy
[1:33:58] because calvary took that away
[1:34:01] count we took all of our sin away who
[1:34:04] are we to start judging somebody
[1:34:13] the devil's always trying to help you
[1:34:16] to discern the lord's body
[1:34:20] the problem is we listen to the devil
[1:34:25] we should stop
[1:34:27] listening to him he's he tells us to
[1:34:30] judge discriminate somebody to oppose
[1:34:34] somebody
[1:34:36] then we find ourselves being partial
[1:34:38] withdrawn or starting to separate from a
[1:34:41] certain ones in the church i'll tell you
[1:34:43] god sees all through that because the
[1:34:46] discerning happens inside of us
[1:34:49] we can put on a pretty face on the
[1:34:51] outside
[1:34:53] but i'll tell you god's looking at the
[1:34:55] heart so i want to ask you today
[1:34:58] are you worthy
[1:35:03] god is looking at how we're treating one
[1:35:05] another as being worthy or unworthy
[1:35:10] when we listen to the devil
[1:35:12] we're always judging
[1:35:15] someone
[1:35:16] just in our thoughts
[1:35:20] and when we listen to the lord
[1:35:23] we're always judging ourselves
[1:35:29] but if the lord ever shows us anything
[1:35:31] this is just the nature of the lord
[1:35:33] he wants you to lay down your life and
[1:35:35] go help that person
[1:35:37] because that is the business of the lord
[1:35:40] it's to help that's what the whole life
[1:35:42] of jesus was about laying down your life
[1:35:46] and we need to be exercising that
[1:35:48] not just i don't mean it wrong it's not
[1:35:51] about just
[1:35:52] being friends with one another and
[1:35:53] finding something to fellowship about
[1:35:55] that's wonderful but i'll tell you if
[1:35:57] you can't find some something in my life
[1:35:59] to lay down your life for you better be
[1:36:01] looking harder
[1:36:04] because we have an opportunity to do
[1:36:07] what if jesus was here sitting next to
[1:36:09] you
[1:36:10] his goal would be to try to help you
[1:36:14] it wouldn't be pat you on the back and
[1:36:16] saying you don't have to do anything
[1:36:18] more
[1:36:22] and it wouldn't just be about
[1:36:26] you know how's the fishing going
[1:36:28] when jesus asked
[1:36:30] do you have any meat
[1:36:32] he had something in mind about teaching
[1:36:34] at that time
[1:36:36] you know where is the burden one for
[1:36:38] another
[1:36:39] where is it
[1:36:41] where is the concern
[1:36:43] well i'm just so busy brother john
[1:36:46] it's so busy and you know i just believe
[1:36:49] it's between you and god
[1:36:51] well then what is our job and discerning
[1:36:55] what is our job
[1:37:03] god wants us to tarry one for another
[1:37:06] pray care carry one another's burden
[1:37:09] god wants us to wait with an expectation
[1:37:12] with one another that god is going to
[1:37:14] help this person
[1:37:17] not become partial not to separate
[1:37:20] not to withdraw
[1:37:22] not to say well i'm not part of
[1:37:27] now i'm talking about how god's looking
[1:37:29] at you i'm not talking about how i'm
[1:37:30] looking at you
[1:37:33] this is either the word
[1:37:35] or it's not
[1:37:39] we've got to learn to discern the body
[1:37:42] and we're the body
[1:37:44] and it's not just in here it's out there
[1:37:50] what makes us worthy is how we're
[1:37:52] willing to suffer
[1:37:54] for one another
[1:37:55] write that down
[1:37:57] what makes you worthy
[1:38:00] is how much you're willing to suffer for
[1:38:02] one another
[1:38:04] are we suffering for one another like
[1:38:06] christ suffered for us
[1:38:10] are we walking worthy of calvary or is
[1:38:12] calvary just some something we claim
[1:38:15] some picture on the wall
[1:38:17] is that same spirit that was at calvary
[1:38:20] inside of us now
[1:38:22] did we eat the blood do we do we drink
[1:38:24] did we drink the blood do we eat the
[1:38:26] flesh
[1:38:28] because
[1:38:29] when god sees the blood
[1:38:34] brother brandon says you can say all you
[1:38:35] want i've been baptized i'm a christian
[1:38:37] i'm this i'm the message that didn't
[1:38:39] matter
[1:38:40] it had to be on display
[1:38:43] the display is the life of christ inside
[1:38:45] of a believer
[1:38:50] and we've been discerning that our
[1:38:51] brother and sister
[1:38:56] has a problem
[1:38:59] that god wants us to help
[1:39:02] or we only been discerning
[1:39:05] that somebody's got a problem and we're
[1:39:07] not going to touch it
[1:39:12] that just kind of sounds like the devil
[1:39:13] doesn't he like point at you when you do
[1:39:14] something wrong
[1:39:16] you you i'm condemning you you should
[1:39:18] have done that christians don't do that
[1:39:21] and he just leaves him alone
[1:39:25] and that god
[1:39:28] when we do something wrong he just keeps
[1:39:30] dealing with us dealing with us until we
[1:39:32] repent
[1:39:33] get right with god and we we're back in
[1:39:36] in fellowship with him
[1:39:40] we need to have unconditional love for
[1:39:43] our brothers and sisters we've got
[1:39:44] problems
[1:39:46] god's love needs to be burning
[1:39:49] inside of us
[1:39:52] to help them why
[1:39:54] because we believe they belong to christ
[1:39:56] we discern the body that they belong to
[1:39:58] christ
[1:40:00] not
[1:40:01] they don't belong to christ so i'm not
[1:40:03] going to now we would never say that but
[1:40:05] because we
[1:40:06] just don't want to deal with them
[1:40:08] we're not discerning the body that's
[1:40:10] what this means
[1:40:13] remember the woman caught in adultery
[1:40:15] the bible says the very act
[1:40:17] i believe
[1:40:19] jesus said to her accusers
[1:40:21] whosoever is
[1:40:24] worthy
[1:40:25] he said without sin
[1:40:27] but who's ever worthy let him cast the
[1:40:30] first stone
[1:40:32] now notice
[1:40:33] it was who was ever the oldest first
[1:40:36] drop their stones
[1:40:40] if you live another day there's a good
[1:40:42] chance you're going to sin another day
[1:40:52] help us lord
[1:40:55] now how long we've been in the message
[1:41:00] what makes us worthy
[1:41:02] is when the spirit of christ is living
[1:41:05] in us discerning the body
[1:41:08] being christ to one another it's it's
[1:41:10] simple
[1:41:11] keep it simple
[1:41:14] i mean
[1:41:15] most churches out there they find a
[1:41:17] place they like they like the pastor
[1:41:19] they like the music they like the
[1:41:21] fellowship they like
[1:41:23] but there's nothing around becoming
[1:41:26] christ
[1:41:27] it's not their main motive and their
[1:41:28] main goals it's somehow it happens
[1:41:31] through a period of time without dying
[1:41:33] out without suffering without coming
[1:41:36] subject to the word
[1:41:39] brother branham said in the message a
[1:41:40] man running from the presence of god he
[1:41:42] said christianity is an everyday rugged
[1:41:44] life living for god in this present
[1:41:46] world it's a constant burning of the
[1:41:48] fire and the love of god in the heart
[1:41:50] that set you a fire and put you out
[1:41:51] yonder with people making converts to
[1:41:54] christ
[1:41:56] now to me
[1:41:58] you're discerning the lord's body
[1:42:01] outside
[1:42:02] and in
[1:42:04] if the love of god is burning in your
[1:42:07] heart for one another
[1:42:09] i believe you're discerning the lord's
[1:42:10] body
[1:42:13] but if you're backbiting and saying
[1:42:16] things and thinking things and being
[1:42:18] partial and not having and having some
[1:42:20] sort of respect to persons i'll tell you
[1:42:22] today according to the gospel you're not
[1:42:24] discerning the lord's body
[1:42:30] now we're all guilty
[1:42:33] but i say it like this what is your
[1:42:34] attitude
[1:42:38] because if you're serious about walking
[1:42:42] this word
[1:42:44] all you have to do
[1:42:46] is ask god to forgive you where you come
[1:42:48] short
[1:42:51] and don't put it under the rug and it's
[1:42:53] not a big deal and it happens to
[1:42:55] everybody no
[1:42:56] start exercising discerning the lord's
[1:42:59] body
[1:43:00] start exercising it start holding
[1:43:02] yourself accountable to laying your life
[1:43:04] down more for one another
[1:43:08] this is something that happens every
[1:43:10] time you're talking to somebody
[1:43:14] walk away
[1:43:16] i'm going to pray for you
[1:43:19] we're going to get together
[1:43:21] i'm going to help you sometimes we get
[1:43:23] together with people they stop coming to
[1:43:25] church
[1:43:27] think about that what's going on
[1:43:31] you may not want to hear this
[1:43:33] but it's the truth
[1:43:36] god is calling us to discern amen
[1:43:41] that's what makes us worthy
[1:43:43] is when we're actually representing
[1:43:45] christ to every single person
[1:43:49] now you've got a much bigger chance
[1:43:53] to be a light to somebody whose darkness
[1:43:55] is great
[1:43:57] the greater the darkness
[1:43:59] the brighter you shine
[1:44:03] and the less dark it is the harder it is
[1:44:09] colossians chapter 3 verse 8
[1:44:13] but now he also put off all these
[1:44:17] put off these anger wrath
[1:44:20] malice
[1:44:22] blasphemy filthy communication out of
[1:44:26] your mouth so put it away
[1:44:28] just just get get rid of it
[1:44:31] don't lie put off the old man with his
[1:44:33] deeds and put on the new man
[1:44:37] right verse 12 put on therefore as the
[1:44:40] elect of god
[1:44:43] now what you're putting on here is jesus
[1:44:45] christ holy and beloved bells of mercy
[1:44:48] kindness humbleness
[1:44:49] humbleness of mind
[1:44:52] meekness long suffering forbearing one
[1:44:53] another and forgiving one another if any
[1:44:55] man ever crawl against another even as
[1:44:57] christ forgave you so also do ye
[1:45:00] that's discerning the lord's body
[1:45:03] that's not only discerning the lord's
[1:45:05] body but that's what makes you worthy of
[1:45:07] calvary
[1:45:10] when you can forgive just like christ
[1:45:12] forgave you
[1:45:14] and above all these things put on
[1:45:15] charity which is the bond of perfectness
[1:45:18] and let the peace of god ruin your
[1:45:20] hearts to the which you're called into
[1:45:22] what one body
[1:45:23] and be thankful
[1:45:25] oh how beautiful this is
[1:45:31] john 13. i want to end with this john
[1:45:34] 13. i know this is a lot is this too
[1:45:37] much
[1:45:42] sometimes we we need to examine ourself
[1:45:46] through the word and not examine
[1:45:48] ourselves by how we view ourselves
[1:45:50] because usually we view ourselves as a
[1:45:52] pretty good joe
[1:45:55] but i'm not a good joe i'm not even a
[1:45:57] good john
[1:45:59] i need the blood of christ
[1:46:02] john 13 verse 1 now before the feast of
[1:46:04] the passover when jesus knew
[1:46:07] that the hour was come that he should
[1:46:09] depart out of this world unto the father
[1:46:12] having loved his own which were in the
[1:46:14] world he loved them unto the end
[1:46:17] that's what we need to do
[1:46:20] and supper being ended the devil having
[1:46:22] now put into the heart of judas iscariot
[1:46:24] simon's son to
[1:46:26] betray
[1:46:27] him
[1:46:29] jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:46:31] him all things into his hands
[1:46:33] that he
[1:46:34] was come from god and he went to god
[1:46:37] now most people when they they know that
[1:46:40] their boss or what's going on they want
[1:46:42] to act like it
[1:46:44] they want to express it they want to
[1:46:46] prove that they're the head honcho
[1:46:50] but not jesus
[1:46:53] even though he knew all things were in
[1:46:55] his hands he was a servant
[1:46:58] and he raised up from the supper
[1:47:01] and he didn't try to straighten judas
[1:47:03] out
[1:47:04] he didn't throw judas out of the church
[1:47:07] it's just the opposite
[1:47:09] he laid aside his garment and he took a
[1:47:11] towel and he girded himself
[1:47:16] after he had
[1:47:18] the communion the fellowship
[1:47:20] you know what he did he started serving
[1:47:23] those he had fellowship with
[1:47:27] i wonder we you know we we go for the
[1:47:29] fellowship and we forget the serving
[1:47:35] i know this this message
[1:47:38] these messages
[1:47:41] they're not for everybody
[1:47:42] they can't stomach them
[1:47:44] but it is bride food
[1:47:47] it is bride food
[1:47:52] and after that he poureth water into a
[1:47:54] basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:47:56] feet to wipe them with the towel
[1:47:58] wherewith he was girded
[1:48:00] and then cometh he to simon peter
[1:48:03] the one who acted so sure of himself
[1:48:06] amen always seemed to know
[1:48:08] and he said
[1:48:09] lord
[1:48:10] does not wash my feet
[1:48:13] trying to straighten up the ministry
[1:48:15] again
[1:48:17] jesus answered and said unto him
[1:48:19] what i'm doing
[1:48:21] you don't know
[1:48:23] but afterwards you're going to know
[1:48:26] i love that
[1:48:28] what i love about this scene is that
[1:48:31] jesus knew all along that they didn't
[1:48:34] know what they were what what what he
[1:48:36] was doing
[1:48:38] but it didn't stop him
[1:48:40] from
[1:48:40] carrying out
[1:48:42] what god had put on his heart to serve
[1:48:44] them and he had a faith and a confidence
[1:48:47] in his disciples that one day they were
[1:48:49] going to catch it
[1:48:51] but you know it wasn't before they got
[1:48:52] the holy ghost
[1:48:55] but when they got the holy ghost they
[1:48:57] caught it
[1:48:58] they started serving
[1:49:00] before that it was every man for himself
[1:49:03] but afterwards
[1:49:04] they started rolling up their sleeves
[1:49:07] getting out there
[1:49:09] and washing one another's feet
[1:49:13] love believeth all things
[1:49:16] peter said unto him thou shalt never
[1:49:18] wash my feet jesus answered him if i
[1:49:21] wash thee not thou has no part with me
[1:49:28] now
[1:49:30] i just want to ask a question here what
[1:49:31] do you think jesus meant when he said
[1:49:33] that
[1:49:36] if i wash thee not was he referring to
[1:49:41] a complete cleansing at calvary
[1:49:45] or was he referring to something else
[1:49:47] just posing as a question here as we as
[1:49:49] we move forward
[1:49:52] if you don't let somebody deal with your
[1:49:54] spiritual dirt
[1:49:57] what you're really saying
[1:49:59] is you have no part with the word with
[1:50:01] jesus
[1:50:03] this is why it's important
[1:50:05] to have a humble spirit see peter was
[1:50:07] coming across as some proud you're not
[1:50:10] going to do that to me i know
[1:50:12] i know that i know i'm uh
[1:50:15] you're you're greater than me and i i
[1:50:17] know that uh
[1:50:19] uh
[1:50:21] i know my feet are dirty i i i can wash
[1:50:24] my own feet i don't need you to tell me
[1:50:30] and jesus is saying hey if you don't let
[1:50:32] me do this you don't even have a part
[1:50:33] with me
[1:50:35] and we don't let somebody talk to us
[1:50:37] about the word and try to try to help
[1:50:40] you help one another
[1:50:43] you're actually saying
[1:50:45] i
[1:50:46] don't have any part with the word
[1:50:52] simon sayeth unto him lord not my feet
[1:50:55] only
[1:50:56] but my head my hands and my head
[1:51:00] what a pendulum peter was
[1:51:03] one end to the other end jumping from
[1:51:06] one extreme
[1:51:07] to the other
[1:51:09] you know all because he was looking
[1:51:11] through natural eyes he just just he
[1:51:13] couldn't focus spiritually in the middle
[1:51:18] jesus saith to him he that is washed
[1:51:21] this is where the answer that question
[1:51:23] comes he that is washed needeth not save
[1:51:27] to wash his
[1:51:29] save
[1:51:30] and he is not saved to wash his feet but
[1:51:33] is clean every wit and ye are clean but
[1:51:37] not all
[1:51:38] so here he's making this statement
[1:51:41] you're clean now he says in john 15
[1:51:43] don't turn there 15 3 you can write it
[1:51:45] down he says now you are clean through
[1:51:47] the word that i've spoken unto you how
[1:51:49] important it is to come to church and
[1:51:50] let the word clean you
[1:51:52] not just say why i trust in the blood
[1:51:54] and it doesn't matter the word
[1:51:57] the spirit word is the blood
[1:52:02] and so here they're they're clean he
[1:52:05] says
[1:52:06] but
[1:52:08] you still need a washing
[1:52:12] we should never get offended at the word
[1:52:14] when it comes forth
[1:52:17] never
[1:52:18] you need more peace you need to love god
[1:52:21] more
[1:52:23] the holy ghost will use not only this
[1:52:25] pulpit
[1:52:26] but he will use people around you
[1:52:30] to help get the dirt off of you
[1:52:34] and this dirt comes from the areas that
[1:52:36] you walked the things that you've been
[1:52:38] into the things that you've been uh
[1:52:42] involved with
[1:52:43] they
[1:52:44] they bring a dirt upon you
[1:52:47] and it's our job
[1:52:49] to get the dirt off somebody
[1:52:56] now we're going to be much more
[1:52:58] successful
[1:53:00] handling somebody's feet if we're doing
[1:53:02] it gently
[1:53:09] we don't want to take some steel wool
[1:53:10] brush
[1:53:14] start making them bleed
[1:53:18] we have to learn to have a meek
[1:53:21] spirit
[1:53:24] to just care about helping the only
[1:53:27] motive
[1:53:28] help
[1:53:30] and start exercising how many feels that
[1:53:32] you know we need to exercise that more
[1:53:35] yes
[1:53:37] and if you don't feel that
[1:53:40] that's okay
[1:53:42] but i'll stay with it until i'm on the
[1:53:44] other side
[1:53:46] i believe it's the spirit of christ
[1:53:49] it's an ordinance that we need to keep
[1:53:51] now we're going to be doing foot washing
[1:53:52] we're going to be doing communion but
[1:53:54] these are these are just symbolic or our
[1:53:57] natural type to what we need to be doing
[1:53:59] spiritually
[1:54:03] when we're washing someone's feet
[1:54:08] it's like baptism it's an outward
[1:54:10] expression of an inward work and when
[1:54:12] we're when we go to wash one another's
[1:54:14] feet today we need to be thinking about
[1:54:17] really helping this person
[1:54:20] lord show me what i can do how i can
[1:54:22] help this person be just a little bit
[1:54:25] cleaner
[1:54:26] not just tell them
[1:54:29] jesus didn't sit there
[1:54:31] and say everybody on the front row
[1:54:35] you got dirty feet
[1:54:37] you know what you boys need to do
[1:54:40] he didn't say wash one of his feet
[1:54:42] and he didn't say wash your own feet
[1:54:45] he started washing
[1:54:49] and then he said he said we don't got
[1:54:51] time it's time is passing away
[1:54:54] then he said
[1:54:55] i
[1:54:56] i'm your lord and i'm washing your feet
[1:55:01] if i'm your lord and i'm doing it you
[1:55:04] ought to better do it to one another
[1:55:10] i'll ask you today whose feet have you
[1:55:12] watched washed spiritually
[1:55:17] when is the last time you got somebody
[1:55:19] and said i wanna in my in your heart
[1:55:21] don't say it out loud now
[1:55:23] i wanna help you
[1:55:26] i wanna help you
[1:55:28] get the dirt off
[1:55:31] i want to help you get closer to the
[1:55:33] word to obey the word
[1:55:40] it's part of discerning the lord's body
[1:55:43] it's really what this whole thing's
[1:55:44] about we're taking communion but what is
[1:55:46] it about this is what it's about
[1:55:50] he's calling us up
[1:55:52] higher spiritually
[1:55:57] he wants us to remember what calvary was
[1:55:59] all about
[1:56:02] as you die out to yourself to wash
[1:56:04] somebody's feet
[1:56:06] it's calvary being exhibited in front of
[1:56:08] that doesn't the scripture say
[1:56:11] that uh
[1:56:12] i'm just gonna read it's not my notes
[1:56:14] and then we're gonna just quit after
[1:56:15] this one scripture
[1:56:18] and i believe it's in
[1:56:21] it's either first or second corinthians
[1:56:28] yes let's go to second corinthians
[1:56:30] chapter four
[1:56:34] we are troubled on every hand verse
[1:56:36] eight
[1:56:37] yet not distressed we are perplexed but
[1:56:38] not despair persecuted but not forsaken
[1:56:40] cast out but not destroyed always
[1:56:42] bearing about in our body the dying of
[1:56:44] the lord that the life also of jesus
[1:56:47] might be made manifest
[1:56:49] for we which live are
[1:56:51] always delivered unto death for jesus
[1:56:53] sake
[1:56:54] that the life also of jesus might be
[1:56:57] made manifest in our mortal flesh so
[1:56:59] then death worketh in us
[1:57:02] but life in you
[1:57:04] so when you're washing something sweet
[1:57:06] what you're doing is you're working life
[1:57:07] into somebody
[1:57:10] they may not appreciate it
[1:57:12] they may not care
[1:57:13] but it's still our job
[1:57:16] it's still our job
[1:57:18] and god is looking for
[1:57:20] for us
[1:57:21] to wash one another's feet
[1:57:26] to remember
[1:57:27] this is what
[1:57:28] jesus did for us
[1:57:30] is right before he went to the cross
[1:57:32] right before calvary
[1:57:35] you don't understand it now but you will
[1:57:37] well we understand it now
[1:57:40] and now we can put it into
[1:57:42] practice
[1:57:44] like like when we communicate with one
[1:57:46] another we fellowship with when we can
[1:57:49] have different motives
[1:57:51] motives now different objectives
[1:57:54] to find a way to help somebody get
[1:57:57] closer to the lord isn't that beautiful
[1:57:59] it's so beautiful to me let's stand
[1:58:01] together and we're going to let our
[1:58:02] brothers
[1:58:03] um
[1:58:05] get our uh
[1:58:07] our water ready
[1:58:09] praise the lord when you get time read
[1:58:11] the rest of that because it ends up
[1:58:13] ends up this whole thing ends up with
[1:58:15] him saying
[1:58:18] love one another as i have loved you
[1:58:22] by this
