[33:23] I got a quote from a missionary in India
[33:27] and he
[33:29] it's from the message ever present water
[33:32] from the Rock brother Brian says every
[33:34] Sunday morning
[33:37] we go to church and sometimes we can get
[33:40] a rut
[33:42] amen
[33:43] and he says every Sunday morning back to
[33:47] church
[33:47] what do we hear the same thing the
[33:50] preachers stand up and preach songs go
[33:53] back
[33:55] so then you're just going as a line of
[33:58] duty
[33:59] you're not a worshiper a worshiper goes
[34:03] there to worship
[34:05] to express himself before his God to
[34:09] praise God for his goodness to every
[34:12] word he hangs on to it
[34:14] Just Like A Love Affair
[34:17] he goes on tell a little story about if
[34:20] if you just went out with this girl or
[34:22] or this girl went out with this boy
[34:24] because it was kind of like you were
[34:25] asked to do it you really wouldn't want
[34:28] to do it you couldn't wait till it's
[34:30] over you're just going through the
[34:32] motions he said that's the same way it
[34:34] is when you say or think why does he
[34:37] preach so long
[34:38] what is all this stuff and everything he
[34:41] says you're you're not in love
[34:44] but when you really hang on to every
[34:46] word as the spirit gave you warning this
[34:49] morning see hanging on to every word
[34:51] that might be what he has been talking
[34:55] to you about
[34:57] so hold on to it it's eternal life every
[34:59] word of God he said it's a joy to go to
[35:02] church under any circumstance
[35:06] this is where I want to get to whether
[35:08] it's hot or cold it's indifferent
[35:11] whether the people are fussing or
[35:13] growling
[35:14] whatever they're doing it's still a joy
[35:17] to hear the word of the Lord
[35:19] then you're in love with Christ see you
[35:23] love to go to church
[35:26] well honey here it's Sunday morning
[35:28] again I guess we have to wash up and get
[35:30] the youngins and get down there my it's
[35:32] it's so boring
[35:35] see you're not in love

[36:05] we're here because we want to become
[36:08] more like Christ

[36:12] God sent his word to do that a five-fold
[36:15] Ministry
[36:16] and it's
[36:19] I just counted a privilege to be with my
[36:21] precious brothers and sisters
[36:23] let's go to the Lord this morning in in
[36:26] a in a word of prayer before I pray I
[36:29] just want to say thank you I contacted a
[36:31] couple of years to pray for us yesterday
[36:34] and I believe God heard your prayers and
[36:36] I just want to say I don't understand
[36:38] how prayer works
[36:40] it's a supernatural thing but I do know
[36:44] that it works
[36:46] I do know that the effectual fervent
[36:49] prayer of a righteous man it works more
[36:52] and and I just believe in prayer and I
[36:55] think the devil is trying to keep us
[36:57] from
[36:58] from praying
[37:00] and uh we had a a wonderful prayer
[37:03] meeting last
[37:04] prayer meeting and uh it's just good to
[37:07] see it's getting better and better and
[37:09] better and we're pressing in because if

[38:55] praise for them all for we ask it in
[38:57] Jesus Christ precious name amen amen God
[39:01] bless you let's turn to Matthew chapter
[39:03] 24 we got just a little uh
[39:08] uh
[39:09] few four scriptures uh or four verses of
[39:13] scriptures this morning and we'll have
[39:14] you be see we know we you've been
[39:16] standing a little bit the first one is
[39:18] in Matthew chapter 24 verses
[39:22] 42-44 and then we're going to turn to
[39:25] Revelations 19.
[39:28] amen the scripture says started in verse
[39:31] 42 Jesus said watch therefore
[39:35] ye know not what our your lord doth come
[39:40] but know this that if the good man of
[39:43] the house had known what watched the
[39:46] thief
[39:46] would come he would have watched and
[39:50] would not have suffered his house to be
[39:52] broken up therefore be also ready for in
[39:56] such an hour as you think not the son of
[40:01] man cometh
[40:03] amen now there's a little group of
[40:06] people that took heed to that scripture
[40:09] and we see him rejoicing here in chapter
[40:13] 19 of Revelations verse number 7 let us
[40:16] be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[40:19] him for the marriage of the Lamb is come
[40:22] and his wife have made herself ready
[40:27] amen praise the Lord God bless you may
[40:28] be seated
[40:31] now I know there's many needs amongst us
[40:34] and
[40:35] and
[40:36] we're all looking to the Lord for
[40:38] different
[40:39] request
[40:42] Direction in our lives
[40:44] Comfort understanding
[40:46] finances
[40:48] and
[40:50] the time that we're living in is
[40:53] probably the most hardest time that
[40:56] there ever been on the face of the Earth
[41:00] when you you talk about
[41:03] um
[41:04] everything there's such a snare that
[41:07] Satan has brought on this world
[41:09] and there's been so much confusion in in
[41:13] our medical field we just went through
[41:16] the most craziest thing with the Colvin
[41:21] and uh the the the the the the
[41:27] nation
[41:29] is getting in worse shape and we know
[41:33] that Satan is weakening the Nations
[41:37] and uh
[41:39] um Jesus told us that in the last days
[41:41] that
[41:43] um
[41:44] iniquity were to bound and hatred
[41:47] increase and it people Paul said people
[41:50] would become more unthankful in us
[41:53] they're just basically more unfriendly
[41:56] and and uh and I I believe there's many
[42:00] things that we could be
[42:02] talking about this morning but I I want
[42:05] to talk about
[42:06] being ready for the coming of the Lord
[42:08] because that's really there's there's
[42:11] come in a day and a time that it's going
[42:13] to happen and no matter what's going on
[42:14] out here we are not going to have
[42:16] everything taken care of
[42:19] it right it isn't like I'm going to have
[42:21] all this paid for and all the finances
[42:24] are taken care of and the the cars they
[42:26] got their oil changed and this ready now
[42:28] everything is good the beds are made and
[42:30] now we're ready
[42:33] and so we need to focus on what's really
[42:35] important that's us being ready
[42:38] and so I want to entitle this message
[42:40] ready or not here I come
[42:44] and this message I want to say this this
[42:47] message is the only thing
[42:49] that can get us ready for Rapture and I
[42:52] just want to let that be the subject for
[42:54] us today
[42:56] we all remember when we were younger we
[42:58] used to play a little game called hide
[43:00] and seek
[43:02] and when we were playing and
[43:04] there used to be someone that had to
[43:06] find somebody and we were trying to find
[43:08] the best spot and sometimes we didn't
[43:11] get ready in time and they say ready or
[43:13] not here I come and they would and you
[43:15] weren't ready yet you weren't fully hid
[43:17] all the leaves weren't on you and you
[43:19] were easy to be found and you said I
[43:21] wasn't ready yet you came too quick
[43:24] now when it comes to the coming of the
[43:26] Lord he's coming whether we're ready or
[43:28] not
[43:30] but the thing is we're not left without
[43:32] an opportunity to get ready he has given
[43:35] us that opportunity today
[43:38] now most of us feel confident that we
[43:40] are ready for the coming of the Lord
[43:44] how come we didn't have any amens for
[43:46] that statement I just want to know I
[43:49] want you to know I'm listening to you
[43:52] but are we really ready
[43:55] or do we think we're ready
[43:58] this message was sent to get us ready
[44:00] and it's imperative that this message
[44:04] is living out of our lives
[44:08] the laodicean church also feels that
[44:11] they're absolutely ready
[44:13] but it's a false sense of security
[44:16] just as every man is right in his own
[44:18] eyes
[44:19] the foolish versions where I talk a
[44:21] little bit about those this morning they
[44:23] feel that they're ready that they're in
[44:25] need of nothing but their whole way of
[44:27] thinking is it's lukewarm
[44:30] there's no fire
[44:32] in them
[44:34] there's no pressing towards the mark of
[44:36] the High Calling there's no desperation
[44:38] I got to get perfect love there's no
[44:41] urgency to align their lives up with the
[44:44] complete word of God they are battling
[44:47] and I don't know if you really really
[44:48] realize this but we all have Spirits
[44:51] coming against us telling us that you
[44:55] are okay the Way You Are
[44:58] there is no need to dig in anymore and
[45:01] if you need Scripture Satan will give
[45:03] you scripture
[45:05] he'll do whatever he has to do to cool
[45:08] your jets
[45:11] to keep you from being on fire for God
[45:18] so when we're thinking about being ready
[45:20] we should never base it on how we feel
[45:25] neither can we go by how much we know
[45:27] right brother Brian says we live in the
[45:30] most intellectual age there is
[45:33] we can't go by works alone
[45:37] although faithfulness is a must
[45:41] faithfulness is a must
[45:44] we shouldn't feel safe just because
[45:46] we're in a message Church
[45:49] message Believers can feel just as
[45:51] comfortable just as complacent as as
[45:54] Believers in the denominational Church
[46:00] Satan has mimicked God's spirit in this
[46:03] age so close that there's only a few
[46:06] elect that are ever going to see the
[46:07] difference
[46:11] if we're supposed to work out our own
[46:13] salvation with fear and trembling I
[46:15] believe we ought to be working out
[46:17] getting ready for the Rapture if you're
[46:19] in trembling
[46:22] our God is a consuming fire
[46:27] amen Jesus told us to be ready
[46:31] so if we're not ready the first thing we
[46:33] need to do is get ready
[46:36] and once we get ready we have to remain
[46:39] ready
[46:41] so if you get ready remain ready that
[46:45] means you're ready
[46:47] that's what Jesus meant when he said be
[46:50] ready
[46:52] but if the moment you don't remain ready
[46:55] you're not rapturable
[47:00] so this is a much more higher calling
[47:02] than just you know get baptized accept
[47:04] the message have an experience of the
[47:07] Holy Ghost that it's that is not good
[47:10] enough
[47:12] so I'm not an evangelist I'm not going
[47:14] to come across in an evangelistical way
[47:17] today but
[47:19] I want to provoke you to Good Works
[47:23] remaining rapturable means you're on
[47:26] fire
[47:27] your lamp is burning and people can see
[47:31] your light up for Christ
[47:35] so ready or not he's coming
[47:37] so I say we must remain ratchetable
[47:43] now how do we know we're really ready
[47:46] how do we know that this is the hour
[47:49] that he's supposed to come
[47:50] so in describing the the condition of
[47:53] the hour that Jesus would return the
[47:55] Bible gives us a number of indicators
[47:59] we see Israel's return into her Homeland
[48:01] in 1947
[48:04] and Jesus said that that generation
[48:05] would not pass
[48:08] now we've talked about a generation
[48:09] being 40 years and 50 years and you know
[48:12] I'm so glad God interprets his word by
[48:15] bringing it to pass we don't need to
[48:17] know exactly the day in fact God himself
[48:20] kept the angels from knowing what day
[48:22] he's coming back
[48:25] why
[48:27] he wants to see
[48:29] a love affair take place
[48:31] he wants to see who is going to sell out
[48:35] be sold out and their focus is heaven
[48:39] come on their focus is it's so easy to
[48:42] just have uh well you know as long as I
[48:44] got that taken care of I'm going to live
[48:46] down here God's not looking for that
[48:51] another one Jesus said as it was in the
[48:54] days of Noah so shall it be in the
[48:55] coming of the son of man
[48:58] there is nothing but evil on the minds
[49:01] of the people during that day
[49:03] as it was of the days a lot so shall it
[49:06] be in the coming of the son of man
[49:08] perversion was so
[49:10] so great that it vexed the home of the
[49:12] righteous
[49:14] think about that it grew right around
[49:17] the church homosexuality and the
[49:19] different things and today this
[49:21] transgender is nothing but an offshoot
[49:23] of homosexuality amen
[49:27] the Bible says for this call as God gave
[49:29] them up unto vile affections
[49:33] for even their women did change
[49:36] the natural use
[49:38] into which is against nature I know we
[49:43] can relate to this with what's going on
[49:46] and likewise also men leaving their
[49:48] natural use of the women
[49:50] burn in their lust one toward another
[49:53] men with men working that which is
[49:56] unseemly and receiving in themselves
[49:58] that recompense
[50:01] of their air which was meat and even as
[50:05] they did not like to retain God in their
[50:08] knowledge God gave them over to a
[50:09] reprobate mind to do those things which
[50:12] are not convenient
[50:15] now you want to write that down that's
[50:18] Romans 1 sometime you can go back and
[50:20] read that I was talking to someone
[50:21] yesterday just here in the church and he
[50:24] was telling me just saw in the news that
[50:26] there was this two couples they were
[50:28] um
[50:29] they lived in this kind of an apartment
[50:31] and this one person of this couple uh
[50:36] one one of the persons of the couple he
[50:38] went and killed his partner and then
[50:40] also killed the other couple in the
[50:42] apartment will come to find out the one
[50:44] that killed
[50:47] um
[50:48] him and his partner
[50:50] um one was a male
[50:53] in this marriage one was a male
[50:56] and and transgendered he didn't really
[50:59] become a woman but he wanted to be one
[51:01] and the woman she she was a transgender
[51:05] too and she became a man and they got
[51:06] married
[51:09] I I mean
[51:11] as it was in the days of lot
[51:13] we're living in the hour where the
[51:16] spirit brother by him says people die
[51:18] but Spirits do not die
[51:21] amen
[51:23] and
[51:24] we must take life seriously yeah we we
[51:28] don't want to be numb to what's
[51:30] happening right
[51:32] but these are signs for us to be ready
[51:36] another indicator is that there are so
[51:39] many people and Believers that are
[51:40] thinking that God's not coming for a
[51:43] while
[51:45] and Jesus said therefore be ready for in
[51:48] such an hour as you think not the son of
[51:50] man cometh and if there was ever an hour
[51:52] where people don't think God's coming
[51:54] this is the hour if they did they would
[51:56] get more serious
[51:59] Believers they're leaving Christianity
[52:01] by the multitudes
[52:04] pretty soon Christianity is going to be
[52:06] such a minute group
[52:09] there's a great falling away a great
[52:11] apostasy
[52:13] people who once were in this message
[52:15] have first are forsaking it
[52:18] and they're literally mocking the truth
[52:21] the scripture says knowing this first
[52:23] that there shall come in the last days
[52:25] scoffers walking after their own lust
[52:28] and saying where is the promise of his
[52:30] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[52:32] all things continue as they were from
[52:34] the beginning of creation
[52:37] this is what's happening this is this is
[52:40] why it's so hard to go up to somebody
[52:41] and share the gospel with them
[52:44] now the spirit speaketh expressively
[52:48] that in the latter times some shall
[52:51] depart from the faith why
[52:54] giving heed to seducing spirits and
[52:57] doctrines of devils
[52:59] now seducing Spirits are nothing but
[53:02] Impostors
[53:05] misleading spirits
[53:08] their job is to mislead you
[53:13] Impostors these are spirits that act
[53:16] like they're right
[53:18] they don't even know they're necessarily
[53:21] the people that have these spirits on
[53:23] them they don't know
[53:27] that that spirit is even on them
[53:31] they act like they're right but that
[53:33] spirit is trying to mislead you
[53:37] doctrines of devil now I'll tell you
[53:39] what a doctrine of the devil is is
[53:41] someone who takes part of the word and
[53:44] refuses to take the rest of it
[53:47] that to me is a doctrine of the devil
[53:49] because men shall live
[53:52] by every word of God we need every word
[53:55] of God
[53:57] now God has a bride and the devil has a
[54:00] bride
[54:01] brother Brandon said in the message God
[54:02] of this evil age he said she is the
[54:05] devil's bride wrapped up in his
[54:07] religious sin loving knowledge for this
[54:09] present evil age to deceive you
[54:14] oh my a whole crochet
[54:17] cliche of seducing Spirits by in
[54:20] scientific knowledge and modern
[54:22] civilization
[54:24] there are so many weird things happening
[54:27] in this message
[54:29] things I would never ever believe would
[54:32] happen
[54:34] weird stuff
[54:35] we're certainly living
[54:37] in the closing hour of his return
[54:40] and I just say ready or not he's coming
[54:44] ready or not he's coming God is not
[54:47] waiting around for those who have been
[54:50] ignoring the truth to get ready
[54:54] he is not waiting around for those
[54:58] he's waiting for those who haven't had a
[55:01] chance to receive the truth to hear it
[55:03] so we can get out of here
[55:06] there will always be people
[55:09] who are going to be borderline believers
[55:12] who are not really serious about God
[55:17] right look we have they have a chance
[55:19] and Brother Band says no man is is
[55:21] should ever get to hear the gospel twice
[55:24] if everybody hasn't heard it once that's
[55:26] how important it is it only takes one
[55:29] message brother Brandon said there will
[55:30] be those that make it with one message
[55:36] so when we come here and we're blessed
[55:38] and we're blessed we pertain some we're
[55:39] blessed and we're blessed
[55:42] and then we still refuse to give
[55:44] everything to God that we can
[55:48] help us Lord
[55:50] help us Lord to get ready
[55:53] let's take a look at these ten virgins
[55:56] in Matthew chapter 25. I wasn't going to
[55:59] read this because I have so much stuff
[56:01] this morning and I'll tell you we got
[56:03] about 18 different quotes from different
[56:05] messages I mean 18 different messages
[56:07] and this is what happens when you you go
[56:10] on vacation for a month and you don't
[56:12] got nothing to do
[56:15] all right Matthew chapter 25 verses 1
[56:18] through 13 then shall the Kingdom of
[56:21] Heaven be likened to ten virgins which
[56:23] took their lambs and went forth to meet
[56:25] the bridegroom and five of them were
[56:27] wise and five were foolish they that
[56:29] were foolish took their lambs and they
[56:31] took no oil
[56:32] and took no oil with them but the wise
[56:36] took all in their vessels with their
[56:39] lamps
[56:39] now while the bridegroom tarried they
[56:42] all slumbered and slept and at midnight
[56:44] there was a cry made behold the
[56:47] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[56:49] now that is the message of the hour
[56:53] right now amen that is the message that
[56:57] brother Brandon set right there in verse
[56:58] 6 then all those versions they Rose and
[57:01] trimmed their lamps and the foolish said
[57:04] unto the wise
[57:05] give us of your oil for our Lambs are
[57:09] gone out now this is real important here
[57:11] a lamp can't go out unless it was on
[57:15] so it was burning at one time something
[57:18] was making that burn
[57:20] but the wise answer now the reason I'm
[57:23] saying this is because Satan has tricked
[57:25] a lot of people thinking they have
[57:27] enough to make it
[57:30] we don't want to sink under that
[57:32] delusion and I understand that we need
[57:35] Faith but what we need more is to have a
[57:37] heart that says God fill me so full of
[57:40] you that there is absolutely no question
[57:42] I am burning for you I'm winning souls
[57:45] for you yes sir amen
[57:49] but the wise answer is saying not Soul
[57:51] lest there be not enough for us and you
[57:55] but go ye rather to them that sell and
[57:58] buy for yourselves
[58:00] while they went to buy the bridegroom
[58:02] came and they that were ready went in
[58:05] with him with him to the marriage and
[58:09] the door was shut kind of like in the
[58:13] boat right in in the with uh
[58:16] no one the ark and preaching for 120
[58:21] years and and finally God shut the door
[58:25] and it's going to happen with the
[58:27] Rapture the same way
[58:29] and afterwards came also the other
[58:31] virgin saying
[58:33] Lord open
[58:35] the door to us and he answered and said
[58:38] verily I say unto you
[58:40] I know you not
[58:44] and so he ends this Parable by saying
[58:46] watch therefore for ye know neither the
[58:48] day nor the hour
[58:50] we're in the son of man cometh
[58:53] now I believe that all of us would like
[58:55] to know
[58:56] when the coming of the Lord is
[58:59] I mean there have been preachers since
[59:01] brother random has left
[59:03] that has expressed when he's coming and
[59:06] when they didn't come to that day there
[59:08] was other ministers that rolls up and
[59:10] said he's coming at this date
[59:13] and people like to say what they feel
[59:15] what they think because they like a
[59:17] gathering they like people to to follow
[59:19] them to to look up to them
[59:22] but you know God don't want us to know
[59:26] but what he does want us to do is put
[59:28] our attention
[59:30] and making sure we're ready
[59:33] and not taking the bait that Satan
[59:36] offers us of oh don't worry you're ready
[59:39] don't worry you're ready
[59:43] many will come to me in that day
[59:48] I don't want to be part of that
[59:50] and I'm not saying any of you are that
[59:52] what I'm saying is we don't want to
[59:55] listen to the devil
[59:58] we want to expose the devil
[1:00:00] want to call them out
[1:00:03] now There Were Ten virgins in all of
[1:00:06] these were virgins meaning they were all
[1:00:08] clean living Christians
[1:00:11] they lived pure lives
[1:00:16] and all of them were on their way to
[1:00:19] meet the Lord Brother Bradham said
[1:00:21] they all preached the second coming of
[1:00:24] Christ
[1:00:24] his sacrifice in the atonement
[1:00:27] brother Branham alert to the the fact
[1:00:30] that the two Spirits were so close that
[1:00:32] it deceived everyone but the elected and
[1:00:35] he talked about those two the two
[1:00:37] spirits of those virgins were so close
[1:00:40] right
[1:00:42] brother Brandon compared it to a woman
[1:00:43] making a dress out of a a material and
[1:00:47] you sisters that have made dresses you
[1:00:49] go buy a big uh amount of grass that you
[1:00:54] need and you lay your pattern on it and
[1:00:56] you cut out what you need and you sew it
[1:00:58] together to make your dress are you with
[1:01:01] me
[1:01:02] all right we just need to say a little
[1:01:03] bit more amens because if not I'm gonna
[1:01:06] go sit there I'm gonna come back and say
[1:01:08] Amen I'm gonna
[1:01:09] so now the dress is made with this
[1:01:12] material
[1:01:14] what's left over are the remnants it is
[1:01:17] the same material
[1:01:20] but it has not been chosen
[1:01:23] it has not been elected
[1:01:27] it has not been predestinated
[1:01:30] but yet it's the same material
[1:01:33] so what are we looking at when we look
[1:01:35] at our lives and we say I'm
[1:01:37] predestinated I'm elected I'm chosen
[1:01:40] what are we looking at
[1:01:43] are we looking at that we're in the
[1:01:44] message
[1:01:45] and this is the way that I've been
[1:01:47] taught I've been taught to say I'm
[1:01:48] elected I'm taught to say I'm chosen
[1:01:55] I'm not trying to dischristianize
[1:01:57] anybody here I'm trying to provoke us to
[1:01:59] dig dig dig dig that's my motive that's
[1:02:03] where I'm at
[1:02:06] what separated them was the oil
[1:02:10] well you know that's the Holy Ghost
[1:02:14] the five that were foolish
[1:02:16] fought they had enough of God in their
[1:02:20] lives to make a rapture
[1:02:22] that's the truth they did
[1:02:26] but it was a trick of Satan
[1:02:29] it's a trick of Satan to get Believers
[1:02:31] to feel that they have enough to make it
[1:02:35] the foolish versions were deceived
[1:02:39] and are deceived in this age when it's
[1:02:41] happening they never recognize the devil
[1:02:45] in his tricks
[1:02:47] and if you don't recognize the devil
[1:02:49] trying to trick you you'll never be able
[1:02:52] to defeat him
[1:02:54] brother Gideon sent me a quote yesterday
[1:02:57] in the message he just how can I
[1:03:00] overcome and he says brother Brandon
[1:03:02] says overcome means to recognize the
[1:03:04] devil in every one of his tricks
[1:03:07] I responded back by saying without
[1:03:10] recognizing you can't annihilate them
[1:03:13] the last thing we want and we know our
[1:03:15] greatest enemies ourself right the last
[1:03:17] thing we want is the devil tricking us
[1:03:21] you know the you don't even have to be a
[1:03:22] believer in the devil teaches you to to
[1:03:25] look at to look at evil in somebody else
[1:03:29] you don't have to be in the message you
[1:03:30] don't have to be in the church
[1:03:33] but to recognize the devil and yourself
[1:03:36] takes a real spiritual humility
[1:03:42] the foolish versions they never overcame
[1:03:46] they never overcame
[1:03:49] Revelations 12 11 and they overcame him
[1:03:52] by the blood of the Lamb by the word of
[1:03:54] their testimony they love not their
[1:03:55] lives unto death
[1:03:57] three things here
[1:03:59] brother Brown says the token must be
[1:04:01] applied
[1:04:03] it isn't just I Believe In The Blood I
[1:04:05] believe in Calvary
[1:04:06] but that life has to come upon back on
[1:04:09] the believer to overcome in this age
[1:04:12] and by the word of their testimony the
[1:04:14] testimony of the Bride will be the word
[1:04:17] the word the word the word their
[1:04:19] testimony is the word nothing else
[1:04:22] just the word
[1:04:24] because that's the only thing we can
[1:04:25] over and number three and they love not
[1:04:29] their lives unto death
[1:04:32] that is the hardest one that's getting
[1:04:35] up in the morning and meeting business
[1:04:36] when you say Lord I'm sick of my life I
[1:04:39] want you today
[1:04:42] but that's what it takes to overcome
[1:04:47] John 5 4 says and this is the victory
[1:04:50] that overcometh the world even our faith
[1:04:52] so it takes faith in all three of those
[1:04:54] things Faith to apply the Life of Christ
[1:04:57] to you Faith to take this word to
[1:04:59] believe what this word says about you
[1:05:01] more than how you feel about yourself
[1:05:04] it takes Faith to do that
[1:05:06] it takes Faith to lay your life down
[1:05:10] because how many times do we entertain
[1:05:12] the thought this isn't worth it
[1:05:13] nothing's going to change
[1:05:15] so it takes Faith this is the victory
[1:05:17] that overcometh Authority even our faith
[1:05:21] so half of the virgins thought they
[1:05:24] could make it with what Holy Ghost they
[1:05:25] had
[1:05:27] because they were clean living believers
[1:05:30] so what makes you better than me
[1:05:33] brother Brandon
[1:05:36] share something in questions and answers
[1:05:39] number four and 64.
[1:05:41] question came to brother and brother
[1:05:42] Branham is it possible for a person to
[1:05:45] be lost
[1:05:46] and end up in hell if he rejects the
[1:05:50] light of the word even though
[1:05:53] he has had a genuine experience of
[1:05:56] justification and sanctification
[1:06:00] brother Branham told us
[1:06:03] that justification and sanctification
[1:06:06] is a part of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:11] so the question is asked to brother
[1:06:13] Branham if a man has a genuine
[1:06:15] experience he's Justified a genuine
[1:06:18] experience he's been Sanctified can he
[1:06:22] still end up in hell
[1:06:25] let's see what he said
[1:06:27] yes sir that is exactly right
[1:06:31] it's just try to keep it real simple
[1:06:32] here
[1:06:34] yes that's right
[1:06:36] that means I must go on
[1:06:40] I must go on to perfection
[1:06:43] I must
[1:06:47] I must admit that what I have done is
[1:06:49] not enough and that if he gives me
[1:06:52] another day to get more of him I should
[1:06:54] seek it
[1:06:59] because a person has been Justified has
[1:07:02] a portion of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:03] or else he would have never repented
[1:07:07] right because it's the goodness of God
[1:07:09] that leads man to repent it's the same
[1:07:11] thing with saying these virgins were
[1:07:12] Sanctified they lived clean lives but
[1:07:15] they still missed it
[1:07:18] now according to the scriptures half of
[1:07:21] the virgins thought they could make it
[1:07:23] with what holy ghosts they had
[1:07:28] and the other half humbled himself to
[1:07:31] getting more and more
[1:07:34] of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:36] and that's what it takes a spirit of
[1:07:39] humility
[1:07:40] we need more Holy Ghost for our journey
[1:07:44] and we just think about when brother
[1:07:45] Branham went through those those seals
[1:07:48] and he talked about the horse riders how
[1:07:51] each horse rider came out with some
[1:07:53] deception against the church to knock
[1:07:55] the church down brother Brian said that
[1:07:57] God rose up the word to combat that
[1:08:01] horse
[1:08:03] and he gave more word to each age well
[1:08:06] in this age we have the complete word
[1:08:08] why because we're we're we're in combat
[1:08:12] with the complete devil
[1:08:14] on every hand I don't the news media
[1:08:17] everywhere you just look we're we're
[1:08:20] wrestling the devil we even come to
[1:08:22] church and the devil says Ah you don't
[1:08:24] have to believe that
[1:08:27] we're facing the devil everywhere we
[1:08:31] need the whole word of God
[1:08:34] Jesus said and while the foolish virgins
[1:08:36] finally humbled themselves to go by the
[1:08:40] oil
[1:08:41] the bridegroom came
[1:08:43] and they that were ready went in with
[1:08:47] him to the marriage and the door
[1:08:50] was shut
[1:08:53] so what's our solution
[1:08:56] to go buy the oil
[1:08:59] we got to buy the oil
[1:09:02] now
[1:09:05] that doesn't mean we're take up an
[1:09:06] offering
[1:09:07] doesn't mean we're in penance
[1:09:11] it doesn't mean burn candles
[1:09:13] but what you have to buy it there is no
[1:09:15] other way to get the Holy Ghost and buy
[1:09:17] it
[1:09:18] here is it
[1:09:20] we understand it's a free gift in other
[1:09:23] words there is nothing that you could
[1:09:26] muster up of your own to get it to
[1:09:29] purchase it but you still buy it
[1:09:33] and you buy it with your heart
[1:09:36] you can't get it without your heart he's
[1:09:39] standing at the door knocking the Holy
[1:09:42] Ghost wants to come in
[1:09:45] but you got to let them in
[1:09:51] you shall seek me and find me when you
[1:09:53] search for me with all your heart come
[1:09:56] by without money and without price the
[1:09:59] Bible says amen
[1:10:02] now was it that the foolish virgins
[1:10:04] didn't think they had oil
[1:10:07] they thought they had enough oil
[1:10:12] they thought they had enough of the Holy
[1:10:15] Ghost but their own testimony at the end
[1:10:18] was give us of your oil for our lamps
[1:10:21] are going out and if you just follow
[1:10:22] that what that really means is for our
[1:10:25] lamps are going out
[1:10:29] so it was in the process of the
[1:10:31] realization that I didn't quite have
[1:10:34] enough
[1:10:35] it was during that moment that time of
[1:10:38] realization
[1:10:39] that their lamps was not burning as
[1:10:42] bright as it should
[1:10:44] that Jesus came
[1:10:54] we don't want our labs to go out
[1:10:57] we want them to keep burning
[1:11:01] we need to get more oil we need to spend
[1:11:04] more time really getting down to
[1:11:06] business when we pray
[1:11:09] we can spend all day praying about all
[1:11:11] the things that we want in life
[1:11:14] or the needs of others that somebody
[1:11:16] asks us to pray about the needs in their
[1:11:18] life
[1:11:19] but we do need to spend some time
[1:11:21] praying about getting more Holy Ghost
[1:11:27] any man that's filled with the Holy
[1:11:29] Ghost have you ever met did brother
[1:11:31] Brandon say no wait a minute I have
[1:11:33] enough Holy Ghost don't do I do not need
[1:11:36] any more
[1:11:38] a man that's full of the Holy Ghost is
[1:11:41] not going to say I have enough
[1:11:45] you can't have enough of God
[1:11:53] but a man that doesn't have enough Holy
[1:11:55] Ghost
[1:11:56] he might fight you
[1:11:58] say don't you tell me that I have enough
[1:12:00] who are you to tell me
[1:12:02] now I'm telling you this is not for me
[1:12:04] to tell you this is this message is for
[1:12:06] you to get serious and ask God Amen man
[1:12:10] lean towards the air of getting more of
[1:12:13] God
[1:12:16] now
[1:12:18] the anointing is what keeps you burning
[1:12:23] oil sitting there doing nothing does
[1:12:27] nothing
[1:12:29] it's when it's burning
[1:12:31] that it gives light
[1:12:34] The Living Word it's what needs to be
[1:12:37] happening in our life Jesus said my
[1:12:39] words are spirit and their life
[1:12:42] but the word also says the letter
[1:12:44] killeth right
[1:12:46] and the spirit giveth life so what we're
[1:12:48] looking for is the anointing of the word
[1:12:52] that's what keeps your lamp burning
[1:12:56] amen it is what keeps you on fire for
[1:12:58] God is what keeps you away from when I
[1:13:01] went to church I did my duty I read the
[1:13:03] Bible I prayed today and I'm going to go
[1:13:04] do what I want to do it is that
[1:13:06] anointing that keeps you away from that
[1:13:14] the anointing of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:13:18] word for this hour
[1:13:20] amen or else Jesus wanted to send it to
[1:13:23] us
[1:13:24] Jesus is an I am God he's the same
[1:13:27] yesterday team forever and he sent the
[1:13:29] message behold the bridegroom cometh to
[1:13:32] get us ready
[1:13:34] I'll tell you what really really
[1:13:36] provoked this
[1:13:40] is that in my heart I have felt that we
[1:13:44] are not digging into this message enough
[1:13:48] we can't rely on a five-fold Ministry
[1:13:51] just to come and give us what we should
[1:13:54] be doing
[1:13:56] yes we want a five-fold Ministry and
[1:13:58] yeah they need to be preaching that
[1:14:00] message here or they shouldn't be here
[1:14:04] but we need to be digging into what's
[1:14:06] being spoken into what the prophet is
[1:14:09] taught
[1:14:11] because it's in that that gets us ready
[1:14:13] to not the prophet say rapturing faith
[1:14:16] lies in those tapes
[1:14:18] so we need to get in there yes sir
[1:14:22] the requirement of being ready
[1:14:24] with enough oil enough anointed oil
[1:14:29] to keep you on fire for God
[1:14:33] not well I'm saved I'm Justified I
[1:14:36] believe that I'm going to message Church
[1:14:38] and all the other things that the enemy
[1:14:40] tells us
[1:14:44] God's anointing is never going to come
[1:14:46] upon you
[1:14:47] to make you relax brother sister
[1:14:51] yeah I'm not saying God won't give you a
[1:14:53] revelation
[1:14:55] to give you security
[1:14:58] and to get make sure you have that peace
[1:15:00] of God Sherry will but he's never going
[1:15:03] to tell you something to make you relax
[1:15:04] that's another spirit
[1:15:10] we need to be on fire we need to be
[1:15:12] burning and if that's not happening
[1:15:14] check what's speaking to you because
[1:15:16] there's Impostors
[1:15:21] I want to take a look at the
[1:15:23] identification of being ready
[1:15:25] and number one is we need all the truth
[1:15:30] we need all the truth
[1:15:32] Jesus said when the Holy Ghost comes and
[1:15:35] starts dealing with you it's going to
[1:15:37] get all the world out of you
[1:15:39] right it's it's gonna it's gonna speak
[1:15:42] of the the things that's happening and
[1:15:45] and rebuke it out of your life and and
[1:15:48] separate you from the things of the
[1:15:50] world and he that loves the world the
[1:15:52] love of God can't be in them so he's
[1:15:55] going to get that out of there and when
[1:15:57] he the spirit of Truth has come he will
[1:15:59] guide you into all truth
[1:16:03] so we we need all truth to be ready
[1:16:06] it's we're not living in Luther's age
[1:16:08] where we only need a part
[1:16:11] we need the truth living in US
[1:16:15] amen not just the knowledge of all the
[1:16:17] truth but we need it living in US
[1:16:20] according to Ephesians 5 27 God is going
[1:16:24] to present himself a glorious Church
[1:16:27] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:16:30] thing but that it should be holy and
[1:16:32] without blemish
[1:16:36] well you don't have to look very far to
[1:16:38] see blemishes
[1:16:40] right amen and yes we have the blood of
[1:16:44] Christ
[1:16:46] but we should also be pressing
[1:16:50] now we need number three we need to
[1:16:52] manifest His image
[1:16:55] Romans 8 29 for whom he did for no he
[1:16:58] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:17:00] the image of his son that he might be
[1:17:02] the firstborn among many brethren
[1:17:06] beloved now are we
[1:17:09] the sons of God and it does not yet
[1:17:11] appear what we shall be but we know that
[1:17:13] when he show up here we shall be like
[1:17:15] him for we shall see him as he is
[1:17:19] Romans 8 tells us the whole creation is
[1:17:21] groaning and travailing in pain together
[1:17:24] until now for the earnest expectation of
[1:17:26] the creation waited for the
[1:17:28] manifestation of the sons of God so God
[1:17:31] is waiting for something the angels are
[1:17:33] waiting for some the whole creation of
[1:17:36] God is waiting for something to happen
[1:17:38] to us
[1:17:44] amen now Jesus didn't say I'll make you
[1:17:46] ready
[1:17:48] Jesus said be ready
[1:17:51] there's a part for us to play
[1:17:54] now I know I cannot create
[1:17:59] I do not have the power
[1:18:02] to speak the spoken word I cannot create
[1:18:05] squirrels to run down here jump up here
[1:18:07] go over there I do not have that
[1:18:11] brother Brandon said when he spoke of
[1:18:14] that he said notice that was me I never
[1:18:16] he said that was not me that said that
[1:18:19] he said God told me to do that was his
[1:18:22] will
[1:18:24] there's certain things we cannot do
[1:18:27] to change us
[1:18:30] that's the quick and you know the Holy
[1:18:32] Spirit
[1:18:33] but there are things that we can do
[1:18:36] like humble ourselves before the Lord
[1:18:38] get serious with God dig into the
[1:18:41] message say God I hunger I thirst for
[1:18:44] you if my people which are called by my
[1:18:46] name shall humble themselves and call on
[1:18:49] the Lord then I shall hear from heaven
[1:18:53] there is something we can do
[1:18:57] and I think if that's that part that God
[1:18:59] is looking for us to do
[1:19:02] they that hunger and thirst for
[1:19:04] righteousness shall be filled they that
[1:19:06] keep asking keep seeking keep knocking
[1:19:08] God will give more Holy Ghost if you
[1:19:10] want it but if you're content with where
[1:19:12] you're at
[1:19:13] notice what you're identifying yourself
[1:19:16] as
[1:19:17] whoa
[1:19:21] are you coming back to the services next
[1:19:23] Sunday just wanted to make I don't know
[1:19:26] if you're coming back to the anniversary
[1:19:27] Services we're having
[1:19:29] now the requirements that are ready
[1:19:31] hidden in the scriptures Jesus says
[1:19:33] search the scriptures for in them you
[1:19:35] think you have eternal life but they are
[1:19:36] they that testify me
[1:19:38] but it took a seventh age messenger
[1:19:42] to open the scriptures to us
[1:19:46] it took the Malik the ministry of
[1:19:49] Malachi for the ministry of Elijah to
[1:19:51] restore us back to the original word
[1:19:54] now without the message of the hour I'll
[1:19:56] say this we cannot be ready for a
[1:19:57] Rapture in this age
[1:20:00] it's the truth we must receive the life
[1:20:04] of the message now in the inside of us
[1:20:07] not the knowledge
[1:20:10] but but the life of the message we must
[1:20:14] receive the life of the message
[1:20:16] this message will preserve you unto the
[1:20:19] coming of the Lord
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:21] now you couldn't you couldn't make it in
[1:20:25] the rapture
[1:20:27] in Luther's time if you did not receive
[1:20:31] the message the just shall live by faith
[1:20:33] amen
[1:20:35] amen you had to receive the message of
[1:20:37] the hour then
[1:20:42] and that's that was the message they're
[1:20:45] going to come up in the Rapture like we
[1:20:47] are we're going to be in the same
[1:20:49] Rapture together
[1:20:51] but we we've been blessed because God
[1:20:55] put us in this age brother Brian says
[1:20:57] there's no other there's no greater age
[1:20:58] to live in than this age
[1:21:00] because we have all the truth
[1:21:02] but too much is given much is required
[1:21:06] John Wesley's message the same
[1:21:10] you had to live a Sanctified life
[1:21:12] it was the expansion of the missionary
[1:21:15] work and it's really no different in
[1:21:16] this age that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:21:19] yesterday today and forever we must
[1:21:21] receive Christ's inner life to be the
[1:21:24] same as when he walked on the Earth
[1:21:28] brother Brandon said in the message end
[1:21:30] time evangelism he said the end time
[1:21:33] message is to get the bride ready
[1:21:37] and prepared for the rapture
[1:21:41] can't be any more plain than that
[1:21:43] Revelations 10 7 but in the days of the
[1:21:46] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:21:49] begin the sound the mystery of God
[1:21:51] should be finished if he had declared to
[1:21:53] his servants of the prophets
[1:21:56] we're not looking for anything else we
[1:21:58] don't need any more knowledge
[1:22:00] we're not looking for something new to
[1:22:03] come
[1:22:04] we're not even looking for ministers to
[1:22:07] get up here and give us anything new
[1:22:09] and if that ever happens be careful
[1:22:14] they're to dig down
[1:22:16] and pull out the Nuggets of what was
[1:22:19] said out here
[1:22:20] that's what they're to do
[1:22:26] is it okay if I
[1:22:29] quote a lot of quotes here
[1:22:33] evening the evening messenger brother
[1:22:35] Brandon says notice the evening
[1:22:36] messenger his job will to will be to get
[1:22:40] the Saints ready they're bride ready for
[1:22:42] the bridegroom
[1:22:44] that will be his message
[1:22:47] now
[1:22:49] do you want to learn your ABCs so you
[1:22:51] can go study algebra later he asked the
[1:22:54] question
[1:22:55] do you want to learn these simple things
[1:22:57] that we that we're talking about so you
[1:22:58] can go on to do the algebra
[1:23:04] and then he describes the algebra what
[1:23:06] these other seals on the back is open
[1:23:08] the they'll only be revealed to them
[1:23:13] thank you
[1:23:15] if you do not take
[1:23:18] and start putting everything into what
[1:23:21] God has already shown you we call them
[1:23:23] ABCs
[1:23:27] brother Branham says you're not going to
[1:23:29] be able to receive the revelation of the
[1:23:32] algebra
[1:23:34] and we need the whole word to make it
[1:23:39] that's why I'm digging into these quotes
[1:23:40] So
[1:23:42] you can hear it from the prophet he said
[1:23:43] that's right when these other seals on
[1:23:46] the on the back is open there'll only be
[1:23:49] revealed to them that's right so learn
[1:23:51] your able ABC's first what is an ABC
[1:23:54] always believe Christ
[1:23:57] see believe what he says not what
[1:23:59] somebody else says
[1:24:04] United Signing Time United time and sign
[1:24:07] brother Brandon said but there's one
[1:24:09] little thing that's lacking in the
[1:24:11] church and he's referring to the uniting
[1:24:13] of the church with the word
[1:24:16] now the uniting time is at hand for God
[1:24:18] is getting the church together to be
[1:24:20] raptured to go into the wedding for the
[1:24:22] great Union but God and man will unite
[1:24:25] together when creatures of time Unite
[1:24:28] with the Eternal it was once done in the
[1:24:31] form of the son of man on Earth and he
[1:24:33] had to give his life to bring about a
[1:24:36] power to unite other men with the same
[1:24:38] power for the Bride of Jesus Christ I
[1:24:41] was referring to the Holy Ghost now and
[1:24:43] now the church is uniting itself
[1:24:46] to the body of Christ so it it's got
[1:24:50] itself free cut away from every little
[1:24:52] freder getting itself ready getting
[1:24:55] together uniting among them all a love
[1:24:58] and a joy and the Holy Spirit moving
[1:25:01] among them oh my what a time now that is
[1:25:05] what we should be seeing in our life
[1:25:08] a love and a joy and a holy spirit
[1:25:11] moving amongst us and if it ain't
[1:25:13] happening in our heart it's hard to be
[1:25:15] happening in our manifestation
[1:25:18] the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:25:20] Christ brothers and that's my message to
[1:25:22] you Church
[1:25:24] you that's a union a spiritual union
[1:25:28] by the word
[1:25:29] by the word is how we become Unified
[1:25:33] and you're dead to your old husband
[1:25:34] you're born Anew don't try to dig them
[1:25:37] up he's dead if you're born again
[1:25:39] Christian that little germ that was
[1:25:41] predestined to you it's word coming on
[1:25:44] word on word on word on word
[1:25:49] and come into the full statue of Christ
[1:25:53] that's right so he can get his bride so
[1:25:57] he can come down and get his bride now
[1:25:59] we're just ready for one thing that's
[1:26:02] the coming of the Lord
[1:26:04] the last thing we need to do is become
[1:26:06] United with the word
[1:26:08] all the word
[1:26:09] now you understand that what I'm
[1:26:11] speaking of the
[1:26:13] people that are in the flesh people that
[1:26:16] are in the the carnal churches out there
[1:26:19] they do not understand that statement
[1:26:22] because they already feel they're United
[1:26:24] with Christ when they repented and got
[1:26:27] baptized they washed their hands of
[1:26:29] anything else they got the most
[1:26:31] important thing done
[1:26:33] and they're comparing themselves with
[1:26:35] somebody who hasn't
[1:26:38] and we need to we need to look at our
[1:26:41] life every time we read something every
[1:26:43] time we hear brother Brandon say
[1:26:45] something every time a minister sits
[1:26:46] behind stands behind this pulpit and
[1:26:48] gives us the word we need to take the
[1:26:50] time to to to look at our lives and see
[1:26:53] if our life is lining up with that word
[1:26:55] we need to unite with the word word word
[1:26:58] word word
[1:27:00] not I I am I am I am
[1:27:03] there's no there's you're you're proving
[1:27:06] which version you are like that
[1:27:10] I'm not judging
[1:27:12] but look Jesus did say you'll know them
[1:27:14] by their fruits
[1:27:17] so if that ain't the fruit tell me what
[1:27:19] the fruit is
[1:27:20] I mean we can see the extremes right we
[1:27:22] can see the extremes but brother Ryan
[1:27:24] said those two Spirits would be so close
[1:27:27] amen that there's only one group of
[1:27:29] people not everybody in the church is
[1:27:30] going to know
[1:27:32] it used to be when they came into this
[1:27:33] message and I learned about this message
[1:27:35] in brother Johnson's church I tell you I
[1:27:38] used to think
[1:27:39] the foolish virgins were all in the
[1:27:41] denominations
[1:27:43] but you know they came out of mixed
[1:27:45] multitude
[1:27:48] just like they did out of Egypt and
[1:27:50] they're really sitting in the messages
[1:27:52] and I don't mean around but some of our
[1:27:54] children that were raising
[1:27:57] they're not being raised in the message
[1:28:01] not the way the message taught
[1:28:09] he said there is your name in The Book
[1:28:11] of Life
[1:28:13] there's your name in The Book of Life
[1:28:14] this really shocked me he said the Book
[1:28:17] of Life is the word of God
[1:28:23] why think about that book that's out
[1:28:25] there
[1:28:27] that's right
[1:28:28] hoping our name is in that
[1:28:31] just take this book
[1:28:33] and put your name in this book
[1:28:38] because if you see it here it'll be
[1:28:40] there
[1:28:42] but if you can't see it here we don't
[1:28:43] want to hope that it's there
[1:28:45] are you with me
[1:28:48] because the word is God and God is the
[1:28:51] only thing that is life
[1:28:53] so your name was represented in the
[1:28:55] Bible before the Bible became become
[1:28:58] unward
[1:29:00] and if you're here
[1:29:02] to do that won't it won't it be
[1:29:04] Vindicated word
[1:29:06] won't the church vindicate itself won't
[1:29:08] Malachi 4 and all these things be
[1:29:10] Vindicated so there is a vindication
[1:29:13] there is a Vindication for us for us
[1:29:17] all right Matthew 24 turn with me here
[1:29:20] is all right if I if you give me some
[1:29:22] some extra time today
[1:29:26] I mean I I did I did
[1:29:29] you know send all those preachers this
[1:29:30] way when I was gone
[1:29:33] so give me a little time uh because I
[1:29:37] won't be preaching this is I think maybe
[1:29:38] I got one service next Sunday to preach
[1:29:41] and that's it we got just visiting
[1:29:43] ministers coming Matthew 24 verse 42
[1:29:46] watch
[1:29:47] watch that really means to be vigilant
[1:29:49] or to keep awake
[1:29:51] therefore watch therefore for you know
[1:29:53] not what hour your Lord come
[1:29:55] and know this that the good man of the
[1:29:57] house had known in what watch the thief
[1:30:00] were to come he would have watched and
[1:30:02] would not have suffered his house to be
[1:30:03] broken up
[1:30:05] therefore be also ready for in such an
[1:30:07] hours you think not the son of man
[1:30:09] cometh who then is a faithful and a wise
[1:30:11] servant who then is a faithful
[1:30:15] and a wife serve that's the question
[1:30:17] whom his Lord have made him rule over
[1:30:20] his household to give them meat in due
[1:30:23] season okay
[1:30:31] who are you
[1:30:33] who are you
[1:30:34] you are a soul brother by Adam
[1:30:36] where does your soul live
[1:30:40] inside of your body
[1:30:43] now you have to feed your soul you have
[1:30:47] to give
[1:30:48] your soul spiritual meat in due season
[1:30:53] and you have to be faithful to do that
[1:30:55] men
[1:30:56] look at these scriptures here who the
[1:30:59] who is his whom his Lord had made him
[1:31:01] rule over his household to give him meet
[1:31:05] them meet in due season now this is a
[1:31:08] faithful and a wise servant to me a
[1:31:10] faithful and a wise servant he is
[1:31:11] digging in that word he's applying
[1:31:14] himself into the word you don't have to
[1:31:16] be behind the pulpit to get in love with
[1:31:18] the word amen
[1:31:20] amen blessed is that servant whom his
[1:31:22] Lord when he cometh shall find Soul
[1:31:27] doing he's given us he's given us a clue
[1:31:31] what it means to be ready
[1:31:33] verily I say unto you that he shall make
[1:31:35] him ruler over all his Goods but but and
[1:31:40] if that evil servant shall say in his
[1:31:44] heart
[1:31:45] and there's no need to do that
[1:31:49] because he's not coming tomorrow it's
[1:31:51] delayed a little bit
[1:31:54] okay see how tricky that is we would not
[1:31:57] just come out and say those words
[1:31:59] but that spirit and those thoughts can
[1:32:01] get on us
[1:32:03] and shall begin to Smite his fellow
[1:32:06] servants
[1:32:07] and to eat and drink with a drunkard no
[1:32:12] wonder God wants us to love one another
[1:32:17] to be filled with the love of God
[1:32:21] to forgive one another to to
[1:32:25] wash one another's feet to care about
[1:32:27] one another to take an opportunity when
[1:32:31] somebody smikes you on the face to love
[1:32:33] them back to turn a cheek
[1:32:38] because as soon as I don't need to do
[1:32:40] that and you can Smite a fellow servant
[1:32:43] you know
[1:32:44] with your thoughts
[1:32:47] just your thoughts
[1:32:50] and today I don't need to be any better
[1:32:52] that's eating and drinking with the
[1:32:53] drunkard
[1:32:55] the Lord of that servant shall come in a
[1:32:57] day when he looked not for him and in an
[1:33:00] hour that you
[1:33:01] that he is not aware of I'll tell you if
[1:33:04] we knew the Lord was coming
[1:33:08] five days ago
[1:33:09] or today where we have done what we did
[1:33:12] the last two days
[1:33:14] think about that statement
[1:33:16] so it's a different way of thinking and
[1:33:17] she'll cut him asunder and appoint him
[1:33:20] his portion with the Hypocrites there
[1:33:21] shall be weeping and gnashing the teeth
[1:33:23] and brother Branham taught us that's the
[1:33:25] tribulation amen
[1:33:27] all right first Thessalonians chapter
[1:33:29] five first lesson chapter five but of
[1:33:32] the times and the seasons Brethren you
[1:33:34] have no need that I write unto you for
[1:33:36] yourself know perfectly that the day of
[1:33:38] the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[1:33:41] night
[1:33:42] he's not a thief but he comes as a thief
[1:33:45] he doesn't tell anybody
[1:33:47] and when they shall say peace and safety
[1:33:50] everything's going to be okay
[1:33:52] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[1:33:55] as travail on a woman with child and
[1:33:57] there and they shall not Escape but ye
[1:33:59] Brethren are not in darkness that that
[1:34:03] they should overtake you as a thief
[1:34:05] ye are all the children of light
[1:34:08] and the children of the day and we are
[1:34:11] not the of the night nor the darkness
[1:34:13] therefore let us not sleep as do others
[1:34:17] but let us watch let's be sober for they
[1:34:21] that sleep sleep in the night and day
[1:34:23] they'll be drunken or drunken in the
[1:34:24] night but let us now that are of the day
[1:34:27] be sober putting on the breastplate of
[1:34:29] faith and love for the helmet the hope
[1:34:31] of salvation
[1:34:32] for God have not appointed us
[1:34:35] to Wrath
[1:34:37] but until to obtain salvation by
[1:34:41] our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us
[1:34:44] whether we wake or sleep we should live
[1:34:47] together with him we're for Comfort
[1:34:49] yourselves together and edify one
[1:34:52] another even as you do so I'll say it
[1:34:55] like this hey let's do some more and
[1:34:58] some more edifying
[1:35:00] come on
[1:35:01] amen let's do some more edifying there's
[1:35:03] a lot of things we can talk about
[1:35:06] a lot of things we can share
[1:35:08] but let's satisfy one another
[1:35:10] we need to help get one another ready
[1:35:13] for the rapture
[1:35:15] all right now what measuring stick are
[1:35:17] we using
[1:35:18] to see if we're ready for a Rapture I
[1:35:20] wanna I want
[1:35:21] I want us to ask that question what
[1:35:23] measuring stick are we using
[1:35:26] brother Brandon said in the Israel and
[1:35:28] the church
[1:35:30] he said that the five foolish versions
[1:35:32] were a clean living people
[1:35:34] they didn't go to dances they didn't go
[1:35:36] to shows they didn't smolt they didn't
[1:35:38] drink they went to church they shouted
[1:35:39] they jumped they spoke in tongues
[1:35:43] but it's not any fleshly demonstration
[1:35:46] or emotion he said he said that's not
[1:35:48] the answer
[1:35:49] he said there must be a supernatural
[1:35:51] change in the whole nature
[1:35:53] a supernatural change in the whole
[1:35:57] nature
[1:35:59] so I know I've been changed a little bit
[1:36:02] but I'd only be foolish
[1:36:05] to say
[1:36:06] I've changed completely
[1:36:11] so now that thought just puts me in a
[1:36:13] sober state to dig in
[1:36:15] a sober state to you know press in
[1:36:18] towards the the mark
[1:36:23] let me just say this
[1:36:28] if Jesus doesn't tell anybody when he's
[1:36:31] coming
[1:36:35] there's a reason for it
[1:36:40] there's a reason that a prophet
[1:36:44] after surrendering his life to God and
[1:36:47] the road to Damascus
[1:36:50] and once churched out the thing
[1:36:55] and and repented got baptized and said
[1:36:58] okay
[1:36:59] I see now
[1:37:01] that after 33 years of his life he was
[1:37:03] still pressing in
[1:37:05] there's a reason that that's there
[1:37:10] and during his pressing in
[1:37:13] he was still reaching out still given
[1:37:15] the gospel out still trying to win souls
[1:37:18] he was he was trying to become all
[1:37:20] things to all men that he might win some
[1:37:23] now I understand there's going to be
[1:37:25] more people that hurt you and use you
[1:37:28] don't listen to you
[1:37:32] than ever help you
[1:37:35] that's just the way of Christianity you
[1:37:37] can't do nothing about that
[1:37:39] Paul knew that but he still said I
[1:37:42] become all things to all men that I
[1:37:44] might just win some
[1:37:51] brother Brandon said there's going to be
[1:37:54] a separation
[1:37:55] and God will separate the lukewarm
[1:37:58] church member that is only impersonating
[1:38:01] Christianity
[1:38:03] he said the lukewarm church member is
[1:38:06] only impersonating Christianity
[1:38:09] the sun secret going away of the church
[1:38:11] brother and said virgin means Purity
[1:38:13] they were all good people every one of
[1:38:15] them virgins Sanctified vessels of God
[1:38:17] people that you couldn't put your finger
[1:38:19] on for anything wrong wow
[1:38:23] they every one of them believed in the
[1:38:25] coming of the Lord
[1:38:26] they were ready to go meet him but some
[1:38:29] of them let their oil get out
[1:38:33] they had oil they let their oil get out
[1:38:35] that's why we need to keep getting oil
[1:38:38] it's awful quiet in here I'm just
[1:38:40] reading the quotes
[1:38:42] don't let that be your case keep oil on
[1:38:45] your lamp oil is the spirit the Holy
[1:38:47] Spirit never let it drain from you when
[1:38:49] you feel your love dying away your
[1:38:52] sincerity to Christ and to the cause
[1:38:55] quickly go to him who has the Fountain
[1:38:58] of oil and buy for yourself a filling of
[1:39:01] the Holy Ghost
[1:39:03] I just love that he gave me a track to
[1:39:06] run on
[1:39:08] handwriting on the wall brother and said
[1:39:10] in five were still virgins but but we're
[1:39:13] foolish virgins he said they didn't keep
[1:39:15] oil in their land
[1:39:20] the sudden secret going away at the
[1:39:22] church for the brand also went on to see
[1:39:23] be also ready according Jesus for you
[1:39:25] know not what minute or hour your lord
[1:39:28] does come be ready for you can't get
[1:39:30] ready then
[1:39:33] you can't get ready then
[1:39:37] he said you could not so in other words
[1:39:40] ready or not here I come
[1:39:44] oh my
[1:39:45] now I want you to know
[1:39:48] um
[1:39:50] I I just have to skip a lot but I can't
[1:39:53] skip at all
[1:39:56] but I will say this
[1:39:57] if you dig into that message you'll see
[1:39:59] these things
[1:40:03] in the patna's vision brother Ram says
[1:40:05] now I want to ask you something I'm
[1:40:07] speaking to the lukewarm Church
[1:40:10] where the Bible says where if the
[1:40:12] righteous will scarcely be saved where
[1:40:14] will the Sinner and the ungodly person
[1:40:15] appear
[1:40:18] the one who rejects who knows better and
[1:40:20] then rejects it where will he appear
[1:40:22] he says his feet
[1:40:24] like brass Divine judgment
[1:40:27] he says all right
[1:40:30] The Voice we heard about following the
[1:40:33] voice right
[1:40:34] following the way of the lord The Voice
[1:40:35] from from Brother Daniel what a horrible
[1:40:38] thing for a drifting soul on this sea of
[1:40:40] life
[1:40:41] no pilot to guide them loose floating
[1:40:43] with the ties to hear the Roar of the
[1:40:46] great cataracts The Falls what a
[1:40:47] horrible thing it would be for to a soul
[1:40:50] drifting the voice of many Waters
[1:40:53] brother John why are you reading that
[1:40:55] because I want us to get to this what is
[1:40:57] The Voice
[1:41:01] it's the judgment
[1:41:03] the voice of ministers
[1:41:09] through the Holy Spirit that's cried out
[1:41:12] to the people in every age standing
[1:41:14] there the voice of many Waters Cried Out
[1:41:17] thickness and multitude the voice of
[1:41:19] those seven stars in the hand to every
[1:41:21] Church age preaching the baptism of the
[1:41:23] Holy Ghost the baptism in Jesus name
[1:41:25] speak in tongues the power of God the
[1:41:27] resurrection of Christ the second coming
[1:41:28] Divine judgment the voice of many Waters
[1:41:30] came forth from this one that looked
[1:41:33] like the son of man many Waters
[1:41:35] what it'll be to know that you sit in
[1:41:38] you sat in the meetings and heard
[1:41:40] that you should get right with God and
[1:41:43] receive the Holy Spirit and a drifting
[1:41:45] soul to hear that voice speak out in the
[1:41:47] meetings that you sat in and heard the
[1:41:49] judgments of God preached and refused it
[1:41:51] the great fall is just below you the
[1:41:53] great cataracts it'll take you to the
[1:41:55] Eternal Doom the voice of many Waters
[1:41:57] when we come to church and we hear
[1:42:00] ministers stand behind the pulpit and
[1:42:03] preach to us in that Prophet when we
[1:42:06] listen to the tapes
[1:42:08] it is the Divine Judgment of God to the
[1:42:11] to the bride
[1:42:14] it is the Divine Judgment of God to the
[1:42:16] bride because that is her white Throne
[1:42:20] judgment
[1:42:22] she takes the word and corrects herself
[1:42:25] willingly through three more agency
[1:42:28] see it isn't to the foolish virgin
[1:42:32] it isn't to everybody else they get the
[1:42:34] white Throne judgment afterwards and
[1:42:36] brother Adam says they'll hear the same
[1:42:37] words come back and Echo them
[1:42:40] it's a privilege for us
[1:42:42] to to allow ourselves to be judged by
[1:42:45] the word of God today and every time we
[1:42:47] come to church it's an honor
[1:42:50] to be washed by the word
[1:42:55] now
[1:42:56] brother Graham said no matter what
[1:42:59] the Bradham Tabernacle ever turns out to
[1:43:03] be
[1:43:04] he says don't you let it be you
[1:43:10] the message wasn't Bradham Tabernacle
[1:43:15] the the message wasn't what the people
[1:43:18] that were closest to brother Brandon
[1:43:19] what they thought
[1:43:20] the message was the message is what
[1:43:23] brother ran and brought
[1:43:25] he says don't let it be you you be a
[1:43:27] servant of Christ
[1:43:29] no matter what their Church does you be
[1:43:31] a servant of Christ it's not up to
[1:43:34] Brandon Tab and I go neither is it up to
[1:43:36] any other church it's up to you as an
[1:43:38] individual to be ready at the coming of
[1:43:41] the Lord
[1:43:43] you must be ready I must be ready I'll
[1:43:46] sweep my own steps
[1:43:49] it's up to you to sweep your own steps
[1:43:51] leave mine alone
[1:43:54] me leave yours alone
[1:43:56] you've got to make your garment ready
[1:44:00] see we must the first thing we must do
[1:44:03] is we must identify that spirit that
[1:44:06] tells us uh you don't have nothing to do
[1:44:09] that message for somebody else you've
[1:44:12] got to identify that because if you you
[1:44:14] you listen to that thing you won't be
[1:44:17] trying any more than you have been this
[1:44:19] message was sent to stir us
[1:44:21] and I know it's not an Evangelistic
[1:44:23] message and I don't want you to be
[1:44:24] stirred for a little bit and leave and
[1:44:26] then I want it to be real to you
[1:44:29] next week next month and keep it going
[1:44:32] until the coming of the Lord amen
[1:44:36] my my
[1:44:40] all right
[1:44:41] I'm on your side I'm not reading a lot
[1:44:45] of the stuff
[1:44:48] but I want you to know
[1:44:52] that I did spend a lot of time studying
[1:44:54] for you
[1:45:01] uh I got to I got to read this and the
[1:45:04] conflict between God and Satan
[1:45:06] brother Brandon said fire
[1:45:09] is the confirmation of the light coming
[1:45:13] from the word
[1:45:15] so when we're burning
[1:45:18] it's a confirmation
[1:45:20] that the light from the word has come to
[1:45:22] you
[1:45:23] the smart version the wise virgin had
[1:45:26] oil in her lamp
[1:45:28] she trimmed her lamp and lit it
[1:45:31] now what is it God is the word the oil
[1:45:34] is the spirit and the fire is the gospel
[1:45:37] lit on the oil
[1:45:39] the fire is the gospel lit on the oil
[1:45:41] God said so that's the vessel all right
[1:45:45] the oil is in the vessel and the fire is
[1:45:48] burning it it shows that it's reflecting
[1:45:50] the light of what's what of what the
[1:45:53] word said
[1:45:54] that's the reflection now the wise
[1:45:56] virgin could do that but the other the
[1:45:59] foolish version was on the outside they
[1:46:01] had no aisle no oil and they couldn't
[1:46:05] reflect nothing but
[1:46:07] the church
[1:46:11] we're all reflecting you can't project
[1:46:14] something you can't get warm by a pain
[1:46:16] in fire right
[1:46:17] you can only project what's on the
[1:46:19] inside
[1:46:21] the true bride must be United by the
[1:46:24] word
[1:46:25] now remember if she's part of Christ she
[1:46:28] has to be the word of Christ
[1:46:34] has to be
[1:46:36] has to be and I'm just going to read a
[1:46:39] few more of these is that okay
[1:46:41] all right thank you for your patience
[1:46:44] with me
[1:46:47] in the message of the Rapture this is
[1:46:50] basically the last month of brother
[1:46:52] branham's
[1:46:53] uh one of his last message in in
[1:46:56] November
[1:46:57] of army December of 65. he says if
[1:47:00] you're in Christ
[1:47:02] there's not a word written in here but
[1:47:05] what you believe it
[1:47:09] I don't care what anybody else said
[1:47:12] and then God makes that thing manifested
[1:47:15] in other words if you truly believe the
[1:47:17] word it will become manifest in your
[1:47:18] life
[1:47:20] because you
[1:47:21] when he pours the spirit upon the word
[1:47:24] what happens it's like putting water on
[1:47:27] any other seed it'll live it'll bring
[1:47:29] forth of its kind
[1:47:31] now you say I got the baptism of the
[1:47:33] Holy Ghost he says that don't mean that
[1:47:35] you're saved
[1:47:37] not by a long ways
[1:47:40] this is the last last
[1:47:43] month of his life he just preached the
[1:47:46] minute his his message
[1:47:49] and he says by you saying I got the
[1:47:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost that doesn't
[1:47:53] mean that you're saved not by a long
[1:47:55] ways he looky here he says you're a
[1:47:57] Triune being you are inside this little
[1:48:00] fella in here is a soul
[1:48:02] the next is the spirit and the next is
[1:48:05] the body
[1:48:06] now you got the five senses of the body
[1:48:10] to contact the Earthly home
[1:48:12] they don't contact the rest you've got
[1:48:15] five senses of the spirit here love
[1:48:17] conscious and so forth of that but here
[1:48:20] is where you live that's where you are
[1:48:24] didn't Jesus say the rain falls on the
[1:48:26] just and the unjust
[1:48:28] you put a cockapoo out there and a weed
[1:48:30] out there and pour water in them and
[1:48:32] keep them under the fertilizer and
[1:48:33] things like that won't they both live by
[1:48:35] the same water well sure what is it one
[1:48:38] of them
[1:48:40] because that's all it is the
[1:48:43] cockerborough will raise his hands and
[1:48:44] shout and just the same as the wheat
[1:48:46] unless that was God's seed his Gene from
[1:48:50] the beginning predestinated you're
[1:48:52] finished I don't care how much you shout
[1:48:53] speak in tongues run shout and that
[1:48:57] doesn't have anything to do with it now
[1:49:00] this is what he said I want to get to
[1:49:01] this he said it's your heart
[1:49:04] in that word
[1:49:06] it's your heart in that word that's
[1:49:09] Christ
[1:49:10] bring in there and watch it make itself
[1:49:13] known as it opens up like any other seed
[1:49:16] and declares itself for the agent that
[1:49:19] is living in
[1:49:21] oh my
[1:49:24] isn't that beautiful
[1:49:27] he said Esther purged her heart before
[1:49:31] God
[1:49:32] and you can stand up if you want to
[1:49:34] stand up Esther purged her heart before
[1:49:36] God walked up with a Meek and humble
[1:49:39] spirit
[1:49:40] the church that's going to be the bride
[1:49:42] of Christ now remember Esther refused
[1:49:44] the worldly adornment she took the
[1:49:46] spirit in her heart to go before the
[1:49:49] king
[1:49:50] it's a sweet kind reverent Spirit to the
[1:49:54] word of God
[1:49:56] Washed by the Water of the word
[1:49:59] and that word's in you it's washing amen
[1:50:02] the church needs a washing a Full Gospel
[1:50:05] washing that's right not just a part
[1:50:07] washing but a Full Gospel washing clean
[1:50:11] up made new creatures in Christ Jesus
[1:50:15] now God don't look at members he's
[1:50:18] hunting character
[1:50:20] and that's what he places his word in
[1:50:22] somebody that'll believe him as I said
[1:50:24] the other night
[1:50:26] Eliezer squatted it out to till he found
[1:50:28] character for the bride
[1:50:31] uh for the bride that he had to make her
[1:50:35] stand still in order to get her dressed
[1:50:38] to meet the one they were talking
[1:50:42] about
[1:50:44] remember when brother Branham had that
[1:50:46] vision
[1:50:47] and he saw the bride get out of line
[1:50:50] remember that
[1:50:53] praise the Lord
[1:50:55] now to keep the things cool for uh
[1:51:00] for the for the hot people
[1:51:05] and
[1:51:07] he screamed out
[1:51:09] get back in line amen now he wasn't
[1:51:12] saying you're not bride
[1:51:14] he was speaking to the bride that got
[1:51:16] out of line
[1:51:17] and he screamed back get back in line
[1:51:21] this message when ministers come and are
[1:51:24] preaching this same message get back in
[1:51:27] line
[1:51:29] get back to where God has shown you
[1:51:30] because the devil is constantly drawing
[1:51:33] us away
[1:51:35] we have a message to get us ready
[1:51:39] and it's up to us the bride have his
[1:51:42] wife have made herself ready I can't do
[1:51:45] that for you
[1:51:47] the fivefold ministry can't do that for
[1:51:49] you they can present you with what God
[1:51:53] speaks to you but unless you believe it
[1:51:55] is personally for you and take it into
[1:51:58] your life and that you're serious with
[1:52:00] it it can't get you ready
[1:52:03] so may the Lord just Lift us up with a
[1:52:08] determination to ask for more of the

[2:10:12] Lord
[2:10:13] thank you Jesus

[2:10:19] you say Amen
[2:10:21] amen let's be in prayer for the
[2:10:24] some more special services coming up and
[2:10:27] uh we're always always good to have
[2:10:29] brother uh Daryl with us he's just a
[2:10:33] such a fine
[2:10:34] fine-spirited uh brother and I just love
[2:10:39] him I love them so much and let's pray
[2:10:43] uh for not only
[2:10:46] the services and the ministry and US
[2:10:48] hearing it to receive Revelation but
[2:10:50] would you pray with me for new Souls
[2:10:54] I got a commitment for one family amen
[2:10:57] I'm hoping for another and I got a
[2:10:59] neighbor that I want to see come and so
[2:11:01] if we all just do our part
[2:11:04] the part that Christ has asked us to do
[2:11:06] and to to to bring them up to go out
[2:11:09] bring them in give them a chance to hear
[2:11:12] the gospel because brother Daryl give us
[2:11:14] the gospel
[2:11:16] and give them a chance to be saved your
[2:11:19] laborers just to get a one Soul ten
[2:11:21] thousand worlds so let's be in special
[2:11:23] prayer for those people that are
[2:11:26] becoming to these Services we not only
[2:11:29] want revelation but we want them to
[2:11:31] receive it too
[2:11:33] I want to say I appreciate my wife
[2:11:36] you know I I hear that brother Paul
[2:11:39] calls his wife the eighth wonder of the
[2:11:42] world
[2:11:46] so
[2:11:48] but she is a wonder and she's a Wonder
[2:11:51] to me
[2:11:53] I wouldn't be here without her
[2:11:56] and I said honestly unless you're a
[2:11:59] pastor and I think there's one here
[2:12:03] unless you're a pastor you do not
[2:12:04] understand
[2:12:06] the pressure on a pastor
[2:12:09] you don't
[2:12:10] is it different than any of the other uh
[2:12:13] of course the prophet had a tremendous
[2:12:16] nothing compared to what the prophet
[2:12:18] went through
[2:12:20] but
[2:12:23] there are so many attacks so many
[2:12:25] burdens
[2:12:27] so many things that is required
[2:12:30] and she is literally giving up her life
[2:12:34] for me to be able to serve that's
[2:12:37] exactly what's happened
[2:12:39] and it whatever she asked me to do and I
[2:12:42] tell her this all the time it's a nun or
[2:12:44] whatever she asks
[2:12:46] but it doesn't even come close to what
[2:12:48] she deserves now I do believe that she
[2:12:50] has a reward coming on the other side
[2:12:53] God is Not forgetful to forget our labor
[2:12:56] of love is that right amen and I I
[2:13:01] failed to say at the beginning but I
[2:13:03] haven't failed to think about it
[2:13:04] throughout the service it's such a
[2:13:06] blessing to have brother and sister
[2:13:08] Johnson
[2:13:09] it's always a blessing to have brother
[2:13:12] and sister Johnson we love you so very
[2:13:14] much
[2:13:14] and just appreciate all that you have
[2:13:17] done for us
[2:13:20] for the kingdom of God and oh the half
[2:13:24] hasn't been told the eighth hasn't been
[2:13:25] told
[2:13:26] and what's beautiful about when you when
[2:13:29] you you save Souls right because brother
[2:13:31] Johnson has saved Souls they that save
[2:13:34] Soul they that win souls is wise right
[2:13:36] and what happens is that Soul now goes
[2:13:39] and tells another Soul so you're
[2:13:41] attached to people you don't even know
[2:13:44] and we just appreciate
[2:13:47] so much brother and sister Johnson amen
[2:13:50] amen if it's if it's okay and I just if
[2:13:53] it's okay to announce it I Brother Bruce

[2:13:58] Wednesday

[2:14:02] amen amen
[2:14:05] amen

[2:14:15] the service but then
[2:14:17] you know we all wouldn't know but now
[2:14:19] that we know we can be praying for him
[2:14:21] and I know he'd appreciate that amen I
[2:14:25] wouldn't have said that if I didn't feel
[2:14:26] you would just so you know I respect you
