[4:04] Peace like a

[5:56] Let your
[5:58] fire
[6:01] fall. Amen. Amen. You have to believe
[6:05] that. Amen. I ask brother Orlando if you
[6:08] just open in a word of
[6:18] prayer. Our
[7:00] Praise and worship.
[7:29] Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[7:32] Amen. At the cross. Amen.
[7:37] Alas, did my Savior bleed? And did my
[7:44] sovereign
[7:46] die? Would he devote that sacred head
[7:52] for such a worm as
[7:56] I at the cross? At the cross where I
[8:00] first saw the light and the burden of my
[8:04] heart rolled
[8:07] away. It was there by faith. I received
[8:12] my sight. And now I am happy all the
[8:17] day. Was it for crimes that I have done?
[8:23] They grown upon the
[8:28] tree.
[8:29] Amazing pity. Praise unknown and love
[8:35] beyond
[8:37] decree. At the cross, at the cross where
[8:41] I first saw the light and the burden of
[8:45] my heart go away.
[8:49] It was there by faith I received my
[8:53] sight and now I am happy all the
[8:58] day. Well might the son in darkness hide
[9:04] and shut his glory in.
[9:09] and Christ the mighty maker died for man
[9:15] the creature
[9:18] sin. At the cross at the cross where I
[9:22] first saw the light and the burden of my
[9:26] heart rolled
[9:28] away. It was there by faith. I received
[9:33] my sight. And now I am happy all the
[9:38] day. But drops of grief can dare repay.
[9:44] The debt of love I
[9:48] hold. Dear Lord, I give
[9:52] myself away is all that I can
[9:58] do. At the cross. At the cross where thy
[10:02] first saw the light and the burden of my
[10:06] heart go
[10:08] away. It was there by faith. I received
[10:13] my sight. And now I am happy all the
[10:18] day. At the cross, at the cross where I
[10:23] first saw the light and the burden of my
[10:26] heart rolled away.
[10:30] It was there by faith. I receive my
[10:34] sight and now I am happy all the
[10:39] day. Amen.
[10:42] Amen. All hail the power of Jesus.
[10:48] Amen. All hail the power of Jesus name.

[12:38] terrestrial
[12:40] ball to him all

[13:16] everlasting song and crown him
[13:22] Lord of
[13:24] all. will join the
[13:28] everlasting song and crown him
[13:33] Lord of all.
[13:36] Hail him the heirs of David's line who

[13:57] The God incarnate him and divine and
[14:03] crown him
[14:06] Lord of
[14:09] all. Amen. Amen.
[14:13] He's my king. Amen. Love lifted me. I'm
[14:17] so glad for that. Amen.
[14:21] I was sinking deep in sin, firm from the
[14:27] peaceful
[14:30] shore, buried deeply stained within,
[14:35] sinking to rise no more.
[14:40] But the master of the sea heard my
[14:46] desparing
[14:48] cry from the water lifted me now safe am
[14:57] I. Love lifted me.
[15:03] Love lifted
[15:06] me when nothing else could help. Love
[15:13] lifted
[15:16] me. Love lifted
[15:20] me. Love lifted
[15:25] me when nothing else could help.
[15:31] Love
[15:32] lifted
[15:35] me all my heart. To him I give. Ever to
[15:42] him I'll
[15:44] cling. In his blessed presence live.
[15:50] Ever his praises sing.
[15:54] Love so mighty and so true merits my
[15:59] soul's best
[16:02] song. Faithful loving service to him
[16:11] belongs. Love lifted
[16:15] me. Love lifted me.
[16:21] And nothing else could help. Love lifted
[16:29] me. Love lifted
[16:33] me. Love lifted
[16:38] me. When nothing else could help.
[16:44] Love lifted me.
[16:49] Souls in danger look
[16:53] above. Jesus completely
[16:57] saves. He will lift you by his love out
[17:03] of the angry
[17:06] waves. He's the master of the sea.
[17:12] Willows his will obey.
[17:15] [Music]
[17:17] Your savior wants to be be saved to
[17:24] today. Love lifted
[17:28] me. Love lifted
[17:33] me when nothing else could help. Love
[17:39] lifted
[17:42] me. Love lifted me.
[17:47] Love lifted
[17:51] me when nothing else could help.
[17:57] Love
[17:59] lifted
[18:02] me. Amen. Amen.
[18:05] I'm glad for that. I'm also glad that
[18:08] it's not conditional.
[18:12] I always say my love with Donna is
[18:15] conditional. She says if you don't do
[18:16] this,
[18:19] but God doesn't do that. When you come
[18:21] to Calvary and you give your heart to
[18:26] him, I got you. When you're down and
[18:29] out, I got you. Amen. When you don't
[18:32] have faith, I got you. Jesus will stick
[18:36] close. Amen. He will He will do great
[18:38] things. Amen. So, we take up our prayer
[18:41] requests this morning. Sister Linda
[18:44] Beckman says, "Please pray for Naomi and
[18:47] her sons, James and Luke."
[18:50] Um, they just went through a divorce.
[18:53] So, she's having problems in the
[18:57] house. You know, the devil likes to come
[18:59] in like a
[19:00] flood, turn everything upside down, and
[19:03] make you think God can't do anything for
[19:06] you. He's powerless.
[19:08] But just remember, I got you. Amen. Love
[19:12] lifted me. Amen.
[19:15] Amen. Um, the Lord called Bob Koba home
[19:20] on
[19:21] uh Friday morning, I think it was. So, I
[19:25] want to pray for Anna that the Lord will
[19:28] give her strength.
[19:31] Um, they've been married for 44
[19:35] years.
[19:37] So, that's a pretty good hole, man. Also
[19:41] remember, Brother Johnson. Um, he was in
[19:45] intensive care. I I think he's in normal
[19:49] uh a normal room at U of M. I sat with
[19:53] him for a couple hours on Friday.
[19:57] Uh they were trying to get his vitals
[20:00] and everything to get in the right
[20:02] place. They were kind of all messed up
[20:04] and he was
[20:05] delirious. Um didn't know where he was
[20:09] at.
[20:13] But while he was there, we were by
[20:17] ourselves. I got out my song book
[20:19] because I had to get my songs for today.
[20:21] So I had my song book with me. I started
[20:24] singing, "I'll meet you in the
[20:27] morning." Of course, I started crying.
[20:30] And then I said, "Lord," I said, "Come
[20:31] on, Brother Johnson, sing with me." He
[20:34] calmed right down. I sang about three or
[20:37] four songs with him. Um, then, you know,
[20:41] staff has to do what they do. But
[20:43] remember, Brother Johnson and Sister
[20:45] Johnson, you know, you get closer to
[20:48] home. The Lord has chosen the path we
[20:51] must tread. He's chosen the door we have
[20:54] to go through. We think, you know, maybe
[20:58] God will do something
[21:00] different, but we just have to pray,
[21:03] "Let thy will be done." Amen. So, let's
[21:07] remember Anna and Brother Johnson,
[21:10] Sister Linda Helms for strength that God
[21:14] will just get control of her heart and
[21:17] the problems that she's having.
[21:20] Remember
[21:21] Naomi. Remember the unspoken
[21:25] requests. Each and every one of us got
[21:27] something that we're thinking, "Lord, I
[21:29] sure wish you'd do something about
[21:30] this." Amen. Put your trust in
[21:34] him. He doesn't fail. Amen. Let's all
[21:37] stand together. Let's just pray. Let's
[21:40] just join our voices together. Dear Lord
[21:43] Jesus, we're so thankful, Lord, for your
[21:45] love. We're thankful for your mercy and
[21:47] your grace. Heavenly Father, we just
[21:50] pray you'll just come. You've heard each
[21:53] and every one of these requests. Father,
[21:54] we just pray for brother and sister
[21:56] Beckman's daughter Naomi. We just pray
[21:59] you'll give her supernatural strength,
[22:01] Father, and that you'll come against
[22:03] those spirits that are causing
[22:05] contention in the house, Lord. May you
[22:07] just move by your spirit in that
[22:09] situation, Lord. Heavenly Father, I pray
[22:12] Lord for Ana. Lord, I pray you'll be
[22:15] comfort and your strength. Lord Jesus, I
[22:18] pray that you just bless her and the
[22:20] family. Remember, brother and sister
[22:22] Johnson, Lord, we pray you'll bless him,
[22:25] Father. Give the doctor's wisdom, Lord,
[22:27] and may you just bless him while he's in
[22:29] the hospital. May you help sister
[22:32] Johnson, Lord, not to worry, Father. I
[22:34] pray you just bless him, Lord Jesus. May
[22:37] you just move by your spirit. Remember
[22:39] Sister Linda Helms, Lord, this morning.
[22:41] Lord Jesus, you know the end from the
[22:44] beginning. And I pray, Father, that
[22:45] you'll just help her in her body, Lord.
[22:48] That you'll strengthen her, Lord.
[22:50] Father, may you just come and bless,
[22:52] Lord Jesus, the unspoken requests, Lord
[22:55] Jesus, the secret things that are in our
[22:57] hearts, Lord. You know the secret
[22:59] things. And I pray, Father, that you
[23:01] just move by your spirit. May you just
[23:03] bless those, Father, that are
[23:05] discouraged. Lord, may you encourage
[23:07] them. May you just, Lord, lift up the
[23:10] hands that are hanging down, Lord.
[23:12] Father, I pray that you just by your
[23:15] bless father, brother Ron, brother
[23:17] Marty, sister Lori as they're away.
[23:20] Father, Sister Anne, Lord, we just pray
[23:22] you'll bless them and keep them. Lord,
[23:25] we pray, Lord, for brother Ferguson and
[23:27] Sister Miriam, Lord, who we haven't
[23:29] seen. Heavenly Father, I pray that you
[23:31] just strengthen them. May you just come
[23:34] bless the missionaries, Lord. Bless the
[23:36] service, Father. Give Brother John,
[23:38] Lord, the words that we have need of in
[23:40] this hour, Lord. We'll give you the
[23:42] praise and the honor and the glory in
[23:44] Jesus Christ's name we ask. Amen. Amen.
[23:48] You may be seated. Amen. Where could I
[23:52] go? Where are you going to go?
[23:56] Right. Living
[23:58] below in this old sinful
[24:02] world. Hardly a comfort can afford.
[24:09] driving alone to face temptation. So
[24:14] where could I go but to the
[24:19] Lord? Where could I go? Oh, where could
[24:24] I
[24:25] go? Seeking a refuge for my
[24:32] soul. A friend to help me in the end.
[24:37] Where could I go but to the
[24:42] Lord? Neighbors are kind. I love them
[24:48] everyone. We get along in sweet
[24:53] accord. But when my soul needs mana from
[24:59] above, where could I go but to the Lord?
[25:06] Where could I go? Oh, where could I
[25:10] go? Seeking a refuge for my
[25:16] soul. Needing a friend to help me in the
[25:21] end. Where could I go but to the
[25:27] Lord? Life here is grand with friends I
[25:31] love so dear.
[25:33] comfort I get from God's own
[25:38] word. Yet when I face the chilling hand
[25:43] of death, where could I go but to the
[25:49] Lord? Where could I go? Oh, where could
[25:54] I
[25:54] go? Seeking a refuge for my soul.
[26:01] needing a friend to help me in the
[26:06] end. Where could I go but to the
[26:11] Lord? Where could I go? Oh, where could
[26:16] I
[26:17] go? Seeking a refuge for my
[26:22] soul. Needing a friend to help me in the
[26:27] end. Where could I go but to the
[26:33] Lord? Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[26:37] Let's all stand together. Amen. I'm
[26:39] going ask brother Dennis if he'll just
[26:41] pray over the um tithes and offerings.
[26:44] Amen. Our precious heavenly father, we
[26:47] come to you through Jesus Christ. And I
[26:49] want to thank you for sending your son
[26:51] that all the sinners could have life
[26:54] eternal with you. God, I ask that you
[26:57] take the offering you do what you wish
[26:59] with it. You'll bless it, multiply it,
[27:02] bless those that give that you'll help
[27:04] them. May they thank you for what you've
[27:07] done for them. May each and every one of
[27:10] us that are born again and we seek to
[27:12] serve you and be more like you. Thank
[27:15] you every day for you looking over us.
[27:18] And may every one of us here learn
[27:21] something today special to help us get
[27:23] closer to you. And may you see us all
[27:26] safely home as we leave here with great
[27:30] gratitude. And we want to thank you
[27:32] again for your son Jesus. We ask these
[27:35] things in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You
[27:39] may be seated. What a fellowship. Amen.

[30:30] arms. Amen. Amen. I'm anchored in Jesus

[35:11] Amen. that we can come to a place. Well,
[35:15] I hope wish my my musicians wouldn't
[35:17] leave so quick all the time. Can we just
[35:20] do one more
[35:22] song?
[35:24] Uh where can we go and and meet Jesus?
[35:29] He said, "Where two or three are
[35:30] gathered together, Amen. in my name,
[35:33] I'll be there in the midst."
[35:35] And I feel in debt that I can come here
[35:37] today and be with my brothers and
[35:39] sisters who possess Jesus Christ. and
[35:42] that just because I'm gathering with
[35:44] you, he said, "I'll be there. I'll be
[35:47] there." I just wanted to sing that
[35:48] little chorus. He paid a debt. He did
[35:51] not
[35:51] [Music]
[35:54] allow. He paid a debt. He did not owe. I
[36:02] owed a debt I could not pay. I needed
[36:09] someone to wash my sins
[36:15] away. And now I sing a brand new song.
[36:22] Amazing grace all day long. Christ Jesus
[36:28] paid. Amen. Let's sing that one more
[36:31] time.
[36:35] He paid a debt he did not owe. I owed a
[36:42] debt I could not pay. I needed
[36:47] someone to wash my sins
[36:54] away. And now I sing a brand new song.
[37:00] Amazing grace. All day long, Christ
[37:05] Jesus paid a debt that I could never
[37:11] pay. Amen. Let's give the Lord a praise
[37:14] offering for paying that debt. Praise
[37:16] you, Jesus. Praise you, Lord Jesus,
[37:23] today. Amen. He's the only one that
[37:27] could have paid the debt.
[37:30] You think about there's people that
[37:32] praise movie stars, sports
[37:35] stars, praise presidents, dictators
[37:42] more than they praise the only one that
[37:44] could save them.
[37:47] I believe God inhabits the praises of
[37:50] those that worship him in spirit and in
[37:52] truth. Amen. Amen. Turn with me if you
[37:54] would in your Bibles to uh 2 Corinthians
[37:58] chapter 2 as you're turning there.
[38:02] Um S uh Sister Donna made mention to me
[38:07] this morning that uh Anna Kova wants to
[38:10] thank everyone for their prayers. She
[38:13] really appreciate all of our prayers
[38:15] through the the time that we've been
[38:17] praying for him for been a while.
[38:20] As brother Bruce had said, just continue
[38:22] to hold her up in the days to
[38:25] come. Amen. Second Corinthians chapter
[38:28] 5. Before we begin reading here, let's
[38:30] look to the author of this book and just
[38:33] ask God to help us help us to receive
[38:37] this morning. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[38:40] count it a privilege to be in your house
[38:42] today. We don't deserve to even be able
[38:46] to come before your presence, Lord. We
[38:48] thank you for that great debt that you
[38:50] paid, allowing us to approach you and to
[38:52] come
[38:53] boldly. Lord, we come humbly this
[38:56] morning thanking you for the great gift
[38:59] of life that you've given each of us
[39:01] today. And Lord, today we just want to
[39:03] ponder those things today, what you've
[39:05] done for us. And Lord, perhaps take a
[39:08] look in the responsibility that now we
[39:10] that lies before us with what you've
[39:12] done for our lives. Please come and open
[39:15] our eyes, open these scriptures to us
[39:16] and let us leave here a better equipped
[39:19] people, Lord, than when we
[39:21] came. Lord, we love you. We want to to
[39:24] become completely in your image for no
[39:26] other reason but to please you, Lord, to
[39:29] be to be found pleasing in your sight.
[39:32] We ask that you come and anoint us.
[39:34] Anoint each ear to hear, each heart to
[39:37] receive. Anoint these lips, Lord, that
[39:40] they only speak the thoughts of God
[39:41] today. We commit it all to you now. We
[39:44] give you praise in advance for these
[39:46] things. We pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[39:49] Amen. Amen. Second Corinthians chapter 5
[39:53] starting with verse number 14 and
[39:56] conclude there with verse 15. For the
[39:58] love of Christ, Amen. Love lifted me.
[40:01] Amen. Did we not sing that? For the love
[40:03] of Christ constrainth us because we thus
[40:07] judge that if one died for all, then
[40:10] we're all dead.
[40:13] We're not set
[40:15] free, but we're
[40:17] dead. And that if he died for all, that
[40:20] they which live should not henceforth
[40:23] live unto themselves. Amen. But unto him
[40:26] that died for them and rose again. And
[40:29] God bless you. May be seated. You see
[40:31] here that even though Christ
[40:35] paid for our our great
[40:39] debt, he died for us that we wouldn't
[40:42] have to die. He died for us that we
[40:43] could have eternal life. We are sitting
[40:46] here today uh
[40:49] that that we're dead to our will and
[40:53] dead to our flesh and dead to doing the
[40:56] things that we want to do. We're still
[41:00] um we're still in debt to
[41:04] God. Uh he paid our debt, but now we
[41:07] become in debt to God. That's right.
[41:09] Right. See, so so often the mentality of
[41:11] the church world is he paid my debt. I'm
[41:13] set free. I'm uh I'm saved and I I'm I
[41:17] don't got that sin hanging over me and
[41:19] and and I I can kind of just do what I
[41:21] want to do now.
[41:23] and that it is a trick that Satan tries
[41:26] to bring upon us on on a on a regular
[41:28] basis. This morning, we want to entitle
[41:31] this message the power of living in
[41:33] indebtedness. Amen. There is actually a
[41:36] power of feeling like you're in debt all
[41:39] the
[41:40] time. There's a power in that, a very a
[41:43] very powerful power. Let's start off
[41:46] here in John 3:13. Just laying the
[41:49] foundation of what Christ did for us.
[41:51] St. John chapter 3:13 Jesus speaking and
[41:53] no man have ascended up to heaven but he
[41:56] that came down from heaven even the son
[41:58] of man which is in heaven and as Moses
[42:01] lift as Moses lifted up the serpent in
[42:04] the wilderness even so must the son of
[42:07] man be lifted up that whosoever
[42:09] believeth in him should not perish but
[42:12] have everlasting life. How many
[42:13] remembers the story there where Moses
[42:16] lifted up the serpent? Amen. All right.
[42:18] And for those that don't, we're going to
[42:20] turn to it right now. Numbers 21. Come
[42:22] back here. Numbers 21:4. And they
[42:24] journeyed from the mount by the
[42:26] way of the Red Sea to compass the land
[42:28] of Edom. And the soul of the people was
[42:31] much discouraged because of the way. And
[42:34] the people spake against God and against
[42:36] Moses. Now notice the attitude of the
[42:39] people that just came out of Egypt. They
[42:42] were just set free. But yet their nature
[42:45] wasn't set
[42:47] free. Right? Their nature wasn't set
[42:49] free. But they were set free from the
[42:52] physical bondage. And they began to
[42:54] speak against God and against Moses.
[42:56] Wherefore have ye brought us up out of
[42:58] Egypt to die in the wilderness, for
[43:01] there's no bread, neither is there any
[43:02] water. And our soul loth this light
[43:07] bread. Is this all this church has got
[43:09] to give me? Amen. Is this all it's got
[43:12] to offer? Amen.
[43:15] And the Lord sent fiery serpents among
[43:18] the people. Notice who did this. The
[43:20] Lord sent fiery serpents among the
[43:22] people and they bit the people. And much
[43:25] people of Israel died. All because they
[43:28] murmured and complained. All because
[43:30] they chose to have a bad attitude about
[43:32] their situation. Amen.
[43:36] And the Lord said unto Moses, "Make thee
[43:38] a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole.
[43:40] And it shall come to pass that everyone
[43:42] that is bitten when he lookth upon it
[43:45] shall live. And Moses made a serpent of
[43:49] brass and put it upon a pole. And it
[43:51] came to pass that that if a serpent had
[43:53] bitten any man, when he beheld the
[43:55] serpent of brass, he lived. Now, this
[43:59] was this was set in place as a type.
[44:02] This is a this is a real thing that
[44:04] happened, but it was a type in the
[44:06] spiritual of what Christ done for us.
[44:09] because you know basically the whole
[44:11] world just murmurss and complains about
[44:12] their their life right
[44:15] but a lot of things that they do is
[44:17] because they they they simply can't
[44:20] trust God a lot of mistakes that I that
[44:23] happen to me they they come upon myself
[44:25] because I make wrong choices but anyways
[44:28] there seems to be this this this this
[44:30] problem of of just this um temptation of
[44:33] of wanting to murmur and complain and
[44:36] going back to St. John chapter 3 now and
[44:38] Jesus speaking uh that whosoever
[44:41] believeth in him should not perish but
[44:43] have everlasting life. For God so loved
[44:44] the world that he gave his only begotten
[44:46] son and whosoever believeth in him
[44:48] should not perish but have everlasting
[44:50] life. So God went he sent his son he
[44:53] went to Calvary for us and alls we have
[44:55] to do is look to him. Amen. But see a
[44:59] lot of people they look to him there was
[45:00] two thieves on the cross right? We'll
[45:02] look to him and say, "Hey, if you be
[45:04] God, come down here, save us both, and
[45:06] you know, we'll see." Then the attitude
[45:08] wasn't humility, wasn't humble, it was
[45:12] it was arrogant. And the other one
[45:14] standing right next to the cross said,
[45:16] "Lord, I'm not worthy. I am not worthy."
[45:19] And it depends how we look at the cross
[45:21] today, what we get out of it.
[45:23] You want more out of it, look at it in a
[45:25] humble view. Amen.
[45:28] And he that believeth on him is not
[45:30] condemned. Oh, verse 17, I'm sorry. For
[45:33] God sent not his son into the world to
[45:35] condemn the world, but that the world
[45:37] through him, notice, might be saved.
[45:41] It's got to be through him. Not just the
[45:44] not just the act of saying, "I accept
[45:46] what Calvary did there, but to know the
[45:49] meaning of that act, to embrace all that
[45:53] that act encompassed for our lives. It
[45:57] was there to change our very nature."
[45:59] Yes. Oh, even though Jesus didn't say it
[46:02] there, I'm dying that your nature could
[46:04] be changed. Make sure you receive it. Is
[46:06] contained in the scriptures.
[46:10] He that believeth on him is not
[46:12] condemned, but he that believeth not is
[46:14] condemned already because he have not
[46:16] believed in the name of the only
[46:17] begotten son of God. And this is the
[46:19] condemnation that light is coming to the
[46:21] world. And men, you know, they just
[46:22] actually love darkness rather than
[46:26] light. They're drawn to the things of
[46:29] the flesh
[46:31] because their deeds were evil. For
[46:34] everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[46:35] light. You ever have a problem with
[46:37] somebody that just doesn't want to
[46:39] listen?
[46:40] What's really happening is that they're
[46:43] loving their what they're doing.
[46:46] They neither come to the light, lest
[46:48] their deeds should be reproved. But he
[46:49] that doeth truth cometh to the light,
[46:51] that his deeds may be made manifest that
[46:54] they are wrought of God. So, it's okay
[46:56] to just say, you know what, I've got
[46:58] these things in my life. I really want
[46:59] to get rid of them. They are dark. They
[47:01] shouldn't be there, but I'm coming to
[47:02] the light. Yes, that's the right
[47:04] attitude. The wrong attitude is, yeah,
[47:07] everybody's got them, and you know, just
[47:11] whatever. It's your attitude that brings
[47:13] you to the
[47:15] light. And and and unfortunately, God
[47:18] has made it like
[47:19] this with everyone having a freemore
[47:22] agency. And there is no possible way
[47:25] that you can come to the image of Jesus
[47:27] Christ without going through the avenue
[47:29] of free moral agency. It is possible
[47:31] because God will not have robots.
[47:36] So you got to accept the word
[47:39] into your heart, to your mind, and say,
[47:40] "Lord, this is what I'm going to walk
[47:42] in. I'm going to walk in the light as
[47:44] he's in the light. I'm going to keep
[47:45] moving forward." Yes. And God sees that
[47:48] and he says, "That's the one I'm after."
[47:50] Amen. He's searching for those that will
[47:53] worship me in spirit and truth. That's
[47:55] right. You want all the word
[47:59] now? To be in debt is a negative
[48:04] feeling. To feel to feel that you are in
[48:08] debt. It's a negative feeling. Can you
[48:10] say amen to that? It's associated with
[48:13] negative thoughts.
[48:15] No one wants to
[48:18] owe the government back
[48:24] taxes. Let me see. Has this is has this
[48:26] ever happened to
[48:28] anybody? You go out to dinner and they
[48:31] want to buy you
[48:33] dinner and you say, "Oh, no, no, I'm
[48:35] paying for my own
[48:37] dinner." Because you don't want to feel
[48:40] like you owe
[48:41] them good. I love honesty. It's happened
[48:45] to
[48:48] me. And so this this feeling of of you
[48:52] don't want to feel in debt to nobody,
[48:54] right? You just you want to be free from
[48:56] indentice because it's it's like a
[48:57] negative feeling.
[49:00] No one wants to owe the bank on a
[49:02] student loan, a car loan, a vacation
[49:04] loan or some second
[49:07] mortgage or owe someone because they
[49:10] borrowed money from them or just
[49:12] borrowed something from them. You don't
[49:15] want that feeling there because it's
[49:18] associated with a negativity. People
[49:21] don't like the feeling of indebtedness.
[49:26] It's just associated with too many bad
[49:28] thoughts and feelings inside. But to be
[49:30] indebted is often thought of as a
[49:32] condition of owing someone money or some
[49:35] favor. But it can also be the condition
[49:38] of feeling like owing gratitude
[49:41] to someone.
[49:45] In other words, indebtedness can be
[49:47] associated with a positive feeling and
[49:49] positive thoughts. What is wrong with
[49:54] owing goodness to somebody?
[50:02] Well, I I'll give this back because I
[50:05] owe this and I got to make sure I do it
[50:06] and I got to make sure that I don't, you
[50:07] know, get have a position where I don't
[50:09] owe people anymore. What is wrong with
[50:12] owing
[50:14] everybody? I want us to get that
[50:16] revelation today. What is wrong with
[50:19] that? It's a positive
[50:22] thing. We're just scared of owing
[50:24] because we don't want to owe. We want to
[50:26] live for ourselves. It's a selfishness
[50:27] is what it is. And in the light of this,
[50:31] I want to ask this question today. Did
[50:32] God feel indebted to help
[50:37] mankind? It's a it's a it's a really
[50:39] good question. Did he feel
[50:42] indebted? Because remember, man did not
[50:46] owe
[50:47] God. God did not owe man anything.
[50:52] He didn't. And I got a quote coming for
[50:55] this.
[50:57] But did God feel indebted
[51:00] anyways? Isn't this a
[51:03] paradox? When Adam and Eve fell, did God
[51:06] have a sense of responsibility to them?
[51:10] Was it really God's responsibility at
[51:13] that point? Did God feel in debt to Adam
[51:16] and Eve? What
[51:19] happened? I believe God felt a special
[51:21] kind of indebtedness to Adam and Eve.
[51:24] And not only to Adam and Eve, but to all
[51:26] mankind because they're all born in sin,
[51:28] shaped in iniquity, kind of like in a
[51:30] cage. And that's why God comes to every
[51:32] person and gives them a chance
[51:35] because he he cares about them. The
[51:38] Bible says he has no pleasure in the
[51:39] death of the
[51:40] wicked. And I believe that God's in in
[51:44] that feeling of indebtedness that come
[51:46] from a heart of
[51:48] love. Romans
[51:50] 5:6. And I'm sorry there's going to be a
[51:52] lot of scriptures, but I just want you
[51:53] to kind of catch the spirit of
[51:56] everything. You can always go back and
[51:57] study later. For when we were yet
[52:00] without strength in due time, Christ
[52:02] died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a
[52:05] righteous man will one die, yet
[52:07] perventure for a good man, some would
[52:09] even dare to die. But God commended his
[52:12] love towards us, that while we were yet
[52:15] sinners, Christ died for us.
[52:21] That's
[52:24] love. 1 Peter 2:24, who who his own self
[52:29] bear our sins in his own body on the
[52:31] tree, that we being dead to sins should
[52:33] live unto righteousness. Right there it
[52:37] is. He bare our
[52:39] sins on the cross and now we should live
[52:46] indebtedly
[52:48] not to ourselves, not to our
[52:51] righteousness, not to how we see how a
[52:53] Christian should
[52:55] be, but to truly unto the word the
[52:58] righteousness of God. We become in debt
[53:00] when we receive his grace.
[53:08] Galatians 1:4, "Who gave himself for our
[53:11] sins that he might deliver us from this
[53:14] present evil world according to the will
[53:16] of God our
[53:17] father." He gave himself for our sins
[53:20] that he might deliver us from this
[53:22] present evil world. Thank God. I'll tell
[53:24] you, there should never be an issue with
[53:26] a Christian coming to church and
[53:27] praising God. Amen. Should never be an
[53:30] issue. I'll tell you, if a person has a
[53:32] problem coming to church and worshiping
[53:34] God, he is so much in his flesh,
[53:37] something is wrong.
[53:39] He's worthy of all praise. He's even
[53:41] worthy of the praise of a hypocrite.
[53:45] He's worthy of the of the stones crying
[53:47] out. He's worthy. Worthy is the lamb.
[53:51] When we get to heaven, there won't be a
[53:52] little group say, "Oh, God, you don't
[53:54] understand. I just had a bad day."
[53:58] All heaven and earth has got a
[54:00] revelation of Jehovah Gyra. I think
[54:02] that's what we need. We need a
[54:03] revelation of who he is, not a
[54:05] revelation of our problems.
[54:14] For God so loved the world that he gave
[54:16] his only begotten
[54:18] son the power of living in indebtedness.
[54:21] Because God felt an
[54:26] indebtedness. He prophesied there in
[54:30] Genesis that he was going to
[54:33] come and take care of the problem at
[54:36] Calvary. That's what it that's the power
[54:39] that comes from indebtedness. There's no
[54:41] power in living for yourself.
[54:48] This power, it caused God to leave the
[54:51] ramparts of glory to come down to save
[54:54] man. God became man that man could
[54:58] become
[55:01] God. But God who is rich in mercy for
[55:04] his great love where he wherewith he
[55:06] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[55:09] have quickened us together with Christ.
[55:11] By grace you're saved and have raised us
[55:13] up together. Now that is his love, his
[55:17] indebtedness that has caused
[55:21] us to raise us up to be with
[55:25] him. As the man says, it takes the
[55:27] bigger man to get underneath the other
[55:28] man and bring him
[55:31] up. Anybody can sit there and say, "I'm
[55:33] better than you or you shouldn't do this
[55:36] or that's
[55:37] bad." But who's living for others? You
[55:40] don't that's that's a rare that's a
[55:42] rarity even in the Christian world. It
[55:45] really is. You got a lot of professors
[55:47] in the Christian world, but you don't
[55:49] have people that are literally living
[55:51] for others.
[55:53] Hebrews 2:9 says, "But we see Jesus who
[55:56] was made a little lower than the
[55:58] angels." Just talking about God's
[56:00] indebtedness for the suffering of death
[56:04] crowned with glory and honor that he by
[56:07] the grace of God should taste death for
[56:10] every
[56:12] man. He tasted death for every one of
[56:16] us so
[56:18] we didn't have to be eternally separated
[56:21] from him. in the message victory day.
[56:23] Brother Ram says, "Heavenly Father," in
[56:25] his prayer, "we are
[56:28] grateful and I, Lord, am so in debt to
[56:32] you. There's no way that I could ever
[56:34] pay the debt of my
[56:36] sin. I was in a cell one day because I
[56:40] was born in that cell.
[56:43] I known what freedom meant and that the
[56:46] price was so great, I couldn't pay it.
[56:49] But I'm so glad that the day you visit
[56:52] my cell and I recognized it, that it was
[56:56] the only one that could
[56:59] pardon, the only one that I could that
[57:02] could I'm sorry, the only one I could
[57:04] ever be
[57:05] free and have the victory, a complete
[57:08] victory was to accept the pardon that
[57:10] you had signed for me. And today I'm
[57:15] totally and today I am set free.
[57:19] God set us
[57:21] free. Now, what are we going to do with
[57:24] that freedom? Think about
[57:27] this. If you take the freedom that God
[57:29] has given you and you live for yourself,
[57:33] you're nothing but a robber and a thief.
[57:38] Now, I want you to take a look at the
[57:40] years that you've been
[57:42] living because that proves pretty much
[57:45] what you think about what God did for
[57:47] you.
[57:50] Come on
[57:56] now. God deserves our life.
[58:01] Just in the just common
[58:03] sense, basic thinking, nononsense,
[58:08] reasonable, God paid, he paid the price
[58:11] so we could have eternal life. The least
[58:13] we should do is be able to give him 30,
[58:16] 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 years of our
[58:18] life, whatever it is.
[58:24] Philippians 2:6, who being in the form
[58:26] of God, thought it not robbery to be
[58:28] equal with God, but made himself of no
[58:31] reputation, and took upon him the form
[58:33] of a servant, and was made in the
[58:34] likeness of men. Being found in the
[58:37] fashion as a man, he humbled himself and
[58:39] he became obedient unto death, even the
[58:41] death of the cross. Now, God did that
[58:45] for us. Amen.
[58:49] You know, I this is so profound to
[58:53] me. Can you
[58:56] imagine just
[58:57] spending weeks, months,
[59:01] years building something with your own
[59:04] hands?
[59:07] given it to
[59:09] somebody. Do it again. Give it to
[59:11] somebody. Give it Do it again. Give it
[59:13] to
[59:15] somebody and they don't appreciate it
[59:21] enough to even take care of
[59:24] it. And here God created man, created
[59:28] the earth, created
[59:31] everything. Turned it to be a big mess.
[59:34] But he came down and humbled himself and
[59:36] took the took your place at Calvary,
[59:39] right?
[59:42] I I think people don't get a revelation
[59:44] really of what that really means to
[59:46] them. They lost a vision of Calvary. You
[59:48] know what I'm saying? They look at God
[59:50] as some Santa Claus, some some Christmas
[59:54] gift. Here it is. You got eternal life.
[59:56] Now go on with your life.
[1:00:00] Jesus gives this one parable in Matthew
[1:00:02] 13:44. or it's just one verse long
[1:00:04] again. The kingdom of heaven is like
[1:00:06] unto a treasure hid in a
[1:00:09] field. The which when a man hath found
[1:00:12] it, he hid it. He hideth it. He hideth
[1:00:15] and for joy thereof goeth and sell
[1:00:19] all that he hath and he buyth the
[1:00:26] field. God gave all he had.
[1:00:33] to buy us. There was nothing greater
[1:00:36] that God could
[1:00:40] do. And Jesus, I believe, expressing
[1:00:43] this in uh we could see this, but
[1:00:46] recorded in Hebrews 12:2, looking unto
[1:00:49] Jesus, the author and finisher of our
[1:00:50] faith, who for the joy that was set
[1:00:53] before him endured the
[1:00:56] cross. See, he had joy.
[1:00:59] He had joy. Sometimes we don't have any
[1:01:02] joy living for others. Oh, I got to do
[1:01:04] this. I got to do that. What's wrong?
[1:01:09] You're in the flesh now. Call it out.
[1:01:16] We ought to be so full of the joy of the
[1:01:17] Lord, we're just living for others. For
[1:01:20] the joy that was set before me endured
[1:01:22] the cross, despising the shame, and is
[1:01:23] set down at the right hand of the throne
[1:01:25] of God. Amen.
[1:01:29] Have we that have accepted
[1:01:31] Christ paying for our
[1:01:35] salvation? We belong to God. Now, if
[1:01:39] you've truly truly accepted Calvary, you
[1:01:44] belong to Christ. See, here's the thing.
[1:01:46] People want to take the word and say, "I
[1:01:49] believe Christ died for me." And then
[1:01:51] that's it.
[1:01:53] I'm claiming that and I want preaching
[1:01:55] that tells me I belong to that that
[1:01:57] Christ paid for my sins and I'm set
[1:01:59] free. And that's all they want to hear.
[1:02:03] Because they don't got enough realness
[1:02:05] inside of them. Say, "God, I want to
[1:02:07] love you." I want to love you and I want
[1:02:10] to prove my love to you.
[1:02:14] 1 Corinthians 6:19 says, "What know you
[1:02:18] not that your body is the temple of the
[1:02:19] Holy Ghost which is in you? which you
[1:02:22] have of God, and you are what? Not your
[1:02:26] own.
[1:02:33] That just seems to be like a figurement
[1:02:35] of our imagination
[1:02:37] sometimes. For you are bought with a
[1:02:41] price. Calvary bought you. Therefore,
[1:02:45] it's your responsibility to glorify God
[1:02:47] in your body and your spirit, which are
[1:02:51] gods.
[1:02:54] So, even though we're set free, we're
[1:02:57] still in debt to him.
[1:03:03] It's easy than one would think to ignore
[1:03:05] the fact that we which have been
[1:03:07] baptized belong to God.
[1:03:13] just to do our own thing, to want God to
[1:03:16] save and
[1:03:17] ignore Jesus being the Lord of our
[1:03:20] lives, to look God as taking care of our
[1:03:23] salvation and ignoring that he really
[1:03:25] wants to see our nature change. It's
[1:03:28] easy to fall into that mindset. In other
[1:03:31] words, if I if I go to church, I just I
[1:03:33] get my I I do what I got to do for the
[1:03:35] day and then I go
[1:03:37] forward and there's there's just like no
[1:03:39] concept of a real relationship with
[1:03:42] God. I'm just speaking the truth. We
[1:03:44] want God for what he can profit us. And
[1:03:48] that's how sometimes we treat people. We
[1:03:50] want we want people to help us. We want
[1:03:53] people in our life so they can help us,
[1:03:54] but we're not even interested in serving
[1:03:56] them.
[1:04:03] The full essence of Calvary can be
[1:04:07] forgotten. Second Peter 1:9. But he that
[1:04:10] lackth these things is blind and cannot
[1:04:12] see far off and is forgotten that he was
[1:04:15] purged from his own
[1:04:19] sins. He that lackth these things, what
[1:04:23] things? the very nature and the virtues
[1:04:27] of Christ, faith,
[1:04:29] strength,
[1:04:31] knowledge, temperance, self-control,
[1:04:34] patience, godliness, brotherly kindness,
[1:04:36] and agape
[1:04:37] love. He's that that's lacking these
[1:04:40] things is blind. He can't see very far
[1:04:44] off. It's just carnal flesh, whatever's
[1:04:46] happening in his life right now, and has
[1:04:48] forgotten what Calvary was all about.
[1:04:53] The scriptures exhort us to be diligent
[1:04:56] about adding these to our nature to have
[1:04:58] a mindset of you. You need to make sure
[1:05:01] that you're you're doing
[1:05:04] this. Don't let the world swallow you up
[1:05:07] in the things of the world. Get a
[1:05:08] relationship with Christ that you bring
[1:05:10] him in your home, you bring him in your
[1:05:12] bedroom, you you bring him in the living
[1:05:14] room, you bring him at work, you bring
[1:05:15] him in the car, you you you don't just
[1:05:18] play your favorite song to feel good.
[1:05:20] You play it because you want to be
[1:05:21] closer to God.
[1:05:25] Verse 10. Wherefore rather, brethren,
[1:05:27] give diligence to make your calling and
[1:05:29] election sure. For if you do these
[1:05:31] things, you shall never fall. For so an
[1:05:33] entrance shall be ministered unto you
[1:05:35] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
[1:05:37] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And
[1:05:39] that is what happens when you put a tape
[1:05:41] on. That is what happens when you come
[1:05:42] to church. An entrance is being
[1:05:44] ministered to you. It's not just church.
[1:05:47] It's God speaking.
[1:05:49] to your
[1:05:51] heart. That's why Jesus said, "He that
[1:05:54] has an ear to
[1:05:55] hear, let him hear." Because not all
[1:05:58] have
[1:05:59] ears. They only have an ear. They have
[1:06:02] they they have other ears. They have
[1:06:03] itching ears. They want to hear what
[1:06:06] they want to
[1:06:07] hear. They're itching for what they want
[1:06:10] to hear. Their type of ministry that
[1:06:13] makes them feel good. I'll tell you,
[1:06:15] feeling good does not get you into the
[1:06:16] nature of God. That's right. It's coming
[1:06:19] to the realization that you're ugly and
[1:06:21] you need Jesus Christ in your life. And
[1:06:23] I'll tell you, when you get God, your
[1:06:24] life is just so full of love. You can be
[1:06:26] slapped in the face and talked about and
[1:06:28] everything. You still love them because
[1:06:29] you got the goods. It's no peacock
[1:06:31] feather in
[1:06:33] you. The real
[1:06:36] deal. In the message, who is God?
[1:06:38] Brother Ram says, I like the attitude of
[1:06:40] this centurion. Everybody remembers the
[1:06:44] centurion that we just read of. He was a
[1:06:48] man that felt unworthy.
[1:06:51] Right? There's the key right there. He
[1:06:53] felt unworthy. Not just knowledge. Oh
[1:06:56] yeah, I'm unworthy. He felt
[1:07:01] it. He felt
[1:07:05] unworthy. I if if you watch somebody get
[1:07:09] hurt, and I mean they got hurt bad.
[1:07:11] Everybody's watched a football game,
[1:07:13] right? And they just get plowed.
[1:07:16] Something happened is he's laying there
[1:07:17] and he's down and the medics come out
[1:07:21] and the cart comes out and he's laying
[1:07:24] there. He's going like this. You can
[1:07:28] tell he feels hurt.
[1:07:32] It's real. Amen.
[1:07:36] You don't ever see anybody halfway down
[1:07:38] the running them off the field get off
[1:07:40] the cart and start going like this. Hey,
[1:07:42] I was just kidding.
[1:07:46] When you feel unworthy, it is so obvious
[1:07:49] that everybody could see it.
[1:07:53] We're written epistles right of all men.
[1:07:55] This centurion felt unworthy. And as he
[1:07:59] says, as long as you're feeling unworthy
[1:08:02] of the blessing you're asking, you're
[1:08:05] pretty apt to get it. Right? That talks
[1:08:09] to me like a right mental attitude.
[1:08:10] Humility is part of that. that
[1:08:13] unworthiness. But when you get to a
[1:08:15] place where you think God just owes
[1:08:18] you, that's when you're mistaken.
[1:08:22] We're in debt to God, not God in debt to
[1:08:24] us. We're indebted to God.
[1:08:30] Living in indebtedness,
[1:08:33] living in indebtedness.
[1:08:37] Now, we know the Bible commands us to no
[1:08:40] owe no man
[1:08:42] anything. And if we've borrowed
[1:08:43] anything, we should pay it back. That's
[1:08:45] just
[1:08:46] scripture. If you say, "Can I borrow a
[1:08:49] cup of sugar from you?" I promise I will
[1:08:52] give you a cup of sugar
[1:08:54] back. You better give that cup of sugar
[1:09:02] back. But along with that thought
[1:09:05] process of paying back what you
[1:09:06] borrowed, there's also paying back to
[1:09:09] the things that have been given to you
[1:09:11] even though you didn't ask for
[1:09:16] them. The scripture tells us about
[1:09:18] tribute to whom tribute's due. Honor to
[1:09:20] whom honor is due. I'll say like this. A
[1:09:22] smile to whom a smile is due. Amen.
[1:09:25] Respect to whom respect is due.
[1:09:26] Reverence to whom reverence is due. We
[1:09:30] owe. I mean, you go to the store and
[1:09:32] there's two people coming up to the gas
[1:09:34] station. You're ready to walk in and one
[1:09:36] opens the door for you. You don't say,
[1:09:37] "Yeah, whatever."
[1:09:40] You express a thankfulness of some sort.
[1:09:46] That's just natural and carnal. But you
[1:09:48] know, the thing is there are so many
[1:09:51] blessings that are happening to us
[1:09:52] constantly. God is blessing us through
[1:09:54] so many people in so many ways. God has
[1:09:56] done so much for us and we don't want to
[1:09:58] take time to be thankful for him, to
[1:10:00] feel in debt to anybody.
[1:10:03] Oh, that's just Brother John. That's
[1:10:05] just the way he is. That's just the
[1:10:08] pastor's
[1:10:11] job. We're missing
[1:10:16] it. We need to live an indebted life.
[1:10:20] And I'll tell you this, we need to live
[1:10:21] in a power of indebtedness. Amen.
[1:10:24] Because there's power in that that
[1:10:26] nothing can stand before you. You know,
[1:10:28] you know God is with you. You're not
[1:10:31] afraid of anything. You're not scared of
[1:10:33] anything
[1:10:35] because you've given your all to God.
[1:10:37] You're not afraid to lay down your life.
[1:10:39] You're not afraid to turn your cheek.
[1:10:41] You're not afraid to go to second mouth.
[1:10:42] You're just not afraid of living for
[1:10:44] others because you trust God. He'll take
[1:10:47] care of you. Amen.
[1:10:51] If he hasn't proved to be God in your
[1:10:53] life yet, then you need to humble
[1:10:54] yourself and get serious because that
[1:10:56] thing needs to be settled like a long
[1:10:57] time ago.
[1:11:01] And along with that command, owe no man
[1:11:04] anything. We must pay above and
[1:11:07] beyond what we think we
[1:11:10] owe. Like if somebody asked you to do
[1:11:12] something, you should do that and more.
[1:11:13] Did you know that scripture?
[1:11:15] If someone hurt you, you should turn the
[1:11:17] other
[1:11:18] cheek. You should forgive others when
[1:11:20] they don't even ask for it. This is what
[1:11:23] I'm saying. Giving when you they don't
[1:11:26] they don't even ask for it. It's just a
[1:11:29] command. This is what it means to live
[1:11:33] indebted unto God. This is what it
[1:11:35] means. It's the manifestation of it.
[1:11:39] There is a power in living an indebted
[1:11:41] life.
[1:11:43] Jesus said, "And forgive us our debtor
[1:11:45] our debts as we forgive
[1:11:49] others. But if you forgive not men their
[1:11:51] trespass, neither will your father
[1:11:53] forgive your trespasses." So we, you
[1:11:56] know, we get hurt by somebody. You know
[1:11:57] what we
[1:11:58] do? We just ignore them. We ignore
[1:12:03] them. We ignore
[1:12:05] them. Can't find a scripture for it, but
[1:12:08] we'll still do it.
[1:12:10] I know why Jesus said that in there.
[1:12:13] It's to help people with that
[1:12:15] attitude to remind them. The only reason
[1:12:18] that we've been forgiven is because we
[1:12:20] made a decision at the beginning. God, I
[1:12:22] confess all my sins. I'm sorry. I want
[1:12:25] to serve you. I love you. From this
[1:12:27] point forward, I I'll repent. I'll get
[1:12:28] baptized and I'll serve you. And you
[1:12:30] know, at that moment, you're as white as
[1:12:33] snow. But what happens after that is the
[1:12:36] same thing that happens to the children
[1:12:37] of Israel when they came out of Egypt.
[1:12:38] You now get into put into a
[1:12:41] test. We're going to prove how much you
[1:12:44] really are
[1:12:46] sorry. We're going to prove how sorry
[1:12:48] you are. Were you sorry enough to live
[1:12:52] for me? To to take my word as your road
[1:12:55] map from earth to glory
[1:12:58] and to start living the things that I've
[1:13:00] asked you to do. If you love me, keep my
[1:13:02] commandments.
[1:13:04] And if you don't want to, go find a
[1:13:05] denomination.
[1:13:10] Yes. Because God is calling a people out
[1:13:12] of this message that will believe the
[1:13:14] message.
[1:13:18] Not sit in the comfort of we know God
[1:13:20] said a prophet.
[1:13:23] We got to live the message. It's not
[1:13:25] about you being in the message. It's the
[1:13:27] message manifested in you.
[1:13:30] And you know what? You don't have to
[1:13:31] tell anybody.
[1:13:33] You don't have to tell anybody.
[1:13:36] We all
[1:13:39] see when we learn to live
[1:13:42] indebted. Listen to me. We live with the
[1:13:47] power that we don't
[1:13:49] have. People who like stingy, selfish,
[1:13:54] got my own life. I'm not going to do
[1:13:55] that for I'm not. You know, you can't
[1:13:57] hardly ask them to do things. You got to
[1:13:59] be clever about who you're going to ask
[1:14:01] to do what. And
[1:14:02] and it's like where is that soldier?
[1:14:06] Where's that centurion? I say to him
[1:14:08] come and he comes and go and he goes and
[1:14:11] I believe the same thing you do Lord.
[1:14:13] Whatever you say is going to
[1:14:20] happen. We need to live with the power
[1:14:23] of indebtedness which is living for
[1:14:26] others. First and foremost getting souls
[1:14:28] saved.
[1:14:30] Second, those souls who are saved, get
[1:14:33] them to what it means to have a nature
[1:14:35] change because they obviously don't
[1:14:39] know. It's not just about being saved.
[1:14:42] We're we're also called to help the
[1:14:44] bride. We're called to help the bride to
[1:14:47] the nature change. No, the foolish
[1:14:48] virgin don't get
[1:14:49] there. They
[1:14:51] don't. They they they have the ability
[1:14:54] to be faithful. They have the ability to
[1:14:56] do certain things, but they they they
[1:14:58] they don't get the nature
[1:15:02] change. But we that live, who truly
[1:15:05] truly truly have been purchased by God
[1:15:09] and know it and live it, they are the
[1:15:12] ones helping the weak. They that are
[1:15:13] strong bear the infirmities of the
[1:15:16] weak. Now, without the power, I'll say
[1:15:19] this, mark this down. Without the power
[1:15:22] of indebtedness, we will live a selfish
[1:15:28] life because it takes power to not live
[1:15:30] a selfish life.
[1:15:33] And you can I guess you could work up
[1:15:35] some momentum to give your body to be
[1:15:37] burned at one
[1:15:39] time. But I mean to to to I'll just I'll
[1:15:42] quote the scripture. Um I got it written
[1:15:46] down here, but I'm going to just I'll
[1:15:48] find it. It's on my tip of my
[1:15:52] tongue. I beseech you therefore,
[1:15:54] brethren, by the mercies of God, that
[1:15:56] you present your bodies a living
[1:15:58] sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God,
[1:16:00] which is your reasonable service.
[1:16:02] Anybody can just whoop up enough energy
[1:16:04] to make it to church,
[1:16:08] but just try living for God every day.
[1:16:10] Brother Brandham said, "It's a hard,
[1:16:11] rugged life. Living for God, winning
[1:16:14] souls for Jesus Christ every day." All
[1:16:17] right. Turn with me to Luke
[1:16:20] 7:36. You'll be bear with me if this
[1:16:22] just takes a few minutes longer, right?
[1:16:24] Today, I
[1:16:26] trust. And those of of of you that that
[1:16:30] don't, just please don't tell me. Just
[1:16:33] don't tell me afterwards.
[1:16:38] Okay? I so bad want you to leave here.
[1:16:41] Obviously, if you're living if you live
[1:16:44] totally for for others, you're living
[1:16:46] for God, well then you're just as happy
[1:16:48] as can be right now. And and if you're
[1:16:51] if you're struggling with this message,
[1:16:53] it's like hard. I'm telling you, it's
[1:16:56] God's will. It's still God's will. Our
[1:17:00] our lives need to become more indebted
[1:17:02] to God.
[1:17:05] Luke 7:36. And one of the Pharisees
[1:17:07] desiring Jesus that he would eat with
[1:17:09] him. And Jesus went into the Pharisees
[1:17:12] house and sat down to meet. And behold,
[1:17:14] a woman in the city, which was a sinner,
[1:17:17] just make that clear. When she knew that
[1:17:19] Jesus sat at me in the Pharisees house
[1:17:21] brought an alabaster box of ointment,
[1:17:24] and stood at the feet behind him, notice
[1:17:26] the the humility
[1:17:28] there, weeping, began to wash his feet
[1:17:31] with her with tears, and did wipe them
[1:17:33] with the hairs of her head, and did kiss
[1:17:36] his feet and anoint them with an
[1:17:38] ointment.
[1:17:39] Now this to me is the manifestation of
[1:17:44] indebtedness. This is the manifestation
[1:17:46] of
[1:17:47] indebtedness. There is such a power in
[1:17:51] this. Now honestly the um the Pharisee
[1:17:56] who was very very religious as we know
[1:17:59] he even knew she was a sinner
[1:18:02] but he had no power. This woman had more
[1:18:06] power to move God than he did.
[1:18:10] Think about that indebted. There's such
[1:18:12] power in indebtedness. Amen.
[1:18:15] And this indebtedness that it was
[1:18:18] generated from a heart of of of
[1:18:20] gratitude and and and and uh just love.
[1:18:26] And now when the Pharisee which had bid
[1:18:28] him saw it, he spoke within himself. You
[1:18:32] know, we're all speaking within oursel.
[1:18:34] When we don't say amen to the word, you
[1:18:35] know what we're doing? We're speaking
[1:18:37] with our within oursel while Jesus is
[1:18:40] here speaking to us. Amen. This man, if
[1:18:43] he were a prophet, he would have known
[1:18:46] who and what manner of woman this is
[1:18:49] that touched him. For she is a sinner.
[1:18:51] How many times have you come for prayer
[1:18:55] and you're thinking, "God knows what's
[1:18:58] on my heart and I need that minister to
[1:19:00] tell me exactly what's going on." And if
[1:19:03] he does, then I know that I know that
[1:19:06] he's going to he he he he's going to be
[1:19:08] right with me. He's going to give me
[1:19:09] what I need in his prayer. How many
[1:19:10] times have we ever thought
[1:19:13] that? But you know, God don't need to do
[1:19:15] that to speak to you.
[1:19:18] See, what we need is faith. We don't
[1:19:20] need to understand anything. There's
[1:19:22] nothing in the Bible that says, "Do you
[1:19:24] understand?" You need to understand it.
[1:19:27] No. Need lean not to your own
[1:19:28] understanding, but believe it. Just
[1:19:30] believe. Amen. And God puts it in such a
[1:19:33] way that it's hard to believe. The
[1:19:35] understanding, the the all these things
[1:19:37] kind of lining up to make us feel like
[1:19:40] it. That is that is not
[1:19:43] faith. That's
[1:19:48] humanity. And Jesus answering said unto
[1:19:51] him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto
[1:19:53] thee. And he said, Master
[1:19:56] Son, there was a certain creditor which
[1:19:58] had two debtors. The one owed 500 pence
[1:20:03] and the other 50. Quite a big difference
[1:20:06] there. And when they had nothing to pay,
[1:20:08] he frankly forgave them both. No
[1:20:11] respector of persons. Tell me therefore
[1:20:13] which of them will ha will love him the
[1:20:16] most. Now notice sometimes we'll have a
[1:20:18] tendency of forgiven will will will
[1:20:20] forgive somebody some some for we'll
[1:20:22] forgive somebody something if it wasn't
[1:20:24] that big a deal. But if they did a big
[1:20:26] deal, you'll hold it against them
[1:20:28] forever, right? Not
[1:20:31] Jesus. Not Jesus. He frankly forgave
[1:20:35] them both. Tell me, therefore, which of
[1:20:37] them will love him most? That's a good
[1:20:40] question. Jesus wants to know
[1:20:43] about the deepness of of love
[1:20:46] here. He he he's he's not interested
[1:20:49] that we love God. He's interested how
[1:20:52] much we love God.
[1:20:54] We all love God enough to come to church
[1:20:56] today. Do we love God enough to go home
[1:20:59] and live for
[1:21:01] him? He's interested. He's interested in
[1:21:06] that. And Simon answered and said, "I
[1:21:08] suppose that he to whom he forgave the
[1:21:12] most." And he said unto him, "Thou has
[1:21:14] rightly
[1:21:17] judged." Her indebtedness was generated
[1:21:20] from a love of forgiveness.
[1:21:24] So we can see there's power with living
[1:21:27] with indebtedness. She felt indebted to
[1:21:32] him. And this one that owed 500 p, he
[1:21:37] was more indebted to God than the 50. So
[1:21:40] you see the very key of just being needy
[1:21:43] is the answer to get more power from
[1:21:45] God. The more we stand around and say,
[1:21:47] "I'm something pretty good. Look at this
[1:21:49] bad person in there and look what's
[1:21:50] happening in the church and they
[1:21:52] shouldn't be doing that. You know what
[1:21:53] you're doing? You're showing you ain't
[1:21:55] got anything.
[1:21:57] That's what you're
[1:21:59] showing. Like you're showing that you
[1:22:01] haven't been forgiven much. So you don't
[1:22:04] love much.
[1:22:06] But when you know you've been forgiven
[1:22:08] much, you just want to lay down your
[1:22:09] life and you want to keep helping people
[1:22:11] over and over, one after the other, and
[1:22:13] you just keep going because it's real to
[1:22:15] you.
[1:22:18] You can't find out in Jesus's ministry
[1:22:20] anywhere. He just stopped and said, "You
[1:22:21] know what? I'm going to stop living for
[1:22:24] people. I'm going to take a vacation. I
[1:22:26] need to get away from this
[1:22:32] church. Got to get away from this
[1:22:35] message. It's got to get
[1:22:37] [Music]
[1:22:41] away. Embrace. I need you, Lord." Right?
[1:22:45] Embrace. I am so needy of you, Lord. I
[1:22:48] need to be forgiven of this and this and
[1:22:50] this and this and this and this and I
[1:22:51] got this and this. God, help me. Help
[1:22:53] me. Help me to feel in debt to you,
[1:22:55] Lord. That I can walk in the power of
[1:22:58] indebtedness because you're not getting
[1:23:00] away from
[1:23:02] it. You're not getting away from
[1:23:05] indebtedness. It's all around
[1:23:09] you. Every time you wake up, you're
[1:23:13] indebted. Every time you breathe in air,
[1:23:15] you're indebted to God.
[1:23:18] Every time you you got food to eat,
[1:23:20] you're indebted to God. Air to breathe.
[1:23:23] The sun is
[1:23:25] shining. Someone sends you gives you a
[1:23:27] call, sends you a text, and says, "I'm
[1:23:29] thinking about you. I'm praying for
[1:23:30] you." They have a brother and sister in
[1:23:32] Christ. You're in debt. You're in debt.
[1:23:34] You're constantly in debt. The thing is,
[1:23:36] you got to remember, keep focused on
[1:23:37] that. You you you Satan wants to get you
[1:23:41] so selfish. The only thing you think
[1:23:42] about is yourself
[1:23:45] an entitlement. You owe me. You owe me.
[1:23:47] Everybody owes me. I've had it so hard
[1:23:49] in life. Everybody I deserve a better.
[1:23:52] You don't deserve anything. You're lucky
[1:23:54] you got what you got. It's your attitude
[1:23:56] that's putting you in the way.
[1:24:05] Too many believers are not thankful
[1:24:07] enough. One of the traits in this age is
[1:24:10] unthankfulness.
[1:24:12] Instead of being thankful, they're
[1:24:13] despisers of those that are good.
[1:24:16] Despise them somehow. Say something. Got
[1:24:18] to say something
[1:24:20] somewhere. Because inside, instead of
[1:24:23] being thankful for that person, they
[1:24:25] despise them inside and eventually comes
[1:24:29] out. Instead of living for others, men
[1:24:32] are lovers of their own
[1:24:35] self. The
[1:24:37] opposite. Selfish entitlement.
[1:24:41] covetous, bolsters,
[1:24:43] proud. Jesus said, "Because people's
[1:24:45] iniquities growing more and more, the
[1:24:47] love of many should wax cold in this
[1:24:50] age." We see the spirit of traitors,
[1:24:53] heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure
[1:24:55] more than lovers of God. Having a form
[1:24:56] of godliness, but denying the power
[1:24:59] thereofh from such turn away, having a
[1:25:02] form of godliness. There's no power in a
[1:25:07] form because there's no indebtedness.
[1:25:09] I'll just fake
[1:25:12] it. I'm a
[1:25:15] Christian and I make sure I put my best
[1:25:19] booties on.
[1:25:25] Reason there's no power in a form of
[1:25:27] godliness because there's no Holy Ghost.
[1:25:32] But the
[1:25:34] reason Holy
[1:25:36] Ghost comes when you truly truly feel
[1:25:39] indebted. Amen.
[1:25:42] You're
[1:25:43] indebted. You live in an indebted state.
[1:25:46] Every his mercies are new every morning.
[1:25:49] He didn't sign a thing and say, "You
[1:25:51] know what? I since you got baptized,
[1:25:54] from this day forward, you got mercies
[1:25:55] every day no matter what you do."
[1:25:57] There's no scripture for that.
[1:26:00] There isn't any. You got to get down on
[1:26:03] your knees and you got to say, "God,
[1:26:04] forgive me." If my people which are
[1:26:07] called by my name shall humble
[1:26:09] themselves and call on me, then I will
[1:26:11] hear from heaven.
[1:26:13] We have a job to do every day, and
[1:26:16] that's to live an indebted life to God.
[1:26:18] Amen.
[1:26:26] Verse 44. And he turned to the woman and
[1:26:28] said unto Simon, "Seeest thou
[1:26:30] this what uh seeest thou
[1:26:35] this? Am I in the right
[1:26:38] place?" Good. Thank you. See, I need
[1:26:42] help up here. It's not a oneman show up
[1:26:44] here. You can forget where you're at.
[1:26:46] And he turned to the woman and said unto
[1:26:47] Simon, "Seeest thou this woman. I've
[1:26:49] entered into thine house. This is your
[1:26:51] house, not hers. Thou gavest me no water
[1:26:54] for my feet, but she have washed my feet
[1:26:56] with her tears, and wiped them with the
[1:26:58] hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no
[1:27:00] kiss, but this woman since the time I
[1:27:02] came in, have not ceased to kiss my
[1:27:04] feet, my head with oil. Thou didest
[1:27:07] anoint, but this woman have anointed my
[1:27:09] feet with ointment. Wherefore I say unto
[1:27:13] you, Simon, her sins, which are many are
[1:27:18] forgiven,
[1:27:20] for she loveth
[1:27:23] much. I don't want to say this directly
[1:27:25] to you, Simon,
[1:27:26] but to whom little is forgiven, the same
[1:27:30] loveth
[1:27:31] little. See how he spoke the word with
[1:27:34] grace.
[1:27:38] I'll sit here and just judge everybody
[1:27:40] else in the church,
[1:27:43] you know, because I got a pretty good
[1:27:44] understanding the way they
[1:27:48] act. And God's looking at you and say,
[1:27:50] "Won't you
[1:27:52] love? You're not loving because you're
[1:27:54] not forgiven."
[1:27:57] Oh, I'm forgiven. How can you be
[1:27:58] forgiven and act like that? Because when
[1:28:01] you are forgiven, you that means you
[1:28:03] have forgiven others. because if you
[1:28:06] don't forgive others, God ain't going to
[1:28:07] forgive you. So, you can't say
[1:28:08] [Music]
[1:28:11] it. And he said unto her, "Thy sins are
[1:28:14] forgiven." And they that sat at me with
[1:28:16] him began to say within themselves, "Who
[1:28:18] is he that forgiveth sins also?" And he
[1:28:20] said unto the woman, "Thy faith have
[1:28:22] saved thee. Go in
[1:28:25] peace."
[1:28:27] Boy,
[1:28:29] time, you know, it goes by fast. Don't
[1:28:32] stand still. I wish we had What do we
[1:28:34] need? We need those two guys that were
[1:28:36] with. We need Joshua and Caleb. We We
[1:28:40] need somebody to make the sun stand
[1:28:41] still. Who did that? That's what we need
[1:28:44] right now for a little
[1:28:46] bit. I have to pass on some things
[1:28:50] here. Paul life was a life
[1:28:56] that at one
[1:28:58] time he didn't feel he owed anybody
[1:29:01] anything. There was no indebtedness. He
[1:29:03] was taught by the best. He acted like he
[1:29:06] was the best. He was a Pharisee of the
[1:29:08] Pharisee, a Hebrew of the Hebrews. He
[1:29:10] had everything and nobody could touch
[1:29:12] him. He was
[1:29:14] blameless. But it wasn't until he came
[1:29:17] in contact with a real experience with
[1:29:19] Jesus Christ. And it wasn't a
[1:29:22] person, excuse me, it wasn't a
[1:29:25] human, it was the spirit of God. Amen.
[1:29:30] And when he had that
[1:29:31] experience, he realized he had to give
[1:29:33] up everything to gain him.
[1:29:36] And he became so indebted to God the
[1:29:39] rest of his life. He lived indebted. He
[1:29:42] never walked around, oh, I've attained.
[1:29:44] I've apprehended. I'm better than so and
[1:29:46] so. I'm good enough to be here. You're
[1:29:48] not good enough to be here. There is
[1:29:49] nothing like that.
[1:29:53] He kept pressing towards the mark. Amen.
[1:29:56] He saw there was something more in his
[1:29:58] life that needed to be like Jesus and he
[1:30:01] focused on that. He forgot about the
[1:30:03] things which were behind and he pressed
[1:30:05] forward.
[1:30:07] We don't got time, but if you want to
[1:30:09] write it down, you can go to 2
[1:30:10] Corinthians chapter 11 and you'll find
[1:30:12] out there that Paul withtood so much
[1:30:17] suffering to prove his indebtedness to
[1:30:21] living for God.
[1:30:23] No matter how much he was whipped,
[1:30:24] shipwreck, anything that happened, you
[1:30:26] know what? He got up the next day and he
[1:30:28] lived for Jesus Christ. He didn't say,
[1:30:30] "Well, I'm going to pout around him. I'm
[1:30:31] not going to go to church. I'm not going
[1:30:32] to do this. I don't feel like doing
[1:30:33] that. I'm not going to do this at home.
[1:30:34] I'm He didn't have that kind of that
[1:30:37] what I call carnal attitude, carnal
[1:30:39] Christianity, which I they don't even
[1:30:41] mix. It's they don't even
[1:30:43] mix. You can't be carnal and Christlike
[1:30:45] at the same time, right?
[1:30:50] But there's a real life. There's
[1:30:51] examples in the Bible. Here's another
[1:30:52] one. You write it down. Romans 12:14. We
[1:30:56] won't get examples of living in
[1:31:01] indebtedness. For the love of Christ
[1:31:04] constrainth us because we thus judge
[1:31:06] that if one died for all, then we're all
[1:31:09] dead. We're all dead. and that we and
[1:31:13] that he died for all that we which live
[1:31:15] should not henceforth live unto
[1:31:18] themselves, but unto him that died for
[1:31:20] them and rose again. Amen. We're living
[1:31:24] for God. Hebrews 1, uh, not Hebrews, but
[1:31:28] 1 John 3:16 says, "Hereby perceive we
[1:31:30] the love of God." Let's just just get a
[1:31:33] good understanding of the love of God.
[1:31:37] Because I don't think people really got
[1:31:38] a good understand love of God. They'll
[1:31:41] say, "God loves me." And they stop
[1:31:45] there. Because he laid down his life for
[1:31:47] us, we ought to lay down our lives for
[1:31:50] the brethren. And when we look at this
[1:31:52] word
[1:31:53] ought, often we have this conception of,
[1:31:57] you know, this is the right thing to do,
[1:31:58] but we got an option. We really don't
[1:32:00] have to do
[1:32:01] it. Is that true?
[1:32:05] I mean, that's how it's often looked at.
[1:32:07] But if you look up that word in this
[1:32:10] verse, it means to
[1:32:14] owe. And if we uh
[1:32:18] we we owe our life to be laid down for
[1:32:23] our
[1:32:24] brethren. It means to be under
[1:32:26] obligation, must, need. It's our duty.
[1:32:29] We're bound to. It also uses this word
[1:32:32] debt.
[1:32:34] We're in debt to our brothers.
[1:32:38] If you truly truly accepted Christ to be
[1:32:41] your personal savior, we need to get
[1:32:43] back on
[1:32:45] track of living for
[1:32:50] others. We ought to lay down our lives
[1:32:52] for others.
[1:32:54] Brother Brandham said in the message, I
[1:32:56] know it's not something like exciting,
[1:32:58] but I'll tell
[1:33:00] you, if you belong to Christ, something
[1:33:02] inside of you is saying,
[1:33:04] "Amen. It's the truth."
[1:33:07] Brother Brandham said in message
[1:33:08] forsaking all says, "But I want to say
[1:33:10] this, too. Hurry up as quick as I can."
[1:33:12] That's me. I should me too. God will not
[1:33:15] in no wise be in debt to any man.
[1:33:20] God won't be debted to any man. If you
[1:33:26] have did that for God, forsake and all,
[1:33:30] God will repay you a thousandfold.
[1:33:35] And just think about this. He doesn't
[1:33:36] give you one fold. A thousand,
[1:33:40] right? God will be God will pay it back.
[1:33:44] Excuse
[1:33:46] me.
[1:33:48] Excuse me very much. You forsake the
[1:33:51] things of the
[1:33:52] world and the world and the things of
[1:33:55] the world and God will repay you so many
[1:33:58] times.
[1:34:01] How many is a witness of that here
[1:34:02] tonight? He says, well, we all know that
[1:34:05] God will repay. And I just want a
[1:34:06] scripture for that. That's Luke chapter
[1:34:09] 18 verse 28. Then Peter said, lo, we
[1:34:13] have all left. We have left all and
[1:34:16] followed thee. And Jesus said unto them,
[1:34:19] verily I say unto you, there is no man
[1:34:22] that have left houses or parents or
[1:34:24] brethren or wife or children for the
[1:34:27] kingdom of God's sake, who shall not
[1:34:29] receive manifold more in this present
[1:34:32] time and in the
[1:34:35] world and the world to come life
[1:34:37] everlasting.
[1:34:40] In other words, God does not owe any
[1:34:45] man.
[1:34:46] God does not owe any man. In fact, he
[1:34:50] does say the Bible does say we reap what
[1:34:52] we
[1:34:53] sow. We sow what he just said, forsake
[1:34:55] all, we're going to reap a lot. We
[1:34:58] choose to only forsake a little. Well,
[1:35:01] then we don't get the blessing. Are you
[1:35:04] with me? All right. Romans chapter 1.
[1:35:09] Romans chapter one. Just because I let a
[1:35:11] lot of this stuff go, it doesn't mean
[1:35:13] that I was done preaching. I just want
[1:35:15] to make make that real clear. I just let
[1:35:18] letting a lot of that
[1:35:19] go. Romans 1 verse Romans 1 verse14. I
[1:35:23] am a debtor both to the
[1:35:27] Greek Greeks and to the
[1:35:30] barbarians barbarians and to the wise
[1:35:34] and to the unwise.
[1:35:36] Who are you a debtor
[1:35:38] to? I got some friends and my my my
[1:35:41] my ones I feel close to and you know but
[1:35:46] I'm not really in debt to like the
[1:35:50] church, you know, my those that they got
[1:35:53] they got a problem with me. I'm not in
[1:35:54] debt to
[1:35:57] them. See where we're at? The word is
[1:36:00] right. The word is a is a is sharper
[1:36:04] than any two-edged sword, piercing even
[1:36:08] to the sunder of the soul and the body
[1:36:10] and discerning of the thoughts and
[1:36:12] intents of the heart. This word tells us
[1:36:13] where we're staying with God. This word
[1:36:16] tells us where we're standing with God.
[1:36:18] He said, "I am a debtor both to the
[1:36:19] Greeks, to the barbarians, to the wise,
[1:36:22] and to the
[1:36:25] unwise." People don't like feeling in
[1:36:27] debt. No one liked
[1:36:29] it. But we're in
[1:36:31] debt. I remember some some of you have
[1:36:34] heard me say to you before on my first
[1:36:37] job I got with a man named Paul Hines
[1:36:39] and he gave me a chance to work for him
[1:36:42] and I said I work for a week for
[1:36:43] nothing. It went like 18 years. Every
[1:36:46] time I seen him I would thank him for
[1:36:48] that job he gave me. I still felt in
[1:36:50] debt to him. Now he probably made money
[1:36:52] off of me. I'm sure he did. But that
[1:36:54] didn't matter because I felt in debt to
[1:36:56] him. Amen.
[1:36:58] The men that work for
[1:37:00] me, they thank me for a check every
[1:37:03] week. Well, they thank me even without
[1:37:05] the check. They thank me. But I am the
[1:37:08] one that feels in debt to them
[1:37:10] because they chose to spend their life
[1:37:12] helping me. Come on.
[1:37:16] The people who fill our propane tank,
[1:37:18] I've told them many times how much I
[1:37:20] thankful for them. The people who pray
[1:37:22] for me, I'm thankful for them. I'm in
[1:37:25] debt to them.
[1:37:28] Look what this power can do for
[1:37:32] you. Is what makes you live for others.
[1:37:36] All right. Last last set of verses.
[1:37:38] Okay. Four more verses. Are you with me?
[1:37:40] Can you say amen? Amen. All right. Thank
[1:37:42] you. 1 Corinthians 9:19. 1 Corinthians
[1:37:45] 9:19. For though I be free from all men.
[1:37:49] Yep. Christ died for me. I'm
[1:37:51] free. Yet I through self-will, through
[1:37:55] self-will, free moral agency, I have
[1:37:57] made myself a servant unto
[1:38:00] all. That doesn't happen automatically
[1:38:03] when you're set
[1:38:05] free. You have to like deny the flesh,
[1:38:08] crucify the
[1:38:10] flesh. Get a revelation of what you
[1:38:13] should be doing with your life. I have
[1:38:15] made myself servant unto all. And what's
[1:38:19] the reason that you've done that, Paul?
[1:38:21] that I might gain the
[1:38:24] more. And I'm just going to skip down to
[1:38:26] verse
[1:38:28] 22. To the weak became I as weak that I
[1:38:31] might gain the weak. I am made all
[1:38:32] things to all men that I might by all
[1:38:35] means save some. What's your motive of
[1:38:38] having a friend? Why do you want to get
[1:38:40] together with somebody and hang
[1:38:42] out? What what are you doing with your
[1:38:46] life? Because if we belong to God, God
[1:38:50] has has us on a plan to help
[1:38:55] others. And there's such
[1:38:57] power in feeling
[1:39:00] indebted. Without that, you got to do
[1:39:03] that. Oh, I got to do that. I shouldn't
[1:39:05] have to do
[1:39:07] that. Let's stand together. God wants to
[1:39:10] fill us with that power of
[1:39:13] indebtedness. There's power that comes
[1:39:15] with it. Don't be afraid of it.
[1:39:19] How many times have we been told that
[1:39:21] perfect love casteth out all fear?
[1:39:25] In other words, don't be afraid of fear.
[1:39:27] Face it. Face
[1:39:30] it. Well, I don't think I have faith
[1:39:32] enough to face the
[1:39:34] fear. Have love in God. Have love in
[1:39:39] God. Because when you love God, that
[1:39:41] faith will just come.
[1:39:44] And I'll say it like this. Don't worry
[1:39:46] about feeling in debt to somebody.
[1:39:48] Everybody that you look at, you should
[1:39:49] feel in debt
[1:39:51] to. I'm tell if we don't get any
[1:39:53] revelation, get this because this is
[1:39:56] where I help you to grow to become more
[1:39:58] like the nature of Christ because
[1:39:59] without it, you just don't have a reason
[1:40:01] to. Amen. Amen. Let's sing uh I
[1:40:06] surrender all. Let's sing that. Maybe
[1:40:09] there'd be someone here today that just
[1:40:10] feels that I haven't surrendered
[1:40:12] everything I want to surrender. Maybe
[1:40:14] God's spoken to you and you want to do
[1:40:15] it. And if there's not, that's fine,
[1:40:17] too. But I want to give this opportunity
[1:40:19] today before we
[1:40:21] dismiss. All to
[1:40:25] Jesus I
[1:40:28] surrender all to him. I freely give.
[1:40:35] I will ever love and trust him in his
[1:40:43] presence daily
[1:40:47] live.
[1:40:49] Surrender
[1:40:52] all. I
[1:40:55] surrender
[1:40:57] all. All to thee, my
[1:41:02] blessed Savior.
[1:41:05] I
[1:41:06] surrender
[1:41:09] all. All to Jesus I
[1:41:15] surrender humbly at his feet I
[1:41:21] bow. Worldly pleasures all
[1:41:26] forsaken take me Jesus take me now.
[1:41:33] I
[1:41:35] surrender
[1:41:38] all. I
[1:41:40] surrender
[1:41:43] all. All to thee, my blessed savior. I
[1:41:51] surrender
[1:41:54] all. All to Jesus I surrender.
[1:42:01] Make me savior holy
[1:42:05] thine. Let me feel the holy spirit truly
[1:42:13] know that thou art
[1:42:16] mine. I
[1:42:19] surrender
[1:42:21] all. I
[1:42:24] surrender
[1:42:27] all to thee. My blessed savior I
[1:42:34] surrender
[1:42:37] all. Oh to Jesus I surrender. Lord I
[1:42:45] give myself to
[1:42:48] thee. Fill me with thy love and power.
[1:42:54] Let thy blessings fall. Amen. And if we
[1:42:59] could just go ahead and bow our heads
[1:43:01] for just a moment before you can
[1:43:03] continue playing that. But if we pull
[1:43:05] that that verse back up
[1:43:12] there. Oh to Jesus I
[1:43:16] surrender. No, that last verse. I'm so
[1:43:19] sorry.
[1:43:20] Yeah. Make me savior, holy thine.
[1:43:24] No, the verse that we just sung, I just
[1:43:27] want to say maybe today with every head
[1:43:30] bowed, every eye closed, maybe there'd
[1:43:31] be someone here today, you
[1:43:34] know that you haven't surrendered
[1:43:38] everything. And that's okay. You can
[1:43:40] leave here. You can leave church today
[1:43:43] in that
[1:43:45] state. We're certainly not going to push
[1:43:47] or manipulate or make you even feel bad.
[1:43:51] But maybe there would be somebody here
[1:43:56] today that you really
[1:43:59] want that power and that
[1:44:03] love that God has for you by
[1:44:05] surrendering to
[1:44:07] him. You just say, "Brother John, would
[1:44:09] you remember me in prayer? I I I'm going
[1:44:11] to leave
[1:44:12] today dedicated to surrendering to
[1:44:16] Jesus." Just lift up your hand. I'm
[1:44:17] going to pray with you. I bless these
[1:44:19] hands. any others. Amen. What a very
[1:44:23] solemn, serious moment in the presence
[1:44:24] of almighty
[1:44:27] God. An intimate moment with Jesus
[1:44:31] Christ. Now, I just want you to believe.
[1:44:34] Jesus said, "Only believe." We heard the
[1:44:38] importance of believing last
[1:44:40] service. Only believe, but you must
[1:44:42] believe with all your heart. Amen.
[1:44:45] Heavenly Father, we bow before you in
[1:44:49] humble
[1:44:51] adoration with this this song in our
[1:44:54] heart. We're surrendering now to you,
[1:44:57] Lord. We're surrendering our
[1:45:00] life. We're surrendering our
[1:45:02] thoughts. We're surrendering our will.
[1:45:05] We're surrendering the things, Lord,
[1:45:07] that
[1:45:08] have have gotten in the way
[1:45:12] of living in the power that we desire to
[1:45:17] have that indebtedness and feeling free,
[1:45:20] happy, living for
[1:45:22] others. Lord, I pray for every hand that
[1:45:24] was raised. I pray for every heart and
[1:45:27] every desire in that heart. Lord, you
[1:45:30] see it. And I'm asking today in the name
[1:45:31] of Jesus Christ that you'd remove every
[1:45:34] power that would be trying to hold the
[1:45:36] people back from surrendering their life
[1:45:38] to you. Lord, you promised us blessings,
[1:45:42] manifold blessings in this life, in the
[1:45:44] life to come if we would just surrender
[1:45:46] all to
[1:45:48] you. And we come against every demonic
[1:45:51] spirit, every force, every power, every
[1:45:54] evil. We come against it in the almighty
[1:45:57] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:46:00] Lord, we command in your name, in your
[1:46:04] name, that your people be set free from
[1:46:06] everything that they may walk out of
[1:46:08] here with assurance in the simple faith
[1:46:11] that they have trusted you in this
[1:46:13] prayer and just surrendering through
[1:46:15] free more agency. Lord, that you would
[1:46:17] bless them now. Bless them. And when the
[1:46:20] temptation comes from anything, Lord, I
[1:46:23] pray that you would just remind them to
[1:46:25] take a stand for you and that may your
[1:46:28] great Holy Spirit come in the power and
[1:46:30] just give them great victory, Lord, in
[1:46:32] that at that moment. We thank you for
[1:46:35] these things now. We commit our life to
[1:46:37] you, Lord. We trust you for all this. We
[1:46:40] humbly pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:46:43] Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for
[1:46:46] doing this. What a wonderful God we
[1:46:49] serve. Amen. Amen. Let's paid. He uh
[1:46:52] paid uh singing that little chorus
[1:46:54] again. He paid a debt. He paid a
[1:47:00] debt. He paid a debt. He did not owe. I
[1:47:07] owed a debt. I could not pay. I needed
[1:47:14] someone to wash my sins
[1:47:18] [Music]
[1:47:20] away. And now I sing a brand new song.
[1:47:26] Amazing grace all day long. Christ Jesus
[1:47:32] paid a debt that I could never. Amen.
[1:47:37] Let's sing it one more time.
[1:47:40] He paid a debt he did not owe. I owed a
[1:47:46] debt I could not pay. I needed
[1:47:52] someone to wash my sins
[1:47:58] away. And now I sing a brand new song.
[1:48:04] Amazing grace all day long. Christ Jesus
[1:48:09] paid a debt that I could never
[1:48:17] pay. Are you thankful for that?
[1:48:20] Amen. And now you know what Jesus has
[1:48:23] done. He said, "Pick up your cross and
[1:48:26] follow me." Let's sing sing this with
[1:48:28] joy this time. Let's sing uh must Jesus
[1:48:31] bear the cross alone. No, we have a
[1:48:34] cross, too. Amen.
[1:48:37] Just think about this. Make love to
[1:48:39] Jesus as we sing this. Must it's an
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:45] F. Must
[1:48:48] Jesus bear the
[1:48:52] cross
[1:48:53] alone and all the world go free.
[1:49:01] No, there's a cross for
[1:49:07] everyone and there's a cross for
[1:49:16] me.
[1:49:18] Soed cross I'll bear till death shall
[1:49:24] set me free.
[1:49:29] and then go home. My crown to wear for
[1:49:36] there's a crown for
[1:49:41] me upon the
[1:49:45] crystal
[1:49:46] pavement down at
[1:49:50] Jesus
[1:49:51] pier feet.
[1:49:55] With joy I'll pass my
[1:49:59] golden crown and his dear name
[1:50:07] repeat. Oh
[1:50:09] preious cross, oh
[1:50:12] glorious crown, oh
[1:50:17] resurrection day.
[1:50:21] The
[1:50:22] angels from the stars come down and bear
[1:50:29] my soul away. That first verse again.
[1:50:34] Must
[1:50:35] Jesus bear the cross alone and all the
[1:50:43] world go free.
[1:50:47] know there's a cross for
[1:50:53] everyone and there a cross for me.
[1:51:01] Thank you, Lord. Amen. How many's
[1:51:03] thankful for the cross? Amen. Amen.
[1:51:08] Amen. What a what honor it is to
[1:51:11] actually share that suffering with
[1:51:14] Christ. Amen. Amen. I think one thing to
[1:51:17] help us what Jesus had when he was on
[1:51:20] the cross for the joy that was set
[1:51:21] before him. And I think as we're going
[1:51:24] through our trials, we're bearing our
[1:51:26] cross. I think if we could keep our mind
[1:51:29] full of joy,
[1:51:32] full of joy, this is going to help
[1:51:33] somebody.
[1:51:35] And if nobody if you're not really
[1:51:37] involved in anybody, nobody sees it, but
[1:51:40] then you believe that somebody's going
[1:51:42] to see your life and see Christ in your
[1:51:44] life somehow. You've got to fill your
[1:51:47] heart with joy with what you're going
[1:51:49] through. Amen. Let's sing one more song.
[1:51:52] If we could sing, count your blessings.
[1:51:54] Name them one by one.
[1:51:58] Amen. I think that's another thing we
[1:52:01] can do to help remind us how blessed we
[1:52:03] really are.
[1:52:05] Amen. If he never did another thing for
[1:52:07] us.
[1:52:12] When upon life's pillows you are tempest
[1:52:17] toss. When you are discouraged thinking
[1:52:21] all is lost. Count your many blessings.
[1:52:26] Name them one by
[1:52:28] one. And it will surprise you what the
[1:52:32] Lord have
[1:52:34] done. Count your blessings. Name them
[1:52:38] one by one. Count your blessings. See
[1:52:43] what God have done. Count your
[1:52:48] blessings. Name them one by one. Count
[1:52:52] your many blessings. See what God have
[1:52:56] done. Are you ever burdened with a load
[1:53:00] of
[1:53:01] care? Does the cross seem heavy? you are
[1:53:05] called to bear. Count your many
[1:53:09] blessings. Every doubt will
[1:53:12] fly. And you will be singing as the days
[1:53:17] go
[1:53:18] by. Count your blessings. Name them one
[1:53:22] by
[1:53:23] one. Count your blessings. See what God
[1:53:28] have done. Count your blessings. Name
[1:53:33] them one by one. Count your many
[1:53:36] blessings. See what God have
[1:53:39] done. When you look at others with their
[1:53:43] lands and gold, think that Christ has
[1:53:47] promised you his wealth
[1:53:50] untold. Count your many blessings money
[1:53:54] cannot buy. your reward in heaven nor
[1:53:59] your home on
[1:54:01] high. Count your blessings, name them
[1:54:05] one by
[1:54:07] one. Count your blessings, see what God
[1:54:11] have done. Count your
[1:54:15] blessings, name them one by
[1:54:18] one. Count your many blessings, see what
[1:54:22] God have done. Though amid the conflict
[1:54:27] whether great or
[1:54:30] small, do not be discouraged. God is
[1:54:34] over all. Count your many blessing.
[1:54:38] Angels will
[1:54:41] attend and give you to your jouries. And
[1:54:46] I believe that. Count your blessings.
[1:54:49] See what come by one. Count your
[1:54:54] blessings. See what God has
[1:54:57] done. Count your
[1:55:00] blessings. Name them one by
[1:55:04] one. Count your many blessings. See what
[1:55:08] God have
[1:55:11] done. Amen. Praise the
[1:55:16] Lord. May you leave count your
[1:55:19] blessings. May you leave counting your
[1:55:21] blessings.
[1:55:23] At the end of the day, wouldn't this be
[1:55:26] awesome? At the end of the day, get on
[1:55:30] the
[1:55:33] testimony, send the light testimony
[1:55:35] thread, and
[1:55:37] say, "I counted more blessings today
[1:55:40] than I've ever
[1:55:41] counted." Or, "I counted 832 blessings
[1:55:45] today in my life." What a testimony.
[1:55:50] And I I believe with all my heart you
[1:55:52] will feel better than if you didn't do
[1:55:54] it
[1:55:56] just if we could take time to remember
[1:55:58] all that God has done for us. Amen.
[1:56:00] Going to ask our brother Mike Helms if
[1:56:03] you would just to close the service in a
[1:56:05] word of prayer today.
