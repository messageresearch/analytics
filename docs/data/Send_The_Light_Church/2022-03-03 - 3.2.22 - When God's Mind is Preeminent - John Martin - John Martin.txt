lord it's so good to see brother and sister johnson here amen and we've seen brother johnson a couple of times but we haven't seen sister johnson and the last time they came it was a sunday night and we were not having service and they drove all the way to find out the parking lot was empty and we were one of those churches that stopped doing the sunday night services um when the covet struck but we're just grateful to the lord that they're here today god has kept them and they could be with us it's just always a great honor to have brother johnson with us before we get into prayer and the word i just had a few announcements i feel that if i don't read them now that i'll forget at the end but uh march 12th is a saturday and sunday the 13th we're going to have brother andrew glover with us for some special services and then uh brother roger rodriguez from venezuela he'll be with us sunday march 27th and the night before uh we're having the game uh the outreach game night that we had scheduled in january we rescheduled it for march 26 and that's where we we just want to try to locate a soul a new soul and try to befriend them in an atmosphere that's outside of the church but with the same godly people amen amen so let's take advantage of that because the more that there's there you know that it's such a help um and then we're having a special service on parenting march 20th that seemed to be the the best service um and so that'll be um we're going to uh if you have any questions on parenting how to deal with a certain situation how to handle this doesn't matter the age whatever it would be we want to do our best to help we're going to have a box we're going to sit in the back next week or on sunday and that'll give us a couple weeks if you want to just put the questions in there you don't have to put your name everything can be anonymous but we want to try to help the very best we can through the through the message and through the scriptures to help amen i'm so happy about us having children and uh their heritage unto the lord and uh we want to do everything we can to help them give them an opportunity to just give them the best because they're facing a lot of junk in the world a lot of terrible things amen before we start reading if we could let's look to the lord in prayer our heavenly father we thank you for the the great liberty that we have today to come and gather with ease all of us just been thinking about the uh the believers and the people of ukraine not having this freedom and liberty today lord we know one day to be taken away from us here in america the doors will be closed and today we want to thank you that you've given us this opportunity we do pray lord that you not only be with us but you would be with the believers of ukraine that you keep your your hand of protection upon them and lord we know ultimately uh destruction is coming but you're still in control and we're trusting in you uh lord for all things that are transpiring tonight we pray that you'd come and lord that you would prepare us for the rapture lord that you would prepare us for that catching away that we might be ready in that hour that would not be lacking that would not be found in the balances out out of balance but lord that we might be dressed properly please come and lord give us the revelation of your word tonight break this word to us and give us the understanding we need that we might be better christians lord we commit the service now yes your blessings down the reading of the word in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of philippians chapter 2 and then also colossians chapter 1. philippians chapter 2 verse number 5 reads let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus and then colossians just the next book over a few pages chapter one starting with verse number 17 and he speaking of jesus christ and jesus christ is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church we could say this church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence in our church in our midst amen for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell amen god bless you may be seated now earlier in this series we read a quote from christ is the mystery of god and brother branham said this is god's great mystery of love expressed that god and man became one see that's what god's achievement that's god's purpose to do that that he might be in christ in christ in us and all of us together be one this is god's great mystery of love expressed and that god and man could become one amen and i made mention that service that we're in the process we're in that process in which we are uniting with god's divine nature of love we're becoming more like christ that's where we should be now i want to continue in this series tonight of just god's consciousness we've been trying to get the complete image of christ what what does that mean i believe in order to see the image of christ we need to have the mind of christ import part four uh we let go of some things that we were holding on to things that we just wouldn't think that we would ever forgive somebody because of what they did we just let it go because it's part of god's nature to let it go to forgive and if we're going to become like him we got to act like him and and that's why jesus said if we don't he's he'll turn around and not forgive us so just think about it when you're forgiving some somebody that moment that you're doing that you're actually manifesting or shining the image of jesus christ in that moment we can't move forward without doing that now in part five tonight we want to see what happens when god has the preeminence in our mind amen brother branham said in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed he said that god had a threefold purpose in his mind first to express himself completely god in christ and we read the scripture for it please the father that in him the fullness of god's fullness would dwell but it doesn't stop there is his purpose didn't stop there but iran says second to have the preeminence in his church which is his body the bride till he come and have preeminence to express himself through them now i want us to catch this everything that god expressed in christ brother branham said god's second part of that purpose was to express himself that same self inside of us the bride and third to restore the kingdom to its rightful position brother brahm said that fell by sin by the first adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them and fellowshipped with them amen now why is this important because we're not just part of the purpose but we are the ones to fulfill the purpose we have a part to pray brother man says to restore back eden bring back that which was lost that which was that was the only thing out of order all the rest was in order brother branham said so we're going to try to break this down but the first purpose was to express all of himself through christ john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god the word was god and verse 14 the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld the glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and full of truth so this invisible god was made flesh and we behold we touched him we saw him this was god manifested in the flesh and first timothy 3 16 says without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for god was manifested in the flesh first or colossians chapter 1 verse 15 says jesus christ is in the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature brother brahm says if you really want to know who god is you look at jesus christ amen you know exactly who who god is he is the word and and so god fulfilled this purpose he fulfilled it but in order for god to express all of himself through christ he had to allow man to fall amen or else he would never express being a a savior or redeemer if if if if if man was perfect there would be a part of god that would not be able to be expressed and the bible says for it please the father that in him should all the fullness dwell so there was a part of god that wanted to be expressed and couldn't be expressed without man falling so man fell and and man uh realized that he needed stability in his life he needed a savior he needed to be redeemed he needed healing for his body and and through jesus christ we have the benefits of all those attributes that was in god amen now through the cross not only our sins could be raised their bodies could be healed but the great thing our selfish our selfish nature our self-willed beastly nature could be changed through the holy ghost god can change our very nature back to what the image that was at the beginning in the garden that's why the bible says through faith we can do all things through christ who strengthens us so this is not something that's far-fetched this is not something that happens after the rapture takes place or unwraps your door this is happening service by service from glory unto glory it's how much you put into it is how much you get out of it now this first purpose of god was to express all of himself through christ he couldn't have done that unless the father had preeminence in jesus there was something that jesus had to do the bible says that he learned obedience to the things he suffered jesus had to deny his will he had to say not my will thy will be done amen he said i do nothing except the father shows me first it's all showing and pointing back that that jesus was giving the father preeminence and the second purpose of god was to express all of himself again through us branham says all that was in god he poured into christ and all that was in christ he poured into the church it's christ in you the hope of glory but in order to have this he has to have that preeminence in the church he has to have the preeminence in us amen so we have to learn to do the same things that jesus did we have to learn to say not my will father but thine be done we have to we have to learn to to obedience by the things that we suffer we have to learn not to do anything except he shows us first what to do we read and he is the head of the body the church the beginning the firstborn of the dead that in all things he wants the preeminence that's all i can say our flesh don't want to give it to him none of our flesh all flesh is bad it doesn't uh it's it's carnal it it doesn't ever want to die out so we have we have a part to play amen now first of all just because we believe we are predestinated it doesn't mean that we are right now if you are predestined you have to believe that you're predestined in it but just because you believe you're predestined doesn't mean you're predestinated this is what's what's real hard about this subject but if we are predestined this is what i want to tell you you will continue to mature more and more into the image of god there's no doubt about that amen you can't say you're predestinated and don't mature and don't grow it just doesn't exist to me this is a great mystery that's been hid from the believers who don't love god with all their heart because it's easy to say well i believe i believe i believe i'm predestined but they don't pay attention to their lives yet they have the knowledge of predestined and they claim to believe that they are brother branham said lucifer thinks and exalts himself above the word of truth by the knowledge of revelation just think about that not the revelation but the knowledge of the revelation he can get people to believe just by knowledge that's why we have to hold ourselves accountable to the revelation amen because knowledge just puffs you up the love of god will edify it will it it will help not just only let god have preeminence in your life but you'll be working at restoring the kingdom amen fulfilling the purpose of god now the message explains that if we're predestined nothing can stop it from happening and we believe that and we want we all want to rally behind that that's this great understanding but the message also teaches us that our nature will be conformed to the image of christ it's in our daily walk how we handle life how we conduct ourselves this is all in the message of the hour but it's hid from those now listen to this who enjoy selective hearing you're only listening for what you want to listen for you only want to say amen to the things that you enjoy about the message but as the bride is predestined we've got to adhere to even the hardest things that the prophet said that this gospel said that jesus said you have to now romans 8 28 one of our favorite scriptures we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose now i believe when brother brennan brings this out this a threefold purpose this is the purpose and we'll get into it the degree of love that's being defined here is according to his purpose to them who are called according to his purpose because brother brian says you can love god every day and still go to hell it's not just saying i love god but it has to be to the degree that you you are called to the purpose of his his his threefold purpose that he's called to get restored back to the kingdom god don't want us to remain the way we are we have to become in his image [Music] and it takes that love to do that because only the love of god in you is going to make you deny your flesh right they overcame by the land by the word of the testimony they love not their lives unto the death that that love for god has to be so strong that you're willing to bring your your body under subjection and obey the word of god and and and start putting this into action you know we may not have to uh face the red sea and and giants in the promised land but we heard last service we got our own giants and we got to face those things not ignore them i'll live over here they'll you know coexistence can't do that we've got to love god with all of our will all of our mind all of our our heart our spirit our might our soul our strength and in order to do that we got to die daily amen it takes that amount of love to fulfill god's second full purpose which is that to have the preeminence in us there's no other way because he's not going to force himself in our life we've got to invite him we got to kick out the trash we got to we got to show god this is a part this is a relationship that's what the rich young ruler was missing what what must i what must i do give up everything the same thing we do let god be preeminent in your life but the rich young ruler didn't allow christ to be preeminent in his life right this it's got to happen amen the bible says all things work together for the good to them that love god why because you love them so much you've given them control you've given them preeminence in your life so in other words everything that's transpiring god's in front of it orchestrating it allowing it and everything that god does is good everything he did in genesis was good everything that he does today is good he don't do any bad things he don't do shady things that's why you know it's going to work out for the good because god's behind it giving god preeminence in your life is the key to being conformed into the image of god amen amen now the third purpose of god's threefold purpose is to restore his kingdom ultimately god wants to bring us back to the way that things originally were in the garden and in the garden he had preeminence he had preeminence until eve decided not to obey restoration has always been in the mind of christ from the very beginning amen so this is the the third part of god's eternal purpose is to restore his kingdom back think about it all all the way from the garden through everything that we read the old testament everything in the new testament everything that's happening now us kind of looking towards what's you know what what's going to be happening uh when tribulation sets in god has this threefold purpose in mind and he wants to bring a restoration to his kingdom and we're part of that we're a part of that amen isn't that beautiful that's why you could say i know the thoughts i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace not of evil to but to give us an expected in so god wants to restore us he wants to reveal to us that he is a restorer he wants to express himself as a restorer he he doesn't give up on you he doesn't quit he doesn't stop he he he keeps going on because that's what the love of god does it bears all things it endures all things it holds all things it doesn't quit that's why we need to have confidence that he which have begun a good work he's going to he's going to perform it unto the day of jesus christ remember when boaz took ruth to be his wife in ruth chapter 4 verse 14 the bible says and the woman said unto naomi blessed be the lord which have not left thee this day without a kinsmen that his name may be famous in israel and he shall be unto thee what a restorer of life and a nourisher of thine own age for thy daughter-in-law which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven sons have borne him god has not left us today without a kinsmen amen and i'll tell you his name is famous in israel his name is famous in fenton michigan and he shall be unto thee a restorer of life god wants us to know that he's a restorer it's part of him now why am i going through this because we have to become that we have to become a restorer in order for restoration to take place we have to do our part if we want god to restore his image inside of us to restore us back to to acting the way he acts and handling things the way he handles them to turn the cheek to go the extra mile we have to learn to do our part first to lay down our life to deny our will to to to not give in to what this flesh wants to do pretty much on a continual basis it's the only way restoration because we can't be restored going to church two times a week and say i hope that just gets the job done it will not get the job done because this is a realness between us and god your people she said shall be my people your god shall be my god that's the attitude we need to take we hear the word of god this is for me this is what you believe this is what i believe this is what the prophet said this is what i believe psalms 23 verse 1 the lord is my shepherd i shall not want why does everybody skip over that part he maketh me look at this he maketh me to lay down the green passage he leads me beside steel boys he restoreth my soul he leads me in the paths of righteousness for my name's sake when we give god preeminence he has his way in us bible says we're the spirit of the lord is there's liberty but you have to do your first part i shall not want amen when god told you to go to church you can't say i don't want to god says it's time to pray a little bit more than you've been praying you can't say i don't want to right amen if where we learn to let god have the preeminence in the church is we learn to let god have preeminence in our homes in our personal lives we don't want to grow in knowledge right right because satan wants to offer us the bogus which is the knowledge of the revelation we want to grow in the revelation of the truth yes the violence is grow in knowledge but not the knowledge of the revelation the true knowledge of christ because there's an ever learning but never coming to the knowledge of the truth acts chapter 1 verse 6. and it's okay if uh you know we say the more we sit in the back the less amends are here go out there take out the last two rolls and get you up closer you say amen acts chapter one verse six and when their when they therefore come together they asked him asked of him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them look at the answer it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father put into his own power in other words stop trying to figure out russia stop trying to figure out china stop trying to figure out rome and the antichrist and and and when the tribulation and and and when the bombs are going to go and when the california is going to drop off stop trying to figure it out you want to figure something out try to figure out how to get more into christ's image that's where you should be trying to figure out how to become more like him dressed in his righteousness fulfilling his purpose because we i'm not against those things but what i am against is is it really has god really given that to you to know if he does he'll just show it to you seek ye first the kingdom and his righteousness and let god take care of the rest now look what he said here but you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses for me both in jerusalem and judea and sumerian into the other most parts of the earth so what has he given him power for right now to fulfill the third part of his eternal purpose which is to restore the kingdom it isn't restoring a house the kingdom is man he lives in man i didn't want to say anything in our in our men's meeting but some of the same scriptures that brother roger talked about he did such a i feel a really good job in the men's meeting today talking to us about the importance of discipling amen and that's what this restoration is all about that's the part that we play god has given us power to fulfill his eternal purpose the part that we play we can't do anything about the first part because that was god in christ the fullness of the godhead was we didn't have nothing to do with that all of god was poured into christ but christ had to die out in order for the father to have preenamous the bible says he humbled himself and became obedient even obedient unto death even the death of the cross so imagine you know jesus got the flesh of jesus got his way and he said father there's some other way you know just i'm going to call for 12 legions of angels right now so our flesh this is a real situation with us a lot of times we don't want to die out you know we're looking for another way to be bright to make it in to to claim some predestination without becoming into the image of christ but the only way we can is we got to let god have pray on us we got to die out to our flesh it's got to be a real situation to us now we have a major role a major role to play in god's second part of this threefold purpose as christ christ cannot have preeminence in the church unless we allow it that's why some people can sit in church for years and never change here the word goes in one ear and out the other why some people hear the word in a short time their life is changing it's like wow wow wow wow because there's a realness that's taking place right the bible says that the word effectively works in those who believe it i'm paraphrasing that verse but you know what you've heard it before christ cannot be preowned in our life unless we learn on a regular basis to yield to practice it every day have thine own way lord we sung about it and that last verse we sung it twice till till people see christ only always in us that's only gonna happen if we're yielding to the lord because it's not a popular situation you will be put to the test people will come against you if god never becomes preeminent in us his third part his third part of that purpose will never be fulfilled in us and if it's never fulfilled in us we'll never be able to help fulfill his purpose now understand this is all about us being a part of god's great purpose that started at the beginning to the end that's what we're talking about you know we are in our own lives we do our own things we got our own things going our own goals and we want to we come to church with our own thoughts of what we want i i'm not against any of it but the mind of god is so much greater than that it and it we're extending into an eternal purpose that god had in his mind that he's still there he's still thinking about it when we leave church we lead church we're going to go to our own things but i'll tell you in god's mind he's still thinking about the restoration that needs to take place when god's mind is preeminent us we will be working to carry out his eternal purpose when god's mind is preeminent us that's the name of the message we will be working at carrying out his eternal purpose think about what you've been carrying out and when it's not you know what we'll be carrying out our purposes our plans what we got going how we're going to do things if god's mind isn't preeminent we will be totally distracted from carrying out god's purpose but if god's mind is preeminent we'll simply be carrying out his purpose so it's it's important not just to have the mind of christ in part but to be walking with it to be asking god lord i don't want anything but you're minding me because as soon as we start talking about this and doing that you know what's gonna happen you're gonna forget all about the restoration of his kingdom well brother john it's not my part it's not my job to be a part of the restoration that's that's not the right attitude turn with me if you would do second corinthians chapter five second corinthians chapter five i wanna start with verse number eight now we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord boy we all could say that now right i just want to get out of here he goes on to say wherefore we labor that we that whether we we present that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him so now i don't believe works get you to heaven but paul's making a statement here that god don't like lazy people and if you want to be accepted whether you're present or absent you need to labor just laying the foundation here so he says for we must all appear before the judgment of the seat of christ that we that everyone may receive the things he'd done in his body according to what he has according to that he have done whether it be good or bad i'll just say it like this you may define your purposes in life as not bad but i'll say like this brother branham said you're always in the will of god when you're doing missionary work because it's part of the threefold purpose it's the restoration of the kingdom now we all got things we've all got hobbies we all got lots of aspirations and things that we're going to be doing but somewhere down the line we got to give an account for our labors are you with me okay now look at keep the same theme going because that's what it is it ain't something different knowing therefore the terror of the lord that we're really going to be before the lord we persuade men now we're going right to this restoration it's not about us anymore it's not about us in the image of christ it's not just about us saying we're predestinated right it's now about us working at persuading somebody that howl's right around the corner he says but we are made manifest unto god and i trust also are made manifest in your conscience for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that he may have you may have somewhat to answer them which glory and appearance and not in heart he always got that there's three types of believers in every church for whether we be beside ourselves it is to god or whether we sober it is for your cause for the love of christ constraineth us you see that brother roger is that what you said in the men's meeting what does it constrain us to do to persuade men amen something inside of us knowing the terror of the lord this is a real situation hell is real there's no other way for a person to make it outside of jesus christ this is a real situation so everybody's opinion out there in the world as well is much looser than that and it's our job to convince them if we don't convince them they we may be god's mouthpiece to them the only mouthpiece we don't know we don't know what's going to happen after you leave that situation but it's a serious thing and here's the thing the love in your heart wants to see that person who isn't where they need to be restored restored because it's part of god's purpose see it's you're you've you gave up your mind you've taken on the mind of christ when you have the mind of christ he's thinking about his eternal purpose this is the problem we take our mind we go through the course of the week and we go do our own thing we come back to church and we try to understand what in the world's going on spiritually and we there's too much disconnect we got to stay focused it ain't changing god's eternal purpose ain't changing in 2023 still on track from the beginning because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead in other words we're not in control love controls us now when we become dead to ourself and his love moves us to live for others to to help them to see that the direction they're going isn't going to lead them to a happy ending a couple quotes i want to read i got a bunch of quotes tonight i hope that's okay brother branham said remembering the lord he says if you dwell in love you dwell in god and for god is love they that dwell in god dwell in love see and love has no hatred it has no jealousy it's not puffed up love does not behave itself uh misbehave itself love is always gentle sweet forgiving kind no matter how bitter the other is love remains itself in other words we don't have an excuse anymore why we acted the wrong way when we don't act the right way i'm sorry that wasn't the love of god and that's it shows this is a perfect example of how we need to let god be preeminent in us or will never manifest his image now i love this brother brahm says love is the ultimate of grace we're saved by grace love is the ultimate of grace love is god's ultimately for us i don't know what that word means i didn't look it up but you're catching the the theme here the spirit after all other gifts and things have vanished our prophecies or tongues or interpretations all that we've ever done or what more when love comes in it's the ultimate it's above all because all others fail but it's the supreme court decision amen love is the supreme court that's why love can cover a multitude of sin amen it's the thai post it's the north star that keeps the the semen level it's the compass that guides us love is the ultimate he said let's remember it amen brother brandon said in one place he said when divine love has been projected and comes to its end if it's real divine love its destination sovereign grace will then take over so we have a part to play we just can't expect well if they're gods if you know something between them and god what is that what about god and you what about manifesting the image why you put it on god's shoulders when it should be you that should be yielding yourself to god more somebody's got to shine in this this hour somebody's got to say if it's for nobody lord this word is for me verse 15 and that he died for all and they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again now here's the problem with this we live we're all living for god right just like we all love god but are we all living for god with everything we got right i mean if i live for god five minutes i'm still living for god but is that the message that is teaching us so we all have to do the self-evaluation when the word is being preached we have to say lord am i living unto myself we have to do it if we don't do it how's the lord going to speak to us all right so think about this we should not uh live on to ourselves but unto him that died for us and rose again now what is how do we how do we live unto him that means we're laboring we're a servant of christ we're laboring and god will hold us accountable to our laboring that's what paul started out when we started reading this we're all going to stand before the judgment seat of christ god is watching if we're living for ourselves or if we're living for souls are we occupying our time with saving souls persuading men convincing men or are we spending our time fulfilling our purpose so what is the image of christ in you today what is the image of christ in you today verse 16 wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh yeah though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new once we have given god preeminence in our life he will make a new creature out of us he will not let us to remain the same because our flesh all flesh is just stinky to him our thoughts that's why we got to repent of our thoughts because that's not pleasing to him but when we give him preeminence then our nature changes just like jesus christ and we'll do we'll finish the work jesus said i come to do the work of my father and uh it pleased him that i i worked for him and he said at the on the cross it's finished he did his his part now the holy ghost is working through us to finish the work to finish the work all right verse 18 and all things are of god all things now are of god he's got the preeminence who have reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and what happens as soon as we give him preeminence or he takes preeminence and all things are of god in her life he gives us the ministry of restoring fulfilling the third part of god's eternal purpose amen christ the mystery of god revealed this is that love affair we we start bringing the word to someone who's lost something inside of us can't stand them seeing being lost the more preeminent god is in a man the more he will use him to restore others brother branham said something like this if god could just get one man in his hands he turned the world upside down and he referred uh to moses in egypt but what did the mind of christ do in moses it delivered the people it restored the people and if god just has complete control he will take your body he will take your mind he will take your talents and he will go restore some soul amen he's not going to put you off in the court saying oh it doesn't matter you don't have to do that no we need a vision we need a vision without a vision there's so many people that will perish we need a revelation of the image of christ what did the mind of christ do in those disciples yeah he taught them for three and a half years but he still could not entrust them to go witness until they received him inside of them think about that but soon as the holy ghost came inside of them they started restoring they started bringing people to to jesus christ they started getting people to repent and get baptized he started restoring the kingdom back what was it the first day 5000 were saved they were restoring the kingdom was being restored and today the kingdom is still being restored he's just looking for restorers he's looking for the church that will give him preeminence to keep working and restoring but the devil is trying to get us just looking out in the world what's happening out here and this and that and you know building our reputation and our kingdom and doing this and can't wait for that and you know god's kingdom just god help us amen god help us we need a real media with god and where his presence comes down we need a a revelation of the image of christ the full image amen it's not just that god gives me everything i want or need or he supplies our needs or is my comforter and if this is how you view the image of christ then you need to do that for others if you think all god is is he's here to meet all my needs well then if you think that's the image of christ that's what you should be doing think about it we're predestined to be in his image the same image the bible says that uh christ laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our life for the brethren i mean i'm just i'm just expressing if that's part of the gospel that you believe that that's the image of christ then you ought to be doing that but in reality that's only part of the image of god brother branham said that god was not some daddy old grandpa that just gives you everything you want when you want it there's so more to the image of christ than that when all things are of god he gives us the ministry of reconciliation that means we have to go to work we actually have to go do something that isn't just for our flesh let's read verse 17 to with that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and had committed unto us the word of reconciliation he's given us the very word that we need to reconcile others you got to believe it now then we are ambassadors for christ remember remember you remember when the warning went out and our embassy uh they they pulled our embassy out of ukraine you know poland let's pull out our embassy everybody pulled their embassies out because ukraine was getting attacked you know i feel that sometimes as christians we pull the embassy out when the when the battle gets too tough and we're too afraid to represent the image of eternal love the love of god that lays down in his life at the time but we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ said now you get reconciled to god that's what we need to be doing get restored back to god he's restoring the kingdom amen for he have made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be the maybe the righteousness of god in him it is this great image of christ when all things are passed away and all things are new and all things are of god that the divine love of god constrains us to go hunt out i'll say it like this our fallen brethren those who don't know christ or those maybe who slipped away from christ now the reason for this is because this is what god wants in the third part of his eternal purpose it's part of the restoration it's not us sitting back and just watching god restore somebody has to god has to be working through somebody there has to be missionaries there has to be people who go out and share the gospel there has to be somebody that believes go ye out somebody has to be a disciple now god has given each one of us the ministry of reconciliation every one of us he may have not given every one of us the opportunity to stand behind a pulpit and preach to somebody but he's given every one of us a chance to go out into the world and minister restore bring christ to them whether it's one-on-one you're having a bible study in your home you gather five people it doesn't matter what matters is that your motive needs to be restore them to christ brother branham said in the message my new ministry he said that's god that's part of god's program preaching is his program when we look upon when he looked upon the multitude he said the harvest is right the laborers are for you pray the lord of the harvest that he will send laborers into his harvest how many remember that congregation says amen well why would they have to pray to the lord of harvest to send laborers into the harvest if the lord of the harvest was standing right there knowing it would be done why does god want us to do that god has so arranged it he says now you listen to this god has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and i as long as we're not doing what god is leading us to do we're paralyzing his program but when the church moves by the anointing of the holy ghost then we are in god's will we're doing his program for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god god is leading us to fulfill his purpose amen not just leading me to buy my next car my next whatever but leading me to win a soul what is god leading us to do to fulfill his eternal purpose he doesn't want us paralyzing his program he's looking for believers that says i want to work use me lord amen amen i'll tell you the way that we we won't paralyze the program of god we have to learn every day to get up and say to deny yourself that day what you want to do you have to actually give yourself to god you have to say lord whatever you want me to do if it ain't in my mind i'll pray this moment you put it in my heart and mind what you want me to do the bible says we through the spirit we have to mortify the deeds of the flesh keep our body under subjection the ministry of reconciliation i just want to emphasize this is not just behind the pulpit brother ram said just one soul is worth ten thousand worlds remember he left the 99 when he went after the one think about that would we be out of god's will if we just left the pulpit and we went after one think about these these these thoughts we don't put enough emphasis on reaching out to somebody outside these doors we put too much emphasis behind the pulpit here look we need to take what we're hearing here and go do it amen amen we need to take what we're hearing here and go do it amen not just taking what we're hearing here and leave and then just wait to the next paul said the love of christ constrains us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that if he died for all they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him that died for him and rose again so what does paul do what does paul do he said in first corinthians 9 19 think about this you could put you should about to put yourself in paul's shoes right here first corinthians 9 19 for though i be free god jesus set me free though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all and why is that because i'm not one of those people that says i'm in i only care about me something inside of me the love of christ constraineth me that i might gain the more i want to duplicate myself brother roger amen and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the laws as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law to them that are without the law as without the law uh being not without law to god but under the law of christ that i might gain them that are without the law to the weak became as weak that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all men that i might by all means whatever it takes save some paul knew the odds were against him that when he went out to deliver jesus christ to somebody that the majority of them was going to not just reject him but tear down his reputation want to kill him want to stone him the majority think about it i know we're hunting for the seed but except the majority won't take it but will you make a sir make yourself a servant unto everybody make that world your parish go out there and whoever you see share christ with him time is running out amen i don't want to be sitting here just waiting for the coming of the lord when god wants me out there getting that last seed now i'm not saying the last seed is going to come from fenton but you know every one of us has the last seed we're going to get amen every one of us has a last seed we're going to get and we should be thinking about that ministry and feeling that that love just swell up in a heart for that god never intended to give us the holy ghost just to satisfy ourselves it was to lead us into all truth and part of that truth i'll say it like this is to help fulfill the the eternal purpose of god and to restore his kingdom the kingdom is in people it's in the hearts of people brother brandon said in the message what was the holy ghost given for he said that's the purpose of the holy ghost it's the father again god the father dwelling in you working out his plans to finish his plan of redemption just think of that statement you don't have to believe me but believe the prophet he just said everything that i said listen the purpose of the holy ghost is the father again god the father dwelling in you working out his plan to finish his plan of redemption amen working through you making you a co-worker with him giving you a place giving you part a part for your fallen lost brother and sister giving you the spirit and his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the garden of eden adam adam where art thou kathy betty shoe tom where art thou i don't know your name sir i don't know your name madam but where art thou are you in christ to finish the plan made you a co-worker think about it is that real if you can believe it the problem is we're filling our mind with the news we're filling our mind with all of our plans instead of working on god's plan of redemption we're working on our own plans he said that's what the holy spirit does to a man or a woman and i'll say it like this that's what the holy ghost does to a man or woman where that man or woman gives the holy ghost preeminence when it strikes into their heart and takes a bold there's a thirsting and a hungering for lost souls your flesh is probably not going to like me after this service i'll bet we'll probably get some thoughts on the way home i know the devil it's the devil he said and that's what's the matter with the meetings today there's not enough spirit touch to it to go for souls of the lost and the dying it's more about let's make them let's make a name for ourselves a church a building a denomination instead of a soul-winning program he said how predictable he said we can say a lot on that in the message christ is a mystery of god can i keep going i just got some quotes i think would be really helpful for us brother brahm said it's a revelation it's the eternal it's as eternal as god's word is eternal look but the three-fold purpose of god's great mystery is revealed god's manifested in christ christ manifested in the church in order to redeem the lost eve back to the original condition in the garden of eden see we're at brother branton says man has always had a hard time he's always looked about look past what what christ has did for him or he's always looking to the future what he's going to do and he's missing what god's trying to do for him right now and we've got to see i know it's not in the newspapers it's not on fox news and we're not hearing it from our brothers and sisters we're not hearing it from our family members but i'll tell you god is here and he's letting us know that he's in the midst of fulfilling restoring his kingdom and he's looking for laborers today i believe it with all my heart a man running from the presence of the lord i've read this quote a number of times he says how wishy-washy that's what too many christians are today they're so soft-soaked and everything until they think all they have to do is go join a church go in somewhere put their name on the book and do a little something jump up and down shout out or something like that call it christianity he said christianity is in every day so think outside of the church here it's in every day it's a rugged life living for god in this present world not the future world the present world he said it's a constant burning of the fire and love of god right the love of god constrains us in the heart that sets you of fire and puts you out yonder with people and making converts for christ he said it's responsibilities he says we must accept our responsibility that's what it boils down to if god never gets preeminence in us he's we're never going to go out there hunting souls because we're just too busy doing our own things and i know this this may not be a message that makes us feel good but i want us to have the truth amen because it's god's gonna work through free more agency amen first corinthians 15 58 we we want to occupy till jesus comes therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord think of all the things that you've done in life that you look back and said that was a waste time a waste of money a waste of effort that was a bad idea i shouldn't have done that but when it comes to working for the lord god's not forgetful he doesn't forget our labors but this is an hour when it's getting darker there's a very little light we need to work while we can because the night's coming when we won't be able to work but i don't think we're there yet right something inside of me says we need to be reaching out more amen we don't want to get comfortable in church don't get comfortable until you've got somebody sitting next to you that haven't been in church yet then get comfortable let's stand together god bless you i had like a couple pages of notes left i was just going over and brother branham was preaching and he had like 20 something pages left and it was at the end of the service much could be said on this great subject when god has the preeminence in our mind amen not just lending him to mind every now and then but has the preempts our goal is to get let god have preeminence and he'll use us to fulfill his his will is that your desire amen let's look to the lord in prayer our heavenly father we are frail we're humans with faults and weaknesses temptations and we get distracted and we come short of your glory often our only hope is you inside of us the hope of glory lord we want to make you happy with our lives we want to we want you smiling we want we want to be used by you to have heaven rejoice over one soul and lord you see our hearts today i pray that you would take our lives and that you would direct us more into restoring your kingdom to be thinking more through the course of the days that lay before us not to allow the distractions of so many things to get in front of you lord be the center of our lives fulfill your will in our lives and take the preeminence in our mind lord we're letting the mind of christ be in us today and we want to take it with us and we want to remember these words tomorrow we want to wake up with a plan to to to to adjust the sale and and and to make sure that we're hunting the lost souls lord that are out there we know it's going to be hard we know it's going to be rugged the prophet told us and we've experienced it lord but help us not to be discouraged by that because we we know that there's still some out there help us to become all things to all people that lord we would win some give us that vision lord give us that power of the holy ghost lord we thank you for these things we are in debt to you lord we ask it humbly in jesus christ's precious name amen thank
