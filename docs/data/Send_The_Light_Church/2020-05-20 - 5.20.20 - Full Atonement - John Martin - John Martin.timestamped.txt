[15:43] in us we can't help but to go hunt
[15:47] people down even if they don't want to
[15:49] be hunted down
[15:50] because there's such a love in God's
[15:53] heart for people and he doesn't even
[15:58] have any pleasure in the death of the
[16:00] wicked his love is so great
[16:03] amen let's take our prayer request
[16:06] before the Lord we could just maybe

[18:32] they just just leaves somehow and let's
[18:36] just pray that God would be merciful to
[18:38] us and let's continue to pray for those
[18:42] in authority making decisions and so

[29:35] trusting my baby
[29:39] girl is coming

[29:47] soul burn up all the drawers and
[29:51] sanctify me holes make the consecration
[29:56] trusting God and in
[29:59] the Holy Ghost coming

[30:32] hair Christ would say make the
[30:35] consecration
[30:36] trusting God and
[30:39] the Holy Ghost coming
[30:56] trusting God and
[30:59] the Holy Ghost come pay more time
[31:04] the Holy Ghost
[31:13] I
[31:13] think
[31:15] concentration testing on in pain
[31:19] the holy ghost come here
[31:24] hey men that's what we want tonight is
[31:29] to let the Holy Ghost come inside
[31:33] and
[31:35] reveal to us
[31:37] himself so his church can be built more
[31:41] inside of us and that we could walk more
[31:43] in truth
[31:45] the truth that he has for us to walk in
[31:48] that
[31:49] if I could say it like this all of us
[31:52] have more truth to be walk-in and yes
[31:55] we're walking into the message but the
[31:57] message is still being revealed he's
[31:59] given us a fivefold ministry to bring us
[32:02] to that if I could say it like this a
[32:03] perfect walk Amen a perfect lie even
[32:07] when
[32:10] Abraham was walking with a with God God
[32:15] still told him to walk before me and be
[32:19] perfect and
[32:22] Enoch kept walking with the Lord and
[32:27] his walk kept getting closer and closer
[32:29] brother Brandon said till one day he was
[32:31] just closer to heaven then he was here
[32:34] and God just took him so we're here
[32:36] today that we might draw closer to the
[32:39] Lord and know him in a greater measure
[32:41] and be able to walk closer to him than
[32:44] we did when we came he then now I got to
[32:48] before we be open to scriptures they got
[32:51] thinking about this this thought and I'm
[32:54] sure you would agree with me it is much
[32:57] harder to
[32:59] get in to the service or to the word
[33:03] when we're live-streaming
[33:05] it's
[33:07] it's very hard I mean if you think about
[33:10] it sometimes we listen to a tape a
[33:13] message tape
[33:14] kind of like background trying to maybe
[33:17] do two things at one time and sometimes
[33:19] we were just maybe looking for an answer
[33:21] about something and we we begin to use
[33:24] it in such a way of not as full
[33:28] potential and
[33:30] we're used to you know when we come to
[33:32] church this is it this is where God's
[33:34] going to speak to me and I'll say it
[33:37] like anyone that's desiring to receive
[33:40] more of the Lord to the live streaming
[33:42] so
[33:44] much of it I'll just say a hundred
[33:47] percent of it for you depends on your
[33:50] preparation
[33:52] if you're in the spirit I'm telling you
[33:55] God is gonna pour out his blessing but
[33:58] if you're not and you're expecting that
[34:00] the ministry or somehow through it that
[34:04] you're going to just maybe grab
[34:06] something here or there I think we're
[34:08] gonna come up short of the valuable
[34:10] enough that's in front of us because you
[34:12] know brother Branham gave us the message
[34:14] or God did give us the message to the
[34:16] Prophet enrapturing faith lies in those
[34:18] tapes now if we listen those tastes with
[34:20] just a nonchalant
[34:21] we're not gonna probably receive as much
[34:23] from God as if we put our whole heart
[34:26] and our attitude our love and our desire
[34:28] hunger nor thirst and so it is a lot of
[34:30] times when we're watching things on the
[34:32] internet watching things on TV or
[34:35] watching things on our cell phone and
[34:38] we're we're hearing so many different
[34:41] things so many different views about the
[34:44] opening and the closing and the
[34:46] coronavirus and the start and the finish
[34:48] there's are so many things out there
[34:50] that work we get in this habit of what
[34:53] we're listening to everything with a
[34:54] grain of salt because we don't know what
[34:56] to believe
[34:57] well we kind of end up carrying that
[35:00] same type of mentality into the church
[35:04] and what we need to be coming is with a
[35:07] completely different mindset a mindset
[35:08] of this is you and me Lord this is I
[35:12] know you've got something for me because
[35:14] I've been praying about I've been seek
[35:16] and I've been hunger and I've been
[35:17] desiring this and I think the more that
[35:20] we can adapt our attitude to just
[35:21] perfectly pleasing to you I believe the
[35:24] more that will bow to benefit so that's
[35:25] just for those that are desiring
[35:27] something more than what they've been
[35:29] able to really get may the Lord bless
[35:32] each of you in those efforts now before
[35:36] I forget we want to set a date
[35:40] to go back and have service together
[35:44] again and it's going to be the last
[35:47] Sunday of this month that's going to be
[35:51] may 31st
[35:54] the band should be lifted then but we
[35:57] don't know for sure because anything
[36:00] could happen but
[36:02] we're going to do everything that we can
[36:05] to
[36:09] to come together and create an
[36:12] atmosphere that we trust will be a
[36:15] blessing for those that can gather
[36:16] together
[36:18] we're going to provide masks we're going
[36:22] to practice social distancing
[36:26] and
[36:27] but we're not
[36:30] asking anybody to wear a mask we're not
[36:36] telling anybody to wear a mask but if
[36:39] you wear a mask we're so happy that
[36:42] you're wearing a mask if you don't wear
[36:43] masks were we're happy that you're not
[36:45] wearing a mask you're there to worship
[36:47] the Lord now if there's any underlying
[36:49] issues any kind of sicknesses or things
[36:51] like that just at this time you know
[36:54] before the corner virus you know a
[36:56] little sniffle was you know kind of okay
[36:58] and then you know when you got a fever
[37:01] we'd say you know stay back but now what
[37:03] does coronavirus if there's any sense of
[37:05] any sickness just in respect to others
[37:08] would be good to stay home until that's
[37:10] you know gone
[37:12] so there will be some sitter Cathleen
[37:16] wanted us to make mention of this and I
[37:19] really appreciate her sister
[37:21] helping us to do things right
[37:25] she wanted us to make mention make it
[37:27] clear that some will have some people
[37:30] probably wear masks and some people
[37:32] won't and if you know that some people
[37:34] are not going to be a mask maybe you
[37:36] would feel uncomfortable being there and
[37:38] you wouldn't want to be there and so we
[37:40] want to tell you that ahead of time but
[37:42] I believe with our respect for one
[37:46] another respect for the word respect for
[37:49] this virus as it were
[37:52] we want to do everything we can and
[37:55] we'll do everything we can to to protect
[37:58] I mean I think people get a will get
[38:01] closer in grocery stores is going
[38:04] through aisles and things like that and
[38:06] then then at church but we're just we
[38:09] won't do hugging and shaking hands and
[38:11] things like that we're just going to
[38:13] come and
[38:14] create an an atmosphere that we could be
[38:17] lifted up in his presence and so we're
[38:19] setting that date and we pray that
[38:21] you'll be praying about that and
[38:24] the Lord would just have his way amen
[38:28] well if we could just stand for the
[38:31] reading of the word turn with me if you
[38:33] would to the book of Matthew chapter 25
[38:39] Matthew the book chapter 25
[38:44] maybe Anne could put on we got a little
[38:47] picture that we got from brother Marty
[38:49] today and
[38:51] he wasn't expecting us to do this but we
[38:54] want to put it up on the screen right
[38:55] now kind of give everybody a look at
[38:58] this picture he sent it and he said take
[39:01] a look at the road signs I don't know if
[39:03] you could see the Sun what you're
[39:05] looking at but on the left-hand side
[39:06] there's the road signs that say a
[39:09] one-way and then underneath it a yellow
[39:12] one that says dead-end and it's pointing
[39:15] to a graveyard and
[39:17] and the Bible says it's once unto man to
[39:24] die and then to judgment and the reason
[39:27] I wanted to do this is this ultimately
[39:29] this is where we all go unless unless
[39:34] we which are alive and remain unto the
[39:37] coming of the Lord we will have a
[39:39] rapture so there is another way to
[39:42] bypass death that's through a rapture
[39:44] Amen so turn with me Saint Matthew
[39:47] chapter 25 before we begin reading there
[39:50] let's just ask God to bless this word
[39:53] before we read it father God we thank
[39:56] you for the opportunity to be gathered
[39:58] together in your house
[40:00] Lord for there's a many many houses that
[40:05] we have are in right now and we've made
[40:09] you the king of that house we've made
[40:11] you the Lord of that house and we honor
[40:14] you in our homes and Lord we're inviting
[40:17] to you
[40:18] in to this service in their homes and I
[40:21] pray Lord that your revelation and the
[40:25] anointing of your word would be upon
[40:27] every life every heart that they could
[40:30] take this so personal Lord that
[40:33] everything that is transpired today
[40:35] would just be secondary
[40:37] lore we commit this into your hands and
[40:39] we trust you for the revelation of your
[40:42] word now for we ask it in Jesus Christ's
[40:44] name Amen
[40:45] amen starting with verse number one this
[40:48] is
[40:51] about the ten virgins then shall the
[40:53] Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten
[40:57] virgins which took their lamps and went
[40:59] forth to meet the bridegroom and five of
[41:03] them were wise and five were foolish
[41:05] they that were foolish took their lamps
[41:09] and took no oil with them but the wise
[41:12] took oil in their vessels with their
[41:14] lamps while the bridegroom tarried they
[41:18] all slumbered and slept and at midnight
[41:20] there was a cry made behold the
[41:23] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet UNO
[41:26] we know that's the message of the hour
[41:27] amen then all those virgins arose and
[41:30] trimmed their lamps and the foolish said
[41:33] unto the wise give us of your oil for
[41:37] our lamps are gone out but the wise
[41:41] answer is saying not so lest there be
[41:44] not enough for us and you but go ye
[41:49] rather to them that sell and buy for
[41:51] yourself and while they went to buy the
[41:54] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[41:58] went in into the marriage and a door was
[42:01] shut and afterwards came also the other
[42:06] virgins saying Lord Lord open to us and
[42:10] he answered and said verily I sang to
[42:14] you I know you not
[42:19] watch therefore for ye know not the day
[42:22] nor the hour when the Son of man cometh
[42:25] amen god bless you may be seated
[42:27] we want to continue in
[42:30] our little series being ready and
[42:35] in kind of entitled part 2 here fall
[42:39] atonement the full atonement we want to
[42:42] get into that we just kind of ended part
[42:45] 1 with a quote there and we're gonna
[42:47] touch base on that again but for our
[42:52] subject rejecting the atonement in its
[42:56] fullness
[42:57] rejecting the atonement in its fullness
[43:00] and we're taking those words rape from
[43:02] the message
[43:03] we always want to be in a state of being
[43:08] ready I think brother Mike's head what's
[43:10] at me and so that would be a good title
[43:13] for your the part one a state of being
[43:16] ready versus getting ready and
[43:20] it's such a good point and that's what
[43:22] our goal is to be in a state of being
[43:24] ready so we don't want to be looking at
[43:27] the rapture as a singular culminating
[43:31] event that lies somewhere ahead of us
[43:34] down the road remember what brother
[43:36] Branham said in God hiding himself in
[43:38] simplicity he says you know these things
[43:41] the time is at hand Church the time is
[43:43] at hand don't don't don't wait any
[43:45] longer how do you know the rapture is
[43:48] not going on all the time that's right
[43:50] so we're in that process so there there
[43:53] is a a readiness to get ready and in the
[43:56] message perseverant brother band said
[43:59] four months later after he that last
[44:02] quote I just read you he said let me
[44:05] repeat it
[44:07] they had the very elected
[44:10] describes in the Apostles called of the
[44:13] Lord were looking for the Messiah to
[44:16] come
[44:16] but Isaiah's to come to forerun is
[44:20] coming and he cometh and
[44:23] did it in such humility till they didn't
[44:27] even recognize him and I may and may I
[44:32] say this as my own thoughts
[44:36] one of these days you're looking for a
[44:40] lot to happen and
[44:42] that's happening
[44:44] and you don't know it
[44:46] you're gonna say before the rapture of
[44:49] the church so there are things happening
[44:53] right cuz the tendency that brother
[44:54] Brent says that man has is he's always
[44:57] looking at what God did in the passing
[45:00] and and seeing the marvel and and
[45:02] praising him for what he did the better
[45:04] he's also looking at the future of how
[45:06] great he's going to come and what he's
[45:07] gonna do and they don't catch they're
[45:11] missing what he's doing because they're
[45:14] not actively thinking that he is and I
[45:19] am God and he is preparing us right now
[45:23] for a rapture and we can say that with
[45:25] full assurance
[45:27] now all 10 believers
[45:30] in going to our pair of our opening
[45:33] Scripture now all 10 believers were
[45:35] excited about
[45:38] going to meet Jesus in the rapture
[45:40] because they all went they all went out
[45:42] right so they were excited they were
[45:45] believers now we do know at the end
[45:46] there there were half of them now he
[45:50] said I don't know you
[45:52] they their testimony as we know God
[45:56] but Jesus is testimony of them as I
[45:59] don't know you
[46:00] so in our relationship with God it's two
[46:04] ways it's our thoughts about God but
[46:06] then it's God's thoughts about us too so
[46:09] it's important so they were excited to
[46:12] meet Jesus in a rapture in other words
[46:14] they were not ashamed of the life they
[46:16] lived they were proud to be a believer
[46:19] and they took their lamps their hearts
[46:23] and went out to meet Jesus
[46:25] now half of the believers brother
[46:29] Branham said they were virgins they were
[46:31] clean living
[46:32] so they were proud in the life they live
[46:34] now half of the believers realize that
[46:37] if Jesus wasn't Lord of everything then
[46:39] he wasn't Lord at all and that the only
[46:42] way that they that he could be lord over
[46:45] them was by the indwelling of the Holy
[46:48] Spirit ruling in their life he had to
[46:50] take rule in their life 1st Corinthians
[46:54] chapter 12 verse 3 says we're I give you
[46:58] to understand that no man can say that
[47:02] jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost
[47:08] it's got to be the holy ghost or else
[47:11] there's there's just no revelation of it
[47:13] to see many will say Lord Lord right
[47:17] Manuel come to me and say Lord Lord and
[47:20] even here these
[47:22] five of these the foolish versions were
[47:24] saying Lord Lord open to us
[47:27] but but we can only really say Lord by
[47:32] the Holy Ghost that's why it's important
[47:34] it's the anointing of God speaking it
[47:36] and not just our carnal flesh with that
[47:39] knowledge
[47:40] now they understood half of these
[47:43] believers they understood the whys that
[47:46] the oil of the Holy Ghost was the only
[47:49] way that God could gain full more chip
[47:52] in their life that is the seal of the
[47:56] Holy Ghost residing in them which is the
[47:59] full atonement I want you to catch this
[48:02] this is the full atonement
[48:06] it's the Holy Ghost God Himself ruling
[48:10] in your light no justification is a
[48:13] portion of the Holy Ghost sanctification
[48:15] is a portion alloys but I'm talking
[48:17] about
[48:17] lordship now the full ruling going
[48:22] beyond sanctification here
[48:25] Matthew 25 or Matthew 24 verse 45 and we
[48:31] talked about this in part one I just
[48:34] kind of want to bring this together who
[48:35] then is a faithful and wise
[48:39] servant okay they're wise virgins now
[48:42] who then is a faithful wise servant whom
[48:46] his Lord have made ruler over his
[48:49] household do you see what made them wise
[48:52] virgin is they allowed the Lord Jesus
[48:54] Christ to take rulership in their lives
[48:57] amen and nothing short of that will make
[49:00] us a wise version amen praise the Lord
[49:03] now Jesus identified this half of the
[49:07] believers as wise because
[49:11] they took oil in their vessels with
[49:14] their lamps
[49:15] they took the Holy Ghost the full Holy
[49:20] Ghost with them and this oil was the
[49:25] proof that God had accepted their faith
[49:26] now remember brother Brennan makes this
[49:28] statement he says when you get baptized
[49:30] that you accepting Christ but when Jesus
[49:32] Christ fills you with the Holy Ghost
[49:34] that's not accepting your faith and the
[49:37] oil is the proof that God has accepted
[49:39] your faith because he said repent be
[49:41] baptized every one of you in the name of
[49:43] the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
[49:44] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[49:46] that promises unto you and to your
[49:49] children so we got to keep keep telling
[49:52] their children the Holy Ghost is for
[49:54] them even though they heard it and I
[49:56] don't mean you know
[49:57] drowning them out or you know get him
[50:00] discouraged away from you but look we're
[50:04] running out of time
[50:05] now the other half of the believers they
[50:10] took only a portion of the atonement
[50:13] that was provided
[50:17] very important they believe that Jesus
[50:21] died for their sins on the cross and
[50:23] they received that part of atonement
[50:27] they believed all all that was needed
[50:31] was to live a good sincere clean
[50:34] Christian life the best that they could
[50:38] in other words they had convinced
[50:42] themselves
[50:44] that they had enough of God
[50:48] to be ready for a rapture
[50:51] their lamps were burning
[50:55] amen they were burning they were burning
[50:58] with fire and
[50:59] no matter how many times the preacher
[51:02] would say we need to get more oil we
[51:05] need to get more Holy Spirit they
[51:07] personally felt that they had all that
[51:10] they needed to make it
[51:12] now remember the attitude of the Spirit
[51:15] in the end time was in need of nothing
[51:18] that was the the attitude
[51:21] in this age they had of God but they
[51:26] were blind to that part she Satan wants
[51:30] us to feel we have enough of God wants
[51:32] us to feel we got enough Holy Spirit
[51:34] because of what we know or what we've
[51:37] done or how long we've been
[51:39] but I'll just say like this press said
[51:43] to get more of God press said you're not
[51:46] gonna you're not gonna ever ever feel
[51:48] you made a mistake doing that
[51:50] now Jesus identified these virgin
[51:54] believers as foolish
[51:57] they were merchants they were claimed
[52:00] they live good lives but they were
[52:02] foolish because they took their sincere
[52:05] hearts and refused to take the oil that
[52:08] was required with them in other words
[52:10] they had rejected the atonement in its
[52:13] fullness right
[52:15] there it is I
[52:17] just want to soak in
[52:22] you can see why Saint would want them to
[52:24] think they got all they need
[52:27] Matthew 25 verse 8 the foolish said unto
[52:31] the wise give us of your oil for our
[52:36] lamps are gone out so at one time their
[52:40] lamp was burning they had enough oil in
[52:44] their lamp to burn it right but they
[52:48] didn't have enough
[52:52] it's a sobering thought
[52:55] it seems like the foolish are always
[52:58] demanding from the wise
[53:00] help
[53:03] isn't that funny
[53:06] they ought to have been living for
[53:08] others the foolish virgins
[53:12] they ought to be living for others and
[53:15] here they are they're caught at the end
[53:16] and they're asking the wise
[53:19] for something that only God can give
[53:24] they all have been living for others all
[53:26] along and giving of themselves but now
[53:29] they find themselves once again asking
[53:31] others instead of trusting God to supply
[53:34] what they need Oh
[53:39] praise the Lord you know in my mind
[53:42] brother mark I'm just I'm hearing all
[53:45] these amens you know before I'm going on
[53:47] to the next thing and not that you know
[53:50] I'm not saying everybody saying Amen but
[53:51] the word is real and and to me it's I
[53:56] don't say Amen to my own preaching but
[53:59] this word this is what this studies for
[54:03] is were really digging in to that fine
[54:06] line cuz we want to be ready in them now
[54:10] notice the wise said to the foolish in
[54:12] verse number 9 they said not so lest
[54:17] there be not enough for us and you now I
[54:21] just want you to think about that
[54:24] you do not have enough Holy Ghost inside
[54:28] of you
[54:30] to be
[54:32] giving half of it to somebody else
[54:39] we've got to encourage one another to
[54:41] get more of the Holy Ghost on their own
[54:44] I
[54:45] love their advice I love the advice of
[54:50] these wise virgins to the borderline
[54:54] believers they said but go ye rather to
[54:58] them that sell and buy it for yourself
[55:02] that's the only way you can get it they
[55:05] realized they knew that you couldn't
[55:07] make it in on knowledge and
[55:10] understanding in church attendance and
[55:12] tithe pay in you really had to go to the
[55:14] go get the Holy Ghost
[55:18] God promised to give the Holy Ghost if
[55:22] we seek him we'll find him
[55:26] knock and the door shall be open
[55:31] it's a promise if you've repented you've
[55:35] gotten baptized you shall receive the
[55:38] gift of the Holy Ghost well brother John
[55:40] I didn't I haven't received it yet what
[55:42] spend some more time repenting get
[55:44] zealous about repenting because that's
[55:47] what seems to turn the heart of God when
[55:50] you're more zealous to get more of God
[55:52] and less of yourself
[55:54] because he wants to give you give us all
[55:57] more holy ghost of what we want
[56:02] now in order to get the Holy Ghost you
[56:06] have to buy it
[56:07] that's what the wise virgins said you
[56:10] have to buy it
[56:11] and why didn't they already buy the oil
[56:17] before then why didn't the foolish
[56:19] virgin already buy the oil before then
[56:23] they had time
[56:24] because the price was too high
[56:27] think about it
[56:30] if gas or the grocery say a toilet paper
[56:34] was
[56:37] $500 a roll and
[56:40] it was going to be $500 a roll until
[56:44] Saturday and then it was going down to
[56:47] 50 cents a roll would you want to buy
[56:49] the toilet paper now no because it's too
[56:52] outrageous nobody's gonna spend that
[56:55] kind of money you're gonna wait
[56:58] so why didn't the foolish virgin go by
[57:02] the oil they didn't buy it because the
[57:06] price was too high
[57:09] they had to buy the oil with their life
[57:16] come by without money and without price
[57:20] they had to give themselves they had to
[57:24] give up their will and give it over to
[57:26] God in order to buy it
[57:31] remember our last service jesus said if
[57:34] any man will come after me let him deny
[57:37] himself or
[57:39] whoever will save his life shall lose it
[57:42] but whosoever will lose his life
[57:44] surrender his real for my sake the same
[57:47] shall save it
[57:50] it's giving of yourself and to a lot of
[57:53] people the price is too high
[57:57] it reminds me of the story of the pig
[57:59] and the chicken they were walking down
[58:00] the road together they were trying to
[58:02] work out the relationship and at one
[58:04] point the chicken he tried to take
[58:07] advantage of the pig and he said let's
[58:10] eat something I'll supply the eggs and
[58:12] you you supply the ham
[58:16] well the pig said
[58:20] that's nothing for you that's just a
[58:23] normal effort
[58:26] but for me it's gonna cost him
[58:29] everything I got and that's how a lot of
[58:33] Christians are
[58:35] they're more like a chicken who only
[58:38] wants to give the egg and God is calling
[58:40] for a full commitment
[58:42] amen jesus said all that time before me
[58:48] all that ever came before me were
[58:49] thieves and robbers they didn't want to
[58:52] give what was what was right what was
[58:55] what was a good exchange they they
[58:57] wanted to steal up rather than Jesus is
[59:00] that door and then he's the door and we
[59:02] got to come through that door we got to
[59:04] come his way amen now these borderline
[59:08] believers did not want to give up all
[59:11] their lives they were convinced that
[59:13] they had already given enough of their
[59:16] life to God in other words
[59:19] Calvary paid it off for me
[59:22] Jesus did it all and
[59:26] there was nothing more that they needed
[59:29] to give up
[59:31] they never receive the fullness of the
[59:35] Tollman these borderline believers they
[59:38] never did
[59:39] but they didn't realize that it was too
[59:42] late when they admitted that there were
[59:44] certain things in their life that was
[59:46] missing and those things are in there in
[59:48] Galatians 5:22 love joy peace
[59:52] longsuffering it's the fruit of the Holy
[59:54] Ghost so when those things are missing
[59:56] in our lives we need to realize we need
[59:59] more oil
[1:00:00] amen we need more oil and then the fruit
[1:00:03] of the oil comes amen
[1:00:06] our opening scripture here Matthew 25
[1:00:09] verse number 10
[1:00:11] and while they went to buy the
[1:00:13] bridegroom came
[1:00:16] and they
[1:00:18] that were ready went in with
[1:00:21] him to the marriage and the door was
[1:00:24] shut
[1:00:26] just like God shut the door on the ark
[1:00:28] God
[1:00:31] shutting the door of time
[1:00:35] when we can enter in for the rapture
[1:00:38] now why would any of us want to wait -
[1:00:41] that day - that very very last
[1:00:43] culminating day to really get serious
[1:00:46] and think about
[1:00:48] do I have enough of God
[1:00:53] now no Saints the political way of being
[1:00:57] a message believer in preaching as a - a
[1:01:00] message people is that we are all all
[1:01:05] saved we're all going into rapture and
[1:01:08] let's just look that's fine and dandy
[1:01:11] but we know that's not the truth
[1:01:16] and
[1:01:17] I am NOT trying to take or D
[1:01:22] Christianize or debride anybody
[1:01:25] but I'm also not wanting to give the
[1:01:29] devil anything to stand on
[1:01:32] to make people foolishly think that
[1:01:37] they're ready when they're not and
[1:01:40] so there's a balance here and we don't
[1:01:44] want to wait and
[1:01:45] afterwards verse 11 came also the other
[1:01:49] virgins and they're saying Lord Lord
[1:01:52] open to us they're still in this mindset
[1:01:58] they have a relationship with the Lord
[1:02:00] but he answered and said verily verily I
[1:02:03] say unto you I know you not so
[1:02:06] part of the atonement
[1:02:09] they took and they had a certain
[1:02:12] relationship with the Lord that the Lord
[1:02:14] knew them saw that he saw them because
[1:02:17] they were virgins they were believers
[1:02:21] but when it came to being bride - who's
[1:02:24] going to sit with him on the throne he
[1:02:27] did not feel comfortable having somebody
[1:02:30] by him who didn't want to give all their
[1:02:32] heart to him
[1:02:34] so he addresses them you know for this
[1:02:37] for the marriage suffer when it comes to
[1:02:39] the marriage supper now I
[1:02:41] don't know you
[1:02:44] when it comes to salvation yeah they're
[1:02:47] saved I
[1:02:50] mean if they if they followed I mean
[1:02:54] that's up to God under the great white
[1:02:57] throne judgment they're gonna sleep a
[1:02:59] thousand years and wake up to that but
[1:03:01] but part of the Thousand Year reign and
[1:03:04] being with the prize that's not going to
[1:03:05] happen
[1:03:07] and I or no one can tell you that you
[1:03:11] know all the foolish virgins are going
[1:03:13] to be saved or not to me the only
[1:03:17] the only guarantee is
[1:03:21] get the the Holy Ghost because God would
[1:03:25] have never promised it if it wasn't
[1:03:27] necessary so to just get it and then we
[1:03:30] don't have to worry about it and then
[1:03:34] watch therefore for ye know neither the
[1:03:38] day nor the hour when the son of man
[1:03:41] cometh so if I was to ask you today is
[1:03:42] the Lord coming tomorrow we would
[1:03:43] probably all say I don't think so I mean
[1:03:46] we don't got the krona voice virus is
[1:03:48] taken care of yet and we're not back to
[1:03:51] work or we're not back in the church and
[1:03:53] I haven't done this yet my life that I
[1:03:56] want to do we would feel that he's not
[1:03:58] coming tomorrow
[1:03:59] but that's the very spirit in which he's
[1:04:02] trying to tell us to be aware of that
[1:04:04] he's coming in our when you're not
[1:04:06] thinking that he's coming so that's a
[1:04:09] very dangerous thought to have I
[1:04:12] remember part one in part one when they
[1:04:17] asked brother Branham he said after the
[1:04:19] bride is raptured will any of the
[1:04:21] foolish virgins be saved or will they be
[1:04:25] lost I just want to say this after the
[1:04:28] bride is raptured the days of the
[1:04:31] Gentiles are finished
[1:04:36] so if they're finished how are any of
[1:04:38] them going to be saved so
[1:04:40] at that point if they were saved prior
[1:04:43] to those days then that's the way the
[1:04:45] tree falls they will be saved afterwards
[1:04:49] there will be no more Gentiles
[1:04:53] foolish or wise
[1:04:56] saved the days of the Gentiles are done
[1:04:59] foolish or wise as you know there's a
[1:05:01] there's attorney to the Jews no this is
[1:05:04] their time
[1:05:06] brother Ram said the foolish virgins
[1:05:08] will have to go through the tribulation
[1:05:11] period
[1:05:13] and the reason is because they rejected
[1:05:19] the atonement in its fullness
[1:05:23] she is a believer I professed believer
[1:05:26] but she will have to go through the
[1:05:29] tribulation period amen end a quote so
[1:05:33] she's a believer and God saying I don't
[1:05:37] know you're not well when it comes to
[1:05:38] being the bride there's a special
[1:05:40] relationship there that God is looking
[1:05:43] for it's no longer he
[1:05:46] paid for my sins at Calvary it goes
[1:05:49] deeper than that it's a walking
[1:05:52] relationship that he's he's continuing
[1:05:54] giving us information and given us his
[1:05:57] word and showing us things to come that
[1:06:00] he wants us to walk in
[1:06:02] now the foolish virgin is a believer a
[1:06:07] professed believer a
[1:06:09] borderline believer a
[1:06:11] borderline believer she believes up to
[1:06:14] the border it's a good way of saying it
[1:06:18] she believed to a point but rejected
[1:06:21] walking into the fullness of the promise
[1:06:24] and I want you to catch when I'm staying
[1:06:26] here she believed to a point but she
[1:06:28] rejected walking into the fullness of
[1:06:31] the promised land
[1:06:33] she came up to the promise and and she
[1:06:36] rejected walking over it it was too hard
[1:06:39] for them to believe in a nature change
[1:06:43] in a full nature change she just
[1:06:47] couldn't believe the Giants were too
[1:06:49] great in their life
[1:06:52] to reject the atonement in its fullness
[1:06:55] now this may shock you means to reject
[1:06:58] Calvary in his fullness
[1:07:00] but it is the truth
[1:07:02] and I'm going to tell you why Calvary
[1:07:05] was meant to take us far beyond
[1:07:07] salvation
[1:07:09] it was to take us beyond the coming out
[1:07:12] of the bondage of the world it was meant
[1:07:14] to take us over into the promised land
[1:07:16] of a nature changed that's what Calvary
[1:07:19] was for a
[1:07:22] complete nature change
[1:07:24] now the word atonement is
[1:07:27] mentioned only a few places in the New
[1:07:31] Testament believe it or not
[1:07:33] their first one is in Romans chapter 5
[1:07:36] verse 10
[1:07:38] his brother Brandon we got to get into
[1:07:40] this word now they rejected the
[1:07:42] atonement in its fullness
[1:07:44] for if when we were enemies we were
[1:07:48] reconciled to God by the death of his
[1:07:52] son much more being reconciled we shall
[1:07:56] be saved by his life and not only so but
[1:08:00] we also joy in God through our Lord
[1:08:03] Jesus Christ by whom we have now
[1:08:06] received
[1:08:08] the atonement the
[1:08:13] bride receives all the atonement
[1:08:19] praise God
[1:08:22] we're gonna get into what that means to
[1:08:25] Paul telling the Roman Church
[1:08:28] that we have now received the atonement
[1:08:31] but the foolish virgin rejected the
[1:08:35] torment in his fullness so the atonement
[1:08:39] for the bride is
[1:08:41] presented and she receives it
[1:08:45] the fullness of the Tollman is presented
[1:08:48] to the foolish virgin
[1:08:51] but she does she rejects it
[1:08:54] she says I really don't have to get real
[1:08:58] serious and gets so full the Holy Ghost
[1:09:00] I can still make it with how much I
[1:09:03] meant see I'm burning my lamps burning
[1:09:05] look I'm on fire them I'm excited I'm
[1:09:08] going to church and this has happened
[1:09:12] friend there's a time coming Jesus said
[1:09:14] work while you can because the night
[1:09:16] cometh when no man worketh we need a lot
[1:09:19] more oil than what we have right now and
[1:09:22] this is what this is for is for us to
[1:09:24] dig in and to seek God and to get more
[1:09:27] of the oil
[1:09:29] now what does the word atonement really
[1:09:32] mean
[1:09:33] this is what it means
[1:09:35] the Greek tells us it means to exchange
[1:09:41] exchange this fits right in we're the
[1:09:44] only way that you can get the oil is you
[1:09:47] exchange your will to get it
[1:09:50] is to exchange that is
[1:09:54] restoration to the divine favor
[1:09:59] so what God's calling the shots
[1:10:02] whatever he says it has to happen it
[1:10:07] means reconciliation
[1:10:11] atonement means reconciliation
[1:10:15] the atonement was ordained to take us
[1:10:18] all the way beyond just accepting Jesus
[1:10:21] Christ as our personal Savior to a
[1:10:23] divine nature change to a restoration of
[1:10:27] our soul he restoreth my soul amen now
[1:10:32] the rest of the atonement
[1:10:34] can be more easily identified in first
[1:10:38] Corinthians chapter 5 they use a
[1:10:41] different word but it's the same exact
[1:10:44] meaning in other words I think the word
[1:10:48] atonement you'll see it only two times
[1:10:50] in the New Testament but the exact same
[1:10:52] mean that comes from the Greek is
[1:10:54] actually mentioned a third time and
[1:10:56] you'll find it here in 1st Corinthians
[1:10:58] chapter 5 let's just start with verse 17
[1:11:04] therefore if any man be in Christ he is
[1:11:07] a new creature there's the the
[1:11:10] restoration there's there's been a
[1:11:12] change
[1:11:13] all things are passed away behold all
[1:11:17] things have become new see the exchange
[1:11:18] right there is the atonement
[1:11:21] look at this
[1:11:23] as an
[1:11:25] unconditional surrender to God's will
[1:11:28] the old nature's passed away the new
[1:11:30] nature is beginning to manifest and
[1:11:32] materialize and we're gonna try to get
[1:11:34] into that office that next next thing we
[1:11:37] get part three but but part four look at
[1:11:41] verse 18 now and all things are of God
[1:11:45] that's what the atonement takes you to
[1:11:47] it doesn't take you just a salvation oh
[1:11:49] he saved me I pretty much do what I want
[1:11:52] to do now
[1:11:53] but it takes you to where all things are
[1:11:56] of God now brothers sister I'll be the
[1:11:58] first to stand in line because if I'm to
[1:12:01] help us if I am to help us if I can say
[1:12:05] it like that into a rapture I need to
[1:12:08] have all things in my life be of God
[1:12:14] and all things are of God who have
[1:12:17] reconciled us now that word reconciled
[1:12:20] that means the same thing as atonement
[1:12:24] all things are of God who have
[1:12:28] atoned us
[1:12:31] to himself by Jesus Christ and
[1:12:35] have given to us the Ministry of
[1:12:39] reconciliation
[1:12:40] so first of all the foolish virgins
[1:12:44] rejected the ministry of being fully
[1:12:48] reconciled to God
[1:12:51] that's the first thing they did they
[1:12:53] rejected all things becoming of God they
[1:12:56] only took part of it just like the
[1:12:59] children of Israel when they came out of
[1:13:01] Egypt they took they wanted the
[1:13:03] salvation from the devil from Satan but
[1:13:06] they didn't take all the Tollman going
[1:13:08] to the promised land well so does this
[1:13:11] foolish version they accept Calvary they
[1:13:13] accept what Jesus died they accept this
[1:13:16] their sins being covered but they do not
[1:13:18] go on to receive all the toment and his
[1:13:22] fullness to where all things are of God
[1:13:24] in their life right they're very happy
[1:13:27] which is powerful
[1:13:28] it takes the Holy Ghost nothing short of
[1:13:32] it that's number one number two
[1:13:35] because they felt no need
[1:13:37] to go further with God themselves
[1:13:41] they didn't feel any greater burden for
[1:13:45] others
[1:13:46] so they never so they rejected the
[1:13:50] Ministry of reconciliation for others
[1:13:52] think about it if they themselves don't
[1:13:56] feel they need to really
[1:13:59] give their all to God why would they
[1:14:03] have a burden for somebody else to give
[1:14:06] their all to God
[1:14:08] so they first rejected the ministry for
[1:14:11] themselves to be totally
[1:14:13] reconciled to God all things are of God
[1:14:16] the atonement everything for them second
[1:14:19] they reject the Ministry of
[1:14:21] reconciliation of helping others get to
[1:14:24] that same place that God's calling us to
[1:14:26] I
[1:14:29] hope you can see it we need a greater
[1:14:32] burden than just
[1:14:36] we want everything to be of God amen
[1:14:41] verse 19 now to wit that God was in
[1:14:46] Christ and he was reconciling the world
[1:14:49] unto himself not imputing their
[1:14:51] trespasses unto them and has committed
[1:14:54] unto us the word of reconciliation
[1:14:56] so now we can't go dying across like
[1:14:59] Christ did but we're carrying the word
[1:15:01] of reconciliation and that is to give
[1:15:05] your life to Jesus Christ
[1:15:08] God committed the ministry on to them
[1:15:11] but they rejected the atonement in its
[1:15:14] fullness and now we are ambassadors for
[1:15:17] Christ as though God did beseech you by
[1:15:21] us we pray you in Christ's stead be
[1:15:24] reconciled to God now that's the
[1:15:27] Ministry of reconciliation we're all
[1:15:29] called to be missionaries
[1:15:30] to get reconciled to God and it goes
[1:15:35] beyond
[1:15:37] confess with your mouth believe with
[1:15:40] your hour Jesus died for you and get
[1:15:42] baptized it goes beyond that
[1:15:44] people need to get an expectation to
[1:15:47] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:51] it is something that
[1:15:53] people don't want talked a lot about you
[1:15:57] know they don't mind the anointing of
[1:15:58] God on them that makes them feel good
[1:16:01] but we're talking about power for
[1:16:05] service amen power to go out and to
[1:16:09] reconcile other people that is much
[1:16:12] harder because there is rejection
[1:16:14] there's persecution there's hurt there's
[1:16:16] pain but jesus told his disciples don't
[1:16:20] you go out there a witness without it
[1:16:21] don't be taking your tea parties and and
[1:16:24] and and just you know inviting somebody
[1:16:26] to - to a good time and in the church he
[1:16:31] says you stay there and you wait to you
[1:16:33] and do a power from on high because
[1:16:34] you're going to be persecuted you're
[1:16:36] gonna be stoned you're gonna be rejected
[1:16:38] people are gonna hate you and throw you
[1:16:39] out of their house you
[1:16:45] have the Holy Ghost
[1:16:47] you'll love them anyways
[1:16:50] you'll pray for your enemies
[1:16:54] you'll love them
[1:16:56] you have a bird for them and you'll keep
[1:16:59] going
[1:17:00] it's what the ministry is we're
[1:17:02] ambassadors
[1:17:03] we're ambassadors for Christ I just want
[1:17:07] to ask you today
[1:17:08] have we accepted that part of the
[1:17:11] totalement
[1:17:14] that's part of it don't reject it told
[1:17:18] me in his fullness the children of
[1:17:20] Israel rejected the atonement in its
[1:17:23] fullness Hebrews 3 tells us that the
[1:17:27] borderline believers did not enter the
[1:17:29] promised land because of what unbelief
[1:17:32] so what does that really mean
[1:17:34] unbelief because we believe the message
[1:17:38] we believe the Bible
[1:17:41] what they believed in Jehovah
[1:17:44] they saw the the anointing the pillar
[1:17:48] fire the cloud by day they saw miracles
[1:17:51] that rock followed then that was Christ
[1:17:53] the water they it was bitter and then it
[1:17:57] turned sweet and the manna came down and
[1:17:59] there was healing
[1:18:01] their shoes and we're out yes they had
[1:18:05] relationship with God they knew God to a
[1:18:08] point amen to a point
[1:18:11] so what does it mean that they didn't
[1:18:14] receive the fullness in the toilet what
[1:18:15] does it mean that they didn't enter in
[1:18:17] because of their unbelief
[1:18:19] the Bible says they hardened their
[1:18:23] hearts from walking in the full Tolman
[1:18:27] when the word is presented to us and we
[1:18:31] decide you know what I don't feel I
[1:18:33] should have to do that what is really
[1:18:35] happening there's a hardness that begins
[1:18:38] to work on your heart
[1:18:40] it's an unbelievable Eve is I don't
[1:18:43] think I have to do that unbelief they
[1:18:46] just wanted to be saved from the devil
[1:18:49] of the world which was feral at that
[1:18:51] time and that was it they said we'll
[1:18:53] serve God on this side they were happy
[1:18:55] to do that they were going to reject God
[1:18:58] they weren't saying I'm walking away
[1:19:00] from God and I'm gonna go out back into
[1:19:03] the world even though some of them
[1:19:05] talked about it you know I've been
[1:19:06] better if we were to stay back there at
[1:19:08] least meet our needs would be met we
[1:19:10] wouldn't have to have so much faith in
[1:19:11] God
[1:19:13] but in reality
[1:19:15] when they finally came up to it after 40
[1:19:18] years they just said you know what we'll
[1:19:20] serve God over here
[1:19:23] but they disbelieve to walk in further
[1:19:28] truth right so if the rapture is taking
[1:19:33] place right now and God has has a
[1:19:36] particular
[1:19:38] relationship with his bride that he
[1:19:40] doesn't have with the foolish virgins
[1:19:43] don't compare yourself with others
[1:19:46] if they don't want to go to church if
[1:19:48] they don't want to love their brother if
[1:19:50] they don't want to if they don't want to
[1:19:52] give their all if they don't want to
[1:19:54] reach out for souls
[1:19:56] if they're happy on this side of Jordan
[1:19:59] if they're just bubbling on this side
[1:20:02] hey let him be the thing is God is
[1:20:05] calling his bride to a particular
[1:20:08] special relationship that he wants to
[1:20:10] share his throne with and that's what we
[1:20:14] need to be focusing on because there's
[1:20:16] many voices out there that's trying to
[1:20:17] trap trying to get us lukewarm to lay
[1:20:20] back and not to worry everything's still
[1:20:23] gonna be ok because you still believe
[1:20:25] the message
[1:20:27] well I'm telling you they were all
[1:20:29] following the messenger of that hour
[1:20:31] which was Moses and and then then and
[1:20:33] and then Joshua you know they they did
[1:20:38] so we can't go by that Amen
[1:20:43] they thought all they had
[1:20:46] to do was still do what they have been
[1:20:51] doing just do what you have been doing
[1:20:54] you don't need anything else in other
[1:20:56] words
[1:20:57] they had all they needed Hebrews chapter
[1:20:59] 3 verse 10 makes it clear that they did
[1:21:02] not know the Lord's way and we had a
[1:21:05] service on that the difference between
[1:21:07] knowing his acts and knowing his ways
[1:21:09] and God testifies here that they did not
[1:21:12] know the Lord's ways in other words Paul
[1:21:15] said the Lord's ways are stated here in
[1:21:18] verse 14 the writer of the book of
[1:21:20] Hebrews
[1:21:23] we are made partakers of a rapture only
[1:21:28] if we hold our beginning confidence
[1:21:31] steadfast to the end now this is the
[1:21:33] Lord's way
[1:21:37] he that endureth to the end he that
[1:21:39] keeps walking in truth not he that just
[1:21:42] walks in so much truth and says that's
[1:21:43] good enough I can just you know what I'm
[1:21:46] just gonna hang it up and I'm gonna do
[1:21:48] do what I want to do now I got the main
[1:21:51] as I always loved how brother Marty
[1:21:53] would say he says an insurance policy
[1:21:58] dis insurance policy
[1:22:03] hebrews chapter 4 verse 1
[1:22:06] let us therefore
[1:22:09] fear fear for the rod brought that up in
[1:22:13] her
[1:22:14] or brother larry the men's mean it was
[1:22:18] brought up to fear let us therefore fear
[1:22:21] lest a promise being left us of entering
[1:22:25] into his rest any of you should seem to
[1:22:27] come short of it in other words we could
[1:22:29] miss part of the atonement right
[1:22:33] they missed the very promise they were
[1:22:36] just saying they thought the promise was
[1:22:38] that God was going their whole cry when
[1:22:41] they were were in Egypt was Lord deliver
[1:22:43] us from this taskmaster this evil of
[1:22:46] devil that's messing up my whole life
[1:22:49] deliver us and he said I've heard the
[1:22:51] cry of my people I've come down to
[1:22:53] deliver them but see God had more for
[1:22:57] them because he made a promise
[1:22:59] to Abraham four hundred years for 40
[1:23:03] years forty years earlier to give you a
[1:23:05] promised land that floweth with milk and
[1:23:07] honey
[1:23:12] but
[1:23:16] they
[1:23:18] came short of that promise
[1:23:21] so they came short of the full at Oak
[1:23:24] default token the full
[1:23:27] atonement
[1:23:30] so what they did is they came up to the
[1:23:33] border and they rejected the fullness of
[1:23:36] the atonement that's why we have to
[1:23:41] understand
[1:23:43] we have to go spy out the land I'm
[1:23:46] telling you we need to find out what
[1:23:48] this Holy Ghost really is it is a joy in
[1:23:51] the midst of terrible situations it's a
[1:23:55] it's a joy unspeakable it's a peace that
[1:23:58] passeth all understanding it's a love
[1:24:00] where you can love your enemies and we
[1:24:02] need to spy out the land to see that is
[1:24:04] the land that flows with milk and honey
[1:24:06] so when we come up to the border and the
[1:24:08] preacher tells us we need to get more of
[1:24:10] the Holy Ghost we don't want to make
[1:24:12] some excuse and just let that promise
[1:24:14] being left us we need to fear fear lest
[1:24:18] a promise being left us
[1:24:21] Hebrews chapter four verse number nine
[1:24:24] therefore there remaineth therefore a
[1:24:28] rest to the people of God
[1:24:33] Amen there's something for the bride
[1:24:35] there's something for the wise virgin
[1:24:37] that's not for the foolish think about
[1:24:39] that
[1:24:41] now I know in the in the world when we
[1:24:46] go to funerals and you know this
[1:24:51] in the majority of the churches
[1:24:55] they preach you into heaven no matter
[1:24:57] what life you lived
[1:24:59] and that same spirit can kind of
[1:25:02] culminate into the message
[1:25:04] to where we're just all bright because
[1:25:07] white because we're in the message
[1:25:09] when brother Branham he didn't just
[1:25:12] teach us there are three types of
[1:25:14] believers in the message he said there
[1:25:16] are three types of believers in every
[1:25:17] Church
[1:25:19] so we can't go by
[1:25:22] you know just collectively being a part
[1:25:25] of any one Church anywhere
[1:25:29] what we do need collectively
[1:25:32] is to endeavor to keep the right spirit
[1:25:36] right endeavor to keep the unity of the
[1:25:38] Spirit to be pressing towards these
[1:25:40] things that were ministry and that the
[1:25:42] fivefold ministry ministers to yes to
[1:25:45] believe for one another but you don't
[1:25:48] just automatically check their bride
[1:25:51] because if you do that how are you gonna
[1:25:54] help reconcile your brother
[1:25:57] how are you gonna disciple somebody if
[1:26:00] you're always thinking that they're a
[1:26:02] bride and while God or just have to show
[1:26:04] them
[1:26:04] well what's the use of even preach and
[1:26:07] if God's going to show us everything I
[1:26:08] mean were you going to take that too so
[1:26:10] we need one another we need two to help
[1:26:13] one a burden for one another and to
[1:26:16] believe that we got to do everything we
[1:26:17] can to help everyone get in not just
[1:26:19] those that are that are going to church
[1:26:22] those that are not going to church I
[1:26:25] tell you every one of you I'll tell you
[1:26:28] the bride of Jesus Christ you have
[1:26:30] brothers and sisters outside of this
[1:26:32] message they got to come in yet
[1:26:35] and we need to care about those just as
[1:26:38] much as we care about the ones that are
[1:26:39] in amen
[1:26:41] all right verse number 11
[1:26:45] let us know did we do 10 so sorry let's
[1:26:49] do 10 for he for he that it is entered
[1:26:53] into his rest he also have seized from
[1:26:56] his own word as God did from his I just
[1:27:00] on this little verse I want to share
[1:27:02] this with you the foolish virgin
[1:27:09] relied on themselves because they didn't
[1:27:13] need the Holy Ghost
[1:27:15] they relied on
[1:27:17] their that what they had was enough and
[1:27:21] yes they had some oil
[1:27:24] but if the oil had its way it would be
[1:27:28] telling them to get more oil so
[1:27:32] they relied on their works
[1:27:38] but to the bride they ceased from their
[1:27:42] works they're totally in rest with God
[1:27:46] it's God in them manifesting his life in
[1:27:49] every situation I
[1:27:52] love that verse 11 let us labor
[1:27:56] therefore to enter into the rest if
[1:27:59] we're a laborer for anything let's enter
[1:28:01] to enter into the rest lest any man fall
[1:28:05] after the same example of unbelief in
[1:28:10] other words I don't think I have to do
[1:28:13] what that preacher said I don't think I
[1:28:16] need to do that I'll still be fine if
[1:28:18] between me and God don't do that that
[1:28:21] scares me because you're not rejecting
[1:28:25] the preacher you're rejecting God who
[1:28:28] sent the preacher - yeah Amen we may not
[1:28:33] like
[1:28:34] how he Luxor or certain things but if
[1:28:39] he's bringing the Word of God that that
[1:28:41] should be precious to us Amen and to be
[1:28:43] on it to be honest with you God want you
[1:28:45] to honor the man amen amen praise the
[1:28:49] Lord
[1:28:51] alright well I don't have time
[1:28:57] to do as much as I wanted to do today
[1:28:59] but I want to reach you at least a
[1:29:02] little quote from brother Branham and
[1:29:07] then it kind of get us ready for
[1:29:11] perhaps our next service and I don't
[1:29:12] know if it's going to be this this
[1:29:14] Sunday if we're just going to try to
[1:29:15] keep these on on a on a Wednesday no
[1:29:18] remember next Wednesday's prayer meeting
[1:29:19] so we won't be having a worships on
[1:29:22] asking you I'm asking one of you in in
[1:29:26] your homes to get a tambourine some
[1:29:29] instrument and to make
[1:29:33] ready for a worship service to get ready
[1:29:35] for prayer amen for our prayer means
[1:29:37] their homes brother Branham said in the
[1:29:40] message questions and answers number one
[1:29:41] says please explain fully about the
[1:29:44] Gentiles that don't go on the rapture
[1:29:47] brother and says seed the Gentile bride
[1:29:49] is in heaven and the sleeping virgin the
[1:29:53] Gentile virgin is not to be saved during
[1:29:57] that time
[1:29:58] she's already been saved
[1:30:04] but has been rejected in the bride and
[1:30:09] she only goes through tribulation period
[1:30:12] for the time of purification
[1:30:15] because she has rejected Christ the word
[1:30:19] for her purification this is this is
[1:30:22] really rich and this is what we want to
[1:30:24] try to get into next time she's rejected
[1:30:27] Christ the word for her purification
[1:30:30] there was part of Christ that she was
[1:30:32] rejecting
[1:30:34] she accepted part of it but when accept
[1:30:37] the part where she had to purify herself
[1:30:41] then she has to suffer for her deeds
[1:30:46] but
[1:30:47] the bride who has become the word a
[1:30:52] complete atonement was made of Christ
[1:30:56] because he is the word the body was
[1:30:59] rendered and when the body was rendered
[1:31:01] the bride was in that body because it's
[1:31:04] the word
[1:31:05] so if I could say it like this
[1:31:09] the bride
[1:31:11] she suffers
[1:31:15] willingly
[1:31:18] before
[1:31:19] tribulation before the rapture
[1:31:23] the foolish version who didn't want to
[1:31:27] suffer to purify themselves
[1:31:29] God says you still have to go through it
[1:31:32] here oh you're not only going to go
[1:31:34] through it in tribulation but you lose
[1:31:37] out on being the bride so to two
[1:31:39] terrible things happen one is through
[1:31:41] free more agency the other is
[1:31:47] your you're going to be forced through
[1:31:49] tribulation to get purified one way or
[1:31:52] the other it's going to happen it's just
[1:31:54] it's required so you know there's a lot
[1:31:58] of people out there a lot of churches
[1:31:59] that
[1:32:01] believe that the bride goes through
[1:32:04] tribulation for purification
[1:32:08] they have to go through purification but
[1:32:11] not through tribulation Christ already
[1:32:13] paid the price form at Calvary when the
[1:32:15] bride was in there and when he rent her
[1:32:17] she came out but still she's living in a
[1:32:21] body of flesh that doesn't want to
[1:32:23] submit has to die out daily has to deny
[1:32:26] itself has to crucify has to
[1:32:27] unconditionally surrender as God points
[1:32:30] to her this is what you need to do to
[1:32:32] enter into the promised land you got to
[1:32:34] kill this giant you got to kill that
[1:32:35] giant you got to kill these things in
[1:32:37] your life and enter into more of the
[1:32:39] Holy Ghost
[1:32:40] hmm I want to encourage you today to
[1:32:45] press in to receive more of the Holy
[1:32:47] Ghost to receive the full the fullness
[1:32:50] of the atonement that God has for us
[1:32:53] it'll take us places that we can't go
[1:32:58] with what we have right now that's why
[1:33:01] we're in that process right now getting
[1:33:04] ready and we need more of His Holy
[1:33:06] Spirit as we spend that time seeking the
[1:33:08] Lord he will reveal himself in his will
[1:33:12] for to each of us individually what he
[1:33:14] wants us to do amen we are the bride and
[1:33:17] we're just here getting instructions as
[1:33:20] it were to get ready amen so we can be
[1:33:23] prepared prepared and we can honestly
[1:33:26] say we're ready Lord come Lord Jesus

[1:33:40] once again for
[1:33:43] your grace and your mercy in our lives
[1:33:46] for the mercy that rewrote our life that
[1:33:50] continues
[1:33:51] over and over making us a vessel of
[1:33:55] Honor
[1:33:57] Lord where would we be today without you
[1:34:00] we wouldn't be able to stand here we
[1:34:02] wouldn't be here holding on if it wasn't
[1:34:05] for you inside of us
[1:34:07] Lord this
[1:34:10] subject
[1:34:12] about being ready
[1:34:19] receiving
[1:34:21] the full atonement and
[1:34:24] being warned not to reject any part of
[1:34:27] it not to be foolish to reject all that
[1:34:31] you have for us lord I ask humbly would
[1:34:34] you reveal to us personally what it is
[1:34:37] that you have for us

[1:34:43] continue with all of our heart until we
[1:34:46] find you find that portion that you want
[1:34:49] us to have today
[1:34:50] to help us in the furtherance of this
[1:34:54] rapture Lord we thank you so much for
[1:34:58] the prophet that you sent
[1:35:01] the Lord he laid everything aside that
[1:35:04] he would give us the truth

[1:35:09] rock to stand on Lord we thank you for
[1:35:12] that
[1:35:15] Lord if I said anything to anybody's
[1:35:18] heart or mind that

[1:35:25] lacking in understanding

[1:35:31] would you give them revelation of your
[1:35:33] word give them revelation of the truth
[1:35:35] Lord may there be no
[1:35:38] confusion in the minds of your people
[1:35:41] may they see Lord that you are requiring
[1:35:46] a faux atonement for a rapture
[1:35:49] thank you for these things Lord we love
