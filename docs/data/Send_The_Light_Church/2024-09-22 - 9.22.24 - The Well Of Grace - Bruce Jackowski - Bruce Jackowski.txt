possible Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Jesus is here Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is here Jesus is here Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is here amen praise the Lord could you see brother Dennis God bless you amen amen just want to see if you're awake praise the Lord amen you turn me this morning to St John chapter 4 for opening scriptures amen St John chapter 4 starting with verse 1 when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John though Jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left Judea and departed again unto Galilee and he must needs go through Samaria then cometh he to a city of Samaria which is called sikar near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph and now Jacob's Well was there and Jesus there being wearied with his journey sat thus on the wall and it was about the sixth hour and there came a woman of Samaria to draw water amen let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we're so grateful Lord Jesus that you left us a testimony in this day Lord that we would not be stumbling about in darkness Lord as those that don't have a light they just stumble to and fro but Lord you have sent us a light you've sent us a great light Lord that we might see plainly where we should walk heavenly father I pray that you just come this morning pray that you bless brother John in the service that he's in Lord bless the Fellowship of the brothers there in Holland Lord I pray father that you'll just come Lord and not only bless him but may you come and bless us bless the hearers bless our hearts may you speak to us plainly Lord we love you we thank you Father for all things in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen you may be seated like to speak to you this morning about The Well of Grace amen amen yesterday when I was looking at this I I thought the wording of verse one was a little strange I don't know if you looked at verse one it says when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John I thought it was odd that that says the Lord who is Jesus I just I I puzzled at that so maybe one day the Lord will show me what that's all about but this morning it says here in verse six it says so Jacob's Well was there and Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour we know that the sixth hour is is the day you know six is kind of a time of of man's day and it's a time of of trouble and greyness and all kinds of things and Jesus was wearied he'd been following his disciples and and preach in many places and and now he got to the place the Bible says there it said that he had he must he had a need he had the Lord had showed him go to Samaria I want you to go to Samaria and when he went to Samaria he was wearied and he sat down by the well and it was about the six hour and there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water amen that's a very interesting scripture because Jesus told his disciples very plainly he said only go to the lost sheep of Israel don't go to the Gentiles don't go anywhere else and here's Jesus himself sitting down at the well with a mixed breed of people because we know the Samaritans were half Jews and and half Gentile and here's sitting there and this woman comes out who has no claim on Christ you notice she has no claim on him the sarapan woman when she came to him she said my daughter is Vex he said what do I have to do with you he said why should I give the children's bread to you you're not even you're not even part of the plan amen but her faith moved God Amen praise the Lord so it says here a woman this woman of Samaria she came to draw water brother Bram said so this woman she couldn't come out with the rest of the women you see because she was marked now in our country she's that's they're not even marked but there it is marked now I mean why even get married Donna was telling me the other day she was looking on the internet and she said oh she says the newest thing is Blended last names I said blended last name she says yeah well see the wife no longer needs to take the the husband's name because she don't want to lose her identity so now you have hyphen last names so Donna would be Donna whan Dash jakowski I remember asking a nurse about her hyphen last name one time when I was given blood don't do that she left that tourin on my arm really long and it hurt but I was I just wanted to know what she thought so my my eldest daughter she has a hyphenated last name and and I said why why would you do that she goes Dad she goes I have a professional identity and I don't want to lose that it's on all of my professional documents all the articles that I've written for for um textbooks and different things it all says Dr Rebecca jakowski and I said oh okay but now now we have we we don't even we don't have to hyph onite our names now Donna can be Donna wowski we can take the first couple of letters of her last name and take the last half of my last name and we can blend them together so the light has gotten murky but the scriptures has told us that the light would get murky and we found out that here this woman she was marked and so she couldn't associate with the other virgins the other women as long as she lived like that so she couldn't come when the rest of the virgins came so she come out about 11:00 amen so we know the six hour that that you know Sun up was the first hour and then about the 6 hour so you know you have to think about these things in biblical terms and in another message brother bam said does this woman come out from Samaria one time and she was discouraged she was sinful she had a lot of things hanging on her life perhaps and she was discouraged so she went to Jacob's Well for comfort for Relief and she would go there and she would get water and then she'd go home and you know if if you had to pack water lucky for us we just turn a faucet and water is there unless the well you know the whatever however you get your water if the the well pump has gone bad or the city water has gone bad or everything else but back in bi Biblical times they had to go to a well and they had to draw the water they had to dra draw the water for the day they had to draw the water for washing clothes they had to draw the water for cooking they had to draw the water for cleaning and everything else and they did that once a day so she was discouraged so she'd go to Jacob's Well for Relief and then she'd have to go back and then she'd have to go to Jacob's Well and then she'd have to go back one day day she sat the water pot down and there she was standing there discouraged and you know when you're discouraged the thing is is that you start thinking you Ponder all the things that you've done wrong in your life you start to thinking about oh I you know I made this I wish I hadn't done that and and oh I wish this I oh and and that's how you get discouraged but this was a strange day because this particular day the well was going to become a well of Grace it was going to become a well of Deliverance it was going to Jesus was sitting at the well and he was veiled God actually had come down and he was veiled in flesh and she didn't recognize that God she she was a Believer we know she was a Believer but she she didn't know that God could actually meet her at the well amen amen praise God amen let's go back here so we want to go back and look at the well The Well of Grace in Genesis 16 we find the first time that God ever comes down and Associates himself with a well in Genesis 16:1 it says now Sarah Abram's wife bear him no children and she had a handmaid and an Egyptian whose name was Hagar and Sarah said unto Abram behold now the Lord hath restrained me from bearing I pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that I may obtain children by her and Abram hearkened unto the wife to the voice of Sarah and Sarah Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian after Abram had dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife now we have a lot of bad opinions of Hagar and we know the scriptures talks about casting out the Bond woman and her seed and we know that the seed will not be air with the Shu and we we know all these things but this is a very interesting there there's a lot of things just in these three scriptures so we find out brother Brenham said this he said one day when Abraham was walking around at 75 years old and and that actually starts in Genesis 12 he was walking around at 75 years old and he had married his half Sister Sarah when she was just a girl in one place brother random said she was probably 18 years old when they got married so when Genesis 16 comes around you'll find out they had just had their 57th wedding anniversary they had been married for 57 years and God had spoke to to Abraham when he was 75 years old and said Abraham I have chosen you I want you to leave your family your Kindred all everything that you have and come and follow me follow me to a place where with if you follow me I will bless you I will bless you and I will bless everyone that blesses you and I will curse everyone that curses you come and follow me and it was up to Abram to follow God amen amen and she was 65 years old when God called Abram she was 10 years younger than Abraham and Abraham walking around God called Abraham by Grace by election but we know that from Genesis 12 to Genesis 16 that Abram he didn't he didn't follow God completely he followed him just enough to leave everybody well took lot to leave oh he took his daddy he was leaving and but he took some other people with him too and as time went on the Bible says that's what it says there in verse three it says it had been 10 years that Abram had been wandering around Canaan and in that 10 years the first thing that happened is Daddy died and then Abram was sorrowful for that you know but still he was following God and then he then he got in this problem with lot lot got you know the these the herdsmen there their their their business dealings got really mired and they found that they had to separate because God only called Abram he didn't call Abram to bring everybody else with him God called Abram brother Bram said by grace and by election and then he says but as soon as he had done what God told him to do which was separate himself from his kindreds and everything now you might say well wait but what about Sarah he said separate from your family why didn't he just leave Sarah behind he said because well he and Sarah were one you and your wife are one you see but now and Sarah was in the Covenant with him because she was his wife amen amen so we find out that God called Abraham he was just an ordinary man he he I just want you to know that you don't have to be somebody special for God to call you amen which makes us special because if God can call Abraham and do something with him God called us and can do something with us amen praise the Lord amen so we find out that Abram you know lot went and he got carried away by the three kings and Abram came down and he delivered him out of the hand of the Kings he took him back MDC came and met him and everything else this all between chapter 12 and chapter 16 but it had been 10 years it had been 10 years they were waiting for the promise for 10 years why can't God move faster than that isn't 10 years long enough what about 20 what about 40 but it had been 10 years and one day Sarah got up and she looked at Abraham and she said you know Abraham this isn't working out just the way we kind of thought it should be God she blamed God she God she says the Lord whom you believe in has has withheld me from bearing you seed and that bothered Abraham I I want you to notice here in in Genesis 15 God comes down and he meets Abraham and in Genesis 15:2 it says and Abram said Lord what will you give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this eleazer of Damascus and Abram said behold to me thou Hast given no seed you have not kept your promise to me you know so many times that's what we pray we pray we go oh you know Lord this is it's been too long and now you know my children no longer have any interest in God and and now my family is a bigger mess than it's ever been and and all these things don't seem to be working out you know and and we stand and say God aren't you going to keep your promise wow Abram said the same thing to him he said I don't have no children and he said you promised you promised you said I'd be the father of many nations and I I hear I'm childless and all I got is elaser from Damascus my servant he's the only Heir if I was happen to die if I was happen to die Sarah can't claim anything because this is biblical and she says so he says the heir the only Heir I have is theas is elzer and elzer is going to get everything amen praise the Lord so we find out here in verse in chapter 16 he says so when God called Abraham brother brandham says in Jehovah jar he says when God called Abraham he was just an ordinary man and I want you to know that you don't have to be any kind of a special person for God to call you God will call you by election and Abraham was elected amen praise the Lord he was 75 years old when God called him and he had married his Half Sister Sarah and they had been living together for years and she was Barren amen which is verse one of chapter 16 so she was Barren and she said to Abraham she said you know the Bible we know that 10 is is like tribulation or a time of testing and so Abraham well he had victories right he defeated the 12 Kings he had victories he had communion with MDC he had victories God had come down and met him called him he said I am your the alshad ey he says nurse strength for me he had done all these things all these things but yet this part of the promise bothered Abram and it bothered Sarah amen so we'll start here back at verse one he said chapter 16 so now you see this is there's more to it than just oh there's this Egyptian so Sarah Abraham's wife bear him no children and she had a handmaid an Egyptian whose name was Hagar and Sarai said unto Abram behold now the Lord hath restrained me from bearing I pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that I may obtain children by her and Abram hearkened unto the voice of Sarah and Sarah Abram's wife took Hagar her made the Egyptian after Abram had dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife and he went into Hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes so Hagar kind of looked at Sarah and said H what's wrong with you and verse five look notice what Sarah's reaction was and Sarah said unto Abraham I'm sorry I wish I had not done this I wish I wish I This was oh this was a bad decision she said you know we should have been more patient we should have waited on God we should have stayed with his what he told us to do but instead I'm sorry my sin be upon me I have given my maid unto thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived I was despised in her eyes and look what she says Let the lord judge between me and thee if I've done wrong let him take me out if you've done wrong then let him take us both out but let the lord judge between me and thee but God can't judge between Sarah and Abraham he can't do that but Abram said unto Sarah Behold thy maid is in thy hand do to her as it pleaseth thee you go ahead you know and when Sarah dealt hardly with her she fled from her face so Hagar was now in a position of you know she's carrying Abram's child but she's not part of the promise oh I I just hope you can see yourself in the scriptures everybody just comes they just read this stuff they don't see anything and I'm always puzzled I'm going don't you verse seven is a mystery here's a woman that has no claim on the Abram COV she has no claim on it and the angel of the Lord found her but he didn't just find her he found her by The Well of Grace by a fountain of water in the wilderness by The Fountain on the way to sh and he said Hagar Sarah's maid what why camest thou and where will you go and she said I will flee from the face of my mistress Sarah and the angel of the Lord said unto her just think about this person has no claim on the promise of God yet God sent an angel to talk to her and God spoke to her and said go back to thy to Sarah they return to thy mistress and sub commit thyself under her hands and the angel of the Lord said unto her I will multiply thy seed exceedingly and it shall not be numbered for multitude and the angel of the Lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shall bear a son and shall call his name ishmail because the Lord hath heard of the Lord hath heard thy Affliction you mean God actually could hear this from this woman that had no claim on the promise she had no claim on the promise yet God heard her and he said and he will be a wild man and his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all of his Brethren amen praise God Amen brother Brenham said he says so notice hey AR she had been put out of her home she had a little nursing boy ishmail and she went under into the desert no place to go let's yeah so she had gone out there and in verse 13 it says and she called the name of the of the Lord that spake unto her the god that seest me for he said have I all also here looked after him that seeth me you know the wherefore the well is called and I'm not really sure how to say that beer laai behold it is between cadesh and bed and what it really means is The Well of him that liveth and seeth me and Hagar bear Abram a son and Abram called his son's name which Hagar bear ishmail and Abram was 86 years old when Hagar bear ishal to Abraham praise the Lord amen Hagar she'd been put out of her home she had a little nursing boy ishmail she'd gone out in the desert with no place to go the water run out and what she could do she had been raised in a home that was acquainted with The Rock and what did she do she didn't want to see that baby die so she took him a little fellow and she laid him under a tree she went off about a bow shot and she fell down on her knees and she spoke to the Rock and The Rock put forth his Waters and the baby was survived and to this day this bear laori still stands there that fountain that The God Who hath seen me she spoke to the Rock BEC um for her dying baby Amen in Genesis 21 verse 13 one in verse 13 it says well let's let's um let's let's read verse 12 and God said unto Abraham let it not be Grievious in thy sight because of the lad that's because of ishmail or because of the Bond woman in all that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in Isaac shall thy seed be called and also of the son of the Bond woman will I make a nation because he is thy seed he couldn't let ishmail die because he was the Seed of Abraham amen amen and that that word that Hebrew word which we can't really s but we're going to say from here on out it's The Well of him that liveth and seeth me and that's unmar Grace the grace of God God didn't have to hear Hagar In fact the only reason God heard Hagar was because Abraham's seed was inside of her amen amen so brother Rams in Abraham's Covenant confirmed I really like this he says so now in the 17th chapter let's get this it says this is beautiful three times God made mention of the confirmation of the C Covenant first in Genesis 13:14 when he separated himself and obeyed then he told him he said I'll make you like the Sands of the sea and then in Genesis 15 he says I'll make you like the stars of heaven and then he waited till Genesis 17 he appeared to him after listen after this great trial wait a minute and I missed the trial I missed the trial what great trial he went and he fought MDC came and and gave him wine and and they they had Fellowship together where was the trial the trial was waiting on God to bring his word to pass he said he appeared to him after this great trial where Sarah had went off of the line and you know God would have slew Sarah oh here's a beautiful thing when he doubted when she doubted when Sarah doubted God God would have gotten rid of her but he couldn't do it because she's part of Abraham and that's the reason listen that's the reason when we do wrong God would slay us how many of us didn't pray right this week or read your Bible every day or listen to a tape or maybe you just forgot all about Wednesday night maybe you were just too busy to serve God God would slay us brother bham says I could never come here and preach a Revival no other preacher could you'd never have a Revival you'd be cut off forever but he can't do it praise the Lord he can do it praise the Lord amen he can't do it he cuts his own son off if he does see for the wife is a part of the husband they're no longer Twain they're one so he couldn't hurt Sarah without hurting Abraham so he had to take Sarah in and that's the way God does with us praise the Lord amen no matter how many times we stumble no matter how many times we fall no matter how many times we mess up we disbelieve we try to believe with the best ability that we can but we don't sometimes we just don't have faith you know sometimes people get up they try to beat you over the head and say oh well you don't have enough faith for a toothache and you say okay next time I have a toothache I'm not going to take any aspirin I'm going to muster up Faith and you can't you can't muster up Faith and God would destroy us but he can't because we're part of Abraham which is Jesus Christ we're part of him his seed dwells in in us and if it dwells in us it's going to Blossom one day amen praise the Lord amen you'd be cut off forever but he can't do it he cuts his own son off if he does see for the wife is a part of the husband they're no longer Twain they're one so he couldn't hurt Sarah without hurting Abraham so he had to take Sarah in and that's the way God does to us our sins he depart from us a long time ago but we're in Christ hallelujah praise the Lord amen I accepted his sacrifice not mine his amen I can't even give up my own will oh well I know you're afraid to admit that but you think of how many times we come up short but God isn't looking at us you know brother Brandon they're in too he was down there and and he saw he was in a um he went to the he said it was a Amish Restaurant and he went there and he said they had a slot machine in there and then they had a cop in there and then they had this woman there half-dressed with these and they were all drunk and and he said ah he says God he says why don't you wipe him off look Brothers God I can't believe this we we go oh look the gates are wrong the transit are wrong these are wrong they are wrong this is wrong and and oh God why don't you wipe them all off the face of the earth and the angel of the Lord came down and took brother brandom and said come on over here come on over here let me show you how sinful you are in God's sight but he said every time brother Brandon Billy brandham he said every time I made a mistake he said I saw the blood boss off of Jesus he he every time r wrote that song he says every time you sin amen we make mistakes all the time thankful for The Well of Grace amen that God has got there for usen amen praise the Lord amen makes us worship him even more appreciate him even more for what he's done for us he didn't have to do anything for Hagar Jesus an Egyptian but God took care of her because of Abram's seed God's taking care of you this morning because of Christ's seed praise the Lord amen amen no matter how many times you come discouraged amen there's a well of Grace that well out in the wilderness Hagar she you'd think you could hear a a bubbling well she she you know the angel of the Lord came down her and said it'll be all right and she said I bless this place the place where God is alive and he sees me amen amen and when Abraham had come through that big test and had this son amen who was not according to the promise he failed the test he failed it miserably nail that down brother Stan he failed it miserably miserably and you know God should have got rid of him but he didn't Hallelujah he didn't get rid of us and all of our failures and all of our mistakes he's not going to wipe us off the face of the Earth he saved us to take us home amen we just have to stay near the well praise God Amen Abraham had come through this big test and had this son of ishmail which was absolutely bad amen amen aren't you glad for that well amen let's take a look at another Well amen over in Genesis 24 we find out that elzer that God had a son named Isaac Abraham had a son he had Abraham had many sons he had three different wives and he had lots of sons and God had said thy seed I'll bless your seed but when you go and look at the scriptures Abram Abram one time was praying he says oh Lord he says oh that ishmail would stand before your face oh that he would just be pleasing to you and God looked at him and said no you're not getting this it isn't he that runneth or he that willth or he that praise the most he says it is God that showeth Mercy Isaac is who the promis is with and I have chosen I will make my word come to pass and you don't have a say in it only get will yourself to the Potter amen praise the Lord amen so we find out here in Genesis 24 that Abram got old and he called eleazer and he said Eliezer he says I need an uh I need a bride for my for my son the son of the promise and he needs to go and get uh don't don't go out here and get one of these but go and get a a bride for you know don't go to Canan don't go to all these unbelievers go and find somebody of our bloodline amen go and find somebody go and find go back to where we came from Brother you ever get a revelation of that you realize that this flesh has nothing to do with anything and that you came from God and you're going back to God Amen praise the Lord and then Genesis 24 and verse 10 so it says and the servant took 10 camels of the camels of his master and he departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and he went to Mesopotamia unto the city of nahor and he made his camels to kneel down without the City by a well of water at the time of the evening that is exactly the same setting as St John for it's the exact same setting Eleazar didn't go in the city he stayed outside the city if you go and you look in St John 4 it says now the Jacob's Well was there but it wasn't in the city it was outside the city and he said everyone had to come to that well to to get water amen and Jesus had a need to be there because the Unseen seed there was a seed in that woman that she didn't know about but she had a cry to know God the day that she got up that morning she she was on number six she was looking she was thinking you know you know how you are when you're young and you meet the first one and you say oh this this is the one and she probably thought this is the one and then he turned out to not be the one then she got another one and then she thought well this is the one and then he wasn't the one either and then after she had five and Jesus told her he said the one you got now ain't the right one either that's what he told her but she got up that morning you know and here the the apartment was a mess the dishes were all dirty and everything else and she's tired of life she's tired of everything but she's got a cry in her heart for God she's got a cry in her heart oh if I could just if I could just talk to him just like Hagar she said oh she said she was she was so she said why is everything against me and everything so hard and and all these things are wrong and now here and God sent an angel to that woman because the seed that she was carrying praise the Lord amen amen and that woman in in St John 4 she got up she was she was tired of it she was tired of her life she was tired of the Rat Race she was tired of of all the monotony of it and everything else and and she got her water pot and she goes down to the well The Well of Grace The Well of the god that liveth and seeth me amen amen the same place maybe not the same well but it's still a well of Grace it's the same well where elaser sat down outside the City and he had a prayer and he said oh he said Lord he said the god of Abraham not my God God of Abraham I know you're talking to Abraham and I'm just his servant he says here I'll set these 10 camels down and he says and I'll pray God the one that you have chosen not the one that I look on and I choose with my eyes the one you have chosen let her come out and when I asked her for a drink he said let her not only give water to me but also water for all the camels let her be willing to do that St John 4 is the exact same thing she come out of the city she was away from everybody else discouraged and a man sitting in the trees by the well said hey give me a drink and un likee that in St John go and look at it this really stuck out to me he said woman she goes wait a minute she says you know the well is very deep you know do you know how much problems we all have do you have any idea how discouraged we all are the well is very deep and he said don't look at all your circumstances don't look at all of that he says because if you knew who you were talking to because I am the Unseen God that seeth you and can give you the hand of Grace he said you'd be asking me for some water and she look in a while and says what kind of water is he talking about but he's talking about Deliverance real Deliverance praise the Lord amen so elas are sitting there and beautiful Rebecca brother Brenham says he says so beautiful Rebecca come out and he said now whoever Waters this camel Lord let that be the one you've chosen and Rebecca went and she watered the camels and she gave them a drink and then she watered his animals and look the very animals that she was watering see the animal represents a beast of course a beast of burden which means a power in the Bible and the Very animal that she was watering was the very animal that packed her to see her bride is that right and what is watering the very power that we've been watering now with praises Thanksgiving Glory power might is the very Holy Spirit that'll pack us up to see Jesus someday you come in and you go oh it's another boring song service why don't you sing those words I can believe them yes sing it like you believe it and maybe God will come down and do something something inside your heart amen amen it's true Amen brother renom said he said don't just read the Bible like a book just read it he says read your name in there yes find yourself in there amen praise God Amen it'll take us up to see Jesus someday oh my where are we at let's look here okay so verse 11 Genesis 24:1 it says and he made the camels to kneel down without the City by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women came out to draw water amen amen and he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham I pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master Abraham he would even worried about himself behold I stand Here by this well of water and the daughters of the men of the City come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy camels drink also let that same be she that has appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou has shown kindness and mercy unto my master and it came to pass before he had even done speaking that behold Rebecca came out and she was born to bethu son of milka the wife of nahor Abraham's brother with her pitch upon her shoulder amen praise God amen amen it was in the evening time when she come to the well near the city and it was about that time that Rebecca had to make a decision and I believe the angel of the Lord beat him there by about a half hour I like that before before God even before God even showed you where the church was before God even God had already started dealing with your life and putting things in places so that you'd have no other way to go but straight to Calvary praise God Amen people drink they're they go from bar to bar and drink and they go from relationship to relationship they try this they try that they try drugs they try all these things but God so pre-ordained that you had no other way to go but straight to him amen praise the Lord amen amen I love him I love him a lot I just hope I can serve him better amen we find out that you know Sarah when when eler came and Rebecca came and she watered the camels and then eliser said you know he says I know a guy he's a young man and he has wealth Untold he has riches Untold he has all kinds of things and in fact his father is even richer than him but he's going to be heir of all things and he says just to show you that he says I'm gonna give you just a little bit of gifts he gave her just a little bit just some things to encourage her they get her excited and she went in and she saw her dad and her mom and and they they got all excited about oh hey we're going to be rich she wasn't worried about that she said I'm going to get married I'm getting out of this small town I'm going somewhere else that's better than this amen praise the Lord so she went she came out she watered the camels and everything else and El eer started telling her all about it and they they brought elzer in let me see if I got yes verse 54 we're still in Genesis 24 praise the Lord amen and it says and now so elezar came and they they brought jewels of silver and jewels of gold and RAM and gave them to Rebecca you know remember brother Ryan sings that song What A Deal I gave him my old tattered garment he gave me a robe of pure white I gave him all my problems he gave me answers I had I was short on everything and he just made up for it not because of what I've done but because what he's done praise God Amen praise the Lord amen amen and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and ramt and gave gave them to Rebecca and she gave he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things and they did eat and drink and the men that were with them They Carried all night and they were up in the morning and he said send me away to my master see that's the problem we're in the night but we got to T here all night long but the morning cometh and the morning cometh Jesus Christ cometh so what is it to you if it tell a little bit longer was it it to you if it's 10 years don't get like Sarah say oh I I know I'm gonna hurry this thing up I'm gonna I'm gonna do whatever it takes to make sure that the promise comes and I'm in the Rapture right now you can't do anything about it Jesus said he didn't even know when he was coming back he says only my father knows but we need to Terry through the night God has chosen us for this hour not Luther's age not Wesley's age not you know not the Ephesian Church age not pergamus or thy he he chose us for this hour and we have to T through the night praise the Lord amen and finally he said send me away unto her my master and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days more don't don't get so fanatical stick around here for a little bit while no no no no I'm getting out of here I'm changing let the damsel abide here with us a few days at least 10 and after that she should go and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the Lord hath prospered my way send me away that I may go to my master and they said we will call the damsel and inquire at her mouth and they called Rebecca and they said unto her wilt thou go with this man and that's the question this morning what about it sister ly I'll go I'll go amen amen amen he says so I believe the angel of the Lord beat him there about a half hour he will send his angels before you he'll make the way clear and it must been the angel of God that spoke to Rebecca's heart and said go get the water Rebecca come out to the Water of Life at the evening time you get the picture it's the church in the last days the evening time the evening lights are here amen amen now I want you to notice I really want you to notice in Genesis 24 that's where we're at right so he said okay so we read 58 and they sent away away Rebecca their sister and her nurse and Abraham's servant and the men this is verse 60 and they blessed Rebecca and they said un her Thou Art our sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the Gate of those which hate thee see they're prophesying and they don't even know what they're saying that was God's promise they're prophesying and Rebecca arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took Rebecca and went his way and verse 62 and Isaac came from the way of the well the god that liveth and seeth me the same well that God LED Hagar to was the same well where Isaac came go look it up the only difference is it says beer and then it's the same word and the way the Hebrew is written is that there's there's a a prefix and it's a location and then there's the word itself and it's the same well God Isaac dwelt he came by that same well for he dwelt in the South Country and Isaac went out to meditate in the in the field when not in the morning but at the evening time and he lifted up his eyes and he saw and behold the camels were coming amen amen praise the Lord worship God with all your heart amen live for him with all your heart amen doesn't matter how discouraging it gets that woman from Samaria she got up she was discouraged she just kept coming to that well but one day the god that liveth and seeth me was sitting by the well and when he set forth his hand to her the Bible says she when she came he started talking to her and she said I want some of this water and he says I am he I'll give you some I'll give you water that'll flow up inside of you you know the nice thing about the New Birth the new the nice thing about the New Birth is it doesn't die it's alive and then when you get wore out it comes alive again and when you get discouraged it comes alive again and when things go wrong it comes alive again because it's The Well of him that liveth and seeth me you me The Well of Grace hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen I want you to look at chapter 25 I just want to read this verse 11 and it came to pass after the death of Abraham that God blessed his son Isaac and Isaac dwelt by the well Isaac stayed right there the same well The Well of the god that liveth and seeth me praise the Lord amen amen amen so let's go back here let's let's look at John 4 let's see what else is in there praise God you know see we're a lot like the Samaritan woman the cares of Life can really drag you down things can get to where it really bothers you but go to the well go to the well where there's a living God that seeth what your need is we don't even know how to pray that's what the Bible says we know not how to pray but the spirit that dwelleth in us he knows how to pray praise God amen amen all right verse 7 St John 4 it says and there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water and Jesus said unto her give me some something to drink just exactly like elezar and the woman at the at and Rebecca for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy meat you know when God speaks to you he's not going to speak to you because of your mom mom or your dad he's not going to speak to you because your father your lineage or anything he sent all the disciples away and when he speaks to you he's speaking to you he not speaking to anybody else he's speaking to you he sent all he sent all the disciples you know why he sent the disciples away because they were arguing about who's going to be better they always say you know I did more miracles than you did oh no I didn't well you know these over here we were going to call fire you know they're always fussing because flesh does that you get us all together and we just go to fussing and fighting after a while we will leave us alone for a while we'll get to go into fussing and fighting and everything else but they that dwell By the Waters they that dwell where the living water flows amen it'll be love joy peace longsuffering gentleness kindness it'll be the word of God living alive on us praise God amen amen hallelujah amen Jesus said unto her give me a drink his disciples were gone away into the city to buy meat he saith un the woman of Samaria under her or and then the woman of Samaria she says hm how is it that thou being a Jew ask us drink from me which am a woman of Samaria she says wait a minute because you Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans kind of like today we got our own little rigid ideas and that's who we stick with oh everybody else is wrong and then if you're over on this side everybody else is wrong and the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans but God crosses over all of that because he knows where his elected seat is praise the Lord you should Rejoice that God called you amen out of all this mess all this evening time darkness and everything else she says so then the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans and Jesus answered Senator if thou knewest the gift of God which is Grace the gift of God you weren't looking for God God was looking for you nice thing is he knew where I lived he knows where all of us live if you knew the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me a drink you'd as be asking me and he would have given thee living water and this woman said sir th has nothing to draw with and the well is deep I got a lot of baggage we got all kinds of bagage baggage when we come to Christ and the well is deep and we think God can't forgive us but he can forgive us of everything what will the

God Amen verse 29 it says and when she saw him she was trouble that is saying and cast in your mind what manner of salutation this should be you didn't know what the problem is with all of us we just

come to The Well of water amen amen I got one more can I do one more praise the Lord amen in Genesis uh 26 the Bible says this now there's a little discrepancy here so I'll just warn you right at the beginning so you go what yeah there's a little disc discrepancy Genesis 26 starting at Verse 18 and Isaac did died again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father amen for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham and you know that's all people are trying to do they're trying to stop up the well they're trying to tell you oh no brother bram's gone we can't do that anymore okay do this anymore and they just stop up the wells just say I believe might as well say Li out your tongue and put the ho Eucharist on it you got the message and now we're going home God is still true there's still a well of water amen they're still amen and they had stopped up these Wells when Abraham passed away and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them and Isaac servants diing in a valley and they found there a well of springing water and the Herdman of guer did strive with Isaac's herdsman saying the water's ours yeah yeah I remember the first time I heard that oh yeah I said a can't meeting I seen this preacher this preacher come and met me I talking to him he says you saved I said oh you know it he goes how old are you I said I don't know 26 or something he goes you born after 1963 and I said yeah and he goes well you ain't saved cuz in the seals book brother brandham said the the names are all done book is closed he's come off the throne tonight I said really kind of late that Well's been unstuffed in my house it's still living it's still flowing I'm you know the Philistines are still upon us they're tell doubters and oh all kinds of crazy things amen come to the well amen The Well of Grace be filled with the spirit amen your lamps trimmed in clear hallelujah amen oh yeah so they they they found this well the herdsman agreer said nope that water's ours so he told him he said well this is Strife the name of that well is called Strife because they strove in him so they dug another well and they they got mad at him again amen and he said he called the name of that sitna which means attack or malice and hatred that's what it means so first it's just Strife but then when it becomes manifest Strife is just you know an argument but it turns into malice turns into hatred and that causes death causes murder amen and he moved from then and died another well and and they and that one they strove not not and he called the name of that rabo and he said for now the Lord hath made room for all of us and we shall be fruitful in the land amen Amen brother bam in the Seal of antichrist he says you know Jacob want to dug a well and the Philistines run him away from it and I believe he called it malice and he dug another one they run him away from that and he called it Strife so he dug
