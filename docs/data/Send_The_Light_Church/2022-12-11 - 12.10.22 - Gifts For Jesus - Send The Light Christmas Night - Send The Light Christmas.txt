welcome to Christian Truth Academy the children are gathered in their classroom to listen to announcements from their teacher Miss Baker good morning students I hope you all had a wonderful weekend oh I have some exciting news for you it's time to prepare for our presentation called the Christmas gift to Jesus I would like you all to start thinking about what you can do for the presentation we are all valuable to Jesus and have unique gifts that are special to him can we sing a song of course that's a great idea hey George what are you gonna do you're new this year if you need any help let us know wow I have no idea I can't sing or memorize I don't have any talents maybe I can just help clean up looks like you're too late somebody already signed up for that time's up let's get our math books out oh laughs [Music] a new days beginning in the classroom are you gonna do anything drop it Alex you know I never do anything I wouldn't even be at this dumb school if I had a choice so go memorize your Bible verses and impress everyone with your giant know-it-all brain let's see you know Cooper never comes to anything I feel like he has the right idea I feel like I have nothing to offer either I'm sorry everyone but maybe God just didn't give me any special gifts after all I'm just not good at anything teacher reminds everyone about upcoming presentation and dismisses class for lunch yeah YouTube do you two plan on participating in the show next week absolutely not what about you George I want to but I can't think of anything to do I don't have any talents and I don't want to make a fool out of myself I see well George God has made you a unique person and gifted you with certain talents you aren't required to do something on stage but maybe you can help in another way thank you Miss Baker I'll keep thinking about it thank you Cooper returns with a lunchbox in a surprise to see George still in the room he goes to a chair and starts to eat George watches from afar do you have a staring problem or something no I was wondering why you're eating in here instead of the cafeteria with everyone else they're too nice to me in there it gets on my nerves too nice you wouldn't understand you're one of them one of them what are you a parrot I said you wouldn't understand I'm not like everyone else here I don't even believe in God after my mom got all religious she made me come to this place I understand more than you may think yeah right do you want to know why my parents homeschooled me for all these years um I was so full of anger until I was 12. I kept getting into fist fights and my parents had to keep me away from anyone I might hurt you're making this up do I know how I got this roasting marshmallows around the fire and saying Jesus Loves Me No I burned down my dad's chat after a fight now you're really making stuff up I'm sure look it up online I'm sure you can find the news article maybe even the police report your dad called the cops on you yeah he settles for my own good I spent two months in a Detention Center oh so that's what made you all religious no not even close so what was it those two months I was gone he rebuilt the shed all by himself he sent me a letter every day I was there I read them all on the way home then I realized how much my Dad loved me and how much God really loved me and how much he can forgive me for the awful things I have done so just like that you changed no not even close but when I asked so what was it but when so when I asked God to forgive me the change in my heart was instantly nice story bud I'm going to shoot some hopes Lord I remember the days before I knew you I remember feeling just like Cooper Lord I I pray that you was soft and Cooper's heart and show him that you're real Lord I pray that you'll use me to be a light in his life in Jesus name amen foreign [Music] is the name of the presentation of gifts for Jesus Joy to the World the Lord is come let Earth receive her King let every heart prepare him and heaven and nature sing and heaven and nature sing and Heaven in nature sing oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore him Christ the lord foreign next we have gifts for you all prepared by Jeanette Jasper and Mitchell and a few other children Brothers foreign we have one final presentation from George I wasn't sure what to do for tonight because I don't feel like I am good at anything I used to be really good at breaking the rules but then I realized that God had given me something else a change chart so I decided to share my testimony I used to think Christmas was all about vacation from school and getting cool stuff I was greedy selfish and very angry inside that all changed when I realized it was all about God himself coming down to our little world he paid for our sins and mistakes then he forgave us and changed us now Christmas has a brand new meeting it's a reminder of his patience and undeserved Grace Upon Our Lives I'm so thankful he gave me another chance I'd like to remind you all that if God can change someone like me and give me a new lease on life he can help anyone no one is beyond his reach and his care today I invite you to come walk with Jesus he will take your burdens your Brokenness and uncertainties it will truly be the greatest privilege you will ever know to happen by your side for the rest of your days [Applause] thank you for sharing that with us George we now look like the crowd to sing with us as we sing yes Cooper presentation all right I never really understood God or Christmas or being good until I listened to George tonight I was sitting there and I realized I want what he has a changed heart please forgive me for being rude and uncaring I I want to invite Jesus inside and have that life that George was talking about I now know that Jesus has been waiting for me tonight I want to give him my heart I invite the cash to come and sing with me what can I give him poor as I am if I were a Shepherd I would bring him a lamb If I Were A wise man I'd sure do my part so what can I give him I'll give him my heart give him my heart giving my heart what can I give him but all of my heart I'll give it my heart giving my heart what can I give him but all of my heart what can you give him what can you bring what can you offer that's fit for a king bow before Jesus that's where you can start so what do you give him just give him your heart and by other room to sing with us give him your heart give him your heart what can you give him but all of your heart give him your heart give him your heart what can you give him just give him your heart [Applause] more to come but uh since that song says just give him your heart if you rededicate yourself it'd be the best thing you've ever done in your life is give your heart to Jesus I promise you'll never regret it amen thank you guys
