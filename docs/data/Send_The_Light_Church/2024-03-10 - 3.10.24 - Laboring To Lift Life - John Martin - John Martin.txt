some Mighty Men of Valor and fought through 15 miles of War just to go get a drink for David yes that's a lot of Labor and I know you labored a lot to get here today but God answered our prayers and he got us here safe today and may the Lord Jesus just bless each of you for your your love to be in his house amen amen let's turn in our Bibles to St John Chapter 12 St John chapter 12 good to see uh brother uh Dennis here amen continue to pray for his heart as Brother Bruce had made mention we certainly appreciate Brother Bruce so much and his uh his great efforts and helping uh us get into the spirit for the word um and that is so vital it's so vital this morning we want to talk about uh lifting up the Lord in our lives of course and in titled this message laboring to lift life laboring to live life and uh we're going to be reading some familiar scriptures and I want us to I believe there's something in this message here for each and every one of us of course those that are live streaming today those that will be looking at the archives um but I when I look at my life no matter what anybody might say I feel that there's so much room to lift up the Lord in my life and this believe this messages is the Lord is in this this morning and uh I just want us to recognize the Lord let's look to him in prayer before we begin reading his scriptures our heavenly father we want to thank you for traveling mercies today Lord You've like that song Amazing Grace you brought us through many many dangers many toils many many situations Lord physically and spiritually Lord we're here to praise you we're here to give you thanks and Lord we're we're grateful that you put it in our heart to want to be here in your house and father we ask that you would come and bless your people oh Lord may your love and peace and your joy uh blossom in each heart here this morning father I pray that you touch all of our bodies that are perhaps fighting some sort of virus or something may you just come and touch our bodies touch those Lord that are sick you heard our prayers Lord for during the prayer request now Lord we pray that you come and unveil your word to us and draw us closer to you and help us Lord to see in ways that we have not seen before how we can lift you up Lord for you're worthy to be lifted up you're worthy to be praised we thank you for these things now we commit the service in our lives in your hands for your honor and Glory we ask in Jesus Christ name amen amen St John chap 12 we're going to start reading here with verse number 23 and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit but we know Jesus is talking about Calvary here that he died and that because of his death the Holy Ghost could come upon us and we could bring forth the same life that went into the ground amen amen he that loveth his life shall lose it he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal so we have to be willing to also die to our flesh in order to bring forth the same fruit of God Amen and if any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be any man serve me him will my father honor now is my soul troubled what shall I what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hour that's right father glorify thy name name then came there a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered and other said an angel spake to him and Jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sake I want you to think about that some thought I was a thunder some thought it was an angel and Jesus is saying they didn't hear and Jesus is saying this voice was for you now is the Judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me amen God bless you you may be seated there are many ways that we can lift up Christ am we can sing We can praise His name and we should do that that's right the Bible says that we should do it continuously amen amen we can tell somebody about Jesus that's a way to lift him up we can preach a sermon like we're a temp to do this morning and that lifts up Jesus am we can defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ with our words that this is what we stand for this is the doctorine I believe brother brandom said in the message The Works that I do bear witness of me he says do you know I'd rather have you live me a sermon than preach me one right it'll be a better evidence that you're a Christian isn't that right he says a lived sermon and what are uh and what we are is what we live and what we do our actions show what we are so there is many ways we can lift up Christ and brother random here is just saying that it is much better to live a sermon than to speak one which honestly if you're not talking basically all of you have a better chance of of uh e exalting Christ without speaking than I am at this very moment brother Bram said in the message Hebrews chapter 6 a man is known by his works and whatever your life is you've heard the old story your life speaks so loud I can't even hear your words so whatever you are you are the life that you live shows what kind of spirit is in you and then you may impersonate the wrong thing or impersonate the right thing may I say you may impersonate a Christian but there will by and by come a time when the strain will be put on and it'll show what you are yes a chain is as strong as its weakest link and when Christ the son of God was put to the test it showed what he was sure when you're put to the test it'll prove what you are your life always reflects what's on the inside of you didn't Jesus say come and buy of me gold that's been tried of the fire he was tried he was put to the test yes the hardest way to lift up Christ is with the way that we live our lives life can be very difficult to handle but it's through these difficult times that we can be a most effective witness for Jesus Christ I'm afraid that if some people couldn't talk they wouldn't be there wouldn't be enough evidence against them that they were Christians that they were Christlike because too many people do not think that their life matters and all that really matters are the things that they say but it's actually just the opposite it's just the opposite amen lifting up Christ in this age with our lives it's the hardest thing to do we're living in the most deceptive age the lid has been lifted off hell demonic forces are penetrating our society evil is on a rampage and evil is multiplying faster than ever before Galatians 1 says that Jesus Christ gave himself for our sin sins that he might Deliver Us from this present evil world yes and Timothy said in the last days evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived it may be easy to say things about Christ but takes a lot of Labor to lift Christ up with our lives have you noticed that even evil it just seems like it's being forced in your face they're just forcing it on you it's harder and harder to lift up Christ with our lives when evil is present all around us but Jesus said if I be lifted up from all all the evil that's in the earth I will draw all men unto me so if we can labor to keep the Life of Christ lifted up then others have a chance they have a chance to be drawn but if if we keep making excuses well I I I blew up because you said this and because you did that and that's why I did this well you know how is Christ going to be magnified in our lives how is how how are we going to better how is Christ going to to draw the other person times when people try to lift up Jesus it seems like they're drawing men unto themselves I I say we can say Amen to the word but because it's true you know you people when they lift up Christ they also just say like this they also want to lift themselves up and and really what Jesus is wanting is us to lift up Christ only not both not together the Pharisees and the Sadducees they were good examples of this even the disciples when they were arguing who is the greatest among them these people in the church look for an audience to esteem themselves instead of Christ Alone whether brandom said it like this you give a cow enough rope he'll hang himself you don't need to hang him you don't need to do it he'll hang himself Our Lives speak louder than we realize John 10 verse 24 then came the Jews round about Jesus and said unto him how long does thou make us to doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly just tell us plainly they were wanting to be told plain words and Jesus pointed them to the life that he was living amen verse 25 Jesus answered them he says I told you I already told you plainly and you believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me amen The Works that I do they bear witness of me it's why it's important to to really recognize the works of Christ in people's lives he just said' look at my life look how I where my my effort is being put my my toil my hard work am I lifting myself up or am I lifting up the father he said they bear witness of me in the message God is identified by his characteristics brother brandom identified these works here as his character are you with me now amen The Works of Christ is his character brother Brandon said in the message believe from the heart he says and any man is known his character is known by his Works no matter who he is his Works prove his character I if I didn't have this in my in my scriptures but if an if you could put these on the board Matthew CH 7 verse 15 Jesus said Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing and inwardly but inwardly they are raving wolves so here Jesus is pointing us to the inside character of a person and not to the outside what they're saying Amen to the inside amen and he says in verse 20 wherefore by their fruit you shall know them the fruit that comes from their life and then he goes on in the chapter to talk about not everybody that that says uh not everyone that says that they are of Christ if I could say it like that or that what they're doing is of Christ or what they uh what Christ told them it's not that clothing he said that everyone that does the will of God shall enter in well the will of God for each and every one of our Lives is to be filled with the Holy Ghost so full that we bear the fruit of the Holy Spirit amen you shall know them by their fruits and and and the description of the fruit of the Holy Ghost there's Galatians chapter 5 but the fruit of the spirit Galatians 5:22 but the fruit of the spirit is love he wants us to look at love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law well it's easy for me to love you when you're loving me but the minute you truly truly have something against me then it's going to then it shows how deep my love really is for you so these fruits are fruits that are seen in the middle of Trials and tests it's not something we we we show favoritism and well be kind and patient Meek to to my friend over here no we're we're talking about a fruit that is boring against our enemies it's true God Jesus is no respector persons God's no respector persons and they look at verse 24 and they that are Christ they have crucified the flesh with affections and the lust it's the only way you're going to get the fruit of the holy spirit is if you die out amen and if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain Glory provoking one another envying one another I mean this is a fruit of the Flesh and Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them yes it just doesn't matter what people say it matters the spirit that they're projecting amen and there's a fruit that comes from that character is a man's true nature brother bam said it's the only thing that we take with us when we leave and character is made in the fiery furnace of our trials that's right so if I could say it like this if it's the only thing that we take with us when we leave you you can't take more of Jesus Christ with you than what you have now in other words we can't just well when I get to the other side I'm gonna be like Jesus no character is not a gift it won't be gifted on the other side amen character is a victory when you go into a trial and you choose to crucify your flesh and you choose to yield yourself to the holy ho ghost to the word of God to do what that word says to do in the middle of the trial that character will be granted to you because you is it became a victory you overcame your flesh to get it now that is the only character that you're taking with you when you leave amen so if you if you don't want to work on building character then you're going to have little character to take with you when you leave so it's important that we get as much character as we can use our time to develop character don't don't don't use our time to build our own kingdom down here but to to get this carnal nature overcomed and get the victory amen that that only God can give us through the holy spirit amen amen now God's character transpires in our life of how we handle situations how we react to things how we overcome ourselves sometimes it takes her a tremendous amount of effort to handle situations with the right Spirit it really does so I got some questions you know I like to have a sermon with questions questioners do we labor to esteem others because it's a labor isn't it or do we labor to esteem ourselves do we labor to live for others or ourself do we labor to cover our brothers and sisters faults or do we expose their wrongs are we willing to labor to go the second mile or to turn the cheek do we labor or or Endeavor to keep the the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace or do we just boldo our way through with what we're trying to do do we labor to love our enemy because it takes a labor to do it brother Pam says whatever you do get perfect love get to the place where you can love your enemy that takes a labor to do that and I'm afraid that we just so often take the easy path the broad way and just do all talking instead of living the life we have to labor if we're going to lift up Christ how we handle situations how we react to things that they're proving our character they bear witness of who we really are and Jesus said if I be lifted up from this evil world around us I will draw all men unto me if I can be lifted up during your test and your trials then people will see Christ because people want to see Christ in that can handle the the test right he said come by of me go tried in the fire we need to go through the trials and people need to see Christ exhibiting from our life in the middle of the trial not after the trial and not just before the trial but right in the middle of it that's where I want people to see Christ in me because then I know that people are going to be more interested and more drawn to Jesus Christ at the company I work at we make parts that sometimes have to be tested and they call for materials to be certified traced back to the manufacturer sometimes we've done Parts out of these materials that have paracity in them they got holes in them and they have not met the requirements that's needed we also make test fixtures and assemblies and we take a bunch of parts they get put together they're welded together and then that they're tested to see if they can take the pressure they'll sometimes use air to put inside these fix these these parts that are on the fixtures and if they're not strong enough when the pressure happens they will blow air will escape and they don't pass the test because they have to pass the test they're going on your car they're going on your car they have to pass the test brother bam said in the message the action to an action a reaction to an action he says and when you when you're put under a test when you're fixing to be used for God for a testimony I love the way he said that when you're fixing to be used for God for a testimony like the lady here in the wheelchair the man the little boy some of you out there maybe you're a Christian and wonder why you're put under the test God's fixing to use your testimony and he wants to see how you're going to react he puts the pressure on you he wants to see how you're going to react so he puts a pressure on you he says if you blow up well then he can't do nothing with you if you blow up he can't do nothing with you in other words you don't pass the test you can't get put on the car you go on the scrap pile yes he can't use that for a testimony it don't matter how much you know the Bible it doesn't matter no matter how much you speak it's all about actions you got to prove it amen if you blow up Christ where's the witness of Christ in that he's not lifted up when you blow up when you blow up you know who's lifted up you are you're so lifted up that you're going to prove what are you going to prove you're right who cares who cares you being right does not draw me to Christ it doesn't amen I need a spirit of meekness the Bible tells me to be drawn to Christ he can't do nothing with you but if you hold on and just stay in the tassi that's the witness God wants us to be shows that Christ is alive in you the power of Christ is in you amen when we labor to lift up the Life of Christ during our times of pressure then God is fixing to use your testimony God can draw others to him because they see Christ in you during a time of pressure you've heard the story that uh when you get a bunch of tea bags and I I'd have to say in our home we have more different types of tea bags than probably all of our homes put together we have so many different types of tea bags and if you lay all those tea bags out and you you can't tell the difference of them there's they look all the same but you put it in hot water and you taste it you'll know which which is which when we're put under a test it proves what fruit we're going to Bear brother brandom said in possessing the enemy's gate he said and that's the way it is with all the seed of God the Seed of Abraham God gives us the final test just before he gives us the promise and that final test to see how we'll react upon it and when he gave Abraham this test he found Abraham just as true as he was when he started now just think about this we sit here and we read about how you know Abraham was going to kill his only be his only son and God stayed his hand and God used that as a testimony for your and I faith that that was a he's a father of our faith and he he was right under the pressure and nobody nobody told him he was this is what's going to when you go to church and this no he was right there under the test just like Moses God gave him the stick and said by you know by this this stick you you you're going and get pharaoh and he he walked in there and all of a sudden Pharaoh's magicians their sticks threw down and they became snakes snakes well he wasn't told all that but when he trusted God in that moment of pressure we read that as a testimony as I was with Moses so shall I be with you amen so when you're put under the test and you're able to to to manifest Christ that is a testimony that other people can see Jesus now because we're living in a world where you got evil people saying oh yeah I'm a Christian oh I'm a believer I'm born again and it's just getting so prevalent false prophets lot of them it's easy to see when somebody misbehaves or acts wrong it's easy to identify that that's not right sometimes we can be so quick to judge and be critical give her unwanted opinions and ideas about the situation but what's really lacking is the manifestation of Christ in that during those times that's what's really lacking someone that can stand up and be Christ in that moment amen maybe the reason that God allows things to happen to us is to show us where we're really at we're not quite with him like we want to be amen do we have the the character of Christ to handle the situation do we have the character to manifest the word we all know what to do but we we don't for some reason that that Christ just doesn't come out because we're so we don't mortify the Deeds of our flesh we don't crucify our flesh we don't bring it under subjection and we let the nature of God take over because it's the nature of of of our own nature car nature take over and therefore it doesn't become a testimony that God can use it becomes another stain it just does it our words are not matching Our Testimony are you with me now notice if a situation isn't handled correctly it usually turns out worse doesn't it so we need to give us off answer to turn away the Wrath we need to we need someone spiritual to do restoring not just somebody that knows what's right or wrong but somebody that knows how to handle the situation we need the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous believer to Avail the will of God we just can't you know get by with well they should know better and you know I'll just pray for them no we need the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man we need a person to walk in the spirit in order to not fulfill the lust of their flesh we need to have our conversation always with Grace coupled with fear that's the manifested word for the hour anybody can talk to talk sometimes I just feel like going like this you ever feel like doing that I I just I want to see it I've been told it so many times I just want to see it we need believers who are willing to labor to lift up it it why is it why is it so hard to just live the life when we're in the middle of a trial because it takes labor it takes an effort to subdue the Flesh and to bring it under subjection and to let let Christ be exalted there's no labor in talking there's doesn't take any effort it's cheap that's a good way of saying it words are cheap we need to labor to lift up the very Life of Christ in the middle of our trials to manifest that word this is what will subdue the enemy at that moment yes that's what will bring the situation to where it needs to be at that moment you notice how Jesus handled situations here Judas comes he chooses Judas Judas is with him all this time Judas goes to portray him he doesn't get all riled up he doesn't called out he didn't it what thou doest doest quickly the father was in control we got to understand who the head of the church is we got to understand the Holy Ghost is the head here we need to trust him if I be lifted up I'll draw a men unto me by this manifested love shall all disciples know shall shall all men know yet your my disciples if we just love when we want to love if we just love when it's easy for us to love people don't really see the love of God Amen Brother John I'll say Amen because because I believe that statement but when you can love your enemy when you can love when you don't feel like loving when you can love somebody that's done you harm It Is by that love manifested that other people will see that you're connected to God 1 John chapter 3:8 1 John CH 3:8 John says here he that commits sin is of the devil we can say Amen to that for the devil sin it from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil The Works of God destroy the works of the devil in my name they shall cast out devils brother bam says if you want to cast a devil out of your your your wife just love her give her some chocolates give her some flowers in other words be Christ to her you know love cast out more demons than we've got to manifest Christ Christ you can't put Christ in a box you can't put Christ in a box this is the way he's always going to react what matters is that he reacts and not that we react I say today we can destroy the works of the devil around us by manifesting Christ more in our lives we can be an effective Witness by yelding our life to Christ 1 Peter chapter 2 verse one but we got to continue to die out 1 Peter chapter 2 vers1 says wherefore laying aside all malice all Gile hypocrisies envies and all evil speaking wow I mean this has to be important to the believer you cannot skip this verse and then try to just talk about Jesus all the time you've got to lay these things aside look at as newborns as newborn babes Desiring the sin mirac of the world that ye may grow what into a new creature into the nature of God in into manifesting the word but you got to lay those things aside you got to be conscious I will not let my flesh I'm you've heard the old story I'm gonna bite my tongue I'm gonna bite my tongue hey if that's the only way you can start start with it but you've got to get to a place where that old nature cannot rise up and Christ has a chance to manifest perfect love in your situations a lot of times when something is wrong we go on the offense we become critical but I'll tell you what happens that that hurts our testimony we need to learn not to do that but to be patient and let God witness his life through Us 2 Corinthians chapter 6:3 2 Corinthians chapter 6:3 just talking about each of us having a Ministry now right giving no offense in anything no offense we're called to defend the gospel not beat somebody up because they don't believe it but to defend it giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed but in all things approving ourselves as the Ministers of God I'm going to I'm going to I we're going to talk about the fruit you shall know them by their fruits now in in much patience what do you need patience for H how many times have you said oh boy do I need patience with him or her or that situation my boss my it's in the trial that you say oh I need patience so you're approving your ministry in the trial Amen in much patience in afflictions in necessities and distresses in stripes imprisonments and turmoils and labors and watchings and fastings by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by Love unfeigned by the word of Truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by Honor and dishonor by evil report and good report by as deceivers and yet true in other words it doesn't matter what anybody says hold a good report as unknown and yet well-known as dying and beholding we live as chasten and not killed as sorrowful yet you're always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet you possess God because you possess all things when you possess him so this is where we approve ourselves as a real Christian with a real Ministry when there's in other words until there's a real need don't even bother don't even bother just keep it I I always like you know brother Johnson used to say don't let it all out the stack keep it down keep the energy down for when the trial comes that you can still live the life and you ALS used to say also don't don't uh don't jump any higher than you can walk so these things are just pointing us through that we need to live the life in the middle of our trials yes if the Bible says don't let the sun go down upon your wrath what are you doing letting it go down upon your WTH and calling yourself a Christian I I don't mean to be I'm not trying to be gospel hard here I'm just I'm just I'm just saying don't make Christianity what you want make it what what it is make it what it is stay with the word that's what that's what God wants to witness from our lives the brand said in the message hidden life with Christ he says you know the best thing is to live a sermon instead of preach one it is the best thing all right second Corinthians chapter 3 I hope it's okay we're going to end with a number of scriptures here because the scriptures is why we came here did we not amen 2 Corinthians chapter 3:1 Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves Do We Begin Again to talk about ourselves or need we as other Epistles of commendation to you or let of combination from you do we need some a letter that somebody sent to you saying how good you are or you going to send us a letter speaking about how good you are and then we're going to read that is that what we need we don't need a formal statement of praise for someone who has done something admirable we don't need that these are questions we don't need that Paul said you are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men yes your very life is an epistle that people read how you handle things how you handle things shows oh when I was in the world before I came to Christ I was just like everybody else that I knew we did what we wanted to do we partied we drank we we swore we we talked about who was better than the other person I mean you name it we did it I'm sure what you did I did for the most part but we were in the world but when we come to Christ Our Life Changes we become Our Lives become a new book and so when people look at us and and and they say well why why don't you want to go to the party with why don't you want to drink why don't you want to smoke why don't you want to have some of this I I don't have a desire for that anymore I just I I don't want that and and and they see a change happening you don't even got to go out there and preach it all you got to say is no thank you and all of a sudden they know it amen see your life becomes a written epistle and I'll tell you it's easier to me it's easier to live the life and somebody that you you hardly know than somebody that you've known for 30 years come on the longer you know somebody the more times that you've had to be in a trial with that person are you with me and and and really if you want to know how I'm doing go ask my wife there's some truth to that it's awful quiet in here our spouses see us under pressure more than anybody but next you you can go into your work of place and the people that you work with if you worked with them for many years then they've seen situations how you've handled situations you know I I'm okay with making tons of mistakes you you just got to have tons of I'm sorries that's all you make the wrongs right you move forward amen because when you make a mistake and you say I'm sorry that's a testimon Tony to what side you're on Amen it's a testimony that's that's Jesus said be zous and repent I'm just following but if you don't say sorry and you just keep going well your your your life is a different book all right verse three for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such have we through Christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also have made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the latter se but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life how many times you've been so mad that you quoted somebody a scripture to hurt them yeah yeah see the letter will do that but not the spirit the spirit of Christ will never do that it won't do that because God is the only one that's worthy to judge anybody that's not our job it's his job all right 2 Corinthians chapter 4 this is a good good second Corinthians here is good to see the manifestation of our our our our lives in the ministry that God has given us therefore seeing we have this ministry 2 Corinthians 4:1 we have a ministry that's not offensive it's not of ourselves it's it's Christ we have received Mercy as we have received Mercy we faint not but we have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation now of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God yes so you know what this is this just diffuses any kind of blowup you can't blow up and and and and and in another man's conscience they're going to have a good testimony about you can you say Amen to that this is this is not the if if you if if you it was just you guys here I'd have like a different different service this morning this is this is uh this this is for this is for us that know better and need to be trying [Laughter] harder but it's the word it's the word amen so if we want to have a be good in someone else's conscience we need to to to to manifest the truth right to manifest the truth because it's not just speaking the truth but speaking the truth in love right but if our gospel be hid it's hid to them that are lost a lot of people are lost in whom the God of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who's in the image of God should shine unto them amen for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for jesus' sake amen you know if if something is wrong make yourself a servant to that person make yourself a servant go help that situation amen for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to shine out Amen to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ so this light that's inside of us now we have to labor to get the flesh out of the way so we can lift up Christ amen but we have this treasure in earn vessels that the Excellency of the power it may be of God and not of ourselves we are troubled on every side we should be to all relate to these scriptures here for we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair we're persecuted but we're not forsaken we're cast down but we're not destroyed in other words things are happening trials are happening in our life but you know what we're always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our bodies for we which live are always delivered unto the death of jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus Jus might be made manifested in our mortal flesh in other words if a corn of wheat fall into the ground it it if it don't die it it abides alone but if it dies right there it dies to its nature its will then it'll Blossom up and we can become life to one another if I be lifted up I'll draw a man unto me but we've got to be willing to die out in order to lift up Jesus Christ it takes a labor a labor it's not easy it's not a gift I think there's too many too many people out there that that think that you know this living for Jesus is so easy it's it's a gift no get put under the trial and see how you react see if you follow the scriptures and then you'll really learn how hard it is to live 1 Timothy chapter 6 how we doing we we're doing we're doing like we normally do which means we got to hurry amen 1 Timothy chapter 6: 11 but thou oh man flee these things flee the the things of the flesh okay flee them and follow after righteousness godliness Faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life whereinto Thou Art also called and has look at professed a good profession before many witnesses that's that's the desire I have right there to have a good profession among many witnesses I give the charge in the sight of God who quith all things and before Jesus Christ who uh punches pilot witness a good confession think about it here was was Jesus and Jesus he didn't open his mouth he didn't just you know talk back and talk about how great he was and how bad pilot was no he witness he he he he was a good witness for Pontius Pilate a and so he had a good confession he said I find no fault in him that's what people need to see when we're in a trial when things are happening and you're acting like Christ don't just say well I'm right I'm right I know that I'm right as if that's a good witness a good witness doesn't go out of the the pages of this book that's what a good witness does well brother John I would never rob a bank like you did okay maybe you wouldn't rob a bank like I would or did but I really didn't I'm just saying I did but what about the way you're acting well I'm mad I'm upset what what about giving that to Jesus what about letting him be a witness in your life now I know this message hurts each and every one of us it hurts me just as much as it hurts you but you know you know this is not spoken because of you it's because Christ wants us to use use us for a testimony yes he wants to use us for a testim ony that things are going to happen in our church things are going to happen in our home things are going to happen in our work things are going to happen amongst us and we've got to be a good witness we got to we got to be such a good witness that God can use it for a testimony and sometimes your patience just your patience is all the testimony that God wants to use in that are you with me amen that thou keep this commandment so this commandment about fighting the good fight of faith and and keep a good con profession a good a good a good confession a good witness that thou keep this commandment look at this without spot unrebuked until when until the next trial until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ amen all right First Peter chapter 2: 19 now how many wish you would have just stayed home not came to church this morning no okay great we're on the right track then 1 Peter chapter 219 that was not meant to be a a serious question and I I know this is could be a little bit I think we need this to to for us to be a better witness I do I and I do believe with all my heart that God is in this message I I do with all my heart I believe as him one 100% second 1 Peter chapter 2: 19 just looking at this witness that that Jesus Christ was he's our example for this is thankworthy if a man for ience towards God he endures grief suffering wrongfully this is thankworthy in other words good job God looks upon you with a smile because you went through something you endured it without saying you're wrong and I'm right right amen amen for what glory is it when you're buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently what glory is it but if when you do well and you suffer for it you take it patiently this is the testimony that God can use this is acceptable with God God's fixing to use you as a testimony for even here onto were you you were called you were called to get this testimony your calling is to get this kind of testimony you were called out of sin to to get this testimony that Jesus Christ is alive because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps not just say oh yeah I see the example that Jesus did that's was a good example or I see the example that Jesus did I think you should do that but there's the example I need to do that amen that's what I'm called to I'm called to follow that example who did know sin neither guile found in his mouth you know sometimes we just say the wrong things we say things that we shouldn't say instead of covering somebody's sin we're bringing it out in the open that is not the example that Christ gave who when he was reviled he re vowed not again in other words he just closed his mouth when he suffered he didn't threaten he didn't say you just wait I'm not going to shake your hand I'm not going to talk to you I'm gonna give you the this that treatment no it just wasn't even in him there was no drama in Jesus Christ but he committed himself to him that judgeth righteously I I just love this at the same time this was all happening all this pressure was being put on Jesus they were pulling his beard putting the crown on his head they were they were mocking him he was up on the cross and they were taunting him well you know he saved others he can't save himself and if he's R of God then come off the cross and all this pressure was being put on him and he kept you and me you and I in his his mind for the joy that was set before me endured the cross who who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousness by whose Stripes ye are healed for you were as sheep going astray but now you return unto the shepherd and Bishop of your souls so now here this corn of wheat it goes into the ground and it dies at Calvary and now it comes back on the day of Pentecost licks of fire and it goes on everybody and they're filled with the Holy Ghost and they get baptized and all a sudden their nature starts changing and now it comes down to our age the last age before the coming of the Lord we've got to look exactly like the first wave sheath amen we've got to be in His image and it's not about head knowledge it's not about how much we know it's about what we're living in the middle of our trials we've got to see Jesus Christ manifested if we don't get that part we've got to get more of the Holy Ghost that's just all there is to it I don't want just enough Holy Ghost to condemn me I want to have enough Holy Ghost to get me through the trial and still representing Jesus Christ the Bible says because he laid down his life we ought to lay down our lives and the message be certain of God B says you know he loves to test us he loves to see the reaction of your faith amen did you know that God likes to see how you're going to react when you say oh Lord I believe you th my My Savior I believe that you're healer I believe you're the one who gives the Holy Ghost and the things that I'm requiring and you are the one that gives that and when you confess all your sins and promise God that you'll do it if he'll if he'll let you get well and then because you it don't happen you run off like a coward somewhere he said God can't use that he says there's no way for him to use that there's no way for him to answer you because he only Answers by faith then all of a sudden you go away and he can't answer but real true Faith stands there being sure that God is be certain that he is saying when we're in the middle of a trial and things are not the way they should be the need is really the same as if we were sick and we were wanting healing or we're wanting the holy ghost or we're wanting to be saved and that is we we're needing God to come in on the scene and meet the need amen it's the same so it requires faith when we're in Trials that's when you really shows what faith we have so say labor labor to die out to lift up Jesus when there's a trial don't stand up to the podium and say this is what I think you should do get over there get on your knees amen and start serving because that's what Christ did let them see Jesus Christ sometimes you just got to be patient be be patient and trust and love God will see us through I believe that all right we're going to do one more even though I have three more amen let's stand together in 1 Peter chapter 3:8 finally be ye all of One mind having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but on the contr blessing knowing that there unto there unto that I'm sorry knowing that ye are ye are you same as we heard in the last scripture are called that you should inherit a blessing so you can't get the blessing if you're just railing for railing evil for evil for he that will love life and see good days let him reframe his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no Gile let him excute evil and do good and let him seek peace and ensue it for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the Lord is against them that do contrary see who it is that will harm you if you be followers of them that are good when there's things that are going on somebody says something that's not right or something happens look you don't have to worry about anything that's going to harm you because you're a follower of that which is good there's a way to handle things in the scriptures that people can see yet that was Jesus Christ there's like no doubt that that was the Lord now of course I'm not saying everybody in the world's going to jump on your bang way because Jesus handled everything right and they still called him Bea they still call him a devil but I I'm saying those that are are Christians and and those have the right spirit and those that maybe don't have the wrong the the right Spirit at the moment have a wrong Spirit when they get the right Spirit they will see it they will they will I said that was my my last scripture and I'm sicking with that but I got one more quote it's real short brother B says what think think ye of Christ he said and I said now I won't argue because the scriptures are not to not to argue he said they are to be lived the scriptures are to be lived you live me a sermon that's the best thing I'd rather that you lived I'd rather see one live than I would to hear one preached wouldn't you live a sermon your written Epistles read of all men amen praise the Lord I so appreciate the instructions that God gives us in his word of how we ought to exalt the Lord Jesus and how we can exalt him it's really through those trials that really this sermon was for how we can exalt Christ in our trials let's sing that chorus that uh Brother Bruce had saying earlier be exalted be exalted we just we want God to be exalted in our lives amen I will give thanks to thee Oh Lord among the Nations I will sing praises to thee among the nation by steadfast Love is Great is great to the heaven and thy faithfulness Thy Faithfulness to the cloud be exalted oh God above the heaven let thy glory be over all all the [Music] Earth be exalted oh God above the heavens let the glory be over all
