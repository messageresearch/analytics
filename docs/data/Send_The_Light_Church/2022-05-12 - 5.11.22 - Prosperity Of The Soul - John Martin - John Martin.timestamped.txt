[35:19] uh today father we thank you for this we
[35:21] ask it all in jesus precious name amen
[35:25] amen turn with me to third john
[35:28] third john and we know third john only
[35:31] has one chapter
[35:34] so that'll be verses one through four
[35:37] we want to talk about prosperity
[35:40] today prosperity that's why i'm wearing
[35:43] my money tie
[35:45] because we want to talk about prosperity
[35:49] the elder unto the well-beloved gaius
[35:52] whom i love in the truth
[35:56] beloved i wish above all things that
[35:57] thou mayest prosper and be in health
[36:00] even as thy soul prospers
[36:02] for i rejoice greatly when the brethren
[36:05] came and testified to the truth that is
[36:08] in thee even as thou walkest in the
[36:11] truth i have no greater joy than to hear
[36:14] that my children walk in truth
[36:17] may god bless the reading of his word
[36:18] you may be seated
[36:22] any natural man
[36:24] would want to prosper
[36:29] most people end up trying to work hard
[36:31] enough
[36:32] for some kind of of retirement
[36:35] so they don't
[36:36] have to work but they can have enough
[36:38] prosperity to enjoy
[36:41] uh
[36:42] life at the end of their work career
[36:44] we've got some people that have retired
[36:46] do we not
[36:47] and
[36:48] i i would say that it wouldn't hurt
[36:51] those of us that are retired it wouldn't
[36:53] hurt our feelings if we had another
[36:55] couple hundred thousand
[36:58] we wouldn't we wouldn't complain about
[37:00] it that's for sure
[37:03] um
[37:04] but others don't wait till retirement to
[37:06] have extra things so they work harder in
[37:08] life
[37:09] they work smarter and they try to
[37:10] prosper and and some people
[37:13] prosper and honestly some do not
[37:16] few people work
[37:18] rentlessly in order to prosper
[37:21] and there are even some that will go to
[37:23] extremes to prosper
[37:25] they'll do wrong things they'll cheat
[37:27] they'll lie they'll steal the they'll do
[37:29] tax evasions
[37:31] there's a show on tv called the american
[37:33] greed has anybody ever heard about that
[37:35] or seen it
[37:37] and and that's what that's all about the
[37:40] people have tried to take advantage
[37:43] of people and the government
[37:45] just so they could prosper
[37:48] there are some scriptures in the bible
[37:50] that would call for a concern about
[37:52] financial prosperity
[37:54] does the lord want me to prosper
[37:58] is that a good question
[38:01] itself will be an awful quiet today
[38:04] first timothy let's look into it first
[38:06] timothy chapter 6 verse 8 says and
[38:08] having food and remnant
[38:11] let us
[38:13] be there with content
[38:17] but they that will be rich
[38:19] fall into temptation and a snare and too
[38:21] many foolish and hurtful us which drown
[38:24] men in destruction and perdition
[38:28] for the love of money is the root of all
[38:30] evil
[38:32] which while some
[38:34] coveted after
[38:36] they have erred
[38:37] from the faith we're talking about faith
[38:39] in our men's meeting one thing that uh
[38:42] hinders faith is is desiring
[38:45] of of of of riches
[38:48] and pierced themselves through with many
[38:51] sorrows so does god want me to be
[38:54] content
[38:55] or does he want me to prosper
[38:58] i mean personally i don't want to fall
[39:01] into temptation and a snare and into
[39:03] many foolish and hurtful lust
[39:05] i don't want to drown in destruction and
[39:08] perdition i don't want to covet after
[39:10] the prosperity of money i i don't want
[39:12] to pierce myself through with many
[39:13] sorrows i i don't want to be a part of
[39:15] that amen
[39:18] maybe i should just be content
[39:21] with food
[39:22] and remnant
[39:26] in luke chapter 18 verse 24
[39:30] jesus
[39:31] oh and when jesus saw the man
[39:34] was very sorrowful he said
[39:37] how hardly
[39:38] shall they that have riches
[39:41] enter into the kingdom of god
[39:44] so here jesus himself is just talking
[39:46] about the prosperity of riches and how
[39:50] hardly shall they that have him even
[39:52] enter in
[39:54] in james chapter 2 verse 5
[39:57] hearken my beloved brethren have not god
[40:01] chosen the poor the poor of the world
[40:04] yet rich in faith but he chose the poor
[40:08] of this world rich in faith
[40:11] and heirs of the kingdom of god which he
[40:13] had promised to them that love
[40:16] him
[40:17] so does god want me to be content
[40:20] or does he want me to prosper i need to
[40:22] get this thing straight
[40:25] first timothy chapter 6 verse 17
[40:29] charge them that are rich in this world
[40:34] that they be not high-minded nor trust
[40:38] in uncertain riches
[40:40] they have wings right they fly away
[40:43] but in the living god who giveth us
[40:46] richly all things to enjoy
[40:50] that they do good that they be rich in
[40:52] good works
[40:53] ready to distribute willing to
[40:55] communicate
[40:56] line up in store for themselves a good
[40:58] foundation against the time to come that
[41:00] they
[41:01] may lay hold on eternal life now of
[41:04] course all of us here we feel we've
[41:06] gotta we've got a hold of eternal life
[41:08] we've got it
[41:13] that's scary
[41:15] when the scripture is telling us that we
[41:16] need to be
[41:19] fighting the good fight of faith laying
[41:21] hold of eternal life
[41:24] i believe that god wants his children to
[41:27] prosper
[41:30] i believe that he wants us to be content
[41:34] with what he has provided us
[41:38] paul said i have learned in whatsoever
[41:39] state amen therewith to be content
[41:42] job said the lord giveth and the lord
[41:44] taketh away
[41:47] i believe the lord wants us to always be
[41:49] content and he always wants us to
[41:51] prosper
[41:53] well brother john how can we do that at
[41:56] the same time
[41:58] we can be content
[42:00] with what we have
[42:02] while we're prospering
[42:06] so with that being said
[42:08] should we be preaching or believing in a
[42:11] prosperity message
[42:17] prosperity can be a very
[42:19] deceptive
[42:21] subject
[42:23] many people have jumped on the bandwagon
[42:26] of the prosperity gospel
[42:28] some things i've just gotten off the
[42:30] internet if i could read these the
[42:31] prosperity gospel is an umbrella term
[42:35] for a group of ideas popular among
[42:38] charismatic preachers
[42:40] in the evangelistical tradition that
[42:43] equate christian faith with material and
[42:47] particularly financial success
[42:53] faith
[42:54] for the natural
[42:59] wikipedia just defines the prosperity
[43:02] gospel also known as the word of faith
[43:05] movement
[43:06] notice the word of faith well we want
[43:09] the word of faith
[43:14] where the believer is told to use god
[43:18] prosperity theology sees the holy spirit
[43:22] as a power to put to use for whatever
[43:26] the believer wills
[43:30] see how
[43:32] easy
[43:33] it can be deceptive
[43:36] in the 1980s tv evangelion was the
[43:39] promoter of prosperity teaching
[43:43] using terms like
[43:45] just send an offering in
[43:47] and we'll send you a free copy of
[43:48] today's message
[43:51] we'll be
[43:53] it just
[43:55] we'll pray
[43:56] and you could for sure
[43:58] you'll be prospering
[44:01] all sorts of stuff like that was
[44:02] happening
[44:04] and in the 1990s and
[44:06] 2000s it was adopted by influential
[44:10] leaders in the pentecostal movement and
[44:12] charismatic movement in the united
[44:13] states and has spread throughout the
[44:15] world now this is what the wikipedia
[44:18] says not me
[44:19] prominent leaders in the development
[44:21] prosperity theology include
[44:25] e.w kenyon oral roberts a a allen roger
[44:29] robert tilton
[44:31] t.l osborne joe olsteen
[44:34] kofi dollar kenneth copeland reverend
[44:37] eich and kenneth hagin
[44:41] by the way joel olsteen's net worth is
[44:44] estimated
[44:45] at 50 million dollars
[44:50] he knows about the prosperity
[44:56] gospel
[45:01] the preachers associated with the
[45:03] movement have some of the largest
[45:05] congregations
[45:07] and best-selling books in the country
[45:09] and they have host uh television
[45:12] programs
[45:13] that seem
[45:14] to air at all hours all of the night and
[45:18] are some of the most watched programs
[45:20] around the world
[45:22] the prosperity gospel goes by many names
[45:26] word of faith
[45:30] health and wealth name it and claim it
[45:35] this different gospel teaches that god
[45:37] provides rewards including
[45:40] personal happiness financial wealth and
[45:43] physical health for believers who have
[45:46] sufficient faith
[45:51] the preachers of this gospel may quote
[45:54] the word but they twist it to support
[45:57] their false theology by taking passages
[46:01] out of context
[46:06] can you see how deceptive
[46:08] prosperity can be viewed
[46:13] for me for what i believe
[46:15] i would never ever advise seeking to be
[46:18] rich
[46:21] i would never ever advise seeking to
[46:23] prosper without it being the will of god
[46:28] the reason i would never advise seeking
[46:30] to be rich is because i don't believe
[46:33] it's wisdom from above
[46:36] i just don't think that's what god would
[46:39] inspire me to ask for
[46:43] a good example of that would be solomon
[46:46] when the lord appeared to solomon in a
[46:48] dream by night and god said ask what i
[46:51] will give thee imagine that god came to
[46:54] you and said ask what i will give thee
[46:58] that sounds scriptural the bible says
[46:59] ask
[47:01] and you and it shall be given
[47:04] solomon could ask for a lot of things he
[47:06] was a young man
[47:07] as young men you got a lot of ideas
[47:12] but his only concern was how he could do
[47:15] his job better for the kingdom of god
[47:18] and i love that
[47:19] he wanted to do his best for god that
[47:21] there was nothing else on his mind
[47:24] now think about that we all got a lot of
[47:26] stuff going on in our life
[47:28] a lot of things
[47:30] i got a lot of things if i got a lot of
[47:32] things you got a lot of things
[47:35] and you got about to put all that aside
[47:39] and focus on one
[47:42] what is that one thing
[47:44] that you want of god
[47:48] first kings chapter 3 verse 10.
[47:53] and the speech pleased the lord and
[47:55] solom uh that solomon had asked this
[47:58] thing
[48:03] and you know the thing that he he asked
[48:05] that he might
[48:07] be able to do his best job for god just
[48:09] the wisdom of what
[48:12] oh of what was needed to help the people
[48:14] because there were so many people you
[48:16] know we could just say there's so many
[48:17] things going on in our life what is that
[48:19] one thing
[48:20] and god said unto him because thou has
[48:23] asked this thing
[48:25] and has not asked
[48:27] for thyself
[48:28] long life
[48:30] neither has asked riches for thyself
[48:35] nor has asked the life of thine enemy
[48:39] but has asked
[48:40] thyself understanding to discern
[48:43] judgment
[48:45] god had given
[48:47] solomon the job of ruling righteously
[48:51] and whatever god has given you to do for
[48:53] the kingdom that needs to be your focus
[48:56] because we're not going to be here long
[48:58] rich or poor
[48:59] amen
[49:00] behold i have done according to thy
[49:03] words
[49:05] lo i have given thee a wise and
[49:07] understanding heart so that there was
[49:09] none like thee before neither shall
[49:12] there be any uh arise like unto thee and
[49:16] i have given unto thee that which thou
[49:18] has not asked
[49:20] i love that
[49:22] both riches and honor so that there
[49:24] shall not be any among the kings like
[49:27] unto thee all the thy days
[49:30] and if thou i this is important for all
[49:32] of us a good lesson here and if thou
[49:34] will walk in my ways to keep my statutes
[49:37] and my commandments as thy father did
[49:39] walk then i will lengthen thy days
[49:45] notice the wisdom from god
[49:49] i would never advise anyone to seek
[49:52] riches
[49:56] the brandon said the message i was not
[49:58] disobedient to the heavenly vision he
[50:00] said not long ago in california some of
[50:03] the armenian people who had all sold out
[50:06] their winery and things
[50:08] sent me a check
[50:10] that amounted to more than a million
[50:12] dollars now that seems like maybe not
[50:14] much now but it was a lot in 1949
[50:18] and i wouldn't even put my hands upon it
[50:22] i sent it back
[50:24] i'd rather be poor and living in a shack
[50:26] and have favor with god
[50:28] and the feeling that i
[50:30] had i had the satisfaction i love him
[50:33] than all the wealth
[50:35] in the world that the world owns
[50:39] now here is here's the messenger here's
[50:41] a minister that he could give a lot of
[50:44] it uh all of it to missions or
[50:47] you know he could do a lot with this
[50:48] money
[50:50] but notice the attitude that he had
[50:54] in the message faith
[50:56] in the son of god brother bryan says
[50:57] brother sister i had a million and five
[50:59] hundred thou five hundred thousand
[51:02] i'm one million five hundred thousand
[51:04] dollars given to me at one time and
[51:06] refused to put my name on it and told
[51:08] them to take it back that's right and in
[51:10] a message believe us though this brother
[51:11] branham said there was two fbi agents
[51:13] that brought it
[51:15] and he refused to even
[51:18] look at it he said fbi agents brought it
[51:20] to me and i refuse to even look at it
[51:26] i wonder if we got any solomon's here
[51:32] brother branham says i i had twenty five
[51:34] thousand 000 given to me
[51:37] 25 000 given to me in one check
[51:41] at the platform in texas where a man
[51:44] from
[51:45] the texas oil owner there
[51:48] that come up his mother was healed out
[51:50] of the wheelchair they just flew in
[51:52] there and i said sir and i tore the
[51:54] check up right in front of him that's
[51:56] right
[51:58] someone offered me here not long ago i
[52:00] said brother branham
[52:02] uh would you buy uh we'll buy you a nice
[52:05] cadillac to ride
[52:06] i said no indeedy i will never do that
[52:10] i want you to notice the attitude
[52:13] that the prophet has
[52:17] there was a time that
[52:18] brother branham was telling the story
[52:22] about the squirrels coming into
[52:23] existence
[52:25] and hattie wright was there
[52:29] and she wasn't
[52:31] very wealthy she just lived in an old
[52:33] place that had holes in the walls and
[52:35] everything else
[52:37] but she believed
[52:40] the prophet she believed god's prophet
[52:43] and when brother branham told that story
[52:45] she said that is nothing but the truth
[52:48] as if she was there
[52:50] but she wasn't there she just believed
[52:52] it
[52:53] and we can believe it amen the same way
[52:57] and something happened where the spirit
[52:59] of god came on brother branham and said
[53:01] you ask what you will whatever you want
[53:04] god will give it to you
[53:08] and she looked over
[53:10] she
[53:11] she needed money for a lot of different
[53:13] things
[53:15] i mean she lived in a poor house and we
[53:17] did
[53:19] and then sister gabriel brother jonathan
[53:21] says well i'm not even living in a
[53:22] household
[53:25] she was poor very poor
[53:30] but she
[53:31] was interested in the salvation of her
[53:34] two boys
[53:38] it was it was
[53:40] about the soul of her two boys
[53:44] not they grow up with great educations
[53:48] but the salvation
[53:51] as soon as she spoke at that very time
[53:54] the spirit of god of conviction came
[53:56] upon those two boys and they came to her
[53:59] mom and just gave their heart to jesus
[54:01] christ at that moment
[54:04] amen amen
[54:07] i would never advise seeking to prosper
[54:09] without it being the will of god
[54:12] so how do i know it's the will of god
[54:16] the scripture teaches us here in 3rd
[54:18] john chapter 2 beloved i wish above all
[54:20] things that thou mayest prosper and be
[54:23] in health
[54:24] even as thy soul prospers
[54:28] i want to entitle this the prosperity of
[54:30] a soul
[54:31] it seems like what
[54:33] most preachers forget about when they're
[54:35] preaching the prosperity gospel is they
[54:38] leave out the soul part they leave out
[54:40] the prosperity of the soul
[54:43] here in the book of john we discover
[54:44] what god's priority of prosperity is and
[54:47] what ours should be the prosperity of
[54:49] our soul needs to be first
[54:53] too many people have lost focus on what
[54:55] they should be laboring for to prosper
[54:58] we need to be uh
[55:00] we need to be interested in a soul
[55:03] prosperity movement
[55:06] not just a a prosperity gospel but a
[55:09] soul prosperity gospel
[55:14] now i know that's not as interesting to
[55:16] the flesh
[55:19] but it's pleasing to the lord amen
[55:23] our emphasis needs to be on the
[55:25] spiritual and not the natural
[55:29] i think the devils conform so many
[55:31] believers into thinking that well my
[55:34] soul is good enough i'm in good enough
[55:36] shape here now let's just focus on the
[55:38] natural things
[55:42] in other words there's no focus on
[55:44] spiritual prosperity
[55:47] so when i think about prosperity it's
[55:49] real simple if i have a hundred dollars
[55:52] in the bank next week i got 200. that
[55:54] the week after that i've got 300 and
[55:56] there's a prosperity going
[56:00] or if you're you're
[56:02] you're sick
[56:04] and week one goes by and you're feeling
[56:06] better my health is prospering though
[56:09] next week goes by you're you're doing
[56:11] better your your your your health is
[56:14] increasing it's prospering so what about
[56:17] our souls
[56:18] what is the prosperity of our souls is
[56:20] it coming to church and just saying i
[56:22] made it to church and did my part heard
[56:24] more truth
[56:29] luke chapter 12 verse 16.
[56:33] i want to kind of provoke us a little
[56:35] bit amen
[56:37] luke 12 16 and he spake a parabon to
[56:40] them saying the ground of a certain rich
[56:42] man brought forth plenty plentiful
[56:46] and fully
[56:48] and he fought now notice what happened
[56:51] he thought within himself
[56:53] saying
[56:54] what shall i do because i have no room
[56:57] where to bestow my fruits
[56:59] and he said this will i do
[57:02] i will pull down my barns
[57:04] and build greater
[57:07] and there and there will i bestow all my
[57:10] fruits and my goods and i will say to
[57:13] what
[57:14] my soul
[57:18] think about it
[57:21] when you're
[57:23] when you're putting your emphasis on the
[57:25] natural
[57:30] your soul is getting put in the back
[57:33] burner
[57:35] and i will say to my soul soul
[57:37] thou has much goods laid up for many
[57:40] years
[57:41] take thine ease
[57:43] eat drink and be merry
[57:46] i'm okay with my soul it's i'm saved i
[57:49] got saved um ten years ago
[57:56] what about the prosperity of that soul
[57:57] that got saved
[58:04] but god said unto him thou flew this
[58:07] night thy soul shall be required of thee
[58:09] then whose shall those things be
[58:12] which thou has provided
[58:15] so is he that laith up treasures for
[58:17] himself and is not rich toward
[58:19] god
[58:22] god's looking at our attitude let's look
[58:24] at laodicea the prosperity revelations 3
[58:28] verse 17 because thou sayest i am rich
[58:31] and what nothing
[58:33] and knoweth not that thou wretched and
[58:34] miserable poor and blind and naked how
[58:36] many has felt miserable
[58:42] i'll tell you the devil has a way of
[58:43] getting us down doesn't he
[58:45] but i think you know god has some good
[58:47] counsel for us god's counsel for the
[58:50] church is to buy of me gold tried in the
[58:53] fire
[58:54] well that's the very life of christ
[58:58] and that's what makes us rich
[59:02] is christ not just
[59:05] i i know i'm saved and now i just focus
[59:08] on the natural part of my life
[59:11] the lukewarm believer today
[59:14] is going to get
[59:16] spit
[59:17] out of god's mouth
[59:21] and god is is standing at the door of
[59:23] every man's heart
[59:25] wanting to come in and prosper the soul
[59:30] to bring prosperity to the soul not is
[59:34] not satisfied with just getting saved
[59:36] that is not where god is at
[59:39] amen
[59:42] he's interested in prosperity yes
[59:45] our souls need to prosper amen
[59:47] not survive but thrive yes and prosper
[59:50] amen
[59:52] our soul is really who we are
[59:56] these bodies are going to leave
[1:00:00] and
[1:00:00] we
[1:00:01] our soul we
[1:00:03] the real we need to prosper amen
[1:00:06] and our pr our souls prosper
[1:00:09] when we walk
[1:00:10] in the truth that has been given to us
[1:00:14] and the truth that he presents to us
[1:00:17] when you walk in truth that is when your
[1:00:20] soul will prosper
[1:00:25] now here's the thing in order to get
[1:00:26] excited about that you've got to get
[1:00:28] excited spiritually
[1:00:31] because it's not going to help naturally
[1:00:34] amen
[1:00:36] this is the thing that
[1:00:38] this this spirit
[1:00:39] was wrong to begin with trying to to
[1:00:42] bring in
[1:00:44] the
[1:00:44] faith just so we're going to be blessed
[1:00:47] naturally
[1:00:51] now i want you to think about this
[1:00:52] statement
[1:00:55] everyone that has died in every believer
[1:00:57] that has died and gone on to be with the
[1:00:59] lord
[1:01:00] the majority of them at one time were
[1:01:04] healed of god
[1:01:06] can you say amen to that that god had
[1:01:08] healed them while they were here on
[1:01:10] earth we could say that that that god
[1:01:13] prospered their health and healed them
[1:01:16] but they ended up dying
[1:01:19] you understand what i'm saying
[1:01:21] but when your soul is prospered now that
[1:01:23] don't go backwards that's storing up for
[1:01:25] the other side
[1:01:28] and we we forget about that we put the
[1:01:30] emphasis on what we need here
[1:01:39] god just wants to be first
[1:01:44] to seek him first
[1:01:46] and it's it's really hard
[1:01:49] to do that the way that we should be
[1:01:52] doing that
[1:01:53] right because we feel we're doing that
[1:01:56] when we come to church
[1:01:59] but there's so much more to that what
[1:02:01] was the truth that you heard last month
[1:02:04] right in the church here right
[1:02:07] and can you say of a surety yes it's
[1:02:09] been hurting my flesh but i've been
[1:02:11] walking in it
[1:02:14] right
[1:02:15] or you say i made it to the church there
[1:02:16] were some good services and
[1:02:20] so eyes are so prospering
[1:02:23] i enjoyed the services they were but
[1:02:25] it's their soul prospering
[1:02:30] brother branham said in the message who
[1:02:32] is god
[1:02:35] talking about our soul he says how
[1:02:37] do you ever
[1:02:39] get here how did you ever get here on
[1:02:41] earth anyhow
[1:02:42] how's that germ of life ever formed
[1:02:45] notice
[1:02:46] it's by the creator god so i want to
[1:02:50] i just want to
[1:02:52] go into our soul just a little bit if i
[1:02:55] could
[1:02:56] brother branham said in the message
[1:02:58] believe us thou this he says and friends
[1:03:00] we know that the germ of life comes from
[1:03:02] the male sex
[1:03:04] you are your mother's flesh but you are
[1:03:07] your father's blood
[1:03:08] life comes from the male sex
[1:03:11] so
[1:03:12] to understand where god's where we want
[1:03:14] to go with this that god is our husband
[1:03:17] the church is his wife
[1:03:19] so the germ of life to the church comes
[1:03:21] from god amen
[1:03:24] brother adam talked about the seed of
[1:03:26] god that that was placed inside of each
[1:03:28] and every one of us from the very
[1:03:30] beginning
[1:03:32] now we didn't know it
[1:03:34] until it began
[1:03:35] to germatize
[1:03:38] right
[1:03:39] it isn't he all sudden put the the seed
[1:03:41] there
[1:03:42] the seed was always there
[1:03:44] it just wasn't germinated we didn't
[1:03:46] notice it brother brandon said in his
[1:03:49] life story he said that's
[1:03:51] uh that's
[1:03:52] is like a corn of wheat that fell into
[1:03:54] the ground there it lies a germ of
[1:03:58] immortal life that's what's living
[1:04:00] inside of us
[1:04:03] jesus said in john
[1:04:06] 12 24
[1:04:08] verily verily i say unto you except a
[1:04:10] corner wheat fall into the ground and
[1:04:12] die it abideth alone but if it die it
[1:04:14] bringeth forth much fruit
[1:04:18] so then he says this amazing statement
[1:04:20] next verse
[1:04:22] he that loveth his life shall lose it
[1:04:24] but he that hateth his life
[1:04:26] in this world
[1:04:28] shall keep it unto life eternal
[1:04:31] it's got to be more than a statement
[1:04:34] right
[1:04:35] so here a corn or wheat it's got to die
[1:04:39] or it's never going to bring forth
[1:04:42] so even though the seed of god was
[1:04:44] inside of us
[1:04:47] when we were in the world
[1:04:50] it couldn't come forth
[1:04:54] it couldn't come forth or else it would
[1:04:55] have
[1:04:57] why
[1:04:58] because the holy ghost hadn't germinated
[1:05:01] yet
[1:05:02] and that was the calling no man can come
[1:05:05] except the father calls
[1:05:08] so many are called but few are chosen
[1:05:12] those that have
[1:05:14] that seed inside gonna recognize
[1:05:17] i'm going somewhere here with this
[1:05:22] there had to be a dying out in our flesh
[1:05:24] in order to respond we could respond and
[1:05:28] still hang on to our life
[1:05:32] we had to give up
[1:05:34] something now when god first called me
[1:05:37] he didn't tell me everything i was doing
[1:05:39] wrong he just told me i was an outright
[1:05:40] sinner without him i'm going to die
[1:05:43] so i did the best i could to repent give
[1:05:45] him everything i had but that wasn't
[1:05:47] enough he kept telling me you got to
[1:05:49] take care of this and you got to cut
[1:05:50] your hair you got to get rid of that
[1:05:52] world of music you got to stop there
[1:05:53] smoking it
[1:05:54] it would seem like non-stop
[1:05:57] but that's good signs of god amen
[1:06:00] because he's trying to
[1:06:02] prosper my soul
[1:06:05] but the call
[1:06:07] understand is not just to salvation
[1:06:12] as we would know it or if i could say it
[1:06:14] like this it's not just to justification
[1:06:18] the call wasn't just to justification
[1:06:22] the call was to become him
[1:06:25] if the seed of god is in us to be him we
[1:06:28] can't stop short of that
[1:06:32] and that's what the devil is trying to
[1:06:33] put on the church
[1:06:35] are you with me
[1:06:39] there will be many believers who never
[1:06:41] come to full manifestation of christ
[1:06:44] jesus said not all that say lord lord
[1:06:46] shall enter in
[1:06:48] a good good good scripture brother
[1:06:50] branham said in in the message show us
[1:06:52] the father and it sufficeth us
[1:06:54] he said he's talking about the
[1:06:56] agricultural hour
[1:06:59] he said it's kind of a little 4-h club
[1:07:02] now
[1:07:04] they got a little machine that turns out
[1:07:06] corn just makes corn
[1:07:08] the agriculture hour they had it and
[1:07:11] many farmers are sitting here probably
[1:07:14] know of it
[1:07:17] and that machine will run out grain of
[1:07:19] corn so perfect
[1:07:21] that you can take a handful out of that
[1:07:23] sack
[1:07:26] a a a handful out of the uh
[1:07:29] the true sack
[1:07:31] that that is corn and run it out of the
[1:07:34] machine
[1:07:35] and
[1:07:36] uh
[1:07:38] that has grown in the field and then mix
[1:07:41] them together and you couldn't tell them
[1:07:42] apart if you had to
[1:07:45] one made by the machine
[1:07:47] one made by god
[1:07:49] you put them together and he says you
[1:07:51] couldn't tell them apart if you had to
[1:07:54] now remember he's talking about
[1:07:55] christians here
[1:07:57] and this over here that machine run will
[1:08:00] make just as good a corn meal as
[1:08:03] this one will
[1:08:04] it'll make the same kind of corn flakes
[1:08:10] you take and cut it open and put them in
[1:08:12] a laboratory perhaps and the skin under
[1:08:14] it will look thick under the microscope
[1:08:16] and the hearts in the right place put it
[1:08:18] under the analysts
[1:08:20] and it'll be the same amount of potash
[1:08:22] and the same amount of calcium and the
[1:08:24] same amount of moisture just exactly the
[1:08:26] same he said there's no way in the world
[1:08:28] of telling him
[1:08:29] only one way he said bury them
[1:08:34] bury them
[1:08:37] the one that's made just
[1:08:39] rots away
[1:08:42] that's all there is to it
[1:08:45] but the one that god made
[1:08:47] it's got a germ of life in it
[1:08:49] and it will reproduce itself again
[1:08:54] not going to come out quarter way
[1:08:58] not going to be the mini corns
[1:09:00] or
[1:09:01] mini wheat
[1:09:02] mini wheats you know any wheat sir
[1:09:05] in the message the rapture brother
[1:09:07] branham says that if you want to put
[1:09:09] that down it's first corinthians 12 13
[1:09:11] and by one spirit
[1:09:13] we are all baptized
[1:09:15] and he said that spirit is the life of
[1:09:17] christ is that right congregation says
[1:09:19] amen
[1:09:21] the life of christ which
[1:09:24] he was the word seed
[1:09:26] brings the seed of life he says you get
[1:09:28] it
[1:09:29] if that life is laying in the seed
[1:09:32] and this baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:35] comes upon it it's bound to bring that
[1:09:39] seed to life
[1:09:42] we
[1:09:43] should have every right to expect christ
[1:09:45] manifested in our life
[1:09:49] and if we don't
[1:09:51] we got to get down in the ground and die
[1:09:53] out
[1:09:55] because we got too much of this flesh
[1:09:57] still living
[1:10:00] it's not going to stop midstream
[1:10:04] it's going to keep bringing forth more
[1:10:06] and more and more because it's that soul
[1:10:10] that needs to prosper
[1:10:13] in the message things that are to be
[1:10:15] brother man says don't stay
[1:10:17] in the seed
[1:10:19] go right on out into the perfect part
[1:10:26] prosperity our souls don't stay there we
[1:10:30] have a choice
[1:10:33] we can be church view warmers
[1:10:35] or we can hold ourselves accountable
[1:10:38] god's speaking to my heart and i want to
[1:10:40] prosper
[1:10:44] in the message of the masterpiece
[1:10:47] brother branham said the grain seed
[1:10:51] in the original
[1:10:52] fell at nicaea
[1:10:55] for it was the first denomination
[1:10:59] notice that the life that was in the
[1:11:00] stock tassel all ends up in the seed the
[1:11:02] life that comes out of the original seed
[1:11:05] come out through the different processes
[1:11:07] three different processes and then turns
[1:11:09] back to its original condition he said
[1:11:12] hallelujah oh my i'm the happiest person
[1:11:15] in the world that god has let me see
[1:11:18] this
[1:11:20] watch how perfect the word and this
[1:11:22] nature works together
[1:11:28] what brother branham is saying here
[1:11:31] is that the natural types the spiritual
[1:11:34] what god does
[1:11:36] in a a natural corner wheat he does it
[1:11:39] and he did it through the church ages
[1:11:41] and we've been taught this
[1:11:43] through luther through wesley through
[1:11:45] pentecost through justification
[1:11:48] sanctification and baptism of the holy
[1:11:50] ghost we understand that right
[1:11:53] but this just didn't happen in history
[1:11:55] with the natural church
[1:11:58] and we just didn't pop up in the end at
[1:12:00] the end time message
[1:12:03] this is a type of what every believer
[1:12:05] goes through and it doesn't matter if
[1:12:07] he's in the message or he's not in the
[1:12:08] message
[1:12:10] this is a type of the stages of what the
[1:12:13] true seed of god will go through
[1:12:18] every one every believer will go through
[1:12:20] these steps
[1:12:22] and if he is a seed of god that's
[1:12:25] germinated he's not going to stop with
[1:12:28] justification
[1:12:29] amen
[1:12:32] his soul is going to prosper
[1:12:34] it's going to prosper into
[1:12:36] sanctification
[1:12:38] it's going to prosper into the holy
[1:12:40] ghost being sealed by the holy ghost
[1:12:44] and then after he's sealed he's going to
[1:12:45] go on amen amen there's more there's
[1:12:50] more don't come to church without
[1:12:51] expecting more
[1:12:53] it's a bad thing to get into
[1:12:56] you can't ex you can't put your
[1:12:59] your
[1:13:00] all your uh emphasis on well if if the
[1:13:04] music gets me feeling good or if the
[1:13:06] preacher gets me in that condition of
[1:13:08] trying harder you can't do that you're
[1:13:11] gonna miss the message
[1:13:25] if you've been baptized in the name of
[1:13:26] jesus christ
[1:13:28] you've been justified in the sight of
[1:13:29] god
[1:13:31] but remember you can't stay there
[1:13:36] it'll die
[1:13:37] you will die
[1:13:39] as sure as anything
[1:13:41] the seed will never remain in
[1:13:42] justification it's contrary to the law
[1:13:45] of god
[1:13:46] now i'm going to go ahead and try to
[1:13:48] explain this some of us
[1:13:54] i believe this will be a blessing for
[1:13:56] all of us
[1:13:58] but to show where you can't stay there
[1:14:00] you'll die
[1:14:03] well
[1:14:05] we've heard brother branham said that
[1:14:07] these denominations this this luther
[1:14:11] this justification that just shall live
[1:14:12] by faith this was their message
[1:14:15] they preached that message
[1:14:18] and they kept preaching that message
[1:14:20] and god says whoa whoa whoa well we're
[1:14:22] turning a quarter we're turning this
[1:14:25] corner
[1:14:27] because god's building a building and
[1:14:29] not a wall
[1:14:32] so he's telling the church
[1:14:34] sanctification
[1:14:36] and the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:14:39] so every one of us needs to be turning
[1:14:41] corners
[1:14:44] not us as a group turning a quarter but
[1:14:47] you as individuals need to be turning
[1:14:49] corners
[1:14:50] you need to be building your builder
[1:14:51] we're a spiritual house built up for for
[1:14:54] god's
[1:14:54] inhabits where are you in this process
[1:14:59] i'm telling you sure is anything if you
[1:15:01] stop where you're at you will die in
[1:15:04] this age you will die
[1:15:09] in the message the pergamos church age
[1:15:12] here here's what i'm trying to say to
[1:15:14] you
[1:15:15] the law of reproduction
[1:15:17] is that each species brings forth of its
[1:15:20] own kind
[1:15:21] even according to genesis 1 11 and god
[1:15:23] said let the earth bring forth grass and
[1:15:25] herbs eating seed and the fruit tree
[1:15:27] yielding fruit after its kind whose seed
[1:15:30] is in itself upon the earth and it was
[1:15:32] soul
[1:15:33] whatsoever now whatever life
[1:15:35] was in
[1:15:36] the seed came forth into a plant and
[1:15:41] thence into fruit
[1:15:44] the very same law applies to the church
[1:15:46] today
[1:15:48] whatever seed started in the church
[1:15:50] will come forth and be like the original
[1:15:53] seed because it's the same seed
[1:15:59] we don't want the seed that looks like
[1:16:01] the seed
[1:16:02] that doesn't have life
[1:16:05] we want
[1:16:07] to the seed to our seed to bring forth
[1:16:10] life
[1:16:16] in
[1:16:16] these last days the true bride of christ
[1:16:19] christ's seed
[1:16:20] will come to the headstone
[1:16:23] and
[1:16:24] and she will be
[1:16:27] a super church
[1:16:29] a super race as she nears
[1:16:32] him so do we see the day approaching yes
[1:16:36] amen do we see him
[1:16:40] they
[1:16:41] in the bride will be so much like him
[1:16:45] that they will even be in his very image
[1:16:52] i love this
[1:16:54] this is in order to be united with them
[1:16:58] they will be one they will be
[1:17:00] the they will be the very manifestation
[1:17:03] of the word of the living god
[1:17:05] denominations cannot produce this it's
[1:17:09] the wrong seed well just for a minute
[1:17:12] why denominations because they stopped
[1:17:16] because they stopped because if any
[1:17:19] denomination would have kept growing in
[1:17:21] the lord they would have accepted this
[1:17:22] message that they would have been part
[1:17:24] of the message
[1:17:26] because god's message is growing to the
[1:17:28] statue of a perfect man
[1:17:30] [Music]
[1:17:34] and when we get these ideas of just
[1:17:36] coasting
[1:17:40] you're not prospering spiritually
[1:17:43] no matter what the focus is naturally
[1:17:46] right
[1:17:47] the true life of christ will move right
[1:17:49] on through the star through
[1:17:51] sanctification
[1:17:53] the life cannot remain in justification
[1:17:56] it's impossible
[1:18:00] you would be very unhappy
[1:18:02] you plant seeds
[1:18:04] and you hold me tell me does a garden
[1:18:09] who don't even want to participate in
[1:18:10] this
[1:18:12] imagine plowing the garden
[1:18:15] planting the seeds and none of them
[1:18:17] coming forth
[1:18:19] bad well what if they came forth but
[1:18:21] they only came
[1:18:23] but they didn't bring forth fruit
[1:18:25] we'd all be disappointed
[1:18:27] god's going to be disappointed if we
[1:18:28] don't bring forth the fruit of the
[1:18:30] manifestation of christ in their lives
[1:18:33] so it's not up to the preacher to get us
[1:18:35] motivated
[1:18:37] it's not
[1:18:39] it's not you're in sore condition
[1:18:44] it's between you and god it's you taking
[1:18:47] the word that you're hearing and saying
[1:18:49] i believe it i'm going forward with what
[1:18:51] i'm hearing
[1:18:53] that's where it's going to come
[1:18:55] as you
[1:18:56] activate your relationship with the lord
[1:18:59] that's what's going to get you excited
[1:19:01] amen
[1:19:03] how can a man stop the law of god
[1:19:08] it can't if the seed of god is in you
[1:19:11] you couldn't stop it if you had to
[1:19:13] it's like a fire shut up in your bones
[1:19:18] now we're in the age of the full
[1:19:19] maturity of jesus christ where the
[1:19:21] nature christ must bring forth it must
[1:19:25] be in the bride
[1:19:27] we must start prospering more in our
[1:19:30] souls
[1:19:32] focusing on the souls
[1:19:35] notice what brother branham said about
[1:19:36] the denominations as soon as they
[1:19:39] stopped walking they died
[1:19:43] showing us at any time that the word of
[1:19:44] god stops in our life
[1:19:47] we die
[1:19:49] no i i'm not lutheran enough wesley but
[1:19:51] if i stop i'm john martin dead call me
[1:19:54] whatever denomination you want
[1:19:57] we've got to be coming with anticipation
[1:20:01] i'm going to become more like christ if
[1:20:02] that's not there that's the first thing
[1:20:04] that needs to get done
[1:20:07] amen
[1:20:12] we don't want to make the same mistakes
[1:20:14] as the denominations we won't make the
[1:20:16] rapture
[1:20:18] we should be seeking out more truth to
[1:20:21] walk in amen
[1:20:23] when we come to church brother brandon
[1:20:24] said like this we need to come to find
[1:20:26] out where we're at with god well if
[1:20:28] every time we come to church oh how do
[1:20:30] you know that i already know that oh you
[1:20:31] heard that i already i already already
[1:20:33] are then what are we here for
[1:20:35] here for the fellowship
[1:20:36] here for the music
[1:20:38] here to appease my conscience that i
[1:20:40] came to church
[1:20:42] i mean there's a lot of reasons that the
[1:20:43] enemy can throw at us but what we need
[1:20:45] is to start prospering our souls
[1:20:47] that's between you and the lord
[1:20:50] it's it's it's a one-on-one it's you and
[1:20:52] god
[1:20:55] jesus said in matthew 6 verse 32 for
[1:20:57] after all these things you the gentiles
[1:21:00] seek
[1:21:03] for your heavenly father knoweth that ye
[1:21:05] have need of all these things
[1:21:08] but seek ye first the kingdom
[1:21:11] and his
[1:21:12] righteousness and all these things shall
[1:21:14] be added unto you you notice god would
[1:21:17] that you would prosper
[1:21:19] in health
[1:21:21] and in all things
[1:21:23] even as your soul prospers
[1:21:27] you've got to put the priority on the
[1:21:29] soul
[1:21:31] sure we all want to pray it's just a
[1:21:33] natural thing to prosper in every way
[1:21:37] but where how many times have we focused
[1:21:39] in the last week about my soul
[1:21:40] prospering
[1:21:44] colossians chapter 3 verse 1 if ye then
[1:21:47] be risen with christ
[1:21:50] seek those things
[1:21:51] which are above
[1:21:53] where christ is sitting on the right
[1:21:56] hand of god
[1:21:59] set your affections on things above
[1:22:03] not on the things of the earth
[1:22:09] and i you know i'm okay with everybody
[1:22:11] that wants to prosper and use the word
[1:22:14] to get them to prosper
[1:22:18] but that just has nothing to do with the
[1:22:20] soul
[1:22:22] it has nothing to do about getting ready
[1:22:24] for a rapture
[1:22:25] it has nothing to do with the perfect
[1:22:27] will of god for a man's life
[1:22:32] god didn't spend time trying to teach
[1:22:34] lazarus how to be a good businessman
[1:22:41] we just need to abide in the calling
[1:22:43] that god's called us
[1:22:45] i believe in and reaching forth i
[1:22:47] believe in not uh
[1:22:50] being under the foot of the devil
[1:22:52] but i don't believe in using god for me
[1:22:54] naturally
[1:22:56] without
[1:22:58] seeking
[1:23:00] the prosperity of my soul first
[1:23:03] i just don't i would feel like a robber
[1:23:06] i'm robbing god
[1:23:08] using god i don't want to use god
[1:23:11] i want to follow this scripture i want
[1:23:12] to seek first the kingdom
[1:23:15] then all things added
[1:23:17] i i want to to to prosper in my soul and
[1:23:21] and let god trust god for all the needs
[1:23:25] he says we are dead and your life is hid
[1:23:27] with christ when christ who is our life
[1:23:29] shall appear then shall we all he also
[1:23:31] appear with him in glory
[1:23:36] christ didn't die for the prosperity of
[1:23:39] our natural man alone
[1:23:48] but he died for the prosperity of our
[1:23:49] souls brother branham said in the
[1:23:50] message from that time says just
[1:23:52] remember
[1:23:53] i'll say this
[1:23:54] with the faith that i have in that
[1:23:56] vision
[1:23:57] whatever it was i'll sp i'll speak it in
[1:24:00] the name of the lord
[1:24:03] he said except you have perfect love
[1:24:06] you'll never be there
[1:24:09] he said cause nothing could ever
[1:24:12] be there without it
[1:24:16] and then he went on to say
[1:24:18] your spirit
[1:24:19] would be out of place there
[1:24:24] because we got this concept that somehow
[1:24:26] when i die i'm going to be changed i'm
[1:24:27] going to be so in love with everybody
[1:24:31] i'm going to be
[1:24:32] fit for heaven
[1:24:34] why would that if that's so true then
[1:24:37] why would the prophet tell us whatever
[1:24:38] you do lay everything aside that you got
[1:24:41] going and focus on getting that
[1:24:46] because that's the prosperity of the
[1:24:48] soul
[1:24:51] are you with me amen
[1:24:53] he said it couldn't come it couldn't
[1:24:55] come there there'd be no way for it to
[1:24:57] come
[1:24:58] no more than it would be for a grain of
[1:25:00] corn to rise up out of the ground
[1:25:02] without a germ of life in it
[1:25:04] no matter how natural it would look it
[1:25:06] could not rise
[1:25:09] my friend you owe people you young
[1:25:11] people
[1:25:12] you don't know what time you're going to
[1:25:14] leave we don't know that
[1:25:16] but let me persuade you as a christian
[1:25:18] brother
[1:25:19] that loves you
[1:25:20] except you're born again and the spirit
[1:25:23] of
[1:25:23] god's love comes into your heart
[1:25:26] you'll certainly miss
[1:25:28] that place
[1:25:30] now it's true that
[1:25:32] we come in here a sinner we repent we
[1:25:35] get baptized the same day we're
[1:25:37] justified we're i mean we are on the
[1:25:41] top page with god
[1:25:43] but the next day that you live
[1:25:46] god's going to want you to
[1:25:47] walk up amen
[1:25:49] now wherever you're at on your page i'm
[1:25:51] just asking you to look up
[1:25:53] what is your next step
[1:25:55] don't wait for the preacher to persuade
[1:25:57] you
[1:25:58] be persuaded in your own self i i am my
[1:26:02] my heart is fixed i know the direction
[1:26:04] i'm going i know what image i'm to
[1:26:06] become
[1:26:07] and i know what's on my heart when i
[1:26:09] come to church i want to walk in the
[1:26:11] truth that's presented to me
[1:26:14] often we come with so many other needs
[1:26:16] and so many other things
[1:26:20] i uh third john
[1:26:22] verse 1 the elder unto the well beloved
[1:26:25] gays whom i love and the truth beloved i
[1:26:27] wish above all things
[1:26:29] that thou mayest prosper too many people
[1:26:32] stop right there and be in health
[1:26:35] they preach their prosperity message but
[1:26:37] they don't even mention even as they so
[1:26:40] prosperous
[1:26:41] some preachers think hey
[1:26:43] if you're if you're
[1:26:45] prospering
[1:26:47] well out here that shows that you're
[1:26:48] doing good with your soul
[1:26:52] but that's the way they think and they
[1:26:53] push the one
[1:26:56] we need to push
[1:26:58] our souls
[1:27:00] for i rejoice greatly
[1:27:02] when the brethren came and testified to
[1:27:04] the truth that is in thee that thou
[1:27:07] even as thou walkest in the truth now
[1:27:10] notice he's talking about prosperity
[1:27:12] here
[1:27:13] it's not a new subject
[1:27:16] i have no greater joy than to hear that
[1:27:18] my children are walking in truth when he
[1:27:20] the spirit of truth
[1:27:22] is come
[1:27:23] he will guide you he will lead you and
[1:27:25] guide you into all truth
[1:27:28] now i'm not there today i'm not there
[1:27:30] today so i know that the holy ghost is
[1:27:33] leading me into more truth amen amen
[1:27:38] so am i going to be just
[1:27:40] at ease with my soul
[1:27:43] cross
[1:27:45] looking at the other things
[1:27:48] or am i going to seek to walk in the
[1:27:50] truth
[1:27:53] god is able
[1:27:55] to make all grace abound in her life
[1:27:59] the more humble we are the more grace is
[1:28:01] available to us
[1:28:03] and the more we seek to prosper our
[1:28:05] souls the more god would have us to
[1:28:08] prosper in all things it's that simple
[1:28:11] amen
[1:28:12] but we've got to be the one
[1:28:14] to seek the prosperity of our souls
[1:28:18] just just
[1:28:19] make the decision
[1:28:20] don't debate it
[1:28:23] don't think about it next week just make
[1:28:25] the decision
[1:28:26] i'm going to put more attention to the
[1:28:28] prosperity of my soul whatever i got to
[1:28:30] do
[1:28:31] pray more seek the lord more spend more
[1:28:34] time just get more earnest with god
[1:28:36] whatever it is god will show you the
[1:28:38] truth he wants you to walk in amen
[1:28:40] amen let's stand please
[1:28:45] walking in more truth is the key to the
[1:28:47] prosperity of our souls
[1:28:50] walking in truth
[1:28:55] have you ever been
[1:28:58] just sitting at home
[1:29:01] not in church not listening to a tape
[1:29:03] not reading your bible not praying
[1:29:05] and all of a sudden something spoke to
[1:29:07] your heart
[1:29:10] that god wanted you to do something
[1:29:14] that tells me you don't have to be in
[1:29:16] church to hear the truth
[1:29:20] it's just being in tune with god amen
[1:29:25] i think god is calling us to prosper in
[1:29:27] our souls
[1:29:29] who knows what he would do otherwise but
[1:29:31] as long as we're prospering in our souls
[1:29:33] that's all that matters
[1:29:36] will be a tool that god can use for his
[1:29:38] kingdom i wish i had time to get into it
[1:29:41] but you remember that
[1:29:43] that
[1:29:45] this shepherd
[1:29:47] will leave the 99 sheep
[1:29:50] and go get that one
[1:29:56] because that's where his heart is at
[1:30:01] and he's happier with that
[1:30:04] one that came in than us 99 sitting here
[1:30:09] and what's the scripture say the
[1:30:11] scripture says that heaven rejoices over
[1:30:14] that one
[1:30:16] he really don't care how heaven don't
[1:30:17] care how much money i got don't care
[1:30:22] what my blood pressure is
[1:30:25] how healthy i am
[1:30:28] but he is interested in my soul
[1:30:31] prospering
[1:30:33] we got to move on praise god for where
[1:30:35] we're at yes let's move on to where
[1:30:37] god's calling us to amen amen let's bow
[1:30:40] our hearts in a in a word of prayer
