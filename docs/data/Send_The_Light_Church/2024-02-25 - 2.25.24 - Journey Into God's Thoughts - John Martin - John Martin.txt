we're grateful for all of that and if you're wondering we're not we don't pass a plate but we have a box in the back if you want to leave an offering we'd be thankful for that I'm Bound for the

I am Bound for the promised land I am Bound for the promised land I am Bound for the promised land oh who will come and go with me I am Bound for The Promise Land amen amen praise the Lord amen brother Johnson said he had a little testimony wanted to give I first want to thank all of you for praying for me when I was in the hospital and uh recupera and and I I I thought uh I really appreciate the young people that are going up to pray at the altar and I thought that I would give this testimony to you because I went to The Altar for seven years and the reason he could not uh feel me with the Holy Spirit I tell the Lord I'll do anything but preach and it the Holy Spirit wouldn't come so there was a a minister that was a good friend of myself and my father he invited me to go to his church and it was a church that my dad had had had started with a with the brush aror anybody know what a brush aror is H well anyway it's it's it don't keep the rain from coming through but but uh uh anyway uh I went to his church and I'm sure that he and his wife had been praying for me to receive the Hool Holy Ghost and so during this during the song service he he he was waiting for the Saints to choose another song and he just stepped out to the pool pit and he said he said without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're not going to be ready for the Rapture well I believe I believe that that was the truth you know so in my spirit I just said I'm getting it tonight and there was some Spirit not too far from me and I know it was the devil but he said you're not going to get it I'm getting it tonight he said even if you stay till the sun comes up in the morning you're not going to get it and that made me mad at the Devil and I want to say to you it's good to be mad at the Devil amen amen so so that night he his presence came down upon me and I had I had always told God I'll do anything but preach I didn't want to preach but that night when I felt his presence real strong and then he showed me a light that went through the ceiling through the roof I saw there was a big oak tree at this little country church and I could see the limbs of that oak tree I followed that light till it P the moon and then I I said that's him I said Lord I'll do anything even preach and immediately they're Shine the bright I believe it was the pillow of fire because I couldn't I couldn't find the end of it but I knew it when it passed the moon uh it it had to be close to where the Lord and so and so when I said that this light shined upon me so I want to say to you that are seeking the Holy Spirit don't hold nothing back am be willing to do anything he calls you to do and he'll he will give it to you and I want to I want to pray for you often and I appreciate you being so kind to me uh uh to come here and fill at home and it's so good to see quite a few visitors today I don't know all of you but I know that some are sick I just thank God for every one of you and I thank God for allowing you to to be my friend God bless you amen let's all stand together that's a good testimony amen amen amen people think well I just read about that in the Bible Well I experienced it so let's just sing only believe as brother John comes only believe only believe all things are possible only believe only believe only believe all things are possible only believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord bless you brother Jen all things are possible Lord I believe Jesus is here Jesus is here Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is here Jesus is here Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is here amen and he is the reason we are here amen amen we come to meet with him I'm so thankful that brother Johnson asked for the holy spirit in his heart I I believe I know this that God God can use anybody but God used him to lead me to Christ amen and we're all connected amen and we're just grateful for the the Holy Spirit I believe that same holy spirit is here today amen amen and he desires to do the same thing for each and every one of us amen I I I I've never got to the place where I feel filled enough I'm always looking for more amen well God bless you today turn with with me if you would to the Book of Psalms 139 before uh we're be seated we we want to welome welcome our our dear visitors Charlie and Debbie God bless you um they're from the area and they're just looking for a church and I just think it's such a commendable thing uh when you move to look for a church um because there's so many people that are just moving and and staying out of church and maybe some get online but to be a part of a local body and they're searching so let's I believe they would appreciate our prayers if we would pray for them that God would lead him to the place it'd have have them to be of course we we believe it would be here but we want God to show them that amen amen Psalms 139 we'll start with verse uh number 14 and go to 18 for I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made amen marvelous are thy works and my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they are more in number than the sand and when I awake I am still with thee amen amen let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for you for knowing us from the very very beginning Lord you know our every thought you know what we've done every day of our life you know the the number of hairs upon our head you know every sparrow that falls you are awesome you are great and greatly to be praised we thank you for these scriptures here this morning for your entire word and to know that your thoughts are precious towards us Lord we're imperfect we've come short of your glory yet your thoughts are precious towards us the some of them are just amazing and Lord we pray that you would break this bread of life to us this morning as we look into the scriptures and just take a journey to the thoughts that you would have and that you have had and that you uh you continue to have towards us your children God we'll be careful to thank you and to praise you this morning may you encourage us strengthen us guide us Lord direct our path correct us where we need correction father we just desire you to be preeminent amongst us bless your people with a greater revelation of who they are today we ask it all in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you may be seated we want to entitle this journey into God's thoughts and just take a look a little bit at at God's thoughts at us that word sum says how great is the sum of them how great is the sum of God's precious thoughts towards us that word sum it's a total amount everybody knows what the word sum is we probably learned that in in math class it's you put a bunch of numbers together whether you're add them subtract them and and the sum is is at the end and it's uh and God has a some thought for all of us today it can be very difficult to know the thoughts of God the Bible says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as the heaven is higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts Micah 46 says that they know not the thoughts of God Amen Psalms 92:5 says and thy thoughts are very deep we could say that God is a deep thinker God's thoughts are often quite different than our thoughts often we think we might know what God's thoughts are but we come to find out so many times that that really wasn't God that we were thinking and that's why we've been taught in the Bible to say and to think if it would be the will of the Lord the Lord willing because we just don't always know the thoughts of God Jesus thanked the father one time he said I thank thee father because thou has has hid these things certain thoughts certain things from the wise and The Prudent and yet those same thoughts were revealed to babes Amen to babe so God's got the ability to to keep his thought from someone one who's very very very smart in the Bible and he's also uh capable of of showing a child that same thought that he's hiding from somebody else amen and and you know it takes a lot those of us that have children have talked to Children it can it actually takes a lot to break something down to their level that same thought hid from the wise broke down to where we can understand it and it all has to do with a relationship amen because God sees the heart amen thank God that he sees our hearts today have you ever noticed when God reveal something to you you you and you you you conclude how simple it really was right that you never think well this is really complex it was boy it was that simple I didn't realize how simple it was I believe that God is here this morning and I believe that he's hid in Simplicity but he also wants to reveal himself in Simplicity not to be looking somewhere but just right here in his word he's looking for those that are hungry and thirsty the sum of God's thoughts can be sometimes frightening amen on the day of judgment we're going to a lot of people are going to hear the sum of God's thoughts Hebrews 10:30 says the Lord shall judge his people it is a fearful thing to fall in the hands of a living God Amen we can see the conclusion of the whole matter to fear God to keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man it just kind of sums it up for God shall bring every work into judgment and every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil I'll just say if we've ever done any wrong just say God cleanse me and forgive me of that cover me with your blood because we don't want it between us and God Amen God has summed up a lot of things for us and we know that because of his his his word basically this word is God's thoughts that have been expressed amen can you say Amen to that amen God some uh he some the of God's thoughts on iniquity and we know iniquity is simply not doing the right thing that we know to do not going doing bad things amen it's not doing the things that we know that we've been taught to do that we should be doing Jesus said many will come to me in that day and say Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and cast out devils and did many wonderful works then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity amen so iniquity in our personal life is more important to God that we get rid of it than him using us for his kingdom God would rather have iniquity away from our life than to actually use us for his kingdom and he's making this the statement here so the sum of God's thoughts on iniquity is that we need to separate from iniquity because God is let them that nameth the name of the Lord let him depart from iniquity God is separated from iniquity if we if we hang on to iniquity God will not hear our prayers and and he'll have to separate from us so we see the importance should be on getting rid of just it doesn't matter if I'm not doing what God wants me to do it is important it's very important God's thoughts on uh the Church of leoa the sum of God's thoughts were I counsel thee to buy of me gold amen buy the life of God that that to get your eyes anointed to to repent and open the door and let me come into your heart amen that's the the sum of God's thoughts to the Church of leoda the sum of God's thoughts on unforgiveness Jesus said if if we do not forgive one another of their trespasses then neither God will forgive us of our trespasses the the sum of God's thoughts on being judgmental judge not that you be not judged amen for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged and with what measure ye might it shall be measured to you again so we see here that God has a sum to a sum of his thoughts on certain subjects the some of God's thoughts on loving him and laying down her life the Bible says Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart amen keep them there Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments he said to love one another the very same way that I loved you so however you you feel that God has loved you he's basically loved you unconditionally amen and that's the same way that God wants us to love one another and if we're struggling with that that's because there's another Spirit on you simply because there's a wrong Spirit on you because with God's spirit he doesn't struggle in loving others no matter what they do the fact he could be hanging on the cross he say father forgive them they know not what they're doing and if that same spirit is in you today Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I believe he can forgive others when they're hurting you believe that Jesus said or the the a first John chap 3:16 said says John said because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our livs for the Brethren 1 John Chapter 2 Verse 6 he that saith he abideth in Christ how many is abided in Christ am amen how many don't want to how many don't want to participate in this uh part of the journey he that saith he abideth in Christ ought himself also to walk even as he walked so not just talk the talk but walk the walk amen verse n he that saith he is in the light and hates his brother here's the PM the PM is in dark he's in darkness even until now yes he could say he's a Christian he could say he could go to church but if he's hating his brother the man is in darkness verse 11 he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whether he's going because that Darkness has blinded his eyes how terrible it is you know you got that hate right about someone it just it's a it's a terrible feeling even if you didn't start it amen see the devil's looking for a door to kind of creep in there but we see here the sum of God's thoughts on hating someone or loving certain individuals less than others right is that hate is just a love less you don't have to look too far to see the sum of God's thoughts on any subject this word is exactly the thoughts of God Amen as a man thinketh so is he often we don't look at the sum of things we only look at part that's why when we see somebody do something we could be quick to judge them but we don't see the sum of their heart we don't see their intent we don't see what's going on only God knows that part that's right and that's why God has just called us to be Christ to them amen not to judge them judgment belongs to God Amen right we obviously have been taught to judge fruits because Jesus taught us that but that doesn't mean we judge them there's a difference if we see the fruit isn't right we pray for them the sum of God's thoughts towards us now I want to get into that this morning how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God and how great is the total of all those thoughts amen if I should count them they are more in number than the sand think about all the sand that's that's that's a lot of thoughts that God has and when I awake I am still with thee wow how precious is that what makes those thoughts so precious towards us sometimes it's hard to imagine or to believe that that God could have really any good thoughts let alone Be precious towards us and I say that because God has to deal with a lot of negative things in our life we've come short so often of his glory we've we've Fallen amen but his thoughts are still precious towards us he knows we're imperfect we read it this morning when he wants to correct us his thought in correcting us is precious that thought of correcting us God does not want us to remain in a wrong State the very fact that he would go to correct this is a precious thought he said as many as I love and rebuke many as I love love and rebuke I a chasen right so God God's love is corrective so there's something behind the correction amen it's a love it's it's a it's a precious thought that he has towards us of course if we're in a carnal State you ever been in a carnal State and somebody tries to correct you and you just get all offended bent out of shape like who are you to tell me you got Twice The Faults that I do yeah you know it can become real carnal and so when the word of God is being preached if it seems to be a little cutting you shouldn't be thinking negatively God's word his thoughts towards us are precious am precious I thank God that we have a father that is would he's done everything he could sent back the Holy Ghost to lead and guide us into all truth and that he has a vision he has predestinated us to be conformed in the image of his son and he won't stop amen he won't stop until we're there what makes God's thoughts so precious towards us Deuteronomy 7:6 says for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God have chosen thee to be a special people un to himself and I want you to think about this is you in the scriptures right here the Lord thy God has chosen you to be a special people unto himself am above all the that are upon the face of the earth oh my I cannot comprehend that but if you can put your name in the book if you can see your name in that scripture amen you're special amen very very very special not just because you go to this church not because I'm telling you because God told you it's in God's word the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people right that's right for ye were the fewest of all people even Jesus said fear not little flock right it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep his word his oath the Lord set his love upon us because he loves us I mean how are we going to comprehend that I cannot comprehend how much God loves me I can't comprehend why God loves me amen but he loves me for God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us God did not choose us to lose us now if we had chosen him we just you know what I'm gonna go I think I'm GNA go serve god well if you would have chose God good chance you would have unchosen but because because God chose us he can't lose us he said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you amen he didn't choose us to lose us he chose us for eternity he's committed how precious are his thoughts unto us and how great is the sum of them amen he's not changing his mind he's going to keep his word with us to the very in he said lo I Am With You Always even to the end of the world that's a precious thought for he have said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee that's a precious thought so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper I will not fear okay so the sum of the thought is I'm not going to have to fear because God is with me he's my helper and he's going to see me through every situation now either we believe that word we stand on that word or we doubt God you can't do both whatever the devil's been telling you you got to say get out Satan like brother Johnson was saying in his testimony he says the devil was there trying to keep me from it we've got to believe that God is with us us and that he's always with us not just based on the fact that you know we're more good than we are bad it's nothing to do with it so sum up God's thoughts about what we're going through he's committed to see us through amen now that's a precious thought to me he's committed to see us through so how great is the sum of God's thoughts towards us many thoughts he has towards us sure he wants us to walk in the light sure he wants us to grow but those are not like bad thoughts they just feel kind of like not good thoughts for our flesh but to our soul to our soul to the hungry so every bitter thing sweet so no matter what the situation is or or what we're feeling like he's going to see us through the Bible says we have a high priest which is touched with the feelings of our infirmities you may think you're going through a situation that nobody understands and it's okay if nobody understands but God understands amen and he's the only one that can make a way where there seem seeth to be no way the Bible tells us that God is faithful with every Temptation we face he's right there to make a way of Escape for us have you ever felt like God has let you down come on let's be honest listen I'm G to have you sign a piece of paper when you come in you got to participate in this stuff yeah we've all felt like God has let us down but I'm going to say that those thoughts are from the devil God has never ever ever ever let anybody down God is faithful the Bible says God is faithful we just need to keep our thoughts on the word what the word says God knows better what's what's best for us even when we think this is best for us it's like your child can you imagine your child saying look I want some more double stuff orils I know I've had 10 but I want 10 more and and that child knows what's best for his desires but he doesn't know what's best for his body am God does a lot of times we want things that is not right in accordance to God's will sometimes we feel like we we let God down too much how many's ever felt that amen all right we got more participation now like we've sinned too much we've Fallen too much we've been away from the Lord too much we haven't been praying enough and we beg to question I wonder what God really thinks of us sometimes we we feel like we let God down too much and we're not quite sure just exactly where God is standing with us so I got a scripture for for you it's Jeremiah 29:1 for I know the thoughts that I think towards you sayth the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end so so it does not matter how much you fallen today or yesterday or last week or last month or last year the thoughts that God has for us today is to give us an expected end an end that has peace with him amen thoughts that there's a a togetherness that he and his bride are going to sit together on the throne that his bride will be raptured be out of before tribulation hits that's a precious thought amen we don't have to go through that how precious are his thoughts unto us oh God how great is the sum of them the sum is to give us an expected end between here and there is a lot of ups and downs a lot of turmoil you've been on a plane you ask how was the flight sometimes they say it was pretty good it smooth and then sometimes you hear well there was some turbulence but it got you to the end am amen it can be scary sometimes but it's a peace when you land there's peace amen God doesn't hold grudges he doesn't he will gently lead us to where we need to be if for out of the will of God when the when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth he's a guide you ever been on a trip well some of you been on a trip with brother uh Joseph Smith to Israel but we've all been on little trips and uh whether you're going through a tour in a a museum and the guide will say something like this my name is John Martin and I'm going to be your guide today and I just got a few ruls before we start turn the phones off make sure that you stay together as a group and um you know watch your children okay so then we all go and as we go well there's just things happen but the guy just doesn't take you by the arm and say didn't I tell you get back in line no but he'll find a way to get things back in order that's right we serve a gentle God yes yes I I would never want to go into battle with him against him because every man will have to give an account to that gentle man one day but I'll say today the holy don't wait for the Holy Spirit to grab your arm don't wait for him to blow up your home and blow up your car and make something bad happen to you he's got a still Small Voice and he's calling you home amen he's calling you to him amen he guides us into all Truth by Revelation he reveals to you what you need to do amen and you shall know the truth amen and the truth shall make you free the only true freedom is in Christ amen now it's vital to every believer to know who Christ is and to know the thoughts that God thinks towards us he said he would build his church upon the revelation of who he is amen so we can't do nothing we cannot do nothing to force oursel to be part of God's church amen it's all up to God and God revealing himself to us amen and that becomes his church so the greatest thing we could do is humble ourselves before the Lord come under subjection to the word of God don't try blazing our own trails and doing our own thing and and saying God's with me stay a million miles away from that Devil stay with the word we are a part of Christ it's amazing how blessed we really areen the Lord chose us to be a special people I don't feel special I I don't but I know he views me as being special and that's all the difference but it's not just a special person in the world a special person unto himself above all the people that are on face of the Earth the Lord set his love upon us and chose us because he loved us he proved that love at calv which at the same time he did that he made a way for the entire world to get saved if they wanted to but he knew we would come God's precious thoughts of us go way way back first Peter tells us that Christ was crucified before God ever spoke the world into existence revelation chap 13 and 17 tells us that our names were put on the book of life before the foundation of the world that's right you and I were in the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world think about those thoughts back then it started amen when someone ask you if you're a Christian or if you don't if you know Christ you can say oh yeah we go way back yes sir way back am how precious are his thoughts unto us how great is the sum of them Ephesians 5 verse 25 says Christ loved the church and gave himself for it verse 26 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word amen you know you got churches today they don't want to be washed by the word they start washing the the the congregation with the word they're going to lose most of their congregation so they bring in entertainment they bring in something to make them feel comfortable well that's good if all you're looking for is a place to have uh uh a social fellowship with other human beings but if you're looking to get closer to God you need to be washed by the word and verse 27 tells us why he does that that he might present it to himself a glorious Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without any kind of blemish verse 30 for we are members of his body of his flesh and his bones we are members of Christ amen we were in God's thoughts before the foundation of the world we are a part of Christ's thoughts we're not some just little thought that goes out there and it doesn't mean anything God doesn't think meanly he has a purpose in his thinking he had a desire to have a church that would love him with the same love that he loved them with and there's only one group of people that will love God back with the same love that he loved them and it's the special group I'm telling you about right now the group that he chose you know too often in our carnality we could just love God if we're only getting what we want you ever have somebody just like you when they when they get what they want but as soon as you say no they all a sudden because and that's a lot of how a lot of Christians are but we're a part of God and his thoughts from the very beginning brother Bri said in the message the identification of Christ in all ages he says and now remember if you ever did or ever will have eternal life you had it with him then see you had it with him because Jesus came and Jesus was the Redeemer and to re redeem anything means to bring back amen amen from whence from where it fallen from or where or went from redeem it bring it back and you the way you look who you are what your name is that was in God's thinking before the foundation of the world Amen and God and Jesus came not to save the whole thing he wanted to but he come to redeem back that them that was his in his thoughts from the beginning what a beautiful quote amen it just puts it exactly like it is in possessing all things brother the ram say is a beautiful type of us today unworthy worthy of death when we sin but God cannot kill us because we're a part of Christ see that's our Grace because we are in Union with Christ isn't that a beautiful thought Union with Christ so therefore our sins when we do them we ought to quickly confess them that they're wrong amen because God would take our life just because we're connected to God doesn't mean we can get away with whatever we want to do no if we belong to Christ we quickly want to make things right we do not want to go one hour outside of the will of God am we don't want to just oh deal with it later no you're expressing to God that you do not love him because of this certain love you have for the world or the certain hate you have for somebody else that's right God is calling us to be in His image don't expect God to come down to our image Amen in the message identification brother said if he is a redeemer he come to redeem uh to redeem us to pick up that which was Fallen to redeem back to a place where we were at the beginning so none will be picked up from them that was in his thoughts at the beginning so none will be picked up but them that was in his thoughts at the beginning that's why it's important to know to know that you are in God's thoughts it's so important that way the devil can't come and begin to play with you that oh you're not a Christian this is all fake no I've made a decision and here is the proof that I made my decision I put my state down and I'm serving God to the best of my ability every single day in my life because that's the Revelation that I got not why I I I repented I got baptized now I'm just going to go to halfheartedly serve God and think that I belong to God you're on dangerous territory there is no scripture there is no quote there is nothing that's going to back that up stay under the word stay under the word that is the blood for the day is the word of God Amen the bleeding word he come to redeem not this Canon fder that we see around professing to be Christians but that he came to redeem that was in God's thinking at the beginning see all we're we are is we are an expression of what God was thinking think about that we're we're an expression of what God was thinking and when you see that your life is not lining up with the word you quickly say this is more important to me than my will Jesus said blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear we're a blessed people brother B said in the message of revelation of Jesus Christ he says that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people right do you believe you're that class am amen you can expect God to reveal himself to you you it's imperative that we seek the full revelation of who we are who we are in Christ the brandom said in the message of revelation of Jesus Christ he says but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it right it's true you can't go anywhere without you know the devil hanging around making it lukewarm making it form making it powerless it exposes Satan he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people can get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army amen by coming in Union with the thought of God God has has the thought he already has the thought we got to come in Union with that thought we're the ones that need to to to get that thought to become an invincible Army I'll tell you I see too often the devil trying to beat up Christians you know you don't defeat the Devil with uh momentum and and and your favorite song and and your I'm going to fight him with your at no you just you you you you fight them with the same same thing that Jesus fought him with the word of God it is written and you stay there because the devil's going to keep going like this and you got to keep keep giving the word if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern to withstand the Antichrist Satan will be powerless before her if we are a part of God we are a part of the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God Amen in the message identification brother Brandon said then if you were with God in his thoughts at the beginning how can you deny his word being true when you're a part of the word I've you know brother br's often said you say you got the Holy Ghost but how can you deny the word which the Holy Ghost wrote amen I mean we have an absolute my feelings are not absolute my ideas are not absolute my imagination this is what I think God wants me to do that that does not mean anything it's sinking sand but if you humble yourself to the word regardless and I'll say this you will have to not lean on your understanding to stay with the word you will do things you don't feel like doing you will bring yourself under subjection to that word and when you do you will now be kept by the power of God Amen but you got to put your foot forward amen when we're reading the Bible you know what we're doing we're exploring the very thoughts of God Amen how precious are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they are more in number than the sand and when I awake I'm still with did you ever have a bad dream we should all like raise our hands with that one because we probably had one this week you know what I'm saying Satan just doesn't doesn't like to leave us alone and you wake up and you say GL that was just a dream when I awake I am still with thee God Is With Us amen he is still with us the Su of God's thoughts are he that we are the apple of his eye the Bible says amen Ze Zechariah 28 says and he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye his eyes are over the righteous and his ears are open to the cries Jesus himself said the two spirits in the last days would be so close that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible but because the elect are part of the word no matter how much they stumble how much they fall how much they get out of the will of God God will bring them back has to because they are part of the word right this is what I say don't ever get in the habit of feeling comfortable out of the will of God that is one of the worst one of the worst uh signs that you do not belong to him not all that strong but look God is not raising disobedient children and God does God does not encourage us to play roulette he doesn't want us to gamble we only got enough time to get ready and if we have the love of God in the heart we care about getting other people ready and that's the main thing because no matter if we get people ready we don't get people ready we serve God or don't serve God this is a for sure thing Jesus is coming and he's coming soon so it's up to us where where we want to fit in brother bam talks about these two Spirits he calls one the true church and the other the false Church the true church is receiving and manifesting the word the false church is just hearing the word but as we read is lukewarm formal and Powerless see how close they can be they still go to church they still live good lives but there's no power to overcome amen no power to overcome their situations Jesus said the false church has identified themselves as having need of nothing think about that a person who acts like I don't need you I don't need to go to church I don't need to I don't need to pay tie I don't you are identifying yourself who you are I don't need to do it you're doing it and the sum of his thoughts towards that church is I will spew them out of my mouth but God's true church is still pressing in am towards the character of Jesus Christ becoming the manifested word of the hour the Bible tells us the whole earth is groaning and waiting for us right to be manifested and and I'll tell you if the whole earth is groaning waiting for that why are we why are why why are we waiting for somebody else to get excited in the Lord and to start saying Amen to the word and believe in it before we do amen why why are we waiting for five other Davids to rise up before we say oh yeah I'm going to be on David's side the true church is still mortifying the Deeds of her body she's still dying daily and the sum of God's thoughts towards the true church is he is protecting them he is protecting them one group he spews out of the mouth the other group he's protecting them he's in they're in the palm of his hand the Bible says that no man can pluck them out not even the devil can get to them all because it started with his love towards them and now because he first loved us we can love him we've set our love upon him we made him our habitation right and that's why nothing can harm us I don't care what you're going through I don't care what the devil is trying to destroy God's thoughts are precious towards us we have set our affection upon him we're not turning back we're sold out we're going through well what if they lock the doors I'm going through that shows I'm just a little bit closer one group claiming that they don't need anything more than what they have is being spewed out of the mouth as Jesus said in the last days he would separate the gos from the Sheep he would do it he knows how to do it brother John this is a little discouraging what do you get why you saying that because I want to get to this part the other group cannot be separated from Christ amen they have received his Spirit they've received his word they've received his love and they cannot be separated from him nothing can separate them let's look at the sum of God's thoughts towards his elect there's no tribulation nor distress or persecution or famine nakedness peril or sword do you know these scriptures do you know these scriptures say Amen neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate them from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord nothing can separate well brother John you don't know what I'm going through I will say Amen to that but I want to say this you don't know the God who we serve amen because I would rather believe what the word says about me than what I feel about myself or what anybody else says about me how precious are his thoughts towards me amen amen these thoughts towards me are precious thoughts the very sum of them is I'm going to be with him when you read the last chapter the spirit and the bride say come we're going to be together the said in the message identification he said but there is nothing going to separate said the Bible from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus persecution Peril death itself cannot separate us because we all was always was in his thoughts all right we were always in his thoughts that's what makes the difference amen why it's important to remember that you know we get so stuck on well I'm in this mess and how do I deal with it look trust God keep connected to God the the Bible says that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US think about the sum of our sufferings cannot be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us what a precious thought all of us have done so many things in our lives that was out of the perfect will of God absolutely wrong against the word of God we've been selfish we've been evil we've been offensive to God sometimes living in the carnality of the flesh living with enity with God not even able to come to church and receive from God living in iniquity the Bible says the way of a transgressor is hard First Corinthians tells us that the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for their foolishness unto him neither can can he know them because they are spiritually discerned that's an awful condition to be in and we've all been in we can we know we know what that's saying it is a such a a scary lonely feeling to be away from God Amen and H you get to a place that you do not care what happens you got to have that relationship close back to him that's and God knows how to turn things around he's been doing it since man fell he's been reconciling man back to himself from the very beginning he knows how to do it Jesus said in John 6:39 all for of all which he have the father has given me I shall lose nothing but shall raise them up again at the last day God is not going to lose one of us amen no matter what the devil says amen God has been in the restoration business brother Stan used to work on restoring after uh floods and fires and things like that he we worked on restoring this after there was a flood God is in the restoration is that's his business and Jesus said I must be about my father's business and we must be about not only making sure that we're restored but we need to care about our fellow brother and sister they've got their names on the book too they just don't know it yet he knows how to take our current situations and turn them around turn with me if you would to Romans chapter 8 as we conclude this getting ready to wrap this up and I'm glad there was no amens after that statement there Romans 8:27 and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit he that searcheth our hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit the thoughts of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints not according to what we would like to get out of this situation but he's making intercession according to the will of God his thoughts are higher than our thoughts amen amen and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are called called according to nobody's purpose in here there's only one purpose God's purpose God's purpose you can love God you can be in the middle of his purpose and go off the deep end because you don't stay prayed up you don't you you something happens but God knows how to turn things around because he's making inter intercession for us according to the will of God and that's all that matters when it's all said and done everything that I did for myself will not be there it's what I did for Christ by Christ in love that was according to his purpose the green lights have to line up up you understand when we go to heaven we're not going to our kingdom we're going to his kingdom we get to sit with him on his throne he ain't sitting with us on our Throne all right for whom he did Forno his thoughts now he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many of us moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and to whom he called them he also Justified and to whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things if God before us it doesn't matter who's against us because it won't Prosper any weapon formed against the you won't Prosper because God is for us he's the one that holds Us in the palm of his hand he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things see God knows our situations he promised to the Bible says that he wants to bless us above all that we could ask or even think amen his ability is to bless us more he just wants us to trust him obey the word trust and Obey get into that vein get into that vein don't try to receive from God without being in that vein who shall lay anything to the charge I'm sorry what verse are we in that's right all right who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify you know it doesn't matter what anybody says about you that's right am and I'll say this people are going to say things about you they that live Godly in Christ Jesus they're going to suffer persecution the thing that God has let us know is it's those that are not seed are the ones that persecute the seed come on that's just scripture am and I'm saying that because if we're getting in the habit of saying negative things I want you to identify yourself in the scripture don't take a look at that scripture because we need to stop doing it right elect does not persecute elect it just doesn't who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifi who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died think about somebody who who condemned you who just really you know just gave you a hard time and said you're no good for nothing you're bad don't go to that extremes you know Christian wouldn't do that what you just did okay we' we've all dealt with stuff like that right here's the thing to anybody that says that did that person die for you did that person lay down his life for you usually people that are pointing fingers aren't willing to do anything to help to be honest with you but when Jesus when he's correcting us he's still protecting us he's still holding us he's still shielding us we're still in that that City of Refuge amen and I love the scripture who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yay rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God and he's making in intercession for us today today whatever the situation is let's Stand Together Philippians chapter 1 verse 6 I want to leave you with this being confident of this very thing amen he which have begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Jesus Christ amen how precious are his thoughts towards us how great is the sum of them

in God's word I can claim it though the way may seem long and the opposition strong for the bride there a way provided if I plan to go through just to hope will not do I must be firmly decided to
