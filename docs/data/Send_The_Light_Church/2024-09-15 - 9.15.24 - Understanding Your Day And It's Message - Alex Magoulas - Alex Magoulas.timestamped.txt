[38:23] we can have we can have joy in his
[38:24] presence amen so not here to prop you up
[38:27] but God's propped us up can I say it
[38:30] that way he's he has taken us who were
[38:33] dead in sins and trespasses and he has
[38:36] made us to sit down in Heavenly places
[38:39] with Christ Jesus now I don't know about
[38:41] you but it don't get much better than
[38:42] that amen amen I I couldn't imagine for
[38:46] myself something better than that so God
[38:48] is so gracious to us and now I learned a
[38:50] long time ago as the visiting Minister
[38:53] never disagree with the pastor that's
[38:55] why I agreed with you but you know then
[38:56] you get in trouble with that that too
[38:58] you know it's like I taught my kids what
[38:59] do you think about that oh yeah sure
[39:01] well you weren't supposed to agree with
[39:02] me testing people so no but we are so
[39:06] happy regardless of how frequently we
[39:08] here or not with you we just are
[39:11] thankful for what God is doing in your
[39:12] midst thankful to be part of what God's
[39:14] doing in this day wherever we're at in
[39:16] the world Amen we've got so much to be
[39:18] grateful for and so let's just if you if
[39:20] you would uh just for a moment here
[39:23] let's just change over the service and
[39:25] bow our heads for a word of Prayer I
[39:27] believe that he is here but uh it
[39:30] wouldn't do for him to come and let not
[39:31] make him welcome amen so let's just
[39:34] welcome him as we pray our heavenly
[39:36] father we are so thankful today Lord as
[39:39] we come here we've got so much to thank
[39:40] you for Lord we we could have been so
[39:42] many other places today but we're here
[39:45] Lord even for those maybe they are
[39:46] listening online they could be watching
[39:48] or listening to so many other things but
[39:50] they are participating in this Lord we
[39:53] understand that we didn't come after you
[39:56] that you drew us Lord
[39:57] plac something in our lives and all we
[40:00] can do is just say thank you Lord for
[40:02] that we acknowledge your grace and your
[40:05] mercy and the peace that you've bestowed
[40:08] in our lives to each one of us father
[40:10] that we might be partakers of this this
[40:13] divine nature through the through the
[40:15] sacrifice that was made at Calvary for
[40:17] us Lord today if there be one here that
[40:19] doesn't know you Lord or maybe they're
[40:21] just a little indifferent Lord maybe
[40:23] just a little Wayward in their heart I
[40:24] pray you'd restore such a one father May
[40:27] you forgive each one of us Lord we as
[40:29] your Prophet said we're just full of
[40:31] failure Lord but we're so grateful that
[40:33] you you know our frame that we're but
[40:36] dust that you pth us as small children
[40:39] according to your word and Lord as we've
[40:41] gathered here today we're not looking at
[40:43] us we're looking at the sacrifice that
[40:45] perfect sacrifice that was made for each
[40:47] one of us and with great confidence in
[40:50] the sinlessness and the virtue of that
[40:53] Lamb of God that was slain we can come
[40:55] boldly before your throne now for mercy
[40:58] and for grace in the time of need father
[41:00] we just pray you'd come now bless the
[41:02] reading of your word and the
[41:04] understanding thereof may you Enlighten
[41:05] our eyes may your countenance shine upon
[41:08] us father may you come and do things
[41:10] which only you can do if there be one
[41:11] sick or if there be one in need but you
[41:13] come and raise such one up for you've
[41:15] already made a way you've already paid
[41:16] the price we commit it now into your
[41:18] hands for you are a loving and a
[41:21] faithful Creator the Father of Lights in
[41:24] whom is no variableness or shadow of
[41:26] turning we thank you we give you all
[41:28] praise and glory and honor for it now in
[41:31] Jesus Christ's name and the church says
[41:35] amen if you have your Bibles this
[41:36] morning I would invite you to turn with
[41:38] me into the Book of Daniel the nth
[41:40] chapter kind of an idea I've been
[41:41] looking at lately um and I'll just say
[41:43] this now um if you haven't noticed
[41:45] already it is an election
[41:48] year for for our government and so I'm
[41:50] not here to preach politics but I I'm
[41:52] tying this in for a reason because we
[41:55] see Daniel you know one way or the other
[41:57] things are probably going to go a
[41:58] certain direction for better for worse
[42:01] whatever um you know Daniel himself was
[42:03] living in a time of a changing of
[42:06] leadership a changing of things going on
[42:08] and I'd like to take this thought today
[42:09] uh you know brother B preaches about
[42:10] recognizing your D message I'd like to
[42:12] speak on understanding your Dan's
[42:15] message so if you're with me here in
[42:16] Daniel the 9th chapter we'll just read
[42:18] the first verse here and the Bible says
[42:21] this it says in the first year of Darius
[42:23] the son of aus the seed of the mes which
[42:26] was made King over the real of the
[42:27] Chaldeans in the first year of his Reign
[42:30] I Daniel
[42:31] understood by books the number of the
[42:34] years whereof the word of the Lord came
[42:37] to Jeremiah the prophet that he would
[42:38] accomplish 70 years in the desolations
[42:42] of Jerusalem and I set my face so notice
[42:45] he's studying the word it was written
[42:47] down by a prophet right and when he does
[42:50] this he said I set my face unto the Lord
[42:54] God to seek by prayer and supplication
[42:57] with fasting sackcloth and Ashes and I
[43:01] prayed unto the Lord my God and made my
[43:03] confession and said oh Lord the great
[43:06] and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant
[43:09] Mercy to them that love him and to them
[43:11] that keep his Commandments we notice
[43:14] this we have sinned and have committed
[43:18] iniquity and have done wickedly and have
[43:21] rebelled even by departing from thy
[43:24] precepts and from thy judgments neither
[43:27] have we hearkened unto the voice I'm
[43:30] sorry unto thy servants the prophets
[43:32] which spake in thy name to our Kings our
[43:35] princes and our fathers and to all the
[43:37] people of the land oh Lord righteousness
[43:41] belongeth unto thee but unto us
[43:44] confusion of faces as at this day to the
[43:47] men of Judah and to the inhabitants of
[43:49] Jerusalem and unto all Israel that are
[43:52] near and that are far off through all
[43:55] the countries whether thou Hast d them
[43:57] because of their trespass that they have
[44:01] trespassed against thee Oh Lord to us
[44:04] belongeth confusion of face to our Kings
[44:07] to our princes and to our fathers
[44:08] because we have sinned against thee to
[44:11] the Lord Our God belong mercies and
[44:15] forgivenesses though we have rebelled
[44:17] against him neither have we obeyed the
[44:19] voice of the Lord Our God to walk in his
[44:22] laws which he set before us by his
[44:25] servants the prophets now uh for the
[44:27] sake of time I'm just going to have us
[44:29] go down here to uh we'll go down to the
[44:32] 20th verse but he basically impacts this
[44:34] idea that God had spoken to them and
[44:36] dealt with them and they hardened their
[44:38] hearts they contined to do these things
[44:39] and this is why the fury of God has come
[44:41] upon them and so here he is he's he's
[44:44] making repentance and I think it's
[44:46] significant because Daniel doesn't get
[44:48] up and say well our my fathers did this
[44:50] right you know those guys they didn't
[44:52] know they but we have sinned he's he's
[44:55] interceding he's taking upon himself
[44:56] Lord I'm no better than them Lord
[44:58] forgive us we have heartened our hearts
[45:01] we didn't hearken unto you and so he's
[45:03] he seeks Mercy from God here and in this
[45:06] 20th verse I want you to notice here I
[45:08] go here verse 20 it says this and while
[45:11] I was speaking and praying and
[45:13] confessing my sin and the sin of My
[45:16] People Israel and presenting my
[45:18] supplication before the Lord my God for
[45:21] the Holy Mountain of my God yay walls I
[45:24] was speaking in prayer even the man
[45:27] Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at
[45:29] the beginning being caused to fly
[45:31] swiftly touched me but the time notice
[45:34] of the evening oblation amen and he
[45:37] informed me and talked with me and said
[45:39] oh Daniel I am now come forth to give
[45:42] the skill and understanding at the
[45:46] beginning of thy supplications the
[45:48] Commandment came forth I am come to show
[45:50] thee for thou greatly beloved therefore
[45:53] notice understand the matter and
[45:56] consider the vision amen amen may the
[45:59] Lord bless the reading as where you may
[46:01] be seated am we're talking about
[46:03] understanding your Dan's message and and
[46:06] he understands by books where he's at he
[46:08] prays and the man the angel Gabriel
[46:11] comes and gives him a further
[46:13] understanding and so the reason I bring
[46:14] this up and why it's significant thank
[46:16] you so much um you know I I was just
[46:19] this week again I it seems like this is
[46:21] a common thing we visit this every few
[46:22] years because of politics and things and
[46:25] so I know nobody in here's politically
[46:26] minded that's a good thing but a lot of
[46:28] people are amen even in message churches
[46:30] they're very adamant about their
[46:32] politics and you know listen I'm not
[46:34] here today to tell you not to vote now I
[46:36] like I like having more money in my
[46:38] pocket than less amen I I like laws that
[46:41] are agreeable and things but the reason
[46:43] I'm saying all this is you know people
[46:45] they you know they look at the Supreme
[46:46] Court and they'll say oh see how the
[46:48] Supreme Court they turn back row versus
[46:49] Wade and they'll look at that as some
[46:51] sort of significant thing and I'm
[46:52] thinking but the problem was never
[46:54] whether it was legal or illegal the
[46:56] problem was the hearts of the people
[46:59] that want to do it in the first place
[47:00] amen because whether it's legal or it's
[47:02] illegal if they want to do it they'll
[47:04] find a way to do it amen and so I I was
[47:07] talking about this a while back and like
[47:08] I said just even somebody just a couple
[47:10] days ago you know they're talking about
[47:12] prayer in school and stuff and how our
[47:13] Supreme Court this same Supreme Court
[47:15] different different justices different
[47:17] time but the same mechanism of our
[47:19] government you know back in 1962 they
[47:22] ruled that school was not allowed to
[47:24] sanction or you know uh promote prayer
[47:26] in school that was the Supreme Court
[47:27] ruling and we don't have prayer in
[47:29] schools today amen not typically we've
[47:32] got guns We've Got Drugs we've got
[47:33] underage uh Teenage pregnancies and all
[47:36] kinds of nonsense we've got kids that
[47:38] think they're animals we've got you know
[47:40] all kinds of nonsense but we don't have
[47:42] prayer and we think that's a victory as
[47:45] a country amen and so I you know I've
[47:47] heard this for years well see they they
[47:48] took the prayer out of schools and look
[47:50] what came in but I want you to
[47:52] understand amen that uh um you know when
[47:55] they took prayer out of schools they
[47:57] didn't take it out of your
[47:58] home amen they didn't stop you from
[48:00] praying in your car they didn't stop you
[48:02] from going to church amen all these
[48:05] things that we take for granted As
[48:06] Americans amen people they oh look we
[48:09] got rid of prayer and stuff that was
[48:10] never the problem amen because listen
[48:13] they told Daniel one day he couldn't
[48:15] pray and you know he did he prayed as he
[48:18] always did
[48:20] before amen so we look at we look at uh
[48:23] the world we look at our country and the
[48:25] lack of Prayer in school
[48:27] is not the issue a lack of people that
[48:29] pray in the first place is the issue
[48:33] amen our country this what I'm getting
[48:36] at amen you could brother B said you
[48:37] could put a George Washington and an
[48:39] Abraham Lincoln and every County in this
[48:42] country it won't come back amen the
[48:45] problem is not our government we say
[48:46] well that's quite a statement that's a
[48:48] pretty big problem it is but the problem
[48:50] is the people their hearts have waxed
[48:53] gross their hearts are in darkness they
[48:56] got to away from God they rejected the
[48:58] gospel and prayer getting kicked out of
[49:01] school is just a symptom of the actual
[49:03] issue it's the people they rejected the
[49:07] gospel they rejected God and what we see
[49:10] today is just the fruit of what they've
[49:12] done amen what they did when when when
[49:15] this started to happen we we we drew
[49:17] lines and we made political affiliations
[49:19] and again I'm not here to tell you how
[49:21] to vote or anything like that but we we
[49:23] went to school board meetings and we got
[49:24] into activism we got into politics and
[49:26] we're going to we're going to bring
[49:28] America back around we're going to get
[49:30] people that that align with our
[49:32] Christian Viewpoint in our politics just
[49:35] sanction things and make it legal and
[49:37] make it comfortable listen the problem
[49:40] was what we should have done is what
[49:41] Daniel did amen when we see a country go
[49:45] this direction we should have got down
[49:47] I'm saying we as a people we as a nation
[49:49] should have got down and pray I'm not
[49:52] looking for the senator to fix it I'm
[49:54] not looking for a congressman to fix it
[49:57] I'm not looking for the president to fix
[49:58] it we should have went to the Lord and
[50:01] it's ironic to me the one place we
[50:04] should have went was in prayer because
[50:06] that was the very thing that was under
[50:08] attack and that's the last thing
[50:10] everybody did right it's just back at
[50:12] 911 we just talked about uh September
[50:14] 11th here just a few days ago amen the
[50:16] churches were full that Sunday where are
[50:19] they at today right amen their hearts of
[50:23] wax gross they don't want anything to do
[50:26] with God
[50:27] true they're not fastened after the will
[50:30] of God that's right
[50:32] amen so I made this statement I I don't
[50:35] remember who I was talking to just a day
[50:36] or two I think it was at a birthday
[50:38] party yesterday I was talking to a
[50:39] brother um the problem is in our country
[50:43] our country used to be our culture was
[50:46] influenced by the church that was the
[50:48] primary influence we came over here
[50:49] freedom of religion all these things and
[50:51] the biggest influences in our country
[50:53] was the church amen now I'm not saying
[50:55] that's right or wrong that's just what
[50:56] it was amen that's why our country is
[50:59] founded the way it is it's why it looked
[51:01] the way it was but that's no longer the
[51:03] case today it's no longer that we are
[51:05] the primary influence of our culture but
[51:08] our culture is the primary influence of
[51:10] churches amen most churches Orient their
[51:13] policy Orient their preaching Orient
[51:16] what they say around how to appeal to
[51:18] their culture and that's contrary to the
[51:20] word of God and I want us to understand
[51:22] today we we're blessed people to be able
[51:25] to sit here in this church and have the
[51:27] Liberty to say these things because our
[51:29] forefathers in this gospel they didn't
[51:31] have a Christian Nation with an
[51:33] agreeable government supporting them you
[51:35] could have 12 people in Ephesus and
[51:37] those people hated that eph that
[51:40] Ephesian church amen but they believe
[51:42] what they believed anyway not because it
[51:44] was pleasant to their culture not
[51:46] because it was agreeable to the populace
[51:48] but because they met God and they knew
[51:51] it was the truth no matter what politics
[51:53] no matter what government says about it
[51:55] they knew where they we're
[51:58] standing amen so we look at our country
[52:01] today now it's Hollywood It's
[52:03] Entertainment it's media it's driving
[52:05] our culture and it seeps right into
[52:06] churches and they're partakers of the
[52:08] same thing amen so we look at our
[52:10] country where it started where it's at
[52:12] today and we can blame Hollywood and we
[52:14] can blame the president we can blame one
[52:16] political party and the other but if you
[52:18] want to blame anybody blame weak
[52:20] pulpits blame Christians That Got Away
[52:23] From God that didn't stand in prayer
[52:26] stand before the Lord and repent Lord
[52:29] why did our country get this way we
[52:31] rejected the gospel we heard a message
[52:34] and we didn't want it we wanted bobhair
[52:36] women we wanted the things of the world
[52:38] right we did that yes now it's easy for
[52:42] us to sit here today well I wouldn't
[52:43] have done that it have been easy for
[52:44] Daniel to do the same
[52:46] thing but Daniel
[52:48] understood listen you see in the book of
[52:50] Nehemiah Lord we yes cuz whether we like
[52:53] it or not we're all in this together am
[52:57] amen whether we like it or not we need
[52:59] each other amen listen
[53:01] it's I was just thinking this this
[53:03] morning you know uh you know I'm trying
[53:07] to think how I can say this in a good
[53:08] way you know I I've been around a little
[53:10] bit travel a little bit and uh it's not
[53:14] easy for me personally to just trust
[53:15] everybody you meet amen I come out of
[53:18] the world and so you know it's like it's
[53:20] like the media listen if they want to
[53:22] interview you they're not doing you a
[53:23] favor amen the world's not doing you a
[53:25] favors they're trying to scam you
[53:27] they're trying to get you and
[53:28] unfortunately you see it in churches
[53:30] amen and so sometimes if we're not
[53:31] careful as Christians we get in a place
[53:34] that becomes very difficult to even
[53:36] trust one another to we we look at
[53:39] ourselves if we're not careful well this
[53:41] is the church and this is this group and
[53:43] here's me but whether we like it or not
[53:46] we're in this same boat you've got
[53:49] faults and I've got faults and you've
[53:50] got failures and I've got a pass but
[53:53] here we are this is a lot we're given
[53:55] and it may seem times that we are fools
[53:58] to trust each other but trust each other
[54:00] we must amen because at the end of the
[54:02] day we are we are bound by the same life
[54:06] of Jesus Christ yes and Daniel
[54:08] recognizes my fathers my people listen
[54:12] this is my claim to God I'm a covenant
[54:14] Jew my only claim is through these
[54:17] men right whether you and I like it or
[54:19] not people have laid a path for us and
[54:23] and and listen our C we just take this
[54:24] country for a second amen yeah there
[54:26] were men with failures and problems and
[54:28] this and that but we're here today
[54:29] because of people that paid prices and
[54:32] made sacrifices amen so we can stand
[54:35] here and believe this amen and as soon
[54:38] as we get this attitude well I'm better
[54:39] than they are that's exactly how they
[54:41] got off from where they were at true
[54:44] it's so easy for us to say well I'm not
[54:47] like that
[54:50] guy well praise the Lord
[54:53] somebody you know it's just like money
[54:56] you know you you take somebody who
[54:57] doesn't have a lot of money and they're
[54:59] like you know if I ever win the law
[55:01] they're going to make money
[55:03] but you if I ever get a bunch of money
[55:06] well I'll do this and I'll do that and
[55:08] I'll do this and
[55:09] I'll and it's easy to say that when you
[55:11] don't have the
[55:13] money and as soon as they get it they've
[55:15] gone to Disneyland they've flown a
[55:17] rocket to the moon and three months
[55:19] later they're as poor as they were
[55:20] before cuz this is what I'm getting out
[55:22] you don't know what you would do till
[55:23] you're in that situation anybody can say
[55:26] anything amen it's easy for us to look
[55:28] back in 1956 and say well I wouldn't
[55:31] have done that well by the grace of God
[55:33] you wouldn't have done it it has nothing
[55:35] to do with you and I it's not that
[55:37] you're smarter or better than the next
[55:40] person and as soon as you get the
[55:42] attitude that you are that's when you're
[55:44] in
[55:45] trouble that's what I'm getting at So
[55:47] Daniel he looks at this amen he realizes
[55:50] is in this situation and he turns to the
[55:53] Lord he acknowledges his sin and he
[55:56] begins to repent and Daniel's not
[55:58] blessed like we are today he didn't have
[56:00] this message like we have he didn't have
[56:02] a pastor he didn't have a support group
[56:04] he didn't have a a Facebook page and a
[56:07] prayer chain and a comfy church he had
[56:10] nothing but the Lord and that was enough
[56:14] he had an excellent Spirit he knew he
[56:17] heard from God he had the word of the
[56:19] Lord and he stood on that amen and when
[56:22] he wasn't allowed to pray not just
[56:24] school not even his own home
[56:27] he threw the shutters open he looked
[56:29] toward Jerusalem and he prayed as he
[56:31] always did
[56:34] before yes amen amen so I want you to
[56:37] understand no matter what happens in
[56:38] November right listen this world it's
[56:41] not my home no matter how good or bad it
[56:44] gets I'm just passing through my hopes
[56:46] are not laid up in what's going to
[56:48] happen in a couple months cuz it's
[56:49] probably going to be disappointing
[56:50] either way either way it's a
[56:52] disappointment listen listen you look at
[56:54] Solomon look at David listen we don't
[56:57] have men like George Washington and
[56:59] Abraham Lincoln you know why they
[57:01] wouldn't survive in our political
[57:03] climate you know why it's corrupt you
[57:05] know why it's corrupt because the people
[57:07] are corrupt
[57:09] amen yes amen amen I do love it you know
[57:13] I was I was I was looking at this you
[57:14] know when Daniel becomes king in Israel
[57:18] all the different tribes that gathered
[57:19] together to basically sanction him being
[57:22] placed as king and I love it because in
[57:24] 1 Chronicles the 12th chapter and this
[57:26] 32nd verse the men of isachar their
[57:28] tribe they come up to support David
[57:30] being King I love this the Bible says
[57:32] that they were men that had
[57:35] understanding of the times to know what
[57:37] Israel ought to
[57:39] do I like that they understood the time
[57:42] they were living in and it it showed
[57:44] them what they were supposed to do amen
[57:46] and I think it's important we're talking
[57:47] about understanding our Dan's message we
[57:50] understand that we are here for a reason
[57:51] today I hope we understand the message
[57:53] has not come for us to reform America
[57:56] culture the message has not come for us
[57:59] to build another America or to for us to
[58:02] evangelize the world to our Viewpoint
[58:04] it's come for a Rapture amen it's come
[58:07] to take a people off the face of the
[58:08] Earth because we're living in the days
[58:10] that Jesus said when I come back will I
[58:12] even find faith on the earth it's so
[58:14] close and it's so dark and my goal your
[58:17] goal what God has laid before us amen if
[58:19] we don't understand why we're here we
[58:22] get busy making preparations and we're
[58:24] we're building a bunker building a
[58:26] bigger this and we're we're laying out
[58:28] food to go through things listen I'm not
[58:31] praise the Lord and listen if you have a
[58:33] snowstorm with good thing you got a
[58:34] generator listen I'm not against
[58:35] preparation but we can spend so much
[58:37] time preparing politically and
[58:40] physically and materially for things and
[58:43] what we should be doing what we should
[58:44] not neglect first is to prepare our
[58:47] hearts to meet the Lord CU if we're not
[58:50] ready for that none of the rest
[58:53] matters come on brother so when you
[58:57] understand the time that you're living
[58:58] in what it's about it changes what
[59:01] you're doing amen While others are busy
[59:04] running around doing this you know I've
[59:06] I'm here for a different
[59:08] reason God's not ordained me to wrath
[59:11] but to obtain salvation through Jesus
[59:14] Christ amen there's a group of people
[59:16] that's for but I'm not one of them and
[59:18] I'm not saying that because I decided
[59:19] that I'm saying because God revealed it
[59:21] and I understand that's the purpose of
[59:23] God in my life the purpose of God in
[59:25] your life am
[59:27] amen Daniel understood amen I like that
[59:31] Ephesians chapter 5 the Bible tells us
[59:32] to redeem the time because the days are
[59:35] what they're evil that's right that's
[59:37] not going to change that's been that way
[59:39] for thousands of years now amen so it
[59:42] says wherefore be not unwise but
[59:46] understanding what the will of the Lord
[59:48] is so if you're wise you understand you
[59:51] prepare you're ready you know what to do
[59:53] amen Daniel in chapter 9 here we read
[59:55] here you know he's he's
[59:57] understood by books the words of
[59:59] Jeremiah he read in there that there
[1:00:01] were 70 years of captivity that was
[1:00:04] determined for the people and I love
[1:00:06] this amen it's now this is just as much
[1:00:08] to me as anybody else when he reads this
[1:00:10] and he realizes 70 years of captivity
[1:00:12] was determined and they're at the end of
[1:00:14] 70 years a lot of people would have
[1:00:16] stopped there praise God we've got a
[1:00:18] message captivity is almost over we're
[1:00:21] almost done a lot of guys would have
[1:00:23] went around rejoicing and being glad
[1:00:25] about that I know something you don't
[1:00:26] know I'm smarter than the guy in the
[1:00:28] other Church down the street but Daniel
[1:00:30] didn't do that amen Daniel understood
[1:00:32] this and when he did he turns his face
[1:00:35] in prayer towards God he said now that
[1:00:38] I'm seeing this I need an even greater
[1:00:41] understanding why am I seeing this amen
[1:00:45] I wonder how many times people in the
[1:00:46] message maybe they come into it maybe
[1:00:48] they raising It Whatever It Is they
[1:00:50] recognize that God has done something
[1:00:52] this day God has sent us a Vindicated
[1:00:54] word through a prophet God has revealed
[1:00:56] to us things he's brought things back
[1:00:58] together and how many times do we stop
[1:01:00] and consider but why am what's the
[1:01:04] purpose I remember as a young man when
[1:01:06] when I first come in the message and I'm
[1:01:07] looking at the seals and I'm not
[1:01:08] preaching on the seals today I don't
[1:01:10] know where but no but you know God opens
[1:01:14] these seals wh why a lot of people don't
[1:01:18] St to ask what's the purpose behind it
[1:01:20] amen now there's a purpose behind it not
[1:01:22] preach it today but you know maybe I'll
[1:01:23] put a book out or something I don't
[1:01:24] know but there's a purpose amen behind
[1:01:28] it amen it's not just there for you to
[1:01:30] say I'm smarter than the next guy I know
[1:01:32] something that somebody else doesn't
[1:01:33] know so he turns his in in prayer to God
[1:01:36] he sets his face into the Lord and
[1:01:38] here's Daniel a man with understanding
[1:01:40] already he's a man with an excellent
[1:01:42] spirit and yet he's crying out to the
[1:01:44] great and Dreadful God he says you've
[1:01:46] kept your Covenant you've showed Mercy
[1:01:50] we sinned we get hearkened to the voice
[1:01:52] of the prophets Lord please turn your
[1:01:54] anger from us God C your face to shine
[1:01:57] upon your Sanctuary which is desolate
[1:02:00] once more yeah and so it's remarkable to
[1:02:03] me because Daniel he's he understands
[1:02:05] that the time of captivity is almost
[1:02:08] over they're getting ready to to go back
[1:02:10] home they're getting ready to be
[1:02:11] delivered from bondage and we would sit
[1:02:13] there say what's he praying for then if
[1:02:14] he knows this that's exactly why he's
[1:02:17] praying all right if we're getting ready
[1:02:19] to leave captivity what does god require
[1:02:22] from me what is God showing me about my
[1:02:25] life life amen listen when God this is
[1:02:28] what I'm coming to today we're talking
[1:02:29] about the message as a as a broader
[1:02:32] point but even in our own lives right
[1:02:34] our own personal lives God shows us
[1:02:36] things sometimes amen you should be you
[1:02:38] know I've called you to do this I want
[1:02:40] you to do this God shows us things in
[1:02:41] our lives or maybe even the lives of
[1:02:43] others when he shows us things or he
[1:02:45] shows us things in this message he's not
[1:02:47] just showing it to us so we can possess
[1:02:49] a certain knowledge and feel smarter
[1:02:51] than the next person he's showing us so
[1:02:54] we will pray for understanding of his
[1:02:57] will in that situation I recognize the
[1:03:00] time I'm living in but what is your will
[1:03:02] about it for me yes maybe you're looking
[1:03:05] at a job situation or a family situation
[1:03:07] a church whatever it is amen but Lord
[1:03:09] what is your will I see where we're at I
[1:03:12] know why we're here but what is your
[1:03:14] purpose in it God what do you want me to
[1:03:16] do about it amen amen and so he's
[1:03:19] showing us many times so that we'll pray
[1:03:22] about it amen because the thing is it it
[1:03:25] doesn't do me it doesn't do me good to
[1:03:27] tell you hey brother you should do this
[1:03:29] amen you have to hear from God Amen
[1:03:32] Daniel wasn't say well I'll go down hear
[1:03:33] and I'll ask my buddies about what do
[1:03:35] they think about it what do you think
[1:03:36] about this what do you think about that
[1:03:38] he says no I want to hear from a
[1:03:40] messenger of God I want to hear and he
[1:03:42] and listen this is not the first time I
[1:03:44] love it this is not the first time that
[1:03:45] Gabriel spoken to Daniel Amen this is
[1:03:47] not a while I didn't know that was going
[1:03:49] to happen sort of a thing but Daniel has
[1:03:51] already prayed before and I want you to
[1:03:52] remember the first time he does this
[1:03:54] he's prayed for 21 days and Gabriel
[1:03:57] shows up and says listen God heard you
[1:03:59] from the
[1:04:00] first maybe right now even you're
[1:04:03] praying about certain things and you're
[1:04:04] like I I'm waiting for an answer I I
[1:04:07] need to hear from God I want you to
[1:04:09] understand God heard from the very first
[1:04:12] day amen Daniel understands as he goes
[1:04:15] into prayer again if I have to wait 21
[1:04:17] days or 21 years I know God's got an
[1:04:20] answer for me God has not showed this to
[1:04:23] me to abandon me to my my own thinking
[1:04:26] but he showed it to me to make me
[1:04:29] acknowledge that he's got more for me
[1:04:31] amen amen amen so he's showing us things
[1:04:35] Desiring we would pray the Bible says
[1:04:37] that we should pray without
[1:04:39] ceasing amen amen So Daniel seeing the
[1:04:43] Fulfillment of Prophecy this is what I'm
[1:04:45] getting it did not cause him to slack it
[1:04:47] stirred him up even more that's right we
[1:04:50] see the world falling apart it was
[1:04:52] prophesied to fall apart yes amen that
[1:04:55] shouldn't scare us we've received a
[1:04:58] kingdom which can't be
[1:05:00] removed we're on the one place that's
[1:05:03] not falling apart you're not falling
[1:05:06] apart the world's falling apart you
[1:05:07] might feel like you're falling apart but
[1:05:09] you're not falling apart you're rising
[1:05:11] up you're part of an everlasting Kingdom
[1:05:14] you've been translated out of the powers
[1:05:16] of Darkness into the kingdom of God's
[1:05:18] son amen amen praise the Lord so we see
[1:05:23] these things listen we see all this
[1:05:26] going on around us it it should not
[1:05:28] discourage us right it it would if we
[1:05:32] weren't looking at the understanding of
[1:05:34] it amen but what it does we see it
[1:05:36] happening and things look like they're
[1:05:38] worse all the time you know what even so
[1:05:41] come quickly Lord Jesus well my family
[1:05:43] this and this that listen if you've
[1:05:45] committed it to God and you've prayed
[1:05:47] listen God can change it in a
[1:05:49] moment sometimes we get fearful about
[1:05:51] the coming of the lord well but this
[1:05:53] isn't where it needs to be I want this
[1:05:55] to take place I want you to understand
[1:05:57] how many prophecies concerning Christ
[1:06:00] came to pass in the last few hours of
[1:06:01] his life amen that lost loved one that
[1:06:05] you've been praying for right now could
[1:06:07] be get saved and you wouldn't even know
[1:06:08] in five minutes from now the Rapture
[1:06:09] could take place we just don't know but
[1:06:12] don't be afraid of the coming of the
[1:06:14] Lord no matter where you're at no matter
[1:06:15] what you've looked for what you're
[1:06:17] praying for if you've committed to God
[1:06:19] you've got confidence in God then you
[1:06:21] lift your hands and say even so come
[1:06:23] quickly Lord Jesus I want nothing to
[1:06:26] hinder the coming of the Lord amen I
[1:06:29] know praise the Lord I know that God is
[1:06:32] faithful amen he is faithful amen amen
[1:06:38] we are not powerless today in the world
[1:06:41] in our situation amen we can't change
[1:06:44] every broken system in the world you're
[1:06:45] not supposed to right amen that's right
[1:06:48] amen we try to fix it all the time
[1:06:50] you're not supposed to fix it amen amen
[1:06:53] but we have received the kingdom like I
[1:06:54] said you can't save every nation but you
[1:06:57] can preach the gospel and I believe out
[1:06:59] of every nation there will be a kindred
[1:07:01] and a tongue and a nation of people that
[1:07:03] are saved amen yeah might be five over
[1:07:05] here might be 20 over here there's going
[1:07:07] to be somebody out of every Kinder
[1:07:08] tongue and Nation doesn't mean every
[1:07:10] nation as a whole is going to get saved
[1:07:11] we're not here to evangelize the whole
[1:07:13] world and they're all going to believe
[1:07:14] what we believe and we're going to be
[1:07:16] accepted and people are going to love us
[1:07:18] never going to happen amen but God's
[1:07:21] going to have a people he wherever
[1:07:23] you're at any time zone and he plac the
[1:07:26] world he's going to pluck them up amen
[1:07:29] hallelujah
[1:07:31] amen praise the
[1:07:33] Lord I believe that we're living in a
[1:07:35] time of judgment amen that fair to say
[1:07:39] Yes Sir Daniel was living in a time of
[1:07:41] judgment amen but that doesn't mean he
[1:07:43] had to live under judgment
[1:07:46] amen amen amen listen Israel when they
[1:07:49] were in Egypt it was judgment upon Egypt
[1:07:52] but not on them right amen amen so
[1:07:55] Daniel's living in a time of judgment
[1:07:57] but not he's not himself under judgment
[1:08:00] amen he might not have had a pastor he
[1:08:03] might not have had a church but God had
[1:08:05] blessed him and it's it's amazing to me
[1:08:07] God had given him a position God had Del
[1:08:09] delivered him from the mouth of lions
[1:08:11] and listen he served the Babylonians he
[1:08:14] was the master of magicians yes amen and
[1:08:18] God showed him the me and pers were
[1:08:19] going to come in and wipe out all this
[1:08:21] stuff and it's amazing to me because
[1:08:24] here he is in the courts of the king an
[1:08:26] officer there and when the me and
[1:08:28] Persians come in they wipe out the kings
[1:08:30] of Babylon they wipe out their princes
[1:08:32] they wipe out all these officials they
[1:08:34] didn't hurt Daniel that's right Daniel
[1:08:36] got
[1:08:38] promoted amen listen the changing of of
[1:08:42] leadership the changing of the regime it
[1:08:45] didn't hurt Daniel it promoted the will
[1:08:47] of God in his life amen it it didn't
[1:08:50] affect him he could watch a th fall his
[1:08:53] side he could watch 10,000 fall at his
[1:08:54] right hand but it didn't come n to him
[1:08:57] amen so I don't want you to be afraid
[1:09:00] about tomorrow or this year what it's
[1:09:02] going to bring cuz whatever happens
[1:09:04] somehow it's going to be for your
[1:09:07] good all things work together for good
[1:09:09] not for the Republican party or the
[1:09:11] Democrat Party not for Ukraine or for
[1:09:13] Russia right for them that love God to
[1:09:17] them who are the called according to his
[1:09:19] purpose no matter how bad it looks
[1:09:21] listen it's for your good amen it's
[1:09:24] going to promote you in the end amen
[1:09:26] whatever happens is going to get you out
[1:09:27] of here it's going to facilitate the
[1:09:30] changing of your body it's going to
[1:09:32] bring about the coming of the Lord
[1:09:34] listen God knows what he's doing amen
[1:09:36] all them people in Babylon ringing their
[1:09:38] hands under seeds going to get wiped out
[1:09:40] and Daniel knew this is the
[1:09:43] time Deliverance Hallelujah this is the
[1:09:46] time we're going back yeah
[1:09:50] amen so judgment upon Wicked deliver
[1:09:56] for the righteous amen we see it in the
[1:09:58] time of Noah the same Waters that
[1:10:01] destroyed the old world saved eight
[1:10:04] Souls it saved
[1:10:06] them now now this is just Me Maybe PR
[1:10:09] maybe presuming a little bit but imagine
[1:10:12] Noah and his family if things had
[1:10:14] continued on the way they did where
[1:10:16] would they been they probably been dead
[1:10:18] or something who know that was how
[1:10:19] Wicked the world was it they didn't just
[1:10:22] escape the Judgment it saved them yes
[1:10:25] amen amen amen it saved the world Amen
[1:10:29] praise the Lord amen so the coming
[1:10:31] judgment is an end in this case for
[1:10:35] Daniel for the Captivity of God's people
[1:10:37] it's Deliverance amen right this what I
[1:10:39] like you know brother man talks about
[1:10:41] this many times in the message at length
[1:10:43] you know you take Noah and he sees the
[1:10:46] day he's he has an understanding right
[1:10:48] there's a purpose behind it he begins to
[1:10:50] build an ark now today if you want to be
[1:10:53] a part of this end time message and you
[1:10:55] believe believe God you're looking for
[1:10:56] the coming of the Lord you don't build
[1:10:58] an ark to escape you do if you want to
[1:11:01] sell tickets in Kentucky that's cool
[1:11:02] that's fine nothing wrong with that but
[1:11:05] that's not how you get in the Rapture
[1:11:07] amen you know judgment's coming
[1:11:09] judgment's come before but the way that
[1:11:12] you prepare is not the same way that
[1:11:13] Noah did it's not the same way that
[1:11:15] Daniel did amen praise the Lord so Noah
[1:11:20] he looks at the season Daniel looks at
[1:11:21] the season and I I I don't know if I've
[1:11:23] preached this here before talked about
[1:11:24] but it's like I talked about years ago
[1:11:26] when Joshua and the children of Israel
[1:11:28] they they come they come up to the
[1:11:30] Jordan River amen the Bible talks about
[1:11:31] when they come to the Jordan River God
[1:11:33] has told them to go over and possess the
[1:11:34] land they've wandered for 40 years this
[1:11:36] is the time for it amen and they get to
[1:11:38] the waters and the banks of the Jordan
[1:11:40] they're
[1:11:41] overflowing amen they get there like
[1:11:44] we're going to take the land this is it
[1:11:46] whoa hold up man it's flooded let's hold
[1:11:48] up a few days not quite yet okay our
[1:11:51] timing is a little it's overflowed amen
[1:11:53] uh we can't cross the water's too high
[1:11:56] but the Bible says the waters from
[1:11:58] Jordan always overflow at the Harvest
[1:12:01] Time amen amen so other people looked
[1:12:04] and said oh no the water's too high we
[1:12:07] can't do it right now and Josh said no
[1:12:10] that's what makes it the perfect time
[1:12:13] because there's a harvest over there
[1:12:15] we're going to feed on the old corner of
[1:12:16] the land God said we're going over there
[1:12:19] the man is going to stop we're feed that
[1:12:21] food over there that they planted God
[1:12:22] laid it up for us amen I'm saying this
[1:12:25] for a reason it's the Harvest time it's
[1:12:29] the evening time it's the time for it
[1:12:31] amen and these other men they looked at
[1:12:34] the
[1:12:35] circumstances the river is too high we
[1:12:38] can't do it we can't do it right now we
[1:12:40] need to wait for a different time but
[1:12:42] Joshua was not looking at the river he
[1:12:45] was not looking at the circumstances he
[1:12:47] was looking at the season amen no this
[1:12:51] is the time for it cuz God said it's the
[1:12:53] time for it the circumstance don't
[1:12:55] matter it's what God has said amen right
[1:12:58] and the biggest mistake you and I can
[1:13:00] make yes is to look at our
[1:13:04] circumstances well the family this the
[1:13:06] the country this and the church this
[1:13:08] don't look at the circumstances cuz the
[1:13:11] circumstances will always tell you
[1:13:12] something
[1:13:13] different the very circumstances which
[1:13:16] they looked at and thought was a
[1:13:18] hindrance was the very evidence this is
[1:13:20] the time we don't want to cross in the
[1:13:22] winter we don't want to go in the spring
[1:13:24] we're going in the Harvest time we're
[1:13:26] possessing the old corn of the
[1:13:29] land
[1:13:31] amen that's right brother you take an
[1:13:34] investor
[1:13:35] amen he's looking to buy some stocks
[1:13:39] well he doesn't wait till it shoots up
[1:13:40] 500% and buys it amen it's too late he
[1:13:45] buys it when it's low cuz he
[1:13:48] forecasts it's going to go up he's not
[1:13:51] looking at what is he's looking at what
[1:13:54] it will be
[1:13:55] right so he goes and buys some Crypton
[1:13:57] and doesn't go up see he looked at the
[1:13:58] wrong thing yeah he looked with this
[1:14:00] stock here he want bought some Coca-Cola
[1:14:02] or whatever amen he should have bought
[1:14:03] some Bitcoin he should have bought some
[1:14:05] apple whatever it is amen listen Jesus
[1:14:08] himself talks about this to the Jews
[1:14:10] they could look at the weather they must
[1:14:12] had better weathermen than we
[1:14:14] got am man if weathermen were prophets
[1:14:17] we'd have stoned them I you know I can't
[1:14:20] imagine working a job where I'm right
[1:14:21] 17% of the time I get paid for it
[1:14:25] amen these men could look at the signs
[1:14:28] of the weather and know bad weather was
[1:14:30] coming but they didn't have discernment
[1:14:33] of the time no they didn't know the
[1:14:36] signs of the time true amen amen it's
[1:14:40] true so when you're looking at the
[1:14:42] season listen when that farmer goes and
[1:14:43] plants in in Spring amen he doesn't know
[1:14:48] what the weather is going to look like
[1:14:49] for the next 12 weeks but it knows the
[1:14:51] season's going to change it always does
[1:14:54] right it always works that way amen so a
[1:14:57] good farmer a good investor whatever it
[1:14:59] is they don't look at the circumstance
[1:15:02] they look at the season what's going to
[1:15:04] take place next amen yes the biggest
[1:15:08] mistake you and I can make whether it's
[1:15:10] politics Church our own lives is to look
[1:15:14] at our circumstances right amen because
[1:15:16] your circumstances will deceive
[1:15:19] you you will start looking at the wrong
[1:15:21] thing if you're looking to be
[1:15:22] discouraged you will find something to
[1:15:25] discourage
[1:15:26] you amen if you're looking for something
[1:15:28] to justify your delusional idea how
[1:15:30] you're going to get rich quick you'll
[1:15:32] find something to support your opinion
[1:15:35] yes but Daniel sees us he's like but
[1:15:38] Lord what is the season it's a season of
[1:15:41] Deliverance but why is that
[1:15:44] significant amen why does the farmer
[1:15:47] know why is it significant because it
[1:15:49] helps him to prepare for the coming
[1:15:51] season amen amen I pray God today help
[1:15:54] us each want to understand the season
[1:15:57] that we're in whether we're talking
[1:15:58] about the world we're talking about
[1:15:59] church at home whatever it is amen when
[1:16:01] he saw the season was getting ready to
[1:16:03] change Daniel Prayed and Gabriel come
[1:16:05] says you know what I've come to give you
[1:16:07] skill and understanding consider the
[1:16:11] vision think about it for a minute
[1:16:14] consider the vision you've had a people
[1:16:17] they've been captive for 70 years now
[1:16:19] God is going to visit them with another
[1:16:21] season 70 weeks it's a prophetic number
[1:16:23] 70 * 7 490 years you've got done with
[1:16:26] this season of captivity now another
[1:16:28] season's coming in and the purpose of
[1:16:30] this season is not just for another
[1:16:33] bondage but at the very last week
[1:16:36] Hallelujah the greatest season of them
[1:16:38] all amen the greatest event ever amen
[1:16:41] and the 70th week Messiah the Prince
[1:16:44] Will
[1:16:45] Come and he will be a governor he'll be
[1:16:48] a leader to his people he'll be cut off
[1:16:50] in the midst of it but he's going to
[1:16:52] come back he will fulfill the will of
[1:16:54] the Lord
[1:16:55] amen God is showing Daniel that
[1:16:59] captivity is almost over because God
[1:17:01] wants to bring Messiah on the scene
[1:17:03] that's right amen I think I've preached
[1:17:06] about it here before but these Magi
[1:17:08] these wise men 4 47 480 some years later
[1:17:13] they come to Jerusalem one day and they
[1:17:15] followed the star they saw the star
[1:17:18] because they were looking for it cuz
[1:17:19] Daniel had made
[1:17:21] Provisions not just one but two seasons
[1:17:24] prior had laid up food in due season
[1:17:26] that this is going to happen in a
[1:17:28] certain time in a certain season and
[1:17:30] we're prepared get him gifts get ready
[1:17:33] for it he's coming and when they get to
[1:17:36] Jerusalem there they are where is he
[1:17:38] that's born King of the Jews amen and
[1:17:41] they all looked at each other said what
[1:17:43] are they talking about right they didn't
[1:17:46] know anything about a star they weren't
[1:17:47] looking for his coming they were busy
[1:17:49] bickering about politics amen fighting
[1:17:51] with each other praise the Lord somebody
[1:17:54] you know what they did they went and got
[1:17:55] the scriptures out well let's look where
[1:17:56] he supposed to be born at now why didn't
[1:17:58] they do that beforehand that's they
[1:18:01] should have known that ahead of time
[1:18:03] these are religious men oh oh yeah I
[1:18:05] guess we're supposed to have a messiah

[1:18:53] daddy's prepared them and the daddy
[1:18:54] before prepared all the way back to the
[1:18:56] time of
[1:18:57] Daniel they had prepared for the moment
[1:19:01] amen listen I'm prepared for the moment

[1:19:32] could we might not get to the listen I
[1:19:35] want to live that way I'm want to live
[1:19:37] it could happen right
[1:19:39] now as I'm speaking through the back
[1:19:43] door the dead in Christ come marching in
[1:19:46] amen why would you not want to live that
[1:19:48] way amen listen I know I know people
[1:19:51] message preachers they preach well you
[1:19:54] know the Lord's not going come yet and
[1:19:55] this and that youve got a prophet on
[1:19:57] tape 60 years ago saying I'm he could
[1:20:01] come tomorrow morning right he could
[1:20:03] come right now and I'm thinking you know
[1:20:04] what it is Jesus talks about the wicked
[1:20:08] servant yeah he said my Lord delays his
[1:20:11] coming and watch he begins to beat the
[1:20:13] other servants and he becomes drunk not
[1:20:16] knowing the hour his Lord was going to
[1:20:18] return amen I don't want to be that guy
[1:20:21] that's beating the other servants yeah
[1:20:23] getting Drunk on Power an influence and
[1:20:25] money and women and popularity you don't
[1:20:27] want to be that guy cuz I believe he
[1:20:31] could be here any moment actually I
[1:20:33] believe he's here
[1:20:34] now I'm just looking for the
[1:20:36] manifestation of it but he's already
[1:20:39] here that's what made the difference for
[1:20:41] me that's what made the difference you
[1:20:43] didn't do
[1:20:45] that did you anybody want to take credit
[1:20:48] for their own Redemption didn't think so
[1:20:50] you did we can talk about it afterwards
[1:20:51] I guess I'll straighten you out
[1:20:55] I didn't save it wasn't my
[1:20:57] idea amen it wasn't your idea God
[1:21:01] revealed it to us like he did Daniel
[1:21:04] Amen God revealed this same Messiah that
[1:21:07] he showed in a forecast to Daniel we've
[1:21:11] seen it again the coming of the Lord is
[1:21:12] in our generation yes
[1:21:15] amen the son of man has spoken to us see
[1:21:18] it's one thing to know we're living in a
[1:21:19] time of judgment listen you can talk to
[1:21:22] secular people right you can at the rise
[1:21:25] of AI and the proliferation of nuclear
[1:21:27] weapons you can look at whatever
[1:21:28] circumstances you want and most people
[1:21:30] yeah it's going the wrong way it doesn't
[1:21:32] take a genius at this point to figure
[1:21:35] out the world's falling apart everybody
[1:21:36] believes that they actually use it to
[1:21:39] promote their point we're going to fix
[1:21:40] it no you're
[1:21:42] not that's the whole another sermon but
[1:21:44] let me just say this you'll never fix
[1:21:46] the problem that you got yourself into
[1:21:48] with the thinking that got you there in
[1:21:50] the first place oh our politically
[1:21:52] minded objectives and our political
[1:21:55] listen that's what made it a problem you
[1:21:58] can't fix it that way that's right
[1:22:01] listen Jesus Christ is not coming back
[1:22:04] to restore us to the original
[1:22:07] Constitution he's not interested in our
[1:22:09] form of government or anybody else's but
[1:22:12] his own amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:22:16] am Daniel sees it's a time for changeing
[1:22:22] leadership amen yeah God has ordained to
[1:22:25] change in leadership amen not just for
[1:22:27] Israel but for the whole world amen amen
[1:22:31] because of this these men that aren't
[1:22:34] even Jews they're not even Jews
[1:22:37] recognize this is the one that's King of
[1:22:40] the Jews this is the one that will rule
[1:22:42] and Reign Over the Earth and they
[1:22:43] brought him gifts that spoke of who he
[1:22:45] was amen my my men that weren't even
[1:22:48] Jews yet they had wisdom they knew what
[1:22:51] to do amen with the season they were
[1:22:53] living in amen amen so we have to know
[1:22:56] what to do amen and this is the thing
[1:22:59] like I said earlier you know sometimes
[1:23:00] you pray and you don't always know yeah
[1:23:02] now I'm probably not the first person I
[1:23:06] think we talked about this has anybody
[1:23:08] ever prayed for something and not got an
[1:23:10] answer right
[1:23:12] away few hands probably every okay

[1:23:18] okay that's that's not just you then
[1:23:22] that's every one of us brother brandom

[1:23:39] preach again let this be a message he
[1:23:40] says it's strange most strange that
[1:23:44] sometimes that God does things that way

[1:23:48] sins we've met every requirement that
[1:23:50] God requires we believed on God there's
[1:23:53] a circumstance has to be met it's
[1:23:55] according to his will we've confessed

[1:24:37] confession many times I've been there
[1:24:39] right you prayed and you prayed you've
[1:24:41] turned over every stone you've looked
[1:24:43] for an answer and yet it seems like God

[1:26:49] Bram he said but that was his time of
[1:26:51] decision yes cuz God will let you sit

[1:26:55] we like to do when we don't hear about
[1:26:58] from God what his will is we'll just
[1:27:00] kind of make it up yeah true that is so
[1:27:03] true well I think this is what God wants

[1:27:08] think I'm talking to amen let's just be
[1:27:10] real here for a second that's what we do
[1:27:13] brother B said his gift was to wait on
[1:27:14] the Lord and that's the hardest thing
[1:27:17] for us oh when the meeting's moving and
[1:27:19] it's getting hot and everybody's
[1:27:20] anointed and everybody's having a good
[1:27:21] time we're on top of the world but how
[1:27:23] many of us can beat

[1:27:38] they're wanting to see how you deal with
[1:27:42] nothing going on Amen and God's looking
[1:27:44] to see are we going to really wait on
[1:27:46] him are we really depending on him or is
[1:27:49] it just
[1:27:51] convenient amen well if I don't hear
[1:27:53] from God today

[1:27:57] up and we'll work ourselves and our
[1:27:59] imagination we'll take this little sign
[1:28:01] here and we'll we'll take our
[1:28:04] circumstances yes and we'll paint a
[1:28:06] picture true well this is what this is
[1:28:08] all about and it might not have anything
[1:28:11] to do with it

[1:28:17] purpose a season for every purpose right
[1:28:20] under Heaven amen if we're not careful

[1:28:24] the time around our Viewpoint true that
[1:28:26] doesn't work that way amen you can't
[1:28:29] Orient time around you have to orient to
[1:28:31] what the season is no farmer sits there

[1:29:08] listening if you're listening and you've
[1:29:10] done what he said amen he's going to
[1:29:14] speak amen the Bible says that they that
[1:29:17] are LED of the spirit they are the sons
[1:29:18] of God and you look at that in the Greek
[1:29:20] they're always LED amen listen you

[1:36:08] this dark cloy gloomy clouds looks
[1:36:11] stormy looks ominous looks
[1:36:13] spooky brother it's it's like one of the
[1:36:15] Magic Eye pictures brother said he got

[1:36:27] it looked scary it looked ominous when
[1:36:30] you get a little bit closer and look oh
[1:36:32] it's the blessings of the Lord yes and
[1:36:35] how many times in our own lives our
[1:36:38] biggest blessing was disguised as a
[1:36:40] trial right as something we just we
[1:36:42] couldn't get past it we're never going
[1:36:45] to make it it was the big the greatest
[1:36:47] blessing yet in our lives all your
[1:36:51] perspective amen when I got married my
[1:36:54] wife got a copy of it you've seen the

[1:36:59] the magazine you got I think it's jie
[1:37:00] Rockefeller in the next page and the
[1:37:01] moon beam stuff but the world saw that
[1:37:04] picture they didn't know what to make
[1:37:06] about it but we have a different
[1:37:08] perspective we know what season it is
[1:37:10] that means something to you and I
[1:37:12] because we understand the season that
[1:37:14] we're in you turn it this way that's our
[1:37:17] Lord up
[1:37:19] there oh my so much of our life I know
[1:37:22] this sounds a little cliche but it's
[1:37:24] true so much of our life is our attitude
[1:37:26] and our perspective towards it
[1:37:28] absolutely Daniel could have pouted he
[1:37:31] could have been discouraged he could
[1:37:33] have rung his hands in worried but he
[1:37:35] chose to look unto the Unseen he chose
[1:37:39] to look to God for understanding and
[1:37:41] when he saw what it was about he
[1:37:43] prepared himself he prepared his heart
[1:37:45] he prepared a people he prepared a
[1:37:48] nation amen
[1:37:51] yes praise the Lord
[1:37:56] B somebody asked him in questions and
[1:37:57] aners 1964 they asked him the question

[1:38:05] all hindsight is the bride going to have
[1:38:06] Miracles and things said yeah it's going
[1:38:09] on right now like the bride didn't start
[1:38:12] in 19 it's it's been going

[1:38:20] closer it's going on right now right
[1:38:23] amen it's it's it's amazing to me now
[1:38:26] now again it's just perspective I guess

[1:38:31] waiting for this listen I see Miracles
[1:38:33] all the time I'm not just making I mean
[1:38:35] I've I've seen blinded eyes I've seen
[1:38:37] all kinds of things amen I'm not saying
[1:38:39] that to me whatever I'm saying it
[1:38:40] depends on what you're looking at if
[1:38:43] you're looking for a defeated attitude
[1:38:45] that's what you'll find but if you have
[1:38:47] an expectation for the coming Lord you
[1:38:49] have an expectation for the move of God

[1:38:59] you see yeah amen if you expect great

[1:46:23] we know some of what it
[1:46:25] says but no matter what happened in this
[1:46:28] election back here this one coming up or
[1:46:30] politics or economy that's probably not
[1:46:32] what we're going to think about no when
[1:46:34] we make it over amen right man I
[1:46:37] remember that time the the Knicks lost
[1:46:39] that game we're not g to care about
[1:46:42] that who won the Super Bowl who did
[1:46:45] praise the Lord Ohio State Michigan
[1:46:47] maybe we'll lose again praise God that's
[1:46:50] okay cuz I'm I'm not on the team anymore
[1:46:53] way wearing my wearing my Michigan
[1:46:55] colors again I've come I've come for
[1:47:00] peace but you know what you might
[1:47:02] remember that kind word that somebody
[1:47:03] said to you when you were at your lowest
[1:47:06] point when you wanted to give up and
[1:47:08] somebody said something to you and
[1:47:09] encourage you that that's something that
[1:47:11] will last for eternity what you said to
[1:47:13] somebody else brother B said your
[1:47:17] attitude towards others can affect the
[1:47:18] Eternal destination of others think
[1:47:21] about that that's so much more power
[1:47:24] than the executive branch or the
[1:47:27] military a word just a kind word some of
[1:47:32] the some of the greatest things I've
[1:47:33] ever seen listen I've I've preached I've
[1:47:35] had the privilege of preaching sermons
[1:47:37] all kinds of different places in the
[1:47:38] world Amen I thank God for that I
[1:47:40] believe in preaching that's why we're
[1:47:41] doing this but sometimes the thing you
[1:47:44] remember most is that one person one
[1:47:45] time when you're at your lowest point
[1:47:47] and they just come say you know thank
[1:47:48] you so much I see what you do I see what
[1:47:50] you do for people it means something to
[1:47:52] me means something that'll stick with
[1:47:54] them the rest of their lives and we
[1:47:56] underestimate that am and that's real
[1:47:59] power amen Comfort one another with
[1:48:01] those we don't even recognize it amen
[1:48:04] but it means something over there amen
[1:48:07] our perspective is so skewed by the
[1:48:11] world that we live in what's what's
[1:48:13] really great brother mam said a great
[1:48:16] man makes you feel great that's why
[1:48:20] that's why I had you clap for yourself
[1:48:21] feel good about it great man makes you
[1:48:23] feel great amen I believe that's how the
[1:48:25] prophet was I believe how Jesus was
[1:48:28] listen Jesus could go to the lowest
[1:48:31] people and not make them feel lower and
[1:48:34] if anybody had the ability to do that it
[1:48:36] would have been him if anybody had a
[1:48:39] right to go to a woman caught in the act
[1:48:42] of adultery and put her down wa he
[1:48:46] without sin cast the first stone that's
[1:48:48] him he had the right did but when they
[1:48:51] all up said where's your
[1:48:53] accusers neither do I condemn the go and
[1:48:56] sin no more
[1:48:58] Hallelujah man we you just forgive me we
[1:49:02] we me we so underestimate that take it
[1:49:07] for granted power of a Kind word a word
[1:49:10] spoken in season can change a life can
[1:49:14] change a
[1:49:16] destination amen God now I'm going off
[1:49:20] the rails here for a second I've had the
[1:49:22] privilege
[1:49:24] preaching funerals too I've been to many
[1:49:25] funerals not so much a privilege but
[1:49:27] it's part of life you go to funerals and
[1:49:30] hopefully this isn't you but if it is
[1:49:31] you know if the shoe fits you go to a
[1:49:33] funeral and sometimes you got people
[1:49:35] there and like you know God bless you
[1:49:37] we're praying for you sorry and then
[1:49:39] there's people that have understanding
[1:49:42] they know more than everybody else
[1:49:44] they've got knowledge and they share
[1:49:46] with you well this is why this happened
[1:49:47] and you know how people are people say
[1:49:50] some of the dumbest things at funerals

[1:50:14] better help me out

[1:51:48] doubt he looked at the circumstances he
[1:51:49] got discouraged he got fearful but Jesus

[1:56:05] just it's what the best for people amen

[1:56:21] was always the best for
[1:56:22] us God's always been merciful to us he's
[1:56:26] been so gracious to
[1:56:28] us I would have
[1:56:30] fainted if I had not believed to see the
[1:56:33] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[1:56:35] living
[1:56:37] amen I've got two
[1:56:40] stalkers I know that seems odd because
[1:56:41] I'm not that famous I've got two
[1:56:42] stalkers goodness and mercy they've
[1:56:45] followed me all the days of my life
[1:56:47] didn't realize it at first but they've
[1:56:48] been following
[1:56:49] me goodness and mercy Mercy when I
[1:56:52] wasn't looking for them when I wasn't
[1:56:53] after them they followed me all days of
[1:56:57] my aren't you so grateful for that am we
[1:57:00] are such a blessed people let's just
[1:57:02] let's just bow our heads once again
[1:57:04] Lord today as we look towards the events
[1:57:08] on the
[1:57:09] horizon we've been gifted by a prophetic
[1:57:11] voice in this age by the word of the
[1:57:14] Lord to to rise above the storms and all
[1:57:16] the clouds and to seea Beyond even the
[1:57:19] very curtain of
[1:57:21] time to a people that are
[1:57:24] waiting they've been
[1:57:27] reserved to obtain
[1:57:29] salvation under their Messengers under
[1:57:31] their days that your people will be
[1:57:33] gathered together in
[1:57:35] one to come back and Rule and Reign on
[1:57:37] this Earth Lord today it doesn't seem a
[1:57:40] fit place to rule
[1:57:41] over it certainly doesn't seem a fit
[1:57:43] place to hardly even live
[1:57:45] in but we know that the coming of the
[1:57:47] Lord will change all these things your
[1:57:50] Prophet said you right in every wrong
[1:57:52] and we believe that Lord that might not
[1:57:55] be this day
[1:57:56] today it may be it might be another day
[1:57:59] but no matter what it is Lord It's not a
[1:58:01] question of if but when amen and so may
[1:58:06] we in our light afflictions here
[1:58:09] remember that these things are not
[1:58:11] worthy to be compared to the glory which
[1:58:14] shall be revealed in
[1:58:17] US Lord that we've been
[1:58:19] ordained Lord does not appear to the
[1:58:22] world what shall be but we are the sons
[1:58:25] and daughters of
[1:58:27] God remade reborn in your likeness
[1:58:31] fashioned after your
[1:58:33] image reformed in your
[1:58:36] righteousness Lord I pray
[1:58:39] today for each one of us may we be
[1:58:42] mindful Lord if we would be mindful of a
[1:58:44] drop or two of your precious blood in a
[1:58:46] jar and a little charger how he would
[1:58:49] cherish that how he would preserve it
[1:58:51] how it would be dear to us yet today we
[1:58:53] stand here each one of us the very thing
[1:58:56] which that blood
[1:58:58] purchased the very thing which you you
[1:59:01] gave your life for Lord may we be ever
[1:59:04] so mindful of it may we be kind to one
[1:59:07] another kind to
[1:59:09] ourselves knowing that you thought we
[1:59:11] were worth
[1:59:14] it Lord
[1:59:17] you're you're so much better to us Lord
[1:59:20] than we could ever deserve you're the
[1:59:22] friend that sticks closer than a
[1:59:24] brother Lord we are so thankful today
[1:59:27] Lord I just commit these people into
[1:59:28] your hands Lord no doubt many situations
[1:59:30] that I am ignorant
[1:59:32] of different ones going through
[1:59:34] different
[1:59:35] things but may their hearts be stirred
[1:59:38] and
[1:59:39] reminded that it's all worth it in the
[1:59:42] end May our hearts be prepared always
[1:59:45] for the coming of the Lord not just
[1:59:47] getting ready but being ready knowing
[1:59:50] that the time is short the enemy the
[1:59:52] enemy recognizes his time is short the
[1:59:55] scripture declares he knows he has a
[1:59:57] short
