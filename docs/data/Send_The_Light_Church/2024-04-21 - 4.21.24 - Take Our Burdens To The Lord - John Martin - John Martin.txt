there we have to make sure we're out of the flesh we're in the spirit and then we can walk in love and peace and joy and all that God has for us amen amen amen we have a a few things to to say but I thought maybe we could just um have a little word of prayer we'll read the scriptures and then have you be seated amen let's look to god father we thank you that we could come this morning into your house amen and to Worship You the King of Kings and the Lord of lords father we want to thank you for your presence here to thank you Lord for you coming with each one of us into this place and then Lord you said that you inhabit the Praises of your Saints so we we feel you even more Lord pray Lord that as your word comes and and is broken to us that we would feel you even more that it would just continue to build and build in our hearts our souls that you just set us a fire for you father we thank you for your great love where with you loved us we didn't know you and then when we did hear about you Lord we fought against you and we didn't want you but Lord you kept loving us and you loved us right into a relationship that we cannot get away yes amen Hallelujah we thank you for that great love nothing can separate us from the love of God father we just ask that you take the the furtherance of this service Lord break the bread of life to us prepare us for this word encourage us through this word Lord help us to remember you when we leave this Sanctuary father we commit the service into your hands thank you now for your blessings in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen and turn with me if you would to First Peter uh chapter 5 and I'm like to start reading in verse number five if I could verse number five First Peter chapter 5 verse 5 the Bible says likewise ye younger submit yourself unto the Elder but it doesn't stop there it says all yay all of you be subject one to another in fact just put clothes of humility on for God resists any kind of Pride and he gives grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in in due time casting all your care upon him for he carth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a Roy and lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in India amen all over the world Amen God bless you may be seated may God just add the blessings to this precious word just hearing um Brother Bruce talk about the 7in diameter hail I I read that they found an 8 in in central Dakota and it weighed almost two lounds wow so when we read there in Revelations chapter 16 we see that part of the plague that's coming upon the Earth because the people rejected God that's right that these will weigh between some say 70 and some say 125 lbs now 8 in is 2 PBS God's judgment is going to be great amen and and um um they they say this by the time it hit the earth it was going 350 M an hour imagine what a 50 pounder or 100 pounder is going to be flying I think this is the hour to be as serious with God as you possibly can because I I look it like this that God has given us opportunity to to serve him with all of our heart and we know the the devil is constantly working with us to just try to get us to be lukewarm to relax that everything's taken care of but in reality we it's important for us to ask God lord is there anything else I should be doing it just it just has to go through three more agency like that amen uh brother uh bill had called uh a little bit ago uh a week or two ago honestly and uh had thanked us all for his prayers they could not find any cancer you know in his body and I I I had I thought that that that that got announced and um if it did wonderful and we we just want to continue to thank the Lord for his grace for um and he wants to thank everybody for your prayers for him and sisters who also they her cancer is was gone so we can just uh um uh put that on the praise uh the praise list the worship list the Thanksgiving list amen because we need to give thanks unto the Lord amen amen um we do have uh some uh some pictures here a couple videos from a brother Tim michon and he went on a mission trip to a village in Ghana West Africa called gmany and we just want to show these he sent this this morning [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is that [Applause] [Music] beautiful all right then we got the Sunday School it looks like coming next I just thought it was awesome I want to I want to show these this [Applause] [Music] morning amen God in habits the Praises of his people [Music] [Applause] amen then we got uh some pictures from from India from uh brother Samson Shady who uh has these three pastors that uh needed Bibles to distribute uh to the people and the church had helped also uh with this so I just wanted to show those pictures kind of kind of uh quick he's just uh sharing the Bibles with these pastors and then they go out and share them with others amen amen just appreciate the work of the Lord uh continuing amen amen and it's just good to be a a part of what God is doing especially knowing the hail is coming right knowing judgment's coming we want to get as many souls in as possible amen well this morning we want to take a look at uh verse number number uh seven there casting all your care upon him for he carth for you amen now we have an outlet we have a pressure relief valve as it were uh the Bible says a way of escape the Bible also says a friend that Sith closer than a brother God wants us to take our troubles to him and just to cast all of our problems on him now this is a hard thing to do but we need to learn to do it uh and and a lot of times you know we want to tell God something but then we don't leave it there it's almost like we come to him and kind of complain about the situation and then we just we take it back and we just live with it and that's not casting Casting means throwing it and just don't go back and pick it up but just just leave it right there now Galatians 6 tells us that every man has the responsibility to bear his own burden and not only that Galatians 62 says that every man uh shall bear one another's burden so now we we got a responsibility of bearing our own burden we got the responsibility of bearing one another's burden and how do we do that that means we take the things that are in our life and throw them at Jesus's feet this is is how you truly bear a burden is when you can trust God for what's going on Amen and perhaps there's there's a revelation in it but I'll say Jesus has got big shoulders as the song we used to sing in Sunday school He's Got The Whole World in His Hands he's got the whole world and I we just need to trust him for that amen he doesn't need our help to make sure the hell comes down just right hits the right person the right time we serve a mighty God a big God Amen Bible says that we need to Humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt Us in Du time I would like to read some promises but I'm going to tell you the reason the promises are here we find in uh 2 Peter 1:3 it says according as his divine power has given unto you and I all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us great and precious promises the promises are not plaques that we put on a wall these promises have a purpose that by these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption having escape the hail that is in this world through lust we're going to escape the now corruption the Judgment that's coming it's through the promises of God I just want to take a look at some of these Proverbs first one is Proverbs 3:5 it says trust in the Lord with all thine heart amen and at the same time lean not to your own understanding don't say you're trusting in the Lord but you're leaning a little bit to your own understanding don't it just doesn't work in all your ways acknowledge Him and He will direct your paths be not wise in your own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil in other words it is evil to trust in yourself it is evil to lean to your own understanding we don't realize it's an evil thing I I know it's hard to to grasp at but but look it'll take us down a man has to do nothing he's heading straight to hell with his own understanding there's a way that seeth right right unto man but the end is the way of death so the best thing to do is trust the Lord well I don't see how he's going to do it that doesn't matter that's not what trust is our children when they were two two and three years old and when they were at a point where they could understand mom or dad want you to do this they didn't always understand but they they had to trust you I I mean it was hard for them to trust you at times when they said they you told them you were going to get them some ice cream you ever tell your children something you promised them and then you forgot you know what I'm talking about that's Humanity but God doesn't forget his promises God doesn't forget Psalms 37:3 trust in the Lord 373 trust in the Lord and do good so shall thou dwell in the land and verely thou shalt be fed now look at this promise Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give you the desires of your heart delight yourself in the lord well I don't got time how do you delight yourself in the lord well the best way I can tell you is when you were trying to attract somebody your your your your husband or your wife and you're trying to attract them you put a lot of effort and trying to get their attention you delighted yourself well you just can't come to church and just whatever I'm here delight yourself in the Lord if you want the desires of your heart you've got to put God first amen commit thy way unto the Lord commit it trust him trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass what precious promises Psalm 17:7 show thy marvelous loving kindness oh thou that savest by the right hand them who is he saving them that put their trust in thee you want God to save you put your trust in him amen from those that rise up against them keep me as the apple of the of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy Wings Psalms 18: 29 for by Thee I have run through a troop and by my God I have leaped over a wall now youut tell that's pretty strong right to run through a troop of soldiers and to leap over a wall when they're struggling to get over it as as for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord is tried he is a buckler that means a protector to all those that go to church read the Bible pay the ties know that he's a mighty God look the children of Israel saw a mighty deliverer but they still didn't trust him trust is a powerful thing we must trust the word of the Lord that tells us what God wants us to do all right Psalms 37 verse 37 Mark the perfect man is anybody in here Nam Mark he's a perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace something about peace that God looks at as being perfect a perfect quality in a man but the transgressors shall be destroyed the end of the wicked shall be cut off but the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble we all want God the most when we're in trouble don't we well here's a promise and the Lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them why you read that because they trust in him amen without this very important ingredient called trust we don't get the benefits that God wants to give us and it isn't because God doesn't love us it isn't because he doesn't care but it demoralizes God when you don't trust him he that cometh to God must believe that he is he is what he is he is what he says he is and that he's a rewarder to them that diligently seek him now without trust it's impossible to please God trust are what actually activates God's promises in our behalf you trust God he moves you doubt God you're on your own so the best thing we can do is take our burdens to the Lord and trust him all right turn with me to Daniel chapter 3 Daniel chapter 3 and we're going to kind of go through this we started a little bit late today just so you understand don't forget that mainly at the end I want you to remember that when you're getting the thoughts of you know shouldn't it be over by now all right we most of us know the story about the three Hebrew children I want to start with verse one and kind of go through this quickly Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold and then verse two he gathered together all the princes and the governors and the captains and the judges treasurers counselors sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to come uh to the dedication of this great image he made of gold and and he said it that he had set up and in verse three the princes and the governors they all came and gathered them onto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up then a Herald cried aloud to you it is commanded oh people Nations and languages that all that what that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet the flute the harp the satbt the the Sury the damer and all kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and who so F not down in worship shall the in shall the same hour be cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore at the time when all the people heard the psalm of the Cornet flute all the musical instruments all the people Nations and the languages fell down and worshiped the golden image of Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up wherefore at that time certain Chans came near and accused the Jews they spake and said unto the Nebuchadnezzar oh King Live Forever The King uh oh thou oh King has made a decree that every man shall when they hear the sound of the instruments uh that they should fall down and and and worship the golden image and who so fth not down in worship that he should be cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace and there are certain Jews whom thou has set over the Affairs of the provinces of Babylon Shadrach meach and abedo these men O King have not regarded thee they serve not thy Gods nor worship the golden image with which thou has set up and then Nebuchadnezzar in his ragion in his Fury he commanded uh to bring Shadrach mhach and abedo that they and they brought the men before the king and Nebuchadnezzar spake unto them is it true oh shedra meach and ab abedo do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I I have set up no if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet flute Harps hatb saltry and damer and all kinds of music ye Fall Down and Worship the image which I made well but if ye worship not he shall be cast the same hour into the midst of the burning fiery furnace who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands I think it's important to know our God Amen because there is a God out there that the only thing that can beat him is God and everybody don't know God that's why we're throw up the Lifeboat why we're to go out because they will get destroyed if they don't know God verse 16 Shadrach mhach and Abednego answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee we are not anxious we're not fearful we're not confused about this situation we're not careful to answer thee in this man we don't need to have a huddle what are we going to say how are we going to how are we going to approach this if it be so our God whom we serve from our heart he's able to Deliver Us from the fiery uh from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not be it known unto thee O King that we have made up our mind we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image with th which thou has set up then was neb Nebuchadnezzar's Pride set on fire full of Fury and the form of his vision was changed against Shadrach Meshach and abedo therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was already heated and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind shed R me sh and abedo and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace and these men were bound uh these then these men were Bound in their coats their Hol in their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the king commanded uh commandment was urgent and the furnace exceedingly hot the Flames of The Fly here they came out of the door and slew the men that actually took shadra mesach and abedo I mean there and the men that were doing that died they died that's how hot it was so this was a real furnace real Heat um and these three men shadat mhach and abedo fell down into the midst of the burning fiery furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the King was as stoned and Rose up in haste and spake and said unto the counselors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the king true oh King and he answered and said lo I see four men they're loose they're walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth one is like the Son of God now the men that threw shedrach mhach and abedo in there they did not trust God in fact if you look at history they bowed before the golden image because you know I'll just say it like this the devil wants to manipulate us but God's children will not be manipulated not by man not by this world not by the devil we have chosen through fre more agency to serve God and God alone then nebuchad nessar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spake and said Shadrach mesach and abedo ye Servants of the most high God come forth come hither then Shadrach mhach and abedo uh came forth of the midst of the fire now now can you imagine I wonder what would have happened if Jesus would have came at that time the fourth like the son I wonder what would have happened he would have came forth out of there and the prince and the governors and the captains and the King's counselors being gathered together saw these men who uh upon look at this whose bodies the fire had no power nor was the hair of their head head singed neither were their Cults changed now look at this nor the smell of the fire had passed on them they were completely not touched then NE Nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god of shad mesch and abedo who have set his angels and delivered his servants that trusted in him that amazing word that makes all the difference in a Christian's life that one word can make you prosperous that that one word can just turn your life 180 degrees and changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve and worship any God except their own God therefore I make a decree that every people Nations and language which spake anything a Miss against the god of shadat mhach and Abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made to dungill because there is no other God that can deliver after this sord amen H this is more than a story it's more than a Sunday School Story it is a reality for the believer now this King he represents the devil and I I I I don't want to get into this is typed in a couple different ways but I want to type it to you and me today to the to the believer the three Hebrews represent you Body Soul and Spirit and sometimes times we will get plagued and we will go through a furnace and be afflicted in our bodies sometimes in our Spirits sometimes our souls the furnace is the trials that we go through the unbearable trials is when it's seven times hotter than what You' seen you've ever gone through before the men that throw uh that threw the Hebrews in there typed as uncontrollable circumstances you just kind of get thrown into it are you with me amen and the fourth in the furnace is Christ with you in your trials now for the most part we'll probably never be literally thrown into a furnace of fire there have been but we probably will probably die without that happening but there will be many spiritual furnaces with spiritual fires that we we will be thrown into and when it happens will Christ be there or will he be on the outside of the Furnace it'll be up to you it'll be up to whether you're trusting him or not trusting him I've been in trials that I didn't see God I didn't trust God and I was alone and I've been in Trials where I trusted God and I did not see him and there is a huge difference a huge difference on the outcome because God cannot honor my doubt just because I'm his child just because I'm his light just because I'm his bride just because I believe it doesn't mean he's going to honor me he honors those that trust him so when we go through there will you remain untouched like these Hebrews or will you be consumed because of the situation will you trust him or will you be leaning to your own understanding that's the difference it's a choice that has to be made First Peter chapter 4:12 says beloved thinketh not strange the fiery trials which is designed predetermined to try you as though some strange thing happened to you how many times you go through a trial and say this is strange I shouldn't be going through this thing God allows trials in our life to test us whether we're going to trust him or not trust him amen now am I saying that God is the one that causes all the trials that's not what I'm saying what I am saying is God does allow it and he wants to see if you're going to trust him in that trial and if you do you will see God there by faith and if you if you can't because you're leaning to your own understanding because that seems to be big problem you won't see God by Faith 1 Peter chap 1:7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ amen now look at this whom having not seen you love though now you see him not though you see him not yet believing you can actually Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory Glory right in the middle of your trial without seeing them because you love him and because you believe you can rejoice in your trial knowing that the son of man is right there with you receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls now these three Hebrews they didn't have they didn't necessarily do anything wrong but they still had a choice to make to either humble themselves trust in the Lord or to lean to their own understanding and tell them you know I don't have to bow before you who do you think you are you are not the god of creation you know a lot of times we want to lean to our own understanding and prove that what we're how we're standing is the right way and what we really need to do is just humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God trust him in the middle of your trial right because he's deliverer not you not your wisdom not what you know God is the deliver he's not going to share his glory with us humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he carth for you just throw it upon him be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a royan lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world what are some ways that Believers can become devoured obviously when we're walking in our flesh when we're being arrogant or or proud We got a proud Spirit maybe being hateful towards somebody not not prayed up maybe just Desiring our own will you put yourself in a very weak position and you can become devoured by the enemy when you're in that state of mind are you with me Galatians 5:15 says but if you bite and devour one another take he that ye be not consumed one of another you know that word consumed this is the only time it's used in the New Testament is right here how what really happens when we're taking bites out of one another little sarcastic marks little hateful things little resent what you're doing is you're killing one another you're devouring one another and what is the answer to take care of this problem Paul says this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh walk in the Holy Ghost and you will not devour one another walk in the spirit and you will not lean to your own understanding you will not put confidence in your flesh John I thought it was the devil that's walking around seeking whom he may devour and not a person it really is the devil but he's also walking with those looking for a vessel to use you know the devil can't do anything to US unless he's got a vessel to use and sometimes we become a uned vessel to him because the devil outsmarts us and he thinks he can get us to know more than the other person in the situation look either we're going to trust God or we're going to lean to our own understanding and handle it oursel that the devil is always looking for opportunity in our mind in our mouth to devour sometimes devour ourselves sometimes devour others now another way to be devoured by our adversary is being so spiritually weak that we're struggling to trust in God to be at a place where I can't trust God for my situation that's a a an open door to be devoured by the enemy it's a sure way to be bothered upset angry confused and God wants us to be confident just like the three Hebrews were confident I don't need to talk about this I I don't I don't need any any help my decision is made I know where I'm standing I believe God wants us to always humble ourselves under the mighty word of God Amen and the word says that he cares about us he cares about our situation he wants us to just cast it on him and leave it I I know it seems very like this doesn't seem right how is this going to fix anything but you know it does it fixes it and it's the same thing for every situation physically spiritually emotionally financially I don't care what it is cast your cares upon Him He cares for you he's going to take care of you it's his promise it's better to Humble ourselves and just trust God than to lean to our own understanding so when we're thrown into the fiery furnace of our trials here's some questions for us will Christ be there or will he be a distant thought because you're trying to figure out what to do will he want you will you want to contact somebody or will you want to have a talk with Jesus will you have trust or will you lean to your own understanding will he be your shield and buckle or will you be burnt up with Stress and Anxiety will you be filled with the spirit or will you be found wanting in the balance will you be lacking him needing more trust Psalms 20 says some trust in chariots some in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord Our God Amen you take sides we can talk about the situation or we can give praise to God for taking care of the situation the Bible says it's better to trust in the Lord than to put your confidence in man it's better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes that's that's the that's the the pentacle of men right the princes Jesus gave us Good Counsel how many wants some counseling from Jesus today am amen Revelations 3: 18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold that's been tried in the fire amen that thou mayest be rich in the white rment that thou mayest be clothed shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesa that thou mayest see we can say that God has been there and done thaten that he can handle whatever the devil throws at him he could handle anything that his Heavenly Father asked him to do no matter how much it went against the flesh right he was tried in the hottest fire that could be tried and he came out the same yesterday today and forever amen his hand he was he was offered popularity offered Fame he was offered everything this world could give him he had free will he could have took it he could have escaped Calvary he could have called for 12 Legions of angels as for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord is tried this word is not lacking I am lacking our spouse is lacking our boss is lacking we're lacking the word of God is Not lacking right trust in the word great benefits by just trusting in the word now God doesn't want us to lean to our own understand that the typical thing we do when we go through a trial but he wants us to get desperate for more Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is the only thing that can really handle it he's going to shake heaven and earth and the only thing that's going to remain is that that's attached to God now we need to get desperate for more of the Holy Ghost and Jesus said I counsel thee my advice to you is to buy of me gold tried in the fire to buy of me to buy of God that's kind of a kind of a a strange way of saying it but if you want to buy a a share of something that means you're part owner with it right we we have uh we own part of a so we're able to to get raw milk the only way we could get it is to actually own it so we we have a share of a cow I've never seen it before but I've been drinking the fruit thereof some of us have have bought a share of a vacation home well you can have a share of Christ Jesus said buy of me a share not a CH church not a man-made religion not a form of godliness not some thought but by of me the real genuine God Romans 8:16 says the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children than heirs Heirs of God look at joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified with him yes we're going to suffer the whole world suffering I'd rather suffer with with with Jesus than suffer on my own now Jesus when he told his disciples that he was going away that he was going to return in the form of the Holy Ghost and he was going to abide with each one of them this is the same Jesus that was walking with him but now in the form of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost could not come at the same time that Jesus was on Earth we know that because the fullness of the God had dwelt in Jesus all of God was in Jesus John 14:16 he said and I will pray that the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever forever not from uh Mountaintop to Mountaintop he'll be with you when you go through the valleys even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and it shall be in you amen I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you I will would rather be in the trial with the Holy Ghost than not to have any trials not have the Holy Ghost because there is just some there is just something about the presence of God in your life it it's a real thing the holy ghost is real I think the problem is is too many people try to be a Christian without the Holy Ghost I think that is absolutely the biggest problem we have and that that to me is nothing but a religion God is real it's worth us taking the time and seeking for more of the Holy Ghost how many want more of the Holy Ghost amen now we can just cast the cares upon him because he's going to be with us he's going to comfort us he's going to help us in our trials doesn't matter what trial that we're going through if the Holy Ghost inside of us he can handle it because he asks us to buy of him gold tried in the fire he can handle it John 15:7 says if you abide in me and my words abide in you then you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you right see there's an abiding that has to take place you have to get the word inside of you there has to be some sort of interest desire hunger and thirst to read the Bible to get the word inside because if the word don't get inside how are you going to be able to speak amen did you ever try doing something without God it it just doesn't work out very good does it we've all had we've all had it we and still from time to time we try to do it Jesus said in John 155 for without me you can do nothing right without me you can do nothing right amen Philippians 4:13 says but with me you can do all things so the key is get God in the inside right with or without him with him will overcome without him we will get burned up in our trials we will get consumed we will get so filled with anxiety uh depression will leave us depressed uh we'll get filled with confusion we'll be get filled wonder where is God why am I going through this all because we decided to not trust him God wants us to trust him if you abide in me see that word if if you abide in me and my word abide in you then ask what you will and it shall be done unto you it's a conditional promise conditional promise how many want more Holy Ghost all right turn with me to Matthew chapter 25 we need to get desperate for this there was a group of church people a big group of people who thought if went to church they try to live right in their home they they didn't try to do harm to anybody they paid their tithe gave offerings did nice things for people that God would see them because God loves them and that they would still they would still be okay but you're not going to make it through the furnace without the Holy Ghost Matthew 25 says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto the 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish and they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them that oil represents the Holy Ghost now but the wise they took the Holy Ghost in their vessels with their lamps and while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there came a cry uh was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all the virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolers said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps have gone out so they had a little bit of oil they might have had justification some might have even been Sanctified but their but their lamps went out because they did not think it was that that important to come to the Altar and seek more of the Holy Ghost I could just do it in my home brother John well why aren't we we ought to be so filled with I can't wait to get the church come on but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but look at the advice that the wise gave but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourself we got to come to God and buy him by the Holy Ghost brother John you are like starting some weird Doctrine I never heard of why while they got serious about getting more of God their bridegroom came and they that were ready went in and the marriage of the door was shut afterwards came the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us we're not ready yet but he answered and said verily verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for you know not the day or the hour when the son of man cometh now we need the Holy Ghost to be ready and even the wise virgins were telling the foolish virgins who did not have the Holy Ghost that you need to get oil you need to go to God and you need to buy it yourself now how do I buy the Holy Ghost Isaiah 55 let's turn there Isaiah 55 verse one it'll be right up on the board whole everyone that is thirsty come to the waters and he that have no money Come Ye and buy and eat yay come and buy wine and milk without money and without price why do you spend money for that which is not and labor for that which satisfieth not Haren diligently unto me and eat that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in fatness incline your ear and come unto me and hear and your soul shall live and I will make you an Everlasting Covenant even the sure mercies of David now when we're seeking the Holy Ghost for our lives we're not we're actually seeking the life and nature of God that's what we're doing when we're seeking the Holy Ghost we're not seeking some feelings some emotion some tingling we're seeking God 's nature we're seeking God's life and the thing that we must remember is that God's nature and God's life cannot coexist inside of us with Satan's nature and Satan's life so the only way to buy the Holy Ghost to buy by God is to give up your will you give up your will for God's will amen you give up your life you surrender you for you forfeit you deny yourself and you take God's amen because there's no Co coexistence with God Jesus said no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one in and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and manmen you have to give up you want more of God give up yourself yeah you know a lot of people they don't get the Holy Ghost is because they still try to hold on to their own life and still seek God right just become lovers of uh Pleasures more than lovers of God but God has called us to get oil in our lamp to take us through because that oil is where we're able to cast our cares upon Him to trust him in the middle of our trials you know we can come here and sing songs we can talk to our our favorite person that the one that encourages us the one that helps us but honestly you got about to stand alone in the trial and know that God is with you amen and I would not give I would I would give up everything before I'd ever give up that I love my family but I would never give up this relationship that I have with God has showed me over and over how much real he is and I'll tell you we we talk about it I really believe nothing can separate us from the love of God I really really believe that I have failed him so miserably I shouldn't be standing here today but yet he loves me how could I not trust him how could I not just lay everything at his feet and say God for whatever reason you're putting me through this for whatever reason you've allowed this I want to stay true to you I'm not going to bow down I'm not going to bow down to my own understanding not going to bow down to trusting myself I'm not I'm not going to throw my problems at somebody else's feet not going to throw my problems onto somebody else I have a relationship with God I'm GNA throw him at his feet I'm going to trust him I'm GNA you know what I am going to see him in the fiery furnace of my trials how am I going to see him by faith brother Dennis I won't see him with these eyes but I'll see him by faith amen I love them I haven't seen them but I love them how can you love some you haven't seen so an invisible relationship is what it is so we're buying god without money without price we're giving him our life for his John 7:37 in the last days that great great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if a man thirst let him come unto me and drink and he that believeth on me as the scripture said out of his belly shall flow Rivers not droplets right not just done then we got to wait three months no no he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you rivers of Living Water and they don't stop they don't stop now we can plug them up we can plug them up with selfishness we can plug them up with how like to try some things of the world but I'll tell you what God doesn't stop it it's an artisian well now this living water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him they that trust him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified right God I I love this because this is actually a 45 minute sermon I didn't stop start the quarter two and it's like 11:30 and I'm done I'm just like so happy I did it's hard to trust God when God's not there in your heart and mind but if we spend time seeking the Holy Ghost why we're not in our trials with our free time you know what you're doing when you got free time I know you think I don't have any free time that's a bunch of baloney when you take the time that you have and you're seeking God you know what you're doing you're telling God with your life I love you and he remembers every time that you seek him the Bible says he's a rewarder to them that diligently seek him that when you go through a trial and you know oh wow I'm facing something I I don't know why I'm facing this I have a choice here I am going to trust God in this trial and you you start trusting God in that trial and as you're walking into the the furnace of that trial it gets hotter and hotter and you're tempted well maybe maybe maybe maybe he's not with me but if you keep walking not my will thy will be done right he remembers when you were seeking him he will be right there to show you he is with you amen now that's more important than the outcome of that trial it's it's more important than getting out of this mess Jesus never got out of the mess the disciples didn't get out of the mess Paul saw didn't give his heart to Christ and get out of the mess yes we're going to suffer but I want to suffer with him am and and and God promised to deliver us and be a buckler to be a Shield to be a protector if we trust him now the thing is we all want to trust him there's no question about that the question is is your love for him great enough to trust him as much as you need to that comes when you have more Holy Ghost it's hard to trust God when God is not first in your life right when you're filled with the Holy Ghost and you're living by the Holy Ghost you're trying to to do the things that please him at all times that Holy Ghost is there now the god who's been tried by fire is now living in you and you go untouched untouched I don't know what it is but by the grace of God you can stand there when everything is against you but you know he's there don't trade that for anything brother Marty and you know people see it in your life amen people see whether you trust God or whether you don't right you can say it a thousand times that you trust God but if you're not living it right put him first amen amen and he'll see you through amen let's stand together I want to read four verses here in Psalms 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress amen my God in him will I trust that's right surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee thee with his feathers I think that's what was happening to the three Hebrew children he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shall thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and thy buckler amen let's seek more Holy Ghost let's practice taking our burdens to the Lord and leaving him there amen amen let's bow our hearts in a word of prayer and if there's anyone here today feels in Your Heart Wants To Be Remembered in prayer with every eye closed every head bowed just lift your hand before the Lord God bless these hands and God sees your heart so beautiful so beautiful amen Heavenly Father we come to you with our hands United with our precious brothers and sisters Lord I just want more of you I know it is the answer to every situation is more of you and less of myself I pray for every Hungry Heart here every thirsty heart that's Desiring more of the Holy Ghost I pray Lord that as they spend time with you in prayer showing their love to you calling out for more of you in their life God that you would fill them with more spirit more oil that they may be able to walk to the very end to when you call us in a Rapture Lord father I pray for hearts that Lord behind their hand that was lifted that they're just wanting to about to trust you more in their trials to about to walk into a trial like the three Hebrew children they were confident they were so confident when they walked when they went in there when they were thrown into their circumstance they trusted you Lord they didn't back out they didn't threaten they didn't try to manipulate they were true blue Believers God I pray that you'd make us like that too bless your people Lord God you've chosen Us in this age you've given us the truth of your word we're a privileged people today to know that you are still the same yesterday today and forever you can still deliver in this hour like you delivered the three Hebrew children sometimes our trial seem seven times hotter Lord than than what we've gone through in the times past Lord we're so grateful that you have confidence in your people people that know you that can trust you through the hardest times as you're shaking Heaven and Earth as we're going through these end times Lord father you promise to see us through amen today Lord lift our hands to cast our cares upon you Lord for you care for us we humble ourselves under your word Lord we give you our lives we we surrender to you Lord and Lord may you give us the grace that we need just to not pick up those those burdens Lord but to leave them at your feet so we can walk away with Victory and Triumph knowing that our God is able more than able to do exceedingly above all that we ask or even think we serve a mighty God we love you we thank you for these things Lord
