song but while working in the fields the little boy had died but the woman's faith never failed even in death she testified that all this wares and our testimony today yes all is [Music] is [Music] little bright rest for all is well now things have not worked out like god's people fall for we're still here and we're fighting the greatest battle will ever fall but if we'll have the faith of abraham knowing god's word never fails if we'll trust in him we'll find that all is where yes lord jesus all is we have heard the message alone and all is well and there is that place a perfect breast behind the inner veil so rest little bright rest for all is where amen praise the lord jesus there's that perfect rest amen where do you find it you find it behind that veil you find it in christ amen that's where that rest is today praise the lord it's in jesus christ amen help us to get beyond that veil today help us lord to see past all the flesh and all the things of the world and all the chaos that's going on enter into that rest amen that is jesus christ praise the lord one more before we go to the lord in prayer now number 469 amen 469 i'll praise him wherever i go amen my whole life let

amen whether it's in this building whether it's in another facility wherever it is we're going to praise the lord jesus amen we're going to expect the visitation of his holy spirit we're going to expect the miracles to happen and continue to work in our lives amen he's the same yesterday today and amen praise the lord jesus god bless you today we have a a couple prayer requests i have here uh one i believe this one's sister lydia uh prayer request asking prayer for niece's son zach uh we'll be under undergoing back surgery this morning or this monday excuse me is that correct sister that's okay so her niece's son zach so let's remember that in prayer uh undergoing back surgery on monday so please remember him in prayer if you would i also got a request from sister norma although she's sitting here she could help me out maybe with this but uh it says all um it says also remember but it's the only thing i have here so i'm not sure um yeah yeah i think it went to micah and then it went to zach and then he said it to me so um it's from my daughter you go ahead and speak it now if anyone doesn't hear y'all clarify it okay from a daughter kathy the young man that she's raising his cousin committed suicide um friday night so he's a teenager just remember the family and burgess uh seems like that family has been abusing the children and also katrina's good friend renee uh her brother passed away um not her brother i'm sorry her cousin uh he drank himself to death unfortunately okay yeah that's the one i have here katrina's friend renee's family yeah cousin finally succumbed to alcoholism he's 40 in his 40s very young said he lost his family to a divorce and drank himself to death basically within two years is that correct that's right okay that's what we had here so amen anything else on that then amen so let's please remember that in prayer of course if you didn't get all that of course the lord did and that's the main part uh he said we ask you know it's one of those anomalies that you see in the scripture kind of a paradox because we know that god knows everything even from before it ever happened but he still wants us to ask him amen so that's what we do not that he's not mindful not that he doesn't already know but he still asks us to ask it's a it's an expression of faith we're asking lord because we believe that you answer our prayer amen amen not to mention the fact that it puts it puts a stamp on it you know it puts it say i asked the lord for this and god blessed me with it amen it's a stake it's a finality it's something you have faith in and believe amen it's absolute so anyone else have a prayer request today yes brother dennis yes uh remember my wife will have her surgery this friday very early and um and she's very nervous right now the lord will just touch you now amen please praise the lord just remember sister leah in prayer and would you want to clarify to the congregation exactly what it is she's going into surgery for sure um back in 2000 she had breast cancer on the right side and they not only put it through chemo but they also put it through uh radiation and now that she's having discomfort for a little while over 20 years and they're going to see if they can um help her with the discomfort yeah with the surgery this friday okay amen so let's please remember leah in prayer if you would anyone else have a prayer request um for my mom she is having some health issues with her stomach and they want to do like um stick tubes down her throat and stuff she's just decided she doesn't want to she's uh the good thing about everything that's been going on is the lord spoken to her recently about um just everything that's happened in my sister passing and my mom said that she's just uh she's not wanting to go but she says that she's at peace finally realizing that it's a beautiful thing and um so she's she's doing better than that but she doesn't want to doctors to start sticking things into so she's just having stomach issues we don't know they don't know what's wrong with her so she's just keeping prayer also from my father-in-law he's going through the same thing they don't know what's wrong with his stomach um and he is doing all the things that with the the tubing everything and they still can't find out what exactly is the problem so that's got him in my um his spirits down oh he mentioned to me he feels like the lord is not listening to him and that he's abandoned him i know that's the lie of the devil and amen he's just very uh um down up in his spirits wanting to hear from the lord just praying that the lord speaks to him and he has them amen to remember those requests and prayer too also remember uh got a couple more also remember sister julie higgins is supposed to go to the doctor this week and she's had a lot of a lot of pain in her abdomen area and uh it's been very discomforting to her and and really throwing her off her schedule at home and at work and obviously church too so please remember she's supposed to go this week i believe it's the fourth if i remember right it's not i apologize but i believe it's supposed to be this week that she's supposed to go to the doctor and find that out so please pray for brother john john duncan's working today uh he had a job he had to get completed and he's having a hard time getting some work uh some help to help him work so he's having to do a lot of it himself so please pray for him i don't know where my wife is she was in bed when i left so early this morning i left to come here early this morning and uh so i'm not i expected to see her i'm not sure where she is so remember her in prayer i had you uh alice's shoulders slightly dislocated oh you can pray for her please oh absolutely yeah she got hurt sister matisse um we had a i had a neighbor who is um who was born with a um an adrenal kind of issue i don't understand it his mother is not really able to express it to me and he's been in and out of mental hospitals because it's affected his um he is overactive and he's and with all the drugs he's been on written since he was four and it's just so his memory isn't very good and plus he's gotten the spirits on him that people get you know and so he hasn't been able to so lately i was giving a testimony about four months ago about my husband's life and while he was sitting there the holy spirit dropped down on him and he gave his he said i've never understood faith before he said i always thought stuff was just luck and he gave his heart to the lord that night and and and i feel really badly about this he lives clear out here on a commando say go by spanish trail and i live way over there and i don't really feel like i should be teaching him anyway and i'm just wondering if there is somebody who could step in to disciple him it's been like four months he's not able i gave him a bible a wonder bible he's not able to figure it out i mean he's really he's 53 now in this lifetime he's on four drugs now and that's the way it's been his whole life and so if so he needs to so i need some if somebody would please pray you know and see if you feel led to go down and help to mentor him he's got to be out of there by on march 29th so i've also been looking for a place for him to live his mother wants him home because she needs the money and he only has 780 a month he needs the money and he doesn't want to go home because it's cold and they all moved out here because it's warm and he's just digging in his heels and their relationship is toxic she doesn't want to be a mom anymore and she's criticizes everything he does that the whole it's a toxic relationship so but whether or not he can live alone is something else so we've got to try it and see if he can he's done it in the past but i can't find a place for him to live because the the he doesn't his mom ruined and now they have a blot on their credit record because of the eviction she caused it but there was a devil so this really needs prayer that he that he's in the right place i have not been able to find him a place to live i've been working on this for months nobody wants an addiction everybody wants more than 780 a month and uh and did you speak his name what did you speak his name derek mcdonald okay amen so let's remember that yeah he wants you know uh he's discovered the lord and what the lord just did a wonder in his life but there's a vacancy there and he he needs help praise the lord so we remember him in prayer again anyone else have anything real quick let's stand to

of verses of scripture here though from last week uh starting with verse 19 first kings chapter 19 verse 19 amen before we read let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer for good father god

pray that you blessed remaining part of this service as we commit it to you and ask your blessings on it now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen first kings chapter 19 verse 19. so he departed fence and found elisha the son of seraphat who was plowing with twelve oak yoke of oxen before him and he was with the twelfth and elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him he left the oxen ran after elijah and said let me i pray thee kiss my father and my mother then will i follow thee and he said unto him go back again for what have i done unto thee and he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen slew them and boiled their flesh the instruments of the oxen and gave unto the people they did eat then he arose and went after elijah ministered unto him amen you can be seated if you'd like amen we want to continue on the thought today of the fitted garment this would be the fitted garment part 2 as we got into last week the the mantle that was thrown down from elijah to elisha the invitation that that that god had told elijah to do that he went and found elisha and he threw that that garment he threw that mantle on elijah and that was merely an invitation but of course elisha knew the significance of it and what it meant to him but that garment was a very specific garment because it was a prophet's garment it was a garment that had a signification and had a meaning to it just like we know that we know that the bride today is robed in his righteousness that garment is a very specific garment and it's not just for everybody but it's only in tune to fit those that will fit that garment and elisha was the one that was that god had called to try to fit that garment and and we know that that was the call that god had given to him uh but there had to be something that he went through there had to be a a process that elisha had to go through to be able to fit that garment because there had to be a uh there had to be a life that was lived there had to be a purpose that was given there had to be a focus that elisha had to know who he was to be able to step into that friend you can't just say that you know brother branham come up to me and said okay son you are called to fill my shoes when i go and you say oh wonderful let's just get to it doesn't happen that way not that it was not that that was the situation with anybody i'm just typing that of course to elijah and elisha because that's basically what elijah did he went up to elisha through the mantle on him and basically saying that uh a son this is you this is this is the footsteps you're supposed to walk in and you're the one that's supposed to take my place when i'm taken out of here well he said well praise the lord that's wonderful let's just get to it no that wasn't elisha had to go through some training elisha had to go through some growing elisha had to go through some some molding and some shaping to be able to fit that garment because it's like we said last week the garment is not made for uh to be shaped for us we are supposed to be shaped to fit that garment and just like the elisha had to be shaped to fit that garment the bride in this last day has to be shaped and molded to be able to fit the garments bright the bride's garment that's the only way that she can get into it is because she has to be molded into that garment not that garment molded everybody wants to change god everybody wants to change the word everybody wants it to be according to the way they think it should be here some seminary or some church or some pastor but it can't be molded that way friend god will not uh conform to your religion or your idea of who you think he is god doesn't do that he doesn't conform himself into any denomination god's not going to conform himself into a message denomination god's not going to conform himself into what your idea of him is god is only who he is by his word and the only way we can get into him is for us to be conformed is for us to be molded the only way elijah could fit that garment is he had to be molded to fit that garment now look what brother branham said about this in the second hand robe 1956 november he said now notice elijah after he threw his robe on him now remember that robe was an invitation that's all it was now elisha was a free moral agent and uh i i've really kind of been on my heart on free moral agency lately but we're not gonna preach on it today but just this little part of it elijah was still a free moral agent just like every human ever born was born on free moral agency they were born born with choice they had a decision to make just because elijah threw the mantle down on elisha did not mean that that settled it elisha still had to make the decision of what he was going to do with that mantle what am i going to do with this invitation and see that's the invitation all of humanity gets every person ever born from adam and eve forward has given has been given an invitation to come to god and then later when christ came along to come to jesus christ and everybody today has that invitation if they want to come to jesus christ or not is simply an invitation and this mantle was thrown as an invitation and brother adam says now he threw that robe on him and he tried it on him he said in other words elijah the prophet who had the mantle of god on his shoulders came down and laid it across the line she's a farmer to see if it would fit him and it taken about 10 years that's brother brahms saying course scripturally referenced about 10 years to get altered to fit that mantle it took him about 10 years he's saying here for elisha to be molded to be able to fit that garment to fit that mantle you know god usually puts us in his shop and trims us up amen we know of course uh the the potter has power over the clay amen we know there's a whole the scripture reading in in romans 9 that tells us about how that he he's the potter and we are the clay and he molds us and he shapes us and that's what brother branham's talking about he said you know god usually puts us or shall i say always puts us in a shop and trims us up yes amen you just don't come out of the womb and and i'll just say that spiritually not physically but out of the spiritual womb and or you're bored again all of a sudden you just you know everything can do anything and all things are you know uh uh uh at your feet no there's there's training there's there's molding there's shaping and that's what brother graham's talking he wants he wants to trim us up he wants to make it to where we can fit that garment now there was a time uh back i i told y'all i think the other day i bought these suits like we were moving back from the mountains 2006 something like that five six seven something in that time frame so they're kind of old but you know after four five six years or so of wearing them um i i came to the part of life where i didn't fit them so well uh the garment didn't change garment was same size the one that changed was me and they got a little snug and they got a little tight and uh i went to his sister the tabernacle and well i actually talked to brother green about it because i was just going to get him altered he said oh no give him to sister uh i'll just tell you i i appreciate her she's a godly sister sister sarah codner a fantastic seamstress anyway and a precious sister but she she took them and and she she made them and took them out and got it to where i could fit into it again uh instead of me molding myself into the garment she took and altered the garment so the garment would still fit me and praise the lord i've got another six seven eight years whatever out of them to be able to wear them i'm about wearing them out now back during the beginning of the pandemic last year uh i probably ate a few more chips and drank a little too much soda and they started getting a little tight again and they didn't fit anymore so i looked at the back and i said well it looks like she took them out as far as they're gonna get taken out so there's got to be some shaping on this guy because these aren't going to be shaped anymore so there had to be something done to me so that i could still fit into them and about that time so i went to work with brother roger and swept my brains out every day and working hard out siding and sweating and sweating and sweating and working and working at work and all of a sudden i started putting them on i'm like wow these still fit these fit pretty good now again but see that time i had to be shaped to fit the garment even the garment could no longer be shaped in in this case the bride's garment it is it is perfectly in the shape of jesus christ we have to be trimmed up amen we have to be trimmed up whether it takes a little sweating it out whether it takes a little hard work whether it takes some extra time on your knees or a little time in prayer or reading your bible whatever it is to take some trimming to be able to fit into that bride garment to be able to fit into that word garment because it won't be altered because it's exactly the way it's supposed to be it's exactly perfect so we have to be molded to fit it the man said he likes to trim us up now see now look he didn't alter his robe to fit elisha amen he did not alter the robe the mantle to fit elisha he altered elisha to fit that mantle right amen and and and that's what he does today he alters us to fit the road not the robe to fit us we are shaped and molded into the word the word doesn't change to fit us the word's not gonna change to fit my lifestyle the words not gonna change to fit my idea or opinion or what the world thinks or what some denomination or seminary things or even some church no has to be me it has to be you yes we have to be the ones to change we have to be the ones that are molded sometimes we want to make the road fit us but we can't do that you've got to be altered you all to yourself to the robe it's god's robe and he made it perfect and he's got any uh he's got to bring us into that realm to make that robe fit us amen so that we fit in to that robe just like elisha was given that that chance now how did elisha this was a process we read this last week so if you want to turn over to second kings again uh you can turn over with me second kings chapter two i'm gonna read through this that we read last week but i'm not gonna take a lot of time and and expound on it like we did last week but just read through it again so second kings chapter two let's look at this again and let's see this process because i want to get something somewhere in the next 35 minutes 40 minutes so uh so we can take something from this today trust it bless you now second kings chapter 2 verse 1 and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that elijah went with elisha from gilgal and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i pray thee now listen to the verbiage of this listen to the verbiage of how the lord is amplifying this through elijah and what is being said okay and even just the verbiage in some of the words elijah said unto elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to bethel and elijah said unto him as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they both went down to bethel remember justification bethel the signification a signal of justification and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came to elisha and said unto him noah thou that the lord will make it uh will take thy master from thy head today and he said yea i know it hold your peace elijah said unto him elijah elijah said unto him elisha terry here i pray thee for the lord has sent me to jericho and he said as the lord liveth and as i soul liveth i will not leave thee so they came to jericho just uh sanctification amen bethel justification jericho sanctification the sons of the prophets that where jericho came to elisha and said unto him knowest thou knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from my head today he answered yeah i know it hold your peace elisha said unto him terry i pray thee here for the lord has sent me to jordan and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and the two went on amen together now jordan represents death separation dying to yourself which is into the holy ghost jordan the holy ghost and 50 men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view afar off and the two stood by jordan elijah took his mantle wrapped it together smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they went over on dry ground and they came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me and he said thou has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire horses of fire parted them both uh asunder and elisha went up our world went into elijah whenever went into heaven elisha saw it cried my lord my father my father the chariot of israel the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more he took a hold of his own clothes and read them in two pieces he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of the jordan and remember of course he took that he took that mantle and he struck that river jordan and said where is the god of elijah and the river did exactly as it did when elijah did it when elijah smote it it elijah it parted they walked on dry ground when elisha hit it it parted and they walked over on dry ground but what was it that he had to do elisha had to follow elijah he had to go with elijah he had to learn from elijah he had to be taught and he had to grow and he had to be molded and shaped and to be able to to fit into that to that mantle to fit into that place to fit into that position because the mantle was just a representation of who was wearing it you understand you're simply a representation of what is inside of you if the holy ghost is living in you and you are born again and you have the holy ghost you're simply your flesh is a representation of what is on the inside of you that mantle friend was simply a representation of the office that he now held elisha held it was it was simply but the life had to be what followed to match what the garment was saying to them so when they saw that garment they saw something they saw something of significance reason purpose the mantle had a reason purpose the one who wore it was that one that was the called it was that one that had that gift that prophetic gift so if you were wearing that mantle your life had to match the mantle the garment if you're expecting to have the bride's garment the word on clothes you today you have to have a life that's a representation of of the reflection of that word jesus christ if you don't then what do people think right they say well that person confesses to be a christian that person goes to church they act like they're a christian uh uh sometimes but then you know other times they they tend not to reflect jesus too much they look and say well i i don't think i ever saw jesus do that i don't think i ever saw jesus say that or talk that way since it's got to be something that's a a representation of a reflection of your life from the word it it's simply that that that's what that garment represents but see the only way to do it is to is to grow in grace to grow in the knowledge now let's transition from from elijah and elisha for a moment and this again let's take the next 30 minutes or so and let's talk about more talk about us let's talk about the scripture the modern day scripture you know jesus did the exact same thing to his disciples he does the exact same thing today invitation has gone forth we'll talk about that in a minute but see jesus gave his disciples and he gives everyone and he gives you today the exact same choice the exact same decision what are you going to do with it now look when jesus fed the multitudes and they came across the lake and many of them followed him and they they wanted to talk to him and get stuff from him and in john chapter six let's go to john chapter six we'll read start with in in john chapter 6. and if you know john chapter 6 at all you know that they debate with jesus back and forth now these are his disciples that are supposed to be the believers they're supposed to be the ones to now as in disciples followers not the 12 he chosen okay that that is we're not talking about that we're talking about the ones that followed with him the bible calls them disciples because they were followers of jesus they were following him where he went they saw the miracles and their bellies got full and uh and the great things that happened with jesus so they became disciples or followers of jesus they weren't his twelve now twelve were there too but we're not talking about just the 12. so he's supposed to be the one that they're following they have confidence trust faith in but yet they begin to question him one thing after the other and he debates and back and forth and finally gets to the point where he just lays it to him he says i am the bread that come down out of heaven i am the bread of life unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me i mean he just got right serious right down to him now without revelation friend that's a very radical statement unless you unless just reveal to you and you know what he's talking about and of course if he's speaking to you as his loved one as his bride then you know you know what he's telling you because it it's not just words that come and hit your ears or that you read off a page it's something that's revealed to you it's something that you see that it becomes a part of you because you know what he's talking about they didn't when he said i am that bread that come down out of heaven unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me they're without revelation that's radical friend they they didn't know what to do with that right so they got down now to the 20 to the 60th verse saint john 6 60 many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it you know people do the exact same thing today you may be or have witnessed the family members or people or friends that you know and they'll try to tell you the exact same thing why do you look like that why do you act like that why don't you watch this why don't you go here why do you wear those clothes why do you look the way you do why is it that you're different than everybody else oh you just think you're more special than everybody what they don't know the truth of it is is you're not special you're just special amen you're not special in their vernacular but you're special in his and that's all that really matters but they'll tell you why do you do that you don't need to live like that god doesn't care god doesn't mind if you do this a little or if you go there a little or if you act this way a little if you wear that or if you chop off that stringy hair you know i'm sure you've heard it uh you god doesn't care it doesn't matter god doesn't mind god it's okay see because that's a hard saying to most people they come and they look and they say and they look at this message which you're a reflection of this word which you're a reflection of because you have on the wedding garments and they look and say that's a hard saying that's a hard way of living no it really isn't give it a try sometime but without the holy ghost and without revelation yes it is yes but the question then becomes who can hear this who can do this who can live this friend not only will the bride hear it not only will she live it but she becomes it but to others they don't know because it doesn't mean anything to them how can you do that how can you live that way oh that's hard that that's a that's a tough life boy you're just binding yourself down no what you don't realize is that i have been liberated in jesus christ but because i've been born again my liberation causes me to want to live a life that's pleasing to jesus christ that's what i do because that's who i am yes others say oh that's hard how could you do that how could you have you had to have fun family members or friends tell you oh you don't need to do that oh that's a hard thing why do you do that you shouldn't live that you just that that's just bondage that's so hard that's exactly the same thing that unbelievers were saying then but because it's a revelation to you because it's a revelation of the word that's been revealed to your heart by the holy spirit living in you you know what god has done for you so many of them left they said this is a hard saying who can hear it and when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you what and if you shall see the son of man to send up where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh propheted nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore i say unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him by my father praise the lord from that time amen separation from that time many of his disciples went back and no walk no more with him disciples followers of jesus left him parted from him had no more relation with him at all friend foe they parted what parted them the truth the word the word my friend when it's lived when it's coming to a life and lived has separated many a friend many a family because there's got to be a separation to divide belief from unbelief that's the only prejudice that god even has god's not worried about the color of a person's skin we all bleed red he's not worried about nationality we're all humans but what he does care about is belief being separated from unbelief do not be unequally yoked see that's his word that's the scripture that's what he does care about so many of them left because they could not take the revelation of the word right so they went away from him they're molding they're shaping their clay to the potter has now broke into pieces because they they desired no more to be molded by god right this is too hard i can't take this and there's been many people to do that i i i've even heard people say well i believe it's the truth but i just can't do it i just can't live it i i don't know how you can make that statement as a literal fact because if you really believe something you're gonna do it you're going to live it if you really do believe it not not just something that's a verbage that comes across your lips but i mean an actual indwelling in your heart that you that you really believe people can say oh i believe the world is round do you really believe it some people might still even today say i think the world's flat well do you really believe it let's get in the car just drive and see if we fall off the edge or get in the boat get on the ocean we'll just go till we fall off the edge do you really believe what do you really believe see because it's not just something that is an intellect it's got to be something that's in the heart it's got to be something that's in not just in the spirit but in your soul is it true is it real if it is you're going to do it amen you're going to do it if you truly if somebody told you i've used this before but if somebody told you there was a a a million hundred dollar bills in this building and you believe them what would you do oh i just stay at home you know go to the store and struggle to pay for my groceries i know there's a hundred million dollars sitting over there i really believe it too i really do i believe who told me i believe it i truly believe in fact i've even poked in the window and i've looked a little bit and i saw it it's in there but you know i can't i i don't want to go in there it doesn't work that way if you really believe something you're gonna do it you're gonna believe it you're gonna live it it's gonna become a part of you but i've known people that that they would actually make that statement oh i believe it i just can't live it oh friend where do those people stand there but now from that time when the word came real from that time they rocked off and left him now look jesus giving his 12 that he personally hand picked the same the same choice same choice just like elijah gave elisha this is the choice you have to make a decision you're a free moral agent then jesus said then said jesus unto the twelve will ye go all gold also go away then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go that's right one of the greatest ascendances i believe in the entire scripture where can we go right where could i go i've told y'all before all my proverbial eggs are in one proverbial basket and that basket's called jesus if jesus turns out not to be real which it's hard for me to even say that because that's that's of course wrong i i'm i'm done because he's my everything my everything is in him he's my all in all i i don't i don't have a plan b i don't have a backup am i he's everything he's all yeah i i don't have any other place to go say you know if this jesus thing don't work out and maybe i'll go try this or try it no no no no no it's it's it's all in one basket it's it's him or nothing right that's it that's all i have but i believe that's all i need too yeah yeah but he said where are you gonna go and they said where could we go we have no other place to go thou has the words of eternal life we may not know what you're saying we may not understand what you just told them but we know that you have the words of eternal life right i may not understand it all but i believe it and because i believe it i'm staying right here amen isn't that just exactly what elisha did yes god jesus gave his disciples a choice well you just go away if you want to you can go away too or you're going to leave too and they said we're not going to leave you isn't that what elisha said oh we're i'm never going to leave you i'm going wherever you go because i want to get what god has promised through you to me so i'm going to be with you praise the lord i'm going to walk with you wherever you go whatever you do however you act whatever you eat i'm going to be there peter says where are we going to go god where are we going to go you have the words of eternal life i don't understand he may have even looked to his other brothers and said eat his flesh drink his what is it you fellas know what he's talking about how are we supposed to eat on his how are we supposed to do this i mean because if you think naturally and understand these they hadn't received the holy ghost yet right i mean but the truth of it is it's like brother braham said it's not so important that you understand everything but you believe everything right and they proved they believed it because they stayed with him elisha proved he believed it he he dedicated his choice that was determined because of the mantle that was thrown on him i am not going to leave you i'm going to stay with you whatever we go through and whatever happens i will endure and i will go through peter says you have the words of eternal life we have no other place to go and we believe and are sure that thou art the christ the son of the living god praise the lord amen hey they had the choice you can leave too you want to leave go ahead and leave many of them left but the 12 stood there and one of them was a devil genesis carrick was still there with him and he stayed there too of course a lot of times it becomes a mob mentality you know people get used to being around certain people and they they won't leave regardless no matter what happens uh they stay right there but and and but it wasn't ordained for him either just wasn't his time so all 12 so they stayed and said oh we're going to stay we're going to follow you jesus uh we're going to lay on the rocks we're going to go hungry uh we're gonna do whatever we have to do whatever you do we're gonna do it how do you act we're gonna act whatever you say we're gonna say whatever you eat we're gonna eat whatever you wear we're gonna wear we want to be just like you amen because you have the words of eternal life and we are absolutely convinced that you are the son of the living god amen that should be the resolve of every christian today regardless of what some church or some pastor says jesus i am going to stay with you regardless because i want my life to emulate you in every way whatever you said in your word for me to do i'm gonna do whatever your word says for me to wear i'm gonna wear whatever your word says for me to eat i'm gonna eat wherever it tells me to go not go that's what i'm gonna do because i know that you have the words of eternal life amen because we get that same choice every day friend oh you can leave anybody in this building this morning can walk out that door and leave never see you again it's your choice right you can do it if you want amen children are a little harder because maybe they don't have any other place to go but but a lot of cases they do but i don't believe the young ones here want to anyway but thank the lord for that but the choice is still there you understand that's the choice you can go away if you want and a lot of people do i've known a lot of people through the 40 years i've been in this message my whole life as a christian but mainly in the past 33ish or so i've been preaching i've seen people come and go i see people that i i saw him for the last time i've seen people say i don't believe that uh they call this message this at the other and they say i'm leaving and i'll never be back i don't believe it i don't trust it they go out in the world they live however they want to live first thing the woman does cut her hair almost every time almost every incident i've seen now people leave this message go out of the world first thing you do is cut the hair yeah it's just experience i'm not condemning them the word does that i'm just saying experience i've seen it happen amen but the invitation the invitation is still there jesus gave him the invitation will you go also are you going to leave too no no no no we're going to stay right here elijah gave elisha oh just stay here elisha oh no no no no no i'm going with you wherever you go i'm going to go you never wanted one but i'm going to be your siamese twin i'm going to be connected to you by the hip oh friend can we just get that way just think about that from but can we just kind of get that way with the word yes with christ the word say i i know that maybe elijah didn't want to a siamese twin but i'm going to be one i want to be jesus attached now not to the hip with him we're attached more at the heart with jesus but you know what i'm saying the attachment is there lord i'm not going to leave you i don't care what my family does i don't care what my friends say i don't care what this other church is those other people jesus i'm going to stay with you period at all cost okay you know what you're in for not really but i don't care okay well we'll find out if you care or not because this is going to happen down the road this is going to take place in your life down the road you sure you can handle it you sure you can take it right all i know lord is i have no other place to go all i know lord is you are the son of the living god all i know is you are the way the truth the life you hold everything that's all i know whatever happens to me here now is inconsequential yes it's hard yes life gets tough yes the trials get get tough and tricky and and heart but if you're with him he'll stay with you and he'll help us through every one of those trials through every one of those situations and troubles god is always with us let's go to another one luke saint luke chapter 24 the disciples elisha would not leave the disciples would not leave the 12 the one eventually judas did but the other 11 stayed right there some crucified sideways right because they believed it so much you know brother said people come out and say this this is a fake and that's a fake and this jesus sitting real and all this stuff he said if it wasn't why did the people that followed him get crucified upside down sideways and had their heads chopped off gladly went in martimet for the sake of christ the word why would they do that if this was all just put on and made up and fake amen because it's not elisha wouldn't go disciples wouldn't go but the invitation still stands will you go also amen my resolve is lord you have the words of eternal life i've got no other place to go i'm not that i want to go any other place right this is my home jesus christ that's my home st luke chapter 24. now let's look at this because then jesus gives them another one because remember this whole time we're being molded and shaped and we're growing in grace we're growing in the lord we're we're being molded to fit that garment remember we're being molded to fit that garment so as we come along on this journey what he did with the disciples luke 24 he gave him very specific instructions he said uh we'll just read the 48 24 49 and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high now what is this jesus tell them jesus is saying i send the promise of my father upon you that that promise now that promise is going to come he already declared it and of course he says in many other places in the scripture we'll read one in a little bit where he says that promise is going to come but what you need to do is you need to tarry here in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high you stay here until that and just terry be still be patient wait on the lord and that promise will come the holy spirit will fall down upon you amen now of course i'm paraphrasing the word but that's we know exactly what happened that word that that spirit will come down that power will will be endured to you from on high because of the promise of god that i send back unto you which we know is his own life the holy spirit that holy spirit that he said but you've got to tarry here you can't just go here and go yonder and go do this and live this kind of life and be like this and go no no you tarry here patient wait let the lord minister to you let the shaping take place in your life let the lord mold you and make you until you be endued with power from on high now the rest of this i wanted to read that the 50th verse and he led them out as far as to bethany raised up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing god amen now see what brother branham says here an identification this is 1963 january 1963 identification he says we've got to take as full gospel people as full gospel people we have identified ourselves as full gospel people let's mold our character we're invited to be molded in his image praise the lord that we might reflect his presence now when did that invitation come and the invitation come in acts we'll read in just a minute the invitation come when the invitation come they had a choice elisha had a choice when the mantle came and the invitation was there they had a choice what are we going to do with this these disciples had a choice will you go away no no we're going to stay right here well then the promise of god is going to come down upon you stay in jerusalem terry here and that power will come and uh from on high you will be endued with power from on high now brother i'm saying we're invited we're invited as strange the way he puts that invited in invitation i think the way he did it the lord speaking through him the way he did it allowed for the opportunity of decision of free moral agency because an invitation is is is not a mandate it's not a directive uh it's not an absolute it's simply an invitation you can accept it or you can reject it it's the choice i i believe that may be some of the reason it was that it was given that way we're invited that's your choice we're invited to be molded in his image that we might reflect his presence and the works that i do shall you do also the life that i live shall you live so we're invited by god to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his he said what a thing brother my we have uh then we have we let his character be in us then we have become sons by having the mind of christ the mind which is the character let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus right the choice the decision he said we have that invitation to let our character be molded molded to what to be like his character to be able to fit that that that dress to be able to fit that word garment we've been invited to be molded to let the word mold us to let the spirit continue to mold us to fit that image we've been invited to do that brother adam says my that's what a thing that is an invitation that jesus gave now you're not the only ones that have that invitation everybody around the world has that invitation everybody since christ has had that invitation everybody that ever lives has had that invitation if not god has to give them life if they haven't had the choice then he's got to give him life or he's not a just god everybody's had that choice that decision what are you going to do with the decision the invitation that god has given our character is to be molded by what's on the inside of us and our outside only expresses what is on the inside what are we how we walk how we talk no matter no matter what we say our life speaks louder than our words do amen now in acts chapter 1 i'm going to try to finish this up here in acts chapter 1 verse 1 the former treaties have i made all theophilus of all that jesus began to do both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after the after he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many un infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god and that's part of where we get the understanding that uh the dead in christ arise and be with us for for 40 days right let's say 40. brother braham talks about it but that's 40 days brother branham told brother green brother green's testimony he said a minimum of 30 days well the bible says here he was with us for 40 days we get that 40 days the dead in christ will rise and appear in divinity just like the bible said we have the types we know what the bible says this resurrection won't be different from that in that way 40 days speaking of things pertains to the kingdom of god and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which said ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem in all judea and in samaria and unto the other most parts of the earth now it's just a reiteration or a speaking over again of the promise that jesus had already given to them you do this and you have this you stay here go to jerusalem tarry you'll ris being do with power from on high this is the promise that god gave this is the promise that we receive as his children as his disciples and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up with a cloud taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they look steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men still by them and white apparel which also said you men of galilee why stand you gazing up into heaven this same jesus which was taken up from you into heaven shall all shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven that's the promise of god that was the promise he to give the promise to the disciples now what did the disciples do they followed his word many of them left judas proved to he was the eleven were still there and how many saw him go away just like elijah elijah went away in the sight of elisha they're with him this whole time and they learned and they were taught and they were molded and they were shaped just like our invitation just like the invitation god said brother graham said that we have today by god we've been invited very much that our character be molded did our character be shaped that our character be molded to fit and to emulate his character to be like jesus that's the invitation same invitation today amen they had that then and then they just like elisha they watched him go away and they saw him going to heaven he says as you see me go away you'll know that i'll be sending the promise of the father back unto you acts chapter 2 verse 1 and when the day of pentecost was fully come there were all with one accord and one place suddenly there came a sound from heaven as the rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting there's the mantle there's the mantle jesus goes away just like elisha elijah and what did he do he threw back a mantle upon the people the holy spirit and it was their choice the holy ghost was just an invitation will you accept it will you receive it will you let the holy ghost come into your life will you let jesus take over your life will you let him mold you and make you and shape you nobody said it's an easy walk right nobody said it was going to be like a bed of roses it is not mainly because our human flesh fights so hard against the things of god because the spirit of the devil is enmity with god and it's and it has influence over our spirits and over our bodies and our bodies and our spirits live with that influx of all the world stuff that comes in all the time from out here from out in satan's eaton and it influences and and that's the biggest battle we have brother bam talk about the greatest battle ever fought in the mind that greatest battle ever fought is there because it runs as enemy against god that's the hardest thing that we have to fight against right the hardest thing i have to fight against is the mind the man that you're looking at right now i'm the one that has the hardest problem with me i'm the one that has to fight the hardest to get me to die that's the hardest part amen but when we do the promise of god's word is so much greater that it and the spirit that's within you molds our character on the outside to where the outside simply becomes a reflection the mantle simply a reflection of what's on the inside the mantle was thrown back on them and they had the choice there came a sound from heaven a rusty mighty wind it filled all the house where they were sitting there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance amen now those around they didn't completely understand that give me just a couple more minutes they didn't completely understand that so as peter the big mouth that come out that always you know he's always getting himself in trouble but in a lot of cases he was he spoke profound things he was the one that spoke up when jesus said are you going to go away peter was the one that spoke up and said where are we going to go right you have the words of eternal life peter was also the one that that said uh uh that rebuked jesus when he talked about leaving and and jesus had to say get thee behind me satan well he wasn't calling peter satan but the spirit that was influencing peter's statement was of the devil right so god said jesus said get he behind me satan but now peter stands up and the invitation goes out the holy ghost came in 120 that were there friend but it wasn't exclusive to the 120 the invitation was broadcast throughout the world for every human to ever live to have that choice peter said now 37th verse now when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts and said unto peter and the rest of the disciples apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to and to them that are far off even as many as the lord are god shall call shall call what is that that's an invitation it's the invitation now as god's calling what are people doing what are people saying we're winding down to the end of this thing friend yes we know that this can't be much longer a year two years five ten we don't know right but we do know it just can't go on much longer the way it is right we do see the things that's happening and the prophecies of the prophet gave us and the scriptural vindications in revelation 13 we know that there's going to be a whole cell attack there already is when 20 years ago a catholic priest will hold up a message book and tell you this is our greatest enemy don't you don't think they don't know who you are they know exactly who we are and we are the enemy and according to revelation 13 it's going to overcome anyone that is not born again to have the holy ghost to go in the rapture right and only the bride will go in the rapture right that's just only the bride goes that's just the way it is so the good thing is to get into christ the invitations come to get into him if we get into him and we let that and let our character be molded and shaped to fit into that word amen to where people look and they they they don't see a literal wedding dress but they see a garment that you're clothed in and that garment is the unmerited favor and grace and the righteousness of jesus christ his word that word molding shaping but i don't know i'm not sure about that one god i just well you know uh maybe you need a little more molding yes amen right no doubt no unbelief elisha stayed with elijah never left his side and when he saw him go he got the promise amen he got the promise just like we got the promise what is our promise today saint john 14 verily verily 14 12 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on work on me the words that i do shall he do also and greater works than these what did elisha get a double portion what is god telling us greater works not even just a double it's just the greater works greater worse than god almighty jesus christ god and flesh on earth that's what he said greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father and listen friend let this encourage you today listen real close because i'm going to close with this whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do amen you believe that yes that the father may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask anything in my name i will do it right that's his word yes not mine that's the words of jesus christ now my mind goes back to my question goes back to do we really believe it right people say they believe it oh i can't live it i can't do that but i believe it no if you believe it it becomes you amen if it becomes you have no problem living it because it's just who you are amen but we have to be molded to fit it not it be shaped to fit us everybody likes to try to shape it all the word the bible and stuff to fit them oh my music the way i be yeah i know your music won't even
