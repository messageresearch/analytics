[31:45] blessed and I'm so thankful
[31:48] I I had I had a rough time getting to
[31:52] the job this past week
[31:54] um
[31:55] we ended up on actually he ended up
[31:57] leaving early because we were early I
[31:59] tried to condense this just for a minute
[32:01] but because we were early
[32:03] uh
[32:04] because we were early when we got close
[32:07] to Denver they had planes stacked up
[32:09] because the weather so they put us out
[32:12] over the Rocky Mountains and we were
[32:13] surfing around and around I'm like what
[32:15] are we doing we're just going around the
[32:17] right beautiful sight over the Rocky
[32:18] Mountains real pretty but I'm thinking
[32:20] what are we doing and we go round and
[32:23] back and we start heading to Denver and
[32:24] I think okay well we just kind of got
[32:27] held in a holding pattern and we're
[32:28] going to Denver now and he turned back
[32:30] around and like oh my goodness they kept
[32:33] us on holding patterns and we ended up
[32:34] going up to Grand Junction and landed in
[32:36] Grand Junction
[32:38] thought we were just going to get some
[32:40] gas because we were just going to do a
[32:42] gas and go get some gas because the
[32:44] holding pattern had been so long around
[32:45] was running out of gas to go over to
[32:47] Denver which is about a 30 minute flight
[32:49] uh so we landed there got the gas truck
[32:52] finally out there and the mechanics
[32:54] could not put the gas in in the plane it
[32:57] had the mechanism that wouldn't fit so
[33:00] they had to try to find the mechanic the
[33:02] the United mechanic to come out there
[33:04] and they couldn't find the guy Labor Day
[33:07] weekend I'm sitting there thinking the
[33:08] man's on the lake fishing somewhere
[33:10] there's no way this guy's gonna ever
[33:12] come I thought it was going to end up in
[33:13] Grand Junction all night
[33:15] spent four hours in Grand Junction
[33:18] finally the guy came finally got some
[33:20] gas finally weather cleared finally got
[33:23] to Denver uh needless to say I ended up
[33:27] getting to Salt Lake about midnight I
[33:30] was supposed to get there at seven
[33:32] o'clock or something I got to the room
[33:33] at one but it was quite the ordeal and
[33:36] of course I wasn't they there was two
[33:39] more flights leaving
[33:41] the next flight I couldn't make the next
[33:44] flight we ended up being so late uh that
[33:47] I wasn't going to make it but that Flint
[33:49] that plane got delayed too because of
[33:51] the weather so my my uh arrival gate was
[33:55] only six Gates away so I walked by that
[33:58] gate and I told the lady I said can I
[34:00] get on this plane and she looked she
[34:02] said yeah we got room so she put me on
[34:04] that plane to Salt Lake instead of the
[34:06] next morning so I finally did get to
[34:09] Salt Lake but my bags didn't make it so
[34:11] I had to work all day Monday in my
[34:12] travel clothes which was not a big deal
[34:15] they were probably more comfortable than
[34:17] my regular clothes it just got my
[34:19] my clothes dirty but anyway it worked
[34:23] out okay but the Lord uh had a reason
[34:25] for everything and whatever it was you
[34:28] know Saints the Lord can have a circle
[34:31] around over the Rocky Mountains and
[34:32] you're wondering what the world's going
[34:33] on uh but sometimes only eternity is
[34:37] going to Bear out wise things happen
[34:39] sometimes the way they do you may never
[34:42] know uh Sonia says that's terrible I
[34:45] said I know I want to get
[34:49] get some good rest uh none of that
[34:52] really happened but there's a reason so
[34:55] whatever it is I'm just thankful the
[34:58] Lord blessed made it had a good week the
[35:01] Lord brought back safe yesterday so I'm
[35:03] thankful that uh he blessed us so thank
[35:06] the Lord for that so let's stand to our
[35:08] feet if we could
[35:11] just take these out and then I hear I
[35:14] almost ended up in the airport at the
[35:15] same time that sister Sheila because I
[35:17] was supposed to leave out Monday morning
[35:18] they had scheduled me but because of
[35:22] this other flight they didn't schedule
[35:23] me on that flight because it was
[35:25] supposed to leave at 8 55 and when they
[35:27] rescheduled you they don't take into
[35:29] account that that flight's delayed too
[35:31] but I keep track of it watch it and it
[35:34] showed that flight was delayed so I
[35:36] thought well it kept getting delayed and
[35:38] delayed and I thought well I'm just
[35:39] gonna go by now
[35:40] she put me on that flight and I made it
[35:42] home or made it to the job so thankful
[35:45] God makes a way somehow amen so I'm
[35:49] thankful for that so Amen brother Dennis

[50:28] chapter 13 just want to read two verse
[50:30] of scripture let you be seated 21 and
[50:33] 22.
[50:35] acts 13 21 and afterward they desired a
[50:40] king
[50:40] and God gave unto them Saul the son of
[50:43] sis a man of the tribe of Benjamin by
[50:47] the space of 40 years and when he had
[50:50] removed him he raised up unto them David
[50:54] to be their King to whom also he gave
[50:58] testimony and said I have found David
[51:00] the son of Jesse a man after mine own
[51:05] heart which shall fulfill all my will
[51:11] praise the Lord right to be seated if
[51:14] you like
[51:15] amen so I I just titled this today the
[51:18] will of God the will of God uh not
[51:22] necessarily uh the will of God in as a
[51:25] whole but what the will of God is for
[51:28] each of Our Lives amen what the will of
[51:30] God means to us and what that does to
[51:33] the generality or or as a whole for the
[51:37] bride internationally around the world
[51:38] and Through Time amen everyone has
[51:42] always had their part to play every
[51:45] Christian every born-again believer has
[51:47] always had their part to play in the
[51:49] position that God puts us in and the
[51:51] ability to be able to fulfill that that
[51:54] purpose uh unless we rebel against it
[51:59] and don't do it uh that sometimes
[52:02] becomes a little annoyance a little
[52:04] caveat but uh but God has a will God has
[52:08] a perfect will in his mind this this uh
[52:11] scene has already been played out and
[52:13] God has this in his mind and what his
[52:15] will is and what is important to God
[52:18] what matters the most to the Lord look
[52:20] God says here
[52:23] God speaking I believe through Paul here
[52:26] he's telling him that God's speaking to
[52:29] the high court if I believe I remember
[52:30] right in the synagogue there and he's
[52:32] telling them about down through the time
[52:35] and what God did for the children of
[52:37] Israel for them and he's speaking of
[52:40] when God put Saul in charge and then
[52:42] when he removed Saul and then he's
[52:44] talking about when he raised David up
[52:46] and it says he said that God found David
[52:49] the son of Jesse who was a man after his
[52:52] own heart after God's Own Heart a man
[52:55] after God's Own Heart why was David
[52:58] considered a man after God's Own Heart
[53:01] why was it look let's go over to Santa
[53:04] let's go over to second Samuel we'll
[53:06] come back to that part because that's
[53:07] one of the biggest main things I want to
[53:10] strike on today
[53:16] why was David a man after God's Own
[53:18] Heart look second Samuel let's read
[53:21] beginning of the 12 let's look at the
[53:22] 12th chapter beginning with the first
[53:24] verse
[53:26] second second Samuel chapter 11 verse 1.
[53:32] let's read this keep in mind now this is
[53:35] a man after God's Own Heart
[53:39] amen David a man after God's Own Heart
[53:43] and it came to pass after the year was
[53:46] expired at the time when kings go forth
[53:48] to battle
[53:49] that David sent joab and his servants
[53:51] with him and all Israel and they
[53:53] destroyed the children of Ammon and
[53:55] besieged rhaba but David tarried still
[53:58] at Jerusalem
[54:00] and it came to pass an evening tithe
[54:03] that David arose off his bed and walked
[54:05] upon the roof of the King's house and
[54:08] from the roof he saw a woman washing
[54:10] herself the woman was very beautiful to
[54:13] look upon David sent and inquired after
[54:16] the woman and once said is not this
[54:18] Bathsheba the daughter of elium the wife
[54:21] of Uriah the hittite
[54:22] and David sent Messengers and took her
[54:25] and she came in unto him and he laid
[54:27] with her for she was purified from her
[54:30] uncleanness and she returned unto her
[54:32] house
[54:33] and the woman conceived and sent and
[54:36] told David and said I am with child
[54:38] and David sent to joab saying Send Me
[54:41] Uriah the hittite and joab sent Uriah to
[54:45] David now look setting the scene here
[54:48] we're setting the scene of a man after
[54:50] God's Own Heart
[54:51] this man after God's Own Heart walks out
[54:54] on the roof of his house and looks
[54:56] across to the other roof and sees a
[54:58] beautiful woman and desires her so much
[55:00] that he calls on his men his soldiers to
[55:03] go get her and bring her to him when she
[55:06] comes and they meet he lays with her
[55:09] another man's wife he lays with her and
[55:13] impregnates her remember this is a man
[55:16] after God's Own Heart
[55:18] praise the Lord
[55:20] but remember he's not a man after God's
[55:23] Own Heart because of the perfect Deeds
[55:25] of his life
[55:27] he's a man after God's Own Heart because
[55:29] he was a man that was going to fulfill
[55:32] all God's will yeah
[55:34] yeah praise the Lord that's why he was a
[55:37] man after God's Own Heart not causes
[55:39] mistakes not cause of his Humanity or
[55:42] carnality not because even a lustful
[55:44] Spirit but because he was a man that was
[55:47] going to fulfill all God's will
[55:50] praise the Lord lays with this woman now
[55:54] he's conniving a plan to hide it amen
[55:57] who is he hiding it from David knows
[56:00] well enough Saints Mobility God David
[56:03] knows well enough let me take this off
[56:05] he knows well enough that God knows that
[56:08] there's no way he can hide anything from
[56:10] God
[56:10] he knows god well enough but he tries to
[56:14] hide it who is he hiding it from he's
[56:16] hiding it from the kingdom he's hiding
[56:18] it from all the people he's hiding it
[56:20] from the ones who are his subjects that
[56:22] are under him as king that's who he's
[56:24] trying to hide everything from now look
[56:26] he said
[56:29] um
[56:30] and when and when you're right seventh
[56:32] verse now let's pick this back up he
[56:34] sends joette to go get Uriah bathsheba's
[56:37] husband and when your eye was coming to
[56:40] him David demanded of him how joab did
[56:42] and how the people did and how the war
[56:44] prospered just making small talk for to
[56:47] try to make his life more believable
[56:50] and David said to Uriah go down to thy
[56:53] house and wash thy feet and you ride the
[56:55] parted out of the King's house and there
[56:58] followed him uh a mess of meat from the
[57:01] King but Uriah slept at the door of the
[57:04] King's house with all the Servants of
[57:07] his Lord and went not down to his house
[57:10] he actually disobeyed
[57:13] the king's order because David told him
[57:16] go down to your house and to get some
[57:20] rest do your uh do your thing be be the
[57:24] husband to your wife
[57:26] uh but your eyes slept at the king's
[57:28] door at the uh uh David's at the at the
[57:33] door of the House of the Kingdom
[57:35] and when they had told David saying
[57:37] Uriah went not down into his house David
[57:39] said unto Uriah came us down not from my
[57:42] journey why then did else not go down
[57:45] into thy house Uriah said to them now
[57:48] look at the Integrity of this man now I
[57:49] want you to know something
[57:52] God said
[57:53] he used Paul to say it he said another
[57:55] place too that David was a man after
[57:59] God's Own Heart
[58:01] but I'm reading you a story about a man
[58:04] who in this instant at least has more
[58:08] Integrity than David
[58:10] more Integrity than the man that's after
[58:13] God's Own Heart so much so that the
[58:16] prophet of this day brother Brandon said
[58:19] I can't wait to get there to shake your
[58:21] eyes hand
[58:24] amen this this Uriah was such a man of
[58:27] character now look uriah's 11th verse
[58:30] Uriah said unto David The Ark in Israel
[58:33] and Judah abide in tents and my Lord
[58:36] joab and the Servants of my Lord are
[58:38] encamped in the Open Fields shall I then
[58:41] go into my house to eat and drink and
[58:44] Delight with my wife
[58:45] as thou livest and as thy soul livest I
[58:49] will not do this thing this man had so
[58:52] much integrity
[58:53] that all he could think of was the men
[58:57] that he fought with that the captain
[58:59] that he fought under the the the the uh
[59:03] the ark of the covenant all he could
[59:05] think of was everything it's all out in
[59:07] the open they're sleeping under the
[59:09] stars they're resting in tents how can I
[59:11] go to my house and enjoy eat and drink
[59:15] and my wife when they're out there
[59:17] slaving and laboring and risking their
[59:20] lives what a man of integrity says this
[59:23] man you're right no wonder you know what
[59:26] brother random said I can't wait to
[59:28] shake his hand I want to be second in
[59:29] line
[59:31] this is this is quite a man here amen
[59:35] Uriah was a man a man of God and
[59:38] although but yeah God uh uh David was
[59:43] the man after God's Own Heart
[59:45] now look because this is the story think
[59:47] this is the truth think about the will
[59:50] of God now our topic here
[59:53] amen and David said to your Aunt Terry
[59:56] here today also and tomorrow I will let
[59:59] thee depart so Uriah Abode in Jerusalem
[1:00:02] that day and tomorrow and when David had
[1:00:05] called him he did eat and drink before
[1:00:07] him and he made him drunk now he's
[1:00:09] trying to make him drunk to go lay with
[1:00:11] his wife
[1:00:13] because he wants to he wants to make it
[1:00:16] look like his that uriah's wife was
[1:00:19] impregnated by her husband instead of
[1:00:21] David
[1:00:22] he's trying to hide the fact that he's
[1:00:24] the baby's father
[1:00:26] David called him to eat and drink and he
[1:00:28] tried to make him drunk now he tried to
[1:00:30] tell him go down and and go home and
[1:00:34] enjoy your wife and eat and drink and
[1:00:36] rest he didn't do that now he's trying
[1:00:39] to get him drunk
[1:00:41] and even he went out to lie on his bed
[1:00:44] with the Servants of his Lord but he
[1:00:47] went not down to his house
[1:00:51] and it came to pass in the morning that
[1:00:54] David wrote a letter to joab sent it by
[1:00:57] the hand of Uriah
[1:00:58] look at this now I mean I'm I'm sorry
[1:01:01] friend I know David's the man after
[1:01:04] God's Own heart and I know why in closer
[1:01:06] scripture says one but this is wicked
[1:01:09] this is an evil evil plot on David's
[1:01:13] part from the very beginning to take
[1:01:16] this man's wife to himself to impregnate
[1:01:19] her to try to hide it by conniving a way
[1:01:22] to get Uriah to go down to her to try to
[1:01:25] get him drunk now now he's sending a
[1:01:28] message to joab through Uriah
[1:01:31] yeah now look what the message says
[1:01:34] and he wrote in the letter saying
[1:01:37] set ye and riot in the Forefront of the
[1:01:40] hottest battle
[1:01:42] and retire ye from him that he may be
[1:01:45] smitten and die that's the message that
[1:01:48] Uriah is taking to joab
[1:01:51] joab put the man with the message in the
[1:01:54] hottest battle so that he dies
[1:01:57] now he's trying to kill the man to cover
[1:01:59] it up because if he can kill Uriah he
[1:02:02] can go take Bathsheba and make it look
[1:02:04] okay
[1:02:06] make it look like there was never an
[1:02:08] indiscretion there I mean this this is
[1:02:11] again this is a very Wicked plan yes
[1:02:15] this is just evil
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:21] praise the Lord and it came to pass when
[1:02:23] joab observed the city that he that he
[1:02:26] is uh assigned Uriah unto a place where
[1:02:29] he knew that ballot men were and the men
[1:02:33] in the city went out and fought with
[1:02:35] joab and there fell some of the people
[1:02:37] of the Servants of David and Uriah the
[1:02:40] hittite died also
[1:02:43] David got his wish he finally got rid of
[1:02:48] Uriah he finally found a way he finally
[1:02:53] was able to accomplish a way that he
[1:02:55] could hide his indiscretion with
[1:02:57] Bathsheba that he could that he could
[1:03:00] try to secretly put away so now he can
[1:03:03] take Bathsheba to himself to be his wife
[1:03:06] and make it look like that he
[1:03:08] impregnated her after uriah's death and
[1:03:11] after he had taken her to his wife I
[1:03:14] mean what an evil plan but again this is
[1:03:17] a man after God's Own Heart but he's not
[1:03:19] a man after God's Own Heart because he
[1:03:21] was a perfect person right right he was
[1:03:24] a man after God's Own Heart because he
[1:03:26] was doing he was a man that would
[1:03:29] fulfill all the will of God now God also
[1:03:34] said he sent Samuel over to Saul of The
[1:03:38] Tribe of Benjamin to pick Saul out to be
[1:03:40] a king fact God didn't want him to have
[1:03:43] a kid that they're the ones that looked
[1:03:45] at other nations and said they wanted a
[1:03:47] king all these other nations around them
[1:03:50] had Kings and and potentates and and
[1:03:53] leaders over top of them to to Lord over
[1:03:56] them now there's nothing wrong with that
[1:03:59] because the benevolent King is the best
[1:04:02] form of government there is Brother Band
[1:04:04] said that yeah do you believe you look
[1:04:06] in the scripture and say that a
[1:04:08] benevolent dictator is the best kind of
[1:04:10] uh I guess that this gets in the wrong
[1:04:13] hands since we're such capitalists and
[1:04:16] all but uh and not that I'm against
[1:04:18] capitalism I uh I'm in favor of that but
[1:04:20] a benevolent dictatorship is the best
[1:04:22] form of government there is amen the
[1:04:24] problem is when a person in their
[1:04:26] Humanity gets to become dictator they
[1:04:29] don't be they're not benevolent for very
[1:04:31] long
[1:04:32] It all becomes serpent seeds selfish me
[1:04:35] first me only and the people get pressed
[1:04:38] down with everything so the benevolent
[1:04:40] part is the part that doesn't normally
[1:04:41] work out very well but God picked God
[1:04:45] hand-picked and sent Samuel to go anoint
[1:04:48] Saul to be king over the children of
[1:04:51] Israel and he did that and Saul was a
[1:04:53] great king saw one battle after battle
[1:04:56] after battle he was a good man he led
[1:04:58] the people but Saul started to get
[1:05:01] prideful
[1:05:03] and an evil spirit came on him
[1:05:06] David came into camp and an evil spirit
[1:05:08] came on salt
[1:05:11] he would have David come and play his
[1:05:13] harp and try to draw those evil spirits
[1:05:15] away just like we're working to preach
[1:05:18] and to play music to drive this evil
[1:05:20] spirit away but it would be to drive
[1:05:23] those evil spirits away uh and and David
[1:05:26] did it on many occasions but the people
[1:05:29] begin to like David so much that that
[1:05:32] that evil spirit that was on Saul
[1:05:34] started making him jealous the point he
[1:05:36] wanted to kill David
[1:05:38] well then then Saul by this evil spirit
[1:05:42] started to negate the will of God when
[1:05:45] he was King when he first was King Saul
[1:05:48] was a good King he did the will of God
[1:05:51] God hand-picked him and he started out
[1:05:54] right and he was doing good but when
[1:05:56] this evil spirit came on Saul he started
[1:05:58] he started doing less and less God's
[1:06:01] Will and more and more of his own will
[1:06:04] don't worry they got to uh the king agag
[1:06:07] and and God gave him Specific
[1:06:10] Instructions of what to do now of course
[1:06:13] God had already told uh Sally was going
[1:06:17] to get rid of him and not be king
[1:06:19] anymore and Saul begged and Samuel went
[1:06:22] to the Lord and and God said okay I'll
[1:06:24] give him another chance he says go down
[1:06:26] here and uh go to the king a gang and
[1:06:29] and utterly destroy everything that's
[1:06:31] Fallen refuse and and the animals and
[1:06:34] everything and and David and Saul only
[1:06:37] wanted to do what he wanted to do he was
[1:06:40] not willing to do and complete the will
[1:06:42] of God and he was so blinded to the fact
[1:06:45] that he was so arrogant and so selfish
[1:06:48] and had left also performing God's will
[1:06:52] that when Samuel came to him and said
[1:06:55] why have you not performed the will of
[1:06:57] God Samuel's Saul said I did
[1:07:01] I have done exactly what God Said dude
[1:07:04] that's how blinded he was that's how
[1:07:06] blinding that evil spirit can be yeah to
[1:07:10] not recognize that he did not do what
[1:07:12] God told him to do right yeah now he did
[1:07:15] part of what God told him to do but now
[1:07:18] look at the scripture again
[1:07:20] David wasn't a man after God's Own Heart
[1:07:22] because he did some of what God Said but
[1:07:25] he was a man after God's Own Heart
[1:07:27] because he shall fulfill all
[1:07:30] my will
[1:07:32] not part of it not some of it not most
[1:07:35] of it but he was the man after God's Own
[1:07:37] Heart because he shall fulfill all my
[1:07:41] will yes praise the Lord that's what it
[1:07:43] was all my will that's what God was
[1:07:46] looking for Saul got to the place that
[1:07:48] he was unwilling to do all of God's will
[1:07:52] and David and David was willing to do it
[1:07:55] with all of his faults with all of his
[1:07:58] mistakes
[1:07:59] and God then came to David and said and
[1:08:02] sent to Nathan and said and told David a
[1:08:06] story there was a rich man and a poor
[1:08:09] man and the rich man had everything the
[1:08:11] poor man had only one little you lamb
[1:08:13] but the rich man stole the one little
[1:08:16] you land from the one guy and and Nathan
[1:08:19] said what should happen to that rich man
[1:08:21] and David got so mad that he said that
[1:08:24] man should die
[1:08:26] and Nathan looked at him and said well
[1:08:28] you're that man
[1:08:30] you're that man David you're the one who
[1:08:33] took uriah's only prize only possession
[1:08:36] only belonging I guess you'd say is the
[1:08:39] thing that was his wife you you stole
[1:08:41] the man's wife he said I've given you
[1:08:43] everything
[1:08:45] Nathan told David David I took you from
[1:08:48] the Sheepfold and I made you King over
[1:08:50] my people I put you in this great palace
[1:08:53] I'll give you anything that you would
[1:08:55] want I've taken the wives and concubines
[1:08:57] that were before and gave everyone and
[1:08:59] brought every one of them into your
[1:09:01] bosom you had you had there was nothing
[1:09:04] of a limit to you David and anything
[1:09:06] that you needed beyond that I would have
[1:09:09] give it to you if you just
[1:09:12] you stole this man's
[1:09:14] wife you had him murdered and then you
[1:09:18] tried to cover it up before all the
[1:09:19] people now evil is going to come to your
[1:09:21] house and he will did come to David's
[1:09:23] house
[1:09:24] the sword he said the sword shall never
[1:09:26] because you used the sword to kill Uriah
[1:09:28] the sword will never depart out of your
[1:09:30] house and it did not
[1:09:32] amen evil shall rise in your family evil
[1:09:35] shall rise in your home and it did even
[1:09:37] so to the point that David was ousted by
[1:09:40] his own son from being King
[1:09:42] and he did David David reigned because
[1:09:46] uh Absalom uh kicked him out was able to
[1:09:49] gain favor with the people and ran David
[1:09:51] off
[1:09:52] and then his own son Absalom was was
[1:09:55] killed in battle and poor David was
[1:09:58] there and not only that but God told him
[1:10:00] and the baby that Bathsheba is carrying
[1:10:02] will die of also
[1:10:04] every bit of it happened exactly the way
[1:10:07] God said
[1:10:08] but yet David undeterred continued to do
[1:10:12] what God was telling him and what God's
[1:10:15] will was for him to do
[1:10:17] and Saints that's what that that's the
[1:10:20] thing that the Lord is calling for us to
[1:10:22] do amen
[1:10:24] yes we are to live Godly holy
[1:10:26] consecrated lives before the Lord I'm
[1:10:28] not saying anything to make excuse for
[1:10:31] that not at all especially now David
[1:10:33] didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:10:35] amen we have a dwelling presence we've
[1:10:38] been speaking on for 13 Sundays the Holy
[1:10:41] Spirit of God's life himself in us to
[1:10:43] lead us and guide us into and to change
[1:10:46] our nature of our soul owners uh our
[1:10:49] spirit and and even to our flesh
[1:10:51] absolutely but God
[1:10:53] the vision of God is Not on your
[1:10:56] mistakes is what the thing we fixate on
[1:10:58] the most is the things that we've done
[1:11:00] wrong because that's the devil trying to
[1:11:02] condemn you for things that you've done
[1:11:05] that you repent for that God has washed
[1:11:07] away
[1:11:09] God wants you to continue to move
[1:11:12] forward in the perfect will that he has
[1:11:15] laid before you yeah he wants you to
[1:11:17] walk according to in that narrow path
[1:11:20] according to the way that God has sent
[1:11:22] you because God has called you for this
[1:11:24] Duty not somebody else
[1:11:27] you might sit and say Lord I can't do
[1:11:29] this there's somebody else qualified
[1:11:31] that's not your business your business
[1:11:34] is to do what God has put before you and
[1:11:36] don't worry about whether you're
[1:11:38] qualified or not if God said run through
[1:11:40] that wall right there don't worry about
[1:11:42] it there'll be a wa there'll be a door
[1:11:44] when you get there
[1:11:47] but we worry about circumstances yeah we
[1:11:50] worry about issues we worry about
[1:11:52] roadblocks and things that we because we
[1:11:54] dealt with so much into the natural
[1:11:56] things that it starts getting into our
[1:11:58] mind we start reasoning and things
[1:12:00] instead of just taking God's word and
[1:12:03] saying God if that's what you want what
[1:12:05] you want me to do that's what I'm going
[1:12:06] to do
[1:12:07] hey man praise the Lord God will have it
[1:12:10] done God will it will be done according
[1:12:13] to God's will amen look
[1:12:17] let's look at the difference now
[1:12:19] I kind of draw this Romans chapter eight
[1:12:22] and kind of draw this out a little as
[1:12:24] the difference between Saul or what
[1:12:26] became Saul later the latter saw instead
[1:12:29] of the beginning saw and David
[1:12:34] went through the adversity David had a
[1:12:37] same problems David went through the
[1:12:40] same issues there wasn't a whole lot of
[1:12:42] difference between David and Saul's
[1:12:44] lives there really wasn't if you look at
[1:12:47] the two together parallel the only thing
[1:12:49] that became the problem again was that
[1:12:51] Saul became self-willed and David
[1:12:53] continued to do God's will
[1:12:56] that's that's the biggest difference
[1:12:57] that's why David was the man after God's
[1:13:01] Own Heart
[1:13:02] to fulfill all his will now look
[1:13:05] as you read this at the parallel between
[1:13:08] David and Saul and between
[1:13:11] what we in our lives desire for our
[1:13:14] lives to be amen gentle Shepherd Lead Me
[1:13:18] amen rather than what our will with our
[1:13:21] our personal human will would be God you
[1:13:23] lead us look Romans 8 1.
[1:13:26] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:13:29] no condemnation to them which are in
[1:13:31] Christ Jesus who want not after the
[1:13:34] flesh but after the spirit that goes
[1:13:36] right along when we read this of course
[1:13:37] before with our study there's no
[1:13:40] condemnation amen the soul that is Born
[1:13:43] Again cannot sin
[1:13:45] amen we might make mistakes but the soul
[1:13:48] that is Born Again cannot sin thus there
[1:13:52] is no condemnation which is exactly what
[1:13:55] the devil wants to do to you he wants to
[1:13:58] condemn you for the mistakes little
[1:14:00] things in humanity the flesh that
[1:14:02] happens in our lives basically daily
[1:14:05] amen maybe somewhere often than others
[1:14:08] and we're all individuals but there's no
[1:14:12] but that's what Satan wants to continue
[1:14:13] God does not condemn you
[1:14:16] he might convict you if you've done
[1:14:19] something wrong he might convict you if
[1:14:22] you you feel in your spirit Lord I
[1:14:23] should have done that I shouldn't have
[1:14:24] said that that's just conviction that's
[1:14:26] not condemnation condemnation is
[1:14:29] something that beats you down and tries
[1:14:31] to make you feel like you're less than
[1:14:32] what you are hey Mom amen conviction is
[1:14:35] just something to say straighten up you
[1:14:38] shouldn't do that don't do it next time
[1:14:40] this situation Rises don't act that way
[1:14:43] again don't talk that way again don't do
[1:14:46] that action again amen it's just
[1:14:48] convicted and say well praise the Lord
[1:14:50] okay I know God's mindful of me
[1:14:52] condemnation says you are a low down
[1:14:55] rank sinner remember make Heaven says
[1:14:57] that's the devil's tactics
[1:14:59] there's no condemnation
[1:15:02] to those that are in Christ Jesus who
[1:15:04] what walk after the flesh walk after the
[1:15:07] spirit and not after the flesh
[1:15:09] amen you're not to walk after the flesh
[1:15:12] but after the spirit there's our two
[1:15:13] different there's our differences the
[1:15:15] two guys amen the man that walked after
[1:15:17] the flesh the latter Saul was the man
[1:15:19] after the flesh
[1:15:20] he did part of what God Said do I mean
[1:15:22] the rest of it he wanted her to do
[1:15:24] himself and try to disguise it by saying
[1:15:27] well we wanted to take these animals and
[1:15:29] offer them to God that's why we kept
[1:15:31] them alive no you do what God Said do
[1:15:35] don't worry about the sacrifice to God
[1:15:37] you just do what he said that's the best
[1:15:39] the best sacrifice you can give
[1:15:42] us the best sacrifice you can offer to
[1:15:44] God is just do his will amen that's the
[1:15:47] best sacrifice but he wants to take
[1:15:48] these animals that God considered
[1:15:50] violent refuse and offer him to God
[1:15:53] that's a stink in God's nostril to take
[1:15:56] something that's smelling stinky and
[1:15:57] offer to God as a as a sacrifice
[1:16:01] oh my
[1:16:02] but that was Saul a man in the flesh
[1:16:05] versus David now we're not talking about
[1:16:08] mistakes
[1:16:09] we're talking about the will of God
[1:16:12] the will of God David said yes Lord
[1:16:15] continue to press on Amen with the will
[1:16:17] of the Lord
[1:16:18] Saul would not do it God told Saul
[1:16:21] something to do wouldn't do it part of
[1:16:23] it me David did walk not after the flesh
[1:16:26] but after the spirit
[1:16:28] now think of it in our context in our
[1:16:31] day with you personally with me us
[1:16:34] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:16:36] Christ Jesus has made me free from the
[1:16:39] law of sin and death
[1:16:41] for what the law could not do in that it
[1:16:44] was weak to the flesh God sending his
[1:16:47] own son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:16:50] and for sin condemns sin in the flesh
[1:16:53] that the righteousness of the law amen
[1:16:56] Christ himself the righteous one might
[1:17:00] be fulfilled in us who have now become
[1:17:04] the very righteousness of Jesus Christ
[1:17:07] praise the Lord amen
[1:17:10] who walked not after the flesh but after
[1:17:14] the spirit how are we walking
[1:17:16] we're walking by the spirit that's what
[1:17:19] the Bible says amen we don't even walk
[1:17:22] by the letter of the word per se
[1:17:24] it says we walk by the spirit
[1:17:27] amen the spirit that leads us praise the
[1:17:30] Lord it won't lead us into doing
[1:17:32] something contrary to the word but it's
[1:17:34] the spirit that leads us going back to
[1:17:37] our last 13 messages
[1:17:40] led by the spirit the holy spirit amen
[1:17:43] that leading can be the indwelling
[1:17:46] presence in your soul could also just be
[1:17:49] that simple anointing that's on you the
[1:17:51] anointing of the Holy Spirit on you to
[1:17:54] lead you and guide you into all truth
[1:17:57] it's after the spirit not after the
[1:17:59] flesh
[1:18:01] amen
[1:18:04] for those that are after The Flesh do
[1:18:07] mind the things of the flesh but they
[1:18:09] that are after the spirit the things of
[1:18:11] the spirit for to be carnally minded is
[1:18:13] dead
[1:18:14] but to be spiritually minded is light
[1:18:17] and peace why because the carnal mind
[1:18:19] will do what he wants to do the
[1:18:21] spiritual mind will do what God wants
[1:18:22] them to do
[1:18:23] because the carnal mind is enmity here
[1:18:26] we get done the carnal mind is enemy is
[1:18:29] an enemy against God enmity against God
[1:18:32] for it is not subject to the law of God
[1:18:34] neither indeed can be so then they that
[1:18:37] are in the flesh cannot please God
[1:18:41] if you're doing your own selfish will
[1:18:44] you cannot please God you can't do it
[1:18:47] amen but they that are but but ye that
[1:18:51] are not in the flesh but in the spirit
[1:18:53] is so be that the spirit of God dwell in
[1:18:57] you now if any man have not the spirit
[1:18:59] of Christ he is none of his now let's go
[1:19:01] over to the 26th verse
[1:19:04] led by the spirit versus being led by
[1:19:07] the flesh
[1:19:09] if you are led by the spirit of God not
[1:19:13] by your flesh you will you are
[1:19:17] a person after God's Own Heart because
[1:19:21] if you are led by the spirit you will
[1:19:24] fulfill all the will of God yes
[1:19:27] yes because God will lead you and guide
[1:19:29] you into the places the things he wants
[1:19:32] you to do
[1:19:33] now it's like we talked last week about
[1:19:35] that little wash woman it may have been
[1:19:37] that one thing but that woman lived her
[1:19:39] whole life before that time and after
[1:19:42] that time as just a woman of
[1:19:44] Just Another Woman
[1:19:46] but that one thing that God put on her
[1:19:49] heart to do she did it didn't see the
[1:19:51] result who gets the reward amen
[1:19:56] be walking by the spirit of God and you
[1:19:59] will not fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:20:01] if you're led by the spirit of God you
[1:20:04] will fulfill all the will of God if you
[1:20:08] fulfill all the will of God in your life
[1:20:10] you are a person after God's Own Heart
[1:20:13] just as much as David was I don't care
[1:20:16] any mistakes you ever made I don't care
[1:20:19] why literally to your secrets these are
[1:20:21] things people put you out for
[1:20:24] it does that's insignificant what the
[1:20:26] devil tries to put bring against you
[1:20:29] that is not what God looks at
[1:20:32] you're walking by the spirit
[1:20:34] amen you will fall and you will not
[1:20:36] fulfill the lust of the flesh you will
[1:20:38] do what God's will is for you to do
[1:20:40] which makes you a person after God's Own
[1:20:43] Heart
[1:20:44] praise the Lord that's why God chose you
[1:20:47] that's why God filled you with his
[1:20:49] Spirit that's what God puts you on the
[1:20:52] Forefront of this battle of this day
[1:20:53] this spiritual battle that takes place
[1:20:56] in in Heavenly places and and and high
[1:21:00] places of spirits you can't see he puts
[1:21:03] you at the Forefront he puts you up on
[1:21:05] this pardon me but on this pedestal the
[1:21:08] show this is my bride
[1:21:10] this is the one that I have looked for
[1:21:12] all these thousands of years that was to
[1:21:15] come the end time this is her praise God
[1:21:18] she does my will she does what I call
[1:21:22] she's led by my spirit and she does what
[1:21:24] I ask her to do she's a she's my wife
[1:21:27] and I love her after my own heart
[1:21:30] because she came from him yes praise the
[1:21:34] Lord
[1:21:35] Romans 8 26 likewise the spirit also
[1:21:40] helpeth our infirmities
[1:21:42] the spirit helps when we do wrong when
[1:21:45] mistakes we make we're infirmities that
[1:21:47] we have the spirit helps there you're
[1:21:49] led by the spirit but that Spirit also
[1:21:52] helps our infirmities
[1:21:55] our shortcomings wrongdoings of
[1:21:58] sicknesses for we know not what we
[1:22:01] should pray for as we ought
[1:22:04] but the spirit itself make an
[1:22:07] intercession for us with groanings which
[1:22:10] cannot be uttered that's why the prayer
[1:22:13] that we have is not our own it's a
[1:22:15] relinquishing into the spirit so that
[1:22:18] the spirit can it be needs be pray
[1:22:21] through us
[1:22:22] what he wants to be said what he once
[1:22:25] accomplished so that we know what is
[1:22:29] this this is the perfect will of God
[1:22:31] and each one of it's very individual and
[1:22:34] then I think she put that the last
[1:22:36] chapter of my book praying to God is a
[1:22:38] very individual thing
[1:22:40] people try to
[1:22:42] mold themselves or match uh someone else
[1:22:46] or their prayer life or something
[1:22:48] prayer prayer to me is nothing more than
[1:22:52] talking to God right amen but prayer
[1:22:54] have people have made prayer to be
[1:22:57] something that they want others to hear
[1:22:59] don't make prayer be something you want
[1:23:02] others to hear make your prayer to be
[1:23:05] what you want to talk to God about yeah
[1:23:08] that's all and that's what prayer is
[1:23:11] it's communication you talk to God you
[1:23:15] you express to God verbally orally what
[1:23:18] you want to express to him he many times
[1:23:22] will Express back to us Maybe not
[1:23:24] audibly maybe not at that time well it
[1:23:27] will Express back to us the the
[1:23:29] utterances that he gives to us that's in
[1:23:32] the spirits ain't that that's a
[1:23:35] communication it's it's between God and
[1:23:37] His maker or between man and his maker
[1:23:40] see that we that we talk to and
[1:23:43] communicate with God does that
[1:23:47] groaning she can be uttered uh
[1:23:50] sometimes I pray things and I think why
[1:23:52] did I say that yeah
[1:23:54] yeah and then come to find out
[1:23:56] not all times but sometimes come to find
[1:23:59] out I know why it came out of my mouth
[1:24:02] it was something the Lord was trying to
[1:24:03] show me or tell me because if it's in my
[1:24:05] private time or something it's just you
[1:24:08] talk to God just speak to God Amen
[1:24:13] and her mother another brother tell me
[1:24:15] one time about you know praying in these
[1:24:17] and vowels and uh there's nothing right
[1:24:20] that's how you talk that's how you want
[1:24:22] to talk to God there's nothing wrong
[1:24:23] with that but then it starts building up
[1:24:26] into people like this great something
[1:24:27] they're supposed to do
[1:24:29] it's not something extraordinary or
[1:24:31] great just just talk to the Lord yes
[1:24:33] amen that's all it is communication
[1:24:36] and he that searches the hearts knoweth
[1:24:39] what is the mind of the spirit because
[1:24:42] he make an intercession for the Saints
[1:24:44] according to according to what the will
[1:24:48] of God
[1:24:49] you make an intercession for you
[1:24:51] according to the will of God
[1:24:54] that's why we accept the will of God
[1:24:56] that's why it goes back to this little
[1:24:58] boy that brother Brown talked about that
[1:25:00] his mommy was sick and he had this
[1:25:02] prayer book he just kept trying to find
[1:25:04] this prayer book and he kept trying to
[1:25:06] read prayers out of this book and
[1:25:07] expecting his mommy to be better and his
[1:25:10] mommy died you throw the prayer book in
[1:25:12] the fire and forgot about God and seeing
[1:25:15] this problem was some church some
[1:25:17] denomination or some body of position
[1:25:20] trying to teach someone this is what you
[1:25:22] want to pray to God just read out of
[1:25:24] this book that's not what it's about
[1:25:26] right and his mommy died why didn't his
[1:25:29] mommy die probably because I'll say it
[1:25:32] was the will of God
[1:25:34] amen that's why we accept the will of
[1:25:37] God I've told you Saints several times
[1:25:40] about when the Lord spoke to me about my
[1:25:42] sister
[1:25:43] I prayed for him prayed for it I was
[1:25:46] headed back from Flagstaff to Show Low
[1:25:48] and I just pray she came on my heart I
[1:25:50] turned uh I turned around I think he had
[1:25:53] brother brown or turned it off and I
[1:25:55] started praying and she was the focal
[1:25:57] point of my prayer Lord that God stopped
[1:25:59] me and said quit praying for her
[1:26:01] I said Lord why he said cause it's time
[1:26:04] for me to take her and I can't do it
[1:26:07] when you keep asking for her to be well
[1:26:10] I mean I'd just be bluntly honest things
[1:26:12] right yeah yeah and I said okay Lord
[1:26:15] I love her but I'm willing to let her go
[1:26:17] yes because I know she's going to better
[1:26:19] place anyway and I'll see her soon right
[1:26:21] I quit praying for her from that time
[1:26:22] and like he was like two weeks later she
[1:26:24] was gone Lord Tucker we found out like a
[1:26:27] week later called and we all flew out
[1:26:30] there and got to see her right before
[1:26:31] she passed it get to talk to her again
[1:26:33] or talk to her but no communication
[1:26:36] issues of comatose basically at that
[1:26:38] point in the last stages of her passing
[1:26:40] but the Lord took her then amen because
[1:26:43] it was the will of God and see if we can
[1:26:46] just look to understand that let our
[1:26:49] will be molded by God's will
[1:26:52] what is the mind of the spirit because
[1:26:55] God make an intercession for the Saints
[1:26:58] he makes intercession for us not
[1:27:01] according to our will but according to
[1:27:04] his will
[1:27:05] my will to would be to still have my
[1:27:08] sister here
[1:27:09] that would be my will my will would
[1:27:11] still to be have my mom and my dad here
[1:27:13] that would be my will my brother but
[1:27:16] that wasn't God's will
[1:27:18] but God makes intercession based on his
[1:27:22] will not mine
[1:27:24] and I accept by the spirit of God that
[1:27:27] is in me that I am led by the spirit of
[1:27:29] God God's perfect will even if the
[1:27:32] prayer that is praying to God
[1:27:35] did not come the way I wanted it to come
[1:27:39] amen
[1:27:41] I don't know that I've ever prayed any
[1:27:43] harder
[1:27:44] than when my first son was in distress
[1:27:49] and it looked very bleak
[1:27:52] and he basically from the moment he was
[1:27:54] born started to die
[1:27:57] and all the humanity that I could have
[1:27:59] in myself would look
[1:28:01] and say my sons dying
[1:28:04] but everything that I could possibly
[1:28:06] muster in my spirit in my life said God
[1:28:08] don't let it happen
[1:28:11] I I don't want him to go
[1:28:14] but it wasn't according to my will
[1:28:18] it was according to God's will
[1:28:21] then God sends the Blessed Assurance
[1:28:23] right that he always gives
[1:28:26] to know that according to his perfect
[1:28:28] will he makes everything work together
[1:28:29] which is our next scripture it makes
[1:28:32] everything work together for our good if
[1:28:35] we love it
[1:28:37] this past week I was able to talk to a
[1:28:39] man who is on a different team
[1:28:42] who is having financial trouble so he
[1:28:44] worked an extra week if you could do
[1:28:46] that if you want if you work and have a
[1:28:48] week off you can work uh you can work
[1:28:51] every week if you want they'll just take
[1:28:53] you and put you on another team and you
[1:28:55] work that week for that team
[1:28:57] with this guy's on somebody else's team
[1:28:59] he was working in his off week and he
[1:29:02] was working with a team that got paired
[1:29:05] with our team two days before we were
[1:29:07] supposed to leave
[1:29:09] Thursday three days
[1:29:12] Thursday Friday Saturday Sun three days
[1:29:14] before we were supposed to leave this
[1:29:16] team we were supposed to be on our own
[1:29:19] our team this week at this job and that
[1:29:21] man was put on that team at the last
[1:29:23] minute that team was paired with us at
[1:29:26] the last minute so that man would be in
[1:29:28] the same tunnel working with me at the
[1:29:30] same time right
[1:29:32] and thank God I got to speak to the man
[1:29:34] because his son had just passed away
[1:29:36] 14 years old lost a daughter before and
[1:29:40] and by the grace of God I didn't spend a
[1:29:43] whole lot of time with it I didn't try
[1:29:45] to push anything on him and or I didn't
[1:29:47] read him any Scripture I just reassured
[1:29:50] him and I just helped to strengthen him
[1:29:53] in some way if I could to help him
[1:29:55] realize that there's God's doing
[1:29:58] something amen God is doing there's a
[1:30:01] reason for it
[1:30:02] amen and I thank God for the opportunity
[1:30:05] to be able to do that because you never
[1:30:07] know but I I kept trying to find the
[1:30:11] time of the the perfect place time to
[1:30:16] speak to this man and I kept thinking
[1:30:18] well Lord I'll do it now and you know
[1:30:21] how you just you just got something you
[1:30:23] just want to do and you try to force it
[1:30:25] right you know brother random did that
[1:30:28] God will show him a vision that
[1:30:30] everything is the way it was and and he
[1:30:33] could be in the place for hours
[1:30:35] and it not be the way it was in the
[1:30:37] vision
[1:30:38] and and brother Brown would go and say
[1:30:39] okay let's start prayer now nothing
[1:30:42] happened
[1:30:43] and so why God why is nothing happening
[1:30:45] it wasn't according to God's will right
[1:30:48] God's will is what he showed him in the
[1:30:51] vision how many of us don't get Vision
[1:30:53] so we don't have that to fall on but it
[1:30:56] wasn't according to God's Will and the
[1:30:57] vision
[1:30:59] but when the vision came and see
[1:31:02] I believe there's this one vision
[1:31:04] the only thing that was out of cater
[1:31:06] from the vision was a hat
[1:31:08] a hat had to be moved from one place to
[1:31:11] the other and brother Brown could not be
[1:31:14] the one to go move that hat
[1:31:16] because he knew what the vision was
[1:31:18] right he could have just as easily as a
[1:31:21] human went over and put it where it was
[1:31:23] in a vision but that wouldn't have not
[1:31:25] been God's will
[1:31:27] he had to wait
[1:31:29] and carry until somehow that hat got put
[1:31:33] exactly where it's supposed to be when
[1:31:34] that when that Vision fulfilled itself
[1:31:37] he could go in there with the authority
[1:31:39] of God and say in Jesus Christ's name
[1:31:42] get up and walk or whatever you be well
[1:31:44] yeah
[1:31:45] and she was
[1:31:49] so many times that week I tried to force
[1:31:51] a conversation to talk to this man or
[1:31:53] try to find a spot and it just never
[1:31:55] worked out
[1:31:56] until Friday
[1:32:01] it it he came out one door I came in the
[1:32:04] other door and we were right there
[1:32:06] together and looked at each other and it
[1:32:07] clicked I said this is it
[1:32:10] that's when the time to be able to speak
[1:32:12] to him because
[1:32:14] it isn't just what you do a lot of times
[1:32:17] it's how you do it and when you do it
[1:32:19] yes that that makes the perfect will of
[1:32:22] God
[1:32:22] just doing something is is just being
[1:32:25] busy but doing and and you can be I'm
[1:32:28] not saying don't be busy for the Lord uh
[1:32:31] but but it's can I say it this way it's
[1:32:34] just better to be busy for the Lord
[1:32:36] according to God's Will and not
[1:32:38] according to your will and what you
[1:32:40] think or how you think or where you
[1:32:43] think or when you think
[1:32:45] let it be what God is doing and what he
[1:32:48] leads you to do yes and then God's will
[1:32:51] will be performed
[1:32:53] amen as God would do according to the
[1:32:56] intercession
[1:32:58] by his will not our will right
[1:33:01] and we know
[1:33:03] that all things work together for uh for
[1:33:07] good to them that love God to them who
[1:33:10] are the called according to his purpose
[1:33:12] so if you love God not just have some
[1:33:16] affinity for them or you just like
[1:33:18] hanging around or something but if you
[1:33:19] really true love God unconditionally
[1:33:23] if he might take your firstborn or if
[1:33:27] catastrophic things might happen or
[1:33:29] whatever it is destroy your home take he
[1:33:33] took everything job having his wife
[1:33:34] really
[1:33:36] amen and job praised God worship God
[1:33:40] even when his wife turned against him
[1:33:43] the most dear thing in his life I'd say
[1:33:45] it's the most dear thing it was the most
[1:33:46] dear thing in my life so I figure my
[1:33:49] wife's the most dear thing in my life
[1:33:50] every husband should feel the same way
[1:33:52] maybe he didn't but I would think that
[1:33:54] he did and she turned on it and he said
[1:33:58] you speaking like a foolish woman you
[1:34:01] listen too much Oprah you need to turn
[1:34:02] that thing off amen you're talking like
[1:34:05] a worldly person shall we expect things
[1:34:07] from God and God take things from us and
[1:34:10] we give him glory when he gives us up
[1:34:12] and curse him when he takes it
[1:34:14] now what kind of a Christian is that
[1:34:16] right right it's not one the Lord gives
[1:34:19] and the Lord takes away blessed be the
[1:34:22] name of the Lord right amen praise God
[1:34:24] and all this job did not sin with his
[1:34:27] mouth
[1:34:28] according to the scripture praise the
[1:34:30] Lord all things work together for our
[1:34:32] good if we love him
[1:34:35] that's the problem a lot of people get
[1:34:36] into they don't love God unconditionally
[1:34:38] they might love some of the things he's
[1:34:40] done for them they might love the
[1:34:42] sensation you're feeling or they might
[1:34:44] love the uh have an affinity for the
[1:34:47] attraction and the Brotherhood and
[1:34:48] things like that but they don't really
[1:34:50] love God unconditionally
[1:34:54] if you don't love God unconditionally it
[1:34:56] doesn't work right it won't work for you
[1:34:58] amen amen you've got to trust him he's
[1:35:01] interceding according to his perfect
[1:35:03] will not mine
[1:35:04] amen
[1:35:06] not mine little boy wanted his mother to
[1:35:08] live I don't blame him I want my mom to
[1:35:10] live too
[1:35:11] amen but when it comes down to it Lord
[1:35:14] not my will but your will be done amen
[1:35:17] amen that is not a lack of faith to make
[1:35:21] that statement is not a lack of faith
[1:35:24] amen no sir it is you wanting the desire
[1:35:28] in your life of God's will for you and
[1:35:32] for everybody that uh but but in your
[1:35:36] life you want God's will saying Lord
[1:35:39] your will be done uh not let my will die
[1:35:43] to your will is not a lack of faith if
[1:35:46] it is then Jesus had a lack of faith
[1:35:48] because he said the same thing
[1:35:50] In The Garden of Gethsemane did Jesus
[1:35:52] not say not my will but thine be none
[1:35:54] right
[1:35:55] but people will crucify you for making
[1:35:57] that statement and say you just don't
[1:35:59] believe
[1:36:00] yes I do
[1:36:01] I believe that I want what God's perfect
[1:36:04] will in my life is to be fulfilled I
[1:36:06] believe that one
[1:36:07] whatever it might be
[1:36:09] whatever it might be the will of God
[1:36:12] first Peter that's a couple more
[1:36:14] scriptures I'm going to close here
[1:36:17] amen so we walk it's a relationship as
[1:36:20] you turn over to First Peter chapter
[1:36:21] four it's a relationship
[1:36:24] if it's not a relationship you'll never
[1:36:26] understand it
[1:36:27] amen if it's a relationship then you can
[1:36:30] have that relationship not with the
[1:36:32] pastor not with one another with Jesus
[1:36:34] Christ amen our relationship is with
[1:36:37] Christ not with brother Branham not with
[1:36:40] ourselves uh with with our friends
[1:36:42] family our relationship this spiritual
[1:36:45] relationship is with is with Jesus
[1:36:47] Christ
[1:36:48] him alone walking after the spirit is to
[1:36:51] walk in Christ
[1:36:53] with with him relation amen First Peter
[1:36:58] chapter four
[1:37:01] for uh chapter 4 verse 12. beloved
[1:37:04] think it not strange concerning the
[1:37:07] fiery trials which is to try you as
[1:37:10] though some strange thing has happened
[1:37:12] to you
[1:37:14] but rejoice
[1:37:16] fiery trials now rejoice inasmuch as ye
[1:37:20] are partakers of Christ's suffering that
[1:37:22] when his glory shall be revealed he may
[1:37:25] be glad also with exceeding Joy well
[1:37:29] that just goes back basically to what
[1:37:30] job said
[1:37:33] we don't praise God when he gives us
[1:37:36] stuff and curse him when he takes it
[1:37:37] away
[1:37:38] amen we go through fiery trust why do we
[1:37:41] consider that something extraordinary
[1:37:44] it's not we consider ourselves in by
[1:37:47] walking by the spirit the sufferings of
[1:37:50] Christ so that when the glory of God is
[1:37:52] revealed we're there with him
[1:37:55] and that glory is revealed in US
[1:37:58] praise the Lord
[1:38:01] oh
[1:38:04] amen exceeding Joy 14th verse now if ye
[1:38:08] be reproached for the name of Christ
[1:38:10] happy are you for the spirit of glory
[1:38:13] and of God resteth upon you on their
[1:38:15] part he is evil spoken of but on your
[1:38:17] parties glorified
[1:38:19] but let none of you suffer as murmur uh
[1:38:22] as murder as a or as a thief or as an
[1:38:26] evil doer or as a busybody in other
[1:38:28] man's matters
[1:38:30] If any man suffer as a Christian let him
[1:38:33] not be ashamed but let him glorify God
[1:38:36] on his on this behalf and he's saying if
[1:38:38] you're just being an evil person and
[1:38:40] you're suffering you're in jail because
[1:38:42] she stole a car that's your fault
[1:38:45] that's not God's fault you don't say oh
[1:38:48] woe is me because you killed a person
[1:38:50] and you're in jail for it
[1:38:52] that's your fault that's not God's fault
[1:38:55] but when you suffer as you are living
[1:38:57] the will of God
[1:38:59] as a Christian then count it all glory
[1:39:02] see don't be ashamed of that
[1:39:05] for the time has come that judgment must
[1:39:08] begin at the house of God
[1:39:10] and if it first began at us what shall
[1:39:14] the end be of them that obey not the
[1:39:16] gospel of God and if the righteous
[1:39:19] scarcely be saved where shall the sin
[1:39:21] the ungodly and The Sinner appear
[1:39:24] wherefore let him that suffer according
[1:39:26] to the will of according to what suffer
[1:39:29] according to what the will of God
[1:39:32] amen not according to your
[1:39:36] mistakes or things you've done
[1:39:39] amen but according to the will of God
[1:39:44] commit the keeping of their souls to him
[1:39:47] and well-doing as unto a faithful
[1:39:49] creator
[1:39:51] amen
[1:39:53] only according to the will of God
[1:39:58] two more quick scriptures and I'm going
[1:39:59] to close Mark chapter 3.
[1:40:03] Mark chapter 3 verse 35
[1:40:08] Mark 3 35 says for whosoever shall do
[1:40:11] the will of God listen this whosoever
[1:40:14] shall do the will of God the same as my
[1:40:16] brother and my sister my mother
[1:40:18] who what does the will of God
[1:40:22] not some of it all of it all the will of
[1:40:26] God
[1:40:27] one more Saint John chapter 7. now this
[1:40:30] is very important this is something a
[1:40:33] lot of people seem to negate forget
[1:40:34] about but this is a very important
[1:40:37] scripture Saint John chapter 7 verse 16.
[1:40:40] Jesus answered them and said my Doctrine
[1:40:43] is not mine people want to Major on
[1:40:46] Doctrine all the time even though we're
[1:40:48] led by the spirit they want a major on
[1:40:51] Doctrine all the time or or on gifts
[1:40:53] tongues that kind of thing
[1:40:56] my Doctrine is not mine but his that
[1:40:59] sent me
[1:41:00] well it would that not be the same for
[1:41:02] all of us well if we believe we're sent
[1:41:04] by God shall be the same amen then it's
[1:41:08] not mine it's his which means I don't
[1:41:10] have a thought coming I just say what he
[1:41:13] tells me to say I'd say what he puts
[1:41:15] what he puts in his word amen
[1:41:18] praise the Lord
[1:41:19] If any man now this is it now listen
[1:41:22] real close we'll close if any man will
[1:41:24] do his will
[1:41:26] ye shall know of the doctrine whether it
[1:41:30] be of God or whether I speak of myself
[1:41:33] if you do the will of God see that's why
[1:41:36] people they forget about they say well
[1:41:38] uh I I talked about it uh brother green
[1:41:42] talked about it a lot uh when when you
[1:41:46] people would say something spoke to you
[1:41:48] or or something tingled in you or
[1:41:50] something like that uh many times I'll
[1:41:53] say it it either rings the bell or
[1:41:55] doesn't something that that connects to
[1:41:58] you
[1:41:59] if you do the will of God
[1:42:02] you will know
[1:42:04] if this is of God or not
[1:42:07] if you do the will of God there's no
[1:42:10] debate to me now people can say what
[1:42:13] they want they leave this message left
[1:42:15] and right but if you do the will of God
[1:42:17] you will know that this message is the
[1:42:21] truth
[1:42:22] you will know that brother Rana was the
[1:42:25] prophet of God for this day send by God
[1:42:28] to bring a message to a bride to dress
[1:42:31] her and get her ready for a Rapture
[1:42:33] there is no debate amen and to me since
[1:42:37] there is no debate
[1:42:39] I don't concern myself with other I know
[1:42:42] what his word says and in my life to do
[1:42:44] the will of God I don't worry about that
[1:42:46] now if I go and listen to somebody else
[1:42:49] or something like I've said before I've
[1:42:52] heard of the ministers at time and
[1:42:53] nothing I'd say recently because
[1:42:55] honestly I don't listen to a lot of
[1:42:57] other ministers very very seldom do I
[1:43:00] unless they're preaching from this
[1:43:01] Pulpit very soon God told me not to one
[1:43:05] day
[1:43:07] get to involve people give me tapes and
[1:43:10] a DVD here or a tape here or something
[1:43:12] here and something there and found
[1:43:14] myself trying to preach like them and
[1:43:16] say what they said and preach on their
[1:43:18] Revelation and stuff that they had that
[1:43:20] was so deep from God even though I
[1:43:21] didn't understand it God said quit doing
[1:43:24] that right
[1:43:25] I said yes sir Lord I took them and I
[1:43:27] put them away
[1:43:29] never seen one since
[1:43:31] because I want to do what he wants me to
[1:43:33] do and now whatever the Lord gives me it
[1:43:35] comes straight to me from him right amen
[1:43:38] come straight to me and if it doesn't
[1:43:40] I'll say it again if it doesn't ring
[1:43:43] that Bell and me then I I just pushed to
[1:43:47] the side I don't say the brother's wrong
[1:43:49] I don't say the sister's wrong I don't
[1:43:51] say that I'm writing everything and
[1:43:54] they're wrong and everything I just put
[1:43:56] it to the side because it doesn't strike
[1:43:57] with me I can't match it in the word I
[1:44:01] can't find it in the message which is
[1:44:02] come from the word then I I leave it
[1:44:05] alone
[1:44:06] that's not what the Lord and I've had
[1:44:09] people come and say well you need to do
[1:44:11] this you need to do that I said I'm
[1:44:12] going to tell you something and I'll
[1:44:14] tell every one of you here if you're
[1:44:15] watching I got one thing I am to do and
[1:44:18] that's to do what he tells me to do not
[1:44:20] you
[1:44:21] I'm not going to preach something
[1:44:22] somebody tells me yeah you need to
[1:44:24] preach on this no I need to preach
[1:44:25] exactly what God gives me to preach
[1:44:27] period now if it happens to some come
[1:44:30] come to that point okay but if God does
[1:44:33] it there we are that's the only thing I
[1:44:35] am obligated to obey is what the Lord
[1:44:38] tells me and shows me to do and by his
[1:44:41] grace I do the best I can I'm not
[1:44:43] perfect
[1:44:44] we all make mistakes do things maybe
[1:44:46] even get in our minds or something but I
[1:44:48] try to do what the Lord tells me to do
[1:44:50] not what anybody else tells me to do and
[1:44:52] you that's only an example in my heart
[1:44:54] of what I try you've got to do the same
[1:44:57] every one of you don't have to be a
[1:44:58] minister to follow that uh that analogy
[1:45:01] every one of us Falls in that category
[1:45:04] to do just what the will of God is for
[1:45:06] you amen if you feel it's God's will God
[1:45:09] will bring you into that place and
[1:45:11] everything will work out together for
[1:45:13] your good
[1:45:14] because you're obeying the will of God
[1:45:16] why was David
[1:45:18] a man after God's Own Heart
[1:45:22] why was he
[1:45:24] because he's fulfill all the will of God
[1:45:29] amen
[1:45:30] Saints I'm here to tell you you're born
[1:45:32] of the spirit filled it's filled with
[1:45:34] the spirit born again you follow the
[1:45:36] will of God
[1:45:38] if you fulfill all the will of God in
[1:45:40] your life not your mistakes not the
[1:45:43] things Satan keeps trying to continue
[1:45:44] with but the perfect will of God for
[1:45:47] your life you are as much at the heart
[1:45:50] of God as David was
[1:45:52] in the scripture
[1:45:53] amen because we belong to him just as
[1:45:56] much as you taken from him as a part of
[1:45:59] him we came from him we're going back to
[1:46:02] him
[1:46:03] and in the meantime we just try to do
[1:46:06] everything that God puts us before us to
[1:46:08] do
[1:46:08] amen and that's all we can do that's all
[1:46:11] God expects of us amen and expect some
[1:46:15] great thing to happen we're all not
[1:46:18] every minister in the message is
[1:46:19] supposed to have 10 000 people in their
[1:46:21] congregation
[1:46:23] amen it was funny we were sitting at
[1:46:26] dinner Friday night and we were talking
[1:46:27] about because our manager is supposed to
[1:46:29] be retiring next year and whether we're
[1:46:30] going to the rest of our team doesn't
[1:46:32] want to work really with any other teams
[1:46:34] we're like we should just talk with
[1:46:36] because I I mean what's going to happen
[1:46:37] so we talk about and I think well I just
[1:46:40] wonder what the Lord's got for me next
[1:46:42] because I've been a teacher I've been a
[1:46:44] realtor I've been a pastor Minister uh
[1:46:48] I've been a purchasing manager
[1:46:51] um I've been an Uber driver of what
[1:46:54] forget all the best so I wonder what's
[1:46:56] kind of electrician I wonder what's
[1:46:58] coming next
[1:46:59] I'm a manager looked at me and said well
[1:47:01] I think the car wash Builder's the best
[1:47:03] one I said well that's what they told me
[1:47:05] in school too that I missed my calling
[1:47:07] so all I know is just when the Lord puts
[1:47:09] it before me that's all I know to do I
[1:47:13] wasn't looking for the job with brother
[1:47:14] Roger
[1:47:15] uh I was helping driving around like K
[1:47:18] and different ones and helping Mary and
[1:47:21] getting enough money and the Lord
[1:47:23] blessed to live by and brother Roger
[1:47:25] calls me up and says you want you want
[1:47:27] to work uh one I need some help you want
[1:47:29] to help me one day I said sure he's my
[1:47:31] buddies my friend I'll go help him well
[1:47:33] I didn't know he wanted me to help him
[1:47:35] as a job every day
[1:47:37] it turned into a whole job that lasted
[1:47:39] two years which propelled me into this
[1:47:41] next job when I was when
[1:47:44] um uh Julie talked to him I didn't want
[1:47:47] to talk to the man I was not interested
[1:47:49] at all I was happy where I was uh I was
[1:47:53] glad to be working with a brother and I
[1:47:55] was happy with brother Roger and the man
[1:47:57] called me and asked me to meet him I
[1:48:00] didn't call him I said I don't I told
[1:48:02] Julie I don't want his number she said
[1:48:04] well I'm sorry but I already gave you
[1:48:05] his number I said well that's okay he'll
[1:48:07] call me and I'll either say no or hear
[1:48:09] what he has to say and everybody had to
[1:48:12] say and we met on down in Sarita and he
[1:48:14] said well this is the job whether you
[1:48:16] wonder if you want it it's yours if you
[1:48:18] don't and now I come to find out
[1:48:22] he didn't hire anybody like that
[1:48:25] nobody that I know has been hired like
[1:48:27] that everybody else said well what's
[1:48:30] your experience what do you know your
[1:48:32] resume doesn't match your your
[1:48:34] application I didn't even put an
[1:48:36] application in
[1:48:37] I only sent a resume to him a few words
[1:48:41] after he hired me just to put it on file
[1:48:45] I won't even spot
[1:48:47] so when God does it you don't have to
[1:48:49] worry about all the other yes just
[1:48:51] fulfill the will of God and God will
[1:48:53] take care of the rest amen now if it
[1:48:56] comes at some time
[1:48:57] before I retire before the Lord takes us
[1:49:00] home it goes to something else I don't
[1:49:02] know astronaut who else is left I know I
[1:49:06] can't do that I get sick
[1:49:09] what else has the Lord got in store I
[1:49:11] don't know but he's got something for
[1:49:13] everyone of us amen and then uh the guy
[1:49:16] that was the curmudges really a good
[1:49:19] friend now buddy uh he said well if you
[1:49:22] have enough people in your church you
[1:49:23] wouldn't have to have a second job I
[1:49:25] well whatever the Lord Wills that's okay
[1:49:27] if it's that way that's fine I don't
[1:49:29] mind working don't mind at all amen but
[1:49:32] it's according to whatever he does
[1:49:34] whatever he says that's what I want to
[1:49:37] do amen that's all I know to do so let's
[1:49:40] stand if we could
[1:49:42] all right
[1:49:48] amen I'm thankful that the Lord shows us
[1:49:53] reveals to us if you will
[1:49:56] the things that he wants us to do and
[1:50:00] if we don't if we don't look for
[1:50:02] Revelation if we don't believe in
[1:50:03] Revelation
[1:50:04] look for Revelation then
[1:50:07] how could how can we get a revelation
[1:50:10] from God how can he show us things
[1:50:13] if we don't even believe it amen
[1:50:17] it must be something that's in our
[1:50:19] hearts
[1:50:20] it must be a genuine desire
[1:50:22] amen when I talk to the Lord about
[1:50:25] getting rid of this place next door I
[1:50:27] don't do it out of spite then I don't
[1:50:29] begrudge the man of earning a living
[1:50:31] like anybody he can earn a living he's a
[1:50:35] man and he has a right to that as much
[1:50:37] as any of us do just don't do it here
[1:50:41] that guy that was next door he wants to
[1:50:44] put ink all over people that's his
[1:50:46] choice if people want to go to him and
[1:50:48] have ink put all over by him that's
[1:50:50] their choice just don't do it there
[1:50:52] there's all kinds of places around here
[1:50:54] just don't do it here that's my only cry
[1:50:57] I'm not against the guy I've worked over
[1:50:59] there a couple times a nice guy but
[1:51:02] just not here amen that's that's my
[1:51:06] heart see

[1:54:06] we do we do as unto the Lord amen praise
[1:54:09] God say that so many times say that to
[1:54:12] the guys at work amen I do what I do is
[1:54:16] unto the Lord I told him even my manager
[1:54:19] said I I don't I don't consider myself
[1:54:22] working for me I take instruction from
[1:54:24] you I don't consider myself working for
[1:54:26] Tom or John why the president of the
[1:54:29] company I work for the Lord
[1:54:31] amen and that's my whole life is to try
[1:54:36] to
[1:54:38] do what I can
[1:54:40] to be an example
[1:54:44] the guy that I told you all at work
[1:54:46] that quit drinking he's still quit he's
[1:54:49] still not drinking and I noticed the
[1:54:51] other day he found his headed for a meal
[1:54:54] never seen any of them do that the other
[1:54:57] day
[1:55:00] my man my manager told me this week he's
[1:55:03] trying to quit cussing
[1:55:04] I could have I could have told him I
[1:55:07] said well give your life to the Lord
[1:55:08] Jesus and that thing will go away
[1:55:11] but I said well good for you
[1:55:14] he hasn't yet but he said he's trying
[1:55:17] anyway so

[1:55:24] happen regardless of whether people
[1:55:27] recognize it or not amen or even us

[1:55:33] part of the economy of God part of the
[1:55:36] family of God whatever the Lord gives us
[1:55:39] shows us that's what we want to do
