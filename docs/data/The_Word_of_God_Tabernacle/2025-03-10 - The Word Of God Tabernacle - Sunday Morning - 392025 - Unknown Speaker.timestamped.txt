[31:21] is but the body creates like a barrier
[31:23] around something um so when the appendix
[31:26] burst the abscess caught it
[31:28] so that it didn't spread through his
[31:30] body oh my and the likelihood of that
[31:32] happening in the way that it did is just
[31:34] absolutely Miracle just typically as
[31:37] most of you probably know if you have a
[31:38] a ptis and at first you have minutes
[31:41] till you go to the sepsis and die so
[31:43] it's only a miracle that he had the
[31:45] abess growing on the appendix so that
[31:47] when it did burst they caught it kind of
[31:49] like a balloon and saved his life so he
[31:52] has a he has a drain in it now and it's
[31:54] draining because they can't take it out
[31:56] till it's drained so it's for five days
[31:58] or so but Tuesday he's supposed to go
[32:00] get the draining removed and check and
[32:03] make sure that it's they can take it out
[32:06] wow my goodness what a testimony you
[32:10] imagine goodness that's you would think
[32:14] the worst thing in the world is to have
[32:15] an abess growing on an organ or or
[32:18] theual organ in your body and wow that
[32:22] thing needs to be removed well it's a
[32:23] good thing he didn't have it removed
[32:25] because it sounds like that could have
[32:26] been what saved his life
[32:29] M well God knows amen there's always a
[32:32] reason there a reason the Lord does this
[32:34] reason the Lord put mik in his life you
[32:36] never know amen God's always in control
[32:39] God's always in charge we just let him
[32:42] keep doing it just keep walking the walk
[32:43] as he Footsteps in front of us that's
[32:46] all we know to do amen but that's the
[32:48] best thing we can do praise the Lord
[32:50] people talk about all the time this that
[32:52] the other and and I understand finding
[32:54] the will of the Lord in life AB
[32:56] absolutely you know but sometimes
[32:57] sometimes it's just a matter of taking a
[32:59] step at a time and just trusting him
[33:01] amen just take another step and just
[33:03] keep trusting him let him take care of
[33:05] it amen praise the Lord some people
[33:08] sometimes people call it Blind Faith um
[33:12] it really is you trust the Lord Jesus
[33:15] emphatically you know he's going to take
[33:18] care of you period and that's I guess
[33:20] that's Blind Faith that's all right as
[33:22] long as the faith is there amen that's

[38:57] know we'll be careful to thank you and
[38:58] praise you worship you for all of it in
[39:01] the lovely holy name of our Lord and
[39:03] Savior Jesus Christ we pray
[39:07] amen amen Matthew chapter 5:48 we'll
[39:10] read this one scripture let you be
[39:11] seated Matthew 548 Jesus said be ye
[39:15] therefore perfect even as your father
[39:18] which is in heaven is perfect and you
[39:20] could be seated if you'd like
[39:23] amen we know what that Perfection means
[39:26] praise the Lord so uh we know that means
[39:29] a full age mature uh let's go over to
[39:32] Hebrews we've read this scripture once
[39:35] here we went through it did not delve
[39:37] into it quite as much but Hebrews
[39:39] chapter 5 uh verse 8 we're going to
[39:42] start our context from
[39:44] today or our text if you will Matthew
[39:47] chap 5 uh verse 8 speaking starting back
[39:52] from that maturity bringing us on Lord
[39:54] willing from where we left off the last
[39:56] time we before last amen of this place
[40:00] of
[40:01] maturity Matthew
[40:04] 5:8 Matthew 5:8 there uh though he were
[40:08] a son yet learned he obedience by the
[40:11] things which he suffered learned amen
[40:15] amen remember learning to become mature
[40:19] is a learning process that's why we grow
[40:22] in Grace and in knowledge amen learning
[40:26] is a growth process praise the Lord as
[40:29] you as you grow you learn amen though he
[40:33] were a son even a son learned obedience
[40:37] by the things which he
[40:38] suffered being made perfect and being
[40:41] made being made perfect amen now that
[40:45] word is a different word same root word
[40:48] but a different meaning of the word this
[40:51] word also means to be uh perfect but it
[40:55] it it but the def is to be finished
[41:00] completed reached its final End Amen or
[41:05] uh complete or or as we a lot of times
[41:08] use the word perfect as imperfect a
[41:10] sinless Perfection we know Jesus Christ
[41:13] obviously was sinlessly perfect amen
[41:17] took on the form of human flesh but he
[41:21] himself was perfect praise the Lord so
[41:24] we know in that Perfection he was made
[41:27] Amen to be perfect to bring it to an end
[41:31] if you will to finish
[41:34] completion praise the Lord and that's
[41:36] what we're expecting looking for of all
[41:38] of our Lives all of our Lives Jesus was
[41:42] born that way but Jesus was born that
[41:44] way so he could come live bleed die and
[41:48] come back so that we could reach the
[41:51] same Perfection that he was Amen to
[41:54] bring us to that completion
[41:57] Amen to bring us to the place that we
[42:00] reach the Fulfillment or finishing of
[42:04] our lives and that finishing is the two
[42:07] wit full Redemption of the Redemption of
[42:10] our bodies The Taking of our bodies when
[42:13] we leave this place amen we get to that
[42:16] place of of of finishment of bringing to
[42:20] a completion an end oh my I just look
[42:24] forward to that so much amen Jesus being
[42:28] perfect amen now at Ninth
[42:31] verse being made perfect he became the
[42:34] author of author of Eternal salvation
[42:38] unto all them that obey him called of
[42:42] God an high priest after the order of
[42:44] MDC we know of course that that same
[42:47] logos amen that came out of God that
[42:50] form of God that uh logos of God that
[42:55] came out of God Amen
[42:57] uh first showed himself in mzc obviously
[43:02] then 11th first down of whom we have
[43:05] many things to
[43:06] say and hard to be uttered or difficult
[43:10] to explain seeing that you are dull of
[43:12] hearing and that makes it understandable
[43:15] if a person hasn't reached the place of
[43:19] receiving uh the full maturity of a
[43:22] message uh it would just go right over
[43:24] their heads amen like I said the other
[43:27] day if you try if you tried to bring a
[43:29] message just really somewhat simple I I
[43:33] would call it that that this is you try
[43:36] to bring something even probably as
[43:38] simply as this to like a a
[43:40] denominational church or something or
[43:42] Catholic church Baptist uh they would
[43:44] have no idea probably what you're
[43:46] talking about most of them would anyway
[43:48] would have no idea what you're talking
[43:49] about it' go right over their heads well
[43:52] Paul is saying the same thing here the
[43:53] Hebrew letter said uh there's many
[43:56] things that we would like to say and
[43:57] talk about the relationship between
[44:00] Jesus and MDC but I can't do it because
[44:03] you I can't it's difficult to explain to
[44:06] you because you're slothful in your
[44:08] you're learning you're hearing that's
[44:10] what dull means is slothful he saying
[44:13] you can't if you're not going to receive
[44:15] it why would I explain it now we know
[44:18] that we've reached the place of this age
[44:21] or the ending of this age enter into the
[44:23] bride age where this bride now has got
[44:26] to the place that God sent her a prophet
[44:28] Messenger to preach to us Christ is the
[44:32] mystery of God revealed or and I should
[44:35] say not or who is this
[44:39] MDC amen now why did God send a prophet
[44:44] Messenger to bring a message to this
[44:46] Bride for this last day called who is
[44:48] this mzc to bring an understanding of
[44:52] what Paul was talking about here that
[44:55] they could not understand because it
[44:56] went over their head because do we the
[44:59] bride today has reached that place we've
[45:03] come to that place the Bride is a hole
[45:06] of a place of maturity where they could
[45:09] receive that word maybe it wasn't
[45:11] exactly at the time that brother Brandon
[45:13] preached it maybe not but he knew that
[45:16] God told him to store up this food to
[45:20] store up in the storehouse these
[45:23] messages so then it comes to the time of
[45:26] getting to the end of that age and now
[45:28] we're almost 60 years after brother
[45:30] Bam's even been gone gone not not here
[45:34] with us but it's been almost 60 years
[45:36] since he left us amen so you can imagine
[45:40] see these these messages these nuggets
[45:43] these these this food that was stored up
[45:46] was ministered over 60 years ago and now
[45:50] we're receiving it been been for years I
[45:53] wouldn't say just right now but uh the
[45:55] bride uh through this maturing time has
[45:59] come to the place that they recognize
[46:01] and receive now you click on who is this
[46:04] mezd a light goes off it it it it it it
[46:09] it it anchors into your soul I was going
[46:12] to say it makes sense but that that's
[46:14] not that making sense doesn't even
[46:16] describe what it does to the bride for
[46:19] this word when this word comes forth you
[46:21] listen to it and you say well that makes
[46:23] sense but that really doesn't even
[46:25] describe it that word coming into you
[46:28] elevates your spirit elevates your life
[46:31] so to the place of maturity that just
[46:33] making sense doesn't even do it justice
[46:37] it it it just comes and it it it
[46:39] elevates you it brings you to a place in
[46:42] the spirit of God and and drawing your
[46:45] relation the whole point is to draw a
[46:48] relationship uh closer to the Lord Jesus
[46:51] that's I mean that's the whole point
[46:53] really it's making sure that our
[46:54] relationship with the Lord becomes more
[46:56] solidified than ever every time we pray
[47:00] every time we go to church every time we
[47:01] listen to a word preached a message
[47:04] spoke whatever it is uh it it elevates
[47:07] us and brings us closer and closer and
[47:10] more and more to that place and that's
[47:12] what we want in line because that's what
[47:14] we need out of life amen people want to
[47:17] live it up people don't know what live
[47:19] it up means until you've come to this
[47:22] place to where Christ comes into your
[47:25] life and begins to speak to you and
[47:27] reveal his word to you and bring you to
[47:29] the place of understanding so when you
[47:31] click on who is this mezic when you
[47:33] click on Christ and mystery God revealed
[47:35] you click on those it it feeds
[47:39] you amen because you're not looking to
[47:42] drink a gallon of milk you're looking to
[47:44] eat a T-bone steak I say T-Bone all the
[47:47] time my favorite State's Riv I don't
[47:49] know why I use T-Bone all the time
[47:50] grandma t- that was my mom's favorite my
[47:54] mom lik T-Bone talk about T-Bones all
[47:56] the time rii is my favorite uh fine
[47:59] glass milk's okay but it's that meat
[48:02] praise the lord it's the meat of the
[48:04] word he couldn't do it here he said I I
[48:08] would love to say many things to you if
[48:10] I could paraphrase this for a second I'd
[48:13] love to say many things to you but it's
[48:17] difficult to explain to you because
[48:18] you're dull of hearing or slothful of
[48:20] hearing you can't receive it amen but
[48:25] praise God he sent a message for this
[48:27] last day because remember all through
[48:30] this all through these Church ages we've
[48:32] got to that place amen that we'll we'll
[48:35] talk up in just a minute that was
[48:37] stepping stones to bring us to where we
[48:39] are today all those early ages were just
[48:42] to bring us that they're all bride we
[48:44] don't discount that they're not they're
[48:46] absolutely everyone from the first
[48:47] church age to today all bride that were
[48:49] bride in those ages not every age was
[48:51] bride but the ones that were in that age
[48:53] that were bride was bride just like we
[48:55] are but they were just Stepping Stones
[48:58] to get to the place of where we are
[49:00] today amen that's why if you go to a
[49:03] denomination that was built by a
[49:05] messenger uh uh 800 years ago they're
[49:08] not going to understand because they're
[49:10] still preaching that the just shall live
[49:12] by faith and where that is good and that
[49:16] is scriptural and we still like and
[49:19] receive the just D still live by faith
[49:22] uh we we've continued on uh taking that
[49:26] bill building block with us to a place
[49:29] of perfection a place of maturity and
[49:32] not just that we're down here and you
[49:35] hear any NE this preaches they're just
[49:38] dull of hearing they can't receive it it
[49:41] goes over their heads and a lot of times
[49:43] they say well if my church doesn't
[49:45] preach it it's you know it's not right
[49:47] or if it's not from my denomination then
[49:49] it's not right or you know that's
[49:51] spirits in the message too right that's
[49:53] not just denomination amen because
[49:56] denomination Spirit has eat this message
[49:58] up Saints this denomination spirit is
[50:01] all over the message he said if it's not
[50:04] like this oh we got to listen to Joseph
[50:06] if he doesn't say it then it it's not
[50:08] right it's not the messeng if you don't
[50:10] come to our church you know we just take
[50:12] you out from under the blood you're not
[50:14] even a Christian anymore if you don't
[50:15] come here you don't tell me that
[50:17] denomination is not existing in this
[50:19] message it does yes amen you tell them
[50:21] any truth any spiritual revealed truth
[50:23] the message the word it goes right over
[50:25] their heads and don't want to hear it a
[50:28] lot of times don't want to hear it but
[50:30] don't hear it Paul said I'd love to
[50:33] explain it to you but it's difficult to
[50:35] explain because you don't listen you're
[50:37] dull of hearing slothful of hearing 12th
[50:39] verse now for when for the time you
[50:42] ought to be teachers he's saying now
[50:45] he's saying right now you should be
[50:49] teaching but for the time you ought to
[50:53] be teachers ye have need that one teach
[50:56] you again my so what did they
[51:01] learn what did they learn what have you
[51:04] learned if you've been taught but you
[51:08] have to be taught
[51:09] again that means that what you were
[51:12] taught the first time did not take did
[51:14] not uh connect it did not take effect at
[51:18] least you're not living it you're not
[51:21] preaching it you're not believing it
[51:23] amen CU it needs so when you should be
[51:27] teachers you're being taught
[51:29] again which be the first principles of
[51:32] the Oracles of God and are become he's
[51:36] telling now you are become such as have
[51:39] need of milk and not of strong
[51:42] meat amen bottle be fed off the bottle
[51:47] again simple little things things that
[51:50] we know to be true things that we still
[51:53] preach amen baptisms
[51:56] amen gifts of the Spirit things like
[51:58] that amen we don't need
[52:01] to we do take that as scripture and we
[52:05] do teach it because it should be taught
[52:08] but it's not something that that that a
[52:10] mature bride needs
[52:13] to understand how these things should be
[52:15] we should know how they are these gifts
[52:18] and how they should operate we should
[52:19] know we should know what the steps of
[52:22] process of Salvation are we should know
[52:24] where we come into Christ at that and
[52:27] what the Lord does to us in that
[52:29] position it all should be plain to us
[52:31] now amen we should be able to use those
[52:34] the Stepping Stones as we get to the
[52:36] place that the full maturity of the word
[52:39] is now ministered to a bride because she
[52:42] can receive it she could not receive it
[52:45] then and dar I say like I did the other
[52:48] day they probably didn't receive it even
[52:51] when brother Brandon was preaching it at
[52:53] that time but thank God that message is
[52:56] is Thor in the storehouses so we can go
[52:59] listen to it and God can minister to us
[53:01] and God can reveal that word to us and
[53:03] you can start recognizing that God is
[53:05] using you to bring you along as a mature
[53:08] Christian bring us along to a finish to
[53:12] a
[53:13] completion amen that completion Romans 8
[53:17] amen is that completion praise the Lord
[53:20] to it the Redemption of our
[53:23] bodies become such as have need of milk
[53:26] and not strong meat for everyone that
[53:28] uses milk is unskillful in the word of
[53:31] righteousness for he is a babe in other
[53:34] words not mature amen babes babies
[53:37] children not mature is basically what
[53:39] he's saying you have come to place you
[53:42] of of your of not being mature amen for
[53:46] you use milk because you're unskillful
[53:49] or
[53:50] unknowledgeable in the word of
[53:53] righteousness but strong meat belongeth
[53:55] to them that are a full age there's that
[53:58] mature there's that perfect that he's
[54:01] talking about same root word as we just
[54:03] read of Jesus being perfect but it means
[54:06] a full age wanting nothing of necessity
[54:10] for completeness full grown
[54:13] adult that's what it means full age
[54:17] perfect strong meat belongeth to them
[54:20] that are perfect of full age even those
[54:24] who by reason of use have their senses
[54:27] exercised to discern both good and evil
[54:30] now 6th chapter first verse we'll keep
[54:33] reading therefore what does he say now
[54:36] he says therefore we've left we've left
[54:40] off of the other we've grown into
[54:42] maturity uh feasting on strong meat
[54:45] praise the Lord therefore leaving the
[54:50] principles of the doctrine of Christ
[54:53] amen let us go on unto Perfection again
[54:58] same word praise the Lord same
[55:01] word Perfection maturity let us go on to
[55:06] be mature Christians if you will not
[55:09] laying again the foundation of
[55:11] repentance from dead works and a faith
[55:14] towards God this age was burn
[55:19] forth of isus Street and the and the
[55:23] returning of the
[55:25] gifts and the speaking of tongues and
[55:28] the the the prophecy and and all the
[55:30] gifts manifesting themselves to the
[55:33] place that people just uh as they had
[55:36] that gift that was poured out on people
[55:39] uh it's it's like trying to it's like
[55:41] trying to go into the shower wearing a
[55:44] shower cap to not get your hair
[55:46] wet amen when the water dumps on you it
[55:49] dumps on
[55:51] everything and that's what the spirit of
[55:53] God did and people just went off W with
[55:56] all the gifts operating all over the
[55:58] place people would stand up in the
[56:01] midddle of uh of brother Brandon
[56:02] preaching and just stand up and start
[56:04] speaking in
[56:06] tongues why childish that's childish
[56:09] friend right mean God's not in that when
[56:12] the word is being brought forth that
[56:15] word has the preeminence right amen
[56:18] every other Spirit take subjection to
[56:22] that word amen even the speaking of
[56:24] tongues people would stand up start
[56:26] prophesying people stand up speak in
[56:28] tongues and then try to prophesy
[56:30] interpret the the speaking in tongues
[56:32] all the gifts of operation all those
[56:34] things but
[56:35] childish amen childish with it that's
[56:38] the whole thing they would be childish
[56:41] with it but that's how it was born how
[56:43] was it born it was born a baby like
[56:46] everything it's born is born a baby when
[56:48] something's born it's born a baby if
[56:51] it's a seed of botney life if it's a
[56:53] seed of animal life if it's a seed of
[56:56] human life when it comes forth and it's
[56:58] birth forth It's a
[57:00] 80 every
[57:02] time it's got some growing to do and
[57:05] that body had growing to do praise the
[57:08] Lord this age had growing to do that's
[57:12] why brother Brandon was born about the
[57:13] exact same time Amen to bring about that
[57:16] exact same thing to grow forth into the
[57:19] maturity of the age that we're living in
[57:22] now which is the separation of the Bride
[57:25] from the World which is the separation
[57:29] from the bride and the
[57:31] church because the bride has moved on
[57:33] into maturity the church is down here
[57:36] jabbering about with their tongues and
[57:38] and all the gifts and things and there's
[57:40] nothing wrong with the gifts when
[57:42] they're in order when they're done right
[57:45] in operation and it is of God Amen when
[57:50] it is of god then that's okay praise the
[57:53] Lord but this gone on and about and
[57:56] forth we'll just read it we we'll get to
[57:58] it in a minute but now we gone on into
[58:01] Perfection not laying again the
[58:03] foundation repentance from dead works
[58:05] and of Faith towards god of the doctrine
[58:08] of baptisms and of laying on of hands
[58:10] and resurrection of the dead and of
[58:12] Eternal judgment and this will we do if
[58:15] God permit
[58:18] why because it's time to go on into
[58:21] Perfection it's time for the bride to go
[58:24] on into that maturity to go on into that
[58:27] place of this is the completion friend
[58:30] we're there's not another age after this
[58:32] one we are not we are not a stepping
[58:36] stone we are not an
[58:39] inart message Age We Are The mature age
[58:44] we are the completion we are the
[58:46] finishing now the seventh Church age
[58:50] with the church goes on into predition
[58:53] but the bride in the bride age she goes
[58:57] up in a Rapture because she reaches that
[59:00] place of maturity she reaches that place
[59:04] where God is bringing her to to receive
[59:07] that word to receive that message to
[59:09] receive that truth and that truth
[59:11] changing her and making her more like
[59:14] Christ every day this bride goes into a
[59:18] Rapture the church goes into predition
[59:21] amen but the bride goes out of here
[59:23] she's the one that God was perfect
[59:26] bringing to that place of maturity we're
[59:29] not worried about laying uh uh uh all
[59:32] these things that the the foundations of
[59:36] of of what we know we still observe
[59:39] ordinances if somebody wants to come get
[59:41] baptized or uh communion footwash and
[59:44] those things but just continuing on with
[59:47] what now you know that you should be
[59:49] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[59:51] Christ not father Son and Holy Ghost you
[59:53] know what if I just took the next six
[59:55] services and just make sure and we just
[59:56] talk about that you know that we're not
[1:00:00] going to go back and lay that back out
[1:00:03] again amen we've reached the places
[1:00:06] beyond that hopefully prayerfully we've
[1:00:10] all been baptized in the name of the
[1:00:12] Lord Jesus Christ we've all been born
[1:00:15] again of the spirit of God coming and
[1:00:17] living and becoming the permanent resent
[1:00:20] of your soul hopefully we've all gotten
[1:00:22] to that place you a said maybe the
[1:00:25] children that are younger than that but
[1:00:27] we've all come to that place amen
[1:00:29] because that's that time that's the time
[1:00:31] that we're living we're living at that
[1:00:33] day we're living in that age right now
[1:00:36] amen trying to do God a service without
[1:00:39] his will he said now notice I'm skip
[1:00:41] some of this it's very treacherous a
[1:00:44] very treacherous text if you don't get
[1:00:45] it right I feel this part I want to say
[1:00:50] brother said I feel that the hour is
[1:00:54] coming dares I say the hour is now
[1:00:58] Saints the hour is now it's not
[1:01:01] yesterday it's not tomorrow the hour is
[1:01:05] now praise the Lord that I feel that we
[1:01:10] should be men and
[1:01:12] women instead of
[1:01:14] babies we should have strong meat
[1:01:17] instead of
[1:01:19] milk praise the Lord I believe that too
[1:01:23] I believe you all get to that place
[1:01:24] we've all get to the place place that we
[1:01:27] can receive that that God can Minister
[1:01:30] that to us because we're mature
[1:01:33] Christians we don't have to worry about
[1:01:35] understanding of the the the simple
[1:01:38] things that the laid the foundation but
[1:01:41] the things that God continues to help us
[1:01:43] to grow with to help us to become more
[1:01:46] like him with just like the things we
[1:01:48] were just talking about that brings us
[1:01:50] along to the place that we understand
[1:01:52] who we are amen you you remember what
[1:01:56] brother bam said happens when this Bride
[1:01:58] Comes to know who she is do you know you
[1:02:01] remember what he said about that what
[1:02:03] happens to the bride that comes to the
[1:02:06] place that she knows who she
[1:02:13] is she will be an invincible
[1:02:17] Army the devil can do anything and
[1:02:21] everything to her but he will leave
[1:02:24] defeated because she will be when this
[1:02:27] Bride Comes to the place that she knows
[1:02:30] who she is she will be an invincible
[1:02:33] Army praise God this bride is getting to
[1:02:37] the place hopefully we are at that place
[1:02:41] where when brother Bram
[1:02:44] said this bride she will have thus
[1:02:47] sayith the Lord or she will shut
[1:02:51] up she will have thus sayith the Lord
[1:02:54] from God or she will be quiet she'll set
[1:02:59] still amen thus sayeth the Lord this is
[1:03:03] God's word this is God speaking this is
[1:03:06] God to us amen that's thus sayith the
[1:03:09] Lord when brother bam said thus sayith
[1:03:11] the Lord that meant that was a direct
[1:03:13] communication from
[1:03:15] God thus sayeth the Lord she'll have not
[1:03:19] just brother Bram see all so many people
[1:03:22] they want to keep putting everything on
[1:03:23] brother Bram no no no no brother Bram
[1:03:25] said she who she the
[1:03:29] bride Amen brother R's been gone like I
[1:03:31] said almost 60 years coming up on 60
[1:03:34] years been gone he didn't say him he
[1:03:38] said she the bride and let me tell you
[1:03:40] friend brother branon wasn't the only
[1:03:43] bride member he wasn't the only one that
[1:03:46] comprised of the Bride for this last day
[1:03:50] by the way if you go into a church like
[1:03:52] I was talking about earlier and you even
[1:03:54] use that use that phraseology of the
[1:03:56] Bride th just that would probably send
[1:03:59] people heading to the exits and wonder
[1:04:01] what is this man talking about what is
[1:04:04] where is he going with this and don't
[1:04:06] even realize that that's what the
[1:04:09] scripture calls us right I I would dare
[1:04:13] us to say that a lot of Christian prob
[1:04:16] themselves Christian people today
[1:04:17] probably don't even know that that
[1:04:19] phraseology of bride is even in the
[1:04:22] scripture don't even know it I remember
[1:04:25] read read one part of the article that
[1:04:27] that man wrote in dissension of the
[1:04:29] message they went around and interviewed
[1:04:31] these churches and people and stuff and
[1:04:33] found out some of the horrible things
[1:04:36] that happened in the name of the message
[1:04:38] he put in there that that things like
[1:04:41] the message and the bride were
[1:04:44] used as that was some kind of cuss word
[1:04:48] that was some kind of word of dissension
[1:04:51] some kind of word to make us sound like
[1:04:53] freaky people when it's in when it's
[1:04:55] scriptural he has no idea no idea it's
[1:05:00] even in the Bible it's the word
[1:05:03] scripture what is this bride this bride
[1:05:06] is the Bride of Jesus Christ and she's
[1:05:08] got to that place where she's thus
[1:05:10] sayith the Lord or she's or she's
[1:05:12] sitting still amen thus said that's
[1:05:16] maturity remember power without
[1:05:18] character is
[1:05:20] satanic power so we say that a lot Power
[1:05:25] without character satanic amen but let
[1:05:27] me ask you this question what is power
[1:05:30] with
[1:05:32] character if power without character is
[1:05:35] satanic what is power with
[1:05:38] character I'd say it's
[1:05:40] Godly if power without character is
[1:05:43] satanic then power with character is
[1:05:46] Godly well we try to bring these phrases
[1:05:51] and these things that we talk all the
[1:05:54] time that make some uh great something
[1:05:57] or whatever it's really simple it's just
[1:06:00] a matter of the bride having thus sayith
[1:06:03] the Lord power with character she's got
[1:06:06] the character why because she's a grown
[1:06:08] woman she knows how to handle the word
[1:06:11] she knows how the Lord wants done
[1:06:14] another quote excuse me but brother
[1:06:17] another quote the bride knows what he
[1:06:20] wants done with the
[1:06:22] word praise the Lord mature that's the
[1:06:26] point that's what we're preaching on
[1:06:28] maturity let's go to Isaiah chapter
[1:06:35] 28 Isaiah chapter 28 we'll begin with
[1:06:38] verse
[1:06:39] 9 Isaiah
[1:06:45] 289 praise the
[1:06:48] Lord
[1:06:52] amen things aren't always
[1:06:55] say the same thank God for
[1:06:58] that amen so thankful for that changes
[1:07:03] sometimes hard but when it's Chang in
[1:07:05] the Lord when we grow in him it's all
[1:07:08] good Isaiah 28:9 let's read now Whom
[1:07:12] Shall he teach
[1:07:14] knowledge and Whom Shall he make to
[1:07:17] understand
[1:07:20] Doctrine them that are weaned from the
[1:07:22] milk and drawn from the breast those are
[1:07:25] the ones why because they're they're not
[1:07:29] feeding on the milk anymore they're
[1:07:30] feeding on the the meat amen the ribi
[1:07:36] stake for precept must be upon
[1:07:39] precept precept upon precept line upon
[1:07:44] line line upon line here a little and
[1:07:46] there a little for with stammering lips
[1:07:49] and an other tongue will he speak to
[1:07:52] this people and you can speak perfect
[1:07:56] English in the in the vernacular of
[1:08:01] whoever it
[1:08:03] is scriptural
[1:08:06] truth message
[1:08:09] meat and they still will think you're
[1:08:11] speaking in
[1:08:12] tongues because they will have a they
[1:08:14] won't have a clue what you're
[1:08:16] saying amen you might as well speak a
[1:08:18] foreign language because they don't
[1:08:21] know Amen to whom he said this is the
[1:08:26] rest praise the lord we rest in it
[1:08:28] wherewith ye may cause the weary to
[1:08:31] rest and this is the
[1:08:34] refreshing yet they would not
[1:08:38] hear but the word of the Lord was unto
[1:08:42] them precept upon precept precept upon
[1:08:44] precept line upon line line upon line
[1:08:47] here a little there a little that there
[1:08:50] uh that they might go and fall backward
[1:08:53] and be broken and snared and taken
[1:08:56] those that don't receive those that
[1:08:58] don't hear those that are dull of
[1:09:00] hearing cannot receive it dull of
[1:09:02] hearing cannot receive the truth those
[1:09:06] that are slow of
[1:09:07] listening Paul made sure he didn't choke
[1:09:10] them to death remember what he told we
[1:09:12] talked about in Corinthians remember
[1:09:14] what he told them he said I'm I didn't
[1:09:16] come to you great swelling words of
[1:09:17] wisdom I could but I didn't I saved
[1:09:20] those wisdom the speaking of wisdom to
[1:09:23] mature groups and they w mature what did
[1:09:26] he tell the Hebrews same
[1:09:28] thing praise the Lord I would explain
[1:09:31] all these things I would ad Minister all
[1:09:32] these things to you but you can't
[1:09:34] receive them so he didn't want to choke
[1:09:38] them to death so he let them go amen and
[1:09:41] taught them what they could receive
[1:09:43] right believing trusting at one day
[1:09:46] they'll get to the place that they can
[1:09:47] receive that meat amen and get to the
[1:09:51] place to where they can receive the
[1:09:53] understanding of the truth for that for
[1:09:55] the for their hour for their day that's
[1:09:57] why that phrase is there for their
[1:10:01] day brother am uses that phrase a lot
[1:10:04] for their day why because it's
[1:10:07] significant it makes a difference what
[1:10:09] day you're in as so what you receive we
[1:10:13] go back to cor First Corinthians I want
[1:10:15] to pick up here where we left the other
[1:10:17] day 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:10:19] 13 the love chapter as we know it but I
[1:10:22] want to read the last part of the
[1:10:24] chapter CH of verse vers
[1:10:25] [Music]
[1:10:28] 8 1 Corinthians
[1:10:32] 13:8 I want to go through this
[1:10:39] again
[1:10:41] amen 1 Corinthians 138 charity never
[1:10:45] faileth thank God for that because he
[1:10:48] loves us
[1:10:50] unconditionally if he loves us
[1:10:53] unconditionally that love doesn't fail
[1:10:56] praise the Lord doesn't quit doesn't
[1:10:59] stop never ends because it's
[1:11:02] unconditional nothing changes it it
[1:11:04] can't change because it's God it's God's
[1:11:08] love and it comes from God it can't
[1:11:09] change praise the Lord never fail but
[1:11:12] where there be
[1:11:14] prophecies they shall fail whether there
[1:11:17] be tongues they shall cease whether
[1:11:20] there be knowledge it shall vanish away
[1:11:22] all these things are insignificant we
[1:11:24] laid those as Stepping Stones as
[1:11:26] stumbling as uh uh uh uh stepping blocks
[1:11:30] that we step to to move forward amen
[1:11:33] just like the bride has moved forward
[1:11:36] amen for we know in part and we prophesy
[1:11:38] in part but when that which is perfect
[1:11:40] has come that which is in part shall be
[1:11:42] done
[1:11:43] away when I was a child I spake as a
[1:11:46] child I understood as a child I thought
[1:11:47] as a child but when I became a man I put
[1:11:49] away childish things now
[1:11:51] look
[1:11:53] justification was in in
[1:11:56] part Luther the just shall live by faith
[1:11:59] justification was a
[1:12:01] part satification Wesley moved up a step
[1:12:06] Wesley sanctification was a
[1:12:09] part wasn't all of it it was a
[1:12:12] part and what they brought what they
[1:12:14] learned what they knew was what they
[1:12:17] needed for their day amen they were in
[1:12:20] part but when that which is perfect is
[1:12:23] come that which is in part will be done
[1:12:26] away now what does that mean amen what
[1:12:30] does that done away mean
[1:12:32] look let me read this question answers
[1:12:35] number two 1964 brother says 1
[1:12:38] Corinthians 13 says that which is that
[1:12:40] which is per has come that which is in
[1:12:43] part shall be done away with so all
[1:12:45] these little things listen
[1:12:47] now if you're streaming you watch this
[1:12:50] listen so all these little things of
[1:12:53] jumping up and down like a king
[1:12:56] trying to talk in tongues and all these
[1:12:58] other things when that which is
[1:13:01] perfect and we do have today by God's
[1:13:04] help the perfect interpretation of the
[1:13:08] word with Divine
[1:13:10] Vindication praise the
[1:13:12] Lord amen 1964 he preached
[1:13:16] that we have now today by God's help the
[1:13:21] perfect interpretation of the of of the
[1:13:25] the word with Divine Vindication then
[1:13:27] that which is in part is done away with
[1:13:31] when I was a child I spoke as a child
[1:13:33] stood as a child but when I become a man
[1:13:35] I put away childish things now what is
[1:13:37] he talking about just like the scripture
[1:13:39] says amen I go to preaching and these
[1:13:43] little things he's talking about now
[1:13:45] what is he
[1:13:46] saying he's not talking about because
[1:13:48] brother random remember we know brother
[1:13:51] random believed in the gifts of the
[1:13:52] Spirit we know the gifts of the Spirit
[1:13:54] operated in his life right to Great
[1:13:57] degree to the to to the degree that a
[1:14:00] lot of people try to impersonate him
[1:14:02] that try to impersonate the moving of
[1:14:05] that gift to try to impersonate the
[1:14:07] moving of that spirit and those things
[1:14:09] he tries to impersonate that people try
[1:14:12] to impersonate that in brother Brown
[1:14:14] they try to impersonate so much so he's
[1:14:17] not saying that you can't speak in
[1:14:19] tongues
[1:14:20] anymore he said I he said I would be
[1:14:23] anti- word if I talk that right he
[1:14:26] wasn't against prophecy he wasn't
[1:14:29] against the uh uh the governments and
[1:14:32] heals he wasn't against the organization
[1:14:34] of a church amen he wasn't against these
[1:14:38] things so what is he talking about when
[1:14:41] it talks about when that that which is
[1:14:44] perfect is come and we know that which
[1:14:46] is perfect has come we know that which
[1:14:49] is imp which is perfect is here we know
[1:14:53] that so what happens if that which is
[1:14:55] imperfect is come then that which is in
[1:14:58] part is done
[1:14:59] away it doesn't
[1:15:02] mean
[1:15:03] quit but it means this listen Church
[1:15:06] order Church
[1:15:09] order well Brethren I appreciate being
[1:15:12] here with you tonight brother Neville
[1:15:14] these deacons trustees Sunday school
[1:15:16] superintendent all of you we trust that
[1:15:18] the Lord will help you now to carry out
[1:15:20] these orders for the kingdom of God the
[1:15:22] reason I have said this is because I
[1:15:24] think think you have grown from children
[1:15:27] to
[1:15:28] adults praise the Lord just what we're
[1:15:31] discussing when you was a child you talk
[1:15:34] like a child you understood as a child
[1:15:36] but now you're a
[1:15:37] man now you are a mature
[1:15:41] bride praise the Lord he's talking to
[1:15:44] his board there I'm talking to you I'm
[1:15:47] talking to us he's talking to us amen
[1:15:52] now we we here today
[1:15:56] grown from children to adults when you
[1:15:58] was a child you talk like a child
[1:15:59] understood as a child but now you are an
[1:16:01] adult now you are a man so let's act
[1:16:05] like adults in the house of
[1:16:08] God act like adults what was it all
[1:16:11] these things that came forth in the
[1:16:14] beginning of that church and the
[1:16:15] restoration of the gifts amen uh back at
[1:16:19] isza Street and and the spirit just fell
[1:16:22] like a bucket of water on people and
[1:16:25] they just spoke in tongues there no
[1:16:27] gifts operating and all the things
[1:16:28] that's going on uh these things are just
[1:16:32] out of order and just out of control but
[1:16:35] what was it it was infant age it was
[1:16:38] just starting out it's a baby just born
[1:16:41] it had to come to a place of maturity
[1:16:44] amen now this age will not this age goes
[1:16:49] to predition like I said but a bride
[1:16:52] comes out of this age to complete the
[1:16:55] bride the the the statue of a perfect
[1:16:58] man up to the Pinnacle the peak which is
[1:17:01] where this bride is to to the time that
[1:17:06] she goes home it's going home time amen
[1:17:10] it's going home time so when this when
[1:17:13] this bride reaches to that place cuz
[1:17:16] he's not preaching to the church he's
[1:17:18] preaching to the bride I'm not preaching
[1:17:20] to a room full of unbelievers I'm
[1:17:22] preaching to who I believe are bride
[1:17:26] right mature bride now you've come to
[1:17:28] the place of maturity now we know that
[1:17:31] we should act like them in the house of
[1:17:34] God
[1:17:36] Amen I shouldn't even have to but Michel
[1:17:40] put it on there and I
[1:17:42] do I hit this at the end of every
[1:17:46] service because this is what a mature
[1:17:50] Christian should do this is what a
[1:17:53] mature bride member no should take place
[1:17:56] in the house of
[1:17:57] God the house that's dedicated and
[1:18:01] consecrated to the Lord Jesus this is
[1:18:03] what it should be amen we should know
[1:18:07] that it shouldn't have to be something
[1:18:09] that we have to put up here amen and by
[1:18:12] the grace of God and I do believe that
[1:18:14] that we all follow that and are
[1:18:17] respectful in the house of God Amen but
[1:18:20] that's what it means to be a mature an
[1:18:22] adult Christian
[1:18:25] listen now let's act like adults in the
[1:18:27] house of God back to the quote here
[1:18:30] behaving ourselves and honoring our
[1:18:32] offices and honoring every office every
[1:18:35] gift now he's talking about what put
[1:18:38] when that which is imperfect when that
[1:18:40] which is perfect is come that which is
[1:18:42] in part shall be done away every gift
[1:18:46] that the Lord has given us let's put it
[1:18:50] in
[1:18:51] order and honor God with our gifts and
[1:18:56] our offices that's exactly what he's
[1:18:59] talking about that I I believe is
[1:19:02] exactly what the scripture is talking
[1:19:04] about that which is perfect is here so
[1:19:08] that which is in part falls under
[1:19:11] subjection to that which is perfect amen
[1:19:15] justification was part sanctification
[1:19:18] part but now we're up in the Holy Spirit
[1:19:20] we're up in the heavenlies we're up in
[1:19:22] the place of meat we're up in the place
[1:19:25] of maturity we're up in the place of
[1:19:27] adulthood amen now we're up in the place
[1:19:30] of adulthood we act like adults we act
[1:19:33] like Christian adults in the house of
[1:19:35] God we act like Christian adults in the
[1:19:38] presence of one another and in the
[1:19:39] presence of God how do we do that he's
[1:19:43] not saying you can't speak in tongues
[1:19:44] for it's a genuine gift of God he's not
[1:19:46] saying you can't prophesy if it's a
[1:19:49] genuine gift and God's operating and
[1:19:50] moving on you to do that he's not saying
[1:19:53] that he's saying let every gift of the
[1:19:56] Lord that he has given us be put in
[1:19:59] order amen when everything's put in
[1:20:02] order then it's just right put in order
[1:20:05] and honor God with our gifts and our
[1:20:08] offices amen that's why everything
[1:20:11] should be decently in an order should be
[1:20:14] done right now that doesn't mean that we
[1:20:16] turn our churches into
[1:20:18] morons that doesn't mean that we turn
[1:20:21] our churches into a place that's colder
[1:20:23] than uh uh
[1:20:26] Siberia it just means that it's that
[1:20:29] everything is in order and let me tell
[1:20:30] you friend people can jump up and down
[1:20:32] Scream and Shout Whatever churches they
[1:20:34] go to they can come out with all kinds
[1:20:36] of these devices and whatever they think
[1:20:38] that they can communicate with God or uh
[1:20:42] whatever whatever they want to I don't
[1:20:44] whatever I I I want to stick with what
[1:20:47] CH God has given us the word this mature
[1:20:49] Bride for this day they can do whatever
[1:20:51] they want amen let let them let them do
[1:20:53] all those things out the world and
[1:20:55] whatever and self-proclaimed prophets
[1:20:57] and what they can say and do whatever
[1:20:59] they want to that's their choice but I'm
[1:21:01] here to tell you that God has put this
[1:21:03] in order and you will find no matter
[1:21:06] what all this else is going on over
[1:21:08] there say oh boy they must really have
[1:21:10] the power of
[1:21:11] God but they've got a bunch of emotion
[1:21:14] is what they have because when the word
[1:21:16] that which is perfect is not present all
[1:21:19] you've got is emotion and you got a
[1:21:21] bunch of emotion oh it'll make people
[1:21:23] LIF their hands emotional make you cry
[1:21:25] harder than any than any moving of the
[1:21:28] spirit remember Satan can impersonate
[1:21:31] any gift yes but he cannot bring that
[1:21:35] word word by word so what are you
[1:21:36] majoring on right amen you can't major
[1:21:40] on a minor and the gifts are minors the
[1:21:43] word is the major you can't major on a
[1:21:46] minor praise the Lord so when the word
[1:21:49] has come the word is that which is
[1:21:51] perfect and when it's in order I'm I
[1:21:54] promise you I guarantee you there'll be
[1:21:58] more more moving of the spirit of God in
[1:22:01] a sanctuary that's in order and place
[1:22:04] the way God's word says to than any of
[1:22:07] this other Jumping Up Down screaming
[1:22:08] shouting yelling and whatever they do I
[1:22:10] guarantee you there's more spirit of God
[1:22:13] Amen in that place it's order people say
[1:22:16] oh that looks like a dead place to me
[1:22:18] those people don't move they don't shout
[1:22:20] they don't do this that and the other
[1:22:22] but when the word has come that which is
[1:22:25] perfect is here amen oh I don't feel A
[1:22:28] tingle up my spine oh the hair didn't go
[1:22:31] up on the back of my neck I didn't feel
[1:22:34] anything well probably because you're a
[1:22:36] dead
[1:22:37] wood pardoning expression shouldn't be
[1:22:41] that meaning Christ crasp but that's the
[1:22:44] truth amen because God's moving we feel
[1:22:48] the moving of the spirit we know when
[1:22:50] it's God moving amen when you have the
[1:22:52] spirit of God in you you know when that
[1:22:54] SP is moving and people say well you're
[1:22:56] not jumping danc nobody's nobody's
[1:22:58] dancing nobody's running around the
[1:23:00] church now you can if the Lord moves on
[1:23:02] you you go right ahead amen amen don't
[1:23:05] you don't you quench the spirit of the
[1:23:07] Lord just don't do it during the
[1:23:08] preaching and because it's got to be in
[1:23:10] order got to be done respectfully
[1:23:12] decently in order I've seen I've been in
[1:23:15] places where uh uh little girls come up
[1:23:19] like 15 16 17 years old come up in a
[1:23:22] prayer line or come up to be prayed for
[1:23:24] and as soon as the minister comes and
[1:23:26] even just barely touches them they're
[1:23:27] falling out and screaming and yelling
[1:23:29] and
[1:23:31] uh uh thriving around in the the the uh
[1:23:35] uh wood shavings and
[1:23:37] everything I I saw one girl she fell out
[1:23:41] and her skirts flew up and I said that's
[1:23:43] not of God no that's
[1:23:46] indecent if her skirt flies up like that
[1:23:48] that's indecent that's not God right I
[1:23:51] saw one girl she felt like she got such
[1:23:53] a spirit she just kept going back
[1:23:54] backwards and she ran I mean hard the
[1:23:59] platform was like 3 foot high and she
[1:24:00] ran the back of her back into that
[1:24:02] platform that girl probably broke her
[1:24:04] back she laid down on this she laid
[1:24:07] there I don't know how long in the wood
[1:24:09] shaving I said that's just that's not of
[1:24:12] God God's not going to do that to you
[1:24:13] friend amen I mean you can lose yourself
[1:24:17] absolutely but it's going to be done
[1:24:19] decently and in order amen it's going to
[1:24:22] be done God if it's God it's going to be
[1:24:24] done done right I liked can I brag on my

[1:25:18] the moving of the spirit of God that all
[1:25:21] this other that was going on they knew
[1:25:23] if that Spirit hit her like that it was

[1:28:04] strength it brings life to
[1:28:08] Seed Life is In light there's life in
[1:28:12] the sun you know without the sun there'd
[1:28:13] be no
[1:28:15] life without the sun there's no life
[1:28:18] there's life in light what does the

[1:28:50] January it would kill it certainly you
[1:28:52] can't do that it must comeing It season
[1:28:55] why why Paul could not preach to the
[1:28:57] Corinthians Hebrews like he talked about
[1:29:01] he could not do it what would have done
[1:29:03] it would have choked them out so must
[1:29:06] God's wheat and grain ripen just in the
[1:29:10] season and what's she doing is this the
[1:29:12] season she's ripening ripening right
[1:29:15] now amen shu is pulled away there I say
[1:29:20] brother man talked about the Shu pulling
[1:29:21] away Shu has pulled away the rain the

[1:29:28] sun
[1:29:29] rening she's getting to that full
[1:29:32] maturity the bride is getting to that
[1:29:35] place of completion of
[1:29:38] fullness of per because that's that's
[1:29:40] the bride's going to come to this place
[1:29:42] when he takes her home that's when the
[1:29:45] body change hits when
[1:29:48] internationally the bride
[1:29:49] internationally is changed in a moment
[1:29:52] twinkling of an eye praise the Lord
[1:29:55] remember it's a mature woman not a child
[1:29:59] God's not marrying a child he's marrying
[1:30:01] a mature
[1:30:03] woman the season it's in but now but how
[1:30:07] could a son well the wheat would die the
[1:30:09] fruits would die the sun lives today
[1:30:11] with shine rathera it's coming an
[1:30:13] oncoming Harvest is ripening the grain
[1:30:16] should mature with the
[1:30:19] light justification part Luther SA ific
[1:30:24] ation part
[1:30:25] Wesley now it's got to the place when
[1:30:28] it's evening time there's it shall be
[1:30:31] light the fullness of the light the the
[1:30:34] grain has
[1:30:35] matured amen with the light he sent us a
[1:30:39] prophet they said this was right irenius
[1:30:42] and this was right with Martin and this
[1:30:43] was right with Columbus this was right
[1:30:45] with Luther this was right with les
[1:30:48] Wesley he brought it and put it all
[1:30:49] together and preached a message that's
[1:30:52] been stored up for us to listen to to
[1:30:54] that's been stored up in the storehouses
[1:30:56] so that it can feed us it's a Grainery
[1:31:00] uh like like would put to shame the
[1:31:03] Egyptian Grainer when Joseph come and
[1:31:06] they stored up enough grain for seven
[1:31:09] years with this Grainery that this food
[1:31:13] that was stored up for us would put that
[1:31:14] Grainery to shame of the food that we
[1:31:17] have to Feast on oh praise God the grain
[1:31:21] should mature with the light but the
[1:31:23] thing is today the church grain won't
[1:31:25] want to mature it wants to stay right
[1:31:27] back remember Mooney uh s youny Cox
[1:31:31] Alvin they want to stay and listen to to
[1:31:33] those that's why they those people would
[1:31:36] just go right over their heads they
[1:31:38] couldn't receive it amen they couldn't
[1:31:40] understand it but this is an another
[1:31:44] hour this is another day this is the
[1:31:46] advancement of the Gospel it's coming to
[1:31:49] its maturity so we can't live in what
[1:31:52] Luther said only or Wesley said only or
[1:31:55] some of the rest of them were living in
[1:31:57] the lights that predict for this day
[1:32:00] amen the grain is mature the light if it
[1:32:03] goes ahead with the light the light
[1:32:06] brings the grain to
[1:32:08] maturity praise the Lord and the evening
[1:32:12] light which is
[1:32:14] now there shall be
[1:32:16] light praise the Lord I got to read one
[1:32:19] more here I'm going to
[1:32:21] close amen
[1:32:24] spoken words your origal seed notice

[1:33:02] had lunch there on the grounds I forgot
[1:33:04] how it was and then he preached three or
[1:33:07] four more hours amen spoken words
[1:33:10] original seat believe that's what it was
[1:33:13] he spoke this
[1:33:16] 1962 so so will the bride and she shows
[1:33:20] he shows her his Word of Life he shows

[1:33:41] come up
[1:33:42] again amen then I got a real big he said
[1:33:46] a a real great big
[1:33:48] Hallelujah here is the secret the word
[1:33:52] is in the bride and the mind of Christ
[1:33:56] listen now to know what he wants done
[1:34:00] with the word who does the bride he
[1:34:05] didn't say himself although he did
[1:34:08] because he's part of the Bride not
[1:34:10] himself he never put it all on himself
[1:34:13] but the bride who is she I'm part of it
[1:34:16] I think I'm looking at part of it the
[1:34:18] bride around the world internationally
[1:34:21] Bride In The City Bride In the state
[1:34:23] bride in the this country Bri all around
[1:34:25] the world Amen she's a many membered
[1:34:28] body few in number by comparison to the
[1:34:31] seven billion that live on this planet
[1:34:33] now give or take amen she's a small
[1:34:35] number but she's God's she's God's
[1:34:38] chosen she's his bride she's come to
[1:34:42] that place of maturity here it is she
[1:34:46] amen the bride in the mind of Christ
[1:34:50] knows what God wants done with the world
[1:34:53] word praise the Lord now you want to
[1:34:57] talk power with character there it is
[1:35:01] power with character is Godly she he she
[1:35:06] knows what he wants done with the word
[1:35:09] praise the Lord and she does it in his
[1:35:12] name she has she has not he not William
[1:35:19] Brandon she has thus sayith the Lord
[1:35:24] now there's people in this message would
[1:35:26] call that blasphemy and that's a direct
[1:35:29] quote from the prophet they claim to
[1:35:32] believe
[1:35:34] amen it's a truth I believe it I believe
[1:35:38] it she will know they people say if you
[1:35:42] say thus sayi the Lord he said brother
[1:35:45] BR said that she the bride will have
[1:35:48] thus sayith the
[1:35:51] Lord glory to God this then it is gerti
[1:35:54] so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it's
[1:35:56] grown and serves its purpose they will
[1:35:59] do only they will do only his will glory
[1:36:05] to God no one can persuade them
[1:36:09] different they have thus sayith the Lord
[1:36:11] or they keep still praise the Lord
[1:36:14] Jesus amen that's what you call mature
[1:36:19] when my son got to the place that it was
[1:36:21] time for him to drive a car I had no
[1:36:24] problems giving in my keys amen I knew
[1:36:27] he might mess up I knew he might get a
[1:36:29] ticket I knew he might have a wreck
[1:36:31] Tabitha too my daughter too amen but I
[1:36:33] had no problem giving it to them because
[1:36:35] they were at that place in life they had
[1:36:37] grown up to the place that I believe
[1:36:39] they were responsible enough to
[1:36:41] know we all make mistakes we all have
[1:36:45] accidents uh my son just followed in my
[1:36:48] footsteps I think I had like two
[1:36:50] accidents in the first year of my
[1:36:51] license or something like that
[1:36:54] uh but things things happen but I had no
[1:36:56] problem and see that's what when God
[1:36:59] sees that in our lives people wonder say
[1:37:02] why why isn't I gotten to this place
[1:37:04] maybe youve not mature enough to the
[1:37:06] place where God can entrust you with
[1:37:09] it we get to the place where God
[1:37:12] maturity level where God can entrust us
[1:37:14] with it he's not going to withhold any
[1:37:16] good thing from us he never
[1:37:18] does the Bible says he
[1:37:21] doesn't he gives it to us but it's got
[1:37:24] to be to that place remember the man is
[1:37:27] not going to turn his Factory over to a
[1:37:29] son that is not worthy to run it he's
[1:37:32] not going to turn his business over to a
[1:37:34] son that's going to run it into the
[1:37:35] ground is going to bleed it dry for
[1:37:37] every penny it can get so he can fly
[1:37:39] around living up the good life as they
[1:37:41] call it he's going to do it when his son
[1:37:44] is responsible when his son is
[1:37:48] ready when his son is mature enough to
[1:37:51] be able to do it amen and a good father
[1:37:56] praise the Lord a good father which
[1:37:59] we're talking about God now of course a
[1:38:01] good father will have raised his child
[1:38:05] and spanked his child and corrected his
[1:38:09] child enough so that when they get to
[1:38:11] that place they're not a bunch of
[1:38:13] spoiled brats
[1:38:16] yeah amen praise the
[1:38:19] Lord if a if a if a father gets to that
[1:38:22] place they say well he's too he's too

[1:38:27] is that you're his

[1:38:41] have to correct

[1:38:45] wouldn't have to correct bring you back
[1:38:47] into amen God help us and we got to show
[1:38:51] that maturity that place where God came
[1:38:53] can entrust us Amen to to with the work

[1:44:36] wasn't bad uh going out was was fine uh
[1:44:40] still don't like American Airlines but
[1:44:41] that's beside the point uh I had a good
[1:44:44] week we just worked like 10hour days it
[1:44:47] wasn't uh wasn't very stressful wasn't
[1:44:49] too hard uh got a little extra sleep at
[1:44:52] night didn't have to fly out till like
[1:44:54] 10:00 on Saturday so uh but everything
[1:44:57] was safe and fine I appreciated because
[1:44:59] they were going a lot of storms going on
[1:45:01] Sunday when we got there um for the
[1:45:04] flight so I didn't you know it's um it
[1:45:07] it was kind of touch and go as to
[1:45:08] whether we were even able to get there
[1:45:10] but he actually got like to to
[1:45:13] California and he took a hard right and
[1:45:15] went straight North and then went
[1:45:18] straight East uh West into uh Fresno
[1:45:21] where we landed over the mountain
[1:45:22] Mountain to try to avoid all that storm
[1:45:25] and when we made that left turn to go
[1:45:27] over the mountains the plane just
[1:45:29] started floating around like this wind
[1:45:32] was hitting it and wind was we were
[1:45:34] hitting void spots it was and I just
[1:45:37] said
