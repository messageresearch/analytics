[38:18] back pain
[38:19] for over a week now and she went to the
[38:22] doctor last week and they can't they
[38:24] have no idea what it is so they did some
[38:27] blood tests and
[38:31] a couple other tests as well but
[38:33] she's hopefully going to hear or
[38:36] has really been excruciating thing for
[38:38] her
[38:39] so even ibuprofen they gave her some
[38:41] ibuprofen it's not even doing really
[38:43] anything to
[38:44] help relieve the pain so it's really
[38:49] really exceeds using things so it's just
[38:52] constant you know all day there's
[38:54] periods of time of the day where it's
[38:56] maybe like in the mornings where it's
[38:58] not so bad but
[39:00] not really bad
[39:02] to keep her in prayer please
[39:10] I have a bolster this um neighborhood
[39:14] stairs and
[39:15] something finally good that God did
[39:20] um there's a sign on this window that
[39:22] says I'm not a hospital if you're
[39:25] injured please do not come to eat this
[39:28] door instead seek Jesus Christ
[39:32] I think his mother probably put that
[39:35] sign oh because he's the opposite but
[39:37] that's a good sign that maybe he's
[39:40] starting to chill off
[39:44] yeah yes
[39:45] absolutely first and foremost that the
[39:49] Lord would move on to amen I have a lot
[39:51] of problems
[39:56] request of prayer and I appreciate your

[51:45] the last one of
[51:48] this series that we'll speak on today
[51:50] Amen on the Holy Spirit
[51:53] let's start again in Genesis chapter 3.
[51:56] verse 21.
[51:59] but the last part of this the last
[52:03] um
[52:04] part of this series that I want to bring
[52:05] today on representation
[52:08] the Holy Spirit and representation
[52:11] brother random spoke quite often about
[52:13] representation
[52:17] having representation if you are
[52:20] represented if you will in heaven Amen
[52:24] in that representation will take place
[52:26] here on Earth through US amen praise the
[52:30] Lord so last part says to be the Holy
[52:32] Spirit part 13. I want to speak on the
[52:35] representation of the Lord today but in

[54:31] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen
[54:35] Genesis chapter 3 verse 21
[54:38] and then uh unto Adam also unto his wife
[54:41] did the Lord God make coats of skins and
[54:44] clothe them amen you could be seated if
[54:47] you'd like
[54:49] want to go over to Saint John chapter 4
[54:51] Amen to start or Draw our context for
[54:54] this service today Saint John chapter 4
[54:58] we'll read uh kind of a story here
[55:03] I believe I've I've never done it but I
[55:05] believe I've heard some brothers before
[55:06] tell me that they've done a little uh
[55:09] homework study on uh the different
[55:12] stories that brother Branham would tell
[55:13] through the scripture or the scriptural
[55:15] stories and I believe a brother told me
[55:17] one time this story was the story that
[55:20] brother Branham referred to most often
[55:22] whether in ministering whether in prayer
[55:25] line whether in discernment or whatever
[55:27] it was that this story The scriptural
[55:29] story about the woman of Samaria was the
[55:32] number one story the number one biblical
[55:35] account that he spoke of the most amen
[55:39] and it just Falls in line with what we
[55:41] want to speak on today in this last part
[55:43] of representation amen representation
[55:46] Saint John chapter 4 now let's just
[55:49] begin reading with the first verse
[55:51] amen and we'll read through it just read
[55:53] this story sometimes we kind of take
[55:55] little excerpts at this story and pull
[55:57] them out but sometimes it's really good
[55:59] just to start at the beginning of it and
[56:01] see all the nuances as it flows through
[56:03] to bring it to the point that it got to
[56:05] because we know about the woman of
[56:06] Samaria and what she did and who she was
[56:09] and how this developed and things but
[56:12] you know sometimes we we forget about
[56:14] the operation of God and why God does
[56:17] the things he does and the way he does
[56:19] them and uh and and and and and what he
[56:23] did to bring us to where we are today
[56:24] yeah and how the Lord spoke to us and
[56:27] how the Lord brought us in amen and
[56:29] showed us this truth of this light amen
[56:32] Saint John chapter 4 let's begin with
[56:34] again verse one as we read
[56:37] when therefore the Lord knew how the
[56:40] Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and
[56:43] baptized more disciples than John though
[56:46] Jesus himself baptized not by his
[56:48] disciples he left Judea and departed
[56:51] again into Galilee
[56:53] and he must needs go through Samaria
[56:57] amen there's uh there was a purpose a
[57:00] reason uh it seemed like by the way the
[57:04] reading was this was out of the way this
[57:07] also was not a place that you would that
[57:10] a Jew would normally go to this is not
[57:13] something this is something very much
[57:15] out of the ordinary but Jesus needed to
[57:18] go that way this was something that the
[57:21] Lord had put and so many times that he
[57:24] does in our own lives where he leads us
[57:26] and puts us in places sometimes we don't
[57:29] want to go amen uh probably the most
[57:32] famous story about that is Jonah who
[57:35] absolutely so much so did not want to go
[57:37] he purposely headed in the opposite
[57:40] direction but God always makes a way to
[57:43] bring us to where we need to be amen but
[57:46] Jesus following the will of God knew
[57:49] that he needed to go through Samaria it
[57:51] was the time it was the place it was the
[57:53] person everything was right for the
[57:56] stage to be set for what was about to
[57:58] unfold
[57:59] so many times when we're LED of the Lord
[58:01] and God brings us to places or shows us
[58:04] things sort of like brother random when
[58:06] he the plane landed in Memphis and told
[58:08] him to walk he didn't know where he was
[58:09] going he didn't know what was going to
[58:11] happen he didn't know it was going to
[58:12] meet somebody he was he was thinking
[58:14] about messing his plane to go to his
[58:17] destination but the Lord had a plan God
[58:20] had something he needed to do so you
[58:23] could encouple this just like things in
[58:25] our life I'm not trying to put brother
[58:27] random on something extraordinary that
[58:29] he doesn't do for us because he does he
[58:32] leads us and guides us and things like
[58:34] this happen all the sometimes we don't
[58:36] understand or know why these things are
[58:38] happening but sometimes we can look back
[58:40] and understand Lord this is these things
[58:43] unfolded the way they did because of
[58:45] this it brought us to this place it it
[58:47] brought me here so uh this brought Jesus
[58:51] to this place he needed to go through
[58:53] Samaria amen it was God's will
[58:57] then cometh he to a city of Samaria
[59:00] which is called psychar near to the
[59:03] parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his
[59:05] son Joseph
[59:07] now Jacob's Well was there Jesus
[59:09] therefore being wearied with his journey
[59:11] sat thus on the wall and it was about
[59:13] the sixth hour now obviously there's
[59:17] some carnality to this you can read into
[59:20] this that Jesus purposely said on the
[59:22] well because he knew who was about to
[59:25] come to the well but the scripture says
[59:28] he was veered and thirsty so he sat on
[59:31] the well now a lot of times when we're
[59:33] LED of God and God is leading us and all
[59:37] of this of course uh brings us around to
[59:40] the representation of God in our lives
[59:42] which is nothing more than what we've
[59:44] been talking about of the seed of God
[59:46] the seed of God in you in you is the
[59:50] representation that God put in you from
[59:52] before the foundation of the world Amen
[59:55] and this representation just brings us
[59:58] to the understanding that we know that
[1:00:00] it was always there this representation
[1:00:02] that God put in you was always there it
[1:00:06] never was a time that in your life that
[1:00:08] it was not there and it was just that
[1:00:11] one time that that that that light was
[1:00:13] to strike that seed that Spirit was to
[1:00:16] strike that seed to bring that seed to
[1:00:18] life but along that Journey
[1:00:21] so many times we do things that we don't
[1:00:24] understand or we do things that happens
[1:00:26] to us that brings us to certain places
[1:00:29] that we might not understand at the time
[1:00:32] but God is working a work God you have
[1:00:36] to always remember Saints God is always
[1:00:39] working a work in your life always
[1:00:42] uh brother Pat talks about puts it the
[1:00:45] way that God's messing with him uh
[1:00:47] that's brother Pat's way of putting it
[1:00:48] but it's a work that God's working in
[1:00:50] all of your life he is always where if
[1:00:53] you have representation you are born
[1:00:55] again you're one of his he is always
[1:00:58] working a work in your life no matter
[1:01:00] where you are no matter who you're with
[1:01:02] no matter what's going on around you no
[1:01:04] matter what of the physical aspects any
[1:01:06] of those things all those work around to
[1:01:09] bring about the perfect will of God
[1:01:11] because God is always working his
[1:01:14] perfect will if you let him in your life
[1:01:17] amen God's will is continuously working
[1:01:20] so it just says
[1:01:23] Jesus being worried from his journey set
[1:01:26] down on the well so that's what we
[1:01:27] that's what we see that's what we hear
[1:01:29] that's what God wrote that's what we
[1:01:31] believe amen why was it to that place at
[1:01:34] that time that he sat down
[1:01:36] amen God knows there cometh the woman of
[1:01:40] Samaria to draw water Jesus said unto
[1:01:44] her give me to drink now it begins
[1:01:48] for his disciples were gone away into
[1:01:50] the city to buy meat then saith the
[1:01:53] woman again on another example of the
[1:01:56] little nuances of a story that brings us
[1:02:00] to the part where we need to be amen the
[1:02:03] disciples were gone into the city to get
[1:02:05] meat so who was there to help service
[1:02:07] Jesus the woman she was the only one
[1:02:11] that was there then at that time they
[1:02:14] thought they they might have thought
[1:02:15] they were just going to go get some meat
[1:02:17] amen but God had a greater purpose
[1:02:19] because there was to be a time now to
[1:02:22] where it was just going to be Jesus and
[1:02:24] the woman of Samaria at that will praise
[1:02:27] the Lord I just love you see how God
[1:02:30] works everything out so perfectly amen
[1:02:32] you just you just don't understand you
[1:02:35] just don't know I it just keeps coming
[1:02:37] back to my mind I wasn't going to say it
[1:02:39] but it just reminds me of the story when
[1:02:41] my wife was in Nogales and uh all the
[1:02:44] kids had to go out and the nuns gave
[1:02:46] them money to go buy tortillas for the
[1:02:48] day but they weren't supposed to buy the
[1:02:49] tortillas they were supposed to steal
[1:02:51] them but they had money to buy them that
[1:02:53] they were supposed to take the order in
[1:02:55] before they could pay they were supposed
[1:02:56] to run out and run back to the Catholic
[1:02:58] orphanage because the nuns were teaching
[1:03:00] them how to steal to live on the street
[1:03:02] because when you become of age you
[1:03:05] either got kicked out on the street or
[1:03:06] you become a nun that was your two
[1:03:08] choices so they would tell them they
[1:03:10] would they would teach him how to be
[1:03:11] religious and holy and then they would
[1:03:13] teach them how to steal and be a thug
[1:03:15] and so this is the time that a lot of
[1:03:18] the they would send out to go says she
[1:03:20] took the money and she went out there to
[1:03:22] go uh to go steal those tortillas it was
[1:03:24] like any other day any other girl any
[1:03:27] other circumstance that those that that
[1:03:28] church would send her out for but she
[1:03:30] went there she had the money in her
[1:03:32] pocket she got the tortilla and
[1:03:34] something told her to wait in line to
[1:03:36] pay for them knowing what was going to
[1:03:39] happen to him knowing that there was
[1:03:41] that there was a beating waiting on her
[1:03:43] by the nuns when she got back to the
[1:03:45] orphan she knew that was going to happen
[1:03:46] to happen to anybody that disobeyed them
[1:03:49] they got a beaten and she didn't know
[1:03:52] what her body was like without bruises
[1:03:53] until she got adopted later on uh
[1:03:57] because he just they beat him all the
[1:03:58] time for anything and everything and
[1:04:00] even if they didn't do anything wrong
[1:04:01] but it just remind me it's just like
[1:04:03] another day uh it's just another day
[1:04:06] it's just another day for This Woman
[1:04:08] This Sumerian woman is she's just going
[1:04:10] to the well like she always did and she
[1:04:13] went because of her character because of
[1:04:15] the life that she had lived I won't call
[1:04:17] it her character but because of the life
[1:04:19] she had lived brother Brown dramatized
[1:04:21] this a little bit further than I'm going
[1:04:23] to today to talk about how this girl is
[1:04:25] a little girl might have been kicked out
[1:04:27] on the street maybe abused by her father
[1:04:30] and things like that that caused her to
[1:04:32] be this way but all the time that even
[1:04:35] though she was in those circumstances or
[1:04:37] whatever she went through to bring her
[1:04:39] to this place she always had something
[1:04:41] in her that identified who she really
[1:04:43] was she didn't know it she didn't
[1:04:46] recognize it at the time and because of
[1:04:48] who she was because of the way that she
[1:04:51] had lived her life she was supposed to
[1:04:53] come to the well by herself she could
[1:04:56] not come to the well with all the other
[1:04:58] women she could not come with anybody
[1:05:00] she had to go by herself because she was
[1:05:03] considered a woman of the old Fame but
[1:05:06] there was a man that was going to be
[1:05:07] there that was going to meet her on this
[1:05:09] day like any other day but this day was
[1:05:12] going to change your life amen
[1:05:15] for his disciples went away to buy meat
[1:05:17] so it had to be all you notice how all
[1:05:20] the circumstances just developed to
[1:05:22] where it brought about this this
[1:05:24] tremendous time of Jesus meeting with
[1:05:26] this woman the will of God God makes God
[1:05:29] can call all circumstances to bring it
[1:05:32] about to where it it brings about his
[1:05:35] perfect will Amen in all of our Lives we
[1:05:38] just have to be willing to follow it yes
[1:05:39] that's all just be willing to follow it
[1:05:41] then set the woman of Sumerian to him
[1:05:44] how is it that thou being a Jew ask this
[1:05:47] drink of me which I am a woman of
[1:05:49] Samaria for the Jews have no dealings
[1:05:50] with the Samaritans Jesus answered and
[1:05:53] said unto her if thou knewest the gifted
[1:05:55] now look what he's doing because there's
[1:05:57] another story I want to read before we
[1:05:59] finish this today that's going to be
[1:06:01] just the opposite but it's going to
[1:06:04] follow the same pattern so listen as we
[1:06:06] go through it Jesus answered if thou
[1:06:09] knew it's the gift of God and who it is
[1:06:12] that sanity give me to drink thou
[1:06:15] wouldst have asked of him and he would
[1:06:17] have given the Living Water
[1:06:20] the woman said unto him sir thou has
[1:06:24] nothing to draw with and the well is
[1:06:26] deep from Winston hast thou that Living
[1:06:28] Water art thou greater than our father
[1:06:31] Jacob which gave us the will and drank
[1:06:33] thereof himself and his children his
[1:06:35] cattle
[1:06:36] Jesus answered and said unto her
[1:06:38] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[1:06:41] thirst again but whosoever drinketh of
[1:06:44] the water that I shall give him shall
[1:06:47] never thirst but the water that I shall
[1:06:49] give him shall be in him a well of water
[1:06:52] springing up into everlasting life amen
[1:06:55] now it's triggered something in this
[1:06:57] moment she's she's thought carnal all
[1:07:00] this time
[1:07:01] and she continues to just like just like
[1:07:05] any any of us in our Humanity uh that we
[1:07:09] do so often amen revert back to the
[1:07:12] carnality revert back to the humanity
[1:07:14] but Jesus is speaking to her of things
[1:07:17] of the spirit of Eternity of eternal
[1:07:20] life
[1:07:21] the woman said unto him sir give me this
[1:07:24] water that I thirst not neither come
[1:07:27] hither to draw
[1:07:29] again still thinking in the carnal
[1:07:32] Jesus said unto her but see so there's
[1:07:35] something there remember the story when
[1:07:38] a woman came up and brother ran a master
[1:07:40] uh do you believe oh yes I believe do
[1:07:43] you have faith oh yes I have faith but
[1:07:46] brother random could see in the woman
[1:07:47] that she didn't have what it what she
[1:07:50] needed to get the healing that she was
[1:07:52] looking for to get the prayer request
[1:07:54] answered she was looking for she needed
[1:07:57] her faith to get stronger she needed her
[1:07:59] faith to build a little bit and build a
[1:08:01] little bit so brother random said you go
[1:08:03] over here sister and sit down for a
[1:08:05] little bit and just watch the line as it
[1:08:07] comes through see the moving of God and
[1:08:09] all that God does and so she went over
[1:08:12] and sat down and uh one person after the
[1:08:16] other to the point that P that people
[1:08:18] started saying that uh that brother
[1:08:20] Brown forgot all about her he can't help
[1:08:23] her so he just set her over there and
[1:08:24] forgot about her and then pretty soon
[1:08:27] after so and so people he said okay now
[1:08:30] come on up amen what was he doing he was
[1:08:33] doing just like Jesus did here probably
[1:08:36] the reason that this story was mentioned
[1:08:38] so much by Brother Brown for the similar
[1:08:40] gift that was there God the discernment
[1:08:43] so Jesus sees that she's hungry she sees
[1:08:46] he sees that there's something in her
[1:08:48] that's different and because she now
[1:08:51] wants what he's talking about
[1:08:55] but but she's not quite there yet so he
[1:08:57] says go call thy husband and come hither
[1:09:00] now what's that got to do with any of it
[1:09:03] what has that got to do with any of this
[1:09:06] whole story and everything that's gone
[1:09:07] along what has that got to do with
[1:09:09] drinking water or having an everlasting
[1:09:11] water or anything I mean could you
[1:09:13] imagine if you've gone through this
[1:09:14] verbiage this conversation and you've
[1:09:17] talked about water this whole time being
[1:09:19] thirsty wanting water giving you a walk
[1:09:21] giving you water that you'll never
[1:09:23] thirst again and all that Jesus told her
[1:09:25] and then all of a sudden he stops and
[1:09:27] says well go get your husband what's
[1:09:28] that got to do with it
[1:09:31] amen but God's testing or God again is
[1:09:35] speaking because there's something that
[1:09:36] he's trying to reach down in her just
[1:09:39] like that woman that said over there was
[1:09:41] something that when brother Bannon said
[1:09:42] over the side there was something that
[1:09:44] needed to come in her more than what she
[1:09:45] had so that she could recognize it to
[1:09:48] raise to receive it now when he says go
[1:09:52] get the husband you could think well
[1:09:53] what's that got to do with anything but
[1:09:55] the woman answered and said I have no
[1:09:58] husband
[1:09:59] Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said
[1:10:02] I have no husband for thou has had five
[1:10:05] husbands and he who now now has is not
[1:10:09] thine husband in that set is thou truly
[1:10:12] now he's showing the sign of Messiah
[1:10:15] the woman saith unto him sir I perceive
[1:10:19] that thou art a prophet amen the
[1:10:22] resulting issue of what of what was
[1:10:25] going on in this conversation
[1:10:28] this woman now after after the sign of
[1:10:32] Messiah amen after the messiah messiah
[1:10:36] was given this woman could see right in
[1:10:38] front of her the sign of Messiah coming
[1:10:41] through the prayer lines it raised her
[1:10:43] to the place she realized she was in the
[1:10:46] presence of something other than
[1:10:48] Humanity she was in the presence of
[1:10:51] something other than and greater than
[1:10:53] brother Branham or a prophet she was in
[1:10:57] the presence of of God Amen this woman
[1:11:00] began to realize she was in a presence
[1:11:02] different she was in a presence that
[1:11:05] that transcended Humanity in carnally
[1:11:08] she was in the presence of God
[1:11:11] and she said unto him sir I perceived
[1:11:14] that thou art a prophet our fathers
[1:11:17] worshiped in this mountain see now now
[1:11:19] when she says this
[1:11:21] she reverts back to the one thing that
[1:11:26] that she could remember and that came
[1:11:29] back to her how many times you witnessed
[1:11:32] a people and they're living horrible
[1:11:34] lives maybe they're in horrible
[1:11:36] situations but you just got an inkling
[1:11:40] or talk to him about the Lord just a
[1:11:42] little bit and they and and that person
[1:11:45] invariably most of the time if they
[1:11:47] don't just uh uh push brush you off they
[1:11:51] revert back to the one time or the one
[1:11:54] place or the one situation or the one
[1:11:58] church service or the one Bible
[1:12:00] scripture or something that they revert
[1:12:02] back to that they remember that was
[1:12:05] about Christianity that was about God
[1:12:08] that was about something greater and
[1:12:10] more than the life they were living at
[1:12:12] the time this woman has got to that
[1:12:15] place she's now reverting back too so
[1:12:18] there was a time in her life
[1:12:20] where there was something spoke to her
[1:12:23] about
[1:12:24] we'll just say religion or God liness
[1:12:28] because when God when Jesus begins to
[1:12:32] speak to her like this her she reverts
[1:12:35] because she really thou art a prophet
[1:12:38] and she reverts back to that thing that
[1:12:40] she knew
[1:12:42] our fathers Worship in this mountain and
[1:12:44] ye say that in Jerusalem is the place
[1:12:46] where men ought to worship doesn't sound
[1:12:49] like a red like woman
[1:12:52] she's not speaking like the light that
[1:12:54] she's living why because she's not the
[1:12:58] life that she's living she's a child of
[1:13:00] God
[1:13:01] and God's about to show her that yes
[1:13:03] she's about to realize that and that
[1:13:06] representation that was always in her is
[1:13:09] about to take hold and she starts and
[1:13:11] she's going to begin to realize now who
[1:13:13] she really is praise the Lord oh I I
[1:13:17] think about her but you know what I
[1:13:19] think more than that is me
[1:13:21] I think about myself and I think about
[1:13:24] what the Lord did for me and where he
[1:13:26] brought me from him too and I thought
[1:13:27] and when it come to the realization and
[1:13:30] the Revelation that you're more than
[1:13:32] what you have become
[1:13:34] praise God Amen when God reveals that to
[1:13:37] you Saints there's not a devil in hell
[1:13:39] can rob that from you yes there's not a
[1:13:42] devil I hell that can try to steal that
[1:13:44] from you or get you to disbelieve or see
[1:13:46] anything different because you know that
[1:13:49] you're a child of God that in you always
[1:13:52] in you was this representation
[1:13:55] was this God that was always there that
[1:13:58] seed of life that seed of God that was
[1:14:00] that attribute of God was always there
[1:14:03] and it finally come to the place of
[1:14:05] realization and like I said the other
[1:14:08] day you start to begin to I did start to
[1:14:10] begin to understand why I was the way I
[1:14:13] was
[1:14:14] why did the things I did as a boy why
[1:14:17] act the way I did and why I felt
[1:14:19] different and why I never felt as good
[1:14:21] of friends as I had growing up why I
[1:14:24] knew that I was not like them
[1:14:26] I knew I wasn't like them I knew I
[1:14:29] wasn't a part of them they were my best
[1:14:32] friends and I'd love anything in the
[1:14:34] world to try to lead them to Christ
[1:14:35] today if they aren't already I hope they
[1:14:37] are amen but I knew I was different
[1:14:40] you know there's something she knew
[1:14:43] there's something there and she starts
[1:14:45] to realize this and she speaks to Jesus
[1:14:48] Christ God almighty and flesh in front
[1:14:50] of her
[1:14:51] Jesus said unto her woman
[1:14:53] believe me the hour cometh when ye shall
[1:14:56] neither in this mountain nor yet at
[1:14:59] Jerusalem worship the father
[1:15:01] ye worship ye know not what we worship
[1:15:04] uh we know what we worship for
[1:15:06] salvations of the Jews but the hour
[1:15:09] coming
[1:15:10] and now is
[1:15:12] see the transition yes amen the
[1:15:15] transition's already in place now is
[1:15:18] when the true worshipers amen just like
[1:15:22] sister matisse's song the true
[1:15:25] worshipers is that you
[1:15:27] amen praise the Lord the true worshiper
[1:15:30] shall worship the father in spirit and
[1:15:34] in truth for the father seeketh such to
[1:15:37] worship him what is that worship that
[1:15:39] worship is the Dynamics in the mechanics
[1:15:43] yes the Dynamics is the spirit and the
[1:15:46] mechanics is the truth
[1:15:48] those that worship Him must worship Him
[1:15:50] in spirit and in truth we are led by the
[1:15:53] spirit through the word of God
[1:15:56] amen God is a spirit and they that
[1:15:59] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[1:16:02] and in truth praise God the spirit the
[1:16:06] Holy Spirit and the truth of God's word
[1:16:09] mechanics and Dynamics working together
[1:16:12] to fire this machine that God has
[1:16:14] created on this Earth for us to live now
[1:16:17] we walk by God we walk by the spirit not
[1:16:20] by the flesh amen
[1:16:23] by the spirit is how we walk remember
[1:16:25] that we walk by the spirit that's how we
[1:16:28] walk that's how we live our lives by the
[1:16:30] spirit of God that leads us because that
[1:16:33] little germ that was in you was to be
[1:16:35] you from before the foundation of the
[1:16:36] world has found you and now that life is
[1:16:39] common is living in you that leads you
[1:16:41] and guides you into all truth
[1:16:44] it's happening to this woman right here
[1:16:46] amen the woman saith unto him I know
[1:16:49] that Messiah comes see now she's going
[1:16:52] back I know that she's reaching back
[1:16:54] she's she's going back before these five
[1:16:57] husbands and the one she's living with
[1:16:58] it's not her husband she's going back
[1:17:01] before all that any of that all those
[1:17:03] things that she went through amen the
[1:17:06] woman said I know the Messiah cometh
[1:17:08] which is called Christ when he is come
[1:17:11] he will tell us all things
[1:17:14] Jesus said unto her I that speak unto
[1:17:18] thee am he I'm he I'm the Messiah amen
[1:17:23] one of the very few places in the
[1:17:26] scripture you'll find that brother that
[1:17:27] that Jesus Christ actually tells and
[1:17:30] admits to someone he is that Messiah yes
[1:17:33] amen
[1:17:35] I that speak to thee am he he is that
[1:17:38] Messiah praise the Lord and upon this
[1:17:41] came his disciples and Marvel that he
[1:17:43] talked with this woman yet no man said
[1:17:45] what seeketh thou or why talk is thou
[1:17:47] with her it's very unusual obviously two
[1:17:51] two reasons two main reasons this was
[1:17:53] very unusual again like we said the two
[1:17:55] main reasons the one the the Jews and
[1:17:58] Samaritans had no dealings they were
[1:18:00] considered unclean the Jews were not
[1:18:03] supposed to have any kind of dealings
[1:18:04] with those that were considered unclean
[1:18:06] amen but remember in I think it's in
[1:18:10] Acts where Jesus where God speaks to
[1:18:13] Peter and says consider no man unclean
[1:18:17] go to all world go to all the world go
[1:18:20] to All Nations don't consider them
[1:18:22] unclean go give them the gospel go tell
[1:18:25] them about Jesus go tell them about me
[1:18:27] don't consider them unclean don't stay
[1:18:30] away from them
[1:18:31] do what you can to help them to save
[1:18:33] them to to preach the gospel to them
[1:18:36] amen
[1:18:37] but at that time it was considered uh uh
[1:18:41] unclean it was considered not acceptable
[1:18:43] not to mention the fact that she of
[1:18:46] course was a woman of the old Fame she'd
[1:18:49] had these husbands and it were hers and
[1:18:51] she was living that read that life of of
[1:18:54] a harlot at the time
[1:18:57] he and
[1:19:00] look now at 27th verse and and upon this
[1:19:03] came his disciples marveled and what
[1:19:06] seek is thou or why talk us without her
[1:19:08] he they didn't ask the woman that left
[1:19:10] her water park pot and went her way into
[1:19:13] the City and saith to the men
[1:19:16] say it to the men now this was
[1:19:18] absolutely something forbidden for a
[1:19:22] woman of her
[1:19:23] stature to go and talk to these men
[1:19:26] come see a man which told me all things
[1:19:28] that ever I did is not this is not this
[1:19:33] the Christ amen
[1:19:35] amen then they went out of the city and
[1:19:37] came unto him her her confession her uh
[1:19:40] our testimony was so compelling so
[1:19:44] believable that these men listen to her
[1:19:47] a woman that they weren't even supposed
[1:19:49] to talk to her she talked to them
[1:19:51] have no dealings at all they listened
[1:19:54] her she was so convincing and compelling
[1:19:57] they actually listened and went to find
[1:20:00] out who she was talking about
[1:20:01] that's that's pretty outstanding amen
[1:20:06] in the meanwhile's disciples prayed him
[1:20:08] saying Master E and he said unto them I
[1:20:12] have meat to eat that ye know not of
[1:20:15] we'll talk about that meat again a
[1:20:17] little bit thereof said the uh therefore
[1:20:20] said the APO the disciples one to
[1:20:22] another hath any man brought him ought
[1:20:24] to eat they're thinking carnal
[1:20:28] Jesus said unto them my meat is what to
[1:20:33] do the will of him that sent me
[1:20:35] praise God that's our me our meat is to
[1:20:39] do God's will that's how we live that's
[1:20:41] how we survive that's what our
[1:20:43] sustaining substance is is uh that is
[1:20:46] our meat is to do the will of God Amen
[1:20:49] that's why we're here that's our purpose
[1:20:51] in life and that's what that's the
[1:20:53] number one Focus that we have is to do
[1:20:56] the will of him that sent me and to
[1:20:58] finish his work to finish his word no
[1:21:01] wonder Jesus cried on the cross and is
[1:21:02] finished when he was taking his last
[1:21:04] breath and said it is finished the work
[1:21:07] of God that God had for him to
[1:21:09] accomplish was finished at that time
[1:21:11] amen but you recognized it wasn't just
[1:21:14] Jesus
[1:21:16] Paul himself said I have run the course
[1:21:19] I have kept the faith I have I have uh
[1:21:22] run the race I have uh now it's time
[1:21:25] that might be offered up my I have
[1:21:27] finished my course my time is over I
[1:21:30] have accomplished what God has put me on
[1:21:31] this Earth to accomplish and I'm ready
[1:21:34] to be offered up
[1:21:35] not just Paul either for every one of us
[1:21:38] there's work that God remember I said
[1:21:40] God has the work that he's working in
[1:21:43] every one of us and we want to do
[1:21:45] everything we can as long as there's
[1:21:47] breath in our body to complete the work
[1:21:49] to finish the work that God has called
[1:21:53] and commissioned for us to do it wasn't
[1:21:55] just Jesus that had a word it wasn't
[1:21:57] just him that had a work that was to be
[1:21:59] finished every one of us have a work
[1:22:02] that we work something we do our lives
[1:22:05] the will of God to be uh to be
[1:22:07] exemplified from us and to be
[1:22:10] accomplished through us to the point
[1:22:12] that we can get to the place that Paul
[1:22:14] was
[1:22:14] and see I've I have can't I've run the
[1:22:17] race I have kept the faith I'm ready to
[1:22:20] be offered up I finished my course I've
[1:22:23] done what God has asked me to do I have
[1:22:26] led by his spirit and whatever he's had
[1:22:28] for me to do I've done it
[1:22:30] finish his work say not ye there are yet
[1:22:35] four months and then cometh Harvest
[1:22:37] behold I say unto you lift up your eyes
[1:22:39] and look at the fields for their white
[1:22:41] already to harvest
[1:22:43] and he uh and he that reapeth receiveth
[1:22:45] wages and gather fruit unto the light
[1:22:47] unto life eternal both he that soweth
[1:22:51] and he that readeth may gather Rejoice
[1:22:53] together
[1:22:54] and herein is that same true one soweth
[1:22:57] and another man wreath it
[1:23:00] I sent you to read that whereon ye
[1:23:03] bestow no labor other men labored and ye
[1:23:05] are entered into their labors now listen
[1:23:07] to this last verse is 39th verse I
[1:23:10] should say and many
[1:23:12] many of the Samaritans of that City
[1:23:16] believed on Jesus believed on him
[1:23:20] for the same
[1:23:22] of the woman
[1:23:24] raise the Lord
[1:23:26] which Justified he told me all that ever
[1:23:28] I did
[1:23:29] they were saved they recognized Christ
[1:23:33] and received life because of her
[1:23:36] testimony
[1:23:38] it doesn't say that they that they uh
[1:23:41] believe because of him because of Jesus
[1:23:44] but because of the woman saying the
[1:23:48] saying of the woman
[1:23:50] praise the Lord
[1:23:52] how many Souls now be accounted to her
[1:23:54] because of what she did there on that
[1:23:56] day it doesn't matter what her
[1:23:57] background was doesn't matter what she
[1:23:59] gonna do didn't matter what her past was
[1:24:01] like amen that was irrelevant at the
[1:24:04] point amen the point was that Jesus
[1:24:06] found her because he had to go through
[1:24:08] some
[1:24:09] and when he found her he spoke to her he
[1:24:12] energized or or brought to life that
[1:24:15] that that representation that was always
[1:24:17] in her that she saw something and it was
[1:24:21] so real and so convincing and so true
[1:24:23] and so compelling that she told the men
[1:24:26] of that City and many of that City come
[1:24:29] to be Believers on Jesus Christ because
[1:24:32] of her testimony amen reminds me of that
[1:24:35] washed woman brother Bradham talked
[1:24:36] about
[1:24:37] that little wash woman is a minister
[1:24:39] coming through town and she she washed
[1:24:42] clothes for like a dime a week or
[1:24:44] something and she's a little watched
[1:24:46] when I saw she did she washed clothes
[1:24:48] her whole life that was her whole living
[1:24:50] and she heard about this Minister that
[1:24:52] was coming and she wanted to be a help
[1:24:53] and he was coming to town
[1:24:55] and she washed woman and and she was
[1:24:58] doing all she can and she gave up she
[1:25:01] gave what she could to try to help
[1:25:02] support this man and nobody came it was
[1:25:04] it was a a barn and hardly anybody
[1:25:08] noticed hardly anybody cared it was
[1:25:11] insignificant to the world standards uh
[1:25:14] which most of the time any work of God
[1:25:15] really is any work of God generally is
[1:25:18] insignificant to the world standards but
[1:25:21] there was something in her heart that
[1:25:23] she wanted to do for God
[1:25:25] so she tried and she tried to do what
[1:25:28] she can to try to help this and and and
[1:25:30] through her efforts one little young boy
[1:25:33] coming he sat in the back
[1:25:35] and this preacher preached and when he
[1:25:37] got done this little boy came up to the
[1:25:39] Altar and gave his life to Jesus Christ
[1:25:41] amen that little boy turned out to be
[1:25:44] Dwight Moody Dwight Moody who led how
[1:25:47] many half a million souls to Jesus
[1:25:49] Christ that little woman she went back
[1:25:51] to washing clothes for a dime a week but
[1:25:54] every soul that came as a result of
[1:25:56] Dwight Moody is going to be on her
[1:25:58] account
[1:25:59] amen for what she did for that at that
[1:26:03] time for that meeting to bring that boy
[1:26:05] to Jesus Christ amen you never know
[1:26:08] Saints all we do is what we do with the
[1:26:10] Lord wash wash wash do something for God
[1:26:13] and just continue on life amen she
[1:26:16] probably now she may have never even
[1:26:17] known but God had a work for her to do
[1:26:20] and she fulfills that that was in her
[1:26:22] heart to do amen just like this woman
[1:26:26] there was something in her that called
[1:26:28] out there was a representation
[1:26:30] something that represented look that
[1:26:33] represents it it's something if you
[1:26:35] think about in the worldly standards uh
[1:26:38] someone that represents you probably the
[1:26:40] greatest example we have is maybe in
[1:26:42] court with a lawyer
[1:26:45] a lawyer is something that uh that that
[1:26:48] uh someone either hires or is appointed
[1:26:51] to you by the state
[1:26:53] it's someone it's it's someone who is
[1:26:55] supposed to stand for you someone who's
[1:26:58] supposed to speak on your behalf someone
[1:27:01] is supposed to have your best interest
[1:27:03] at heart someone who's supposed to stand
[1:27:05] in proxy to represent what you think and
[1:27:08] what you feel and what you've been
[1:27:10] through it and everything about it
[1:27:12] everything about a situation or your
[1:27:14] life that person is supposed to
[1:27:16] represent you in that capacity before a
[1:27:20] judge
[1:27:22] that that judge May recognize by the
[1:27:25] spokesman who this person really is amen
[1:27:29] that representation that is in you is
[1:27:32] something that speaks for you every day
[1:27:34] it stands on your behalf and in Acts and
[1:27:38] it speaks on your behalf is something
[1:27:41] that you can identify with
[1:27:43] an identity like being heirs we sang the
[1:27:48] song being Heirs of the father Heirs of
[1:27:50] God Heirs of one another it's an
[1:27:52] identity
[1:27:54] we have names that we have we have
[1:27:57] surnames mine's Bennett uh Katie
[1:28:00] different names we have surnames that we
[1:28:02] go by and and those names are something
[1:28:06] that identifies Who We Are
[1:28:08] it doesn't it transcends just being a
[1:28:11] human or or even even George Newton
[1:28:15] Bennett III it transcends being a
[1:28:18] Bennett or a Newton Bennett it's
[1:28:21] something that identifies me personally
[1:28:23] it separates me even from my dad because
[1:28:26] he was Junior and I'm third
[1:28:28] makes me a separate individual is
[1:28:31] something we identify with being a child
[1:28:33] of God being a part of the family of God
[1:28:36] is an identity that you have it's a
[1:28:40] representation that you have that shows
[1:28:42] this is who you really are
[1:28:45] you're not this person that the world
[1:28:47] has carved out or what you were when you
[1:28:50] were born or your childhood or something
[1:28:52] you are really truly a son or daughter
[1:28:55] of God through God's representation
[1:28:58] identifying now before the Throne of God
[1:29:02] but Before the Throne of God what stands
[1:29:05] in your place
[1:29:07] you have an advocate
[1:29:10] you you have a representative
[1:29:14] you have something that stands there
[1:29:16] before you and God
[1:29:18] amen I know people want to to this day
[1:29:20] they want to they try so hard to get
[1:29:22] that blood off the emergency friend but
[1:29:24] every time I read the scripture I see
[1:29:25] what brother Branham preached I look at
[1:29:27] God's revealing of me to the word all I
[1:29:29] can see is that precious blood laying
[1:29:32] there is my Advocate that stands between
[1:29:34] me and God you know brother random said
[1:29:37] God can't even hear your prayers if that
[1:29:39] blood's not there the only way your
[1:29:41] prayer your words can get through to God
[1:29:43] it's because you have an advocate you
[1:29:45] have a representative that's standing
[1:29:47] there on your behalf that shows that
[1:29:49] this person is not what the world says
[1:29:51] they are it's not who the devil says
[1:29:54] they are this is a child of God
[1:29:56] amen and when God looks through that red
[1:29:59] blood to the Red Sin it's white as snow
[1:30:02] yes you are Justified as though you
[1:30:06] never did it yes without spot wrinkle or
[1:30:08] blemish before God almighty your
[1:30:11] representative that's what a
[1:30:13] representative is look
[1:30:16] brother Ram talks about this one on one
[1:30:19] part of the little story that we just
[1:30:21] read
[1:30:23] identified Christ of all ages 1964.
[1:30:28] now what I'm speaking here to a person
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:31] who actually cannot receive it
[1:30:34] there's nothing in them to receive from
[1:30:39] the Bible says that she lives in
[1:30:41] pleasure she is dead while she is alive
[1:30:44] why was it why was these Pharisees
[1:30:48] look at Jesus
[1:30:50] he was the manifested word of God we
[1:30:53] believe that the Bible says he was
[1:30:55] well watch when he done his Masonic sign
[1:30:58] the Pharisees that had a little bit of
[1:31:01] light they had there was good people
[1:31:04] lived a good
[1:31:06] religious life
[1:31:08] they had they actually had a little
[1:31:11] light about them
[1:31:13] they had organized themselves into a
[1:31:16] priesthood they had a little light but
[1:31:18] down in the bottom of their hearts they
[1:31:21] had no Eternal representation
[1:31:25] in glory
[1:31:26] so when they seen that Supernatural done
[1:31:29] they said this man is the devil
[1:31:31] look at just the opposite
[1:31:33] just the opposite of when he did the
[1:31:35] exact same thing in the presence of the
[1:31:38] woman of Samaria
[1:31:39] on the old Fame woman a woman who no one
[1:31:42] had wanted to have anything to do with
[1:31:44] for her her life that she was living
[1:31:46] they wanted to keep their children as
[1:31:48] far away from this woman as they
[1:31:50] possibly could yet in her was that
[1:31:52] representation
[1:31:54] you know brother Brent God told Brother
[1:31:56] random because many times
[1:31:58] brother random lashed out at the sin of
[1:32:02] the world called the young people the
[1:32:04] rickies and rickettas
[1:32:05] and God rebuked him one day and said
[1:32:08] quit calling them that some of them is
[1:32:10] my children
[1:32:11] amen we don't know that we we see it and
[1:32:15] we we we can't look beyond that Veil
[1:32:18] right sometimes to see what's down in
[1:32:21] there
[1:32:22] it's representation but they here had no
[1:32:26] representation so when life presented
[1:32:28] itself what did they do they rejected it
[1:32:31] they had no representation in glory they
[1:32:34] called him a devil
[1:32:36] he showed the Masonic sign and they
[1:32:39] called him a devil
[1:32:41] but here was a little ill-fained woman a
[1:32:43] prostitute but down in her heart she had
[1:32:47] a representation of one of God's
[1:32:49] thoughts that's that seed praise the
[1:32:53] Lord that attribute of God there she was
[1:32:56] wait in sin
[1:32:58] but when she seen that happen she said
[1:33:01] sir I believe the thou art a prophet I
[1:33:04] know the Messiah coming and Jesus said I
[1:33:06] am he
[1:33:07] praise the Lord he said I am he and she
[1:33:10] threw down on her water pot and the only
[1:33:12] thing she was thinking about was letting
[1:33:14] other people know that she had found or
[1:33:16] she had ran across the Messiah that
[1:33:18] they've been praying for for hundreds of
[1:33:19] years that was prophesied by Isaiah here
[1:33:23] he is I've met him he did exactly what
[1:33:26] the scripture said he would do now look
[1:33:28] what they did
[1:33:30] in Matthew chapter 12.
[1:33:35] um
[1:33:37] Matthew chapter 12.
[1:33:40] now look God's gonna come by everybody's
[1:33:43] path
[1:33:45] everybody has a chance at Salvation if
[1:33:48] they don't God's not a just God
[1:33:51] if anybody says that God in some way
[1:33:54] sometimes has ever passed their way some
[1:33:57] way some capacity God has to come by
[1:34:00] every everybody's way in some way at
[1:34:03] some time God crosses everybody's path
[1:34:05] and gives everybody a chance to repent
[1:34:07] everyone has that opportunity now look
[1:34:11] Matthew chapter 12 let's begin reading
[1:34:13] verse 22.
[1:34:16] then was brought unto him one possessed
[1:34:19] with the Devil
[1:34:20] blinded dumb and he healed him in so
[1:34:24] much that the Blind and dumb both spoke
[1:34:26] and saw
[1:34:27] and all the people were amazed and said
[1:34:29] is not this the son of David they can't
[1:34:32] get past that car now that carnality
[1:34:34] that Humanity the woman at the well
[1:34:36] didn't either she said the same thing
[1:34:39] she was she was in and she was in the
[1:34:42] line of carnation Humanity that's all
[1:34:44] she was thinking about
[1:34:45] but when the Pharisees heard it they
[1:34:48] said this fellow this fellow does not
[1:34:50] cast out Devils but by Beelzebub the
[1:34:54] prince of devils calling him the devil
[1:34:58] and Jesus knew their thoughts and said
[1:35:00] unto them every Kingdom divided against
[1:35:02] itself is brought to Desolation and
[1:35:05] every city or house divided against
[1:35:07] itself shall not stand and that's where
[1:35:10] this country is as this country is about
[1:35:12] the fall friend that she's completely
[1:35:14] divided
[1:35:15] and if Satan not to mention she's under
[1:35:18] curse anyway and if Satan cast out Satan
[1:35:21] he is divided against himself how shall
[1:35:25] then his kingdom stand
[1:35:28] and if I by Beelzebub cast out Devils by
[1:35:31] hunting her children cast them out
[1:35:34] therefore they shall be your judges mine
[1:35:38] he's laying it out for him but if I cast
[1:35:41] out Devils by the spirit of God then the
[1:35:43] kingdom of God Has Come unto you just
[1:35:45] like he told the woman at the well amen
[1:35:48] he told them I am he
[1:35:51] they've been looking for messiah praying
[1:35:53] for messiah I am he
[1:35:55] she believed him they called him a devil
[1:36:00] if if I cast out Devils by the spirit of
[1:36:03] God then the kingdom of God is coming to
[1:36:05] you or or how else or or else how can
[1:36:09] one enter into a strong man's house and
[1:36:12] spoil his Goods except he first by the
[1:36:14] strong man and then he will spoil his
[1:36:17] house
[1:36:18] praise the lord it's all we do many
[1:36:20] times though we say Satan you have no
[1:36:22] right here Satan take your hands off
[1:36:25] Satan you've lost this battle Satan you
[1:36:29] must go you're bind that strong man amen
[1:36:32] then what comes healing
[1:36:34] or Deliverance whatever it is whatever
[1:36:36] the prayer is about you bind that strong
[1:36:38] man and then you take from praise the
[1:36:42] Lord he that is uh he that is not with
[1:36:45] me is against me and he that gathereth
[1:36:48] not with me scattereth abroad now they
[1:36:51] called him a devil the woman at the well
[1:36:53] called him Messiah
[1:36:56] they had no representation they had no
[1:36:59] identity
[1:37:00] there was nothing to identify them to
[1:37:03] him
[1:37:04] even though he did the same thing
[1:37:07] as he did with the woman at the well
[1:37:10] you see when that light strikes that
[1:37:13] those that receive it and believe it and
[1:37:15] those that reject it and call it
[1:37:17] something other than what it is a devil
[1:37:20] they have no representation the people
[1:37:23] of the world they do the exact same
[1:37:25] thing unfortunately seems like nowadays
[1:37:29] um the the representation is getting
[1:37:31] fewer and far between yes because almost
[1:37:35] anybody you talk to anymore they don't
[1:37:37] want to have anything to do with
[1:37:38] anything of God they might have known
[1:37:41] something they might have heard
[1:37:42] something their parents might have took
[1:37:43] them to school or to church excuse me or
[1:37:46] something but they but that's there's
[1:37:49] nothing there to hold
[1:37:51] there's no identification there's no
[1:37:53] Advocate there's no representation
[1:37:56] if there's no representation of what is
[1:37:58] left
[1:38:00] nothing there to identify with brother
[1:38:02] Adam said here they have nothing to
[1:38:05] represent them in glory
[1:38:07] no representation Amen to what did they
[1:38:10] have had nothing but Humanity carnality
[1:38:13] nothing but the Devil Himself
[1:38:16] look future home
[1:38:19] notice when Jesus came and manifested
[1:38:21] the word because the word discerned the
[1:38:24] thoughts that was in the heart as Hebrew
[1:38:26] 4 said it would
[1:38:27] the word was a discerner of the thoughts
[1:38:30] of the heart and he came as the son of
[1:38:33] man the prophet what happened this
[1:38:36] priest with only intellectual learning
[1:38:38] said he's a devil
[1:38:41] because that's what his denomination
[1:38:43] called it
[1:38:45] what did it do he had no representation
[1:38:49] so it blocked him out
[1:38:52] now listen friend
[1:38:54] if you only if the only thing you've got
[1:38:58] is just intellectual learning you get
[1:39:01] something different from that
[1:39:03] and you'll never be able to get it
[1:39:06] unless you've got
[1:39:07] Eternal representation that's the reason
[1:39:10] I believe they come from the east west
[1:39:13] north south they come to hear the word
[1:39:15] of God not a message to tickle their
[1:39:18] intake at their intellect their
[1:39:21] intelligence not something to make them
[1:39:23] feel good or to go out and say oh
[1:39:25] everything's great and Grand something
[1:39:27] that anchors down into their soul a word
[1:39:30] that might scour them out but help them
[1:39:34] understand I'm something greater than
[1:39:36] what this world says or what I even see
[1:39:38] even when I look in the mirror
[1:39:40] that's something God has made
[1:39:43] there's a desire to me I'm fill the pull
[1:39:45] I know that God is working and proving
[1:39:48] and showing in me that he's still Jesus
[1:39:51] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:39:52] forever
[1:39:54] one more scripture I want to read
[1:39:56] in John chapter 6.
[1:40:02] John chapter six I'll try to just read
[1:40:04] through this without as much to speak
[1:40:07] but again that's just me I don't know
[1:40:09] what the Lord has in store but listen uh
[1:40:12] John chapter 6
[1:40:17] uh let's just uh let's begin with verse
[1:40:20] 24. When the People therefore saw that
[1:40:23] Jesus was not there neither his
[1:40:25] disciples
[1:40:26] they also took shipping and came to
[1:40:28] Capernaum seeking for Jesus
[1:40:30] when they had found him on the other
[1:40:32] side of the sea they said unto him Rabbi
[1:40:34] when cometh thou hither
[1:40:37] Jesus answered them and said very verily
[1:40:40] I say unto you see ye seek me not
[1:40:42] because you saw the Miracles but because
[1:40:44] you did eat of the Loaves and
[1:40:46] Loaves and were filled
[1:40:49] labor not for the meat here we go with
[1:40:52] the meat again with the meat which
[1:40:54] perishes but for that meat which
[1:40:57] endureth unto everlasting life which the
[1:41:00] son of man shall give you for him hath
[1:41:03] God the Father sealed
[1:41:05] what does that mean again in your life
[1:41:08] doing the will of God
[1:41:11] amen there's substantive sustaining
[1:41:14] value in doing the will of God the
[1:41:18] spiritual life of your of your human
[1:41:21] being
[1:41:22] is sustained by doing the will of God
[1:41:25] Amen not the will of man not your own
[1:41:28] will praise the Lord you notice when
[1:41:30] when uh I may be getting ahead of myself
[1:41:33] for another sermon but when God chose
[1:41:36] Saul
[1:41:37] Saul was fine and did everything did
[1:41:40] what God told him to do but then he got
[1:41:42] pridefully with Spirit come on he got
[1:41:44] prideful and he started doing all his
[1:41:46] own will and what he wanted to do and
[1:41:48] God had to take him out
[1:41:50] amen
[1:41:52] then said they unto him what shall we do
[1:41:54] that mean that we might work the works
[1:41:57] of God
[1:41:58] Jesus answered and said unto them this
[1:42:00] is the work of God that ye believe on
[1:42:03] him whom he has sent you believe and you
[1:42:05] live and that word comes through you out
[1:42:07] of you and the will of God is manifested
[1:42:10] through you
[1:42:11] that's the work of God that's the mean
[1:42:14] of God
[1:42:15] they said therefore unto him what signs
[1:42:18] show us thou then that we may see and
[1:42:20] believe thee or what does thou work our
[1:42:23] fathers that eat Manna in the desert uh
[1:42:26] as it is written he gave them bread from
[1:42:28] Heaven to eat
[1:42:29] then Jesus said unto them verily verily
[1:42:32] I say unto you Moses gave you not that
[1:42:34] bread from heaven but my father giveth
[1:42:37] you the true bread from heaven for the
[1:42:39] bread of God is he which cometh down
[1:42:42] from heaven and giveth life into the
[1:42:45] world and he said unto him and they said
[1:42:47] unto him Lord Evermore give us this
[1:42:50] bread now they're doing the exact same
[1:42:52] thing the woman at the world did she
[1:42:53] said give me this water
[1:42:55] they're saying give me this bread
[1:42:57] but notice as the as the conversation
[1:43:00] continues on as brother Ram set that
[1:43:03] girl off to the side as Jesus began to
[1:43:06] ask the man of the woman about her
[1:43:07] husband
[1:43:08] they he began to
[1:43:10] get deeper into their soul to realize
[1:43:13] who they were or what they were
[1:43:16] they want the bread Jesus said unto them
[1:43:18] I am the bread of life that cometh uh
[1:43:22] that I am the bread of life he that
[1:43:24] cometh to me shall never hunger he said
[1:43:27] believeth on me shall never thirst but I
[1:43:30] said unto you that ye also have seen me
[1:43:32] and believe not all the all that the
[1:43:36] father giveth me shall come to me and in
[1:43:38] him that come and to him that cometh to
[1:43:40] me I will no wise cast out for I come
[1:43:44] down from heaven not to do my own will
[1:43:46] but the will of him that sent me and
[1:43:49] this is the Father's will which he has
[1:43:51] sent me that of all uh of all which he
[1:43:54] hath given me I shall lose nothing but
[1:43:56] shall raise it up again at the last day
[1:43:59] and this is the will of him that sent me
[1:44:01] that everyone seeth the son and
[1:44:04] believeth on him may have everlasting
[1:44:06] life and I will raise him up at the last
[1:44:08] day now when she said I see that your
[1:44:12] Messiah
[1:44:13] the Messiah is supposed to come and tell
[1:44:15] us these things I am he he says this to
[1:44:19] these people these religious group and
[1:44:22] they said the Jews then murmured at him
[1:44:24] because he said I am the bread which
[1:44:26] come down from heaven and they said is
[1:44:29] not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose
[1:44:31] father and mother we know how is it then
[1:44:34] that he said I come down from heaven
[1:44:37] notice the difference
[1:44:39] the representation of one versus the
[1:44:42] others
[1:44:44] they murdered among themselves
[1:44:47] Jesus answered and said unto them murmur
[1:44:50] not among yourselves no man could come
[1:44:52] to me except the father has sent which
[1:44:55] sent me draw him and I will raise him up
[1:44:57] at the last day what is that drawing
[1:44:58] that's that representation
[1:45:01] it is written in the prophets and they
[1:45:03] and they shall be all taught of God
[1:45:05] every man therefore that hath heard and
[1:45:07] hath learned of the father cometh unto
[1:45:09] me
[1:45:10] not that any man has seen the father
[1:45:12] save he which is of god he has seen the
[1:45:15] father verily verily I say unto you he
[1:45:17] that believeth on me hath everlasting
[1:45:19] life I am that bread of life
[1:45:23] your fathers didn't eat man of the
[1:45:25] Wilderness and are dead this is the
[1:45:27] bread which cometh down from heaven that
[1:45:29] a man may eat thereof and not die I am
[1:45:32] the living bread which come now from
[1:45:33] Heaven If any man eat of this bread he
[1:45:37] shall live forever and the bread that I
[1:45:39] will give is my flesh which I will give
[1:45:42] for the life of the world
[1:45:44] now the Jews therefore stroke among
[1:45:46] themselves saying how can this man give
[1:45:48] us his flesh to eat again
[1:45:50] they have not gotten the Revelation
[1:45:53] they're still simply carnal right
[1:45:56] thinking about flesh and blood
[1:45:58] Jesus said verily verily I say unto you
[1:46:00] except to eat the Flesh of the son of
[1:46:02] man or drink his blood you have no life
[1:46:04] In You whoso eateth My Flesh and
[1:46:06] drinketh my blood has eternal life and I
[1:46:08] will raise him up at the last day for my
[1:46:11] flesh is meet indeed and my blood is
[1:46:13] drinking deep ameneth My Flesh and
[1:46:15] drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I
[1:46:17] in him as the living father has sent me
[1:46:20] and I live by the father so he eateth
[1:46:22] meat even he shall live by me this is
[1:46:26] that bread which come down from heaven
[1:46:28] not as your fathers did eat mana and are
[1:46:30] dead he that eateth this bread shall
[1:46:33] live forever these things said he uh he
[1:46:37] in the synagogue as he told in Capernaum
[1:46:39] many therefore
[1:46:42] many therefore of his disciples when
[1:46:46] they had heard this said this is a hard
[1:46:48] say who can hear it
[1:46:51] when Jesus him knew it himself at his
[1:46:54] disciples murmured at it he said unto
[1:46:56] them does this offend you
[1:46:58] what and if you shall see the son of man
[1:47:00] Ascend up from where he was before
[1:47:02] if it it is the spirit that quickeneth
[1:47:05] the flesh profiteth nothing the words
[1:47:07] that I say unto you they are spirit and
[1:47:10] they are life they are mechanics and
[1:47:12] they are dynamics yes but there are some
[1:47:15] of you that believe not for Jesus knew
[1:47:18] from the beginning who they would
[1:47:19] believe not and who should betray him
[1:47:22] and he said therefore I said I unto you
[1:47:24] that no man can come unto me except he
[1:47:27] is given unto him of my father from that
[1:47:30] time many of his disciples went back and
[1:47:32] walked no more with him who can stand
[1:47:35] this who can take this seat saying who
[1:47:38] can hear this
[1:47:40] that's what you get a lot of times for
[1:47:42] the people of the world today yes oh I
[1:47:46] see it how can anybody live that message
[1:47:49] how can anybody believe that message how
[1:47:52] can anybody go about what that message
[1:47:53] that word that Prophet brought how can
[1:47:55] anybody live that the bride can live it
[1:47:58] right because she's become it it is her
[1:48:02] she's living who she is solely on the
[1:48:05] fact that she's become the word yeah
[1:48:07] yeah she can hear it because she
[1:48:09] believes it she's it
[1:48:11] amen they walked with now look what he
[1:48:14] turned back to his disciples to the
[1:48:16] twelve will you go away also also go
[1:48:19] away then Simon Peter answered in one of
[1:48:21] the greatest answers I've ever heard in
[1:48:22] the scripture
[1:48:24] Lord
[1:48:25] to whom shall we go
[1:48:27] praise God
[1:48:29] amen where else can we go friend it's
[1:48:33] like I said if I didn't know that full
[1:48:34] and feel that pulled and know God I what
[1:48:37] is life is it anymore with living
[1:48:39] anymore what's the point of even living
[1:48:41] there what's the point being here if
[1:48:44] he's gone away and left me I'm nothing
[1:48:46] Cannon Potter amen but Peter says well
[1:48:49] then where where could we go where else
[1:48:51] can we go thou Hast the words of eternal
[1:48:54] life and we believe that thou art and
[1:48:56] are sure that thou art the Christ the
[1:48:57] son of the Living God I can imagine at
[1:49:00] the same time Peter's probably looking
[1:49:01] over at his roses and saying what in the
[1:49:03] world is he talking about
[1:49:04] I don't know Peter you're the spokes and
[1:49:07] you should know I have no idea I haven't
[1:49:09] heard him talk like this before what is
[1:49:10] he even saying I don't even know what
[1:49:12] he's talking about how could this happen
[1:49:14] how could this be Peter do you believe
[1:49:18] I believe Lord you have the words of
[1:49:21] eternal life where else can we go
[1:49:26] I don't know what he's talking about
[1:49:28] but you know they came to the point that
[1:49:30] they
[1:49:31] did amen as they continue to walk with
[1:49:34] Christ even though they didn't
[1:49:35] understand it as they continued to walk
[1:49:37] with Christ God continued to reveal it
[1:49:39] to them they come the point that they
[1:49:41] did understand and God did show them and
[1:49:43] God did reveal to them he even told
[1:49:45] Peter one time when you were converted
[1:49:47] then you can strengthen the brothers
[1:49:48] because he knew it came to him and he
[1:49:52] knew by Revelation it wasn't about
[1:49:54] learning
[1:49:55] Jesus told him Flesh and Blood did not
[1:49:57] reveal this to you but my Father in
[1:49:58] Heaven amen had to be something beyond
[1:50:01] that it was God living through him that
[1:50:04] representation
[1:50:06] broken system no pumping
[1:50:10] the the well that comes up that that
[1:50:12] Artesian well its power is within itself
[1:50:15] it needs no priming yes sir its own life
[1:50:18] is in itself that's the way the seed of
[1:50:20] God is in a man's heart praise the Lord
[1:50:23] that's the way the seed of God is in a
[1:50:26] man's heart the life of God is within
[1:50:28] you the individual not the church it's
[1:50:31] in you you're the one that has the germ
[1:50:34] of life living in you amen it's that
[1:50:38] germ of life that's in you that found
[1:50:40] you that is who you really are
[1:50:43] that representation the representation
[1:50:46] of God that is in you you've always had
[1:50:49] it amen remember how could it have come
[1:50:52] at that specific time when when the
[1:50:55] Bible speaks brother Branham Talk of the
[1:50:58] representation that God had put in you
[1:51:00] and you come to that place like that
[1:51:02] Samaritan woman and recognize what it
[1:51:04] was yes religious people huge groups
[1:51:07] churches denominations schools teach
[1:51:10] people how to preach how to be a
[1:51:12] Christian but it's God in his word that
[1:51:15] reveals itself to you yes one moment you
[1:51:18] may not have a single clue in the next
[1:51:20] moment God drops it down all of a sudden
[1:51:22] it's quick into your heart and you thank
[1:51:24] God praise the lord well there it is
[1:51:26] amen I remember one time I won't go into
[1:51:30] it that I questioned and I and there's
[1:51:33] other other very pronounced
[1:51:37] uh Brothers in this message ministers
[1:51:39] pastors and
[1:51:42] I I hear certain things that were
[1:51:45] preaching on like I just it just doesn't
[1:51:48] that just doesn't I can't fit that
[1:51:51] I I just I tried Saints I really wanted
[1:51:54] to I looked up to these men yeah and I
[1:51:58] just
[1:51:59] but I just couldn't yeah
[1:52:01] yeah and then and then when God
[1:52:03] quickened something to me
[1:52:05] it was so contrary to so much of the
[1:52:07] things that I had been listening to but
[1:52:09] it matched the word yes and it matched
[1:52:12] the message not just a quote here or
[1:52:14] there but it matched it all the way
[1:52:16] through yeah it matched the scripture
[1:52:19] not just to not just a a scripture or
[1:52:21] two a verse or two but it matched all
[1:52:24] the way through
[1:52:25] and when it got to that place that a
[1:52:27] message said this has got to be it I
[1:52:30] didn't come up with this
[1:52:32] I I didn't finagle this or
[1:52:35] trying to learn this by some education
[1:52:37] there's just that time when God dropped
[1:52:40] it and that finalized it for me it
[1:52:43] didn't matter if it was contrary to what
[1:52:45] uh all the others saying or anybody else
[1:52:48] that's not it it's God individual to me
[1:52:52] it's God individual to you that is your
[1:52:56] representation in heaven that you in
[1:52:59] glory have to have a representative an
[1:53:02] advocate praise the Lord and it stands

[1:53:41] her life
