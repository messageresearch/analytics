Isaiah chapter 60 amen read a few couple of verses of scripture here in Isaiah beginning with the first verse Isaiah chap 60 verse 1 praise the Lord Jesus amen thank you Lord Jesus amen Grace was free

God in some way as we continue Lord to press this battle to move forward with what you've given us Lord in life knowing that you are The Giver of every good gift Lord God just bless each one we commit un to you we commit ourselves in every way father in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Isaiah chapter 60 uh let's read the first three verses arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness the the darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee the Gentiles shall come to thy light and Kings to the brightness of thy Rising amen amen you can be seated if you'd like amen praise the Lord an exclamation that uh um that Isaiah gave us there to understand that of course there'll be a day that there'll be Darkness upon the land there' be gross Darkness to people but the the Gentiles now think of this what Isaiah wrote back then because the Gentiles at this time was not a people amen they were not a godly people they were not a religious people they were not a people that trusted or believed in God they were heathens but yet is Isaiah come out of course through prophetic uh utterance uh saying how that the Gentiles would accept that light the Gentiles would receive that light amen and thank God for that light Lord because without light we'd all still be groping in darkness amen just like the world is groping in darkness just like so many of the people of the world are groping in Gross Darkness today but God has come and arose and shine his light upon our pathway now I want to go over to Ephesians chapter 2 read this verse of scripture uh beginning with verse one Ephesians chapter 2 we'll begin here also with verse one amen Ephesians 21 amen and you ha he quickened praise the Lord amen who were dead in trespasses and sins who were in darkness amen God has brought light God has brought life amen quickening is to bring alive God has made alive those of you who were dead in darkness and trespasses and sins wherein in time past time past thank God they past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh still worketh in the children of Disobedience those that are growing groping yet in Gross Darkness among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God praise the Lord God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us amen even when we were dead in sins had quickened us together with Christ notice that one time we were dead in sins yes praise the Lord our sins separated us from God remember in the beginning the Garden of Eden God said the day you the day you sin that's the day we separate amen that's the day the day you sin is the day you die that's the day we separate amen and that same sin had kept people amen as we're born in sin shaped iniquity come the world speaking lies kept being separated from God kept men separated from light amen dead in the Sin but thank God because of the liberty of Jesus Christ and the blood he shed and the work he did at Calvary we are not dead in sin anymore but we are dead to sinen sin now has no longer has a Hal on the bride of Christ sin no longer has a halt on the children of Jesus Christ sin no longer has a grip on you because you've been set free and liberated from sin amen you are dead to sin in other words sin is dead to us sin is dead because uh because we no longer sin amen the man who is born of God cannot sin because his God's life remaineth in him in him now that doesn't mean we don't as humans make mistakes absolutely amen but in our hearts there's no more sin praise the Lord sin has been divorced so we're not dead in sin anymore but we're dead to sin sin has no halt over us whatsoever anymore praise God at one time in Satan's pawn shop he had a grip over us he had claims over us that sin that we were bound to God liberated us and set us free by his blood so that now we can be now we can really know the fourth verse we can really know fourth verse in the power of the truth that God is rich in Mercy praise the Lord God is rich in Mercy for his great love amen wherein he loved us in all reason he went to Calvary raised us up sixth verse now and has raised us up together and made us sit in he together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of ourselves of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast it's not anything that we've done it's all that he did amen nothing that we said nothing that we could have done God Did It For Us amen we just accepted it we accepted his pardon amen we accepted his way we accepted his blood we accepted the price he paid for us at Calvary and then accepting it re when we accept we receive it when we receive it it becomes a part of us and now it is who we are yes it's not just a a thing a an incident that happened in history it is something that we now are a part of that is a part of us because we've received it for we are we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk walk in them praise the Lord once we were dead in sins God pulled us from the dark chaos of the world and made us to sit together with him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus friend we didn't deserve that none of what God has done for us we've deserved right what we deserved was hell what we deserved was the cross what we deserved was utter darkness and Chaos we deserve death we deserve separation from God that's what we as as Mortals as humans deserved but by his mercy God great in his Mercy amen shine his path Upon Our light or his light upon our pathway that light has separated us from the darkness the darkness that was groping over people the the darkness that people grope in today the darkness the gross darkness that covers over people and covers over their lives God's light has come and shine upon our pathway now everyone everyone has the desire has the ability to be able to come to that not everybody does God's will were that all would come to repentance but not all do unfortunately there's still people now working the children of Disobedience working in that Darkness as we deserve that Darkness amen his Mercy provided a way for us his Mercy paved away that we could walk down the paths of righteousness that he could shine his light upon us and show us his way amen look at this and God who is rich in Mercy January 65 brother ramam said he that is born of God doth not commit sin amen the worshipper once purged has no more conscience of sin no more desire of sin notice from the heart that's the the desire comes amen not fleshly amen but the spirit takes over the flesh amen the the the soul takes over the spirit which takes over the flesh so now the desires that you have are the desires of the Soul if your soul is of God your desire is for God right amen amen praise the Lord there's no more desire to sin the sin question is over you become a part of God in Christ Christ died to redeem you praise the Lord God rich in his Mercy yes gave his life that he might redeem us now just think of that think of what we would have think about just think of all that we would have been if it hadn't been for God but God in his Rich Mercy how he has redeemed us tonight this morning where would we be this morning if it had not been for God's Rich mercy upon us amen oh my think about that Saints how difficult sometimes how challenging it is to think about how sobering it is to think sometimes about where we might be if it had not been for the grace of God you look at people out in the world today and look at the condition of where they are and where what's going on you could think that could just as easily have been me if it had not been for the mercy of God if it had not been for the grace of God the acceptance of that price that he paid for us I would be one of those people I could be one of those that are sitting on the sidewalk today begging I could be be one of those people groping in darkness and rather be at a football game than in church I could be one of those people that would rather be uh doing something other than serving the lord in our lives I could be one of those people puffing on a cigarette or guzz down a whiskey or or gambling my life away I could be one of those people but God rich in his Mercy yes wherewith he loved me shed his blood for me the acceptance of that Christ where could we be today Saints where would we be without him we would be told toally lost we would be those groping in the darkness we would be those covered and and consumed by his gross Darkness God's Rich mercy upon us where would we be right now if it had not been for God's Rich mercy upon us once the world was so sinful that man had caused corruption to come upon the Earth until it grieved God so that he ever made man the whole head uh the whole body was a putri ified sore and God even grieved that he ever made a man so he said I would destroy men whom I have created he will destroy them because he was nothing but just because man was nothing but a bunch of corruption and the whole human race would have been wiped out at that time but God rich in his Mercy would not let the innocent perish with the guilty God and his great wisdom looked down through the animals of time and realized knowing god of course right that there would be those that would accept it there would be those that as he gave the utterance to Isaiah would that would receive it there would be those even to the Gentile at that time was unheard of would even be to the Gentile something that the Gentile would receive and accept and become a part of the light of God as light would shine it and as God saw that he recognized the people no doubt friend I will say he looked down and saw me right he looked down and saw you yes and realize that those people don't deserve to die because of the mistake of some others right I will make a way I will provide a way that they will be able to be redeemed back to me that they will be able to come back to the place that I saw them in my mind before the foundational world and God in his great wisdom chose as he could have wiped them all away would not let the innocent perish with the guilty he went away and made a provided way for the ones that that that wanted to come in Praise the Lord that wanted to come in oh think of it now we're going to get to something here in just a minute it makes it very striking we all know but it's true that wanted to do what was right that wanted to come in he made a way of Mercy for those who would desire Mercy my that's a striking statement when you think about it friend you think about Mercy that's out there and that people that spurn that Mercy yes they literally do not want that Mercy right that's just hard to Fathom today friend if there's any if there's any of the goodness of mercy of God grace of God in any capacity I want it every bit I can get I want as much Mercy from you as I can get much that's just from God Amen we all need that every one of us need that Mercy from God and to think that there's people out there that actually do not want it right they spurn it yes it's it's hard to Fathom that but there are there are people and factly truthfully the majority of people really in the world today they just they don't even want God's mercy it's there full and free for anyone that will partake but they just don't want it my is for those who desired Mercy amen praise the lord well you can't desire Mercy unless you recognize you need Mercy if you don't recognize you need Mercy why do you want Mercy amen and my wife sometimes she'll go to the grocery store and she'll call me she say look in the Frid see if we have any milk you know what if we got a whole gallon of milk between the two of us we probably won't even use it all but if there's a gallon of milk in there I tell her honey we got milk she didn't go buy three or four more gallons of milk we've got milk and people think the same way why would I need to ask for and want Mercy if I don't even know I need mercy and people don't know they don't know that they have to have they need for Spiritual preservation they need God's mercy they just don't they don't recognize they even need it right yeah they don't know they need it why would there be a desire for it there's not a deep calling to the Deep right amen as brother brandom said as the scripture says it's not a deep calling to the Deep amen he prepared an an arc other words he put some wings on his Eagles that they could fly above the judgment and not drown with the chickens well he's very colorful isn't he uh but made a way of an escape in the days of Noah this caused him to do that to provide that way because he's rich in Mercy cuz he was wiping the Earth off but again not to let the innocent perish with the guilty he provided away amen hundred 12 years Noah preached repent get on the ark repent it's going to flood repent get on the ark for 120 years he tried to tell them amen but again they didn't realize they needed it because they're telling Noah it it doesn't rain what do you mean rain it doesn't rain there's no such thing as rain it up till that day it never rained God watered the Earth from underneath right it didn't rain they didn't know what rain was you imagine a guy coming and saying it's going to rain and which is literally something that had never happened in the history of humanity yeah it's going to rain you think they' think he was crazy but if they knew the man in his character see that's the thing that gets me so many times at people that that lead the message you think about the character of person I've known a lot of people that have spent personal time with brother brandom and the testimonies I get from all those people of that man's character does not match up with why people say they leave the message a a a liar a manipulator I mean it it just doesn't make any sense right so you think there's something in there that say Hey this Noah I mean what he's saying is about as farfetched as I've ever heard but that's a good guy he's been right before he's of a good character he is a good moral man he is a godly man amen if someone could even look to that capacity and think about you know maybe we ought to listen to him but for 120 years he preached and nobody listened to him but his family amen and some of them very possibly reluctantly got on just because well that's Daddy I think we should do it amen because look what happened after the flood but his family everyone perished but his family so again but God Made A Way amen God God always makes a way that the innocent would not perish with the guilty amen amen but after he has a provided way for Fe for people then they refuse it now the reason they refuse it is because there's nothing there to receive it again there's no deep calling to the Deep there's nothing there to receive it there's nothing uh to receive it my mother used to say you can't get blood from a turnup amen my parents used to say that when I was growing up I remember that saying very well can't get blood from a turn why can't you get blood from a t because there's no blood in a turn right amen there's no blood in a turnament so if there's no form of life in there to receive it then it cannot be received again if there's no man in the lighthouse screaming out that there's uh to the ship that's coming that there's land here and you're going to wreck up if you try to come any further if there's no man there then what's it going to do it it the ship's going to wreck up because there's nothing there amen God well we make this statement a lot but God have mercy I know that's the topic of the message today but you think about what God have mercy what is it these people they just don't have anything in them to receive it they have no desire for it amen that's why that that desire gets filled with so many other things as a as a human with a Soul they have a capacity there to want to have something that would serve God to worship God to live for God but but with there but when there's no representation there all they can do is try to fill that with everything else that craving then goes to righteous living or uh loose living or uh cigarettes or alcohol or gambling or whatever it is that that goes to everything else and you see the world is is catering to the appetites of of the human in that way amen it used to be where we used to call when I was growing up we called Las Vegas Sin City right well you never hear that phrase anymore people don't say that at all anymore in fact the last time I was in Vegas on business which I hated going every year amen uh uh our business trip was in Las Vegas our convention was in Las Vegas the last time I was there I think it was the last time we stayed at the NGM and you could literally walk like like walking from here into the vestibule there with a bigger opening not just a door I mean it wasn't fully open there was walls short walls on either side but you could walk just freely right from the arcade where all the kids were playing arcade video games right into the gambling part they were doing everything possible just like Satan to bring it all and mesh it all together well it's all okay well now uh they got they got this I don't even know what they call it but uh the guy on our team does it where you can gamble on anything anywhere pretty much uh you can use your phone or online or something you can just gamble away whatever you you don't need a casino anymore right you just uh gambling well I think this person's going to win this fight or I think this team is going to win this game or something and they bet all the time he tells me he makes fun of me sometimes cuz I pay a little bit of money sometimes to get a upgrade to First class on my flights and boy does it make a huge difference but anyway he he makes fun of me for doing that I said you just gambled away a hundred bucks I only spent $50 for this seat what did you get for your 100 bucks oh it's the enjoyment the enjoyment of letting a hundred hard-earned dollars go out the window you just might as well put a match to it and and then make fun of me don't want to go and spend a little extra money for a good meal but boy they'll make sure and gole down the liquor that's $20 a a glass yeah you know what I'd rather I'd rather take the 20 bucks off of the off the drink and buy me a decent steak or or something worth anyway just different priorities it's my whole point is the priority there the desire that's within that is within is what is driving the person and that's what they feel that desire with that's what they feel all that place that's supposed to be for God they fill it with everything else and the whole world is working to make sure and satisfy that thirst to satisfy that desire to satisfy those Cravings they have in there for for the the things of the devil I mean that's just the bottom line that's it's just the things of the devil yes that's all it is anyway but you cannot again cannot get blood from a turnup because there's no blood in a turnup so if there is no form of life in there to receive it then how can it be received if there's no representation in there how can it be received how can again there ever even be a desire for it if there's nothing there to desire it yeah amen just think in the natural if there was nothing in a human being that if you didn't drink any water for a day two days week if you didn't drink I don't know can you even go without water for a week I don't I don't think you can actually but if you go on these if there's nothing in there if there's no control tower in there telling you beep beep beep beep you better drink some water you're going to die right amen if there's nothing in there person would just lay down and die from dehydration because there's nothing in there telling them you better drink or you're going to die fortunately for man God put that in every human being to say beep beep beep you better drink something or you're GNA die you better eat something or you're going to die God put that control tower in every human being but look if there's no representation in there for the spirit of God and for the spiritual part of the man then what there's nothing there to a you better uh you better make it right right right you better get things right in your life or you're going to die yeah and that death is way worse than the natural death right because that's separation from God yeah amen there separation from God friend we are what's the point uh if there was nothing that God could do for us if there was no way that God made a provision then what would what choice or hope would any of us have amen but God Made A Way God chose us God put in that our that his his own self that representation Amen to receive him let's go over to Romans chapter n amen God literally wants to do it for us more than we even want that's right amen amen that's just the truth of our human nature amen the soul craves for it because the soul knows it's going to die without it the human nature says Lord they there's a resistance there because it's the black dog and the white dog that's continually fight with each other now I know brother brandom said there's two dogs inside me like the Indian chief said but to me I've always saw the two dogs as the Flesh and the spirit Waring against each other or the godliness and the humanity Waring against each other that's kind of the way I've always took that story anyway but amen but the truth is we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God and we all need God's grace just like Ephesians told us where all of us in times past amen all of us were groping in dark darkness and lying and deceiving and uh heathens and Ty we all were amen but God who is rich in Mercy praise the Lord amen I'm so glad thank God for that Mercy Romans n amen Let's uh let's start with verse 14 now this is right after uh Paul talks about the God's U giving Grace to one as he says it is WR 13th verse says it written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated amen but now look 14th verse says but what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God now the the normal thinking human thinking that does sound unrighteous amen before now you say well Esau's life warranted such Jacob's life warranted such but the scripture says before either child was born so you can't let lay it on what they did in life because the Bible says before either child was born God loved Jacob and hated Esau yes so to the human mind natural thinking would say yes that is unrighteous that that that should not be done God's not a just God to think like that that's normal human thinking but you look and say is there unrighteousness with God God forbid amen amen How can there be unrighteousness with God see problem is humans our ways are not his ways our thoughts are not his thoughts we think of it as something that's unnatural but to God everything God does has purpose and reason and meaning everything there's nothing unrighteous everything is uh holy and righteous God forbid for he said to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion right now how does do that he doesn't judge it would say by our Deeds but he judges it based on who he knows you are based on who he knows we are and in our hearts and our desires to be for God he knows that he knows if our hearts and desire is not for God he knows if we're pretending he knows if we're putting on he knows if we're trying to do something that's uh uh to to would say pull the cover over others eyes he knows God knows he knows our our hearts amen thus I will have compassion on who I will have compassion 16th verse so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but God that showeth Mercy says not it it God's mercy upon us than have anything to do with your Deeds right amen has everything to do with God's unconditional love to you because he knows who you are praise the Lord a lot of times all we can see is the outside I mean I I I've I've said this before but I've known people that uh that we've gone to church with and that we've spent time and worship with and and all and and uh you know 40 years whatever it's been now I lose track of a serving the lord and U um living for him that you would think wow if if any if anybody is going to be there it's going to be that person if the it if the if the Pearly Gates will say uh open for anybody they're going to be for that person you ever done that that thought to yourself well that person's really going and and just really I mean to to to the point that um I I've actually I I hate to say it this way but I don't know who else to say it about so I have to say it about myself I've actually had people tell me that they felt like if I was still here the Rapture didn't take place and you ever everybody said tell you tell that amen if you're still here that's their uh uh way of knowing the Rapture has not taking place because you are going to go in the Rapture period amen I had a lady one time uh I think it's one time we were flying to uh the convention or whatever it was business back in Charlotte and her daughter had lukemia and they were going to Washington and we saw them at the airport strangely enough and she looked over at her husband when I sat down she looked over at her husband she said oh thank God good Christian lady you know for what she knew uh she looked at her husband oh thank God uh and her husband says what do you mean he said well Newton's on this plane she said if Newton's on this plane nothing's going to happen to it our flights are going to be great amen I mean that that's not an attribute a tribute to me that's a tribute to God Amen that that's to him to understand that it's him in our lives doing this so that other people can see Christ so that other people recognize there is a God Amen not just as so many of the churches today would see there's a God yeah there's there's a God 10 20 30 40,000 years ago there's a God yeah he's somewhere in the stratosphere somewhere we don't know exactly where he is some Stars some planets some something up there and that's what a lot of people believe you know brother ROM said said that back in that time in the 60s when they started shooting Rockets up up into space those astronauts would come back and people would ask him well did you see God up there said no we didn't see anything a lot of people quit believing God just because astronauts didn't see him out of their Rockets up there that's the way some people believe yeah amen but to bring a living risen God right here in flesh amen that makes God real that makes God uh present flesh amen same today as he was yesterday not a god of history but a god of right now it's not a god of it's not a man of him that willth or him that run God that shows Mercy for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth therefore hath he Mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he Harden and we know he did that with Pharaoh thou Willl say then unto me why do he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will nay but old man who art thou that repliest against God here we go now you say well that that's just unfair that's just unjust amen shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus hath not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another vessel of Dishonor praise the Lord amen it's God Amen it's up to God it's in God's hands who we to say he's unjust he's the one that created me he's the one who made me he's the one who would say that there is no God he is the one who made those that would scoff at God he's the one who made those that would look at this and say that is not a just God well he's the one who made you how can you tell him what to do he has power over the clay he's the Potter he says what comes and goes he says what he says what is right and wrong amen he knows what is in the heart of man praise the Lord what what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with such with much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had afor prepared unto Glory even us whom he hath called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles praise the Lord also of the Gentiles also of us those of us who had no life who had no hope we friends we derived from God's mercy amen we are here only because of the mercies of God we are in this building we are in this life we are in uh this flesh only because of the mercies of God we are only Servants of his children of his because of his Mercy that's the only way amen look at this in the token in Jeffersonville token I know there's about five of them four or five I lose track but this is the one in Jeffersonville he said the life that God has said the that the day you eat thereof that day you die then there had been a substitutionary life taken for the life of the believer now he said that and he meant it but God then took a substitutionary life for the life of the believer God in Mercy accepted a substitute for the life of the defiled person and that was us we were the defiled people yes amen God accepted a substitute his son Jesus Christ who was perfect and done no wrong died at Calvary shed his blood and provided that way so that we would be able to have a way yes amen we he did he did for we the defiled persons we were the defiled people when his child had defiled himself with sin of disbelieving the word then God rich in Mercy made a substitute and that was something that had to die in his place amen something had to die in our place yes I remember brother brandham uh uh talking about u a man that had come up to I think it was a man that had come up to him trying to remember the quote now and this man said that uh after after the service he come up to brother brandham and said brother brandham I used to have a lot of confidence in you till you said that you ate breakf uh you ate bacon and eggs for breakfast he said how could you eat such a thing he lost confidence in brother brandom just because you ate bacon eggs now obviously the person was a vegan or they have vegan at that time a vegetarian yeah so he said how could you uh uh uh eat something like that the bacon and the eggs how could you do that and brother Ram says well you alive or I'm paraphrasing well yes sir oh well you know that that you live on dead substance right only way you can live Human is on dead substance he said oh sir you know I just had some bread or wheat or lettuce or whatever it was he said well whatever you had had to die for you to live right whether it's the wheat the wheat had to die yes whether it's the the the the corn the corn had to die whether it's the lettuce the lettuce had to Die the radish the Cucumber the vegetables whatever it was it had to die for you to eat it to live yes we live off dead substance whether it's a pig or whether it's an ear a corn we all live on dead substance right amen now some people argue about the healthiness of it and that's that's a different argument for some people but that wasn't the argument this man gave right amen he tried to help the man understand you humans have to live on dead substance as a human spiritually friend the only way we can lie live is off a dead substance the only way that we can have a a spiritual life of life eternal is because someone gave their life for us that's the only way by the mercies of God that we can live Jesus Christ gave his life he showed shed his blood through his mercy so that we could have life amen he did it once he did it for all that blood was flowing free it is Flowing free today for who whosoever will amen God help us thank God he made that way but we live off of dead substance not just physically but spiritually yes we live off of dead substance no matter what it is only way we can live only way we can survive is off a dead substance only way we survive spiritually is off a dead substance yes amen God makes that way God made the substitute and accepted the substitute now Cain Cain thought that it took botney life amen didn't realize or didn't strike him as Revelation that it took blood which is what God used to bring Adam and Eve back into the presence of God again it had to be blood yes but Adam but Cain thought well that's just fine I just I'll bring in the best I got he did all the altar was perfect it was nice everything he got was all it was except would have been probably probably way more beautiful than than Abel's sacrifice Abel's sacrifice was an animal bleeding dying with blood splatter splattered all over the place but at C's beautiful uh garnished in flowers and and everything and the fruits the best the vegetables and everything that he had to offer to God but God rejected it why because there was no life of substitute in them there's no soul in botney life there's no excuse me there's no spirit in boty life amen but there had to be something D spiritually Bloodshed because the life is in the blood yes when the hemoglobin breaks there's life that comes out of that and in in the life of God come off and into the worshipper into the believer and that blood is what changed us and made us receive by his Mercy that truth that God has shed for us that that that that life that God has GI for us amen look now let's get back to uh Jehovah JY part two Lille Kentucky he said if a man know look now very uh we we understand this very striking if a man know he was naked you could talk to him and tell him you're naked oh my I am I better get some clothes on you could tell him something it's when he's naked and doesn't realize it that's the problem as we've said before if a man was naked if he knew he was naked you could talk to him but when but when you don't know that you're naked that's a miserable shape pitiful he brother Braham said now don't Scorn the people but have mercy have mercy right what if that was you in that condition and again but for the grace of God there go I right amen amen what if that was you in that condition what if the word wasn't revealed to you right my I I don't even like like to Fathom that or think about that what would you do what else would matter if your eyes was so blind you couldn't see it yeah that's a miserable sight and what is this Le deia age poor miserable blind wretched naked don't know it why they don't know it because they're blind that's right poor miserable richer than it's ever been probably we're probably living in a day as rich as humans have ever been monetarily but poor miserable blind wretched naked don't know it m so where does that put us God it's it puts us in a miserable condition now in in Matthew I got to read a couple more scriptures here I'm going to close in Matthew now chapter 5 Beatitudes one of my favorite scriptures in the entire Bible amen that's tough to say considering it's the Bible but one of my favorites God helped me to continue to try to my best to live up to this but Matthew 5:7 says blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy right one of my if I'm if I'm going to expect to receive Mercy from God then I'm going to have to be merciful to others amen that's the way of of receiving Mercy the merciful shall obtain mercy so if I want to receive Mercy from God I've got to be willing to give it what did Brother randam say don't scorn that person have mercy on you amen amen have mercy pray for that it may be some anything more than just praying for that person praying for Humanity in general but pray for that person if it's something that just strikes your heart like that you see so many nowadays uh that really you know they need God Amen like brother Dennis said in his prayer first and foremost of anything of anytime when we pray and uh pray for healings and things the number one thing that we want more than anything is that person's salvation amen that's number one first and foremost but if we want Mercy we've got to be willing to give Mercy yes amen we we not just be willing but to give Mercy I need to be merciful to you I need to be merciful to those that are around me if I want to because again if it weren't for the grace of God I'd be right there with them right amen thank God for his unmar grace favor Mercy amen Psalms chapter uh 103 as I said I have a couple more scriptures to read and I'm going to close here and one more quote that uh I got from uh years ago when I had this disagreement with a brother we'll get into that in just a minute about be too much longer though Psalms 103 verse 8 1038 the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous plenteous praise the Lord he is plenteous in Mercy he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger forever he had listened now this is Beautiful s this goes right over with us to First John 3 if you look at this he had not dealt with us after our sins praise the Lord thank God nor rewarded us Accord according to our iniquities again thank you Lord Jesus thank amen he hasn't rewarded US based on our iniquities he has not uh uh uh uh dealt with us according to our sins because of his grace because of his Mercy he has not dealt with us according to our sin or rewarded us according to our iniquities remember we said the other day amen the grace and mercy of God receiving that that we don't deserve and not receiving what we should be getting amen we should be going to hell we should be uh in sickness and dark chaos we should be uh we should have died on the cross we should be dead am but God in his Rich Mercy amen he doesn't reward us according to our iniquity praise the Lord what is Iniquity it's doing something you know you shouldn't do or not doing something you know you should do yes that's iniquity it's Lawless but God doesn't reward us according to that he looks at he doesn't look at that he looks through the blood yeah amen and your red Sin through the red blood of Christ is white as snow praise the Lord amen for as high is for for as the heaven is high above the Earth so great is his Mercy toward them that fear him as far as the East is from the West so far hath he removed our transgressions from us how do we get any further than that Saints amen praise the Lord Psalms 106 page over 1061 praise ye the Lord oh give thanks unto the Lord amen for he is good for his mercy endureth forever praise God thank the Lord for it where would we be without it amen God help us one quote I said again found this quote a long time ago there was uh well in in North Carolina but about the time I got to Florida there was a brother that started coming to our church not long after we moved there um and uh I won't go into all the details of things that he doctrinally believed but one of the things he believed but that it was Mercy was over Mercy was over of course the conversations we kept having got us to the point that he put Mercy ending before I was ever born I said well and we were on the phone I said brother you just put me out you just put me out of the kingdom of God CU what you're saying I wasn't even born then well well you know it's like this and then and you know by by the time he's done it's a 12T long chalk Bo that looks like some physicist uh Steven Hawking or somebody wrote up that nobody can understand but four people on the planet and I'm thinking what does any of that mean brother nothing but it has to go to all those degrees to try to explain or Reason away all the truths that are evident in God's word I found this I gave it to him I read it to him I I told it to him questions and answers 1964 August 1964 brotherr Brown some say Mercy is over and no one can be saved and that was his belief he believed that amen now I understand the point of the Lamb's Book of Life and all that but you don't get to the point that you say uh Mercy is over no one else can be saved that that's not that's not the point that brother Brandon was making when he preached like uh uh the breach message and uh and even in into the seals it wasn't that wasn't the point Christ Miss U uh the Feast of the trumpets god brother God didn't allow brother R preach these things to bring this point that there's Mercy's over and that's what some people sit there think well Mercy's over no one can be saved that's what this believe that's what this brother believed so I gave him this quote you want to hear Brother bram's answer I think you know brother bram's answer but uh now is that true question I'm glad I've got this one brother randam said we watch and pray we watch the prayer lines it seems some are still it seems some are still finding Mercy now that's the first question you got too he said is Mercy over brother bram's qu that's the question brother bram's answer don't never think that amen that that settles it for me yes and people say well well you know they they put two and two here and they do this and do all this math to make this come out to where it's like this and but brother random said I said well you know brother Ram said don't never think that so you know what I'm going to do I'm not going to think that way right amen amen even if I've told you before there will be a time where there will be on this Earth that nobody else is going to get in or out right just like brother brandom talked about with Noah's heart it was a time that they were still there but nobody could there would be nobody else could come in be on the door knocking trying to get in the five foolish virgins oh give to us no you got to go get for yourself by the time they did all that the bride left amen see but brother brandom said so there is that time but I'm I'm I'm not going to I'm not going to denote that time to say that time is right now I don't know only God knows but brother Brown said don't never think that so you know what I'm going to do I am not ever going to think like that amen amen yes praise the Lord because I want everyone that I I I I want everyone to make it right but if five more minutes five more hours five more days five more months five more years can bring one more soul in and Lord let it be yes amen one more Soul if it takes that Lord let it be whatever it is amen because he is rich in Mercy we should also be merciful to share that mercy and if say I'm tired of being here well that shouldn't be a reason to go home anyway being tired of here shouldn't be a reason to go home amen I'm sick of this place doesn't matter that shouldn't be a reason to want to leave here amen amen if God has us here for a purpose God wants us here there's a reason yes amen and if that extenuating of Mercy is helpful to someone else to come in then praise the Lord amen let them come in I want I as many and all that can yes amen praise the Lord God rich in his Mercy let's stand if we could amen God rich in his Mercy to me even when I might not do what I should or how I should or might make mistakes or come up short or get caught in trap or something God still that doesn't change God's mercy yes he doesn't reward based on iniquity yes amen he rewards based on whom he will he told us yes amen he told us whom he will have mercy he will have mercy yes amen so I I just believe that's that's his word that's the truth amen amen praise the Lord let's sing this course amen before we go today Mercy rewrote my life amen we sing it to start the service let's sing it to finish because I'm so thankful God's Mercy is what rewrote my life yes amen my life looked written when I was younger then it got Rewritten and then it got Rewritten and then God came into my life and every bit of that went out the window amen and it was Rewritten completely fully finally amen because I became his praise the Lord Mercy reot my [Music] life it was Mercy rote my life well I should have fallen my soul cast down but Mercy rote my life it
