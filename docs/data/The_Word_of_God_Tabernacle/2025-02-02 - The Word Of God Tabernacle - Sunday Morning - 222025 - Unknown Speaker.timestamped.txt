[41:35] bring to your
[41:37] attention uh one we had that sister
[41:40] Norma sent me from Sister Judy Arnold
[41:43] for those of you know Sister Judy uh she
[41:45] listens fairly regularly I think uh to
[41:48] the streaming she lives in Indiana so
[41:50] she doesn't attend of course in person
[41:53] but um um she does uh listen to our
[41:59] services and enjoy being a part of the
[42:01] congregation and uh anyway she sent
[42:04] sister Norma request it says could you
[42:06] please have the church pray for me going
[42:09] to have surgery February 4th and
[42:12] February 18th I have cataracts in both
[42:15] eyes in June of 2024 I was told I was in
[42:18] stage one but my eyes are worse now uh
[42:22] my right eye is covered over with the
[42:24] Cataract but you can barely see the
[42:26] blood vessel vessels underneath my left
[42:29] eye is the worst and they will operate
[42:32] on it February
[42:34] 18th uh the left eye is covered and kind
[42:38] of deep I've never had cataracts I'm not
[42:40] sure what that means but uh anyway I
[42:43] can't read my Bible without a magnifying
[42:45] glass I'm a little nervous about the
[42:47] surgeries and would really appreciate
[42:49] everyone's prayers thank you so very

[45:57] uh your name which we should at all
[45:59] times not only in service time but
[46:03] father the songs were to remind us the
[46:06] importance of letting you have
[46:09] preeminence control in our lives we must
[46:12] reflect you Lord as I was talking
[46:16] earlier with my brother and Lord he was
[46:19] saying about certain ones that he knows
[46:22] that they sure don't display um their
[46:25] lives as a chrisan Christians as they
[46:27] say they are and I told them Jesus
[46:31] taught us by their fruits you shall know
[46:34] them yes Lord and father when we see
[46:37] certain ones that are not living the
[46:39] life let us have the love and burden to
[46:42] pray for them to believe that they'll
[46:45] come in they'll repent and they'll make
[46:48] their lives right with you it's like
[46:51] brother green used to say God does not
[46:55] forgive uh uh excuse sin he forgives

[47:06] refuse we um neglect to line up with
[47:10] your word father deal with our hearts
[47:14] yes Lord Jesus there's such blindness in
[47:17] this world today that there's people
[47:21] that think there are Christians when
[47:23] their lives
[47:25] displays the cont
[47:27] their lies displ that they are are
[47:32] living a life of a religious spirit
[47:35] which is of the devil yes and father as
[47:39] the prophet taught us so clearly there's
[47:41] only two spirits in the world today
[47:45] there is God's spirit in his people and
[47:48] there's a religious spirit that's
[47:51] working amongst the so-called um uh
[47:55] denomination
[47:57] and and socalled people that want to
[48:00] identify themselves as you father and
[48:04] Lord deal with our hearts Lord we come

[48:29] word your word is life as we read it yes
[48:35] and Lord You're the author of that word
[48:38] and if we refuse to line up with your
[48:42] word as we read it that Spirit that's in

[1:01:47] Lord Ephesians 1 one let's start here
[1:01:50] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[1:01:53] will of God to the Saints which are at

[1:02:24] in Heavenly places
[1:02:26] in Christ according as he had chosen Us
[1:02:30] in him before the foundation of the
[1:02:33] world that we should be holy and Without
[1:02:36] Blame before him in love having
[1:02:39] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:02:43] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:02:46] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:02:48] will amen predestined he's predestinated
[1:02:52] us to this adoption amen he's
[1:02:54] predestinated us unto this maturity he's
[1:02:57] predestinated us into this family amen
[1:03:01] praise the Lord to the praise of the
[1:03:04] glory of his grace wherein he hath made
[1:03:06] us accepted in the Beloved in whom we
[1:03:10] have Redemption through his blood the
[1:03:12] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:03:14] riches of his grace wherein Heath
[1:03:17] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[1:03:20] Prudence having made known unto us the
[1:03:23] mystery of his will according to to his
[1:03:26] good pleasure which he had purposed in
[1:03:28] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:03:31] fullness of times he might gather
[1:03:34] together in one all things in Christ
[1:03:37] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:03:40] on earth even in Him Praise the Lord so
[1:03:43] we know it's to so we know that we've
[1:03:46] been adopted we were children of God
[1:03:49] adopted into this family to the good
[1:03:52] pleasure of his will amen amen and he
[1:03:55] has made sure that every fast and every
[1:03:57] part of our life is to be to glorify him
[1:04:01] everything that's done is to bring glory
[1:04:04] to the Lord Jesus in him all things in
[1:04:08] Him Praise the Lord 11th verse now in

[1:04:17] according to the purpose of him who
[1:04:19] worth all things after the counsel of
[1:04:22] his own will so when we learn about our

[1:04:29] predestination by which we were adopted
[1:04:32] amen remember up here we were
[1:04:35] predestinated unto this adoption so that

[1:04:45] gave us an inheritance amen an
[1:04:48] inheritance who gets an inheritance all
[1:04:51] who the father says gets the inheritance
[1:04:54] who does the father give inheritance to
[1:04:56] his children his family praise the Lord
[1:04:59] amen to the counsel and to the counsel
[1:05:03] of his own will praise the Lord not my
[1:05:06] will not anybody else but God's will
[1:05:09] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:05:12] glory who first trusted in Christ in
[1:05:15] whom in whom again let's read this over
[1:05:18] again 13th verse in whom he also
[1:05:21] trusted after that he heard the word of
[1:05:24] Truth The Gospel of your Sal ation in
[1:05:27] whom also after that ye believe you were
[1:05:30] sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise
[1:05:33] we've been sealed the Holy Spirit praise
[1:05:35] the lord we just was went through the
[1:05:38] the new birth holy spirit being born
[1:05:40] again that Holy Spirit is the earnest of
[1:05:45] our inheritance until the Redemption of
[1:05:48] the purchased possession the Redemption
[1:05:52] the full Redemption amen we read that
[1:05:55] last week we'll probably read it again
[1:05:56] here in a minute amen the the Redemption
[1:06:00] of our bodies the full Redemption is
[1:06:02] when God takes us home
[1:06:05] amen the until the until the Redemption
[1:06:08] so we received this Earnest of The
[1:06:10] Inheritance this down payment the
[1:06:12] earnest is the down payment we receed
[1:06:14] this Earnest of our inheritance until
[1:06:17] the Redemption of the purchased
[1:06:18] possession so the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:20] is just that it's a gift it's a gift
[1:06:23] given unto us until we receive that full
[1:06:26] adoption until we get to that place of
[1:06:29] full Redemption of the of the uh the
[1:06:33] possession of the purchased price that
[1:06:36] God bought with his own blood and that
[1:06:37] is US amen we are that purchased
[1:06:41] possession until the Redemption of the
[1:06:44] purchased possession unto the praise of
[1:06:46] his glory we are that purchased
[1:06:49] possession we are that one that God is
[1:06:52] working on as we continue to live the
[1:06:54] life of Christ on this Earth God is
[1:06:56] living through us to be the
[1:06:58] manifestation of Jesus Christ on Earth
[1:07:01] today now this Earnest is just a down
[1:07:03] payment yes amen remember the holy
[1:07:06] spirit is just a gift it's a brother
[1:07:10] random called it a temporal gift why
[1:07:12] would he say that because the need for
[1:07:15] having the Holy Ghost is here for us
[1:07:17] present amen when you reach into a place
[1:07:20] of perfection your body's perfect your
[1:07:23] life everything about when you receive a
[1:07:26] body change and we go into glory to be
[1:07:28] with the Lord then everything is perfect
[1:07:30] what's the need of having the Holy Ghost
[1:07:32] then right amen it's a temporal gift
[1:07:35] it's for us now yes praise the Lord that
[1:07:39] that that which is that Earnest it is
[1:07:42] the down payment it is the town payment
[1:07:45] that shows that we have
[1:07:48] full beneficial rights to the purchase
[1:07:53] possession that God has given us every e
[1:07:57] e every Redemptive benefit that is of
[1:08:00] God we now possess because of the
[1:08:03] earnest the earnest is the down payment
[1:08:05] if you put earnest money on a house you
[1:08:08] sign a contract you put earnest money
[1:08:10] down that to says that you promise
[1:08:12] you're going to buy this house in good
[1:08:14] faith when you put that earnest money
[1:08:16] down uh and you sign a contract based on
[1:08:19] the earnest money you might not have
[1:08:21] made one single payment to a bank or to
[1:08:23] a mortgage company at all but you still
[1:08:26] get the keys to that place because you
[1:08:28] put earnest money and signed the
[1:08:30] contract that says I'm going to fulfill
[1:08:33] the promise that I made amen and who
[1:08:36] better to fulfill the promises that he
[1:08:38] made than God Almighty amen amen so we
[1:08:42] we we make that earnest money we make
[1:08:44] that down payment to say I promise that
[1:08:46] I'm going to pay and what they do is you
[1:08:49] write you put your name down you sign
[1:08:51] your name and they give you the keys and
[1:08:53] you walk in the door of the house amen
[1:08:56] the bank the mortgage company nor the
[1:08:59] previous owner cannot tell you which
[1:09:02] rooms you can go in and not go in they
[1:09:05] cannot tell you you can't walk into your
[1:09:07] backyard they cannot tell you you can't
[1:09:09] build a barbecue they cannot tell you
[1:09:12] you can't put up a swing for the kids
[1:09:14] they cannot dictate to you what color
[1:09:16] the walls are going to be because it's
[1:09:18] your house right it belongs to you every
[1:09:22] bit of that house is based on the fact
[1:09:25] that you put down an earnest money that
[1:09:27] just showed that there was more to come
[1:09:31] amen praise the Lord because the more to
[1:09:34] come is
[1:09:35] you possessing the home living in it and
[1:09:39] there's nobody can tell you what you can
[1:09:40] and can't do with it it belongs to you
[1:09:43] amen now there are laws that tell you
[1:09:45] you can't purposely burn it down to get
[1:09:49] insurance money or something there are
[1:09:50] laws against that but nobody can tell
[1:09:52] you what color you can paint the walls
[1:09:55] right they can't tell you what to do
[1:09:56] with the roof the floor they can't tell
[1:09:58] you whether you have carpet or hardwood
[1:09:59] floors they can't tell you that they
[1:10:01] can't tell you whether to cut the grass
[1:10:02] in the back they can't tell they can't
[1:10:04] tell you what to do with your house
[1:10:06] because it's your house it belongs to
[1:10:08] you why because you put down the earnest
[1:10:11] money and you promised that you're going
[1:10:14] to fulfill the word of the contract amen
[1:10:19] again God gave us contract and he's as
[1:10:23] good as his word amen we're still the
[1:10:25] earnest of the down payment amen but we
[1:10:28] recognize that just because we have a
[1:10:31] gift that gift and that Earnest is just
[1:10:33] telling us that there's more in store
[1:10:35] for usen amen but while we're here we
[1:10:40] are beneficiaries of every Redemptive
[1:10:43] promise that comes with the Holy Ghost
[1:10:46] praise the Lord that Earnest that seal
[1:10:50] we we have the benefit to every bit of
[1:10:53] it look what brother brandom said here
[1:10:56] he said uh in
[1:10:58] uh let me see makes it uh Revelation
[1:11:03] chapter five number one now notice as we
[1:11:07] go on now we notice it's finished praise
[1:11:10] the lord we we we know that we are we
[1:11:13] are
[1:11:15] predestinated with the
[1:11:17] lamb praise the lord we are
[1:11:21] predestinated with the lamb that word we
[1:11:24] just read tells us
[1:11:26] that the holy spirit is our seal the
[1:11:30] earnest means that is the down payment
[1:11:33] but the earnest means that there is more
[1:11:36] Is Yet To Come praise God so we we've
[1:11:41] been promised and we've been given with
[1:11:43] this Earnest to recognize there's more
[1:11:46] than just this life ahead for us there's
[1:11:48] more than just this world there's more
[1:11:50] than just this uh uh waking up and going
[1:11:53] to bed and the the living in this flesh
[1:11:56] and living in this life there's more to
[1:11:58] this amen and that's a lot of times what
[1:12:01] a lot of people lose vision on a lot of
[1:12:04] people of the world of course don't have
[1:12:05] that Vision but as a Christian we can't
[1:12:08] lose vision to recognize that there's
[1:12:11] more to it than just what we're doing
[1:12:13] here right amen we are working unto
[1:12:17] something we are working until until we
[1:12:19] get to that place where our bodies reach
[1:12:22] that body change whether we go by the
[1:12:24] way of the grave
[1:12:25] whether our body changes here when we're
[1:12:27] drawing breath whichever way amen that
[1:12:31] promise promises us that there's more to
[1:12:33] come there's more to this than just what
[1:12:36] we see right here more than our lives
[1:12:38] can see taste F smell here more than our
[1:12:41] imagination con reason uh affection
[1:12:43] memory more than anything that our
[1:12:45] bodies Our Spirits can contact or or uh
[1:12:49] uh be privy to on this Earth there's
[1:12:51] more to come which is that great
[1:12:53] eternity that we're looking for
[1:12:55] that great place that great state of
[1:12:58] perfection amen now I know Jesus said be
[1:13:01] ye therefore perfect even as Our Father
[1:13:04] which is in heaven is perfect but that
[1:13:06] just follows along with uh as I've said
[1:13:09] many times of of
[1:13:11] adoption reaching that place of full age
[1:13:15] of full maturity in the Lord just like
[1:13:18] Jesus did amen people say well that
[1:13:21] adoption doesn't come until your rapture
[1:13:23] well then
[1:13:25] I guess Jesus was raptured at the end of
[1:13:28] Matthew
[1:13:29] 17 cuz he was adopted in Matthew 17
[1:13:33] right and Jesus said this is my beloved
[1:13:36] Son hear ye him yes he is the one I am
[1:13:40] pleased to dwell in he is the one that
[1:13:42] you are to hear he is my son now he is
[1:13:45] standing in my stead you listen to him
[1:13:48] that's the adoption well he didn't go he
[1:13:51] didn't go up he didn't die right after
[1:13:53] that or go into heaven right after he
[1:13:55] lived his life after that what as an
[1:13:57] adopted son of God yes amen that's
[1:14:00] exactly the way we are to live our lives
[1:14:03] as God has adopted us or placed Us in
[1:14:06] that position and we've reached a state
[1:14:08] of maturity a mature Christian in the
[1:14:10] Lord when we do that then God uses us to
[1:14:14] live through us and our lives and then
[1:14:17] what it becomes it becomes not me but it
[1:14:19] becomes him it's him living now not me
[1:14:22] amen when my children were born they did
[1:14:25] what we told them they lived their lives
[1:14:27] based on what how me and my wife raised
[1:14:29] them and what we told them to do if we
[1:14:32] told them to go to church they went to
[1:14:34] church now by the grace of God I'm so
[1:14:37] thankful I've never had any problem with
[1:14:38] our children going to church uh uh it it
[1:14:42] I've said this before on Sunday morning
[1:14:44] it never was uh uh you know should we go
[1:14:47] to church today or we going to church
[1:14:48] today no we all showed up in the living
[1:14:50] room dressed and ready to go cuz it was
[1:14:52] part of life I'm thankful by the gra of
[1:14:55] God we never had that problem but they
[1:14:56] did what we told them to do uh even if
[1:14:59] they didn't want to even if they didn't
[1:15:01] like it even if it was corrective or or
[1:15:05] a spanking or whatever that they might
[1:15:08] not have wanted to but they did what we
[1:15:09] told them to do but when they grew up
[1:15:11] and became mature and grown up then that
[1:15:14] was their lives to live amen they lived
[1:15:18] their lives based on uh uh uh what they
[1:15:21] know that they had learned that we had
[1:15:24] taught them
[1:15:25] and by the grace of God what God has
[1:15:27] shown them and now they have to go not
[1:15:30] by our God not by our Salvation not by
[1:15:34] our Holy Ghost but by their own
[1:15:36] salvation but by their own Holy Ghost by
[1:15:38] by their own God living in them now they
[1:15:41] walked their lives based on that not
[1:15:43] what we tell them that's right praise
[1:15:45] the Lord why because they' come to the
[1:15:48] they came to the place of maturity they
[1:15:50] came to the place of being grown-ups
[1:15:53] amen of living their lives based in
[1:15:55] condition amen God shows us that that's
[1:16:00] uh that through
[1:16:01] us he he wants his life to be manifested
[1:16:06] through us he wants his life to be lived
[1:16:08] still here on Earth that's why he gave
[1:16:10] his life that's why he died at Calvary
[1:16:12] amen that's why he came back again yeah
[1:16:15] so he would live through US amen so that
[1:16:18] we would be his representativ so that we

[1:22:03] be I I I almost try to consider myself
[1:22:08] here um as
[1:22:11] nothing uh
[1:22:13] just just an example of Christ on Earth
[1:22:17] because my our real life is beyond this

[1:22:47] life is beyond this place yes my real
[1:22:50] life is after this life is over praise

[1:23:01] live it up whatever you want to the Hill
[1:23:03] People say um I I just I I just the the
[1:23:08] you know when brother random said the

[1:23:12] think we understood to the magnitude
[1:23:14] that it really has yeah to the magnitude
[1:23:17] that it's done to people that that just
[1:23:21] don't grasp what it is to live in this
[1:23:25] life yes of course as a Christian as a a
[1:23:27] holy ghost filed believer we understand
[1:23:30] we know what God does doing for us we
[1:23:33] know what it means to be here in this
[1:23:34] life but people just they just don't
[1:23:38] understand uh you
[1:23:41] know I I've heard recently probably
[1:23:44] seems like more so than other times uh a
[1:23:47] woman becoming a mother and having
[1:23:49] children but then but then she says well
[1:23:52] she wants a life there is no no greater
[1:23:55] life than to be there for your children
[1:23:58] right there is no greater life that is
[1:24:00] your life you see but but I want I want
[1:24:03] I want more I wantan to I I want more in
[1:24:05] life you know

[1:24:19] God that's the best you can do there's
[1:24:22] no greater thing on this planet
[1:24:24] in my opinion amen maybe I should save
[1:24:27] that for mother's day but anyway that's
[1:24:29] the truth praise the Lord people they I
[1:24:33] I I want more well just live for God the

[1:24:39] your life to the Lord Jesus the world
[1:24:41] come amen amen this is just the earnest
[1:24:44] praise the Lord let's go over to let's
[1:24:46] read again in Romans chapter
[1:24:51] 8 amen
[1:24:54] recognized as we got this this Romans 8
[1:24:56] I'm going to start with verse 14 this
[1:24:58] time but we recognize that uh uh we
[1:25:01] talked about the justification
[1:25:03] sanctification justification under uh
[1:25:06] Luther sanctification under Wesley uh
[1:25:09] the Holy Ghost brought in the ushering
[1:25:11] in the the restoration of the gifts for
[1:25:13] the prophet uh brother William brandham
[1:25:16] know the Holy Ghost is here uh the
[1:25:19] earnest in bringing a placement
[1:25:23] remember that we talked about the the
[1:25:26] the children of Israel coming out of
[1:25:28] Egypt going to cross uh the sea uh into
[1:25:32] the promised land and God gave them that
[1:25:35] land but then as God gave it to them he
[1:25:37] placed them in that land where they were
[1:25:39] supposed to be they come to the place
[1:25:41] that they had reached the culmination of
[1:25:44] the promise that God had give them but
[1:25:46] then it was time to occupy it was time
[1:25:49] to live it was time to be who God had
[1:25:52] ordained them to be praise the Lord
[1:25:55] now uh Romans chapter
[1:25:57] 8 uh let's begin with verse
[1:26:00] 14 Romans
[1:26:05] 8:14 for as many as are led by the
[1:26:09] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:26:12] so what that tells me is you're not uh
[1:26:16] you're not a son of God you're not going
[1:26:18] to be led by the spirit of God right
[1:26:21] whether before or after you're born
[1:26:24] again you're not a son of God you're not
[1:26:27] a daughter of God if you're not led by
[1:26:29] the spirit of God how many things in our
[1:26:31] lives that even before we gave our heart
[1:26:33] to the Lord you might can look back and
[1:26:36] say that was the Lord in my life right
[1:26:39] that was God's leading amen I gave you a
[1:26:42] little personal story I guess last week
[1:26:44] of me personally but you might can look
[1:26:47] back and say this was the Lord leading
[1:26:49] me and and and look back and and
[1:26:52] recognize now that was God in your
[1:26:55] life even before you gave your heart to
[1:26:58] him even before you were born again even
[1:27:00] before you feel with the spirit of God
[1:27:03] it was the spirit of God that was
[1:27:04] leading you those that are led by the
[1:27:07] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:27:10] look the leading doesn't just happen
[1:27:13] after you're born again the leading of
[1:27:15] God is your whole life because if you
[1:27:18] were a part of God then you've always
[1:27:20] been a part of God Amen if God looks
[1:27:23] over you now he's always looked over you
[1:27:26] I didn't look over my children just when
[1:27:28] they got old enough to talk just when
[1:27:30] they got old enough to drive or just
[1:27:31] after they left the house I looked over
[1:27:34] them when they uh uh when they were born
[1:27:36] I even spoke to them before they were
[1:27:39] born amen and that's in human realm but
[1:27:42] what about God when God looks in them in
[1:27:45] the spirit realm and you're you were his
[1:27:48] from before the foundation of the world
[1:27:50] not just when you say that you I
[1:27:52] received the Lord You're always is he's
[1:27:55] always looked over you led by the spirit
[1:27:58] of God they're the sons of God for ye
[1:28:01] have not received the spirit of bondage
[1:28:03] again to fear the spirit of look what it
[1:28:06] says the spirit of bondage
[1:28:10] again amen what does that tell you tells
[1:28:13] you you were in bondage to start with
[1:28:15] right remember born in sin shaped
[1:28:18] iniquity from the world speaking lies in
[1:28:19] bondage you were in bondage but we
[1:28:22] haven't received the spirit Fe little s
[1:28:25] AB bondage
[1:28:26] again to
[1:28:28] fear praise the Lord like brother Dennis
[1:28:31] said in his prayer we don't we we don't
[1:28:33] fear is not a part of our vocabulary
[1:28:36] fear is not a part of our life why
[1:28:37] because we are Christians we have God in
[1:28:39] our Liv amen fear is not a part of it
[1:28:44] love Yeah amen we don't fear but we have
[1:28:48] a Love A sound mind uh so we're not to
[1:28:52] be bondage not to be bound
[1:28:54] again to fear but you have received the
[1:28:58] spirit big S capital S of adoption
[1:29:03] whereby we cry Abby father you come to
[1:29:07] the realization you've grown up to the
[1:29:09] place father father amen that's a term
[1:29:13] that's a term of endearment amen not
[1:29:17] just to say father but father fathers my
[1:29:19] Lord my God my father father father amen
[1:29:24] it's a term of endearment that claims
[1:29:27] and and reaches out by acknowledgment
[1:29:31] that he's your father that God is your
[1:29:33] father amen the spirit
[1:29:37] itself and that's through adoption amen
[1:29:40] you reach that place of adoption praise
[1:29:42] the Lord the spirit of adoption the
[1:29:46] spirit itself the SC capital is sp uh
[1:29:49] itself Bears witness with our spirit our
[1:29:52] human spirit that we are are the
[1:29:55] children of God that Spirit God's spirit
[1:29:59] Holy Spirit witness to us human spirit
[1:30:02] that we are the children of God Amen we
[1:30:05] know we're the children of God there's
[1:30:06] nobody can talk you out of the
[1:30:08] realization that you are a child of God
[1:30:11] Amen
[1:30:12] nobody and if children then heirs Heirs
[1:30:17] of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be
[1:30:21] that we suffer with him that we may be
[1:30:24] also glorified together for I reckon
[1:30:28] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:30:31] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:30:33] glory which shall be revealed in us for
[1:30:36] the
[1:30:37] earnest expectation there we go again
[1:30:40] with that word amen the earnest
[1:30:43] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:30:47] the manifestation of the sons of God we
[1:30:50] talked about that a little bit last week
[1:30:52] the the of the creature the expectation
[1:30:55] of the creature creation amen of
[1:30:59] creation waited for the manifestation of
[1:31:02] the sons of God why would all of
[1:31:04] creation be longing for and waiting for
[1:31:07] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:31:11] because even creation that fell in the
[1:31:14] Garden of Eden at the uh when When sin
[1:31:16] and in
[1:31:18] realize human life body life that
[1:31:21] worships God Amen so they boty life

[1:31:29] scripture when the rain falls on the
[1:31:32] just and the
[1:31:33] unjust when it falls on the just what
[1:31:36] does it do it lifts its hands and

[1:31:41] it's it's it's uh maybe uh not coming to
[1:31:44] maturity but maybe been in a drought
[1:31:47] when the rain comes it raises its head
[1:31:49] up amen God created all of creation to
[1:31:52] worship Him amen the moon stars galaxies
[1:31:56] that all of it is in place to worship
[1:31:59] God the whole point of every every bit
[1:32:02] of it is to worship God to give glory to
[1:32:04] the Lord Jesus to give glory to God Amen
[1:32:07] that creature waited because it knows

[1:37:39] earnest that there's more ahead we
[1:37:43] realize that God's got more in store for
[1:37:45] us than just what this life has to offer

[1:37:50] we're looking for God to take us home
[1:37:52] amen praise the Lord let's go over to
[1:37:54] the scripture uh first John I'm gonna
[1:37:58] read a couple of scriptures here and try
[1:38:00] to background if you will for the next
[1:38:02] few minutes uh before I
[1:38:05] close the next
[1:38:09] part uh grow in
[1:38:11] Grace amen adoption part three grow in
[1:38:15] Grace amen is what we want to talk about
[1:38:17] but first John chapter 3 let's start
[1:38:20] here first John chapter 3 we'll just
[1:38:23] read the first two
[1:38:25] verses of First
[1:38:28] John amen did I mention that correctly
[1:38:31] first John I tell everybody okay
[1:38:34] sometimes I get in my uh I I I get where
[1:38:38] I feel like I'm trying to rush things
[1:38:40] and I say things in a wrong way and I
[1:38:44] guess St John in first John sometimes is
[1:38:46] he get uh confused first John uh chapter
[1:38:51] 3 verse one behold what manner of love
[1:38:55] the father hath bestowed upon us that we
[1:38:58] should be called the sons of God Amen
[1:39:03] that is the epitome of it all the love
[1:39:06] of God the love of the Father the love
[1:39:09] of God has bestowed upon us that we
[1:39:12] could be called the sons of God we could
[1:39:15] be called children of God Amen that's by
[1:39:18] his love praise the
[1:39:21] Lord therefore the world World knoweth
[1:39:24] us not because it knew him not beloved
[1:39:27] now praise the Lord now are we the sons
[1:39:31] of God the children of God and it does
[1:39:35] not yet appear what we shall be but we
[1:39:39] know that when he shall appear we shall
[1:39:42] be like him for we shall see him as he
[1:39:45] is praise the Lorden but we know that
[1:39:50] where God is moving and living in our
[1:39:52] lives
[1:39:53] where he's moving us from obviously but
[1:39:56] where he's taking us
[1:39:58] to
[1:40:00] amen what it takes to get to the place
[1:40:03] where God is moving us to amen brought
[1:40:07] us from yes but where we're going no
[1:40:10] where we're at now yeah but where where
[1:40:12] are we going
[1:40:13] to amen brings us to that place
[1:40:17] where we reach full adoption we reach
[1:40:22] maturity we reach reach that place of
[1:40:24] perfection that Jesus was talking about
[1:40:27] we reach that place it's not uh it's not
[1:40:32] far off in the stratosphere somewhere
[1:40:34] it's just a part of our lives right it's
[1:40:36] like so many times I've said before we
[1:40:40] just live our
[1:40:42] lives live a good humble simple
[1:40:45] Christian Life yes as you walk in the
[1:40:47] Lord amen and as you're LED of God and
[1:40:50] as you follow in his footsteps as he
[1:40:53] leads you God will will bring everything
[1:40:57] that is necessary in your life to bring
[1:40:59] you to the place that you need to be in
[1:41:01] him amen amen regardless of whether it's
[1:41:06] some what people would consider some
[1:41:09] great big position or just a humble
[1:41:15] janitor
[1:41:16] or someone that just is part of the
[1:41:20] church right supports the church and is
[1:41:22] there
[1:41:23] does their part for it it it it doesn't
[1:41:26] matter
[1:41:28] amen the janitor is just as important as
[1:41:32] the pastor right amen he's just well
[1:41:35] let's just say he's just as much a part
[1:41:37] of the
[1:41:38] church amen in the sunship of Christ the
[1:41:42] janitor the pastor doesn't mean any more
[1:41:45] than the janitor does right and to be
[1:41:49] honest as the one who basically is
[1:41:52] janitor and pastor
[1:41:54] uh I'm fine that that's that's the way
[1:41:57] it should be
[1:41:59] amen killing our humil our pride to
[1:42:03] bring in humility to recognize I'm not
[1:42:07] any more important than any of us no
[1:42:10] matter to I guess as it said from the
[1:42:13] least to the
[1:42:16] greatest doesn't matter we're all a part
[1:42:19] of that body amen and the pastor
[1:42:23] May Proclaim anyway to be way up here
[1:42:26] and everybody else is way down
[1:42:29] there not true that's right amen that is
[1:42:32] not just a fallacy unfortunately uh it
[1:42:36] seems sometimes that ministers kind of
[1:42:38] promote that but that's not true that's
[1:42:41] right never has been will not be in the
[1:42:43] sunship of Jesus Christ there's none any
[1:42:46] more important than the other we're all
[1:42:48] a part of the same body I'm more
[1:42:51] revelated okay well that's nice good how
[1:42:55] close do you live to Jesus Christ how
[1:42:57] close is your relationship with him amen
[1:43:00] amen I can quote the scripture yeah but
[1:43:03] how much are you living the life of God
[1:43:06] how much do people see Jesus in that's
[1:43:08] what matters amen it's about
[1:43:11] relationship yes amen it's about
[1:43:14] relationship and God wants us to be like
[1:43:16] him that's why as we're born amen and
[1:43:21] are unto this adoption we grow we grow
[1:43:24] in the Lord we have to grow according to
[1:43:27] just as we did physically in our
[1:43:29] Humanity we have to grow spiritually yes
[1:43:32] and we all do grow amen and somebody and
[1:43:35] the pastor may think that he's this
[1:43:37] great revelated person and he's mature
[1:43:41] and adopted and manifesting this that
[1:43:44] and the other but
[1:43:46] until the least get to that place none
[1:43:50] of us are going
[1:43:51] anywhere amen amen cuz we're all a body
[1:43:56] amen we're all of the same part of the
[1:43:57] same body when I walk out that door I
[1:44:00] don't leave my toes sitting
[1:44:02] here I don't leave my finger sitting
[1:44:05] here it all goes with me because it's
[1:44:08] one body when we all go we all go
[1:44:11] together CU it's one body I don't care
[1:44:15] if you're the bottom skin or the
[1:44:16] smallest toe it's going with the body
[1:44:20] right and it all has to go together I
[1:44:21] don't care if the eyeball the the brain
[1:44:24] the brain's ready to go what about
[1:44:26] doesn't matter
[1:44:29] amen the whole body goes at the same
[1:44:32] time where the body goes that's where
[1:44:33] the whole body goes amen praise the Lord
[1:44:37] now second
[1:44:39] Peter let me read
[1:44:43] this we'll close here in just a minute
[1:44:45] because I won't be able to get into this
[1:44:47] but I can read this
[1:44:49] scripture second Peter uh chapter 3
[1:44:54] second Peter 3 verse1
[1:44:57] 17 2 Peter
[1:45:01] 3:17 ye therefore beloved seeing ye know
[1:45:05] these things before beware lest ye also
[1:45:09] being led away with the error of the
[1:45:11] wicked fall from your own
[1:45:15] steadfastness wow you mean someone that
[1:45:18] had steadfastness can
[1:45:21] fall sure looks like that scripture yes
[1:45:24] and this is a warning to keep people who
[1:45:26] are in their steadfastness from falling
[1:45:29] from their
[1:45:30] steadfastness to grow in Grace says but
[1:45:34] grow in Grace so but grow in Grace and
[1:45:38] in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior
[1:45:40] Jesus Christ to him be glory both now
[1:45:43] and forever am a amen grow in Grace we
[1:45:48] talk a lot about the grace of God how
[1:45:50] important the grace of God in our is in
[1:45:53] our lives but we also recognize that
[1:45:56] with God's grace comes a knowledge of
[1:45:58] God Amen so when it says to grow in
[1:46:02] Grace and in the knowledge it doesn't
[1:46:05] mean a worldly knowledge it doesn't mean
[1:46:06] a head knowledge it means a revelation
[1:46:09] knowledge if you will uh now a a as you
[1:46:12] would see definitions written in the
[1:46:14] scripture it's going to give you a
[1:46:16] definition of worldly human brain
[1:46:18] knowledge but we know by truth in
[1:46:22] Revelation of the word for for our day
[1:46:24] that it doesn't mean that because head
[1:46:26] knowledge just gets you further and
[1:46:28] further away from God but revelation of
[1:46:31] God and and God revealing himself to you
[1:46:34] and the more you read the more you study
[1:46:36] the more you listen the more you find
[1:46:38] the God will reveal himself to you
[1:46:40] through his word through the spirit that
[1:46:44] Grace and knowledge has to go together
[1:46:46] just like the Dynamics and mechanics
[1:46:49] amen just like the spirit and the truth
[1:46:52] it all has to go together the blood the
[1:46:54] flesh the prayer the word the Dynamics
[1:46:58] mechanics the grace truth knowledge goes
[1:47:01] together amen so we grow in the grace
[1:47:03] and we know all about the grace but
[1:47:05] that's this is how we grow Amen in Grace
[1:47:09] you can't grow if there's no Grace
[1:47:11] because your sins will condemn
[1:47:14] you but if there's Grace if there's
[1:47:17] Grace there to cover if there's Grace
[1:47:18] there to annihilate if there's Grace
[1:47:20] there to alleviate to annihilate all sin
[1:47:25] that's Grace then you can grow amen amen
[1:47:29] that's what happens a lot of times in
[1:47:31] people's lives children's lives this
[1:47:33] poor little girl I don't know how old
[1:47:34] she was I'm I'm not sure if they've told
[1:47:36] yet it was on this doomed flight that
[1:47:38] came out of
[1:47:39] Philadelphia um headed back to Mexico
[1:47:42] this poor little girl she I guess she
[1:47:44] had some life-threatening situation in
[1:47:47] her life uh and she was at the Shriner
[1:47:51] Hospital in Philadelphia to get
[1:47:52] treatment
[1:47:53] to try to help her uh apparently uh no
[1:47:57] matter what life saving efforts the
[1:48:00] Shriners in anybody else tried it was
[1:48:02] her time to go home right now I don't
[1:48:04] know if she was at the age of
[1:48:06] accountability or any of that I haven't
[1:48:08] heard an age I don't know how old she
[1:48:10] was but apparently she sounded fairly
[1:48:12] small under the age of 16 at least but
[1:48:15] um it it was it was her time but see a
[1:48:20] lot of times uh you you you've got like
[1:48:24] St Jude's hospital and you've got
[1:48:26] Shriners and you've got these that uh
[1:48:28] deal with uh cancer and children and
[1:48:31] Leukemia and stuff like that when
[1:48:33] there's when there's something that
[1:48:35] comes in uh a a person uh a body whether
[1:48:40] a child or not but some it seems to grip
[1:48:43] us more when it's a child uh comes into
[1:48:46] that body that that's not right uh
[1:48:49] brother brandham called cancer a
[1:48:51] perverted blood cell or uh uh perverted
[1:48:55] or U backslid I think is what he said
[1:48:59] blood cell uh that Rebels against the
[1:49:03] body instead of helping the
[1:49:05] body uh there there comes an
[1:49:08] impediment amen and and it it keeps a
[1:49:12] person from growing the way they're
[1:49:14] supposed to
[1:49:15] grow uh normally growth comes in human
[1:49:19] growth as you're born and everything
[1:49:21] operates in your body is supposed to and
[1:49:23] you grow and you get older and you
[1:49:24] become bigger and uh you become adult
[1:49:27] amen but when a child especially gets an
[1:49:30] impediment or something comes in their
[1:49:32] lives like a backsliding blood cell or
[1:49:33] something leukemia it it throws it
[1:49:37] throws that body into a a stunted State
[1:49:41] amen because uh it keeps them from
[1:49:44] growing the way they're supposed to and
[1:49:47] that's what I think the first warning
[1:49:49] the 17th verse is really telling and the
[1:49:52] 18
[1:49:53] first that we we not allow
[1:49:57] impediments we not allow black uh
[1:50:00] backslid blood cells Renegade blood
[1:50:03] cells whatever it is no impediments to
[1:50:05] cause any uh uh disruption to our growth
[1:50:09] as we grow in the Lord we grow in Grace
[1:50:12] amen the grace of God the grace of God
[1:50:15] brings life to us because we realize
[1:50:18] that the grace is what annihilates the
[1:50:20] sin in our life uh the grace is what
[1:50:23] puts us in a position before God that
[1:50:26] really as a human as a mortal we don't
[1:50:28] even belong because his blood was shed
[1:50:30] at Calvary it puts us and elevates us
[1:50:33] into that position amen it's not
[1:50:35] something I did it's what he did amen we
[1:50:38] keep from any impediments coming and
[1:50:41] keeping us from getting to that place
[1:50:44] amen anything from stunting our growth
[1:50:47] that's where the knowledge comes in you
[1:50:48] go you grow in the grace and in the
[1:50:50] knowledge as you get older you get
[1:50:53] smarter as you get older you gain more
[1:50:55] knowledge and things happen and uh I
[1:50:59] I've probably had this by a lot of
[1:51:00] people and I don't know why I'm like
[1:51:02] this I can't explain it I just am but I
[1:51:07] I I I know so much obscure stuff that
[1:51:11] you hear in life and that you get from
[1:51:13] the news or whatever
[1:51:16] that uh people say something say well
[1:51:19] yeah yeah this this and they're like how
[1:51:20] do you know that I don't know
[1:51:22] [Music]
[1:51:23] I don't know how how do you know you
[1:51:25] just know I I heard it somewhere it was
[1:51:29] shown to me at some time or I read it
[1:51:32] somewhere or something I I don't
[1:51:34] know I just know but as you get older
[1:51:37] you you you retain knowledge knowledge
[1:51:41] becomes part of your life and you live
[1:51:44] your life based on knowledge when you
[1:51:46] start driving a car one of the first
[1:51:48] things you realize in a car is how The
[1:51:51] Brak and the gas oper
[1:51:53] you know when to put on the gas you know
[1:51:55] when to put on the
[1:51:56] break and once you realize you get out
[1:51:59] on the street you recognize one of the
[1:52:01] first things you need to learn how to do
[1:52:03] is to stop at a stop
[1:52:05] light because we know as you get older
[1:52:07] if you don't stop at a stop light bad
[1:52:09] things are usually going to
[1:52:12] happen amen amen that's just part of
[1:52:17] life I I hope we understand this I just
[1:52:19] give some physical uh analogy of a
[1:52:22] spiritual Revelation to understand it's
[1:52:25] the same thing in our lives amen we grow
[1:52:28] by the knowledge of God we grow by the
[1:52:30] knowledge of Jesus Christ we grow
[1:52:32] because the word speaks to us and shows
[1:52:36] us how we are to live what we are to do
[1:52:38] what's pleasing to the Lord what is what
[1:52:40] he doesn't like and we grow in Grace
[1:52:43] based on the knowledge amen that we
[1:52:46] retain of God Amen again it's the same
[1:52:49] as the mechanics and the
[1:52:50] Dynamics amen you can't have one without
[1:52:53] the other we talked about last week uh
[1:52:57] these three are one the father son the
[1:52:59] Holy Ghost these three are one not agree
[1:53:02] of one they are one can't have one one
[1:53:04] without the other it's the same thing
[1:53:07] you can have mechanics without Dynamics
[1:53:09] but what good does it do you brother R
[1:53:12] talked about car amen you can have the
[1:53:14] Dynamics and not the mechanics but again
[1:53:16] what good does that do you right you got
[1:53:19] to have both you got to have spirit and
[1:53:21] truth right you got to have the Holy
[1:53:23] Ghost and the word the Holy Ghost helps
[1:53:25] you the grace of God but the word helps
[1:53:27] bring
[1:53:29] knowledge Revelation into your life a
[1:53:32] way that you can grow by Praise the Lord
[1:53:35] the grace helps you realize this is who
[1:53:37] I am this is what God's done for me this
[1:53:39] this is where I belong you have to you
[1:53:43] must have both aspects of those to be
[1:53:45] able to grow to be able to grow in the
[1:53:48] word to be able to grow in the
[1:53:51] Lord God God has given us those ways
[1:53:53] those abilities to be able to grow in
[1:53:56] him amen praise the Lord let's stand I'm
[1:54:00] going to stop right
[1:54:07] there I mentioned uh I mentioned that
[1:54:12] flight um I haven't spoke to him but I
[1:54:15] noticed on a map when I started looking
[1:54:17] at it see that and that's
[1:54:19] sometimes I guess why I get information
[1:54:23] I I was listening to that and
[1:54:26] immediately immediately what I do I I
[1:54:29] went picked up my phone and I looked on
[1:54:31] a map to try to find out where it was
[1:54:33] where was position what does it mean to
[1:54:37] me I don't live in
[1:54:39] Philadelphia I don't really know anybody
[1:54:41] that lives in
[1:54:42] Philadelphia why would I
[1:54:44] care I don't know I just did it
[1:54:48] anyway but as I was looking I did find
[1:54:50] out something interesting it was the
[1:54:53] place where this plane crash took place
[1:54:55] is right across
[1:54:57] probably two miles as the crow flies
[1:55:00] from Brother John McFadden's Church wow
[1:55:03] right across the river uh the the plane
[1:55:07] crash was up here the Betsy Ross Bridge
[1:55:10] just down below it you go across that
[1:55:11] bridge and brother John's Church is
[1:55:13] right there right on the river basically
[1:55:16] it's off the river a little bit but it's
[1:55:17] right there amen and I looked and I
[1:55:20] didn't call him he lives way way down in
[1:55:22] Delaware he doesn't live anywhere near
[1:55:24] there but I didn't know if maybe some of
[1:55:25] the people went his church or something
[1:55:27] they there but I I I didn't contact
[1:55:29] having contact I haven't heard from
[1:55:31] Brother John in years but it it just
[1:55:33] struck me as uh something that I could
[1:55:37] identify with because I've been there uh
[1:55:40] you know what I'm saying but anyway um
[1:55:42] so please pray for those people yes and
[1:55:45] that situation but we know that as God
[1:55:49] has given us his Spirit he didn't just
[1:55:51] give it to us for us just to hold on to
[1:55:54] and keep but we are to learn and to grow
[1:55:57] and for God to continue to use us don't
[1:56:00] matter how old you get don't matter how
[1:56:02] young you are you grow in the grace and
[1:56:05] the knowledge of the Lord Jesus
[1:56:06] continually our whole lives is is is
[1:56:09] growing is maturing is getting to that
[1:56:13] place of adulthood amen adulthood in him
[1:56:17] and I've noticed uh I've noticed it
[1:56:20] seems like that it happens more rapidly
[1:56:24] nowadays uh than it did even 30 years
[1:56:27] ago when I started ministering 30 plus
[1:56:30] years ago and uh give my heart to the
[1:56:32] Lord and was really more involved in
[1:56:34] living my life for the Lord uh it seemed
[1:56:37] like it was it it it seems like it's
[1:56:40] been as as we've gone from horse and
[1:56:42] buggy to cars to airplanes to rockets
[1:56:46] that it's kind of done the same thing it
[1:56:48] seems like in the spirit uh where it
[1:56:50] used to seem like it was more a horse
[1:56:52] and buggy now it's just it's like a
[1:56:54] rocket I've seen young people have just
[1:56:56] coming to the Lord and they and the
[1:56:58] Lord's just filled them with so many so
[1:57:00] much understanding of the word it's uh
[1:57:03] it's it's just the Lord so I believe and
[1:57:07] I believe that's purposeful I believe
[1:57:09] that's purposeful to the point that when
[1:57:11] the last person comes in when when that
[1:57:14] point is when that last person comes uh
[1:57:17] that it we won't be here another 40
[1:57:20] years waiting for them to mature yeah
[1:57:22] amen it'll it'll just be right there I
[1:57:25] don't think it'll be too long but that's
[1:57:28] up to the Lord that's just my feeling
[1:57:29] about it but anyway that's just the Lord
[1:57:32] uh unveiling himself praise the Lord
[1:57:35] amen I want to sing that song that Micah
[1:57:38] started out singing um we didn't have it
[1:57:41] on here did we um I feel the
[1:57:45] P do we have it it's not
[1:57:49] on if we don't have it uh I know there's

[1:58:08] know this for the words of it I just
[1:58:10] felt like singing this again because it
[1:58:12] means so much to the acknowledgement of
[1:58:16] really I think what more or less in my
[1:58:19] ramblings was trying to get across amen
[1:58:23] today the groaning feeling of the
