[23:17] some shoveling and his legs were
[23:20] cramping up really bad on him was up all
[23:22] night last night with that I kind of can
[23:24] know at it and a little lesser probably
[23:27] a little lesser
[23:29] um severity maybe but there's been times
[23:32] on the job that I've woke up in the
[23:35] middle of the night my legs cramping and
[23:36] I try to stretch it and when you try to
[23:38] stretch this one this one cramps you try
[23:40] to stretch that muscle that one cramps
[23:42] and I just end up on the floor just
[23:45] praying it might help me because
[23:47] everything's cramping it hurts so bad
[23:49] and uh that seems like kind of what
[23:52] brother Pat experienced last night he

[24:43] um I I just when I get down there I I
[24:46] pull myself over to my suitcase and get
[24:49] that Palm out rub it on my legs and it
[24:52] takes a few minutes but it goes away and
[24:54] I go to bed and can sleep the rest of
[24:56] the night I don't know what that is it

[42:18] choice
[42:24] you want to do this

[42:47] true
[42:48] amen
[42:49] that's I I believe that amen you know I
[42:53] hear so many times certain quotes of the
[42:55] Bible quoted uh one on my you hear a lot
[43:00] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[43:02] that is true that is scripture but you
[43:05] can't dismiss the first part of that
[43:06] scripture which says submit yourselves
[43:09] therefore unto God
[43:11] then you can resist the devil and he has
[43:14] to plead he doesn't have to flee at your
[43:16] word but he has to flee at your word
[43:19] from him it's the life behind the name
[43:23] amen so we sometimes we forget that part
[43:25] resist the devil so I resist the devil
[43:28] he didn't flee but but did you do the
[43:30] first part of that scripture did you
[43:32] submit yourself therefore unto God Amen
[43:35] if thou be amen it's like that song
[43:39] Micah sings it the Gaithers sing do you
[43:42] want to be well

[52:07] your precious loving name Jesus Christ
[52:09] we pray amen amen Genesis chapter one
[52:14] read the first couple of verses
[52:17] amen Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God
[52:20] created the Heaven and the Earth
[52:22] and the Earth was without form and void
[52:24] and darkness is upon the face of the
[52:26] deep
[52:27] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[52:29] face of the waters you could be seated
[52:31] if you'd like
[52:34] amen
[52:36] foreign
[52:37] as I mentioned this is a new beginning
[52:39] part
[52:40] 19. amen and I want to go over to Saint
[52:44] John chapter 14. before we get back into
[52:46] Revelation 21 I want to go over to Saint
[52:49] John chapter 14 and begin our next
[52:52] scripture reading from there
[52:55] Jesus speaking of this that we're
[52:57] looking for this is Jesus speaking of
[53:00] what we have to look forward to amen he
[53:03] described it to his disciples and uh and
[53:06] by revelation we see in this reading
[53:09] that we'll go into what Jesus is trying
[53:12] to explain to not only his disciples
[53:14] here but us today through the ability
[53:17] for us to be able to open these pages
[53:20] and to read these words and to know God
[53:22] revealing those words off of that page
[53:24] into our hearts amen so let's begin
[53:27] reading Saint John 14 uh we'll just
[53:30] begin reading with verse 1.
[53:33] Jesus said let your heart let your let
[53:37] not your heart be troubled you believe
[53:40] in God believe also in me that's one of
[53:43] my favorite scriptures I like that verse
[53:45] especially when you feel overwhelmed or
[53:47] you feel depressed or you feel lost or
[53:50] in any way for some kind of
[53:53] encouragement uh here it is Jesus said
[53:56] let not your heart be troubled when you
[53:58] see everything going on around you see
[54:00] all the turmoil of the world today and
[54:02] you can't understand we just get to the
[54:04] place it
[54:06] me saying what is wrong with people is
[54:09] probably coming a phrase I use daily I
[54:11] probably just need to quit saying that I
[54:14] I pretty much know what's wrong with
[54:16] people but when you see certain things
[54:18] happen in your life what is wrong with
[54:21] people when Common Sense isn't so common
[54:23] anymore
[54:25] um I probably just need to quit doing
[54:26] that but uh but when you see those
[54:30] things you you know
[54:32] as much as we do what we can in this
[54:35] world this world is not our home Jesus
[54:38] spoke to us and said let not your heart
[54:40] be troubled amen that's some of the
[54:43] greatest words I know that we can tell
[54:44] to anybody especially if you're a
[54:46] Christian let not your heart be troubled
[54:49] what is there to worry about what is
[54:50] there to uh fraternize over what is
[54:53] there to be depressed about or stressed
[54:55] over when Jesus said let not your heart
[54:58] be troubled amen he's got it all under
[55:00] control he's handling it all amen no
[55:03] matter what the circumstances look like
[55:05] perfect faith brother Graham said
[55:08] perfect Faith Masters every circumstance
[55:11] right let not your heart be troubled
[55:13] amen you believe in God believe also in
[55:16] me in my father's house are many
[55:18] mansions if it were not so I would have
[55:21] told you I go to prepare a place for you
[55:25] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[55:27] I will come again and receive you unto
[55:30] myself that where I am there ye may be
[55:33] also what a wonderful promise and
[55:36] whether I go ye know and the way ye know
[55:40] Thomas said unto him Lord we know not
[55:43] whether thou goest and how can we know
[55:45] the way Jesus said unto him I am the way
[55:49] amen I am the way the truth the life no
[55:53] man cometh unto the father but by me
[55:55] amen uh if you had known me you should
[55:59] have known my father also and from
[56:02] henceforth you know him and have seen
[56:05] him Philip said unto him Lord show us
[56:08] the father and it sufficeth us Jesus
[56:10] said unto him have I been so long time
[56:13] with you and yet he has uh hast thou not
[56:16] known me Philip he that has seen me has
[56:19] seen the father and has uh and has and
[56:22] and how sayest thou show us the father
[56:25] believeth thou that I am in the father
[56:28] and the father in me and the words that
[56:30] I speak unto you I speak not of myself
[56:32] but uh but the father that dwelleth in
[56:35] me
[56:36] uh in me he dwell uh doeth the works
[56:40] uh believe uh believe me that I am in
[56:43] the father and the father in me or else
[56:46] believe me for the very work sake now
[56:48] Jesus is speaking about a place that he
[56:52] has gone to prepare for us amen and he
[56:55] tells his disciples here and he gets
[56:57] personal with them but before we get to
[56:59] that uh let's go back and reiterate talk
[57:02] about these little nuances that the that
[57:05] the Lord Jesus gives us here in this
[57:07] reading of the word in my father's house
[57:10] are many mansions now in our English
[57:12] language that doesn't make any sense a
[57:15] house uh in my father's house or many
[57:17] mansions well we figure a mansion is a
[57:20] humongous place that people live in and
[57:22] a house is just a small little darling
[57:24] place so how could a mansion that in a
[57:26] house Must List many mansions fit in one
[57:29] house so we understand if you go and
[57:32] look at what Jesus was talking about
[57:33] back in that vernacular that day a house
[57:37] was considered a kingdom
[57:39] and in my kingdom are many palaces or
[57:42] Mansions you could still
[57:44] s Palace but the house is a kingdom not
[57:48] just one simple dwelling place that has
[57:51] four walls and a door but a kingdom so
[57:54] the house that he's talking about is his
[57:57] kingdom in My Kingdom there's many
[58:00] palaces amen because he said he has
[58:03] already gone to prepare that place now a
[58:06] lot of people in this life they want to
[58:08] gain a lot of money and they want to
[58:09] have big houses and palaces and mansions
[58:11] and things like that and that's okay
[58:13] there's nothing wrong with that um
[58:15] whatever a person is ours is not my
[58:17] desire at one point in my life I used to
[58:20] uh I'll tell you something that one of
[58:23] the greatest lessons brother green ever
[58:25] taught me where we're going up Campbell
[58:27] I believe it was and I told him I said
[58:29] I'd like to have a house up there on the
[58:31] hill he looked at me and he said why
[58:34] and I couldn't answer him
[58:38] because of the city lights because the
[58:40] Mountain Lights I I didn't know there's
[58:42] millions of dollars millions of dollars
[58:45] up on that Hillside he looked at me said
[58:46] why do you want one up there and I
[58:49] really couldn't answer them because it
[58:50] was just vanity actually when I looked
[58:54] internally at his question to me the
[58:57] only thing that I could surmise in me
[58:59] was it's just vanity I just wanted one
[59:02] because it was big it was expensive it
[59:04] was beautiful the view or whatever it
[59:06] was but when when his question broke
[59:09] down in my heart to why it made me
[59:11] realize why do I want something like
[59:13] that hey it's just more headache it's
[59:16] just more upkeep it's just more
[59:17] expensive it's just more to clean it's
[59:19] just more to have to deal with why why
[59:21] would I want something like that when I
[59:24] hear Brother Ray I'm talking about when
[59:25] they
[59:26] a little cabin by the Riverside I'm
[59:28] thinking now that's more my speed
[59:30] amen now can somebody if you want to
[59:32] answer there's nothing wrong with that
[59:33] you want one up there that's fine maybe
[59:35] you can
[59:36] connect question just
[59:37] the question in my life was when he
[59:39] asked it to me was just pure vanity
[59:41] that's all it was in my in my heart and
[59:45] that helped me because I I got rid of
[59:47] that I'm like you know truth is I really
[59:49] don't and at this point in my life or
[59:52] our life just the two of us why would I
[59:54] want
[59:55] ten thousand square foot for me and my
[59:57] wife I'm or even if my son and daughter
[1:00:00] and family came over what is that eight
[1:00:02] of us total now with little baby ruth
[1:00:05] what's the point so anyway uh some
[1:00:09] people like that and that's okay but in
[1:00:11] God's kingdom there's many palaces or
[1:00:15] places of dwelling amen places of
[1:00:18] dwelling that place he has gone to
[1:00:19] prepare for us is places that's already
[1:00:22] built now in the Millennium we talked
[1:00:25] about that uh in there we will work we
[1:00:28] will build houses we will inhabit the
[1:00:30] houses that we build we will plant
[1:00:31] Vineyards we will eat it the fruit of
[1:00:33] those Vineyards but in this place it's
[1:00:36] already built we don't build this God's
[1:00:39] already built it so when he says in my
[1:00:42] kingdom are many mansions or many
[1:00:44] palaces you can understand that God's
[1:00:46] already done it he said I have gone to
[1:00:49] prepare a place for you amen
[1:00:53] I've gone to prepare and that's what God
[1:00:55] has done so when we read the scripture
[1:00:57] which we'll read again in a minute that
[1:01:00] John saw the holy city coming down from
[1:01:03] God out of Heaven is because God was it
[1:01:06] there in preparation of that place to
[1:01:09] bring it down upon that mountain so when
[1:01:12] Jesus said I have gone to prepare a
[1:01:13] place you can believe that because if
[1:01:15] they're waiting for this destruction of
[1:01:17] this Earth and that mountain to push up
[1:01:19] so that City can come right down on top
[1:01:21] of that mountain and set down upon that
[1:01:23] mountain and for all for all of us to
[1:01:25] eventually live upon amen amen praise
[1:01:28] the Lord so in my father's Kingdom now
[1:01:31] our many mansions palaces if it were not
[1:01:35] Saul I would have told you I go to
[1:01:37] prepare a place for you amen I'm
[1:01:41] thankful for that that's that place he's
[1:01:43] talking about now that's that place
[1:01:44] we've been reading about that's that
[1:01:46] place that we've been preaching on for
[1:01:47] almost 19 went on 19 sermons now with
[1:01:50] the new beginning it's that place Jesus
[1:01:53] said I go to prepare that place for you
[1:01:56] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[1:01:58] that means I'm going to come and get you
[1:02:01] and take you back with me so that we can
[1:02:04] all be in that place
[1:02:06] I prepared this place for you think
[1:02:10] about that for a minute amen because the
[1:02:12] Bible tells us that this world was
[1:02:14] created by God for God
[1:02:16] amen we live here we enjoy the parts of
[1:02:21] this world that we can uh many of it we
[1:02:25] can't anymore especially that we can and
[1:02:28] and that's good but this place God said
[1:02:31] I've gone to prepare for you
[1:02:35] amen it doesn't say he prepared this
[1:02:37] place for himself
[1:02:39] like he did this Earth
[1:02:41] but this place he said I've gone to
[1:02:43] prepare for you so you can think in your
[1:02:46] heart and know that whatever
[1:02:49] is about all of our individualities
[1:02:52] always because so many times friends and
[1:02:56] I hate this but so many times
[1:02:58] and I'll say it preachers especially
[1:03:02] want to stick everybody in a little box
[1:03:05] and and and make us
[1:03:08] like we're supposed to be cookie cutter
[1:03:11] Christians that every one of us are
[1:03:13] supposed to come out on some Godly
[1:03:16] conveyor belt and as we go by God's got
[1:03:19] a stamp it says boom there's Boo and
[1:03:21] every one of us is supposed to be
[1:03:23] exactly the same
[1:03:24] so when there's any variance of anybody
[1:03:27] when there's any different things in our
[1:03:30] lives not ungodly not sinful but just
[1:03:32] differences amen
[1:03:34] you you may eat you may eat Mexican food
[1:03:37] every day I eat it once every two or
[1:03:40] three months
[1:03:42] because I like it but I don't like it
[1:03:44] like that uh my son he probably would
[1:03:50] choose sushi restaurant over any other
[1:03:52] place yes
[1:03:54] yes I wouldn't go there if it was the
[1:03:56] last restaurant on the planet
[1:03:59] I would go find a squirrel or a rabbit
[1:04:02] or something and Chase it down and kill
[1:04:05] it before I would go to a sushi
[1:04:07] restaurant or eat sushi there are other
[1:04:10] things at sushi restaurants now that I
[1:04:12] do like like dip knock yourself but
[1:04:13] anyway not sushi so
[1:04:17] even my son for my own Lawrence is that
[1:04:20] much different than me see we're not
[1:04:22] cookie cutter Christians so when God
[1:04:25] says he's gone to prepare it for you
[1:04:27] that means that your Mansion your Palace
[1:04:30] your place of dwelling wherever God has
[1:04:32] for you when brother random talks about
[1:04:34] his Log Cabin friend if that was the
[1:04:36] desire in his heart you can bet on
[1:04:38] that's what's going to be there right
[1:04:41] right that's the way I believe anyway
[1:04:42] and what is in your heart what God does
[1:04:46] for you see this place is prepared for
[1:04:49] us amen it's gonna fit your little
[1:04:52] nuances and desires and things that you
[1:04:54] like nothing worldly not nothing vain
[1:04:56] it's not going to be vanity none of
[1:04:59] that's going to be there but from the
[1:05:00] very desire of your heart desires like
[1:05:02] that that's how God's preparing this
[1:05:04] preparing it for you amen not for
[1:05:07] himself but for few uh for you I've gone
[1:05:10] and prepare a place for you amen amen I
[1:05:15] will come again and receive you unto
[1:05:17] myself and that's what we're waiting for
[1:05:19] as the time now that's the place that
[1:05:22] we're sitting hopefully prayerfully
[1:05:24] we're believing is going to be not too
[1:05:26] much longer we don't know but that's up
[1:05:29] to him
[1:05:30] but he's going to come and receive us
[1:05:32] back unto himself that where he is is
[1:05:36] where we'll be
[1:05:38] amen and I like that and it won't just
[1:05:41] be in a spirit form like we know now
[1:05:44] that Jesus said I'll never leave you or
[1:05:46] forsake you he's always with us we know
[1:05:48] that but this won't just be Spirit form
[1:05:50] this will be he'll be there and we'll be
[1:05:53] there praise the Lord
[1:05:56] sometimes family moves away and goes and
[1:05:59] does things say well my spirit will be
[1:06:01] with you or I will be with you or
[1:06:02] something like that when you know but
[1:06:05] it's different when you're right there
[1:06:07] when you're right there together and
[1:06:09] that's exactly what it's going to be
[1:06:10] we're going to be right there with him
[1:06:12] every day yes praise the Lord every day
[1:06:16] there will I uh ye be also and whether I
[1:06:20] go now listen remember he's talking to
[1:06:22] his disciples here he says and whether I
[1:06:24] go you know
[1:06:26] so he's telling them where I'm going you
[1:06:30] know where I'm going
[1:06:31] and you know the way to get there
[1:06:34] you know how to get there and the way
[1:06:36] you know
[1:06:37] he's he's telling his disciples you know
[1:06:40] where I'm going and you know how to get
[1:06:42] there and look at the first thing Thomas
[1:06:45] says of course probably just he's just
[1:06:48] speaking up for the rest of them because
[1:06:50] they probably all thought the same thing
[1:06:52] Thomas said unto him Lord we don't know
[1:06:56] where you're going we know we we know
[1:06:58] not whether they're going and how can we
[1:07:00] know the way
[1:07:02] which makes sense how can you know to
[1:07:04] get there if you don't even know where
[1:07:05] you're going right amen
[1:07:08] if you've never been to Tucson before
[1:07:10] and I'm and I I tell you to go to a
[1:07:13] store over at 22nd Broadway oh what good
[1:07:18] does that do you
[1:07:20] you may not know or just say uh go to
[1:07:23] the go to the fries on the other side of
[1:07:25] town
[1:07:26] or or just go to the grocery store which
[1:07:29] grocery store
[1:07:30] which town this town how do you get
[1:07:33] there
[1:07:33] so it makes sense I mean what Thomas
[1:07:35] says makes sense if I don't even know
[1:07:37] where you're going how can I know how to
[1:07:38] get there if I don't know where you're
[1:07:40] going but the thing is they already knew
[1:07:45] if they didn't already know Jesus
[1:07:47] wouldn't have told them that right right
[1:07:48] Jesus told him you already know
[1:07:52] Thomas said no we don't Jesus said yes
[1:07:55] you do
[1:07:56] you just don't know you know and see
[1:07:58] that's something that I look at today
[1:08:00] kind of the place a lot of times where
[1:08:03] the bride is today there's a sequels
[1:08:06] faith comes by hearing and hearing the
[1:08:08] word of God
[1:08:09] it helps bring us to a place and I've
[1:08:12] heard so many times people said we go to
[1:08:14] church and and we go home we go to
[1:08:16] church we go home if you go to church
[1:08:18] and the pure word of God the pure
[1:08:21] unadulterated word of God not man's
[1:08:23] ideas but the word of God is priests it
[1:08:27] cannot return void amen and if it cannot
[1:08:30] return void that means it is working
[1:08:32] something in your life yes and if it's
[1:08:35] working something in your life whether
[1:08:37] you know it whether you can feel it
[1:08:38] whether it's become to use something of
[1:08:40] a reality of that time it is working a
[1:08:43] work in your life and you have to
[1:08:45] believe and have faith and know that
[1:08:48] that word is taking its uh preeminence
[1:08:51] in your life amen it's working to work
[1:08:54] Jesus being in their presence was
[1:08:57] working at work and those disciples
[1:08:59] lives way more than they ever thought
[1:09:01] and so when it got to this place and
[1:09:04] Jesus said you know where I'm going you
[1:09:07] know how to get there they knew it but
[1:09:10] they just didn't know
[1:09:12] sometimes that's exactly where we need
[1:09:14] to get to we know you think well how
[1:09:17] does this fracturing Faith gonna be
[1:09:19] you'll know it when the time comes yes
[1:09:22] that's the way I see it some people say
[1:09:25] well it's got to be this got to be that
[1:09:26] I don't like the guy to bees anyway
[1:09:28] because I don't put a period at the end
[1:09:31] of my sentence this year when it comes
[1:09:32] to the Lord I put a comma amen and
[1:09:35] there's no gotta bees it doesn't got to
[1:09:37] be it's got to be according to a
[1:09:38] scripture but that's it amen any other
[1:09:41] God of bees doesn't have to go to be
[1:09:43] because that puts in your little box
[1:09:45] again right it doesn't got to be this
[1:09:47] way it's got to be the way God says it's
[1:09:49] going to be whether you understand it or
[1:09:52] not right amen amen no God is what's got
[1:09:55] to be like this no it doesn't right
[1:09:57] right it's going to be the way he says
[1:10:00] it's going to be and when God and this
[1:10:03] bride because I've heard people say well
[1:10:06] how's this and even Brothers Brother
[1:10:09] Band would say how how can we expect
[1:10:11] rapturing Faith don't have faith to heal
[1:10:13] a headache yes but friend let me promise
[1:10:15] just one thing for those who of course
[1:10:18] surprise this words being priests that
[1:10:21] work is being done in your life when you
[1:10:23] need Rapture faith and rapturing faith
[1:10:25] is
[1:10:26] Premiere at that time you will have it
[1:10:29] you will have something you don't
[1:10:32] realize you have right now we all do we
[1:10:35] are because the word to not return void
[1:10:37] you have something now we all do that
[1:10:40] you don't know
[1:10:42] they had something they didn't know
[1:10:46] they didn't know where he was going they
[1:10:48] didn't know the way that's why Jesus had
[1:10:50] to tell him I am the way
[1:10:53] if you don't know the way then you don't
[1:10:56] know me
[1:10:57] if you know me Jesus saying I'm pointing
[1:11:00] myself but Jesus is saying if you know
[1:11:03] me you know the way
[1:11:05] I've told you that's what he was just
[1:11:08] starting telling them when you've seen
[1:11:10] me you've seen the father so you know
[1:11:12] who it is you know how to get there
[1:11:14] because I'm the way and if you know me
[1:11:16] you know the way
[1:11:18] it's that simple if we know him we know
[1:11:22] the way right right if we know him we
[1:11:25] have the faith if we know him we know
[1:11:27] everything we need to know
[1:11:29] the Overcomers to overcome praise the
[1:11:33] Lord everything we have need to know we
[1:11:36] know now
[1:11:37] praise God
[1:11:40] Jesus said I am the way I am the truth
[1:11:44] and I am the life no man coming to the
[1:11:47] father but by me
[1:11:49] he told pilate the same thing
[1:11:52] amen and pilate looked at him and said
[1:11:54] what is truth
[1:11:57] without revelation
[1:11:59] he didn't know and he genuinely didn't
[1:12:01] know and he said what is truth well
[1:12:04] truth is standing right there staring
[1:12:06] you in your eyeball that's truth because
[1:12:09] truth's not a thing it's not a statement
[1:12:11] it's a person
[1:12:12] truth is a person and the person of
[1:12:15] Jesus Christ yes that is the way the
[1:12:19] truth the life amen nobody could come in
[1:12:22] the father but by him and he goes on and
[1:12:24] describes that now let's move on to the
[1:12:27] city he's talking about because this
[1:12:30] city is not only as we are going to live
[1:12:32] in that physical City in glorified
[1:12:34] conditions we're not going to be clouds
[1:12:36] puffing around just floating around and
[1:12:39] hello brother Dennis and hello sister
[1:12:42] Celia we're not going to be clouds just
[1:12:45] floating around we're going to be
[1:12:46] peaceful and glorified bodies yeah amen
[1:12:48] there'll be no there'll be no sin
[1:12:50] there'll be no uh fleshly humanly
[1:12:53] desires like we have today right amen
[1:12:55] we'll all be in the prom of Life which
[1:12:58] brother Brown described as around 19 20
[1:13:00] 21 years old and the problem of life
[1:13:02] before that first light goes out which I
[1:13:05] think he said we talked about the other
[1:13:07] day was that 21-22 I forget now the
[1:13:10] First Light of Life goes out at about 21
[1:13:12] 22 years old so to me it would have to
[1:13:16] be before that first light went out
[1:13:18] would be considered the problem of life
[1:13:20] sure so I'm assuming that's why brother
[1:13:22] Brandon mentioned 90 20 21 years old
[1:13:25] will be in that place in that condition
[1:13:28] but this will also be a this won't just
[1:13:31] because even though it'll be a physical
[1:13:33] uh event that takes place this mountain
[1:13:36] and the city uh and we'll be there with
[1:13:39] him in physical we see the light we
[1:13:41] talked about last week Jesus the lamb is
[1:13:43] the light it'll also be a spiritual
[1:13:45] event because anything with God is the
[1:13:47] spiritual event because he's a spirit
[1:13:49] amen God is a spirit so we know it will
[1:13:54] be but even the Corporal body of the
[1:13:58] position of Jesus uh will be prominent
[1:14:03] here obviously well there'll be a time
[1:14:06] when it won't be but that's Way Beyond
[1:14:08] anything that we have written or can
[1:14:10] think of or worry about amen but here it
[1:14:13] will be it'll be a prominent event
[1:14:16] spiritual and natural physical event as
[1:14:19] again as we are in our glorified bodies
[1:14:23] if you know me you should have known my
[1:14:26] father also and from henceforth uh you
[1:14:29] know him and has seen him now let's move
[1:14:32] on let's go over I want to read the rest
[1:14:34] of that let's go over to Revelation now
[1:14:36] uh chapter 21.
[1:14:43] so I can I can tell us all the same
[1:14:46] thing
[1:14:47] if you're a Believer if you're an
[1:14:49] overcomer if you're a Christian
[1:14:50] born-again Christian
[1:14:51] you know the way
[1:14:54] because you know him because Jesus is
[1:14:57] the way yes amen right he is the way so
[1:15:00] if you know him you know the way praise
[1:15:03] the Lord so when he says I'm going to
[1:15:05] come and and get you and take you back
[1:15:08] so that I'm with you always you're with
[1:15:10] me always we know that way because we
[1:15:13] know him
[1:15:15] praise the Lord been revealed God has
[1:15:18] shown Us in this day future home let me
[1:15:20] read this
[1:15:22] he's talking about Feast of Tabernacles
[1:15:24] gathering places for in the Millennium
[1:15:26] look now I think maybe I've already said
[1:15:28] this in the Millennium the Bible said
[1:15:31] they shall build houses they shall
[1:15:32] inhabit them but in this new Earth he's
[1:15:36] already went and prepared the place it's
[1:15:39] already built
[1:15:40] praise the Lord already built we just
[1:15:43] read it Jesus said I go to prepare a
[1:15:45] place we have nothing to do with the
[1:15:48] building of it amen because it's Eternal
[1:15:50] it's uh uh we enter into eternity oh I
[1:15:54] just love that word my a holy
[1:15:56] complication holy Gathering Place we
[1:15:59] went into that few few months ago now
[1:16:01] let's go Revelation chapter 21
[1:16:05] uh we'll just begin with the first verse
[1:16:10] but I want to read the whole chapter
[1:16:12] whole chapter revelation 21.
[1:16:15] and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth
[1:16:17] the first Heaven and the first Earth
[1:16:19] were passed away and there was no more
[1:16:21] to see I John saw the holy city New
[1:16:24] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:16:26] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:16:29] her husband why
[1:16:31] because he made it for you
[1:16:35] amen amen in that in that the bride the
[1:16:38] bride to the husband praise the Lord
[1:16:42] oh that's beautiful uh third verse and I
[1:16:45] heard a great voice
[1:16:47] uh Out of Heaven saying behold the
[1:16:50] Tabernacle of God is with men
[1:16:52] and he will dwell with them and they
[1:16:54] shall be his people and God himself
[1:16:57] shall be with them and be their God Amen
[1:17:00] God shall wipe away all tears from their
[1:17:02] eyes and there shall be no more death
[1:17:04] neither sorrow nor crying think of what
[1:17:08] this is going to be like Saints amen no
[1:17:11] crying neither shall there be any more
[1:17:14] pain
[1:17:15] no more pain brother no more leg cramps
[1:17:18] amen no more pain for the former things
[1:17:21] are passed away and he that set upon the
[1:17:24] throne said behold I make all things new
[1:17:27] and he said unto me right for these
[1:17:30] words are true and faithful and he said
[1:17:32] unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega
[1:17:35] the beginning and the end I will give
[1:17:37] unto him that is the thirst of the
[1:17:39] Fountain of Water of Life freely he that
[1:17:42] overcometh look at this now he that
[1:17:45] overcometh and he's speaking about the
[1:17:47] Overcomer which we will talk about a
[1:17:49] little bit through the finishing
[1:17:51] duration of this message
[1:17:53] uh like he does in Revelation 3 21. amen
[1:17:58] you know what let me just shoot over
[1:18:00] there real quick Revelation 3 21 to him
[1:18:03] that overcometh I will grant you sit
[1:18:06] with me in in my throne even as I also
[1:18:10] overcame and I'm sat down with my father
[1:18:12] in his throne
[1:18:16] now the overcomer he that over at
[1:18:19] seventh verse again Revelation 21 7 back
[1:18:22] here again he that overcometh shall
[1:18:24] inherit all things well of course you're
[1:18:26] going to inherit all things because
[1:18:27] they've inherited to sit with him in his
[1:18:30] throne only the Overcomer who inherits
[1:18:33] all things sit on the throne
[1:18:36] I that that's the only ones that could
[1:18:39] be there
[1:18:40] they may and the older ones that could
[1:18:41] sit in judgment
[1:18:43] praise the Lord
[1:18:45] inherit all things and I will be his God
[1:18:47] and he shall be my son
[1:18:49] but the fearful and unbelieving and the
[1:18:52] Abominable the murderers poor mongers
[1:18:55] Sorcerers idolaters and all liars shall
[1:19:00] have their part in the lake which
[1:19:02] burneth with fire and brimstone which is
[1:19:04] the second death now these are people of
[1:19:07] course that that died their first
[1:19:10] natural death
[1:19:11] did not come for the Thousand Years of
[1:19:13] the Millennium they laid in the grave
[1:19:15] amen come up at the end of the second uh
[1:19:18] in the second Resurrection after the
[1:19:20] Millennium to be judged at the white
[1:19:23] Throne judgment and were cast aside on
[1:19:26] the Left Right amen not not as the Sheep
[1:19:29] but as the goat to the left and we're
[1:19:31] cast into the Lake of Fire With the
[1:19:33] Devil with the false prophet the Beast
[1:19:35] in the Lake of Fire which burns with
[1:19:38] Brimstone it's the second death now what
[1:19:42] is death remember death is separation
[1:19:46] right death is a separation from God
[1:19:49] when God told them in the Garden of Eden
[1:19:51] the day you do this the day you die
[1:19:55] well they didn't die not naturally they
[1:19:58] still live their natural lives so if you
[1:20:00] read the scripture and God tells them
[1:20:02] and they did exactly what he told them
[1:20:04] not to do and God said if you do this
[1:20:07] you'll die what they did is they
[1:20:09] separated themselves from God Amen
[1:20:13] a great Chasm was thrown between God and
[1:20:16] man not to be returned again until the
[1:20:19] until the time of the birth of Jesus
[1:20:21] Christ who shed his life blood gave his
[1:20:25] life to bridge that Gap
[1:20:27] the blood of Jesus Christ bled to bridge
[1:20:30] the chasm to bring God and man back
[1:20:33] together again but at this time they
[1:20:36] separated themselves so what is the
[1:20:39] second death the second death is not
[1:20:41] only a a separation a complete
[1:20:45] separation but it's a permanent
[1:20:47] separation yes this separation or the
[1:20:50] second death as is called here in the
[1:20:52] scripture is a permanent separation of
[1:20:56] those that are in the Lake of Fire from
[1:20:58] God right amen amen no more chance no
[1:21:01] more hope it is over yes separated
[1:21:04] the second death
[1:21:07] amen this is set for those that fit this
[1:21:13] scripture reading verse 8 the Abominable
[1:21:17] whoremongers murders Sorcerers all those
[1:21:19] things Liars
[1:21:21] but understand you say well I'm not a
[1:21:24] sorcerer but if you
[1:21:27] if you do things
[1:21:29] in that capacity see it doesn't have to
[1:21:32] be somebody that worships the devil or
[1:21:35] uh something to that effect
[1:21:39] this is a generality statements
[1:21:45] adjectives words to describe uh those
[1:21:49] situations
[1:21:51] encompasses many actions
[1:21:54] uh sorcerer is not just
[1:21:57] a a Wiccan or a wizard
[1:22:01] amen there's
[1:22:03] there's thousands maybe millions of
[1:22:05] people that fall into this category not
[1:22:09] because they worship the devil or are a
[1:22:12] wizard or something to that effect but
[1:22:15] of the actions that they produce in
[1:22:17] their lives make makes them uh follows
[1:22:21] them under that category
[1:22:23] amen amen like a murderer murder is not
[1:22:27] just somebody that takes a person's life
[1:22:29] according to the Bible a murder is
[1:22:32] somebody who speaks something ill about
[1:22:34] somebody else and their tongue and their
[1:22:37] verbiage destroys that person's
[1:22:39] character right right that's murder
[1:22:42] when you say something or you present
[1:22:44] something about somebody to somebody
[1:22:47] else that's why you got to be very
[1:22:48] careful how you talk about other
[1:22:50] people's things yes uh I've probably
[1:22:53] been guilty of it of my life in the past
[1:22:55] and the Lord help me I try not to man we
[1:22:57] got to be very careful the way we talk
[1:22:58] about other people you could kill or
[1:23:01] murder that person to somebody else just
[1:23:03] with your tongue you don't have to have
[1:23:05] a gun you don't have the ax or Knight
[1:23:07] you can kill their character and if you
[1:23:10] do that you're You're a murderer right
[1:23:13] amen Jesus said uh that thou sayeth said
[1:23:18] whoever takes the life he said he said
[1:23:21] Jesus said I say whoever hates your
[1:23:24] brother without cause is a murder
[1:23:26] already
[1:23:27] hating your brother without cause
[1:23:30] amen and and what causes there for us to
[1:23:33] hate anybody is is mighty right you love
[1:23:36] it yeah I don't have any reason to hate
[1:23:39] anybody amen I don't care what they've
[1:23:41] done now you may disagree with that and
[1:23:44] you're welcome to but I I don't have a
[1:23:47] reason to hate anybody
[1:23:49] the Bible Jesus said to love your
[1:23:51] enemies well if you can't hate your
[1:23:53] enemies and you're supposed to love your
[1:23:54] enemies then who are you going to hate
[1:23:57] there's nobody left if you can't hate
[1:24:00] your enemy then who is there to hate
[1:24:02] yeah if you feel like you hate a person
[1:24:05] you're automatically going to do what
[1:24:07] put them into the enemy category right
[1:24:09] but if you're supposed to love your
[1:24:10] enemy how are you gonna hate them
[1:24:13] amen so you understand my point yeah so
[1:24:16] when Jesus said if you hate your brother
[1:24:19] without cause how can you hate him to
[1:24:21] begin with
[1:24:22] but our tongue destroys people's
[1:24:24] characters
[1:24:25] amen and when you do that you're a
[1:24:27] murderer
[1:24:28] so my point being is
[1:24:31] people look at this say well I didn't do
[1:24:33] that and I didn't know and I didn't do
[1:24:34] that and I wasn't like that no but what
[1:24:36] were we like what did we do that could
[1:24:39] fall under any of these things that he's
[1:24:41] talking about oh I just tell a little
[1:24:44] white lie
[1:24:45] I don't care if it's blue green brown
[1:24:48] purple yellow
[1:24:50] psychedelic it's a lie if it's a lie
[1:24:53] it's a lie white green yellow purple
[1:24:54] doesn't matter
[1:24:56] it's a lot
[1:24:58] you understand amen and of course this
[1:25:01] also is people who did not and did not
[1:25:04] accept and rejected the blood of Jesus
[1:25:06] Christ which cleanses any of that from
[1:25:08] all of our lives and could cleanse all
[1:25:11] of that from all of our Lives if we
[1:25:12] expect it believe it and receive it to
[1:25:15] ourselves that blood will annihilate
[1:25:18] because they any of us in here could say
[1:25:20] we didn't lie at some point in our lives
[1:25:22] amen
[1:25:24] but if we're truly repentful in our
[1:25:26] hearts and we go to the Lord and ask
[1:25:28] forgiveness he forgives us we don't live
[1:25:30] we don't live a Perpetual life of lying
[1:25:34] that's different amen
[1:25:37] let's move on
[1:25:39] that's the second death now and there
[1:25:41] came unto me one of the Seven Angels
[1:25:43] which had the seven vowels full of the
[1:25:45] seven last plagues and talk with me
[1:25:47] saying come hither and I will show Thee
[1:25:50] the bride the Lamb's wife
[1:25:52] okay now that angel is going to show
[1:25:55] John me
[1:25:57] and you because we're that bribe yes
[1:26:00] amen I like that
[1:26:03] praise the Lord and he carried me away
[1:26:05] in the spirit to a great and high
[1:26:07] mountain and showed me that great City
[1:26:10] the holy Jerusalem descending Out of
[1:26:12] Heaven from God having the glory of God
[1:26:14] remember it's not just physical but it's
[1:26:16] spiritual too having the glory of God
[1:26:19] and her light was like unto a stone most
[1:26:22] precious even like a jasper stone
[1:26:25] clearest Crystal maybe I get Mike up
[1:26:27] here to give us a gym lesson about all
[1:26:29] these gems we're getting ready to talk
[1:26:31] about
[1:26:33] they're all through the scripture those
[1:26:34] things and every one of them has a
[1:26:36] significance and relevance in the
[1:26:37] scripture amen many of them deal with
[1:26:40] the Jews
[1:26:42] probably get into later and he had a
[1:26:44] wall great and high that had 12 gates
[1:26:47] and at the gates 12 angels and names
[1:26:51] were written there on which are which
[1:26:53] are the names of the 12 tribes of the
[1:26:55] children of Israel on the East three
[1:26:58] gates on the north three gates on the
[1:27:01] south three gates on the west three
[1:27:02] gates we're not getting to the wall yet
[1:27:03] so I'm just going to skip through this
[1:27:05] and the wall of the city had 12
[1:27:07] foundations and then the names of The
[1:27:10] Twelve Apostles of the lamb and he had
[1:27:12] talked with me had and he that talked to
[1:27:14] me had a great a golden Reed to measure
[1:27:18] the city and the gates thereof and the
[1:27:20] wall thereof in the city life Foursquare
[1:27:22] the length is as large as the breath as
[1:27:25] he measured the city with the Reed 12
[1:27:28] 000 furlongs the length of breadth the
[1:27:30] height are all equal and we've already
[1:27:32] went through that
[1:27:34] and he measured the wall thereof and 140
[1:27:37] and four cubits according to the measure
[1:27:39] of a man that is of the Angel the
[1:27:42] building of the wall of it was a pure uh
[1:27:44] was of Jasper and the city was pure gold
[1:27:47] the city which we're talking about now
[1:27:49] because that's more I want to focus on
[1:27:51] here is we've uh as we've talked about
[1:27:54] the city the city now not the wall the
[1:27:57] city was pure gold like unto clear glass
[1:28:04] I I actually have a hard time
[1:28:07] envisioning that now I have items that
[1:28:10] are gone I mean this ring I got is pure
[1:28:12] gold
[1:28:12] uh forgot 14 probably cared but clear
[1:28:15] glass
[1:28:17] pure gold like clear glass
[1:28:20] transparent like you
[1:28:22] can look through it
[1:28:24] that just that's incredible I some of
[1:28:27] these things you just
[1:28:29] pure gold like under clear glass the
[1:28:32] foundations of the wall of the city were
[1:28:34] garnished with all manner of precious
[1:28:36] stones the First Foundation was Jasper's
[1:28:40] second Sapphire third uh
[1:28:43] I haven't looked these up in a while so
[1:28:44] forgive me fourth Emerald fifth uh star
[1:28:49] dunks the Sig sarda seventh crystalite
[1:28:52] eighth barreled Knight topaz 10th uh
[1:28:56] I'm not sure the 11th uh
[1:29:00] a uh John kith the 12th an amethyst now
[1:29:04] I look at that the the lemon and reminds
[1:29:08] me of the Street next to the Tabernacle
[1:29:11] placento yeah it's almost the exact same
[1:29:14] spelling except that the end has an O on
[1:29:17] the Stream
[1:29:18] I always thought that was very
[1:29:20] outstanding unusual especially the way
[1:29:23] that God used brother Brown about
[1:29:25] brother brother Green in his life and
[1:29:28] the 12 gates were 12 pearls uh every
[1:29:32] several gate was of uh was of Pearl and
[1:29:35] the street of the city the street of the
[1:29:37] city now was pure gold and as it were
[1:29:42] transparent glass
[1:29:45] wow that's just that's just incredible
[1:29:47] thing
[1:29:50] and I saw no Temple now this is some of
[1:29:52] what we've gotten into already and I saw
[1:29:54] no Temple therein for the Lord God
[1:29:56] Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of
[1:29:58] it and the city had no need of the sun
[1:30:01] neither of the moon to shine in it for
[1:30:03] the glory of God did lighten it and the
[1:30:06] lamb is the light thereof the nations of
[1:30:09] them which uh which are saved shall walk
[1:30:11] in the light of it and the kings of the
[1:30:14] earth do bring their Glory and Honor
[1:30:16] into it the Kings
[1:30:18] of the earth to bring their Glory into
[1:30:20] it we talked about that the other day
[1:30:22] the gates of it shall not be shut At All
[1:30:25] by day for there shall be no night there
[1:30:28] in other words he's just saying it won't
[1:30:30] be shut
[1:30:32] and they shall bring the glory in honor
[1:30:34] of the Nations into it and there shall
[1:30:37] in no wise enter into it anything that
[1:30:40] defileth neither whatsoever worketh
[1:30:42] Abomination or make it the lie but they
[1:30:46] which are written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:30:48] Life
[1:30:49] the bride yes and he showed me a pure
[1:30:53] now we're getting to the city more he
[1:30:55] showed me a pure River of of Water of
[1:31:00] Life clear as Crystal
[1:31:03] proceeding out of the Lamb of God and of
[1:31:06] the lamb now that's wonderful see to see
[1:31:09] that water that pure River
[1:31:12] uh of of Water of Life clear as Crystal
[1:31:16] coming out of the Throne of God and
[1:31:18] remember where we talked about The
[1:31:20] Throne of this course is in the top
[1:31:22] which it wouldn't make much sense for
[1:31:23] the throne to be at the bottom or the
[1:31:25] water the river to come out of the
[1:31:27] bottom but it comes out of the top and
[1:31:30] runs along down through this city down
[1:31:33] through this mountain amen of this city
[1:31:36] that produces to every
[1:31:39] Palace every dwelling that's along there
[1:31:43] clear as Crystal
[1:31:46] preceding out of the Throne of God and
[1:31:50] of the Lamb
[1:31:52] in the midst of the street of it and on
[1:31:55] either side of the river was there the
[1:31:58] Tree of Life
[1:32:00] amen I'm going to read you something a
[1:32:02] little bit the brother Brown talks about
[1:32:04] this
[1:32:05] was there a tree of life which bear 12
[1:32:08] manner of fruits and yielded her fruit
[1:32:10] every month and the leaves of the tree
[1:32:13] were for the healing of the Nations we
[1:32:17] talked about that the other day
[1:32:19] and Jesus ruling with the rod of iron
[1:32:22] and they come the Kings come to bring in
[1:32:25] the the leaves which were a a symbol of
[1:32:29] peace especially when you think about uh
[1:32:32] uh what was the first thing that the
[1:32:35] that the dove brought back to the ark
[1:32:38] was an olive branch with olive leaves of
[1:32:40] the leaf on it it's it's given in some
[1:32:43] in symbolic form of of of a p of Peace
[1:32:47] amen of a gesture of Peace these leaves
[1:32:51] the tree were for the healing of the
[1:32:54] Nations and there shall be no more curse
[1:32:57] but the Throne of God and of the Lamb
[1:32:59] shall be in it and his servants Shall
[1:33:02] Serve him
[1:33:04] and they shall see his face and his name
[1:33:07] shall be in their foreheads and there
[1:33:09] shall be no night there and they have no
[1:33:12] they need no candle neither light the
[1:33:15] Sun for the Lord God giveth him light
[1:33:17] and they shall reign forever and ever of
[1:33:20] course we talked about that light the
[1:33:21] other day so we to recognize this
[1:33:26] is probably in what human language could
[1:33:30] be brought is
[1:33:32] more beautiful than we could imagine
[1:33:35] uh obviously
[1:33:37] things of this even from what Jesus told
[1:33:40] us in Saint John 14 to what John the
[1:33:43] Revelator is speaking up here that was
[1:33:44] shown to him in Revelation 21 and 22
[1:33:46] just go beyond human comprehension uh so
[1:33:52] the little things that we can Envision
[1:33:55] from this scripture reading helps us get
[1:33:59] an idea of of sort of what it might be
[1:34:01] like look like let me see let me read
[1:34:04] this to you because brother random goes
[1:34:05] in you know
[1:34:07] he was a lot better at dramatizing
[1:34:09] things than I was and and drawing these
[1:34:12] pictures out so let me read this it's
[1:34:14] obviously from future home
[1:34:17] Jesus got to prepare with the Divine
[1:34:20] hands a Divine City
[1:34:23] Divine architect for a Divine boughten
[1:34:27] people that's his bride the Bride of
[1:34:30] Jesus Christ
[1:34:31] for a predestinated people
[1:34:34] he has gone to prepare Abraham was
[1:34:37] looking for it now we've got into this
[1:34:39] before too Abraham was looking for it
[1:34:41] and he professed that he was a pilgrim
[1:34:43] and stranger for he looked for a city
[1:34:46] whose Builder and maker was God that
[1:34:48] Prophet knowing it was somewhere
[1:34:52] that city was somewhere amen he just
[1:34:56] didn't realize it was above him instead
[1:34:59] of in front of him but he did
[1:35:02] spiritually meet that City
[1:35:05] that low cost from the former melchized
[1:35:08] amen knowing it was somewhere John saw
[1:35:11] it just wasn't time for that Revelation
[1:35:13] that was all uh John saw it coming down
[1:35:16] but Abraham thought it must have been on
[1:35:18] Earth right then why because he met
[1:35:20] Melchizedek the king of it
[1:35:23] and gave him tithing
[1:35:25] praise the Lord
[1:35:27] which had no father no mother he had no
[1:35:31] beginning of Life for ending of or
[1:35:32] ending of life Abraham met him and they
[1:35:36] took communion right on the literal spot
[1:35:39] where the city will be raised up
[1:35:41] actually the mountains raised up the
[1:35:43] city comes down
[1:35:45] uh the Holy Mountain of the Lord where
[1:35:48] the redeemed will live praise the Lord
[1:35:51] amen so glad I'm part of that redeem
[1:35:54] that time just uh that time just don't
[1:35:57] stop no uh we're in time after a while
[1:36:02] we go into eternity we've talked about
[1:36:04] that too
[1:36:06] Oh Holy Mountain there will be streets
[1:36:08] of transparent gold
[1:36:12] Avenues houses and Parks
[1:36:15] he says if you want to read this
[1:36:17] Revelation 21 the tree of life will be
[1:36:20] there 12 different manners of fruit one
[1:36:23] each month
[1:36:24] will be born on it the people that eat
[1:36:28] this fruit they'll change their diet
[1:36:30] every month
[1:36:33] and it from and is the Tree of Life
[1:36:37] is only for the Overcomers
[1:36:41] praise the Lord over the Overcomer has
[1:36:44] inherited all things
[1:36:46] praise the Lord the ones outside of the
[1:36:49] city the kings that come in and bring
[1:36:52] their uh offering in for healing they
[1:36:54] are not partakers of that this is only
[1:36:57] for the bride and those on that mountain
[1:36:59] yes the Overcomer praise the Lord
[1:37:01] they'll be the Jews as well Overcomers
[1:37:04] 144 000. uh I would say I have never
[1:37:08] found a place where brother Brandon was
[1:37:10] specific about the Jews on this my
[1:37:13] understanding or thought about would be
[1:37:15] the 144 000 it's got to come from uh
[1:37:18] it's got to come all the way back from
[1:37:19] the Old Testament because God testifies
[1:37:22] of them as he taught as Jesus I didn't
[1:37:26] want to get into this today but is Jesus
[1:37:28] testifies in this of the city as the
[1:37:32] bride adored for her husband
[1:37:34] he talks about the bride the Gentile
[1:37:37] bride but when he describes the walls
[1:37:40] around the city everything about that he
[1:37:43] talks and describes is about the Jews
[1:37:45] amen so this city is not just for
[1:37:48] gentiles
[1:37:49] so understand it is for Jews so
[1:37:53] who of them will be there I believe of
[1:37:56] course it'll be the 144 000 those that
[1:37:58] were in the Millennium
[1:38:00] um it'll have to be Old Testament saints
[1:38:02] that come through so to what degree that
[1:38:07] is I couldn't tell you
[1:38:09] um
[1:38:10] obviously brother Branham was sent to a
[1:38:14] gentile bride not to a Jewish bride so
[1:38:17] uh some of those things that the Jews as
[1:38:19] between them and God right they're saved
[1:38:22] as a people and God takes care of that
[1:38:24] but they will be there as well but now
[1:38:26] he says now this but those outside the
[1:38:29] city because there will be workers there
[1:38:31] will be people living outside the city
[1:38:33] outside the walls of this city amen
[1:38:37] those ones that bring in the least for
[1:38:39] the healing of the Nations but this city
[1:38:41] this tree of life will only be for the
[1:38:45] overcomer only for the Overcomer do you
[1:38:48] know that it isn't for denominations
[1:38:51] you mean to say brother randomly turn to
[1:38:53] Revelation 2 he said just a minute
[1:38:56] uh Revelation 2 7 we find here
[1:38:59] uh whether it's really the truth or not
[1:39:01] reads like this now remember he is not
[1:39:05] talking uh to the Jews only
[1:39:08] this is the church the Gentile Church
[1:39:11] bride he that has an ear let him hear
[1:39:14] what the spirit said to the churches to
[1:39:16] him that overcome it amen amen
[1:39:20] I will give to eat of the tree of life
[1:39:23] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[1:39:25] God
[1:39:26] amen again to the overcomer
[1:39:29] Revelation 3 21 Revelation 21 that we
[1:39:34] just read
[1:39:35] and
[1:39:37] uh and as God described that for us
[1:39:40] Overcomers only that overcome the Beast
[1:39:43] overcome his mark That's Catholicism
[1:39:46] protestantism denominationalism who
[1:39:50] overcome the Beast his Mark the letter
[1:39:52] of his name he'll have a right to the
[1:39:56] Tree of Life to enter in the gates where
[1:39:59] nothing can defile nothing that goes in
[1:40:03] it can defile think of it now just a
[1:40:06] moment now go a little further tree of
[1:40:08] light will be for the Overcomer only the
[1:40:11] leaves
[1:40:12] the leaves will be for the healing of
[1:40:14] the Nations this is the kings that live
[1:40:17] in there outside the city bringing their
[1:40:21] honor in when they bring their honor in
[1:40:24] and Lay It Before the Throne of God just
[1:40:27] like the outside the 11 tribes brought
[1:40:30] in every one of them of the tribes of
[1:40:33] Israel every one of those other 11
[1:40:36] tribes brought into the priesthood the
[1:40:41] tent uh to the 12th the Levites a tenth
[1:40:45] part which was timing
[1:40:48] that he talked about those will bring in
[1:40:51] from the outside of the city in to God
[1:40:55] to the throne of God just like in
[1:40:57] brother Branham just makes a reference
[1:40:59] the way it used to be with the levitical
[1:41:01] priesthood and those other 11 tribes had
[1:41:05] to bring the tenth of theirs to the
[1:41:07] priesthood so that they're always food
[1:41:09] in the storehouse yeah amen that's the
[1:41:12] only way there's food in the storehouse
[1:41:14] praise the Lord
[1:41:18] God we need to store we need food in our
[1:41:20] storehouse
[1:41:24] when they bring their honor into from
[1:41:26] the Blessed land they've received the
[1:41:28] Tree of Life break off a holly leaf tree
[1:41:30] of a tree of life leap they'll they'll
[1:41:33] walk out together there's no more war
[1:41:36] everything is at peace the leaves are a
[1:41:39] memorial for the healing this is what I
[1:41:41] was thinking of trying to get out
[1:41:42] earlier leaves are a memorial for the
[1:41:45] healing of the Nations the same tree not
[1:41:49] like Adam he was there was a tree of
[1:41:51] life in the Garden of Eden that was
[1:41:53] might not be eaten from it had uh before
[1:41:57] it failed the Tree of Life reminded him
[1:41:59] all the time of his youth continually
[1:42:02] going on the Tree of Life there was not
[1:42:05] to be partaken of but uh
[1:42:08] continually reminded him of his youth
[1:42:11] Perpetual youth is the way it was
[1:42:12] supposed to be which it will be as well
[1:42:15] in the in the new city a Perpetual youth
[1:42:18] there won't be as we get there as 19 20
[1:42:21] 21 in the problem of life and and we go
[1:42:23] old from there uh no it's a Perpetual
[1:42:26] life of living in that state that you're
[1:42:29] in
[1:42:31] amen
[1:42:32] same will uh same with all the nations
[1:42:35] the leaves will be for the healing of
[1:42:37] the Nations notice not no sickness now
[1:42:40] you've had the same rice as Adam notice
[1:42:43] the River of Light perhaps many although
[1:42:46] I like this
[1:42:47] many little streams making it up now in
[1:42:50] the Earth
[1:42:51] he talks about the River of Life I'm
[1:42:53] going to close just a few minutes Earth
[1:42:55] uh for I'm going to
[1:42:58] stop this and move on
[1:43:01] I've never seen nothing so quenching as
[1:43:06] to be in the mountains and find as I
[1:43:08] preached the other night that stream
[1:43:09] bubbling up that life-giving Source
[1:43:12] tired and thirsty fall down by a good
[1:43:14] strain I agree with that uh made down uh
[1:43:19] way downward germs can't even go
[1:43:21] hundreds of feet below the surface that
[1:43:24] water bubbling up coming up into life
[1:43:27] Everlasting in that natural life that
[1:43:30] gives such a a
[1:43:33] um a thirst quench amen
[1:43:36] that that gives life to us to those who
[1:43:39] drink it praise the Lord
[1:43:42] brother Graham explains this which I got
[1:43:45] to just a minute ago
[1:43:47] uh he questions and answers brother
[1:43:48] Branham
[1:43:50] who will populate the Earth outside the
[1:43:53] Heavenly City
[1:43:54] obviously we know we've already said
[1:43:57] there will be a population there will be
[1:44:00] people populated outside the walls of
[1:44:03] this city
[1:44:04] this question is brother Ram who are
[1:44:06] those people
[1:44:07] now who will populate the Earth outside
[1:44:11] of the city outside in outside it will
[1:44:14] be the redeemed that will pollute the
[1:44:17] Earth out beside the city but they will
[1:44:20] not be the elected called bride
[1:44:23] so who will these people be he called
[1:44:26] them the redeemed well just like we just
[1:44:28] read uh back when we talked and the uh
[1:44:33] the white Throne judgment those the
[1:44:36] foolish virgins
[1:44:37] that gave their lives
[1:44:40] that God separated as sheep on the right
[1:44:44] hand side they were granted life
[1:44:47] they were granted Redemption but they
[1:44:50] weren't granted rights to what the bride
[1:44:53] is granted to right they weren't
[1:44:56] Overcomers to inherit all things they
[1:44:59] were just given life for the purpose of
[1:45:03] what they did amen because remember they
[1:45:06] all were judged according to their deeds
[1:45:09] and these people remember uh when did we
[1:45:14] do this when you fed me when you clothed
[1:45:16] me when you visited me in prison when
[1:45:18] you did these things see and God and
[1:45:20] those are the foolish virgins they
[1:45:22] stayed virtuous
[1:45:23] they stayed virtuous remember even the
[1:45:26] foolish virgins were virtuous
[1:45:28] they were undefiled yes even though they
[1:45:31] didn't have the Holy Ghost uh New Birth
[1:45:34] they were still virtuous they were still
[1:45:37] Untouched by man's ideas religions they
[1:45:40] were still virtuous
[1:45:41] and they came forth even if they had to
[1:45:44] be purged during the tribulation
[1:45:46] even though they had foolish virgins all
[1:45:48] the way through the uh the church ages
[1:45:50] if they had to do that they still came
[1:45:53] up and God separated them as the sheep
[1:45:55] from the goats on the right hand side
[1:45:58] they were granted life and they are
[1:46:01] given life and they are there they're
[1:46:02] just
[1:46:04] what the bride
[1:46:05] characters of of the holy city so they
[1:46:09] live outside the city yes amen they live
[1:46:12] outside the city outside the walls of
[1:46:15] the city
[1:46:16] they will be the redeemed amen that God
[1:46:20] did redeem based on their deeds that
[1:46:22] will populate the Earth outside the city
[1:46:25] but not the elect called bride
[1:46:28] the bride will live inside the city
[1:46:31] inside the kingdom with the King on the
[1:46:34] outside will be the kings of the earth
[1:46:37] that labor and bring their toil uh he
[1:46:41] said not toils but fruit into the city
[1:46:44] and the Legion for the healing of the
[1:46:46] Nations
[1:46:48] and the doors will not be closed by
[1:46:49] night now this light on top of this
[1:46:51] mountain will not lighten the whole
[1:46:53] world uh I I kind of got into that a
[1:46:57] little bit last week and this really
[1:46:59] isn't the point I wanted to make today
[1:47:00] but I wanted to show you that when
[1:47:02] brother Branham made that statement in
[1:47:05] the future home he does correct it
[1:47:07] because in future home he said this
[1:47:09] light will lighten the horror then I
[1:47:11] tried to explain that a little bit to
[1:47:13] say you know unless there's some
[1:47:15] illumination we don't know of this is
[1:47:18] not going to be able to cover the entire
[1:47:21] Earth
[1:47:22] and brother Graham says that here she
[1:47:24] says now the light on top of the
[1:47:26] mountain will not lighten the whole
[1:47:28] world it'll only lighten the city that
[1:47:31] around the city obviously but it can be
[1:47:34] seen in distance of thousands of miles
[1:47:37] maybe but that still when you're talking
[1:47:40] about the uh
[1:47:42] 8 000 mile Earth from top to bottom uh
[1:47:47] it's not going to lighten the entire
[1:47:49] Earth world
[1:47:51] this ball of dirt it's not going to
[1:47:54] lighten the whole thing
[1:47:56] but it can be seen Thousand Miles maybe
[1:47:58] but it won't lighten the Earth because
[1:48:00] the Bible says in the new world from one
[1:48:02] Sabbath to another from one new moon to
[1:48:05] the other will people come up before the
[1:48:08] Lord unto Zine up to the city to worship
[1:48:10] and now there will uh now they will be
[1:48:13] outside the city not the bride but the
[1:48:16] people that come up in the second
[1:48:17] Resurrection will be killers of the soil
[1:48:21] just like Adam was and so forth career
[1:48:24] uh uh and carers of the garden but the
[1:48:28] king and queen will be in the city
[1:48:31] amen and then in the new city the New
[1:48:34] Jerusalem praise the Lord and now we
[1:48:36] notice
[1:48:37] I'm not going to take this out to draw
[1:48:39] this week because I'm getting ready to
[1:48:40] close we'll start that Lord willing next
[1:48:43] time uh of of the four walls that are
[1:48:46] around the city when I first
[1:48:50] saw this or heard it without Revelation
[1:48:53] but how can there be four walls around a
[1:48:57] pyramid I've always thought of a pyramid
[1:48:59] as three sides but there's also pyramids
[1:49:03] that are four-sided pyramids hence this
[1:49:06] city the mountain that's four-sided in
[1:49:11] the image of a pyramid instead of three
[1:49:14] and when you've got that you've got
[1:49:15] walls that can go all the way around it
[1:49:18] makes more sense then this city will be
[1:49:21] uh uh Mountain will be walled all the
[1:49:25] way around
[1:49:25] the city amen let me read this one more
[1:49:28] thing I'm going to close because I've
[1:49:30] already we've gone into the other things
[1:49:32] that I had I wanted to speak on today so
[1:49:34] you understand there will be the bride
[1:49:36] those Jews that will be in the city the
[1:49:39] Overcomers in the sea and there will be
[1:49:41] workers people outside the city it won't
[1:49:43] just be those that are inside but
[1:49:45] outside and outside the walls of the
[1:49:47] city future home let me read this I'm
[1:49:49] going to close
[1:49:51] he said now
[1:49:53] um just a minute go a little bit for the
[1:49:54] Tree of Life
[1:49:56] the Tree of Life
[1:49:58] uh
[1:50:02] well praise the Lord I already read that
[1:50:04] so we've got that anyway amen another
[1:50:07] thing he talks about leads the Nations
[1:50:08] for the uh for the healing of the
[1:50:11] Nations the Kings bringing in his honors
[1:50:13] Memorial uh uh as a tribute amen from
[1:50:17] the outside to bring to the inside Gates
[1:50:20] will be open
[1:50:21] uh there'll be no shut in the gates
[1:50:23] there'll be no Darkness there'll be no
[1:50:24] night it'll be a time of Water of Life
[1:50:28] the water that runs down through all the
[1:50:30] crevices and place of this city uh the
[1:50:34] gold the transparent gold of water
[1:50:37] crystal clear
[1:50:39] and and that's just
[1:50:42] a part of what this city is going to be
[1:50:45] like and amen just apart
[1:50:49] Tree of Life on both sides all around
[1:50:52] it just kind of starts getting me to
[1:50:56] understand why even as a little boy
[1:50:59] I've always thought about and liked
[1:51:02] mountains
[1:51:04] some of the best times I ever had in my
[1:51:06] life as a kid was going with my friend
[1:51:08] and into the mountains to his
[1:51:10] grandmother who basically lived on the
[1:51:12] side of underneath a rock on the bottom
[1:51:13] side of a mountain
[1:51:15] Creek Running Down Below we'd go play in
[1:51:17] the water and fish for trout and
[1:51:20] just some of the best times I ever had
[1:51:23] in my life was was right there in that
[1:51:25] place I thought how could there be any
[1:51:27] more anything any more peaceful on the
[1:51:29] earth than just out here in the middle
[1:51:31] of nowhere in the Stream and the
[1:51:33] provision that God made and in my heart
[1:51:36] it's always kind of been that way and I
[1:51:37] hear Brother Brown when I grow up
[1:51:39] talking about it and having a cabin down
[1:51:41] by that Creek or as they would call it
[1:51:44] Creek uh back there next to the river
[1:51:48] um
[1:51:49] it's just something that warms the heart
[1:51:51] there's a lot of people that's not
[1:51:53] satisfying for them but it is for me uh
[1:51:57] I I find the simple parts of life when I
[1:52:00] was young was some of the best times of
[1:52:02] my life and then grew up and felt like I
[1:52:04] needed to have the world on my shoulders
[1:52:06] and then you get older and you like it
[1:52:08] just takes right back to the revert to
[1:52:10] the Simplicity of where it was and where
[1:52:12] your heart is it makes me realize God
[1:52:15] gave me that heart because that's where
[1:52:17] I'm going yes that's that's not just the
[1:52:20] beginning of my natural life it's going
[1:52:21] to be in the end in my spiritual life
[1:52:24] yes amen and if I can have a cabin next
[1:52:27] to brother branhams or wherever it is
[1:52:29] doesn't have to be next to him uh I'll
[1:52:32] be happy yes praise the Lord top of the
[1:52:35] mountain bottom of the Mountain Middle
[1:52:37] of the mountain wherever it is I just
[1:52:39] want to be there
[1:52:41] I just want to be there I has not seen
[1:52:44] ears not heard neither in the heart of
[1:52:46] man what God's got in store amen let's
[1:52:49] stand if we could
[1:52:57] praise the Lord
[1:53:02] I wish I could do it justice
[1:53:04] I bet brother Brown I would think I
[1:53:07] would think brother Branham probably
[1:53:08] felt the same way
[1:53:10] I wish you could do it justice
[1:53:12] try to take it from the scripture and
[1:53:15] try to make try to bring it the way it's
[1:53:19] in your heart the way you see it
[1:53:22] the way God reveals it
[1:53:24] is just so hard to do
[1:53:26] amen it's just so hard to do
[1:53:30] amen
[1:53:32] I got a song with my heart I don't even
[1:53:34] know if it's in this book
[1:53:38] um let me see if I can find it real
[1:53:40] quick if not
[1:53:42] it's it's a very simple course uh
[1:53:46] I think Ray Boltz used to sing it
[1:53:49] sit here
[1:53:59] it's got the same title that might not
[1:54:01] be the same song
[1:54:02] about 258.
