right knee uh my left knee starting to get uh a little swollen again it was getting better but now that it's overcompensating for the other side I'm supposed to see PT tomorrow uh I don't know what

miss any work I know workman's comp would probably cover it but I'm just not I don't do that I want to work I don't want to set at home workman's Cal so uh I will do what the doctor recommends and tells me though I'm not going to be stupid uh but I really want it to just be something simple something I don't know what I not really at this point don't know what they would do what they can do um I've been icing it and I I can't get this all the swelling gone off the right knee I did pretty good with the left but I just cannot get all the swelling off the right knee and and uh you know

absolutely amen I have been very [Music] um there's been people that have really suffered from the covid vaccine and from um and long Co and um and I just kind of let it slide and one of the reasons I let it slide is because I don't have a a doctor's degree behind me I can so I was just kind of discouraged I just kind of stopped people and and my friend Dominic is out there talking to people so in this discouragement all of a sudden um I was I was doing something online and I don't remember what and all of a sudden it just popped up all the research and everything in one place and so and I I just thank God because it was just so Tim and so you know and he's done that all my life and I and I just thank God for that amen because it's not for me it's for other people that loves you so much yes he does this for you and he just he just gives these things to me miraculously it just swadles me God is good amen he's mindful of us all praise the Lord so thankful every situation every circumstance I want to give the Lord Praise Kath able to eat she been able to eat right for came she eating meat and good amen wonderful all pra praise the Lord amen Miracles going all all around us and just open our eyes amen praise the Lord amen let's stand to our feet then amen we'll just go to the scripture this should be uh far as I can see now uh as far as the Lord has took it to uh this this study we've been on God in simplicity so we're going over to Matthew chap 11 1 verse verse 25 amen this is God in Simplicity part 16 Bride versus Church part seven amen so Lord willing far as I know now this will be the last part of this as the Lord adds on to something course Easter's next Sunday uh so but as far as I know we'll see whatever the Lord does of course kind of just falls under the umbrella of of a of a specific title I put to it but really almost all the messages have been uh different so uh but whatever the Lord's will that's what we want amen before we read the word can we just bow our heads another word of prayer Lord Jesus we're so very thankful again God your grace your love your mercy the blessings you give the Miracles you perform who you are to us Lord and the truth that we have in our hearts and know God that you are more than faithful Lord because you you've never failed us you cannot fail us it is impossible to fail us Lord and God we ourselves are so thankful to you God we want to let you know how preached we are the testimonies that's been said today Lord and God just know that you are here once again this morning to do the exceeding abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think believing that you're still the same yesterday today and forever Lord we know God that this word will not return void accomplish it in there what you'd have sent it forth for and Lord may your Holy Spirit God brood over this place through and in us God moving in and out the Avenues of our heart Lord fill all this place where we're sitting today God and let it be God as it was on the day of Pentecost in that upper room that you move in a supernatural way to touch each one of us and bring strength and healing and blessing and and touch us oh God we are in need of you now more than ever Lord this world it's when I was younger Lord it just I didn't pay much attention to it but you could tell it was getting worse yes but Lord now it seems like every not almost every day it's almost every hour now that things are just getting worse and worse Lord and I say that based on the fact of your word Lord getting worse based on your word getting further and further from you uh God but Lord help us when all of what's going on around us is getting further away from you Lord help us to continue to draw closer to you lord lord I rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way or anyone here God may your Holy Spirit come with that Shield God and bring that strength and blessing that you are to us we commit ourselves to you now the remaining part of this service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen Matthew 11:25 at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has reveal them unto babes you can be seated if you'd like amen I want to continue on the same theme we have last week if you will um speaking about the actually more or less the closeness of of what we know that it would be so close to deceive the very elect yes we l we looked into U uh the life of balum a little bit which will continue on just a little bit here and what happened with the children of Israel recognizing that the same thing that the devil continues to do to try to trip up God's children at every chance he gets found out how balam's teachings uh it was the teachings of balam's that was wrong but there was also inside those teachings that led uh the children of isra Israel astray was also a truth when bam came to him and said we all the same people theoretically he was correct they were all of the same family we looked up the lineage found out the the the idolatry of Moab with Bel peor was in obviously in relation to in the line of Abra abam amen with lot being his nephew and then Moab is lot's son so you can see how close that can be how close many times it is you know Satan came to Jesus one day and tried to deceive Jesus and oddly enough uh we we all know how cunning and clever the devil is but we can also look at the scripture realize how stupid he is too right because why would the devil try to come to the word and try to defeat the word with the word right well he does the same thing to us yes the brides becoming the word and he tries to defeat us the same way he tries to defeat that that he has defeated the church world and that is with the word the sword we read that in one of the beginning parts of this whole series over in chapter 6 we found out he was given the great sword he went forth to kill with that sword and that's exactly what happened it's not a physical sword of a physical killing anymore but it's a spiritual sword they take Satan has taken the word to make it look just like the real but he's interjected man's opinions and man's ideas and dogmas and denominations and churches and and all this has been come up for all these years but he tried to do the exact same thing to Jesus he came to the word Jesus Christ and he said it is written really that's going to be the bullet you're putting in your gun for today it is written you're going to try you're actually going to try to deceive Jesus with the word amen amen but Jesus came back and said it is also written amen the word in its proper place correcting the misplacement of the word by the devil right and he does the exact same thing today a lot of people think well it's okay it's the word but remember brother Adam said you can't mislocate misinterpret misplace so on and so forth the word me because that makes it just as hybrid as anything else right as a man's idea of it or a man's opinion or a man's interpretation of if you take it and misplace it is just as wrong as if you misquoted it completely to put it out of its place makes it not as not effective just like anything else would be amen and that's that's still the same tactics of the devil but that's exactly what we show to saw through balam's teachings he said well he was so wrong but it's just like it was in the Garden of Eden it was so wrong what happened in the garden of beeden but what it was was 99% true right what bam was teaching here fundamentally was true they were family but they but they he took that to misplace it in a place to call us one in into a place of idolatry a a a a spiritual fornication and that God does not tolerate amen because all that does is leads you away from God yes and as the churches uh may be in the in the world grow bigger have more Authority have more money have greater crowds the bride seems to be shrinking a little at a time with every saint that passes away it seems like it just gets smaller and smaller yes make it sure doesn't make you realize that brother bandam said that just if there's one and two some make sure you're that one amen praise the Lord it's going to be just a small group right amen I believe there's going to be more than one so don't get me wrong and like people got him wrong uh but he said if it were to be that way just make sure you are that one praise the Lord that's the main thing about it but that deception and that's exactly what it is that deception I want to I want to continue on the the that thought let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter 6 2 Corinthians chapter 6 just read a few verses of scripture we'll start with the 14th verse 2 Corinthians 6:14 it says be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness yes and what communion hath light with Darkness yes you know what has zero uh when God created light Darkness dissipated amen because God is light so the greater uh element here is light not Darkness I know it looks in the world like the greatest element is Darkness but it is not the greatest element is light when the light comes the darkness has to go one does not have cannot have Concourse with the other it cannot praise the Lord look now and what Concord had Christ with Bilo now Bilo is just worthless uh uh uh Antichrist another word of the devil if you will Satan what so would you say what what Concord What relation would Christ have with the devil right amen or or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel or an unbeliever amen you say well what what would you have in common now now this isn't to say that you couldn't have someone that's a friend that doesn't believe this messeng or the way you do I'm not talking about that I'm talking about The Concourse together the relation amen uh an acquaintance or something I I don't know that you could really but see I I I put the category of friend in a whole different category than a lot of people do right uh a lot of a lot of people will say because a somebody clicked on a button on a social media platform that that person's their friend excuse me they are not a friend uh a friend is someone who is uh someone like any other to you that is a bond that is unbreakable that is uh uh thick and thin if you will uh Jesus said Stith closer than a brother amen that's a friend a lot of people say I got friends um you know to me those are acquaintances you might have a lot of acquaintances people that you know people that you might have some time with but this is to me talking about The Concourse of togetherness of relationship of of serious deep relationship amen uh what has what has the the believer to do with the unbeliever in that category can't have it right it just can't be what agreement had the temple of God with Idols amen the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people praise the Lord so what would this Temple what would this Temple have to do with Idols I don't worship any but one that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen he is my God he is my Lord he is my savior he is my everything this Temple has no relation with Idols with with with the other things that would take me away from him amen um I I still have my my manager at work still tries to pull on me to become a manager of a team manager I'm like if I felt like that it would not interfere with what I what we have or do here then uh I might consider it but that's not it this that's that's my secondary job this is my primary amen and now always look at it that way God is always first regardless period always first always going to be first amen amen and that's the way it should be yes amen I will walk with them they shall be my my God uh I will be their God they should be my people amen wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate sayeth the Lord and tou touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you praise the Lord just like we talked about last couple of services with Revelation 18 come out of her my people and be not partaker of her sin Corinthians Paul to the Corinthians come out from among them out out from among who well Paul named some of them not right here but on down uh Paul's named several of them along the way if you read the scripture you see where he tells that this person teaches wrong this person is uh wrong in their Doctrine this person doesn't teach the scripture right and so he said don't don't believe what so and so are teaching you amen he calls them in many places he calls them out by name but he's telling them to come out from among them and be separate from that be separate from the bals be separate from the bpor be separate from the teaching of balum be separate from the denomination be separate from that that church that denomination that Dogma that doctrine that man-made idea come out from that and be separate from that and don't be a partaker of that unclean thing and I will receive you amen praise God yes that's Matthew 10 if I ever or 25 i' ever seen it God God saying come out and don't partake of that and I will receive you don't take of their Doctrine don't take of their Dogma don't take of that spiritual adultery and I will receive you to myself yes praise the Lord and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters sayeth the Lord God Almighty God's word God's word friend calls for a total separation ation from unbelief yes total separation from unbelief again I'm not telling you if you've got an acquaintance or someone that's a friend that's a non-believer how are that how is that person going to get witnessed to if maybe the Lord's put you there to do it right amen I'm on a whole teen full of infidels if you will but I try to witness to those guys every week I got the new guy now he's talking about quitting smoking amen he's the only guy on our team one guy's already quit drinking and uh I think he started drinking wine again but he but he does it like in moderation if you will and his has a glass at night or something in his room whatever but a new guy he Smoke Drink Gamble and stuff and you just step at a time whatever the Lord's will amen uh that's up to God if it were up to me I'd I'd wipe it all way and make make well I would everybody really and make everybody a Believer but can't do that that cuz it's free moral agency amen they they choose to do what they want to do we choose to do what we want we choose to live the way we want to live that's why it's not legalism that's why the way we live and how we act and what we do and conduct ourselves is not legalism because we choose to do that we want to do it legalism forces you into doing something that uh maybe is against what you want to do well I'll just do it to conform no we don't conform we transform yes amen we become new creatures in Christ Jesus and then by our own free will we live the way we want to live simply because that's what we want to do right amen amen praise the lord it's like I think I told y'all um uh one time with our with our group we had a a what they call team building activity and uh we bowled a little bit and we played a couple arcade games and we went in and and was throwing these axe I'd never done that before uh throw axes at Targets I guess I'm sure we have that here in town somewhere uh throwing actually a literal axe at a at a at a wooden board and you know uh I was I was hitting the bullseye and one of the one of the guys come around said man is there nothing newon can't do and the other guy said yeah he can't cuss I said yeah I can I just choose not to right I don't want to not in my DNA could I do it sure I could I don't want to amen I live this way because I want to live this way not CU I'm forced to not because I think the fer Finger of God is going to command me to hell if I say a cuss word no that's nothing to do with that amen I don't do it out of fear I do it out of love yes amen live the way I live because I love him and that's it but God's word now God's word calls for total separation from all unbelief total separation be not partaker of that sin amen that's why that we are to search the scriptures for in them others think they have eternal life but we search the scripture to make sure look now I I believe the prophet I believe that message I haven't found anything outside of little things that like brother one time he said this 1964 and was 1965 I mean silly stuff like that I haven't found anything in that message that I've disagreed with according to the scripture not according to my opinion but according to the scripture I haven't found anything that I've disagreed with or saw that was wrong yes amen I have not but we still search the scripture to make sure cuz it's not brother bram's Soul that's on the line it's yours yes it's mine you do that same thing for in in when you come here with me you search the scripture amen I'm going to have you when you go home today read a read a chapter today or this week sometime amen of something that we're going to talk about but I want you to go home and read I'm not going to read the whole chapter here but I want you go home and read it it's probably a little inappropriate for younger children anyway but uh Gman Reed because it tells about the wickedness I mean really the depth of the wicked of where Israel had gotten to yes amen now but that unbelief we are to be separated from all unbelief yes amen come out from among her and what is that again come out from that teaching come out from that Doctrine come out from that Dogma amen it's not talking about being a a buddy with somebody that you go play golf with or go shooting with or or something like that has nothing to do with that amen but don't be partaker of that of that unbelief of that spiritual it's a spiritual warfare I've said this over and over friends but I want to make sure you get it down it's not the physical it's the spiritual warfare we're talking about amen it's that spiritual adultery that will send you to Hell amen I had found well let's just move on let's go to judges now Judges chapter 2 Judges chapter 2 I want to read a couple of scriptures in two and three to go back and reiterate the thing that got Israel in the most trouble with God to the point of unforgiveness now remember in the New Testament in Hebrews there is a line you can cross of an unpardonable sin we do know that right amen uh people get in themselves messed up with that thought of did or didn't but there is a way there is a place in the in the New Testament in the scripture that you can cross that line to the UN there is an unpardonable sin amen Yes again that unpardonable sin doesn't have anything to do with physical activities right it does not there's no no place in the scripture amen that you you say a cuss word and you're and you're eternally doomed no uh not we don't we don't talk like that and we know we don't amen but it doesn't mean that something slips or whatever that you're just eternally doomed no no it's not that's not an unpardonable sin yes amen but there is an unpardonable sin that's a whole another subject but with Israel they crossed that line right of unpardonable sin what was it with Israel we're going to show once again spiritual adultery yes amen spiritual adultery while we're at it why don't I give you of course I may have already done this with you before but I'll give you another homework assignment go home and Listen to Invisible Union amen it'll tie right into to this that brother Brand's talking about putting that devil your first he called the devil your first husband you know that yeah don't go listen to it he called it he called him your first husband and that that marriage has to be completely nullified yes and done away with and destroyed and put into the sear forgetfulness praise God Amen can't hang on to the devil a little bit and try to and try to marry to Jesus Christ it doesn't work that way oh I'm a Christian but you know I like amen look now this is the thing that God separated himself from Israel about thank God He sent Jesus Christ or they would have none of them been saved or uh been able to make it thank God that the blood of Jesus Christ not only cleansed us from our sin but it reached all the way back as far as Adam and as far out as the last human that'll ever live it'll cover a wide span sa amen because there won't be one person that would not have the ability opportunity to that precious blood but Judges chapter 2 ver8 and Joshua the son of nun the servant of the Lord died being 110 years old they buried him in the border of his inheritance in h Timnath heris in the Mount of Ephraim on the north side of the Hill gash and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet The Works which he had done for Israel now there becomes the thing that that's the responsibility of us as we sit here as Grandparents maybe even great grandparents uh grandparents as parents we make sure we make sure as God Almighty has given us what we need and what he has revealed to us and through this word and through the new birth that we share that with our children we don't just share it with them and pardon this phrase but I'm going to say it this way we indoctrinate them with what we know is the truth of the word amen schools try to indoctrinate them uh the government tries to indoctrinate them in fact they're trying to steal them away from the parents today but we are to we the we are the ones responsible for our children amen we are the ones to teach them to show them to help them understand this is the right way this is the truth this is how we live this is why we live we have had so many times uh taba especially being a girl uh why she had long hair why she wear dresses and this and that and the other and they always ask and and they always expected the answer oh it's my religion I said don't you dare ever tell anybody it's your religion it's not your religion you do it because the Bible asks us to do it and we want to live the way the Bible ask us to live what God asks that's what we want to do amen don't ever say It's My Religion it's not a religion I had the conversation with the guys telling you talking about quitting smoking now I had the conversation with him he said oh I'm not a really religious guy I said I'm not either I hope there's not a religious bone in my body I don't want one religious cell molecule in my body I don't want anything to do with religion yes I want Jesus Christ amen people use religion as a covering oh I go to so and so's Church I I do this so I'm going to make it I'm this I I my my family for six Generations has belong to this Baptist Church and I if they went it was good enough for them I'm going that's just religion yeah that's just a covering that's just something to try to make excuse for you being able to smoke drink Gamble and live some ungodly life and think you're going to go to heaven doesn't work that way right amen doesn't work that way oh praise the Lord all generations ations that were gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord we teach that generation if there's another generation God have mercy if there's another generation that comes up after this one you teach them right if my grandson has children my granddaughter has children they teach their children what their parents taught them and what we taught them amen what I was taught praise the lord we teach them they teach them each generation so this is not lost that this doesn't go away each one remembers amen remembers but there was a generation that knew not the Lord nor yet The Works which he had done for Israel and the children of Israel 11th verse now children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and served Baum and see that's just it that's how the little things they C they fall off oh I think you know well mom and dad taught me but I think it's okay so but why did Mom and Dad teach you that if it wasn't right amen what does the scripture say remember always take it back to the word don't take somebody's opinion about it don't listen to some tape or some book or some uh TV show or something and take their opinion for it especially if they don't believe the truth of the word for this hour especially if there's some trinitarian you want to take their word for the scripture they don't even know that there's only one God they're already committing idolatry by saying there's three Gods right and you want to listen to that my anyway I'll I'll move on the children did evil in the sight of the Lord and they served ba them oh it's okay if we do this it' be okay if we believed it this way it be okay if we served it and oh my come on friends that's that's the thing that God looked at that he hated that's the thing that God looked at that he separated himself from them that he divorced them that he put them away amen and they for 12 verse and they forsook the Lord God of their fathers which brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods of the Gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoke the Lord to anger that' be the same equivalent of the mark of the beast right they rece received it they received it so much that they went up to this Idol or whatever it was and bow down to it yeah and worship they received it so much to themselves they were willing to prostrate themselves before it you know brother Randon went to see the pope one day he said we got to do this cut the cff out your pants all this pump and Circumstance stuff to be able to go into to see the pope he said now make sure now you got everything prepared you're ready okay make sure now when you go into to his imminence that you bow down to him and kiss his ring he said no that's out he that that man will not get the pleasure of my presence brother B didn't say that but that's what I'm saying that Pope will not get the pleasure of my presence if I got a bound out I'm not I bound out to no one but Jesus Christ amen amen Mercy but that's exactly people do it by the thousands by the millions by the millions bow down to and worship these other gods they bowed themselves the children of God bowed themselves and they provoked the Lord to anger and they forsook the Lord and served Baal and ASO which we already know that Baal was a pagan God worshiped as a pagan God but astroth was was a female version of that Pagan God it was a they called a a a goddess amen this was a female version so I know it's supposed to be woman's month in this country but they made sure that there was no e uh uh inequality here they they bowed down to the male God and they bow down to the female god equally they make sure you're going to worship these Gods Idols Stone metal gold whatever they are everything that the almighty God created they built and made other gods out of them but they had a male they had a male and a female amen let's go over now to Judges chapter 3 continue reading on this because this will help us am God's merciful god was even merciful then even though the blood of Jesus Christ had not been shed at that point God was still a merciful god god still gave them a chance if they were willing to turn from their wicked way and receive him back again and eradicate the evil God would receive them back again yes and it was like that until it reached that place of complete spiritual adultery amen but now Judges chapter 3 verse 5 and the children of Israel uh dwelt among the Canaanites Hittites amorites parasites uh that that sounds kind of bad Like A Parasite it probably was uh perizzites hites jebusites uh and they took their daughters to be their wives and gave their and gave their daughters to their sons and serve their gods oh we're just one again going back to that same thought process we're just all one we're just all mixing together we'll just all be the same you know the Catholic Church used to uh used to be a church where they didn't allow or they would not sanction a marriage of a Catholic to a non-catholic they were that strict and good for them I I don't think that's true anymore but it used to be used to be they would would not allow women preachers uh even though I still think there there's some in the organization cuz this current pope is like well we're not going to sanction them but just like gay marriage oh we don't sanction it but it's just like the same thing here oh well we're not going to sanction that but you know they're just people you know just just like we are it's okay but it used to be that they wouldn't do that would absolutely Catholic Church would would not sanction if they were not Catholic you could not marry them that's the way they felt about it now again I don't think that's true anymore because of the recognition of what happens amen getting un getting unequally like that usually causes one to sway over to the other and usually the the the one that sways over to the other is probably the one that's the least sticky to the flesh it's the path of least resistance which we all as humans seem to enjoy the path of least resistance we like to go the easier path if at all possible so to make it right and to make it easy we just conform over to the wicked way of the one that wasn't Godly right don't be unequally Yol amen that's why it says that yes it's the same thing they did it here in Israel the same thing took their daughters to be their wives gave their daughters to their sons and they served their gods they didn't serve the god they sered their God right and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and forgot the Lord their God and served balum and the Groves and the Groves now they got all these trees and these uh things that they set up as for for uh worship of all of of foreign gods and idolatry and and and spiritual adultery they got they they've got these Groves that set up as as high places as as worship to these people as worship to these gods and they worship balum amen worship balam worship His ideas and they served balum and and and sered these gods in these high places that they set up as places of worship to these to these gods they called them oh and they and the children of Israel served them they married into these families and said oh okay well we'll just go and do this then oh this seems easier than this oh the the my family they had all these rules and regulations and they had all these things we had to follow and all these things we had to do and all these holy days and new moons we had all these things he had dud this is so much easier why would why would we choose to do all of those uh regulations and things and we can just do this it's so much easier and the same thought is today people always want to take the path of least resistance amen and a lot of people do but it's not what God does it's who he is it's what we believe who he is amen because who he is manifest that's what he does praise the Lord and they serve now the children of Israel serve God and the gr you say now why why did God just not take bam out of the picture bam you're not doing when I told you bam you're not prophesying your prophecies are right but you're teaching you're you're teaching the children of uh the teaching the children of Israel into idolatry and just take B them off the Earth why because they had a choice right God wants us to choose him of our own free will yes God doesn't want there not to be another choice you understand that God wants there to be another Choice God wants that to be like that so we choose him over that yes amen that we choose the truth that we choose the message that we choose the correctness of the word over the idolatry yes over the falseness over the man-made ideas over the dogmas they exist because of the contradiction between the two but God wants us to serve him of our own free will not because we're forced to do it right if there's only one choice then there's no choice yeah amen just like people say well I'm not going to choose well that's a choice when you say I'm not going to choose you're making a choice yes because we're free moral agents yes it's inherent in us it's what God is how God made us and God wants us to so God wasn't going to wipe balam away because Israel had a choice you can go with bam or you can serve me amen remember what Joshua said too as as a as for me in my house we will serve the Lord praise God Amen now bam and the gr therefore the angle of the Lord was hot against Israel and the and he sold them into the hand of kusan ram king of Mesopotamia and the children of Israel served kushan R uh RAM eight years eight years and when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord the Lord raised up a deliverer now you got you got people that are crying out because there's all there's there's that group that's there that cries out to God and seeing this think about Jeremiah m i i I've got to admit I am glad God did make me Jeremiah now Jeremiah obviously had God's anointing on him to do what he did but could you imagine being Jeremiah I imagine every time Jeremiah came in some in the people people's company say oh my goodness here he comes again what evil is he got to say for us today can that man not think of one thing positive to tell us today well he would if you would do something good yes he's only doing that by God's instruction because your lives are so wicked and evil yeah if you quit being wicked and evil maybe he could have something good to say yeah but for his whole life basically poor Jeremiah the weeping prophet day after day after day after day because he was trying to get them God's mercy trying to get them back where they're supposed to be back right with him and see now there's these people that see the sin and they're crying out to God and God delivers them and then here comes another group they go right back out and then they cry out to God again and over and over became kind of a circle perpetual thing the thing here now is that the exclamation we'll get to it in a minute was to remember the teaching of balum remember the ways of balum not to follow them right because we know by the scripture that balam's way is the wrong way now look going kind of along with this theme brother brandom says in the Christan mystery of God revealed now noticing and bringing that back in letting that man do that and knowing what he would do know he would do it but what did it do it displayed Jesus's attribute as a savior he allowed humans to do to go the way they went yes the Savior came yes what kind of an attribute of Savior would have been displayed if nobody was lost right again if there's only one choice there's no choice if there's only one way there's there's no way it just is right if if there's nobody lost what's the point of needing to be saved right amen so that's why he said that's why he displayed Jesus the ATT one of the attributes of Jesus as Savior amen and the whole purpose then is left in Jesus Christ God himself to take the penalty of his own law death to die to redeem the wife that was lost by rejecting him to redeem the wife that was lost or put away for rejecting him right praise God he came himself yes to shed his blood to annihilate that sin to bring them into the fold that's why God said I could never forgive never forget Israel they're his children they're his people always been his servants always been always will be amen look now they were lost by rejecting him now when Eve when Eve went away from the word she went away from her mate and when the church goes away from the word the church goes away from the word to a denomination she rejects and commits fornications with the world of man's Wisdom rejecting the authority of God's word amen amen and he says now does that sound clear he said that does that sound clear when she went away from the word she went away from her mate when the church goes away from the word to a denomination she's rejecting her mate and committing fornication with the uh by reject with man's Wisdom rejecting the authority of God's word does that sound he said the Bible said committing spiritual fornication any word in the Bible That's rejected or if any self-interpretation is put to it it is absolutely rejecting and committing adultery against the god that is your husband yes that is pretty plain and clear Saints God help us yes any word any interpretation outside of the pure unadulterated word of God is rejecting and committing adultery against God who you claim to be as your husband and an and an adulterous never enters the kingdom of heaven right we know that that's what he done at the first place then I say as his Spirit calls to you why did walls you Hypocrites calling yourself something when you take the intellectual conception of man and leave the word to go to instead of coming pregnated with the seed word of God in you you've taken every other hybrid no wonder she sets Revelation 17 as a because she's committed spiritual fornication I know those are strong words amen but that's the scriptural truth Saints yes we know that's the scriptural truth taking every other hybrid word no wonder she sets there committing spiritual fornication teaching the people the things of man and not the things of God but he said the Bible says fear not little flock yes it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom hallelujah praise the Lord God has given us that truth that word now I want to go to Hosea uh Hosea chapter 9 I'll close here in a few minutes so amen notice again children of Israel committed fornication not by the prophecy of balam but by his teachings amen not his prophecies but his teachings his teachings is what what led them astray his teachings is what they obeyed that caused them to commit fornication against God's word Hosea 9 uh verse 7 now as for samariah samariah her King is cut off as the foam up upon the Water the high place also of aen wait a minute I'm in the wrong place that's not reading right for me uh sorry that was 10 nine Hosea 9 I knew that didn't read right look here now the days of visitation are come the days of recompense are come Israel shall know it the prophet is a fool the spiritual man is mad for the multitude of thine iniquities and the great hatred The Watchman of Ephraim which was my God but the prophet is a snare of a Fowler in all his ways and hatred in the house of his is God that that's nothing good sad situation Saints yeah let's just put it that way they have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of gibba therefore he will remember their iniquity he will visit their sins now that's where I want you you want to write it down remember read this week if you could Judges chapter 19 it tells us about what the days of gibo was about amen judges 19 I did not want to read the whole chapter to us here today amen it's very brutal it's very graphic it kind of goes in some parts back even to when uh the angels went down to Sodom to deliver lot and his family out and the guy the men came and how they did uh it's along those lines but even worse uh very very I consider very gruesome the days of Gideon but it was the point that was being made the evil the wickedness that had entered into Israel man if that and if it was like that then with them what do you think it is with this that we call ourselves a Christian Nation right and where we've gone and what we've gotten to amen uh it it it's a disgrace it's absolutely forgive me is a disgusting disgrace of what the country has gotten to what the common person out has has considered to be acceptable and okay it is a is a sad I saw yesterday a report about a about an 18-year-old kid a boy who considered himself a girl and he goes and he murders a 12-year-old girl killed her he's been I think he got sentenced I'm I'm not sure but I just saw the headline uh and and even the headline call him her I mean I don't then they I I'm not a pronoun guy I'm not politically correct you all know that they may put me in jail for that one day I don't know I don't care but because God is still my God either way but but it's just sad to what it's what what the what this world what this country's come to and I think this is probably one of the better ones still left when I hear about stuff in France and and and we have a a a woman that comes my wife picks up the airport from London and the things that happen and acceptable and stuff that's over there it's even worse than here right I think my how could it be I don't know how it could get worse and then the next day I pick up the paper or or on my phone W do papers anymore and it's worse right go to bed how could it get worse wake up the next day look at the it's worse it's sad but it's the truth and you think if God did this here again judges 19 what would it be to this what what is God going to do to this nation that we call we call ourselves we have ever since its Inception as a Christian Nation it was born as a Christian Nation probably a more Christian Nation than it is anything else but look what we've got through Saint my mind help us Lord they have deeply let me read this ninth verse again they have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of giba therefore he will remember their iniquity he will visit their sins I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness a't that beautiful I saw their fathers as the first strip in the Fig Tree at her her first time I imagine that was those figs are awful sweet good to eat amen but they went to but they went to B peor and separated themselves unto that shame and their Abominations were according as they what as they loved M that's why I said friend I don't do this because I have to I don't live this way because I have to I I do this because I love the Lord amen I do it because I believe that's his word I believe that's what his command is to me and how and how we should conduct ourselves in his presence what can we do to be pleasing to the Lord amen amen that's what we if we're really Christians that's what we want to do amen out of love not out of fear but out of love praise the Lord they did this because it was what they loved to do amen they're that doctrine that teaching do not be partaker of her sin I'm G read one more scripture Revelation [Music] two this was such a horrible Dogma a horrible idolatry that God makes sure and mentions it way over in the Book of Revelation Revelation chapter 2 [Music] uh verse 14 and 15 reading to the pergamus church age amen the pergamus church age remember it had gone from uh Ephesus to sman remember sman was anointed for death uh remember uh Ephesus had left their first love uh smia was anointed for death and now we that pergamus is getting darker and darker as each each age goes by is getting darker and darker until it gets into the pergamus church age and now God says this but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of bam God remembered it all the way in the New Testament and that was that was at approximately it was a little uh uh uh in smia because that was the one anointed for death that they started the Catholic church that they had the meeting in niia Rome in pergamus was a reflection of what had happened in uh in smia that that nican system had taken over and as it moved into the pergan church age this was God's uh exhortation to the pergan church age I have a few things because you have them there that hold the doctrine of balum Amen exact same thing where did it come from the birth of that the birth of that church the separation of what bride was to church those that that accepted and believed and took on the doctrine that was of niia Roma that started the Catholic Church Catholics Catholic Church says Peter was their first pope well if that's the truth then I'm a Catholic because I believe everything Peter said in fact if Peter was their first pope they should be baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that's exactly what their first pope did amen but they don't do it amen claim what they want but it didn't start here till 320 ad and in the pergant church age God remembers so far back to balam to bring them back that remembrance the the doctors the thing that I have against you is there are those there that hold the doctrine of phum the doctrine of balum not the prophecy the doctrine of balum who taught baac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and commit fornication so so hast thou now also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate notice right there are not very many things in the scripture you go back and look there are not very many things in the scripture I won't call exactly because uh I I've read it through obviously but to look exactly every single time that God said he hated something is extremely limited but this is one of the things that I think God says two or three times here that he hates actually hates hat the doctrine of the nicians hates it amen we don't belong to man we belong to God right praise the Lord every one of us we belong to God the bride's relationship with Jesus Christ with God is by the word yes our relationship is through the word yes we are led by the spirit amen the spirit leads us to the word the word is Christ we are one with him yes let me read this one more quote I'll close here that gets pretty strong at the end I think we know we I don't think it's going to be anything we don't know but trying to do God a service without it being his will this was November 65 so this was just weeks before brother Brown passed away now when I speak to denominations I'm not meaning for you to be so cruel now I don't mean for you not to go to your church now see brother random is trying to tell these people see he's in life he's at Life Tabernacle jackm Church he's not at Bram Tabernacle it's another man's pull Pit Brother Ram was very respectful very respectful of another man's pull pit yeah as well he should be I've always tried to myself uh to be respectful not teach Doctrine he of course this this Thanksgiving meetings he had he preached a lot of Doctrine because invisible Union actually is a part of this uh this series as well that at Thanksgiving meetings at jackm church in threport was the that that message came out of that group as well this is trying to do God's service without being his will is still the same so he's trying to tell these people look it's and we've heard him say it so many times it's not the people there's good people every everywhere friend there's there's incredibly good Catholics Baptists methodists Pentecostal charismatics there's good people everywhere Saints I I told you before I we've had groups of Baptists in North Carolina that baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's good people everywhere it's not that it's the system right it's this system that Revelation 17 was against it's the system that Revelation 18 is crying as the voice of God as brother R said come out of her it's that system am come out 2 Corinthians 6 we read today come out of her don't be unequally yolked it's that system amen not an individual person but the system it's like we said the Beast a lot of people say the an that the Antichrist is the pope that's the office the Beast it's the office it's the spirit amen people humans get caught up in that but it's a system a system is ran organized orchestrated ran by the devil every bit of it and you see why that's why brother Bram says what he's getting ready to say when I finish this quote he said now go to your church what you're supposed to do just don't join up with them organizations because one day and I'm telling you to prove it by the scripture that those organizations that denomination we are an organization but denomination is the mark of the beast amen come out that's why it says come out do not be partakers of that sin do not be partaker of that organization of that denomination he said go to your church but don't you join up with them amen I've told you many times my family we were dying the wool Baptist generation to generation to generation going all the way back to when this country was founded in 1700s I got a book to show it uh John Smith was a part of my family somehow I don't remember anyway people that came on the Mayflower so generation to generation to generation to generation but it's an organization it's a denomination and there's tons and tons my family a part of them good people he just said don't join up with them right my our names were on the book my personal name George new Bennett III was on the name of a book roll in the at at the Sunset Road Baptist Church in Charlotte North Carolina from the time I was born till probably eight years old when I have told y all the story before and all the thing the preacher got up my dad said that's the last last time I'll go and hear how high my my mailbox is supposed to be in church and we came and I I'll never forget that sitting in the back seat of the car Chrysler blue Chrysler 300 I don't know why I remember this stuff I get guys in my guys that I work with say how do you remember all that I don't know it just it just does I don't know coming home the back see the car I know my dad said I'll be the it's the last time I'm going to church next thing I know my dad's writing a letter I got it in here I got the letter in here where my dad said you take our name off of your books we never been on the book Ro book of a denomination ever again amen because I got my name on a r and it was written before the foundation of the world that's the only book I want my name on Amen and it doesn't say George Newton Bennett III I don't know what it says but it identifies who I am and that's all I care about right right praise the Lord we've come out and not be partaker of that thing that he that brother Bram talked about with the spiritual the spiritual adultery not to take the doctrine the Dogma does does everybody do that no does does everybody in the message churches preach pure word probably not I don't know is anybody in the denominations preach uh Truth uh out of the message I've been in a charismatic pastor's church study before and he had all kind of brother Brown books in there amen I've gone and preached for them you stand there and preach over people that the house I grew up in had less paint than some of those women I don't mean that I I don't mean that's the same it's just true hair short the M sweatpants whatever you know all all the whole thing going back to the man stat got a thing full of brother random books but the God but the point [Music] is trying to reach these people somehow it's not my concern whether this man sees the truth as we know it in the message or not that's between him and God but if if someone can preach the gospel truth to someone who doesn't know it God bless them God help them give them the truth to preach that pure and adulterated word to the one that has gone astray and if you preach to a million and only save one You' you've gotten a soul where 10 million worlds amen amen but it's the warning that God gives us not to be partaker of that sin that unbelief that unbelief is is nothing but brought from uh uh hybrid Church hybrid word somebody's made up or some Seminary start to teach or and it started at Nia 320 ad and it's gone on from there and right at that time God warns them I do not you you starting out with the Deeds of with the teachings of balam and the Deeds of the nicians and I hate it I have that against you amen that's
