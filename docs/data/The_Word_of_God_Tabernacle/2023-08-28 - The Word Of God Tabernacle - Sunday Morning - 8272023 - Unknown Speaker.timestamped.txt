[30:02] amen take these few prayer requests we

[30:07] amen as you've noticed the brother
[30:09] sister Pat are with us today brother Pat
[30:11] went through a procedure a couple days
[30:12] ago where they cauterized some vowels
[30:16] and his around his heart or
[30:19] um
[30:19] I I don't know exactly how they do all
[30:22] that but anyway but he was planning on
[30:25] being in church but uh he wrote me a
[30:27] text earlier and said he was planning on
[30:29] coming but his veins are not cooperating
[30:32] he's bleeding internally and his thighs
[30:36] have turned purple so he needs to stay
[30:38] home and land lay in bed
[30:41] God bless you of course they're probably
[30:43] watching amen they usually stream when
[30:45] they're not here so and
[30:48] it serve to be prepared for brother Pat
[30:49] the situation Lord would just touch him
[30:52] and heal him completely from that
[30:54] situation amen the surgery to my
[30:57] knowledge as he wrote went really well
[31:00] and everything did good the doctors were
[31:02] happy so I said you
[31:05] I was surprised to even talk about
[31:06] coming anyway so did you stay home and
[31:09] you know recuperate it well you
[31:12] need five anymore
[31:13] things don't bounce back quite like they
[31:15] used to and especially when you're
[31:16] dealing with the heart just stay home
[31:18] and just rest and don't do anything you
[31:21] can just recuperate let your body
[31:22] recuperate so that's the way God made
[31:25] our bodies to be able to recuperate

[52:59] scripture now to Genesis chapter 3.
[53:02] we've got a couple more parts to get
[53:04] through
[53:07] last time we started on the seed of God
[53:11] got to running a little late so he
[53:14] called to ended the service so we'll
[53:17] just kind of try to pick up where we
[53:18] left off of the seed of God today the
[53:22] holy spirit this is the holy spirit Part
[53:24] 12 and it'll be the seed of God part two
[53:28] Genesis chapter 3
[53:30] we will as we have been
[53:35] start there
[53:38] today let's just bow our heads for word
[53:41] of prayer if we could before we read the
[53:42] scripture Lord Jesus father we're

[53:56] forsake us and Lord we've come to
[53:58] realize that to be the truth in our
[54:00] lives regardless of what we've gone

[54:27] service and Lord as we open the pages of
[54:30] this Bible this precious holy writ God
[54:32] as we read the words off of it may your
[54:35] Holy Spirit Lord just come in a powerful
[54:39] way Lord to let this word become a
[54:41] revelation to us and show us in here
[54:44] what should have us to see and know and
[54:46] draw us closer to you through it and
[54:48] make us more like you Lord in the image

[55:13] yourself again Lord God just use us Lord

[55:40] Our Lives pray you bless the remaining
[55:42] part of this service as you have your

[55:48] through the speaker the hero like God
[55:50] let it be accomplished what you said it
[55:52] forth as we commit it to you now Lord
[55:54] bless those that are here those who may
[55:56] be watching in the name of Jesus Christ
[55:58] we ask it amen
[56:02] Genesis chapter 3 verse 21.
[56:05] unto Adam also into it also and to his
[56:09] wife uh did the Lord God make coats of
[56:12] skins and clothe them
[56:15] you'd be seated if you'd like
[56:19] amen I want to turn over to First John
[56:21] we kind of went into first John a little
[56:24] bit but I I cut it back a little
[56:26] thinking that we might could finish the
[56:28] subject from last week on the seat of
[56:30] God so we just read a verse but I want
[56:32] to go back uh first John chapter 3 and I
[56:35] will only begin the first verse this
[56:37] time uh since we have a little more time
[56:39] to integrate some other things that uh
[56:42] we could just teach here and show
[56:45] through the scripture uh solidifying
[56:48] this subject that we've been on this
[56:49] Earth the holy spirit it's just so vital
[56:52] to us you know I've said for many years
[56:55] that
[56:56] my Ministry I always try to Major on the
[56:59] Holy Ghost
[57:00] that's that's been the major that I've
[57:03] tried to propagate to the work the
[57:06] Lord's give me to to express no matter
[57:09] who I'm where I'm at or who I'm
[57:11] ministering to the the Holy Spirit
[57:13] that's the premier thing the thing that
[57:16] matters the most when Jesus said you
[57:19] must be born again yes uh that wasn't an
[57:23] allegory that was a fact that was that
[57:26] was the number one Paramount thing that
[57:29] every human should have if you expect to
[57:32] be a part of his family in that Rapture
[57:34] of course uh this last day so tried to
[57:37] Major on that and just and and probably
[57:40] do a very poor job of a lot of we're
[57:43] just on Part 12 of what could probably
[57:45] be a several hundred part series uh but
[57:49] uh there's many other things pretty much
[57:52] every bit of it just encompasses the
[57:54] Holy Spirit even when you go back into
[57:56] the Old Testament like we've done some
[57:58] in this teaching but I want to go back
[58:00] start first John we left off with
[58:02] Ephesians chapter one but we'll come
[58:04] back to that but I want to go back again
[58:07] and incorporate some of the things that
[58:09] I sort of skipped over last time uh
[58:11] beginning with first John the third
[58:12] chapter first verse we read and talked
[58:16] out of the ninth verse but I want to get
[58:18] to the first verse and go through this
[58:19] now remember it's the seed of God this
[58:22] is the subject to the context for today
[58:24] the seed of God now uh First John 3 1
[58:28] behold what manner of love listen to
[58:31] this now
[58:32] behold what manner of love the father
[58:36] has bestowed upon us
[58:39] that we should be called the sons of God
[58:43] the sons of God or children of God if
[58:46] you will the children of God that we
[58:49] should be called the children of God not
[58:51] just called the children of God but look
[58:53] at how John follows this up
[58:56] uh be called the sons of God therefore
[58:59] the world knoweth us not because it knew
[59:02] him not beloved now
[59:05] there's one of my favorite words right
[59:07] now are we
[59:10] the sons of God not just called but we
[59:13] are the sons of God now we are the sons
[59:18] of God a son or child of God Children of
[59:21] the of the Lord uh uh offspring of the
[59:25] Lord
[59:27] just comes to show the fact that you had
[59:30] to always be in God
[59:33] if you were ever a child of God you
[59:36] always had to be a part of God God gives
[59:40] us a little bit of explanation we'll go
[59:43] over to I was going to read this a
[59:45] little bit later but the Lord's changing
[59:47] this all up so we'll just follow it
[59:49] let's go over to Hebrews and look in
[59:53] Hebrews the seventh chapter
[59:57] in Hebrews the seventh chapter it talks
[1:00:00] about Melchizedek and it talks about
[1:00:03] Abraham's interaction with Melchizedek
[1:00:05] and how Abraham paid Melchizedek tithing
[1:00:09] he gave it 10 of all that he had all of
[1:00:12] his increase is what the tithing is the
[1:00:15] tithing is your increase uh 10 of the
[1:00:19] increase or what you receive that 10
[1:00:22] percent that he had just got he gave to
[1:00:25] Melchizedek as a tithing and as that and
[1:00:30] as that was attributed
[1:00:32] uh by God to Abraham let's read what the
[1:00:37] scripture also says because this tithing
[1:00:40] that Abraham paid was not just
[1:00:43] attributed to Abraham amen uh seventh
[1:00:47] chapter 9 verse
[1:00:49] and as I may so say Levi also who
[1:00:54] receives ties because he was of course
[1:00:56] the levitical priesthood he was the
[1:00:58] priest of the children of Israel uh
[1:01:01] received ties paid ties in Abraham
[1:01:06] the only way that Levi
[1:01:08] paid tithes into the Lord look at the
[1:01:11] recognition that God is giving to Levi
[1:01:14] and acknowledging that he gives he gives
[1:01:18] Levi credit
[1:01:20] even though he wasn't there in the flesh
[1:01:24] like we are here he gave Levi credit for
[1:01:28] paying tithe to Melchizedek
[1:01:30] through Abraham even though Abraham is
[1:01:34] the one that paid it and you see about
[1:01:36] the actions and the reactions of of
[1:01:39] parents down from generation to
[1:01:42] generation to generation it matters what
[1:01:46] you do it doesn't just matter in your
[1:01:48] life it doesn't just matter in your
[1:01:50] children's life because Levi was the
[1:01:53] great grandson of Abraham
[1:01:56] great grandson you had to go three more
[1:01:59] generations to get to Levi from the time
[1:02:02] that Abraham paid ties to Melchizedek
[1:02:06] three more Generations God attributed to
[1:02:10] Levi the tithing that he paid no
[1:02:14] candidate to Abraham
[1:02:16] praise the Lord what does that signify
[1:02:18] to us he said well what are you going on
[1:02:20] about Newton well what it shows to me is
[1:02:23] God's acknowledgment of Levi always
[1:02:27] having been in Abraham
[1:02:30] even though it was just great great uh
[1:02:32] great grandson God attributed it to the
[1:02:36] great grandson of Abraham a tithing that
[1:02:39] Abraham paid
[1:02:40] praise God a signification that he was
[1:02:45] always there
[1:02:46] he was always a son or in Levi's case
[1:02:50] always a great grandson
[1:02:53] because he was in Abraham so you have to
[1:02:55] understand look at it and think about
[1:02:58] what God in God's mind because
[1:03:03] we in ourselves
[1:03:05] as humans and it's inherent in humanity
[1:03:08] that we see right here most of the time
[1:03:11] this is what we see we see acknowledge
[1:03:15] we work towards we think about what's
[1:03:17] right in front of us and but that's not
[1:03:20] that's and so to help us understand
[1:03:23] that's not how God looks at things
[1:03:26] that's not how things work in God's
[1:03:29] economy and the and the eternities of
[1:03:32] God it doesn't work that way God
[1:03:36] is an eternal being amen a spirit
[1:03:41] who is omniscient which means
[1:03:43] all-knowing God is omniscient or
[1:03:47] all-knowing he's also Eternal he's
[1:03:50] infinite
[1:03:51] so God doesn't look and see as us as
[1:03:54] finite beings
[1:03:56] just on the right here God knows the
[1:03:59] very end from the beginning
[1:04:01] he knows everything that ever would be
[1:04:04] how many uh brother Brown talked about
[1:04:07] how many gnats there would ever be on
[1:04:10] the earth Lord help me because of how
[1:04:13] many I've killed
[1:04:14] uh but I do my best to kill everyone I
[1:04:17] can see
[1:04:18] mosquitoes alike I do not like
[1:04:20] mosquitoes and I do not like gnats
[1:04:22] because they like me so much you think
[1:04:25] usually when someone really likes you
[1:04:27] you like them back not in this case they
[1:04:29] like me and they love to eat me up but I
[1:04:31] want to kill them as fast as I can find
[1:04:33] them but every night God knows every now
[1:04:36] that would ever exist and how much
[1:04:38] Tallow each gnat would produce
[1:04:41] that's the infinancy of God that's the
[1:04:43] omniscience of God the all-knowing of
[1:04:46] God so God doesn't look into things just
[1:04:48] right here okay Abraham
[1:04:52] hey praise God God's looking it all the
[1:04:55] way down to Levi and you think that's
[1:04:59] just an example
[1:05:00] because God doesn't stop there we have a
[1:05:04] scripture that talks about Levi
[1:05:06] attributed back to Abraham but we know
[1:05:09] that God looks on down to the lenients
[1:05:12] down to Eternity down through time
[1:05:14] so to be a to be attributed to Levi
[1:05:19] meant that Levi always had to be a son
[1:05:22] he had to be in Abraham for God to
[1:05:27] attribute that Taipei to Levi
[1:05:31] it just proves to us that Levi was
[1:05:33] already there
[1:05:35] as Abraham paid it he paid it on behalf
[1:05:38] of his entire posterity
[1:05:40] God just attributed it to Levi because
[1:05:43] Levi was a priesthood so if you are a
[1:05:46] child of God
[1:05:48] you always were a child of God
[1:05:50] you never were anything else in the mind
[1:05:53] of God always in the loins of God always
[1:05:56] in the thoughts of God always an
[1:05:59] attribute of God if you were ever a son
[1:06:01] so now it brings in the light John's
[1:06:05] say
[1:06:06] God the blessings of God that he has
[1:06:09] bestowed upon us
[1:06:11] to not only be called the children of
[1:06:14] God
[1:06:16] but to now be a child of God
[1:06:20] praise the Lord which means the seed of
[1:06:23] God was always there
[1:06:26] because it was the Seed of Abraham that
[1:06:30] produced an Isaac and through that seed
[1:06:33] that produced in Israel a Jacob and
[1:06:36] through that seed that produced a Levi
[1:06:38] that God attributed seedback seedback
[1:06:42] seed back to Abraham that paid that
[1:06:45] tithing that seed was already there
[1:06:48] praise the Lord and if it was the seed
[1:06:51] of God that was always there that
[1:06:53] brought down into human flesh
[1:06:57] and in you and I that shows that we are
[1:07:00] and now are the children of God Amen
[1:07:03] praise God by the seed of God the only
[1:07:06] way you can be a child of God is that
[1:07:09] you were in the the mind of God the
[1:07:12] loins of God
[1:07:13] as a seed as a thought as an attribute a
[1:07:17] part of God like we've said many many
[1:07:19] times the only way you'll ever be
[1:07:22] Eternal is that part of God that you are
[1:07:24] amen that attribute that God that that
[1:07:27] came out of God that is now who you are
[1:07:32] praise the Lord not you're born in
[1:07:34] sin-shaped need to become the world
[1:07:35] speaking lies but in there was that seed
[1:07:38] look as we continue to read now you can
[1:07:41] see the the infinancy of God
[1:07:44] see because God does not and the
[1:07:46] predestination of God getting a little
[1:07:48] ahead of myself but which we'll read in
[1:07:51] Ephesians in a moment the predestination
[1:07:53] of God because we know and remember God
[1:07:56] does not predestinate based on uh uh he
[1:08:01] bait he bases predestination based on
[1:08:04] his foreknowledge not on his will
[1:08:07] on his foreknowledge because he knowed
[1:08:10] all things would be amen that's how he
[1:08:13] predestinates that we would be the sons
[1:08:16] of God so it it comes it behooves us to
[1:08:20] understand that
[1:08:22] it's in God's power
[1:08:25] it is of God's Authority that
[1:08:29] whoever came as my son came out of my
[1:08:31] loins or out of his or out of theirs or
[1:08:34] so on and so forth that that that was
[1:08:38] there
[1:08:39] always there
[1:08:41] it was always there I was in my daddy's
[1:08:44] he was in his daddies and on back
[1:08:48] just like we are that part of God in God
[1:08:52] that God put here down through eternity
[1:08:54] down from the beginning of time all the
[1:08:57] way down the seed of God
[1:08:59] and then that lineage came the seed of
[1:09:01] God that's why you could know serpent
[1:09:03] seed has to be in the Garden of Eden
[1:09:07] because there's no way a cane could have
[1:09:10] come out of Adam
[1:09:13] could not have happened
[1:09:14] Adam was the seed of God and the seed of
[1:09:17] God could not produce a cane it had to
[1:09:20] be a different seed it had to be a
[1:09:22] different life and it was a serpent seed
[1:09:25] that produced a cane
[1:09:27] you notice after that and and his and
[1:09:30] his characteristics and his nature and
[1:09:33] what he did and how he was and how he uh
[1:09:35] what he did
[1:09:37] but now you look at what God did when he
[1:09:39] when he also again after the fall Adam
[1:09:43] knew his wife and produced a set
[1:09:47] the seed again of God's seed Adam and
[1:09:52] how he acted and what he did and how he
[1:09:55] lived amen there's a stark difference
[1:09:59] between the two and the same thing is
[1:10:01] true today
[1:10:02] there's a stark and it's getting more
[1:10:04] and more prevalent too the starkness of
[1:10:08] the difference between the true seed of
[1:10:10] God and the make-believer unbeliever or
[1:10:13] even the the
[1:10:21] amen look now
[1:10:23] beloved now
[1:10:25] now you know before I go let me read
[1:10:28] this
[1:10:30] I was gonna read this uh with this
[1:10:33] scripture so let me go ahead and read it
[1:10:35] it's the sea the Seal of God
[1:10:39] um
[1:10:40] are the the action messages who is this
[1:10:43] Melchizedek that brother Brown preached
[1:10:45] uh paragraph 69 he says but look clearly
[1:10:50] makes it clear you will never be the
[1:10:53] word
[1:10:55] the word
[1:10:56] what is a child of God what is God
[1:11:00] old saying yes a man's as good as his
[1:11:03] word amen God is his word
[1:11:06] he did he does not put this on paper
[1:11:09] produces unless he is backing it up it's
[1:11:12] a part of who he is I don't I don't hold
[1:11:15] this Bible up and say this is God this
[1:11:18] is not God but the word is uh is a form
[1:11:23] of who God is
[1:11:25] just like you are as good as your word
[1:11:28] amen
[1:11:30] he says but now look he says but you
[1:11:32] will never be the word
[1:11:35] unless you as a thought at the beginning
[1:11:39] what is that thought that's that
[1:11:40] attribute that's the scene
[1:11:43] you will never be the word unless you is
[1:11:46] the Fault at the beginning that proves
[1:11:49] the predestination of God
[1:11:52] you can't be the word unless you're a
[1:11:56] thought you had to be in his thinking
[1:11:59] first
[1:12:01] praise God blessed
[1:12:04] beloved now are we called
[1:12:08] the sons of God now are we the sons of
[1:12:12] God
[1:12:13] praise the Lord
[1:12:15] and it does not yet appear look by this
[1:12:18] quote we just read
[1:12:21] it does not yet appear or manifest
[1:12:24] itself in invisibility
[1:12:28] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:12:31] as John wrote this but we know look now
[1:12:34] we know as he's writing as he has wrote
[1:12:38] to us and we know it now more than any
[1:12:41] generation has ever known it why because
[1:12:44] of a prophet because of a word because
[1:12:46] of the manifestation of the uh in this
[1:12:49] last days of Jesus Christ revealing
[1:12:52] himself to his people amen it never was
[1:12:55] so before up to this time now we as the
[1:12:58] Bride of receiving that that that others
[1:13:01] should longed for that in the scripture
[1:13:03] they had talked about they wanted to
[1:13:05] know this they wanted to see this but it
[1:13:08] was not to be in God even said seal it
[1:13:10] up till the end time
[1:13:13] that's today
[1:13:16] John says we know
[1:13:19] that when he shall appear we shall be
[1:13:22] like him for we shall see him as he is
[1:13:26] now has God made his appearance
[1:13:29] God through his word has made his
[1:13:33] appearance to this bride through the
[1:13:35] opening of those in this last days the
[1:13:37] opening of his word he has revealed
[1:13:40] himself to us he has let us see in the
[1:13:43] fullness not just in part I remember
[1:13:45] brother random said now uh the the
[1:13:48] reformers and Wes uh a Luther had a part
[1:13:51] and Wesley had a part but they didn't
[1:13:54] have all the truths remember when we
[1:13:56] talked about the where the scripture
[1:13:58] meets scripture he said this and had a
[1:14:01] little and this and her bring a little
[1:14:02] he said but it took a profit of this
[1:14:04] last days to reach out and say okay this
[1:14:07] is correct and this is correct and this
[1:14:09] is correct that little life that was
[1:14:11] shown for that day longing and knowing
[1:14:14] as John said that this day would come
[1:14:18] he knew he wrote it that this day would
[1:14:22] come
[1:14:23] that we would know because when we see
[1:14:26] him we shall see him as he is
[1:14:28] praise the Lord
[1:14:30] and he is the word now
[1:14:33] coupling with that quote how could you
[1:14:36] become the word unless you were always
[1:14:39] the word
[1:14:41] how could you ever be a child of God
[1:14:43] unless you are always a child of God
[1:14:47] you can't you have to have always been a
[1:14:51] child of God you had always have been
[1:14:53] the word that's why the word is becoming
[1:14:56] the the words becoming flesh the flesh
[1:14:59] become word now we in this last day are
[1:15:02] becoming into that very image because we
[1:15:06] have seen him as he is now I am looking
[1:15:09] for and longing to that day of the
[1:15:12] Corporal body and be there where we can
[1:15:14] see him in that capacity face to face
[1:15:17] but in the spiritual aspect the Lord has
[1:15:20] revealed himself to us now
[1:15:22] he has taken into a prophet
[1:15:25] open this word and God has revealed
[1:15:29] himself to you personally not through a
[1:15:31] prophet but the Revelation come to you
[1:15:33] personally amen the Revelation did not
[1:15:36] come through a prophet
[1:15:38] the truth of it did but the Revelation
[1:15:41] did not the Revelation has to come
[1:15:43] directly from God to you person
[1:15:46] amen that did not come through a prophet
[1:15:49] and God revealing that to you helps you
[1:15:51] see him and know him as he is that's why
[1:15:54] you could look at the word and say oh
[1:15:56] praise God
[1:15:57] that's why you look in things that you
[1:15:59] didn't understand or things that didn't
[1:16:01] uh come together quite right or
[1:16:03] something and and God just open it
[1:16:05] reveal it to you let you see him who who
[1:16:08] he is
[1:16:09] amen when Isaac
[1:16:13] when you when when a man and wife come
[1:16:16] together
[1:16:19] typically maybe there's a culture that
[1:16:22] does I don't know but typically
[1:16:25] the the man and the wife
[1:16:29] get to know each other before they're
[1:16:31] married
[1:16:33] don't they
[1:16:35] I there may be a culture where they come
[1:16:38] to the wedding and all of a sudden a
[1:16:40] woman just pops out from behind the door
[1:16:42] and says I do but I've never heard of
[1:16:45] that
[1:16:47] amen I've never heard of that nor is
[1:16:50] that how God does it
[1:16:52] God didn't do it in the way that he just
[1:16:55] popped out the door and said here I am
[1:16:58] we're married there has to be a
[1:17:01] relationship it has to be according
[1:17:03] there has to be a a coming together of
[1:17:06] of word to word so that the two could
[1:17:09] become one together before they ever get
[1:17:15] amen and God reveals himself so that we
[1:17:19] can know him so that he can reveal
[1:17:22] himself to us he's manifest himself so
[1:17:25] we can understand so that we can know
[1:17:27] that God by Revelation can bring in uh
[1:17:30] together as one
[1:17:32] amen as a seed of God
[1:17:35] look he said we shall we sh we know
[1:17:40] when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:17:42] him
[1:17:43] praise God why is there ever going to be
[1:17:46] around how's there ever going to be a
[1:17:47] wedding
[1:17:48] how was there ever a wedding how would
[1:17:50] there ever be a Rapture If he if we
[1:17:54] weren't like him
[1:17:56] remember God's brother Adam said he's
[1:17:59] not coming for a foreigner he's coming
[1:18:00] for himself
[1:18:03] amen well how would he ever come if
[1:18:05] we're not like him right it could never
[1:18:08] happen
[1:18:09] for we shall see him as he is and every
[1:18:12] man let's get down to this now and every
[1:18:14] man that hath this hope
[1:18:16] and him purifies himself even as he is
[1:18:19] pure whosoever commit his sin
[1:18:22] transgresseth also the law for sin is
[1:18:25] the transgression of the law and he know
[1:18:29] that he was manifested to take away our
[1:18:32] sins and in him is no sin now again I've
[1:18:37] said this many times I don't want to
[1:18:39] rewrite rewrite the word but the fact
[1:18:42] that he could take away our sin he had
[1:18:45] to have no sin
[1:18:46] that's the reason brother Branham said
[1:18:48] that's the reason that no other man
[1:18:50] known down through the time could even
[1:18:52] look on this book to to try to redeem in
[1:18:55] any way shape or form because we were
[1:18:57] all Sinners but he was not
[1:19:01] and because he had no sin he could take
[1:19:04] our sin
[1:19:06] praise the Lord
[1:19:08] whosoever abideth in him sinneth not
[1:19:13] whosoever sinneth has not seen him
[1:19:15] neither known him
[1:19:17] little children let no man deceive you
[1:19:19] that he that doeth righteousness is
[1:19:22] righteous even as he is righteous he
[1:19:25] that committed sin is of the devil
[1:19:28] for the devil sentence from the
[1:19:30] beginning
[1:19:31] for this purpose the Son of God was
[1:19:34] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:19:37] works of the devil
[1:19:39] even in the flesh to the bride to the
[1:19:44] bride even in the flesh now
[1:19:48] we still make mistakes and do things
[1:19:49] wrong and sin and miss the mark many
[1:19:51] times we have in life that we want to do
[1:19:54] but that's attributed to the devil not
[1:19:57] to us
[1:19:58] amen when you repent where does that go
[1:20:01] brother bear said it goes back on the
[1:20:02] head of Satan where it originated amen
[1:20:04] amen the devil and now God came to
[1:20:08] destroy the works of the devil where in
[1:20:11] you
[1:20:11] not in the cosmos The Works of the devil
[1:20:15] continue on in this Cosmos it will be
[1:20:17] destroyed that's another part of it it
[1:20:19] will be destroyed but in us now the
[1:20:22] works of the devil have been destroyed
[1:20:24] it has no effect on you
[1:20:27] has no binding on you at all praise the
[1:20:31] Lord
[1:20:32] that's why you can look and say God has
[1:20:34] redeemed me God has set me free because
[1:20:37] it has no bearing on you God has set you
[1:20:40] free
[1:20:41] praise the Lord
[1:20:43] now you are the very righteousness of
[1:20:46] Jesus Christ himself
[1:20:48] oh how could I be the very righteousness
[1:20:51] of Jesus Christ because he took your
[1:20:52] place so you could take his well if
[1:20:56] you've took his places he not the very
[1:20:58] righteous almighty God
[1:21:03] brother Brown didn't miss the Mark when
[1:21:06] he said we fall way below our privileges
[1:21:08] things yeah amen that's the truth yeah
[1:21:11] last first on my first whosoever is born
[1:21:14] of God does not commit sin we talked
[1:21:18] about that last week or last time born
[1:21:21] of God does not commit sin where does he
[1:21:24] not commit sin in the place of the new
[1:21:26] birth where is that in the soul
[1:21:28] this is the mark makes mistakes the
[1:21:31] flesh the spirit but the soul of man
[1:21:34] were the spirit now of God dwells where
[1:21:37] he is Born Again cannot sin
[1:21:41] God Almighty cannot attribute sin over
[1:21:46] top of the token
[1:21:48] cannot do it
[1:21:50] amen
[1:21:53] no more than Jesus Christ himself was a
[1:21:56] sinner when he was here
[1:21:58] could not be was not
[1:22:01] did not
[1:22:03] nor can God attribute sin over the over
[1:22:07] the token can't do it
[1:22:09] amen
[1:22:10] when that soul is sealed the seals got
[1:22:13] in seals the devil out praise the Lord
[1:22:16] now you can no longer sin there's no sin
[1:22:19] in there that's that belongs to God
[1:22:22] for you now look again we went over this
[1:22:24] a little bit last week whosoever is born
[1:22:27] of God doth not commit sin for his
[1:22:30] God's seed remaineth in who me
[1:22:37] you
[1:22:39] God seed remained it wasn't just place
[1:22:43] there
[1:22:44] it was always there and it's still there
[1:22:48] it's now just found it's betting ground
[1:22:51] what was the betting ground the word yes
[1:22:54] I'm very sore
[1:22:56] it's like the the the the parable of the
[1:22:59] sower that we read last week or last
[1:23:01] time that that Parable what was it that
[1:23:05] that was that was planted God planted
[1:23:08] that seed in the ground so that it would
[1:23:11] bring forth life
[1:23:13] when this seed that remains in him was
[1:23:16] there
[1:23:17] it was it was always there
[1:23:20] just dormant and that word brought that
[1:23:23] spirit that came in the Holy Ghost and
[1:23:26] Fire brought it to life
[1:23:28] so they could live
[1:23:30] and when he burned out that old nature
[1:23:33] and the spirit of God came in to live in
[1:23:36] there it made you a new creature sealed
[1:23:40] that spirit in there now there can be no
[1:23:42] sin attributed to you
[1:23:44] none
[1:23:46] because that's the real you yes this is
[1:23:49] not the real me right
[1:23:51] this is just a Time body I'm housed in
[1:23:53] for a short time that's human spirit is
[1:23:57] not me it's only there
[1:24:00] to keep this body alive if the human
[1:24:03] Spirit left me I would die
[1:24:06] this flesh would fall to the ground
[1:24:08] that's the reason it's in there but that
[1:24:12] soul is what's worth 10 million worlds
[1:24:14] yes that God is attributed to that seed
[1:24:17] remaineth in there then he can not sin
[1:24:21] so what sin then is attributed to you to
[1:24:25] those that are born again
[1:24:28] none
[1:24:29] zero why because of the seed of God
[1:24:34] praise the Lord that's our whole subject
[1:24:37] today because of the seed of God no sin
[1:24:42] attributed to you
[1:24:43] yeah again
[1:24:45] you make mistakes
[1:24:46] flesh spirit
[1:24:48] Miss Mark but that attributing that God
[1:24:52] would attribute that sin is not to you
[1:24:56] you repent that sin goes to the devil
[1:24:58] lays on until the day of judgment
[1:25:00] he is the one responsible for that
[1:25:04] remember
[1:25:05] when brother random talked that uh
[1:25:07] talked about that
[1:25:09] the devil chose to take the person's
[1:25:12] mind
[1:25:13] God chose the heart amen amen so in the
[1:25:17] mind others things the devil can try to
[1:25:21] do
[1:25:21] he has no place there but he can try
[1:25:25] the spirit imagination thoughts
[1:25:28] conscience all those things he can try
[1:25:31] to do
[1:25:31] but he cannot infiltrate anything that
[1:25:35] he does see that's not your fault
[1:25:38] it's not when the Devil comes and puts a
[1:25:41] thought in your mind
[1:25:42] something that is not correct a thought
[1:25:45] that misses the mark a sinful thing
[1:25:47] that's not your thought that's his
[1:25:49] thought
[1:25:50] amen
[1:25:51] he just put it in you he found a way a
[1:25:55] place somehow to put it in you
[1:25:57] you cast down reasonings you bring that
[1:26:01] thought captive to The Obedience of
[1:26:03] Jesus Christ who is attributed to that
[1:26:06] The Devil Is Right not you
[1:26:09] he was born of God cannot commit sin I
[1:26:13] wish we could get to where we understand
[1:26:14] that
[1:26:15] that and the truth of it
[1:26:17] the real uh the the revelation of it
[1:26:21] for his seed God seed remaineth in US
[1:26:25] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[1:26:29] God
[1:26:31] praise the Lord cannot sin because he's
[1:26:34] born of God you look at the Armenians
[1:26:36] you look at the Calvinists brother Ram
[1:26:38] talked about when it was on this side
[1:26:39] one was on this side he said but all of
[1:26:42] them have a truth but they straight
[1:26:43] aside from the truth that God gave him
[1:26:45] amen they took the light that they had
[1:26:47] for their day and they ran with it but
[1:26:49] as they ran just like every denomination
[1:26:52] they got off track and they got off
[1:26:54] track one went way over to this side and
[1:26:57] one went way over to this side but
[1:26:58] remember brother random said there is a
[1:27:01] truth that's in the middle between the
[1:27:02] two
[1:27:03] if you have and thank God for a prophet
[1:27:06] to take the truth from one side the
[1:27:08] truth or another and make it balanced to
[1:27:10] where it works in the scripture and
[1:27:12] that's what we're looking at that's what
[1:27:14] we care about in the balance of the
[1:27:16] scripture because if you take one line
[1:27:18] of thought it takes you away off that
[1:27:20] way you take another line of thought it
[1:27:22] takes you away off that way that's what
[1:27:23] makes denomination but if you take the
[1:27:26] Simple Pure word by revelation of it it
[1:27:29] keeps you right in the middle of the
[1:27:30] road
[1:27:31] what we find where scripture meets
[1:27:33] scripture then you've got all the word
[1:27:34] tying together
[1:27:36] amen all the word tying together just
[1:27:39] like hell is not Eternal we know we know
[1:27:42] hell is not Eternal but a lot of
[1:27:43] Christian people believe that there's an
[1:27:45] eternal hell they think that people are
[1:27:47] going to be burning for eternity and
[1:27:49] that's just not true
[1:27:51] amen it can't be true because there's
[1:27:53] only one form of eternal life and if
[1:27:55] anybody's in there Burning For Eternity
[1:27:57] that means they have eternal life or if
[1:27:59] they've got eternal life they're a god
[1:28:03] and how is God going to be burning in
[1:28:05] hell he didn't create it for himself he
[1:28:08] created for the devil and his followers
[1:28:11] so there can't be an eternal hell not to
[1:28:14] mention the fact that the Bible says
[1:28:15] that hell was created
[1:28:17] and anything that had a beginning has an
[1:28:19] ending
[1:28:20] amen it's that simple let's go over now
[1:28:24] First Corinthians
[1:28:27] amen First Corinthians not First
[1:28:29] Corinthians first uh Ephesians
[1:28:34] Ephesians the first chapter
[1:28:38] amen remembering now
[1:28:41] God is omniscient
[1:28:43] God is all-knowing
[1:28:45] God is all present God is all-powerful
[1:28:48] God is eternal God is infinite amen he
[1:28:52] predetermined predestinates based on his
[1:28:56] foreknowledge
[1:28:57] people in the world talk about it like
[1:28:59] they're in some trap or something I mean
[1:29:02] some I'm in a trap of some God well what
[1:29:06] they can't understand or have a
[1:29:08] revelation of is the fact that God
[1:29:10] already knew all of that down through
[1:29:13] the annals of time
[1:29:15] because he's eternal
[1:29:17] he's omniscient he not knows all things
[1:29:20] he knows all your thoughts he knows all
[1:29:22] your actions he knows all your Deeds of
[1:29:25] everybody anybody
[1:29:27] how could you how could you hide it from
[1:29:30] him then
[1:29:31] but people still have that thought
[1:29:34] but now let's go Ephesians chapter 1
[1:29:37] verse 1.
[1:29:40] Ephesians chapter one verse one we'll
[1:29:43] start reading we read down through most
[1:29:45] of this last time but we'll go back
[1:29:48] again to the first to the first verse
[1:29:51] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[1:29:55] will of God now it wasn't Paul that made
[1:29:57] himself that this was by the will of God
[1:30:00] to the Saints which is our which are
[1:30:03] Ephesus hence the Ephesians book in the
[1:30:07] Bible
[1:30:07] and to the faithful in Jesus in Christ
[1:30:10] Jesus that's me
[1:30:13] that's you
[1:30:14] amen so this is as much to you as to
[1:30:17] anybody right
[1:30:19] Grace be unto you and peace from God our
[1:30:22] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:27] now I have a thought there but I'm gonna
[1:30:28] I'm gonna skip over that
[1:30:31] a lot of people will take a scripture
[1:30:33] like that and they'll try to make two
[1:30:35] Gods out of it
[1:30:36] amen but God's a Triumph being let me
[1:30:40] okay I am going to do this think about
[1:30:42] this for a second how many times has a
[1:30:45] person ever said or have you ever said I
[1:30:48] love you with all my heart mind soul
[1:30:50] spirit
[1:30:53] well I'm not for people I'm one person
[1:30:58] but I love you with my heart and my soul
[1:31:01] my mind
[1:31:04] God is infinite yes but he's one God
[1:31:08] but not like your finger he's one God in
[1:31:12] in different offices just like you're a
[1:31:15] human being in in uh you have three
[1:31:18] parts to you
[1:31:19] you also have many manifestations in
[1:31:23] your life
[1:31:25] I I'll just use me I am a son
[1:31:28] I am a human
[1:31:30] I am a male
[1:31:31] I am a husband I am a father I am a
[1:31:35] grandfather I I uh how many more could
[1:31:39] we go to attribute to ourselves
[1:31:42] just us
[1:31:43] amen
[1:31:45] that identifies but see none of those
[1:31:48] tell who I am because you could take
[1:31:50] those seven identifications and put them
[1:31:51] to a lot of people
[1:31:53] amen maybe even some here
[1:31:56] but Newton Benedict is my name
[1:32:00] let me say my name that identifies me as
[1:32:02] who I am
[1:32:03] praise the Lord that makes me who I am
[1:32:06] that doesn't make me two people it
[1:32:08] doesn't make me three people
[1:32:10] amen
[1:32:12] praise the Lord
[1:32:13] go on
[1:32:14] Grace been to you in peace from God our
[1:32:17] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:21] see we know what he means when he says
[1:32:23] that the world sees two different gods a
[1:32:26] lot of people
[1:32:27] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:32:30] Lord Jesus Christ now it says God and
[1:32:33] Father now it's God and Father two
[1:32:35] different people
[1:32:37] well of course not hey man he's the God
[1:32:41] and the father
[1:32:42] you understand I hope this makes more
[1:32:45] sense probably I'm doing a horrible job
[1:32:46] of it but uh God and Father's not too
[1:32:50] different right God and Father of the
[1:32:52] Lord Jesus uh well is he Lord is he
[1:32:55] Jesus is he Christ you see people take
[1:32:58] it and they go to seed with it it's the
[1:33:01] same person it's the same God
[1:33:05] amen blessed be the God and father of
[1:33:08] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[1:33:10] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:33:13] places in Christ
[1:33:15] in Heavenly places in Christ according
[1:33:19] as he hath chosen Us in him before the
[1:33:24] foundation of the world before the
[1:33:25] foundation of the world as we read the
[1:33:27] scripture last week he chose us
[1:33:30] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:33:33] what did that choosing do now it's
[1:33:37] different than our uh analogy that we
[1:33:41] have with Abraham and Levi because
[1:33:43] Abraham did not have a choice of of
[1:33:45] Jacob he didn't have a choice of of Levi
[1:33:48] he didn't have that choice he just sowed
[1:33:51] the seed it was God's choice it's always
[1:33:54] God's choice but when it comes to
[1:33:56] choosing you it was God's choice
[1:34:00] it wasn't just a matter of fact to say
[1:34:02] that you just came forth and God had
[1:34:05] nothing to do with it God chose and
[1:34:08] that's the difference when God chooses
[1:34:10] God is specifically specific uh special
[1:34:14] about who he chooses
[1:34:17] and he chose you
[1:34:19] praise the Lord
[1:34:20] now how fast how special do you feel
[1:34:23] that God chose you before the foundation
[1:34:28] of the world that we should be now where
[1:34:30] do you put predestination now
[1:34:33] amen predetermined
[1:34:37] he determined ahead of time
[1:34:40] amen we do that sometimes we don't do it
[1:34:43] so far out as uh thousands of years but
[1:34:46] sometimes we'll predetermine before we
[1:34:49] go somewhere that we're going to go to a
[1:34:51] restaurant afterwards we do that at work
[1:34:54] sometimes we'll come into work and uh
[1:34:57] we'll sit at lunch and we'll say where
[1:34:59] do you want to go for dinner uh I don't
[1:35:02] know we're we're eating now so why do we
[1:35:04] have to decide that well because if we
[1:35:06] don't we spend 15 minutes afterwards
[1:35:07] deciding and we end up going someplace
[1:35:09] stupid so let's choose now where we're
[1:35:12] going to go so we make a good choice
[1:35:16] and then and a lot of times we do and we
[1:35:19] predetermine that when we get off work
[1:35:22] we're going to go here to eat that we've
[1:35:24] already predetermined that based on
[1:35:27] criteria and circumstances
[1:35:29] God predetermined or predestined all of
[1:35:34] these things based on the fact that he
[1:35:37] knew what was going to happen from the
[1:35:40] beginning to the end
[1:35:41] how easy predestination is I just don't
[1:35:45] understand how people well I guess
[1:35:47] understand you still have revelation to
[1:35:49] understand it but now what they don't
[1:35:52] understand too is that God's
[1:35:54] predestination does not override your
[1:35:58] free will
[1:35:59] you are still a free moral agent
[1:36:02] predestination does not override that so
[1:36:05] when people say there is some kind of
[1:36:07] Trap by some man-made God that is so
[1:36:11] ungodly and false
[1:36:13] you are as free now as you have ever
[1:36:16] been or ever will be it's just that God
[1:36:19] already knows
[1:36:21] praise the Lord
[1:36:23] amen and that that's it's just that
[1:36:26] simple God already knows he's
[1:36:29] predestined because he already knows and
[1:36:33] the fact that somebody would say that
[1:36:35] just proves that that's what he already
[1:36:37] knew that you were going to say or that
[1:36:39] you were going to do or who you were
[1:36:41] going to be or where you were going to
[1:36:43] go or how you were going to live your
[1:36:45] life every single aspect of it if God
[1:36:48] knew every net and how much Tallow would
[1:36:50] make then how much would God know about
[1:36:52] every single one of us
[1:36:54] everything you think everything you'd go
[1:36:57] everything about it
[1:37:00] predestination it's easy when you
[1:37:02] understand it
[1:37:04] that we should be holy Without Blame
[1:37:06] before him in love having predestinated
[1:37:09] us
[1:37:10] he chose us before the foundation of the
[1:37:12] world so he can predestinate us unto the
[1:37:16] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:37:19] himself now I told you that adoption we
[1:37:22] went through that whole huge series that
[1:37:24] we were on uh Cortaro of adoption is
[1:37:27] over 30 parts of adoption to understand
[1:37:31] that the adoption
[1:37:33] only brings into light the fact that we
[1:37:37] were that we were born in sin shaped in
[1:37:39] the equity come the world speaking lies
[1:37:41] it doesn't mean that you're someone
[1:37:42] else's child and God took you to himself
[1:37:45] does not mean that it just means that
[1:37:48] God you belong to God and God is placing
[1:37:52] you in that body where you belong
[1:37:55] amen it also brings to I to like to
[1:37:58] understand that in this country or at
[1:38:00] least it used to be that if you adopted
[1:38:03] a child you could never disinherit that
[1:38:06] child
[1:38:07] because and that is not true for a
[1:38:09] natural born child if they're your child
[1:38:12] from your ones you can you can disown
[1:38:14] them but if you take the conscious
[1:38:16] decision to adopt a child you could
[1:38:19] never disown that child
[1:38:20] because you made a specific decision
[1:38:23] that you were going to go through the
[1:38:24] process and pay the money or whatever
[1:38:26] you had to do to bring that child into
[1:38:28] your family you can you could never
[1:38:30] disown that child
[1:38:32] praise the Lord I just love the
[1:38:35] spiritual aspect even when you look at
[1:38:37] the physical application and even some
[1:38:40] of the laws that that man has put down
[1:38:43] it echoes that God looks down and says
[1:38:45] see there
[1:38:47] amen that's exactly the truth
[1:38:50] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:38:53] children
[1:38:55] by Jesus Christ to himself according to
[1:38:59] the good pleasure of his will amen now
[1:39:03] his predestination he doesn't
[1:39:05] predestinate based on his will but his
[1:39:08] predestination of his foreknowledge
[1:39:10] Works through his Works to his perfect
[1:39:13] will
[1:39:14] amen so even if we do sometimes end up
[1:39:18] in God's permissive will
[1:39:20] we still end up in in the place if we're
[1:39:23] children of God in that perfect will of
[1:39:25] God Amen amen amen
[1:39:28] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:39:30] where he has made us accepted into
[1:39:32] beloved in whom we have received
[1:39:34] Redemption through his blood the
[1:39:36] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:39:38] riches of his grace and see Saints all
[1:39:40] of this the choosing the predestination
[1:39:43] the Redemption All that all that whole
[1:39:47] flow of of God's plan is working through
[1:39:52] that seed
[1:39:55] every every aspect of this plan this
[1:39:59] flow of light that God is bringing
[1:40:01] through through Paul's description to
[1:40:04] the Church of Ephesus he's showing that
[1:40:07] entire flow is nothing but going right
[1:40:11] through the seed of God
[1:40:13] he chose you because you're a seed of
[1:40:16] God he predestinated you because you're
[1:40:19] a seed of God he redeemed you because
[1:40:22] you're a seed of God his he reveals
[1:40:25] himself to you because you're a seed of
[1:40:27] God he gives you an inheritance because
[1:40:30] you're his seed amen praise God
[1:40:34] all these blessings God gives us is
[1:40:36] simply because we're his seed amen we're
[1:40:40] from his lenience we're from his loins
[1:40:42] we belong to him and always have
[1:40:44] belonged to it yeah we may not have
[1:40:47] always known it sometimes we may not
[1:40:49] have wanted it but we've always been a
[1:40:51] child of God
[1:40:53] yeah the prodigal son was always his son
[1:40:55] he never was not a son he was always a
[1:40:58] son even though it was a time in his
[1:41:00] life where he didn't want to be a son
[1:41:02] he wanted to go and live his life and do
[1:41:04] whatever he wanted to do he didn't want
[1:41:06] his daddy
[1:41:08] but there come to the place and time
[1:41:09] where he came to himself
[1:41:12] and he realized
[1:41:13] well if I could just go back and just
[1:41:15] have a little morsel of what my my my
[1:41:17] dad's Butlers in major eating I'd be a
[1:41:21] happy person he came back home and his
[1:41:23] dad fell on his neck and said welcome
[1:41:25] home my son
[1:41:27] praise God kill the fatted calf and
[1:41:30] let's have a party and be happy cause my
[1:41:33] son it was gone and now he's home
[1:41:35] my son
[1:41:37] not my stranger
[1:41:39] my son
[1:41:41] praise the Lord I think a lot of people
[1:41:42] in this world need to remember that yes
[1:41:44] a lot of people in this world need to
[1:41:46] understand that
[1:41:48] praise God my son or my grandchild I
[1:41:52] think it's a disgrace I'm not I'm I'm
[1:41:55] not going to call any names but I think
[1:41:57] it's a disgrace that a grandfather would
[1:42:00] not acknowledge his grandbabian that is
[1:42:03] absolutely immoral inhuman and ungodly
[1:42:07] and I'll leave that there I that that
[1:42:10] just creams my corn I hate that
[1:42:13] to how how could anybody
[1:42:16] uh uh
[1:42:18] disown their own flesh and blood uh
[1:42:23] let's move on
[1:42:26] in whom we have Redemption through his
[1:42:28] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[1:42:30] to the richness of his grace wherein he
[1:42:33] hath abound toward us in all wisdom and
[1:42:35] Prudence having made known unto us the
[1:42:38] mystery of his will according to his
[1:42:40] good pleasure that he has purposed in
[1:42:42] himself good pleasure in himself how is
[1:42:44] it purposed his or knowledge
[1:42:47] is for he pre-purposed through his
[1:42:49] foreknowledge he predetermined through
[1:42:52] his foreknowledge
[1:42:54] praise God sometimes we predetermine
[1:42:57] that we're going to a certain place for
[1:42:58] dinner after work and after we eat that
[1:43:00] food we get indigestion that might not
[1:43:02] have been the wisest choice
[1:43:05] but God doesn't do that
[1:43:07] because God knows this choice is going
[1:43:10] to lead to this result and that result
[1:43:12] is going to be the best thing that you
[1:43:14] could hope for in your life
[1:43:16] praise God it won't give you indigestion
[1:43:18] amen because God knows I might not know
[1:43:22] but he does yes he that's why he
[1:43:25] predetermines it that way that's why we
[1:43:28] fuss and fight and Pull and pushing we
[1:43:30] God why God why God's got a purpose and
[1:43:33] a reason for all of it
[1:43:35] and some of it is hard some of it is
[1:43:38] very grating on the human flesh and
[1:43:40] spirit but it all works to a greater
[1:43:43] work of God we just love him remember
[1:43:46] all things work
[1:43:48] [Music]
[1:43:50] amen yeah
[1:43:52] you all know the scripture you probably
[1:43:54] all can quote it
[1:43:56] it all works together amen for our good
[1:44:00] because we love him
[1:44:04] amen let's continue on
[1:44:07] that in the dispensation the fullness of
[1:44:09] times he might gather together uh gather
[1:44:12] together in one all things in Christ
[1:44:15] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:44:18] on earth even in him in whom also we
[1:44:22] have a pain and inheritance an
[1:44:25] inheritance why because we're his
[1:44:27] children we are his seed
[1:44:30] being predestinated according to the
[1:44:32] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:44:34] after the counsel of his own will that
[1:44:37] we should be to the praise of his glory
[1:44:39] who first trusted in Christ
[1:44:41] in whom uh in in whom ye also trusted
[1:44:45] after that you heard the word truth
[1:44:47] Gospel of your salvation in whom also
[1:44:50] after that ye believed you were sealed
[1:44:53] with a holy spirit of promise
[1:44:56] which is the earnest of your inheritance
[1:44:59] the down payment until the Redemption
[1:45:02] the full possession
[1:45:05] the Redemption of the purchased
[1:45:07] possession unto the praise of his glory
[1:45:09] of Romans 8 23 to the full Redemption
[1:45:13] that God's word of we're not full we're
[1:45:17] redeemed
[1:45:18] but the claiming of that Redemption the
[1:45:21] fullness of the claiming of that
[1:45:22] Redemption hasn't taken place yet yes
[1:45:24] our souls our bought God's filled us
[1:45:26] with his Spirit but this body is still
[1:45:29] subject to the elements of the world but
[1:45:31] when this body receives a new body when
[1:45:34] this body is changed we go on a Rapture
[1:45:37] the consummation just like that yeah
[1:45:40] amen it'll be complete because we belong
[1:45:44] to God we don't belong to someone else
[1:45:46] we belong to god let's look at this
[1:45:50] [Music]
[1:45:51] um
[1:45:55] let me see if I can find here thinking
[1:45:58] man's filter
[1:46:00] he said there is a real filtration of
[1:46:02] the sin of the world and the love of the
[1:46:03] world is dead this Soul this Soul he's
[1:46:07] pointing here this soul is drawing only
[1:46:11] one thing here it is don't forget it all
[1:46:15] you out there on the telephone said it
[1:46:17] in your mind when a thinking man begins
[1:46:19] to think who he is going uh who is going
[1:46:21] to stand before and and uh the word of
[1:46:25] God and what the word of God is when he
[1:46:27] begins to think then he draws through
[1:46:30] that
[1:46:31] there's nothing can get through get to
[1:46:34] it but the Holy Ghost
[1:46:37] what is it
[1:46:39] it's the germ seed word from the
[1:46:43] beginning germ seed word from the
[1:46:46] beginning amen
[1:46:49] from the beginning that you was in God
[1:46:52] at the beginning
[1:46:54] standing there drawing the seed life the
[1:46:58] seed is in your heart this listen now
[1:47:02] First John 3 9 the seed is in Your Heart
[1:47:06] by four ordination
[1:47:09] always there
[1:47:11] amen praise God
[1:47:13] remember we talked the other day
[1:47:15] I had I've had people tell me oh it only
[1:47:17] came in there when you believed it only
[1:47:19] came in there and you're baptized no no
[1:47:21] no no that is not scripture
[1:47:24] it was there always there and it
[1:47:27] remained there
[1:47:29] brother random said that word that was
[1:47:32] in you was God at the beginning staring
[1:47:34] here drawing that seed light
[1:47:37] the seed is in Your Heart by four Nation
[1:47:42] Hallelujah the seed is already in there
[1:47:45] already in there by the four knowledge
[1:47:48] of God predestinated
[1:47:52] predestinated that is that word that
[1:47:55] people don't like to hear but it's the
[1:47:56] truth amen
[1:47:58] predestinated God
[1:48:01] predestinating by that word putting it
[1:48:04] in your heart now we'll close here first
[1:48:06] Peter to read this scripture
[1:48:09] first Peter
[1:48:14] chapter 1 verse 23
[1:48:19] First Peter chapter 1 verse 23 being
[1:48:22] born again
[1:48:24] not of corruptable seed but of
[1:48:28] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[1:48:31] liveth and abideth forever born again
[1:48:35] of Incorruptible seed the seed of God
[1:48:39] you only seed that's Incorruptible not
[1:48:42] of corruptable seed what is the
[1:48:45] corruptible seed I was born of a
[1:48:47] corruptable seed by Humanity
[1:48:50] by the fall in the beginning of the
[1:48:52] Garden of Eden the reason I came to this
[1:48:55] world uh sinner-speaking lies and that's
[1:48:59] the reason I came how the reason why or
[1:49:02] how I came into this world through that
[1:49:04] in for that through that corruptible
[1:49:06] seed so the differentiation that people
[1:49:09] draw now is the difference between a
[1:49:12] corruptible seed and an Incorruptible
[1:49:14] seed is the difference in understanding
[1:49:17] First John 3 to where there is a sin
[1:49:20] that's not sin and then a sin that is
[1:49:23] sin
[1:49:24] or missing the mark
[1:49:25] the difference between corruptible seed
[1:49:28] and Incorruptible seed the corruptible
[1:49:31] seed will continue to do things through
[1:49:34] this sticky flesh the corruptible sea
[1:49:37] will continue to do things all through
[1:49:39] life
[1:49:40] that they shouldn't do or shouldn't
[1:49:42] think or how they shouldn't act but The
[1:49:45] Incorruptible seed will never ever
[1:49:49] disbelief never ever miss the mark
[1:49:53] because it is that Incorruptible seed
[1:49:55] that we are born by that is our new
[1:49:58] birth or our born-again experience
[1:50:02] being born again of Incorruptible seed
[1:50:06] now you see as John takes on
[1:50:10] well the Holy Spirit working through
[1:50:12] Peter and John that bring to light this
[1:50:15] exact same thing to help us understand
[1:50:17] the difference between an Incorruptible
[1:50:20] seed and a corruptible season the
[1:50:22] difference between the missing the mark
[1:50:23] in your flesh or knowing that you cannot
[1:50:25] sin in your soul because you now belong
[1:50:29] to God
[1:50:31] 's seed is in you and you cannot sin
[1:50:34] because God cannot sin
[1:50:37] praise the Lord but you're going to
[1:50:39] continue to make mistakes
[1:50:41] do things you shouldn't
[1:50:43] the difference between what John is
[1:50:45] talking about and what Paul and what
[1:50:47] Peter is talking about they're bringing
[1:50:49] the both together in life so that we can
[1:50:51] understand them
[1:50:52] amen it's the seed of God
[1:50:55] drawing from the seed of God the seed of
[1:50:59] God is The Incorruptible seed praise the
[1:51:03] Lord that's who we are that's who God is
[1:51:05] made of That's Where We Belong
[1:51:08] amen praise the Lord let's stand if we
[1:51:11] could
[1:51:18] The Incorruptible seed is the seed of
[1:51:20] God
[1:51:23] the corruptable seeds are human seed or
[1:51:25] human life
[1:51:27] amen
[1:51:29] when God said be therefore perfect he
[1:51:32] didn't mean that you would ever in this
[1:51:33] body ever be uh sinless say to miss the
[1:51:37] mark
[1:51:38] we miss the mark all the time
[1:51:40] amen but God's Incorruptible seat
[1:51:45] overrides that so that we ourselves
[1:51:49] remember ourselves that's our soul is
[1:51:51] ourselves not this thing
[1:51:53] is is sinless
[1:51:56] we're sinless I could say Newton been
[1:51:58] it's sinless
[1:52:00] but that Newton identifies this flesh
[1:52:03] but the real me who I really am is
[1:52:06] yeah because that real me and who I
[1:52:08] really am is only a part of God
[1:52:11] praise the Lord no wonder it can be
[1:52:14] sinless because it's it's part of God
[1:52:17] yes amen it's the seed that remaineth in
[1:52:20] US
[1:52:22] that seed is is God's seed
[1:52:25] praise the Lord
[1:52:27] amen I'm so thankful God still remains
[1:52:30] in us and proves that he is still the
[1:52:33] same yesterday today and forever
[1:52:35] amen

[1:56:19] brother Rogers having some meanings this
[1:56:22] week that I wanted to bring your
[1:56:24] attention but I have to find it because
[1:56:26] I didn't remember us it starts and it
[1:56:29] starts Wednesday and ends Monday
[1:56:32] [Music]
[1:56:36] August 30th he's having a church
[1:56:39] dedication Services uh starting August
[1:56:43] 30th which I think is in that Wednesday
[1:56:45] [Music]
[1:56:50] okay so Wednesday night August 30th
[1:56:53] through September 2nd uh which is
[1:56:57] Saturday night is at seven o'clock at
[1:57:00] night
[1:57:01] September 3rd which would be Sunday is
[1:57:03] 10 30 a.m and 5 P.M
[1:57:06] and Monday which is Labor Day September
[1:57:09] 4th they'll have a service at 11 30 A.M
[1:57:12] amen so if anybody wants that flyer the
[1:57:16] information I'll send it to you uh but
[1:57:19] just remember Wednesday through Monday
[1:57:21] he's having Services uh Wednesday
[1:57:23] through Saturday be at 7 p.m Sunday 10
[1:57:26] 30 which we'll have service here but 10
[1:57:29] 30 and 5 o'clock and Monday 11 30 A.M
[1:57:33] so remember those services
[1:57:35] in prayer if you would if you can't go
[1:57:38] if you can't go good I
[1:57:40] Lord will and I plan on making a couple
[1:57:43] of them if I can
[1:57:45] got a little busy week but I believe the
[1:57:47] Lord will just make a way so
[1:57:50] but if you want to if you need more
[1:57:53] information on our where is church is I
[1:57:55] know Sister Matisse has been there
[1:57:57] let me know I'll send you the flyer and
[1:58:00] you can
[1:58:01] desire to go be a part of you can't
[1:58:04] again pray for him if you would
[1:58:07] and also as I mentioned earlier next
[1:58:09] Sunday fly out at 1 30 ish so I'll need
[1:58:14] to bump the service up next week to 10.
[1:58:17] instead of 10 30. so next week will be
[1:58:20] 10 o'clock and from what I can see we're
[1:58:22] supposed to go to Salt Lake City for the
[1:58:24] next two jobs
[1:58:25] uh Salt Lake City this the Labor Day
[1:58:28] week and then the next week will be
[1:58:31] there but for some reason I don't know
[1:58:34] usually usually Airlines have flight
[1:58:36] patterns flight I shouldn't say patterns
[1:58:39] but schedules but it's so different I
[1:58:42] had to uh Delta is the main Hub in Salt
[1:58:47] Lake and there's non-stops from Tucson
[1:58:49] to Salt Lake but the last one they have
[1:58:51] Sunday is 11 30. so I've got to fly
[1:58:54] united through Denver over to Salt Lake
[1:58:57] but then the next Sunday they have a 5
[1:59:00] PM Delta has a 5 PM flight that goes
[1:59:03] straight to Salt Lake
[1:59:04] so I don't I don't understand how all
[1:59:07] that works but uh anyway so they're
[1:59:10] after next Sunday at least for the next
[1:59:13] three or four weeks it shouldn't have
[1:59:15] any problems as far as
[1:59:17] changing service times or anything like
[1:59:20] that so but remember next Sunday uh 10
[1:59:22] o'clock we'll have service here 10
[1:59:24] o'clock so remember that remember
[1:59:26] brother Rogers services in prayer if you
[1:59:28] would
[1:59:31] and I believe that's all I had I believe
[1:59:33] that's all the announcements I had so
[1:59:35] amen last appreciate the Lord's goodness
[1:59:39] this last week Micah testified
[1:59:43] was testified about his trip on uh last
[1:59:46] week was this past week was pretty hard
[1:59:49] week the week ones are always hard it
[1:59:51] was a very physical
[1:59:53] the conveyor all the tunnel equipment
[1:59:55] everything is very physical week so it's
[1:59:57] very taxing in and out of the pit
[2:00:00] welding uh my arm looks like I got
[2:00:03] chickenpox again I got so many burns on
[2:00:05] my arm from off the wealthy so it was it
[2:00:10] was a rough week but the flights were
[2:00:12] beautiful flights were all ever for all
[2:00:14] four of them was on was early
[2:00:16] no turbulences the weather was good like
[2:00:19] Micah said the weather was so good the
[2:00:21] Lord just blessed and I'm thankful to be
[2:00:23] home again so but remember the prayer
[2:00:26] requests things have been said mentioned
[2:00:29] for the past
[2:00:31] just Norma's son and his sister videos
[2:00:34] requested sister Sheila won't be with us
[2:00:36] next week so remember all those who
[2:00:38] pressed the prayer she was going through
[2:00:40] on Sunday I went with him I doubt it
[2:00:43] this would be the airport but
[2:00:46] anyway so Lord richly bless you amen God
[2:00:51] is good to you amen amen good to see
[2:00:53] everyone again so we'll just be
[2:00:55] dismissed in a word of Prayer
