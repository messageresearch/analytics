[10:22] [Music]
[10:30] is
[10:33] [Music]
[10:44] is
[10:47] [Music]
[10:58] is
[11:01] [Music]
[11:18] [Music]
[11:20] thank you jesus one day soon amen
[11:24] yes i'll just go ahead and read over the
[11:26] prayer requests i didn't
[11:28] see him in the back but i didn't have it
[11:29] out there for very long so
[11:31] i'll read one from sister no i'm the
[11:33] normal here
[11:34] she says that she needs a healing touch
[11:36] and also also is asking
[11:39] to agree with her in prayer for her
[11:40] friend um
[11:42] a drug dealer neighborhood to move away
[11:44] i'm assuming for
[11:46] the problem to move away from okay
[11:49] so i definitely want to remember that
[11:51] for the people to move on yes exactly
[11:53] yes
[11:53] okay definitely amen anyone else have a
[11:57] prayer request they'd like to make known
[11:59] yes
[12:00] so i just kind of wanted to give
[12:02] everybody an update um
[12:04] the lawyer submitted the response to the
[12:06] summons
[12:07] and even though we have until april 2nd
[12:10] i didn't realize
[12:11] that being rural arkansas they don't do
[12:14] anything electronic
[12:16] so the only electronic that they do do
[12:19] is facts
[12:20] so he told me to check back with him
[12:22] next thursday because i'm
[12:24] of course right if they don't receive
[12:26] the response then we lose by default
[12:28] so um he said to check back with him
[12:32] next thursday
[12:33] and he said that if we don't see it in
[12:34] the court system then
[12:36] he'll fax it over but i think that's
[12:38] what's causing the most anxiety
[12:40] um my dad's not doing real well so this
[12:43] is really really affecting him so if you
[12:45] could please just i'll keep it in prayer
[12:47] that
[12:48] everything just goes smooth with it and
[12:50] my dad's nerves will calm down
[13:00] i'm bringing up derek again um wednesday
[13:03] he has a meeting his
[13:06] um he was told he had until april 5th
[13:08] and then they cut it back to
[13:09] march 28th that he has to be out of the
[13:12] mental health facility
[13:14] halfway house between the hospital and
[13:17] the community
[13:19] it's his drugs he's got some kind of
[13:20] adrenal thing where it
[13:22] messes up up really bad and and he can't
[13:25] hardly think he's
[13:26] adhd and he you know he you know
[13:30] so um if so all these problems
[13:34] that he has as a result of all that and
[13:37] and
[13:39] the reason i'm bringing him up is
[13:40] because
[13:42] on wednesday um there's gonna be
[13:45] i'm on the care team so i'll be meeting
[13:48] with him
[13:49] and derek asked me specifically a couple
[13:51] days ago will i please
[13:53] be there because he knows that his life
[13:56] is on the line right now
[13:57] if they put him away in that mental
[13:59] institution
[14:01] as a ward of the state it's over i don't
[14:04] even think he can have his ukulele that
[14:06] he's learning to play
[14:08] because it might because of the fear of
[14:11] self-harm
[14:13] and somebody else might pick it up and
[14:15] harm themselves who does have that
[14:16] but he doesn't have any self-harm
[14:18] fantasies you know
[14:20] any more than the rest of us ever have
[14:22] but
[14:23] um he's just you know it's it'll be the
[14:25] end of the line for him
[14:27] he was so um the only thing
[14:31] is i can't find a place nobody will take
[14:34] him
[14:34] in they don't have an extra bed he can't
[14:37] couch surf anywhere he can't
[14:39] there's no place for him to go nobody
[14:41] will rent in because
[14:42] his mother refuses to pay the eviction
[14:44] of 2000 it isn't that she just refuses
[14:47] she doesn't have the money
[14:48] she gets a thousand dollars a month to
[14:50] live on plus food stamps
[14:53] and and so and she still can't get her
[14:55] car out hot so
[14:56] i'm just if anybody if you know of
[15:00] anybody that might have a
[15:02] a spare couch i i got the i so we just
[15:04] need that in prayer
[15:06] you know for to help i'm going to go to
[15:09] them and ask them
[15:11] i'm gonna go see if i can buy a trailer
[15:13] pay a hundred dollars a month off of it
[15:15] and so he'll have a place to live and
[15:18] because he'll pay that
[15:19] he's desperate he he will stand on his
[15:23] head
[15:23] and and you know shake it out of his
[15:25] pockets
[15:26] to pay for that and so
[15:29] you know um so i'm going to go look for
[15:31] a trailer today
[15:34] and if any of you all know of what
[15:36] somebody's got a little trailer to sell
[15:39] my car will pull 3 500 pounds
[15:42] and so i could load you know
[15:46] so i get him a little place out here
[15:48] i've seen him for as low as
[15:51] almost 200. i'm not going to go on
[15:54] anymore i could but i'm not going to
[15:57] um i just
[16:00] he needs a place to live so they have
[16:03] some place to release him too
[16:06] and if he's got his own little trailer
[16:08] then
[16:09] nobody can say no you can't rent here
[16:11] because you have an eviction
[16:13] and i can find somebody that's got a
[16:14] driveway or something that they're
[16:16] renting out and
[16:17] and you know his name was derek right
[16:19] derek right i mean i can even find a
[16:21] vacation
[16:22] place you know that he could stay for a
[16:24] couple weeks until
[16:26] the death settles you know so i need
[16:29] somebody to help me
[16:31] to get this thing built and
[16:34] to um that's got any kind of carpentry
[16:37] skills
[16:38] i'm going to have um ask try house if
[16:40] they because i know he's building up
[16:42] there so i know he's got outlets and
[16:44] stuff going into the yard so we could
[16:45] pull that thing up there
[16:46] and slam that thing together you know in
[16:49] a couple days
[16:50] and you know if it's just a shell and
[16:52] you can throw a mattress down on the
[16:54] floor
[16:54] that'd be really good you know at least
[16:57] you'd have a place to go and then we
[16:59] could do the finish up
[17:00] finish work later but anybody that could

[29:11] appreciate the lord's goodness
[29:14] being able to know that if we cry unto
[29:15] him that he is more than faithful to
[29:17] deliver
[29:19] amen as david found out when he's saying
[29:21] that himself
[29:22] amen we can stand in the presence of the
[29:24] lord and know and trust
[29:26] that his hand is upon us continually
[29:28] amen
[29:29] praise the lord jesus let's stand to our
[29:31] feet if we could we'll go to the
[29:32] scripture now
[29:37] amen i never i guess i've never been in
[29:40] the situation to where i feel
[29:43] um anxious to
[29:47] vacate the room or finish so we can
[29:50] vacate the room and
[29:53] it's just different for me so i i'm i'm
[29:55] used to just preaching and
[29:57] saying whatever the lord puts on my
[29:58] heart for as long as he puts it on there
[30:01] but we have a little bit of different
[30:04] scenario going
[30:05] uh right now but just believing and
[30:07] trusting is temporary
[30:08] amen and hopefully the lord willing soon
[30:10] as i'll explain it through the service
[30:12] here
[30:13] um here we can be able to occupy our
[30:16] new place the lord willing to just trust
[30:19] him for that
[30:20] but now let's turn our bibles if we

[32:58] and in him is no darkness at all
[33:00] if we say that we have fellowship with
[33:02] him and walk in darkness we lie
[33:05] and do not the truth if we walk in the
[33:07] light as he is in the light we have
[33:09] fellowship one with another
[33:11] the blood of jesus christ clint his son
[33:14] cleanseth us
[33:15] from all sin praise the lord
[33:18] if we say that we have no sin we deceive
[33:21] ourselves and the truth is not in us if
[33:23] we confess
[33:24] our sins he is faithful and just forgive
[33:27] us
[33:27] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[33:30] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[33:33] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[33:35] word is not in us
[33:36] you can be seated if you like amen we
[33:40] looked at that cleansing part again we
[33:42] talked about that had the subject to
[33:44] title that cleansing
[33:45] uh we did a part last week and obviously
[33:48] with our
[33:49] a little bit of time constraint i
[33:51] probably could have finished it last
[33:52] week but
[33:53] i just don't want to run over our time
[33:56] so
[33:58] this is like i said about the place i
[34:00] found and
[34:01] and within a price range it was
[34:04] acceptable and also
[34:05] i don't want to take advantage of that
[34:07] so we just split it up and
[34:09] just dive right back into this cleansing
[34:11] part again
[34:12] amen which is very important and we
[34:14] talked about last week that cleansing
[34:16] the cleansing that jesus christ gives
[34:18] and the blood of jesus christ you know
[34:20] we're entering into
[34:21] another easter time another easter
[34:23] season is just two weeks from today
[34:25] and uh that blood of jesus christ that
[34:27] still sits there i believe
[34:29] still sets that on that mercy seat was
[34:31] shed so they can breed cleansing
[34:33] that's why then if we confess our faults
[34:35] we confess our sin
[34:37] he is just and faithful to forgive our
[34:39] sin and to cleanse
[34:40] us from all unrighteousness amen now
[34:44] you know we talked about last week your
[34:45] brother green talked about the
[34:47] 119 or first john 1 9 being the
[34:50] emergency 9-1-1 call if you're in
[34:52] trouble and you have an emergency you
[34:54] dial 9-1-1 on the phone
[34:56] uh if you're in desperate need of
[34:58] something in your life for lord jesus to
[35:00] cleanse you
[35:01] to wipe your sins away that that first
[35:03] john 1 9 is the prescription to do it
[35:05] but i want to understand something here
[35:07] now that's not a get out of jail free
[35:09] card
[35:10] as people would try to use it as yes it
[35:13] does cleanse us
[35:14] yes it does set us free amen but we
[35:17] don't take that as a liberty to continue
[35:19] to sin
[35:20] or to continue our lives in
[35:22] unrighteousness
[35:23] amen we we work upon the blood of jesus
[35:27] christ to send our lives to continue to
[35:28] press the battle and
[35:30] and live for christ and to do the best
[35:32] that we can according to his word
[35:34] and live as clean a life as we possibly
[35:37] can
[35:37] by the scripture we don't take first
[35:40] john one night
[35:41] and just say well uh you know i just do
[35:43] all this
[35:44] purposeful stuff in my life i just go
[35:47] out and sin purposefully because i know
[35:48] god will forgive me
[35:50] you know it doesn't work that way you
[35:51] know in romans
[35:53] he said well if the grace of god abound
[35:56] the more the sin there is the more grace
[35:58] god
[35:58] made the more grace of god there is that
[36:00] is true but that doesn't mean that you
[36:02] go out
[36:03] and then paul just said well then we
[36:04] should we just continue to sin he said
[36:06] god forbid
[36:07] that's not the point amen the point is
[36:09] to come to christ
[36:11] for the blood of jesus christ to cleanse
[36:13] you of all unrighteousness
[36:14] that water that we talked about last
[36:16] week is a continually washing
[36:18] that keeps us clean all the time that's
[36:21] why the blood and the water came out of
[36:23] the side of christ brother brown talked
[36:24] about the representation
[36:26] of the bride that came out of him at
[36:27] that time but that blood and water
[36:29] represented that cleansing
[36:31] and the continual process of cleansing
[36:34] it wasn't just a one-time thing that god
[36:36] cleanses
[36:37] and all of a sudden you're just a center
[36:39] again no it's a cleansing and to make
[36:41] you free
[36:42] but that you continually stay free by
[36:45] the washing of the water of the word
[36:47] that keeps you clean in him and as you
[36:49] continue to keep that before you and
[36:51] that token on display
[36:53] it keeps your life in a place to where
[36:55] you live
[36:56] a godly life above and beyond
[36:59] all of the rest of the world that's why
[37:01] you look different act different
[37:03] don't do things the rest of the world
[37:04] does because you're not a part of the
[37:06] world
[37:07] amen you've called out of the world as
[37:09] the bride is called out of a church
[37:11] you've been called out be not partaker
[37:13] of her sin now
[37:14] let's go back to uh for uh numbers
[37:17] chapter 12
[37:19] and we'll talk just for a minute again
[37:21] and background
[37:22] uh what miriam went through when she
[37:25] spoke against moses
[37:26] when she spoke against moses we realized
[37:29] that last week through the scripture
[37:30] that god
[37:31] struck her with leprosy because she
[37:33] spoke against
[37:35] god's servants she spoke against god's
[37:37] prophet
[37:38] if you don't do that amen right uh that
[37:40] that's dangerous territory when you
[37:42] begin to speak about god's prophet when
[37:44] you begin to
[37:45] be derogatory about the message or god's
[37:47] word or god's prophet you're walking on
[37:49] dangerous territory
[37:51] i've heard testimony and stories of
[37:53] people that have mocked even
[37:55] the picture of the pillar of fire and
[37:56] dropped dead immediately
[37:58] just from mocking that pillar of fire
[38:00] well you know
[38:02] yes brother branham's in that picture
[38:04] but the most prominent person in that
[38:06] picture is not brother randall right
[38:08] it's the lord jesus amen and when you're
[38:10] mocking one you're mocking the other so
[38:13] miriam found that out rather quickly so
[38:15] let's drop down
[38:16] last week we read all of chapter 12. but
[38:18] let's drop down to the 13th first
[38:20] because uh
[38:21] i want to feed off of this for the next
[38:23] part of what i want to get to
[38:25] that i could have gotten to again last
[38:26] week but it just didn't feel the liberty
[38:28] to do so
[38:29] because i wanted to make sure to have
[38:31] the liberty to express
[38:33] uh the next part of this uh freely the
[38:35] way
[38:36] the lord put it on my heart so numbers
[38:38] chapter 12 verse 13.
[38:41] so moses so miriam struck with leprosy
[38:45] and moses her brother cried unto the
[38:47] lord saying
[38:48] he'll uh heal her now oh god i beseech
[38:51] thee
[38:52] and the lord said unto moses if her
[38:54] father but had but spit in her face
[38:56] should she not be ashamed seven days let
[39:00] her be shut
[39:00] out from the camp seven days and after
[39:03] that let her be received in again
[39:06] in other words that sin remember the
[39:08] leprosy representing sin
[39:10] had to be separated out of the camp for
[39:12] the completion
[39:14] of the duration of god's word god's word
[39:17] said seven days
[39:18] seven is completion the sin had to be
[39:21] removed from the rest of the
[39:23] congregation
[39:24] she had to be taken out and separated
[39:26] apart she could not be a part
[39:28] of the people any longer she had to be a
[39:30] separate part because
[39:32] that sin you didn't want that sin to
[39:34] become contagious to the rest of the
[39:36] people that were there
[39:37] so she had to be removed and put out for
[39:40] seven days
[39:41] and after the seven days she was to be
[39:43] what
[39:44] clean god was to cleanse her clean her
[39:48] of that of that of indiscretion of that
[39:51] sin
[39:52] and once that sin was eradicated she was
[39:54] able to come back into the camp again
[39:56] she was able to come back into
[39:58] fellowship
[39:59] with those of her brothers and sisters
[40:01] and those that was around her see
[40:03] so after that seven days she was clean
[40:05] she was to be received and again
[40:07] marion was shut out from the camp seven
[40:09] days and the people journeyed not
[40:11] till miriam was brought in again and
[40:13] afterward the people were moved from
[40:15] hezeroth and pitched in the wilderness
[40:17] of heyram so that
[40:18] seven days is that completion or that
[40:21] period of time that god had set
[40:23] as we know by the bible's numerology
[40:26] that had been set for her
[40:28] to be able to be out from the camp to to
[40:31] complete that cleansing process now you
[40:34] say why did god choose threes why did
[40:36] god choose fives why did god choose them
[40:39] i don't know that's just up to him i
[40:41] just know that through the scripture and
[40:43] of course brother adam teaches us
[40:44] and those numerologies that god works in
[40:47] those numbers
[40:48] and those uh variables as god does the
[40:51] three is perfection and five is grace
[40:53] seven is completion and
[40:55] on and so on and so forth so god chose
[40:57] to do that so when god chose for her to
[41:00] be
[41:00] cleansed it was the seven day process
[41:03] that she was to
[41:05] reach that place now we've come through
[41:08] seven church ages from the time of jesus
[41:11] christ's death and the day of pentecost
[41:14] till now we've come through those seven
[41:15] church ages
[41:17] and that bride that was birthed forth
[41:19] there at the day of pentecost
[41:21] had to go into the ground as we know and
[41:23] had to die out and to be re
[41:25] uh to be received back again and grow
[41:27] back to a new life again through
[41:30] uh justification sanctification the
[41:32] baptism of the holy ghost which brings
[41:34] christ himself brother brown teaches us
[41:37] that baptism of the holy ghost
[41:39] brings christ himself which is christ in
[41:42] you
[41:42] the hope of glory through that seven day
[41:45] process
[41:45] now there's that completion of that
[41:48] bride
[41:49] and we are at the end of that seven-day
[41:51] process and we all know that
[41:53] amen we all know that we're at the end
[41:55] of that seven-day process right so
[41:57] the completion of that has brought this
[41:59] bride to that
[42:01] being cleansed to that finished product
[42:05] to where this last day bride this last
[42:07] day alive and remain group
[42:09] is going to be the ones to catch a
[42:10] rapture to be caught away
[42:13] because god has completed her god has
[42:16] brought her to that place of fulfillment
[42:18] of completion in him
[42:19] and now it's time for her to go home
[42:22] praise the lord
[42:23] so that's today do we live now at that
[42:25] time
[42:26] now i want to go to psalms chapter 51.
[42:30] and i want to go through david's prayer
[42:32] here we're going to read all of 51 it's
[42:35] not very long it's
[42:36] uh 19 verses but we'll read all of it
[42:39] and look at this process that david goes
[42:42] through
[42:42] that he talks about uh when he was in
[42:45] distress
[42:46] when david was in trouble when he needed
[42:50] something as as uh the song that
[42:53] that zach sang last
[42:57] amen created me a clean heart renewal
[42:59] right spirit within me
[43:01] amen david was the apple of god's eye
[43:05] the bible says that he was a man after
[43:08] his own heart
[43:10] and being a man after his own heart
[43:12] didn't mean that david was perfect
[43:14] it didn't mean that david was sinless
[43:16] right it didn't mean that david never
[43:18] did anything wrong or would never
[43:20] again do anything wrong we know that
[43:22] david
[43:23] did one of the most egregious things
[43:25] that a human can do
[43:27] he had another person killed murdered
[43:30] now he did it indirectly he didn't do it
[43:32] by taking a knife or a sword or whatever
[43:34] and killing the man
[43:35] but he sent the man out into the heat of
[43:37] a battle knowing
[43:39] that he would be killed which is the
[43:40] exact same thing
[43:42] that saul tried to do to him to get him
[43:44] killed
[43:45] you remember that you remember when saul
[43:47] was trying to get rid of david
[43:49] and saul sent david out and he asked
[43:51] david to
[43:53] that if he wanted to have his daughter
[43:55] the dowry for his daughter was 200
[43:58] 200 philistine foreskin right
[44:01] well you figure if he's going to collect
[44:03] 200 philistine foreskin in the middle of
[44:06] this whole
[44:07] battle and all that surely somebody will
[44:09] kill david because that was
[44:10] saul's whole motive was to kill david
[44:13] david did the exact same thing
[44:15] in the discretion of taking bathsheba
[44:19] unto her unto himself as his wife
[44:22] and and got in in trouble by it that he
[44:26] had to try to kill uriah
[44:28] to cover his indiscretion right you
[44:30] think how could this be a man after
[44:32] god's own heart
[44:33] because that wasn't the part that god
[44:35] was looking at right
[44:36] that wasn't the part that god was
[44:38] concerned with the man after god's own
[44:41] heart is
[44:42] in my opinion personified
[44:45] in the in psalms 51 this was the heart
[44:49] of david
[44:50] this psalm 51 is why in my opinion
[44:53] is why david was a man after god's own
[44:56] heart
[44:57] now look at it we'll go through this
[44:58] process too and recognize this
[45:01] seven days that that god had established
[45:04] for that healing and for
[45:06] for miriam in that seven days to be shut
[45:09] out from the camp
[45:10] to bring that cleansing that seven days
[45:14] of miriam and the process of psalms 51
[45:18] so let's read it psalms 51
[45:21] have mercy upon me o god
[45:25] according to thy loving kindness
[45:27] according unto the multitude of thy
[45:30] tender mercies blot
[45:32] out my transgressions now notice this
[45:36] because this is completely contrary
[45:40] to how saul acted with god now you say
[45:43] well saul did the same thing
[45:45] david did the same thing as saul tried
[45:47] to do to him
[45:48] but yet saul was not the man after god's
[45:51] own heart but david was
[45:53] but see you notice just in this first
[45:56] verse
[45:57] the verbiage and the heart of david
[45:59] speaking to his maker speaking to god
[46:04] have mercy on me with loving kindness
[46:07] according to your multitude of your
[46:09] mercies that blot out my transgressions
[46:12] saul did not do that when saul was found
[46:15] guilty of his
[46:17] by his transgressions he doubled down
[46:20] and tried to make excuse for what he was
[46:22] doing wrong
[46:24] he didn't ask forgiveness he wasn't
[46:26] contrite
[46:27] he wasn't humble he didn't ask god for
[46:29] forgiveness
[46:30] he didn't even give god any sort of
[46:33] praise
[46:34] which is what david is doing here right
[46:36] he just doubled down and said oh well
[46:38] this is their fault all of this that
[46:39] fall well
[46:41] oh okay i you know i've received i'm
[46:44] guilty i'm sorry let's just move on with
[46:45] life it doesn't work that way
[46:48] it doesn't work that way god's looking
[46:49] for humility god's looking for a
[46:51] contrite heart
[46:53] this is exactly what god loved in david
[46:56] so much he knew david was going to make
[46:58] mistakes friends just like he knows that
[47:00] we're going to make mistakes
[47:01] we're going to slip up and do things
[47:03] that we don't want to do that we know we
[47:05] shouldn't do
[47:06] but in our hearts we cry out to god as
[47:08] soon as you come to yourself
[47:10] you say god forgive me i didn't mean to
[47:12] do that god forgive me that wasn't me
[47:15] i just got caught in a trap or that
[47:17] enemy come and persuaded or something
[47:19] got a hold of me something happened lord
[47:21] forgive me cleanse me of all
[47:24] unrighteousness lord
[47:25] forgive me of my sin you come to god and
[47:28] you believe in and by that humble heart
[47:30] by that control that's what god's
[47:32] looking for
[47:33] because that's the same heart of god
[47:36] that heart is the heart that was in
[47:37] david it wasn't in saul
[47:39] saul was just rebellious as ever i mean
[47:42] saul's rebellion led him to go to
[47:44] witchcraft
[47:46] which you know samuel told him that he
[47:48] would do
[47:49] because he said the sin of rebellion is
[47:51] as the sin of witchcraft that's what
[47:52] saul
[47:53] as what samuel told him it's the sin of
[47:55] witchcraft if you act this way
[47:57] and that's exactly what saul ended up
[47:59] doing
[48:00] he went to the witch of endor to call
[48:02] samuel up from the dead
[48:03] performing wickery witchcraft
[48:07] that was south that was saul amen that
[48:11] was saul's heart
[48:12] but look at david's heart have
[48:15] mercy on me oh god amen how many of you
[48:19] ever cried that to the lord
[48:21] have mercy on me lord yes amen
[48:24] you look in the bible you see that man
[48:26] and this as brother branham describes
[48:28] that
[48:29] pompous man i believe he said matthew
[48:30] comes out and says oh i thank you god
[48:33] that i'm not like this peasant over here
[48:35] and i pray that you'd forgive me and
[48:38] that peasant's down there beating on his
[48:40] chest saying
[48:40] god oh forgive me a sinner cleanse me
[48:43] and wipe my sin away lord he said now
[48:45] which would you rather be
[48:47] right which one do you think god's
[48:48] accepted no i'm so glad i'm not like him
[48:52] are you that man are you that one that's
[48:54] crying out to god lord forgive me i'm
[48:56] sorry
[48:56] yes sir lord i repent lord
[49:00] wash my sin away annihilate them put
[49:02] them in the sea of forgetfulness lord
[49:04] amen that's david have mercy on me
[49:07] according to my loving kindness
[49:10] according to the murder of the multitude
[49:12] of thy tender mercies
[49:13] blot out my transgressions continue to
[49:17] read now look at this
[49:18] wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity
[49:22] and cleanse me from my sin for i
[49:25] acknowledge my transgressions and my sin
[49:28] is ever before me now there you go
[49:32] someone willing to admit someone willing
[49:35] to acknowledge
[49:37] now remember one of the very first
[49:39] things that even the world will teach
[49:41] you
[49:42] even the uh alcoholics anonymous and
[49:45] and places like that will tell you
[49:47] acknowledgement
[49:48] is the first step to being cured
[49:52] you have to admit right that's why uh uh
[49:56] in aaa you have to go and say uh my name
[49:59] is so-and-so i'm an alcoholic
[50:00] and you may not have had a drink of
[50:02] alcohol for 20 years but
[50:03] that's the res that's what they recite
[50:05] every time they go into their meeting
[50:07] i i'm so-and-so and i'm an alcoholic
[50:10] hadn't had a drink in 20 years
[50:12] but i'm so-and-so and i'm an alcoholic
[50:14] it's the first
[50:15] step to cure is acknowledging there's a
[50:17] problem right
[50:18] you have to first acknowledge and
[50:20] recognize i have a problem
[50:22] i need help and there's no shame in that
[50:24] friend right
[50:25] there's no shame in having an issue in
[50:27] life
[50:28] that's why the bible says that we are to
[50:30] confess our faults
[50:32] we are to confess those things so god so
[50:34] people can pray for us
[50:36] so that we can bring this before the
[50:38] lord so we can bring this before the
[50:39] faithful people
[50:40] that pray for you and hold you before
[50:43] the lord and say god deliver them
[50:45] and you be that one god forgive me see
[50:48] there's nothing wrong with that
[50:50] that's how you reach the place of being
[50:52] cleansed
[50:53] that's how you reach the place of purity
[50:56] because there's first
[50:57] acknowledgement david said i acknowledge
[50:59] my transgression and my
[51:01] sin is ever before me in other words i
[51:05] know what i did
[51:06] and i know that what i did will haunt my
[51:08] dreams my memory for the rest of my life
[51:11] amen i i you know that because it
[51:15] happens to you
[51:17] right now you know that because the
[51:18] things that you've done wrong
[51:20] recently in the past in your old life
[51:22] the devil continually brings to you
[51:25] right and reminds you of those oh you
[51:27] remember how you used to be you remember
[51:29] what you did
[51:30] you remember how you acted or said over
[51:32] here the devil was always going to bring
[51:34] that before you
[51:36] david acknowledges that i acknowledge my
[51:39] sin and recognize that my
[51:40] my transgression recognize my sin as
[51:43] ever before me
[51:44] amen but understanding now
[51:48] that even though satan tries to bring
[51:50] that all back up to you again
[51:53] you can put it in the face david
[51:54] couldn't do this
[51:56] he know that god was forgiving of his
[51:58] sin
[51:59] or or he was covering it up but
[52:02] we know now that but that by the blood
[52:05] of jesus christ
[52:07] that thing is not before you yes it
[52:09] might come back into your spirit
[52:11] your memory but it is not before you
[52:14] because it's under the blood of christ
[52:16] and annihilated never to be remembered
[52:19] in the mind of god again
[52:21] praise the lord god justified as if
[52:25] though you had
[52:26] never done it in the first place amen
[52:30] talk about cleansing friend talk about
[52:33] cleansing
[52:34] david acknowledge i acknowledge my
[52:36] transgression
[52:38] amen we're continuing on with this first
[52:40] step now we're still just in the first
[52:41] day
[52:43] and this is come on i wanted to put this
[52:45] over into this week i didn't want to
[52:46] rush through this
[52:48] we're still in the first day okay
[52:51] i acknowledge my transgressions my
[52:53] center before me against thee
[52:55] the only have i sinned and done this
[52:58] evil in thy
[52:59] sight that thou mightest be justified
[53:02] when thou
[53:03] speakest and be clear when thou judges
[53:06] behold i was shaken in iniquity and
[53:09] in sin did my mother conceive me now
[53:12] brother branham
[53:13] that's better known as we verbalize it
[53:16] and the message is
[53:18] we're born and sin shaped iniquity come
[53:20] the world speaking lines it's kind of
[53:21] something that uh
[53:22] we speak fairly freely that you say that
[53:25] we say i was born in sin
[53:27] shape iniquity come to the world
[53:28] speaking lies this is the scripture
[53:30] that that comes from that david
[53:33] acknowledging i was shaping iniquity and
[53:35] didn't sin did my mother conceive me
[53:38] look what brother adam said in thinking
[53:39] man's filter
[53:41] and thinking mansfield he said when you
[53:42] come into this world you were born in
[53:44] sin
[53:46] you didn't even come with a fighting
[53:48] chance
[53:49] he says not even with a fighting chance
[53:53] you were born in sin shaped iniquity
[53:55] come the world speaking lies within your
[53:57] own
[53:58] spirit the desire of sin
[54:01] a lover of sin your own nature
[54:05] commanded you to sin ephesians 2 tells
[54:08] us
[54:08] you were by nature the children of wrath
[54:11] you loved it
[54:12] you wanted to sin it was a part of you
[54:15] that's why we read last week or talked
[54:17] about first john 3 that says
[54:18] if you are born again of god
[54:21] then you cannot sin because there's no
[54:24] longer a love for sin there's no longer
[54:26] a desire for sin
[54:28] when god comes in and he burns that old
[54:30] nature out and takes the resonance of
[54:32] your soul
[54:33] it is completely done and away with yeah
[54:36] now
[54:38] you're born again you can you don't have
[54:41] a desire to sin anymore you don't have a
[54:43] desire to do the things of the world
[54:45] you don't have a desire to or a lover of
[54:48] sin as he says here
[54:51] because you were born in sin you didn't
[54:53] have a chance
[54:54] but down on the inside of you somewhere
[54:57] is where you come
[54:59] praise the lord that seed of god was
[55:01] always there again first john 3
[55:04] that seed of god that was always there
[55:06] yes dormant for a while by
[55:08] predestination
[55:09] god placed in you that was always there
[55:13] he said down on the inside of you
[55:15] somewhere is where you come
[55:17] there was something in there that began
[55:19] to draw
[55:20] if you know there was something that
[55:22] told you you were there was a god
[55:24] somewhere
[55:25] you began to read his word you went to
[55:27] church you
[55:28] took the ideas you was told uh was
[55:31] better than
[55:32] then then you never use the thinking
[55:35] man's filter but when god
[55:37] when you use god's filter which is a
[55:39] thinking man's filter because all other
[55:41] filters pass away mine shall not
[55:43] when you take god's filter and draw your
[55:45] life your desires it draws your desires
[55:48] through god's filter his word
[55:51] now if you take those desires and you
[55:54] draw through
[55:55] god's word they're going to be pure
[55:58] they're going to be right they're not
[56:00] going to be things that are going to be
[56:01] frivolous or things of the world or
[56:03] things that are of sin it's going to be
[56:06] things that are of righteousness
[56:07] because nothing else will draw through
[56:09] this filter
[56:11] nothing else will draw through this word
[56:14] uh we went picked up sister matisse
[56:15] today and
[56:16] we were listening to a little music on
[56:18] the radio there was a song that come on
[56:20] there
[56:21] and there's a little part of that song
[56:23] which i understood and i got the point
[56:25] they were trying to make
[56:26] but it didn't draw through this filter
[56:29] and i looked over at my wife and i said
[56:31] that's wrong
[56:32] and she said well what do you mean i
[56:34] said did you not hear the lyric i guess
[56:35] they weren't listening as good as i was
[56:38] i love music i listen i like music i
[56:40] don't listen to it like the world does
[56:42] it buds in years all the time but anyway
[56:44] i like good gospel christian music i
[56:46] love to sing it hear it anyway
[56:48] and i was listening and i heard that
[56:50] lyric and i'll tell you what the lyric
[56:52] was it said
[56:53] it was it was speaking from jesus point
[56:55] of view and it said i didn't cry because
[56:58] lazarus died i cried when i knew i had
[57:02] to bring him back
[57:04] and i thought well that's a nice
[57:06] sentiment and i understand that
[57:08] because he's better off on the other
[57:09] side than he is in this world
[57:11] correct we all understand that so i get
[57:13] the premise but that's completely
[57:15] unscriptural
[57:16] that's not what the bible says and that
[57:19] is not what brother brown said what was
[57:21] the
[57:21] the dramatization that he gave his good
[57:24] friend had just passed
[57:26] away and the human part of jesus was sad
[57:28] and cried
[57:29] yeah not because he was sad he was gonna
[57:31] have to bring him back i said that is so
[57:33] unscriptural i mean you just take even
[57:35] brother branham's
[57:36] uh dramatization out of it it's not
[57:38] scriptural right
[57:39] it didn't draw through god's filter and
[57:41] i looked and said
[57:42] and we talked about it for a few minutes
[57:44] i said i understand what he's saying
[57:46] and i agree with the premise but this
[57:48] but he's wrong according to scripture
[57:50] right i said and i just have a little
[57:51] hang up when it comes to what's against
[57:53] the scripture it's got to be the pure
[57:55] word to me
[57:56] period i don't care if it's just half a
[57:58] lyric in a song
[57:59] it's got to be scripture to me but it
[58:03] caught my attention i said that's not
[58:04] right
[58:05] that's not scripture it doesn't draw
[58:06] through that filter see
[58:08] and if you are that filter now because
[58:10] you've become the word then it doesn't
[58:12] draw through you
[58:13] you say now that something gets hung in
[58:14] there says no that's not right
[58:16] amen no matter what it is could be the
[58:18] lyric in the song could be something
[58:20] that somebody's trying to get you to do
[58:21] or tell you or something
[58:22] or the devil's trying to sway you a
[58:24] certain way and say oh no no that
[58:26] that's just hanging up in my spirit
[58:27] something's not right there
[58:29] that's that thinking man's filter only
[58:32] thing brother man says it draws your
[58:34] desires
[58:35] at thinking man's filter there is
[58:36] nothing left but the holy ghost
[58:39] amen amen nothing left but the holy
[58:41] ghost the pure word
[58:42] that's all that can be left you can take
[58:44] all these gifts and all these everything
[58:46] it's got to drop through the word friend
[58:48] if it doesn't draw through the word
[58:50] something's wrong with it let's continue
[58:52] on now
[58:53] i was shape and iniquity and in sin did
[58:56] my mother conceive
[58:57] me behold thou desirest truth in the
[59:00] inward parts and in the hidden part thou
[59:02] shalt make me known uh make me uh to
[59:05] know wisdom
[59:06] now that's that's the first day that's
[59:09] day number one
[59:10] that's an acknowledgement of sin and sin
[59:13] being judged that's that has to be the
[59:17] first acknowledgement now god hasn't
[59:19] responded anything
[59:20] you understand this is just the
[59:23] beginning
[59:24] this is just day one god forgive me i
[59:26] acknowledge i was wrong
[59:28] i acknowledge my sin i i i recognize
[59:32] that the uh that i've done wrong cleanse
[59:34] me lord
[59:36] uh wipe my slate clean take it
[59:39] take thy sin and annihilate it from me
[59:42] lord
[59:43] that's the first step amen has to be the
[59:45] first step sin
[59:46] that is judged yet that is acknowledged
[59:49] and judged
[59:50] now look at part set verse seven day two
[59:54] purge me with hyssop and i shall be
[59:57] clean and remember we talked about his
[59:59] last week that very very common weed
[1:00:02] that was there that represented
[1:00:03] simplicity or humility
[1:00:05] hyssop you notice many times when god
[1:00:08] talks about
[1:00:09] applying the blood has to be applied
[1:00:11] with a simple faith
[1:00:12] has to be applied with the humility amen
[1:00:16] just as he did on the doorpost of the
[1:00:18] lentil when the death angel came through
[1:00:20] just as moses came and sprinkled as we
[1:00:22] talked about last week
[1:00:23] sprinkled the people and sprinkled the
[1:00:25] book and sprinkled the instruments with
[1:00:27] the blood and the water
[1:00:28] had to be done with the hyssop had to be
[1:00:31] in simplicity
[1:00:32] humility see simplicity faith
[1:00:36] purge me now that's that faith that's
[1:00:38] that simplicity his
[1:00:40] and i shall be clean wash me amen
[1:00:43] wash me and i shall be clean
[1:00:49] i shall be clean wash me and i shall be
[1:00:51] whiter than snow
[1:00:52] now we've reached a cleansing of
[1:00:55] forgiveness
[1:00:56] amen because first of all he says purge
[1:01:00] me
[1:01:00] with thy hyssa that's that forgiveness
[1:01:03] cleansing so that he's whiter than snow
[1:01:07] now just within that verse you've got
[1:01:10] two separate days
[1:01:12] you've got a forgiveness so so so far
[1:01:15] we've got verse
[1:01:16] seven verses first six day one verse
[1:01:19] seven day two
[1:01:21] day two and three in verse seven
[1:01:24] because the first is acknowledgement
[1:01:27] second is the forgiveness third is the
[1:01:29] cleansing
[1:01:30] amen because notice the cleansing has to
[1:01:32] come
[1:01:33] after the forgiveness have you ever
[1:01:36] done something wrong to somebody or
[1:01:38] somebody done wrong done you wrong
[1:01:40] and and let's just say you've done
[1:01:42] somebody wrong and you go to that person
[1:01:44] you ask for forgiveness
[1:01:46] i acknowledge that what i did to you was
[1:01:48] wrong
[1:01:50] i i ask that you forgive me
[1:01:53] see i acknowledge it and i ask for
[1:01:56] forgiveness
[1:01:57] but then the cleansing has to come
[1:01:59] afterwards because that person has to
[1:02:02] forgive you and for there be a
[1:02:05] reinstatement of your relationship
[1:02:07] right that's that's the cleansing that
[1:02:10] forgiveness and that cleansing
[1:02:12] brings the two back into fellowship
[1:02:15] again
[1:02:16] back together again so that has to be
[1:02:19] the acknowledgement the forgiveness and
[1:02:20] the cleansing
[1:02:22] now let's go to verse 8.
[1:02:27] make me to hear joy and gladness
[1:02:30] that the bones which now has broken may
[1:02:32] rejoice
[1:02:33] hide thy face from my sins and blot out
[1:02:37] all my iniquities created me
[1:02:40] here we go create in me a clean heart o
[1:02:43] god
[1:02:44] and renew a right spirit within me
[1:02:48] cast me not away from thy presence and
[1:02:50] take not thy holy spirit
[1:02:52] from me restore unto me the joy of
[1:02:56] thy salvation amen amen not our
[1:02:59] salvation
[1:03:01] his salvation praise the lord
[1:03:04] we can ask for forgiveness but it's god
[1:03:06] that does the cleansing
[1:03:07] it's his salvation and uphold me with
[1:03:10] thy free spirit
[1:03:11] now your spirit filled amen
[1:03:14] day four a spirit feeling a presence of
[1:03:18] god
[1:03:19] coming in creating me a clean heart
[1:03:22] renew
[1:03:22] a right spirit within me take natural
[1:03:25] holy spirit from me
[1:03:27] and and uh restore to me the joy of my
[1:03:30] of thy salvation uphold within me thy
[1:03:32] free spirit
[1:03:34] god and his bringing it of his spirit
[1:03:38] into your life
[1:03:39] amen being spirit filled
[1:03:42] now you notice there's a lot that goes
[1:03:46] that we talk about with
[1:03:49] justification sanctification the holy
[1:03:51] spirit acts 2
[1:03:53] acts 2 38 specifically even where paul
[1:03:56] gets up and
[1:03:57] they want to know how do we get what you
[1:03:59] have and it's that process that he
[1:04:01] begins to explain to them now he goes
[1:04:03] through it from the very beginning
[1:04:05] when they come out and think that
[1:04:06] everyone's drunk and he says oh they're
[1:04:08] not junkies you suppose he's the third
[1:04:10] hour of the day
[1:04:11] this is what the bible says the bible
[1:04:14] says
[1:04:14] joel specifically in the scripture said
[1:04:16] this was going to happen
[1:04:18] and now it's happening before you this
[1:04:20] day that scripture is fulfilled
[1:04:23] and he began to expound to them that
[1:04:25] process
[1:04:26] what you go through what happens in life
[1:04:29] the acknowledgement the forgiveness the
[1:04:30] cleansing
[1:04:31] and then the spirit comes and sweets him
[1:04:34] amen and it fills you with his spirit
[1:04:37] with his goodness
[1:04:38] with the holy ghost amen when that holy
[1:04:41] ghost is in there
[1:04:43] then you've got a vessel that's in
[1:04:45] service
[1:04:46] you got a vessel that can be used you
[1:04:48] got a vessel that god can come
[1:04:50] and and move you and tell you to do this
[1:04:53] and go hear it
[1:04:54] and be obedient to whatever his word is
[1:04:56] for you see that's a spirit-filled
[1:04:58] person
[1:04:58] that's a person living with the token on
[1:05:00] display
[1:05:02] when that token's on display you would
[1:05:04] display to the world and to the devil
[1:05:06] that you don't belong
[1:05:07] but to god right you don't belong to the
[1:05:09] world you don't belong to the government
[1:05:10] you don't belong to the
[1:05:12] satan in the world order you belong to
[1:05:14] god you're god's cause your spirit field
[1:05:17] you've reached the place of
[1:05:19] acknowledgement of forgiveness
[1:05:21] of being cleansed and filled amen
[1:05:25] now we've gotten to day four but there's
[1:05:27] more still to the story
[1:05:29] because once you get born again you're
[1:05:32] just starting
[1:05:34] yeah we know that when you are born
[1:05:37] again
[1:05:37] you are just starting just like you're
[1:05:39] born as a little child
[1:05:41] your life's just starting
[1:05:44] your child isn't born and and as soon as
[1:05:47] it draws a breath they cut the umbilical
[1:05:48] cord and you handed the car keys
[1:05:51] it doesn't work that way it's not ready
[1:05:54] to do all those things
[1:05:56] it will be eventually but that's just
[1:05:58] the beginning and god doesn't do that to
[1:06:00] us
[1:06:01] when you're spirit-filled it's just the
[1:06:03] beginning now there's
[1:06:05] more to the story see there there's a
[1:06:07] continuation
[1:06:08] so let's go on if we can we'll finish
[1:06:12] chapter 51 then will i teach
[1:06:16] transgressors thy ways oh wow so there's
[1:06:19] something even beyond being
[1:06:20] spirit-filled
[1:06:21] i just thought i'd just get the holy
[1:06:22] ghost on the couch
[1:06:26] i just thought i'd get the holy ghost
[1:06:27] and just sit behind my desk or
[1:06:29] get the holy ghost and just live out the
[1:06:31] rest of my life oh
[1:06:32] no no no no you just got started friend
[1:06:37] amen you just began and david
[1:06:40] acknowledges that and recognizes hey
[1:06:43] i am now ready to be put in service god
[1:06:46] has filled me with his spirit it's time
[1:06:47] to do something about it
[1:06:49] so what do we do about it david said
[1:06:51] then will i teach transgressors thy ways
[1:06:55] amen how many of us do that help us lord
[1:06:58] amen
[1:07:01] then i will teach transgressors thy ways
[1:07:03] uh
[1:07:05] and sinners shall be converted unto thee
[1:07:07] now we know this is a hard day
[1:07:10] we know we're in a well brother branham
[1:07:13] said gleaning but that was 60 years ago
[1:07:16] are we still gleaning um
[1:07:20] i'll say yes because uh i believe we're
[1:07:23] supposed to feel that way until he comes
[1:07:25] even though there'll be a time where
[1:07:26] there will be no more gleaning to be
[1:07:28] done
[1:07:28] but that's not my determination that's
[1:07:30] god's determination i'll work
[1:07:32] until he takes me home right so but
[1:07:35] this transgressor part you can
[1:07:39] speak to a lot of nowadays and they've
[1:07:41] become so filthy as we talked about last
[1:07:43] week
[1:07:43] they become so perpetually filthy dirty
[1:07:46] that they don't even
[1:07:47] recognize how filthy they are they don't
[1:07:50] recognize
[1:07:52] that they need cleansing they don't
[1:07:53] recognize they need to be
[1:07:55] under the spigot they don't recognize
[1:07:57] they need to get
[1:07:58] under the fountain they don't realize
[1:08:00] how dirty and filthy they are that they
[1:08:02] need
[1:08:03] cleansing michael sent me something this
[1:08:06] week and said you know
[1:08:07] it came to him this week i was going to
[1:08:08] get him to preach it but i'll just give
[1:08:10] that a little bit to you
[1:08:12] but he said you know i was thinking
[1:08:14] about it and
[1:08:15] uh i believe he's in the shower anyway
[1:08:18] and he said yeah it's great to be under
[1:08:20] the water but you got to get the soap
[1:08:22] off the shelf and you got to use it
[1:08:24] you got to get the shampoo off the shelf
[1:08:26] and you got to use it
[1:08:28] you got to get the wash rack or whatever
[1:08:29] your process is of cleansing yourself
[1:08:31] your body
[1:08:32] physically you've got to actually be an
[1:08:35] action
[1:08:35] to do it it's great to be under the
[1:08:38] fountain and that's good
[1:08:39] you should be we all need to be trying
[1:08:42] to get as many people under that
[1:08:43] fountain as you possibly can
[1:08:44] but then they've got to actually go and
[1:08:46] get that soap they gotta actually go and
[1:08:48] get that shampoo they gotta actually go
[1:08:50] and do the process of being of cleansing
[1:08:53] and becoming clean
[1:08:55] but sometimes spiritually people are so
[1:08:58] filthy today
[1:09:00] because they're in darkness because men
[1:09:02] would rather live in darkness than
[1:09:04] light because in darkness their deeds
[1:09:06] are not exposed
[1:09:07] amen they hate light because in the
[1:09:09] light their deeds are exposed
[1:09:11] but they want to live in darkness and as
[1:09:14] they live in darkness they
[1:09:15] smell and and wreak so bad
[1:09:18] but you try to help them now this is
[1:09:21] speaking today
[1:09:22] now i'm not disagreeing with what david
[1:09:25] said here because that's still a part of
[1:09:26] our commission to do
[1:09:28] to help teach transgressors god's way
[1:09:31] and that some one maybe might come to
[1:09:34] him
[1:09:36] i told you the other day that there was
[1:09:38] a family came to our church
[1:09:40] that had just moved to florida and
[1:09:42] someone in our church had witnessed to
[1:09:44] them they started coming to church
[1:09:45] and they'd been in church i had a a a
[1:09:49] well i just i don't want to call him a
[1:09:51] scoffer but he just was kind of negative
[1:09:54] that was probably a better word negative
[1:09:56] about it oh there's nobody else to be
[1:09:57] saved
[1:09:58] you know the brother banner preach souls
[1:10:00] in prison
[1:10:01] brother branham also said what if he
[1:10:03] didn't say it is
[1:10:05] he said what if now there will be a day
[1:10:07] it will be
[1:10:08] we know that right but i thought why did
[1:10:11] you be so negative
[1:10:13] we try so hard to get other people to
[1:10:15] come to christ
[1:10:16] we try to get them to come and now we've
[1:10:18] got a whole family that's coming
[1:10:20] can we be positive about that oh we get
[1:10:21] honest nobody's they'll be gone
[1:10:23] they're still serving the lord right to
[1:10:25] my knowledge 20 years later
[1:10:27] they're still going to church still
[1:10:28] serving the lord now whether they're
[1:10:30] seed or not whether
[1:10:31] that's up to god but i know they're
[1:10:33] still going to church still still
[1:10:35] serving the lord so
[1:10:36] we can be all negative as we want but
[1:10:38] there might be one here it might be a
[1:10:40] person there it might be
[1:10:41] we don't know but the point of it is to
[1:10:44] be
[1:10:44] in service that's day five amen
[1:10:47] to be in service for the lord david said
[1:10:51] as he put it i will uh i will teach
[1:10:54] transgressors thy way and sinners shall
[1:10:57] be converted
[1:10:58] unto thee praise the lord we'll do what
[1:11:00] we can right yeah i
[1:11:02] and i don't mean to speak on his behalf
[1:11:04] but i can almost guarantee you
[1:11:06] i will guarantee you that brother tom
[1:11:09] at the gym show in the next few weeks is
[1:11:11] going to be doing that very thing to as
[1:11:13] many people as he possibly can
[1:11:15] yeah as he has expressed he gets a lot
[1:11:17] of negativity
[1:11:18] but you just never know right you don't
[1:11:21] quit doing it though do you
[1:11:23] well first of all a teen you to do it's
[1:11:26] just a part of you
[1:11:27] so if it's a part of you it's kind of
[1:11:29] like you know you just either don't say
[1:11:32] anything or you talk about the lord
[1:11:33] that's just
[1:11:34] that's your two options you talk about
[1:11:36] god or you don't talk at all that's
[1:11:38] because it's just in you it's just what
[1:11:41] you do so
[1:11:42] anyway that's part of it day four let me
[1:11:44] move on
[1:11:46] is that a couple of the scriptures i
[1:11:47] want to read amen day four now let's get
[1:11:50] to day five
[1:11:52] deliver me from blood guilt guiltiness
[1:11:56] o god thou god of my salvation and my
[1:11:59] tongue shall sing aloud of thy
[1:12:02] righteousness
[1:12:03] amen oh lord open thou
[1:12:06] my lips and my mouth shall show forth
[1:12:09] thy praise
[1:12:11] now it's service and worship
[1:12:14] now there's a worship praise the lord
[1:12:17] that we're supposed to have with the
[1:12:18] lord day six
[1:12:20] is worship for thou desirest not
[1:12:23] sacrifice else would i give it
[1:12:25] thou desires not in uh delight is not in
[1:12:28] burnt offering
[1:12:29] the sacrifices of god are a broken
[1:12:31] spirit
[1:12:32] a broken and contrite heart oh god thou
[1:12:35] will not despise
[1:12:37] that's the man after god's own heart
[1:12:41] you've never heard things like that from
[1:12:43] saul
[1:12:44] never but from the man after god's own
[1:12:47] heart you do
[1:12:49] that's why he's a man after god's own
[1:12:51] heart not because of his faults not
[1:12:52] because of best shiva not because you're
[1:12:54] right not because of things he's done
[1:12:55] wrong
[1:12:56] but because of his heart
[1:13:00] contrite humble before the lord
[1:13:04] open my lips lord and i will sing
[1:13:07] praises to you
[1:13:08] amen amen
[1:13:12] acknowledgement
[1:13:16] forgiveness
[1:13:19] spirit filled
[1:13:23] service and worship
[1:13:26] six days but that's the number of man
[1:13:30] so we got one more step here
[1:13:34] and let's see where david comes with it
[1:13:38] do good in thy good pleasure unto zion
[1:13:40] build thou the walls of jerusalem then
[1:13:43] shall thou be pleased with the
[1:13:44] sacrifices of righteousness
[1:13:47] which we offer up spiritual sacrifices
[1:13:50] of righteousness
[1:13:51] with burnt offering and whole burnt
[1:13:54] offering
[1:13:54] then shall they offer bullock upon thine
[1:13:58] altar
[1:13:58] that's a restoration of fellowship with
[1:14:00] god again
[1:14:02] that was the fellowship that god had and
[1:14:04] that restoration is exactly what god was
[1:14:06] looking for from david
[1:14:08] it's exactly what god is wanting from
[1:14:10] his children you know saints
[1:14:11] when when when adam failed when adam and
[1:14:14] eve sinned
[1:14:14] and sin was everywhere all of nature
[1:14:17] fell
[1:14:18] when adam fell everything that god
[1:14:20] created
[1:14:21] felt body life animal life and human
[1:14:24] life
[1:14:24] all fell when adam went into sin god
[1:14:27] could have wiped it clean and says you
[1:14:29] know i'll just start all over again
[1:14:32] man has done sin man has done fell into
[1:14:34] despair and degradation
[1:14:36] i just wipe them out and get rid of them
[1:14:38] off i'll just create me a new adam or
[1:14:41] create me a new
[1:14:42] beginning whatever that would be i'll
[1:14:44] just start all over
[1:14:46] well first of all god would not have
[1:14:47] been able to exercise his
[1:14:49] uh his ability to be a father
[1:14:53] his his ability to be a healer his
[1:14:55] attribute to be a savior
[1:14:58] and god then begin the process of that
[1:15:00] salvation
[1:15:01] and through the bible showing us his
[1:15:03] healing his deliverance
[1:15:05] his his uh of leadership
[1:15:09] his salvation his direction everything
[1:15:12] that god does for us every day is
[1:15:14] all through the scripture he just began
[1:15:16] there in the garden of eden
[1:15:18] well that same process we go through as
[1:15:20] individuals
[1:15:21] all the time god's just looking for the
[1:15:25] restoration of that fellowship
[1:15:27] just like he was looking for in the
[1:15:28] garden of me
[1:15:30] i know we talk about how much adam
[1:15:32] enjoyed the fellowship of god coming
[1:15:34] down in the cool of the day
[1:15:35] and then talking lift to ear because we
[1:15:38] were a part of adam we
[1:15:39] know what that means in our lives but oh
[1:15:42] don't you think god enjoyed that just as
[1:15:44] much
[1:15:46] don't you think god enjoyed that
[1:15:47] fellowship with adam just as much as
[1:15:49] adam did
[1:15:50] well don't you think god enjoys it just
[1:15:52] as much from you
[1:15:55] amen god enjoys that fellowship just as
[1:15:58] much from you
[1:15:59] as he did from adam he's enjoying that
[1:16:02] fellowship with you as much as you
[1:16:04] enjoyed the fellowship with him
[1:16:06] that's why that restoration is so
[1:16:08] important it completes that fellowship
[1:16:10] where god and man have become one again
[1:16:14] brother brahman said heaven and earth
[1:16:15] embrace one another
[1:16:17] and he's become one again god in man
[1:16:20] in fellowship in togetherness
[1:16:24] fellowship that's what god wanted he
[1:16:26] couldn't wipe them clean in the
[1:16:27] beginning but that's not what he wanted
[1:16:30] he wanted a restoration to bring him
[1:16:32] back to where they're supposed
[1:16:34] to be that's why when jesus christ died
[1:16:36] he not only
[1:16:37] uh cleansed and shed his blood for your
[1:16:40] sin but he went all the way back to adam
[1:16:42] and delivered every one of them from
[1:16:44] adam all the way through
[1:16:45] that's how he emptied out paradise gave
[1:16:49] gifts unto men and they all ascended
[1:16:50] with him as his that is
[1:16:52] ascension they were appeared unto us for
[1:16:54] a month or so
[1:16:56] amen they appeared unto many the dead in
[1:16:59] christ rose appeared unto many
[1:17:01] the bible says didn't appear unto one
[1:17:03] person
[1:17:04] it appeared they appeared unto many
[1:17:07] and then when jesus rose they went with
[1:17:09] went up to period i went
[1:17:11] and went with him amen praise the lord
[1:17:14] but god enjoys that just as much as you
[1:17:16] do god wants that fellowship
[1:17:19] god wants that restoration just as much
[1:17:21] as you do
[1:17:22] that seven steps that we go through that
[1:17:25] god desires for each of us
[1:17:27] as we come into that place of god and
[1:17:29] man coming together again
[1:17:31] amen you and god coming back into that
[1:17:34] fellowship
[1:17:35] again now let me read a couple more
[1:17:37] scriptures because i've got to
[1:17:39] close here in first timothy
[1:17:42] first timothy chapter 4 verse verse 1
[1:17:45] now the spirit speaketh expressively
[1:17:48] that in the latter times
[1:17:50] that is shall i say today i don't mean
[1:17:53] to change the word or add to it but
[1:17:55] we'll just say today latter times some
[1:17:58] shall depart from the faith that means
[1:18:02] now that's not talking about just people
[1:18:04] of the world right
[1:18:05] you understand this is people who were
[1:18:08] in the faith
[1:18:09] and left not just worldly people that
[1:18:12] were never in it
[1:18:13] this is expressing that there will be
[1:18:15] some depart
[1:18:16] that were there in the faith that depart
[1:18:19] and leave from it
[1:18:20] that's a different group amen you
[1:18:22] understand that's a different group than
[1:18:24] just the worldly people that just were
[1:18:25] never in it to begin with
[1:18:27] okay so you look i just looking at one
[1:18:29] time i looked and i said some shall
[1:18:31] some shall some how about most
[1:18:34] about 98 but see he's not talking about
[1:18:38] all those he's just talking about those
[1:18:40] that were in the faith
[1:18:41] and left shall depart from the faith
[1:18:44] giving heed to seducing spirits
[1:18:47] and doctrines of devil which is a
[1:18:48] religious spirit yeah
[1:18:51] speaking lies in hypocrisy having their
[1:18:53] conscience
[1:18:54] seared with a hot iron neck of
[1:18:58] forbidding to marry commanding to
[1:19:00] abstain from meats
[1:19:04] they want you to be a vegetarian
[1:19:06] christian a vegan as i preached one time
[1:19:08] vegan christian yeah they don't want you
[1:19:10] to have any meat of the word
[1:19:12] you just want to feed your fig leaf here
[1:19:14] there
[1:19:15] they don't want to give you the meat of
[1:19:16] the word so they they command you that
[1:19:19] you should not be eating meat amen
[1:19:22] that's what the world will tell you
[1:19:23] oh it's so horrible for you friend i'm
[1:19:25] just getting to the place i don't know
[1:19:26] if i'm getting more cynical or wise
[1:19:29] because i'm starting to disbelieve
[1:19:30] almost everything the world tells me
[1:19:32] anymore
[1:19:33] the medical world science world and all
[1:19:34] this i i mean i don't know
[1:19:37] i i guess they get paid to do what they
[1:19:39] do but um
[1:19:40] i don't know i just trust the lord i
[1:19:43] don't want to be foolish about that
[1:19:45] right or arrogant but i just trust the
[1:19:47] lord
[1:19:48] i just trust that i don't know what else
[1:19:50] to say
[1:19:51] but they forbid to marry uh and in fact
[1:19:55] there's a whole cell
[1:19:56] i use that word the other day what that
[1:19:57] means is an overall
[1:19:59] around the world a call in this country
[1:20:03] they're starting to teach kids in
[1:20:04] certain curriculum
[1:20:06] that that they're actually putting down
[1:20:09] the family dynamic
[1:20:11] being a family husband wife children boy
[1:20:14] girl
[1:20:16] well it's them they and whatever
[1:20:20] that that's the way it is anymore it's
[1:20:22] them it's they it's
[1:20:23] whatever you know but you could be what
[1:20:25] you want to be a boy go for it you don't
[1:20:26] need a girl uh it doesn't matter what
[1:20:27] the chromosomes say
[1:20:28] you're a boy you're a girl is there
[1:20:31] anything as
[1:20:32] unfortunate as a
[1:20:35] come on bro amen someone who thinks
[1:20:39] they're
[1:20:41] anyway you know what i'm saying you know
[1:20:44] what i'm talking about
[1:20:45] now that's just just as ungodly denying
[1:20:48] the authority of god and his word of
[1:20:50] anything there is going on today
[1:20:52] to say oh god didn't create a man and a
[1:20:54] woman he absolutely did
[1:20:57] and he created them separate and they're
[1:20:59] supposed to be separate and they're
[1:21:00] supposed to act separate they're
[1:21:01] supposed to dress separate
[1:21:04] amen amen forbidding to marry now
[1:21:07] they're doing that
[1:21:07] commanding to abstain from me so if
[1:21:09] you're not a vegan you're you're
[1:21:11] you're no good which god had which god
[1:21:14] has created to be received with
[1:21:15] thanksgiving
[1:21:16] of them now here's the here's the
[1:21:19] separation
[1:21:20] right you don't think god's a a
[1:21:22] segregationist you're wrong
[1:21:24] god is absolutely a segregation not
[1:21:27] between color of skin but between
[1:21:29] the color of character right if you will
[1:21:32] believe from unbelief
[1:21:34] amen and here's that separation god
[1:21:37] created it
[1:21:38] to them to be received with thanksgiving
[1:21:41] to uh of them which believe and know the
[1:21:45] truth well you know that doesn't include
[1:21:48] everybody everybody doesn't know and
[1:21:50] believe the truth
[1:21:51] right so this scripture doesn't apply to
[1:21:54] those that are out there
[1:21:55] you know i'm a vegetarian i'm a vegan
[1:21:57] course i don't they have nobody even
[1:21:58] says vegetarian anymore there's it's
[1:22:00] just vegan
[1:22:02] if you're not well you're just not with
[1:22:04] it or woke i guess is the word they use
[1:22:06] today
[1:22:07] uh you're just not woke so if you're not
[1:22:10] abstaining from me
[1:22:11] if you're not forbidding to marry if you
[1:22:14] don't agree that a person could be a boy
[1:22:15] and a girl at the same time well then
[1:22:17] you're just
[1:22:18] not woke right that's what they say yeah
[1:22:21] well
[1:22:21] i'm not a heathen either so right
[1:22:24] correct
[1:22:24] i'd rather not be heathen and not be
[1:22:27] woke so
[1:22:28] if that works that way then i'm okay
[1:22:29] with that but you understand this
[1:22:31] is not applied to everybody this is only
[1:22:33] to them which believe and know the truth
[1:22:36] amen for every creature of god is good
[1:22:39] and nothing can be refused
[1:22:41] if it be if it be with uh received
[1:22:45] with thanksgiving for it is sanctified
[1:22:49] by the word of god in prayer so now my
[1:22:50] question is do you believe what you pray
[1:22:52] right right amen i've seen people bow
[1:22:56] their heads over a meal and fret over
[1:22:58] every bite
[1:22:59] i don't know if i should be eating this
[1:23:00] well i don't know if i should be this is
[1:23:02] not this and this is not that and this
[1:23:04] is not good
[1:23:05] this is not good for you and you just
[1:23:07] pray over it exactly right
[1:23:09] or you just you're absolutely denying
[1:23:12] any sort of faith that you may have had
[1:23:13] when you prayed over the meal
[1:23:15] right did you not believe when you
[1:23:17] prayed did you not talk to god about it
[1:23:19] do you not believe that when you talk to
[1:23:21] him
[1:23:21] he answers your prayer well if you do
[1:23:23] then you've got to believe when you
[1:23:25] when you say it that he hears you and it
[1:23:27] is sanctified
[1:23:28] amen period that's my belief
[1:23:32] you just you believe it or you don't and
[1:23:35] if you don't well it doesn't apply to
[1:23:36] you then you might as well be a vegan
[1:23:38] of course that's probably a lot of
[1:23:40] rottenness than that too
[1:23:42] but the point is you either are a
[1:23:44] believer or you're not a believer
[1:23:46] right that's what it basically and
[1:23:48] that's what this whole thing at this end
[1:23:50] time is boiling down to
[1:23:52] that's what this segregation is all
[1:23:54] about that's what this division had come
[1:23:56] out out of her my people is all about
[1:23:59] is separating belief from unbelief faith
[1:24:02] from doubt
[1:24:03] amen that's what it's all about but you
[1:24:05] understand it's all been cleansed
[1:24:08] it's all been sanctified for the use of
[1:24:10] the for
[1:24:11] the use of our bodies right amen we
[1:24:14] either believe that or we don't
[1:24:15] that's what the bible said one more
[1:24:17] scripture real quick i'll close here
[1:24:20] ephesians chapter five and i wanted to
[1:24:23] finish with this so
[1:24:24] just uh you'll have to review i'll give
[1:24:27] them another 20 bucks or something if i
[1:24:29] go
[1:24:30] yes um ephesians 5 verse 25
[1:24:33] husbands love your wives even as christ
[1:24:36] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:24:38] for it
[1:24:40] that he he jesus christ
[1:24:43] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[1:24:46] washing
[1:24:47] of the water by the word the word
[1:24:51] washing the word cleansing amen
[1:24:55] continually perpetually keeping you
[1:24:58] clean
[1:24:59] now this is conversely to those whose
[1:25:01] conscience is seared for the hot iron
[1:25:04] you want to know what that seared with a
[1:25:05] hot iron means
[1:25:07] it means one who carries about with them
[1:25:09] the perpetual
[1:25:11] conscience of sin yeah perpetual
[1:25:15] they've been so seared and none from sin
[1:25:18] that they can
[1:25:19] continually perpetually carry that sin
[1:25:21] with them
[1:25:23] amen that's what their whole life is
[1:25:26] because that's how they live
[1:25:27] their conscience is seared with a hot
[1:25:29] iron and they just live that's their
[1:25:31] just
[1:25:31] their whole life is sin but to a
[1:25:34] believer
[1:25:35] in jesus christ he's presented the bride
[1:25:39] to himself so
[1:25:40] he could cleanse her so that he could
[1:25:43] wash her
[1:25:44] and keep you clean by the washing of the
[1:25:47] water of the word
[1:25:48] now the perpetualness of sin on one side
[1:25:52] but the perpetual watching
[1:25:54] from sin on the other god is washing
[1:25:58] by what the water of the word that keeps
[1:26:01] you clean
[1:26:02] amen keeps you
[1:26:06] forgiven and in the presence of god that
[1:26:08] he might presented to himself
[1:26:10] a glorious church not having spot or
[1:26:14] wrinkle or
[1:26:14] any such thing but that it might be holy
[1:26:17] and without blemish
[1:26:19] amen how many of you can say that's me
[1:26:23] that's me he's talking about me i'll
[1:26:25] declare before all of you today and
[1:26:27] everybody watching this or ever
[1:26:28] will watch it that's me amen he's
[1:26:31] talking about me
[1:26:32] he's telling that i am without spot that
[1:26:35] i
[1:26:36] am without wrinkle or any such thing and
[1:26:38] holy
[1:26:39] without blemish yes amen praise the lord
[1:26:43] amen holy without blemish god has made
[1:26:47] his children
[1:26:48] why not because of my righteousness but
[1:26:51] because of his righteousness
[1:26:53] not because of what i have done but it's
[1:26:55] because of what he has done
[1:26:56] i just accept it and i like to stand
[1:26:59] under that spigot and continually
[1:27:01] let that water let that spigot
[1:27:04] continually wash me
[1:27:06] amen continually wash and keep clean by
[1:27:10] the water of the word
[1:27:11] amen not the water of your favorite
[1:27:13] television program not the water of your
[1:27:15] favorite movie your favorite song
[1:27:17] not the word of your favorite dress or
[1:27:20] or job or
[1:27:20] no by the word amen that's how you get
[1:27:24] and stay clean
[1:27:25] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:27:28] the word
[1:27:29] jesus christ shed his blood to cleanse
[1:27:32] us
[1:27:33] to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[1:27:36] to purge us from all
[1:27:37] our sin that we might be without spot
[1:27:40] wrinkle or blemish
[1:27:41] amen standing in his presence
[1:27:45] as though you had never done it in the
[1:27:47] first place right what a cleansing
[1:27:49] friend
[1:27:50] or if it's just a if it's just somehow
[1:27:53] you can get that cleansing over to the
[1:27:55] world
[1:27:56] won't happen but it sure would be nice i
[1:27:58] wish you could amen
[1:28:00] jesus is here in human flesh you
[1:28:02] couldn't do it so
[1:28:03] amen it's only to those that are
[1:28:05] predestinated those that are called
[1:28:07] elected chosen of god before the
[1:28:10] foundation well those
[1:28:11] he knew would receive it when it come
[1:28:14] across their path
[1:28:15] he knew you here this morning he knew
[1:28:18] you there watching
[1:28:19] he knew you would receive it when it
[1:28:21] came across your path
[1:28:22] that's why that little seed was in there
[1:28:24] might have been dormant
[1:28:26] but it was still in there right all it
[1:28:28] took was a little bit of light
[1:28:30] amen a little bit of work and then all
[1:28:32] of a sudden that
[1:28:33] seed began to spring forth and we
[1:28:36] understand now that that seed was god
[1:28:38] himself
[1:28:38] right amen god himself now
[1:28:42] that's the permanent prominent resident
[1:28:44] of your soul
[1:28:45] sealed everything else out amen i'm so
[1:28:48] thankful you might look in the mirror
[1:28:50] and say well i don't look that cleansed
[1:28:52] well maybe you need to take a shower but
[1:28:54] spiritually
[1:28:56] i may not look that clean you look
[1:28:58] through the wrong lens
[1:29:01] and if you legitimately look through the
[1:29:03] right lens the thinking man's filter and
[1:29:04] you still don't see yourself as cleansed
[1:29:06] then maybe you're not
[1:29:08] maybe you need to come to an altar again
[1:29:10] maybe you need to find christ again
[1:29:12] amen if you need to get born again fill
[1:29:14] with his spirit
[1:29:15] whatever it is whatever needs be that's
[1:29:17] between you and god
[1:29:19] amen but obey that because the worst end
[1:29:24] of it is death
[1:29:26] and after that is hell yeah and i know
[1:29:29] none of us wants to do that
[1:29:31] amen so god bless you let's stand if we
[1:29:36] could
[1:29:42] amen let's sing this course we usually
[1:29:44] see it when we take communion
[1:29:47] in fact i always sing it when we take
[1:29:48] community but let's see

[1:30:02] often but just the first verse

[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:32:10] from
[1:32:12] [Music]
[1:32:25] granted hallelujah jesus i pray do that
[1:32:28] to each one of us
[1:32:29] amen every day of our lives we trust
[1:32:32] seek that from the lord we make sure
[1:32:35] that we're cleansed and clean before him
[1:32:38] that our lives are ever before him and
[1:32:41] he understands and he's there for us
[1:32:43] humbly contritely
[1:32:47] bowing before the lord god amen
[1:32:51] and god will cleanse made clean yes
[1:32:55] take out any wick at the store today
[1:32:58] in jesus name praise the lord
[1:33:02] god bless you i appreciate you love you
[1:33:04] all
[1:33:05] pray there was something to say bless
[1:33:06] you today amen
[1:33:10] i contacted the
[1:33:14] realtor again for the other churches was
[1:33:16] planning on moving again
[1:33:18] from the ina location and he's having a
[1:33:21] difficult time getting the city of
[1:33:24] miranda to come out and
[1:33:26] check off on the facility because they
[1:33:28] can't even turn the electricity onto
[1:33:30] that building until the town of marana
[1:33:33] clears it so they don't have power on
[1:33:36] the building yet but
[1:33:37] that wouldn't take long to do it just
[1:33:39] has to go through the whole process of
[1:33:41] doing it
[1:33:42] and that whole process is what we're in
[1:33:44] the middle of right now
[1:33:45] so just i told the realtor we'd be
[1:33:49] praying for frank is the pastor's name
[1:33:51] the other church so we'd be praying for
[1:33:53] frank his church uh if that's where he's
[1:33:55] supposed to go and open this place up
[1:33:57] for us that
[1:33:58] the lord would provide that for them
[1:34:00] they could move into that facility and
[1:34:02] moran would get on the ball the power
[1:34:04] company and all and get it done and
[1:34:05] ready for them so
[1:34:07] because we're done and ready to go over
[1:34:09] there so
[1:34:10] i still look though i'm still looking uh
[1:34:13] i found things that
[1:34:14] may work uh but they would probably have
[1:34:17] to be fixed to be a church
[1:34:19] so i'm just thinking a little bit more
[1:34:22] patience and
[1:34:23] and if the lord has is if the lord's
[1:34:25] dragging this out because he's got
[1:34:26] someplace better
[1:34:27] right uh then i'm i'm looking i'm
[1:34:30] listening
[1:34:32] i'm watching if anything comes up so
[1:34:35] we'll just see but for right now that's
[1:34:37] uh the plan
[1:34:38] so and that's where we are with that so
[1:34:40] just pray for them pray for the church
[1:34:42] pray for the
[1:34:43] miranda to come and and do their thing
[1:34:46] in the power company and what all needs
[1:34:48] to be done so they can move over there
[1:34:49] they're ready to move over they were
[1:34:51] they were he told me they're ready two
[1:34:52] or three months ago to move over there
[1:34:54] so
[1:34:55] um whatever that is needs to be done and
[1:34:57] i said well we're ready too so
[1:35:00] we'll see whatever the lord provides so
[1:35:02] amen just to keep you updated with
[1:35:04] that's where we are with it right now
[1:35:06] so i haven't heard back from the town of
[1:35:07] miranda myself
[1:35:09] about us moving into that facility i'm
[1:35:11] not
[1:35:13] concerned about that part i don't think
[1:35:15] there'll be an issue
[1:35:16] but i wanted to clear it to make sure
[1:35:18] that you know
[1:35:19] that it is official with the town of
[1:35:21] miranda because like i said
[1:35:22] we want to have the church and micah is
[1:35:26] talking about making a sign there's a
[1:35:28] big huge
[1:35:29] sign over top of it and put something
[1:35:31] over for a sign for us and also
[1:35:33] anyway we'll just uh we just continue to
[1:35:36] trust the lord
[1:35:37] and what he provides i think and
[1:35:39] thankfully provided this so
[1:35:41] we'll be meeting here until you hear
[1:35:43] back from me
[1:35:45] on sundays at 10 30 we'll be meeting
[1:35:47] here until i
[1:35:48] sonja says just tell them this just
[1:35:50] going to be the same i
[1:35:52] called the guy and reserved this room
[1:35:53] for like the next three weeks
[1:35:55] so but we cancel at any time
[1:35:58] but just so nobody else sneaks in and
[1:36:01] gets it from under us so
[1:36:03] it'll be like this until the lord
[1:36:05] provides and and the stuff that they
[1:36:07] need to do over there can be done
[1:36:09] in a day i mean it's not hard it's just
[1:36:12] the process
[1:36:14] so anyway we appreciate you love you

[1:36:19] prayer requests and remember that in
