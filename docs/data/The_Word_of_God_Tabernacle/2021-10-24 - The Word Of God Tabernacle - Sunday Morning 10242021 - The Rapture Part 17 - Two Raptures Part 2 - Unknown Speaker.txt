text this morning from roger collins he is trying to keep me mostly updated with brother steve buckles he says please pray for brother stephen i know you all are he had a really rough night his oxygen levels with his oxygen levels and wasn't able to stay on the bipap machine due to feeling too claustrophobic uh he was on it for a total of two and a half hours that's been his problem with the bipap is a claustrophobia his oxygen levels are finally at 86 by god's precious grace when he got up on the bedside potty it dropped to 60 and i had a really hard time getting up so the doctor said yesterday that we're going to wait to see how his lungs heal so brother steve wants uh every one of us to pray to god that we heal his lungs amen praise the lord so let's pray as such amen for brother steve buckles the lord would touch and heal his lungs it appeared thursday and into friday the doctors were the hospital wanted to put them on a ventilator i said wednesday night here that they couldn't get his oxygen level up above 80 but they finally got it thursday up in the 90s but they still wanted to put him on a on a ventilator so sister hope steve's wife texting good friends with monica collins texting and letting her know what was going on and sister monica because of all the things it just didn't seem or feel or look right she started looking up some of the medicines that they were giving stephen it was stuff that had nothing to do with coping it was just it basically was stuff that was killing him uh and then of course once you go on the ventilator what five percent of people come off of them uh it's almost a death sentence so we just prayed that the lord would intervene and uh help him say you know and and if i and steve did he said i'm not going on the ventilator don't put me i'm not doing it so anyway he didn't go on that this was the latest report today so we're just trusting the lord get all that gunk out of his lungs and clear them lungs up perfect like they should be and just trust the lord touch and heal it completely amen i had a uh again a couple of prayer requests written down joel i didn't see any over there so looks like you got the day off brother danny wrote a couple of requests said please pray for my ex-mother-in-law who had a fall and was taken to saint mary's hospital she was also checked for covenant and tested positive and so we'll remember that request to prayer also he says please pray for my daughter o'reilly did i get that right brother uh a raven a raleigh excuse me saw her at the desert museum where she works tried to be a good witness to her about the lord and believe that she will soon give her heart to the lord like the rest of my children amen believe in that two brother praise the lord this is actually kind of more of a prayer a praise um i tell you what why don't we just go ahead and stand and we'll read the praise report after this amen anyone else have a prayer request on your heart before we go to the lord in prayer right uh for those of you may not have heard that uh sister norma's granddaughter's having surgery on her hand friday so please remember she broke her hand so please remember that prayer also uh sister norma's home today recovering from a little flu illness now ronnie's got it uh her husband so remember him in prayer too if you will assistant derek has been kicked out of where he was at because of these kind of demons he just walks up and down the street using the f word and i'm okay i'm not okay i'm you know it's this battle and he and he's yeah and i told him last night i guess it was that i i think i'm gonna have to send him home to his mother because nobody else can take him because they can't handle the temper tantrums so i i hope i'm i hope i'm doing the right thing if you could just please pray with me he needs the lord he needs to be exercised he needs the lord and and maybe if you could come and and i'll talk to you about that later if we can he he's interested in in what god can do for him but uh i'm not i'm not able to bring him the word the way that he needs to hear it so that he can offer him the services and so forth and and uh i just uh we just need prayer for this i don't know his mom might not even take him anymore because she's in love and so um and she's talking about not even taking him so i don't even know he may be a word

how to do it when does it do amen he's always on time god is never late yes he's never wrong he's always perfect human sister um i just want to ask her prayer for my brother-in-law marcos and my nephew so marco's had surgery had his leg amputated um he's doing okay um he says he's slipped in a little bit into depression um but he did mention that um when he's able to finally go home he wants

all amen yes where would we be without his grace saints amen remember praise the lord amen you have your bibles now let's turn over to first thessalonians getting close to winding up this series but just as the lord leads first thessalonians chapter four had to cut last sunday off i did well i didn't have to but i cut it off a little bit just for sake of going and coming back and the time frame so [Music] lord william would just pick up where we left off last week amen first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13. amen praise the lord first thessalonians 4 13 before we read let's just bow our heads again for another word prayer for good precious lord jesus father it is such a privilege to be here again lord and we thank you so much for what you've done for us blessing us watching over protecting keeping us you test us lord you try us you bring us along lord of the ways that we need to go and and making sure father that we're in the place the position that we need to be his lord brother has testimony father it's like that scripture says you know in the house you don't come down to take anything out because it'll be that time just that quick lord we'll go home to be with you lord we're looking at any moment any time father for the completion the fruition lord of of this scripture and of these words that we've been speaking on for here the past several months lord god that's all of our hearts desire looking longing desiring father that we see our loved ones appear before us lord and yes god to see our bodies change and and go to meet you in the air lord we thank you father for this church we thank you for this building and the people lord and everything that is done lord to glorify and magnify you lord we're lost without you and we need you more than ever we pray god once again that you would come father as we believe that you are here we say come lord in the sense of you take full control lord and speak through these lips hear through our ears and let what you desire to be accomplished in this service today with each one of us that it would be done and we'll give you the glory and the praise for all of it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen first thessalonians first thessalonians chapter four start my recording here first thessalonians 4 13. [Music] amen but i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the archangel with the trump of god the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort ye one another with these words yes you can be seated if you will as i said we'll just continue on with where we left off from last week uh so much so uh we'll background a little bit of course but more or less we're continuing on where we left off last week and of course that was on the thought that we had or that we took from brother branham that from the scripture that there are six uh scriptural raptures three in the old testament three in the new testament we quantified the first two which was very easy i think we pretty much almost anybody that knows anything about bible christianity knows that enoch was the first one to ever rapture and of course then elijah uh enoch was the man that uh walked with god you can't please you can't walk with god unless you're pleasing to the god yeah man god's not gonna walk with a wolf he's only gonna walk with a with a lamb amen and that dove and that lamb is only gonna come together that that dove will only come to a lamb it won't come to a wolf so if you if if he was walking with the lord then that means he was pleasing to the lord and i believe that would be the same again like we said as today if we're pleasing to the lord the lord will walk with you the lord will speak to you the lord will show you and and reveal things to you and and be a friend to you and be a companion to you amen that's the part of walking with the lord elijah was the second one and of course we know he was taken up in a whirlwind into a chariot of fire and the lord took him home and notice now uh i'm not going to go back to the scripture but if i fail to point out a thing that the lord showed me to point out and that was the fact that both these men according to the scripture the verbiage that was used that they were taken they were taken that was in both instances in both raptures they both were scripturally according were taken amen so both of these men and they were both single men they were both just individual people i don't mean single as did not married although i don't think they were but uh i mean single as then they were it was just one person it wasn't multiple peoples it was just one person amen now if we go back again and sort of pick off pick up where we left off and i had some questions afterwards so i want to try to address those as well and i want to say this too if you're listening to me now um i i it came on my heart to to yesterday or today yesterday that uh if anybody has any questions that you want to try to have answered uh if by the grace of god we can do it if you have questions that you that you're looking to the lord or looking for scriptural answer or something somehow i get people that ask me from time to time questions or text me things or email me things so uh yesterday came on my heart if that's something that you'd like to do if you want to write the question down put it in the box and maybe the lord willing i may just answer that individually to that person or if we get enough maybe we'll just have the questions and answers again just however the lord leads and however it is upon your heart but the lord just put that on my heart so if it's there that's fine if it's not that's fine but it was something that i felt the lord put on my heart to ask if you have questions and answers that you would like to put in the box and we can try to address those but i did have a little bit of question maybe misunderstanding from the scriptural point of view last week uh of this particular point because we got to the third rapture and remember we put jesus as being the third old testament rapture y'all remember why i put jesus as the third old testament rapture anybody remember why i did that because that's what brother branham did brother branham did that uh if you listen to the rapture message brother random made the rat uh the rapture of jesus the third rapture of the old testament so if he made it in the third row even though it's in the new testament if he made it the third rapture of the old testament then i'm not going to question his authority uh how about you i don't think i want to question his authority on that he made jesus rapture the third old testament rapture now i want to go back to matthew as we read last time matthew 27 and read these few verses of scripture again matthew 27 46 and read these few verses of scripture again because this is kind of where some of the misunderstanding came from because uh you have to follow through complete with the scripture you have to read the scripture exactly the way it is written there's not an interpretation of this this is this is what it says and and it it can sound confusing because we get so used to reading a book and a book follows a thought usually in in congruently or chronologically uh so b follows a and c follows b and d follows c but the bible isn't entirely written that way so when you read the scripture you can't just say oh okay well this is this so this comes this and this comes this it isn't always that way that's right amen scripturally it's not always that way uh i believe personally and i may cross some doctrine here but i believe the seals are that way not the first five but uh uh the last couple anyway but that that's that's my opinion that's my feeling brother ram never says that because she never says it the other way either but i i do know scripturally it's it's not always uh if you read it you and you and you you place this to this it doesn't always work that way i'll just give example as we read through this okay 40 verse 46 saint matthew 27 verse 46 and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why is thou forsaken me some of them that stood there when they heard that said this man called for elias straightway one of them ran took a sponge filled with vinegar put it read gave it to him to drink the rest said let be let us see whether elias will come and save him jesus when he had cried again listen to this now when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost amen so he he passed on the life left his body and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain from the top to the bottom the earth did quake the rocks did rent and the graves were open and many bodies of the saints which slept arose now if you take that just for what it says right now now right there now listen close if you take it just for what it says right there you would think that as soon as jesus yielded up the ghost that all the dead saints rose if you just take that what it just says right there amen because again what he said the graves were open meaning the bodies say of the saints which slept arose you think when he shouted they arose and there they were but if you don't read the rest of the scripture that explains when they rose you will you will take every everything will be thrown out of context and the whole scripture will and the whole point of christ will lose its meaning now i'll get to that if you listen close now but the next verse let's read on and came out of the graves after his resurrection so we noticed that when he cried with a loud voice many of the seats which were sleeping rose but they did not come out of the graves until after his resurrection amen amen when he resurrected they resurrected so there was another three days there was another three days from the time that jesus gave a loud voice and those dead bodies arose from the time that they actually came out of the graves it was three days now if you read it like i said like just a book you would say okay he's crowded a loud voice they rose and there they were a b follows a c follows b d follow c but it doesn't always happen that way in the scripture because the scripture was written by inspiration men filled with the holy ghost god wrote the bible amen so if it is him from the wise and prudent and it's revealed to make such a such as would learn now if you take the old testament saints coming out of the graves and appearing before many before jesus resurrection then what was the point of christ dying in the first place amen that's right because the only way that those old testament saints could have resurrected and come out of the graves and appear unto many was because jesus went to hell he conquered death and hell so they could rise amen amen that was only accomplished at the moment that or completed completely accomplished at the moment that jesus rose from the dead when jesus rose from the dead that was a conquering of death and hell and the grave and at that time is when the old testament saints could come out of the grave themselves right they arose at his voice from their sleep but paradise was not emptied out until he took those keys right and ascended up on high when well resurrected look jesus said in in uh first in revelation chapter 1 verse 18 jesus said i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death well what is the purpose of having a key a key allows you access a key gives you a certain gives you a a level a measure or it gives you complete authority over the entrance way of something that's what a key does they gave me a key to this place because we paid the rent and as long as i pay the rent we have access to this facility amen unfettered access he can't tell me i can't come in if i paid the bill right when jesus paid the bill in full he took the keys and now he is the possessor of those keys now who does he give those keys to today they belong to us yes amen god give jesus give those keys to us amen whatever you bind on earth found in heaven whatever you lose on earth loose in heaven you have that power you have that authority that god gave you with those keys to death and hell when did he get them well he took them from from the devil i guess the plainest dramatization you can give us i like my dads my dad said jesus walked in there he slapped the devil up against the wall snatched those keys open paradise and he ascended up on high. that's a good explanation as any i know of amen he just said move out of my way devil i'm coming through and he did and he emptied paradise as a result and all of them raised at his resurrection not when he died at his resurrection they could only have done that because he rose first praise the lord he had to conquer death and hell before any of us could have had any hope of conquering death in hell ourselves or the great would hold us like it used to hold them hell had claims on us that that hell had claims on them but now because heroes hell has no claim on us anymore death cannot hold us anymore we're we're sons and daughters of god we belong to him death has no hold on us satan has no claim on you hell has no claims to you because he rose amen when heroes they arrows and what did they do as we said the other day they came out of the graves after his resurrection went into the holy series and appeared unto me and there's our type as we said last week same thing they'll do today in this last day those that have fallen asleep in the lord as we've read so many times first thessalonians 4 as they have fallen asleep in the lord they will come forth amen because that voice will shout once again and it will raise the dead amen you know that song we sang that song actually says the trumpet's going to sound so loud but i had it changed to i'd like could change it for us so the voice is going to shout so loud it'll resurrect the dead praise the lord because that voice will shout and it will raise the dead amen amen now the only way that they could do that is jesus rose is that three day period that three day period because remember of course we know david said and and and in the new testament it says that i'll not leave his soul in hell neither will i suffer my holy one to see corruption so it had to jesus had to raise before that corruption set into that body you say what was so important about that body what's so important about your body his filthy past house it wasn't intended to be that way those things amen it's so as to be in a glorified condition and that's why jesus came in a glorified condition and that's exactly how we're going to come forth that's exactly how we're going to see our loved ones come for forth in a glorified condition amen on the third day so there's that three day that three-day period from the time that they actually rose until they actually came out of the graves now we may talk about this more when we get to the shout the voice of the trump but could you imagine today that a voice shout to to wake them to arise them but yet haven't appeared yet before us the graves opened or they they they come and appear unto many there's a period of time i'm trying to help us understand there's a period of time there the scriptural precedent is there's a period of time three days between the time that they arose and the time that they came forth out of the graves amen there's those three days so if that scriptural press that he hits us today then then they could already be a rose that's right that's right we don't know we know we just know brother brown said they're as far away as you put them right amen they're here with us our loved ones praise the lord i'm going to read this quote again uh to tie this together because i wasn't intending on spending a lot of time on that but i wanted to i wanted to validify this point i wanted us to understand that if i ran over a little quickly last week i apologized i i i shouldn't but i probably did feel a little time constraint on me with uh leaving and coming back and that and i shouldn't do that but i may have ran over a little bit if i did forgive me but hopefully this little more thorough explanation helps us see uh how that uh those events unfolded as they came forth rapture brother adam says now in the rapture message the old testament saints gone into his presence paradise done away the old testament saints ascended up at his loud voice when he screamed and gave up the ghost because why this the sacrifice the perpetuation of their sins they had waited on listen now the perpetuation of their sins that they had waited on believing that perfect lamb was coming see they were looking for that lamb they were looking for that messiah to come and pay that price to bail them out of hell amen they were waiting on it he finally came they had offered the sacrifice the lamb and when he died and yielded up the ghosts he screamed the loud voice the old testament saints awoke watch this shout at the boy and the voice over here doing the same thing he's talking about first thessalonians 4 and his coming see he yielded up the ghost and when he did the sacrifice was perfect paradise emptied out the old testament saints came to the earth again walked around on earth and entered in him entered in with him at his rapture amen he entered in with him at his rapture so as he screamed and yielded up the ghost they arose when he resurrected they resurrected with him and all of them appeared now we have record in in our bible i know there's other ancillary books that have been written um about this uh period of time and i've heard different things people talk about uh people recognizing or not recognizing certain ones of the uh of the old testament that came forth but just from the bible's sake the the recordation we have in this bible is that jesus came and appeared unto several of his disciples all of them actually he came down when they were out fishing and he put fish on the farm was cooking for him put fish on the fire and he was cooking for him uh he came in one time through a wall he came in and and and and thomas wasn't there and they told thomas about it thomas said i don't believe until i put my hand on my uh my uh finger and his hand and my flesh my hand and his side and so forth and and and jesus come the next time and thomas was there and he said here thomas here i am here put your finger in here put put your hand in my side go ahead do it now it doesn't say he did it amen then that i remember it doesn't say that he actually did that but it does say that he believed after that amen right amen so it wasn't necessarily that he had to do that but the fact that he was just there oh and you think how many times people think all kinds of things right you always think all kinds of why do this and i think this and and well if i could just do this or something but then when you're in his presence all that just goes away you're like who care i don't want to i don't need to put my finger in your hand or my hand in your side that that all that disappears just getting in his presence when you get in his presence and all those plans you had and all those thoughts you had and all those things that you all that just goes away and you just melt in his presence and it just becomes something it just all becomes about him amen it's just about i believe that's probably what thomas was feeling he got in his presence he said oh forget about all that and jesus amen and he just fell down lord i'm here praise the lord i that happens a lot of times with us too we get all those things in our mind and all those things happen amen and then it just all goes away so jesus appeared but it doesn't that i found scripturally it doesn't say brother brown uh doesn't mention it where the old testament saints appeared unto me like i said there are other books that are written of uh that i've heard about like the book of the book of mary or the belief of mary or those books like that and i've heard there's different ones brother green talked about them uh i think brother green probably read some of them i think brother brown probably read some of them um but i i think even in mary there's uh there's a little thing there about uh uh blind bartimaeus and his seeing eye lamb well you know that's not the bible right but it is in that book it's in the prince of the house of david too so you know brother brown speaks on these things you think well you know did he have insight or did he just read it in that book and it sounded like a good allegory or a good a good dramatization so we don't know but we do know scripturally that's where i take it from genesis to revelation jesus appeared unto unto his disciples it's not a record of the others except that the bible says they did they appeared unto many now it doesn't say that they appeared unto one it says they appeared unto many it doesn't say they appeared unto everybody right it just says they appeared unto many and those are the many of people that i believe are the ones that were the believers of that time so if you ask me those that are about to resurrect from the dead our loved ones that have gone on before and the ones that have gone on in the other church ages from paul on those will also be in that position amen amen i i i believe they will be now i might not know them right off but i believe that they will now they're only going to appear my opinion now they're only going to appear to the believers that's right yes i i say it's not my opinion but it's common sense to me why would they appear into under believers right right i mean the unbeliever is getting its message now we we are the message to the unbeliever not the dead that are raising yeah the the last the last voice of the last age is in the bride and the the preaching to the souls that are in prison that's happening right now is coming from the believer from the bride that's not going to come from the dead that have gone on before that's our job our job is to preach to the total lost our job is for our lives to manifest christ so that people see jesus in us and it becomes a uh a condemnation to them to those who don't change so it's not gonna be for the unbeliever it's gonna be for the believer yes it's going to be for those that are alive and remain that are that are going to go in the rapture themselves that will see these that had gone on before that's my opinion now you're talking about multiple millions of people amen that brother branham talked to that have gone on now not not the alive and remain group but those that have gone on i mean when brother branham went over there and he then he looked and he saw throngs of people millions of people and he said who are all these people and they said and the voice came and said those are your converts brother brown's converts yeah amen now i believe i was standing there yeah but because i believe uh brother brown never personally witnessed to me but the message is what spoke to my heart god threw that message that brought me to him but millions so if there was millions there that were brother randoms cumbersome how about from the first church age from the time that jesus raised from that time till today how many millions multi millions have gone on died in christ martyr 50 what was it the the catholic martyr book said 53 million that the catholic church martyred during the dark ages just during the dark ages 53 million they have recorded so there's going to be millions and millions that are going to actually raise from the debt at this last day and appear unto a few thousand i mean i dare says a million i don't know how many it's going to be alive and remain i know it's going to be a few it's going to be a small number right but a million is a small number compared to 7 billion i mean it's supposed to be 7 billion 7.5 billion people on the earth now so a million really is a small number to seven and a half billion but however many it's going to be you're talking about multi multi millions of people that are going to raise and come out of their graves and appear unto many which is going to be 100 million appearing to 1 million 200 million appearing to 2 million don't know but i know one thing the statistics and the numbers are going to be skewed greatly but i know personally myself i know uh 10 people or so i guess in my family without counting it out with in front of you that have gone on that's going to come up and i'm looking for them all of them for my mom dad son brother sister i'm looking for them yes so there's multiples of people gonna come i believe to me personally but they're gonna appear unto many millions and millions and millions are going to appear to us praise the lord how god's going to orchestrate that and how that's going to the logistics of that i have no idea i'm just looking forward to it amen i'm just looking forward to it now acts chapter 1 let's read this again we read this last week this is jesus rapture acts chapter 1 verse 9. acts chapter one verse nine chapter 1 verse 9 and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken there's that word again he was taken just like it mentioned with enoch just like it mentioned with elijah just like it mentioned with jesus all three old testament single men one person all three taken taken jesus said i laid my life down and i picked my life back up again nobody else has authority over that right that is mine and mine alone if my life is taken i freely lay it down amen and he laid it down for us he said but then i also take my life back up again and he ascended up on high so when he did this him jesus again being that third old testament the single person taken it says he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight he was taken now remember jesus was that cornerstone jesus was the keystone that connected the old and the new testaments people want to get rid of the old testament friend sorry it's a part of the bible has been since the beginning of time always will be it's god as much as the new testament is god right you can't get rid of it you don't i don't want to get rid of it i mean you want to chop the bottom half of god off and say well god i only want the top half of you or chop the top half holes together i only want the bottom half or cut off his arms and legs and say god i just want your torso no it's like last week you take all or nothing it's every bit of it or it's none at all right so the old testament is just as important just as much god as the new testament and jesus is the one that came and brought them together because jesus died then resurrected then raptured bringing them to bringing the both together the old testament and the new testament because he died first old testament resurrected the two together and then he raised like we're looking for in the gentile rapture his last day that keystone quarter stone he's the one that brought it all together so again everything listen we know this as christians as godly people we know this but every bit of everything to us comes right to that pinnacle and that is calvary amen amen that is calvary calvary is the pinnacle of all of it that's the that that is the place that they look to and that's the place that we look back to america there's where it is at that point amen not for jesus none of this would happen if it weren't for calvary none of this would happen none of this would exist if it weren't for him so every bit of it goes right back there again i mean you can't get rid of it for when people want to try to get rid of the blood they probably want to try to get quit singing about the cross and and get rid of calvary friend you can't get rid of it every bit of everything we believe goes right back there that's the foundation of it all yes if you take that away you have no foundation right you're building on sinking sins have people try to in this message try to do that oh friend you can't do it amen it everything back it everybody goes back there that's that's that pinnacle that's that keystone that's that cornerstone part amen that holds this building this body together praise the lord jesus he's the one who did it while they stood look uh looks dead fastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel amen as jesus was taken up out of their sight now a a scripture that we didn't get to last week first the first corinthians first corinthians chapter 15 because we know the next rapture is what us amen that's us all that we've talked about that time from from from the resurrection of jesus till today all those who died in christ will be in this rapture all those that have gone asleep will raise from their grace and they'll appear unto many and those that alive and remain will be caught up together to meet him in the air amen that's that's the rapture we're talking about so that so the you've got enoch elijah and jesus the three old testament raptures all three single people taken taken up amen not calling it doesn't say none of them say caught up or called away or rapture that does not come until the fifth rapture which is us true amen where it says call away now there is there is nowhere in the bible if if you know of it you let me know i'll stand corrected i can't find anywhere in the bible i haven't heard anything brother branham said that there's any place that that we know of except the ephesian scripture i read last week for the old testament saints raptured it does not say in the scripture specifically about the old testament saints rapturing now it does say the the ephesian scripture i read last week where he lived captivity cabinet gave his son to men and they went up and ascended on high with him and i can show you again i can read what brother branham said and they walked around on the earth and entered in with christ at his rapture we just read that right amen fourth so jesus the third now the fourth was the old testament saints now the old testament saints was not a single individual right it was a huge large group of people we don't know how many the bible doesn't say but there's a there was a large amount of people that raptured the old testament saints that rapture contained a group of people amen which became our type now they're all our types of course we go back to enoch with enoch being the seventh from adam and so forth and we also can see now look at this we also can see that the spirit of elijah had a significant part in every one of these except for enoch because the spirit elijah had not been introduced until elijah came and of course we know that elijah's rapture was influenced by the elijah spirit because he was elijah right this the so that's the second rapture third rapture was jesus well jesus was what he was introduced by john the baptist with the spirit of elijah amen that he introduced jesus to the people and of course then subsequently the old testament saints well now we're looking at this fifth rapture where we're talking about the the uh the the current gentile new testament gentiles and our rapture that we're looking to was influenced by who the elijah's spirit again amen the same elijah spirit that was back there and came through and introduced jesus same spirit today same spirit of elijah on a prophet of god for this day to bring a message a shout to a people to get her together praise the lord now first uh first corinthians chapter 15 verse 51 he said behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed changed it doesn't say here that we're going to be caught up that's first thessalonians 4. it doesn't say called away it doesn't say rapture it doesn't say taken it says we're going to be changed now i want to bring another aspect of this to us today is i got a few more minutes please bear with me um i want to change the aspect of it a little bit because that word change brings about the same word as romans 12. let me get to that real quick romans 12. [Music] romans chapter 12 verse 1 he says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies your bodies these things that we're living in amen so when people say that they can't live the word they're wrong because the bible says that these bodies could come under subjection to that spirit present your bodies amen a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service amen so our bodies are supposed to be presented we present them amen not brother branham not not a minister not a pope not a church we are to present our bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god well if it's a living sacrifice it's going to be holy and if it's holy it's going to be acceptable to god but those are the three things that god's asking for from our from us in our mortal flesh our mortal bodies and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god good acceptable imperfect which is a reasonable service which is pleasing to god amen now that word transformed is the same word as changed we are to be changed not just conformed not just forcing ourselves into some mole or some pattern but we're to be transformed like the transformation of jesus in matthew 17 [Music] transformed by the renewing of our minds now the greek of that is morpha in morpha or morphu is the greek word which we know in morpha just means changing from one form to another like a caterpillar to a butterfly we've seen these millions and millions and millions and millions of butterflies all over tucson the past three or four months well they were caterpillars they came from caterpillars they had to morph the size themselves to get in from being a caterpillar to being a butterfly just like jesus who took upon himself the form of a servant that word form is the same greek word morpho changed from one form to another brother random talks about an act like a like a play where a person might make uh might be one person but play three different parts they'll play one part they'll go back behind the c and they'll change their clothes and they might change and alter their voice they'll come back out and they'll play another part they morph it themselves they were this character one minute they came back and then they were this character same person three different characters well look friend when when the bible says that we are to be changed we are to be changed that means that we're going to transform amen from one form to another that's right right now i i i want to challenge us today that our bodies are being presented to god perfect holy acceptable to god our bodies you think god doesn't care about our bodies yes he does this is the place where he is housed this is his tabernacle this is his temple of course he cares about this yes amen you look at the old testament where they said don't cut themselves and tattoo themselves you know that cutting themselves like that was a heathen trait it was the custom of the unbelieving heathen to cut themselves you think that's okay by god no our bodies are to be a living sacrifice dares i say we're morphizing if that's the word we're being in morphine we're changing what's changing us the word what is it changing to the word who is it becoming the word christ is the word so what's doing the changing god's doing the changes what is it changing us to something that's pleasing and acceptable by god amen and that's the reasonable service yes god cares about our bodies yes he does he cares about your soul of course your soul is the eternal part of you but god cares about your bodies we are to present our bodies living sacrifice holy holy acceptable by god amen because we're going because paul said we are to be changed and i'm not changing the word but friend i believe we're being changed now we are changing now are you the same person you were when you first accepted christ i hope not unless you accepted him yesterday right i hope you're not the same person we're not the same people we were we're changing how dare i use this devil word evolve we're changing we're evolving we're growing closer into his image we're being changed we're being changed the rapture change is the culmination that's the finish of the changing of our bodies that's the completion part but our bodies are being changed all the time more and more into his image more and more into his likeness by the word that's why the bible says that you are written epistle read of all men yes written epistle where is that writing at in your soul well it's already there the writing is here where people can read it that's the point so people can read it it's here so people can read it amen let me finish this while i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye then i'll tell you now we understand and a moment is a period of time a twinkle is a period of time it's a very very very short period but it is a period of time amen and the last trump for the trumpet shall sound the dead in christ the dead shall be raised incorruptible we shall be changed same changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this moral shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory what was that victory the resurrection of christ possessors of the keys of hell and death praise the lord oh yes whereas i see o brave worst by victory the seeing of death is sin and the strength of the sin is the law but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ therefore my beloved brethren be you steadfastly move always abounding in the work of the lord for as much as ye know your labor is not in vain in the lord now that's the same that's basically a replica of of of romans 12 1-2 amen always abounding in the work of the lord always abounding and obeying his word being obedient amen for the bad always being obedient you know the thing that struck me about the brother pat's testimony wasn't that the lord tested him but it was that he put on the radio an announcement that was the record silver bells uh are at the centerio and anthony that didn't exist there's nothing when he got there so i'm anyway sounds strange but god works in mysterious ways doesn't he amen now let's get to this last one real quick uh revelation revelation chapter 11 is rapture number six the third of the new testament the third of the new testament revelation 11 11 is the two jewish witnesses that witnessed the 144 thousand at the end now this is of course during the tribulation period this is after uh the rapture this is the white uh the uh marriage supper of the lamb and and these witnesses are there for three and a half years three and a half years i'm not reading the whole thing i'm just going to read a couple verses but if you read on it says um uh in verse 3 11 3 it tells you uh three um prophesied a thousand two hundred three score days that's three and a half years right amen three and a half years that's the tribulation period three and a half years so that's the two you that's the two witnesses that are in revelation that witness to the jews 144 thousand now verse 11 let's get to this last rapture i'll close here and after three days and a half they these two prophets moses and elijah there's your elijah spirit again right elijah amen i told you these elijah had a significant impact on every rapture except for hina moses and elijah and they're they they witness for three and a half years they're finally killed and they don't bother to bury them they leave them laying in the streets for three and a half days they leave them laying in the streets and after three and a half uh three days and a half the spirit of life came from god entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon all them which saw them and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither another come up catching away caught up amen a voice from it saying come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud where there were their enemies beheld them and of course fear then fell on everybody because these dead men are laying there for three and a half days had corruption set in three days 72 hour corruption sets in amen they were there three and a half days dead on the street but their bodies rose and they came up and they stood and looked and people saw them standing there again alive yeah and all of a sudden they go up and caught up into in a cloud in the air god takes them the raptures them home amen praise the lord those are the two the the two jews of that time again moses and elijah at that time that actually went in the rapture amen the other jews did not they they the rest of the dead lived not for a thousand years they came up in the white throne judgment amen but those two were the last rapture they died rose and wrath amen the last two the last rapture that happened scripturally were those two so god takes care of of every one of his jew gentile amen he takes care of his children he takes care of those that belong to him and he has his scriptural patterns and his ways of doing things and he and he shows those patterns and and reveals them and helps us see what is going on now and what he's doing for us now and what's about to take place with this changing of our bodies amen and in a moment in the twinkling of an eye the culmination of change will happen and we'll go to meet the lord in the air but what do we do first we see our loved ones amen amen we see our loved ones appear that's the that's the literal if if we are alive to see that happen that is literally the next thing that we will notice yeah significant difference that we'll notice is our loved ones will begin to appear before us yeah and and possibly others we always say loved ones but there could be any any and all of any old testament saint that writes that could come and appear that you can see and and notice amen we don't know but it could be always talk about loved ones because you know those are the most dear to you but it could be any of the old testament saying they'll appear before us and we'll be here a minimum of 30 days after that and we'll go be the lord well we'll be caught up together to meet the lord in the air amen and the my best favorite part so shall we ever be with the lord amen amen praise the lord let's stand if we could amen so shall we ever be with him praise the lord thank you jesus you love the lord jesus amen my wife sent me a text i want you to raise your hand the the surgery for sister norma's granddaughter is tuesday not friday i mean so keep that in your mind remember that we'll be praying for that of course but also tuesday you know i like to uh i trust you do uh that the lord brings it to your heart on the day a person is traveling or flying or having surgery or something all that at that time if you know the time or that day we're praying for that amen we're specifically bringing that and putting that person before the lord so there's the the the mindfulness that we have of that person and touches the heart of god and so remember tuesday katrina is supposed to have that surgery on her hand not friday so remember that praise the lord amen you love the lord amen amen ready to go on the

amen they're not god just that's just another one of those things like brother pat's testimony others that god is mindful of you amen praise the lord anyone else then if there would have been a wreck there i'd have thought he's sending me for the wreck yeah but when there's nothing there it's just between you and god right well and that's what i was thinking the whole time you're telling the story i'm thinking the lord had something for you to do with the rack yeah right it didn't even exist apparently maybe that called a radio station to get that dj card just kidding that's god amen amen i believe that that's god working with you you're not working with his children i believe that's just as real as any of it so amen angel would you dismiss us in prayer brother heavenly father we come before you once again thanking you for the message that was delivered to us let it take hold and sit in our hearts and change us and then the instant father because only you can do that so we ask that you take over just mold us into your will your perfection let us get out of that way father and i asked father also that all the requests and everything that was made earlier today as well that we know they're already done so we stand firm on our ground knowing that we're going to hear more testimonies and more witnessing of the wonderful your love and grace and mercy for us yes so i asked father not only that would you be with us give us your grace and your protection and help us through this week to come back and wednesday night to worship and sing with you and once again on sunday father because we know the times closer as you get closer the more excited we grow knowing we're going to be with you soon yes god sent you take care of us to give a safe journey home and just watch over us every day and lead us father yes we ask and name our lord and savior jesus christ so we pray we give you the honor and glory amen amen god bless you [Music] you
