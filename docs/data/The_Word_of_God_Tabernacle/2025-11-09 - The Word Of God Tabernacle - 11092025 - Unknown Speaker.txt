Good to have you as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. I uh thought probably since I started the streaming back during CO, I've probably thought 20 times about stopping the streaming. And about as soon as I get ready to think about stopping it, somebody will come up to me and say, "I'm glad you had the streaming." And I'm like, "Well, Lord, I guess I just take that as a sign that we're just supposed to keep it going." So, uh, we just keep it going. And I'm thankful. now that certain ones aren't even able to make it that we have it. So, amen. As long as I know, we'll just keep uh keep that going and just so thankful that uh if you're there, Amen. that God bless you as well. Welcome to the service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to be as much part of the service as we are here as much as can anyway. Amen. Praise the Lord. We're going to uh go in our in [clears throat] the scripture here to Ephesians chapter 4. We're going to pick up where we left off a couple weeks ago. Amen. It's uh been uh a little bit of time. We'll probably background a little bit of what we spoke on uh before we uh finished our service that Sunday. Uh but uh I believe we've had a service we missed because I wasn't feeling well and brother N. And uh but anyway, we'll just uh continue on with what the Lord gave us here. We're going to go to Ephesians. We're still in adoption. This will be part 31B. U we kind of spoke on it last time. Uh but it didn't quite uh get into all I wanted to with it. So figured that when I closed that last time, we said we'd just carry it on uh to try to complete this today. So this is kind of I guess you'd say part adoption part 31B. Last time was A. This will be the five-fold ministry. Um I guess part 4B. Last time was part four, so not sure how else to name it except that maybe. Uh but uh anyway, that's what we'll continue on today. So, Ephesians chapter 4. Before we read the word, we just bow our heads for a word of prayer. Lord, we're so very thankful again of this service, of this time, of this day. Thankful for these people. So glad, Lord, to be able to feel your presence and know that you're here among us today, God, to do the exceeding and abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think. Lord, without you, all of this is in vain. Lord, without you, I if I knew that you weren't here, I'd close this Bible and I'd walk out the door. There's no point in me being here. I We could have a nice normal discussion. We could do that around the We could go to the restaurant and do that, Lord. But we're here to meet with you, Lord. We're here. knowing that you are here, Father. And I wouldn't even open that Bible if I didn't know that you were here. And I'm so thankful, God, that you are. And that you, Lord, are the one to speak to us, to minister to us, for you, Lord, to take complete control over every fast of this service. Now, God, as we enter into this sacred time with the ministering of your word, expecting you to be with us, Lord. I listen the other day, and brother Brandham even exhorted the congregation. He's like, "You know what I'm waiting for, oh God. How any of us are defenseless. How any of us are useless without you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He was waiting on you, Lord. We are always trusting you to be with us, Lord. So, may you just anoint speaker and hear, and accomplish in this service that that you'd send it forth for, whatever purpose, Lord, for these people, those who may be watching, those who may be may watch this service later, Lord. whatever it may be, we just commit it into your hands, Lord. May you get the glory and honor for all that we do here, Lord. And as we worship you today and learn of you through your word, may you speak to us from this word. We commit it to you, Lord. Now, we ask it in the precious, holy, and lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Chapter Ephesians chapter 4. We'll just read a couple of verses here beginning with the 11th verse as we are all again on the five-fold ministry. He gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine which we went over fair fairly extensively last time and we will we will refer back on the doctrine in just a little bit. by the slight of men, cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in weight, excuse me, to deceive, but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. You can be seated if you'd like. Again, quite uh uh quite a powerful section of s of of of scripture that we have here to read and so much of it. Most of which we've kind of already touched on and went through, but I want to go back to second Timothy and read this just background. I probably won't spend but just a couple minutes on the backgrounding of where we left off from last week to try to bring it over, tie it into what we want to finish off with today. So, second Timothy chapter 2, uh we're going to go back to verse 14. We read this last time, but uh just to reiterate here, uh not to be quickly, I don't want to say quickly, but just to refresh our memories from this now. So 2 Timothy 2:14 of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting. Again remember we said that is the destruction of the hearer. The subverting is the destruction of the hearer. So it's to bring them back in remembrance charging before the Lord that we strive not about with these words to no profit to the destruction of the hearer. study to show thyself approved unto God. Amen. That is your that is the that appointment. Amen. Or or if we would just go back to our adoption, your calling election. Amen. Study, show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. Remember we talked rightly dividing last week, preaching that word correctly, teaching that word straight, bringing it direct and correct, not cutting corners, not trying to pamper, not trying to uh soothe over people's uh uh idiosyncrasies or or their spirits or whatever, but preaching that word truth, preaching that word straight, not holding back, not trying to be a a a a people pleaser. I guess if you will, but just preaching that word straight. Amen. Because if the if if it's a man of God preaching the word of God by God, the men and women, the sisters and brothers and sisters and the bride of Jesus Christ, they receive that word even if it rips the hide off of them. &gt;&gt; They take that word. They want to obey it. They want to live it. They want to become it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's that pull. It's that call. It's that deep calling to the deep. is calling that witnesses to them that this is the truth and that we need to make ourselves right. We need to get ourselves ready. We need to make sure that we are in the position and when the Lord calls uh uh calls us home, we're ready to go be with him. Amen. And the only way to do that is to become more like the word to to become more like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do we do that? By faith. How does faith come? By hearing. Hearing what? The word of God. The pure unadulterated word of God. Amen. So to rightly divide, to be able to rightly divide, to teach that word not just uh directly but correctly the truth. Amen. Unaird, unadulterated, not mixed with any man's idea, opinion, not mixed with anything that's uh from someone's thoughts or opinions, but the true pure word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're thankful that we know the message of the hour to be as such as well. Uh praise the Lord. So thank God we we received that word directly correctly right dividing the word but shun 16th verse now but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness. Now what is he talking about again? Uh I I just want to reiterate this again. What is he talking about? What is Paul referring to? Profane and vain babblings. Profane and vain. Anything is profane and vain is something that's against the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's against God. &gt;&gt; That's against the truth. &gt;&gt; Vain and profane is something that will injure people, that will hurt people, that will draw people away from God. Amen. That's why he goes on after this that increases to more ungodliness because all it takes is that little just that little bit which we'll probably we'll finish off with this in this message. But it just takes that little bit. It just takes that little crack in the door for the devil to get in. It only took one word in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It only took one word in the Garden of Eden with everything else he said. 99% truth. It just took that one word of error. It just took that one word off of the truth that God had spoken to bring this world into into the catastrophe that it's in today. Now, it didn't start that way. Amen. The day after the fall, THEY DIDN'T START BUILDING A HOSPITAL. The day after the fall, you didn't hear ambulances and sirens and police going around. You didn't hear guns firing and people killing each other. all that. But but over a period of time, it just took that one drop to bring it to where it is today. And now it's grown to this place. And he's talking about in a person's life receiving shame uh uh uh profane and vain babblings does nothing but increase to more and more and MORE UNGODLINESS. OH, GOD'S okay with this. &gt;&gt; God will forgive me for that. you know, God will let this slide or I'll ask for you or whatever the attitude or the thought might be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But all that does is lead to one more and one more and one more and before you know it, you're as far from God is the rank center. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, Brother Brandham even said &gt;&gt; that all it takes is a service. You miss a service. He said a service. Amen. I know sometimes we all miss at some point for different reasons, but he missed a service. He said it's easier if you miss a service to miss the next, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And then it becomes in multiplied. It's like compound interest. It becomes twice as easy to to miss the next one. And then that much easier to miss the next one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What's it doing? It's just compounding to more and more ungodliness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Then he begins to mention names and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom Himenius and Felitus which we mentioned last time he called names their word who concerning the truth have aired which means what they're bringing to the people is vain and profane. Why? Because it's not the pure word anymore. It's hybrid. It's added to a man's idea or opinion. They've aired saying that the resurrection is passed already and overthrow the faith of some of some overthrow the faith of some because remember especially this day the bride cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It would be so close that it would deceive the elect, but it can't deceive the elect. So, thank God it cannot deceive the elect. But it brings us to an understanding to make sure that we that we are uh that we are tight. We're secure on that uh on on the truth of God's word. That's why you don't take uh I I'll say it this way. Don't take brother Brandham's word for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was going to say my word, but I'll go even deeper. Don't take brother Brandham's word for it. &gt;&gt; You take what he said to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If God is in your life, God will reveal to you that what he said is from this word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. It's scripture. Amen. He said, "We added this and this," but it didn't add to the word. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like when brother Random thought that when he was going to uh prepare to pre to preach the seals. &gt;&gt; At one time, brother Random said that that he thought the seals would be would be something that wasn't in the word that was just going to come and bring and be a a a great revelation of something uh to the people that wasn't in the scripture. And then the Lord showed him that can't BE BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS IF YOU ADD TO THIS word or take a word from this word, amen, the plagues will be added or your name will be taken out of the book of life. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So it can't be anything that's not already here. What was it? It was word that was previously hidden. &gt;&gt; That it took a prophet. It took a rightly divining gift to bring that truth to the people. Amen. It wasn't adding to anything. It was taking what was already there that was hidden and brought a revelation of a truth of it. And if you look at that, you'll recognize it if any of you say, "Well, that's just his opinion." Well, look at that opinion. You know, I like uh I I I like one time brother Green said uh people say, "Well, that's just his opinion." And he's like, "Well, I'd rather take his opinion than anybody else's." [laughter] &gt;&gt; I I sat there and thought about that for a minute. I thought, you know, that's probably right. I think I'd probably take his opinion over anybody else's. So, I guess that's all right. But if you look at that, when it's brought and revealed by the word by Christ, it's going to follow in line with the scripture, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's not going to go outside the scripture. &gt;&gt; It's going to fall within the confines of Genesis 1 to Revelation 22. And that's what you find when you recognize what brother Brandham brought was the pure word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And any minister or anybody that tries to expound that word must fall in that same place. Yes. &gt;&gt; Regardless of what they say, it must be according to the word. That's why, like brother null said last week and I reiterated when I got up here, if it's something that hasn't been said, something that has been revealed, something brother Brandham didn't say or whatever timing of something, whatever, I always tell you in my opinion, I always make sure you understand this is my opinion. This is the way I feel about it. Can't find anywhere where brother Brandham expounds on it or in the scripture. But in my opinion, this is what I believe. But I base my opinion on the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I try to derive the way I feel about it from what the word has already said. Amen. Not just come off a cuff of something that I just want to be or something I want to say or whatever. Be important or anything like that. Who could I could care less about that. Amen. I'm about to be 60. being important is not significant in my life anymore. I don't care. I just want to be what he wants me to be. &gt;&gt; But make sure that you know that's that it is the word. It is the word. Amen. That's the number one thing is it it must be the pure unadulterated word because faith only comes by hearing the pure unadulterated word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the scripture does not contradict itself in any way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no place in this Bible that it contradicts itself. You can look and look at it with a normal thinking or understanding and people would think with an education that it contradicts itself. But if you look at the whole the scripture as a whole by revelation, there's no contradiction. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; None at all. If there's anything in there that doesn't work right, you go back and you find out where you got off because there's nothing wrong with this. You must find out if something's not working according to what you feel, believe, teach, preach, whatever, you go back and find out where you got off. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this is not wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got to be the the faults got to lie with us. Now, u with our backgrounding, let's go back. Let's go u over to Well, let's just stay in second Timothy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just stay in second Timothy on the in the fourth chapter as Paul spends a great deal of time in Timothy speaking about ministry and ministering. Amen. There's a a lot more of course in here that we won't go into, but that is important for us to know and see. Now, second Timothy chapter 4, let's look at beginning with the first verse. He says, "I charge ye therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing in his kingdom, preach the word." Praise the Lord. That is the greatest exclamation I know of. If a minister in Christ, that's the number one thing I know of, preach the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Any of these five-fold ministry would fall in the category of preaching the word. Right? &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, a preacher is a preacher." Well, no. To me, every one of these five-fold ministry is a preacher. &gt;&gt; Every one of them is a preacher in some way, shape, or form because a preacher is a carrier of the gospel, a carrier of the good news. And the good news comes through that five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which then in turn comes through all of us, every one of us, &gt;&gt; because we are the good news, &gt;&gt; the gospel. Preach the word. Now be instant in season, out of season, whatever the situation may be, &gt;&gt; be ready. Amen. That's why we just read when when he told Timothy over here, "Study to show thyself approved." Amen. That you are God called. Amen. Now he's saying, "Preach, be instant, in season, out of season." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Be ready. Whatever the situation, circumstances, be ready. Praise the Lord. for when the Lord might call. Reprove. Now, let's look at these few things for a minute. Preach the word. So, this is to a preacher, to a minister, to one of the fivefold. Be instant in season, out of season. That is uh that is paramount for any minister. Any of the five. We're talking about any and all of the five here. Now, [snorts] reprove. Amen. Minister is to reprove. What is reprove? Reprove is to tell one's fault and correction. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Reprove is to is to it sort of like we just said about rightly dividing. Amen. But tell one's fault and then the correction of that fault. [snorts] How does a person know that they're wrong unless they are told they're wrong? &gt;&gt; Right? And how can a person correct themselves unless they know what the correction is? I had uh uh dinner with uh a guy that used to be on my team lives in El Paso. He can when he comes through and goes to Phoenix, he calls me, we go out and have a meal, lunch or dinner, whatever it is. And we were talking about it and um uh there was this one time we did a job and somebody came through and was saying that different things were wrong. And so he was he was telling me I was we were reliving this this been a couple years ago and he went to our team manager and he said, "Well, what did I do wrong?" See, I did it this way. I thought that was the right way to do it. It's wrong. Well, then tell me what's wrong. Show me what's wrong. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And then once YOU'VE SHOWED ME WHAT'S WRONG, TELL ME HOW TO DO IT RIGHT. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S THE BEST WAY that the next time you do it, it'll be done correctly. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The next time I do it, I'll make sure and do it correctly. &gt;&gt; So that there so that it's not wrong next time. And that's what it is in our lives to understand that we are to reprove, tell a fault, tell a wrong and a correction. Amen. You're not supposed to live this way. You're supposed to live this way. You're not supposed to do this, you're supposed to do that. Amen. Through the scripture to make sure understand, I want to be right. And anybody that's Holy Ghost filled in the word wants to be right. They want to be right with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. A lot of people don't understand or even know what right is. And right is becoming uh uh used to be a line that was drawn in the sand that you didn't cross. But people have gotten so far away from that line anymore, it's a dot to them, if even a dot, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because they're so far removed from it, they don't EVEN KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT ANYMORE. People just started saying, like even important figures that have influence over millions of people, just do what feels good to you. &gt;&gt; Just do what feels right in your eyes. Well, in some PEOPLE'S EYES, DOING RIGHT means to take a gun and shoot somebody dead. THAT'S WHAT'S RIGHT TO THEM, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; They're righteous in doing this, but it's not right. I had a guy in the car one time. He's like, "Well, how do we know?" I said, "By the word." By the scripture. &gt;&gt; Say, "I want to be pleasing to God." He said, "Well, how do I know what's pleasing to God?" READ YOUR BIBLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT TELLS YOU WHAT'S pleasing to God and what God hates. Know what it says. Let God reveal it to you and show you in there what he likes and doesn't like, &gt;&gt; right? and and and understand how to do it correctly the next time, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And live a life that's pleasing to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what a minister is supposed to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, there may be facets of these because we're going to go through reprove, re rebuke, exhort. Um there may be parts of these that one of the ministry may lean on a little heavier than another. Amen. There may be a part of one or two parts of the five-fold ministry. I won't get into specifics, but they may may lean a little heavier on the reprove part than maybe another minister might. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Or another ministry might. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] But they're all to the place that [clears throat] they see wrong to call it out. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To call to preach the truth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. To tell one's fault to bring it correctly. Amen. Reprove. To rebuke. Now, it sounds like a word that we probably all know, but rebuke is to straightly charge. It's to hold a person accountable. It's to hold them responsible. Straightly charge them. Amen. That's why I think Paul said over here, bring to their remembrance. Remind them this is the way it is. This is what we do. This is how we act. This is how we live. Yes. &gt;&gt; Remind them. Bring them to THE POINT. STRAIGHTLY CHARGE them and show them. Make them responsible for it. make them ha uh be held accountable because that's where you know that's when you know you belong is when you have an accountability. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You don't belong to anything when there's no accountability. When there's nothing that you have to reflect on to look to to be responsible for there there's no there's no value in life unless you're responsible. There's no value in life unless there's some kind of that goes back again to the root of our whole subject here of adoption. Yes, &gt;&gt; there's no belonging. There's no feeling of of purpose. If you don't have some kind of responsibility, some kind of I guess as they would call it, skin in the game, there's no skin in the game, then most of the time people don't care. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um I I've heard people say horribly uh before and I it just makes me sick in my stomach say well you know this horrible thing happened to this family daughter's killed or something and they're like well that wasn't that that's not my family or that wasn't in my city or that wasn't so and so such so. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where is the compassion? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where's the empathy? Where's the love? Yes. &gt;&gt; Where's the where is the the simple human decency to feel for someone else's infirmity like that &gt;&gt; and and and to walk a mile in his moccasins? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. What if that were you? &gt;&gt; Straightly charged. What if that was you? But a lot of times if it's if if there's no skin in the game, they don't care. It it doesn't bother them. It's not in their home. It's not in their family. it's not a part of their lives. Whatever it is, they don't care. And that's the loss of humanity that we've lost in this world today. The loss of humanity that people just don't seem to care as far as human decencies decency is concerned. That's why ministry is there supposed to be to straightly charge a person. Have responsibility. &gt;&gt; Take responsibility. Amen. Charge them. This is as much your fault or as much as belongs to you as anybody else. &gt;&gt; Everybody wants the prize, but they don't want to pay the cost to get it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. They want the reward, but they don't want what it takes to get to the reward, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The fight, the struggle, the the heartache sometime to get to that place. People don't want to do that. But that's why I minister should straightly charge. Amen. to understand this is A BODY, A BRIDE BODY. We are the body of Jesus Christ, the mystical body of Jesus Christ. Internationally, there's multitudes of people. I was going to say millions, but I don't know if there is or not. Whatever the number is, but there's multitudes because I know that's what the Bible says. THERE'S MULTITUDES OF PEOPLE THAT BELONG in that body that are part of that family. And [snorts] I'm AS RESPONSIBLE TO it as anybody else is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care what position you hold, who you are, where you live, where you go to church. YOU ARE AS RESPONSIBLE TO THIS BRIDE BODY as anybody else is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's ours to be responsible for my like it's like brother Bam even talked about in a church, just in a single church. He said one unconfessed sin can cause someone else from getting their healing. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; One unconfessed sin just in the whole body. &gt;&gt; That's the charge to all of us. Not the person that was sick. He didn't talk about the person that was sick. He said anybody in that church. That's responsibility of that church in that position. We're all responsible to all of it. We're all responsible. We're all responsible to every one of us. this body worldwide. We're all in much a part of it. If I'm holding this rapture back, Lord, help me &gt;&gt; to get right. Lord, help me to do whatever I need to do. Go talk to whoever need to talk to, bring in whoever I need to bring in. If I'm doing something to hold IT UP, LORD, HELP ME. I WANT TO get it right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I am responsible. &gt;&gt; Yes. It could be my fault that these people over in China are going through what they're or uh oh, where is it? They're getting Nigeria. Christians are just getting slaughtered like it's the dark ages all over again, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Just burned and and and and every manner of of of murder killings that you can think of these people. And now not Somalia, I think even different places. Christians. Christians. I I see and they're bright. But Christians, which we're part of, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; we are all a part of this Christendom that we're all a part of this Christians being slaughtered and murdered, persecuted. THAT'S A THAT'S MY BROTHER AND SISTER. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We cannot turn a blow to it. Amen. We need to be responsible. Amen. There's nothing we can do but what else God has given us. Go down face first and pray for those people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Pray for this body. Pray for those Christians. Pray for those people. Amen. Because we're all a part of the same family of God. Amen. In one way, shape, or form. We're all a part of it. And that's the rebuke. Rebuke to charge. Straightly charge. make sure that we are in the place that we're supposed to be with the Lord. Exhort. Now, a lot of people probably like that. Exhort. To teach, to strengthen, and encourage. To teach, to strengthen, and encourage goes along with the uh the uh ma the Ephesians 4 that we read. Amen. the things that the perfecting of the saints to the edifying to the building up of the body of Christ to exhort. Amen. There's a lot of exhortion that goes on exertion. Exhortion that goes on in a ministry in a in a in a preaching. If a man is called of God and he was under the operation influence of the Holy Spirit, God's got something to say to us. &gt;&gt; There's a there's an appointed time. There's an appointed place. God's got a reason and a purpose. He wants to talk to us. He wants to say something. Amen. The children of Israel one time, they said, "Won't don't don't let Moses speak to us anymore. We want to hear direct from God." They heard from God one time and they fell on their face said, "NO MORE. NO, NO. WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM GOD. PLEASE, MOSES, WE JUST YOU speak for God. WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR HIM ANYMORE." [laughter] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Then Mo then God started using Moses again. They learned their lesson pretty quick. I want to hear. Well, if God's doing that, he's got a purpose. He's got a reason. God wants to say something. God wants to tell us something. Amen. So, it's an exhortion, a teaching to bring us all to that place, amen, of understanding that the Lord would speak to us. Exhort, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. Longsuffering is endurance and patience. Longsuffering. We know as our God, our Lord is very much long-suffering. Amen. With the patience that he displays to the humanity as a whole, if you will, the patience that God is I I think that patience that that cup of iniquity is like one drop from overflowing at this point. But longsuffering. Amen. Patience. Uh endure with patience. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it takes time to bring to that place. And doctrine. And doctrine. to make sure we follow the truth of the doctrine. Doctrine is that that was correctly spoken the the the correctly spoken I'll just say it this way. The correctly spoken word of God to his people to his children that that has been said that that has been brought is doctrine. We receive it as doctrine correct doctrine. Amen. Because uh that's why we that's why we also have what we call a cood book conduct order doctrine. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That we have in this message. Yes. &gt;&gt; That we believe is the truth that come from the prophet that we have for this day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And some of what his opinions are. But the opinions derived from the scripture, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; that brother Brandham had. People would ask him questions of questions of opinion. Amen. I got one here I'm going to read just a minute. Uh it's it's basically a question of opinion. Amen. You can drive it from the scripture but it's just opinion &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. But that's what we believe. But now doctrine of some issue the Catholic Church they pride themselves in their doctrine. Where does their doctrine derive from? From the pope. Amen. They take very little of the scripture. They don't that they they they follow it as a guideline if you will but it's not absolute to them. The pope is absolute. If the pope says something against what this word says, then they believe him instead of this because he's the viker. He's here in place of Christ. That's what vicarious filidi in place of Christ. He's here in place of uh he's he's supposedly the anointed here in place of Christ. So if he says something contrary to this word, they believe him. And that is their doctrine, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They believe that. Amen. Doctrine is that. That's but now we're looking at not just doctrine but correct doctrine. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Right doctrine that that's been brought revealed through the Holy Spirit through God through individual by God through individual. God is bringing that truth and correct doctrine. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's important. A lot of people say, "Well, they don't want doctrine." Well, no. We got to have doctrine. Doctrine is important to us. Amen. It's the word. the foundation of what we believe, what we hold true and dear. This word that's been preached is doctrine. Amen. But we do it with the correctness of what the scripture says. We don't take somebody else's word for it. That's why I told you. Amen. They'll take the pope's word. I'm telling you, don't take brother Bam's word. Don't take my word. Don't take Perry Green's word. Don't take Eddie Biscos's word. Don't take Donnie Reagan's word. Don't take any MAN'S WORD. TAKE WHAT GOD SAID. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And then you compare. Now, if that man is speaking what God said, praise the Lord. We all celebrate in that. We all worship in that. And I believe Brother Brandham did. Fact, I know he did. It's not even a belief to me anymore. It's a know. I know he did. Amen. I try my best to do the same. The Lord, by the help of the Holy Spirit, I try my best to do the same. I believe these other pe other brothers as well. It wasn't a slight on brother Green. I believe he did. Amen. Eddie Biscll or D, I put those names out there. I believe they do. I believe them to be men of God. &gt;&gt; And that's that's the way it's supposed to be. But we don't just take their word. We study for ourselves and make sure &gt;&gt; that that doctrine, what has been spoke is correct. It is right. It is what God has told us. Now, let's continue on with this scripture reading because I [snorts] got one other place uh well, maybe two other places before we close. Amen. [clears throat] So we'll read it. Preach the word. Be innocent in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when when they will not endure sound doctrine, correct doctrine, true doctrine. Amen. What time is that? Right now. today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not saying it started today. I think it started years ago, &gt;&gt; but it's here now to where they people come to a place where they will not endure sound doctrine. But after their own loss, that means doing what they want to do. Amen. It doesn't mean necessarily a a a an affair, a man or woman or something. No, it doesn't have to be that. It's just a lustful act, &gt;&gt; right? It's just a lustful idea. It's it's lustful is something that is pleasing to your flesh, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what lustful is. Something that's just pleasing to your flesh. People just want to do whatever they think is right. &gt;&gt; They want to do whatever they think feels good. &gt;&gt; Whatever in their opinion might be something that's it's it's okay to do. And in a lot of times nowadays in people's eyes, almost anything is okay, &gt;&gt; right? But that's what lust after their own lust shall he themselves teachers having itching ears because you can find a minister out there anywhere that'll condone whatever conduct you want to that you want to give live be. Amen. There's churches I' I've seen one down the street. I mean there there's ones that they don't care if you think you're man or woman. They don't care if you're uh homosexual. They don't care if you're uh whatever situation. They don't care. Every anything and everything's okay. You find you'll find I think I told y'all this story one time. I'll tell it real quick. When I was uh in Charlotte was working purchasing. Uh I was under the pering manager at the time and we had salesman call on us and the guy that considered himself a Christian called and he was always talking to Roy and tell him about God and you know and God Roy was he was he was like the the nom the the quintessential nominal person. uh he went to church Christmas and Easter probably at that and you know uh he was he would always try to tell him he said well you go to church he's you know he didn't go to church really that I knew of he didn't belong to one I think he went maybe like say Christmas and Easter and he said but and [clears throat] this man who is a Christian told him said church is like a glove you just go until you find one that fits I'm like what a subtle lie the devil that is &gt;&gt; amen Amen. &gt;&gt; I sat cuz I'm sitting across the hall from in my office doing my work and I'm listening to this and it piqus my attention because he's talking about God of course and I'm listening and said and when he says that I I I raise up I remember it vividly. I raise up and I'm thinking my what a lie that is you just go try to find a church that that fits you. That's not the purpose of being a Christian. Purpose of being a Christian is so that you are molded to there's only one glove and that's God's glove. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care what church wear, who preacher, there's only one glove. It's God's glove. And we are to mold ourselves. We are supposed to be molded to fit his glove. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Period. No chat, church, whatever denomination. I don't care what it is. We're not to we're not to try to find a glove that fits us. No, we're supposed to change our lives and the way we live and who we are to fit his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the only way that we're acceptable to God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that's what it's trying to say. These people have lust. So they go trying to find a preacher and find a preacher that agrees with the way they live and what they do and how they are and everything and said, "It's okay. You're fine. You're good." You know, that's going to be a lot of help, a lot of accountability on the day of judgment, friend. Especially for people who think they're holding these higher positions, such as a pastor in a church that tells these people they're okay and say, "We love you. Live as you are." Oh, what that that's the fastest way to hell that I know of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. To just be who you are. Live just live how you are. That's the That's the quickest way to go to hell that I know of. You must change. You must let your life reflect Jesus Christ. You must become like this word. You must let the Holy Spirit come and mold you and make you and shape you into his image. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God will accept you when he can see his reflection in the mirror. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he looks at you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When he looks at you, he wants to see his own reflection. Yes. &gt;&gt; That reflection is the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And until we come to the place that we're reflection of that, then we've fallen short. Amen. It's not finding, but you'll find it. They want to endure sound doctrine. So what do they do? They go find some place because they have lustes and they find some place teacher having itch and ears that'll just say whatever they want them to hear and you'll be okay and just keep on going with life. All is well. Amen. Would you like some company? Uh would you like some company drinking that fifth of whiskey? Would you like some company drinking that smoking that cigarette? Would you I mean you know that's just what about what it's become. It's all good. Well I don't live that way but it's okay if they do. No, it's not &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; No, not to God it's not. I mean, you're a free moral agent. You can live how you want, but not to God. &gt;&gt; To God, it's not all right. They have teachers having itchy ear. And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. That's that vain and profane babblings that he was talking about over in the second chapter. [snorts] But watch thou in all things. Endure afflictions. do the work of an evangelist. Remember what God spoke to brother Brandham about that. I heard brother Brandham reiterate that the other day when God told him he said he said now he didn't tell me I was an evangelist. Notice brother Brandham said he didn't say I was an evangelist. He just told me to do the work of an evangelist. Amen. Make full proof of that. And that'll help in a minute when I read this quote. Make full proof of thy ministry for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. Praise the Lord. What a wonderful saying that any of us should be able to say. Any of us should by the grace of God be able to say. Let me read this [snorts] questions and answers to get to this. As I've mentioned, an opinion &gt;&gt; that people are asking. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How does one know? I think I've read this the other day, but I didn't read the whole thing. How does one know their rightful position in the body of Christ? How does one know? Brother Ram said that's a very good one. How does that'd be kind of a question amongst many of us here tonight. How do you rightfully know? Now I'm presuming this brother wants to know what position uh part in Christ that they play. Now for instance, and it's it's brother Brown is giving his opinion based on scripture. For instance, I'd say like this, brother, to give you the best answer I know your position. Christ is revealed to you by the Holy Spirit. And [snorts] then if you want to know whether it's the Holy Spirit or not, find out whether he blesses what you're doing or not. And if he blesses it, then that's him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Like someone said to me not long ago said, "Lord called me to preach." I said, "Well, then preach." I really think it's so uh Satan if he can just get somebody to act like that and then deceive them. That's just what he wants to do. Then the world the whole uh the whole world points their finger right there. Somebody thinks that they have a a gift of speaking in tongues, interpretation, the gift of divine healing and some things like this. Sometimes they're mistaken in those things. See, sometimes they think they haven't gotten it when they do have it. It's so very tricky. He said, [snorts] "So always do this, brethren. Whether you feel that you're supposed to do a thing, first find out if it's scriptural or not for you to do it. If it is in the scripture, not just wrote in one place, but I mean completely scriptural, which is a good way of putting it. If it's scriptural, not just scripture, but scriptural, a scripture could just be one scripture, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Scriptural means it runs through the whole the whole Bible." Amen. He said, "Not just a scripture, but is it scriptural?" Amen. Now, uh not just wrote in one place. If you'd be an evangelist, pastor, teacher, prophet, whatever that God has called you, if you had the gift of tongues, interpretation, any of these nine spiritual gifts in the church, the four spiritual offices of the church, any position, first see if it's God called. And usually way I watch for myself. See this is me. I watch how he even says this is me. Uh I watch the nature of a person. See what kind of a gift that they're professing. And God and see God will work with his creature the way he's made him. And he'll make a creature if you see him uh real flighty going on. I think I may have paraphrased this the other day. He said, "The Lord called me to be such and such to be a pastor." Now a pastor can't be a flighty person. &gt;&gt; A pastor's solid sound. See, God called me to be a teacher. Watch him how he interprets the word. He gets things all mixed up and everything. Then you can tell not a teacher. Amen. See, but then the thing you do your position usually don't whether you can or cannot do it. Now, when God called me, he said to be an evangelist, he said, "I wanted to be a pastor." And I thought staying at home here would be just fine. And the Lord called me. And finally, all the people got together. There's not a one of them left here tonight. Um, they cry went on uh 1717 Spring Street. The lady, Miss Hawkins, over there uh met me crying [clears throat] during depression. goes on. He says, "And I'll allowance my children at the table if you'll only build a tabernacle." Now, he's this lady imploring Brother Brandham, be a pastor. Build a church. Have a church for us to go to. My children need help. We need to go to church. Have a church. Brother Brandham, if you'd just be a pastor, build a church. See, the call of other people asking things that basically was really against the will of God. But from a sincere heart, she sincerely wanted what she wanted. Amen. For her children to be in church, have a good church to go to. She said, "I'll allowance my children a table if you'll just only build a tabernacle." He said, "My calling was an evangelist. The Lord laying right here the cornerstone. If I could burst that in tonight, you'll uh see a fly leaf off my Bible where he told me to be an evangelist." See, and I wasn't a successful pastor. never would be because I haven't got the patience and what it takes to be a pastor. See, so therefore, if I tried to be a pastor, I would just be as far out as a pastor is trying to be an evangelist. &gt;&gt; Be what God called you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The fruits will manifest themselves. Brother Brandham felt like he would just be a pastor, that he would just um stay at home and be be at home and be there and have his church and go to church and uh help the people around the neighborhood and stuff and just and just be a pastor. But that's not what God called him. Called and said, "Do the work of an evangelist." Again, he wasn't an evangelist, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But he did the work of an evangelist. He wasn't a pastor, but he did the work of a pastor, did he not? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, what what were these private interviews about it? Not being a pastor. Uh he wasn't a teacher, but did he teach? &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; absolutely. Even we know he was a prophet. So, I mean, and we know he was a missionary. We know uh the overseas and all. So, to me, this word prophet filled every position. I I I believe he was the fulfillment of each one of the positions that was given to him based at the time and the need. Amen. Under the circumstance. That's my opinion. Brother Graham never says that. Amen. But you look at the things I just offered you as examples as evidence to why I draw that conclusion. Maybe we come to our the same conclusion. 1 Timothy 4. Now, let's get to this couple more times on this doctrine. We'll close. Um, first Timothy, 1 Timothy 4, 1 Timothy 4, not second Timothy this time. 1 Timothy 4. Now the spirit speaketh expressedly that in the latter times, that is today. Some shall depart from the faith. We just read about that over in second Timothy. Giving heed to seducing spirits and what kind of doctrines? Of devils. doctrines of devils. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. These are doctrines that did not ar derive from the scripture. They derived from a man &gt;&gt; or or humanity, if you will. Somebody derived this this doctrine, built churches on them. Amen. Such as the Catholic Church, built on these doctrines. Amen. But they're doctrines of devils because they're not according to the scripture. &gt;&gt; They must be according to the word. Amen. These doctrines of devils, these are these winds of doctrine &gt;&gt; that Ephesians 4, we wrote many read many times. Ephesians 4 teaches us that we be not children tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine. What do we talk about that wind being? Disturbance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Disturbance. doctrines of devils. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; See, it it's it's beautiful how a minister, you can take brother Brandham's messages and look, Brother Bam can have a message titled the same thing on three different tapes and you listen to it and and you can hear a couple of scriptures that was the same, but a lot of the message is different. It'll vary a little bit, actually a great deal in a lot of cases because it's trying to get to these points. You bring it all together to find this point that he's trying to make. How many places here? I've only got a few that he goes into and talks about these these evil doctrines, these doctrines of devils, these winds of doctrine. That's what the ministering a pure true ministering of the word, the pure and adulterated word will bring a a faith to a people that won't wander around to every wind of doctrine. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Every wind of doctrines of devils. Yes, &gt;&gt; they won't worry about going to find somebody with a teacher having itching ears that'll just be a people pleaser. Someone that'll rightly divide the word and preach the truth, repro, rebuke, reprove with, exhort with all longsuffering. See? &gt;&gt; Amen. giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron. &gt;&gt; My friend, if we don't have if we don't have a humanity today whose conscience is seared, numbed, dead, I don't know what is &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Seared with a hot arm. You know, you sear something with a hot iron, it becomes numb. You kill the you sear sear the end of your finger, it comes numb. You'll kill you'll kill the nerve ends in that finger, you won't be able to feel anymore. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's what people have gotten. They don't have any feeling anymore. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Seared with a hot iron to where they can't there's no feeling in their conscience. He says their conscience in their very soul in the place of reason. THERE'S NO CONSCIENCE. IT'S SEARED WITH A HOT IRON, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? No feeling. There's nothing there because there's nothing. It's it's all numb. Poor, miserable, blind, wretched, naked, and what? Don't even know it. &gt;&gt; Knowest thou not that you're poor, miserable, blind, wretched, know this le to see us. Saints, God, it's a miracle that anybody comes out of this lessa. I thank God that I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's horrible, horrible time. Conscience here with a hot iron. One more. We're going to close. Matthew 16. St. Matthew chapter 16. Read on this again. Verse six. And Jesus said unto them, "Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees." Now again, you know what leaven is? Levan is something like that helps with the dough to rise and stuff. Sort of like yeast. Uh but all it takes the the thing of the leaven is remember the scripture says a little leaven leavenveneth the whole lump right &gt;&gt; right so it doesn't take an entire uh gallon of leaven to ruin of course I say ruin because taught them against the leaven uh to to ruin something all it takes is a drop all it takes is just a smidge &gt;&gt; and that little bit remember will grow unto godliness and ungodliness and lead unto more ungodliness lead unto more ungodliness. That little bit of leaven. Amen. Now he's he's telling them beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And they reasoned among themselves saying is it is because we have taken no bread which when Jesus perceived he said unto them oh ye of little faith why reason ye among yourselves because ye have no bread brought no bread? Do you not understand? Neither remember the five loaves, the 5,000, and how many baskets he took up, neither the seven loaves of the 4,000, how many baskets he took up? You worried about bread? You worried you didn't bring any bread? You've already seen me multiply bread unto thousands and thousands of people. How is it that How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread that ye should beware of the leavenven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leavenven of bread, but of the doctrine, the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; What is the beware of the doctrine? the doctrine itself. Yes. But in but in comparing it to leaven, he compared it to levan as the understanding back in the garden of Eden where it doesn't take a whole bushel of leaven just a drop. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; All it takes is for you just to disbelieve on one point. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Compromise on a scripture. &gt;&gt; Disbelieve a scripture. common connives something else in your mind of what that scripture quote unquote means rather than what it says. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we get to the place that that leaven, what is it? Grows unto more and to more unrighteousness. It grows unto more and more godliness. Amen. A little levan. That's why Jesus warned them to beware of that leaven. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take much. you just believe this little bit here and this little bit here. I know brother Ram talked about, you know, if you can't if you can't get a go to a church, go to go to a church. If you can't get a whole loaf, just get a slice or something like that. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But you got But he also told us that those denominations are the mark of the beast. And don't don't join yourself up to it, too. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Beware what? Of the doctrine. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Beware of the leaven. It doesn't take much to bring impurity. Doesn't take much leaven in a bread to to leaven the whole lump. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Doesn't take much doctrine to believe to go off and build one thing to the next and one thing to the next. Amen. Every wind of doctrine, &gt;&gt; every doctrine of devils. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it's so important that the minister be a God- called man to be able to rightly divide that word so that that word comes forth in the purity and the rightness the righteousness truth that it is to bring faith to a people. Amen. &gt;&gt; To bring rap more so just in even faith rapturing faith to a people in this day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need more of that to bring rapturing faith. That's why I believe there had to be this time that this prophet came to bring this message to unveil those seals and to church ages. All that the word that we have that were at our disposal that that God brought through a prophet. All of that is necessary. We we ingest, we take in and believe all of that that it brings us to that place of of faith in in Christ. Faith in what we know is truth. Faith in what we're in a body change in what we're about to experience is going home to be with the Lord in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It all brings us to that same place. Amen. God has that five-fold ministry in that place for that point to the foolishness of preaching that it might save the soul. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. People look at it as foolishness, but God looks at it as his way of bringing. Again, remember they tried one time. We don't want to hear Moses and God speak. They one one short blast of that and they were done with that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's a reason. There's a purpose. A lot of people lose the understanding, the reason, purpose, why we come to church, why we listen to preaching, why we have live ministry, and don't just press play. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. We do. Because we believe that to be the truth. And anybody that presses play, listens, they'll hear who they hear on THAT PRESS PLAY TELL you to go to church to a minister. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's stand if we could. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Take heed. Beware. It's a word that God brings to us that we stand true on. Faith comes by hearing that word. Hearing and hearing that word. Praise God for it. Correctly. Teaching of doctrine of truth. God brings it to us that we believe it. We receive it. We accept it as truth. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. Let's uh let's just let's just sing this little course again here we have in the book we already have on the screen. Your Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary. Praise the [music] Lord. Comes in the same way, saints. Amen. Comes in the same way. We believe it to be so. We desire that with all our hearts. Let's sing now.

He wants to live through us. He wants to speak through us. He wants to walk in our shoes. He wants to use our hands. He wants to [music] use our voice. He wants to be He wants us to be the extension of him on this earth today. God help us. In some cases, probably in most cases today, it's probably more of being a judgment on others than it is anything else. Amen. But we try to witness to people to help them understand there is a better way. &gt;&gt; There's a right way. There's a true way. Amen. Praise the Lord. And we know that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to share it with others. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But when they get But if they refuse it and get on the other side, they can't look up there and say, "Well, God, I didn't know." Well, let me play it back for you and let you see. This is where this is where Dennis, this is where Sheilia, this where Ralph told. This is where they told you. Amen. Here it is. And what can they do? hang their head in shame because they know it's true. &gt;&gt; In front of that light, in front of that great light, every bit of it comes comes to a reality comes comes to light. Amen. There's no hiding it then. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. The only thing hidden, the only thing in that is annihilated and done away with is your sin. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That is not replayable. That is not on rewind. That tape that that book, Brother Brandon said, was thrown in the sea of forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; you stand perfect before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I just love that. Praise the Lord Jesus. God bless you. Pray something was said to bless and strengthe you today. Appreciate you coming. Appreciate if you were watching today. Amen. I appreciate the Lord. Just pray God would just strengthen you and bless you along the way and keep us amen through the week. If he blesses us with another day, we'll have another day.
