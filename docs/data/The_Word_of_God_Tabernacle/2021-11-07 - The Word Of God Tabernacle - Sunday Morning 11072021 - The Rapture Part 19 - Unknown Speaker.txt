TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the day after joel's birthday i think it was and she said if you want to see your mother alive you better get here now so that's when i changed my plans from tuesday to the wednesday i believe it was their thursday and i got there that afternoon my mom passed that next morning but i was so thankful although my mom knew exactly how i felt i knew exactly how she felt but it just did a lot for me personally to be able to tell my mom exactly to pour my heart out to to to say my last say uh to my mom before she went across she couldn't respond but the little tear that came out of the corner of her eyes said it all to me so uh that that meant a lot to me so i i just personally selfishly would like brother roger to get there before his dad crosses over but whatever the lord's will would be amen so just remember that family and them in prayer if you would and of course uh brother roger's mother this morning from sister norma she said her husband ronnie is woke up today not feeling as well as he did um and was coughing during the night but she let him cough while she slept because she really needed to sleep she said uh but she said his fever broke three days ago so as you know he did test positive when your fever's broke then that's it you're over it but i've heard now the symptoms will leaks especially the cough uh i've heard the cough especially nate nate garcia him he had gotten it and he said he just the cough late after a month or more after so uh but anyway his fever has broke he's been fever-free for three days so she's thankful to god for that she's thankful that she has remained to be able to take care of him so we appreciate that very much the lord's goodness to him there amen anyone else have a spoken prayer request you'd like to mention today brother collins baptized me in 1965. amen praise the lord that's tyrant praise the lord brother rogers dad baptized brother pat the year i was born probably baptized before i was born because it was december 15th but amen wonderful that's wonderful anyone else yes down so i just dear to tell you um the lady that i drive around has a neighbor that he's a retired navy officer and he's in a wheelchair and for the assisted living that they're in he helps pull all the weeds leave the bowl and this is in a wheelchair he just gets bored and does all this around well a couple weeks ago he reached down and a rattlesnake bit him and so we prayed for him i forgot to mention it but i told the lady i was with i will definitely pray he's finally home his hands a little bit black and blue but he's doing really good so just keep praying and just completely healed because he's such a nice man praise the lord remember that he wouldn't pray also i failed to mention a couple weeks ago that brother alex overlook had a knee replacement surgery so please remember him in prayer appreciate that i talked to him the other day doing a lot better knees coming along he's getting around uh so we're thankful for that but just keep brother alex in your prayer you remember remember remember brother alex tall very thin thunder mustache good brother just a sweet brother he called me the other day he has another chili pink plant for my wife so i'll go get that this week but he was telling me about the surgery so please remember him anybody else real quick before i went to a station for an oil change and they did something to it and the light went off after that after i got gas so i'm i want to go back to them i don't i just i'm i'm praying that please you know let the light go off when i go through my missions amen so it's still off well no it came back on it goes on and it's been on for years but and i always go through missions and god gets me through and then it's on the rest of the years i

praise the lord amen anyone have a song or testimony on your heart today thank you i want to thank the lord he guided me my lease car i had a three year lease and it was to purchase it so i just tuesday spent like five hours at the dealership and they did all the steps and then it was approved well there was like a lockdown in their computer system so that it was such a feeling that i was just walking through what the lord had already made away from amen praise the lord praise the lord amen so it's yours amen praise the lord it's hard to believe it's been three years and the credit unions yeah of course still making payments anyway amen yes i want to thank the lord for thank you can you hear me when i speak without the microphone screeners is it better it's better is it better all that her prayer for my broom and dustpan disappeared that may not sound like a big thing but when you're on a limited income it is and apparently the person who took it god convicted their heart and when my back was turned they returned it it was the only time that the gate was unlocked and so i know who did it so i just really um i thank the lord for that for um making a way for friendship too because i i wanted to um testify to this person and it's hard to do to testify to someone when they feel like they've got something between you and them where they've taken my stuff so god returned it i almost flipped over it lord amen wonderful anybody else amen yes thank the lord for being in my life amen amen amen loving amen the lord are you going to sing this on my face i had a song put in here so we'll go ahead and do the first verse mike has got a song he wants to sing today my mom was gonna request this last week but she didn't think of it until after service uh singing

verses in this amen just to want to get to know him more yes amen praise the lord anyone else before we change the lord's services amen god bless you then let's stand amen we'll go to the word of god praise the lord thank the lord give us blessings to make a way to be able to get to know him at all amen gentile people we're not a people god made us a people amen praise the lord jesus let's turn our bibles to first the first thessalonians chapter four first thessalonians chapter four read the scripture we've read to begin every service for the past three four months amen first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 the rapture message amen so we're going to continue on with the thought of the rapture today part 19. amen this is the rapture part 19. praise the lord first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 before we read could we just bow our heads for another word of prayer amen lord jesus father god we thank you so much again for this opportunity to be in the house of god for you to speak to us from your word once again lord may you take complete control of the remaining part of this service that your holy spirit would have preeminence once again lord through speaker and here alike yes lord what you would have to be accomplished today lord and each one that has come for whatever purpose you drew every one of us here today god and we know that your word cannot return void so we're believing that you're going to accomplish and establish each of us what the purpose of that is today i believe it's to draw strength is to draw powers to draw faith it's to draw comfort lord because paul even said at the end of this that we should comfort one another with these words yes lord it's something i believe that we're facing lord in this hour i believe we're facing coming up it's very imminent lord even 55 60 years ago lord the prophet of god was telling us how close it was even paul back in the day was telling us how close it is how close how much more close is it now lord to your coming we know we won't know the day or the hour that's reserved just for you but i believe that you've whispered enough little sweet nothings into your bride's ear that we have an understanding of the season and we know the time that we live lord and is the time of the coming of the lord we thank you lord for the truths of your word father the the doctrine the revelation of this word that helps encourage us and continue us to press this battle lord to give us that truth lord and where it lies and where it is in our lives and and what we should be looking to and expect for this last day we thank you lord for it we thank you for the message the truth of your word for the revelation of that word lord just speak to our hearts so do it once again we pray lord speak to our hearts show us where we need to be in you where we need to be living where our lives are where we should be god because i believe every one of us here have a desire lord to be pleasing to you say god may you just grant it lord we thank you for those that have come we pray that you bless those who may be streaming and lord everything we don't be pleasing to you now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 but i will not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that is sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words you could be seated amen i don't know about you i hope that uh i just when i started doing that i just felt to read that scripture before every segment of this but uh every time i read this you think you know you think something when you in the natural if you do something over and over again it just becomes common to you it becomes uh something that's just like uh dull and and it just doesn't have the effect as it did but i tell you friend every time i read this it becomes more and more precious to me every time i read it i go through and i stand here and i read it if i read it in my study or something i every time i read this it becomes more more precious to me more more real more powerful it just just does something to my soul every time i read it if this does something to my soul you know you might get sick of uh of seeing me you might get sick of seeing one another you might get sick of the car you drive you might get sick of the meal you eat all the time you might get sick of uh of the things going over and over and over and uh one of the worst sayings i hate it i'll just say that i hate it god said he hated things so he said he hated nicolas i hated to say and god bless my wife because she said a bunch that is the same old same old i hate that i just but but in the world that's a lot of times that's where it comes to it's it's just the same old same old over and over again it just becomes commonplace and boring you know but the word of god just does not not to a child of god it does when the word of god and it speaks to you and that spirit resonates in your heart friends it becomes more and more precious every time you read it and i'm sorry i i don't mean to go on about it but as i was reading and i just got so inspired and enthused reading it again i just had to say something so praise the lord we're uh we've gone through this scripture of course in many facets uh that are pertaining to the rapture we are on part 19 and i figured uh figured it out or factored it it's been like four months uh that we've been on this subject and uh i don't believe there's much more the lord has i feel like it's coming to a close but this scripture here that we finally got to the place that we're majoring on and got to verse 16. we started on verse 16 last week and uh where the bible says the lord himself amen now he's not sending a substitute but the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first so being that this scripture that brother branham broke it down in the rapture message felt inspired to do the same thing for us as as we go through this now of course he went through it in just a few minutes and uh and i i told you last week as we were uh looking into the shout and as the lord was unfolding things and revealing things it could have been another two or three services probably at least and that's just coming from my little p brain and my little image limited understanding i imagine that somebody who really had a a really uh a good revelation or brain or something they could think it through could probably spend weeks on it maybe but uh but we just took one service on the show uh finished it last week i told you there's other things that the lord gave me and there's notes still in my desk i just left that alone well he did the same thing yesterday uh it started during the week but well it started long before that but to to the writing down of notes about the next facet of this so we are talking about now the shout the voice and the trump now those three things is as we know the bible says the lord himself shall shall descend with so we know that the lord does all three while he is descending while he is in his mode of descension coming to the gentile bride to take her home now remember there's songs and there's messages and there's people that for so long talk about when jesus puts his foot on earth again friend jesus is not going to plant a foot on this earth outside of us being his proxy until the millennium amen jesus does not put a foot on this earth again outside of us being his representatives he does not put a foot on this earth again in a corporal body until the millennium we go to meet him in the air but on his dissension now he does these things these three things in that mode of descension the first one was a shout when his distinction was that he sent a message down and he brought a prophet into this last day to bring that message to a people so that that word could be revealed to their heart to prepare them and gather them together now we figured that we found that out last week scripturally that the message was to come because remember this rapture is an international rapture right this rapture isn't just come together our little church or our little city or state or even country this this message come together a bride a gentile last day alive and remain group bride from around the world from all kindred tongues people nation god is gathering his people together so if if being in one nation doesn't gather us together if being of one uh a culture doesn't bring us together if being of one language doesn't bring us together if all if none of these common things that we talk that people have in common that that bring them together remember brother brown talked about denominations and the commonality that denominations have and and basically what that was was just people with common ideas flocking to the same place at the same time which is more no more really than just a lodge it's just a it's just a place where common people with common ideas and thoughts come together and share those ideas together well that that's that's nothing more than a lodge that's nothing more than than than a soup supper or a senior center or something where people just come together like brother pat has a thing on online about cars and all the people that care and and love cars and all come to that group and they share their ideas and their thoughts and that little chat room or whatever it is that they discuss they discuss cars people who don't care anything about cars probably sister pat doesn't have anything to do with that group and doesn't want to don't care anything about it so so what is it it is there's got to be a commonality that brings all the bride from around the world and the alive and remain group to bring her all together so all these other things don't do it what will do it it's got to be the word of god yes the word is common everywhere and the revelation of the spirit of god is common everywhere to every people tongue nation and so this message came to gather those people together in that thought of that word by the revelation of that word to bring her under that one headship that one auspice the word the message christ the word so that shout was to come as we found out was to come to gather the the alive and remain group together so there's that uh that element that that that is to bring her to the place that she's ready when he calls yes when that call happens when that trumpet sounds she's ready to go to meet him the preparation of this wedding garment is what was to do that that was the shout amen now the voice so we established that last week now the voice uh that's the second thing here so the shouts to bring together the alive and remain group and there's to be a voice amen a voice that's to go forth now a voice a person's voice is one of the most distinguishing features that a person has um you've probably set and heard me minister long enough or talk or teach you long enough that if if you were blindfolded and you walked into a strange place with strange people and i started talking you would probably know it's me yes just like i would probably know because i've heard long enough that i would know it's you amen i would know that i could pick up the phone and it'd be a stranger and i wouldn't know that person somebody could call come walk in the door and a stranger i may not know them if i had my back turned i might not recognize i probably wouldn't recognize their voice because they're a stranger to me but my mother could call me and i didn't have to have caller id to know and i heard one millisecond of her voice i knew it was her right i mean why because i've been listening to that voice and she's gone on now but uh before she passed i've been listening that voice for 55 years plus 54 years plus the nine months i was in her so i had been listening to her my entire life so of course i am that close to her our personal relationship is close that when she said something i knew it was her immediately i knew it was her yes most of you if not you i would know right away if you walked in the door and i was blindfolded i would know who it was i could tell you who it was because i know your voice it's one of the most distinguishable distinguishing uh uh factors of of of a person this the significance of your voice it means a lot amen now uh you have distinguishing factors that you can look at a person and tell them or or something like that in fact uh you know what a lot of times when someone sees a crime and they actually you know go to the police and tell them they saw a crime mostly just video it now and anyway so if they actually want to go they well what is the what did the perpetrator look like most of the time they first thing they say is is if they were white or black or hispanic or asian or something like that that's one of the most distinguishing physical features people may call that racist but it's the truth that's just the one of the most distinguishing factors that a human has that to look at amen and you can say well he was about six foot tall it was a guy as a man uh obviously very distinguishing too all the days sometimes you see people you're just not sure but six foot uh had a beard or or a slim build or a heavy builder things like that those are all distinguishing features for the eye but what about to the spirit because we're not talking about something that you can see with your eye because we go to see him now there was a day when jesus came in a corporal body and they could touch him they could see him they could feel him all the distinguishing factors to know this is jesus but there's but there had to be something that spoke to their spirit to tell them who jesus was because that flesh of jesus was simply that without a revelation without something that resonated back to that person that that's who that was then it was just another individual just like most the people in that day they saw jesus they might have ate with them they might have been in church with it but to them is nothing more than just another person so there had to be something distinguishable that voice is something that speaks it's distinguishable amen and it's the one of the most distinguishing characteristics that a person has amen it it's distinguishable now let's go to uh uh i'm gonna change things up a little bit from where i was going to but let's go to saint john chapter 11 or chapter 10 excuse me chapter 10. we'll come back to that first thessalonians in a minute but just to follow up with uh this thought on the voice and like i said the saints i left uh i left pages of notes that i'm not even going to get into today uh about the voice the voice of god my boy sits in the bride today uh but saint john chapter 10 verse 27 uh let's start with verse 25. jesus answered them i told you and you believe not the words that i do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as i said unto you my sheep hear my voice amen my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me so those that know the voice of god are those that belong to him those that are his sheep those that are his disciples those that belong to him those that are attributed as a seed from before the foundation of the world he knew them then he knows them now amen and they recognize his voice right so when he speaks not william branham when he speaks now he spoke through william brown but when he speaks it resonates to your heart to your life and you know that it's him speaking right because it's of his authority not of not brother adam's not mine not anybody else's it's of his authority that he speaks and we know that voice now how do we know that voice the same way we know all the other voices that we know i spent time with him i've listened to his voice i've spoke to him he knows me he loves me i love him we have a relationship and in that relationship there's conversation in any good relationship in any relationship at all there's conversation when you have conversation with god you speak he hears he speaks back you know his voice because his voice doesn't necessarily although it can speak to your ears but his voice speaks to your heart yes and when his voice speaks in the spirit to your heart then it's something that that speaks to you and resonates in your life to know who it is it's not a distinguishing see i went through all that to see it's not a distinguishing characteristic of something that we see takes phil smeller here it's a distinguishing characteristic of what speaks to your heart it speaks inside you so that it stirs you that you know that it's him it's not just a man and when you put on that tape you know that is it's not a man it's god speaking to you right when god ministers from this word when god speaks to you through the word you know it's him because it's his voice speaking right it's not a person then when you speak preach uh uh bring the word it's it's it's god it's his voice speaking and we know his voice and he said my sheep hear my voice my she now you see the rest of the world those that are not his sheep they don't know him they don't know his voice you can read through the bible and this is some of the notes i left on my desk or in my desk but you can read all through the scripture where uh god would speak and others didn't hear anything but a trumpet right or a thunder or a noise usually a thunder brother says the voice of god is the thunder amen like revelation 10 when the thunder's when he's when he screamed with a loud voice it speeds of thunder and that's a whole nother that's a whole nother service but other people around just like when when jesus spoke to paul to saul which became paul up to him others around him they heard a voice but they didn't know what what was going on or who it was or what was being said only paul did because paul was the one that could hear his voice amen because it spoke spoke to his to his soul not to his ears the others around that's all they heard people around so many places when god talks all they heard was a thunder all they heard was a trumpet or so or a noise or a clasp or something that's all they heard that's all through the bible his sheep hear his voice and they know that voice that voice speaks to them and it's distinguishable amen now it's distinguishable outside of the distinguishable that we know one another because he speaks into amen doesn't go through the ears goes into the heart so when he speaks we know him amen and i know them and they follow me we follow him because it's his voice speaking and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man look at this i love this any man neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand amen praise the lord you belong to god your family belongs to god there is no one that can pluck him out of the hand of god there is no way they can be lost because they belong to him people get so worried all the time and fretting about this and that one and i understand the prayers for our loved ones friend i pray for them too i bring them before the lord expect god to convert them and bring them along and the sooner the better but if they're in god's hands he cannot lose one not one yes praise the lord my father who which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my hand i and my father are one praise the lord so that voice that speaks you recognize it well now let me ask you this question as we transition into the next part of this if we do what if what if you now recognize god's voice when god speaks to you do you recognize god's voice when he speaks to you do you know what's god speaking to you do you recognize that yes when you recognize that it's god speaking to you then then it transcends any and everybody else that might speak it takes precedence and more importance over anything anybody else might say it's the voice of god so if you recognize you acknowledged here today that you recognize the voice of god when it speaks to you do you not think that you would recognize that that voice cried out even if you've been in the grave or even if you you're not in the grave but even if you've fallen asleep or even if you're in that amen do you not think that you would still recognize god god doesn't lose you when you pass away actually it becomes closer greater more in the spirit realm right then in the flesh the flesh is what separated from the most now very much but don't you think you would if we know it now of course we would know it then when that voice cries out we would know that voice not surely they know that voice they did we talked about the in matthew chapter 27 when we talked about matthew 27 when he when he cried with that loud voice and the dead in christ rose and appeared unto many when he cried with a loud voice and those people from the graves arose won't you think the same thing would happen with the same people with his voice spoke again in this last day yes well that's the scripture the dead in christ shall rise amen saint john chapter 11 just a page over so saints we know his voice we know his voice listen that is very important for you to settle in your spirit your soul right now we know his voice if you don't know his voice if you're listening if you're watching if you don't know his voice saints repent and get to the place that your life is hitting christ and you come to the relationship with him that you know it's him when he's speaking i'm afraid and i use that word probably in the wrong context that a lot of people dares i say most people say they pray but they have a one-sided conversation right they're just talking there's no response there's no listening there's no conversation back well that's not a relationship if the conversation is not a two-way street then it's not a relationship it's not even a conversation that's why i tell you about our client the other day friday uh even when i had a second or two to say something he was already what he wasn't listening he was already in his mind he already knew what he was going to say next wasn't even concerned about it and a lot of people are the same way god i need this god give me that god i gotta have this god help oh and maybe help this person this person if you can't that's not a relationship that's not a conversation right there's no voice going on there that's just you talking but when there's a voice when there's when there's a conversation when there's a relationship now look there was a man one time that had a very dear relationship with jesus in the flesh when christ was here name was lazarus story john chapter 11 that's what i want to get to but but but understand we know his voice if you don't know it friend now is the time to get to knowing it am i amen now's the time or or he will cry out and you will miss it all together yes amen now saint john chapter 11 uh we'll begin with verse 39. uh 38 we'll just do verse 38. saint john chapter 11 verse 38 jesus therefore again groaning in himself coming to the grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon him jesus said take ye away the stones martha the sister of him that was uh the sister of him that was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh he'd been dead four days after three days after 72 hours corruption sets in amen and she knows that and he knew that after in the fourth day he's thinking he's rotting faith's falling in he's he's as as you would think in the automobile industry he's beyond repair or or any mechanical device it's beyond repair it can't be fixed and that's what her implication here was he stinketh lord he's beyond repair you can't raise him now he's already face has fallen in skin worms has eaten on him he's he's beyond repair he's done it's been four days but jesus said unto her said i not unto thee that if thou wouldst believe thou should have see the glory of god amen there you go so what does it take to see the glory of god faith yes it takes faith to see the glory of god you want to see the glory of god today you must have faith in him yes he said if you would just believe have faith you would see the glory of god amen then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid jesus lifted up his eyes and said father amen i thank thee that thou has heard me and i knew that thou hurdest me always but because of the people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou has sent me and when he had thus uh when when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth amen and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot the grave closed his face was bound about with a napkin jesus said unto them loose him and let him go praise the lord loose him what came forth jesus cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth and that voice brought the dead back to life again amen amen that voice brought the dead back to life the same voice first thessalonians 4 16 that voice that cries out that will resurrect the dead one day now brother adam said i believe if jesus said stood there don't matter where he was even though he was in front of the grave if he had stood there if you'd been on the mount of olives god wherever he had been if jesus had stood there and said come forth every grave that every body in the ground would have opened right then and there amen but he said lazarus come forth so it was so there was a significance to the voice that was sounding those voices all through the bible and we've talked about those voices and the voices of our nominal uh life our natural life we talked about all those voices there are all kind of voices scriptural voices but there was significance to this voice amen to this voice now this resurrection of the dead says that he spoke with a loud voice and as i dramatized and as we many times or oftentimes think in our minds when god's when the bible says he spoke with a loud voice we think that god yelled it now that may have very well been true brother branham dramatized it the same way but if you go look in the greek you'll see that that word loud means just as much great voice as it does loud voice so my point here in saying this is it wasn't necessarily the voice itself or the volume of the voice as much as it was the significance and the power and authority that was behind that voice amen the loud voice means great it means uh imminent for ability virtue authority and power that's the same verb it's the same definition of the word loud loud voice great voice there was authority behind the voice there was significance to that voice the purpose of that voice and what he did there and calling out lazarus was for that one singular human male to come forth from the dead and when that voice screamed out lazarus came forth now the bible says he came forth now it also said esteemed the void the loud is esteemed highly for the importance of a great moment or a great weight importance so it isn't just necessarily the volume as as much as it is the importance the significance the greatness the power and authority behind it amen amen the authority that jesus carried when he cried with that authoritative voice lazarus came from the dead right after state king been dead for four days now think about that now this is before the resurrection of the old testament saints yes so this is a this is a resurrection of a person scripturally unprecedented until this time where this man came forth after being in a grave after corruption had set in after after 72 hours four days now that corruption that just proves scripturally that it doesn't matter how far you've gone it doesn't matter how dead you are yes doesn't matter how long you've been dead it doesn't matter how long the body's been in a grave when that voice cries out the significance of that voice of first thessalonians 4 16 is going to raise every dead person out of the grave that died in christ those who died in christ from the first church age we've explained from the first church age to this time they're all going to resurrect at that voice amen right amen the significance of that voice the authority behind that voice that loud voice that authoritative voice is going to cry out and it doesn't matter where they are it doesn't matter friend listen to me you and you could scatter their ashes from here to china yes but when that voice cries out every molecule of that being is going to come together again in a glorified state and resurrect a new life yes man this body i know it's a nasty past house now friend but it won't be then right right and it don't matter how rotten they are it don't matter how stinking they are it don't matter if they ain't nothing but a bunch of bones or dust laying in that casket or if their ashes are spread across the pacific ocean yes god when that voice comes forth is going to bring every molecule of it back together again amen resurrection yes the time of the resurrection where that voice brings them all together amen now lazarus came forth bible says here he came forth and as he come out of the grave the cave as he come out he was bound hand and foot well how do you think he got out of there then doesn't say anybody went in there and got him it doesn't say that that they had a rope and pulled him out it says he came forth bound hand and foot you ever tried to walk with your feet bound it's kind of tough i don't think i don't think it happened that way at all saints right you don't know my opinion now this isn't scriptural because this is my opinion i think lazarus came forth at that voice and he just levitated right across to jesus he had no way to walk right he was bound head and foot with great clothes he was like this friend found head and foot how was he supposed to walk out like that nobody came and got him how was he supposed to get out there hop like a bunny i didn't no i think that when that voice cried out that man came right out to jesus he came right out there and stood and then and sat right there jesus said listen let him go amen loose him and let him go now they the practical application was they took all the great clothes off of him actually was he loosed from what was he actually loosed from the grip of death amen he was loosed from the grip of death right yeah he had great clothes all around him yeah practically they took all those great clothes off but what was he loose from what was he saying to let him go from death the curse of death the curse of death had no more hold on praise the lord because god had raised him from the dead yes amen amen now that curse wasn't completely broke until jesus himself did it the perfect sacrifice the perfect sacrificial lamb when he resurrected from the dead and destroyed death that destroyed it for good but this was just a sample this is just a this is just a little taste of what jesus is about to do and him himself with his voice that significant voice raising that man from the dead yes well if it rose if it rose them from the dead there if we cried the loud voice of the at his crucifixion and those that were in the graves arose then how would we thinking that the dead in christ that shall rise first even though we have the shout here the shout goes forth but in the but in the process of this rapture the dead actually raised first and are here with us again for a minimum of 30 days and then they're here and they present themselves and we see those uh those ones lost ones of those loved ones those who've gone on before and we're here together gathered shout voice voice of the resurrection that resurrects now i've heard people say and i don't dispute this and i'm not saying they're wrong and i'm not saying i'm right but i was thinking about this because i heard somebody one time say that it would be the voice of the bride that was resurrect the dead and i thought why that that that has merit i i i could see that you know brother graham said the voices in the bride but then i started looking and and and thinking about this and praying about it meditating on it however you want to say we all do it different ways i guess but my connection with the lord and him speaking to me is maybe different than yours but the important part is we speak to him and he speaks to us so when he spoke and reminded me of that of that quote that brother branham said the bride would have would be the final voice to the final age amen he did not say that she would be the voice to all the other ages he did not say that her voice would be the voice for all those that have gone beyond he said she would be the final voice to the final age based on that i disagree with that being the voice of the bride to do that now may be true i don't know if the lord chose me for the light i'll let you know if he showed you something but all i can see in the scripture it it it's not that way now does the bride speak with the authority of god behind her yes brother brown said she'll have thus saith the lord or she'll keep quiet right so she's got thus saith the lord she speaks as god would speak absolutely but in what capacity because remember the significance of the voice is just as important as the voice what was the voice for now let's go before i get ahead of myself let's go to first corinthians i'm going to close uh here shortly but first corinthians amen first corinthians chapter 14 verse chapter 14 verse 6. first corinthians 14 6. now paul is going to be on the gifts of the spirit now and of course this is expressively talking about gifts of the spirit and speaking in tongues which obviously is a gift of the spirit i don't know very many people that have it i have in the past i know people that probably still have it and just haven't done it in a long time because it still exists yes amen god didn't leave and brother branham and take all the gifts with him right amen the gifts of the spirit are still here including speaking in tongues it's still a good lesson for us today that is what paul is speaking of in the sixth verse he said now if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine in other words if i don't say something to you that you will understand if i don't say something to you in your vernacular in your language if i don't say something to you that you can comprehend what's the point in saying it right there's no communication there look communication is a two-way street communication people think communication like i spoke wednesday commute a lot of people think communication is just you talking that's not communication communication is a two-way street amen that's how you commune with each other you talk they talk you talk they talk it's a conversation it's the same thing here that's the only way that that that you can actually have relationship is it's you have fellowship you talk you talk to each other and if and if there's no discussion if i just if i just talk to you just blabbering you're not gonna understand what i have to say even though i might have something on my heart to say that means something and it's significant but if i just go but i'll be able to have you have to be able to help you again you're not gonna know what i'm talking about even if it's genuine tongues right you're not gonna know what i'm talking about of course unless the lord gives you the interpretation or somebody says the interpretation but paul's talking about someone coming forth and just speaking in tongues and how is that edifying anybody now you say oh you can feel the spirit that's true and i enjoy that that that's wonderful any time i've heard anybody speak in genuine tongues or prophesy or something i feel a powerful anointing amen if it's genuine i've been involved so but if it's genuine i feel the power of god moving strong see and i feel that and that's good but what is the edification of the message they're giving if it's not given to you where you can understand it and that's his whole point amen the point is is is being able to bring you something that that you can comprehend that you can uh that you can understand that you can hear and listen now seventh verse and even things without life-giving sound either pipe or heart except they give it a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is pike their heart it's just like zach playing the guitar mic playing the piano micah could go over here and play on the piano be beautiful and you're like what is that but if he goes and plays beautifully on the piano a song that you know you're like oh yeah and you start singing with it and you feel the spirit move and the and the power of that message in that song because it came with words but even if it's not without life it's just uh it's just a musical instrument or something like the trumpet when it sounded it has to have a significance if he just plays on it it might sound nice but you don't know michael what song is that i just made it up or it's this song or something you've never heard amen but if you play something beautifully that you know then it speaks to you it it witnesses your spirit you might even again start singing the song with him because you know that it has a significance understand that's the point of this a significance eighth verse for if the trumpet old testament now if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle of course you know back in the old testament the the trumpeters would shout out a specific command of what's going on if they see an enemy or somebody approaching or which direction they're coming from or how many there are something there has to be a significance to the trumpet as it played out the person had to understand what was being trumpeted sir like morse code if you will even if now it wasn't morse code of course but something to that ideal if if you got a dot dash dash dot dash dot or something morse code well if the trumpet sounded out in a specific order to say hey they're coming from the south it's so and so there's so many of them or whatever you know how to prepare yourself for the battle you know how to get ready for what's about to happen but if the trumpet just blasts out something you don't know or something you don't understand you sit there and say well i heard the trumpet but what's going on are they coming from the north south east west uh who is it are there is not mistaken and now you got a bunch of confusion trump it was for if it was for anything or what the significance of it was see they blasted it in a specific order or a specific way so that those that are in the congregation would know what is meant that's why that's why he's telling this story that's why paul's telling this story that's why i'm telling this story there's all kinds of voices there's all kinds of people that use voices there are all kinds of voices that have significance in the bible but there's a significant special voice let's say special with power authority like what raised lazarus from the dead that is going to that is going to sound out to raise the dead that have gone on in these church ages that it's going to resurrect them there was something that had to gather together the alive and remain group to bring her under that one umbrella to bring her one under that one auspice together the bride might not know who they are where they are can't speak the language whatever but we're we're knit together by that one commonality well the the dead in christ have to have the same thing now they're dead in christ so they died with that commonality if they didn't die with that commonality of christ then they're not coming up anyway so they died with that commonality they had all that in common when they passed so when that voice cries that voice isn't just for a lazarus it's not just for a william brown it's not just for a martin luther it is not just for my mom or dad that voice when it cries is going to resurrect the entirety of the dead that died in christ ahead of us that's why they rise first and we're all here together at one time praise the lord so his dissension is with that shout for the alive and remain that voice for those that have gone ahead to gather them together to to ready themselves to be prepared when that trumpet sounds to take them home amen the shout the voice the trump each one each one has its own significance amen i'm going to read a couple of the scriptures in saint john chapter 6 saint john chapter 6 verse 35. jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believe on me shall never thirst but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not they're not of his sheep all that the father giveth me shall come to me amen can't him out of his hand praise the lord they'll all come may somebody come and serve him for years some may come and serve him for a minute but all that are his are going to come right all the father has given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out for i come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the father's will which has sent me that all those of all which he had given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day amen amen he gonna raise them all up at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which sees the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day amen praise the lord everyone that has gone on don't don't care where their body is don't care if they were cremated don't care if they were buried people that would absolutely put you out of the economy of god if you have somebody you know cremated and that's a sad state in my opinion friend amen it's a tradition but it doesn't matter you can take them and you can you can you can take a plane ride around the world and you can scatter a little ash everywhere you go and that thing and every bit of it will come right back together so it don't matter yeah amen it doesn't matter god is more than able so many times we get it in our minds these things oh you know but god's god can do anything for him we know god can do anything he will raise him up at the last day saint john chapter 5. 24 page over saint john 25 or 5 24. verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me have everlasting life and shall not come into the condemnation but is passed from death unto life so friend if you ever feel condemned it's not god doing it if you're his you cannot be or come into condemnation satan will condemn you now the holy spirit might convict you right for doing something wrong to turn you around to do something right but he's never going to condemn you god is not in the business to try to make you his children feel like you are less than what you are in him and that's what condemnation does condemnation brings you down condemnation makes you feel low not humble though but less than what you really are right cannot come and accommodate condemnation but is passed from death unto life praise the lord verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live amen they will come forth the dead in christ shall rise first amen for as the father hath life in himself so has he given to the son to have life in himself and has given himself authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man marvel not at this for the hour is coming which and i there's there's we say the hours here amen and not today necessary i don't mean today but it's upon us amen for the hour is coming into which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation and what is the resurrection of evil what are those that have done that have uh done the evil unto the resurrection of damnation what is it to be evil people say oh no murderers and and people who uh corrals around and all the gamblers down at the gambling every one of the gambling places going to hell and all the prostitutes and all the that's that's not evil those are the re those are the results of unbelief amen but evil is just not believing to be evil is not to believe on him whom he has sent that's evil and that's exactly what the devil is trying to get each and every human to do is to not believe it no matter what you say no matter what comes across your lips do you believe or not because your actions will determine whether you do or don't your life will determine whether you believe it or not it's that simple you don't have to say a word but what you do will dictate what you actually are what you actually believe amen evil is not to believe don't believe then you'll come up in the second resurrection unto the white throne judgment right my mind the rapture let me read this i'm closing the rapture message therefore the message called the message again the shout calls the bride together see the shout the same one with a loud voice screamed out that shower a voice screamed out with a voice that woke lazarus with a loud voice she cried lazarus come forth or a significant great authoritative voice not necessarily the volume but the significance the authority behind the voice it wakes up the sleeping bride the sleeping dead and they come forth amen for the dead in christ shall rise forth for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout the voice of the archangel the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first oh my praise the lord let's stand if we could amen praise the lord i'm glad the lord has already prepared it's like that three-step process of becoming saved amen repent and if there's no remember that's that three stage the people always major on that the tip of the pyramid friend but if you don't have the foundation you'll never get to the tip of the pyramid right you'll never get to love them unless you've got faith and people always major on that end result they always forget a lot of times they do the same thing with with being born again they'd do the same thing there if you don't have repentance i don't care anytime you go to a water get baptized or whatever you're not going to get it right there's got to be repentance true sincere repentance amen yes if you repent then baptize the name of the lord jesus christ you shall receive the holy ghost yes that's the promise but the repentance has got to be done first before the salvation before there is the holy spirit that comes not just on you not just feel a nice tingle but the holy spirit that will come and live in you that spirit that will take a body in your life amen praise the lord that's where it makes a difference well that shout it's the same thing got to be the shout first before you have the voice yes for those who come together amen so we all go to meet the lord amen first he was here in a corporal body and he was here with him and they race and he took them with him right this time we go to meet him yes amen we go to meet him thank you lord say we go to meet him in the air it's just a matter of us getting a little closer to them and him getting a little closer to us that's all it is people look at going past the moon the stars the stratospheres into another galaxy or something i'm gonna fly through here and you know all the songs we still sing them and all those gospel songs were back but you know it's really not that complicated amen it's really you don't need a space suit it's really not it's you know like brother graham said back when they started shooting rockets up the air people felt god just lived right up there and they thought oh if they'd shoot a rock up there they'll just rock it they'll just see god up there oh this is just floating around hey how y'all doing go to your grandpa there how y'all doing yeah i love y'all doing just wonderful that's not the way god is he's not floating up there somewhere and then that came back atheists well there is no god we were up there and didn't see one i didn't mean you don't need to leave earth to see god right here yes amen it's just it's just that song that we sing sometimes they we and they slow down it's just it's just a little change that's all it is amen it's not so complicated amen but we're going home going home time praise the lord jesus amen so thankful that we have that promise that god give us amen thank you lord amen anybody got a song on your heart most of the time the lord gives me something i don't have anything here amen amen let's just sing this little course 272. amen let's just sing the chorus part of it know the words the verses let's just sing the chorus part here fill my cup floors amen 272. feel my lift [Music] is [Music] fill it up and make me holy [Music] come and watch this [Music] is [Music] i lift it up lord thirsting of my soul amen o bread of heaven feed me till i [Music] hallelujah is your soul thirsting today your soul hungered and thirsting for the righteousness of jesus christ and all of his glory amen you know he said he would fill those that are thirsting amen he would come and quench that thirst but there's got to be a thirst there first amen cannot want more of god amen he's not going to bother but if you want more of god there is more of god for you yes amen praise the lord jesus amen god bless you today pray something was said to bless and strengthen some way today amen thank you for coming thank you if you may have been streaming you're still with us amen appreciate the lord's goodness amen now remember wednesday night i have church here seven o'clock but the subsequent two wednesdays we will not be having service so let me get my calendar that might help me a little bit um so this wednesday the 10th we will have church this coming wednesday the 10th which is this is the 17th and 24th we will not be having service here okay the lord willing brother rogers going out of town so i'm going to do some work in here and i'm going to uh do all the drywall repair and stuff we need to do so then the following week which should be the 16th 17th 18th we're gonna we're gonna try to paint uh i'd like to try to get it done on tuesday maybe wednesday but even if we get it done even if we get the painting done on tuesday you're not so i just thought it'd be easier to just cancel that wednesday night service since we're gonna try to paint uh and the paint fumes and everything and hopefully we'll have it good enough for the following sunday and then of course the next wednesday night is the wednesday night before thanksgiving so there will be no service here on uh on that wednesday night either so the 17th 24th so after this wednesday night the 10th there will be no more wednesday night services until december 1st amen so remember that um also have and there's not as many hardly as many here there was wednesday night but if you're watching streaming uh uh i'd like to try to have a dinner uh or something like that for us a fellowship luncheon together uh i mentioned it for sunday i talked to the landlord craig and uh about getting us one of these facilities places that we could have a meal in and he said sure he could do that and so i had to talk to myself i'm gonna charge you anything but whatever it is i'll pay for it but well have a be nicely cleaned this mess out next door we could just go right next door because it's big enough in there to have something so we'll have something wherever it is he'll supply us a facility to be able to have that and um so i would like to do it uh between thanksgiving and christmas so i forgot what i said we could do a saturday depending on what people would like to do but i thought um maybe like the uh the fourth or fifth the 11th or 12th which is saturday sunday saturday sunday so maybe one of those two weeks after that christmas starts selling in people get busy and things like that so maybe one of those two weekends if you'd like a saturday that's fine i'm planning on buying a refrigerator putting it over here so uh if we have cold stuff or something it can sit in there if we have drinks it could set in there uh obviously if you have stuff that needs to stay warm or crock pot or something like that we can plug them in uh just like we did at the other place so if you if that sounds like something i would like that um i always think it's a real blessing when we're able to do that and have something like that uh i'd prefer on sunday afternoon after service but if others would prefer a saturday we could do that too what you think i'll get some more details later and i'll let you know what we come up with for a facility and things like that and try to nail down a specific day time of course if it's on sunday it'll just be after church um so and if you have any other comments or ideas just let me know i appreciate that amen so remember the prayer request and things we had and those requests that came forth amen so i believe that's all the announcements i had to make so god bless you appreciate each of you again amen and pray the lord bless your week and be with you keep you amen praise the lord anybody else have anything real quick amen thank you for coming love each one of you appreciate you brother pat would you just miss us thank you lord for being here with us today thank you for the revelations that you give and we love you lord we know that that it's you who who convicts us is with

studying your word in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen praise the lord [Music] you
