our family to recover requests they'd like to make this wednesday i'll be attending my stepson's wedding i pray to the lord we use my wife myself to be a testimony and i'll be honest with you it makes me nervous they're a bunch of unbeliever it's going to be a time a party and i just want to let his light shine throughout amen traveling mercies yes we sure will and uh anyone else this morning oh no i forgot to write it down but remember the afghan people okay and especially the christians in afghanistan right now suffering serious yes that's that's your persecution i definitely want to remember them in prayer it's a horrible time i couldn't even imagine going through it here in america you know with all the securities we've had you know for all of our lives but uh pray that the lord move on that situation amen all right let's just take these needs to lord if you have unspoken prayer requests just lift up your hand and you know show your heart to the lord this morning brother dennis would you mind just praying over these knees this morning please lord jesus we borrow our hearts and heads in unison in the faith of our lord and savior jesus christ knowing without you we are nothing without you we'll surely fail and father i can stand like paul said one time i can do all things through christ which strengthens me and we are needy people father with with ourselves we try to do the best and we fall million miles short of what we can accomplish but father in your name in the name of jesus christ there's victory there's healing amen there's deliverance there's comfort there's strength and father whatever we have need of we know we can draw from those living waters we can just dip our cups of faith and drink to our overflowing uh a portion father and there are some that are sick that need a touch from you this covetous scaring the world scaring our nation but in the name of jesus your christ stands faithful standing under your word we're not scared father but we believe that if whoever needs high healing touch you'll come under the seat and deliver him and touch him for nowhere to hide from amen that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and by your stripes we are healed it's a finished work that you accomplished for us at calvary and we believe no matter what type of disease is your prophet was told that not even cancer will stand before his prayer and we are your bride today not even cancer covet or whatever it may be will stand before us for when satan comes in like a flood you'll raise the standard father we are victorious because we believe in you and lord amen may you help us to recognize it's your life living in us against us of victory help us it's already been said to get ourselves out of the way they were too much in the way and father help us as paul said i die daily yes and brother brown said then the greatest gift you gave him was getting himself out of the way and lord may you start every day even this time of worship get us out of the way that we may receive your word this morning father when we know that the enemies is fighting harder than ever before but we know the flashing red lights are our flashing father and we know the train is in the station and your bride is going home soon oh father bless each and every one that's here bless the ones that raise their hands you know their hearts you know what they

oh you are [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] foreign one more time change my heart [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the lord i believe that's all of our desires today amen to be like him to live our lives for him for every moment he gives us do what we can for the glory of the lord i believe that's why he give us life that's why he put us here that's our purpose we stand here today and every day that we walk through life is to delivered for him i mean you know i i basically attended three funerals this week someone in san diego uh appreciate each one of you the those that our local church let me go last weekend to be with the precious friends in san diego brother david zavala lost a very dear friend of his brother frank lucero and he was a good friend of mine too i didn't know him as well as many there but um i believed it was of the lord to go and be there with them and i believe the lord really moved in a special way there he was 81 he would have turned 82 this past friday and it was a good memorial service and internment and it was really a blessing to be able to meet his family and then come back so it was there monday and tuesday drove back wednesday and um went to a funeral thursday and friday here at east lawn some of you you probably most of you know brother martin and brother emanuel rojas passed away as well uh over the past month month and a half so we had their funerals so i guess that was really two funerals in one that they had for the two of them and uh and it just reminded me of how futile life really is and how we're not promised tomorrow but how every day that we live we should take it to live for the lord jesus you know we're all ready to go home i believe we're all looking for that time that god takes us home and the rapture but but i want to live for him every moment he gives me amen every second of every day if i can do it if i can do something for him drive across the country or be someplace for somebody and that's what i want to do and i brought back uh some of these uh the pamphlets that were there brother frank brother martin brother manuel uh if anybody wants to see him i only got a couple of each so if anybody wants to see him you're welcome too i know i don't know how well some of you knew them probably not brother frank at all but you're welcome to them if you'd like to but i'm honored to introduce a precious friend of mine i call him a friend i don't really know him very well um but uh we first got acquainted with each other at uh the ministers meeting that they started up in phoenix and um and i saw him but i don't think we actually were introduced at that at that uh meeting and then the last meeting that we had uh brother daniel came and sat down and he was sitting over there and i looked and looked around see who was there and i looked over and my eyes caught him he was kind of in front of me and the lord said have him come preach for you and i'm thinking lord i hardly know this brother i don't know what he believes what he teaches what his doctrine is or whatever and but but the lord said have him preach for you and so i said okay i try to be obedient best i can um even even in my reluctance and as it turned out uh a brother was supposed to speak at that meeting who did not show up so brother daniel took his place and when brother daniel spoke i heard him and i said okay i don't mind you i know why that the lord had put him on my heart so i went up to him at our lunch break and told him as much and we've been a little bit in contact since then i was hoping it wouldn't take this long but we were in a hotel room at that time our hotel conference room and we didn't have this facility and uh it just so happened right at that time the lord worked this out it was almost a whirlwind when we come into the place the lord gave us here and we've got some more work to do in the facility but the lord's blessed it and we're thankful to be here and it just seemed like the perfect timing and i appreciate that our brother has had the willingness and the desire to come and minister the gospel to us today and i appreciate that appreciate all your visitors come it's so good to see cara and be here today god bless you and appreciate your sister marylee god bless you and uh brother jeremy your family and and everybody that's come and uh so appreciate you being here today we have a few missing shared the prayer requests uh which actually might not be a horrible thing we probably need to get some more chairs in this case but they would have took up seven or eight chairs of the frau family seven or eight of them and they've had little symptoms this week not not covered because like you heard on the request they tested negative for covet but had some flu-like symptoms just figured it's probably the flu or something so i told him i said well if sunday morning you have some symptoms just you know don't come and say i know it's not covered but but you know i don't want flu either you know i don't want to be sick at all i've got work to do and things so i said you'd just be better to stay at home and uh so they're streaming uh they stream you got that there's other streaming so welcome to the service if you're streaming uh sister karen probably usually streams up in the white mountains and the pads so welcome to this service today you know we just take advantage of what the lord's given us uh and the opportunity that we have today you know i've heard so much and i'll say this it's just been burned on my heart but i want brother daniel to come and pour out his heart to us because he's got something to say the lord's going to use our brother today so i'm looking forward to that but i've heard so much lately especially not at brother frank's funeral so much because he was 81 but uh so much of the taken before their time and uh i i hear that so much nowadays with koba taken before their time i even consider brother rod was taken before his time um precious brother but you know brother david zavala ministered brother frank's funeral and he actually eulogized him as much as he preached the funeral but uh he said something really struck my heart made me realize more than anything especially with all the fear that's gripped the world with this covet thing now um god has a purpose and a time for all of us if you're a child of god right you'll never convince me that all of these people that are passing now are the different ones and some not by covet several not by covet actually uh that that the devil was able to take them people before their time but there's different reasons for different things and i i come to the realization see i i prayed uh i know i'm sorry i'm elongating this but i prayed for many months maybe years about brother green had cancer and i talked to the lord several many many times and i said lord i said i i can understand a a man fulfilling his purpose and his duty and it's time for you to take him home and i'm sorry it's still tough for me but um and i said i understand that please don't take him by cancer and it was just my personal thing uh don't know but i gotta i got a revelation this weekend really doesn't matter coven cancer heart attack stroke my mother passed away last march stroke it doesn't matter it's just it's just simply a vehicle that the lord has used to take us home right yeah our heart stops or whatever it is it's just it's just the lord's will amen and i and i believe that i believe that god's children is his hands just like job he has every one of us hedged and there's no way the devil can even touch you unless god allows it for some reason and if he does there's a reason and we accept and trust him that in his perfection that it's all going to work out perfect amen so with this happening and things that's going on i'm just thankful that the lord's blessed us and he's given us this opportunity this service to this day and uh i welcome you in the name of the lord jesus so appreciate you coming today and we're going to have brother daniel if you would come now give us what's on his heart he said he's nervous pray for my nervousness i told him i said i've been doing this for 33 the lord actually august of 1988 is when i started ministering over 33 years now and every time i get nervous i pastored three churches been many churches around the country preached the thousands canada mexico i even ministered i even pastored this church for three to four years led every song service preach went midweek and sundays by myself and you still get nervous and then brother john gets up who's saying how many songs led how many song services and he says i'm nervous so easy on us just take another day i believe the lord is here to bless you thank you so amen we're thankful brother daniel's here thank you god bless you god bless you all brother i appreciate that song beautiful i think brother mccues used to sing that song right sister mary yeah but uh brought back his memories it's beautiful and uh bennett said uh he doesn't know me very well so he's a little bit maybe worried about what i was going to say but brother as you were singing that song it was it really touched my heart and uh brother brother bennett you know as her brother said i'd rather have jesus i may not have a lot of charisma right i may not be a deep theologian but if i'm here i believe you're going to get jesus amen that's the most important that matters brother uh newton and i met at a minister's meeting and um so they they asked me to come up to preach it and i don't have a lot of experience in in in that type of thing and uh caleb duran he was he was sitting in the front row right here and about halfway through my sermon um but caleb he starts putting his arm up like that and and doing this and stretching like that and i looked at him and and he uh he kept doing it for a while and i thought well i may have a cramp or something you know so then so then i continued on with my sermon and he just stopped and um so then i i finished out and then at lunch when we were in lunch i heard one of the people that said yeah when brother caleb raises his hand that means you're over your time so i'm about halfway done i won't be raising money well uh gracie you raise your hand okay that clock is really small in the back right there on purpose but i do i appreciate being here i appreciate the invitation i am i was in the east african country of malawi one time and uh it was it was a congregation maybe about twice the size the building was about about this size and we were way back we we drove three hours in a vehicle through this jeep trail and we got to the top of this mountain in the middle of east africa no lights no electricity no anything and and we got in there and it was nice there's no microphones like like there aren't here and wasn't needed yeah and when i got up to speak the strangest thing happened about 20 iphones or phones went up to video that's a strange thing so i i was thinking about the the ephesian church and it was a church probably about this size and the prophet told us that it was the most advanced church in the entire bible right so they uh they didn't have a lot of people but it was a special church of god amen and uh maybe if the lord is willing that he will give us that advancement here this morning yes sir amen i wanted to talk a little bit about the images that the enemy sets before excuse me and how common these images are to us amen uh as as brother bennett knows i worked for voice of god recordings for a long time and my job there was one of my jobs was when someone would call the office or something would come in or someone would write in and they would want to talk to a minister they would usually get me and handled many different questions many many different situations and one time i got a phone call from a catholic priest and he had some questions about brother brown's ministry and he was asking about uh how he was with the tongues and the different gifts in the church and then after a while he said i want to share a testimony with you he said he says i was the priest of a large parish i believe it was in either philadelphia or new york and he said i got a hold of brother branham's message and he said i started listening to it and he said this really lined up with the bible and that message started coming out in his ministry and one day he's preaching and a lady stands up in church and speaks in tongues this is a catholic church we have mary and you know we have peter over here and all the gold and all the strangeness associated with that and here a lady stands up and starts speaking in tongues she finishes and she gives the interpretation and he points at her and he says that is according to the book of acts amen and he opens up the word and he starts preaching this in his parish amen amen well there were many in there that i'm sure says that this doesn't line up with the way that we have been taught right this doesn't line up with the way i was born i was born into this church so what this priest is saying and what this lady and the gifts that are starting to manifest themselves they don't line up with the way that i believe yeah right so i'm sure that there was some tattling going on to maybe the higher-ups yeah right well they kicked him out the powers that were kicked him out and he told me he said brother he said he said i loved being a priest he said i love the people he said they were my life he said he says and now they kick me out and i don't have anything because because my message didn't match their narrative right and and today that's what i want to talk about is we have to be careful yes of that we do there was a couple weeks ago i was in flagstaff and i had some meetings for work up there and i walked in to the the place where you eat breakfast in the morning hotel and there was a little mexican lady there and i started talking to her struck up a conversation and she uh i asked her i said i said are you a christian and she was adamant she says no she's i'm catholic and i didn't understand the answer and i said uh i said well now sister i said but are you a christian and she was adamant she said no i am not i'm a catholic she wanted to be separate she wanted that separation and i said i said well do you believe in jesus she says yeah i said well what makes you different why are you not a christian she says well we worship mary oh no and i thought this is really odd so i sat down and uh one of the people i work with he's a uh he's a reformed lutheran which that's what i think luther came to do is reform and he said and i asked him i said well you're a former lutheran why why reformed and he says well he said the lutheran church has got away from what luther taught and they've gone into more formalism and this and we want to get back to what luther taught which is more of the charismatic more of the healing more of the that type of thing i thought that's that's good you know let's get back to what the messenger said messenger taught it yeah so so we were talking and we have to be careful as we're talking even in public we have to be careful because somebody's always listening and as we were talking there was another lady that was another mexican lady that was working at the hotel and she witnessed my conversation with the catholic lady and then she witnessed my conversation with my colleague and she comes up to the table and she says she says i feel that you're a pastor she says she says i i want to talk to you and i said okay sister let's talk and we talked for a little bit and she she said my church i go to i like my church i like my pastor but he doesn't just stay with the bible he starts he teaches kind of what the church teaches and there's a baptist church he says she says i just want a church that teaches the bible amen amen yes and i said well sister i'm not a pastor but i said i have a friend that is here in flagstaff and i sent her to brother steve robinson's church and and i don't haven't followed up with him i set up the initial contact i don't know where it's gone yet but uh she saw that her church had an image of christianity but it wasn't entirely right there was something a little bit off with her church and she wanted just that pureness yeah amen and and so often we get in our mind what religion is right right and it's not real it's just what we've been taught that we've been born with amen there was i was my mom um we mentioned cancer you mentioned cancer my mom was dying of cancer a few years ago and my family all of us from the hospital have a close family i'm really proud of my family my both my two brothers they work at voice of god recordings and and my sister's husband works there too so so we're all and we were all together and we were in the hospital and mom was there suffering and it really brought us together and one of my siblings made this statement said that if brother branham was here he would come in and all of these sick people would be healed and they'd all they'd all leave the hospital well and it wasn't a time for correction right and sometimes wisdom is is in silence amen so it wasn't that time but i thought no no no that's that's an image that we have created yes sir right right brother brown amen and it's not real right now my family if you listen to tapes you've heard of the evans family that they as close as any other people were in the world to brother branham and i grew up with all these stories and the greatest thing about brother branham as i as i ministered the other night was his love was was his spirit that he had it wasn't the miracles it wasn't the understanding right it was the love that he had and i think that we need to be careful that satan is the the bible says in first peter it says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walking about seeing who he may devour yes sir so these are perilous times this is a this is a very dangerous time for us to be here amen and one thing that i think the devil has done is he has give us given us complacency sure and right it's not necessarily the the drug addict or drunk or the homosexual or the adulterer or these these people that are that are in danger of being devoured by the devil they know their destination they won't be surprised on that day amen right but maybe it's us in this room that have to be careful be very careful that we are not just complacent very true because we have a church to go to or or we go to a certain church or we believe a certain prophet yeah or we have a certain family or our husband is this or our wife is that friends we can't be complacent it's very dangerous because the enemy has set up images before us and it's very easy to fall for these images like amen and my my sincere concern is what if the enemy and i think it would be his greatest achievement has made people think that they have the holy spirit that's right and they really don't yes sir true he's such a good deceiver he's far far more powerful and greater than we are but what if he can make us think that we are saved or we have the holy spirit and we are really not right and i think every one of us should check up and should be careful of this yes amen jesus said he said straight is the gate and narrow is the way right and and he said this too he said few that will be defined it's it's a scary time and he's talking about us he's warning us be careful amen so these are truly perilous times and and it's it's an extremely deceptive spirit and i want to talk about one place where this spirit started one of these spirits and that's in babylon and there's this guy named nimrod in the old testament in the book of genesis and he built this tower and he was really proud of it and it was this tower of battle and there we have the very foundation of babylon and we see we see babylon what it did is it put up images before the people it was an idolatrous country it brought up images before the people and these images weren't real and and we see them today we see them let's say in hollywood and young people you know you're always seeing hollywood and they're putting these images before you they're even called influencers sure am i right right yes are they called influencers like on the facetime the snap face am i right they're called influencers and they do they influence us and and that's what that's what they're there for but they're not real you don't see these people's lives behind the scenes they look like these beautiful people but their lives are different and they're not what what we want to be but hollywood places them in front of us like babylon did yes there there's this place in los angeles where where you walk down the street and there's these stars right in the sidewalk yeah and these stars are moved they're they're memorials to movie stars and uh mostly you know what the place is called it's called babylon court why what what what a strange coincidence appropriate right there i was on i was on uh google maps and uh google maps is the coolest thing you know you you can look on it and and you grab that little guy and you drop it you know he wiggles his hand and he lands and all of a sudden you can look all around and you can see the street and all that and i think that's how we should do with the bible is we can take ourselves and we can open this bible and we can drop ourselves in this bible amen and then we can look around yes it's no good this word is no good to us if we can't place ourselves within this world amen amen so let's uh let's place ourselves within this word today amen and within babylon and uh let's turn to daniel chapter two because there is a religious application it's not just hollywood we're talking about babylon amen now let me lay a foundation here we set the stage what happens is daniel was was taken from his home when he was when he was a young man and there's all these these hebrews and they're living in this great country called babel and they're the king his name is nebuchadnezzar the king has a bad dream he has a spiritual dream and this dream he knew had significance so he calls his all of his ministers together and he says listen i had this dream and i want you to tell me what it means but here's the catch i'm not going to tell you what my dream is right he said you're going to tell me the dream and then i'll believe what you say all right and if you can't i'm going to cut you into pieces yeah and you're all going to die yeah and they're like oh we can't do this this is this is impossible only only they say only a god can do this so the king's like this is what i say you're all going to die so they are wiggling like a worm and a limit right now and and they're going around and they're talking and the word comes down to this prophet named daniel and then daniel does this in verse 17 now we we say we pray for each other all right daniel the prophet goes to his friends shadrach meshach and abednego they're that's their babylonian names their hebrew names are in verse 17. and he asks his friends he said hey will you pray because this is really a bad situation so like we did our prayer request earlier daniel ask for prayer and they pray amen amen and then the lord gives the interpretation gives the dream and the interpretation to the prophet damn so then daniel in verses 19 through 23 he thanks god for what happened and then he gets before nebuchadnezzar and i want to read verse 26. he says this the king answered and said to daniel whose name was belter art thou able to make known unto me the dream which i have seen and the interpretation thereof now daniel gives a very good answer and he gives a very prophetic answer and this is a very important answer the king says can you daniel interpret this dream daniel says daniel says all of the soothsayers and all of everybody nobody can interpret it but then he says this and this is how we see a true prophet of god he says but god came amen yes sir so then daniel interprets this dream to nebuchadnezzar mm-hmm and he in this dream is so powerful that this dream it's the next 600 years of time yeah and and it tells about uh alexander the great and the different ones that are coming in and it it it lays out what's going to happen to nebuchadnezzar's to his kingdom and all down through so it's very very important so nebuchadnezzar is taken back this man told him what he dreamed he said you were laying on your bed told him told him how he dreamed it yeah and brother he may have said his address yes he may have said what was ailing him like we know from what we know he may have he may have said these things we see we saw that repeated amen you're 2600 years years since that time in our time amen this man of god yes so very very important now we have a stage now i want to show you what's happened here the very next verse in daniel chapter 3 verse 1. let's see the results and how what nebuchadnezzar does nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was three square cubits and the breadth thereof was six cubits and set it in the plain of dura in the province of amen we know the statue this image that nebuchadnezzar directed was the image of daniel right yes and this is what he had in his mind of what daniel was he's this perfect statue he's this perfect thing of gold and he's this high and everything that was in nebuchadnezzar's mind he put it into this statue amen and he says this is this holy man but the problem is that statue was not real amen that statue was not daniel and what we do is we do the same thing yes we have this great image of whatever it might be of a church of a prophet or these things and we create this image and that image is not real amen and it happens so often and it becomes deceptive yes right and what it does is it draws a circle of separation right and it separates like that catholic lady i'm not like you i'm better than you i'm more special than you i'm different yes because of this part of my religion and that's what nebuchadnezzar did nebuchadnezzar drew this circle and said if you don't worship him then you're out yeah you know you're dead that's what happened yeah you kids know what you want to know gracie do you know what happened to the people that didn't worship that statue it's a famous story they got thrown in the fiery furnace amen yeah and we know shadrach meshach and abednego we know that story you know that story makes me yeah it's one of my favorites amen so so nebuchadnezzar separates them and what do we do today if you don't meet my circle as nebuchadnezzar did not only we don't we don't cast you out in a fiery furnace we do worse worse we cast you out of christianity you're not even christian we say you're not bright that's way worse than nebuchadnezzar could have done amen you're different than me so you are out yeah and that's what nebuchadnezzar did yeah and that spirit comes all the way down now 600 years to jesus's time and we have these people called the pharisees and the sadducees and the pharisees they were the they were the priests to the common people they were the ones the pastors of the churches they were in there they were in with the people they were kind of the ones that that jesus had a little bit of pull with that paul had a little bit of pull with yeah and then we have the sadducees you've heard of the high priest catholicism those were the sadducees they were the top notch yeah they were better than everybody and and they hated each other and then you have the essenes over here and the essenes are like you're all too worldly for us and then they go out and they live in this community in the desert and they preserve the word though that's where the dead sea scrolls come from amen these essenes and they they preserve the word but they were better than all of you all so you have the pharisees here the sadducees here the essenes here and they all believed the prophet moses yeah yet they separated themselves right on doctrinal differences on images that they would lift up before the people and they separated us amen and jesus came and they were so locked into their understanding and their ideas these images of what a good hebrew should be of what moses taught and washing dishes and and not eating catfish or or bacon or whatever it might be and and they had they had all these things and everything was so important and i'm not saying this because i'm worried about the pharisees agencies and i hope that we can see some of the things that we've done yeah amen and they had all the people separated because this washes dishes this way this one does this this one believes in the seven thunders this one believes in the tapes only from this come this over here the five full ministry this over here is the return ministry did i get everybody but it's and that's what we've done right and that's what we do and what we do is we draw these circles and we cut each other out and by doing so we cut out the one that stands at the door in the eyes amen and that's the lord jesus amen an example of this is in matthew i want to i want to read this because this is a good example of matthew chapter 21 verse 25. this is a good example of the spirit in verse 21 i'm sorry matthew chapter 21 verse 25 the pharisees they're they're there with jesus and they're challenging and they ask jesus a question and jesus says okay he says i'll answer your question if you answer my question and he says this jesus says them the baptism of john was it from heaven or was it from men so look how they answer it should it should riley up a little bit it should it should be like you hypocrites listen to this verse um so they say this they say and they reason within themselves saying if we shall say from heaven then he will say to us well why did you not believe him and if we still say of men then we we fear the people for all hold john as the prophet and they answer jesus and say we can't we can't tell you friends what a horrible answer what a bunch of cowards amen why didn't they really pray about it and answer him in the right way but they were so worried about their images that they had among themselves that that they couldn't even answer that question amen their images were more important than their their religion right and that's what we need to be careful amen of doing jesus christ said he said there's a very very important thing that he said he said i am the way yes the truth and the life amen amen no one comes to the father except by me yes that means not through our images that means not through our churches that means not through our families not through our our groups right but it comes through christ and we have to be careful in cutting each other out amen because what it does is it promotes discord it provides fighting exactly and there is no unity there and that's satan's goal yes you see it in hollywood you see it in politics you know up there democrats and republicans right brother was telling me the other day he went he went on on a tour of a cave and he had three or four people that had two masks on like double masks yeah and it said something on the mask um i forgot what it was but very very liberal group and then you had this this group over here that had no mass and had shirts on saying trump 2024. going down in a cave together and he said it's really awkward because they're in the middle of them and they didn't speak you know and it's it's the same with us so you see that spirit of separation and division it's the same thing that happens with us right yeah we have one little thing that's important to us and we are willing as nebuchadnezzar did to separate out ourselves yes and cut everyone else and we have to get everyone out we have to be careful we start drawing these circles yes and we we draw them smaller yeah and smaller and smaller and pretty soon we're the only ones standing in the circle yeah right right we cut our family out you know we we look and i'm going to talk about the book of acts here in just a minute being in one mind and one accord and we look at a husband and a wife and if that husband and a wife if they have one purpose in life whether it be for their children it could be it could be almost any purpose but if they're together on one purpose then they'll be okay but if they're not if they have an image in their minds of this is how my husband should act or this is how my wife should act and they create this image in their minds and they're they're caught up in and how each other should act and many times that marriage fails right sure now um jeremy and i were up uh hiking um you know around christmas time and uh we were up in the tucson mountains we were hiking and we were kind of we were kind of talking about our wives and kind of and thanking the lord for the good wives that we have and we were talking to each other about about how good they are and and both jeremy and i were kind of kind of in our heart we want to be better husbands you know and and it's one of us was saying it's like you know sometimes if we get in a tiff with our with our spouse with a man so many times you want to say listen in first corinthians chapter 11 it says that the that christ is the head of the man the man is the head of the woman so you got to listen to me and you got to do this yeah i'm not going to ask anybody raise their hand but i think jeremy said is that doesn't do any good right yeah it doesn't because what you're doing is you're taking this word and you're hitting that person over the head right right and that's not what this word is for right now it's not but if we have one purpose as a husband and a wife now we'll get somewhere amen so we have jesus the pharisees and the sadducees the ones that should have accepted him they turned him down so he has this little group of people now and he starts telling them here's what's coming and he he gives them instructions on what to do and in the in the end of all four gospels he gives them instructions on on how to handle things and on what to do and then we see in the book of acts we see that all of these disciples there was 120 of them in one room and they all were moving in the same direction amen like a husband and a wife with one common purpose with love between each other and if we can get in that place friends all of us can if this church could with the small group of people here if this church could get really with one mind and one accord you can change the world amen that's right they did yeah 120 of them they changed the world amen so they were in one mind the bible says here in acts chapter 2 it says they're in one mind i'm sorry they were in one quality we know that that's also with one mind right amen and they had one purpose and that purpose was to spread the gospel what is the gospel that the messiah has come amen jesus came so they did that they were in the first time they go out they go out preaching the gospel you have you have peter over here 3 000 people peter preaches one service 3 000 people get baptized you have all of them going out doing different things you have philip over here and he's having this great revival and all of a sudden he goes on to the desert and talks to this eunuch and leads him to the lord you have you have james and james is the pastor of the church you know you have him there in jerusalem he's holding down the fort in jerusalem all with one mind and one accord they're going out they're doing great things yes miracles are happening in acts chapter four they're all together they all come together the the disciples give a report here's what's been happening and we even got persecuted we even got beat and everybody's rejoicing they it's strange that you know they got beaten and then they're happy you know they got beat but they got to suffer for the lord amen and so much so that as they were rejoicing the bible says they were they were of one heart and one soul yes how beautiful is that that they were together amen the holy spirit comes into the room this wasn't the day of pentecost a little while earlier this is a different time the holy spirit comes into the room and it was so powerful that the walls of the building amen from the power of the holy spirit friends that's what we need amen but we have to have one purpose and one purpose isn't to follow these images they're gonna set before us so often that one purpose is to lift up jesus christ the lord yes that's what that little lady now that lady and um and flagstaff that's what she wanted she saw that she wanted that that jesus christ he didn't want a church you know she wanted a church but she didn't want that to be her salvation yeah she wanted that relationship amen with christ and they had it in the book of acts yes and it was beautiful and they were going out and they were doing great things there's another time that 5 000 people came to the lord after that [Music] great things were happening and friends something started to creep in and we see little signs sure of what creeped in remember we're gonna drop ourselves into the scriptures things started to happen and then there's things that were a little bit off returning your bible was first corinthians chapter one and we see that things started there there was there was something that was going amiss here this wasn't that great time in the lord and paul sees this he sees these problems and he's saying no no no no no no no no no no don't go there then you put down these images don't do that and we see in verse 9. first corinthians chapter 1 verse 9. let me read it to you paul says this and he's writing a letter to this group this church in corinth and he says this he says god is faithful by whom you were called in the fellowship of his son by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord amen now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that you all speak the same thing yes and that there be no divisions among you that's right that's support hey man i'll see something coming in yes and he's he's he said wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait go back go back and he says this that there'll be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment amen for it hath been declared unto me of my brethren by the immature the house of chloe that there are contentions among you yep now this say i that every one of you say that's a lot yeah every one of you is saying this now paul is laying down some correction here don't do this every one of you is saying this right i am a paul and i am of apollos and i have cephas and i have christ paul puts himself right in there the brother branham of his age says you're saying that you're a brother brown right don't do that right amen don't do that amen paul's saying it right here this is the bible this isn't me or my opinion right this is what paul is saying he says he says here now this every one of you says i am a paul and i have apollos and i have cephas and i have christ and he says this is christ divided was paul baptized was paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of paul right man and look what this messenger is doing he's like no no no no get back to christ get back to christ you're starting to separate you're starting to divide don't do that get back right yes sir but friends the good news and i pray that all of us can think about what i'm saying right now the good news it wasn't paul's job to turn the hearts of these people to turn the hearts of the children back to that right of the pentecostal fathers amen he wanted it so bad but it was not his job right right that job came 2000 years later right when a man came to earth he said come out of these denominations come out of this get away from these images your church isn't going to save you your pastor's not going to save you these things aren't going to save you only christ is going to save you amen and then and then and then he says get back to that that was his job it was not paul's job amen paul wanted it but it wasn't for him amen yeah right and then friends so now here brother bennett around the world we need to get back to this original yes day of pentecost amen to when the holy spirit came down to where jesus christ himself in spirit form came down at the day of pentecost brother branham said he ripped himself he tore himself into pieces amen and placed them on each one yes amen that's what we have to get back to is that that was his commission we make him something different that he didn't want to be and then we start drawing our lines of separation when he said don't do that his commission in revelation chapter 18 was come out of that amen don't do it and yet the human nature we go back and do it all right and friends amen we need to stop amen and i'm not talking about as as i'm speaking i'm sure that we can all point our fingers at other people that's not what i that's not what i'm here for right it's the person sitting in your chair standing in my shoes that's right that is what it has to be yes and it can start and it needs to start and it's love understanding differences you know unif unity is not uniformity we're all different look at the day of pentecost they were all different very very different people and they had a little bit of this but it was okay because they were all had one purpose yes and that's what we need to get back to and i'll close with a quote that i had another quote that i wanted to read but i'm not texting but uh i wanted to read this quote i had another quote that the one that i read at the ministers meeting but but i think this one's better i read this at service the other night and it's just beautiful brother branham says this in the church age book in fact he closes the church age book he was so proud of that book he came to my grandpa and and when he had finished that book he was so proud of the exposition of the seven churches he came to my grandpa and gave him one of the books he was just he was really excited about it and he thought that he was going to really make a difference and then the lord took brother branham off the scene right at that right around that time and he closes his book that he was so proud of he closes his book with this statement he says not for one moment do i bring a message to the people that they may follow me amen or join my church or start some fellowship and organization i have never done that and will not do that now amen i have no interest in those things but i do have an interest in the things of god and a people and if i can accomplish just one thing i will be satisfied now this is a very very important person that's saying sure we believe had pate had a very important job amen that was prophesied in the bible and he says this if i can just do one thing melissa this is what he wanted to do this one thing and it's so important to me that his ministry is accomplished in my life yes it's my greatest goal that not for brother branham but it's it's my greatest goal that i can see what his his greatest want is i can see it accomplished in my life and my wife and my family he says this if i can accomplish this one thing i will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between god and men amen amen we're in men and he's not talking just about men he's talking about all of us humanity humanity right between god and men wherein men become new creations in christ filled with his spirit amen and live according to his word amen amen yes i would invite and plead and warn all to hear his voice yes this time yes amen and yield your lives completely to him amen even as i trust in my heart that i have given my all right yes to him praise the lord god bless you and may his coming rejoice your heart amen and friends this is not a man that wanted an image made of him you're right this is not a man that wanted to be lifted up in front of the people like daniel was amen that's not that was not his goal he wanted us to have that relationship with christ and friends i can say today my family started following brother branham in the early 50s they drove around the country following him just wanting to hear this man preach because he was different yeah my that was the evans family my other side of my family was a deacon in brother branham's church by the wheeler he was a deacon for brother brandon my aunt jacqueline who was in church the other night at the tabernacle she played the piano for brother brown yeah right so i i see all of this and in the heritage that i have i see what it is and it's i've seen it get wrapped around brother branham and lifted up an image yeah that wasn't that's not real amen not real but there was a real daniel yes and it wasn't that statue and there was a real william brown amen and it's not so much what we what we make of him but i say this in the name of the lord jesus his ministry was a success in my life amen because he introduced me to the lord jesus christ and i pray that you all have that same testimony yes sir today amen and you can talk directly to jesus amen you don't have to go through a mediator you don't have to go through mary you don't have to go through these different ones that you can talk directly to him in this quote that was his greatest goal yes let's uh before before i take my seat i uh i would like to pray for everyone and um friends i pray that that what i've said afraid that i encourage you that um you'll hear that voice as brother ram said and that you will have that relationship and let's let's bow our heads think about jesus and how we want that relationship lord jesus we lift you up before the people father may everywhere we go everything that we say everything that we do lord every person in this building here now as they go out into the world may the world look at that person and see jesus christ walking in flesh as they did at the day of pentecost lord so we pray that it would be now thank you father as brother branham's commission was to turn our hearts back to that day lord let it be a success i pray and father let it be a success not only here but around you the world i pray and may lord we be a testimony that jesus christ is real yes and he's alive yes jesus i love you i pray to you in the name above all names the name of the lord jesus amen amen my friends god thank you brother god bless you amen you enjoyed that yeah appreciate what brother daniel had to say very prominent for today the day that we live you know i've been on the rapture message for about two and a half months and i thought that's pretty uh i guess appropriate for the time frame but that message today was just absolutely outstanding for the day that we live friend and a lot of what goes on around us and the things that happen out in the world and i love the way he brought it down from a carnal aspect into a spiritual aspect to understand it's not just hollywood has put these images or you know or government or uh or or other religions that have their buddhas and their their their statues that they worship and that they talk to and they pray to but that it is so prominent to understand that the device is the enemy and what satan is doing today even amongst people that we know and that we rub elbows with and and they call themselves christians and message believers it's become a mantra i'm a message believer yeah but are you a christian he talked to a catholic lady that said i'm not a christian i'm a catholic but when we talk to one another or something we say well i'm a message believer yeah but are you a christian to me friend there's a difference yes the bible says that not all is israel is of israel and i think there is a there's a place today that not all that says there's bride is bride and the point of the of it is that people make themselves images that they that they want to follow uh because it's it's probably the easiest religion you can have neglectinism is is is overcoming the world again because it's very easy you know you just bow to this image and you do your pitches and you go home and live however you want to there's no there's no responsibility to pray there's no responsibility to reach bibles you know little responsibility coming church come when you can just make sure you drop the money in the box where everything's okay and that's just an image friend how many times we talked about that religion is nothing but a covering that's all it is people just want to get under that covering they want to get in the shadow of that image and think they're okay it doesn't work that way amen you've got to know jesus christ and him crucified the power of his resurrection to be your lord and savior and for him to fill you with his holy spirit if you ever expect to leave this place in a rapture amen amen amen and that that's the beginning and ending of it amen praise the lord and you can't have an image of christ people have in their minds that's how they missed him to begin with right they were blinded not because god purposely came and blinded their eyes but they were blinded because they had this image in their mind of when the messiah come he was going to be like this right and he came so differently than they had imaged in their mind that when he came they couldn't see him they were blinded to who he was by their own image and they couldn't see christ and people do the same thing today right that image that people have in their minds what's supposed to be like this how many times have i told you so many times people pray for things and they ask god for things and they and and they and all of a sudden you have in your mind this is going to be the way god does it that's right you know when god does something completely opposite you totally miss it because he didn't do it the way you thought he was going to do it well that's just an image right you built an image in your mind of how you thought it was going to be and god's like no no i'm going to do it like this and he does it like this and we completely miss it it would completely obscures everything that just if we can just approach jesus with the open mind open heart and look to him and expect him to speak to us and answer what we're looking for the way he wants to do it according to his word now it's never going to be against his word we know that right but according to his word and he'll do it amen and he does it he does it every time amen amen sometimes he brings healing by passing by people passing on but we don't expect they say lord heal them well he heals them because he took them home and they're perfect now yeah well that's not what i was wanting well you know i had a brother one time i don't mean to be preaching but there's an anointing here back east and he had this carnal thing in his heart he wanted a mercedes and he always wanted this mercedes he prayed god on of us he actually prayed for our savior i don't know that i could be that forth with gold god gave me a mercedes but he did he is his testimony he prayed for a mercedes and he was a musician and he went into the store one time and they went over and he found this trump he looked at it he picked it up and he played it and it sounded perfect he loved it he said i'm going to buy this he turned around and looked at it and he said mercedes [Laughter] what exactly what he was thinking about i doubt very seriously he put the key in and drove that home but he was able to play it for the lord god answered his prayer in a way that he could use that for the lord amen but he had his he had this image in his mind this is where it's going to be let me get rid of those things amen those are hindering spirits we get rid of those things you know brother brother green said many times brother branham came and this is brother green's testimony so i don't take he said brother graham told him you'll find when you come to tucson you'll find nine different interpretations of my message amen right you know he said i did i get them all i i don't know i'm not really that concerned about those but i understand why i did i've done that myself you know and things that you think are sort of on the outskirts of sure what we believe or the fundal fundamental foundation of the message the scriptures and and that's that's all i care about friend you know there's if you hate anyone or have any bitter spirits you're in danger of hell fire and that's if we just hold to that word and hold to christ and and yeah the message is in the word amen the message is in the word i believe that brother brown said but you know as long as i'm the pastor of this church brother branham's picture will not be right there it'll be jesus christ amen amen because he's my lord and savior uh there's nobody has a higher respect and regard for the prophet of god to come and this message that leads us and brings us to a truth it it just reminds me a couple weeks ago because i've been on the rapture and um we were talking about people saying that the uh out in the world and i've heard some people in the message oh this don't get the vaccination it's it it's the mark of the beast and brother dennis brought a very good point you know without this message people could believe that people would actually believe that that that vaccine is the walking face brother branham tells us plain we know very real what the mark of the beast is amen and it's not a vaccination uh but anyway uh and people have their own opinions about that but you see in that how the devil is dividing i told you this my church over a year ago that satan was going to use that as a dividing point and he sure has tried to do it yes but i'm just just it's not going to happen in this church amen but you know you got the the covet non-covenant and you got the people that are so strong on one side of the other and then all of a sudden you had the mask and the no mask people and now all of a sudden you've got the vaccinated and the non-vaccinated people and and they can't give enough levity to one another to think that maybe i'm not supposed to have it or you're supposed to have it and that we can still be brothers and love one another regardless and that's what i heard that's the whole point that our brother was trying to make um i i don't believe that we're cookie cutter christians we didn't roll off of some assembly line and god just stamped us out as we came down on this earth and said there's new there's daniel there's and then bam bam and we all go no we're all different we serve different purposes we have different gifts we have different places god puts us and everything that goes in line with that and and all that comes down the fact that god may lead me in a way he's not going to lead you right he may cause me to do something that you're not going to do he may cause you to do something and i may not understand it but it's not going to be outside the word right it's not going to be sinful but i may not understand it ways okay but give the brother give the sister give humanity enough levity to understand that we are all led of the lord jesus and that's what i've told you here friend just do what you feel led to do let god lead you right right your man said god didn't send man to lead a man he sent the holy ghost to leave right now the holy ghost is supposed to be our portion the holy ghost is supposed to lead us and guide us and bring us into all truth yes amen not brother brandon brother branham wasn't seen here to bring us into all truth god almighty was sent here he used a gift and a man to do it but god was sent here i know brother dan worked at the voice of god and i don't mean this in a derogatory manner and and and i don't mean to be contrary about it but i've disagreed i've told you many times i've disagreed with with the fact that the the the seal book says the revelation of the seven seals because see brother branham can't give anybody a revelation brother branham wasn't seen here to give you a revelation only god can give you a revelation now i believe the book contains the truth of the seven seals right and you can read that and god can give you a revelation of it but brother branham wasn't sitting here to give anybody a revelation he was just sitting here to preach the gospel and let that word move into your life and permeate into your spirit so that you can become the word yeah let that word become you yes amen i believe that's what he was yeah he was just that example he just happened to be the wave chief it was just that example for us but can't we do that in understanding that my brother can too and that my sister can too and and then they might be a little different in it amen but we're all the same we're all headed to that one goal that one purpose that one reason and that's that reason that i believe their brother was talking about today that every one of us i believe here today and i believe around the world in this city and uh in this state around the world are are gained for that purpose i mentioned the prayer requests for those uh in afghanistan because you know sometimes you see some images and you see things that are going on and they're very disturbing because those are human beings those are they might not be my children they might not be my family they might not be in my home my four no more but they are human beings with a soul worth 10 million worlds and it disturbs me to see when people are treated that way and then when you hear reports of christians fearful for their lives now god's going to take care of his own right we understand that yes but we but but he calls us in responsibility to pray for those people it's like it's like jesus said ask seek and you'll find now he asked us to ask but don't you think he already knows what what we want right he already knows what's in our heart but he still asks us to ask god's going gonna take care of his children but he still asked us in petition for them so that's what was on my heart those uh those christians over there and i believe there's that i believe there's uh as we call them bride over there message people i do believe there are so they're going to be coming from every tongue kindred nation people from all around the world and i believe there's some there so if there are i believe the lord will take care of him amen i was blessed today about what what our brother brought absolutely and i think it's paramount to what we're uh looking for the lord today because it's those images we got to shed out of our lives and look to christ and and what was one of the last things in that quote that he read and his coming amen his coming amen i'm looking forward to that with great expectation friend anticipation there's so many going beyond the curtain of time now so many loved ones many friends people i know uh from all over the country and uh they're passing on at a young age at an older age but uh i'm looking forward for that great reunion time yeah amen i got a son over there i got a dad i got a mom i got a brother i got a sister and relatives i got i got a lot waiting on me amen so i'm looking forward to that are you yes but never lose your enthusiasm for the coming of the lord amen i believe we should stand that place yes and expect any moment in time amen in the moment and tweakling of the night the lord's going to change his sign i tell you i believe there's a greater purpose to it but if that minister's meeting served no purpose other than the fact that brother daniel come and minister get to know him today that praise the lord i'm happy with that amen plus he's a dorado deer amen you can't go wrong with the ceo stand if we could i'm very appreciative appreciative of everyone that comes today and was here appreciate each one and visitors and all you're all welcome anytime of course as you are brother daniel um and if you suffer on your

jesus amen that's what's most important amen having the lord in your heart in your life praise the lord amen [Music] jesus [Music] wonderful to me he is so wonderful to me he is so wonderful because he first love me hallelujah amen god richard bless you today you know i i met many many men people in my life that knew brother brown personally spent time with him and i and i fellowship with them with all different doctrines and the way they believed and i've talked to brothers that don't talk to each other and at odds and many of them have passed now but at odds with one another differing opinions or doctrines and and i talked to all of them and they all believed this message and believed brother branham to be a prophet but the one thing that i found in common in all of them besides the love that he mentioned was the humility that brother branham had in mind that's right every one of them without fail told me he was the most humble person they had ever met that speaks volumes especially with the gift given to an individual like that to take that and make yours and see how you can how much humbler you can make yourself with what god has given you amen and i and i said that because i want to say this i see that humility in my brother here i see that humility of brother dan i didn't meet brother branham i was alive 10 days on this earth with brother brown i was born on december 15th and past december 24th and but but that humility right that i know i've seen i see in our brother and he was very contrite even at the minister's meeting and that spoke volumes to me really does especially when you see so much kingdom building and it's me and my church in this uh i've always told people you know if god wants somebody to come here he'll send them here and that's that's my belief amen i don't have to advertise the guy that rented us a place said you could put a sign out there and somebody another brother said well we can increase your footprint on social media i'm not here to build a kingdom if god wants them here he'll send them here and i believe that that may be naive i don't know but that's the way i believe it right yes and so it is what it is so amen so i appreciate brother dan appreciate the message god bless you all appreciate you coming brother john jesus business lord we thank you lord for your goodness lord appreciate your mercy lord god and us the message that you brought to us today good reminder lord god it's nothing but the truth lord god thank you help us to take that to heart lord thank you for quickening that to our souls lord god

god humble spirit that he has dedicated hearts to you lord god may you continue lord god to keep him that way humble lord god and as you reveal anything to any of us lord god or jesus yes help us as your prophet said to see how we could become that much more smaller for your glory and honor that you would be glorified about jesus as we would through us as you will lord draw men unto yourself lord not sauce or any thing or any program but to you lord yes we're vessels from yours and god help us to just to cleanse ourselves or keep ourselves clean as you said god lord we're dependent only upon you lord for these things for thy glory and honor we love you father jesus christ amen amen god bless you you have to have a little offering or something for brother dan slip in the box down there we'll make sure brother dan gets every penny of it of course the church will give an offer too if you want to write a check make it to the word of god tabernacle and we'll make sure brother dan gets
