[28:47] welcome to announce the Lord and then
[28:49] those who have come in a little bit
[28:50] later brother Dennis if you take these
[28:52] needs to the Lord of course but I
[28:53] appreciate
[28:55] Lord Jesus with our hearts and heads and
[28:58] reverence to a great and almighty God
[29:02] Lord we want to be humble as we present
[29:07] our prayer requests before you yes Lord
[29:10] I can recall what the prophet said it's
[29:13] not how big we think we can become
[29:16] business how little yes that's the only
[29:19] way you can amen oh Lord we know the
[29:22] scripture says help us he did exalt us
[29:24] himself shall be a base and he that
[29:28] humbles himself should be exalted yes
[29:30] for God resists the proud and giveth
[29:34] Grace unto the humble and Lord there's
[29:37] so many that that think they have
[29:40] something uh even a A Gift of Gab or
[29:44] whatever and Lord if it's not totally
[29:48] surrendered to you lord it's their own
[29:51] abilities will fail you at the end and
[29:55] Lord we are needy people father and I
[29:58] can recall one time there was a Roman
[30:01] Centurion in that was had some great
[30:05] Authority and he sends his servants to
[30:09] speak to you Lord that one of his
[30:11] servants was sick and and needed a
[30:15] healing touch and when you when he spoke
[30:19] to that Centurion father you
[30:22] heard him say that you're not worthy to
[30:26] come under my roof but just speak the
[30:29] word yes and my servant shall be healed
[30:32] amen and Lord you said I have not found
[30:34] so great of a faith in Israel as this
[30:38] man this Centurion and Lord where is our
[30:42] faith when does it lie father Lord we
[30:46] don't have to love defeated lives it's
[30:50] for the promise that we live to know our
[30:52] privileges when we get away from the
[30:55] word when we stray from the truth that's
[30:59] when that enemy defeats us that's when
[31:02] we can't hardly look up to see the
[31:05] bottom but father it's not your
[31:09] um it's not our fight it's your fight
[31:11] it's not our our Battleship battle
[31:14] father and Lord when it gets rough and
[31:17] it gets tough and we're walking in the
[31:20] lows of valleys Lord that's when you
[31:27] and help us to recognize father the Lord
[31:31] to grow that extra mile to seek you more
[31:36] diligently than ever before yes to stay
[31:39] with your word there's only one way we
[31:42] can stay with your word it's to let your
[31:44] holy spirit will live and bring us
[31:47] through to your word the very word that
[31:51] you wrote you cannot deny any part of it
[31:54] and when we feel that we are denying it
[31:57] it's not your holy spirit it's the LIE
[32:01] of the enemy that's keeping us from your
[32:05] truths that are been presented this
[32:09] morning this man that needs Deliverance
[32:13] in the name of Jesus Christ he's running
[32:16] from you father catch him let the let
[32:20] the Justice be done let him fall all
[32:23] even now underground they commit his
[32:26] heart his life to you and do what he
[32:29] needs to do that's right and Lord all
[32:32] the other requests all that need a
[32:34] healing touch father we come boldly
[32:38] because we can identify it with that
[32:42] Centurion Lord we have the faith to
[32:45] claim healing whatever we have needed
[32:48] and for our loved ones we call you
[32:51] understand that Great and Mighty
[32:53] physician or the high priest that can be
[32:57] touched by the feelings of my own
[32:59] friends and with your stripes we are
[33:01] healed we claim victory we claim healing
[33:04] we claim Deliverance yes Lord there's
[33:07] many are going through mental battles
[33:10] but through

[33:19] be we claim delivers in the name of
[33:22] Jesus space Satan get your hands off of
[33:26] God's Property we adjure you in the name
[33:29] of Jesus Christ to leave these people we
[33:32] call them soon for for victory in Jesus
[33:36] and father and all the unspoken prayer
[33:40] requests you know his heart Lord may you
[33:43] just grant him their heart's desire may
[33:46] it be above all father to stay with your
[33:49] word yes to claim your promises Lord
[33:53] You're Not Gonna it's like the prophet
[33:56] said it's not the big things we do for
[33:58] God it's the little things we leave
[34:00] undone it's not the great Revelations we
[34:03] might not understand it's the little
[34:05] things where we fail you and those
[34:07] little things will keep us out of the
[34:09] kingdom of God granted father bless our
[34:12] our pastor and a godly man that Waits on

[42:38] off last week
[42:45] that of course we'll start with Genesis
[42:47] 1 1.
[42:48] this will be the new beginning part 18.
[42:52] we're almost done
[42:54] those who may uh
[42:57] be looking looking maybe to the end of
[42:59] this we are almost done yeah so praise
[43:02] the Lord just a couple more services I
[43:04] was looking at it unless the Lord
[43:06] changes something probably two to three
[43:08] more services of uh Beyond this one so
[43:12] probably a couple more into this one so
[43:15] amen new beginning that is true every
[43:17] day it ain't God opened my eyes to see
[43:20] another beautiful day
[43:22] let's just bow our heads if we could
[43:24] before we read this uh the word of God
[43:26] here Lord Jesus we're indeed grateful
[43:29] again Lord of all that you do for us
[43:30] we're thankful father for being here
[43:32] today we thank you for this place you've
[43:34] given us to come in from out of the
[43:36] world lord it's just a time of Solace
[43:38] that we have Lord attacked continually
[43:41] every day all the time and all around us
[43:43] Lord and seeing the degradation of
[43:46] humanity and and people just falling
[43:48] apart Lord it just it saddens my soul so
[43:52] much Lord but it feels so good to come
[43:54] into this place and become regenerated
[43:56] and renewed once again Lord as would
[44:00] could be said Lord even a new beginning
[44:01] here that you give us father from out of
[44:04] the world from out of those spirits and
[44:06] not of the things that would try to
[44:07] Buffet us so hard every day father and
[44:10] just worship you and glorify and praise
[44:13] you and learn of you and speak of you
[44:14] Lord and just sing about your glories
[44:16] and all that you do for us Lord it just
[44:18] it feels so good to our souls Lord It's
[44:21] a scouring out lord of the things of the
[44:24] past week and and Lord just entering in
[44:26] Lords will receive whatever you have
[44:28] need for us today and we thank you for
[44:30] it Lord thank you God for those that
[44:32] have come Lord and for those who may be
[44:34] streaming and just pray that your Holy
[44:36] Spirit would once again have the
[44:37] preeminence here Lord to do the
[44:39] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[44:41] could ever ask for a thing fill all this
[44:44] house where we are sitting here today
[44:46] God and do as you did on the day of
[44:48] Pentecost raise our faith up Lord come
[44:51] with power and manifestation Show
[44:54] Yourself real once again flow through
[44:57] this place Lord as you have done so many
[44:59] times and raise our faith to the level
[45:01] to receive and believe whatever you have
[45:04] for us today God show that word to our
[45:06] hearts reveal it help us to be
[45:08] encouraged by it Lord today maybe
[45:10] nothing new maybe nothing revelated or
[45:13] what people might say today but just
[45:15] something of an encouragement Lord to
[45:17] know that Lord this life that we're
[45:19] going through and all that we see around
[45:20] us and the degradation of humanity
[45:22] you'll never touch that sod it'll never
[45:25] be seen in that place nothing of the
[45:28] devil or any of his devices or any of
[45:30] those evil spirits will ever be felt
[45:32] Lord and God will be such a place such a
[45:35] Time thank you for it Lord thank you for
[45:38] the promise of your word Lord as we just
[45:40] enter into a little portion of it once
[45:42] again today expecting you to meet with
[45:44] us Lord and speak to us from it Grant it
[45:47] God may you anoint speaker and hear a
[45:49] like and we rebuke every demonic spirit
[45:51] that would try to hurt hinder and
[45:53] filtrate this service in any way Satan
[45:55] you have no place here you must go we
[45:58] adjure you in Jesus Christ's name amen
[46:00] you be all the glory honor and praise
[46:02] Lord Jesus for we commit ourselves to
[46:04] you now Lord in the name of the Lord
[46:06] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen
[46:10] Genesis chapter one read a couple verses
[46:12] again here in the beginning
[46:14] God created the Heaven and the Earth the
[46:17] Earth was without form and void darkness
[46:20] is upon the face of the deep and the
[46:22] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[46:24] waters and you could be seated if you'd
[46:26] like
[46:28] it's just outstanding I I just enjoy
[46:30] reading that I guess every time it may
[46:32] become old to you I don't know but I
[46:34] just enjoy reading that every time
[46:35] because it just inspires me inspires me
[46:38] to think of what God did and just the
[46:40] operation of God and sending forth his
[46:42] Spirit through his low Gods to move upon
[46:45] the creation that God creates for us he
[46:48] created that creation here he's gone to
[46:51] prepare prepare a place for us for a
[46:53] creation there and give us just a little
[46:55] Glimpse amen I think some of probably
[46:58] what we're in store for uh is not
[47:01] written in the scripture for us to read
[47:04] I think some of it would probably go
[47:06] beyond our human intellect or where we
[47:08] couldn't even comprehend it anyway uh
[47:11] and and and this Revelation thereof so I
[47:15] guess to maintain our human sanity the
[47:17] Lord put limits on certain things that
[47:19] he put down and he just I guess let John
[47:22] say that guy's never seen ears that are
[47:24] Paul I has not seen ears not heard
[47:27] neither in the heart of man what God's
[47:29] got in store so I guess that sums it up
[47:31] amen so what little bit we have here and
[47:34] some of it we venture on a little bit as
[47:36] I've said I told you some things I try
[47:39] to notate and make sure you understand
[47:41] or read it from the scripture or if it's
[47:42] something brother Branham said or
[47:44] something even that we crossed that I
[47:46] may have a personal opinion about uh
[47:49] I'll let you know that but we all have
[47:50] those thoughts and uh you know I I would
[47:54] I would rather take the scripture and of
[47:55] course even brother branham's word even
[47:58] if brother Branham is dramatizing
[47:59] something I take that over pretty much
[48:02] anybody else so amen so thankful for
[48:05] that but let's go over to Revelation
[48:06] chapter 21 we're going to try to pick up
[48:09] where we left off
[48:12] amen and I want to get this I have this
[48:14] turned around so I didn't want it become
[48:16] a distraction
[48:18] but this is the service and the time I
[48:20] wanted to spend a little bit more time
[48:22] and since we've spent so much time on it
[48:24] already uh I probably won't spend as
[48:27] much time on it today but I kind of try
[48:29] to draw it out a little bit better with
[48:31] some specifics and stats and I actually
[48:34] tried to uh make the Earth which the
[48:37] Earth is not perfectly round like that
[48:39] but the tambourine under here is so
[48:42] that's why I drew that off of if you're
[48:44] wondering how did he get such a perfect
[48:46] circle I was in here hunting for
[48:48] something and that's what the lord gave
[48:50] me to scale uh based on the earth and
[48:54] the pyramid-shaped mountain that that
[48:56] brother
[48:57] round about it's going to push up from
[48:59] the earth and because it was always a
[49:01] con a thought of mine uh how is
[49:04] something that is seemingly that large
[49:07] going to belch up from the earth when we
[49:09] see all that the Earth is going to go
[49:11] through obviously it becomes pretty
[49:13] clear but when you look at it in
[49:15] retrospect or in perspective of the size
[49:19] of the Earth it really isn't that big uh
[49:22] we we think about the 1500 miles and I
[49:25] did come up and did some math on the
[49:27] dimensions of that we tried to do that a
[49:29] little bit the other day but this was
[49:32] kind of the time I kind of got ahead of
[49:34] myself the last couple of services is
[49:35] what I'm trying to say this is what I
[49:37] wanted to try to present I had it on a
[49:40] flash drive that I did at the Tabernacle
[49:42] one time that Jordan put on for me
[49:44] couldn't find the flash drives so I
[49:46] thought well I've got a board here I put
[49:48] it on the flash drive there because I
[49:50] didn't have something to draw on uh
[49:52] brother green had talked over and over
[49:53] about getting something I could write on
[49:54] that would show up on the screen but we
[49:57] never did that so everything I did I
[49:59] just had to put in a computer and anyway
[50:03] so this time I could draw it and this is
[50:06] basically what it looks like with a lot
[50:07] of the numbers uh but if you uh some of
[50:11] the things I don't have here are the
[50:13] dimensions that we talked about last
[50:15] week now uh let's just read this again
[50:18] Revelation 21 1-2 and I saw a new Heaven
[50:21] and a new Earth for the first Heaven and
[50:23] the first Earth were passed away and
[50:25] there was no more C and I John saw the
[50:28] holy city New Jerusalem coming down from
[50:30] God out of Heaven prepared as a bride
[50:33] adorned for her husband also
[50:35] uh versus uh verse 16 uh we'll start
[50:39] with in the city life Foursquare the
[50:42] length of it is the largest of breath
[50:43] and he measured the city with the Reed
[50:45] uh 12 000 furlongs which we talked about
[50:48] last week that is 15 approximately 1500
[50:52] miles the length and the breadth and the
[50:54] height are equal so sideways long ways
[50:59] up ways is all the same are equal uh and
[51:03] he measured the walls there of this
[51:04] we'll get to the walls another time uh
[51:07] so in in reading that in uh reading that
[51:12] back over again this is some of this is
[51:14] more in line with the dimensions that we
[51:17] talked about now uh we try to put it in
[51:21] our minds brother Branham tried to kind
[51:23] of explain it about from here to here I
[51:25] did some math yesterday it didn't take
[51:27] long uh but from San Diego from
[51:30] basically the Pacific Ocean to almost
[51:33] Shreveport Louisiana is 500 bottles we
[51:37] talked about I think I came up with
[51:38] Odessa and then Dallas actually it's
[51:40] farther than that it's more than half of
[51:43] the United States east to west so from
[51:45] the Pacific Ocean to almost or
[51:49] approximately Shreveport Louisiana
[51:50] that's 1500 miles and 1500 miles it's
[51:54] incredible but uh it come out and all
[51:57] that I could find that basically from in
[52:01] Tucson from the southern border from the
[52:03] United States Mexico border to the
[52:05] United States Canadian border is
[52:07] approximately 1500 miles so border to
[52:09] border top to bottom north to south is
[52:12] approximately 1500 miles if you set that
[52:15] city right here now we know it's not
[52:17] going to be set here amen we already
[52:19] know that's going to be over in
[52:21] Palestine where Abraham of course met
[52:24] Melchizedek and we'll I'll read
[52:25] something about that either this week or
[52:27] next week to to refer to that so the
[52:30] dimensions of the 1500 you can keep it
[52:32] in your mind basically from the Pacific
[52:35] coast and Pacific Ocean to Shreveport
[52:37] Louisiana and from the Canadian Southern
[52:39] uh northern border to the Mexico
[52:41] Southern border the United States of
[52:44] 1500 miles and of course it's going to
[52:46] be 1500 miles high now some of the math
[52:50] I wrote down uh somebody had mentioned
[52:53] to me and I had thought about it too so
[52:54] I decided to look it up said well man
[52:56] that that seems like that would take us
[52:58] almost to the Moon well the Moon is 238
[53:02] 900 miles from the earth so
[53:06] it's not even going to be remotely close
[53:09] to the Moon uh the Moon is a lot further
[53:12] away from the earth uh than uh than the
[53:15] 1500 miles I kind of Drew this and this
[53:18] this is pretty close to scale okay so
[53:22] the the scale of it the Earth were this
[53:24] big the the mountain with the the
[53:26] mountain I drew it as a pyramid but
[53:29] remember the pyramid is just the
[53:30] geographical shape it's going to be a
[53:32] mountain
[53:33] uh that pushes up kind of about where
[53:36] it's how much of the Earth would have to
[53:38] push up to make this mountain come up so
[53:41] you think that's going to be really high
[53:42] and yes it is it's going to be really
[53:44] high uh 1500 miles is 7 million 920 000
[53:49] feet
[53:50] seven thousand seven million 920 000
[53:53] feet divided by a plane traveling at 30
[53:56] 000 feet if you've ever fallen on the
[53:57] plane which we talked this mountain the
[54:00] top of it is going to be 264 times
[54:03] higher than a airplane flies right
[54:07] 264 times higher than an airplane flies
[54:11] which is incredible the other the only
[54:13] other thing I could think of a rule of
[54:16] measurement beside the moon which really
[54:19] doesn't bring much of a perspective on
[54:22] the uh because you can't really consider
[54:25] 238 900 miles 1500 miles that's a drip
[54:28] in the bucket but the space station has
[54:31] anybody ever seen the space station go
[54:32] over I've seen it we've I've done hikes
[54:35] up in Mount Lemmon out where it's just
[54:37] darker dark and you can see it going
[54:39] over uh over the space station uh goes
[54:43] over the Earth or orbits the earth at
[54:44] approximately
[54:45] 227 miles
[54:47] above the Earth's surface so this this
[54:51] this mountain is still going to be a
[54:55] quite a bit higher than even the
[54:57] International Space Station would travel
[54:59] but then when you start encompassing and
[55:01] that's why I put the 1500 miles here
[55:05] the Earth is almost 8 000 miles from
[55:09] Court through the core from top to
[55:11] bottom uh almost 8 000 miles so again
[55:15] this is five times uh the Earth is five
[55:19] plus times larger than this mountain is
[55:21] going to be so again when you think
[55:23] about the scope of how large it's going
[55:25] to be how high it's going to be it
[55:28] really as big as it is going to be it
[55:31] really doesn't take a whole lot of the
[55:34] Earth
[55:36] um it doesn't even remotely come close
[55:38] to the Moon uh but it does kind of
[55:41] fathom the brain when you think about
[55:42] beyond the ozone layer which I think is
[55:45] about 20 miles something like that uh
[55:48] and then the space station 227 miles uh
[55:51] this is this is going to be uh much
[55:55] higher than that but we can't think but
[55:58] now I mentioned ozone ozone layer and I
[56:00] mentioned space uh uh crap uh I I did
[56:05] look up uh the furthest orbiting
[56:07] satellite and it's billions of miles
[56:10] they say so that didn't even come into
[56:13] view either so I thought well how far
[56:15] are these satellites up there but you
[56:17] can't think of those again like I said
[56:19] last week we can't think in those terms
[56:21] so much I try to bring it in perspective
[56:23] for us uh so that we maybe can fathom
[56:26] what is going to go on and what it's
[56:28] going to be and look like but we really
[56:30] we really even struggle with that
[56:32] because everything's going to be changed
[56:35] right everything's going to be different
[56:36] there's going to be no more seat there's
[56:39] going to be no more seeing there's going
[56:41] to be no more germs diseases uh space
[56:44] station won't be up there all all of
[56:46] where the space station is and all is
[56:49] going to explode all of that atmospheres
[56:52] Heavens are going to explode all the
[56:54] gases and all that they have found out
[56:56] there are going to explode all that
[56:58] stuff is going to be done away with
[56:59] there'll be no more sin there's going to
[57:01] be no more even atmosphere of sin Satan
[57:05] will be in the Lake of Fire the devil
[57:06] Lucifer will be in the Lake of Fire and
[57:08] all his followers and all of that that
[57:10] you have to put up with and see every
[57:12] day all that's going to be done away
[57:14] with the Lake of Fire uh everything
[57:16] about what we know and how we conceive
[57:18] And precede things in this world is
[57:20] going to be all changed it's gonna be
[57:23] all different so when you think wow the
[57:24] airplane there won't be airplanes we'll
[57:26] travel is a thought uh 1500 miles high
[57:30] that is that is way high up off the
[57:32] Earth but again it's going to be so
[57:34] different that it's it Beyond this it's
[57:38] really hard to explain it's really hard
[57:40] not just to explain but to comprehend
[57:44] it's really hard to Fathom in our brains
[57:47] uh how this is going to be but by the
[57:51] scripture how how the scripture teaches
[57:53] us what brother Branham taught us about
[57:55] that and maybe some of you have spent
[57:57] some time listening to Future home this
[57:59] week I hope you have if you didn't maybe
[58:01] next week because we're not quite done
[58:02] with it yet but I know brother Dennis is
[58:04] over there not in his head he told us
[58:06] Wednesday when we went to lunch he had
[58:07] been listened to it I did two again uh
[58:10] most of it anyway to to two plus hours
[58:13] of it uh so I hope you did it it gives
[58:18] us a little more perspective Amen to
[58:21] follow along with and and see how this
[58:24] is is going to be set up and uh again I
[58:28] tried to make this more to scale so that
[58:30] it would it would you could see it a
[58:33] little better uh and maybe even in our
[58:37] little human P brains comprehend a
[58:39] little bit better
[58:40] how it's going to unfold and how it goes
[58:44] these numbers can be overwhelming these
[58:47] things when you think about them can can
[58:48] can overcome you and overwhelm you and
[58:50] think how can that be how can that be uh
[58:53] and and a lot of it is still how can
[58:57] that be how can that be but uh when we
[59:00] know that God can do anything uh God can
[59:04] make it however he wants we're not going
[59:06] to be in this world anymore this Cosmos
[59:09] living under the elements that we live
[59:12] today uh then
[59:15] what is there is there a limit to God
[59:19] there's no limits God can do whatever
[59:21] you want whenever you want however you
[59:23] want and in whatever way he wants amen
[59:26] so uh so we I want to finish now with
[59:31] with this and with that pyramid shape
[59:34] mountain with that mountain uh that we
[59:37] know it's going to push up I'm not done
[59:39] with it yet but I want to start focusing
[59:41] more on the city now
[59:43] amen were the uh John sought I saw the
[59:47] holy city New Jerusalem coming down from
[59:51] God out of heaven
[59:53] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[59:56] husband now to me and what I know and
[59:59] brother random said that City that God
[1:00:01] has gone to prepare for us which we will
[1:00:03] probably talk about next week more in
[1:00:05] detail
[1:00:07] um comes as it comes down is what it
[1:00:11] says the holy city coming down from God
[1:00:13] out of heaven
[1:00:15] prepared is adorned for her husband
[1:00:16] would set upon after this pyramid-shaped
[1:00:20] mountain has been pushed up will come
[1:00:23] down upon that mountain Amen in what
[1:00:25] fashion what form how much of it I don't
[1:00:28] know that's up to God right it doesn't
[1:00:31] say brother Adam doesn't say uh does it
[1:00:34] just is it just on the top is it just on
[1:00:37] the bottom does it fill the whole 1500
[1:00:40] miles around only God knows that that's
[1:00:42] his that's his choice that's his
[1:00:44] decision
[1:00:45] um and and when you and when you look at
[1:00:48] this don't look at it look at it as you
[1:00:51] look at the mountain I I know I keep
[1:00:53] trying to harp on that but don't look at
[1:00:55] it as a pyramid with cut Corners look at
[1:00:59] it as a mountain like this uh and the
[1:01:02] way the mountain is shaped it's not
[1:01:04] shaped like a a
[1:01:07] geography or a geometry excuse me where
[1:01:11] it's just squares and cuts and Corners
[1:01:13] we do this is based on trying to
[1:01:16] understand how it is but it's going to
[1:01:18] be a mountain
[1:01:19] just like this just like the Catalina
[1:01:22] mountains right here it's going to be
[1:01:24] just like that pushed up from the earth
[1:01:25] just like these mountains were pushed up
[1:01:27] from the earth amen it's going to be
[1:01:29] just like that now this city that comes
[1:01:32] down I want to get to a specific part of
[1:01:35] this today that I want to talk about
[1:01:38] uh before we go
[1:01:40] and I'm going to read from future home
[1:01:43] here this uh this quote that I want to
[1:01:46] give to you says now uh the Lord in that
[1:01:49] day
[1:01:50] now look we're you know what let me read
[1:01:53] uh let me read these other scriptures
[1:01:56] first let's do this first uh let's go to
[1:01:58] the 23rd verse we've read it already uh
[1:02:01] but I want to read it again 23rd through
[1:02:03] the 27th and the city had no need of the
[1:02:07] sun neither of the moon to shine in it
[1:02:11] for the glory of God did lighten it and
[1:02:14] the lamb is the light thereof amen so it
[1:02:18] has there's no need of the sun neither
[1:02:20] of the Moon
[1:02:22] because the glory of God is going to
[1:02:25] lighten it for the lamb is the light
[1:02:27] amen amen now if you want to chop God
[1:02:30] into two or three pieces the
[1:02:31] denominations can do that but these are
[1:02:34] the self-sing person amen that lamb is
[1:02:38] that logos the thought of God remember
[1:02:41] Abraham went looking for a foundation
[1:02:44] whose Builder and maker was God who had
[1:02:46] foundations whose Builder and makers God
[1:02:48] and remember in the beginning when we
[1:02:51] read Genesis 1 1-2 in the beginning when
[1:02:54] God created when the logos came out of
[1:02:58] God that word that light that came out
[1:03:01] of God that created God did not take a
[1:03:04] saw and a hammer and a drill and build
[1:03:06] this Earth he spoke it
[1:03:09] the logos came out in word form as he
[1:03:12] spoke it and created by his own word yes
[1:03:16] that's how God creates by his own word
[1:03:18] so when that word came forth it created
[1:03:22] this rock that we're standing on today
[1:03:24] yes yes but it wasn't done with uh tools
[1:03:28] and with enhancements God spoke it and
[1:03:31] that logos as it created that's the
[1:03:34] creation of God God created that so that
[1:03:38] lamb now of that logos that came forth
[1:03:41] and went and went into the one that
[1:03:44] Abraham met on his uh that went down and
[1:03:47] sent the two angels to Sodom uh when he
[1:03:50] met Melchizedek uh when Jesus Christ
[1:03:52] came forth in the seed of a woman as a
[1:03:55] man as a kinsman redeemer it's God still
[1:03:58] condescending all the way through not
[1:04:01] two Gods Not three Gods the same one God
[1:04:05] who manifests himself in all these
[1:04:08] different ways that he does Amen we know
[1:04:12] mostly As the as the father-son the Holy
[1:04:15] Ghost well the Bible says God did
[1:04:18] Enlighten it the lamb is the light of it
[1:04:21] praise the Lord the lamb is the light
[1:04:23] thereof and the Nations of them
[1:04:26] which are saved shall walk in the light
[1:04:30] of it and kings of the Earth
[1:04:33] amen listen now Kings of the earth not
[1:04:37] just of this city
[1:04:38] but of the earth look now uh
[1:04:43] the Earth do bring their Glory and Honor
[1:04:45] into it into what into this city
[1:04:50] and the gates of it shall not be shut At
[1:04:52] All by day for there shall be no night
[1:04:55] there
[1:04:56] and they shall bring the glory and honor
[1:04:59] of the Nations into it and there shall
[1:05:01] in no wise enter into it anything that
[1:05:04] defileth neither whatsoever worketh
[1:05:07] Abomination or maketh a lie but they
[1:05:10] which are written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:05:12] Life
[1:05:13] praise the Lord
[1:05:15] now let's go down to 22nd chapter fifth
[1:05:18] verse and there shall be no night there
[1:05:23] amen when you have a continual Perpetual
[1:05:27] illumination as the lamb is and will be
[1:05:31] to this city there can't be a night
[1:05:34] there can be as long as the lights are
[1:05:37] on in this room Darkness can't exist
[1:05:39] right praise the Lord if the lights in
[1:05:43] this room were Perpetual existence
[1:05:45] continually there could never be dark in
[1:05:50] this room
[1:05:51] as long as there's light there can't be
[1:05:54] Darkness praise the Lord so
[1:05:56] there shall be no night there
[1:05:59] and they and they need no candle or lamp
[1:06:02] neither light of the Sun for the Lord
[1:06:06] God giveth them light and they shall
[1:06:08] reign forever and ever praise the Lord
[1:06:10] now let's go to this quote I was going
[1:06:12] to read in uh in future home if you
[1:06:15] listen to it this week it'll probably
[1:06:17] sound familiar to you the Lord in that
[1:06:19] day upon the top of it upon the top of
[1:06:23] what upon the top of this mountain
[1:06:25] upon the crest of this city
[1:06:28] upon the top of it shall create a fire
[1:06:32] of light to burn upon upon the day well
[1:06:37] you say day because the only reason to
[1:06:39] make it work right is to separate the
[1:06:41] two and he goes ahead and says it'll be
[1:06:44] a shelter a rest a refuge which we'll
[1:06:48] read uh maybe if I get to it in uh in
[1:06:51] Isaiah he talks about it being a refuge
[1:06:54] um
[1:06:56] uh in in Isaiah notice make exactly this
[1:06:59] speaking the Bible exactly if the walls
[1:07:02] are straight up and down he's talking
[1:07:03] about the walls of the city not the
[1:07:04] walls around the city uh you've got to
[1:07:07] differentiate the two not the actual
[1:07:09] City itself but he's talking about the
[1:07:12] actual City itself as some would think
[1:07:16] this is still a cube a man with a flat
[1:07:19] top and sides that are 1500 uh that he
[1:07:23] says now brother man said if the walls
[1:07:25] were straight up and down you could not
[1:07:27] see it amen there would be uh the
[1:07:31] shadows of that on the sides of a cube
[1:07:35] if you will
[1:07:36] it has to leave
[1:07:38] all of my Holy Mountain we read that
[1:07:41] scripture Isaiah he will create this
[1:07:44] light upon this mountain and it shall be
[1:07:47] for a defense now I've got to be honest
[1:07:51] with you that part I don't necessarily
[1:07:52] understand
[1:07:53] although we will get into uh those that
[1:07:57] are outside the city those are outside
[1:07:59] the wall those that bring the leaves in
[1:08:01] for the healing of the Nations and this
[1:08:03] is the part the point where Jesus Christ
[1:08:06] begins to rule the nations with a rod of
[1:08:08] iron
[1:08:09] Isaiah said it shall be for a defense
[1:08:13] this light shall be for a defense oh we
[1:08:17] have a song you talked about that amen I
[1:08:20] think we've sang that song last week
[1:08:21] maybe notice Mount Sinai was where God
[1:08:24] descended on top of it
[1:08:27] uh when he spoke to Israel in the pillar
[1:08:29] of fire he descended on top of a
[1:08:32] mountain now Sinai on the Mount of
[1:08:34] transfiguration we talked about the
[1:08:37] mountains was it last week or or maybe
[1:08:39] the week before I can't remember of the
[1:08:41] significance of the mountains uh
[1:08:43] suggested maybe you go back and listen
[1:08:46] to uh uh what is the attraction on the
[1:08:48] mountain that brother Brown talks about
[1:08:50] the experience and all that he had uh
[1:08:52] what he called Mount sunset sunset
[1:08:54] Mountain
[1:08:55] of these uh events scripturally
[1:08:58] happening on the mountain when he
[1:08:59] declared this is my beloved Son hear ye
[1:09:02] him he descended in a pillar of light in
[1:09:05] shining brightness upon the top of the
[1:09:07] mountain Before Peter James and John and
[1:09:10] there he was represented with both Moses
[1:09:12] and Elijah the translated and the dead
[1:09:15] raised oh my on this Throne on top of it
[1:09:19] again top of the mountain 1500 miles
[1:09:22] high amen amen 1500 miles high the hole
[1:09:27] now he says the whole world he corrects
[1:09:30] it later but not in the quote I'm
[1:09:31] reading here but he says the whole world
[1:09:35] will see the light uh of that world
[1:09:39] Jesus sitting on the throne on top of
[1:09:41] the world now World being as in
[1:09:46] you could say Cosmos again or the world
[1:09:50] as it exists in that City or outside
[1:09:52] that City
[1:09:53] it is not possible that this would lie
[1:09:57] down here
[1:09:58] I mean well possible I just said God
[1:10:01] could do anything so yeah God could do
[1:10:03] that but but in thinking in natural
[1:10:06] terms uh if the lights up here it would
[1:10:09] not light down here
[1:10:10] and and brother and brother random goes
[1:10:12] on later to explain that so I I just
[1:10:16] believing here that when he says the
[1:10:18] world he means that the world that we're
[1:10:21] living in remember a world is simply an
[1:10:24] atmosphere uh when brother Adam said you
[1:10:26] could create your own world and go live
[1:10:28] on it well you can create any atmosphere
[1:10:30] you want wherever you are and live in
[1:10:32] that atmosphere because that's what the
[1:10:34] world is the world doesn't constitute
[1:10:35] just a ball of dirt or this slump of
[1:10:38] clay that we're standing on a world is
[1:10:40] an atmosphere a place that you live it's
[1:10:42] where you are it's your existence amen
[1:10:45] and you can create that existence
[1:10:46] wherever you are in your home or in
[1:10:49] church or in your car or whatever
[1:10:52] whatever atmosphere you want to live in
[1:10:54] you have it on your job you have the
[1:10:57] ability to create that atmosphere and
[1:10:59] live it it doesn't matter if anybody
[1:11:01] else around you is living in it or wants
[1:11:03] to live in it that's irrelevant what is
[1:11:04] relevant is the fact that you are living
[1:11:07] where you want to be amen and where you
[1:11:11] desire to live in peace and love and
[1:11:13] harmony and Grace and blessings and
[1:11:15] healings and love and you want to live
[1:11:17] in that atmosphere live in that
[1:11:19] atmosphere don't worry about what
[1:11:20] everybody else is don't worry about what
[1:11:22] the world looks like and what's going on
[1:11:24] you live in that atmosphere and you want
[1:11:27] to create it in your car you want to
[1:11:28] create it by hugging a lady at the bus
[1:11:30] stop you want to create it at your job
[1:11:31] of those who are mocking and making fun
[1:11:33] of you whatever you need to do you
[1:11:35] create that atmosphere and live in
[1:11:38] simply a world Jesus is the light of
[1:11:41] that world
[1:11:42] amen he's the light of this world he's
[1:11:44] the light of our world that is that is
[1:11:47] what I will create in the world I live
[1:11:49] in for him to be the light of Praise the
[1:11:52] Lord so honestly it is just a
[1:11:55] manifestation of what we live
[1:11:57] spiritually today
[1:11:59] who we are what we desire to anyway
[1:12:03] sitting on Throne on top of the world
[1:12:05] top of the church top of Mount Zion 1500
[1:12:09] miles high says half the size United
[1:12:11] States is actually as we have found out
[1:12:12] it's top to bottom takes up the entire
[1:12:14] United States east to west it takes up
[1:12:16] about two-thirds of the United States
[1:12:18] when you when you do the math and it
[1:12:21] raises Plum up so you can see in the
[1:12:24] world over
[1:12:25] 1500 miles high and all up and down all
[1:12:30] up and down the Earth will be the
[1:12:32] redeemed now Earth again not here he's
[1:12:36] talking about that City
[1:12:38] that part of that mountain where that
[1:12:40] city is setting will be the redeemed
[1:12:43] City uh city with the throne in top
[1:12:46] Revelation 21 23 they need no light for
[1:12:49] the lamb uh the lamb and the Lord God is
[1:12:52] the light thereof see the Lord God is
[1:12:55] that Pillar of Fire that led the
[1:12:58] children of Israel through the
[1:12:59] Wilderness amen he actually if you look
[1:13:03] in that quote up he actually says
[1:13:04] followed but that's not accurate uh they
[1:13:08] he led the children of Israel not
[1:13:10] followed the children of Israel that led
[1:13:13] the children of Israel through the
[1:13:15] Wilderness so if you're looking at that
[1:13:16] and you look at it you say brother
[1:13:17] Newton misquoted it no I didn't uh I
[1:13:20] just changed the little verbiage there
[1:13:22] from the state they he led the children
[1:13:24] of Israel through the wilderness and he
[1:13:27] is ascended upon the throne in that
[1:13:29] perfect Kingdom when that Kingdom that
[1:13:31] Jesus is to surrender the father God
[1:13:33] might be all in all Jesus sets upon his
[1:13:37] throne here is our Joseph then the king
[1:13:39] that is the light the light that will be
[1:13:42] on top of Mount Zion and His Holy Light
[1:13:45] will flood the entire city and then of
[1:13:50] course he says hallelujah praise the
[1:13:52] Lord I can say the same thing Hallelujah
[1:13:54] that that light will light the whole
[1:13:57] city when this isn't anything that's
[1:13:59] unusual to us we know in the scripture
[1:14:02] that it tells us many places and we have
[1:14:04] many instances where Jesus God the logos
[1:14:08] manifests itself as a light
[1:14:11] uh we just sang that um we just sang
[1:14:14] that course a few minutes ago he's the
[1:14:16] Holy Ghost and
[1:14:18] fire praise God the Holy Ghost in fire
[1:14:21] when that Holy Ghost comes into your
[1:14:24] life that fire burns out the old nature
[1:14:27] yes praise God if there wasn't a fire
[1:14:30] there to cleanse and remember fire is
[1:14:33] the best cleanser that we know of it's
[1:14:36] the best purifier that we know of that
[1:14:38] fire comes in and burns out and cleanses
[1:14:41] every bit of unrighteousness that was in
[1:14:44] your soul
[1:14:45] every bit of it maybe it burns it out
[1:14:48] the Holy Ghost in Fire and it's keeping
[1:14:51] me alive
[1:14:53] um Hebrews Hebrews chapter 12 verse 29
[1:14:57] for our God is what
[1:15:00] a consuming fire
[1:15:03] praise the Lord what does the fire do a
[1:15:06] fire not only Burns a fire not only
[1:15:08] purifies a fire illuminates
[1:15:12] a fire brings light praise the Lord if
[1:15:16] you were in this room with no lights on
[1:15:19] in the middle of the night you couldn't
[1:15:22] see maybe the eyes uh the the your hand
[1:15:24] in front of your eyes if you struck a
[1:15:26] match
[1:15:27] it would probably like most of this room
[1:15:30] you could probably see at least parts of
[1:15:32] what was in the room you might can see
[1:15:34] parts of the wall and you see how much
[1:15:37] more power the light has over the
[1:15:40] darkness although see sometimes people
[1:15:43] seems like like to follow the darkness
[1:15:45] uh I don't know there's there's become
[1:15:48] this wholesale celebration in this
[1:15:51] country at least of darkness and it's
[1:15:54] baffling to me I guess it comes from uh
[1:15:58] uh what like superheroes or Star Wars or
[1:16:01] whatever you know uh people like to
[1:16:05] celebrate Darth Vader why he was a
[1:16:08] wicked evil murderer
[1:16:10] but they they talk about embracing the
[1:16:13] darkness
[1:16:14] why do people like Darkness so much when
[1:16:18] a simple match in a room that's pitch
[1:16:20] dark would scatter that Darkness the
[1:16:23] light is so much more powerful than the
[1:16:25] darkness it is actually uncomprehensible
[1:16:28] but people remember though John 3 says
[1:16:31] Saint John 3 they the men love Darkness
[1:16:35] rather than light amen why because their
[1:16:38] deeds are evil that's right amen their
[1:16:40] deeds are evil and the light exposes
[1:16:42] them right but the light and the
[1:16:44] exposing and what is that exposing that
[1:16:46] exposing us to bring it to bring it out
[1:16:49] the fire brings it out the fire burns it
[1:16:53] the fire purifies it the fire
[1:16:56] illuminates it amen to let it be to let
[1:17:00] it be known there's something going on
[1:17:02] here that's that's not right that's why
[1:17:04] people would rather have Darkness and
[1:17:06] Light they'd rather walk around as
[1:17:08] brother Adam said like the little boy
[1:17:10] and going through the the cemetery
[1:17:12] whistling like he's not scared
[1:17:15] in the middle of the night midnight
[1:17:16] going to a a graveyard little boy of
[1:17:19] course he's scared I know when I was a
[1:17:21] little boy a lot of times didn't even
[1:17:22] like to go in the daytime
[1:17:24] my dad would take me through where my
[1:17:28] mom and dad are buried my ancestors my
[1:17:30] my uh my son my daughter or my not my
[1:17:34] daughter excuse me my sister
[1:17:37] my sister I do have a son there but not
[1:17:40] a daughter uh or Barry and my dad used
[1:17:43] to like to take me through and say this
[1:17:44] is so and so and there's so and so and
[1:17:46] so and so on I don't remember
[1:17:48] uh but I like being with my dad so I
[1:17:51] enjoyed that time but I did not like
[1:17:53] walking through cemeteries even as a
[1:17:56] little boy I would walk through
[1:17:57] cemeteries uh like you know you're
[1:18:00] trying to avoid uh
[1:18:02] something on the floor I I just I never
[1:18:06] would step on any grave or anything I
[1:18:08] mean that was uh that was I don't know
[1:18:11] when I was a little boy you taboo I
[1:18:13] don't know what do you call it when
[1:18:13] you're a kid or something I just I hated
[1:18:16] it then but it's like uh people walk
[1:18:19] around this earth like that they walk
[1:18:21] around on the earth and they think that
[1:18:22] everything is okay and that you know
[1:18:24] they're twilling thumbs and they're
[1:18:25] whistling and they think everything's
[1:18:27] okay like the boy going through the
[1:18:28] graveyard not everything is not okay
[1:18:31] amen the light brings forth uh an
[1:18:35] illumination it brings forth the
[1:18:37] revelation of the darkness when the
[1:18:40] light even the smallest light comes
[1:18:42] forth it scatters Darkness yeah amen
[1:18:45] Darkness cannot stay where there is
[1:18:47] light praise the Lord so the light God
[1:18:50] represents himself through the scripture
[1:18:53] and many places we know as as light he's
[1:18:57] the consuming fire he's the Holy Ghost
[1:18:59] in fire uh again brother Ram said
[1:19:02] leading the children of Israel out of
[1:19:04] Egypt as God led the children of Israel
[1:19:07] by nine he led them by a cloud during
[1:19:08] the day by night he led them by a pillar
[1:19:11] of fire god and and as that Pillar of
[1:19:14] Fire moved they moved with it when that
[1:19:16] Pillar of Fire stopped they stopped and
[1:19:19] that's exactly what every one of us
[1:19:20] should do when God leads you follow him
[1:19:23] when he stops you stop when he moves you
[1:19:26] move where he goes you go with him but
[1:19:29] that's what the children of Israel did
[1:19:31] when God stopped they camped that was it
[1:19:34] they were there we used millions of
[1:19:36] people so it wasn't like half a dozen of
[1:19:38] us or 20 25 here in the church that we
[1:19:40] could just get up and go to a restaurant
[1:19:42] or something there's millions of people
[1:19:43] following this life
[1:19:45] and uh Moses was in charge of see so it
[1:19:48] wasn't just that easy but when it moved
[1:19:50] they moved when that light stopped they
[1:19:53] stopped but they were following that low
[1:19:56] gloss that light that manifestation of
[1:19:59] light that God is to prove that this was
[1:20:03] an illumination of the path that they
[1:20:05] were to walk brother around tells the
[1:20:07] story about a guy that uh that didn't
[1:20:10] want to believe what brother Brandon was
[1:20:11] preaching he said how do you know God's
[1:20:13] real and they come outside the church
[1:20:15] and they look and he says where do you
[1:20:17] live the man says I live on the other
[1:20:19] side of the house can you see the house
[1:20:20] no
[1:20:21] he said but I got a lantern he said well
[1:20:23] can you shine the Lantern on the house
[1:20:25] no can't see it well you know what's
[1:20:28] there have you been there yeah been
[1:20:29] there I know it's there uh it's just but
[1:20:32] you can't see it so how do I know it's
[1:20:34] theirs
[1:20:35] he said well how do you get there the
[1:20:37] man says there's a path right here that
[1:20:39] you can walk he says well how do you see
[1:20:40] the path he said I got a light he said
[1:20:43] but the light only lights you one step
[1:20:45] at a time
[1:20:46] praise the Lord but the light will
[1:20:48] illuminate the path to get you one step
[1:20:50] at a time to where you want to go
[1:20:53] to know that it exists that it is God
[1:20:56] Amen God leading him God doing the same
[1:20:58] thing today God struck Moses down with a
[1:21:01] burning bush
[1:21:02] Moses have you ever seen something
[1:21:04] burned you ever seen a burning bush I've
[1:21:06] seen trees burn bushes burn I've seen
[1:21:08] wildfires
[1:21:09] um I've seen uh I had fires campfires uh
[1:21:14] seen tons of stuff burned but you ever
[1:21:17] seen anything that burned that didn't
[1:21:18] consume
[1:21:20] I haven't that you set it on fire uh
[1:21:24] like a like a campfire you set it on
[1:21:26] fire and then and it just burns all
[1:21:28] night long
[1:21:29] no usually I'm not usually every single
[1:21:32] time I've started a fire or every single
[1:21:34] fire I've ever saw burned and consumed
[1:21:37] what it was burning but this bush did
[1:21:39] not consume so it had to be something
[1:21:42] other than the natural fire burning to
[1:21:46] destroy the bush it was gone amen it was
[1:21:49] that logos that came out of God that
[1:21:52] created this world that became
[1:21:54] Melchizedek that stood there and spoke
[1:21:57] to in a bush spoke to Moses there's a
[1:22:00] fire it was a light he saw that light he
[1:22:03] said I must turn aside amen I must go to
[1:22:06] sight and see this great sight one of
[1:22:08] the best decisions Moses ever made in
[1:22:10] his life right was the circle turn aside
[1:22:12] and go see that great site on the day of
[1:22:14] Pentecost
[1:22:16] they were in the upper room 120 of them
[1:22:18] sitting there the light came in
[1:22:21] that Holy Spirit came and lit upon each
[1:22:25] one of them and went into each one of
[1:22:27] them it illuminated the whole room and
[1:22:29] that power of that room became so
[1:22:32] Supernatural that people started
[1:22:35] knocking the doors out knocking the
[1:22:37] walls speaking in tongues the spirit of
[1:22:39] God moving to a place that the people
[1:22:41] that are around them and watching them
[1:22:43] thought they were crazy
[1:22:45] well you know they think the same thing
[1:22:47] today amen you can do about whatever you
[1:22:50] want in this world but when you become a
[1:22:51] Christian serve God and live like a
[1:22:53] Christian they think you're crazy why do
[1:22:54] you dress like that why do you look like
[1:22:56] that why do you not go there why do you
[1:22:58] not do this I had the the last week
[1:23:02] um we went into the hotel lobby I got a
[1:23:04] call for you and and all the guys they
[1:23:06] all bring and there they wanted to get a
[1:23:08] drink and says well it's up to them and
[1:23:10] the other guy the the curmudgeons and
[1:23:12] I'm winning over a little bit he said
[1:23:16] you're the only preacher I know that
[1:23:17] doesn't drink I said that's the that is
[1:23:19] the most shameful statement I think I've
[1:23:21] ever heard
[1:23:22] I did I said that is disgrace
[1:23:26] amen but but unfortunately it is
[1:23:29] probably true yeah I don't know but he
[1:23:31] said you're the only preacher I know
[1:23:33] that doesn't drink I said well I'm not a
[1:23:34] preacher I'm a minister remember we
[1:23:37] talked the other day about the
[1:23:38] difference and being a preacher at a
[1:23:40] Ministry said yeah you're right
[1:23:42] there's a difference amen that there's a
[1:23:45] fire see the Holy Ghost in fire Paul was
[1:23:48] struck down by a fire amen the pillar of
[1:23:50] fire that spoke out spoke to Paul too it
[1:23:53] wasn't a different part it was
[1:23:55] manifesting itself in a different way it
[1:23:57] wasn't in a bush amen it was in a cloud
[1:23:59] but it was the same God same logos that
[1:24:03] came all the way through that we just
[1:24:04] read about in the beginning God created
[1:24:06] same one nothing different same one that
[1:24:09] spoke to Moses out of the Bush he's here
[1:24:11] over Paul he says Saul Saul why
[1:24:13] persecute us thou me same God struck
[1:24:17] Paul uh Paul down and when Paul fell
[1:24:21] it changed his life amen at brother
[1:24:24] Brown's birth you know the testimony
[1:24:26] of the light that came in that shot
[1:24:29] through that window the the shuttered
[1:24:31] window they used to have shutters didn't
[1:24:34] just used to be decorations on the sides
[1:24:36] of Windows shutters actually used to be
[1:24:38] what covered the window right
[1:24:40] um and we don't have a lot of shuttered
[1:24:41] homes here though do we that's all back
[1:24:43] East uh but the shutters would actually
[1:24:45] cover that and it was propped open that
[1:24:48] white King shot in there and hung right
[1:24:49] over at his bird
[1:24:51] same like mademothe Ohio River one time
[1:24:54] said don't you eat drink don't you smoke
[1:24:57] or drink or defile your body in any way
[1:25:00] amen
[1:25:01] praise the Lord that same Pillar of Fire
[1:25:03] same Pillar of Fire had his picture took
[1:25:04] with him in Houston Texas where I'll be
[1:25:06] this afternoon not in that Auditorium
[1:25:08] but in Houston the fire that was over
[1:25:11] brother Branham that was took that
[1:25:14] brother Branham later said God honored
[1:25:16] Me by allowing me to have my picture
[1:25:18] taken with him amen that was over same
[1:25:21] pill or fire same God different
[1:25:23] manifestation amen may have been
[1:25:26] something like Paul experience we don't
[1:25:27] know but it's saying God same old God
[1:25:30] same word same creative power same light
[1:25:33] that came out and was and was there at
[1:25:35] that day I've seen them a lot like that
[1:25:38] I will say it's the exact same but it's
[1:25:40] God I believe it was God because you
[1:25:42] know Saints when God strikes you like
[1:25:45] that if you see something God manifests
[1:25:47] himself in that way something in you
[1:25:49] changes
[1:25:51] something in you uh you can feel
[1:25:55] you know it's different you know it's
[1:25:57] not something that's of the normal right
[1:25:59] because in you
[1:26:01] there's something different and you know
[1:26:04] it you can feel it
[1:26:06] it's God pulsating in you
[1:26:09] to let you know this is me
[1:26:13] this is this is me manifesting myself to
[1:26:16] you I've seen it in church I've had
[1:26:18] people tell me I had a girl one time
[1:26:20] when I was ministering in Florida she
[1:26:22] said that that was over my shoulder one
[1:26:24] time I didn't know you know you always
[1:26:27] feel the anointing but I I don't I
[1:26:29] hardly ever preach I don't feel an
[1:26:31] anointing so
[1:26:32] um gets me in trouble sometimes when I'm
[1:26:34] singing Because it blows my voice out
[1:26:36] because I just love to Worship the Lord
[1:26:38] but she saw that you know I didn't see
[1:26:40] it anybody else see it you know but she
[1:26:43] said she saw it it's just God God
[1:26:46] vindicating himself I've had other
[1:26:48] people tell me similar things I've seen
[1:26:50] those things on other people
[1:26:53] amen and in other situations it's just
[1:26:55] God God manifesting himself in that
[1:26:59] great light to show that he is still the
[1:27:03] light the light of the world
[1:27:05] so it's no uh it's no secret it's no uh
[1:27:09] uh
[1:27:11] you know no doubt that you you can't not
[1:27:14] believe excuse the double negative but
[1:27:17] you can't not believe what the scripture
[1:27:19] says about it because he has manifested
[1:27:22] himself through the scripture through
[1:27:25] our lives to see that it's just going to
[1:27:28] be the same God here Illuminating that
[1:27:31] city as he has shown himself all through
[1:27:33] the scripture right so what is there to
[1:27:35] doubt that's the word I was on
[1:27:37] how can you doubt what is there to doubt
[1:27:39] there's it removes all doubt to see that
[1:27:43] he would be there doing that when he has
[1:27:45] shown us that all the way through the
[1:27:47] scripture
[1:27:48] amen
[1:27:49] it's just him God manifesting himself
[1:27:51] let's go to Isaiah chapter four now I
[1:27:54] don't read that scripture that I read
[1:27:55] now there's others there's obviously
[1:27:57] other
[1:27:58] course time scriptures where God's
[1:28:01] manifested himself in the light
[1:28:03] God
[1:28:04] and again maybe you have experienced
[1:28:08] that in your life
[1:28:10] maybe you haven't doesn't make you an
[1:28:12] unbeliever doesn't make you a doubter it
[1:28:15] just God does it for some in some ways
[1:28:17] and some not others
[1:28:19] there's experiences that people have had
[1:28:21] and tell me about it and things and I'm
[1:28:23] like well I've never had that I've never
[1:28:25] seen that and you know I'm I'm like Lord
[1:28:28] I'd like to I'd like to get in on some
[1:28:30] of that I'd like to see that or or hear
[1:28:33] that or something uh I I've I've never
[1:28:37] heard god with an audible voice but I've
[1:28:39] had people tell me they've heard about
[1:28:40] it have you ever heard Bob with an
[1:28:41] audible voice
[1:28:43] anybody I thought there was some people
[1:28:45] in here that told me they had
[1:28:47] I've had something ring in my spirit so
[1:28:51] loud you would think it was an audible
[1:28:53] voice yeah in fact one of those times is
[1:28:55] the only reason I'm in Tucson
[1:28:58] when God spoke to me in that car that
[1:29:00] day on I-95 and going between St
[1:29:03] Augustine and Jacksonville told me to
[1:29:04] come here I knew it was him it rained so
[1:29:07] true it could have been Audible
[1:29:09] it wasn't but it was that real
[1:29:11] amen when those things happen you know
[1:29:14] it so if you have wonderful if you
[1:29:17] haven't that's
[1:29:18] a doubt or unbeliever or a or any of
[1:29:22] that
[1:29:22] you know God would give you the desire
[1:29:25] of your heart if you if you wanted to
[1:29:27] see some time the Lord could could
[1:29:29] manifest that to you but irregardless we
[1:29:32] know through the scripture we know how
[1:29:34] God operates God doesn't change we've
[1:29:36] got to always remember once God does it
[1:29:38] one way one time he's got to do it the
[1:29:40] exact same way all the way through he's
[1:29:42] not God yeah man so and seeing this and
[1:29:45] recognizing this in the scripture and
[1:29:47] brother Brown's description of it
[1:29:48] doesn't surprise us him amen Knight's
[1:29:51] actually really good sense Isaiah 4 5.
[1:29:56] and the Lord will create upon upon every
[1:30:00] Dwelling Place of Mount Zion every
[1:30:02] Dwelling Place amen I'll have a Dwelling
[1:30:05] Place in here I believe you'll have a
[1:30:07] Dwelling Place in here brother Branham
[1:30:08] even talked about when you hear uh when
[1:30:11] you when you go down the creek and see
[1:30:13] this cabin you hear somebody singing uh
[1:30:16] by the grace of God or something like
[1:30:18] that he says you know old brother Bill
[1:30:19] made it
[1:30:21] she'll be in one of those cabins down by
[1:30:23] the the River of Life that flows out of
[1:30:26] the throne amen would get to
[1:30:29] he says you'll know oh brother Bill made
[1:30:31] it praise the Lord so that Dwelling
[1:30:34] Place I'll have one of those Dwelling
[1:30:36] Places I
[1:30:37] Lord willing you'll have
[1:30:39] a mouth design and upon her assemblies a
[1:30:42] cloud and a smoke by day and The Shining
[1:30:45] of flaming fire by night for upon all
[1:30:47] the glory shall be a defense
[1:30:50] amen a defense from what I don't know
[1:30:53] all I know is that when a light shines
[1:30:56] it brings everything else into
[1:30:59] perspective
[1:31:00] amen you ever notice uh when when most
[1:31:04] of the time when armies strike even in
[1:31:06] the scripture when Army strike they
[1:31:08] strike at night and almost every time I
[1:31:11] remember the things that we've done good
[1:31:13] better and differentness as a nation
[1:31:15] it's always been at night
[1:31:17] it when
[1:31:19] uh Marines or SEALS or whatever go in to
[1:31:22] rescue a citizen or or to kill Bin Laden
[1:31:26] so it's always at night
[1:31:27] they do it at night because it's the
[1:31:29] it's the element of surprise because you
[1:31:32] you can't the illumination is you can't
[1:31:34] see see so the light the light is
[1:31:38] created as a defense because it because
[1:31:40] if anything wrong is happening it shows
[1:31:43] and then it exposes it it is exposed
[1:31:48] amen Saint John chapter 8.
[1:31:50] uh wait let me let's since we're Isaiah
[1:31:53] let's do this one first in Isaiah
[1:31:55] chapter 60.
[1:32:07] in Isaiah 60. uh let's see I believe
[1:32:10] it's starting with verse 19. the Sun
[1:32:15] the sun shall be no more thy light by
[1:32:19] day
[1:32:19] neither for brightness shall the moon
[1:32:22] give light unto thee but the Lord shall
[1:32:26] be unto thee an everlasting light amen
[1:32:29] and thy God thy glory amen praise the
[1:32:33] Lord
[1:32:34] thy son
[1:32:36] shall s-u-n shalt no more go down
[1:32:39] neither shall thy Moon withdraw itself
[1:32:42] for the Lord shall be thine Everlasting
[1:32:44] Light and the end of thy mourning shall
[1:32:47] be ended amen of the days of thy
[1:32:50] mourning shall be ended
[1:32:52] why because it's always life
[1:32:56] there won't be an existence of Darkness
[1:32:59] there won't be a need for Darkness again
[1:33:01] when there is a Perpetual continual
[1:33:04] light Darkness can't exist
[1:33:08] amen you ever notice
[1:33:11] light can exist where darkness is but
[1:33:13] Darkness can't exist where light is
[1:33:17] amen
[1:33:19] if light is here Darkness can't exist
[1:33:21] right but if darkness is here all you
[1:33:24] have to do is slip the light on and it
[1:33:25] scatters the darkness yes so light can
[1:33:27] come when there's darkness and Scatter
[1:33:29] the darkness but Darkness can't do that
[1:33:30] to the light right amen the holy way is
[1:33:34] for the is for the darkness to take hold
[1:33:37] is for the light to withdraw itself
[1:33:40] yeah which you see happening in the
[1:33:42] world today
[1:33:43] the light is withdrawing himself amen
[1:33:46] and soon the only light that is
[1:33:49] Illuminating in this Gentile world is
[1:33:51] the bride will be taken out of here the
[1:33:53] light will be gone
[1:33:55] all the light will be gone and as the
[1:33:57] light pulls and goes he's only only
[1:34:00] going to be dealing with his people the
[1:34:03] Jews we've talked about that a few weeks
[1:34:05] back a few months back amen he'll only
[1:34:07] be dealing with his people the Jews the
[1:34:09] rest of the world goes into chaos all
[1:34:11] the light is gone only way that Darkness
[1:34:14] can take over something is when light
[1:34:17] withdraws itself
[1:34:18] if light comes into Darkness Darkness
[1:34:21] has to flee amen
[1:34:23] praise the Lord and that's the way that
[1:34:26] that light
[1:34:28] brings itself
[1:34:30] exposes itself questions and answers
[1:34:33] 1964. on the top of Mount Zion will set
[1:34:36] the lamb and the city will uh will need
[1:34:39] no light we just read that for the lamb
[1:34:42] is the light thereof and above the lamb
[1:34:45] will be the father which is the logos
[1:34:47] God the great light the Eternal Light
[1:34:50] that'll shine just above the throne and
[1:34:54] Jesus will not be on his father's Throne
[1:34:56] he'll be on his throne father will hover
[1:34:59] over
[1:35:00] father and son will be one uh and while
[1:35:04] uh while they are yet speaking I'll
[1:35:06] answer see he's talking about us then
[1:35:08] and Jesus will commit a perfect
[1:35:11] uh perfect age
[1:35:13] a perfect Living God that he is redeemed
[1:35:17] and give over to the father is that
[1:35:19] right we'll turn to God the Father which
[1:35:22] is the spirit not a man Spirit but that
[1:35:26] life that he's talking about logos shiny
[1:35:29] amen Illuminating that world
[1:35:32] letting that light shine again remember
[1:35:35] what is that what is that logos that
[1:35:37] logos is the word of God it's God
[1:35:40] creating bringing forth coming out of
[1:35:43] word speech accounts saying amen that's
[1:35:47] what that logos is from God right amen
[1:35:51] it is it is God manifesting himself in
[1:35:55] that in in that in that way amen praise
[1:35:59] the Lord one more scripture uh I'm gonna
[1:36:01] read I had you going over Saint John

[1:36:33] darkness but shall have the light of
[1:36:36] life

[1:37:07] I I was used to the very varied weather
[1:37:11] but when you come to Tucson you live
[1:37:12] here long enough you kind of get
[1:37:14] accustomed to the Sun and you go
[1:37:16] somewhere and the sun's not hot you're
[1:37:18] like where did it go
[1:37:19] I
[1:37:21] we're just a little bit sometimes when
