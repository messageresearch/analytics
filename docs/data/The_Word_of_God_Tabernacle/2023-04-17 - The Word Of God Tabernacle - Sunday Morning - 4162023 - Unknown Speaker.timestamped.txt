[33:13] glad to be a part of that family amen
[33:15] amen praise the Lord God and I consider
[33:18] you a part of my family amen that's why
[33:20] sometimes we counted a privilege when
[33:24] the scripture says so but when we can
[33:26] come forward in front of everybody or we
[33:28] can ask to a text or a phone message or
[33:30] whatever to pray for one another amen
[33:33] because nobody can pray for you like a
[33:36] family member amen nobody can pray for
[33:39] you like a family member again whether
[33:41] it's real blood family or whether it's
[33:43] the family of Christ amen that's why we
[33:46] come forward sometimes and have hands
[33:48] laid on us in front of our family amen
[33:51] that everybody reach forth in faith and
[33:54] believe as a family for one another yes
[33:56] praise the Lord that's why it's so
[33:58] important to be a part of the family of
[34:00] God Amen thank you Jesus so glad to be a
[34:04] part of that family aren't you yeah amen
[34:06] thank you Lord does anyone have a
[34:08] testimony or something on your part real
[34:10] quick before we change some of the
[34:11] service
[34:14] I I didn't see it until a few minutes
[34:17] ago
[34:19] but there's a spirit of healing here
[34:22] this morning and it started with me
[34:24] having this song on my heart
[34:28] um
[34:29] I am the Lord I am you know the guy that
[34:32] healed me and I haven't lowered it your
[34:36] healer and I was looking up the lyrics
[34:39] this morning and
[34:41] um and then and it just uh
[34:44] and then I was sitting here and God
[34:47] showed me I've always wondered how
[34:49] Miracles would die even though I have
[34:51] your I've had miracles in my life and
[34:53] I'm sure we all have
[34:55] I always wondered how how did it happen
[34:58] and so I was I I was sitting here and
[35:02] all of a sudden the Lord said to me
[35:05] um that it's when he reminded me of the
[35:09] upper room that they went up there to be
[35:13] in
[35:14] to be imbued with power from on high
[35:18] and then he swung me over to how the
[35:22] power is in the blood and I remembered
[35:25] that the times that I've had Miracles
[35:27] it's been a while I've been waiting in
[35:30] the blood of Jesus Christ and let it
[35:32] happen
[35:43] and and verifies brother Graham called
[35:46] it the token that your sacrifice is
[35:49] received praise the Lord amen by his
[35:53] blood we believe it don't we yeah amen
[35:55] praise the Lord he didn't ask us to if
[35:57] we understood it he asked us if we
[35:59] believe it yeah
[36:01] praise the Lord they stand or repeat if
[36:03] we could amen I guess nobody else
[36:05] anybody else I mean to cut anybody off
[36:10] if not we'll turn in our Bibles to First
[36:12] Corinthians chapter 10 let me read a
[36:14] couple of verses of scripture here
[36:18] man
[36:21] I did not okay Sunday school went well I
[36:23] have not had a chance to talk to Craig
[36:25] about the the building behind us you had
[36:27] a facility behind us but I still intend
[36:30] to hopefully amen maybe you make it a
[36:32] little bit more private place for y'all
[36:35] to have your Sunday school and
[36:37] a couple other things we just see how
[36:39] the Lord does with that so
[36:43] First Corinthians chapter 10
[36:47] just read a couple of verses beginning
[36:48] with the 23rd verse First Corinthians 10
[36:51] 23 but before we do can we just bow our
[36:54] heads for another word of Prayer
[36:57] Lord Jesus we're so thankful again today
[36:59] of all the love and grace and mercy that
[37:02] you give Lord and for a wonderful week
[37:04] that you've blessed us with through this
[37:06] past week and keeping us healthy and
[37:08] strong for your service Lord and God
[37:10] when something may a little awry come
[37:12] you send out healing virtues for us Lord
[37:14] yes God you just move on our behalf in a
[37:17] special way and Lord there was those who
[37:19] weren't here with us last week that you
[37:21] touched and healed Lord and brought back
[37:23] with us to be here this week Lord and
[37:25] through the week and Lord we just know
[37:27] that your mindful of our every need Lord
[37:29] your mom to live even the very desires
[37:32] of our heart Lord and we love you and we
[37:34] thank you for it Lord we thank you for
[37:36] this place for these people Lord and
[37:38] those who may be streaming God may your
[37:40] Holy Spirit now flow through this place
[37:43] again with power and demonstration and
[37:45] let it be to us God that we feel and
[37:48] know that that power that strength that
[37:50] spirit is here with us to do the
[37:52] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[37:54] could ever ask or think knowing that you
[37:57] are our God lord we're in obedience to
[37:59] your word and trusting you for the
[38:01] desirable heart to come to the house of
[38:03] God this morning to sing these songs to
[38:06] enter into worship to praise you to
[38:08] exalt you to expect by that believing
[38:11] you inhabit the Praises of your people
[38:13] to be here with us Lord and Lord I pray
[38:15] that you do now God through the
[38:17] ministering of your word to take full
[38:19] control once again and speak to these
[38:22] lips Lord hear through our ears and let
[38:24] it be accomplished what you'd have it
[38:26] sent forth for today we rebuke every
[38:28] demonic spirit that would try to hurt
[38:30] hinder infiltrate this service in any
[38:32] way that you get the glory honor and
[38:35] praise for all that is said and done we
[38:37] commit it to you now Lord in the
[38:38] furthest of this gospel the name of the
[38:40] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
[38:45] First Corinthians chapter 10 verse 23
[38:48] we'll read two verses let you be seated
[38:51] Paul said all things are lawful for me
[38:54] but all things are not expedient all
[38:58] things are lawful for me but all things
[39:00] edify not let no man seek his own but
[39:04] every man another's wealth you could be
[39:07] seated if you like
[39:09] amen I'd like to give a testimony uh
[39:11] that came on my heart as I was praying
[39:13] there
[39:14] because God does know the desire of our
[39:17] heart yes
[39:19] and God knows that
[39:21] uh that there's uh now this may sound a
[39:24] little silly and superficial but you
[39:27] know how little silly superficial things
[39:29] sometimes mean something to us that uh
[39:32] that we like and sometimes when they're
[39:34] taken from us uh uh if we we wish we had
[39:38] it back well uh
[39:41] there's a coffee creamer that I like
[39:44] that coffee made makes and it's the
[39:48] flavor is creme brulee they quit
[39:50] carrying in Tucson
[39:52] two years ago hadn't been able to find
[39:55] it I've gone stretches without it
[39:57] everywhere I go I look for it uh when I
[40:00] was going to California I found it I had
[40:03] a nap at an Albertsons in California so
[40:06] I got some and brought it used it uh
[40:09] found some in Iowa bought it brought it
[40:11] used it gone and this last week
[40:15] there's a certain grocery store in the
[40:18] midwest called HyVee and they and I've
[40:20] seen those stores where they would carry
[40:22] it so I thought well I looked it up and
[40:26] sure enough they had it so this last
[40:28] time in Springfield uh Springfield
[40:29] Missouri I went up there uh close to a
[40:32] place we'd gone out to eat and I got one
[40:34] of the cards I said I'm gonna you know
[40:36] go to the grocery store for a little bit
[40:38] so I went and they didn't have it
[40:40] it was not on the Shelf there was no
[40:43] sticker for it even I thought all it
[40:45] just must be gone now probably even the
[40:48] stores the the last store that I knew
[40:50] that had it and I walked out of the
[40:52] store and the only other store uh that
[40:56] was like that one in that whole city is
[40:58] all the way on the other side of town
[41:00] and so I said well Lord I guess I walked
[41:04] out of the store I said Lord I guess
[41:05] that's just it I guess you know I won't
[41:07] have it but Lord you do know the desire
[41:08] of my heart and I didn't think anything
[41:10] else about it because I didn't plan to
[41:12] go all the way on the other side of town
[41:13] or anything like that on Friday now this
[41:17] is Tuesday or Wednesday on Friday we
[41:19] left a little bit early from the job
[41:20] because we were done and uh we went
[41:23] someplace and I got to talking to my
[41:26] friend from El Paso about it and uh he
[41:30] said I I said well there's another
[41:32] grocery store like that one it's all way
[41:34] on the other side of town he said let's
[41:36] go we got nothing else to do I said no I
[41:38] don't really you know I'm dragging over
[41:40] there I don't even know if they have it
[41:41] they may not have it either this store
[41:43] said they had it they didn't have it he
[41:44] said that's okay let's just go and I
[41:46] wasn't planning on go and he basically
[41:47] forced me to go I said okay well fine if
[41:51] you want to go we'll go so we went over
[41:53] there and got three bottles of it they
[41:56] had it
[41:57] so the Lord knows to desire of your
[42:00] heart yes again it may sound silly and
[42:03] superficial friend but God knows to
[42:05] desire of your heart amen whatever it
[42:08] might be God knows so uh we trust him in
[42:11] All Things praise the Lord amen so
[42:13] that's my little testimony amen amen it
[42:15] took a little longer than I expected but
[42:17] uh had to give you a little bit of
[42:19] background but the Lord Lord had it
[42:21] there just for me so praise the Lord
[42:23] amen now let's get back to the scripture
[42:25] it's a probably a premier scripture most
[42:28] of us have read it uh that he spoke to
[42:30] the Corinthian Church he said all things
[42:33] now look because I want to get to this
[42:35] the subject I want to talk about today
[42:36] is the edifying uh edifying now look
[42:39] Paul said here all things are lawful for
[42:43] me but all things are not expedient
[42:46] where all things are not profitable all
[42:49] things are not for my betterment he said
[42:52] I might be able to do all things or
[42:54] these things that he's talking about
[42:55] that's not sinful of course all these
[42:58] things they may be things that I can do
[43:00] but not all these things that I that I
[43:04] can or am allowed to do is profitable
[43:07] for me
[43:08] so then it becomes the question if it's
[43:11] not profitable for me then he goes on to
[43:14] say all things are lawful for me but all
[43:17] things edify not
[43:19] amen not all things are edifying right
[43:22] so then it then it becomes another
[43:24] question if it's I I can do all things
[43:27] but not all things are profitable I can
[43:31] do all things but not all things are
[43:33] edifying and if you look at the word
[43:35] edify we've talked about this before but
[43:37] the word edify is to build up
[43:41] uh is to increase is it it is to grow up
[43:45] it's like uh it's like uh a child that
[43:48] is born a child that is born uh as it
[43:51] life goes on and it learns things it
[43:54] begins to grow up it gets older it
[43:57] learns how to reach out it learns how to
[43:59] speak it his eyes clear up to it can see
[44:02] better and and all and as it grows up it
[44:04] continues to get older and older and and
[44:06] it's able to do things that a a regular
[44:09] adult human is well it's no less that
[44:11] with a Christian a Christian is born and
[44:14] has a new birth and when that is born
[44:16] then uh then it begins the process of
[44:20] building up and growing up and getting
[44:23] mature and becoming a mature Christian
[44:25] doesn't happen instantaneously it does
[44:29] just because you get the Holy Ghost
[44:30] doesn't mean you're instantaneously a
[44:32] mature Christian there's a growth that
[44:34] takes place a promoting and Paul's
[44:36] saying I can do all things but not all
[44:38] things are going to be profitable for me
[44:40] not all things are going to be edifying
[44:43] to me so then it becomes the question if
[44:46] it's going to be something that is
[44:48] coming to promote edifying is to promote
[44:51] our Christian virtues in life
[44:54] if it's not doing that then why do we do
[44:57] it
[44:58] amen Paul is Paul is identifying here
[45:02] the difference and say yes I can do this
[45:07] but is it profitable for me to do it
[45:10] yes I can do this but is it edifying to
[45:13] me does it does it Build Me Up does it
[45:16] does it increase me in the body of
[45:18] Christ that is does it increase my faith
[45:22] uh you know back 25 years ago or so in
[45:26] the 90s I believe it was
[45:28] you went everywhere especially in North
[45:30] Carolina I don't know about here we were
[45:31] living in North Carolina in the 90s and
[45:33] of course it's in the Bible Belt and and
[45:35] all and people are a little more forward
[45:37] with their Christianity and you could go
[45:39] everywhere and you could find hundreds
[45:42] of people at a Walmart with a bracelet
[45:44] on and this little this little rubber
[45:47] bracelet had wwjd on it yeah which meant
[45:50] what would Jesus do and you hardly ever
[45:53] see him I I don't see any anymore
[45:55] actually uh much less people actually
[45:58] very few and far between actually trying
[46:01] to act like and do what Christ would do
[46:03] and it become a slogan and unfortunately
[46:07] that's all it was for most people it was
[46:09] just a slogan that kind of raised up and
[46:12] died out as quickly as it raised up but
[46:14] the truth of that is is really a truth
[46:17] what is it that I do that that is
[46:21] edifying when you when you start making
[46:23] your decisions or when we make decisions
[46:26] in life and the things that we do in the
[46:28] places we go and
[46:30] the premier questions should be come to
[46:33] us is it edifying to me
[46:37] does this increase my faith does this
[46:39] increase my walk with the Lord does this
[46:42] bring me closer to God and whatever it
[46:44] is it can it can be almost anything in
[46:48] life to try to uh
[46:50] not impulse but there's always something
[46:53] behind what we do Lord is this something
[46:56] that's going to edify me amen is it
[46:59] something that's going to be profitable
[47:01] to me so the cry then becomes
[47:04] how is this going to make me better
[47:09] if I do this how is it going to make you
[47:11] better if I act like this if I listen to
[47:15] this if I go here if I do this if I
[47:19] watch this is it going to make me better
[47:22] amen because there's a lot of things we
[47:25] do in life that
[47:27] just basically it's like eating a rice
[47:29] cake it's tasteless it's useless it
[47:33] means and does nothing
[47:36] so there's a lot of things we can do
[47:38] that are like that but there's a lot of
[47:39] things that that that actually are uh
[47:43] that take our faith down
[47:46] amen there's things we can do that
[47:48] actually will draw us more away from God
[47:51] so then again the question that I'm
[47:53] asking this morning that I felt
[47:55] compelled to ask is
[47:57] when we enter these things in life and
[47:59] it's every day of end it is life
[48:02] it is life itself our minds are always
[48:04] moving our our uh uh you had to make a
[48:08] decision to come to church this morning
[48:09] and I pray and trust your decision was
[48:12] based on what brother Pat prayed amen we
[48:15] had a choice and we decided that we're
[48:17] going to go to church why did you decide
[48:20] to do that because you had a choice now
[48:23] there's obviously something the holy
[48:25] spirit that compels you but you still
[48:28] had a choice you still had a decision is
[48:31] this going to make me better is this
[48:33] going to bring me closer to God is this
[48:36] going to increase my faith is this going
[48:38] to make me more like the person that I
[48:41] really want to be
[48:42] see I'm afraid sometimes and I'm
[48:45] speaking in general not to me or us or
[48:48] our church but in general and and I'm
[48:49] sure the question does come up with with
[48:51] all of us at times because we all fight
[48:54] the same devil it's not can I get away
[48:58] with it uh not can I do it and get by
[49:02] with it uh it's the question has become
[49:06] not can I get away with it but is this
[49:08] helping me yeah is this edifying me is
[49:11] this going to build me up and increase
[49:13] me in the Lord and then it becomes a
[49:15] bigger a bigger decision because it not
[49:18] only because my main my main focus today
[49:22] now I'm going to get on the other part
[49:24] of edification uh not just for us but
[49:28] for those around us because in the next
[49:30] question then becomes how is this going
[49:33] to help those around me better yes
[49:35] but see the people around you can't get
[49:39] any better if you're not better
[49:42] it's like the Bible says you know uh uh
[49:45] charity begineth at home
[49:48] how can you help somebody else if you
[49:50] need help yourself right
[49:52] right you know I I could see somebody
[49:55] come through the door and and uh need
[49:59] ten dollars
[50:00] and I said I'm gonna give you ten
[50:02] dollars but you don't have ten dollars
[50:06] how can I give them how can I help them
[50:09] with 10 bucks if I don't even have ten
[50:12] dollars
[50:13] it doesn't work that way amen
[50:16] amen I believe if the Lord leads you
[50:18] obviously in the direction to do that it
[50:21] may be your last ten but you'll have it
[50:23] to give right but see the question is if
[50:27] I
[50:28] and my decisions are edifying to me and
[50:33] increasing my faith and building my life
[50:36] up to a place of the mature Christian
[50:39] that Jesus said be thou perfect
[50:42] man perfect is not sinless it is mature
[50:46] adult Christian
[50:48] if that's where Christ wants us to be
[50:50] then what if what we are doing should
[50:53] bring us continually to that place
[50:56] amen then
[50:58] those that are around us can be edified
[51:00] by us as well
[51:03] those around us can be blessed amen it's
[51:06] hard to it's it's hard to bless somebody
[51:09] when you're not blessed yourself it's
[51:11] hard to help and edify somebody increase
[51:13] somebody when you yourself need to be
[51:16] blessed increased uplifted so it becomes
[51:19] the question and is what I'm doing
[51:22] helping me become better
[51:26] not not uh can I get by with this not
[51:31] can I get away with this
[51:33] but it is what I'm thinking of what I'm
[51:36] doing is helping me become better right
[51:38] amen and by better again I mean more
[51:41] christ-like
[51:42] more of a Christian increasing my faith
[51:45] and helping me get closer to God
[51:48] that's what becomes a question amen and
[51:51] I hope I hope that question becomes
[51:53] Paramount because it should be an
[51:56] essential question to all of us I I
[51:58] don't think that Paul wrote that for no
[52:00] reason
[52:01] Paul told him I could because remember
[52:03] the Corinthian Church needed the most
[52:05] correction and I know that when Paul
[52:08] goes to the Corinthian Church he's
[52:10] probably found a mess and he's found
[52:13] people doing this going here and doing
[52:14] that believing this and believing that
[52:16] and basically saying you know all these
[52:18] things are lawful but not everything of
[52:20] that is going to profit me it's not
[52:23] going to help me it's not going to edify
[52:25] me so why do I want to concentrate
[52:28] myself on doing the things that are
[52:31] going to help me the things that are
[52:33] going to edify me the things that are
[52:35] going to get me closer to God yes amen
[52:38] those are the things I want to focus on
[52:40] the most in my life amen let's go over
[52:43] to Romans chapter 14.
[52:50] Romans chapter 14.
[52:55] verse 22.
[52:58] Romans 14 22.
[53:08] Frank yeah yeah is it coming through
[53:10] yes okay I can't tell it looks like it's
[53:12] pretty dim so I have to remember to
[53:14] change the batteries
[53:15] Romans Chapter 14 verse 22.
[53:19] listen now hast thou faith
[53:22] question now Paul's speaking to the
[53:24] Roman Church hast thou faith so
[53:27] that is an essential question that's a
[53:30] question every one of us must answer
[53:33] amen it's a question that we're faced
[53:35] with every day
[53:36] do we have faith hast thou Faith that's
[53:41] the question
[53:42] have it to thyself before God have that
[53:45] Faith to yourself before God remember
[53:49] as much as we try to help other people
[53:52] as much as we our minds are on other
[53:54] people and as much as we know the Bible
[53:57] says when you're uh when you're doing
[54:01] for others you're staring heaven in the
[54:02] face and when you're living your life
[54:04] for others you're staring even into the
[54:06] face absolutely
[54:07] but to be able to do that properly we
[54:10] have to be in the position that we
[54:12] should be with Christ first amen
[54:16] so so the question is have it to thyself
[54:18] before God Amen he hasn't included
[54:21] anybody he's saying you have faith have
[54:24] it to yourself before God happy is he
[54:27] that condemneth not himself in that
[54:30] thing which ye alloweth that condemneth
[54:33] now again that is that is scraping the
[54:37] line between
[54:40] an event that we do let's just say
[54:43] something we do of whether it is
[54:45] profitable and expedient or whether it's
[54:47] just something that's just a rice cake
[54:50] is it something that is really blessing
[54:52] us and helping us and edifying us
[54:55] or is it just a tasteless wasteless
[54:57] something
[54:58] amen so that condemn it now that
[55:01] condemneth is the same one that's over
[55:03] when we when we read the scripture about
[55:05] taking the Lord's Supper remember when
[55:08] he talks about Thou shalt not be
[55:10] condemned that means you won't be judged
[55:13] with the world hey man so when he says
[55:16] that happy is he that condemneth not
[55:18] judgeth not or be condemned not thyself
[55:24] that thing which he alloweth amen by
[55:27] faith you believe it
[55:30] I live my life by faith I walk by faith
[55:34] and what I do by faith I believe by
[55:37] faith and what I'm doing is edifying
[55:39] it's going to be a blessing to me not
[55:41] only just me but other people
[55:43] amen now and and that's not even that's
[55:48] not even the ourselves being blessed is
[55:51] not the focus
[55:52] you understand uh wait
[55:56] Our Lives aren't to be lived so that
[55:59] we're blessed and prosperous
[56:01] I'm sorry it doesn't work that way our
[56:03] lives are lived to help bless and
[56:05] prosper other people yes because if you
[56:08] live the self-denial life of Jesus
[56:10] Christ your life is going to be lived to
[56:13] help others not yourself right Jesus had
[56:16] no bed Everything Jesus really had was
[56:19] given to him he didn't have a bed he
[56:22] didn't have a place to see everything
[56:23] Jesus did was for other people
[56:26] he didn't do what for himself what was
[56:29] going to bless or or make his life
[56:33] better now and a lot of times when we do
[56:36] things that's going to help edify others
[56:39] it becomes a blessing to us but that's
[56:42] just the grace of God
[56:44] we don't do it because we know it's
[56:46] going to be there we do it because we
[56:48] know that God is in it
[56:50] I got
[56:52] I got a a a question
[56:55] by my barber a couple months back
[56:58] and we were talking about uh uh this
[57:03] nominal thing we were talking about Golf
[57:06] and John Yarborough was mid with me and
[57:09] me and John's like to play a lot of golf
[57:11] although I don't really play anymore but
[57:16] we were just talking about that and uh
[57:19] they there's another uh
[57:22] country Saudi Arabia that started in
[57:25] another golf league and they give these
[57:27] players to take them from this other
[57:29] Golf League they paid them millions and
[57:31] millions of dollars because they got
[57:32] billions and trillions of dollars the
[57:33] Saudi Arabia's got more money they could
[57:36] burn for the next hundred years and
[57:37] still have more money than either all of
[57:40] us put together the whole world uh and
[57:43] he just just throw money at them and
[57:45] throw money at them and and and I don't
[57:47] like that and I told him I said you know
[57:50] I just I just don't like it just this
[57:53] this one organization brought them in
[57:55] and built them up and gave them a name
[57:57] and now when they like that they leave
[57:59] and go someplace else for the money I
[58:01] just I just don't like that that's just
[58:03] personal thing I don't care it doesn't
[58:05] really matter but I don't like that kind
[58:07] of thing and and my barber asked me he
[58:10] says well didn't you just leave another
[58:12] job because you got more money at the
[58:14] other job I said no no no
[58:16] I said you got that all wrong I said yes
[58:18] I am getting paid more money at this new
[58:20] job but I didn't leave the other job to
[58:23] take that job because of that that's not
[58:26] the reason I did it I prayed about this
[58:28] I put this before the Lord and I asked
[58:31] God is this what you want me to do are
[58:33] you giving me this because this is what
[58:35] you want me to do right and I felt the
[58:37] Lord led me into the place that yes this
[58:40] is I'm giving this to you this is why I
[58:42] want you to go now
[58:44] that's the reason I took it amen just
[58:47] because God now has it been a blessing
[58:49] to me yes has anything blessed you to my
[58:52] family yes has it been a blessing to
[58:54] this church yes but I didn't do it for
[58:57] that reason I did it called Scott said
[58:59] so I did it because that's where I
[59:01] believe the Lord was leading me to amen
[59:03] and I testified to you the blessings
[59:05] that the Lord has gotten from that point
[59:08] till now amen so you understand
[59:12] it made the the moves we make we do to
[59:15] try to help and bless others now if
[59:18] those things if it blesses us of course
[59:21] that's just the grace of God that's just
[59:23] God's love for us amen when God does
[59:27] that for us but he does it because and
[59:29] then when everybody is sort of like it's
[59:32] sort of like a James's prayer when we're
[59:36] praying one for another then we're all
[59:37] being healed
[59:39] we're not worried about praying for
[59:40] ourselves or my foreign no more we're
[59:43] praying for everybody and if everybody's
[59:46] praying for everybody then everybody
[59:48] gets prayed for and everybody prays and
[59:51] we all get healed
[59:52] because it's a family thing
[59:55] it's not just me it's not just you it's
[59:57] it's every one of us is a part of this
[1:00:00] family and if we're all doing it
[1:00:02] together then everyone gets blessed
[1:00:05] when it's working right when the family
[1:00:07] of God is working right everybody is
[1:00:11] blessed and everybody is want for
[1:00:13] nothing and everything is is working
[1:00:16] towards God's Good Will amen that's the
[1:00:18] way it's supposed to be yeah
[1:00:19] unfortunately we had the hiccups of
[1:00:21] living in Satan's Eden and everything
[1:00:23] that goes on with that but you
[1:00:25] understand what I'm saying see it's a
[1:00:27] blessing to me it's a blessing to you
[1:00:29] but I live my life I try to be a
[1:00:32] blessing to others amen not just to
[1:00:35] myself but to others so that others
[1:00:38] might get to know what
[1:00:40] um uh what what that blessing is now
[1:00:42] look that faith
[1:00:44] have faith happiest he that could never
[1:00:47] thought himself in that thing which he
[1:00:48] alloweth and he that doubt is amen is
[1:00:53] damned if he eat because he eateth not a
[1:00:55] faith for whatsoever is not a faith is
[1:00:58] of sin that's when you approach
[1:01:00] something and you're like
[1:01:02] should I do this could I get could I get
[1:01:05] away with doing this could I
[1:01:08] well the Lord just just look the other
[1:01:11] way while I go over here well well oh
[1:01:15] God will forgive surely God will forgive
[1:01:16] me you know if I if I do this and but
[1:01:19] see what you're doing is you're entering
[1:01:21] into something without the faith of God
[1:01:24] behind it and what did and what did Paul
[1:01:27] say he that doubted this damned if he
[1:01:29] doesn't amen if he partakes of it amen
[1:01:32] and if that uh and if that's where God's
[1:01:36] moving then
[1:01:38] it becomes a damnation to us it becomes
[1:01:41] a condemnation to us it becomes
[1:01:44] something of judgment to us and what
[1:01:46] that does then then it condemns your
[1:01:48] heart first John
[1:01:51] third verse third chapter I think it is
[1:01:53] if my heart condemned me not then I have
[1:01:55] confidence towards God Amen well this is
[1:01:57] talking about the opposite of that then
[1:02:00] your heart becomes condemned and then
[1:02:01] you're judged already
[1:02:03] you're guilty and then what does that do
[1:02:06] that brings you down
[1:02:08] that doesn't edify that doesn't increase
[1:02:11] you that doesn't profit you in the Lord
[1:02:13] it doesn't obviously it couldn't bring
[1:02:15] you closer to God it doesn't help your
[1:02:18] faith right so those are the things that
[1:02:21] he's telling that we stay away from
[1:02:24] and that we when we do things we do it
[1:02:26] with confidence to know that this would
[1:02:29] be pleasing to the Lord Lord let me be
[1:02:31] pleasing to you whatever I pursue let me
[1:02:34] be pleasing to you
[1:02:36] and what I do amen now what that does
[1:02:39] let's go over to the first verse still
[1:02:42] in uh still in Romans 14.
[1:02:46] but I want to read the verse now or the
[1:02:48] chapter
[1:02:50] because once we've once we've
[1:02:53] established in our own lives
[1:02:56] that our motives our reasonings our
[1:02:59] objectives our
[1:03:01] for
[1:03:03] edifying of the body of Christ
[1:03:06] and I begin with me
[1:03:09] so that what I do is edify what I do is
[1:03:13] helping me get closer to God is helping
[1:03:16] me get greater faith in the Lord amen so
[1:03:20] then if that's the case
[1:03:22] then other people around me can be
[1:03:25] blessed and and I say me because of me
[1:03:28] it's just you us
[1:03:30] individuals when when you do that then
[1:03:34] you get close to the Lord and when
[1:03:35] you're close to the Lord and your faith
[1:03:37] is Sky High you can be a help to other
[1:03:39] people
[1:03:39] you can be a blessing to other people
[1:03:41] maybe they need a little encouragement
[1:03:43] maybe they need a little lifting up
[1:03:45] maybe they need a little boost maybe
[1:03:47] God's putting you in their path to bring
[1:03:49] them to that point because you and what
[1:03:52] you've done and with the word that's
[1:03:54] brought you to that place now we help
[1:03:57] others that are around us to bring them
[1:03:59] to that place
[1:04:00] amen
[1:04:02] look uh Romans 14 1.
[1:04:05] him that is weak
[1:04:08] in the faith receive you
[1:04:11] receive ye if they're weak in the faith
[1:04:13] receive them but not too doubtful
[1:04:15] disputations
[1:04:18] it's like people say uh
[1:04:22] it's like Jesus with dirty feet
[1:04:24] amen Jesus with dirty feet was received
[1:04:27] with doubtful disputations why because
[1:04:29] he was invited
[1:04:31] he actually had a messenger with a
[1:04:35] specific Invitational message for Jesus
[1:04:38] to come to this party
[1:04:40] but when he got to the party they
[1:04:42] received him you understand that's the
[1:04:44] part they received him but they received
[1:04:47] him to doubtful disputations why because
[1:04:50] when he got there they completely
[1:04:52] ignored him
[1:04:54] his feet wasn't washed she wasn't
[1:04:56] anointed it was no no welcome about that
[1:04:59] made Jesus feel welcome into that place
[1:05:01] and he just sat over in the corner Jesus
[1:05:04] with dirty
[1:05:05] because he was received with doubtful
[1:05:08] disputation people said oh yeah you're
[1:05:10] welcome and then
[1:05:12] no invitation no no no handshake no uh
[1:05:17] love your brother and then it becomes
[1:05:19] then if it comes to the place well that
[1:05:21] per they're not gonna last anyway are
[1:05:24] are they're this or that or yeah
[1:05:26] everybody it's all kinds of things it
[1:05:29] comes and brings and that kind of doubt
[1:05:30] it's the same thing in the world today
[1:05:32] look at the world today what is it that
[1:05:35] that I I just heard and and I don't they
[1:05:38] may boot us off of YouTube for this but
[1:05:40] I just heard that there that the that
[1:05:43] the government has started to crack down
[1:05:44] on the Catholic Church
[1:05:46] for being radicals
[1:05:48] now friend if they're if the
[1:05:51] government's cracking down on Catholic
[1:05:52] Church for being radical what do you
[1:05:54] think about us right if they call them
[1:05:57] radicals and cracking down on them now
[1:05:59] now see what they do is they're saying
[1:06:02] oh we're not coming against the Catholic
[1:06:04] Church we're coming against the radicals
[1:06:07] that's where they get away with it it's
[1:06:10] the radicals that's within the church or
[1:06:13] the radicals that's here there you know
[1:06:15] that people do the same thing in the
[1:06:16] message
[1:06:18] they receive you with doubtful oh hi
[1:06:20] brother and then they but but because
[1:06:22] you don't believe the way they believe
[1:06:23] you're not a brother you're not going to
[1:06:25] heaven and they'll receive you but to
[1:06:27] doubtful disputations
[1:06:29] amen they receive it they say oh what
[1:06:32] they do is well
[1:06:34] in their minds they they don't consider
[1:06:36] you a brother
[1:06:38] amen
[1:06:39] and when they look and say a brother
[1:06:41] doesn't persecute a brother and and
[1:06:43] people say well that that's not a
[1:06:45] brother they're not my brother they
[1:06:46] don't believe the way I do they don't
[1:06:48] think about it the way I do they don't
[1:06:49] see this message or this this quote or
[1:06:51] or this message or something the way I
[1:06:54] see it and I don't so they're they're
[1:06:55] not even a brother and then when you do
[1:06:57] that then you've isolated that person
[1:06:59] off and you've made them less than what
[1:07:01] they really are and what they should be
[1:07:03] and what they should be to you friends
[1:07:06] we should never do that I don't care
[1:07:08] where they go to church I don't care
[1:07:09] what their belief is if they're a
[1:07:11] brother their brother you treat them as
[1:07:13] such amen amen that's the way it should
[1:07:15] be now there's a lot of things I see or
[1:07:18] hear don't agree with but that doesn't
[1:07:21] change it at all it's not up to me to
[1:07:23] determine that point it's up to God
[1:07:26] but see it's a spirit of the world that
[1:07:28] does it they taken their identity it's
[1:07:31] even like uh again they may put us off
[1:07:34] YouTube for this but it's it's like the
[1:07:36] president will come and say well I'm not
[1:07:38] talking about the Republicans I'm just
[1:07:40] talking about the radicals
[1:07:43] it's the same spirit and now they're
[1:07:46] clamping down saying well we're not
[1:07:47] coming against the Catholic Church of
[1:07:48] course the president himself claims to
[1:07:50] be a Catholic I'm coming against the
[1:07:52] radicals and see they and then what they
[1:07:55] do is they take and separate you out and
[1:07:57] then they and then you become you become
[1:08:00] a Target that makes it okay for them to
[1:08:04] attack you
[1:08:05] amen and the same thing happens to the
[1:08:08] Same Spirit Same Spirit of the world
[1:08:09] same spirits in the church amen they
[1:08:12] separate you out that it makes it okay
[1:08:14] that you become a Target someone to be
[1:08:17] attacked someone to be talked about or
[1:08:18] put down or instead of edifying and
[1:08:21] bringing up they receive you but to
[1:08:24] doubtful disputations amen oh hey
[1:08:27] brother well he doesn't believe the way
[1:08:29] we do so you know I'm just it's going
[1:08:32] through the motions
[1:08:34] you know just look me in the eye be a be
[1:08:36] a man
[1:08:38] if if you don't consider me a brother
[1:08:40] don't call me one
[1:08:42] amen I'll call your brother because I
[1:08:44] believe then and Believe by God that you
[1:08:46] are if God brings a separation and
[1:08:48] there's a difference there then that's
[1:08:49] up to him but to me you're my brother
[1:08:52] amen but if you don't think I don't tell
[1:08:55] me so amen I uh
[1:08:58] trust me my back is full of enough scars
[1:09:01] that one more is not going to make that
[1:09:03] big a difference
[1:09:04] I mean I've had enough knives stabbed in
[1:09:06] my back that all the scars that are
[1:09:08] there now one more is not going to make
[1:09:10] that big a difference
[1:09:11] amen just tell me the truth
[1:09:13] but that's just the thing
[1:09:15] doubtful disputations you understand
[1:09:18] now
[1:09:20] receive but don't receive to dealt with
[1:09:22] disputation for one believeth that he
[1:09:25] may eat all things another who is weak
[1:09:28] eateth herbs let not him that eateth
[1:09:31] despise him that Edith not and let him
[1:09:34] not and let not him which eateth not
[1:09:37] judge him that eateth for God hath
[1:09:39] received him
[1:09:40] who art thou that judges another man's
[1:09:44] servant to his own Master Amen to God he
[1:09:48] standeth or Fallen yea he shall be
[1:09:51] holding up for God is able to make him
[1:09:54] stand one man esteemeth one day above
[1:09:57] another another esteemeth every day
[1:10:00] alike let every man be fully persuaded
[1:10:03] in his own mind which is what we began
[1:10:06] this whole thing with
[1:10:07] amen when you do what you know is right
[1:10:11] in the eyes of God you have faith in it
[1:10:13] you stand on it don't do it and say oh
[1:10:16] you know
[1:10:17] I I shouldn't do this
[1:10:21] that's that every man be fully persuaded
[1:10:24] in his own mind he that regardeth the
[1:10:27] day regardeth it unto the Lord and He
[1:10:29] that regardeth not the day to the Lord
[1:10:32] he doth not regard it he said eateth eat
[1:10:35] it to the Lord for he giveth God thanks
[1:10:37] and he eateth not uh to the Lord he
[1:10:40] eateth not and giveth God things
[1:10:43] for none of us liveth to himself and no
[1:10:46] man dieth in himself for whether we live
[1:10:49] we live unto the Lord whether we die we
[1:10:52] die unto the Lord whether we live
[1:10:54] therefore die we are the Lord amen
[1:10:56] that's the bottom line
[1:10:58] amen no doubt for disputations whether
[1:11:02] we live whether we die we are the Lords
[1:11:04] whether you see it this way and I see it
[1:11:06] that way we are the Lords you are my
[1:11:08] brother because we are the Lords amen
[1:11:10] that that that is the discussion it
[1:11:14] should anyway but you notice that this
[1:11:17] that evil spirit gets in there that
[1:11:19] demonic spirit that just tries to twist
[1:11:21] it over amen we just got to be on we've
[1:11:24] got to be on our guards continuously
[1:11:26] Lord is this going to edify
[1:11:29] is this going to bless is this going to
[1:11:32] be profitable Lord amen
[1:11:35] and I believe we're all mature enough in
[1:11:36] the Lord in the scripture that we would
[1:11:38] know that really even out having to ask
[1:11:41] the question
[1:11:42] for to this end Christ both died and
[1:11:44] Rose and revived that he might be the
[1:11:47] Lord both of the dead and living
[1:11:49] but why Dost thou judge thy brother or
[1:11:53] why Dost thou set not thy brother for we
[1:11:56] shall stand before the Judgment seat of
[1:11:59] Christ and again people do it because
[1:12:00] they don't truly believe you're their
[1:12:02] brother or sister whatever it is
[1:12:05] they don't actually in their heart
[1:12:07] believe that you're their brother or
[1:12:09] sister
[1:12:09] that that's where that's where the Mind
[1:12:12] Falls you look at this saying why do you
[1:12:15] do your brother this way why do you
[1:12:16] believe your brothers why do you have
[1:12:17] anger against your brothers because they
[1:12:19] don't believe you are brothers why do
[1:12:21] you take your brother to court because
[1:12:22] they don't believe you're a brother
[1:12:25] that becomes the bottom line of us or a
[1:12:27] sister for it is written
[1:12:30] as I live saith the Lord every knee
[1:12:32] shall bow to me and every tongue shall
[1:12:34] confess to God
[1:12:36] so then every one of us shall give
[1:12:38] account to himself of himself to God
[1:12:41] let us not therefore judge one another
[1:12:44] anymore but judge this rather that no
[1:12:46] man put a stumbling block here we go now
[1:12:49] we're getting to another portion of
[1:12:51] edification
[1:12:53] that no man put a stumbling block or an
[1:12:55] occasion to fall in his brother's way
[1:12:59] I know and am persuaded by the Lord
[1:13:01] Jesus that there is nothing unclean of
[1:13:04] itself but but to him that esteemeth
[1:13:08] anything to be unclean to him to him it
[1:13:12] is unclean
[1:13:13] and if it becomes a stumbling block for
[1:13:16] us to do that that they consider unclean
[1:13:19] in front of them or on purpose
[1:13:22] it's unclean look
[1:13:25] think about it this way
[1:13:28] and unfortunately it becomes a very
[1:13:30] arrogant spirit
[1:13:32] to think well this this brother this
[1:13:34] sister doesn't believe this but I'm
[1:13:36] gonna do it anyhow
[1:13:38] because bless the Lord I don't think
[1:13:40] there's anything wrong with it so I'm
[1:13:41] going to do it right in front of him and
[1:13:43] teach them a lesson that's not what the
[1:13:45] scripture says right amen
[1:13:48] if that person believes that any estate
[1:13:50] is going to send you to hell you should
[1:13:52] not eat a steak in front of that person
[1:13:54] right that's what the scripture says I'm
[1:13:57] going to do it never regardless I don't
[1:13:59] care what they think or believe
[1:14:01] see now you're now you're getting to
[1:14:04] those places that are very unedifying
[1:14:06] you're not going to help that person
[1:14:08] that way you're not going to be again
[1:14:10] what did we say last week Paul said we
[1:14:13] forget Paul said I I try he says I
[1:14:16] become all things to all men that I
[1:14:18] might win some
[1:14:19] amen what do I try to do become and move
[1:14:22] into that
[1:14:24] see that's just arrogance that wants to
[1:14:26] that wants to have a fight
[1:14:28] amen I I had this discussion one time
[1:14:31] with a with another younger brother it
[1:14:33] just getting out in the ministry and all
[1:14:35] and and I was and they were just against
[1:14:39] me unless they killed it they were just
[1:14:42] against me no meat unless it was an
[1:14:45] animal he killed out in the forest no
[1:14:46] means and I'm like well that's funny
[1:14:48] because the scripture says not to
[1:14:51] abstain from means
[1:14:54] that's what it says I think it's in
[1:14:56] Timothy not to abstain from means he
[1:14:59] said oh that's that that was back then
[1:15:01] he said it's okay if you kill it or
[1:15:03] something and see and so I got
[1:15:05] I I saw the rub there and the contention
[1:15:09] and I ended the conversation and I said
[1:15:12] because we weren't eating anything it
[1:15:14] wasn't the meal we were eating I said
[1:15:16] brother if that's the way you believe it
[1:15:19] and I pray that God bless you and I I'm
[1:15:21] probably paraphrasing I didn't say it
[1:15:22] exactly like this maybe but I said God
[1:15:25] bless you and what you believe and what
[1:15:26] you see there but I would hope and trust
[1:15:29] you don't condemn me for what I see of
[1:15:31] what I believe right
[1:15:33] I didn't get an amen from him but that's
[1:15:36] just the way it is amen it reminds me of
[1:15:39] getting on the airplane now you get on
[1:15:41] an airplane now uh Julie can probably
[1:15:43] tell you this because she's just on one
[1:15:45] but when you get on an airplane now
[1:15:47] every single flight I've taken in the
[1:15:50] past eight months every time every
[1:15:51] Airline they come on and say we no
[1:15:53] longer require the wearing of masks on
[1:15:56] our flights but if you choose to wear
[1:15:59] one please don't condemn or if you
[1:16:01] choose not to wear one please don't
[1:16:03] condemn those that choose to or not to
[1:16:05] in so many words what are they trying to
[1:16:07] get people to do just understand if this
[1:16:10] person wears a mask let her wear a mask
[1:16:12] I'm not hurting anything
[1:16:13] these people if they feel like they're
[1:16:15] okay not wearing a mask and don't
[1:16:17] condemn them for not wearing a mask it's
[1:16:19] their belief it's what they feel they're
[1:16:20] okay doing that and just get along
[1:16:23] that's kind of what they're trying to do
[1:16:25] to keep from people fighting on the
[1:16:27] airplanes but just get along you know
[1:16:30] and and you try to Defuse The Situation
[1:16:33] say brother I I respect what you believe
[1:16:35] and if you won't believe that way and
[1:16:38] you live that way then God bless you in
[1:16:39] that amen but again don't condemn me if
[1:16:43] I want to go have a rib eye next week
[1:16:45] don't don't tell me I'm going to hell or
[1:16:48] that my health has gone down the drain
[1:16:50] or whatever and and if it is then that's
[1:16:53] my choice but don't condemn me for it
[1:16:55] but
[1:16:57] I I wouldn't do something to throw right
[1:16:59] in that brother's face
[1:17:00] you understand I would I wouldn't do
[1:17:02] something to deliberately provoke that
[1:17:04] person because that's not edifying
[1:17:07] that's not profitable it's not going to
[1:17:08] help him and it's definitely not going
[1:17:10] to help me it's certainly not going to
[1:17:12] help my relationship with him and if we
[1:17:13] are both brothers together it's
[1:17:15] definitely not going to help the kingdom
[1:17:17] of God anymore right so what is it just
[1:17:20] becomes arrogance at that point
[1:17:22] my way is right your way is wrong that's
[1:17:25] the way I see it if you don't listen to
[1:17:27] me then you just you don't believe it
[1:17:28] and just go on and be what you are
[1:17:32] whatever it is amen because my Way's the
[1:17:35] right way
[1:17:38] that's okay and it might be but the
[1:17:41] Arrogant attitude and spirit so many
[1:17:43] times it turns people off
[1:17:45] it makes people not want to follow what
[1:17:49] you believe
[1:17:50] just because of your attitude about it
[1:17:53] amen amen anyway let's move on
[1:17:58] amen
[1:18:00] so then every 12th verse so then every
[1:18:03] one of us shall give an account to
[1:18:05] himself of God let us not therefore
[1:18:08] judge one another anymore but judge this
[1:18:10] rather that no man put a stumbling block
[1:18:12] on occasion to fall in his brother's way
[1:18:15] don't put that stumbling block amen amen
[1:18:18] I know and am persuaded by the Lord
[1:18:20] Jesus there is nothing unclean of itself
[1:18:22] but to him that esteemeth anything to be
[1:18:25] unclean to him it is unclean amen
[1:18:28] and even though I might have a
[1:18:30] completely contrary point of view I
[1:18:33] respect him for his point of view amen
[1:18:37] But If thy Brothers
[1:18:40] Lord help me things just keep coming to
[1:18:41] my mind
[1:18:43] it's like remember the story when
[1:18:45] brother when brother Brandon was with
[1:18:46] these heathens
[1:18:48] and they got to this certain place
[1:18:49] certain time and I forget a lot of the
[1:18:51] details but they got off and they
[1:18:52] started they knelt down beside a tree or
[1:18:54] something and they started praying to
[1:18:56] their God and brother Brandon got off
[1:18:57] and he started praying with them
[1:18:59] they think brother Adam what are you
[1:19:00] doing he said I'm respecting their
[1:19:02] belief
[1:19:04] I'm respecting dear God how about ever
[1:19:07] get them to listen to me if I don't
[1:19:09] respect what they believe
[1:19:11] amen if I don't respect what they
[1:19:14] believe they're not going to respect
[1:19:15] what I believe now what they believe may
[1:19:17] be wrong and it may send them to hell
[1:19:19] but me pounding them into the ground
[1:19:21] like a railroad Spike's not going to
[1:19:22] help anything
[1:19:24] amen
[1:19:26] and brother Randolph and prayed with
[1:19:28] them now he wasn't praying to the son
[1:19:30] God or whatever God they were praying to
[1:19:32] he's praying to his God but he was
[1:19:34] showing respect and dignity of the
[1:19:36] humanity of of a person with a soul amen
[1:19:40] that's that that's the best way to try
[1:19:42] to win somebody see
[1:19:44] But If thy brother be greed with thy me
[1:19:48] now walk us thou not charitably destroy
[1:19:52] not him with thy need for whom Christ
[1:19:54] died Amen Let not then your good be evil
[1:19:58] spoken of you might be doing exactly the
[1:20:01] right thing it might be 100 scripture it
[1:20:03] might be God's edifying and blessing to
[1:20:06] you but when it becomes unedifying to
[1:20:08] somebody else then it becomes a disaster
[1:20:12] it becomes unedifying because of that uh
[1:20:16] to someone else amen deliberate don't
[1:20:19] let your good be evil spoken of for the
[1:20:22] kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but
[1:20:24] righteousness and peace joy in the Holy
[1:20:27] Ghost for he that is of these things
[1:20:29] serveth Christ uh things serveth Christ
[1:20:31] is acceptable to God and approved of men
[1:20:34] let us therefore follow after the things
[1:20:37] which make for peace and things
[1:20:39] wherewith one may edify another follow
[1:20:43] those things which may edify another
[1:20:48] let us therefore follow after the things
[1:20:50] which make for peace
[1:20:53] and things wherewith one may edify
[1:20:56] another
[1:20:58] Wise It's just self-indulgent
[1:21:01] self-serving arrogance
[1:21:04] even if you are right
[1:21:07] amen you can be very arrogant in your
[1:21:10] Pious attitude right
[1:21:12] right in it and hurtful
[1:21:16] for me destroying not the work of God
[1:21:19] all things indeed are pure but it is
[1:21:21] evil for the man who eat it with offense
[1:21:25] it is good neither to eat flesh nor to
[1:21:28] drink wine nor anything whereby thy
[1:21:31] brother stumbleth or is offended or is
[1:21:33] made weep
[1:21:35] has thou faith we got to that just a
[1:21:37] minute have it did I sell before God
[1:21:39] happy is he that condemneth not himself
[1:21:41] the thing which ye alloweth he that
[1:21:44] doubteth is damned if he eat because he
[1:21:46] is not by faith of faith for whatsoever
[1:21:49] is not of faith is sin amen
[1:21:54] 50 first verse 1. we uh we then
[1:21:58] that are strong
[1:22:01] ought to Bear the infirmities of the
[1:22:03] weak and not not to please ourselves
[1:22:09] and then what would we say earlier
[1:22:11] how did Christ live his life Christ
[1:22:14] didn't live his life to be pleasing to
[1:22:15] himself he lived it to be pleasing to
[1:22:17] others
[1:22:19] let every one of us please his neighbor
[1:22:22] for his good edification good to
[1:22:25] edification
[1:22:27] for even Christ please not himself
[1:22:31] but as it is written the reproaches of
[1:22:34] them that reproached thee fell on me
[1:22:37] fell on him for what for whatsoever
[1:22:40] things were written before time were
[1:22:42] written for our learning that we that we
[1:22:46] through patience and comfort of the
[1:22:48] scriptures might have hope
[1:22:50] that hope comes through Christ Jesus
[1:22:54] that hope of faith in what he did for us
[1:22:59] not for himself but for us
[1:23:02] became becomes a blessing then it
[1:23:06] becomes edifying then it is building it
[1:23:10] is increasing it isn't helping us
[1:23:14] doesn't it
[1:23:16] it goes back to that it's more blessed
[1:23:19] to give than receive
[1:23:21] amen and I think we as Christians we can
[1:23:24] all say that I know the world may not
[1:23:26] say that but it's true amen
[1:23:30] I I get more out of something that I
[1:23:34] give somebody than somebody's give to me
[1:23:37] it might have been a blessing to me it
[1:23:39] might have been a help to me what they
[1:23:41] gave me but the joy and the the the the
[1:23:44] law the happiness that I get
[1:23:47] far exceeds giving somebody something
[1:23:50] than receiving it
[1:23:52] Amen to help that person to increase
[1:23:54] that person so that person would be
[1:23:56] built up amen
[1:23:58] be increased
[1:24:02] look we are all contractors
[1:24:06] we are all contractors we are all
[1:24:09] Builders every one of us on a job we
[1:24:12] call them the GM General Manager we're
[1:24:15] all general managers we're all Builders
[1:24:17] we're all general manager contractors
[1:24:18] because we're in the business of being
[1:24:20] edified
[1:24:21] a building
[1:24:23] not just ourselves building but helping
[1:24:25] others that all again
[1:24:28] if we're helping others being built we
[1:24:31] all get built then you don't really even
[1:24:33] have to worry about yourself
[1:24:35] amen the lord caught obviously lead us
[1:24:38] and bring us to places that's blessings
[1:24:41] and helpful to us but the whole point is
[1:24:43] to be there for other people yes just to
[1:24:46] be a blessing and to help to other
[1:24:47] people so that they get built up we're
[1:24:49] all Builders amen we are to we are to
[1:24:53] build amen Ephesians chapter four
[1:24:56] I got two more scriptures I'm on clothes
[1:24:58] Ephesians 4 11.
[1:25:02] this getting to the ministry now
[1:25:05] he gave some Apostles some prophets some
[1:25:08] evangelists some pastors and teachers
[1:25:10] for the perfecting of the Saints again
[1:25:12] that perfecting is still mature growing
[1:25:15] up
[1:25:16] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:25:19] the ministry whichever Ministry it is
[1:25:21] whether it's an apostle or a pastor or
[1:25:23] evangelist or a teacher whatever it is
[1:25:25] for that work for the edifying of the
[1:25:29] body of Christ now that's what a
[1:25:31] Ministry a true God called Ministry is
[1:25:35] supposed to do is supposed to edify the
[1:25:37] people it's supposed to help increase
[1:25:40] the people to build them up it never
[1:25:44] should be a a time where we come in and
[1:25:48] we're just lead the way we came in
[1:25:51] it's just nothing happened nothing's
[1:25:53] going on nothing said nothing done
[1:25:55] there should always be an edification in
[1:25:58] the word of God is being being preached
[1:26:01] if the pure unadulterated word of God is
[1:26:04] being ministered and brought to a place
[1:26:07] of edification not condescendingly I've
[1:26:10] heard it so many times that people lay
[1:26:13] the hammer down in the congregation and
[1:26:14] they come down so condescendingly it's
[1:26:17] like I'm I have ascended the the the
[1:26:20] Great Heights of the of the master gods
[1:26:24] and I'm looking down upon you people and
[1:26:27] I'm trying to tell you how to do it
[1:26:29] right
[1:26:30] that doesn't work it's not the way it's
[1:26:33] supposed to be and it's not true
[1:26:36] no man no Minister has got to that place
[1:26:39] but it's the it's the way it comes
[1:26:41] across and the way it's acted I want to
[1:26:44] understand see friends we're all
[1:26:45] together in this yes the only thing that
[1:26:48] differentiates is just the gift of God
[1:26:50] to bring a Ministry and the whole point
[1:26:53] is to edify
[1:26:55] is it to edify just you no it's both
[1:26:58] edifies me too
[1:27:01] in fact I get a double portion because
[1:27:03] it edified me in my office yesterday and
[1:27:06] now today
[1:27:07] because the Lord then unfolds and
[1:27:09] reveals in you and it becomes like okay
[1:27:11] Lord
[1:27:13] I made sure
[1:27:15] yeah what I do and Lord help me to be
[1:27:18] edifying I want I want it to
[1:27:22] make me better
[1:27:23] I don't I don't I might but I try not
[1:27:27] hope I never do anything that's going to
[1:27:29] make me worse yes I'm gonna try to do
[1:27:32] everything that I do
[1:27:34] that would make me better before the
[1:27:36] Lord to make me better before you
[1:27:40] to listen to God more to let him speak
[1:27:44] so that what he speaks can edify you
[1:27:48] and we all are edified and blessed
[1:27:50] because of it because that's what the
[1:27:52] ministry is to do is to edify it's not
[1:27:55] to condescend is to build up is to
[1:27:59] that's a part of the work of the
[1:28:01] ministry of God
[1:28:02] amen is to edify not to build himself up
[1:28:05] not to make himself a kingdom of some
[1:28:08] kind not to show off some kind of gift
[1:28:10] or some kind of thing you know how even
[1:28:12] though the things that happen at brother
[1:28:14] Brandon's Ministry if you ever look and
[1:28:16] hear about the spirit of that Ministry
[1:28:19] brother Branham is always he never
[1:28:22] builds himself up to the place of this
[1:28:24] great miracle healer he always tries to
[1:28:27] downplay that to the point to understand
[1:28:28] I'm just standing here as a man just
[1:28:31] like you with a knot with a gift that
[1:28:33] God has give not of my own
[1:28:36] to try to help other people that's the
[1:28:38] only reason yes in fact he said he told
[1:28:41] Billy Paul and and I believe it I can't
[1:28:43] remember if he said it on tape he said
[1:28:45] the gift's not for me is for you yeah
[1:28:48] and to understand that and to bring it
[1:28:50] to that point instead of trying to and
[1:28:52] and of a man that could have built a
[1:28:55] kingdom to himself
[1:28:57] a man that could have been a
[1:28:59] multi-millionaire and had anything he
[1:29:01] wanted to he could have had the biggest
[1:29:03] house he could have had the fanciest car
[1:29:06] he could have had the biggest bank
[1:29:07] account but that wasn't what he was here
[1:29:09] for right right it was for you me yeah
[1:29:14] it was for the people yes amen not for
[1:29:17] himself
[1:29:18] nor did he build himself up to that
[1:29:21] place for that to happen that way
[1:29:24] amen he turned down he turned down men
[1:29:27] that wanted to give him millions of
[1:29:29] dollars
[1:29:30] yes he did amen
[1:29:32] because it wasn't about him it wasn't
[1:29:35] about him building a kingdom or him
[1:29:37] using some gift to elevate himself to a
[1:29:40] position he
[1:29:42] uh didn't want or belong even
[1:29:45] amen just one of the people yes when I

[1:39:26] little bit on Craig and if uh things
[1:39:28] work out to get a place behind us here
[1:39:31] I'd like to have another meal together
[1:39:34] whatever that entails whatever that may
[1:39:36] look like
[1:39:38] whether it's at a house or behind us or
[1:39:41] a restaurant or something uh
[1:39:45] I like to do it like on Mother's Day
[1:39:47] next month which is in May but if it's
[1:39:51] at a restaurant that's probably going to
[1:39:53] be pretty close to impossible to get a
[1:39:55] restaurant
[1:39:56] that's going to house as many as we need
[1:39:59] on Mother's day
[1:40:01] but maybe we could if it's something
[1:40:04] that we do here or something like that
[1:40:06] so I'm just telling you that probably a
[1:40:09] month in advance advance just so you
[1:40:11] know what's on my heart and uh
[1:40:15] what I've been thinking lately so
