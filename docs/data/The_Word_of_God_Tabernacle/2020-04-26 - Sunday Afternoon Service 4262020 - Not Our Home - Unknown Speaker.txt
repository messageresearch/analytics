TRANSCRIPT
========================================
god bless you today welcome back to the Word of God Tabernacle streaming service today thankful that Michael was able to work something out for us I had to bring my desktop into the living room because it can't stream using a mobile device because they don't have enough followers I'm not popular enough so maybe if you all click enough likes maybe I'll get enough followers that they'll allow us you have to have a thousand followers to do it on on the phone on a mobile device that's why on my weekly things I have to I have to record it and then send it to Micah then he uploads it so you all can see on on our website if that's those are our lives so doing the life is a little more complicated a little more difficult but thankful to have Micah to be able to show me how to do it and to get this to work and get up and running again so I was very thankful we only have a minute late or half-hour late so that's not too bad but amen god bless you it's good to have you all with us again

we have God Lord may you speak to these lips towards you to have us to hear according to your perfect will now as we committed to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen god bless you now there's a something the Lord put on my heart probably a couple weeks ago I actually an issue was going to make it a short little midweek snip at 15-20 minute sermonette if you will but the more I got to study on and the more I got to looking at it the more I felt like that it would be something that would be more for a Sunday so the Lord puts us on my heart to bring today so I want to do this and I want to talk about this role is not our home even this world is not our home sometimes we sort of tend to lose the vision about that there's a particular scripture I want to read in just a moment that kind of highlights that that was the thing that stuck to me that Jesus said that kind of stuck to me because sometimes are sometimes as we spoke last week about vision and keeping our vision on what is spiritual and what is right and and keeping our vision on Jesus and and what we're looking for what we're expecting today and and what we spend our time on and in our emotions on our spirit involved in I mean you know those in my congregation know I'm not much of a modern events preacher and the things that's going on but it's hard to deny and you don't want to nullify the scripture what it says about it but also making sure that we keep our hearts and minds on what is real and what is right and what God wants us to keep our hearts and minds own so I want to go to the scripture now in st. John chapter 6 and just read a couple of verses of Scripture here pardon me out the don't steal my tables not quite high enough so we'll do the best we can so you pardon me for that but st. John chapter six I'm going to begin reading with verse 14 and and just draw a context here if we could remember now titled this is this world is not our home this world cosmos is not our home now this earth is we're going to come back and live here in the millennium and the white of the new heavens new earth the new jerusalem we're going to live here that's going to be right here on this earth but this world is not a home the Satan's eaten is not our home so let's look at this now st. John chapter 6 verse 14 then those men now this is of course the story after Jesus had fed the five thousand and with the loaves and fishes and people saw the miracle and they saw what had happened and the resulting effect of it of course you can read all of our six and see what the resulting effect is but the immediate resulting effect was this 14th verse then wrote then those men when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him 18 he departed again into a mountain himself alone and notice when they come to make Jesus a king they come by force to take him to try to force him to make him a king which is what what they did the whole time even as they look through the scripture and were and we're living their lives and under the oppression of the Roman government they kept looking for this keen they kept looking for this one to come and and wipe the enemy away and the white the Romans off and is set up on the King ship on the throne and be the King here and and and transform this this world well that wasn't the way it was going to be that was a little bit was supposed to be God has his way of doing it and it's in the scripture if we if we look and read the scripture we try to transform and reform this earth what I hear to do that the children of God the ministers of God the the sons and daughters of God we're not here to change your transformer reform this world we have one responsibility and we'll get to it in just a minute but they wanted to take in making the key why didn't he allow them to do that because it wasn't that time he wasn't here to become king when he's King he's son of David he wasn't here to become king he was here to become a sacrificial lamb that lamb and and to be able to serve that purpose of the sacrificial lamb on her on earth was the reason that Jesus came well if they tried to push him up in a kingship that was going to change the whole picture of everything jesus said I do nothing except the father show me first and what he shows me that's what I'll do amen so so the purpose of Jesus being here was to fulfill the will of the Father it was to fulfill the will of God if it wasn't to fulfill God's will then what was the point of it so if that was his purpose and what is our purpose what is our purpose to be here our purpose is to build some great kingdom here our purpose is to find it to be elected to some political office or something so we can reform everything that's not our job it wasn't Jesus's job then that's why he would let them he was king he's absolutely king but that wasn't why he came he came a sacrifice not as a king so when they come to try to take him as king he ran away he got away from he said he the Bible says he departed to get into the mountains alone and got away from them so they wouldn't do that yes we do Jesus is the key we acknowledge him is that we know that absolutely but that wasn't the purpose he came here realizing this was not his home case in point let's go over to st. John chapter 18 read Saint John chapter 18 here we'll begin with verse 33 this is the conversation with Pilate after they delivered Jesus unto Pilate and see Jesus is on words he says here as Pilate is questioning him now we'll go down to st. John 18 we'll go to the thirty thirty third verse thirty third verse yet then Pilate entered into the judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said unto Him art thou the King of the Jews notice the question notice what they tried to do to him not his twelve but the others that were following him if you go and read the rest of Saint John six you'll see his admonishing to them his his is telling them why they were even there they weren't there because they believed they weren't believers but look what they did they tried to make him keen now look what Pilate is saying art thou the King of the Jews because he that was the that was the false witness that was brought against Jesus to try to bring him before Pilate halt to be crucified because it couldn't be a transgression of Jewish law that the Romans would acknowledge it had to be a transgression of Roman law and that Roman law was this man is trying to take over kingship and we don't have any other but you see but so they were able to try to make him in the Romans I look like something he wasn't even trying to portray he wasn't trying to make himself King but look what Pilate said thou art thou King of the Jews jesus answered him say us now this of thyself or do others tell it of thee of me Pilate answered am i a Jew thy own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done jesus answered listen now this is the scripture this is the scripture that that just went over my spirit to to bring this with look what Jesus said now not neglecting Jesus life and everything he manifests to show us but look what he said jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world Wilfred if were Christians then our kingdom is not of this world amen his kingdom was not of this world our kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then my servants would fight then what would my servants fight jesus said if this was my kingdom these are my subjects they would fight and he would fight for them he would be there with him but this is not his kingdom if this king of this kingdom if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is but now is my kingdom not from hence Pilate therefore said unto Him art thou a king then jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born to this end end was I born yes he was and to that end was he born but that wasn't the purpose he served while he was here to the end of it yes he is now king of kings and Lord of lords did this end was I born for this cause I came into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth hears my voice now what is that truth what is that truth we know that Jesus is the truth the truth is not a theme the truth is a person Jesus is the truth he said he was the way the truth the life with Jesus was the way the truth the life if he's that truth then he's the one to come and reveal that truth to his own people his he came for that purpose not to be a king of this world not to set up his kingdom in this world in this Satan's Eden remember last week we talked about how Jesus blood the water bathed the earth and Jesus blood dropped on it there's going to be a fiery baptism that blood redeemed this earth back to God it belongs to God now we're still in the middle of Satan's Eden but this earth belongs to God now he's going to take full control over it and that's exactly what he's doing now all this that we see and all this going on in the motion now is running it to that point but this is not our home this world is not our cosmos jesus said if this was my kingdom if this world was my home if this was what I came for then my servants would fight they would fight that I wouldn't be brought into the hands of the Jews but he's not the king of this world well that this world is not his home then this world can't be our home Jesus kept the purpose the perfect focus how do we would desire so and admittedly since it's hard yeah I love this country I love people I don't want to see anybody go to hell I don't want to see anything detrimental happen to anybody I don't want to see one person diaper on a virus but it's just it's inevitable the scripture tells us that not all are going to come to repentance so we know that but it I understand how it hurts I understand how hard it is to watch our beautiful country just in the past 50-plus years I've been alive go from what it was even the beaver cleaver days to what it is now and how far has slidden how far that's gone and how how the degradation of this world it used to be that my saying was that they they try to patch things up in this world by putting a band-aid on a broke it even that anymore I don't even think that they they try to cure cancer with a breath of air or something or with mercurochrome you you most people don't know but some of you might know what that is that's what my mom always put on me when I had a scrape wasn't mercurochrome you can't cure cancer with that it doesn't work that way but I always said if it seemed like her felt like that they tried to that they're trying to make things better with with taking God out of it the big push now on this coronavirus thing is that we have to rely on and depend on the one thing that's going to work the one thing that is true the one thing is sure and that is science what a lot of the devil and there there's nothing more imperfect than science the only thing that is perfect and the only thing that's reliable the only thing you can depend on is God period there is no question there is no determining of that but you know even the disciples didn't understand it when they were here Jesus talked about it and and and we just read that and and and what he said about that and in he he knew he kept his vision right but but even his disciples even the ones that were followed they didn't understand that I think it's probably a lot been the way it was and brother Branham was here and maybe even still some now with brother Branham and it just understand the purpose the reason that the fulfillment and what it was about even Peter look even Peter when they come to take Jesus even Peter drew a sword and cut off one of the high priests servant Sears could is right there off Jesus had to take and heal the man right there supernaturally had to heal the man right there because Peter even thought he himself God's disciple took a sort of think oh that's what we're gonna do with it we're gonna we're gonna take it by force and he cut the man's ear off but that wasn't why it was here so many times we try to do the same thing and we try to go the same way but you know Jesus told him he said if you live by the sword you'll die by the sword that's not the purpose we want to fulfill here that's not what we want to do going back to the midweek thought you know keep her vision keep her fall in line in the right way this world is not her home look let's continue to go on and build with this in a in Shepherd of the sheep fold in 1956 Rev Anne said it that's the way the human race is we are absolutely totally helpless without the Shepherd of the fold now the world doesn't understand that the world doesn't see that the world cosmos World Order I'm not talking about everybody but the world in general the Cosmo does not see that they don't acknowledge or understand that but we do Christians we do the ones that understand and are in the position of recognizing what our place is here why not put us here we're helpless without the Shepherd of the fold we can't find our way back look now he's talking about humanity and humanity trying to find its way back to where it fell from in the beginning in the Garden of Eden how do we get back to that place he said we've tried to educate our way back we've tried to reform our way back but we'll never be able we'll never do it Reformation we'll never do it he said we're not reformers the police out here are reformers weren't preachers of the gospel reformers around here to take care of the laws even another what he talked about you know someone does something wrong or a murder or something he said that's not our business the cops take care of that then the Reformers they're the ones to take care that thing that's not our job that's not our place I place that our job is to preach the gospel that's why God put us here to preach the gospel Jesus was here to do the will of the Father when the will of the father was finished God took him I can't think of a better life but we get all these other things going on in life and marriages and families and children and the grandchildren and homes and you know we have a lot of the things of the world water earthly Goods and things that we enjoy in the pleasures that God gives us and we're thankful for that but none of that should be something that holds us or grips us to the place that we lose the purpose of being here and that's to be ministers of the gospel not just me standing here today you all know that a minister of the gospel is someone that is born again has filled the Spirit of God and upholds the righteous and holiness of the Word of God and ministers their life to other people as they go around the world hard to do now he's supposed to stay at home all day but still it's a life it's something that's eating you not on you it's something that comes out of you not into you it's something that you just you you live because it's who you are to preach the gospel we are preachers of the gospel not to try to put people on penalty crawl on your knees so forth there's nothing that we can do there's no dependence or nothing that we can do to inherit Goddard or life in daughter the life of Jesus Christ put penalty crawl on your knees so forth but to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ deliverance to the people that's what the Shepherds are supposed to do to feed the sheep as Peter as he as he talked to Peter and Saint John chapter one Amen lovest thou me me more than these feed my sheep feed my lambs well the ministering of the gospel is what God's called us here for we come into this world we do God's will and when God will is done in our lives it's time to go home again what a greater life to live then to come born and live for God and to fulfill the purpose of God has in our lives and then go ahead and then and then God take us home and we're very selfish as humans I still desperately miss my mother I think about her almost every day but that's just me that's just cuz I'm selfish that's just cuz I'm human you know she come here fulfilled the purpose God give her and then he took her home praise the Lord we're gonna be united again one day hopefully believing very soon we're gonna be united again the rest of its just selfish selfishness and humanity on my part but when she but when it's done when it's time to be done and God has finished say God take me it's time to go home at that time if the Lord wants to take us home then it's time to go home it's it's God's a Weedle and purpose in our lives we're just we're just Pilgrims and strangers here what we're just walking around in this earth fulfilling trying to fulfill whatever purpose it is that God's put in our lives now I want to read a couple more scriptures Matthew chapter 13 one verse of scripture will change this over just a bit but still on the same theme in Matthew chapter 13 around the wandering one verse verse 22 Matthew 13 22 now Jesus talks about the sower and sowing the seed and of course the seed to get some get some out into the world into the earth and but this particular part now the 22nd verse he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word listen to this now either here at the word and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word out of that person or choke the word and he becometh unfruitful god help us never to be that way god help us never get to that place to where we let the cares of the world the the desire for riches and things like that steal away the purpose that God put us here to keep us from being unfruitful the fruitfulness that God's put in our lives is for a reason and and that's why we're even a year is to fulfill that purpose and and to produce those fruits and understanding that God puts you here to do that purpose and only you can do that purpose that's the reason you're here that's the reason God chose you and so that you could do it and that purpose that God put in you now if we get distracted and we get taken away with the cares of the world the Steep fulness of riches things those things just detract those things just take away from the fund of fundamental foundation of the why God set us here to begin with why are you here to start with see it takes a balance it takes a balance to understand I told you many go it burns me to see where this world is going it burns me to see how far and how low and and and and how bad this country even has just gotten to the morals and the ethics and and all of this this country is just it's just it's not even a semblance of godliness anymore it's not even a semblance of holiness anymore and yeah it hurts I hate to see it and but the way people think and do but there's a balance there's a balance to maintain to be able to take that word and live that and not to become so heavenly bound we're no earthly good because we got to be we got to fulfill the fruitfulness remember the fruitfulness part of it is the part that's here on this earth yes there'll be a part where we play the body change go home and forever be with the Lord but the fruitfulness of the part of it that God had us here it has us here for is in our humanity in this earth in this life and fulfilling the purpose that God give us in this world to do its maintaining that balance and keep things between understanding what we can and should do as members of this society and productive members of this society and and being a child of God if you don't to me a child of God isn't somebody that just need collects to everything on the earth or doesn't care anything about what's going on or not trying to help with souls to Christ I don't believe brother Brandon was that way absolutely not Jesus wasn't that way Jesus walked by and people were were there he healed we don't know who some of those people were saved or not He healed them I believe the same thing happened in this day think of the hundreds of thousands of people that received physical healing your brother around this ministry how many of those people were not actually children of God but they had enough faith to believe for Supernatural healing so what poor but that that purpose it God had us I mentioned this before and and I haven't found this story in a while so just bear with me but when when when brother Branham went to Chicago one time back in the early days when he went to Chicago one time they had three or four days setup of Matson Bo's day I think or somebody had had it set up or something and he was going to Chicago and had for five days meetings whatever it was three or four days and after the Fuhrer the second or third night he tells his people he informs is a manager and all the purpose or the person that God sent me here for came in last night we can close the meetings now down now of course they did and they kept the meetings going because it was advertised a lot of people were coming but brother Graham expressed a purpose that God sent me here for this park this person this purpose and that person when the God revealed to him that person was in he said we can close the meetings down because that's the one God came to get in Chicago think about that the purpose and that person that God had sent him there for good put an airplane on the ground in Memphis Tennessee for a woman for her little boy boy wasn't little but hurt her boy is little to her but her boy see God would bankrupt heaven beside let one of his children go go away or go astray all the father has given will come but there's a balance to maintain and make sure that we understand yes we want to be productive here we want to do what we can for God here but our job is to preach the gospel this is not our kingdom this is not a home we're not here to build a kingdom we're not here for perpetual existence we're here to do God's purpose and then go home eternity will enter in labor and eternity will begin later but now is the purpose God give us and then we did the time has come up let's go home look at this now an invisible union November 1965 brother and says I'm he's I just got a little excerpt out of this but if you go listen to it he's going on pretty good and then he hits this quote so only secluded this one quote but you go listen to it above and below it it's just outstanding but when it gets to this quote he said now buildings all right hospitals are all right all these other things are all right educational programs that's why we have to live here we have to read right that's one of the nice of God but that's not why I put us here he said like we wasn't supposed to put on any clothes at the beginning I'll preach on that glittery Suika Lord willing but we have to wear clothes because God because God gave us clothes but in the beginning we didn't need them we were veiled now she is veiled now see at that time we were veiled I just leave it there it's just like they were in the Garden of Eden they were veiled from their nakedness we were veiled today that veil that God gave us helps us to to stay protected from what's going on around us it's a godly veil it's available to help us understand what holiness is and what righteousness is then it was the same thing they didn't realize that they were naked because they had the holy veil now that holy veil that God give us now you know we can see and understand and see those things today and they aren't the same today as they were then because that was a holy veil we have a different kind of veil but it's the Holy Spirit veil even though we can see we understand what God's holiness really is and that holiness that God gave us puts it in perspective see the police are fine the hospitals are great the educational programs all that's it's fine and dandy good not not going to say against that in those people but that's not why we're here that's not if your doctor or nurse or a policeman or whatever that's perfectly fine god bless you that's wonderful that's a great thing God works through medicine God wants to do those things but God put this bride here to preach the gospel our purpose is to be here - to get those that that belong to Yemen bring them into the fold and then when they come in the hole they do the same you talk about a pyramid scheme it's not a scheme but it's it's bringing them in and one person brings in ten more ten more ten one you got the kingdom of Gus we want to fulfill is God's purpose God's purpose here second Timothy now let's read this 2nd Timothy 4 second Timothy chapter 4 read a few verses of scripture here now notice this won't cause bosses thinks of the world that's fine we live here we get educated and you can't hardly live with them get money without a good job of that education sometimes we go to doctors we go to hospitals there's nothing wrong with that those are just the economies of the things who could go and make a little bit of money here we go use that money to buy food and that's the economy's that we live in and that's that's the part of what we deal with in this cosmos but that's not our purpose that's not why God put us here all those things are just after shoots of the purpose cuts called us to be here for second Timothy 4:1 he said now I charge thee listen to this now charge see therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word amen preach the word that's about as good an instruction as I know preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine amen to that but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned into fables oh my if you see a falling away today and what going on in this world and people turning to everything it seems like but what is godly turning to every other church or every other ministry or whatever that other than something that God's ordained at God is in people said well this church is fine what might be that that's fine but what does the Bible say because that's all it matters the standard is in here the standards done up here the standards not in some seminary the standard is in this Bible and if they don't make the stems of this Bible then I believe it along because it's got to meet this standard it's got to meet God's standard it doesn't be God's standard then what's the point that we just might as well have a another Club let's just form another club like the quad so the lines or whatever or just for another club or just have another club we'll come get together have few drinks and enjoy our social life and dine go to hell but bow that's not why we're here amen we're here to fulfill the purpose of God give us place to work Paul's town Timothy preach the word reprove rebuke with all long-suffering doctrine that's why God give us a voice that's why God give us a life that's why give us the Holy Spirit so we live that life and we project that spirit and we let that word live through us so that others could see Jesus in us I've said it many times friend they might not understand what it is they might not comprehend why it's like that or why you're like that or why do you act like that they may call you a name or square and they've got so many names for everybody the fear thing was talking about the other day in the shaming remember we talked about the fate of the fear and the shaming you know they come up with a name for everything I thought that was only supposed to be in kindergarten playgrounds that people called names other people names but you see grown adults learning people politicians if they can't understand it because it's not something they believe hold to themselves as a principle they put a name on it or label it as a some kind of a phobia I'd hate to think if they knew me what they call me what would they call us I'm not smart enough to make that up but they already come up with a name for people who are abiding by their purpose and rules of this coronavirus Court idiots I think our quarry idiots or something like that they call them it's just a name I thought names were left behind we're in kindergarten but that's exactly what they do is the fear is the shame is to try to control you by calling you a name oh you're this person you're like this because you're luckier you're this kind of a person no I'm just like God because God's made me like God God born again of the Holy Spirit I am the way I am because of the grace of God not because of some phobia because I am what God made me let's read this now a trial now this is an April 5th 1964 brother Graham preached at trial several times but in the April 5th 1964 trial all what ought that do to us though we be alienated though we're in a dark world of unbelief and sorrow and sickness and death listen to this alienated in a dark world amen not this kingdom dark world of unbelief sorrow sickness and death you say unbelief how do you know if they believe or not if they're out there promoting that sinus is the only true short things we have that's unbelief that's death think of the thousands of things that scientists prove was perfectly right a hundred years ago that our null and void today the dump that dump they don't even count that there was a time where scientists thought that the atom was the smallest thing there was and then one day they figured out they could spread that atom and all those other stuff come out of it don't tell me science is the most short if size is the most short thing we have friends and we're all in trouble darkness unbelief sorrow sickness and death think about that now that all this is going on more and more people are depressed more people getting I've heard more people are becoming alcoholics again drug addicts again children at home being abused by their parents because the schools are closed sickness sorrow and death I'm not saying that closing it was the right or wrong thing to do I'm just saying look at the result you think well there's so many people that have died from it how many more might have died well how many other lives are being ruined as a result of what's going on again I'm not here to politicize that I'm not here to say it's right or wrong or indifferent I'm here to preach the gospel but I know that in this world of darkness and unbelief it is sorrow sickness and death yet lack yet let's act like some less act like sons and daughters of God we are the sons and daughters of the king it ought to change our attitude everything no matter what the rest of the world is we must hold up the rights of God praise the Lord no matter what the world is we must hold up the rights of God mine we remember that this is not our home we are not of this country we are not of this world we're born of the Spirit of God which is above several times Jesus even in John talks about that I had a couple of those scriptures I had to take out just for times sake Jesus said I'm from above Jesus says I'm out of this world Jesus saw them if you were of this world if you're of me the world's going to hate you too because on either the Rope dirt out of the world they hate me they hate you none of us were born of the Spirit of God which is above he said I was going with my life here not long ago to a grocery store I've seen a strange thing in the summer time in Indiana a woman had on a dress they don't wear them too much anymore you know my wife I said well look at their wonder if that woman's a Christian they said well all these women I know some of them here singing the choirs churches she said why why why is it bill that they do that I said of course and our people our people doesn't do that I said of course we're of a different nation media said how people don't do that the man said of course we're of a different nation she said we're Americans aren't we I said oh no we're just camping here we're not Americans I said see we are from above that's easy Doug that American spirit can get onion no but other band was talking about in the spiritual aspect now of course not the fact that we weren't born as Americans in this world but understanding that our spiritual aspect transcends everything else that goes on here yes of course we're Americans yes of course we live in this country and we read write do the things it's country dictates but we're from a higher order friend we come from above you're going again in the spirit of God the Holy Spirit come down United our hearts with God and we profess like Abraham we are pilgrims and strangers this is not our home we're seeking a city whose builder and maker is God coming from above yes we are the sons and daughters of God if you're gonna listen hope you did maybe you didn't maybe you forgot future homes the heavenly bridegroom and earthly bride you go to look at that listen to it you have it if you did you see that point where brother Branham was talking about Abraham coming and having fellowship with Melchizedek he said on the very ground because when Abraham went forth Abraham went forth from his foreign country although it was common to him left his dad and he went to a land that he knew nothing uh but he was being led of God as God was leading him his life was preaching is his life was preaching it was preaching what was then what was coming in what is now or what's now and what is coming because that place that brother Adam talked about Abraham and Melchizedek having fellowship and communion he's having the the wine and the bread as they're having their communion and fellowship he said he had it right there on the little spot where that new city is going to come up out of the earth that pyramid-shaped mountain 1,500 miles where that is going to be the prana home of this bride and the bridegroom that future home it brings us to that place whether was just a foreshadow of it when Abraham come and had fellowship and communion right there God led him to that very spot and when he got to that very special spot God met him there praise Allah the logos come down put on a form of flesh and set here and had fellowship with his servant had communion with this servant right there on the literal spot that's that home that's that place that looking to Abraham was looking for he said we're not we're pilgrims and strangers it's not a home we're seeking a city whose builder and maker is God amen that's the city we're looking for the city whose builder and maker is God coming from above yes we are sons and daughters of God amen in that city that will descend of course on that pyramid-shaped mountain and bring it out in the light that it's supposed to be for us to live on it'll be a place that would be fit for us to live on a couple more scriptures for our clothes st. John chapter 15 let's see here st. John 15:18 beginning with verse 18 is one of the scriptures I wanted to read that I quoted if the world hate you you know that it hated me before it hated you so if the world hates you understand it hated Jesus before it hated you if you were of the world the world would love his home but because ye are not of the world but I have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hated you what world world cosmos World Order now this goes out to a lot people maybe I'm going to read it but I remember back years and years ago certain man from a certain denomination held up a message book and said this is our worst enemy look friend they know who we are don't deceive yourself don't don't neglect to understand they know who we are it's going to come to that place one day it's going to come to that head one day I'm you notice maybe I'm checking my words I'm I told you the morning God gave me a month ago just to be careful what I say they know and I'm careful about what I say here because this broadcast publicly but but we're not of this world they know we're not of this world God knows we're not of this world God chose us God chose us out of the world we're not of the world we're actually in a different the bride isn't even entered into a bride age now to the place that my vision my vision I'm looking for Christ but I'm also even first looking for my loved ones to show up just like the scripture said you know how they ever hear that anybody else say but the bride scripturally when Jesus rose he he brought many of the Saints with him and they appeared unto many well it's gonna be the same thing this resurrection gonna be the same way they're gonna resurrect and they're going to begin to peer unto many and we'll know who they are what will recognize it they'll appear to those who are looking for them he won't come to those who aren't looking that's our vision there it will come to those who are looking and I'm looking friends I'm looking every day I believe your vision you're looking to because we're not of this world he says I've chosen him out of the world therefore the world hates you the world hates us because we're not of this world we're looking for a very concise time and way of living amen this world this cosmos look here and Satan's een in the August 1965 now notice perverted from innocence don't miss this now the church has been with this lust veil on notice now we talked about the veil a minute ago notice I probably didn't do a very good job of it but notice now notice what it's done to her its perverting her from innocence to knowledge see the holy veil she was innocent with the lust veil she has knowledge she knows it's Pleasant she knows what it does see it's a fruit it's a tree to be desired to make one wise she is perverted from innocence to knowledge from holiness to filth and lust and from life to death look at what the influence of the world is today look what the influence of our poor children is today if nothing else all the filth that pours out of Hollywood all the the designs and the clothes and and the fashions and what a little bit there is in it and the filth that comes across the screens is just it's it's just horrible that thing that the kids feed off for these things people feed off for those things with no wonder that's what they're going to produce because it's traded holiness for filth and lost in life to death look friend we're not of this world we don't we don't live like them we don't act like them we don't think like them we don't dress like them we don't go to the places they go to we don't speak like they do in a lot of ways in almost every way we don't dress like they do nothing that we do it's becoming mobile you see people who call themselves Christians and you take somebody out of the wagon you look at the two together you say which one's the Christian you can't even tell them apart anymore which one is which God's bride is recognizable God God should be able to be noticeable no matter where she is you see what she's I boss because she's different she's from a different wild we're not from this world we're not from this planet we live here this body and everything we do well we don't eat at dress look think like like the rest of the world does because we're apart from the world my mom and my sister used to sing an old song back years ago in North Carolina says we're in the world but not of the world that's what the master said amen and I believe that's still true they treated they traded innocents for knowledge holiness for filth and lust from and life to death but rinses and said this kingdom has to die this kingdom shall die the God of heaven will destroy it from the face of the earth think about that all the elements will melt with fervent heat the Bible says let's go to that let me let's just read that for a minute let's see what others hey one more scripture not one to read and then we'll go over to the second Peter let's read in Hebrews first and and I want to finish up here just a minute Hebrews 13 14 for we had for for here we have no continuing City but we seek one come amen here we have no continuing City Jesus said if this were my kingdom yes I'm a king I'm a king but not of this kingdom and if I was the king of this kingdom my servants would fight but I'm not of this world that's not my purpose that's not the point I'm here for I'm here to become a sacrifice I'm here to be a sacrificial lamb so that through my death and the shedding of my blood millions can know Jesus Christ and the power of that resurrection but second Peter listened second Peter 3 let's begin with verse 9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some can some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance I'll say praise the Lord - that had the same desire but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise in the elements listen this this this earth this world this cosmos that we're living in listen what's going to happen to it and what Saints we're getting closer to that everybody trying to sense a lot let's make this a better place so that's fine and dandy friend we're just making it fine and better so that it's but that's the whole promise of words going to it we want to make it the best place we can make it until that time but that but our point preach the gospel bring those out of that the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works the works that are therein I'll be burned up we're killing ourselves making a great Kingdom here that's gonna be cannon fodder it's gonna be burnt over Oh help us what that ought to do where our vision to understand and that becomes a reality friend all this here is going to be gone all this here is going to be burnt over and done away with it's going to be melted with further heat even the very molecules every molecule of sin will be annihilated because this place is gonna have to be fit for Christ and his bride to come back and reign in the Millennium and for the new city to be set up it's gotta be purified because that world pack that word pass away or words doesn't mean it's gonna annihilate this planet it's going to change it transform it annihilate every element of sin even the atmospheres will explode melt with fervent heat to make it fit for Christ and his bride to come live on the great transformation that pass away is the same word in Matthew they said heavens and earth will pass away change from one form to the other but my word will never pass away or change from one form to another same word same meaning the word cannot change Amen you want something sure you want something true forget science this is it it's the only thing that will survive it not this little book but the word which is Christ to Christ the word Oh mine seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens shall be inferred the heavens shall be on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat my friend think of it this not all nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness that's what we're looking for the place wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore love seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye be found of him in peace without spot and blameless found in Christ be careful he says to be found in Christ without spot blameless in the place in the position of God's purpose in our lives God placing us here the reason that we're here Jesus said if my st. if if this is my kingdom my servants would fight think about that if this was arcing them what would we do how would we act if this is my kingdom I run for mayor if this is my kingdom I'd run for president I do everything I couldn't try to make sure and make this that place that that's envisioned in my mind but the place is envisioned in my mind if I ran for prayer even if I became the president wouldn't happen anyway because this is what's going to happen to what's our point not to build a kingdom here with store up treasures in heaven where moth does not eat and rust doesn't corrode we send up our treasures in heaven amen all that we can do for God is the only thing that will stand things that we do for the world the things that we make and are living all those things we have to do like said the education read write and close and all that's us part of comments you go that's all fine and dandy not a thing in the world wrong with that but all that's going to be gone one day you ever heard the old story that they've never seen a u-haul trailer behind us pulling behind ours we can't take it with us all the but what we send ahead but this world is on our home gotta keep that balance and make sure that we don't get caught up and the things that's going on so many people and I have something I feel maybe the Lord give me during the week to bit but understanding it not to get caught up in some of these other things that you know we're just humans and we try to work everything out so much.you we try to make things be things that and we don't know if that's what they're supposed to be or not but we love the Lord we do the best we can with what the Lord's give us amen and I'm thankful that God's blessed us to be able to have his word to be able to look into his word and and that word can speak to us and and show us you know friend just exhort you in pray read your Bible spin-spin least a portion of your day with the Lord Jesus and let him speak to you let it move you let it help you show you that whatever purpose he has in your life be fulfilled whatever that might be every one of us have a purpose every one of us I know that the bottom line there the the number one pure goal is to preach the gospel that's absolutely but you know of that underlying part of even that preach the gospel is that we all have a part and we all have specific things that God wants us to do specific places specific people maybe even if the God if God wanted me to share this message with President Trump I believe you make the way and show me and give me the words who had the mayor of the city whoever some great Hollywood movie star or song a senior musician or something I'm gonna do it you couldn't be his team of horses couldn't stop me but I believe God would make a way so whatever that point whatever that purpose whatever that reason is this is not our kingdom friend this is not our home we're not here to make that this kingdom and build great Kingdom here for us we're here to be servants of God and to live for him amen let that know our our focus our vision let that help us to to understand that that middle-of-the-road even that that that that moderate way of we think of maintaining that balance between understanding that were sons and daughters of God were from above and the point that an apartment God has us here to play Jesus did only what the father showed him help us Lord that we can do that we can be led by that spirit and only do what the father shows us let's bow our heads Lord Jesus follower thankful again today that you're with us and that you never can never leave or forsake us thank you Lord for this time and the ability to have this streaming service I pray that you bless it Lord I pray that your words would go forth to each one of us and Lord may it be strength in our lives may it be a witness to us may it be something we can hold on to and believe Lord let it be what we live Lord and and then our focus and vision don't let us get caught up in all the other things going on around us all the little frills and things but Lord let us just be focused on you let us let our aim and our purpose that everything that we do think every let's just be focused and and and understand this world is not our home we're here to do your will Lord God if it's nothing more than coming on this planet doing your will and going home to be that simple Lord bless your people bless all those that listened today all those that watched all of our church at home God lift them up in prayer every day Lord thanking you so much for giving us Lord the such a precious group of people Lord I pray it whoever watches her hears this would be blessed and may you just speak to us Lord once again Lord into our hearts father as we continue on this pilgrim journey we give you thanks and praise for it Lord in Jesus name god bless you appreciate you being a part of the service today may the Lord really bless you were here for each of you if you need anything please let us know sometimes it feels like when we're just here we're sometimes I don't feel like I'm doing enough but but you better know always know that we're praying for you in our hearts and lives and sure appreciate you loving the Lord so God richly bless you I pray something would bless and speak to you today god bless you
