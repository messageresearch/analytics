valley bright morning star hallelujah amen thank you jesus we'll go to the lord in prayer now amen take any prayer requests anyone might have amen i'm guessing there's none over there buddy didn't see any either praise the lord i had one prayer request that came up yesterday at the minister's meeting found out i guess it happened a little while ago but i did not know about it but i found out yesterday that brother michael patterson had a stroke he had gone through uh some physical ailments and some situations in his body apparently it was the front left lobe that excuse me that was affected but those of you know about mike patterson pastors in peoria up in the phoenix area he's getting up in age but he's a fine brother very good brother i've enjoyed brother mike's ministry but he had a stroke but like i said it's been from what i was told it's been a little a few months ago uh he's and he's recuperating and doing a lot better uh but it seems like and it sounds like my brother tom weathers yesterday that brother mike is going to resign the church that he's pastoring there i don't think he had a lot of people but that's not relevant really if a man calls god calls a man he calls him in is the end of it no matter where his family or one person or a thousand doesn't matter he calls him he calls him but um but it sounds like brother mike is going to be resigning the church there uh up in peoria so please remember him in prayer if you would family those affected with brother mike fortunately like i said it seems like he's he's doing well and getting a lot better and his motor skills are okay and his speech is okay so we're very thankful for that but please keep brother mike in your prayer if you would i'll mention and well i'll just go ahead and mention it because brother mike patterson again at this point looks like he's resigning the church uh they're selling everything that's in the church uh so i told brother tom i said well we're very interested in the sound system so uh we may get a sound system uh from if brother mike does end up liquidating uh the assets of the church he has pews organ things like that so i asked brother tom if you've just taken inventory things that they have but we're most interested in the sound system the lord will provide that uh it might be a provision the lord is making for us to be able to have the sound system that we've been looking for needing so amen appreciate brother roger letting us use the one that he has but um i really really should get it back to him because it's there he doesn't need it they're still in the hotel room right now but they are looking for a facility to rent uh so if they do he'll definitely need it so but keep that in your prayers too if you will that's the lord's will and god provides for it then that's what his perfect will is and then praise the lord um also from last sunday brother rick ellis i mentioned about the heart situation he did go through the surgery tuesday and came through it well and he's doing good so thank the lord for that amen anyone have an unspoken request on your heart amen lord knows all hearts to stand if we could praise the lord take these needs to the lord and all the unspoken and just trust the lord and his blessings in our lives brother dennis could you pray for him lord jesus we humbly bow our hearts and heads before me knowing that you are all sufficient god yes lord of all our needs you are not respect the person father as our pastor said already you went to simon the pharisees little gathering and but you weren't welcome how that speaks to our hearts this morning jesus not only were you invited from the depths of our heart but father you are welcome yes lord you must have the preeminence every time we gather in your name and lord we're trusting in you for all our needs in ourselves we come we come up short we are failures but we can do all things through yes lord jesus we strengthened us and lord no matter how impossible the situation may be greater here it's in us than he it's is our fight it's your fight it's not our battle it's your battle help us to learn to get ourselves out of the way to die to ourselves and let you work your your holy spirit your life through us lord to give us some victory in anything we go through it's been said already the enemy is fighting harder than ever before i just read in your word father that their the gospel was preached to all but some did not receive it because it wasn't mixed with faith and father that can also be us we can come and our hearts are not right and our hearts are far from you you even said in vain do you worship me teaching the commandments the doctrines of men and father help us to hear your word to believe on you yes our brother mike father he's been through a stroke lord touch our brother continually give him the strength to overcome this and every uh a hand that was raised father may you meet each need according to your riches in glory for you're the god that cares you said to cast all our cares upon you for you careth for us you're the god of mercy father uh lord help us to recognize that to not live defeated lives to walk in the spirit to live by your word to let your word have preeminence lord i believe your coming is very close yes amen our doors is knocking at our hearts and let us always be ready you are all uh seeing god you know if we're living that life correct us lord if we go astray father as the prophet saw the bride in preview the bride tore the end and she came around one more time she was getting out of line don't let worldliness get ahold of us will that carnality rule us don't let the world sin be a part of our lives fathers help us lord we want to be a bride that is ready and bless each one as their hearts have been lifted up to you grant them the desires of their heart may their hearts burn within them as they know they met with you along the way may the testimonies come forth you're still alive you're still with your people you will not leave us nor forsake us you'll be with us to the end father in your name we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen praise the lord you can be seated if you like amen if you i'm sure notice we they got the the errors working uh it's not fixed uh they had to hardwire it uh around the thermostat so we operated with the breaker back there so it's on or off but i have found since i've been here yesterday and then this morning that it does obey the temperature on the thermostat so i've been standing here i've been feeling it coming on and going off it continuously blows but when the compressor kicks in it gets cold and then when it reaches that temperature i guess it kicks off so uh i told brother dennis if if we do get uh cool if it gets cold uh he can get up and flip the breaker off so that it just stops but so far it seems like it's doing okay to where uh when it gets to that temperature i put it on 72 when it gets to that temperature the compressor turns off so it's just blowing air so it doesn't get too cold so hopefully prayerfully uh it'll work that way now he's still working on it they're going to fix it right the way it's supposed to be but for today i just thought i'd mention that to you if it's something that uh uh that gets to that point if i see people starting to uh freeze then i was gonna let brother dennis know to turn the breaker off but so far it seems to be okay is everybody comfortable do you feel yes okay okay good it feels kind of empty compared to last week but uh praise the lord we're thankful he's here yes amen and appreciate there it does feel much better than it did last week in here amen let's go to song number 139 and then we'll put it up here on the screen for you he abides praise the lord he abides [Music] aren't you thankful for that [Music] i'm rejoicing night and day as i walk [Music] is [Music] yes [Music] [Music] the [Music] [Music] he is [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] long ago [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh hallelujah [Music] amen praise the lord jesus he abides still yet today doesn't he praise the lord so thankful he abides yes praise god amen he has our portion he is our absolute he is our everything he is our all in all amen praise the lord jesus amen micah has this song he wants to sing here praise the lord so happy to come now you want the tablet amen bless them lord jesus good community prayers uh i started using a new soap about a month and a half ago and my some certain parts of my body's legs and arms are breaking out so i've stopped using so just heal thank you i hope it's a blessing if you remember it know it feel free to sing along [Music] he cried so long he ran out of tears looking for a healing [Music] then one day his chance came along a healing man who could make him strong and he caught his eyes but [Music] are you willing to take up your mat and help yourself do you want to be free [Music] amen if you want [Music] ever tried to fix yourself [Music] have you gotten used to the chains and are you so attached to your pain you're afraid to part we'll ask god for a brand new heart do [Music] and help yourself [Music] amen if you want to be healed [Music] in [Music] are you willing to take up your mat and help yourself [Music] you've got to want to be [Music] [Applause] praise the water amen amen amen praise the lord reminds the truth yes amen such a truth praise the lord let's stand if we could now more of the service here it'll become pretty evident here in just about two minutes who requested that song you probably already know now since i said that amen yes i am the one that requested that mike has sing that song praise the lord so as a result we're going to go and turn into saint john chapter amen with a story that he just sung about is found amen praise the lord saint john chapter 5. had a little trouble with my voice this weekend spent over four hours crawling around in an attic thursday and friday and uh insulation just gets to you after a bit i wore a mask so don't get mad at me i wore a surgical mask inside and inside out so backwards so that uh you know surgical masks protect what goes out of your mouth because they're to be used in sterile environments so they don't want anything coming out of your mouth into a sterile environment but i turned it around so nothing would come in but the insulation's just it's just tough it's three foot probably two and a half three foot high and we had to run every single wire in the attic to make sure because they had mice that were eating the wires and our job was to fix all the wires that the mice had eaten so i had to climb through and crawl through all the wires and the insulation so i think it i think it did a little bit of a number on my voice uh but um but i'm thankful the lord still have a voice amen to worship him with so saint john chapter 5 before we read the word can we give our heads for another word of prayer precious jesus we are very thankful again today of their love your grace your mercy the blessings you give us every day father for another beautiful sunday morning resurrection sunday morning god that you give us we don't just celebrate it on easter like a lot of the world does a lot of christendom does but we celebrate it every day of our lives but of course we come here on sunday morning and we celebrate as we gather together with those of like precious faith and expecting you to meet with us here once again lord we know that you come everywhere you're invited you stay wherever you're welcome and we pray god that the worship of our lips the praise from our heart lord was a welcoming and inviting lord spirit for you to dwell in for you to be here and to feel like you're welcome here lord with us yes you said you'd never leave us or forsake us but we're praying and trusting you to manifest that spirit to us here real right now god in this place god may you touch every heart of every life strengthen us draw us closer to you more like you may your word go forth and empower and manifestation and do what you have preordained for this service for each one of us here today we rebuke every demonic spirit that we try to hurt hindu or infiltrate this service in any way that you would get the glory honor and praise for all this said and done and trusting you again lord that your word will not return void but accomplish that that you purposed it to accomplish here today we committed to you we thank you for those that have come lord and for you most of all and pray that your holy spirit will have preeminence now the remaining part of this service is we committed and dedicated completely into your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen saint john chapter 5 i'll just read a verse of scripture here and then let you be seated praise the lord let's go down to uh verse six this place that uh kind of where the song came from when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole the impotent man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me in the pool into the pool but while i while i am coming another stepeth down before me jesus said unto him rise up rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked uh and on the the same day was the sabbath let's drop down to verse 14 afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and saith unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worst thing come upon thee unto thee amen you can be seated if you like amen i want to i want i want to read this entire story at least to that point that we finished up here um but i just you know to keep you standing so long uh i just figured i would read the sort of the parts that we're looking to here now just a simple thought of something the lord had put on my heart the other day to to bring to you here and recognizing and i thought actually whoever wrote the song that mike is saying was inspired it speaks very much to me about what this uh story is about and the situation that we fall in that we find a lot in humanity today especially in this country maybe not so much in other countries i'm not sure but in this country we have that happening but uh the one thing it seems like that a lot of people are shirking today or pushing off or not wanting to deal with is the responsibility i was listening to a message brother branham was uh talking about and going into nicoletanism a little bit and and the thought of that came on my heart even stronger and when i see the things that's going on in the world today and then i look at the scripture and then i look sometimes at our own lives and and things it kind of strikes to recognize that it's become a it seems like again in this country a wholesale laziness and i say that because it seems like people are becoming less inclined for responsibility and that's what actually happens to a lot of people i believe that that even end up homeless a lot of the homeless people some of them of course i know have drug addictions or mental issues and things like that but i've ran across and seen where a lot of people that and some people that i've talked to even that they they just don't want the responsibility of living what we would consider a normal everyday life getting up on when we're supposed to get up going to work or supposed to go to work have a boss that tells you what to do earn an income and a living and pay your bills and be responsible a lot of them just don't want to do that they don't want the responsibility that comes with that kind of a life so they would just prefer live out on the street and live under a bridge and just eat what they can eat and beg what they can get from and and that's how they live their lives and there's no responsibility to that it reminded me when brother branham was talking about that when i was listening to it the other day about that nicolaitanism and you know it came to me again and i've said this before that nicolaitanism is a very easy religion it's a very easy thing to follow there's really very minimal responsibility now there are duties that you have to perform but there's little responsibility because all the responsibility is put on the hierarchy all the responsibility is put on the people that are in charge all the people that are following along that are under this spirit all they have to do to feel like they're right is to obey whatever that person is telling them to do you do this and you're okay do the hail mary's and it's okay confess in the booth it's okay and you the repentance and the purgatory it's an easy religion we'll pray for you we'll uh we'll do all the prayers we'll do all the reading we'll tell you what the bible says you don't need to know what the bible says and for many years through the dark ages the catholic church held the scripture from the common man for that reason to keep control over them but it but but it but it becomes a very easy spirit to fall into it becomes and people become complacent they become lazy uh not content now again we've talked about that that's a different thing but complacency and and lazy lazy and religion lazy and how they do and what they do and how they act and uh and they just they don't want to take on the responsibility but life in itself is a responsibility everything about life is a responsibility and the sad part of it is as a christian and in the christian faith uh you you have to revert back to it to being a child to not have responsibility because the children are the ones the little babies of course have no responsibility as they get older they gain a little more responsibility and a little more responsibility till you become an adult and then when you become an adult you become accountable uh you have to be accountable for your life you have to be accountable to the things that you do and that you say and of course before god as a christian we're accountable for every word that we say in every thought that we think yes we're responsible to those things but as a human uh we have job responsibilities we have home responsibilities uh money bills uh as you grow up schools and and and families and and you have to buy clothes and have to eat and uh all those responsibilities uh get piled up now you know joel sit back there listening to me very intently but he just turned eight doesn't have to worry about the power bill his mommy and daddy do amen that's their responsibility not his responsibility he doesn't even think about it doesn't concern himself with it if he get hot he might turn the thermostat down to 50. run 24 7 800 power bill he doesn't care it's not his responsibility and but you understand that's the attitude that a lot of people have it's not my responsibility and i don't mean to continue to harp back on this because i know they're not all that way but um but if you go many times and zac tafta across the wash over there they kind of have a homeless haven back there there's several encampments they've been run off and they come back and then run off and come back and but when you go to where they were i was coming to me and roger returning or maybe it was just me anyway oh miracle mile and right there at the railroad tracks people they they camp there and they come they kick them out it's inside a fence they're not supposed to be right next to the railroad tracks they'll come and kick them out but then they come back and they kick them out and come back but every time they kick them out and they leave and you can tell when they leave because their encampments cleaned out their tents are gone and that there's just a horde of trash the size of this church left in the wake of those people but it it and i've seen it like that one time we went to california if you in certain places and uh and i just say california probably sure it's a lot of other places we went into a walmart and you go in we went into this walmart to look for some clothes and stuff is just scattered everywhere we literally i don't know if mike and tapped this when they were younger remember this we walk this walmart clothes are scattered everywhere they're not folded on the shelves there's probably almost as many clothes on the floor as there is on the shelves there's stuff strong everywhere because people don't take the responsibility if you take a piece of clothing off the shelf fold it back and put it the way you found it people don't care about that i actually literally watched a woman take some clothes that were nice clothes off the shelf that were folded neatly and put them up she didn't like it just throw it on the floor oh my goodness oh somebody also pick it up it's their responsibility but the sad part i saw that i mean you see this today my wife when somebody just grabbed arm loads of stuff and walked out the door you know it's somebody else's responsibility somebody else will pay the bill and that's the attitude a lot of people have but unfortunately it seems to bleed over into into christianity and into uh the mindset of of us even when you think about the necessity of having the responsibility a lot of people uh don't want information they don't want to know something because as soon as you know something you're responsible to what you know if you know the correct way of being baptized you're responsible to go get baptized according to that scripture right if you know it now if you don't know of course now there's there's no god doesn't weak at ignorance anymore so there's no excuse anyway but a lot of people just don't ask because they don't want to know they don't want the responsibility it's just it's just it's to me it reverts back to a wholesale laziness people just don't they just don't want to have any more responsibility than they have to have but as an adult especially as a christian friend and recognizing our responsibility isn't just to the person paying the bill or the person cleaning the floor our responsibility is to god amen he sees everything he knows everything and that is our responsibility now look at this story i'm going to read it again but let's look at this story after the after this there was a feast the jews jesus went up to jerusalem there is that jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches and these lay a great multitude of impotent folk a blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water now you understand that that's all they had that's all they could do they people would literally bring others up to set there and wait or have somebody there waiting with them for the moving of the water and when the water moved when that angel come and moved that water for healing they would grab them and put them in the pool so that they could be healed so that they could be well and the bible says it was a great multitude of these people empty folk blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in uh was made whole of what whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmity 38 years like the song says 38 years when jesus saw him lie he knew that he had been now a long time in that case he said unto him strange question will thou be made whole in other words i guess the psalm they changed the verbiage do you want to be well do you want to be well and see that becomes a question it's a very pertinent question to me to understand do you really want to be well because see do you understand now you've been laying in this condition 38 years it doesn't say from his birth but it does say 38 years so we don't know how long that is and we do know that jesus went to this man specifically multitudes around this pool and the healer god the healer stepped around walked over and around no telling how many people to get to this one man none of them were healed god didn't tell to any of them at least not according to the scripture he walked all around all the other people just to get to this one man and but then when he got to him he said do you want to be well right will thou be made whole because you understand now i'm going to paraphrase this coming from me in this message do you understand now that your halt lame you can't even get up to get to the pool before somebody else has gotten there you've got nobody to help you but you understand now when you're able to walk and you have perfect health in your body you've got responsibility for that amen you're not going to lay here and beg arms anymore right you're not gonna this is not gonna be your life anymore right you you have responsibility you've gotta get a job you've gotta go to work you've gotta make a living you've gotta have a house you gotta have uh uh bills to pay food clothing you don't just sit there and wait for somebody to hand it to you anymore you've gotta get up and go do it people sometimes get so lazy and so complacent that they say one thing but they really don't want it right because it brings on responsibility they like their lives the way they are they like living the way they live they like to have uh uh everything handed to them or give to them or feel sorry for them or whatever they don't they don't really want to be well and i believe that's one of the questions jesus is asking do you even really want to be well because if you are well now it's going to change your life amen you're going to have to go to work you're going to have to fend for yourself you're going to have to do for yourself you're going to garner upon yourself more responsibility you've ever known in your life or so do you really want this do you want to be well and the responsibility that was given to him jesus laid on him later as we read jesus said well thou be made whole if the man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another step it down before me jesus said unto him rise take up thy bed and walk i believe jesus reached out pulled him up and he received stream amen took up his bed and and left the place and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked on that same day was the sabbath jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed he answered them uh he that made me whole the same the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk then asked him they him what man that which is said unto thee take up thy bed and walk and he and he that was healed was not who it was for jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that place afterward jesus findeth him again we read this now afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold you're now well behold thou art made whole sin no more lest the worst thing come upon thee now over what a responsibility this man received by receiving that healing he received a great responsibility in his life he received responsibility for what jesus had told him and and and implored him even remember the woman who is found uh in the very act of adultery even she was found in the act of adultery they were chasing her down to stone her to death she ran into jesus and jesus began to write they begin to tell him all her sins you know he said well you without sin you cast the first on then you're telling me all about her sin what about your sin if you don't have any sin you can you can kill her throw us and and as she rode on the ground all of them began to drop their stones and walk away he said looked up he said well now where are thine accusers she said lord i have none and he said neither do i condemn thee praise the lord go and sin no more god had liberated her god had delivered her from her sin god had set her free from being put to death by them but god told her go and sin no more don't you go do that again don't live that life anymore the responsibility that you now have from this liberation i have set you free but now you have a responsibility and that is to live the life that is that is godly appropriate life sin no more don't go do what you've been doing i did not set you free just so you could go back into that man's bed i set you free so that you can be liberated to live the right kind of life amen amen and a lot of people had that that stigma that in their in their lives that they look at and they think do i do i really want this amen because remember the bible says to whom much is given much is required amen to whom much is given much is required right so it's to think well god did this great thing yeah but now what is he requiring but see the requiring is not what people want they just want the benefits of it without the responsibility and it doesn't happen that way it doesn't come that way if you want the blessing if you want the deliverance if you want the healing you have to be willing to accept the responsibility that comes with it right amen and that responsibility is a lot of things that people don't want to live up to today oh somebody else will do it somebody else will take care of it that's somebody else's problem everything that happens all around us as human beings is all of our problems yes amen throw a styrofoam cup in the in the wash oh that that's somebody else's problem that'll get washed up somebody will get it eventually well what if everybody in this city threw a styrofoam cup into santa cruz saying oh it'll be somebody else's responsibility then what happens it becomes a nasty cesspool and that's a position a lot of times people's lives end up in they end up in a nasty cesspool and they get a lot of attention people get a lot of attention sometimes oh we're in that uh bad situation and get a lot of attention uh but then then it makes you wonder with with all of this coming now this is this is really maybe not even borderline narcissism this is just flat out narcissism but we know that the world is neurotic brother adam told us the whole back 60 years ago was neurotic right amen the narcissism is just it's the it's the flavor of the day if you will in the world today narcissism has just taken over and it's gotten to that place it's been amplified by social media but that's in the world i'm talking about us i'm talking about godly christians i'm talking about people that sometimes and i'm not talking about here but i have seen that makes me wonder this person asks for something but then they don't really present themselves like that's what they're wanting or expecting right and it makes you wonder why why if they if they're asking for this deliverance or whatever it is and then they don't their their demeanor doesn't make you feel like they that's something they're really looking for they just want a little sympathy or a pat on the back or give them a dollar or two or something then what is because they don't want because they don't want to change they don't want the responsibility of change and that then that becomes uh a wholesale thing that they have that they that some people they just don't want it they become so complacent they'll tell you oh yes i want this i want this deliverance whatever but then when they go back they're like well you know it's just like witnessing to people to be christians people don't want the responsibility of what it takes to live the life of a christian some people say well i you know i i just don't know if i can i said well you just have to surrender it to the lord and let him do it for you amen that's the best thing you can do right because none of us can live it but he can live it through us yes but it's the yielding of that but they're unwilling to give up what they have to give up to have what they need to be pleasing to the lord well if i'm going to be a christian then i have to i have to act like this and talk like this and live like this and wear those clothes and let my hair and blah blah blah and you know and now everything's all superficial look at it and it becomes uh they don't want the responsibility but see they don't understand the responsibility in that case when we give our lives to the lord the responsibility is not mine it's his it's his to live through me now it's mine to take care of the part that the lord that that i would be obedient to that and and it just makes you wonder sometimes do are people like that do they really want that responsibility now in acts chapter 3. acts chapter 3. we'll read this story acts chapter 3 verse 1. amen that's why a lot of times today people don't want to live up to the truth they don't want to face the truth people don't even want to hear the truth because the truth makes them responsible right the truth a lot of times if now remember i'm going to ask the shoe fits wear preacher so if it fits you you wear it whether you're watching or whatever but if if that puts you in in the place of being responsible for it do you really want it or do you not i think that was the bottom line question that god jesus asked the man in the pool of bethesda do you really want to people say they do i want to be a christian but do you want the responsibility that comes with being a christian with being a godly holy ghost filled living a godly life do you really want to be a christian and and people it's like i've said before people want a savior but they don't want a lord they want somebody to save them they want to feel like they've been saved scoured and that's what nicolaitan gives to people nicolaitan gives that religion gives a covering that people can feel they're okay when the bottom line is they've they've entered into a place that they feel okay with no responsibility well that doesn't work with god the relationship is not with a pastor or a priest or church it's with god and it's up to you to live that life and to read and to pray and to do the responsibility that it takes to be the person you're supposed to be a lot of people just don't want that they're not willing to take that amen and don't want to know the truth they don't want to know the truth the truth makes them responsible you know you know pilate tried that trial pilate tried his best to sure shift the responsibility of jesus standing in front of him right probably the worst day he may not have known it but the worst day of pilate's life is when they drug jesus to his front doorstep that's probably the worst day of his life because he didn't know what to do with him he tried to wash his hands of him but he couldn't do it i washed my hands i'm clean of the blood of this man no you're not because you had the power you had the responsibility you could let him go but you chose not to you can't wipe your hands of it and that's the same a lot of people oh i'll wipe my hands so you can't do that it's it falls on you it is your responsibility to take that up for yourself but people don't want to do it what they don't realize is by saying oh i don't want the responsibility and they push it off the responsibility still lays on them the responsibility still stops here it still stops with us regardless of whether we want to face it or not it's still ours right and in the eyes of god it's still ours yes acts chapter 3 verse 1. now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man laying from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid they laid him they carried him and laid him at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple now this man we know by the scripture was this way from his mother's womb from birth he was like this who's seeing peter and john about to go into the temple aston alms that was his daily chore that's that's what he did and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us and he gave head unto them expecting receive something of them then peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have i give thee give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he leaping up stood and walking entered with him into the temple walking and leaping and praising god into the temple praise the lord that showed some character he didn't just get healed and jump and shout and run off home he went into the temple to praise the lord he went into the temple to praise god from whom his healing just came amen so this man received that he took that responsibility now i'm not sitting here anymore i'm doing what i'm supposed to do i'm going into the temple i'm going to go worship the lord walking into the temple walking leaping and praising god you know sometimes i know it's it's to the place that a person receives healing and i think sometimes it depends on their faith but that they uh need to get their strength in their legs they haven't walked before this man never walked he's like this from his mother's womb but when when immediately when that power of god struck that man he leaped up on his feet and he ran into the church this man never run in his life he never jumped in his life he never leaked he didn't know what leaping was except maybe to have seen somebody else but as soon as he got strength immediately he was leaping up and down jumping running dancing praise the lord he didn't say oh now let let me wait and see this is this going to work there's this no he just started jumping and dancing leaping and running to church to praise the lord amen amen and all that came with it all the people saw him walking and praising god and they knew that it was he uh they knew that it was he which set from the beautiful gate of the temple they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him praise the lord but what he did he went to praise god he did first what the most important thing is that you do amen you praise the lord now this man could have sat there and he could have said you know i i'm content where i'm at just give me some money i don't want the responsibility of going in the temple or living my life or having to go get a job tomorrow or any of that just give me some money that's all i want and it's the same thing i had a guy one time we lived in north carolina the guy came up to the door knocked on the door and he said uh do you have any money and i said yeah i got some money he said well could i have some i said well no i said but i got a i have a pile of wood in the backyard back here that i just cut down and and chopped up if you'll bring them and put them in the garage here for me i'll pay you oh have a nice day and he walked off he anyone do anything and he looked like a perfectly perfectly healthy specimen of a man he didn't look like in the invalid or anything he looked like he was perfectly well to work i said no you go and i'll pay you i'll give you uh money if you'll move this over for me wouldn't do it amen i i don't know uh you hear sometimes people say that but do they really mean it right do they do they really mean what they said my wife said one time she said i'm just gonna go out here and i'm gonna put up a sign that says i want all your money and see how many people give me money no god bless you no veteran no not just just give me your money and just see how many people give them money i i she probably probably would still do it give me all your money now without a gun of course give me one and see how many would do it you might still do it i don't know but that's all that a lot of people want and that's all that a lot of people want out of religion it's just a covering that's all they want out of it all all they people become so narcissists that all they want is is the compliments is the is the is the sorrowfulness is the uh the money that's given to them or something like that that's all they want they they don't want the responsibility of what they need to get and i'm afraid that a lot of times now this this isn't all of course uh there's obviously genuine needs and sicknesses and things but i just ran across people again i'm not talking about here but i ran across people that they that you talk to them about something and you you just get the understanding the feel they really don't want to change yes they really don't want to be healed they really don't want their perfect health back they're not they're not concerned with playing a game of basketball or football or golf or they're not concerned with lifting a 50 pound weight or climbing into an attic or under a under a trailer they're not concerned about that they don't care about that so in retrospect they're just happy the way they are they just live their lives and get what they can get out of it and they really don't want to be changed they really don't want to they don't want to be well they don't want to have a job they don't want the responsibility they don't want what it takes that comes with it and unfortunately it's a bad spirit today it's an overcoming spirit actually in in this laodicea my rights what is my rights friend you got no rights i'm just a sheep led by the shepherd right we got no rights amen we belong to god i i relinquished my rights when i called him my lord i relinquish my rights i want all my rights this is the laodicea see me first it's all about me the narcissism all about me and i really want the responsibility that's why you see so many troubles today with trying to get people to take jobs we sat and waited at a restaurant 15-20 minutes to sit down and they got six eight empty tables but they don't have people to watch them they don't have wait staff or cook staff or whatever it is they don't have the people to do it and you look and you see what seems to be perfectly viable humans out on the street perfectly viable humans just staying at home being able to work can do what they should do but they just won't do it i read a statistic a majority of the young generation the gen x or whatever they call millennials whatever they would rather stay at home and do nothing than to have a job they don't like now how many of you here has ever had a job you don't like yeah because you were raised right and you knew what it took that you were supposed to go work and have a job and do what you're supposed to do or something like that but they they just they won't just want to even work well don't do anything even with inflation going up the way it is and it just comes they just don't want the responsibility what they want is to make a six six uh six figure income and work 20 hours a week amen people come into church and they walk out the same as they came in right why because when the word goes forth there's responsibility yes there's a responsibility to all of us probably me most than any of you this responsibility that comes with it sometimes it's not easy but it's necessary right amen i believe it's pleasing to the lord think about jonah for a minute let's read this jonah chapter 1 verse 1 i'm just going to read it we know the story very well now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of uh hematite saying arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the lord and went down to joppa and he found the ship going to tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them into tarshish from the presence of the lord twice it says from the presence of the lord but jonah a horrible time had come god had asked him to do something he just flat out did not want to do again has anybody ever had god tell you to do something you just didn't want to do amen absolutely i have uh several times many times but uh jonah didn't want to go to nineveh he didn't want to go to this wicked place he didn't want to go to the evil to this evil place he wanted the comforts that what he had where he was i don't want to go if i'm going to go anywhere i'm going to try to get away from god and go to tarshish problem is you can't get away from god right because even in this case now it happens differently for all of us and for many through the ages but god in this one time had built a special fish now listen young people and now young people's not here today just told him god the bible does not say now i don't know about no any of these new translations but the real translation of the scripture does not say it was a whale right right and so many times people come and they try to refute this miracle by saying oh there's no way a whale can swallow jonah it does not say it was a whale that's right it says that god spilt a special fish amen right amen he god built a special prepared fish to swallow jonah amen god did this so if this miracle that we expect that god does miracles all the time if he does it he built this fish this one time shot this one-time fish what happened to this fish after he vomited jonah up on and none of it it doesn't say we don't know right but god built this fish special wasn't a whale it was this but now it could have been a whale but it wasn't a whale like we know today but it it was a special built fish and that's the only that's the that's the thing we need to know but people come up and say oh well can't do this wasn't a whale it says it was a special prepared fish by god there's where the miracle comes now how many times has god specially prepared a fish to swallow you not a literal fish but something in your life when you're going along in the way that you're not supposed to go or going in a way where god told you not to go or doing something you know that you shouldn't do and god sends something somebody a bird a fish a whale something and turned you around and put your feet back where they were supposed to be well that's just all god did for jonah it just happened to be that he was on a ship they threw him off the ship and there was that fish that got it prepared for him swallowed him up the best part about it is when he got up to nineveh and this and and jonah walks out from this fish's mouth and the nineveh worshipped the fish they fell down before him and listening anything jonah had to say because a fish had come up and vomited drone out on the land now these men have saw this great big fish and this man that had come out from that fish they would listen to anything he had to say amen praise the lord amen that's the truth amen so if that's what it takes then praise the lord but the point jonah tried to shirk the responsibility of what god was telling him to do god i don't want to do that i'm going to get away from you and go over here god says you can go where you want but there's no place you can run that i'm not there hey bud amen he could have told him right then i've got a fish ready for you when you when they kick you off the boat he'll be right there take you up to see we can't we don't see those things a lot of times the things that god is doing in the workings of the miracles that god is working in our lives we don't see him a lot of times until that actually happened but god is in control of it and that's the best part about it even when he tried to shirk his responsibility god still brought him in the place that he needed to be and god could took care of it for it if god sends you somewhere he's going to prepare where you're going for the purpose that god's looking look at when god sent moses to egypt god sent moses to egypt and told and told moses what to do but then he hardened pharaoh's heart against moses you would think that moses is going there and ready to take the place over as brother brown talked about here i'm ready to take over no god hardened pharaoh's heart there was no way he was going to take over the place he hardened his heart against him well god you're sending me over here i thought you'd i thought you'd have thrown me in and just laid me down in this nice bed of petal rose petals and all this flowery betta bees and i figured everything would just be nice and there'd be a big feather fanning me and grapes and you know and i'm i'm here to take over egypt and this that's is that the way god does things that that wasn't god's plan right but everything that god did and see god's not going to send you somewhere you don't have the strength to be able to overcome it right to be able to take care but god's not going to call something to for you to do in your life that you're incapable of doing amen now it may be something that you don't want to do it may be something you've never done before but god will make sure that when you get there and you obey him that he takes care of the circumstances to give you the strength to be able to follow through with it whatever it is and we've known that to be true in our lives thank god for it they got to give us the strength to be able to do it when we get there lord i don't know what i'm going to say i'll give you the words you just do what i tell you and that's where it comes down to the faith the faith of the responsibility that we have in obedience to god's word just do what i tell you i'll take care of the rest but god what am i going to do i'll show you what to do god what am i going to say i'll give you the words but i can't vote moses said i can't speak lord i'll i'll send aaron he'll be your prophet right and and and he can speak on your behalf but when it was time and god loosened moses tongue he spoke just like the rest of us amen because god can do that god can build a fish even when a man like jonah wants to run from the presence of the lord even when he wants to god's still there to take care of him amen god's still there to to to keep him keep him in his care there's a man i'll close here in just a minute there was a man here i had a few other scriptures but i'm going to go over to matthew now we'll just we'll close this matthew chapter uh chapter 19. very familiar story i'll close after this matthew chapter 19 verse 16. rich run ruler behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life now he's asking this man is literally asking it's a question a lot of people probably wouldn't ask because they don't want to know the answer understand this is a question a lot of people would not ask because they don't want to know the answer right because once you know the answer and you've got the truth you're responsible to that truth yes amen and people want to know as little as possible and that and that's how that's how governments end up taking over countries that's how hitler was able to take over uh in nazis in germany just take over control the people don't ask questions no responsibility burn all the truth amen get rid of free speech uh burn all the books amen only you're only allowed to believe and think and say what we tell you and that's how you took control over it same thing's happening in this country amen then you just do what we tell you and then it's going to be that way it won't get to the germany way because that was a different time this this country will just be destroyed but a lot of people won't even ask this question but he asked the question so the responsibility is about to come what good thing that shall i do that i may have eternal life now remember this is a man who's rich he's a young man earned a living he's a deeds oriented person obviously because most people of wealth unless they've inherited it are deeds oriented people they've they've gotten or obtained their wealth from the from the sweat of their brow the work of their hand or idea or something they they they've gotten it this way so they're a deeds oriented person so this is a this is obviously a deeds oriented man because he's saying what good thing can i do because he wants to he wants to do a deed to be able to earn eternal life right but there's not a deed you can do to earn eternal life amen in fact there's nothing anybody any human can do to earn eternal life right it's a free gift and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is god but if thou will now this is the same question he asked the man that the pool of bethesda if you will it's your choice enter into life keep the commandments he said unto him which jesus jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and mother and and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the young man said unto him all these things have i kept from my youth up what lack i get so he's a good man good boy good person probably an upstanding deacon in his local assembly probably gave faithful tithe offering probably was in attendance at every service led songs or whatever he did so he was a good person kept the commandments did everything that he was because he's a deeds oriented man so he did everything that the deeds required from him but now jesus required something more said unto him again if thou will if you will now it's if you want to he's your free moral agent you have the choice i'm going to give you the truth but you have the choice to make now the responsibility is about to follow him if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou has give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me the one thing that he loved the most his money was what the lord was requiring of him because that was what was standing between him and god that's what was standing between him and eternal life now that he knows the truth he's responsible to the truth right he has to to to be able to receive what he's asking of he has to do what the lord just told him to do that's the only way to do it come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions jesus said unto his disciples verily i say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter in the kingdom of heaven and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god he didn't say it was impossible right he just said it's very difficult very challenging amen because of the reasoning now different circumstances with different people but reasoning based on what the rich young ruler just went through what he just went through fall in line with everyone that jesus is referring to every circumstance different that's why not impossible he didn't say it couldn't happen he just said it's very difficult because that mammon becomes their god when his disciples heard it they were exceeding amaze saying who then can be saved well i don't know what it was like then and how much money the disciples had there's a lot of people i know that aren't rich that don't have to worry about this situation they're like who can be saved if only the rich people is like i have a camel going through the eye of a needle well i'm not rich so i i don't know anybody here that is rich i guess maybe by some standards some certain world standards we might be but by the our standards here in this country we're not by any means rich they said who can be saved jesus said unto them and say unto them with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible all things are possible now are we willing to receive accept fall under the responsibility that god is called in in all of our lives not just as christians but even just as human just even as as people to receive and accept that responsibility for what it takes to do i want to be a christian that comes with a responsibility amen am i willing to do what the lord wants me to do yes am i willing to follow the word am i willing to listen to the truth am i willing to let that word live through me yes become that word in my life am i willing to uh to take on the responsibility of what it takes to try to help others to try to witness to others to try to help be a soul winner that others may come and receive what i have yeah am i willing to receive the responsibility of of living up to these uh these standards that god has set before us did you imagine think about think about if moses had not taken that responsibility let's we could even get closer to home think about it brother branham was unwilling to accept that responsibility what would this bride be like today right amen what if moses moses had 2 million people that he had fallen around the desert 2 million think about that and with women and children how many that multi-millions we don't even know for sure then there multi millions of people that he had depending on him relying on him listening to his word following where he took them why i think about the incredible responsibility that god has laid on me as a pastor of a church to give to you the truth that i believe he gives to me but then to think two million people think about this for a moment there was a brother at the minister's meeting yesterday they had been in the military and he talked about um how the military changes you i grew up of course hunting fishing handling guns i know how to handle guns a lot of people might not but i know how to handle guns he grew up handling guns he had a handle ghost but when he got to the military it changed his life first thing they taught him he said was to check your weapon because first thing you need to know is that weapon have any a bullet in it something that could harm somebody harm something or harm you yes check and make sure clear it and he talked about that in a spiritual application of uh the type of weaponry bullets that that go in that gun out if you're hunting different guns for different game different bullets sometimes for different game even with the same gun i've hunted with the same gun but for different game i used a different bullet and i got the thought and i wrote it down and gave it to him he seemed to like it i said bullets of the truth kill the enemy but bullets of lies kill each other amen and if and if a lie goes forth and somebody believes it now this is responsibility yeah if a lie goes forth and somebody believes it and that person tells 10 more people that believe it and those 10 people tell 10 more people that believe it just from that one lie moses had over 2 million people responsible to him god help us now you know why i stay in prayer because of a responsibility that falls in this position to make sure and do everything that i feel the lord gives and tells because it's it's a great responsibility and i take it as such wouldn't do it if it wasn't no way amen i remember i'll close with this i remember brother gray back 12 15 years ago people would come to other marina try to get him actually maybe even longer than that try to get brother green put him on a salary now other ministers do that and whatever they every church is sovereign however they feel to do but tried to put brother green on a salary and he said and brother greece how much do you think pastoring this church and all these people how much do you think that's worth i said oh i i think that's probably worth maybe 80 000 a year he says i wouldn't even consider even walking through the door for 80 000 a year now i don't have no clue how much money went through their eye or or how much you made i had no idea but i know brother green was the most giving man i'd ever met in my life brother green i guarantee you brother green probably gave more than he got i don't know how you do that but uh that's what you look for he probably gave more than he got they said he said i wouldn't walk through the door for you though did you imagine the responsibility think about i made the comment and i told him to his face i told the whole church i believe brother green was one of the greatest men ever lived i still believe that i'll probably believe that little dad died nothing i've ever heard even with all of his failures and mistakes nothing i ever heard to change that opinion of mine i believe it's one of the greatest to ever live because of the result and you think about all of that around the world and all the places gone ministers churches established message taken around the world apart even from the tabernacle i think mine the responsibility it's a great responsibility people want to be critics so quick to be critics but you think about the responsibility that falls there and ask yourself would i be willing to take that responsibility would i be willing to do that amen it is it's a great responsibility but but that's why that's why god placed ephesians 4 that's why god raised us and put us in the places and give us the gifts and the the the gifts of the spirit the things god give us for all of us for the edifying of the body it's not just a pastor teacher or fivefold ministry it's all of us we're all responsible amen every one of us are responsible if there ever was a time saints we were to shake a loose of this spirit of laziness and complacency it is today yes because we're about this bride is about to do something that has never been done by a wholesale group ever that we know of scripture there's been people raptured but of course we know that we've taught on that there's been people raptured but never where you see a whole cell catching away of god's people at one time like it's what's about to happen yes the responsibility that falls on us because we're part of that yes amen you're part of that then that responsibility is yours whether you want it or not it's mine whether i want it or not and i do want it i welcome it but not to be complacent lazy of the things that's going on in the world today and god blesses us god blesses us for it saints amen i'm thankful for that you realize that through this whole pandemic me and brother jeff we're talking about this yesterday this whole pandemic god has blessed and increased us as a congregation and personally and in our own personal lives people have been suffering and doing without and having it having to go to a waiting three hour long lines at a food bank or something god has blessed us and i'm so thankful yes amen god's good to us let's stand if we could i'm willing i want to amen what does it take lord yes what does it take whatever it takes us what we'd be willing we should be willing to do amen help us lord yes sir praise the lord amen let's sing this little course here we could feel my cup lord fill my cup lord want it filled today yes amen you want your cup filled that just shows that there's something in you calling but now when god fills it he brings responsibility for what you do with it [Music] amen what are you gonna do with it praise the lord let's sing it feel [Music] is [Music] is [Music] i

uh may 15th is a sunday so hopefully people still streaming may 15th is a sunday um i want to buy all of your lunch at golden corral on may 15. i want to try to talk to golden corral to see if we can get the room in the back i don't know if we'll get the whole route to ourselves we don't really need the whole room but at least the corner of it were you know we said 20-25 people so it just i just feel like after all the talking about it and everything just simplify it and make it maybe a little easier on the sisters but um just sunday may 15 will if you can and want to go to the golden corral on thornydale uh after church and i want to treat everybody's lunch it'll be our sixth it'll be the church's sixth anniversary and then last year we did the barbecue at the hotel but this this if people say well it's expensive don't worry about it if god can create a well he can create money to pay for your lunch don't worry about it uh we'll go golden corral i noticed some don't like it so much but um it seems like it's a nice facility to to be in the room where we can all sit together and hopefully i'll again i'll talk to them and make sure they accommodate that we can sit together like that um on sunday may 15th i can't remember if that's the exact day we started uh no it wouldn't be would it because it takes seven years to be the same day that we started it was a leap year i don't remember i can look it up but may 15th sunday uh after church all who want to keep can and can we're going to have a lunch at the golden corral make
