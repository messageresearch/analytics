I enjoy life I love life but when it's over oh just let me see Jesus hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus amen let's stand to our feet now if we could we'll turn over in the scripture amen and start the next part of our series here in Matthew Chapter 5 amen Matthew Chapter 5 we'll read just one verse in chapter five amen praise the Lord thankful to be in the house of the Lord today amen thank for the Lord's grace and mercy to us amen praise the Lord Jesus St Matthew Chapter 5 1 verse 48 amen 548 we don't know it very very well been quoting it quite a bit over the past few weeks just figured we would start this part of it with that with actually reading that scripture so but before we do let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could precious Lord Jesus we're so very thankful again of another beautiful day that you give us thank you for a place again Lord I don't ever ever want to take for granted Lord that you blessed us with this place that we can come in from out of the world father and meet with you and for you to speak to us Lord if we worship you and come in from out of the world and have this atmosphere that we feel created around us Lord knowing that your spirit is here today knowing that you promised we're two or three were together in your name you would be in the midst knowing god that we come here Lord with a song on our lips and a praise in our heart for you believing God that you're going to be honored and worship through our praise and through our honor to you God through our worship Lord Jesus Lord knowing that you're here father makes every bit of it oh so worth it God for without you none of it would mean anything but Lord we believe that you're here today God may you just continue to move in this service in a supernatural way God may you continue to bless us and strengthen us and anoint us Lord for the word that is to come now believing Lord that it's going to come from you through our lips Lord and Lord to our ears God anoint our ears anoint the lips speak only what you'd have to be said today shut my lips anything that should not be said God but just believing you in complete total control the Holy Spirit to use us according to your glory and honor accomplish that in this service today Father what would be your perfect will for it Lord Lord you set it aside you predestinated it we're just fulfilling the part Lord that you already manifested for us here and Lord just believing God we're here for that purpose we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt H or infiltrate this service in any way that you God would get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done we thank you for it all Lord thank you for those that have come Lord those who may be streaming or those who may even be watch archive God bless them richly as well I pray may your will be done father in all that we do and say we commit it to you now in the precious holy and lovely name of our Lord and savior we pray amen amen amen s Matthew 5 verse 48 Matthew 5:48 simply says be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect you can be seated if You' like then how many times of course we've gone over and went through and recognized that that is not a sinless Perfection but it is a Perfection that means of a full age or maturity or a mature Christian amen and I said I read that specifically to start this because of the scriptures that we're going to read Hereafter amen several of them are going to point back and refer to uh the understanding that we have here of what that word perfect means as it is used several times in the New Testament amen we mentioned last week and we will get to again uh there is a different Perfection amen that is a have reached a fullness or a comp completion if you will can't say that we have reached a comp a state of completion but we can say we reach a place of spiritual maturity in the Lord amen but not completion that's where Jesus is that's where uh that word uh that is introduced in the scripture referring to him as being perfect praise the Lord not just mature but uh of completion of perfection of sinless perfection amen but but uh as we go through it we'll see the the the several times that we find this in the scripture here as we read through today so we had uh three parts I believe it was of we're growing in Grace knowledge so we'll start today on uh the thought of maturity so this is adoption part six maturity part one so as we do that let's go over to First Corinthians now uh chapter 2 we'll try to begin to draw our context for these from these next few scriptures beginning with 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse one Corinthians 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse one notice as we're going to probably get to uh it was just a thought the lord gave me this morning to maybe a direction to go outside of the notes and things that already had so we'll see how that happens I want you realize or let's notice recognize that there were actually two letters sent to the Corinthian Church amen two so there's purposes to everything so uh I believe there's a purpose to that but in the first letter second chapter first verse and I Brethren when I came unto you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God now why didn't he come to them speaking wisdom amen continue on for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified that is a a wonderful aspiration for any of us to attain to amen and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power amen that your face should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God which would lead me to believe that Paul is making this a specific example of the Corinthian Church to to to give us a an understanding that the Corinthian Church would have been subject to the the the the man the the wisdom of men amen and and brought and swayed by the wisdom of great words and great orator and great speech that would lead me to believe because he said I didn't come to you this way amen now look I say this for a reason there's a reason that we understand um uh that how we speak now let's go back my speech uh my speech was and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom amen why not amen why wasn't it why didn't his speech come to the Corinthian Church with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of spirit and power because you know Saul is intelligent as this man was learning at the feet of Gia could have absolutely come to them with great words of wisdom he could have done it but he didn't to the Corinthian Church so why did me now again would lead me to believe that they would that they would have come subject to that if he had come in that way amen but he came with a demonstration of spirit and power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God which means that they may have let their faith be in a man instead of God yes amen so he came to them the way he came recognizing the need of that church God knowing the need of that specific Church there's always a reason see why God has people in certain places there's a reason why God has certain men rise up uh to Pastor maybe a large group maybe a small group maybe a medium-sized group but God puts everybody where he wants them if you belong to him now if you don't it's just a church of the world or a non Goodall Pastor whatever it might be then it really doesn't matter but in God's economy he puts everybody where he wants them to be where they should be and because when Paul even when Paul now Paul said I I I become all things to all men that I might that I might win some now we're I want to go over in a few minutes and look at something because I want to finish this reading here and recognize the difference in the way Paul speaks to different churches right amen so there's a reason he said this to tell them that to recognize that their faith could have been drawn into the wisdom of man instead of the power of God right amen so now let's continue how be it sixth verse how be it we speak with wi uh how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect so what's he telling them you are not a mature church because that perfect is the same perfect that we just read in Matthew 5:48 it's the same word full mature full age mature so he says how be that we speak wisdom among them that are perfect but he just told them that he didn't speak to them in wisdom so what's he telling them he's telling them they're not a mature church right because he said I would have come in in in in speaking with wisdom but I wanted your faith to lie in the power of God but or how be it we do speak wisdom among them that are mature those that are perfect so uh he's really literally letting them know uh I'm I'm bringing it to you this way because you are not a mature church and you can't receive it you don't give a little baby a T-bone steak you give a little baby a milk bottle because because that's all they can stomach right if they're young enough that's all they can even chew because they're not ready for meat their body's not ready for it their systems not ready for it they can't they can't digest it they can't absorb it well Paul's telling them the same thing here I did this because you're not ready for it I do speak in wisdom to those that are mature to those that are perfect but you're not a perfect or mature church right amen that's right we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world not the wisdom of the world now the wisdom of God you go and look it up it just means those things that God brings to in harder to understand or harder to know spiritual truths is what the wisdom is those things that are maybe harder to understand harder to uh to uh believe those things he does Paul said we speak these things to those that are perfect because they can receive it but those that are not cannot receive it not the wisdom of the world though the wisdom of God nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden Mystery which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not I have crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written I Has Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither had entered into the heart of man the things that uh which God had prepared for them that love him praise God amen amen but God hath received them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yeay the Deep things of God or the meaty things the more wisdom things the things that are are hidden to the wise and prudent the things that are revealed to babes the things that are revealed to those that are of perfect mature full age maturity God has revealed to us by his Spirit those things the spirit searches those things amen the things of God the Deep things of God the things that are hard to understand the things like John 6 when Jesus come to them and he spoke to them he went on about and they and basically he talked about uh uh being born again he talked about uh the way they were to live and all and they come up and basically said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part of me and they said this is a hard say who can hear this well those that are mature those that are perfect those that are grown in the word of God Amen in the wisdom of God in the truth of God in the in the knowledge of God those who God has revealed to them those that God has spoken to them those that God has uncovered that mystery manifested it to them they can understand amen amen now notice the 12 disciples weren't even to that place yet right amen but Peter had enough sense to the rest of them to stand and say you have the words of eternal life where are we going to go we know that you have the words of eternal life don't understand it amen it may be on the Shelf over here may I may not quite gotten the Revelation that yet amen may not quite understand it but you had the words of eternal life and that's good enough for us amen whatever you say we believe not understand maybe but we believe amen we believe it praise the Lord now from there again like we said before you they grew they grew in the grace and knowledge and as continued to grow in the grace and knowledge they got uh closer to the Lord and those things God began to unveil unveil to them and revealed to them and when they got it and it it came and you can stick that puzzle piece right where it belongs and it becomes a beautiful picture amen they got to that point those disciples came to that point amen not all 12 of them but U because one of them sold the Lord and for 30 pieces of silver so yeah he didn't but the others they came to that point Peter himself when he said those you had the words of eternal life you might understand but when it came as he came along he came to the point that yeah he it became revealed to him he began to see it he began to talk about it and write about it and it's in the scripture we can read about it now because he finally came to that place where they understood now first uh First Corinthians uh the same First Corinthians the third chapter he continues on the letter but I want to skip that last those last few verses and just go to uh the third chapter first verse third chapter first verse and I be and I Brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual now he's telling them as he already told them right uh I speak wisdom to those that are mature you're not mature I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as babes in Christ I have fed you with milk and not with me for hither to ye were not able to Bear whether yet now or are ye able for ye are not for for ye are yet carnal whereas there is among you envs and stripes and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men for while one saith I'm of Paul another I'm of apoll are you not carnal of course they haven't grown up enough to realize that they said well this one said this and this one and these were baptized by this and this and baptized by that one and this one I belong to him so you're not a Christian because you don't belong to this church well you're not in the message because you don't go where I go and and all this that's just pettiness amen pettiness carnality pettiness stuff that doesn't mean anything in the economy of God if any of has to be done or said let God do it not me it's not your position to tell a brother that he's out of the will of God because he's not going to your church or not doing what you think he should you let him alone and let God take care of it God will handle him in the way he's supposed to be handled that's just childish they can't grow because they can't understand and that's why Paul said them I only fed you with milk because you you're not mature enough to handle the meat of the word if I gave you the meat of the word it would choke you to death right you couldn't stand it amen so what he had to do he had to handle them with with kid gloves right amen now I want you to notice a stark difference here let's go over to Ephesians chapter 1 and notice a very Stark difference we read a lot of the first chapter of Ephesians now Corinthians had to have two letters written to them they did eventually begin to get uh to gain a little maturity towards the end but look I want you to see how how he spoke to them and how he speaks to the Ephesian church amen two different things really amen it's he he goes to One Church it reminds me sometimes of of things you listen to when you listen to brother brandham and he might have a three or four uh uh sermons three or four uh meetings with the same sermon the same title but if you listen to them you can catch some notes that are the same but really in a lot of times when they're in different churches and different venues with different people you listen to them and and sometimes you don't even think it's the same it's the same topic he's talking about it the same he might read the same scripture or give a same note or something here or there but the message goes a total different direction because he's speaking to a whole different group of people right he's speaking to a people that may have not been mature and this group is mature this group needed this or this group needed that and they all were in different places and they all had different things and and it was different things going in all of these churches in all of their lives and God knows that and if a man is controlled by God and God's the one Speaking then you know God is the one in control amen that's right then God then God speaks to each individual each Church the way they need to be spoke to amen look at this in in Ephesians brother uh uh Paul starts talking about right off the bat the will of God in the first CH in the first verse of the first chapter he talks about the will of God God and then before we even get out of the fourth verse he's talking about being chosen from the foundation of the world do you hear anything preached like that to the Corinthian Church no in the first four verses he's talking about the will of God predestination and being chosen from the foundation of the world things that he never even taught to the Corinthian Church why because they could would accept it right they could not receive it they were not a mature enough group of people to receive those truths amen you know there's a lot of things that we talk about as Believers there's a lot of Christians Believers there's a lot of things that we preach there's a lot of things that we hear and it becomes maybe unfortunately maybe sometimes a little common to us about the things that we know in this message you go and talk about you go go find a a a friend on the street or something even another Christian I challenge you go down to Calvary or go down to this Baptist Church down the street and ask them do you know what the Seven Seals are they would look at you like a mule looking at a new gate they have no idea what you're talking about right they look like they look like you as cross- sided as a man that got kicked in the back of the head with by a horse right what is Seal what are you talking about they have no idea we think that's common to us amen so understand God allows you to receive something that a lot of the world C could not receive they could not only see it they can't or not only receive it they could even see it amen so you realize that God does things for us and you think oh my what are the Deep things of God we know what they are yes praise the Lord we know what God has spoke to us we know what God feeds us you see the difference now in in the fifth ver from the 5th to the 14th verse Paul talks to him about predestination he talks to him about Redemption he talks about the mysteries of God he talks about the coming of the fullness of times and inheritance he talks about being born again he talks about how receiving the Holy Spirit and the earnest in the down payment just in before half of the first chapter things that he never would have spoke to the Corinthian Church about right why they could not receive it they weren't mature to receive it amen that's why that's why I Think Jesus prayed father I thank you that you hid those things from the wise and prudent but revealed them to babes such as would learn most if not all of the message that we talk about and that we preach and that we listen to you go to to the local Methodist Church down the street and they would throw you out on your ear amen they would think that you're complete lunit toe you've lost your mind amen you have no idea what you're talking about why because they can't receive it right they're just happy to hear that this BL that the sky blue and the grass is green amen that's why excuse me I I hate to call his name but I'm going to do it anyway that's why Joel o is so popular and people like him oh it's just everything is sweet and lovely everything is great and beautiful everything is blue skies and green grass everything is lovely and you know you're just great and you just just be a good person and you know everything's going to be all right you know and oh hogwash that's right amen that that that's just that ain't even milk that that's 1% I don't even drink 1% I had one time usually I I'll tell you we we go the hotels we go to a lot of times they don't have milk they have little cartons and I go and have a bowl of cereal almost every morning so I grab I grab a carton and I get my cereal one morning I pour it out didn't even realize cuz every other place has at least 2% I poured it out in the bowl and I started I said what is this nasty stuff I looked on the cart and it's 1% I threw it in garbage I can't stomach that stuff it's nasty I'm sorry if you like 1% you have to drink 1% that's okay maybe some of us should drink 1% but I can't stomach I can't stand it it's just horrible to me that's just that's that's barely this side of water and I mean it just might as well put water tap water in your cereal and just eat it it's just horrible to me but that's these people they is spiritually speaking probably couldn't even take 1% I mean just the equl of milk in their beverage would probably send them flying I I feel sorry for any pastor of any kind of church like that got a little Revelation from God and tried to bring it their congregation keep him out faster than he could go they wouldn't have any they wouldn't stand for that you can't smoke your cigarettes oh my goodness you can't go drink your your liquor oh yeah I mean you're You're gone you can't go party you can't do oh my you start calling out about Sin yeah and we're not even talking about things like sisters dress and hair and men being gentlemen and and living Godly lives I mean forget about that you understand but see there Paul Paul understood when and and I said understood to the point that God revealed it to him because why did we read what did we talk about the last twoes amen a a a vessel that is Anointed of God that is sent by God is going to stay on the word of God Amen if you got somebody like that that stays on the word of God you come to a place and you realize these people can't take it so he gives them milk but what does he do to the Ephesian Church in the first 14 verses he goes into more word and more depth of the word than he did in two letters to the entire Corinthian Church and both letters in the first 14 verses to the Ephesians so you see the difference in between a mature church and a non-mature church right that's why he told him I could not come to you with meat I could not come to you with revealed truths of the deepness of the word I could not come to you with with things that it would choke you to death right I could not come to you that way so I had to come to you with meat milk why did I have to do that because you're just carnal you are still fussing over who belongs to who and who baptized who and who their favorite preacher is and who their favorite convention preacher is and who their favorite oh my yeah I I just I I just don't like that stuff I'm sorry I got friends I know it's around the message and stuff and um I'm just I'm just not a fan of that I'm just not there's certain meetings that go on around the country every day different churches different places and I can guarantee you within certain within a certain aspect of eror they're the six same ministers are going to preach in every one of those meetings right why I'm sorry I I'm not popular because of it but I think that's just that's wrong I I I just I just don't like that don't agree with that I understand maybe their reasoning amen cuz they get more people because a certain person is uh uh their favorite preacher or something if a man is preaching the word of God it doesn't matter if it's coming from God it doesn't matter he's a great oror if he's beautiful handsome looking man or has a great big church or of great following or something if God speaking then he is going to speak to your heart yeah if you're willing to receive it if you don't want to receive it that's up to you and some people won't receive anything that's spoken by another minister right don't care how true it is no matter how right it is makes me wonder who really is bride and who really isn't amen who is really born again and who really isn't yes if you're born again that word's going to feed you amen even if it is milk a milk that we consider milk of the message it's still going to feed you right cuz you know when I eat a good steak I still wash it down yes I I don't just eat steak I do wash it down whether it's water or milk or Coke or tea or something I still wash it down amen but some people you I well anyway it's just this it's it's just that spirit I don't I don't like that spirit amen if you go around you see there probably the it's like the sex the same sick people pretty much in most meetings speaking all the time starting to evolve and change a little bit but then is changing over to another different six group group of six people and I I just anyway that's something I just don't understand but you see the difference in the maturity levels amen now notice and God will only entrust look God will only entrust with you the Authority or power that matches your maturity level notice God will not entrust power without character is satanic God's not going to give you a full power control of that Spirit people say I can speak the word and they're and they're little babes in the word they're still immature that I'm sorry that's not God's not going to trust you with something that you're not able to handle right amen he entrusts us with things that match our maturity level and we get to that place let me just give you an example real quick when I first started the job that I'm working now I would go and one of the first things that was spoke to me outside of hey how you doing welcome to team blah blah blah was go get me a dead blow you know what I did I went to the trailer having absolutely no clue what I was doing I didn't know what a dead blow was from anything never heard it spok in my life all it is is a mallet it's just a like a plastic real hard plastic Mallet in instead of a instead of a hammer so when you hit on something it doesn't damage it uh if you if you have to knock a the our stainless still arches over use a dead blow because if you use a hammer it marks up the it marks up the arch dead go go get me dead blow I had no idea I went I went to the trailer looking for a dead blow now he's he's speaking gibberish to me something as simple as a a wood a a a a plastic hammer is that simple but I still had no idea what he's talking about cuz I hadn't learned what that was I just started I'd never had any kind of experience with that before but I went to the trailer anyway and I first time I've ever been in the trailer there just stuff all over the place I'm like what am I even looking for I have no idea I was hoping to see a sign or a sticker or something that said what he said I finally somebody came out there and said what you looking for and so I told him he said oh it's down here so I grabbed it and you know from that day on I know exactly what a deblo is I know where it is I know what it is I know where it goes in every trailer I know exactly see now because I've learned that right amen and once you learn that then it's no longer a secret to amen amen you know what it is so it's nothing and I and and through the couple even a couple years even once in a while now couple of the people that's been there a while so they'll start talking about things and I'm just yeah yeah I have no idea what they're talking about what is this gadget what is it you called this I may know what it is but I don't know what the technical term is and know this what what is he talking I have no idea but you know I'm good at faking it I am I I admit it I'm good at faking it and then after a little while another situation arises and something comes up and something have oh okay that's what they were talking about and then I got it and I know what they're talking about I know what it's called I know where it goes I know how to off and I got it and after that I've learned I don't have to learn again amen I don't have to learn again I went from the milk of a dead blow to the to the meat of a a a a a switch or something uh whatever it is something that's a lot more important something that's a lot more meaningful but once you learn it you learned it you've got it it's there praise the Lord I know what it is now now I can go tell somebody else now I can go teach somebody else you know what I do though I don't assume the first person on the job for the first week to know what a deadblow is I tell them because it wasn't told to me but I know now that if I want to get a deadblow and I want this person to help me get it while I'm doing this I tell them what it is and where it is and how to get it right so there's no ambiguity just a different way of teaching but it's a different way that people learn but I tell them now see but it's it's the it's the different levels that you come to amen you can entrust me with this dead blow on my first day but don't you dare trust me with this bulkhead on the first day because I might ruin the whole the I might ruin the whole place right you might can entrust me with a drill here to put a hole in the piece of concrete don't you dare try to have me wire up this uh Master Control Center cuz I'll blow up the whole place because I don't know I haven't reached that place amen but once somebody's been with you remember our tutor and said and taught you and that you learn and that you listen that you that that God reveals it and you accept it and and it it becomes a part of you then you can do it amen now somebody tells me dead blood know where it is somebody this valve I know what it is tell me this the master control center I know where this wire goes and how this does this and I know all that about it now amen I might even can teach somebody else how to do it now amen because I know but I wasn't trusted it's like I'm sure Zach tapa don't give Ruth their car keys and tell them to pull the car around for us it's time to go they don't do that they don't even do that for Joel and he's about to turn 11 but he's not old enough yet but when he gets old enough he's going to be grabbing the car keys to go go take and do drive somewhere with it amen at least that's the way I was amen because he's just too young God will not entrust he only will entrust with us that that matches our maturity level amen that because the last thing we want to do is to be choked out a lot of people just get choked out you can't get choked out I remember uh uh uh a brother I think it was brother Wilson maybe told me one time I can't remember I shouldn't called his name it might not have been him but somebody told me one time that uh uh they went to a church there was a guest speaker and a new person just come now I don't remember if it was a new convert if it was her first service somebody invited her I'm not sure but she came in she had really short hair her hair was all cut off and the preacher got up there and just for 30 40 minutes blasted women in short hair I don't know I don't remember the story if that woman ever came back but why why you choke that woman to death amen you you choke her out on the very first 30 minutes of preaching to her yeah don't do thaten you could have killed her right there you could have lost every opportunity to help that lady come to Christ amen just get her to Christ God will show her about her hair just get her to Christ amen but I may have been Wilson I can't remember he spent not now Wilson didn't do it he told me a a minister I don't even I don't even think the name was spoken of who the minister was but you understand she wasn't at the maturity level to receive that at least especially not in that context not in that way amen so you choke a person out then what if you have praise the Lord see the god the gifts and callings of the gifts and callings of God are without repentance or it says actually I think the scripture actually says the gifts and calling gifts plural calling singular amen we had there's many gifts but there's one calling amen that we have in our lives now let's go over to Peter first Peter of course Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift so uh gifts and callings without repentance brother B says Christ revealed in his own word people so confused today about the evidence of the Holy Ghost why aren people confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost whether then or now and I would say they still are there's a lot of people that are so confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost why would they be so confused probably by listening to non-call Holy Ghost filled men preaching right is probably the biggest reason amen Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift that God has got but he cannot bring that word word by word right that's maturity that's where he failed in the Garden of Eden and that's where he will always fail and there I say bring it down that's that's where people fell today amen they can speak in tongues or prophesy or have some kind of a gift but where where the rubber meets the road is where the word comes amen where the word meets the word it's got to be word upon word line upon line precept on precept here the L A little amen that's why brother B's talking about the the tapy priests on anointed ones at the end time they're Anointed with the spirit speak in tongues dance shout pre preach the gospel and still be a devil amen preach the gospel and still be a devil it's the inside now remember Jesus said all the fathers give me will come to be no one can come except the father call him draw him first amen praise the Lord that's why he entrusts us with those with with the things that he entrusts us on our maturity level amen praise the Lord first Peter now I had you go to First Peter correct chapter 2 verse one First Peter chapter 2 verse1 wherefore laying aside all malice and all G and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speaking that's a great lesson for milk so it's a nice milky lesson yes you know get outside and forget about your carnality your Humanity you know we talked about it being sticky sure it is but when it ever become okay to have a grudge against somebody yeah or uh Envy or hypocrisies lay all that stuff aside Peter saying remember Peter grew too from the time where he said you have the words of eternal life see Peter grew too wherefore laying aside now all malice all Gile hypocrisies envies all evil speaking as newborn babies desire the sincere sincere mil of the word that ye may grow thereby if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom calling as living unto a uh as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious amen of the word of God praise the lord it's a place that God's trying to get us all to newborn babies desire the sincere milk amen sincere milk so it helps us to understand there is that that is of sincerity right praise the Lord now I know brother B said we could be sincerely wrong but this is not what Peter's talking about he's talking about actually being sincere wanting to grow wanting to receive what you can receive and get all that you can get and continue to grow I remember when I first came in the message sort of like U like I was talking about with the work situation that I have was in um I remember when I first started coming to message there were things that was said I didn't understand and I and I basically grew up in the message I I used to my mom and dad went to work I'd go lie in their bed and turn on their tape recorder and just lay in their bed and listen to it as a kid like Joel's age 10 11 12 years old I just sat there and listened to it I learned uh not to kiss a girl before we got married might have done it shouldn't have but but she'll tell you we did uh but because you know back in condition you don't think anything about it and you just you know you you walk away from but I knew that I knew I knew that you weren't supposed to uh even hug another girl right another woman cuz she puts that in print I heard brother B talk about that amen one of my favorite messages was blind Bar M by the way and I knew that in school so I never went to take another girl and bring her in amen basically the whole High School I loved Sonia and that was uh we weren't always together but I I loved her and I believe she was going to be my wife U people would laugh at us and joke at us as was a sophomore she was a freshman oh y'all are going to get married blah blah blah and she shaking her head you know uh makes she get Whiplash and I'm sitting there there quietly saying yeah we and myself I didn't say it out loud I didn't say no cuz I sit there CU I knew I just knew how do you know I don't know you know you just know when you know you know you know you know you know well when you know see I think I'm sent with a bunch of people that know what I'm talking about yes you know I knew and when I knew I knew it didn't matter what anybody else said they were making fun she was saying no and I was saying it myself yes we are I don't know why I just did and she had never intended to get married she had never intended to have kids but when God takes over when things happen you know praise the Lord it it it all works in the Lord not not that even at that time we were serving the lord we did when we started having children but when we got together and got married and all we weren't serving the lord we weren't Christians but see these things I knew I still knew I never would take another girl into my bosom cuz I knew that that wasn't right I listen I heard brother randam say that when I was a little kid like Joel and uh Gabriel's age I heard that and I knew it was right and I never said brother B said that makes an imprint on you amen and I knew that so I didn't do it praise the Lord except for my wife because that and those things just come and and and and and and even at that but when I first gave my heart to the Lord and got born born again and there were still things the preachers would say that I wasn't I remember the first time I heard the term manifested sons of God I didn't know what that was amen I went along with it now I can go home and study and say you know look and see what it is what what are they talking about see you understand what I'm saying but as you grow and as you get older see now none of those things it's not like that's a a a surprise or something that I don't know amen I still have things on my shelf as I'm sure all of you do but those things that you grow the Lord entrust you with amen and you become uh you become a grown mature Christian Jesus Christ learned the things by which he suffered amen we read that last week we saw that him being made perfect and that perfect was not a grownup mature perfect but it was a a fulfillment or bring to an end or to complete I've got it here and mean that's what that perfect he's talking about Jesus in MA in uh Hebrews 5 was that perfect he was perfect sinless Perfection completed amen and while he was at Calvary and gave up his gave up the ghost He before he said it is finished it's complete it's done the work is over praise the Lord because it was done done the work was over amen he had done what he was sent here to do and the Lord did it through him praise the Lord amen I got one more scripture I want to read and I'm going to close first Corin back over to 1 Corinthians chapter 13 praise the Lord 1 Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 8 amen charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail amen amen gifts and callings of God the gifts and calling of God of God Amen not like we said last week where someone just wants to keep somebody in their church and they appoint them a job no the gifts and calling of God are without repentance charity never fails but where there's prophecies that they shall fail you know the one thing that won't fail the word amen the word will never fail amen prophecies will fail where there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away but what won't vanish away what won't fail what won't do uh uh cease is the word amen because Christ is the word amen for we know in part and we prophesy in part in in part that's means imp portions brother ROM talked about the the the reformers if you will to each age He said Each one had their had their message and they they doubted at the truth and each one took and they hit on truth and they left it out there there was certain things that of course they didn't hit but they spoke to their level at that time amen that's why this day is the day that the bride is to reach full maturity amen we're not in we're not in smia we're not in thara we're not in Philadelphia we're not even in leod deia friend we're in the bride age amen and this is a time that the bride is to be a mature bride remember Christ did not marry a child he married a mature woman amen mature woman going home amen as a mature woman praise the Lord but we know part in part now they had their part but when the prophet of this day came there was no more in part he took all those parts that were left out there from all those reformers and he brought them all together and he and he rightly divided the word out to say this was truth this was not this was right this was wrong they had a part truth but they had a part wrong they had the had a part and he took all those truths and he brought them all down people think that serpent SE was only came out in brother B's message that's not true at all people have been preaching serpent seed for thousands of years amen it just took this last day Prophet to reach out there and grab it and say this is true Saints amen amen and we know and Believe by Vindication of a prophet that what he spoke to us was God's word and we we read it in the Bible it witnesses to us when God reveals it to us it becomes real yes amen it's not just a witness anymore it's reality and it becomes real to us now there's nothing there's nothing anybody could ever say to tell you that serpent SE is not true and when people say it's not true you can take go back to the scripture and say it says right there serpent seed his serpent seed what is that it's in the Bible and a lot of people don't even know that yes they don't even know it's scriptural praise but yet they'll take Trinity when there's not a there's there's nothing in the scripture at all that speaks about Trinity or uses the word Trinity and how many other things we could talk about but right amen they'll take they'll take that hookline and sinker but you give them serpy which is scriptural amen for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come that is mature that is the mature perfect that is the full age the Matthew 54 that's that perfect when that which is perfect mature sure is come that which is in part shall be done away with or shall be not uh you could say done away with as in annihilated it's not annihilated but it's it's rendered idle at that point amen which means that the word takes the preeminence the word takes the preeminence over a gift any time and to my understanding see a lot of people say when when the word came then there was no more speaking there was no more prophesying there was no more of the manifestation of these gifts and even even brother green talked to brother Brown and talked about whether we weren't supposed to speak in tongues anymore and said I hope I hadn't taught that that would be anti- word if I taught that right what does that tell us that tells us that the the that that those gifts tongues included would not be done away with or annihilated but there has come a time now that it took a backseat if you will the word is the priority the word is the preeminence nothing wrong with speaking in tongues nothing wrong with the prophecy if it's of God all that all that gifts that are in in order are all perfectly fine and right in scriptural and we should I even read a quote where brother randam said a church is not manifesting the gifts I have a give account of God one day God help us I don't want I don't want to be that church amen but but we know that they're but they they kind of take a back seat now the word is come front and forward Jesus Christ the word is first front forward Paramount amen when that is perfect is come that was in part of be done away with when I was a child I spake as a child understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know heart but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abide faith hope charity these three but the greatest of them is Charity praise the Lord now trying trying to do God of service without it being his will I want to read a couple quotes if I can get through these here amen he talked about de David king of Israel got the Revelation to bring the Ark of the Covenant back to its rightful position but they never they never consulted in uh God in the days of Saul because Saul had backslid so they never consulted the ark at all the Covenant in the days of Saul because he had backslid was gone away from God so David quickly with inspiration now notice this this it's a very treacherous text if you get right down to it he said and I feel that the hour is coming where we should be men instead of babies strong milk instead of meat amen turning on the light uh but you take the sun it shines in August you put it on the wheat today it would kill it certainly you can't do that and we're talking about that that chokes out notice amen you you put the put the Noonday sun on a morning plant and it'll die it'll kill it he's talking about the wheat got coming to the place that it would not be able to take the full be the full bearance of the sun right uh put it on a wheat today it would kill it certainly can't do that it must come in its season so must God's uh wheat and grain ripen just in the season the season that it's in see well the wheat would die the fruits would die Sun uh by the Sun that lives today that sun today rather it's coming a harvest is ripening the grain should mature with the light and it did as we talked about from the first church age till this age the reform up to the prophet it should mature up to this up to this age because the grain had to come forth in Pentecost dying the ground R so that it could come forth again in the maturity of this last day the grain should mature with the light but that but the thing is today the church grain don't want to mature the church grain it wants to stay like it was back in Moody's times uh sanki f Knox Calvin they were all right with the light that they had God entrusted them with the light for that day yes amen he entrusted them with the maturity level that they had attained at that time but this is another hour this is another day this is the advancement of the Gospel it's coming to its maturity so we cannot live on what Luther said although Luther said what Luther said is right right the just shall live by faith amen but you can't take that alone amen Wesley said or some of the rest of them we're living in the light that was predicted for this day we're in the seventh Church age that's uh not the third fourth Church age grain should be able to receive it if it doesn't fall off means there's nothing to it the grain is matured with the life if it goes ahead with the light right one last time now in the rising of the sun I quoted this one last week I'm going to read this we'll uh close as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth also typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheath waved again in the last day oh my waving of the sheath what was the sheath it was the first one to come to maturity first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheath Hallelujah I'm sure you see it I'm talking about I was waving over the people that probably a very minuscal amount of people in that service at that time understood what brother Brown was talking about amen I I think I'm not venturing with authority there uh probably I believe that probably from those some people that were in those meetings and that were a part of those things um but I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message praise God there will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the People by the the same signs and wonders that he did back there amen praise the Lord Jesus you imagine Saints now brother Pat doesn't have to imagine he was in some of those meetings but could you imagine I can only imagine sitting there and listening to some of the things that I believ that man to be a prophet was saying for the first time you're listening to things that nobody else had ever said before again we see it as common a lot of times today things that we talk about in the message quote unquote vernacular but people sitting in these meetings that's the first time they ever heard anything like that amen and can you imagine trying to take those things in but he knew brother bandam knew and God told him to store up that food amen store up that food in storehouses because we would need it and that we would feed on it and those that were there I'm not discounting those that were there obviously because they grew I I believe they were part of God they grew with it too as time went on as brother R passed away as they listened to the Tes as they remembered back amen amen praise the lord it's like I remember back the first time I heard somebody told me to go get a dead blow I look back I remember how confused I was how I had no idea what they were talking about amen could you imagine for the first time many of these people hearing things that brother Brown said it was the first time they had ever heard anything like that says Christians ministers I never heard it preached like that no wonder they know some you believe that was a man sent from God right because it it's like they told Jesus amen it's like Nicodemus came to Jesus at night nobody can see speak like you do nobody can do the things you do we know you're a man sent from God because nobody could have done those things like you do except God be with him amen a lot of people have left it a lot of people have uh been discouraged by it but those who know and those who believe and those is it's become a part of their lives it is truth amen and there's no way you can separate them from it friend there's no way you can SE separate me from that word Amen brother Ram's gone absolutely but the word that was left that God spoke through to through him to me is still here because I'm here amen amen it's still here because you're here not just because the tapes are here and every other version that we could think of but because we're here as long as you're here the word's here praise the Lord and that word will be manifested as long as it's continued to be manifested in Us Praise the Lord and and the more we continue to grow yes another thing don't ever become complacent yes don't ever I've seen people it seems like sometimes they get so complacent like well you know I I I've learned enough I know enough I've gone to church I got it I get it I understand I know I just leave me alone now and and that's maybe not exactly their words but sort of their attitude yes amen and that is a horrible attitude because we will always continue to grow God will always continue to unfold brother bandom said God will continue to unfold things to us through eternity so how dare we think we can we know it all now amen amen God will continue to show us and reveal it to us Us Praise the Lord amen let's stand if we could praise the Lord let God continue to reveal it to your life amen continue to reveal it to your souls grow in the Lord grow in Grace we've gotten to that place of maturity of the grown woman that God that he would marry the grown woman that he would call his wife call his bride amen we hadn't seen this little course in a while came to my heart here amen I'm trying to remember the name of it I know where it is in here if I can find it real quick amen I sang it quite a few times but again it came to my heart just now so I thought I want to sing it again

his word speaks to our hearts and shows us things that we need to have to continue to PR this battle amen God reveals and unfolds himself amen praise the Lord appreciate your prayers this last week had a good week it's kind of a lengthy week didn't have quite as many hours in this week but uh um it was still uh had 14 133 hour days and so it's kind of lengthy but it's just the that way with the what we call a CeX we work on existing um existing washes that need specific things upgrades and all done so uh but it it was a good week I appreciate the flights were good um it would just U did nonstops to Atlanta and back and there were good flights and on time and so uh appreciate the Lord and appreciate all your prayers for us keeping us safe and healthy amen praise the lord we were uh we were in we were in Georgia when I learned of two people dying right here in Mor a plane crash so you know when I when I say I'm thankful for the safety and I mean it I'm very thankful your prayers uh was it this week I can't remember maybe it was this week too where the plane landed in Toronto and flipped over amen I mean I believe all those people lived three were critical no none of them died so thankfully all of them lived but could you imagine I still don't want to go through that it was a I I did notice one thing on this last flight people had their belts and were tightening them up sometimes people are getting kind of not not quite as uh serious about them but it looked like on these last flights people were just at least yesterday they were tighten them down amen cuz uh uh you never know you just never know plane lands and flipped and it's on its top before you know what's going on Amen but I appreciate it and I I don't take it lightly I'm very thankful to your prayers for the Lord's course too then so I'm not sure about next week we're supposed to go to California but it depends on the flight he gives me uh there's a flight that leaves at 1 12:55 and one that and one that leaves later so I'm not sure we'll see what happens because I told him I can do 1:00 so we'll see if he has to put me in the other local guy dug together uh to to fly together and to be in the same car to make it cheaper for the company I'll Pro that's probably what you'll do uh but I'll let you know uh far enough ahead of time so that you know what's going on whether we need to do uh the early uh earlier service or not so after that going to Minneapolis and there shouldn't have to there shouldn't be any early Services there because it's 2 o' I think it's the flight that goes nonstop to Minneapolis right there so but anyway just to let you know if anything changes I will let you know yes so amen so praise the Lord if anybody is everybody still getting the text the uh okay I'm making sure I think I finally figured out how to text because see I got I'm sorry to keep you but I got I've had questions I had I've got groups that I need to interact with as a group but us uh I just send out a blast for all of you and if you respond I just want your response to come to me well since Verizon cancelled and uh got rid of their messaging where it I could just said it and it did that the way I wanted it for each text group this new one Google uh it doesn't do that I have to change it every time so last week when I changed it I did change it but I changed the wrong thing to make it to where uh our that message I sent out would just be a response back to me and not everybody uh I messed it up again so I'm sorry about that but each time I if I text like my work group I have to change it back when I text you all I have to change it back so uh it's it's a dance I'm doing with my texting now until some person smarter than well I don't know can come out with something better it was perfectly fine the way it was I don't know why they got rid of it but anyway so I apologize for that uh I talked to them about the bathroom did it work better okay because I talked to them I went and flushed it today and it flushed okay uh the water pressure still isn't great but um I don't I'm not sure what they can do about that but I did talk to them about it or send them a text to fix it so I'll try to get with them again this week and tell them look is just is it just not feeling up fast enough or something um so anyway I guess it's flushing okay but it's the whole Tank's got to fill up for it to flush completely but anyway I'll see if they can do something about that maybe the little thing is CL but that's just housekeeping stuff I just wanted to check to see because I forgot all about it when I was gone last week my apologies but anyway so I believe that's all our housekeeping so Lord bless you amen love you appreciate you uh did have somebody that wasn't here last week who had a birthday on a Sunday and they weren't here so happy birthday to Zach amen his birthday was actually last Sunday but poor little Ruthie wasn't feeling good so they weren't able to make it so but happy birthday today so amen we appreciate brother Zach God bless you amen Lord bless youall anybody anything before we dis God bless you richly love and appreciate you all will be dismissed in the word of prayer ask Joel would you dismiss us yes Lord than you thank you Jesus amen thank you Lord amen
