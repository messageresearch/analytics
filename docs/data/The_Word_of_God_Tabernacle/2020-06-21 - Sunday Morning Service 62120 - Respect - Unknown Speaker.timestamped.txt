[27:48] God is here today and watches over and
[27:52] blesses and keeps us and helps us to
[27:54] simple together again like this with
[27:57] those of like precious faith and give us
[27:59] the facility to do so coming up the
[28:02] interstate
[28:03] woah actually coming down aren't road
[28:06] saw the big huge plume of smoke over
[28:08] here and she said my wife said I wonder
[28:12] what that is
[28:13] looks like another fire well I wonder
[28:17] what it is I said well no but we're
[28:19] headed that direction as long as it's
[28:21] not holiday in life but it was all
[28:27] closed right over here but then the
[28:29] closer we got the more I thought about
[28:30] was part of the waste management and
[28:32] it's just is right behind the fire
[28:35] department the Northwest Park District
[28:38] fire departments right there so look
[28:40] doors it was just right there so I'm
[28:42] sure they have it under control but I'm
[28:44] thankful it wasn't here the board
[28:46] provided us a place here to be so
[28:49] thankful for that and one too I wish
[28:51] again is brother Zach did one of you is
[28:54] here at those your own hookup or the
[28:57] streaming the happy Father's Day to you
[29:00] it's a wonderful there's a wonderful day
[29:03] to have a Father's Day again we're very
[29:06] thankful of the greatest father of all
[29:08] this he's mentioned as mike has sang and
[29:10] the number one father of all that we all
[29:13] try to emulate is the Lord Jesus God
[29:16] Almighty we try to do our best to live
[29:19] up to his example for us
[29:25] so we're so very thankful of that God's
[29:28] been so good to us you know there's a
[29:30] lot of people in the world today there's
[29:33] a lot of young people that are a lot of
[29:35] homes that are fatherless they've had
[29:38] they've had those that would sire
[29:42] children procreate but then you know for
[29:46] Tom really dads or not around or don't
[29:49] take care of their children or help or
[29:52] be there and you know but if those could
[29:56] just learn to understand to reach out to
[29:59] the Lord of lords and the father that we
[30:02] have they'll always have a father amen
[30:04] the best example that there is that you
[30:07] just always do that so we're very
[30:09] thankful to be here again very thankful
[30:12] Lord give us another facility this
[30:14] facility to be able to worship in today
[30:16] and the streaming capabilities and
[30:17] market helping us so much with that and
[30:20] very thankful the Lord blessed us with
[30:22] that as you know there's been a little
[30:24] bit of a change there's been a rise in
[30:27] the cases of coronavirus of 19 in
[30:32] Arizona and in somewhat in Pima County
[30:34] so some have gotten a little more theory
[30:38] about coming together and that's quite
[30:40] all right I understand that that's
[30:43] perfectly fine and someone feels
[30:45] comfortable being here they don't that's
[30:47] okay well welcome you and thank you for
[30:49] being here but if those who don't feel
[30:52] that comfortable I understand it's kind
[30:54] of strange the way the government and
[30:57] the media Pro tray it because no more
[30:59] than two or three weeks ago they were
[31:01] telling everybody as soon as things
[31:02] start opening up again you're gonna see
[31:04] the cases go up well now they opened up
[31:08] the the country and opened up
[31:12] restaurants and businesses and things
[31:14] like that and now the cases are going up
[31:16] a little bit and they're saying dreaming
[31:18] they're screaming foul they told us
[31:20] three weeks ago that's gonna happen
[31:22] just it's just part and parcel of what
[31:26] we're living in today friend it's just
[31:28] it's just kind of sad to watch it go the
[31:31] way it's gone but I think it has a lot
[31:34] to do with the increased testing I think
[31:36] it has a lot to do with the fact that
[31:38] the country is open again I think it has
[31:41] someone maybe a little bit to do with a
[31:43] lot of the protests that went on in
[31:45] people all shoulders shoulder elbow to
[31:46] elbow screaming and yelling and they're
[31:48] you know some had masks some didn't but
[31:50] you know we were told up front that if
[31:52] it wasn't an invite in 95 mask it was
[31:55] not going to be that effective so people
[31:58] just had a bandana on or something just
[32:00] that's just the place it's the world we
[32:03] live in today
[32:04] but where the service of the Lord that's
[32:10] what I believe the Lord's I got my mask
[32:12] though fight that battle when it comes
[32:18] to doing the things of the Lord and
[32:19] having service and things like that I'll
[32:21] fight tooth and nail but when it comes
[32:23] to just putting on a mask going into
[32:24] Home Depot or something I really don't
[32:26] care that much I don't necessarily enjoy
[32:30] breathing my own carbon dioxide which is
[32:33] one thing you don't hear very much about
[32:35] it this whole thing that everybody's
[32:37] running down the road and driving their
[32:39] bikes and sucking their own carbon
[32:40] dioxide you know 10% carbon dioxide in
[32:43] your system will cause a human to go
[32:45] into convulsions some some woman I heard
[32:49] was a read on the news actually was
[32:51] riding her bicycle her jogging down the
[32:53] street or something she kept sucking in
[32:54] her own air and her heart her one of her
[32:56] lungs exploded so it's you know you
[33:00] gotta weigh it you gotta weigh it and
[33:02] decide you know and be led of the Lord
[33:06] you know if your letter the Lord to wear
[33:08] it all the time or be a home that's what
[33:10] you do otherwise we do what we feel that
[33:14] to do and trust the Lord bless us and
[33:16] keep us but again I work coming in here
[33:19] take it off here I'll wear it in the
[33:22] restaurant when we go in the restaurant
[33:23] but I have to take it off to eat but
[33:27] they didn't not they didn't actually say
[33:30] on the news anything about meeting
[33:32] church gatherings they talked mostly
[33:35] about restaurants and places of business
[33:37] and retells and stuff like that so it's
[33:41] mandated in Pima County now if you're
[33:43] out in public and you can't social
[33:45] distance you're supposed to have the
[33:46] mask on so I'm not that's not a Bible
[33:49] that I desire to fight so that's what
[33:52] they wanted
[33:55] I'm thankful that the Lord give us the
[33:57] ability to be able to trust him and live
[34:00] upon his word amen so and we're thankful
[34:02] to be here today so list and if we could
[34:05] and turn our Bibles to lamentations
[34:07] chapter lamentations or the lamentations
[34:27] of Jeremiah the weeping prophet but I'm
[34:33] going to go to the fourth chapter even
[34:35] just another moment find it there it's
[34:39] by the way actually only five chapters
[34:43] there's a thought in here that I want to
[34:45] get to and go over to James chapter 2 as
[34:48] well and take a thought from today so
[34:58] Old Testament just after Jeremiah let's
[35:07] just bow our heads now we'll just have a
[35:10] word of Prayer Lord Jesus we're so
[35:12] thankful father that your grace is upon
[35:14] us your blessings are bountiful your
[35:16] love is everlasting and unconditional
[35:19] and your grace is so sufficient Lord and
[35:21] your mercies endure forever and we love
[35:23] you we thank you we praise you Lord we
[35:26] thank you God for being the ultimate the
[35:28] utmost the best example of fatherhood
[35:31] that any of us could ever try to emulate
[35:33] Lord and God we're here obeying your
[35:36] word because you told us it Lord you and
[35:39] hope you would have us together together
[35:41] not forsake the assembling of ourselves
[35:43] as it says in your word is that day
[35:46] approaches and Lord we certainly see
[35:47] that day rapidly approaching we're so
[35:50] thankful God that you give us your grace
[35:51] and mercy once again to be here you've
[35:54] provided this facility this place for us
[35:56] to mean for the streaming and the Lord
[35:58] would thankful God for your hand upon
[36:00] our lives upon our congregation help
[36:03] those weren't able to make it today for
[36:04] whatever reason we know that your hand
[36:06] is upon them as well God just blessed us
[36:09] to help come together to find a good
[36:11] place that you would have provided for
[36:13] us Lord God I pray that you bless this
[36:15] service now may your hand be upon it may
[36:18] you speak to us from your word now Lord

[36:28] hurt this service in any way God that
[36:30] you would get the glory and the praise
[36:31] for all that is said and done anointed
[36:33] speaker here now God as we do this
[36:35] according to your word and for your
[36:37] glory and honor
[36:38] now you edify us as a body of believers
[36:41] now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:43] we pray amen amen
[36:46] lamentations lamentations chapter 4
[36:50] we're just going to read one verse the
[36:52] verse 16 the anger of the Lord hath
[36:55] divided them he will no more regard them
[36:58] they respected not the persons of the
[37:00] priests they favored not the elders
[37:04] you could be seated if you'd like also
[37:10] meant to mention something that maybe
[37:17] will maybe I'll tell you afterwards I'm
[37:19] trying to debate I guess it's okay to
[37:20] put on video
[37:21] I heard the streaming I heard this week
[37:24] that and I don't believe it was a rumor
[37:28] I believe it was actually something that
[37:29] was that was true and nothing wrong is
[37:35] just someone had mentioned to me this
[37:38] week that they heard that or we're told
[37:40] that the voice of God fellowship and
[37:42] Northside fellowship was when two
[37:44] merchants together
[37:48] nothing consequential to us for that I'm
[37:51] glad they're able to do that I think
[37:52] that's a wonderful thing
[37:54] but I've tried to get in contact with
[37:58] somebody this week to find out if voice
[38:00] of God Fellowship is moving into
[38:03] Northside Fellowship what they're going
[38:05] to do with their facility I'm trying to
[38:08] call this money yesterday and I'm in
[38:10] contact it wasn't necessary that the
[38:12] area of town I wanted to be in but it is
[38:13] still on this side if you don't know
[38:16] it's at Prince and Romero if you know
[38:18] where Prince Romero is know exactly
[38:21] where Prince Romero is as where Ralph
[38:24] and her son Nathan works but back off
[38:28] from Mara behind the circle-k there's
[38:30] some commercial places back in there and
[38:33] invoicing my fellow should have been
[38:35] there ever since a work by church the
[38:37] Word of God closed by the mark on de
[38:39] pass and I've just it just came to my
[38:42] mind well if they're occupying that
[38:44] facility if it's probably I'm sure set
[38:48] up for church they've been there for
[38:49] years that we see maybe about trying to
[38:53] find that I'm just trusting the Lord to
[38:57] open the door if this is a door that the
[38:59] Lord is opening I don't want to ignore
[39:01] it I want to I want to step through it
[39:04] if it's his will and if not then he'll
[39:06] shut the door it's not it was not an
[39:09] option that's okay but you know unless
[39:11] the Lord comes and speaks audibly or
[39:14] tells you correctly or something you
[39:17] just just like we found the facility
[39:19] over here you know we found the facility
[39:21] over here because I was searching on
[39:23] Craigslist and I assumed they had rented
[39:26] it by the time we needed a place and I
[39:28] was just gonna go look for a hotel place
[39:30] but I had nothing in mind and Sonia's
[39:32] like well let's go see that place and I
[39:35] was like well that place is gone by now
[39:37] it was no Craigslist anymore so we drove
[39:39] down there that's how we got that place
[39:41] just turned out the guy was there and we
[39:44] discussed it he dropped the price from
[39:46] 250 to $100 a week and that's how we got
[39:49] the place that we were at for four years
[39:51] so if that's what the Lord is doing here
[39:54] then that's fine I want to I want to
[39:58] walk through the doors that the Lord is
[39:59] open for us and if that's what's
[40:01] happening here then praise the Lord and
[40:02] so this may keep you up to date let you
[40:04] know what's going on if that is a rumor
[40:07] if that isn't true well that's a
[40:09] different story too but however the Lord
[40:11] leads us that's where we want to go so
[40:13] just continue to pray for us and the and
[40:16] the congregation and if that's not it
[40:20] then I do believe the Lord has a place
[40:22] for us so just trust in that amen now
[40:25] let's get back to the word lamentations
[40:28] chapter 4 like we said we don't usually
[40:30] it's kind of rare you hear
[40:32] ministers preach from lamentations
[40:34] especially message ministers but
[40:36] lamentations is actually a very small
[40:39] book the lamentations of the weeping
[40:41] prophet Jeremiah and as Jeremiah went
[40:46] through all of the things if you if
[40:50] you've read through your Bible you know
[40:52] Jeremiah had a had in my opinion one of
[40:55] the hardest times and that any man of
[40:58] God had now there's been a lot of them
[41:01] and there's been a lot have very
[41:02] difficult times and and some difficult
[41:04] different struggles and things like that
[41:06] and you know Elijah just was you know
[41:09] resting on her juniper tree and one to
[41:11] God to kill him and said he was the last
[41:13] one and screaming and running from a
[41:14] woman and you know they've all had that
[41:16] but Jeremiah to me sticks out to a point
[41:19] that pretty much Jeremiah's in
[41:21] ministry I get to come in here and I get
[41:24] to preach to the gospel of Jesus Christ
[41:26] Jeremiah didn't have that I get to come
[41:28] in here and preach about the positivity
[41:30] of the blood of Christ and and what
[41:33] God's done for us and the prosperous
[41:35] nature that God in His grace and mercy
[41:38] and where we're going and but Jeremiah
[41:41] was basically charged with the
[41:44] responsibility of I don't know 95% of
[41:49] his ministry was was giving declaring
[41:54] judgment upon the house of Israel upon
[41:57] the children of Israel they had gotten
[41:59] so far away from God that his whole
[42:01] ministry was nothing but but prophesying
[42:05] things of disaster and and telling them
[42:08] how horrible they were doing and tell
[42:10] them how bad a people they had become
[42:12] and it'd be hard for us to come in here
[42:16] every Sunday and the Lord just hammer us
[42:19] every single time that the people had
[42:20] just gotten so evil that Jeremiah's
[42:23] entire ministry basically was based on
[42:26] telling these people how horrible they
[42:28] were how bad God was displeased with him
[42:30] and what the judgment of God was going
[42:32] to be late on that had been a horrible
[42:36] life that Jeremiah had to let it plus
[42:38] the persecution that came with it so
[42:41] subsequently King Jeremiah's lamentation
[42:44] now Jeremiah was of course absolutely a
[42:46] prophet of God a man of God a minister
[42:48] of God but as his life unfolded in the
[42:53] way it came about there came about these
[42:57] lamentations
[42:58] from Jeremiah and if you've ever
[43:01] lamented over something you can
[43:04] understand how he felt I mean he had
[43:06] five chapters of the lamenting the
[43:08] lamentations that that he had in his
[43:11] life and in his ministry and this five
[43:14] books here is accumulation of the
[43:16] lamentations of the lamenting that came
[43:19] from Jeremiah he could you imagine if if
[43:22] you knew that the people of God were
[43:24] like that and the message God gave in
[43:26] the vid
[43:26] and the dreams God gave you to to
[43:29] proclaim this disaster in this judgment
[43:32] upon them how you would lament over that
[43:35] how difficult that would be and that was
[43:38] that was where Jeremiah was when he when
[43:41] he wrote these lamenting these
[43:43] lamentations well one of these
[43:44] lamentations brings us to the thought
[43:47] that I wanted to bring today and again
[43:49] that's the sixteenth verse let me read
[43:51] it again and one of his lamenting was
[43:55] that the anger of the Lord had divided
[43:57] them God had became so displeased with
[44:01] his own people that he begin to divide
[44:04] them so and of course you know when
[44:07] you're divided it's easier it easier to
[44:10] be conquered when you're divided right
[44:12] that's why we should always stay unified
[44:14] always stay together as as I talked
[44:18] about the week before or last week and I
[44:20] will again you know we should never look
[44:22] down on one another for anything
[44:24] especially during this period of time or
[44:26] things become so are becoming so
[44:28] divisive that divisive nough swill try
[44:32] to creep into the body of Christ and and
[44:34] in our congregation and we got to keep
[44:36] where to that and make sure that that
[44:38] division doesn't come amongst their own
[44:40] ranks and then we feel divided amongst
[44:43] each other or look down or form or feel
[44:45] bad about somebody who's not in church
[44:48] or not wearing a mask or wearing a mask
[44:50] or something
[44:51] there's just the tricks of the devil to
[44:53] try to divide us right you do what you
[44:55] feel that of the Lord to do and I'll
[44:56] trust you and the God in you enough to
[44:59] know that God is leading you to do what
[45:01] you're doing as long as you afford me
[45:03] with the same of the same likeness in
[45:08] respect see if there's got to be retro
[45:10] Papa the in retrospect there's got to be
[45:13] both ways see it's come to the place
[45:18] today in this country that that people
[45:21] start believing what they're doing is
[45:23] right and there's no other way to do it
[45:25] so they have no respect for someone with
[45:27] the opposite opinion but see I have
[45:30] enough respect to believe that if you're
[45:32] a child of God God's leading you but you
[45:35] got to do the same thing
[45:36] for me for us and for one another that
[45:39] the God in me is leading me the ways
[45:41] leading me and telling me what to do and
[45:43] that's what I do and and you have
[45:46] respect for that and and I have respect
[45:48] for you and that's actually the message
[45:52] that I want to get to it kind of the
[45:54] Lord brought that out is respect I want
[45:57] to talk about respect cuz that's what
[45:59] God is talking about here he's dividing
[46:02] them you mean God is dividing him which
[46:06] makes them easily conquerable makes them
[46:08] easy to be contrasted they're divided
[46:10] he's dividing he will no more regard
[46:13] them now that's the respect it says
[46:16] regard but that's the same thing to have
[46:18] regard to something or someone is to
[46:21] respect that person or that thing to
[46:24] have respect will regard for is just
[46:26] saying that you look to that person of
[46:29] some with some type of esteem see
[46:31] because the word respect means if you
[46:33] just look it up in the dictionary not
[46:36] this you know in the Bible Greek or
[46:39] Hebrew but just in the regular Webster's
[46:41] dictionary respect is to consider worthy
[46:43] of a steam consider worthy of a steam
[46:46] and honor or have deep admiration or
[46:51] regard to someone's feelings is to
[46:55] respect that person if you respect that
[46:57] person you respect how they feel you
[47:00] respect what they think you respect
[47:02] their ambitions their ideas things like
[47:05] that you have respect for you might
[47:07] disagree with it but you have respect
[47:10] for them first as a human second as a
[47:13] godly person third is the Holy Ghost
[47:15] field person you have respects for that
[47:17] person to hold to have a deep admiration
[47:20] or an honor and esteem and and you hold
[47:23] that person's feelings in high regard
[47:25] you don't want to hurt that person or
[47:27] cause any harm if if it can be helped
[47:31] see that that's respect
[47:33] sometimes you respect a person to the
[47:36] point that you have to hurt their
[47:38] feelings because you care so much about
[47:40] them sometimes you have to say things
[47:42] that are hurtful be to the person
[47:46] directly
[47:47] because you respect them then love them
[47:49] so much you don't want to see disaster a
[47:52] harm come to them for the whole family
[47:55] right that's respect to a lot of people
[47:57] don't understand it's a part of respect
[47:58] that gets lost people say well they have
[48:00] no respect well they have so much
[48:02] respect they don't want you to go to
[48:04] hell
[48:06] that's the kind of respect that they
[48:07] have that's the twisted nature that this
[48:10] world looks at of course we talked about
[48:11] love in that manner but it's that
[48:13] respects course the love follows the
[48:15] respect you respect someone you're gonna
[48:17] love them but God is saying he's divided
[48:20] them and will no more respect them or
[48:24] regard them if there's there's not an
[48:27] esteemed there now there's not that that
[48:31] honor for that deep feeling of affection
[48:34] or admiration they lost that why did
[48:39] they lose it they respected not the
[48:42] persons of the priest they favored not
[48:46] the elders now if you go through
[48:47] Jeremiah
[48:48] you'll see how horribly bad that it had
[48:51] gotten and because they had lost their
[48:54] respects God lost or removed his regard
[48:58] regard for them because of their lack of
[49:02] respect for each other
[49:04] so you see what I'm saying God lost
[49:07] regard to them because they had refused
[49:11] to respect one another that brings us to
[49:15] the understanding of the respect that we
[49:17] should have for each other that respect
[49:20] that we have is first of all that were
[49:22] humans we respect God's creation we
[49:26] respect God's people we respect those
[49:30] that try to be godly people they may not
[49:34] see and live and see things the way we
[49:36] do or live the way we do they may not
[49:38] understand or know the message but we
[49:40] still have respect for them we might try
[49:42] to help them come to the place that they
[49:45] become born again and receive a
[49:47] revelation of the truths and things like
[49:49] that but that's done that should have no
[49:51] regard to the
[49:53] fact that we have for that persons or
[49:55] then to us and I have found that a lot
[49:58] of times if you offer respect you will
[50:01] get respect they will respect you if you
[50:04] respect them I respect your opinion I
[50:07] think you're wrong but I respect your
[50:10] opinion and then those that have the
[50:12] Holy Ghost well my goodness if you don't
[50:14] respect those that you believe are in
[50:16] the thorns though they do have the Holy
[50:17] Ghost whether you believe it or not if
[50:19] you don't have respect for them you
[50:20] don't have respect for God you don't
[50:22] have respect for God for anything you've
[50:24] lost at all because that's where these
[50:26] people had gotten they lost respect for
[50:28] the priesthood and for the ministers for
[50:30] that and and when they when they lost
[50:33] respect for God's people they lost
[50:35] respect for God in God then God took his
[50:38] regard of them away see so that respect
[50:42] has to be there and this division that's
[50:44] coming that that's in the world today
[50:48] makes it even harder it makes it even
[50:51] rougher because it's become an anointing
[50:53] I mean friend there's there's just very
[50:56] strong spirits that are out there now
[50:59] because remember we've talked about this
[51:01] before and this is nothing new but 67
[51:03] years ago brother Brown told us that
[51:06] it's going to come to the place that
[51:08] that anointing is going to lift off of
[51:11] the Gentile bride and it's going to go
[51:13] back to the Jews and God is beginning to
[51:17] deal with them in the point that they're
[51:19] them and their people are gonna receive
[51:21] the Messiah now that won't be till after
[51:24] the brides at the the wedding supper of
[51:26] the Lamb
[51:27] but they're going to receive that so
[51:29] what's happening here is that Spirit of
[51:31] God is lifted well when the Spirit of
[51:33] God lives it feels with something else
[51:35] it backfields the Spirit of God lifts
[51:39] because remember that the Spirit of God
[51:41] failed at the day of Pentecost acts 2
[51:45] you can see the Spirit of God came and
[51:47] it fell upon each one of them and the
[51:49] Spirit of God remained until the the
[51:53] Spirit began to lift off the people and
[51:56] when the Spirit began to live the Dark
[51:58] Ages set in because when when the spirit
[52:02] of godless impacts feel it back
[52:04] feels with something else will that
[52:05] Satan that's the devil because this is
[52:08] Satan see so the only thing that keeps
[52:11] Satan's Eden at bay
[52:13] and we'll just say if we could do it
[52:15] dramatically with with my actions here
[52:18] keep it at bay she could say it's sort
[52:21] of like the heads we talked about with
[52:22] job last week see that that anointing of
[52:25] spirit keeps that Satan's in that Bank
[52:28] it moves it aside and keeps it out well
[52:32] if that is when ting is here and that
[52:35] anointing is real in there then then it
[52:37] oppresses and puts and pushes aside the
[52:41] spirit of the enemy the spirit of Satan
[52:44] this is Satan's Eden not no doubt that
[52:47] Satan can still operate within that but
[52:50] he has very strict limitations when that
[52:53] anointing of God is there because the
[52:55] anointing God is the paramount of
[52:59] anointing or presence it is the
[53:02] Paramount so it even if Satan is
[53:04] pressing in he cannot go past that part
[53:08] that God has anointed so just like you
[53:11] had that that anointing and again my
[53:15] illustration here that that anointing is
[53:17] here on you on the people of God in
[53:21] pressing aside all of Satan's e now that
[53:25] doesn't mean that the effects of Satan
[53:27] Eden aren't pressing into you
[53:29] they then but the ability of Satan to be
[53:33] able to get to you like he would desire
[53:35] to is gone because this anointing is
[53:38] upon you the presence of God is upon you
[53:42] so Satan cannot get to you like he would
[53:44] desire to get to you he can't a little
[53:46] bit that spirit can come in well in that
[53:49] little microcosm of us as individuals
[53:51] you can see that as a whole as far as
[53:55] our nation and the Gentile world is will
[53:57] say as a whole because when that
[54:00] anointing is there then it keeps that
[54:03] that real oppressive demonic Satan's
[54:07] Eden for coming in and
[54:09] full force but as the Spirit of God
[54:12] lifts it back fills with Satan's II so
[54:16] as God's Spirit is lifting the spear of
[54:19] Satan is becoming more prominent and
[54:21] more demonstrative more becoming thicker
[54:24] and harder and he noticed that we've had
[54:28] sin since the Garden tea but you've
[54:32] noticed this for those who are you know
[54:35] oh I'd say over 40 maybe even more
[54:39] because things change so drastically now
[54:41] I mean Micah just turned dirty and tap
[54:46] Toby 27 to say we weren't gonna say that
[54:48] too later but anyway so I use my
[54:52] daughter I don't
[54:56] and plus when you're under 30 it doesn't
[54:59] count this anyway so in that in that
[55:04] light in that situation if you're if
[55:09] you're that age you remember back years
[55:12] ago were you know there was sin in the
[55:15] country that was sin in the world but it
[55:18] but it would just come in and it would
[55:20] just feel free and you can see you know
[55:23] a little bit of rock'n'roll or you know
[55:26] you can see like only bikers and and
[55:30] military men got tattoos and piercings
[55:34] and I remember when I was in school and
[55:36] it was like you could only get if you're
[55:40] a guy if you got one year pierce you
[55:43] were kind of funny if you got the other
[55:45] one you were cool you know but you know
[55:47] most regular guys didn't do it that was
[55:49] just kind of the fringe extreme so it
[55:52] was a spirit but it wasn't something
[55:54] just over cane but nowadays when you see
[55:58] those spirits or those enemies come in
[56:00] it just is like a bulldozer that spirit
[56:04] becomes so thick and it's not something
[56:06] that's just a friend stuff it's just
[56:07] immediate and definite and it's because
[56:11] the Spirit of God is it is lifting and
[56:14] the more the Spirit of God is
[56:15] the harder those spirits are gonna come
[56:17] in and slam the people that aren't ready
[56:19] for it
[56:20] the only thing protecting you is that
[56:23] buffer that gods give us that anointing
[56:26] that we still have even though that
[56:28] general spirit anointing is lifting that
[56:31] is that anointing spirit is still on you
[56:34] as an individual amen
[56:36] so that broad / sweeping spirit may be
[56:40] lifting but God's people still are
[56:43] anointed and have his presence around
[56:44] them to keep that from coming in like a
[56:47] flood on them keeps it at bay now he'll
[56:51] come in sometimes and you'll upset the
[56:53] applecart if you will he'll do this that
[56:56] he'll try to upset you
[56:57] but he can't come in like you'd like to
[56:58] because that presence is still there so
[57:02] that being said that that spirit is it
[57:05] lifts those spirits are becoming harder
[57:08] and harder and I noticed because of that
[57:11] the respects and the true love of people
[57:15] is being lost it is just going away it's
[57:20] probably more prevalent and nor
[57:22] noticeable in our government than maybe
[57:24] anywhere else as Americans in the United
[57:28] States
[57:28] I want prominent and and prevalent in
[57:31] our government than anywhere else but I
[57:34] believe I've told you this before this
[57:38] country was built on the Constitution
[57:40] this country the men of God wrote the
[57:44] Constitution put in the Bill of Rights
[57:47] to make sure that individual people's
[57:49] freedoms and liberties are protected now
[57:53] you see that eroding quite drastically
[57:56] nowadays it doesn't matter what you want
[57:58] doesn't matter what you think doesn't
[58:00] matter what your individual liberties
[58:02] might be they're gonna tell you what
[58:04] they want you to do period and they
[58:06] don't really care some people come and
[58:09] say well you know we need to obey the
[58:11] law I agree with that we do but this is
[58:14] not a law wearing that mask is not a law
[58:18] but we do it out of respect this again
[58:21] is not a battle I'm gonna fight see I'll
[58:24] fight to have church
[58:26] I'll fight to do something for the Lord
[58:28] but just wearing a mask that's not worth
[58:30] the battle but it's not a law but you
[58:33] notice how those opinions and respects
[58:36] have changed so drastically and I was
[58:40] getting ready to make this statement and
[58:43] I'm instead of here before I probably
[58:45] have that our nation be founded on that
[58:48] and our individual liberties the First
[58:50] Amendment was the first one they wrote I
[58:53] mean you would think the first is
[58:54] probably the most prominent freedom of
[58:57] speech right everybody has the right to
[58:59] express their opinions they don't have
[59:01] the right to burn down buildings and
[59:03] bust out glasses windows and doors and
[59:05] stuff but they have a right to their own
[59:07] opinion
[59:08] and that's fun that's one thing that
[59:10] this country was built upon was being
[59:12] able to express our freedoms to express
[59:14] our thoughts to express our feelings and
[59:17] opinions but if you don't at the same
[59:19] time respect the other person's feelings
[59:22] the other person's opinion respectfully
[59:26] lovingly without dissemination without
[59:30] respect of persons event we can't do it
[59:34] with respect to person if we do it based
[59:36] on a person's religion or a person's
[59:39] nationality our person's color or a
[59:42] person's race if we do it for any other
[59:44] any reason then it's not valid then
[59:48] you're showing respects a person that is
[59:50] not valid see you've lost the whole
[59:53] program there it's got to be really
[59:56] respects regardless of who the person is
[59:59] regardless of where they came from
[1:00:00] regardless of who they worship if a
[1:00:04] Muslim wants to walk through that door
[1:00:05] to shake my hand I'll shake his hand
[1:00:08] I'll love him just like I love you I'll
[1:00:11] try to help him find the truth get into
[1:00:14] Jesus Christ and they help save his soul
[1:00:16] but I'll respect him for it right now if
[1:00:19] you wants to walk through that door with
[1:00:20] the vest on to blow us all up
[1:00:22] that's a little different story again
[1:00:26] that's a little different story but it
[1:00:28] doesn't matter that you understand see
[1:00:31] now that's where the respects are lost
[1:00:33] that's what's happened today
[1:00:35] the
[1:00:37] that first amendment the freedom of
[1:00:39] speech do you do you know that I've
[1:00:41] heard a statistic the other day that
[1:00:43] they did now I'm not a big polar
[1:00:45] statistic person because I think they're
[1:00:47] all skewed in favor of whoever took the
[1:00:49] statistic on the poll but they said the
[1:00:52] statistics are down that that college
[1:00:56] students between the ages of 19 and 25
[1:00:59] now over 50% of them do not believe in
[1:01:03] the First Amendment they do not believe
[1:01:06] in the freedom of speech one of the very
[1:01:09] most foundational blocks that this
[1:01:12] country was built upon the young people
[1:01:15] being raised today do not believe it you
[1:01:17] know why because they have gotten so
[1:01:20] indoctrinated that what they're saying
[1:01:22] and how they say it is right they have
[1:01:25] no respect for what you say they have no
[1:01:28] respect and don't want to even a year
[1:01:30] what your opinion is because it can't be
[1:01:32] right if it's contrary to theirs that's
[1:01:36] how every I mean most of all about we're
[1:01:39] living in Satan's Eden and and the
[1:01:41] civilization and the inventions and cars
[1:01:45] and houses and buildings and cities and
[1:01:48] that's all of the devil hospitals police
[1:01:53] education that's all of the devil
[1:01:55] that's all of civilization that came
[1:01:58] from Cain starting from Cain you go back
[1:02:00] to the Bible reading that's where it
[1:02:02] started with Cain when set came forth
[1:02:04] men began to call on God that's Satan's
[1:02:08] essence I want to be in that lineage now
[1:02:10] we enjoy the comforts and the things of
[1:02:13] a society and things that's going on but
[1:02:15] we're in the world not of the world I
[1:02:17] have been it's been it had been on my
[1:02:19] heart
[1:02:20] I actually been singing it in my spirit
[1:02:22] most of the morning and it really
[1:02:26] energized me this morning when I heard
[1:02:28] Zach get up and sing in this world is
[1:02:31] not my home
[1:02:32] praise the Lord I'm just passing through
[1:02:34] my treasures are laid up somewhere
[1:02:36] beyond the blues
[1:02:38] Amen that done my heart good because
[1:02:41] that's what the truth of it is see but
[1:02:43] we we can't be like that
[1:02:46] gods shooters a lot not like that and
[1:02:49] and furthermore we cannot allow that to
[1:02:52] become a part of our of our lives we
[1:02:56] can't get so caught up in those things
[1:02:58] because again that politics mana in a
[1:03:01] Runion heartbeat many of the person
[1:03:06] become a politician became a devil just
[1:03:09] because of the spirit that surrounds
[1:03:11] that thing but you can't let that come
[1:03:14] any gulf you and separate and start
[1:03:17] looking back down and thinking about
[1:03:20] people and and and losing respects you
[1:03:24] know if you lose respect for somebody
[1:03:26] not only would you not be able to help
[1:03:29] that person if you ever get the
[1:03:31] opportunity not only you not be able to
[1:03:34] help that person but you won't want to
[1:03:37] help that person and God help us if we
[1:03:40] ever get to the place that there's
[1:03:42] anybody on this earth that we don't want
[1:03:44] to help if there's anybody that we want
[1:03:47] to try to lead to Christ if there's
[1:03:48] anybody that we want to help try to get
[1:03:50] their souls to God if there's one person
[1:03:53] that we don't want to see that way
[1:03:54] friends we got to come to an altar
[1:03:56] because we've lost it somewhere right
[1:03:59] we should always feel that way about
[1:04:02] everybody doesn't matter who they are
[1:04:04] but it's so easy Satan will try to get
[1:04:07] in there and and disturb that now worse
[1:04:10] than that would even be in our own homes
[1:04:13] and our own families and our own church
[1:04:18] don't let it be so we've got to maintain
[1:04:21] that and as we do that God will respect
[1:04:25] us amen God has respect for us we have
[1:04:29] respect for him when we have respect for
[1:04:31] his people
[1:04:32] we have respect for his creation we have
[1:04:35] respect for what God does sakes I always
[1:04:39] want to try to maintain myself into a
[1:04:41] point that if anybody needs help I don't
[1:04:44] care who they are I can help them not
[1:04:47] only that I could help them but that I'd
[1:04:49] want to help them I would desire to help
[1:04:53] them if I don't have respect for a
[1:04:55] person you're not going to have a desire
[1:04:57] to help that
[1:04:58] person do you understand that if we've
[1:05:01] lost respect for somebody we don't want
[1:05:04] to help that person because you don't
[1:05:06] respect them enough to try to help them
[1:05:08] and even if you tried it would be with
[1:05:10] cynicism you would think oh well I'll
[1:05:13] tell them something they're not gonna
[1:05:15] listen and I'm gonna pay attention they
[1:05:16] don't care that's just the devil if you
[1:05:20] go into that attitude just forget it
[1:05:22] like God use somebody else to do it and
[1:05:25] go somewhere brain get your heart right
[1:05:28] with God James chapter 2 I want to get
[1:05:32] to this before my time gets gets away
[1:05:43] had so much in Milan I completely forgot
[1:05:46] to record this did the recorder for
[1:05:49] anything specific but I've been
[1:05:50] recording those as well as the streaming
[1:05:53] so but anyway just that one won't be
[1:05:57] today James chapter 2 let's begin with
[1:06:00] verse 1
[1:06:02] James has very good take on it here
[1:06:06] James chapter 2 my brethren have not
[1:06:11] have not the faith of our Lord Jesus
[1:06:13] Christ the Lord of glory
[1:06:15] with respects of persons if you call
[1:06:18] yourself a Christian if you believe you
[1:06:21] to be a part of a man or woman a child
[1:06:23] of God you don't have respects a person
[1:06:28] God doesn't he said we cannot have the
[1:06:32] faith of our Lord Jesus Christ the Lord
[1:06:34] of glory and have the respects of
[1:06:36] persons can't do it because if you
[1:06:39] respect God you respect all that is God
[1:06:42] you respect all that God created now
[1:06:45] there's people in this world that I
[1:06:47] believe in him said that just are here
[1:06:49] because he come through the act of
[1:06:50] procreation a man and woman that's the
[1:06:52] law of God but that doesn't mean that
[1:06:53] God doesn't love that person right
[1:06:55] doesn't mean that God wouldn't want that
[1:06:57] person to come to him he knows who will
[1:07:00] and who want but doesn't mean he doesn't
[1:07:02] want them to he would or his will is and
[1:07:06] he would to have everybody come to
[1:07:07] repentance so if that's his desire
[1:07:10] that's our desire so we can't do it with
[1:07:13] respects a person for if they're come
[1:07:16] unto you assembly a if anyone come into
[1:07:19] your assembly a a man with a gold ring
[1:07:22] in goodly apparel and they're coming
[1:07:24] also a poor man in vowel raiment and he
[1:07:28] have respect to him that we're at the
[1:07:29] gay club they can say unto Him sit down
[1:07:32] here in a good place and say to the poor
[1:07:34] stand out there or sit here under my
[1:07:36] footstool are ye not then partial in
[1:07:39] yourselves under becomes judges of evil
[1:07:42] false which is exactly what a lot of
[1:07:46] what goes on in the world
[1:07:48] today is people have become judges of
[1:07:52] other people's sparks and intense people
[1:07:56] will say well this person did this
[1:07:58] because of so and so well you don't know
[1:08:02] that you can say you believe that but
[1:08:05] that doesn't make it so unless that's
[1:08:08] been proven documented or that
[1:08:10] individual said that themselves you
[1:08:13] don't know what they're thinking you
[1:08:15] don't know how they feel but you have to
[1:08:18] have respect in that person regardless
[1:08:21] of what you think or thought they might
[1:08:24] be thinking one of the judges of
[1:08:26] people's pause we are the judges of
[1:08:30] people's actions we know them by the
[1:08:33] fruits they bear right amen now I don't
[1:08:35] mean judge in the way that you know a
[1:08:38] lot of times people talk about in
[1:08:39] churches of judges we're not being a
[1:08:41] judge to condemn we're just being a
[1:08:45] judge to correct if that makes sense
[1:08:47] we're understanding that that person is
[1:08:50] not living a life that would be pleasing
[1:08:53] to the Lord so that person needs to
[1:08:56] understand this is displeasing to the
[1:08:58] Lord sometimes you may hurt a person's
[1:09:01] feelings by helping them to see the
[1:09:04] error of their way but in doing that you
[1:09:07] may save a soul as well but we don't do
[1:09:10] it with with the with the thought of
[1:09:15] judging a person's fault
[1:09:19] a person's if a person doesn't say it
[1:09:23] their thought is just their property if
[1:09:26] their thought becomes words it becomes
[1:09:27] everybody who hurt its property if it's
[1:09:31] but that's that's one of the worst
[1:09:32] things about social media in my opinion
[1:09:34] is everybody puts it out there and then
[1:09:36] it's the world's thoughts not just a few
[1:09:38] people that heard you say it that's why
[1:09:40] I had the cameras turned off the other
[1:09:41] day to some things you say you don't
[1:09:44] want everybody to hear it's for just a
[1:09:46] person or a group of people right see
[1:09:49] but you can't judge their thought that's
[1:09:51] their property you don't know that's
[1:09:53] what their intent was you can say well
[1:09:55] this look like this look like this
[1:09:57] like this and that's fine and a lot of
[1:09:59] people look at and judge based on that
[1:10:01] but you don't know unless that person
[1:10:03] said that or actually did that you don't
[1:10:06] know see you can't judge their thoughts
[1:10:09] as such if it might have something in
[1:10:12] their heart there I'll go back for just
[1:10:14] a moment I want to read these quotes but
[1:10:16] I'll go back for just a moment as I had
[1:10:18] told you about the testimony of that
[1:10:20] sister Nadine words gave I got it on my
[1:10:23] camera oh my own my phone I can show it
[1:10:26] to you I'd love to show it to you maybe
[1:10:27] sometime but I went back and looked at
[1:10:30] it again her testimony about her dad you
[1:10:33] know her dad they went to a funeral
[1:10:35] brother Brandon was there and she was
[1:10:37] crying brother Graham came up and said
[1:10:39] you know sister Nadine are you okay she
[1:10:42] was crying and and she said I know my
[1:10:45] dad's in hell and you know she said he
[1:10:50] had no time for preachers he'd go to
[1:10:52] church and all these things you know but
[1:10:54] what she's doing is perceiving the man's
[1:10:57] fault because he didn't go to church it
[1:11:02] was because he hated God because he
[1:11:05] didn't want to speak to ministers is
[1:11:07] because he hated God at every road that
[1:11:12] normally normally that's probably true
[1:11:15] normally that's probably true but you
[1:11:18] can't judge that based on that evidence
[1:11:21] alone that's as you would say
[1:11:23] circumstantial evidence I hope I'm not
[1:11:25] losing I'm just trying to make a point
[1:11:29] here she thought her daddy was in hell
[1:11:33] because the thoughts she perceived that
[1:11:36] he had based on his action is that she
[1:11:41] was he didn't go to church well he
[1:11:43] wasn't a Christian didn't love God
[1:11:45] didn't have time for ministers because
[1:11:47] you know he didn't want to be a Christie
[1:11:50] infidel he must hate God because he
[1:11:52] wanted her go to church didn't want to
[1:11:54] talk to any ministers or anything like
[1:11:56] that took infidelities and unbeliever
[1:11:58] he's going to hell but brother Ram came
[1:12:01] up to her at her testimony put his
[1:12:05] finger in her face and looked at her
[1:12:07] she said only brother branham could look
[1:12:09] at you I don't know what that's like
[1:12:11] because he never looked at me maybe if
[1:12:16] he looked at you he put his finger in
[1:12:18] her face and she said looked at her the
[1:12:21] old only brother branham could look at
[1:12:24] you and said sister Nadine can't we be
[1:12:27] happy or thankful whatever words were
[1:12:30] that God judges by the heart God looks
[1:12:33] at a man's heart he said I believe that
[1:12:37] your daddy will be there with you and
[1:12:39] your mother on that day well now what
[1:12:42] was he judging what was he looking at
[1:12:45] what was God looking at what was she
[1:12:48] judging what was her respect at that
[1:12:52] point for her dad pretty low if she
[1:12:55] thought he was going to hell but what
[1:12:58] was brother branham stop what was his
[1:12:59] respect ultimately what was God's cuz
[1:13:04] God wasn't judging whether man set foot
[1:13:07] in church he was judging the man's heart
[1:13:08] what was in his heart now most of the
[1:13:12] time that's probably going to be true if
[1:13:14] it's in your heart it's going to compel
[1:13:16] you to want to go who knows I've known
[1:13:22] I've known people before that wouldn't
[1:13:25] do something or would do something a
[1:13:28] certain way and you think well that's
[1:13:29] just kind of cockeyed why would they do
[1:13:31] that
[1:13:31] it's kind of an odd way of why would
[1:13:35] they do that or why would they not do
[1:13:36] this and I'd get to know people and come
[1:13:41] to find out that persons like that
[1:13:43] because of their childhood or something
[1:13:46] they went through in their early
[1:13:47] adulthood or something that shaped their
[1:13:50] spirit to the point that that that just
[1:13:53] ended it that was all of it I mean one
[1:13:56] when we started the church in Florida I
[1:13:59] went to visit people that were faithful
[1:14:01] church attendees before certain things
[1:14:03] happened at another church they were
[1:14:06] faithful attendees they went to church
[1:14:08] all the time then with this happened at
[1:14:10] that church they quit going and I go
[1:14:12] witness to them they would never set
[1:14:14] foot in another Church does that mean
[1:14:16] they're going to
[1:14:17] I would say no they might but that
[1:14:22] doesn't mean that they are because of
[1:14:24] that you understand where that that
[1:14:27] level of respect has to stay or it has
[1:14:30] to maintain to say well I still believe
[1:14:33] you to be a son or daughter of God for
[1:14:36] some reason in their life and their
[1:14:37] spirit they can't get beyond that one
[1:14:39] point but that's not their fault god
[1:14:43] help them so well they should be
[1:14:45] stronger and move forward what let you
[1:14:47] go through it and see how you feel about
[1:14:49] it it's a lot of what's missing in the
[1:14:53] world today as well walking them all and
[1:14:55] no man's market that's another thing is
[1:14:58] missing so desperately today people want
[1:15:01] to criticize and complain and down this
[1:15:03] and that one without it walking a few
[1:15:05] minutes in their shoes trying to
[1:15:07] understand why they might be that way or
[1:15:09] why they might have done a certain thing
[1:15:11] it's all because the respect has been
[1:15:14] gone the respect has been lost god help
[1:15:18] us don't ever let it creep into us
[1:15:20] that's ungodly friend I'm trying to tell
[1:15:22] you today having that lack of respect is
[1:15:25] ungodly look what brother Branham said
[1:15:28] here in rig in the in the message
[1:15:30] respects 1961 he said I fear my mother I
[1:15:36] fear my wife I fear my church I fear all
[1:15:42] of God's servants unless I should put a
[1:15:45] stumbling block somewhere in their way
[1:15:48] you understand what he's saying he's not
[1:15:50] saying I literally am afraid of my
[1:15:53] congregation he's not saying I am
[1:15:55] literally afraid of my wife what his
[1:15:58] fear is or what his teaching of that was
[1:16:01] at the time was I'm afraid lest I make a
[1:16:04] mistake or I'd do something to cause a
[1:16:06] stumbling block to be put in your way or
[1:16:09] my wife or my mother whatever he said to
[1:16:12] you see that that presence of fear
[1:16:17] brings a presence of respect because you
[1:16:22] fear hurting that person of putting a
[1:16:26] stumbling block so that respect that you
[1:16:28] have for them
[1:16:29] becomes prevalent then it's a part of
[1:16:32] your relationships a part of how you
[1:16:34] feel towards that person I fear the
[1:16:38] people I fear the people of the city
[1:16:40] unless I should do something wrong that
[1:16:43] would cause them to think that I wasn't
[1:16:45] a Christian you understand that now see
[1:16:49] you've got before you can have respects
[1:16:52] you've got to have fear and God demands
[1:16:57] it he demands respect God demands
[1:17:00] respect amen and we respect the Lord
[1:17:04] right we often say that we respect the
[1:17:07] Lord in but in what way just because we
[1:17:12] think we know who he is or because we
[1:17:15] think he's going to send us to hell or
[1:17:17] because why is it that we believe we
[1:17:20] have respect for God and why is it that
[1:17:23] we think that people think that they
[1:17:25] have respect for God when they don't
[1:17:27] have respect for one another
[1:17:30] certain people are very demonstrative
[1:17:34] about taking other's lives while at the
[1:17:37] same time doing it in the name of a god
[1:17:41] well if you respect that God who
[1:17:44] commands respect you're gonna respect
[1:17:46] those that he created if you really
[1:17:48] think he's God see the fallacy of some
[1:17:51] religions out there today isn't even
[1:17:53] easy to even comprehendible it's not
[1:17:56] even defensible to understand certain
[1:17:59] religions in this world today they have
[1:18:02] so little respect for human life but yet
[1:18:05] they do it in the name of their God who
[1:18:07] they claim created everything how can
[1:18:11] you have respect for God that created
[1:18:12] everything and not had respect for his
[1:18:14] creation you can't do it both ways amen
[1:18:21] God demands respect but that respect
[1:18:24] comes from a reverence comes from a fear
[1:18:27] understand proverbs probably we'll get
[1:18:31] back to James
[1:18:31] but proverbs 9
[1:18:34] we know what's odd this about just
[1:18:36] reading here in proverbs 9 verse 10 the
[1:18:41] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:18:43] wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is
[1:18:46] understanding the fear of the Lord is
[1:18:48] the beginning what does them think we
[1:18:49] know that quote we know that scripture
[1:18:50] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:18:52] wisdom what is that that fears what
[1:18:54] brings that respect that God demands
[1:18:57] that respect it's reverence it's
[1:19:00] considered of worthy of esteem honor
[1:19:04] deep migration see that's the feeling of
[1:19:08] the respect we have for God well if that
[1:19:11] same thing with God we have that same
[1:19:14] feeling to each other to one another
[1:19:16] just like brother grant thank you I fear
[1:19:19] lest I do something that they might
[1:19:20] think I'm not a Christian God demands
[1:19:24] respected that because that God is God
[1:19:27] he deserves respect that's right and he
[1:19:30] we've got to respect him and give a fear
[1:19:33] to him that brings respect God has
[1:19:36] demanded that for himself and for all
[1:19:38] his servants for all his servants God
[1:19:42] demands respect for his servants you
[1:19:45] remember one time when Miriam
[1:19:47] disrespected Moses race
[1:19:50] Miriam disrespected Moses talked about
[1:19:53] and laughed about it and she was
[1:19:55] immediately struck with leprosy
[1:19:59] unfortunately a lot of spiritual leprosy
[1:20:02] going on in this world today they may
[1:20:04] not be breaking out in white blotches in
[1:20:07] their face falling off but there's
[1:20:10] spiritual leprosy or the spiritual
[1:20:13] aspect of the life is eroding away just
[1:20:16] like a cancer because of their lack of
[1:20:18] respect oh my
[1:20:21] help us Lord you said well I don't agree
[1:20:23] with that person that doesn't mean you
[1:20:25] lost you lose your respect for that
[1:20:27] person amen then you then as you respect
[1:20:32] that servant you respect God and when I
[1:20:35] respect you and you respect me and we
[1:20:37] respect each other we are respecting God
[1:20:41] exactly now
[1:20:44] I just I wasn't gonna read these till
[1:20:47] later but I just got to this point so
[1:20:48] let me read this here we'll get through
[1:20:50] this and I'll close here in the globe
[1:20:52] see on the same message respect if you
[1:20:55] can't respect the man respect the office
[1:20:58] that he holds in God so there you go see
[1:21:01] now he covers that part that point now
[1:21:04] has been covered for us if you can't
[1:21:06] respect the man respect the office of
[1:21:09] the office he holds in God that's
[1:21:11] exactly right
[1:21:12] respect him you know there's there's
[1:21:15] people out there there's there's
[1:21:17] ministers that I'll be honest with you I
[1:21:20] disagree probably 98% Christian
[1:21:24] ministers saying they're preaching from
[1:21:27] the Bible but if they walk through that
[1:21:30] door I'd hug their neck and call it my
[1:21:31] brother absolutely would I don't want to
[1:21:36] call any names and I'm not talking about
[1:21:38] the message I just you know people that
[1:21:40] you've heard on the radio or seen on TV
[1:21:42] or televangelists or something people
[1:21:44] with these big huge mega churches and
[1:21:45] whatever there's a lot of things out
[1:21:47] here I'd absolutely disagree with but if
[1:21:50] they walk through that folks brother
[1:21:51] walk through that door I'd hook their
[1:21:53] deck right even if one of those women
[1:21:55] came through there wouldn't up her neck
[1:21:57] but I'd shake her hand and say god bless
[1:21:58] you you ever listened you have you ever
[1:22:01] done a study or looked at how brother
[1:22:02] branham talked about any simple
[1:22:04] mcpherson the most well-known revered
[1:22:07] woman and creature of his day brother
[1:22:10] madam showed a lot of respect for that
[1:22:12] woman he even after her passing he
[1:22:16] showed a lot of respect in the things
[1:22:18] that you read about her now he had
[1:22:20] talked about she should have been
[1:22:21] preaching he'll talk about that he
[1:22:23] disagreed with her but he had respect
[1:22:25] for her that's that guy shoot that's we
[1:22:31] can't lose that all right because I'm
[1:22:34] trying to help us to understand that's a
[1:22:36] godly aspect yes it's a godly aspect to
[1:22:41] have respect
[1:22:44] there's a place over there you feel you
[1:22:46] go where you feel comfortable that's a
[1:22:49] that's a godly attribute respect is the
[1:22:52] godly attribute now if I can't get
[1:22:55] anything else through you today that get
[1:22:58] that locked in respect for one another
[1:23:01] is a godly contributor I'm gonna get it
[1:23:07] I'm not gonna call it political but it
[1:23:12] just came to my mind so I'm gonna say
[1:23:15] when a man black white green purple
[1:23:18] yellow service person policeman preacher
[1:23:25] layman ditch digger out here who press
[1:23:36] is another human being I don't care what
[1:23:38] these black white purple green yellow
[1:23:40] blue down on the ground for ten minutes
[1:23:43] where he can't breathe and immerse him
[1:23:46] that's the lack of respect that person
[1:23:50] has lost respect not yet necessarily
[1:23:53] just for that one individual but for all
[1:23:55] of humanity you don't do something like
[1:23:59] that unless you have absolutely lost
[1:24:01] respect and disrespect the human race
[1:24:05] may be that person individually but if
[1:24:08] that thing is in your heart you don't
[1:24:10] care anything about human life and human
[1:24:12] life being precious amen personally I
[1:24:17] think it has a lot more to do with the
[1:24:19] fact that the man was a cop and not a
[1:24:20] cop but anyway does that that's my point
[1:24:24] though it doesn't matter
[1:24:26] what matters is having respect for one
[1:24:29] another if you have respect for one
[1:24:31] another you're gonna treat that person
[1:24:33] with respect whether you're a cop or
[1:24:35] civilian whether you're a restaurant
[1:24:37] worker I should say oh wait staff or a
[1:24:42] customer you understand that person is
[1:24:45] gonna treat you respect you a treat
[1:24:47] with respect it's so easily lost today
[1:24:51] friend we have to hold on to that and
[1:24:53] again we can't let it become a part of
[1:24:55] our lives see if you can't respect the
[1:25:00] man respect office he holds in God I'd
[1:25:02] absolutely walk through that door shake
[1:25:04] his hand hug his neck or whatever
[1:25:05] respect him if if a minister comes up
[1:25:08] your pastor always respect him
[1:25:11] I've heard of congregations talk about
[1:25:13] their pastor how just talk about him
[1:25:15] running down ridicule him how is that
[1:25:18] pastor ever going to do anything for you
[1:25:21] he cannot help you if you feel that way
[1:25:26] the respect has to be there if it's not
[1:25:29] then if majority of the church feels
[1:25:33] that way you vote that pit that preacher
[1:25:34] out you get a different one if that's
[1:25:38] the leading of the Lord if you're the
[1:25:40] only one that feels that way find your
[1:25:41] pastor wherever he is you go find him
[1:25:45] because God is your godly Holy Ghost
[1:25:46] filled person God's got a pastor for you
[1:25:49] go sit under him I had a brother one
[1:25:53] time told me in Florida that someone so
[1:25:56] is his pastor I was for a while I said
[1:25:58] well if that's what you believe then you
[1:26:00] need to move there right you need to go
[1:26:02] there and Senator that his ministry and
[1:26:05] give that church where tithes in
[1:26:07] attendance that's how you remember of
[1:26:10] that church we don't have rolls but you
[1:26:13] have a way of respecting that ministry
[1:26:16] in that church and that's by being there
[1:26:19] and paying your tithes and offerings
[1:26:20] into that into that work in like that
[1:26:26] very much but it's the truth
[1:26:28] I think they finally actually did I know
[1:26:30] they actually finally didn't move but
[1:26:32] that's just I'm sorry friend it's just
[1:26:34] the way I feel that's that's how
[1:26:37] respects come I didn't have any
[1:26:40] disrespect for them
[1:26:41] anybody that leaves his church or
[1:26:44] whatever that's nobody's disrespect to
[1:26:45] me God's got a pastor for everybody and
[1:26:49] if I'm not you find him were Korea's
[1:26:52] find him
[1:26:53] was that's the person that's ordained to
[1:26:56] lead you through
[1:26:58] amen it's got to be there the Holy Ghost
[1:27:01] has made him overseer that you've got to
[1:27:03] respect him in that manner see no matter
[1:27:05] what the pastor done if you respect him
[1:27:07] in your heart God's servant that will
[1:27:09] respect you for doing it
[1:27:11] amen and brother Branham goes on talks
[1:27:13] about I may disagree with the man's
[1:27:15] theology and such but let's move on with
[1:27:17] this James chapter 2 let me finish this
[1:27:20] because I'm going to close here you find
[1:27:23] out where I left off here even judge IVA
[1:27:26] Faust v first hearken my beloved brother
[1:27:28] had not God chosen the poor of this
[1:27:31] world rich in faith Amen I'm thankful
[1:27:34] for that and heirs of the kingdom which
[1:27:38] he had promised to them that love him
[1:27:41] but he have despised the poor do not
[1:27:45] rich men oppress you and draw you before
[1:27:48] the judgment seat my I'd like to go
[1:27:51] somewhere there but we're gonna but this
[1:27:54] is so true oh my Bobby no more evident
[1:27:58] than what's going on this country today
[1:28:01] do not they blaspheme that worthy name
[1:28:04] by which ye are called if you fulfill
[1:28:07] the royal law according to the scripture
[1:28:08] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:28:11] ye do well amen and now notice that
[1:28:17] again that's just like you said in
[1:28:18] Matthew I mean just like back in
[1:28:22] Leviticus if you love your neighbor as
[1:28:25] thyself you do well remember Jesus gave
[1:28:28] that the rich young ruler is one of the
[1:28:29] commandments what in one of the Ten
[1:28:31] Commandments and don't covet and things
[1:28:33] like that but it doesn't say but it does
[1:28:35] say in Leviticus in the law when God's
[1:28:38] giving the law through Moses in the
[1:28:41] Vidigal the Ten Commandments but then
[1:28:44] it's so important that Jesus told the
[1:28:46] rich young ruler that same thing you
[1:28:48] need to love your neighbor as yourself
[1:28:49] well Jesus said here if you fulfill the
[1:28:52] Royal law court of the scripture thou
[1:28:54] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ye do
[1:28:57] well well if you love your neighbors
[1:28:59] yourself then you're gonna have respect
[1:29:01] for that person
[1:29:01] and who is your neighbor not just the
[1:29:04] message believer I'm just the person
[1:29:06] sitting on the chair next to you not
[1:29:08] just the local churches down the street
[1:29:10] or in this city or town or even in this
[1:29:12] country its whoever you come across
[1:29:16] everybody anybody doesn't matter who it
[1:29:20] is anybody but if you have respect to
[1:29:25] persons you commit sin god help us if
[1:29:28] you have respect to persons you commit
[1:29:31] sin and ye are convinced of the law as
[1:29:33] trans graders as transgressors for
[1:29:36] whosoever shall keep the whole law and
[1:29:38] yet offend in one point he is guilty of
[1:29:41] all for he that said do not commit
[1:29:44] adultery all said also do not kill
[1:29:47] now if they'll commit no adultery yet if
[1:29:49] thou killed thou art become a
[1:29:51] transgressor of the law and if you have
[1:29:54] no respect for persons as loving thy
[1:29:58] neighbor's yourself then it's the same
[1:30:01] difference
[1:30:01] amen you have transgressed the law you
[1:30:04] have transgressed God's commandment
[1:30:07] God's law but it's important if God has
[1:30:12] no respecter of person we should not
[1:30:15] have any respecter of ours no matter who
[1:30:17] they are that respect has got to be
[1:30:20] there again and that fear fear of the
[1:30:22] Lord but also a fear of others you put
[1:30:28] it up others but as the point is that
[1:30:31] you had fear that you might do something
[1:30:34] that would cause a stumbling block or
[1:30:36] cause you to disbelieve or cause you to
[1:30:39] go astray or something or or or cause
[1:30:44] somebody to feel less about you than
[1:30:46] they ought to go out to help us none of
[1:30:48] us want to do that none of us want to be
[1:30:51] that way that we live our lives
[1:30:53] according to God's Word according to
[1:30:56] God's holy ordinance we live our lives
[1:30:57] so that we we fall under the auspice of
[1:31:00] of the word and it respects for God as
[1:31:03] we have respects for each other
[1:31:05] you know brother Brandon said God would
[1:31:07] rather me love him love you than love
[1:31:09] well it's the same if the respect and
[1:31:12] the loves is is relations if you respect
[1:31:16] out of love then it's gonna be the same
[1:31:18] way I respect you I respect him if I
[1:31:21] don't have respect for you how can I
[1:31:23] have respect free now
[1:31:24] Amen that respect now that respect will
[1:31:29] breed obedience if you have respect
[1:31:32] you're gonna have obedience you're gonna
[1:31:34] you're gonna desire to do out of
[1:31:37] respects what God commands amen and
[1:31:41] maybe Lord bloom will talk about that
[1:31:42] later but we'll just end up there but
[1:31:44] that respect now remember that respect
[1:31:47] is it is the godly attribute that God
[1:31:51] has gift to us that we are to display to
[1:31:53] one another amen
[1:31:55] never look down so well that person's
[1:31:57] poor that person is out here begging
[1:31:59] don't look down on that person I'm not
[1:32:02] telling you give me any money that's up
[1:32:03] to you what you feel led to do of God
[1:32:05] telling you that but don't disrespect
[1:32:07] that person don't look down on that
[1:32:09] person I mean I've seen perfectly
[1:32:12] healthy 20 year-olds out there now with
[1:32:14] my tip almost I was about to go up and
[1:32:16] say you know the winner still tiring but
[1:32:19] I didn't wanted to sound disrespectful
[1:32:22] but it just seems to me like sometimes
[1:32:25] that's the solution to homelessness and
[1:32:28] just go get a job but anyway that but
[1:32:31] again even outside of that that you
[1:32:34] don't lose you can't lose respect in
[1:32:36] that way amen
[1:32:38] and again if you lose respect for
[1:32:40] anybody you can't help that person if
[1:32:44] you have completely lost respect for
[1:32:46] someone you're not going to want to help
[1:32:47] that person because you don't respect
[1:32:49] them enough to to deem them worthy of
[1:32:52] your time and presence God is that's an
[1:32:56] ungodly thought
[1:32:59] that someone would not be worthy of your
[1:33:01] time and presence to be able to help
[1:33:03] them in some way they been got to
[1:33:06] maintain that respect respects in the
[1:33:09] church respects and should the the
[1:33:12] Christian family respects in in God and
[1:33:15] in God's family amen any and humanity
[1:33:18] and all they got did go one more place
[1:33:23] and I'm gonna quit you know brother man
[1:33:25] talked about and you know brother Brad
[1:33:27] was a hunter brother man I'm hunted and
[1:33:29] killed thousands of animals in his
[1:33:31] lifetime probably I would guess probably
[1:33:33] thousands from the squirrels to the you
[1:33:37] know the big game and stuff like that he
[1:33:38] probably maybe not that many buddy I'm
[1:33:41] hundreds will say at least in his life
[1:33:44] but you know the same man that did that
[1:33:47] said I'll take one time that if a person
[1:33:50] goes and just shoots and kills an animal
[1:33:52] just to let it late for no reason he
[1:33:54] called that murder yes now I'm the first
[1:33:57] person then then up to hear what the
[1:34:01] dogs is human thing I'm tired of seeing
[1:34:04] them in my stores and my restaurants I'm
[1:34:07] just up to here with the dogs but anyway
[1:34:09] I don't agree with someone taking his
[1:34:14] shooting or killing an animal like that
[1:34:16] brother Graham called it murder
[1:34:18] now my thought of that was because of
[1:34:22] the lack of respect that you have for
[1:34:24] God's creation God created that animal
[1:34:26] and you just go kill it let it lay for
[1:34:29] no reason that's wrong that's wrong
[1:34:33] because that's disrespecting God's
[1:34:35] creation right amen
[1:34:38] just another thought so if it comes to
[1:34:40] even animal life Ram what is it for us
[1:34:42] as humans amen let's stand if we could
[1:34:59] help us Lord to always and continue to
[1:35:03] have respect and honor for one another
[1:35:07] love for one another look up to one
[1:35:12] another be respectful of one another and
[1:35:16] have that respect not just not just here
[1:35:19] in our church but for each one whomever
[1:35:22] God sends us to amen I'm so thankful
[1:35:28] that God put us put in us to be able to
[1:35:30] do that amen thank you Jesus
[1:35:42] let's see this on the course here number
