hard time breathing too so remember her in prayer and of course we know brother Dennis is still battling with that uh situation he has uh he said he had a real good day yesterday and even told Danny

feet now amen we'll go ahead and change word of the service amen prise the Lord just a simple thought this morning we had in our new year amen we'll get back to the other um our subject we've been on we'll get back to that Lord Willie maybe next Sunday but I just wanted to bring something this morning for uh few minutes of starting our new year off amen starting our new year off the importance of starting that new year off praise the Lord amen if you here have your Bibles home uh Exodus chapter 3 Exodus chapter 3 we're just going to read a couple of verses of scripture here amen Exodus chapter 3 again won't be very lengthy today but just a a thought just to encourage for the new year coming up and then with just a few hours away from a new year could never have imagined of when I was young that would ever even reach the 2000s much less 2024 but it's right at hand so we'll just make the best of what the Lord has given us and before we read let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could Precious Jesus Lord thanking you so much for your word thank you Lord for the message for the truth thank you Lord for your blessings to us and every day God lord we've come through another year and Lord we've come out with health and strength and life and blessings and and Lord you've watched over us you've kept us you've strengthened us you've helped us lord it's been a tough year in some ways it's been a tremendous year in other ways it's been a great blessing Lord to us in some ways and great trials in others but Lord through it all God we're in your hands through it all God we're with you father and you are with us thank you Lord for all the blessings you give us Lord and thank you for this time for this place may you speak to us from your word now Lord help encourage Us in hear something that we should know that would bless and strengthen Us in some way we thank you God for being with us and watching over us and keeping us in your protective care Lord we just commit ourselves to you now pray that your Holy Spirit would have its way in this service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and Exodus chapter 3 we'll just read a u first five verses here Exodus 3 1-5 now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian he led the flock to The Backs side of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to HB the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the uh out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire but the bush the Bush was not consumed Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not hither uh uh nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where on thou standest is Holy Ground amen you could be seated if you'd like amen Moses uh uh not unlike most of us in our lives and most of of course those live their lives through the scripture uh live their lives uh every day one day at a time one step at a time one heartbeat at a time and they live their lives the way they live their lives and so many times we all live our lives the same way and that's the way the Lord intended us for to live our lives but you know as each year unfolds and starts into a new year it it starts getting people thinking normally most people think about and reflect upon what the last year held and and what the last year was for them and what it meant to them and what they went through and and all and and what they wanted to change maybe to come in the new year uh what do I want to change in my life for the new year a lot of times people call it a resolution a new New Year's resolution a lot of people make resolutions I don't know how much people do that anymore but used to be a big thing people would make resolutions I remember when I worked in Charlotte uh in office and people would come in the office the next day that they came in after a new year started and everybody had a re resolution they were going to do this they were going to change that and this is going to be better and this is going to be better and uh this is going to be different and everybody always had a resolution and of course by the time January basically faded out a lot of people had already uh had already uh lost that resolution they they they no longer were falling in that resolution whether to stop drinking or stop smoking or exercise more or go to church more or whatever it was uh everybody seemed to have some sort of a resolution something that they wanted when they started into the new year and and and there's nothing wrong with that Reflections good to start a new year and would I do different and what would I change and how would I want to make myself better or be better or uh how would I want to make other lives better other people uh have more quality of life something uh that that's different uh that that would change a person's life uh that would be something that would when that year ended they would reflect back on in and say I'm glad I did this and I'm glad I changed that and I'm glad I kept doing this or whatever and and made that sort of a resolution but you know uh I think that resolution or or it should be more than a resolution it should be something that's in our hearts as Christians but it should be that thing that brother brandham said that I'll read here as brother brandham preached in the stat of a perfect man he made this statement and I believe it's true I believe it's true for all of us as as we all ENT enter into a new year uh I believe this is important and it's pertinent for all of us uh brother Ram said see we've escaped now uh he's talking about uh uh Jesus addressing to the Church of scripture he had just read and that's why and that's why we're here this morning is to find out God's way what is God's requirements he says there's not a person in here that loves God but what wants to be more like Christ amen now I believe that's probably the best as we would still call it a resolution as anybody can have to want to become more like Christ and brother Bram giving the benefit of the doubt of course to everybody sitting there he prefaces obviously by saying that loves God uh any person here that loves God but want but what wants to become more like Christ amen more like Christ and that's probably the best thing that we could say about this today is that we want to become more like Christ that's the whole thing to have a closer walk with the Lord to be closer to him and in in in every way to become more like him amen now he said it's laid out here every Christian I'm an old veteran look at brother and sister kid here they're probably the oldest in the building but if I asked them what is your greatest heart's desire I'm sure it'd be to be closer to God when you learn of Christ there's something about him that so loving that you just try to get right into him amen just get right into him now there's something about us in every way in every year there's always the thing that we look at that was something that was of a significance in our lives that Drew us to the Lord and uh we read the account that Moses had Moses went through his life you know all about the supernatural thing of Moses life but this one event that took place that Drew Moses to God it was the one thing that that uh that was you could say was a an outstanding thing it was a miracle something Supernatural that had happened in Moses life because the Bush was burning looked like it was on fire but it was not being consumed so he decided that he would turn aside from everything else to go look at this bush to examine this bush to see what was going on with it and when God saw that he turned aside to go see the bush God then spoke to him God put Moses is in the position now a lot of times people say well I did this or I did that God always see man remember what brother Ram said brother Ram said man never went looking for God God has always come looking for man even from the beginning In the Garden of Eden when man and uh when when a man and woman fell uh and they tried to hide themselves or tried to separate themselves that God come down and he was looking for man it's been that way ever since God has always been looking for man so people could say I did this that no God always is the instigator God is always the one that starts the thing to bring us to a place that he can speak to us or show us something or some way to get our attention he used the burning bush to do that for Moses and when he got Moses's attention and Moses decided Moses had to make the conscious decision that I'm going to go and forget everything else I'm going to turn aside I'm going to shoe everything else and go to see what this bush is about and when he got there he stepped on the Holy Ground and God began to speak to him and when God begin to speak to him it's just like brother brandom said here it's when God gets a hold of your heart something takes place when God it's just something about him when God gets a hold of you and changes your life that brings you into him that wants you that makes you want want to desire more of him and then at that point when that Turning Point takes place then man begins to seek God man begins to read their Bible and pray and seek the Lord and trust God for everything that there have that they have need of by faith believing that that God is going to take care of them that that God is going to be with them so as we enter into a new year as we enter into 2024 we can know by faith that God is going to to be with us that God is going to take care of us we turn aside from everything else and we follow after him and that event that comes in our lives now in that our lives have been changed there's always events in our entire life that that cause us to continue to move forward to continue to grow closer to continue to become more like God there's always that something in our lives now it shouldn't take the turning over of a new year to do it but a lot of times again that reflection of the old year what could I have done different or what could I have changed or what could I have made better or how could I have been more like God or just anything that you can think that that would that would bring you forward into the new year I know a lot of us and our congregation is getting up in years and all of us are getting older but there's something still that drives us in our hearts that wants us to press forward and continue to to walk walk that walk that God has put before us the steps that God has ordered for us so that we can become more like him so that in our lives our lives can reflect Jesus Christ and just as Moses did at that time there at that place Moses became a new person we became new people and every day it's a renewal amen not just a new birth which we've talked about so much recently which is absolutely of the most importance because you can't have a renewal unless you have the new birth a renewal continually well this time of year we kind of reflects upon that that we kind of look back and say Lord what could we have done different what could we have done better how could we have been closer to you how could we have been more like you what can we do to change what can we do to get closer all those things go through our heads because because we love the Lord and as brother randam said I don't believe there's a a person out there or person in here that that that would say in your heart that you love God and that you want to get closer to God Amen look uh let's go over to Acts chapter N I want to look at Acts chapter n now Acts chapter n another story of a great man Moses got his Moses lived a good good life Moses was a good man raised in the hallowed Halls of Egypt and all that he went through now we going to talk about another man another another righteous man another man you couldn't put a a finger on his life a man that lived to every bit of of what the the the Torah the the the teachings of the high priest and all that they had that they had done had been through that lived it to a te a model Christian if you will he wasn't Christian obviously but uh a model of what uh would be considered uh a Pious Christian today amen Paul Saul Saul was a man that was that that was just like that but as Saul went through his life Saul thought he was doing great Saul thought he was I I'm sure Saul probably thought he was right dabbing the center of God's perfect will I imagine Saul probably thought that that he was doing God a service when he was going and putting out others that were of the way of of Jesus he was putting them out of he probably thought he was doing exactly what he was called to do he probably thought he was right Cent right dead center in the God's perfect will but God had something different for Saul amen chapter n Acts chapter 9 verse one and Saul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest now remember the scripture also says that they will kill you thinking that they're doing God of service right amen kill you now that doesn't mean they take a gun or a or a knife but they kill your character amen they use the tongue to kill a person's character is just as good as dead Jesus said you hate a brother without a cause you've murdered him already so here of obviously this day they would imprison them and kill them today they just imprison them and kill them with their tongues but it's the same result actually it's even worse amen even worse but see how he saw breathing out threatening as a Slaughter doing it as the scripture said that they would do it to you thinking that they're doing God a service we're doing God a service by by by slandering this person by ridiculing this person by belittling or putting this person we're doing God a service that's exactly what people think they believe they're in the middle of God's perfect will but Saul had something God had something in store for Saul second verse and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogue that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem and as and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shine round about him a light from Heaven suddenly just like it was on the day of Pentecost remember the day of Pentecost suddenly there was a sound suddenly there was a cloud suddenly as they were sitting there the Holy Spirit came in there and lit upon each one of them suddenly just like here in the upper room did it to uh to Saul Paul who who didn't was not able to receive that Upper Room experience he received it here which proves that you did not have to be in the upper room at that time with 120 to receive an upper room experience amen and millions since his time have received an upper room experience by God suddenly coming into your life into your heart he suddenly there shine right around about him a light from heaven now Paul Saul was a smart man uh educated sat at the feet of Melia learned uh uh all the things brilliant smart man even talks about through the scripture how he could speak to the people with great swelling words of wisdom he could use his intellect to try to uh to try to Spur the intellect of people but he chose not to do that he chose to speak just calm and plain just like God gave it to him to reach down to the hearts of man not to their intellect he could have done it because he was a smart man intelligent man uh knew the Torah in and out knew the word in and out so when he saw this he knew there was something about it it all of a sudden struck his heart God saw in the middle of living what he I believe he believed was probably the perfect life that he could live under the high priest living that perfect life he believed that he could do this he believed that he could uh continue to lead that life but God had a different plan for for Saul God had a different plan for Paul even changed his name as we know God had a different plan so when that came amen notice Moses turned aside to see this great sight but God shined a light down upon Paul amen upon Saul and stopped him in his tracks and he heard a voice speaking and that voice said Saul Saul why persecutest thou me as he fell to the Earth amen as he as Saul fell to the Earth he heard that voice crying out Saul Saul why persecutest thou me now this was not an ignorant man smart man he could remember look in this in in his word in the Torah he could look and he could remember that same thing that same light that led the children of Israel out of Egypt is that light that's shining around him and he knew there was something about it and when it struck his heart when it struck his heart it was some a voice that spoke just like the voice spoke to Moses the boy spoke to Moses and said Moses this is Holy Ground take your shoes off he speaking to Saul and says Saul why are you persecuting me amen now Mo Saul spoke back and said who art thou Lord now he wasn't called just anything Lord he was too well talk too well schooled he was too much uh uh of a of a Godly Man at that point to called anything Lord uh again this was a righteous man this was a Saul is a godly man God just had to have took him on a Twist took him on a turn from where he was going so he knew that there was something about that you never would have he never would have called it Lord unless he knew that that was the same thing that he had read or knew of back in the old T back in back in his in the Torah he would have known that's why he says who art thou Lord Lord amen see that's a very significant word a lot of people people don't take a lot of credence to nowadays for some reasons it seems to be overused but the word Lord means that that that that Lord is Lord over you that Lord is your owner that Lord is your ruler that Lord is the person that you obey that's what Lord means that's extremely people say the Lord Jesus Christ that means Jesus Christ is our Lord so when he says Lord he's addressing him with reverence and humility Lord who art thou and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks and he trembling and astonished said Lord what Willl thou have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou must do simple conversation conversation between him and God didn't last a few seconds maybe a minute when he just said Lord what what would you have me to do see God had already gotten a hold of his heart already got his attention made him recognize you've been going along all of your life you've been doing all these great things you've learned and you've you you've you've studied and you know the Torah and Paul studied the Torah so much that he was even accused of being a crazy person for studying so much in the scripture I forgot who it was that accused Saul Paul of being a crazy man said you're going mad you you study too much you read too much you're going crazy Paul you need to stop some of that you need to cut back a little bit he says oh no no no I'm in my right mind I know exactly where I'm at amen he studied see he knew it so much God said okay it's time it's time for you to make that turn amen and Moses remember wrote most of the Old Testament amen you had of course the the the time and the laws and but Moses is the one that put the laws down Genesis Exodus Leviticus and all he's the one that Moses wrote as brother brandom said most of the Old Testament now Paul sa ended up having God changed his name to Paul ended up writing most of the New Testament because God had to have another a change for them something a turn amen and a lot of times a lot of us go through those things that we that that in our lives that we want to change that we want to do something whatever what we need to do to become more like God uh again the call today uh what what would we be willing to do or give up or whatever in our lives to become more like God to become closer to God of of what degree of importance is it to us uh to become more like God how important is it to us to become closer to God look I want to read you something brother brandom said here look he said now trying to do God a service streetport Louisiana this is one of the services of the Thanksgiving meetings there at Jack Moors in 1965 November 1965 brother Bram says while every head is bowed every ey is closed all across the nation raise your hand here in the visible audience and out there too and I'll offer a prayer for you that's all I can do I cannot feel it God bless you I cannot feel it God bless you and you and you I cannot feel it God bless you hands going up he says visible audience everywhere feel it feel me Lord feel me thank you sister he's doing the call God God bless you Sister he says now uh I've caught the most of the sincere trying to be uh uh I want to raise my hands with you he said now listen he said oh Lord never let me come to a standstill amen that's important as brother bham was recognizing how easy it is for us to become complacent for us to come uh uh come to a standstill a place that we think well everything's great I'm doing fine everything's good uh I'm a good Christian I got a good family I got a good church and all these things got a good job all these things are great and just and just kind of get stagnant with the Lord to kind of come to a standstill with the Lord that's why the question then of what importance is it to us that we get closer to God in this new year how important is it to us that we walk a higher walk that we walk a closer walk of what importance is it brother R said Lord never let me come to a standstill so what does that mean that means that we always until we draw our last breath should be trying to walk more and more and more like the lord always growing always getting closer always getting uh uh bright in that brighter light that the Lord would shine upon us look now he says Lord let me never come to a standstill the importance again the importance of Lord let me grow in you this year amen Lord let me grow in you this year let me come closer to you this year whatever it is whatever it takes he says continually Lord let me stop not stop at one thing let me just move on Lord till I've completed everything that you Ed ordained me to complete praise the Lord I believe that should be all of our desires if there's if the Lord gives us breath in our bodies that the Lord has something for us to do if the Lord still got us uh viable and living and breathing and then then God God's not done with us God has something he wants us to do he says help me to complete everything that you ordained for me to do oh praise the Lord I say the same thing Lord help me regardless of the price regardless of the cost regardless of the criticism how hard the cross is I remember the cross that you bore Lord no matter how hard it is Lord help me to be able to fulfill everything that you wanted me to do wasn't easy wasn't easy for Paul here for Saul amen the first thing that happened to him look again we know first thing that happened to him Jesus told him arise it'll be told you what to do and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man they heard something but they didn't know what it was it was indistinguishable and Saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were open he saw no man God blinded him but they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus now God's getting ready to do something to him amen and what is he doing he's sending somebody over to Saul to be able to speak to him to bring his his his vision to a place that's changed this had to be a drastic change things man remember Moses Moses left the hallowed Halls of Egypt to go out to become a shepherd and God is now going to call Moses back to Egypt to finish what he started could you imagine that uh is not is not hard to understand but sometimes that happens sometimes God will send you back to where you started to finish what you started amen and God had Moses started and God and and Moses spent 40 years back there and now God's sending him back to do it now God is having ananas to go speak to Saul so he can finish what God started in him amen he was there three days look now Mo uh uh Saul was there three days without water without uh drink or water without sight and neither did he eat nor drink and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named ananas said to him uh and to him said uh said the Lord in a vision ananas and he said behold I am here Lord the Lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus for behold he prayeth amen notice God made sure to let ananas know that Saul was in their preying amen because look and and has seen a vision and see God's trying to help ananas preface this visit with helping him understand because ananas knows what kind of man saw has been and I seen in a vision a man named ananas coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight then ananiah an ananas answered Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy Saints at Jerusalem now ananas saw what Saul was doing is evil but I I'm sure Saul like a lot of people believe what they were doing was in accordance to the will of the Lord right God's will ananas looked at it God obviously looked at it said I've seen what evil he has done to thy Saints at Jerusalem and I yeah and I'm sending you down there to go talk to him he probably didn't want to be within a 100 yards of salul uh and here Heath Authority from the chief priest to bind all that call on thy name but the Lord said unto him oh I like this part now the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel praise the Lord aren't you glad to be a chosen vessel of the Lord amen he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name name sake God is going to show him and and try to ease anan's mind that he could go down and speak to Saul that he could pray for Saul that Saul would get his vision back what happened when Saul got his vision back God changed his name God changed his name to Paul which meant that the guy that was there before is no longer alive that man died Saul is dead and Paul took his place and Paul's a new man revised in the Lord with a revelation of Jesus Christ and the truth of the word for his day so he knew that God was doing a work and God also said even through this I will show him what he must suffer for my name's sake now I got one more scripture Philippians chapter 3 amen chapter uh uh Philippians chapter 3 look now the seventh seal as we finish this up here the seventh seal brother bam says and I'm sure that you've noticed the things that's been happening this week of course quite a event there with the seals opening I'm sure you noticed that little Collins boy laying there dying the other night that little uh leukemia girl God is still a supernatural being amen heals leukemia heals the little boy dying amen how much more could he heal a need or heal any situation that you're going through the kingdom of God is coming and it's becoming more from the negative to the positive as it has been well look Saint if he said this 1963 March 1963 that it's becoming more the kingdom of God coming more from the negative to the positive all the time what should that do to us what should that cause in our lives what should it speak to us about if the kingdom of God is coming more negative to positive all the time how should that affect us how should we want more and more to become more of the from the negative to the positive all the time and what does that mean that means that this life is a shadow of his it's a NE negative of his his is the positive we're moving from that negative from that uh uh uh from that shadow into that light into that positive where Heaven and Earth embrace one another where we as a people of God are changed and raptured into a new whole dimension praise the Lord praise God you know brother random said if you want more of God there's more of God for you so if there's a thirst there to desire for more of God that just proves that there's more of God for you it's becoming more from the negative to the positive as it has been and he said now now that ought not choke people from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost here it is see we're drawing just closer just drawing closer to God all the time just drawing closer to God all the time we can make it a resolution we can make it whatever we want sin but the fact is that our desires our heart's desires and as we come into a new year would should be to want to be more like God to be closer to God of course if you come closer to God you're going to be more like God Amen can't help to do that you get to the place to just in a in the natural uh when you get a married couple couple together they start spending more and more time together the more time they get together the more they become to be like each other uh I've heard and thankful for my wife uh it hasn't happened but people say that couples even start to come to look like each other amen physically again I'm sure she's happy that hasn't happened in our marriage but uh a lot of people that's what that they start not just acting like each other or coming together like same but start looking like each other well if that's just something that people observe medically or scientifically or whatever in the natural world what would it be for God and his children spiritually to become more like him to look more like him to become more In His Image my my look Philippians now chapter 3 we'll close with this Philippians 3 verse 7 but what things look Paul's now saying all the that the L Lord had put him through all that he had done and all that things that had happened in his life but what things were gained to me those I counted for I counted loss for Christ amen might have been something that happened good to him or good for him but those things he counted lost for Jesus Christ amen mine yet doubt yay doubtless and I count all all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ praise the Lord in Christ alone will I glory amen yes though I could pride myself in battles won amen and be found ninth verse and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him amen that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings be made conformable unto his death now here's the here's the scary part here's the here's that part that brother bam warned against becoming stagnant or or or at a standstill as he called it that thing that people think they've reached to this certain place they've reached to this certain level they've gotten this certain Revelation or whatever it is and and and they just stay there and they become complacent in that instead of continually moving forward in Christ look now if by any means I might attain unto the res resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but at but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen what a great resolution you want a resolution at all something that you're going to stick to stay with that's going to become a part of your life let that be it amen it's hard to do and of course all the negative and all the worse and all the hard all those things that are bad Satan's going to to continually try to bring them up before you and throw them in your face every mistake you made everything you may have thought bad whatever it might have been the devil's going to always try to Drudge that stuff up but Paul said with the great wisdom of God forgetting those things which are behind I pressed toward a few hours we're starting a new year now pressing forward forward Not Looking Back remember what the Bible says about looking back dog to its wallow uh a dog to its vomit pressing forward amen pressing forward to the calling the High Calling of Christ Jesus that should be every one of our calls today amen for a high calling for a higher walk for a closer walk with the Lord to become closer to the Lord Jesus as this year continues to to as wind down as the New Year ushers in to become more like him should be all of our desires to be closer to him whatever it takes the Lord has brought us along Long Way Saints yes and we're thankful for that but we still need to continue pressing on pressing on pressing on that's what the Lord give us to continue to press this battle amen and to walk forward in the glory of the Lord amen let's stand if we could whether you want to call it a New Year's resolution whatever you want to say about it call it it's inconsequential the result results is what matters the results is what matters what do we want what do we want to get from the Lord what do we want to do for the Lord how close do we really want to get to the Lord you know you know brother brand preached that message door in the door and you know there's those times those people that maybe even some of us that want to keep a dooro a door too closed in Your Heart Lord you can come in help yourself but don't go through that door I got stuff in there I don't want you to know about well don't worry God already knows about it but yes but that that's the that's the uh the apprehension that people have sometimes by allowing the Lord and the fullness of the Lord in their lives continuing to move their lives and to shape their lives and to uh be in their lives or be their lives amen give it all Lord I surrender all praise the Lord amen let's let's sing his course do I don't know if we have it on there pressing pressing on probably not in there unless Michael put it in there most of us probably know it anyway I think this must have
