bless you today amen again welcome to the house of the Lord have a couple prayer request to bring to your attention uh one we had that sister Norma sent me from Sister Judy Arnold for those of you know Sister Judy uh she listens fairly regularly I think uh to the streaming she lives in Indiana so she doesn't attend of course in person but um um she does uh listen to our services and enjoy being a part of the congregation and uh anyway she sent sister Norma request it says could you please have the church pray for me going to have surgery February 4th and February 18th I have cataracts in both eyes in June of 2024 I was told I was in stage one but my eyes are worse now uh my right eye is covered over with the Cataract but you can barely see the blood vessel vessels underneath my left eye is the worst and they will operate on it February 18th uh the left eye is covered and kind of deep I've never had cataracts I'm not sure what that means but uh anyway I can't read my Bible without a magnifying glass I'm a little nervous about the surgeries and would really appreciate everyone's prayers thank you so very much Lord bless you Sister Judy amen so remember Sister Judy Arnold in prayer uh also got a text right as church was starting uh from Shariah said that Gabriel woke up uh feeling sick today uh art is working so please remember them in prayer amen if we would praise the Lord so let's just remember those requests um those who know my plans got changed I am not going to Salt Lake again uh they split our team up and they're sending me to Florida so I didn't change the service time though because the flight's earlier but it's it's late enough that I didn't have to change the time so we're still okay with that but uh I am leaving at 2:40 today going to Florida so I appreciate your prayers for that especially uh with uh all the things is happening in aviation today uh but uh I don't worry about that the Lord protects me uh and if a helicopter comes in the path of my plane I was meant to go my hand my life's in his hands so uh but I do app appreciate prayers and we know how the devil can try to intervene so I do appreciate your prayers and all of that the Lord would just have his way in that situation Joel how is your Tommy Budd um it's doing great it's doing good good you had an infection around his belly button so he's been struggling with that for a week or two so please remember is it still giving you pain pain so please remember Joel in prayer is this a a a testimony or a prayer request sister it's testimony okay we'll hold it till after amen so praise the Lord that's all the requests I have of course we come to continue remember Pats sister Lydia sister Norma's not with us she's having her granddaughter come and visit with them having a very late uh Christmas I think uh but please remember her in prayer uh sister um I got a text from um from Sister Julie the other night and I text back that she wanted to talk but I never heard back from her uh so we don't see her here today today is when she wanted to give her testimony so please remember her in prayer if you would as well amen like I said sister Le just remember all the all the part of the body of Christ amen try to remember everyone's not hearing prayer so unspoken request on your there's all of our needs of course let's stand to our feet if we could hope that doesn't become a ritual to us I do that every service but I really mean it I hope you needan it in your heart when you lift your hand you really got something that you desire the Lord's moving on in your on your behalf amen request you have maybe for a friend relative a pet whatever it may be amen so brother Dennis would you take Lord Jesus we were worshiping uh your name which we should at all times not only in service time but father the songs were to remind us the importance of letting you have preeminence control in our lives we must reflect you Lord as I was talking earlier with my brother and Lord he was saying about certain ones that he knows that they sure don't display um their lives as a chrisan Christians as they say they are and I told them Jesus taught us by their fruits you shall know them yes Lord and father when we see certain ones that are not living the life let us have the love and burden to pray for them to believe that they'll come in they'll repent and they'll make their lives right with you it's like brother green used to say God does not forgive uh uh excuse sin he forgives confess sin yes Lord and Lord it's not time to bring our excuses why we we refuse we um neglect to line up with your word father deal with our hearts yes Lord Jesus there's such blindness in this world today that there's people that think there are Christians when their lives displays the cont their lies displ that they are are living a life of a religious spirit which is of the devil yes and father as the prophet taught us so clearly there's only two spirits in the world today there is God's spirit in his people and there's a religious spirit that's working amongst the so-called um uh denomination and and socalled people that want to identify themselves as you father and Lord deal with our hearts Lord we come and we just had communion service where it says examine our hearts we need to do it daily father if there's something in us that refuses to line up to your word that spirit is not of God yes Lord Lord Jes you wrote your word your word is life as we read it yes and Lord You're the author of that word and if we refuse to line up with your word as we read it that Spirit that's in US is not of you father is fighting fighting your word in his goodness to come to the place where you'll look look at us in the day of judgment for I did this great thing oh I led so many souls to the kingdom of God I prayed for so many people and they were healed you'll look at them and you'll say depart from me you worker of iniquity I never knew you my mind Lord Jesus Lord that speaks to my heart stronger and Lord Lord may it it resonate in the hearts of all of us Grant it God yes our people that are needy this morning Father Lord the needs of our precious sister Judy Arnold

of scripture we'll read a couple of verses and let you be seated amen praise the Lord Ephesians chapter one we'll try to pick up where we left off last week kind of didn't finish the thought I was on there but um I believe the Lord did the work and what was needed to be said said just trust the lord to bless the word today amen Ephesians chapter one man we're going to continue on with adoption uh

comes as a revelation encouragement to our hearts and strengthen us along the way we commit ourselves to you ask these blessings Lord in your precious Holy Name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Ephesians chapter 1 we're just going to read two verses of scripture and then we'll let you be seated amen Ephesians 13 and 14 Ephesians 13:14 in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you that you believe you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory you can be seated if you'd like amen I want to pick up where we left off last week amen I want to go back to uh the first uh the first of Ephesians we'll just start um well we've got some time we'll just we'll just start with the first verse Ephesians 1:1 uh I like all of it anyway so it's hard sometimes to find a place to start and stop at so best way to best way to avoid that is just read it all so praise the Lord Ephesians 1 one let's start here Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus so you can just put my name right there you can put your name if you believe that to be you you're the faithful in Christ Jesus just put your name right there so now the rest he's talking to you amen Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen predestined he's predestinated us to this adoption amen he's predestinated us unto this maturity he's predestinated us into this family amen praise the Lord to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein Heath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in Him Praise the Lord so we know it's to so we know that we've been adopted we were children of God adopted into this family to the good pleasure of his will amen amen and he has made sure that every fast and every part of our life is to be to glorify him everything that's done is to bring glory to the Lord Jesus in him all things in Him Praise the Lord 11th verse now in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worth all things after the counsel of his own will so when we learn about our inheritance we we recognize that inheritance is brought to us through predestination by which we were adopted amen remember up here we were predestinated unto this adoption so that predestination in Christ amen in his mind in him when he predestinated us he gave us an inheritance amen an inheritance who gets an inheritance all who the father says gets the inheritance who does the father give inheritance to his children his family praise the Lord amen to the counsel and to the counsel of his own will praise the Lord not my will not anybody else but God's will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom in whom again let's read this over again 13th verse in whom he also trusted after that he heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your Sal ation in whom also after that ye believe you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise we've been sealed the Holy Spirit praise the lord we just was went through the the new birth holy spirit being born again that Holy Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession the Redemption the full Redemption amen we read that last week we'll probably read it again here in a minute amen the the Redemption of our bodies the full Redemption is when God takes us home amen the until the until the Redemption so we received this Earnest of The Inheritance this down payment the earnest is the down payment we receed this Earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession so the gift of the Holy Ghost is just that it's a gift it's a gift given unto us until we receive that full adoption until we get to that place of full Redemption of the of the uh the possession of the purchased price that God bought with his own blood and that is US amen we are that purchased possession until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory we are that purchased possession we are that one that God is working on as we continue to live the life of Christ on this Earth God is living through us to be the manifestation of Jesus Christ on Earth today now this Earnest is just a down payment yes amen remember the holy spirit is just a gift it's a brother random called it a temporal gift why would he say that because the need for having the Holy Ghost is here for us present amen when you reach into a place of perfection your body's perfect your life everything about when you receive a body change and we go into glory to be with the Lord then everything is perfect what's the need of having the Holy Ghost then right amen it's a temporal gift it's for us now yes praise the Lord that that that which is that Earnest it is the down payment it is the town payment that shows that we have full beneficial rights to the purchase possession that God has given us every e e every Redemptive benefit that is of God we now possess because of the earnest the earnest is the down payment if you put earnest money on a house you sign a contract you put earnest money down that to says that you promise you're going to buy this house in good faith when you put that earnest money down uh and you sign a contract based on the earnest money you might not have made one single payment to a bank or to a mortgage company at all but you still get the keys to that place because you put earnest money and signed the contract that says I'm going to fulfill the promise that I made amen and who better to fulfill the promises that he made than God Almighty amen amen so we we we make that earnest money we make that down payment to say I promise that I'm going to pay and what they do is you write you put your name down you sign your name and they give you the keys and you walk in the door of the house amen the bank the mortgage company nor the previous owner cannot tell you which rooms you can go in and not go in they cannot tell you you can't walk into your backyard they cannot tell you you can't build a barbecue they cannot tell you you can't put up a swing for the kids they cannot dictate to you what color the walls are going to be because it's your house right it belongs to you every bit of that house is based on the fact that you put down an earnest money that just showed that there was more to come amen praise the Lord because the more to come is you possessing the home living in it and there's nobody can tell you what you can and can't do with it it belongs to you amen now there are laws that tell you you can't purposely burn it down to get insurance money or something there are laws against that but nobody can tell you what color you can paint the walls right they can't tell you what to do with the roof the floor they can't tell you whether you have carpet or hardwood floors they can't tell you that they can't tell you whether to cut the grass in the back they can't tell they can't tell you what to do with your house because it's your house it belongs to you why because you put down the earnest money and you promised that you're going to fulfill the word of the contract amen again God gave us contract and he's as good as his word amen we're still the earnest of the down payment amen but we recognize that just because we have a gift that gift and that Earnest is just telling us that there's more in store for usen amen but while we're here we are beneficiaries of every Redemptive promise that comes with the Holy Ghost praise the Lord that Earnest that seal we we have the benefit to every bit of it look what brother brandom said here he said uh in uh let me see makes it uh Revelation chapter five number one now notice as we go on now we notice it's finished praise the lord we we we know that we are we are predestinated with the lamb praise the lord we are predestinated with the lamb that word we just read tells us that the holy spirit is our seal the earnest means that is the down payment but the earnest means that there is more Is Yet To Come praise God so we we've been promised and we've been given with this Earnest to recognize there's more than just this life ahead for us there's more than just this world there's more than just this uh uh waking up and going to bed and the the living in this flesh and living in this life there's more to this amen and that's a lot of times what a lot of people lose vision on a lot of people of the world of course don't have that Vision but as a Christian we can't lose vision to recognize that there's more to it than just what we're doing here right amen we are working unto something we are working until until we get to that place where our bodies reach that body change whether we go by the way of the grave whether our body changes here when we're drawing breath whichever way amen that promise promises us that there's more to come there's more to this than just what we see right here more than our lives can see taste F smell here more than our imagination con reason uh affection memory more than anything that our bodies Our Spirits can contact or or uh uh be privy to on this Earth there's more to come which is that great eternity that we're looking for that great place that great state of perfection amen now I know Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as Our Father which is in heaven is perfect but that just follows along with uh as I've said many times of of adoption reaching that place of full age of full maturity in the Lord just like Jesus did amen people say well that adoption doesn't come until your rapture well then I guess Jesus was raptured at the end of Matthew 17 cuz he was adopted in Matthew 17 right and Jesus said this is my beloved Son hear ye him yes he is the one I am pleased to dwell in he is the one that you are to hear he is my son now he is standing in my stead you listen to him that's the adoption well he didn't go he didn't go up he didn't die right after that or go into heaven right after he lived his life after that what as an adopted son of God yes amen that's exactly the way we are to live our lives as God has adopted us or placed Us in that position and we've reached a state of maturity a mature Christian in the Lord when we do that then God uses us to live through us and our lives and then what it becomes it becomes not me but it becomes him it's him living now not me amen when my children were born they did what we told them they lived their lives based on what how me and my wife raised them and what we told them to do if we told them to go to church they went to church now by the grace of God I'm so thankful I've never had any problem with our children going to church uh uh it it I've said this before on Sunday morning it never was uh uh you know should we go to church today or we going to church today no we all showed up in the living room dressed and ready to go cuz it was part of life I'm thankful by the gra of God we never had that problem but they did what we told them to do uh even if they didn't want to even if they didn't like it even if it was corrective or or a spanking or whatever that they might not have wanted to but they did what we told them to do but when they grew up and became mature and grown up then that was their lives to live amen they lived their lives based on uh uh uh what they know that they had learned that we had taught them and by the grace of God what God has shown them and now they have to go not by our God not by our Salvation not by our Holy Ghost but by their own salvation but by their own Holy Ghost by by their own God living in them now they walked their lives based on that not what we tell them that's right praise the Lord why because they' come to the they came to the place of maturity they came to the place of being grown-ups amen of living their lives based in condition amen God shows us that that's uh that through us he he wants his life to be manifested through us he wants his life to be lived still here on Earth that's why he gave his life that's why he died at Calvary amen that's why he came back again yeah so he would live through US amen so that we would be his representativ so that we so that Jes that so that people would see Jesus in US uses amen the earnest means brother R said get back to the quote now the earnest means there's more Yet to Come yes praise the Lord Jesus more yet to come we only have the earnest of it now but remember that Earnest gives you every a right to every Redemptive property of the holy spirit of God everything that God is amen you are even though it may have been a scoop out of the ocean everything the ocean's made of is in that scoop that's in you praise God you're you have a right to every bit of it amen we add the earnest the earnest is just a down payment praise the Lord what's it a down payment for it's a down payment for for Romans 8:23 that is to say the Redemption of our bodies that is to say that we belong to him that is to say that at that appropriate time that God has appointed which we just read in his appointed time amen he'll call us home to be with him praise the Lord amen maybe individually but at one time we're finally at one point all going to go in a rapure Amen to be with him the wedding supper of the Lamb the earnest is just the down payment oh how beautiful just the down payment that holds it and secures it and Anor aners it so no one else can touch it praise the Lord amen stranger can't The Stranger can't come back into your house and say you know paint this wall blue a stranger can't come and say Hey you need a lawn on her and that I think a good know Garden home or something would look good it's not of your business it's my house right it's my yard it's my wall that's my kitchen doesn't it's that's my bedroom doesn't belong to you an outside the the former owner can't come and say you know what I uh you know uh don't you dare paint that wall uh uh uh you don't you dare tell down that building in the back you know don't they have no business to it you understand what I'm saying yes your former owner the devil that's right has nothing to say about you that's right amen he can't say that you should do this you go here you do he has nothing to do with me he has no rights and no claims to me at all praise God because I've been purchased I've been bought by the blood of Jesus Christ I've been redeemed by that blood and according to his purpose is how I decide to live amen now I go in the house and I say I think that wall should be blue God says no paint it green now you know what color it's going to be green amen because I do what he tells me to do am not what I desire to do I think it might look better a different way but you know what he knows down the road he knows what it's going to be better down the road I know it's a very crude example of a green wall blue roll but down the road God knows exactly what it's going to be what we need for for continual Servants of the Lord amen and and the well-being of us in our lives see no one else see it secures it the Holy Spirit seals secures amen Earnest down payment just it holds it praise the Lord holds it secures it and anchors it so no one else can touch it amen the former owner has no rights on you whatsoever according to Invisible Union that Union has been divorced and thrown into God's SE forgetfulness it never existed why did God do that because of the Fall In the Garden of Eden fall in the Garden of Eden through every man that was born after that into sin shaped iniquity as we read the scripture come in the world speaking lives amen so God made a way that though we were born in that condition as property of his if if you will at that time that div that Union has been dissolved divorced put away brother M I know you might not like the word divorce but that's the word brother Bram used an invisible Union and put in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered anymore which means the devil has no more claim on you he has no rights to you amen he can Satan cannot make you sick amen not without God's permission right God might allow it but Satan cannot touch you without God's permission yes without God's okay for some reason if God's allowed it there's there's a reason if you're a child of God there's a reason amen God allows it oh I just like that he angers it so nobody else can touch it is the earnest of our adoption amen the holy spirit is now the earnest in our hearts of the adoption praise the Lord that Earnest just shows us that there's more still coming amen it just proves to us that there's more still coming God still has more for us more in store for us amen I like this I like the Lord I love the Lord I love I love my life I enjoy my life but I'm so thankful that there's more more to life than just this life amen amen everybody says Live It Up all the world says live it up you only got one life amen this is just a shadow of what it's going to be I I I almost try to consider myself here um as nothing uh just just an example of Christ on Earth because my our real life is beyond this life beyond this world our real life is not here that's right amen this this is just we're just show sojourners here pilgrims in This Strange Land This Isn't Our real life yes we're just doing everything we can here to live for Jesus Christ and and be his uh his life while we're here on Earth but our our real life people say you only got one life I'm sorry this ain't it amen my real life is beyond this place yes my real life is after this life is over praise the Lord that that a lot of people want to just hang everything on this life well you you go right ahead amen you can live it up whatever you want to the Hill People say um I I just I I just the the you know when brother random said the Hollywood destroyed this nation I don't think we understood to the magnitude that it really has yeah to the magnitude that it's done to people that that just don't grasp what it is to live in this life yes of course as a Christian as a a holy ghost filed believer we understand we know what God does doing for us we know what it means to be here in this life but people just they just don't understand uh you know I I've heard recently probably seems like more so than other times uh a woman becoming a mother and having children but then but then she says well she wants a life there is no no greater life than to be there for your children right there is no greater life that is your life you see but but I want I want I want more I wantan to I I want more in life you know uh that is that's the best thing that you can do in this life is be a good Godly mother to your children and raise them in the nurture and admonition of God that's the best you can do there's no greater thing on this planet in my opinion amen maybe I should save that for mother's day but anyway that's the truth praise the Lord people they I I I want more well just live for God the More's coming that's true amen just give your life to the Lord Jesus the world come amen amen this is just the earnest praise the Lord let's go over to let's read again in Romans chapter 8 amen recognized as we got this this Romans 8 I'm going to start with verse 14 this time but we recognize that uh uh we talked about the justification sanctification justification under uh Luther sanctification under Wesley uh the Holy Ghost brought in the ushering in the the restoration of the gifts for the prophet uh brother William brandham know the Holy Ghost is here uh the earnest in bringing a placement remember that we talked about the the the children of Israel coming out of Egypt going to cross uh the sea uh into the promised land and God gave them that land but then as God gave it to them he placed them in that land where they were supposed to be they come to the place that they had reached the culmination of the promise that God had give them but then it was time to occupy it was time to live it was time to be who God had ordained them to be praise the Lord now uh Romans chapter 8 uh let's begin with verse 14 Romans 8:14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God so what that tells me is you're not uh you're not a son of God you're not going to be led by the spirit of God right whether before or after you're born again you're not a son of God you're not a daughter of God if you're not led by the spirit of God how many things in our lives that even before we gave our heart to the Lord you might can look back and say that was the Lord in my life right that was God's leading amen I gave you a little personal story I guess last week of me personally but you might can look back and say this was the Lord leading me and and and look back and and recognize now that was God in your life even before you gave your heart to him even before you were born again even before you feel with the spirit of God it was the spirit of God that was leading you those that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God look the leading doesn't just happen after you're born again the leading of God is your whole life because if you were a part of God then you've always been a part of God Amen if God looks over you now he's always looked over you I didn't look over my children just when they got old enough to talk just when they got old enough to drive or just after they left the house I looked over them when they uh uh when they were born I even spoke to them before they were born amen and that's in human realm but what about God when God looks in them in the spirit realm and you're you were his from before the foundation of the world not just when you say that you I received the Lord You're always is he's always looked over you led by the spirit of God they're the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear the spirit of look what it says the spirit of bondage again amen what does that tell you tells you you were in bondage to start with right remember born in sin shaped iniquity from the world speaking lies in bondage you were in bondage but we haven't received the spirit Fe little s AB bondage again to fear praise the Lord like brother Dennis said in his prayer we don't we we don't fear is not a part of our vocabulary fear is not a part of our life why because we are Christians we have God in our Liv amen fear is not a part of it love Yeah amen we don't fear but we have a Love A sound mind uh so we're not to be bondage not to be bound again to fear but you have received the spirit big S capital S of adoption whereby we cry Abby father you come to the realization you've grown up to the place father father amen that's a term that's a term of endearment amen not just to say father but father fathers my Lord my God my father father father amen it's a term of endearment that claims and and reaches out by acknowledgment that he's your father that God is your father amen the spirit itself and that's through adoption amen you reach that place of adoption praise the Lord the spirit of adoption the spirit itself the SC capital is sp uh itself Bears witness with our spirit our human spirit that we are are the children of God that Spirit God's spirit Holy Spirit witness to us human spirit that we are the children of God Amen we know we're the children of God there's nobody can talk you out of the realization that you are a child of God Amen nobody and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation there we go again with that word amen the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God we talked about that a little bit last week the the of the creature the expectation of the creature creation amen of creation waited for the manifestation of the sons of God why would all of creation be longing for and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God because even creation that fell in the Garden of Eden at the uh when When sin and in realize human life body life that worships God Amen so they boty life worships God absolutely amen remember the scripture when the rain falls on the just and the unjust when it falls on the just what does it do it lifts its hands and worships God when the wheat's been over it's it's it's uh maybe uh not coming to maturity but maybe been in a drought when the rain comes it raises its head up amen God created all of creation to worship Him amen the moon stars galaxies that all of it is in place to worship God the whole point of every every bit of it is to worship God to give glory to the Lord Jesus to give glory to God Amen that creature waited because it knows when that manifestation of the sons of God come to the place of maturity of manifestation amen that is unveiling that is pulling the cover off manifest when that sons of when those sons of God are manifested that's when she goes home that's the beginning of the time that all of all of creation is all wrongs are made right amen amen we talked about the thorns on the cactus all those wrongs will be made right amen all the animals all the boty life all the human life everything that is wrong today because of sin will be made right because of the absence of sin and the presence of God's glory that's why it's waiting for the manifestation of of the sons of God that's that shows the beginning that's the time that uh all creation recognize that that's when we're all going back to that place where we were supposed to be from the beginning amen for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly amen not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption even the creation shall be delivered from the bonds of corruption that's why it's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God because it will be released of its bondage praise the Lord and and delivered if you will unto the Glorious Liberty of the sons of of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and it is still today now still groaning in pain and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit we ourselves have the first fruit of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves praise the Lord that Psalm I can started off with amen I feel the pole I feel the groan I feel the inside urgence of God moving me Amen to be more like him moving me to become closer to him it's that spirit that that's in US within us groaning within us waiting for the adoption to with that is to say the Redemption of our bodies all the creation is waiting for that because when this because when we reach that place Saints and we all go into Rapture amen that's again that's the beginning God that the the spirit moves down and all of creation all of it's burnt over amen God makes every bit of it right Burns even the atmospheres the atmospheres will explode so that every bit of any kind of molecule of sin will be done away with praise the Lord let me read you this the breach between the uh seven Church agency and the seals breach message now notice now this book sealed sealed uh this book is sealed until the day of redemption again Romans 82223 we just read let's get that we'll give this background you think we'll understand he says goes on um while the I was young now 8 Romans 8 for we know that the whole creation he's reading that scripture again as we just read the whole creation grown and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it that is to say the Redemption of our bodies the changing of our bodies the consummation of the adoption this is not the adoption it's the consummation of the adoption amen when God takes his mature bride God's not coming for a little girl Saints amen God's coming for a mature woman he's coming for a bride he didn't marry a little girl amen he didn't marry a little toddler he married a mature woman a mature bride amen amen that's his wife that's who he's coming for is a mature woman praise the Lord that's the consummation of the adoption yes changing of our bodies oh my he says oh my twice don't that make us old folks feel good amen that covers almost our whole congregation even today except for the little pocket right here of the little one amen as we get older amen that does it make us old folks feel good but look now I've got something for you young ones too he says but it ought to make us all feel good amen amen praise the Lord even down the little Ruthie there should make us us all feel good waiting for this hour we understand this will take place at the first resurrection nature groaning we are groaning everything is groaning because we realize that something is not right but we realize because of the earnest that there's more ahead we realize that God's got more in store for us than just what this life has to offer amen and we're looking to that time we're looking for God to take us home amen praise the Lord let's go over to the scripture uh first John I'm gonna read a couple of scriptures here and try to background if you will for the next few minutes uh before I close the next part uh grow in Grace amen adoption part three grow in Grace amen is what we want to talk about but first John chapter 3 let's start here first John chapter 3 we'll just read the first two verses of First John amen did I mention that correctly first John I tell everybody okay sometimes I get in my uh I I I get where I feel like I'm trying to rush things and I say things in a wrong way and I guess St John in first John sometimes is he get uh confused first John uh chapter 3 verse one behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God Amen that is the epitome of it all the love of God the love of the Father the love of God has bestowed upon us that we could be called the sons of God we could be called children of God Amen that's by his love praise the Lord therefore the world World knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now praise the Lord now are we the sons of God the children of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is praise the Lorden but we know that where God is moving and living in our lives where he's moving us from obviously but where he's taking us to amen what it takes to get to the place where God is moving us to amen brought us from yes but where we're going no where we're at now yeah but where where are we going to amen brings us to that place where we reach full adoption we reach maturity we reach reach that place of perfection that Jesus was talking about we reach that place it's not uh it's not far off in the stratosphere somewhere it's just a part of our lives right it's like so many times I've said before we just live our lives live a good humble simple Christian Life yes as you walk in the Lord amen and as you're LED of God and as you follow in his footsteps as he leads you God will will bring everything that is necessary in your life to bring you to the place that you need to be in him amen amen regardless of whether it's some what people would consider some great big position or just a humble janitor or someone that just is part of the church right supports the church and is there does their part for it it it it doesn't matter amen the janitor is just as important as the pastor right amen he's just well let's just say he's just as much a part of the church amen in the sunship of Christ the janitor the pastor doesn't mean any more than the janitor does right and to be honest as the one who basically is janitor and pastor uh I'm fine that that's that's the way it should be amen killing our humil our pride to bring in humility to recognize I'm not any more important than any of us no matter to I guess as it said from the least to the greatest doesn't matter we're all a part of that body amen and the pastor May Proclaim anyway to be way up here and everybody else is way down there not true that's right amen that is not just a fallacy unfortunately uh it seems sometimes that ministers kind of promote that but that's not true that's right never has been will not be in the sunship of Jesus Christ there's none any more important than the other we're all a part of the same body I'm more revelated okay well that's nice good how close do you live to Jesus Christ how close is your relationship with him amen amen I can quote the scripture yeah but how much are you living the life of God how much do people see Jesus in that's what matters amen it's about relationship yes amen it's about relationship and God wants us to be like him that's why as we're born amen and are unto this adoption we grow we grow in the Lord we have to grow according to just as we did physically in our Humanity we have to grow spiritually yes and we all do grow amen and somebody and the pastor may think that he's this great revelated person and he's mature and adopted and manifesting this that and the other but until the least get to that place none of us are going anywhere amen amen cuz we're all a body amen we're all of the same part of the same body when I walk out that door I don't leave my toes sitting here I don't leave my finger sitting here it all goes with me because it's one body when we all go we all go together CU it's one body I don't care if you're the bottom skin or the smallest toe it's going with the body right and it all has to go together I don't care if the eyeball the the brain the brain's ready to go what about doesn't matter amen the whole body goes at the same time where the body goes that's where the whole body goes amen praise the Lord now second Peter let me read this we'll close here in just a minute because I won't be able to get into this but I can read this scripture second Peter uh chapter 3 second Peter 3 verse1 17 2 Peter 3:17 ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness wow you mean someone that had steadfastness can fall sure looks like that scripture yes and this is a warning to keep people who are in their steadfastness from falling from their steadfastness to grow in Grace says but grow in Grace so but grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory both now and forever am a amen grow in Grace we talk a lot about the grace of God how important the grace of God in our is in our lives but we also recognize that with God's grace comes a knowledge of God Amen so when it says to grow in Grace and in the knowledge it doesn't mean a worldly knowledge it doesn't mean a head knowledge it means a revelation knowledge if you will uh now a a as you would see definitions written in the scripture it's going to give you a definition of worldly human brain knowledge but we know by truth in Revelation of the word for for our day that it doesn't mean that because head knowledge just gets you further and further away from God but revelation of God and and God revealing himself to you and the more you read the more you study the more you listen the more you find the God will reveal himself to you through his word through the spirit that Grace and knowledge has to go together just like the Dynamics and mechanics amen just like the spirit and the truth it all has to go together the blood the flesh the prayer the word the Dynamics mechanics the grace truth knowledge goes together amen so we grow in the grace and we know all about the grace but that's this is how we grow Amen in Grace you can't grow if there's no Grace because your sins will condemn you but if there's Grace if there's Grace there to cover if there's Grace there to annihilate if there's Grace there to alleviate to annihilate all sin that's Grace then you can grow amen amen that's what happens a lot of times in people's lives children's lives this poor little girl I don't know how old she was I'm I'm not sure if they've told yet it was on this doomed flight that came out of Philadelphia um headed back to Mexico this poor little girl she I guess she had some life-threatening situation in her life uh and she was at the Shriner Hospital in Philadelphia to get treatment to try to help her uh apparently uh no matter what life saving efforts the Shriners in anybody else tried it was her time to go home right now I don't know if she was at the age of accountability or any of that I haven't heard an age I don't know how old she was but apparently she sounded fairly small under the age of 16 at least but um it it was it was her time but see a lot of times uh you you you've got like St Jude's hospital and you've got Shriners and you've got these that uh deal with uh cancer and children and Leukemia and stuff like that when there's when there's something that comes in uh a a person uh a body whether a child or not but some it seems to grip us more when it's a child uh comes into that body that that's not right uh brother brandham called cancer a perverted blood cell or uh uh perverted or U backslid I think is what he said blood cell uh that Rebels against the body instead of helping the body uh there there comes an impediment amen and and it it keeps a person from growing the way they're supposed to grow uh normally growth comes in human growth as you're born and everything operates in your body is supposed to and you grow and you get older and you become bigger and uh you become adult amen but when a child especially gets an impediment or something comes in their lives like a backsliding blood cell or something leukemia it it throws it throws that body into a a stunted State amen because uh it keeps them from growing the way they're supposed to and that's what I think the first warning the 17th verse is really telling and the 18 first that we we not allow impediments we not allow black uh backslid blood cells Renegade blood cells whatever it is no impediments to cause any uh uh disruption to our growth as we grow in the Lord we grow in Grace amen the grace of God the grace of God brings life to us because we realize that the grace is what annihilates the sin in our life uh the grace is what puts us in a position before God that really as a human as a mortal we don't even belong because his blood was shed at Calvary it puts us and elevates us into that position amen it's not something I did it's what he did amen we keep from any impediments coming and keeping us from getting to that place amen anything from stunting our growth that's where the knowledge comes in you go you grow in the grace and in the knowledge as you get older you get smarter as you get older you gain more knowledge and things happen and uh I I've probably had this by a lot of people and I don't know why I'm like this I can't explain it I just am but I I I I know so much obscure stuff that you hear in life and that you get from the news or whatever that uh people say something say well yeah yeah this this and they're like how do you know that I don't know [Music] I don't know how how do you know you just know I I heard it somewhere it was shown to me at some time or I read it somewhere or something I I don't know I just know but as you get older you you you retain knowledge knowledge becomes part of your life and you live your life based on knowledge when you start driving a car one of the first things you realize in a car is how The Brak and the gas oper you know when to put on the gas you know when to put on the break and once you realize you get out on the street you recognize one of the first things you need to learn how to do is to stop at a stop light because we know as you get older if you don't stop at a stop light bad things are usually going to happen amen amen that's just part of life I I hope we understand this I just give some physical uh analogy of a spiritual Revelation to understand it's the same thing in our lives amen we grow by the knowledge of God we grow by the knowledge of Jesus Christ we grow because the word speaks to us and shows us how we are to live what we are to do what's pleasing to the Lord what is what he doesn't like and we grow in Grace based on the knowledge amen that we retain of God Amen again it's the same as the mechanics and the Dynamics amen you can't have one without the other we talked about last week uh these three are one the father son the Holy Ghost these three are one not agree of one they are one can't have one one without the other it's the same thing you can have mechanics without Dynamics but what good does it do you brother R talked about car amen you can have the Dynamics and not the mechanics but again what good does that do you right you got to have both you got to have spirit and truth right you got to have the Holy Ghost and the word the Holy Ghost helps you the grace of God but the word helps bring knowledge Revelation into your life a way that you can grow by Praise the Lord the grace helps you realize this is who I am this is what God's done for me this this is where I belong you have to you must have both aspects of those to be able to grow to be able to grow in the word to be able to grow in the Lord God God has given us those ways those abilities to be able to grow in him amen praise the Lord let's stand I'm going to stop right there I mentioned uh I mentioned that flight um I haven't spoke to him but I noticed on a map when I started looking at it see that and that's sometimes I guess why I get information I I was listening to that and immediately immediately what I do I I went picked up my phone and I looked on a map to try to find out where it was where was position what does it mean to me I don't live in Philadelphia I don't really know anybody that lives in Philadelphia why would I care I don't know I just did it anyway but as I was looking I did find out something interesting it was the place where this plane crash took place is right across probably two miles as the crow flies from Brother John McFadden's Church wow right across the river uh the the plane crash was up here the Betsy Ross Bridge just down below it you go across that bridge and brother John's Church is right there right on the river basically it's off the river a little bit but it's right there amen and I looked and I didn't call him he lives way way down in Delaware he doesn't live anywhere near there but I didn't know if maybe some of the people went his church or something they there but I I I didn't contact having contact I haven't heard from Brother John in years but it it just struck me as uh something that I could identify with because I've been there uh you know what I'm saying but anyway um so please pray for those people yes and that situation but we know that as God has given us his Spirit he didn't just give it to us for us just to hold on to and keep but we are to learn and to grow and for God to continue to use us don't matter how old you get don't matter how young you are you grow in the grace and the knowledge of the Lord Jesus continually our whole lives is is is growing is maturing is getting to that place of adulthood amen adulthood in him and I've noticed uh I've noticed it seems like that it happens more rapidly nowadays uh than it did even 30 years ago when I started ministering 30 plus years ago and uh give my heart to the Lord and was really more involved in living my life for the Lord uh it seemed like it was it it it seems like it's been as as we've gone from horse and buggy to cars to airplanes to rockets that it's kind of done the same thing it seems like in the spirit uh where it used to seem like it was more a horse and buggy now it's just it's like a rocket I've seen young people have just coming to the Lord and they and the Lord's just filled them with so many so much understanding of the word it's uh it's it's just the Lord so I believe and I believe that's purposeful I believe that's purposeful to the point that when the last person comes in when when that point is when that last person comes uh that it we won't be here another 40 years waiting for them to mature yeah amen it'll it'll just be right there I don't think it'll be too long but that's up to the Lord that's just my feeling about it but anyway that's just the Lord uh unveiling himself praise the Lord amen I want to sing that song that Micah started out singing um we didn't have it on here did we um I feel the P do we have it it's not on if we don't have it uh I know there's probably some in here that might not know that chorus that song um if he can't find it on there oh good it is all right so there's course we can sing it together amen Worship the Lord if you happen not to know this for the words of it I just felt like singing this again because it means so much to the acknowledgement of really I think what more or less in my ramblings was trying to get across amen today the groaning feeling of the pulling of God in our lives amen you feel that full today amen feel the Lord ply praise the Lord I feel the P I hear the call I hear the call I hear and I know his Spirit f moving me to give my all he speaks to me speaks to me and I agree I aree Lord please come and take control I feel feel the

a child of God praise the Lord Jesus amen praise the Lord amen thank you Lord Jesus pray something was said to bless and strength in the Lord today amen just trust the Lord bless us through the week if it's his will amen if not we'll reconvene on the other side yes praise the Lord amen whatever his perfect will is that's what we desire in our lives so God richly bless you love you appreciate you please remember your prayer request remember uh as I mentioned earlier let's remember continue to remember the um the people affected by the the airline crashes this we and a lot of people were
