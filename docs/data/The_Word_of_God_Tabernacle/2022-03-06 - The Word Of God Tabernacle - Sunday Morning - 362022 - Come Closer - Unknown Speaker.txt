about people questioning whether or not a literal act of turning a staff into a snake happened and moses steak snake eating pharaoh's magician's snakes is that literal did that really happen i said if you marginalize and you do away with a miracle-working god in that instance then you might as well throw the whole bible away right because the whole bible is full of miracles the whole bible is is filled with the wonder of god doing signs and wonders and miracles i mean the whole the whole bible's full of it praise the lord not only is the bible full of it but we're full of it amen how many times did we hear god protecting sister sheila and and the visteros last night this ruckus that happened and most of you probably know at their place last night amen could have been bullets flying

anybody else amen oh yeah amen amen yes praise the lord amen so very true amen that's what makes this roaring blaze in here this morning is all of our licks of hotter yeah amen matthew chapter 26 amen we're going to turn our scripture now matthew chapter 26 when we start reading amen matthew chapter 26. matthew 26 36 before we'll begin reading but before we do could we just our heads for a word of prayer precious jesus father sometimes lord i just feel like speaking in tongues because it just don't have enough english language to speak i i just don't have enough words to say lord and just the feeling of your presence and the and the pulsating of that holy ghost here now lord it's just so powerful father it's just so real and god it doesn't take people running and shouting and yelling and screaming lord but just the sweetness of that spirit lord oh god they've looked for you in the fire the lord in the in the whirlwinds and lord in the lightning and the thunder and the roars and everything going on but lord you just come in and that sweet small still voice yes when you speak to your children lord god you've done that again for us today and i'm believing you're going to continue to do it now and praying father that you would speak through these lips whatever you would have to be said today anoint our ears to hear lord with the with the revelation of the holy spirit god to receive it into our hearts that it be manifested in our lives bless us and use us father for your glory and honor yes we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way but god if the devil could even try to come into this presence i believe his feathers are going to be singed very much lord because your presence is so real to us now thank you god for this word thank you for this message thank you for the day and the hour you've given us the things you do for us every day lord unworthy as we are god you are so good to us we thank you lord for the prayer requests for the needs thank you for the praises thank you god for what you've done for us to you to pray that you'd help those believers our brothers and sisters over in europe lord and ukraine and russia and lord just around the world father we're one body yeah all our precious brothers and sisters around the world god would make up that mystical body of jesus christ we're all one we're together in this lord no matter what kinder tongue nation people color whatever it is lord we're all a part of the same family of god we just thank you for this time for this fellowship lord and around your word and i pray god now that you would speak to us once again and let your purpose your will whatever you have for us today be done as we submit ourselves and commit to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen matthew chapter 26 i'll read one verse subscription that will let you be seated i got a few more that the story that i want to read but um let's let's just read verse 39 amen let's read verse 39 so matthew 26 39 and he went a little further and fell down on his face and prayed saying oh my father if it was if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou will you be seated if you like amen now we know that god doesn't predestinate based on his will but god does have a will god does have a purpose god does have in his heart something for all of us yes and i do believe saints as we talked about last week and heard brother dennis praying and you know in our hearts and in our lives we can give perspective to the things that we know in the word and the and the prophecies that we've heard and we know that what god brought to our prophet and what he spoke and the prophecies he gave us and we exhorted that last week a little bit as he talked about watching russia and the things that's going on today and even as that prophecy went forth it was the soviet union it wasn't russia uh but but we do know and we do recognize that even when the perspective of that happens we don't try to make that fit anything i talked about that a little bit last week we see things happening but we i don't know that that's exactly that god does amen and if it is praise the lord i might have my opinion of it and it might be right it might be wrong but it doesn't matter because the number one thing that we always do number one that we always do is keep your eyes on christ amen amen keep your eyes on jesus praise the lord that's the number one thing amen to watch russia i believe you can watch i believe you can uh uh get the perspective on that while you keep your eyes on jesus but the number one thing that we always do is keep our eyes on jesus amen keep our eyes on christ now let's go back to the 36th verse i want to read through this story amen we all know the story very well and it's just a thought that came on my heart the other day um just trying to find something in the mind of the lord of what he might speak to us about and the lord took me back to last week when i made a couple of comments about you know it's no time to play church it's no time to fool around this is no time to straddle offense this is no time to act like a christian in church and and live like the world when you're not this is no time to pretend this is no time to put on heirs this is no time to be pretentious this is the time that we come and we're sold out to this we are sold out soul mind body spirit everything we are everything we've got to this because this is this is everything amen this word this this life uh this spirit it's everything it's all it's all in all to us but look down then jesus 36th verse then jesus cometh that are then cometh jesus with him unto a place called gethsemane and said unto the disciples set ye here while i go and pray yonder and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee began to be sorrowful and very heavy said unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death carry ye here and watch with me and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou will and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto peter what could you not watch with me one hour watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak he went away again the second time and prayed saying o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were very heavy he left him and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words then cometh he to his disciples and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest behold the hours at hand the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise let us go let us be going behold he is at hand that betrayed me now i want to focus on that 39th verse which is of course what we started off with and seeing when jesus coming to this place uh coming to to the place where it's a show down there in the garden of gethsemane this was a showdown with with with christ the spirit of god and the flesh of the man of jesus that was that was warring against each other and we know what that war is about we fight that war every day we fight that war every night with the spirit of christ that is in you god living his life through you and your flesh and the humanity and the carnality of your flesh warring against each other brother adam talked about that uh that old indian chief and uh they said how you doing chief he said well uh it's like a war going on inside me he said it's like a white dog and a black dog and they keep fighting each other and oh and he asked him said well chief said which dog's winning he said well it depends on which one i feed the most amen so if if the white dog is going to win then the white dog is the one that gets fed if the black dog's going to win then the black dogs are the ones that's going to get fed it's that war that constantly continued romans 7 paul talked about it that continuous war between people and law and grace even that people get mixed up and confused all the time people mix up law and grace especially if there's no revelation to it but the bottom line of this is that when jesus come to this showdown he himself in his flesh had to die to himself yes amen the only way that the will of god could could be manifested was that he died to his flesh that he died to himself that he humbled himself to come under subjection to the perfect will that god had predestined before the foundation of the world he had to die to that and look the way that he was able to do that look at the scripture the way it is read jesus came then with peter the sons of zebedee to the garden of gethsemane and when he came there he he admitted to them that his soul was exceeding sorrowful unto death but he said now carry here so he had them there but then the bible says that jesus had to go further and i believe that that would be an exhortation for all of us today now i i struggled with something to title this so just come up with something simple i believe today probably as much or more than any day as far as a wholesale group of people called the bride and the individuality of every human that's in that bride god's whispering to each one come closer amen come closer yes i believe christ wants us drawn closer to him i believe this is the hour the time more so than any now it's always been that way through the annals of time god's people and the fellowship that god had all through the old testament god desired to have fellowship with his people but there was a chasm that was thrown between god and man and the only way to even become acceptable in god's eyes was to follow that law but when the law was broken by the blood of jesus and that chasm was bridged by the blood of jesus god brought man and god back into fellowship again that we can become one again that we can have that communion again and ever since that time the cry has continually been come closer yes just come closer you know if you want more of god there's more of god for you that just proves there's more of god for you a man calls that deep calling to the deep if that deep is calling there's got to be a deep out there to respond because if the maker did not put something to call for it there it wouldn't be there to be responded to god wouldn't have put it there to begin with if there wasn't something out there to quench it amen and god's god's got that in each believer but i believe the cry that god is saying is come a little closer with jesus in the scripture jesus had to go a little further and when he went a little further he fell on his face and he prayed god if this cup could pass let it pass but if not thy will be done three times three times he did this even to i believe luke's the the one that writes that his sweat became as drops of blood now there's a little contention sometime that people would say that jesus sweated blood out of his pores but i don't think that's what the scripture says the scripture says his sweat became as it were it didn't say it was it said as it were so i believe his sweat was dripping off his body as a drop of blood wood so his sweat just like not just beads of sweat like most of us get sweaty or little beads of sweat but drops of sweat were falling off of his body like it would if he were bleeding the drops were coming off the sweat in such agony but jesus himself had to get to the place the flesh of the man jesus the only part of god brother and said the only part of god that could die was the flesh of christ that flesh was in such agony because of the pain that he was about to go through and he knew the pain he was about to go through but yet john tells us that jesus said i lay my life down and i pick it up again i have power to call 12 legions of angels that could take me off of this if i wanted to so his death as agony as it was came willingly he did it willingly because he knew what the price would be for your soul yes the price for your soul was the blood of christ and the life that was in that blood would come back on the worshipper but now if jesus had to do that what about us today if jesus had to come to that place and what about us yes if if jesus had to come to where he had to go a little bit further he had to go a little bit deeper to completely die listen to that now to completely die to that flesh jesus himself had to go a little bit further yes a little bit further three times he went in to pray in agony three times what about us if he had to do that to completely die to that flesh what is it for us today amen amen listen to this in desperations our dear lord jesus himself in the world's greatest battleground gethsemane cried out in despair should he take the sins of the world or should he just remain on earth with his beloved disciples what he wanted to do but watch his humility now there's where we're going to get to it just a minute amen because there's no way of dying to yourself unless you're willing to become humble amen and look humble humility is not something you do there's a lot of false humility today right that people come up and and they act all humble and pious and righteous and and maybe present themselves a certain way but humility isn't something you do humility is something you have humility is a is a defining characteristic of an individual because humility will bring you into all of the promises that god has given through his word the only way to reach any of them is to become humble amen amen humility humility to dying out to yourself jesus himself look brother said watch his humility as he humbled himself the god of all heaven and earth humbling himself becoming obedient to death even the death of the cross my humbling himself not my will but thine be done humble himself to the word the promised word of the of the god of heaven notice then he went a little further and if he went a little further how much more are we to go a little further now that's great exhortation for us today saints all of us if he had to go a little further what about us today doesn't that fall our lot that if we really desire to be a christian to be a child of god if we really desire the promises of god's word now look all the miracles all the things god's all those things in the operations of the holy spirit those are all going to happen because until the spirit of god is lifted off these gentiles and goes back to the jew the operation that spirit is still going to be in effect it's always going to be that way until it's gone it'll it'll be that way but i'm not talking about that those are great benefits that we get from being a christian and obeying god and living for god and being obedient to his word but those things are are available to anybody if they'll believe it i'm talking about something that that brings you into into complete unity and complete fellowship and a oneness with christ a oneness with christ against the spirit they're all fine but they're you don't even have to be repentant to have a gift of the spirit the miracles the blessings all that god does all those things those are wonderful saints but that we're talking about something beyond that we're talking about something that brings you into a dying of your own self that christ can have his fullness and the purpose and the will that he had predestined for you before the foundation of the world yes every one of us a union a fellowship a togetherness he had to go a little further yes i believe we do too yes i believe every one of us i believe a challenge if we could have 2022 is to get closer to the lord jesus this year yes amen god has paid the price he has done what he's supposed to do just like he had done here in the scripture god had done the work jesus is the one that had to go forward he is the one that had to press in to receiving death to himself see because christ had to die spiritually before he died physically he had to die to his human spirit first before he died in his flesh and laid down his life we have to do the same thing only way to be able to go a little further with god is in humility the only way that we can even get closer to god is to die more to ourselves yes is to die more to our will is to die more to our desires is to die more to our purpose and and what we want it's not what we want it's what he wants yes what do you want lord what is your will what do you want me to do if christ had to go further what about us how much more he says now ought we to go a little further my mind you know one of the worst places a person can get to is complacency right yes it's one of the worst places a human can get to is become so complacent now i'm not talking about contentment that's different being content being complacent are two totally different things being content with what god has done for you and what god has given you and where you are blessed that's one thing but being a complacent to where oh i i have reached that pinnacle i have reached that plateau i don't need to go any further i don't need to i'm completely dead to newton bennett then you know what you're done with god or let's just say god's done with you because you'll never go any further with christ until you are willing to give a little more yes until you're willing to die a little more jesus was at the end here he didn't just give a little more he gave everything he gave all he had he freely laid down his life and gave everything he had and he did it no fault of his own because of us now how much more should we do that see notice the scripture says here in luke that he prayed earnestly oh brother sister if jesus had to pray earnestly how much more have we got to pray earnestly god help us if christ the god of heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly how much more are we sinners saved by his grace to pray earnestly if the decision thrown the son of god into despair what will it do to you and i yeah desperately he says we cry yes cry to the lord desperately what does it say in isaiah god sent forth the marking angel that said mark those who are signing and crying the abominations and desolations done in the land how many in our hearts i'm not whether you share tear or not but in your spirit in your heart are crying and agonizing over the sin in this world today don't let it make us cynical friends don't don't let it make us uh uh to where we just well they just get what they deserve if we got what we deserved every one of us would burn in hell that shouldn't be our desire our desire our cry oh god if there's some way lord that you could just move on this person these people this world this country oh my we know what the fate of it is we know what the end of it is we know at the end of the bible we know what the word says but that doesn't change the desire that we have jesus christ went to calvary died shed his blood gave his life because he knew that there would be a handful of people through the annals of time that would receive him accept him and take that blood and him as their salvation yes he knew that he knew the far majority of the of the world would not receive it would reject him spit on him make fun of him and have nothing to do with him billions of people reject him but he did it anyway right i've made this statement often and i'll make it again if i was the only human ever walk this ball of dirt that would have received it and accepted it he would have done it anyway if you were the only person to walk this ball of dirt that would have accepted jesus christ as your savior and received him and the perpetuation of your sins he would have went to calvary just for you yes one person out of billions he would have still done that's how much you mean to him that's how much i mean to him he would have done it anyway but he had to do it in humility he had to die to himself the only way he could be able to rise back up from that was to die to himself the lower and the more humble you get the closer you get to god humility now not false humility right not someone that that acts you know i just i mean actual humility one of the biggest misconceptions that people have the struggle between pride and humility i actually heard a brother one time preach on bride pride i guess that's okay it's not something i would preach because the war with pride and humility i understand the premise of it i understand the point of of being able to stand your ground and take your place and know who you are yes but if it doesn't if that does not make you more humble then you've got the wrong spirit yes because no matter what god does for you and no matter what god reveals to you no matter what god blessings shine upon your life no matter what miracles perform and what healings god does if you don't take those things and make your and it make you more humble then you've got the wrong spirit amen i'm sorry friend but i've seen people that they take it and they walk around with it like a badge of pride like i am better than you friend if it not for the grace of god i'm walking the streets today amen amen if not for the grace of god yes that's why although i'm not happy about all the homelessness i don't blame them some of them probably do it i know some of them do it on purpose they don't want the responsibility but a lot of them there's these people should be taken care of and helped not just handouts but a way to get their life back where they can live a life but if it weren't for the grace of god where would any of us be that's right yes so we can't put anybody else down because it's not our doing anyway it's his ammo it's what he's done for us it's where he's brought us but if we can humble ourselves the lower you get the more humble you get not prideful humble that you get now there's there's nothing wrong for standing with what you believe there's nothing wrong with standing forth and speaking the truth there's nothing wrong with that people may think that you're prideful with it but you're not prideful you're just speaking the word people thought that about christ when jesus come forth even with pilate look at the conversation we spoke last week or read last week jesus had with pilate you would think jesus was the most smug prideful person there is oh you'd have no power if my father didn't give it to you does that not sound practical you're denigrating probably the most powerful man on the earth at that time by saying you wouldn't have any power off it wasn't for my father to give it to you right i mean but that's the truth jesus didn't say it with pride he said it with humility he expressed it with humility and the same thing is that we have that we do today it's got to be with humility humility what is humility i gotta i want to read a couple of scriptures philippians chapter two i honestly had a lot of scriptures and i did not want to and this wasn't even one of them but when i was studying through it and when the lord took me a certain direction this scripture came to my mind amen philippians chapter 2 verse 1. let's read it carefully closely now philippians 2 1 if there be therefore any consolation or consoling comfort in christ if any comfort of love amen because love's what comforts you can't comfort somebody unless you love them not really you might can express a falsehood for a little while make them feel a little bit better but they won't be comforted not true comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies now we know that just basically means the tender mercies your tender it's like a yearning from the depths of your soul that that bowels when it goes into the bowel it's like a it's like a depth of love not just filial love not just a surface uh love but a depth love a love that comes from the inside not a flesh love right bowels and mercies amen now remember jesus said blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy great told you this before you want mercy i want it i need it yes well if i want it i'm going to be willing to give it right yeah if you're willing to give it that's humility you can't give mercies to someone unless you humble yourself to that person right amen you understand you must humble yourself to that person if you to be willing to give them mercy in their life you must humble yourself to that person you must humble before them amen fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind listen now in lowliness what is that humility in humility in humility and loneliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves let each esteem other better than themselves now i'll say this for a few moments brother branham is gone and so i can't pin this rose on him but i've met in my life in ministry i i used to have a count dozens i'll just say dozens dozens maybe even a hundred people that personally knew brother branham personally knew him now i want you to understand something the only way that you can influence somebody else's life and we are christians and we want to express our lives as christians we want other people to become christians and so we express ourselves to those people so that they might want what we have to become christians themselves so they escape the the judgment of hell so that maybe even if they're just a worker outside the city they're not in hell something something to help somebody to help them in some way but friend you'll never be able to help somebody unless you humble yourselves to that person yes i don't care who they are i don't care street walker homeless person drug addict gambler i don't care who they are unless you're willing to humble yourselves to that person you can't help them and you're not going to help that person with your doctrine yes right those people that you try to witness to and speak to and talk to they don't care about your doctrine they want to know if you're a real true born-again holy ghost-filled christian amen because if they really want something that's what they want right they don't want just another church there's churches all over the place friend tucson is full of churches as spiritually dead as it is there's churches over tucson there's churches all over this country you go back to north carolina you can't hardly hit a rock in one direction without hitting the baptist church they're everywhere yes but there's churches everywhere sometimes me and brother roger will go down an obscure street down in the middle of town there's a church there's a church there's no church my goodness there's all these churches and there's just this is just the biggest out of way place you'd think who would come down this street to see all these churches there's churches one after the other they're all over the place people are looking for another church they're looking for a life amen they're looking for an experience they're looking for a way to get to jesus christ and you are that way and it's not through your doctrines through the humility of christ in your life speaking to that person and humbling yourselves before them to show them the real living jesus christ amen that's the only way you'll get to them that's the only way they'll see it and you may be the only christ that that person will ever see that's right you may be the only one why if that's the case then god help me that when i meet that person i present myself in a way that i humble myself to them to show jesus christ to that person all that i possibly can to help them since i've been putting up that panel at mary's thursday night and went by uh uh friday and people walk down the street all the time people couple people come up to the house one guy was there the other day and i i started talking to him and he asked me he said because the work was being done by part of the work was being done by sister priscilla's sister's husband mario some of you may know him you probably know marianne her sister she came to church here last time we had communion her husband was out there working and the guy came and he wanted some work done and i said well his wife's sister goes to our church and we got to talk and he said so you were the pastor i said yes sir i am he said and you worked for a living i said got to pay the bills i said yeah you better believe i do i'll work my fingers bloody to take care of my family in this church i'll do everything i can to keep it going amen and he said he was so used to those prosperity ministers talked about this guy he put him in a certain way that almost like he was his pastor but he wasn't happy about it prosperity minister he had this great jet i said well i don't know about planes you got to talk to my son about that he's the pilot and he was a pilot for delta but but you just my point is you try to reach a person where they are and humble yourself to that person and speak to them in a way that you might reflect christ that they might come to recognize hey there's something real here feel the spirit of god on them that gets harder and harder now because the closer you get to somebody the further they back up no no get away it's hard to get the closer you get to a person the more they can feel that spirit from you the more they feel that presence the spirit of god that draws people in you know sure it does that draws people in because there's that that humanity that was created by god that wants to go back to that amen that devil's got them all in his cages and just like an animal at the zoo he's got all these people in cages but you know god all of us came from him there's a soul in there that's worth 10 million worlds that soul's calling and wanting to go back there but we but that but that humility that brings us to that place see paul said here let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness in humility let each esteem other better than themselves now it didn't say for me to do humble myself before my congregation or before my brothers and sisters or for you before each other it said esteem other better than themselves well what is other another human yes humanity a person esteem better than themselves remember when you're living your life for others you're staring heaven in the face now we do it with wisdom obviously of the lord but when you're living your life for others you're staring heaven in the face praise the lord now some people misconstrue that and think that that means that every homeless person down every corner they're supposed to give them a ten dollar bill does not mean that right if the spirit moves you to do it you better do it right right the spirit moves you to give you leftovers from the restaurant to them do it if the spirit moves you to give him a bottle of water do it yes amen because it's god's calling it's god's leading not mine i'm saying she'd go broke giving twenty dollar bill to every person on the street down there today yeah it doesn't mean that but when you humble yourselves to that person and you humble yourselves to each other and esteem each other better than themselves remember the story oh that i was getting to a point a minute ago and i'm gonna say that before i get to this i've known dozens maybe a hundred people that personally knew brother brown thank you for bringing back back lord that knew him personally that spent time with him even like brother pat i'm not talking about people that were just in a service i'm talking about people that knew him personally that talked to him and sat down with him or had a had a interview with him or something probably dozens if not maybe 100 people and all kind of doctrines all kind of thoughts one believed he was god one others baptized in his name these people they preached this doctrine these group over here they preached this and and all the i just say a hundred all the hundred all all different thoughts that they have all different doctrines are all derived from a message from brother browner's ministry from this message they all derived from that but the one thing i could disseminate from every single person and you'll probably hear the marbles is brother pat nods his head from every person that i've talked to the one common denominator that they gave me about brother brown was his humility even when he walked out on stage with his usually bible tucked under his arm when he walked out on the platform when he walked out wherever they were the one common denominator of all the doctrines all the everything up they they try to spread everything to me tell me this brother brandon this and brother brown and all those things and all that that's all fine and good that's all their parts to play but the one thing that every one of them said was the most humble man they had ever met anybody that was brother branham's defining characteristic his humility friend that needs to be our defining characteristic it was jesus defining characteristic i preached the first time i preached to tucson tabernacle we were visiting from from florida 1998 december convention 98 i just turned 33. i sit in there down from the down from the platform from the pulpit say where sister matisse is you know if we were there like five six rows back on the end and the lord spoke to me and said that he's gonna it was it was the meetings for brother where brother green said you brothers be ready because i'm just gonna call you out of the audience and he did that night he called uh ron peterson he says to just be ready because i'm not i'm not i didn't announce who's going to be ministering and every night is going to be somebody different or whoever i feel led to do it lord spoke to me and said he's going to call you tomorrow night and i you talk about shaking in your boots i just turned 33 and first time really i've been at a tabernacle before but first time with any i guess you'd say prominence or got to meet brother green you talk about there's hundreds of people there i never spoke before that many people before god said he's going to call you tomorrow night i went back to the hotel room and i was up i was sitting in chair my mom was trying to we spent the room together and she was trying to sleep and and the lord just gave me scripture after scripture this is the first scripture he gave me the two most influential men in my life jesus christ number one and brother brown yes sir sure enough the next night brother perry green got up there and he talked about this young man from florida and he said i'm going to have him come and speak i grabbed my bible i got up there i said i knew he was going to do that because god told me that last night he was going to call him and this is the scripture the lord give me because i began to take the things that we know that that we read in the scripture about jesus everything he did was for somebody else yes everything jesus didn't do anything for himself right and then he he put food in his body and drink to keep his body alive but he kept his body alive to help other people yes so even his food his drape weren't selfish he humbled himself he humbled himself to humanity not just to his disciples but to his humanity to everyone and i started thinking about so many of the things i had heard and stories i had been told and the one story that stood out to me because it was at that meeting with brother greene remember the dark story you tucson tabernacle people remember the dark story brother green used to tell yeah he said i'd get up and uh uh play darts and he said uh he he watched brother branham and brother branham he hit a bull's eye every single dart hit hidden bull's-eye every dart and brother green sat there and he watched so he got up and he challenged brother branham he says you want to play a game he said yeah come on let's play and he said when i threw a four brother brown threw a five or however darks go is it high or low i can't remember high high score wins no low score wins no thanks i forget anyway every everyone that brother green threw brother branham threw one just worse than that one whatever it is threw one just worse one time brother green said i took a dart and i just slung it off the board all together and he said brother branham did the same thing he said now i don't get it brother branham he said i sat there and i watched you and i watched you play darts over and over and every single dart went the when you're playing me you can't win he said brother green i know what i can do i don't need to prove it to you or anybody else he said if there's any joy in winning why don't i let you enjoy friend that just i mean you think well that's a story no that was the man's defining characteristic he meant that he did that from his heart purposefully escaping other better than himself yes oh my dares i say because i've liked it my entire life but sports has ruined this country probably as much as anything has right because the competition of being driven to beat the next person well that's that is absolutely contrary from the scripture and how we're supposed to act there's nothing wrong with winning i i played media a volleyball game and landed head first in the concrete to get a ball but brother branham said if there's any joy in winning well i'll let you enjoy it amen well see that's why people look sometimes and they're like you know it doesn't bother you to lose not a bit so that's not healthy why not i i don't need to win everything i don't have to be the first person all the time i don't need to be the best at something and even if i was what difference does it make if i have to show it off to you well that's not humility and i'm not telling you if we ever have a supporter you go play volleyball to throw the game and then play but the defining characteristic is the bottom line is the humility yes esteeming other better than themselves and that's the point esteeming that person that's the way christ lived his life when brother roger was here that thought hit me and i i actually tears come down my face i don't think he saw it i started crying to think about what he did in his life how he lived his life he did not live his life for himself right he did not live his life for his wife or his children he lived his life for the people yes and that's what a that's what a servant does that's exactly what a servant does the best they can none of us are perfect we try to strive to the best we can but that humility is what brings it about it's what brings it to that forefront friend i believe that's why the bible talks about if somebody if you give to somebody give not expect expecting get back yes amen don't expect to get it back and if not that's fine but if you give just give give from your heart give freely give willingly give us unto the lord right we're going to give it to the lord and say hey god you know that money i gave you the other day i want it back no you give it that's why the bible says that you give it and don't expect that way if it never comes back you don't worry about it right there's no problem there's there's no contention there there's no wedge for this for the devil to get in because it's gone you forgot about it don't worry about it god will take care of you right yes god will take care of you and that's all that really matters not that five ten twenty hundred dollars no god will take care and supply your needs according to his riches so give it unto him that's just an example okay that's just an example of that esteeming others better than themselves i'm talking about god help us me the point of my life in getting closer to god you don't get closer by your doctrines your doctors don't bring you closer to god how you get closer to god is to die more to yourself that's how you get closer to god because that's the buffer that was the buffer in the garden of eden that was the buffer through the entire old testament as the buffer that humanity has had is this old body of clay that separates and brings a division between god and man if this body wasn't here friend we'd be in the presence of the lord we are anyway you know what i'm saying this body so when this how many places does the scripture talk about how many times does paul talk about mortifying the deeds of the flesh what does that mean that means dying killing yourself now paul himself said i die daily well what is death death is humility it's dying to christ it's dying to the word it's dying to but it's not just dying to him and his will is dying to other people it's humbling yourselves before others esteeming other better than that better than yourself right amen and what does it the mind of christ let this mind be in you which is in christ jesus look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others there's things that shape all of our lives there's things that mold our lives there's things that that that brings our lives together and in everyone in putting on the mind of christ and humbling himself to that point then you've got a book of acts all over again praise the lord not just not just us not just this church the body yes this city this state this country the world god's bride internationally we're all one we're all one together in him identified masterpiece of god he said i think it's when we can get together with this type of fellowship it does something to us and that just that just reminded me of the sometimes we have the dinner and the fellowship together i love that so much amen well that's kind of what he's saying here this type of fellowship it does something to us that's why i love sundays i love coming together or being in church here like this that draws us closer to each other and as we get closer to each other we also get closer to god amen how to get closer to god getting closer to one another how do you get closer to one another humble yourselves before each other die to yourself let the mind of christ be in you esteem other better than yourself amen amen praise the lord getting closer to god getting closer to each other brings us closer to god for jesus said in so much that you've done to the least of these my little ones you've done it done to me he said i got a little boy joseph sitting here billy's sitting here two dollars sitting back there white he said if anybody had something that you want to do real nice i would rather you do it to my children to my family than do it to me and so i feel maybe as a parent and he's the source of parenthood i think that that's the way god feels we serve him we serve him as we serve each other that's how we serve god how to do that humble yourself humility lowering yourself amen before others submitting yourselves to one another amen not necessarily not in the doctrine so much amen but but in the spirit colossians i'm going to close here just a minute colossians chapter 3 verse 1 if you then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affection on things above not on the things on the earth for if ye are dead for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god praise the lord you are dead and your life is hid in christ or with christ in god when christ who is our life shall appear then shall we he also appear with him in glory amen amen again paul said i die daily we die daily to ourselves james chapter four james 4 1 for whence come wars fighting's among you listen now the opposite the antithesis the opposite of this is whence comes wars fightings among you come they not hints even of your lusts that war in your members well that's not humility so why is there fight why is there aggression pride arrogance lusts the actual opposite of humility you see it going on in the world today russia put would have never gone in to ukraine if he didn't feel like he could have taken them but i think honestly and i'll just say this honestly i don't think the man cares i think we're so close to the end this man does not care right i don't think he cares as long as he's hit out in some bunker somewhere he doesn't care about his own people brother branham said it could be a crazy man one day walking by push that button right and we have safeguards in this country to prevent that but never said it would happen here but he's talked about that in russia yeah i don't know what safeguards they have you have to have two or three people with cards and and combinations and stuff for them to all do everything in continuity together one person can't push a nuclear but not in this country you're not supposed to right from what i know anyway but i don't know it's that way in russia but brother graham talked about that pushing that one crazy person somebody pushing that button i don't know but remember before one bomb can ever drop we're going to be gone bride will be gone saints but i don't think he cares it's just a lust that he has it's just the desire of the flesh that he has see he wants to go back to stalin and khrushchev and all this but those days are passed see there was a time and an anointing at that time where there was supposed to be war and commotion and a driving of the jews back to their homeland in the revelation seven the whole the angels stopped it world war ii stopped and they don't know why nobody well we know why because the scripture says so god said stop yes the angels went down there and stopped it and stopped just like that that was that time this is not the time for that the world is going to be overcome next by the beast and the beast doesn't come in through war and fighting right the beast comes in through peace and love and harmony yes the humility and you see the whole country now the whole country the world the world's not thirsting for war the world is thirsting for peace unity let's come together let's do this together in harmony that's the anointing today and that's the anointing that's going to bring the priest to his to his place that's what's that's what's going on now don't forget though what's going on behind the scenes yes we know what's going on behind the scenes the christian is being pushed out the real true christian the fanatical christian you know anybody that follows the letter of their of their holy writ is considered fanatical most uh muslims hindus the al-qaeda and and isis and those they kill the infidel you know why because that's what their holy word tells them to do right they follow that to the t others come along and melt it down and say oh no that's not what it means that's not what it says yes it is people get on the mormons because men have four and five six wives now why logically i have no idea they're just crazy i i that just logically blows my mind five or six lord help i'm thankful for the one i've got and i'm gonna keep her and that's it but they do that why because that's what their holy writ says and people call them fanatical because they follow the letter of their holy word we're called the same thing friend we're called fanatical holy roller whatever tag they want to put on it today everybody's got a label for something they don't agree with right you know if you don't agree with a certain thing or you know that it's against the word of god or something well they're going to label you something you know there's labels all over the place so they got a label for it but you're considered fanatical because we follow this word exactly like it's written if the bible says that moses staff was turned to a snake friend that stealth was turned to a slave amen if the bible says janice and james did the same thing by their magician's trick that's exactly what happened if moses stayed then ate up the other two snakes that is exactly what happened and we believe that now there's a lot of people out in the world today they don't oh this was a metaphor oh this was an allegory oh it wasn't meant to be just like that and they melt it all down and preach away the truth of god's word and just become a bunch of jellyfish renegades sorry but that's just the truth yeah amen but god's word is the truth god's word will never fail god's word doesn't lie and if it says it it's true it's right it's real that's why we follow it because what's in us identifies to what's on these pages which is christ and he is the word praise the lord and we humble ourselves through it thy will be done lord amen thy will be done there's wars fightings let me finish james four and then i'll close even of your lust that war in your members ye lust and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight in war yet ye have not because he asked not ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts ye adulterers and adulterers know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god friendship with the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god i'm not saying don't have friends that's not what it's saying right that's saying that you coming into and becoming light in the world that's what it's talking about amen living living like the world do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resists that the proud giveth grace and to the humble yes submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to god praise the lord draw nigh to god and he will draw mine to you cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your heart she double minded be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heavenness humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up yes amen he shall lift you up i'm not looking to be lifted up by man i'd rather god take me by the hand the man pat me on the back but how many times do people live their lives for the accolades for the for the power for for the the popularity for the money for the padding on the back that's not what we're here for friends that's not what god put us on this earth to do let each esteem other better than themselves and humility oh yes it is absolutely contrary to everything the world teaches us from childhood but god has given us the way of escape and that is from the world that is his word amen amen one more humble thyself he said uh he talked about methodist church listen how he talks about the methodist church here july 1963 the organization of the methodist church which is a fine bunch of people in that methodist church don't you never think they're not they are amen sometimes i wonder if we don't think that about the other message churches amen god help us brother graham said those people there are good people and don't ever think they're not right right amen we should think the same thing friend yes sometimes it seems like though that even message church to message churches don't feel that way about each other right much less about the methodist or baptist or catholic or whatever they are friend i've met a lot of catholics in my life and i've met a lot a lot of really nice good catholic people yes good people absolutely there are five bunch of people in that catholic church there are fine bunch in the presbyterian church all these places men and women they're waiting to see that light flash across their path who was that like you yes be that light that crosses their path that may be the only christ they see they'd be the only light they ever get in their entire life right that one glimpse it's coming from you yes help us lord amen you just keep flashing that light in humility and sweetness not in your doctrines humility it's not that god sent a prophet in humility and sweetness let's all grow closer to god by humbling ourselves amen amen let's stand let's all grow closer to god by humbling ourselves amen amen thank you lord jesus your wars against the flesh the war is against your spirit wars against everything in in humanity and carnality and everything that it tells you to the bible even says it's better to suffer loss and fault take fall than to fight over it i'm paraphrasing of course it's better to suffer loss and be defrauded than to fight about i'm right everybody wants to be right all right i know i'm right well fine that's
