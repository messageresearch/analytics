[41:31] turn in the Bible to uh 2 Corinthians
[41:34] chapter
[41:35] 10 amen 2 Corinthians chapter
[41:39] 10 we're going to pick up where we left
[41:41] off a couple of weeks ago on the Gateway
[41:44] mind amen we had our Mother's Day last
[41:48] week so um we will start back with the
[41:51] scripture we uh had last week 2
[41:53] Corinthians chapter 10 uh we'll begin
[41:56] with verse one
[41:58] 2 Corinthians 10 verse 1 but before we
[42:03] read the word we bow our heads for
[42:04] another word of
[42:06] prayer Lord Jesus we're so very thankful
[42:09] father
[42:10] again the blessings the love the grace
[42:12] that you give Lord just an unworthy
[42:15] people father as we are God but it's the
[42:18] blood that you shed at Calvary that
[42:19] makes us worthy it's your presence in
[42:22] our lives it's your spirit within us
[42:25] Lord that that you taking our place
[42:28] helps us allows us to be able to take
[42:31] your place being robed in your
[42:33] righteousness Lord yes as a human father
[42:36] we are nothing God but in you we are
[42:38] everything we thank you Lord for
[42:40] Watching Over Us strengthening us
[42:42] blessing us keeping us Lord when

[42:52] your hands yes how blessed we are how
[42:55] thankful we are Lord your great your
[42:57] mercy Lord so Bountiful father that an
[43:01] unmar favor God that we receive from you

[43:09] to us God in our lives the Assurance the
[43:12] Blessed Assurance to know that by faith
[43:15] we live God to trust you that you make
[43:18] all things work together for our good
[43:20] because we love you amen the Bible
[43:23] doesn't say you make all things work
[43:26] together because you you love us it says
[43:28] because we love you we thank you Lord
[43:32] because from our hearts that
[43:34] unconditional love returns back to you
[43:37] God because you first love us yes thank
[43:41] you God for this Grace thank you for
[43:43] this word thank you Lord for the
[43:45] blessings of being able to have service
[43:47] here again today and the desire in our
[43:49] hearts to be in the house of God we
[43:51] rebuke every demonic spirit that would
[43:53] try to hurt hinder and filtrate this
[43:55] service in any way
[43:57] that you Lord Jesus would get the glory
[43:59] honor and praise for all that is said
[44:01] and done here today we commit it to your
[44:03] hand thank thank you Lord for those that
[44:05] are come that are here today thank you
[44:07] those that may be streaming Lord we just
[44:10] bless your Holy Name Jesus and commit
[44:12] the remaining part of the service now
[44:14] into your hands in the name of the Lord
[44:16] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen
[44:20] second Corinthians chapter 10 uh verse
[44:23] 1 2 Corinthians 10:1 now I Paul
[44:28] uh myself beseech you by the meekness
[44:31] and gentleness of Christ who is who in
[44:34] presence and base among you but being
[44:38] absent and and bold toward you but I
[44:41] beseech you that I may not be bold when
[44:44] I am present with that confidence
[44:46] wherewith I think to be bold against
[44:48] some which think of us as if we walk
[44:50] according to the flesh for though we
[44:52] walk in the flesh we do not war after
[44:56] the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare
[44:58] are not carnal But Mighty through God to
[45:02] the pulling down of Satan's strongholds
[45:06] I know it doesn't say say tonight add
[45:08] that of course not adding to the word
[45:10] but that's the stronghold it's talking
[45:12] about amen casting down imaginations and
[45:16] every High thing that exalteth itself
[45:19] against the knowledge of God and
[45:21] bringeth into captivity every thought to
[45:25] The Obedience of Christ Christ the word
[45:28] and having in a Readiness to Revenge uh
[45:31] Revenge all Disobedience when your
[45:33] obedience is fulfilled you could be
[45:36] seated if you'd
[45:37] like I like the way that Paul starts
[45:40] this reading as uh we'll delve back just
[45:43] a little bit as he talks about the
[45:46] thankfulness of God in his life he talks
[45:48] about the humility how we are bold in
[45:51] the Lord but yet how we are humble
[45:53] before the Lord amen base means if you
[45:57] look at the word says present and base
[46:00] among you that just means loneliness
[46:03] that just means humility amen and in the
[46:06] humility and the loneliness of heart as
[46:09] we do amen towards one another and of
[46:12] course before the Lord coming not
[46:14] walking according to the flesh although
[46:17] we walk in the flesh we don't walk
[46:18] according to the flesh because we walk
[46:21] by faith we don't walk by flesh we don't
[46:24] walk by sight we walk by faith amen amen
[46:27] our spiritual walk of our spiritual life
[46:29] is not a walk of sea taste F smell here
[46:32] it's not something that we have in our
[46:33] imagination cons reason memory it is a
[46:36] walk that we walk by faith amen because
[46:39] we live by faith that walk of the Walk
[46:41] of Faith brings us to understand that we
[46:44] walk in the flesh but we walk not after
[46:47] the flesh to war after the flesh because
[46:50] the weapons of that Warfare amen are
[46:53] Mighty through God Amen to the pulling
[46:56] down down the bringing down of
[46:58] strongholds now remember last time
[47:00] couple of weeks ago what did we talk
[47:02] about was Satan's stronghold where is
[47:05] the stronghold that Satan uses what did
[47:07] Satan choose in the Garden of Eden what
[47:10] was his desired way to get to the
[47:13] individual the mind yes amen that was
[47:17] his chosen way brother said that was his
[47:20] chosen the Garden of Eden Satan chose
[47:22] the mind and God chose the heart it's
[47:25] the it's the mind the Gateway that he
[47:28] uses to try to get to each one of us
[47:30] through the mind the Gateway pulling
[47:33] down that stronghold that he uses now
[47:36] Satan uses those inlets into our body
[47:40] into our spirit to influence that mind
[47:43] to influence that Gateway because he
[47:45] knows that what you feel goes straight
[47:48] to your mind he knows what you see goes
[47:51] straight to your mind he knows what you
[47:54] uh uh imagine goes straight to your mind
[47:57] and that mind is the womb to the spirit
[48:00] to try to get down to actually bringing
[48:03] to pass the actual thought that you may
[48:05] have now it may it it it uh speaking of
[48:09] course on those thoughts the thoughts of
[48:11] the enemy those thoughts of the enemy
[48:13] are to be brought captive we talked
[48:15] about last time to bring captive to The
[48:18] Obedience of the word if it's a thought
[48:21] or something that's contrary to the word
[48:23] now first you must know what the
[48:25] scripture says if you don't you don't
[48:26] know what the scripture says how can you
[48:29] obey it amen it's like going down the
[48:32] the the the road here at 80 mil an hour
[48:35] and the cop stops you and says I'm going
[48:37] to give you a ticket because you're
[48:39] going 8 and 45 and you look and you go
[48:42] all the way down that road and there's
[48:44] not one single sign that tells you the
[48:46] speed limit is 45 that man cannot give
[48:49] you a ticket because there's nothing
[48:51] established if there's nothing
[48:53] established in the law no sign if
[48:55] there's nothing that tells you that it's
[48:58] 45 then you don't have to go
[49:01] 45 the cop can stop you all day long and
[49:04] say hey you're breaking the law what law
[49:06] there is no law it's not a law unless
[49:09] you tell
[49:10] me it's not a law unless I know that
[49:14] that what it says it tells me that the
[49:16] law is I can only go a certain speed
[49:19] it's not a law unless it says on the
[49:21] books it's a
[49:22] law then then what good does it do see
[49:25] if you don't know what the word says how
[49:27] can you know to obey it right if you
[49:29] don't know what the law is out on the
[49:31] street here how do you know to obey it
[49:34] amen you must know the law brother
[49:37] brother Dennis talked about obedience
[49:39] better than sacrifice absolutely but you
[49:41] have to know what to obey yes Who Who
[49:44] Are You obeying amen obey the word the
[49:48] word is what we are supposed to
[49:50] scriptures what we're supposed to know
[49:52] to have in in yes in our intellect in
[49:55] our knowledge yes yes but first in the
[49:58] soul amen because Christ is the word
[50:01] first in your soul now the thought that
[50:04] comes if it's a thought that's something
[50:07] contrary to to the word then you cast it
[50:11] down you bring it captive we talked
[50:13] about the computer last time you
[50:15] Captivate it like a like a virus in a
[50:17] computer you Captivate it and you hit
[50:20] delete so that that thought doesn't come
[50:23] drop down into your spirit and become
[50:25] real in your life and you act upon
[50:27] something that you should not be
[50:29] thinking about in the first place
[50:31] probably the devil's thought in the
[50:33] first place probably wasn't even your
[50:35] thought but the devil will try to
[50:37] convince you that it was your thought
[50:39] right but see he has he has access to be
[50:42] able to drop that into your mind amen he
[50:45] has access to be able to do it through
[50:47] the things that you see that's why we
[50:49] have to be careful about the things that
[50:52] we look at we talked about brother
[50:53] brandom in the cross last time amen we
[50:56] all know that story he also uses touch
[51:00] feel he uses imagination in your spirit
[51:03] he uses your imagination and your
[51:06] reasoning your conscience he uses those
[51:08] things to try to contact through your
[51:11] brain through your mind to drop down in
[51:13] your heart so that you start acting on
[51:16] things that you know are contrary to the
[51:19] word that's why we're to cast down cast
[51:21] down imagination cast down reasonings oh
[51:25] well it'll be okay
[51:27] God won't mind this is it against his
[51:30] word then he will mind it amen he didn't
[51:34] put it in there just to fill in space
[51:37] right God didn't write things in this in
[51:39] this word just to try to make it this
[51:43] thick he he didn't do it just to try to
[51:46] make sure there's uh 66 books in the
[51:49] Bible and and all the chapters and all
[51:52] he didn't do it just to fill space he
[51:55] did it because it's his work
[51:57] he did it because it came from him this
[52:01] is God's intellectual property like
[52:04] we've talked about before God's
[52:06] intellectual property there's laws in
[52:08] this country about someone's
[52:10] intellectual property if someone if
[52:13] something belongs to someone even a
[52:15] phrase a word uh a book written or
[52:19] something or a song lyrics it becomes
[52:22] that person's intellectual property and
[52:25] if someone tries to come and disseminate
[52:28] that and repeat it or sing it or
[52:30] whatever without permission of that
[52:33] person that's against the law you can't
[52:36] do that this is God's intellectual
[52:39] property it is him in letter form amen
[52:43] so that is we to come obedient to that
[52:46] word every thought every thought captive
[52:49] remember last time we talked about uh
[52:51] science even says 17
[52:54] seconds thought comes you have 17
[52:57] seconds to decide are you going to act
[52:59] upon that thought are you going to cast
[53:01] that thought out are you going to agree
[53:03] with that thought are you going to
[53:04] disagree with that thought or you going
[53:05] to uh do away with that thought 17
[53:09] seconds amen but I believe if something
[53:13] comes
[53:15] immediately you know I you Christians
[53:17] know well enough you know the word well
[53:19] enough to know immediately if it's
[53:21] something against God's word you cast it
[53:22] down amen amen yes or you find yourself
[53:26] in the next 10 15 minutes doing that
[53:28] thing that Satan persuaded you in your
[53:32] mind to do amen it dropped down in your
[53:35] heart when it dropped down in your heart
[53:37] then it became something that you acted
[53:39] upon amen you act upon it at that point
[53:43] and that's when it becomes a danger
[53:45] that's when it becomes a disastrous look
[53:48] here
[53:49] now in the mind look at this the patmas
[53:53] vision
[53:57] excuse me got up every morning in
[53:59] Florida it was 99% humidity get up here
[54:03] and it's 9 so I'm a little dry today uh
[54:08] the humidity wasn't fun to work in but
[54:10] uh I didn't have to put on any lotion I
[54:12] had to put it on lip
[54:14] balm um it it was it was very wet but
[54:18] now it's kind of dry today so I probably
[54:20] reach for the water bottle a little
[54:23] more so please forgive me but let's look
[54:25] at this quot Now voice of many Waters
[54:28] fourth personage of him the voice of God
[54:31] voice of many Waters he knows we know
[54:34] that brother said that's the ministry
[54:36] preaching bringing out the word called
[54:39] it the fourth personage of him amen his
[54:42] voice speaking when a when when a real
[54:45] true gifted by God uh called uh a person
[54:52] brings that word it's it's God speaking
[54:55] because it's God working through his
[54:57] gift just like we just like we agree and
[55:00] believe that someone gifted uh by the
[55:04] anointing of the Holy Spirit speaks in
[55:06] tongues or prophesies or something we
[55:09] take that prophecy a gift from God of
[55:13] God speaking through that person we take
[55:15] that word as from God Amen that's what
[55:18] that's what prophecy is that's what
[55:20] prophecy should be that's what it is
[55:22] amen when God's operating that gift is
[55:26] it's God's voice it's God's voice
[55:28] speaking amen the fourth personage of
[55:31] him voice of many Waters how are you
[55:35] going to do it when it's recorded in
[55:37] glory when the voice re uh tonight is
[55:41] recorded your voice is recorded your
[55:44] thoughts are recorded as a man thinketh
[55:48] in his heart so is he notice now I'm
[55:52] going to read this very familiar quote
[55:54] that we know notice now he says your
[55:58] thoughts are louder speak louder in
[56:01] heaven than your voice does on the
[56:04] earth amen your thoughts speak louder in
[56:09] heaven now brother green always used to
[56:11] say your your thoughts speak louder
[56:14] Before the Throne of God than do your
[56:15] words but I'm just reading this quote
[56:18] here uh your thoughts are louder in
[56:21] heaven than your voice is here on the
[56:24] earth mine amen that's pretty powerful
[56:28] people say I watch what I say of course
[56:30] we should we should temper our temper
[56:33] our words absolutely we should be in
[56:37] Mastery control of what we say sometimes
[56:41] uh that's probably not always true but
[56:45] we should amen especially as Christians
[56:48] always have uh have control over our
[56:51] mouths have control over our voices have
[56:53] control over what we say but remember
[56:56] remember your thoughts speak louder in
[57:01] heaven than your words even do here on
[57:03] Earth so what does that mean that means
[57:06] that we need to be very careful of the
[57:08] things that we think and when those
[57:10] things that s May Satan may drop into
[57:13] your mind cast it downen that's why the
[57:16] scripture says cast it down bring it
[57:18] captive to The Obedience of the word
[57:21] don't let it materialize don't entertain
[57:24] it don't let it become something that
[57:26] perverts then your mind your body your
[57:29] spirit because it will amen absolutely
[57:33] that's the whole point that he has to
[57:35] bring it forth for is so that it
[57:37] perverts you it perverts your body if
[57:41] you do something if you act upon
[57:43] something you know you should not do
[57:46] amen and the type of living and whatnot
[57:50] uh would destroy the body we're going to
[57:52] read about that in just a few minutes
[57:55] we're going to read a couple of
[57:56] scriptures where that actually happened
[57:58] in the
[57:59] body it will it will corrupt your mind
[58:03] because the mind is flesh and it is
[58:05] corruptible amen it'll corrupt your
[58:09] spirit it'll corrupt the things that we
[58:11] know that uh brings contact to God
[58:15] that's why we are to bring every thought
[58:18] because those thoughts speak louder
[58:20] before God than your words do here on
[58:22] Earth so being very careful of what our
[58:25] thoughts are our thoughts are very
[58:28] important controlling our thoughts are
[58:30] very important when those thoughts come
[58:33] in remember this is the Gateway the
[58:35] whole point of this message the whole
[58:37] the title of this message the Gateway
[58:39] it's the Gateway it's the is the way
[58:42] that brings it from out there into you
[58:46] to pervert or control over you amen amen
[58:51] look now let's look at this let's go
[58:54] over to Genesis I'm going to read I want
[58:56] to read a couple of
[58:59] examples Genesis chapter 3 two very
[59:03] contrasting minds and
[59:08] results Genesis chapter
[59:13] 3 know the stories very well
[59:16] obviously but recognizing the difference
[59:20] and the
[59:21] contrasting uh Minds thoughts
[59:24] here Genesis chapter 3:1 we know the
[59:28] scripture reading very well now the
[59:30] serpent was more subtle than any beast
[59:32] of the field which the Lord God had made
[59:35] and he said unto the woman yay hath God
[59:37] said ye shall not eat of every tree of
[59:40] the garden now he's already questioning
[59:42] God's word that's the first thing that
[59:44] the devil wants to try to put into your
[59:46] mind is questioning the authority of
[59:49] God's word right amen question the
[59:53] legitimacy and the accuracy of God's
[59:56] word yes it
[59:58] got millions of people today absolutely
[1:00:02] contrary to the word of God but remember
[1:00:05] without Revelation and only a carnal
[1:00:08] understanding it will never come to you
[1:00:11] a person an individual the way it the
[1:00:14] way that it will manifest and and uh uh
[1:00:17] replicate life it's got to comeon the
[1:00:20] way that it replicates life and the only
[1:00:23] way it can do is by Revelation not b not
[1:00:26] by intellect not by intelligence you
[1:00:28] can't go to some Seminary and learn you
[1:00:31] can learn all kinds of stuff but you
[1:00:33] can't learn God right amen uh uh I I
[1:00:37] think sometimes and I look around and
[1:00:39] this way that we live and this message
[1:00:41] that we believe it churches have become
[1:00:43] too
[1:00:44] messy amen I I'm not I'm not brother
[1:00:49] Bram did not come here to lead you to
[1:00:52] himself I am not here to lead you to him
[1:00:55] I am here to try to help you get to
[1:00:57] Jesus
[1:00:58] Christ not to him but to Christ the word
[1:01:03] amen we become so messy and it seems
[1:01:06] like there's so little Grace anymore
[1:01:10] with people in the message that they
[1:01:12] that they want to take it and hang it
[1:01:15] around your neck like a noose that was
[1:01:18] not the intended purpose when God
[1:01:20] brought it through a prophet yes amen it
[1:01:22] was the purpose was to bring that to
[1:01:25] bring that Christ real to you to make
[1:01:28] Christ real in your life to bring your
[1:01:31] relationship to him as close as any can
[1:01:35] be between spirit and flesh to bring
[1:01:38] that relationship as as brother B said
[1:01:41] Heaven and Earth embracing one another
[1:01:44] Heaven and Earth kissing Heaven and
[1:01:45] Earth brace embracing one another
[1:01:48] becoming one the invisible Union amen
[1:01:52] the invisible Union of the bride and the
[1:01:55] bridegroom
[1:01:56] Amen to bring the two together as one
[1:02:00] that's the whole point amen that's the
[1:02:02] reason it came not here to to to to get
[1:02:05] you to to a man but to Christ amen amen
[1:02:09] to Christ the word but so you see the
[1:02:13] first thing if he did this Tech now
[1:02:14] notice we could go over to Revelation 12
[1:02:16] and done the same thing he done the same
[1:02:19] thing in the garden of En he did in
[1:02:20] Revelation 12 when he was in heaven when
[1:02:22] it very first started very first sin
[1:02:24] cast on on Earth he continued the same
[1:02:27] thing what was it denying God's word
[1:02:29] trying to get you to disbelieve God's
[1:02:32] word try to plant a seed just a seed it
[1:02:36] doesn't take a whole tree it doesn't
[1:02:38] take a whole Orchard it just takes one
[1:02:41] seed to try to sew one seed of doubt in
[1:02:45] you about whether God's word is valid or
[1:02:47] not whether God's word is real true or
[1:02:49] not whether he'll stand by his word or
[1:02:52] not just one here in the Garden of Eden
[1:02:55] he does
[1:02:57] the
[1:02:58] question did God really say you shall
[1:03:01] not eat of every tree of the garden and
[1:03:03] the woman said unto the serpent we may
[1:03:06] eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[1:03:08] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[1:03:10] which is in the midst of the garden God
[1:03:13] has said ye shall not eat of it neither
[1:03:16] shall ye touch it lest ye die now
[1:03:20] remember as we know
[1:03:23] scripturally that voice was not spoken
[1:03:26] directly to Eve to the woman that word
[1:03:29] came through her husband Adam you can go
[1:03:33] over to the curses and see that that's
[1:03:35] the truth because when God gave the
[1:03:38] curses down he didn't say anything to
[1:03:40] the woman about disobeying his word but
[1:03:44] he did say it about Adam he did tell
[1:03:48] Adam because you disobeyed what I told
[1:03:52] you this is what's going to happen he
[1:03:54] didn't tell her that
[1:03:56] amen because that word what she just
[1:03:59] quoted repeated to the devil was the
[1:04:02] serpent was the word that her husband
[1:04:05] Adam had told
[1:04:06] her still
[1:04:09] true it's still God's word no matter who
[1:04:13] says it it's still God's word it's like
[1:04:16] U it's like that story that uh uh that
[1:04:20] woman had run out of food and she was in
[1:04:23] her bedroom on her knees crying out to
[1:04:25] God with her Wom Open Lord just bring me
[1:04:27] just a loaf of bread God I need a loaf
[1:04:29] of bread uh I I've run out of food and I
[1:04:32] pray that you just bring me a loaf of
[1:04:34] bread and soon and before too long the
[1:04:37] doorbell
[1:04:38] rings and she opens the door and there's
[1:04:42] there's bread there and she starts
[1:04:43] worshiping and thanking God thank you
[1:04:45] Lord for the bread thank you for
[1:04:47] answering my prayers these little boys
[1:04:49] had went and bought the bread and put it
[1:04:50] on her doorstep and hid in the bushes to
[1:04:53] make fun of her and she was celebrating
[1:04:56] and worshiping and praising God for the
[1:04:58] bread they come out of the Bush say lady
[1:05:01] God didn't give you that bread we went
[1:05:02] down and bought that bread for you she
[1:05:05] said God if you got to use two Little
[1:05:07] Devils to bring me bread thank you for
[1:05:09] the
[1:05:11] bread amen no matter who says it if it's
[1:05:15] the word it's the word amen no matter
[1:05:19] who brings it it's still true yes amen
[1:05:23] it's still right it's still God's word
[1:05:27] so yeah she was repeating it to the
[1:05:29] devil and yet it was still God's
[1:05:32] word even though she just repeated what
[1:05:35] Adam said but now the serpent found a
[1:05:39] found a crack in her
[1:05:42] testimony and he says and the serpent
[1:05:44] said unto the woman ye shall not surely
[1:05:48] die for God doth know that in the day ye
[1:05:52] eat thereof then your eyes shall be open
[1:05:55] and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and
[1:05:58] evil just one word just Twisted one word
[1:06:04] amen surely you'll die was God's word
[1:06:09] surely you'll not die was Satan's word
[1:06:13] amen amen which word came
[1:06:17] true amen God's word is still true God's
[1:06:21] word is still right God's word is still
[1:06:24] forever settled in heaven and can never
[1:06:27] fail God's word amen but she listened to
[1:06:32] the devil but remember where is the
[1:06:35] first place that it took place now I
[1:06:38] talked about uh the the I talked about
[1:06:41] the F but this was words words that the
[1:06:45] that the serpent said to her that came
[1:06:47] into her oratory that went into her mind
[1:06:52] it came into her mind through her ear
[1:06:56] amen then she saw lustfully with her eye
[1:07:02] that came into her mind remember before
[1:07:06] the act that happened there could ever
[1:07:09] take place it had to infiltrate the womb
[1:07:13] of her mind it had to come and be
[1:07:16] accepted and be received into the womb
[1:07:19] of her mind that God's word is not
[1:07:21] correct that God's word is not right and
[1:07:25] I I'll believe what this person says
[1:07:27] says instead of what God says and she
[1:07:30] first had to entertain and make a
[1:07:34] determination in her mind in that few
[1:07:37] brief seconds of what she was going to
[1:07:40] do she had to make up her mind she's
[1:07:43] free moral agent she could do whatever
[1:07:46] she wanted to do it was her
[1:07:48] choice same thing today
[1:07:50] Saints we are free moral agents to do
[1:07:53] whatever you want to do it is is your
[1:07:56] choice yes amen it is your choice it was
[1:07:59] her choice and she chose to believe the
[1:08:03] serpent instead of God and when that
[1:08:06] thing was entertained in her mind and
[1:08:09] look what it
[1:08:10] said when the woman saw now she first
[1:08:14] heard it and it embedded itself in her
[1:08:17] mind that Battleground that Gateway that
[1:08:21] place that that as entertained
[1:08:25] led to an actual act taking place cuz
[1:08:30] then she
[1:08:31] saw the woman saw that the tree was good
[1:08:35] for food amen she saw it then these
[1:08:39] entryways that the devil uses to try to
[1:08:42] deceive you Saints to try to cause you
[1:08:46] to do things that you know are contrary
[1:08:49] to God's
[1:08:51] word these inlets that he uses to
[1:08:54] manipulate your mind mind into accepting
[1:08:57] and receiving that thought that idea
[1:09:00] that way and before the ACT could ever
[1:09:04] take place it had to First be received
[1:09:07] into the womb of her mind right amen
[1:09:11] amen before she ever received a seed in
[1:09:14] her literal womb she received received
[1:09:19] the seed into her mind and notice what
[1:09:23] was it that we recognized as the
[1:09:25] evidence of the Holy Ghost it's
[1:09:29] receiving the Holy Spirit told the
[1:09:31] prophet it's receiving the word for your
[1:09:35] day yes it's receiving the word amen not
[1:09:39] just hearing it not just believing it
[1:09:42] but receiving the word what does that
[1:09:45] mean that means that becomes who you are
[1:09:48] yes you receive it into yourself yes
[1:09:50] amen we've all heard the phrase you are
[1:09:52] what you
[1:09:54] eat uh that that's true in the natural
[1:09:56] sense it's true in the spiritual sense
[1:09:59] you become what you
[1:10:01] ingest and to receive it you become it
[1:10:05] now just to believe it that's okay I
[1:10:08] mean I can believe that Godzilla exists
[1:10:13] but that doesn't mean I'm going to
[1:10:14] receive that amen I I I can say I
[1:10:19] believe that
[1:10:22] uh some astronomical thing but that
[1:10:27] doesn't make it right that doesn't make
[1:10:28] it real that doesn't mean that's what it
[1:10:32] becomes or who I become amen I might can
[1:10:34] believe something that doesn't make it
[1:10:36] right even though you believe doesn't
[1:10:39] mean you've taken it into
[1:10:40] yourself
[1:10:43] amen I receive it as I become
[1:10:47] it she received it and it became her she
[1:10:52] acted upon it so before she ever
[1:10:56] received a literal physical seed in her
[1:10:59] natural physical womb she had to receive
[1:11:03] the seed in her mind in
[1:11:06] her uh spiritual womb she had to receive
[1:11:10] it here before she ever received it here
[1:11:13] yes amen she saw that the tree was tree
[1:11:16] was good for food and it was pleasant to
[1:11:19] the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[1:11:21] make one wise she took of the fruit
[1:11:24] thereof and did eat and gave also under
[1:11:26] her husband with her and he did eat
[1:11:30] first had to come in the mine before it
[1:11:33] actually took place the eyes of them uh
[1:11:36] the eyes of them both were open they
[1:11:38] knew they were naked and they sewed fig
[1:11:40] leaves Together made themselves aers now

[1:11:44] pass the apples because people walking
[1:11:46] around naked everywhere amen amen that's
[1:11:50] truth yes especially in tuon Arizona

[1:11:57] streets with no clothes on yes or a
[1:11:59] stitch here and a stitch there I W say
[1:12:01] no clothes I mean basically we see it we

[1:12:11] look like a skin down weener and bulges
[1:12:14] here and humps there and it's not comely
[1:12:18] it's not godly amen and elicits a uh
[1:12:22] just to look on that elicits a lustful
[1:12:25] thought which is the whole point the
[1:12:27] devil's trying to get yes to listen a
[1:12:30] lustful thought in your mind yes amen

[1:12:37] the millions because we need them amen
[1:12:40] but it wasn't that and we know they
[1:12:43] found out that they were naked because
[1:12:44] of the act that took place amen amen the
[1:12:48] womb That Was Then received seed from
[1:12:52] first the serpent then from Adam

[1:13:26] listen the words that you
[1:13:29] speak we to say things that you should
[1:13:32] not say and look other people say things
[1:13:36] that come in your mind and you cast it
[1:13:38] down when you say it and it comes from
[1:13:41] your voice and your ears hear it and
[1:13:43] your mind processes it in your body
[1:13:46] knows that you spoke
[1:13:49] it and it affects your body it affects
[1:13:52] the chemistry of your body it affects
[1:13:54] the spirit part of your body affects it
[1:13:56] affects everything about you amen amen
[1:14:01] it has that effect on you we don't
[1:14:03] understand how powerful it is you
[1:14:05] remember when uh maybe maybe I should do
[1:14:08] it again uh at the Tabernacle many years
[1:14:10] ago I did the rice experiment where I
[1:14:13] had the two jars of rice and uh and I I
[1:14:18] actually wrote Love on the out I wrote
[1:14:21] Love if y'all don't remember I wrote
[1:14:24] Love on the piece of paper and I taped
[1:14:26] it to that jar of
[1:14:28] rice so that the rice could read it I
[1:14:31] didn't put it on there where you could
[1:14:33] read it from the outside but so that it
[1:14:35] could be read from the inside and I put
[1:14:37] hate on the other one and I just left
[1:14:40] them there I put they were the same room
[1:14:43] they were apart from each other but they
[1:14:45] were in the same room same condition
[1:14:47] same every absolutely everything about
[1:14:49] it was 100% the same within 30 days one
[1:14:52] was just rot and nasty and the other
[1:14:54] one's still just as white as could be
[1:14:56] the love rice was still almost looked
[1:14:58] atable of sitting on a shelf for a month
[1:15:02] still almost looked atable the other was
[1:15:04] so nasty and black just from the word
[1:15:06] hate didn't say
[1:15:09] anything can rice read I don't know but
[1:15:12] I know the power of those of of that of
[1:15:16] the spirit realm Saints of of those
[1:15:18] things are so very powerful just don't
[1:15:21] understand what effect because we don't
[1:15:22] a lot of times we don't feel an immed
[1:15:25] immediate effect of something adversely
[1:15:27] in our condition in our bodies Minds
[1:15:29] whatever we don't think much about it
[1:15:32] amen but it has an effect on us and it
[1:15:35] comes from the things that that drop
[1:15:37] into our minds that that we that we
[1:15:41] entertain that takes over us that
[1:15:44] changes the the structure of our our
[1:15:47] body Spirit Soul everything about us it
[1:15:51] has an adverse effect it's very
[1:15:53] important to understand the controlling
[1:15:55] to bring every thought every negative
[1:15:58] thought Satan is out there to do nothing
[1:16:01] to you but to defeat you Amen to scare
[1:16:05] you yes to make you worry about
[1:16:07] everything to try to defeat you down so
[1:16:10] that your spirit is so beaten up that
[1:16:12] you don't even feel like yourself
[1:16:15] anymore that's the tactics that comes
[1:16:17] into your mind the devil's playing with
[1:16:20] your mind but God owns your soul amen
[1:16:24] and that's one thing the devil cannot
[1:16:27] touch you just use
[1:16:29] that the spirit of God to deflect that
[1:16:33] devil get thee behind me Satan amen boo
[1:16:37] devil yes amen that devil must go by the
[1:16:41] authority of God in you praise the Lord
[1:16:44] now look one
[1:16:46] story in the mind the womb first the
[1:16:51] seed dropped in the mind first before it
[1:16:53] ever receiv receives seed in the womb in
[1:16:55] the physical womb let's go to another
[1:16:59] story let's go over to St Luke chap
[1:17:09] 1 St Luke chapter
[1:17:13] 1 we'll read beginning with verse
[1:17:19] 26 St Luke 126
[1:17:29] in the sixth
[1:17:30] month the angel Gabriel was sent from
[1:17:34] God unto a city of Galilee named
[1:17:37] Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man
[1:17:42] whose name was Joseph of the House of
[1:17:44] David the virgin's name was Mary and the
[1:17:48] angel came in unto her and said hell
[1:17:51] thou are thou that are highly favored
[1:17:54] the Lord is with thee blessed art thou
[1:17:57] among women and when she saw him she was
[1:18:01] troubled at this saying and cast in her
[1:18:03] mind what manner of salutation this
[1:18:06] should be where did it first get
[1:18:08] entertained in
[1:18:10] Mary well the Bible right here says and
[1:18:13] cast in her
[1:18:16] mind in her mind what manner of
[1:18:20] salutation this should be amen
[1:18:24] and the angel again through the ears
[1:18:27] auditory into the mind she she she uh
[1:18:32] cast it in her mind what matter of
[1:18:34] salutation now and the angel said unto
[1:18:37] her fear not Mary for thou H has found
[1:18:42] favor with God praise the Lord and
[1:18:46] behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[1:18:50] conceive in thy womb and bring forth the
[1:18:53] son and shall call his name
[1:18:56] Jesus in her womb physical but where did
[1:19:01] she first casted to the understanding of
[1:19:05] what this Angel was saying in her
[1:19:07] mind amen exact same thing is the
[1:19:11] serpent came to
[1:19:12] Eve this Angel Gabriel came to Mary and
[1:19:16] cast in her mind
[1:19:19] salutations now the similarities they
[1:19:23] were both women
[1:19:25] amen similarities they both were free
[1:19:29] moral agents to choose what they wanted
[1:19:33] to do it was their decision it was Eve's
[1:19:37] decision the woman at that time decision
[1:19:40] to decide which way she was going to go
[1:19:42] this also is Mary's
[1:19:45] decision it is her choice in her mind
[1:19:49] now she is reasoning it in her mind
[1:19:52] casting it in her mind
[1:19:55] amen that is is this something that's
[1:20:00] real well when you cast something in
[1:20:02] your mind what do you do you look back
[1:20:05] at the scripture there something you say
[1:20:07] whether you're not sure whether or not
[1:20:08] this is something of scripture or not I
[1:20:11] imagine in Mary's mind especially being
[1:20:13] a spouse of Joseph son of David in the
[1:20:15] lineage of David I imagine in her mind
[1:20:18] she looked back in this at this
[1:20:21] salutation she looked back in her mind
[1:20:25] through the scripture and found where
[1:20:28] Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive and
[1:20:32] when she found that in her mind as she
[1:20:35] was reasoning this salutation in her
[1:20:37] mind she found that scripture that word
[1:20:41] that said that a virgin shall conceive
[1:20:45] in her mind she received it praise God
[1:20:49] in her mind the seed took place because
[1:20:52] she looked back and said this is the
[1:20:55] word this is scripture I believe it amen
[1:21:01] I receive it praise God let's look here
[1:21:05] angel said fear not Mary for thou H has

[1:21:23] he shall reign over the house of Jacob o
[1:21:26] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[1:21:29] be no
[1:21:30] end then Mary said unto the angel how uh
[1:21:35] how shall this be seeing that I know not
[1:21:37] a man the angel answered and said unto
[1:21:39] her the Holy Ghost praise the Lord amen
[1:21:44] can you imagine as that prophecy went
[1:21:47] forth from Isaiah that said a virgin
[1:21:50] shall conceived you imagine how many
[1:21:53] time we look back in retrospect we know
[1:21:55] amen but if you're back if you're
[1:21:57] listening to that prophecy and you're
[1:21:59] looking forward you thinking how in the
[1:22:01] world is a woman going to conceive
[1:22:04] knowing no man how is this going to
[1:22:07] happen how can this be so you can
[1:22:10] imagine her conation and trying to find
[1:22:12] out okay I look back I see in the
[1:22:14] scripture says Okay a virgin is going to
[1:22:16] conceive but she's got the angel right
[1:22:18] there and they said but how is this
[1:22:19] going to happen I I've never known a man
[1:22:22] how is this going to take place
[1:22:25] amen the Holy Ghost the angel answer
[1:22:28] said to her the Holy Ghost praise the
[1:22:31] Lord not the third person in a trinity
[1:22:33] but God himself in spirit form shall
[1:22:37] come upon thee and the power of the
[1:22:39] highest shall overshadow thee therefore
[1:22:42] also that this that Holy thing which uh
[1:22:46] which shall be born of thee shall be
[1:22:48] called The Son of God and behold thy
[1:22:51] cousin Elizabeth she she ha also also
[1:22:54] conceived a son in her old age this is a
[1:22:58] six Monon with her child who is who was
[1:23:01] called
[1:23:01] baren for with God nothing shall be
[1:23:05] impossible amen and Mary
[1:23:08] said
[1:23:12] amen behold the handmade of the
[1:23:16] Lord be it unto me according to Thy
[1:23:22] word amen amen
[1:23:25] behold your hand made be it unto me
[1:23:29] according to your word hallelujah the
[1:23:32] word that came into her mind and dropped
[1:23:34] a seed then from the Holy Ghost came the
[1:23:38] seed of God into her womb and conceived
[1:23:42] the child that was born Christ Jesus
[1:23:46] hallelujah amen amen but it had to first
[1:23:49] come in her mind she had to receive it
[1:23:52] she had to receive the seed in this womb
[1:23:54] first before she could ever receive seed
[1:23:57] in this womb but as soon as she received
[1:23:59] word seed in this womb she was convinced
[1:24:02] of understanding how this is going to
[1:24:04] happen and don't tell me Saints don't
[1:24:07] tell me that none of you have asked God
[1:24:09] how or
[1:24:11] why amen because I know you be
[1:24:15] lying we have all asked God why before
[1:24:19] or how I understand but how is this
[1:24:22] going to happen I believe it but how is
[1:24:25] this going to be she was just a simple
[1:24:27] human and asking Lord I don't understand
[1:24:30] how is this going to happen and when the
[1:24:31] angel explained to her the spirit of God
[1:24:34] is going to come and overshadow you she
[1:24:36] said be it unto me according to that
[1:24:40] word praise the Lord you know what that
[1:24:44] meant I I I I was going to save this for
[1:24:47] a Christmas message probably still will
[1:24:49] but you know she signed her death
[1:24:51] warrant
[1:24:54] man yes she did she was an unmarried
[1:24:57] woman yes who is is who was with child I
[1:25:02] mean back then you were stoned
[1:25:05] dead if if adultery why it changed I
[1:25:08] don't know but anyway Grace um were
[1:25:12] caught in the act of adultery you were
[1:25:14] stoned dead I mean to be found with a
[1:25:16] child and not and not married I mean her
[1:25:19] and Joseph just were they they they just
[1:25:22] their lives were over as you would say
[1:25:25] there that people wouldn't want to have
[1:25:27] anything to do with them
[1:25:29] anymore because obviously naturally the
[1:25:32] outside world's going to say oh he got
[1:25:34] her pregnant they're not even married
[1:25:36] yet
[1:25:38] amen praise the Lord little did they
[1:25:41] know they don't realize God has a plan
[1:25:45] yes he God always has a plan and it
[1:25:48] doesn't always go and sometimes doesn't
[1:25:51] go as we plan sometimes that that plan
[1:25:54] goes into God's permissive will but God
[1:25:57] has a plan and he always brings that
[1:26:00] plan to pass and it always comes to work
[1:26:02] out for our good somehow he makes it
[1:26:05] work that way yes but she had to she had
[1:26:08] to receive it in her mind first in her
[1:26:11] mind her womb of her mind before it
[1:26:13] could ever be received into her natural
[1:26:16] womb amen had to be one place before it
[1:26:19] could be the other amen just like Eve
[1:26:22] but this was God's word now see Eve left
[1:26:27] God's word to receive what the serpent
[1:26:30] was saying Eve uh Mary conceived in her
[1:26:34] mind what it that it was God's word
[1:26:37] before she ever received it there's the
[1:26:40] difference amen and that's the
[1:26:43] difference that we look at today that's
[1:26:45] that's the difference that we that comes
[1:26:47] into our lives every day now is it
[1:26:51] something that is of god or is it
[1:26:52] something that is of the devil
[1:26:55] and and and you you should know well
[1:26:57] enough to know this is of the devil or
[1:26:59] this is you should be able to feel even
[1:27:01] in your if you're born again you should
[1:27:04] even be able to fill in your spirit
[1:27:05] whether this is God or not amen even if
[1:27:08] you don't know every single word that's
[1:27:11] written in this book you should know by
[1:27:12] the holy spirit that lives in you is
[1:27:14] this that this is God or not God right
[1:27:17] amen amen praise the Lord look
[1:27:20] here and now the smoke of words your
[1:27:22] original seed
[1:27:26] spoken words Original
[1:27:30] Seed seed seed now let's go that back
[1:27:35] now he said pick up again come down for
[1:27:38] something you remember last service last
[1:27:40] Sunday service he's talking about G to
[1:27:43] the soul he's referring back to the
[1:27:45] messages that I'm referring to the the
[1:27:48] greatest battle ever
[1:27:49] fought that he that he ministered you
[1:27:51] remember now there's a womb of the phys
[1:27:54] physical there's a womb of the spirit
[1:27:56] you believe that there's a spiritual
[1:27:57] womb physical womb and the mind the mind
[1:28:01] is the womb to the
[1:28:03] spirit now remember I told you last
[1:28:05] Sunday draw it out here before you these
[1:28:07] five senses he's talking about SE taste
[1:28:08] F smell here five senses on the spirit
[1:28:11] the conscience imagination affection
[1:28:13] reason memory in the in the spirit realm
[1:28:16] now on the left side there's only one
[1:28:19] and that's left on the basis of free
[1:28:21] moral agency to accept take take in free
[1:28:25] moral agency now to take in or to let
[1:28:29] out to receive it or to rejected as a
[1:28:33] free moral agent your choice amen see he
[1:28:37] says now see that's how
[1:28:40] adultery that's how adultery is
[1:28:42] committed
[1:28:44] spiritually yes it's how it's committed
[1:28:46] physically too but that's how spiritual
[1:28:49] adultery is
[1:28:51] committed when you knowing better of the
[1:28:54] word of God by the Intercourse of your
[1:28:56] mind taken alive the devil against the
[1:28:59] word of God that's exactly what Eve done
[1:29:02] with a spiritual intercourse first it
[1:29:04] come by believing Satan's light into the
[1:29:07] womb of her mind that polluted her soul
[1:29:12] set death in the soul then the natural
[1:29:16] act took
[1:29:18] place help us Lord the one leads to the
[1:29:22] other
[1:29:24] that led to the soul that's when the
[1:29:26] natural act and that's the only way that
[1:29:29] a woman ever can commit adultery against
[1:29:31] her husband is the first let the let
[1:29:33] some man talk her into it then receive
[1:29:36] another man that's not her husband
[1:29:38] that's committed adultery when the Bride
[1:29:41] of Jesus Christ lets man-made Creed
[1:29:43] dogmas take place in the word of God she
[1:29:46] is absolutely committing spiritual
[1:29:48] adultery yes did not Jesus say whoever
[1:29:51] lookth whoever lookth Upon a woman to
[1:29:55] love after her has committed adultery
[1:29:58] with her already in his heart yes look
[1:30:01] at the p a woman to lust after her had

[1:30:28] better way to say it I don't know uh
[1:30:31] they look like Redlight women anyway
[1:30:33] they come and park and there's guys in
[1:30:35] the office and they come and look and
[1:30:36] they're oing over and that I said you
[1:30:38] guys better be
[1:30:39] careful they said Look new I said uh no
[1:30:43] you guys better be careful I said the
[1:30:46] Bible says if you look on that woman to
[1:30:48] lust after her You' committed it in your
[1:30:49] heart already Yes amen honestly I be
[1:30:54] honest they turned their heads and
[1:30:56] didn't look
[1:30:57] again they didn't say another word they
[1:31:00] didn't they they didn't chide me or call
[1:31:04] me crazy or anything like that they
[1:31:06] actually turned their heads quit looking
[1:31:08] and didn't say anything else about it we
[1:31:09] just continued on with our business is
[1:31:12] that's the truth see amen Jesus said
[1:31:15] that that's the word of God look now in
[1:31:18] their minds already look at the upon a
[1:31:20] woman she let it come into the mind
[1:31:23] that's the W that starts the things
[1:31:25] moving the thing that starts the thing
[1:31:27] moving Satan coming in we were sowed
[1:31:30] with the word someday I'll bring back to
[1:31:32] life uh uh I'll bring the life into the
[1:31:36] Earth and multiply replenish your Earth
[1:31:38] what eeve what Eve failed to do Mary did
[1:31:44] praise God amen amen and we are just
[1:31:47] read the difference the contrasting
[1:31:49] Stark difference between the two amen
[1:31:54] what Eve failed to do Mary did she took
[1:31:56] the word eve took Satan's lie Mary took
[1:32:00] God's word and through Mary's seed
[1:32:02] replenishes the Earth again through the
[1:32:04] bride through the word will bring up in
[1:32:06] the will bring it up in the Millennium
[1:32:09] through that goes the word the word is
[1:32:12] planted into every predestinated heart
[1:32:15] praise God for that yes Spirit comes
[1:32:17] down and Waters it they cannot cannot
[1:32:21] cannot you cannot
[1:32:24] die amen I will raise him up again at
[1:32:27] the last day yes what is it the mind is
[1:32:30] the womb to the spirit yes to take in or
[1:32:33] to let out amen a little further down he
[1:32:36] goes on and says so what this was both
[1:32:39] physical and spiritual with Eve first at
[1:32:43] and and any and anytime not just Eve but
[1:32:46] anytime I told you asked you this
[1:32:49] morning sisters to forgive me sisters
[1:32:51] forgive me so I can mention that at the
[1:32:53] anytime that a woman takes the wrong
[1:32:55] step I'm talking about Christ and and
[1:32:58] the bride now but anytime a woman takes
[1:33:01] the wrong step she has to First receive
[1:33:03] it in her mind yes some Slicker has to
[1:33:06] persuade her and she listens to it
[1:33:09] against her own better judgment than the
[1:33:11] ACT then the ACT is committed right so
[1:33:15] first inity can be anything doesn't have
[1:33:17] to just be adultery we focused on that
[1:33:19] thing with even Mary today it doesn't
[1:33:21] have to be that situation specifically
[1:33:24] could be anything amen that that some
[1:33:29] something even simple something
[1:33:32] even as we would say relatively Innocent
[1:33:36] but something that's a perversion
[1:33:38] something that's against God's word
[1:33:40] something that we reason oh God will
[1:33:44] forgive me God will
[1:33:47] understand amen that's reasoning what
[1:33:49] are we supposed to do with reasoning
[1:33:51] cast It cast it down
[1:33:54] amen praise the
[1:33:56] Lord so first it hit Satan hit Eve's
[1:34:00] mind womb of her mind she doubted God's
[1:34:03] word doubted it he questioned it she
[1:34:05] doubted it then come the actual act the
[1:34:08] only way that ever that we can ever be
[1:34:10] born again is first in the womb of the
[1:34:12] Mind receive the word and then the
[1:34:14] spirit comes on top of that to bring it
[1:34:16] to life praise the Lord it can happen in
[1:34:20] a good way the good things that God
[1:34:23] brings into to us can bring good results
[1:34:25] in our life can bring good words out of
[1:34:28] our mouth can bring good thoughts can
[1:34:31] bring good actions amen when you receive
[1:34:34] the Holy Ghost as he just said it
[1:34:37] changed you
[1:34:39] forever eternally praise God but in a
[1:34:42] good way this time not in a bad way you
[1:34:45] didn't grow here but you grew
[1:34:47] spiritually amen because of Christ
[1:34:50] coming because of the word because of
[1:34:52] the spirit of God coming
[1:34:54] amen note Mary's womb the physical mind
[1:34:59] was a virgin womb her physical mind was
[1:35:01] a virgin wom why she believed why she
[1:35:04] believed God's word no matter how much
[1:35:06] now this is married no matter how much
[1:35:09] uh anybody criticized how many things uh
[1:35:12] somebody said that didn't have one thing
[1:35:15] to do with
[1:35:16] it she believed God's word regardless oh
[1:35:19] I wish I could just get that over he
[1:35:21] says first was in her mind before the
[1:35:24] ACT could ever take place in the literal
[1:35:26] womb the ACT had to take place in uh uh
[1:35:30] in her literal womb the ACT had to first
[1:35:32] take place in her mind amen the spirit
[1:35:36] of God let the rest of the work take
[1:35:38] place now I want to read one more
[1:35:40] scriptures I'm CL going to close here I
