[39:30] them in prayer sister norma said she had
[39:32] got me come
[39:34] here in prayer and he got the prayer
[39:36] request from sister shelia
[39:38] and for the day by text for the day

[40:11] appreciate being here and appreciate you
[40:13] all being here today
[40:14] amen those are on the hook up amen
[40:17] welcome as well so
[40:18] god bless you we want to stand to our
[40:21] feet now
[40:22] and go into the scripture
[40:28] again we're going to go to revelation
[40:29] chapter 10 verse 7.
[40:34] revelation chapter 10 verse 7 read that
[40:36] verse of scripture as we
[40:38] probably as it looks like i'm going to
[40:40] finish up this thought
[40:42] that we had the mysteries of god in
[40:44] christ this will be part
[40:46] part 16 the mysteries of god in christ
[40:50] part
[40:50] 16 and the restoration of his kingdom
[40:52] part 3.
[40:54] so lord willing unless the lord does
[40:57] something else
[40:58] beyond this i feel like this would be
[40:59] the last one for here
[41:01] but we have something to follow up the
[41:03] lord willing next sunday from there and
[41:05] then
[41:05] just whatever the lord will christ what
[41:07] we want to do
[41:09] so we want to go back to revelation
[41:11] chapter 10 where we start the readings
[41:12] for this
[41:13] each time that we uh begin this so but
[41:16] before we read the word
[41:17] let's just buy our heads for another
[41:18] word prayer precious lord jesus
[41:21] father it is indeed a privilege lord
[41:23] there's people across
[41:24] across the world lord of different
[41:26] countries that are
[41:28] under threat of death or imprisonment
[41:30] just to speak that precious wonderful
[41:32] holy name of jesus that we just sung out
[41:35] so boldly lord in worship and praise to
[41:37] you
[41:38] praying god and believing that that
[41:40] worship was received to you as a sweet
[41:42] smelling savior god
[41:44] that you're invited lord to be here
[41:46] welcome to stay and
[41:47] without your presence father we just
[41:49] fold them up and just go home now
[41:51] but we're believing that you're here god
[41:53] we know that you're here
[41:54] you promised to be here where two or
[41:56] three are gathered in your name you'd be
[41:58] in the midst there's many of those
[42:00] more than two or three here today god so
[42:02] we expect and believe that you're here
[42:04] to do the exceedingly and abundantly
[42:06] to speak through these lips the words
[42:08] you'd have us to hear the anointing here
[42:09] as well to move upon those that are
[42:12] on the streaming now god that your hand
[42:13] would be upon them as well
[42:15] lord may what you have purpose and
[42:17] accomplish
[42:18] and uh determined in your mind and set
[42:21] and predetermined before the
[42:23] foundational world for this service to
[42:25] accomplish
[42:26] that it would be accomplished today
[42:27] through us your people father
[42:30] lord let that full expression of jesus
[42:32] christ
[42:33] continue to exude and to promote itself
[42:36] and live through us
[42:37] in every way god according to the
[42:39] purpose that you've called us to
[42:41] and in your perfect will father be led
[42:43] by your spirit in all things
[42:45] we are not ourselves we are bought with
[42:47] the christ and we believe god we read
[42:49] once again
[42:50] but in the days of the voice of the
[42:52] seventh angel
[42:53] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[42:56] of god should be finished as he had
[42:57] declared to his servants
[42:59] the prophets you could be seated as you
[43:02] if you'd like
[43:04] thought another thing on here this uh
[43:06] scripture reading and the more you read
[43:08] it the more it stands out to you but
[43:11] another thing i saw here that god the
[43:13] mystery of god being finished
[43:15] completed or come to a a full
[43:18] understanding of fruition to
[43:20] his people because that's what this is
[43:22] focused towards
[43:23] as he had declared to his servants the
[43:26] prophets or we could say
[43:27] through his servants the prophets
[43:29] because that was really the main
[43:31] the main reason the main subject was it
[43:33] was through
[43:34] his servants the prophets amen it wasn't
[43:37] just to
[43:37] them it was through them amen
[43:42] last week we talked about it went
[43:43] through the kingdom god spoke and it
[43:46] became man
[43:46] uh manifested or or tangible or
[43:49] it became real became physical and then
[43:52] that's when god put adam and eve in the
[43:54] garden of eden and then
[43:55] the fall happened after the fall there
[43:57] came a time of
[43:58] uh god began to speak of a time of
[44:00] restoration to bring it back to that
[44:02] place
[44:03] and his words was in god's mind before
[44:05] the fall and i believe that's where god
[44:07] wants it to be now
[44:09] now uh luke 17 i want to read again
[44:11] these two verses 17
[44:13] 20 and 21. now he may not be
[44:16] uh too long this afternoon or this
[44:18] morning but
[44:19] however the lord would lead it but luke
[44:21] 17 verse 20 i want to read this
[44:24] scripture again to follow up from last
[44:26] week
[44:27] to bring us into the subject that i want
[44:29] to talk about today
[44:31] luke 17 20 when he was and when he was
[44:34] demanded of the pharisees when the
[44:36] kingdom of god should come he
[44:38] answered them and said the kingdom of
[44:40] god cometh not with observation we
[44:42] talked about that last week
[44:44] this part of that restoration that
[44:46] kingdom
[44:47] was not something that was tangible it
[44:50] wasn't something that was physical
[44:51] although
[44:52] jesus was standing there before them
[44:55] they said if
[44:56] jesus told him that this is happening
[44:57] and this is happening and these things
[44:59] are taking place
[45:00] that means that the kingdom of god has
[45:02] come unto you
[45:04] so what's he saying he's identifying
[45:06] himself
[45:07] who he is right there to those pharisees
[45:10] and sadducees to understand
[45:12] if this is happening and this is
[45:13] happening this has happened of course
[45:14] they called him
[45:15] uh beals above and he cast out devil
[45:17] devils by the o's above and you know the
[45:19] story the scriptural
[45:21] advent of that when he's explaining that
[45:23] to him he says well if this
[45:25] is happening this is heaven and i'm
[45:26] casting these out by the spirit of god
[45:28] that means the kingdom of god has come
[45:30] to you
[45:30] right so yes there was a tangible aspect
[45:34] of that as jesus was standing there but
[45:36] as he's saying here that kingdom that
[45:38] he's talking about was something that it
[45:40] was an
[45:40] an invisible thing right and uh anger it
[45:43] came and
[45:44] said upon them at like licks of fire
[45:46] like cloven
[45:47] tongues of fire which was a which was a
[45:51] visible evidence that you could see but
[45:54] it wasn't something that was
[45:56] uh that was a continual kingdom that you
[45:58] see that's
[45:59] all around all the time of course we've
[46:01] seen photos of
[46:02] uh of that spirit and of times where
[46:05] that has been photographed and
[46:07] you've seen it with brother branham and
[46:08] different ones and i've had other
[46:10] testimonies people say
[46:11] uh those things would be over a person
[46:14] or
[46:15] around a person or someone's preaching
[46:17] or things like that but
[46:19] it's not something that comes with
[46:20] observation it's not something to say
[46:22] hey you know let's move to tucson that's
[46:25] where the kingdom is now
[46:26] oh let's let's go to jeffersonville
[46:28] that's where the kingdom is no
[46:30] it's not at tangible places here say oh
[46:33] let's go to jerusalem
[46:34] no no it's going to be but it's not
[46:37] there now see so it's
[46:38] not with observation he says neither
[46:40] shall they say lo here or lo there for
[46:42] behold the kingdom of god
[46:44] is within you amen of god is within you
[46:47] we talked about the welsh
[46:49] revival we talked about the bride's
[46:51] revival
[46:52] well the wealth revival was just
[46:53] something that was into mary
[46:55] that was happening the second eve bride
[46:58] of jesus christ has reached that place
[47:01] of restoration although there is could
[47:04] be a last seed to come in
[47:06] could be many seeds yet to come in we
[47:08] don't know
[47:09] we know we're at the very end and we
[47:11] know there can't be that much more
[47:13] but however god wants it to be right
[47:15] right we don't know
[47:17] but we do know that that full
[47:19] restoration has happened because why
[47:22] that the the revelation of the truth of
[47:24] the mystery of god
[47:26] who christ is has taken place when that
[47:29] took place then
[47:30] brother branham had fulfilled the
[47:32] purpose god sent him for
[47:33] and god took him home now that part
[47:36] falls on us
[47:37] on our position where who we are where
[47:40] we live now and
[47:41] in in that god's kingdom amen
[47:44] god's kingdom that kingdom that has been
[47:48] made
[47:48] for the king and the queen amen praise
[47:51] the lord
[47:52] now the king and the queen are going to
[47:54] have subjects
[47:55] we know that because they'll be those
[47:57] that uh that god
[47:59] that god the bride the judges white
[48:01] throne judgment that they
[48:02] the god we put on the right hand side
[48:04] that that actually
[48:05] inherit eternal life they're not bribed
[48:08] but they make it in
[48:09] and there's those that are cast into the
[48:11] lake of fire
[48:12] but those that are that are there
[48:14] they'll be those subjects now
[48:16] that goes into a whole other subject
[48:18] revelation 21 where it talks about the
[48:20] new king the
[48:21] uh the new the new jerusalem and the the
[48:23] city that comes down which we'll read a
[48:25] little bit of later
[48:26] but uh i don't want to get into that
[48:28] much more detail about it but anyway
[48:30] it's that restoration that time now the
[48:33] king and queen rest
[48:34] restored it's time for that physical
[48:37] kingdom to come
[48:38] that physical kingdom to set itself up
[48:41] that physical king
[48:42] be a place that is a dwelling place for
[48:45] for the king and the queen
[48:47] for god and his bride for christ and his
[48:49] pride that physical place that god has
[48:52] for us
[48:53] you know brother branham talked about uh
[48:56] you know in his younger days
[48:58] he always wondered uh when we go beyond
[49:01] this
[49:01] mortal reach are we just going to be
[49:03] like clouds floating around and say oh
[49:05] hi brother dennis and
[49:07] flo bye hey brother zach
[49:10] john yen would just flow by and we're
[49:12] just like clouds or something he said no
[49:14] all right we're not like that we're
[49:16] we're bodies
[49:17] right we we have bodies they're tangible
[49:20] bodies
[49:21] right they shake hands they hug now
[49:23] there's no
[49:24] sensation like human sensation but we
[49:27] live in these
[49:28] bodies these theophanies these word
[49:30] bodies that god has created glorified
[49:32] bodies
[49:33] so it's it's tangible so if that body is
[49:36] there that we are to
[49:38] be in then there's got to be a place
[49:40] that god has prepared for us
[49:42] to live in in these bodies otherwise
[49:46] what would be the point
[49:47] right if we're just floating around and
[49:49] just like uh you know floating and
[49:51] there's
[49:51] really no rhyme reason purpose and you
[49:53] just you know then what's the point
[49:56] but if it's tangible it's going to be
[49:58] tangible to meet it
[49:59] right if the body's a tangible the place
[50:01] we're going to is tangible
[50:03] right it's physical it's something that
[50:05] we can be in that we can enjoy
[50:07] that we can be a part of right amen that
[50:10] physical part that restoration
[50:12] now in saint john
[50:19] i enjoy reading the scripture quite a
[50:21] bit there's a lot
[50:23] if you really read into
[50:27] chapter 14 beginning with the first
[50:29] verse
[50:31] a lot to this we'll try to stay focused
[50:33] on our topic today but there's
[50:34] there's a lot just in these first few
[50:36] verses even
[50:38] but uh i i think
[50:41] it's probably a good verse to read every
[50:43] day you get up
[50:46] every day you wake up chapter 14 saint
[50:48] john chapter 14 verse 1 says let not
[50:51] your heart be troubled
[50:52] when all the things that's going on in
[50:54] this country in the world today that's
[50:55] probably a
[50:56] very good slogan or a very good saying
[50:59] scripture to put on your heart and mind
[51:02] even
[51:02] something on your mirror or something to
[51:05] say let not your heart be troubled
[51:07] am i right every day because it's so
[51:09] easy to wake up and
[51:11] see all the things that's going on and
[51:12] all the trouble and all the
[51:14] you know the disturbances whatever but
[51:16] jesus said let not your heart be
[51:19] troubled praise the lord you believe in
[51:21] god believe also in me
[51:23] in my father's house are many mansions
[51:25] if it were not so i would have told you
[51:28] i go to prepare a place for
[51:31] you praise the lord jesus aren't you
[51:34] glad of that
[51:35] and if i go and prepare a place for you
[51:37] i will come again and receive you unto
[51:40] myself and where i
[51:41] am there ye may be also
[51:44] whether i go ye no and the way you know
[51:47] thomas said unto him lord we know not
[51:49] whether thou goest and how can we get
[51:52] how can we know the way jesus said unto
[51:54] him i am the way amen
[51:56] i am the truth or excuse me i am the way
[51:59] the truth
[52:00] and the life no man cometh unto the
[52:01] father but by me but now
[52:03] let's go back to that because uh
[52:07] again that that just those six verses
[52:09] has a has a lot in it
[52:11] um one of my favorite lessons in here is
[52:14] the fact that jesus is telling them
[52:16] something that they don't even
[52:18] know that they know right did you
[52:20] realize that
[52:21] yeah have you ever known that you could
[52:22] know something that you don't know you
[52:24] know
[52:26] this is something inside of the believer
[52:27] it produces something inside the bride
[52:30] that when it comes to time for you have
[52:32] a need to know you're going to know
[52:34] you may not know that you know now but
[52:36] you'll know that you know
[52:37] when the time comes and when that time
[52:40] comes you say
[52:41] praise the lord now jesus made it very
[52:43] simple for thomas and said
[52:45] well i am the way am i don't you know me
[52:49] if you know me then you know the way
[52:53] oh yeah that's true huh so simple
[52:57] but sometimes it becomes people want to
[52:59] make it more complicated than what it
[53:00] really is
[53:01] right it really isn't that complicated i
[53:03] hear people say well i've heard been
[53:05] going to church for years and i've heard
[53:06] a message preach and i've heard
[53:08] doctrines and i've heard this that the
[53:09] other and where has it gotten us
[53:11] well it better get us closer to god
[53:13] because if it's not there's something
[53:14] wrong with
[53:15] uh your version of the word because
[53:18] there's nothing wrong with the word
[53:20] and the word will not return void so if
[53:22] it's not accomplishing in you what it's
[53:23] supposed to
[53:24] then there's something wrong with you
[53:26] not the word right
[53:28] but what it's doing is it's producing
[53:30] something in us
[53:31] that we know we just may not know that
[53:34] we know right now
[53:35] we may not know it right but when you're
[53:38] faithful
[53:39] now when you read the bible and you pray
[53:41] you seek god
[53:42] you come to church you let the word
[53:44] speak to you you let
[53:46] god reveal it to you amen it becomes a
[53:48] part of you and you'll know it
[53:50] right you may not have need of it right
[53:52] at this moment
[53:53] but when you have need of it it'll be
[53:55] there
[53:56] brother branham said if you've been born
[53:58] again and have the holy ghost everything
[54:00] you need is
[54:01] in you right now amen you may not
[54:04] understand it
[54:04] may not even feel like it may not seem
[54:07] like it but it's there
[54:08] right and when you need it it'll be
[54:10] there
[54:11] when a rapture body changes when our
[54:13] loved ones begin to appear
[54:15] we'll know that'll be it you'll say well
[54:17] praise god that
[54:18] that that settled that part of it that
[54:21] ends it see
[54:22] but now let's go back uh i said it has
[54:25] a lot in these verses but let's go back
[54:27] to this in my
[54:28] second verse well let's read the first
[54:32] verse again i just love that don't you
[54:34] let not your heart be troubled i just
[54:37] wake up newton let not your heart be
[54:39] true
[54:40] amen you believe god believe also me
[54:44] in my father's house are many mansions
[54:47] now
[54:48] some of you hopefully all of you you
[54:51] understand what the scripture is saying
[54:53] through brother branham's teachings
[54:55] because in our
[54:57] now today translated english language
[55:01] this makes no sense in my father's house
[55:04] are many mansions
[55:06] well if you think about it in our
[55:10] united states current english vernacular
[55:14] it doesn't make sense it is physically
[55:16] impossible
[55:17] to put a mansion inside a house
[55:21] must list many mansions inside
[55:24] a house all right well a house can be
[55:28] 800 square foot thousand square foot how
[55:31] big is a mansion well
[55:32] in our vernacular a mansion is four or
[55:34] five thousand square foot or more
[55:36] probably probably not even probably
[55:38] bigger than that it's got to be bigger
[55:39] now to make a mansion right ten thousand
[55:41] this is a ten thousand square foot well
[55:43] how does ten thousand square foot
[55:45] many ten thousand square foot is going
[55:47] to fit in a 800 000 square foot house
[55:50] doesn't but if we see there's a couple
[55:53] places brother random talks about
[55:55] because
[55:55] he went back and studied and found out
[55:57] what the english
[55:59] understanding was at the time of the
[56:01] translation
[56:02] at the time of the king chains
[56:04] translation
[56:05] when it says in my father's house he was
[56:08] saying
[56:09] kingdom amen then
[56:12] a house was referred to as a kingdom
[56:16] right now don't get offensive but it was
[56:18] a man's domain
[56:21] he was considered the king of his domain
[56:23] and the house
[56:25] was his kingdom amen i guess it really
[56:28] could or should be the same today
[56:30] uh unfortunately the male uh gender has
[56:34] failed
[56:34] our society but anyway or most of them
[56:38] anyway right
[56:39] but the truth of it is that's what it
[56:41] used to be a kingdom was a house it was
[56:44] considered a house so when they
[56:45] translated it
[56:46] when it got down to a kingdom they
[56:49] translated it into a house
[56:51] a house is just a kingdom praise the
[56:54] lord so
[56:54] if that kingdom is now if you look at
[56:57] cinema in my father's
[56:58] kingdom or many mansions or palaces
[57:02] or places of dwelling then that makes
[57:05] much more sense
[57:06] right because god's kingdom is
[57:10] vast uh uh dares we say limitless
[57:14] god's kingdom clouds kingdom stretches
[57:16] sky the sky and
[57:17] uh north south east west up down around
[57:20] god's kingdom's everywhere so in god's
[57:23] kingdom
[57:25] are many dwelling places many palaces
[57:28] many places for his people to abide in
[57:33] so if you've got now that in my father's
[57:35] house in my father's kingdom
[57:38] are many dwelling places many palaces
[57:41] then it makes you understand in god's
[57:44] kingdom
[57:44] he has places for every one of us right
[57:47] amen brother random talked about the
[57:49] little log cabin about this dream
[57:51] right he said if you walk about you hear
[57:53] a uh
[57:55] uh you know like amazing grace or i know
[57:57] it was the blood or something like that
[57:59] i forgot exactly how brother brandon put
[58:00] it he said you know
[58:01] brother bill made it she's down there
[58:04] singing this by the grace of god or
[58:07] amazing grace or the blood of jesus
[58:09] christ or something he says you'll know
[58:10] bill made it why
[58:12] because you hear him singing and down in
[58:13] his cabin by the streets
[58:15] and i hope he doesn't mind sharing that
[58:17] cabin because that sounds awful good to
[58:18] me too actually
[58:20] being from north carolina the deserts
[58:22] are beautiful and don't get me wrong
[58:24] amen uh the the cactus will blossom like
[58:27] a rose but the
[58:28] beautiful mountain don't get me wrong i
[58:29] like that too but you know there's
[58:31] something
[58:31] just still in the heart when you grow up
[58:33] as a kid that's just still there that
[58:35] uh those the beautiful trees the
[58:37] greenery and the creek and the
[58:39] log cabin is beautiful he said you know
[58:41] bill made it
[58:42] so you think well there's got to be a
[58:44] dwelling place or a place of inhabitants
[58:47] for every one of us because remember
[58:49] again it's all tangible
[58:50] every bit of it's tangible it's it's a
[58:54] place a dwelling place we have a
[58:56] glorified body
[58:58] then we've got to have a place to to
[59:00] dwell in to live
[59:02] amen very much he says now in my
[59:04] father's
[59:05] kingdom in that kingdom now that's a
[59:08] physical kingdom
[59:09] that that's not the spiritual kingdom
[59:11] that's a physical kingdom that is
[59:13] actual place right we go to kingdom
[59:16] are many dwelling places he said if it
[59:18] were not so
[59:19] i would have told you i go and uh to
[59:23] prepare a place
[59:24] for you now you can put your name there
[59:28] i believe where everyone should put our
[59:30] names in that place
[59:32] god has gone to prepare a place for me
[59:36] right and he said if and if if it wasn't
[59:39] true i wouldn't have told you i said
[59:41] i would have told you it's not true but
[59:42] it's true i've gone to prepare that
[59:44] place now
[59:45] you can understand that scripturally
[59:47] spiritually too and say god
[59:49] has created a spiritual body for us as
[59:51] well
[59:52] that is a dwelling place too but we're
[59:55] talking about the physical
[59:56] kingdom the physical place that god's
[59:58] prepared for us to go
[1:00:00] and live in outside of this world
[1:00:03] outside of this cosmos
[1:00:04] god has created a place and prepared a
[1:00:07] place for
[1:00:08] each one of us to live he said and if i
[1:00:11] go and prepare that place
[1:00:13] which he's already done for you
[1:00:16] i will come again and receive you unto
[1:00:19] myself that where i
[1:00:21] am there ye may be also so we're not
[1:00:24] going to be in this dwelling place
[1:00:25] alone he's going to be with us right
[1:00:29] he's going to be there present as well
[1:00:32] in this kingdom in this kingdom this
[1:00:36] place
[1:00:36] where there's no sickness there's no
[1:00:39] sorrows
[1:00:40] no death we talked about last week
[1:00:42] there's no more eyeglasses there's no
[1:00:44] more gray hairs there's no more aching
[1:00:46] backs
[1:00:47] there'll never be a shovel touch to
[1:00:49] ground to dig a grave
[1:00:50] there'll never be a siren sound out for
[1:00:52] an ambulance or a fire truck or a
[1:00:54] policeman they'll never be
[1:00:56] built a hospital or or cemeteries or
[1:00:59] anything like that
[1:01:00] right it's going to be perfect whole
[1:01:03] summer
[1:01:05] how can you describe perfect there's
[1:01:07] nothing better
[1:01:09] even in the hardest times even in the
[1:01:11] lowest times
[1:01:12] it's the absolute best life that a
[1:01:14] person can live
[1:01:16] amen let me read christ's mystery god
[1:01:18] revealed if
[1:01:20] he said now if you'll just bear with me
[1:01:21] a little bit now
[1:01:23] i don't want you to miss this i've got
[1:01:25] to take
[1:01:26] uh this tape now being started this far
[1:01:30] one more great remark i want to make
[1:01:33] if i have to move over a little of it
[1:01:37] brother brown's trying to he's trying to
[1:01:39] prepare the people that he's getting
[1:01:40] ready to say something
[1:01:42] outstanding or maybe people may not
[1:01:46] understand
[1:01:47] but get them in the position to realize
[1:01:49] that
[1:01:51] this is something that come from god
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:54] now notice listen to this this is a
[1:01:56] great thing
[1:01:58] now is where we want to watch remember
[1:02:00] in the last days
[1:02:02] we'll exactly go back and vindicate the
[1:02:05] first day
[1:02:06] just like it did then it does now see
[1:02:09] adam
[1:02:10] and eve husband and wife no sin
[1:02:13] life uh then then the fall
[1:02:17] see so this end time
[1:02:20] where the restoration king and queen
[1:02:23] second adam second eve restored back
[1:02:26] will echo or bring back him to remembers
[1:02:30] what it was the first day back
[1:02:33] in time of creation where adam and eve
[1:02:36] walked
[1:02:37] upon the the ground that god had made in
[1:02:39] the garden of eden and
[1:02:41] perfection he said this day will be a
[1:02:44] res
[1:02:45] uh will be an echo or a vindication
[1:02:49] of that day see he talks about adam and
[1:02:52] eve husband and wife
[1:02:54] well what he's talking about is christ
[1:02:56] and his bride amen
[1:02:57] yes back to adam and eve course in the
[1:02:59] garden of eden but he's talking about
[1:03:01] now christ and the bride remember this
[1:03:04] seventh angel messenger
[1:03:05] was to finish that tried to go into that
[1:03:08] some as we've done in the past
[1:03:10] that's what brother brown's referring to
[1:03:12] through that ending up now through that
[1:03:14] gentile kingdom now
[1:03:16] notice lucifer in the last days is doing
[1:03:19] as he did at the first
[1:03:22] what did lucifer do the first thing that
[1:03:24] lucifer done
[1:03:26] was to separate the fellowship of god
[1:03:28] and man
[1:03:30] first thing satan did tried to
[1:03:32] accomplish
[1:03:33] actually did accomplish was to separate
[1:03:35] the fellowship between god and man
[1:03:39] he wanted to build him a united kingdom
[1:03:42] a greater splendor and seemingly more
[1:03:45] cultured a greater kingdom than michael
[1:03:49] christ had you notice how he's coupling
[1:03:52] what michael there the archangel with
[1:03:55] jesus christ
[1:03:56] amen you got it see that was the thing
[1:03:59] he was trying to get
[1:04:00] across to people you see people look at
[1:04:03] that they don't
[1:04:04] they don't realize or see that truth in
[1:04:07] the scripture
[1:04:08] and don't understand it that's why i had
[1:04:10] to take a vindicated seventh thing
[1:04:12] sabbath angel messenger prophet to come
[1:04:14] and bring that to the people
[1:04:16] bring that to us he said you got it now
[1:04:18] if you miss it raise your hands i'll do
[1:04:20] it again
[1:04:21] lucifer at the beginning his purpose in
[1:04:24] the heart
[1:04:25] isaiah 14 his purpose and heart was to
[1:04:29] achieve
[1:04:29] a brighter and greater thing in heaven
[1:04:32] than christ had is that right
[1:04:34] by seemingly a more cultured more
[1:04:37] beautiful
[1:04:38] more splendor than the kingdom of christ
[1:04:42] that's exactly what he's done right
[1:04:44] that's exactly what the world
[1:04:47] decries today oh we are so much better
[1:04:51] now
[1:04:52] than we were back then we are so much
[1:04:55] more technologically advanced
[1:04:57] we're so much more medically advanced we
[1:05:00] are so much more advanced in
[1:05:02] in every way we're better off now than
[1:05:06] we were then
[1:05:07] i'm sorry friend it was better just 50
[1:05:10] years ago than it is today
[1:05:13] it was better in the beaver cleaver days
[1:05:15] than it is now
[1:05:16] people say well they have this they have
[1:05:18] this freedom and all these things that's
[1:05:20] going on
[1:05:21] and that has made the country of the
[1:05:22] world better
[1:05:25] internet social media vehicles now
[1:05:28] all this advancement that has been
[1:05:31] through
[1:05:31] satan's kingdom god has allowed
[1:05:35] and also prospered his children to use
[1:05:39] to further the kingdom of god right
[1:05:42] because if it weren't for the airplane
[1:05:44] which is satan's device nothing
[1:05:47] offensive being the pilot that's we live
[1:05:50] in satan's kingdom right i used to drive
[1:05:52] uber i
[1:05:53] got the car and i took off and that's
[1:05:54] how i made a living right that's
[1:05:56] satan's invention satan's eden to make
[1:05:59] money for myself
[1:06:01] my family church right but uh but those
[1:06:04] airplanes satan's devices has been used
[1:06:08] for men to get on and fly in a few hours
[1:06:11] what it used to take them weeks or
[1:06:13] months
[1:06:14] to go spread the gospel right we get in
[1:06:16] automobiles and cars
[1:06:18] and can go all over the place all over
[1:06:21] the country
[1:06:22] spreading the gospel where we used to
[1:06:24] have to get on a walk walker get on a
[1:06:25] horse
[1:06:26] take days weeks months to try to do what
[1:06:29] we do in a few hours now right brother
[1:06:32] roger before us has a streaming that
[1:06:34] reaches
[1:06:35] thousands of people every week just by
[1:06:37] standing right here
[1:06:39] exactly just by a mechanical device
[1:06:41] satan's
[1:06:42] in device right to say in my
[1:06:46] opinion it is not better now than it was
[1:06:48] then
[1:06:49] it's not better now than it was 50 years
[1:06:51] ago but see that's exactly what
[1:06:54] satan has done and that's exactly what
[1:06:57] he's called
[1:06:58] right they think that we're better off
[1:07:01] now even with all the murders
[1:07:04] killings plagues sicknesses
[1:07:08] uh diseases afflictions all the things
[1:07:12] going on now
[1:07:14] how many car wrecks did you hear about
[1:07:16] 100 years ago 120 years ago
[1:07:18] how many people died in a car wreck
[1:07:21] how many how many people got a hit
[1:07:24] pregnant women
[1:07:25] killed them and their baby 120 years ago
[1:07:27] in a car
[1:07:28] didn't happen then
[1:07:33] you say it's better now i say it's not
[1:07:37] but that's what's in the minds of people
[1:07:39] right people think oh we
[1:07:41] we have a better society today and
[1:07:44] millions of people murdered around the
[1:07:46] world
[1:07:46] every day right just in just in cities
[1:07:49] like chicago and new york in l.a and
[1:07:52] you got homeless people filling up every
[1:07:54] crack and crevice of this city
[1:07:56] around the country l.a san francisco new
[1:07:59] york they're going
[1:08:00] all over the place murders
[1:08:04] killings drugs
[1:08:07] people blame the people that uh blame
[1:08:10] the ones that are making the drugs
[1:08:13] well what about the ones that are
[1:08:14] addicted to the drugs
[1:08:16] if there wasn't an appetite for the
[1:08:18] drugs there wouldn't be a
[1:08:19] a a a drug person to make the drug and
[1:08:24] to sell it
[1:08:25] right they wouldn't make the drug if
[1:08:27] there wasn't somebody to take it
[1:08:28] right they wouldn't be flooding this
[1:08:30] country with fentanyl and
[1:08:32] and cocaine and meth and everything if
[1:08:34] there weren't people addicted to it
[1:08:36] if there weren't people taking it they
[1:08:38] wouldn't come here right because it
[1:08:40] wouldn't be profitable
[1:08:42] is it better now as it was then
[1:08:45] satan's kingdom satan has set up
[1:08:49] in this world the best kingdom that he
[1:08:53] could manage
[1:08:54] he has set up the best kingdom that he
[1:08:57] could come up with
[1:08:59] the very best that satan could do he has
[1:09:03] done in this world today
[1:09:05] and yet the hearts of people
[1:09:08] i know my heart but i believe the hearts
[1:09:11] of people
[1:09:12] out in the world today the hearts of
[1:09:14] people still are yearning
[1:09:16] for that great place of utopia why do
[1:09:20] you think disneyland's so popular right
[1:09:22] it's the happiest place on earth disney
[1:09:25] world
[1:09:25] disney happiest place on earth it's the
[1:09:28] utopia that you can go to you forget all
[1:09:30] your trolls forget all the things
[1:09:32] right you know the only thing you can't
[1:09:34] forget is how much money they suck out
[1:09:36] of your bank account that's what you
[1:09:37] can't
[1:09:38] get 50 for a hot dog or something right
[1:09:41] but it's the happiest place on earth
[1:09:43] you know got to work two weeks to get by
[1:09:45] a hot dog there but it's the happiest
[1:09:47] place on earth
[1:09:49] that's their utopia right that's they've
[1:09:52] substituted
[1:09:53] and yet you talk to people if you meet
[1:09:56] people and talk to people i've done as
[1:09:57] much as i used to driving
[1:09:59] but if you talk to people and you see
[1:10:01] people people just having the heart to
[1:10:03] want a utopia
[1:10:05] you know the defund the police people
[1:10:07] want to get rid of police
[1:10:11] i do too not in this world
[1:10:14] not in this country right but i don't
[1:10:17] want police
[1:10:18] but see what it is there's something in
[1:10:20] me that says that they're not even
[1:10:21] supposed to be here
[1:10:22] well they're here because this is safety
[1:10:25] it's the best kingdom he could come up
[1:10:27] with
[1:10:27] and the place and well amen
[1:10:31] all right and people's hearts still
[1:10:33] yearning for that place
[1:10:35] people's souls still yearning for that
[1:10:38] utopia
[1:10:38] yearning for that place they they think
[1:10:41] they're happy
[1:10:43] they think they're enjoying their
[1:10:44] parties they think they're enjoying
[1:10:46] their
[1:10:46] their drunkenness and their bars and
[1:10:48] their revelry and their sports and
[1:10:50] everything
[1:10:50] they think they're enjoying all that
[1:10:52] stuff friend but it's not making them
[1:10:54] happy
[1:10:55] if it was making them happy you the best
[1:10:58] he could do
[1:11:00] leaves people wanting very much the best
[1:11:03] he can
[1:11:05] you think all the culture all the things
[1:11:07] going on today
[1:11:10] brother brahm says do you think and he
[1:11:13] says more culture
[1:11:15] more beautiful more splendor than the
[1:11:17] kingdom of christ you see
[1:11:19] and not only that you see the churches
[1:11:22] have followed suit
[1:11:23] of course followed starting by the
[1:11:26] catholic church
[1:11:28] and they're great huge buildings and
[1:11:29] they're beautiful steeples and their
[1:11:31] stained glass windows and and all you
[1:11:34] know
[1:11:35] it's that that's what they're producing
[1:11:40] it's just monetary right
[1:11:44] wood glass right it means nothing
[1:11:48] what about the place for god to dwell
[1:11:51] right
[1:11:52] your brother and says now do you think
[1:11:54] we'll have automobiles in the millennium
[1:11:57] airplanes in the millennium see what
[1:12:00] lucifer is doing now the big fancy
[1:12:03] intellectual denominations are doing the
[1:12:05] very same thing
[1:12:06] gathering themselves together to do the
[1:12:08] same thing
[1:12:10] they are gathering and denominating
[1:12:12] themselves each one
[1:12:13] trying to beat the other because you
[1:12:15] know pulling this one and pulling that
[1:12:17] one across the light
[1:12:18] here and there and come to our church we
[1:12:20] got this better in our church we got
[1:12:22] this greater come to our church we got
[1:12:24] this beautiful
[1:12:25] you know just trying to pull people
[1:12:27] around and back and forth and that's
[1:12:29] exactly what they do
[1:12:32] they're gathering denominating
[1:12:33] themselves trying to be each other
[1:12:36] trying to beat the other one and now
[1:12:38] they've got so much splendor they don't
[1:12:40] know what to do but to unite with the
[1:12:42] catholic church
[1:12:44] lucifer again building a bigger kingdom
[1:12:47] to push out listen now lucifer building
[1:12:51] a bigger kingdom
[1:12:52] to push out those that don't believe in
[1:12:56] denominations
[1:12:58] and even take their church buildings and
[1:13:01] make store rooms
[1:13:03] and the pastors of such has no rights at
[1:13:06] all
[1:13:07] right my mind all right satan's eating
[1:13:10] that's right satan's kingdom we're
[1:13:13] operating in satan's kingdom
[1:13:14] operating in satan's eden friend but our
[1:13:16] kingdom is not of this cosmos
[1:13:18] that's right and the man
[1:13:22] and a man that is a god-sent man
[1:13:25] would never stay in a denomination after
[1:13:28] he
[1:13:29] hearing or seeing this if he got enough
[1:13:32] to go and look at it
[1:13:34] certainly i don't say that critically i
[1:13:36] say that truthfully notice
[1:13:38] in the last days lucifer is doing the
[1:13:40] same thing can't you see it the devil
[1:13:42] doing the same thing
[1:13:43] building up a hybrid church a hybrid
[1:13:47] members
[1:13:48] by hybrid knowledge instead of the word
[1:13:50] by intellectual menace that are born to
[1:13:52] give men
[1:13:53] building an intellectual kingdom that
[1:13:55] will outshine christ
[1:13:56] little bitty flock you see these great
[1:14:00] big churches we passed coming in here
[1:14:03] and you see our little humble thing that
[1:14:04] we got building which we're very
[1:14:06] thankful for yeah love it
[1:14:08] god's blessed us right he will zoom
[1:14:10] right by here
[1:14:11] not thinking anything about it well
[1:14:13] there must not be much to that there's
[1:14:15] hardly anybody there
[1:14:18] jesus said fear not little flock
[1:14:21] it is your father's good pleasure to do
[1:14:23] what
[1:14:24] give you the kingdom amen give you the
[1:14:28] kingdom
[1:14:29] and there is a place in that kingdom for
[1:14:32] you
[1:14:33] there is a place in that kingdom for us
[1:14:36] that god has prepared for us
[1:14:39] amen amen out of sean christ little
[1:14:42] bitty flock he talked about fallen
[1:14:44] angels then after that but we'll skip
[1:14:46] over that part the fallen angels is
[1:14:49] that's gotten it to the place of
[1:14:51] of satan's eden satan's kingdom today
[1:14:54] but we're not a part of satan's kingdom
[1:14:57] let's go to
[1:14:58] matthew chapter 13.

[1:18:55] supper is at hand look we're starting to
[1:18:57] finish this up now
[1:18:59] the marriage supper is at hand now if i
[1:19:01] never
[1:19:02] again see you remember
[1:19:05] the marriage supper is at hand
[1:19:09] july 1963
[1:19:12] i wasn't even born yet july
[1:19:16] 1963. brother graham said
[1:19:19] the marriage supper is at hand twice
[1:19:23] he even said remember if i never see you
[1:19:25] again the marriage supper is at hand
[1:19:28] so what can we think today if he said it
[1:19:32] then back then
[1:19:32] with that with that exuberance
[1:19:37] that significance and what can we think
[1:19:39] today
[1:19:41] and then the kingdom according to the
[1:19:43] promise is ready to be issued in
[1:19:46] the great millennium the taking up of
[1:19:48] the church and the destroying of the
[1:19:50] wicked now you know that's the ushering
[1:19:52] in of that
[1:19:53] we have the rapture that takes place we
[1:19:55] go to the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:19:56] that's why brother graham said the
[1:19:58] marriage supper is at hand
[1:19:59] it's at hand because we have our loved
[1:20:01] ones appear before us minimum 30 days
[1:20:04] and then we all go to meet him in the
[1:20:06] air and then we go to the marriage up to
[1:20:08] the lamb the tribulation takes place and
[1:20:10] god destroys this place and we come into
[1:20:12] the millennium we'll walk on the ashes
[1:20:14] of the wicked
[1:20:16] in that millennium time a thousand years
[1:20:18] we spoke of
[1:20:19] remember uh now i went and looked this
[1:20:22] up again
[1:20:22] because i wanted to i wanted to get this
[1:20:24] but i didn't print it
[1:20:26] but in the questions and answer series
[1:20:27] in 1964 brother branham talks about
[1:20:31] having a mate and he says if you have
[1:20:34] the wrong
[1:20:35] mate here you will have the right one in
[1:20:38] the millennium
[1:20:39] right he said that very much if you had
[1:20:42] the wrong fate here
[1:20:43] you will have the right one there and he
[1:20:46] says
[1:20:46] all wrongs will be made right
[1:20:50] there am i speaking about the millennium
[1:20:53] i i give that to you as a quote off the
[1:20:55] top of my head a few times
[1:20:57] but i wanted to relook at that and get
[1:20:59] all wrongs
[1:21:00] questions and answer series 1964. all
[1:21:02] wrongs
[1:21:03] will be made right there
[1:21:06] what is that that's that ushering in of
[1:21:09] that time we're talking about
[1:21:10] this is not that kingdom right it is
[1:21:14] it is uh a part of that
[1:21:17] that god has set for because that's a
[1:21:20] time element of
[1:21:21] the curse of of the world being broke of
[1:21:23] the original sin as we've said
[1:21:26] but that is not the kingdom he's talking
[1:21:27] about because after that
[1:21:29] we had the second resurrection uh gog
[1:21:32] and magog
[1:21:33] and in the white throne judgment right
[1:21:36] and that's when god
[1:21:37] cast those into the lake of fire and
[1:21:40] then you have the kingdom coming and
[1:21:41] setting up
[1:21:42] now this great millennium all wrongs
[1:21:45] will be made right there
[1:21:47] praise that sounds wonderful doesn't it
[1:21:49] amen
[1:21:51] thank you lord god
[1:21:54] you ever wonder what what wrongs he's
[1:21:57] talking about
[1:21:59] now you know he's referencing getting
[1:22:01] the wrong mate but then he says all
[1:22:03] wrongs wonder what wrongs he
[1:22:05] what would be the wrongs he's referring
[1:22:06] to
[1:22:09] interesting i i've never thought of that
[1:22:11] until it just struck me
[1:22:12] and i can't say i had the answer because
[1:22:14] i'm thinking you know
[1:22:17] our our first son was born with trisomy
[1:22:19] 13 died 36 and a half hours after he was
[1:22:22] born is that a wrong
[1:22:24] was that a wrong that would be made
[1:22:25] right i think it'll be made right in the
[1:22:28] understanding that we'll all be
[1:22:30] together he won't be dead any longer my
[1:22:33] family and
[1:22:33] whatever they won't be in the grave
[1:22:35] anymore
[1:22:37] i'll be together right but
[1:22:40] but the knowledge of of such a place of
[1:22:43] perfection
[1:22:44] right can can bring into perspective
[1:22:48] how anything that would have been
[1:22:50] considered wrong here will be made right
[1:22:52] there
[1:22:53] will be right i'll praise the lord
[1:22:57] i'm so thankful
[1:23:00] and taking up the church destroying of
[1:23:02] the wicked the world sixth seal to
[1:23:04] purify by volcanic to take all the
[1:23:07] corruption and sin of the world
[1:23:09] to mold her out again and bring forth a
[1:23:11] bright new millennium for the age
[1:23:13] that is to come
[1:23:16] praise the lord when we see all these
[1:23:18] things great threefold revelation
[1:23:20] look now again great threefold
[1:23:22] revelation he's talking about
[1:23:24] god in christ christ in the church
[1:23:27] the kingdom coming amen the three things
[1:23:30] we've
[1:23:31] been on the past few months god in
[1:23:34] christ
[1:23:34] christ the church kingdom coming adam
[1:23:36] and eve redeemed
[1:23:38] back to the garden of eden to be
[1:23:41] restored
[1:23:42] according to his purpose
[1:23:45] restored king and queen
[1:23:48] adam and eve restored back to its proper
[1:23:51] place
[1:23:52] restored back into its position that
[1:23:55] it's supposed to be in as the inhabiters
[1:23:58] what do we inhabit revelation chapter 21
[1:24:06] revelation chapter 21
[1:24:13] we all surely know this scripture
[1:24:16] we get past the white throne judgment
[1:24:18] revelation 20.
[1:24:20] gog and magog and the right throne
[1:24:22] judgment those that are cast in the lake
[1:24:25] of fire
[1:24:25] satan and all of his servants
[1:24:29] cast into the lake of fire and then
[1:24:31] verse chapter 21 verse 1 and i saw a new
[1:24:34] heaven
[1:24:35] and a new earth now peter talks about it
[1:24:38] too but we're not getting
[1:24:39] to that because that's a whole nother uh
[1:24:42] future home sermon if you will uh which
[1:24:46] lord willing we may get to some time and
[1:24:48] i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[1:24:51] for the first heaven and the first earth
[1:24:53] were passed away we talked about that
[1:24:55] two-word phrase last week
[1:24:57] passed away from one form to another not
[1:25:00] annihilated
[1:25:01] but just from one form to the other and
[1:25:03] the earth and the first earth pathway
[1:25:05] and there was no more sea
[1:25:08] and i john saw the holy city the new
[1:25:11] jerusalem
[1:25:12] coming down from god out of heaven
[1:25:14] prepared as a bride
[1:25:16] adorned for her husband can you just
[1:25:19] envision
[1:25:20] what john saw now remember
[1:25:24] brother ram tells us at the spot where
[1:25:28] abraham had communion with melchizedek
[1:25:32] at the spot where jerusalem says today
[1:25:35] that our current president brought our
[1:25:38] uh
[1:25:38] made the capital of israel that spot
[1:25:42] uh in our minds
[1:25:46] god's gonna push up a pyramid-shaped
[1:25:48] mountain out of the earth
[1:25:50] amen out of the earth it's going to be
[1:25:53] an incredible
[1:25:54] thing you think well how's that going to
[1:25:55] happen well out of the mountains here
[1:25:58] the mountains here were pushed up out of
[1:25:59] the earth right but a pyramid shaped
[1:26:02] mountain will
[1:26:02] appear out of the earth and this city
[1:26:05] will come and descend down
[1:26:06] upon that pyramid as a bride adorned for
[1:26:10] her husband
[1:26:13] now that i i think he put it that way
[1:26:16] just for the simple fact that there's
[1:26:18] probably nothing more beautiful in a
[1:26:19] person's mind than a bride preparing
[1:26:22] herself
[1:26:23] for her wedding day or on her wedding
[1:26:25] day
[1:26:26] her wedding day is the day that she is
[1:26:29] to be the most beautiful
[1:26:31] feel the most beautiful look the most
[1:26:34] beautiful of her entire life
[1:26:38] amen is on her wedding day and this is a
[1:26:41] bride
[1:26:42] adorned for her husband coming forth
[1:26:46] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[1:26:48] saying behold the tabernacle of god
[1:26:50] is with man and he will dwell with them
[1:26:52] and they shall be his people and god
[1:26:54] himself shall be with them and be their
[1:26:56] god
[1:26:58] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[1:27:01] their eyes and there shall be no more
[1:27:02] death
[1:27:04] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[1:27:07] there be
[1:27:07] any more pain for the former things are
[1:27:10] passed away
[1:27:12] all of those things have been passed
[1:27:14] away and all that's been passed away
[1:27:16] then
[1:27:17] becomes new in this perfect place that
[1:27:21] god is setting up for his bride
[1:27:23] this perfect place that god said he's
[1:27:26] already gone and prepared for us
[1:27:28] this perfect place that is beyond
[1:27:30] imagination beyond
[1:27:32] thought that these tangible glorified
[1:27:35] bodies
[1:27:36] will be able to go in living and dwell
[1:27:39] be a part of one another our lives
[1:27:42] together it just it sometimes just
[1:27:47] goes beyond works it escapes us to be
[1:27:51] able to describe it
[1:27:53] and the splendor and magnificence that
[1:27:55] it is
[1:27:59] and it's hard to fathom it's hard to
[1:28:02] fathom with everything we see today
[1:28:04] right with all that's going on in this
[1:28:05] country this world today it's it's
[1:28:07] actually hard to fathom
[1:28:09] there's a place like that there's a
[1:28:11] place god's prepared
[1:28:13] he's coming to take us to that place
[1:28:16] right amen he said if i prepared it i
[1:28:19] told you i prepare it i will come and i
[1:28:21] will get you
[1:28:24] thessalonians says in the moment in the
[1:28:26] twinkling of an eye
[1:28:28] amen will be caught up to meet him in
[1:28:30] the air
[1:28:32] so shall we ever be with the lord yes
[1:28:35] christ the mystery god revealed he said
[1:28:39] but when the great ransom body through
[1:28:41] all ages come up
[1:28:43] then that's going to be a great throng
[1:28:45] there revelation 7 expresses a great
[1:28:47] number which no man the bible
[1:28:49] has revealed to them now we know that
[1:28:52] wesley had more light than luther did we
[1:28:54] know pentecost outshined wesley see
[1:28:57] certainly it does because it gradually
[1:28:59] let loose as
[1:29:00] it did down through the prophets so
[1:29:02] forth
[1:29:03] perfectly made known the godhead bodily
[1:29:06] in christ

[1:29:52] revelation of god to take
[1:29:54] eve back to her right position again
[1:29:56] with her husband
[1:29:58] and god is the husband of the church and
[1:30:00] the church
[1:30:01] is his pride look christ if you
[1:30:04] uh christ in you makes him the center of
[1:30:07] life the revelation see christ's life

[1:30:15] complete revelation of christ

[1:33:21] so as much as we can hear it much as we
[1:33:24] can preach it as much as we can read it

[1:33:30] really is going to be like amen
[1:33:32] amen i think it's going to be beyond
[1:33:35] human comprehension i believe it's going
