appreciate each one of you coming being here god's been so good to us and we stand in his uh presence and amen and another service time that the lord has given us today amen let's just stand to our feet if we could amen it's good to have this anchors with us amen god bless you amen always a pleasure privilege you're getting about that time maybe i don't know i think something may be special brought them down this week but it's getting uh the weather's starting to change a little bit so um in fact i think this week it's supposed to be down to 68 in tucson for a high that's uh i love it that's great i'm very happy about that actually myself so amen if you're not i apologize but uh for my exuberance but i'm happy for it uh especially if you're outside every day working in the heat when it gets a little cooler it's a lot nicer brother john yes amen it's a little darker quicker so you don't have as much daylight but the temperatures aren't quite as bad so amen and thankful to have sister genevieve with us amen god bless you sister appreciate you being here amen you've been in our prayers our hearts our thoughts we love you amen and the freaho family each one of you those who may be streaming god bless you amen thankful for the lord's blessings to us we have a few announcements we'll make after service today um but um let's just turn our bibles if we could now to first thessalonians chapter four we'll uh kind of pick up where we left off last time uh the lord willing so this is the rapture part 15. amen and i had a kind of a thought of the way that i was going to go today uh from a couple weeks ago of course the last couple of sundays of course we've had brother noel ministering for us and really enjoyed brother noel's ministry and brother noel's sister shirley being with us the past couple of weekends uh but a few weeks ago uh you know at my desk over here and uh but yesterday no this week sometime this week uh the lord put a message on my heart and i started listening to it brother branham and it really uh it kind of changed my fault for today so uh trust it be a blessing to you it's still along the same theme the same lines the rapture just be the rapture part 15 uh won't be probably too awful long today but uh however the lord leads i know he's here he's felt his presence here today already amen praise the lord it's so special amen sometimes i feel like i'm just going to come out of my skin amen i gotta still feel that way a little bit so the lord helped uh almost down a little so we can uh minister the word today so amen first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 before we read let's just buy our heads for another word of prayer if we could gracious lord jesus lord we're so thankful today again of your grace and your mercy and your love to us father truly god we would everyone be cast down with no hope lord no no salvation no way of even uh experiencing any of your goodness lord but god your mercy came along father and scooped us up and lord set our feet upon the path of righteousness for your name's sake and here we stand we're here today god in this little building lord in this little place father with this assembly lord and with these people expecting a believing father once again for you to speak to us from your word we're lord insufficient to the task today lord speaker and hero like god lord we couldn't even hear it father if you didn't anoint our ears to receive it god we might hear some words we might read some pages off a book but lord it takes you to come and break that bread of life fresh to us to anoint it lord and to reveal it to us and to help us to draw from it lord what you would have for us to see in it today the lord we're mortal beings we're living in this world as brother tom pray god we're living in this world and this country lord is just it's it's every bit falling apart at the seams but lord you have given us something to rise us up above and to take us beyond all the walls of the devil and all the satan's eating and all the things that are offered out here in the world god to draw close closer unto you father and to make us more like you that lord this world is not our home this world is not our hope this world is not our final uh destination god we are looking for a home lord whose builder and maker is lord this rapture is going to take these mortal flesh lord and it's going to change us and raise us up to make us lord in your image god that we can go home to be with you father and so shall we ever be with the lord thank you father for this word thank you for your spirit thank you god for this place that you've blessed us with the lord i pray that you bless each one that wasn't able to make it for whatever reason today continue to touch them and bless them and bless each one that's come father bless those who may be streaming lord we just pray that everything that we can do and say be pleasing to you we ask these blessings in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that you saw not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died it rose again even so then which also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven shout the voice of the archangel the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words you can be seated if you'd like amen rapture message of course we've now read this the 15th time because this is part 15 we read this at the beginning of each one of these segments amen and it just just grows greater and greater every time i read it and every time you look at it especially you get to that part where it says so shall we ever be with the lord amen i believe that's every one of our aspirations our goals our our aim and our purpose is to spend eternity with the lord jesus our savior our lord our god amen in this little this little blip of life that the lord give us here we're very thankful for and appreciate god's blessings to us but lord where uh but saints we're looking for the lord to take us to a place that's beyond this mortal leech no doubt we'll come back here on this earth and we'll live here after god's purified it and and uh and gotten all the sin and everything off of it and we come back and live here but uh but now that we're living in this place living in this earth we're living in this time that we're living in we can see the things that's going on around us and all the things that's happening to us and i i'll let you know right now that uh that message the lord put on hard to bring it back to this subject or this portion of this for today helps us recognize that we can see that the handwriting is on the wall amen the handwriting is on the wall today friend and that's what the lord spoke to me this week the handwriting is on the wall we can see the handwriting that's going on in in the world today and you know this handwriting is a very specific handwriting it's something that that god puts out there that god brings by revelation to those who would receive it and believe it and for that word to be revealed to them now we know that in the scripture and we'll turn over to daniel if you'd like to turn with me to daniel chapter 5 before i get too far ahead of myself that this story in daniel precipitated the the the message and the thought process of handwriting being on the wall there's something very specific about handwriting being on the wall and what it meant scripturally and and how the context came from it for us to recognize today exactly what that means now you'd look and say well there's handwriting on the wall and you know that might not mean a lot to some people but when you take it in the scriptural context we understand in that context that it has the connotation of judgment amen there's a connotation of judgment that follows the thought process of the handwriting is on the wall and when we say the handwriting is on the wall we understand that we know what we're talking about we know what is meant when we say the handwriting is on the wall is something that comes very obvious something that comes very blatant to to to those who are in the know if you are not in the know it is not obvious it is not blatant to those who are not in the know but if you are one of god's children if you are if you are a child of god you are one of the ones that is in the know that does know what is going on today and can see what that handwriting is what it means what it stands for and what we can see today that's going on not just in our country but in the world this country was supposed to be the beacon on this hillside of christianity of morals of of of of goodness of right that's what this country was founded on that's what it was built on that's what it's supposed to be it's supposed to be that that's sean out to the rest of the world that we stand as that at that pinnacle of morality of godliness of a christian nation but as it is falling down into the degradations that is satan's eden we know it is coming to the into the uh same level in the same uh thought process as the rest of the world the the the filth and and the uh the the the the sin that that is engulfed the rest of the world has taken over brother branham talked about of course the spirit of god traveling and going from country to country and and as it went from country to country each country had its opportunity at the gospel of christ each country had its opportunity at the holy spirit but as each country got that opportunity each country turned it down until it came into the west and it finally come and reached into the west coast into california and in this country and in this country turned it down we had our opportunity for him we had our chance and we turned it down and friend when you turn down god there's nothing left but judgment and when there's nothing left but judgment the handwriting is on the wall amen the handwriting is on the wall daniel chapter 5. let's read this here i want to read a fair part of this story many of you of course would know the story we're going to start with the first verse daniel chapter 5 verse 1. amen daniel chapter 5 verse 1. belshazzar the king made a great feast now as we read this think about this what's going on and we'll just say in our country today now you can talk about the rest of the world and encompass the rest of the world let's think about in the context of our country the country as brother tom had prayed the country because i i witnessed to what brother tom said there because it's it's my heart too what he what he prayed has been in my heart for for years now and and and having a heart that and i believe brother branham too did that you love this country that this country has meant a lot to me and i believe it has you too i believe it's still the best country on the earth but the perplexity of what we're going through now with knowing what's going to happen to this world to this country and yet have that still in your heart it's hard it's hard it's a it's a battle i fight almost every day i'll be honest with you almost every day i fight this battle because my heart wants to see it blessed and prosperous and wants to see it a godly nation my heart wants to see people come to christ my heart wants to see a godly man in the office my heart wants to see a government that has a heart of the people but it's gone and it will not return it is not going to return friends and when that happens there's nothing left but judgment and but it but it it it eats at your it eats at my heart it really does i hate to see it it it it it it troubles me all the time even though i know what's going on even though i know what's happening it it difficult but as we read this think about in the context of what we know is going on in our country today belshazzar the king made a great feast to the thousand of his lords and drank wine before the thousand belshazzar while he tasted the wine commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in jerusalem that the king and his princes his wives his concubines might drink therein now this and when i when i started this i said we kind of continue on with where we were a couple of weeks ago and this is kind of that part because this again uh it is the attitude or the atmosphere of a people who are living their lives as is though there is no god remember last time we spoke here uh we took from luke and we'll probably go back to that scripture again today and they they eat drank married given in marriage they build it they they planted and basically remember where we took that word where it's the people were in the position of living their lives as if though there was no god and that's the way that's the way they're at today that's the way they live today and you see this is this is a representative of that this is exactly how belshazzar is doing living his life as if though there is no god and that's the way the world is today that's the way this country is becoming living their lives as if though there is no god right then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of god which was at jerusalem and the king and his princes his wives his concubines drank in them they drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver a brass of iron of wood and of stone as if though there is no god you say well we believe in god this country says that they've had churches around the country today full of people there's been auditoriums there's been thousands and tens of thousands of people that have attended church services across this country today you say i believe in god i believe in jesus i received christ but living their lives like there isn't a god there's a big difference in saying i believe him and i know him and live your life as a representative and reflection of the word there's a big difference they say we do but they live their lives as though they don't their testimony their lives don't back up their testimony and and this this is a microcosm this is a represent a representation of of that attitude of that thought let's party and have fun remember what brother branham said the spirit of this country is frolic amen frolic just living our lives without regard of other people without regard of of a god or being pleasing to to our lord jesus living living as if though none of that mattered and that's exactly what they've got here i believe they call it today live and let live that's that's kind of the mantra i guess they have we live and let live so you can be and do whatever you want just live however you want and it's okay i'm sorry friend doesn't work that way the handwriting is on the wall fifth verse in the same hour they're having this party now in the same hour that they're having this party came forth fingers of a man's hand and rode over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote then the king's countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled him so that the joints of his lawns were loosed and his knees smote one against another rightfully so the king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers and the chaldeans and the soothsayers and the king spake and said to the wise men of babylon whosoever shall read this writing and show me the interpretation thereof shall be clothed with scarlet have a chain of gold about his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom then came in all the king's wise men but they could not read the writing nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof look now then was king belshazzar greatly troubled and his countenance was changed in him and his lords were astonished now this great writing that we know obviously came from god because it came simply in the form of a man's hand and wrote on the wall but it wrote in plain view for everybody that was there partying to be able to see it every one of them they all were privy to what was what was wrote but they could not interpret the writing they had no idea what it said they had no idea what it meant and look friend the handwriting is on the wall today but people look at it and they have no idea what's going on you cannot read the handwriting unless you are of god only god's children can read that handwriting today they see it don't tell me the world doesn't see what's going on there's people all over this country they know exactly what's going on they can see it with their eyes but they don't understand it because they have no comprehension or understanding of godly things this could not be interpreted by the world it could not be interpreted by the worldly uh uh education or soothsayers or astronomers or or educated men in fact the more they got educated the further that took them away from it you have to be educated in christ in god so as this handwriting come from the only one that's going to be able to read that handwriting that's on the wall today is god's children god's children's gentleman is going to be able to read that handwriting we're the only ones that god's children's all the ones that's going to know exactly what's going on others see there's something going on oh they were standing here at the party they saw the hand they saw the handwriting but they had no idea what it meant the people see it today they realize it but they have no idea what's going on well friend we know what's going on god is getting his children together and there's going to soon be a time where there's going to be a body change and he's going to take her home to be with him and there's going to be nothing left in this world but judgment darkness when god's children leave here friend there will be nothing left but hatred and envy and strife there'll be no anointing you know even in the dark ages even in the time and of mortament where they had to give their lives they still died with an anointing they had an anointing of god that was there with them that helped them and encouraged them and bless them but when this bride leaves friend there will be no anointing people say oh if i have to go through the tribulation you have no idea what you're talking about every bit of love every bit of peace every bit of joy every bit of goodness everybody anything that's god and good and lovely is going to be gone and there will be no holy spirit there'll be no anointing the the presence of god will be dealing with the jews gentiles will be finished amen there's i say we're at this point now really where there's just i i don't want to say there's no more because that's up to god but brother branham said 60 years ago we were in a gleaning period what does that mean oh there's just one here one here one over here one over here 60 years ago where are we at today what hour are we living in friend people say i well if i got to go through the tribulation there'll be nothing there'll be people who want to kill themselves and can't do it the bible said they'll cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall on them and hide them but there won't be any hiding place there'll be no way they can't kill themselves i think i've told you before i think that's that that's probably where this zombie stuff came from people seeing into the future into the tribulation period where men will take shotguns and try to blow their heads off and they can't die they'll be walking around with half a head you say how's that possible i don't know but the bible said they won't be able to kill themselves that's right and you and and people oh i had to go through the tribulation oh friend make sure your heart and soul is right with christ today you don't want to find yourself in that period of time amen you don't want to find yourself here when god's children are gone when god has raptured his children home and there's nothing left here in the but tribulation and judgment friend that's what this writing was this handwriting that we're talking about was the handwriting of judgment amen let's skip down and see what daniel's now the the i believe it was the wife of belshazzar said oh don't let your heart be troubled there's someone in the kingdom nebuchadnezzar named impel bells belted seizure but it's daniel and daniel is able to be able to interpret these writings so they call for daniel daniel comes now in the 20 let's start with the 22nd verse still same same chapter daniel 5 verse 22 and thou his son obel shazar hath not humbled thine heart though thou newest all this but has lifted up thyself against the lord of heaven and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee and thou and thy lords thy wives thy concubines have drank drunk wine in them and now has praised the gods of silver gold brass iron wood and stone which see not nor hear nor know the god in whose hand thy breath is and whose are all the ways has thou uh hast shall not glorified now glorified god now what is it today it's simplified today they don't go out and glorify and worship the gods of gold and silver and iron and stone they have one god today this country this world has one god today most the people who live in it have one god today and it's money most people in this world today worship money and that's all they care about that's all they want they'll get it all at all costs whatever they have to do whoever they have to cheat however they have to finagle all they want is the money and that's what they worship that's what their god is their god is money and that's how they live everybody cheats and steals and lies to get it the government just says hey let's just sign a piece of paper and we'll just fire the printers that's easy enough right we'll just get some more printers and we'll just start printing it well you know the law of supply and demand the more of something there is the less it's worth the more you print it the less it's worth amen she's bankrupt do you know friend that we are at a hundred and this country is at 125 of its gdp brother ram talked about her being bankrupt remember we are now at 125 you know what that means that means all the money that they collect and all the taxes and all the money that comes into washington dc they spend 125 percent more every year than what comes in every year that means you're bankrupt how long would you and your family last if you spent 125 percent of what you took in every year how long would you last how long would your home be able to survive that amen you might stick it on a credit card here there get a loan or something but eventually friend it's going to overcome you and you're going to be so deep in debt you'll never be able to see daylight where do you think this country is at brother branham said theo castro did the smartest thing when he when he cancelled out the money who knows friend that may be one day you'll wake up one morning and they'll say we'll give you a dime for every dollar you turn in your dollars now worthless and unless you come and give us your money we'll give you a dime for every dollar you got and just wipe it completely out where would we be see it's all about control it's all about total control and if covet has done anything in this world it's helped the p the ruling class people understand that they can dominate and control the the normal natural everyday joe me and you amen but what they don't know is they can't control us because we're only controlled by one and that's the lord amen they can't control us but they can control all the regular commoners the regular people keep under control and if you don't do this we're gonna penalize you or we're gonna find you or we're gonna throw you in jail whatever it is this is one thing has come to help them understand that they can take control over the people and that's exactly what they want to do amen this has been a democracy for a long time no more i'm afraid that it's it's it's already crossed over the handwriting's on the wall and we are the ones that can read it the others look at it and say oh well this is okay this won't hurt we'll just succumb to this and we'll just succumb to and the more and more freedoms you relinquish the more that you have no freedoms at all and what have we told you all the the people around say well the government wants to give me all this money look the more money they give you the more they own you if they can get you dependent on them giving you money then they can control you that's exactly what they did in china here not long ago you know all these people are controlling the communist country they're all controlled by the government and when they get controlled by the government then then all the government has to do is say you do what we tell you or we'll just take your money away we'll take your food away we'll take your job away we'll take any bit of livelihood from you job wait a minute if you don't get this shot we're going to take your job away sound familiar that's cause this exact same spirit amen it might be packaged in a vaccination it might be bit packaged it might be packaged in in uh in a different package but it's the same spirit control take control over you amen 22nd verse let's go back to the scripture uh well we read 22-23 24th then was the part of the hand sent from him and this writing was written and this is the writing that was written manny manny tackle euphorson that is the interpretation of the thing meaning god has numbered thy kingdom and finished it that's that's pretty judgmental amen god has numbered your kingdom and has finished it tackle thou art weighed in the balances and aren't found wanting what is the what is the declaration of this allowed to see a church age rich and increase with goods and says do you have need of nothing when you're poor miserable blind wretched naked and what don't know it amen don't know it that's because the handwriting can only be read by someone that's that that is in tune with the one who wrote it just like the scripture you can only get the revelation of the scripture if you read it in the same spirit of the author who wrote it if you could get in the same spirit of the author you could have that word be revealed to you and the same one that wrote that is the same one that put the handwriting on the wall this is a this is a handwriting of judgment this is judgment that daniel's speaking to boshes are about you are under judgment belshazzar your country is under is under judgment and this is what the handwriting says he has met your kingdom and it is finished you have been weighed in the balances by god's balance and found wanting perez thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians then commanded belshazzar and they clothed daniel with scarlet put a chain of gold in his neck and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom and that night was belshazzar the king of the chaldeans slain amen that night the man's eyes never opened to see another day because of the judgment that had fallen upon his kingdom and him personally he was slain that night what are we looking at today friend if the handwriting is on the wall today what are we expecting what are we looking at i don't know how much longer we've got friend but it can't be much longer this world can't go on the way it's going this country cannot go on the way it's going the sin has become so this this entire world system is shot everything about this country is bankrupt morally financially in every way bankrupt what else is there left how much longer can it go i don't mean to be uh discouraging others because this isn't discouraging to a child of god this is lift your head up because your redemption draw at night amen praise the lord do i love my life yes i want to see my grandchildren grow up yes my my family all of you i'm thankful to god but friend we got a whole nother place that's waiting on us amen i got a whole nother i got a whole family that's on the other side waiting it's going to be glorious amen it's going to be glorious that night belshazzar was slain and darius the median took the kingdom being about three score and two years old took over the kingdom now the important part of this too that i want to make sure and we understand is that this this handwriting was only for the for daniel to read daniel was the only one able to read it the rest could see it but only daniel could read it the rest can see what's going on but only god's children understand it amen only those that are born again have the holy ghost understand what's going on people talk about the elections and and the money problems and and all these bills are trying to pass and all the things that's going on around the country and and covet is still taking over the world but they don't understand it they can't they can't get a grasp of the realization of why it's there why this judgment this handwriting it's on the wall of judgment is striking this world is striking this country this country is the last one to go under i believe that this country when it was given all of its opportunities and given all of its blessings and god's spirit pouring out upon this country i believe is probably the biggest reason that when brother branham saw it in the vision it was burnt border to border and coast to coast this country destroyed border the border coast to coast amen destroyed brother abraham said that if he if god didn't destroy it he'd have to raise sodom and gomorrah and apologize for doing for sinking beneath the ocean he'd have to do that but the handwriting is on the wall the judgment has been set and this country this nation is under judgment but just as this nation is under judgment the people of god stand pure righteous holy as a judgment against this nation for what's going on the world could stand and say oh well everybody's like this everybody lives this way everybody acts like this everybody enjoys this music enjoys hollywood enjoys this over here and likes and gets involved in all this but the truth of it is that is not true not everybody does god's children are far removed from the things of the world remember caught up in heavenly places in christ jesus when the world around her is living like there is no god the only way that she can live is to know that there is a god and to live her lives according to the dictates of god's word so that god would be pleased with her and live in a dimension to understand that the things that are going on around her there's things that go on in this country today friend i never would have imagined there's things and i see people and how they live their lives the things they do to themselves i never would have imagined when i was a kid the only time you saw a tattoo was on a biker or or or someone considered a horrible roust about person and now you see his now there's all kinds of emblems of praying hands and crosses and christianity and stuff and i think quiet how people have been so deceived by the devil and thinking that mutilating their bodies is pleasing to god well it's a cross the lord would like that mutilate the temple of the holy ghost and that's pleasing to god obedience is better than sacrifice friend and a lot of the garbage i see is just they think they're sacrificing themselves but all they're doing is creating a a a a an image of of satanic god but where is it at today used to be that when i was a kid you'd watch a popeye or something and he'd have a little tattoo because he was a sailor you know you get in the military and you have a little thing on on arm or something now it's all over the place and of course you know you see people and they wear their clothes way up here way down here or something because they got to make sure you see it you know they they put on half clothes because you know you got to see that cross that's up their thigh bankrupt yes judgment that's the place that we live today judgment it's under a it's under a spirit of judgment only god's children are the ones that's going to be in tune with god's spirit enough to be able to read the handwriting and recognize what's going on today and what there is is left i believe that's that's probably a reason a lot of people have been leaving us lately amen yeah covert or whatever it is uh i i heard a little baby uh died the other day i forgot what it was but even sister norm i think gave a testimony of a little another little baby the other day that had died and and and people not just of cola there's been a lot of that but for for different reasons god's taking i don't know why but there's a reason behind it there's a reason why we're still here but all this is for a purpose everything is being uh everything is being orchestrated up to the place that we're coming to this time where the alive and remain group take a body change and a rapture happens but it's going to be the alive and remain group's going to be a small group friend it's going to be a small group probably wouldn't fill up joel osteen's big auditorium down there amen but but there might be one in there you don't know it might be some i i don't know i don't want to put those people out in or that's up to god amen but i know it's going to be a small group the alive and remains going to be millions over there but this live and remain group she's going to be a small group and with different ones like brother angel and ruth and all different ones that we've knows been going on that it's going to be even smaller amen because those people would have been a part of that amen now let's go over to saint luke and let me finish with this because my time's getting away but let's go over to luke 17. but i think we can all agree this this world system is shot the the world system this country is shot uh people want to look to it and and and and we keep responsibility we work and we earn money and we we live our lives and god blesses us and that's the way we should do but this system is shot world system is done it it's it it's just shot there's no way of bringing it back our government it's just there's no way of bringing it back the reason it becomes the way it is now is because the light has been shined on it and and even in the light that's being shot on it their wicked deeds are being exposed but even with their wicked deeds being exposed they don't care there has been such a a creation of apathy on the on the american people that people have become selfish and self-centered to the point that they just don't care that's right people there are some people that'll speak up in the government and say well we need to be physical responsible because these bills are going to be paid by our children grandchildren great great grandchildren but they don't care they absolutely do they might say something but they don't care because their actions speak louder than their words what they do lets us understand that they just don't care it's right here it's right now they're not worried about tomorrow they're not worried about the next generation or two and and what have they done it's just been driven straight into the ground by godless society 1956 they turned god down brother said 1957 he said they turned god down past tense the message now what is left once you turn god down the handwriting's on the wall yes amen it's getting clearer and clearer all the time if the president or his administration were to come and ask one of us i think you'd tell them what the truth is will they listen to you they'd throw you in a rubber room think he's crazy amen which is true i am crazy crazy for christ amen and by the world standards i am crazy amen saint luke 17. let's begin with verse 30. look at this one more aspect because i want to use this the lord willing to take us into the next the next week the lord willing luke 17 30. even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now we went through of course a couple weeks ago we went through the previous verses in the days of noah and the days of lot and looking at those things which we reiterated just shortly in the days but now i want to get to the rest of this i wanted to read the rest of this scripture when we were here last time but we just ran out of time so let's finish it up here in the next 10 15 minutes even though shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed in that day he which shall be upon the house top and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise uh not return back remember lot's wife in other words it is not to be the the the dog to its vomit or the sow to its wallow we're moving forward forgetting the things that are in the past we press forward to the prize of the mark of the high calling in christ we don't look back so that time comes we don't say oh but lord i got to do this and i got to do this and i got to go here and i got to get this and i got to have this and i got to make this no no no no no we live our lives right now understand we live our lives with the understanding that any second god could call us home and we leave here with no regrets with nothing undone if there's somebody that you need to make right with do it now if there's something you need to fix fix it now if there's something that needs to be that you need don't leave anything undone there's something do it now live as if though every second could be that last second that god's gonna take you home you don't worry about going down when it comes you say i'm on the roof say don't know i don't need to go down and fix this i don't need to change this this doesn't need to be made right i don't need to go get prayed up lord i am prayed up i'm ready to go take me now you're ready that's the instant in season and out of season that's the that's the moment and twinkling of an eye less than a click and you're ready to go remember lot's wife you don't look back she had so much of lot still in her heart she had so much of the world even in her heart that she just couldn't bear to leave it maybe even some friends maybe her card party maybe her uh uh her [Music] bingo games or something ladies you can hear them screaming oh that would tug at your heart wouldn't it but she turned and looked and it cursed her she turned to a pillar of salt now it's not the time to look back it's time to go forward now is that time god's calling us to a higher walk god is calling us to a higher plane godless god is calling us to live a godly holy christian filled a holy ghost filled life god is calling us to something more it's like we've said the past few weeks friend we're caught up in heavenly places when you look around and you can't understand why people want to scar their bodies like they do or put holes all in their bodies or or or listen to the kind of music or walk out on the street with a third a fourth a tenth dress i think i've used floss that's wider than some things some people wear out on the street today and you think the mental insanity that has struck a people that would actually go out into the uh to where other humans can see them looking like that presenting themselves that way i think what what can it be to cause a mind to get to the place that they're like that well no wonder they all soak themselves in alcohol every night no wonder they have to get liquored up and partied all the time because they can't handle reality they can't handle life so they got to do something because that's all they have oh friend let's get let's get uh caught up in christ amen let jesus be our portion let him be the place that we go that that lifts us up beyond all the cares of the world we don't understand why how somebody could think like that to do that why what is possessed a person's mind to think like that because they're creatures of the world they're creatures of this dimension they're creatures of satan's eden and we can't understand how somebody could think like that because we don't live in that dimension we don't live that way we don't live like those in in the same place that those people live we don't live like that i don't understand how they do that but it's not for me to understand because i don't live there i don't live in the same world these people live in we don't live in the same world we don't live in the same atmosphere these people live in remember brother adam said that we should have enough god enough faith to be able to speak another world into existence and live in it that's exactly what we do that's exactly what the bride of christ does every single day we create we speak and create another atmosphere that we live in and it's it's an atmosphere that this world doesn't know anything about they might look at you and think how crazy could a person be to look like we do and to dress like we do and to act like we do it don't go to places or don't do certain things they don't understand it but what they don't understand is that we're not creatures of this atmosphere we have spoken and created another atmosphere and that is where we live and the atmosphere we live in it doesn't have any resemblance to the things of this world and all that's going on in the world and the music and the way they dress and act and live and the stuff that interests people just the thought process of how to get from a to b in life is lost on people today i don't understand it but i'm not supposed to because i'm not i'm not in their world i don't live in their atmosphere they don't live in milwaurs we're creatures of of heaven were creatures of a different dimension remember lot's wife look now the rapture whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it i tell you in that night there shall be two men now what night there the coming of the lord the rapture this speaks of an international rapture list this the rest these last few verses these last few verses speaks of an international rapture to understand this rapture is going to be an international rapture amen we know enoch went as one man we know elijah was caught up that was one man we know jesus and the the old testament saints which will go over more at length but this rapture this last day rapture is an international rapture now look i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed one shall be taken the other left two men shall two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken the other left two men shall be in the field and the one shall be taken and the other left notice this international rapture at that time there'll be people in the bed there'll be people in the field and there'll be people in the grinding at the meal there'll be daytime in one place it'll be nighttime in the other place it's an international rapture it's worldwide so it might be daylight to us it might be dark on the other side of the world but it'll be god's children wherever they are international worldwide so in one place when they're in the bed and the rapture takes place one will go and one will stay that's predestination that just proves god's predestination two are there one's left one stays two women grinding one goes one stays predestination in the field one goes one stays daylight dark doesn't matter where it is amen brother brahman said he believed between six and nine some morning dead in christ shall rise amen on that bright and cloudless morning the dead in christ shall rise the glory of his resurrection share amen in the watches he talked about that but this scripture helps us understand that it's not just a few people it's not just our church it's not just tucson or jeffersonville or the united states it's around the world god has people all over the world amen his children and they answered and said unto him where lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is thither will the eagles be gathered amen it also tells us this in matthew chapter 24 amen i can read through this real quick we'll close here matthew 24 verse 35 heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away but if that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only we don't know the day we don't know the hour but we know the time the season amen i believe we're in the season of the coming of the lord how many believes that in that in that rapture cycle praise the lord body change it's bringing us to a place that at that moment in twinkling of an eye it's it's instantaneous like that but but all the all the foundation has is being laid has been laid to bring it to that place amen it's not just something that uh that that just all of a sudden god whips up no this has been going on for for for generations for years god has been getting his children by his word through the message to a place where it's it's changing her glory by glory is changing her she's becoming more and more in his image more and more in his likeness the last thing to change is the body that's the last thing that changes the redemption of the body the changing of the body no man knows the day of the hour not even angels of heaven my father only but as uh but as the days of no worse so shall also the son of man be for as in the days that were uh before the flood they were eating drinking mary and given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken the other left two men two women shall be grinding at the mill once shall be taken the other left watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come but leave nothing undone amen leave nothing undone always prepared always ready live our lives live our lives as if though it could happen any second but know this that if the goodman of the house had known in that and that watch in what watched the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also ready for in such an hour that ye think not the son of man cometh so then as a faithful and why uh who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his house to give them meat in due season uh blessed is that servant whom his lord look now blessed is that servant whom the lord when he cometh shall find so doing amen what's that that's being at the post of duty that's being at the that's being at the call of god in your life whatever that is whatever god's called you to do whatever god has put before you on that specific day even be found faithful at that post know that nothing that you have is left undone you're right with the lord my heart is right my soul is right i have nothing left hanging out i don't have anybody to make anything right with i don't have any sins to be repentant of i'm ready lord when you call me whatever time and moment that is even if it's even before the rapture god if you take me before then i still want to be ready i still want to be in a place where i'm ready to go whatever purpose whichever way i i want to be ready amen and be found faithful faithful to whatever god's called you to just be faithful to it you don't have to be a minister you don't have to be a song leader or be out front or be heard or seen or you don't have to be some popular or just be what god's made you that's all that matters because even though it might not seem significant it might not seem like it's important every portion of the body of christ is just as important and needful as the other that's why we stand in that place take our place amen the handwriting's on the wall friend can you see it you read it see what it's saying the lord is saying i'm coming soon and judgment is on this earth judgment is striking this country and we're in the middle of it today it's hard i told you it hurts me i hate to see it but we know it's going to happen we know it has to happen they turned god down and when you turn them down there's nothing but judgment god help us handwriting's on the wall today friend but i'm ready for a rapture you ready to go in a rapture the lord to take us let's stand if we could praise the lord the day and the hour we live we see all of it happening around us it's very obvious people don't understand it yes people don't understand you people around your life they'll never they'll never understand you people don't get it and they won't get it a lot of them won't pray they that they would yeah my heart is that they would but the fact of it is most won't and they won't understand it won't be able to comprehend because they live in a different world they live in a different dimension we're we're creatures of heaven yes god has called us from this world we're ready to go home amen whatever time god calls us be faithful to the post while we're here but whatever time it is we'll do what god calls us to do amen praise the lord jesus amen i'm so thankful that god is ever with us he's our very present help in the time of trouble knee amen amen let's sing this course number four 493. amen i want to live the way he wants me to live thank you jesus today yes lord let me live the way you want me to live make it possible because friend there's no way that we could ever please the lord but outside of the ability to be able to do it it's the only way we can do it right it's the only way we can come remotely close to being right in god's eyes it's that mercy it's that blood that brings it makes the opportunity that we can do it amen praise the lord [Music] until there's just [Music] the way he wants me to live i want to give until there's just [Music] oh [Music] amen thank you jesus at your desire today he wants us to live live our lives to be pleasing to him in every way amen praise the lord jesus [Music] amen lord richly bless you i appreciate each one coming being here today and then a couple things i want to mention to you brother pat had finished this life span of the individuals in the bible if you want one they're back uh in on the table back there i thought it's kind of interesting especially when you look at a couple the notes that brother pat put on the back here um just things that just never dawned on me you know um i'll read you the first one here says in 9 30 when adam died noah wasn't born but all the saints lived on the earth at the same time and you look at all this adam said enos all the way down i thought wow that's that's incredible to think that through that lineage all of them were all alive there at the same time anyway i i thought it was interesting but if you want a copy of it there's a few that brother pat brought her back on the table back there and then also uh remember this wednesday night will be the first mid-week service that we start uh we're gonna have wednesday night seven o'clock uh starting this wednesday night and and perpetually uh or at least that's the plan so starting this wednesday night we'll have uh we'll have church here

the police saying we need to witness we need to talk to this man and we need to interview him and find out what happened and they said there was no man in the car that's benny perry and that was sisters from his church he was the one who told me that story anyway he was at the minister's meeting this last time him and i think he said nine or ten of them uh from his church they're here in
