[23:03] much uh exercise or anything so they're
[23:05] home today watching so God bless you
[23:08] brother sister Pat

[36:50] the holy spirit that the Lord wanted me
[36:52] to start bringing this today so I just
[36:55] trusted to be a blessing to you it's God

[40:09] reveal to us this precious word we ask
[40:12] it in the precious holy lovely name of
[40:13] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
[40:18] in Saint Matthew chapter 11 1 verse
[40:21] verse 25. and at that time Jesus
[40:24] answered and said I thank the old father
[40:27] Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou
[40:29] has hid these things from the wise and
[40:32] pruned and has revealed them unto babes
[40:35] amen you can be seated if you like
[40:40] amen
[40:42] Jesus another place said unless you come
[40:44] as this little child amen can't enter
[40:47] into the Kingdom of Heaven unless you
[40:49] come as this little child I can't think
[40:50] of anything more simple than a little
[40:53] infant a little child
[40:56] someone innocent that Jesus would take
[40:58] upon his lap and make a demonstration
[41:00] out of to make an example out of to show
[41:03] that it's it really is more simple than
[41:06] most people especially today even in the
[41:09] message try to make it it's so simple a
[41:11] lot of times we Overlook it we miss it
[41:13] you know I think there's a there's
[41:16] something too and I've said this before
[41:17] I think there's something significant
[41:19] about the fact that before brother
[41:21] Branham preached the greatest series of
[41:24] messages that he ever preached in his
[41:26] ministry the seals that before he
[41:29] preached the seals he preached a message
[41:31] called God hidden and revealed in
[41:33] Simplicity but you know a lot of people
[41:36] all of us probably know that but the one
[41:38] thing that maybe we haven't uh seen that
[41:41] the Lord brought to my attention one day
[41:43] is that the next service the next sermon
[41:46] after brother random left Jeffersonville
[41:48] and the next thing I wasn't in the same
[41:51] place that he preached the seals but the
[41:53] next message that brother Branham
[41:55] preached was God in simplicity
[41:58] he bookended literally two different
[42:01] venues but he literally bookended the
[42:03] seals and the breach and and all with
[42:07] both front and back with God in
[42:09] Simplicity we can't we we can't and all
[42:12] the things that God revealed to us and
[42:15] had shown to us through that uh seal
[42:17] message and the messages and what God
[42:20] showed to us through that that we can't
[42:22] we can't negate and miss the the the
[42:25] first part the first message before that
[42:28] and the message just after that that was
[42:31] God in simplicity so it's God uh hides
[42:35] and reveals himself in Simplicity he's
[42:39] still the same God that encompasses all
[42:41] space-time and Eternity he's still the
[42:44] same God that created heaven and the
[42:46] Earth he's still the same God that made
[42:48] himself so simple and so plain and so
[42:51] little that he would come down and live
[42:53] in each one of
[42:54] that's still the same God encompasses
[42:57] all space-time and Eternity but yet come
[42:59] into a little heart like mine a little
[43:02] Heart Like Yours a soul like yours so
[43:05] that he can have preeminence in your
[43:07] life amen that's the almighty God we're
[43:09] talking about brother Brown says this
[43:11] about him I am Resurrection in life this
[43:14] is 1963 Campbellsville Kentucky
[43:18] and this obviously is after the seals I
[43:22] am the resurrection he said what a
[43:24] symbol what do we see there the same as
[43:27] we see the flower the Life Death burial
[43:29] resurrection and even God makes puts
[43:32] flowers out that the leaves turn brown
[43:35] we're about to experience that time we
[43:36] don't get maybe to experience quite as
[43:39] much here in the desert as it's starting
[43:41] to turn fall and cool with the leaves
[43:44] changing and everything going down into
[43:46] the ground the light we don't see that
[43:48] as much here but I know of course on the
[43:51] mountains or back East we uh I used to
[43:54] enjoy the fall a lot the fall weather
[43:56] and squirrel hunting time and the leaves
[43:58] started changing and brother Ram's
[44:01] talking about that great bouquet he says
[44:03] make a bouquet god making a bouquet upon
[44:06] the breast of the earth as soon as them
[44:09] flowers die the red green colors uh just
[44:12] like that there he's talking about as he
[44:15] would do as this was in November this
[44:17] afternoon he says amen we see how
[44:20] beautiful God's bouquet is now he says
[44:22] God is not complicated
[44:25] God is not complicated people sometimes
[44:29] want to make him complicated and that
[44:32] Spurs the question I'm going to finish
[44:33] the quote but that's first a question to
[44:35] me brother Adam says people sometimes
[44:38] want to make him complicated but he God
[44:42] is known in Simplicity hides in it and
[44:46] reveals himself in it we'll read a
[44:48] scripture a little bit later that I
[44:50] believe Paul encapsulates this very idea
[44:52] of the heat of the hiding and revealing
[44:55] of himself in the same mechanism
[44:58] simplicity
[45:00] but he God is known in Simplicity we
[45:03] look over the top of him trying to find
[45:06] him he's so simple makes himself that
[45:10] God makes himself that way that's what
[45:13] makes him so great what makes God so
[45:17] great is that he can make himself simple
[45:20] the question that spurs in my heart here
[45:23] or this little reading is people
[45:25] sometimes want to make him complicated
[45:28] now my question then would be why would
[45:31] anybody want to make God more
[45:34] complicated
[45:36] why would any Minister why would any
[45:39] laity why would anybody want to try to
[45:42] make God more complicated than he really
[45:45] is
[45:46] amen I think a lot of it is the fact
[45:49] that uh people in certain positions
[45:52] don't want others to find them as easily
[45:54] and know him as well as they do
[45:57] they want people to come to them because
[45:59] they have the gift and they are the one
[46:01] on the pedestal they are the pastor they
[46:04] are the prophet they are the ones that
[46:05] you're supposed to come do you're not
[46:07] supposed to know it no that's the same
[46:09] old nicolaitan's spirit that came from
[46:11] the Catholic Church you can't have the
[46:14] Bible you're not supposed to know this
[46:15] you've got to come to us to get this
[46:17] it's the same Spirit friend that hasn't
[46:19] died it's the same old devil same old
[46:22] tactics but it's the same thing that
[46:24] shows to me that why God why people
[46:26] would want to make God complicated is so
[46:28] that they can try to project the people
[46:30] that they're the only ones that can
[46:31] figure them out and you've got to listen
[46:33] to me to be able to figure it out for
[46:35] yourself well Saints I'm here to tell
[46:37] you this morning you can't number one
[46:39] figure God out and number two it's not
[46:42] just for the priests or the minister or
[46:45] the pastor he is for everybody
[46:48] peace for all of us God hides and
[46:50] reveals himself not to the pastor but to
[46:53] everybody amen he is God to all not God
[46:57] to one you don't have to come to me to
[46:59] find God in fact I discourage you from
[47:01] doing that you go straight to him how
[47:04] many times have I told you your
[47:06] relationship with Jesus Christ isn't
[47:08] with me and Jesus Christ it's not what
[47:10] brother Branham and Jesus Christ it's
[47:13] you and him alone it's you and Jesus
[47:16] Christ alone that's the only
[47:17] relationship that God expects and that
[47:19] we should have is to have direct
[47:21] communication with him and him alone
[47:24] amen that's the that that to me Rings
[47:28] true to why some people want to
[47:30] complicate him to make it other people
[47:33] hard to find him but Saints he is so
[47:35] easy to see is so easy to find how many
[47:38] times have you probably even in yourself
[47:40] said how do these people not see this
[47:44] how do these people not uh uh understand
[47:47] this amen because that's just our human
[47:50] vernacular say understand but how how
[47:53] can others not see what we see
[47:56] amen how could other churches or
[47:58] denominations or or whoever it might be
[48:02] I look at these things and I look at the
[48:04] things of God and I think how easy that
[48:06] is how how clear it is how simple it is
[48:11] I think how does the whole world not
[48:13] understand or see this right amen when I
[48:16] read it and look at it it's just like
[48:18] baptism and baptism in the name of the
[48:21] Lord Jesus Christ I'll look at the
[48:22] scripture and I think how could someone
[48:24] baptize anybody other than the name of
[48:26] the Lord Jesus Christ
[48:28] I just don't understand it it's like
[48:31] serpency I read and look at it and I
[48:33] think how can anybody not I see or
[48:37] believe that it was some kind of a fruit
[48:39] or some kind of a a
[48:41] what else they say I don't know what
[48:43] anybody says today or a different kind
[48:45] of fruit or some kind of fruit or apple
[48:47] or orange or whatever it is
[48:50] how when you look is seeing so simple
[48:52] when you look at it and think well that
[48:54] just makes perfect sense I told you guys
[48:56] the other day I was I was even witness
[48:58] to the guys that I work with and and we
[49:01] were at lunch and I was telling about
[49:03] somehow creation came up and I was
[49:06] telling about Adam and Eve and and the
[49:09] things that took place and uh the
[49:11] manager of the of our uh group looked
[49:13] over and said well that makes perfect
[49:14] sense to me
[49:16] not nice I just got this cement doesn't
[49:19] claim anything
[49:20] he
[49:21] I think his background is Catholicism
[49:23] maybe he doesn't believe in anything he
[49:25] doesn't have any kind of religious
[49:27] background as you go to church he
[49:28] doesn't claim anything he doesn't know
[49:30] the Bible but when you look at him you
[49:32] explain just in the Simplicity of what
[49:34] it is just someone who does have some
[49:36] kind of a religious covering over them
[49:38] or some kind of a haughty Spirit to say
[49:40] I already know this you can't tell me he
[49:43] didn't have that he said well that just
[49:44] makes perfect sense to me everybody said
[49:46] the guy's sitting at the table said that
[49:47] makes perfect sense amen and I look at
[49:50] things how does everybody how does
[49:52] everyone not see that yeah amen but see
[49:56] God's greatness to me now I just read
[49:59] here brother Brown said that's what
[50:01] makes him so great to me God's greatness
[50:03] is personified in the fact that he can
[50:07] make himself so simple that he can
[50:09] become so simple he can become so uh
[50:13] easy amen he hides and reveals himself
[50:16] in that Simplicity and so easy to find
[50:19] just as we said for a little child to be
[50:23] able to see Jesus we try to explain
[50:25] things so much so many times and I'm
[50:28] probably guilty of it Saints and we get
[50:30] into the depth of the word and there's
[50:32] nothing wrong with that but the common
[50:34] salvation of Jesus Christ and his word
[50:36] should be so simple that the smallest
[50:39] child should be able to understand
[50:41] amen or at least to a degree maybe not
[50:44] the smallest child but to a certain
[50:46] degree I mean if God is going to if God
[50:49] is going to bring a child to the age of
[50:51] accountability at 12 years old then a 12
[50:54] year old should be able to understand
[50:55] the common Plan of Salvation in Jesus
[50:58] Christ right amen amen he's that simple
[51:01] shouldn't be hard to find shouldn't be
[51:03] complicated and if you look at it and
[51:06] and as and and the thing that makes it
[51:09] so so common simple is the fact that God
[51:14] reveals it to you
[51:15] amen just as Jesus said I thank thee
[51:19] father
[51:19] of Heaven and Earth because you hid
[51:22] these things from the wise and prudent
[51:24] but you've revealed them unto babes now
[51:28] what is revelation I've told you many
[51:30] times Revelation is just something
[51:31] that's just lost its covering the
[51:33] covering has been pulled off of it it's
[51:35] been made manifest it's something that
[51:38] you can see in front of you amen
[51:40] if something is hid you don't know what
[51:43] it is
[51:44] but when it's 10 it's hands to the wide
[51:46] the Y is imprudent and it's hid just
[51:49] like when the the Israelites crucified
[51:52] Jesus the very Messiah that they had
[51:55] been looking for for hundreds and even
[51:57] thousands of years that very Messiah is
[52:00] the one that they uh would not accept
[52:02] and crucified why because he was hid how
[52:08] is he him he was hid because they were
[52:10] looking for him in some other way
[52:13] they had their mindset that Jesus was
[52:15] going to come like this and that Jesus
[52:18] is going to be like this and he was
[52:20] going to come down to heaven and he was
[52:21] going to Smite all those people and he
[52:23] was going to divide them out and just
[52:25] like the threshing floor but that's not
[52:28] what Jesus did that's not how God
[52:30] operates God operates in Simplicity and
[52:33] if you would just look at the Simplicity
[52:35] of God today as God reveals it to you
[52:38] amen it's easy and simple when you know
[52:42] what it is when God opens your eyes when
[52:45] God reveals it to you and pulls back to
[52:47] cover then you can look and see but it's
[52:50] hid to the wise and prudent not yet to
[52:53] those that would be that would receive
[52:55] it but to those who would disbelieve it
[52:57] God does not cast his Pro Before Swine
[53:00] amen no and he asked us not to do the
[53:04] same so those were when it's hid if the
[53:07] scripture is hit it is hid from who
[53:10] those that are lost
[53:13] amen through predestination we went
[53:15] through a whole thing of predestination
[53:17] and and that predestinated uh action of
[53:22] God proves that God in his mind already
[53:25] knew you would believe it I would
[53:27] believe it as we as we accept it from
[53:30] God God reveals it to us it becomes very
[53:33] simple
[53:34] it's no longer ahead
[53:36] if it's irritated to them that are lost
[53:38] amen
[53:40] it is not hit to those that will believe
[53:42] to those that would receive it let's go
[53:45] to First Corinthians chapter 2.
[53:48] First Corinthians chapter 2 now I've
[53:51] subtitled this the uh uh a simple God if
[53:56] you will
[53:58] [Music]
[54:00] or simply simplicity
[54:03] God in simplicity
[54:06] First Corinthians chapter 2
[54:09] verse 1. now I told you the Lord had put
[54:12] this on my heart to bring
[54:14] a couple of months ago amen so
[54:18] uh I wonder I want to
[54:21] continue with what I feel he put on my
[54:23] heart amen
[54:25] and look here
[54:27] and I brethren Paul speaking now
[54:29] Corinthians I Came To You Came not with
[54:32] Excellency of speech or of wisdom
[54:35] declaring unto you the testimony of God
[54:37] and he could have done it
[54:39] Paul's smart man Paul is a brilliant man
[54:42] learned at the feet of gamelia he's very
[54:44] smart man he could have came to them
[54:46] with great swelling words of wisdom but
[54:49] he chose not to why
[54:51] for I determined not to know anything
[54:55] among you save Jesus Christ and him
[54:58] crucified amen amen how much simpler can
[55:01] you get to that yeah amen you don't have
[55:03] to come with great swelling words of
[55:05] wisdom and put any kind of special
[55:07] vernacular on it that only a a tenth of
[55:10] a percent of the human population can
[55:12] understand amen it's for commonality
[55:16] it's for everyone it's for whosoever
[55:19] will I determined not to know anything
[55:22] among you save Christ and him crucified
[55:24] and I was with you in weakness and in
[55:26] fear and in much trembling and my speech
[55:29] am I preaching was not with enticing
[55:32] words of man wisdom but in demonstration
[55:35] of the spirit and the power now it seems
[55:37] like that's kind of the way a lot of
[55:39] churches are going today they're they're
[55:42] either going off to uh uh uh trying to
[55:46] tickle people's uh emotions with a lot
[55:50] of and there's nothing wrong with that
[55:51] of the gifts and the gifts are
[55:54] absolutely as pertinent today as they
[55:57] always have been you just like we've
[55:58] said you just see the spirit of God
[55:59] moving off the Gentile bride going to
[56:01] the Jews amen it's just it's just as
[56:04] simple as that but that doesn't negate
[56:06] the gifts of God that God has put in in
[56:08] all of our lives amen every one of us
[56:11] have a gift of some kind that that we
[56:14] can locate in the scripture but see that
[56:17] or they've gone to the other side uh to
[56:21] the intellectual side to where there has
[56:25] to be some kind of great Revelation
[56:27] every time you go to church
[56:29] every time you have a service there's
[56:31] got to be something new something
[56:33] different there's got to be some great
[56:34] something that's that's come forth in
[56:37] the past six days that was unknown to
[56:39] humanity for the past seven thousand
[56:41] years
[56:43] uh it's just it at the end and and it
[56:46] Bruins itself from the intellect not
[56:50] from the spirit and that's the scary
[56:52] part about it because you can't figure
[56:54] God out you're not going to figure God
[56:56] out the more you think you got it
[56:57] figured out the more you realize you
[56:59] have nothing figured out you don't know
[57:01] God at all amen that's the scripture so
[57:05] it it sort of even going the one way or
[57:07] the other but thank God there is there
[57:10] is a group of people internationally
[57:12] around the world many in this city by
[57:14] the grace of God that are staying on
[57:16] that Middle Road that is staying down I
[57:19] had one time I had a brother tell me
[57:21] he said uh uh uh because I I preached
[57:25] middle of the road message my whole life
[57:27] really most of my life and uh back in
[57:30] Florida and I was preaching something
[57:32] along that line of in the middle of the
[57:35] road because brother Branham talked
[57:36] about that remember I preached the
[57:38] series here several years ago where we
[57:40] have to find where scripture meets
[57:42] scripture isn't that what brother Ram
[57:44] said they said the Armenians take one
[57:46] they go way off this way the Calvinists
[57:48] they take one they go way off that way
[57:50] but he said we want to find what we're
[57:52] scripture means scripture or is that to
[57:54] me that's middle of the road amen I had
[57:57] a brother tell me in Florida one time he
[57:59] said if you stay in the middle of the
[58:00] road brother you're gonna get run over I
[58:02] said no I'm not he said how come I said
[58:04] cause we're all going the same direction
[58:06] amen
[58:08] if we're all going the same direction
[58:10] we're not going to get run over because
[58:12] we're all going the same place at the
[58:14] same time in the same way we're going
[58:16] down the same road I don't have to worry
[58:17] about oncoming traffic I don't have to
[58:20] worry about getting run over because
[58:21] we're going the same way amen but you
[58:23] see the intellectual mentality
[58:26] the mentality of you've got to have this
[58:28] greater Revelation which a lot of times
[58:30] comes from just they think they figured
[58:33] something out it's not Revelation it's
[58:36] the figuring out of something well
[58:38] Paul's basically saying the same thing
[58:40] my preaching was not with enticing words
[58:43] of man's Wisdom
[58:45] amen enticing words of man's Wisdom and
[58:48] that's what draws a lot of people
[58:50] those that may not be pure Believers or
[58:53] make Believers that that draws them
[58:56] there's something there that draws
[58:58] people see there's always see there's a
[59:00] reason each one of you are here this
[59:02] morning there's a reason you're sitting
[59:05] there watching on a screen uh there's a
[59:07] reason why different churches have
[59:10] people all over this city all over the
[59:12] state all over the world I mean there's
[59:14] different reasons there's something that
[59:15] Drew them
[59:16] and see the one thing that I want to
[59:19] under that that we understand the thing
[59:22] that draws the bride is the word that's
[59:25] what the bride is concerned about that's
[59:27] what she feasts on that's her Manna is
[59:30] the word of God
[59:31] we are led by the spirit but we Feast
[59:34] off the word and as that word comes and
[59:37] feeds us then that's the thing that
[59:39] helps us want more yeah amen
[59:43] um you know there's all of us probably
[59:45] have a certain favorite food that we
[59:47] like or a favorite restaurant whether we
[59:49] like we see the glidewells I think our
[59:51] last six meetings have been at BJ's
[59:53] because it seems like they're going when
[59:56] we're coming but uh there's certain
[59:59] places people like to go you go and a
[1:00:01] lot of times if I go to a certain place
[1:00:02] if I like a certain restaurant most of
[1:00:04] the time I get the same thing
[1:00:06] because I like that I've had it one time
[1:00:08] and I want more of it and I want to keep
[1:00:11] going back because I want more of it see
[1:00:13] that's what the draw is to the bride
[1:00:15] it's the word it's not something that's
[1:00:18] Outsider or or or or contrary or it's
[1:00:22] not something to worry about tickle the
[1:00:23] emotional the Motions it's fine it's not
[1:00:26] something to tickle the intellect oh
[1:00:27] that's fine too but it's the word in the
[1:00:30] pure Simplicity and the revelation of it
[1:00:32] that draws the bride to him
[1:00:34] that makes us want more of it to make
[1:00:37] make us want more of a more more of
[1:00:40] Christ
[1:00:41] Paul knows that
[1:00:43] my speech my preaching was not with
[1:00:45] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[1:00:48] demonstration of the spirit and of its
[1:00:50] power praise the Lord thank God for that
[1:00:54] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:00:57] wisdom of men or him himself he didn't
[1:01:01] want people looking at himself just like
[1:01:03] brother random Amen brother random how
[1:01:06] many times you hear although people in
[1:01:08] the world will be contrary to this and
[1:01:09] brother random tried his very best to
[1:01:11] keep people from looking at him amen
[1:01:14] but in the power of God that's where it
[1:01:17] lays how be it we speak wisdom among
[1:01:21] them listen now now this is the place
[1:01:23] where I believe where Paul takes both
[1:01:25] sides of this this uh this message that
[1:01:28] brother Branham brought to us God hid
[1:01:30] and revealed in Simplicity it's brought
[1:01:34] to a uh to a head here as Paul draws
[1:01:37] both of these points here in one simple
[1:01:39] a couple of verses how be it six verse
[1:01:43] now how be it we speak wisdom among them
[1:01:46] that are perfect and Perfect Isn't
[1:01:48] sinless again if he fed said many times
[1:01:50] it's the same word that Jesus used over
[1:01:52] and he said be therefore perfect he's in
[1:01:55] my Father in Heaven is it perfect it
[1:01:57] just means full age mature amen it
[1:02:00] doesn't mean perfect and sinless but be
[1:02:03] mature be grown-ups grow in Grace and
[1:02:06] become mature Christians so when that
[1:02:09] word is brought to you you receive it as
[1:02:12] a mature Christian amen be uh how be it
[1:02:15] we speak wisdom among them that are a
[1:02:17] full age are perfect yet not the wisdom
[1:02:21] of this world nor of the princes of this
[1:02:25] world that that come to not so it's not
[1:02:28] of the wisdom of the world but it's the
[1:02:31] wisdom of the word in Revelation from
[1:02:34] God amen amen to those that are of full
[1:02:37] age you made any long way you can get to
[1:02:39] a full age is through a new birth amen
[1:02:42] growing grace only comes after you've
[1:02:45] received a new birth yes amen now you
[1:02:47] can grow before that
[1:02:50] I've seen that of course obviously but
[1:02:52] your real growth comes after you've
[1:02:54] received the Holy Spirit after you've
[1:02:56] been born again you grow in Grace
[1:02:59] uh seventh verse but we speak the wisdom
[1:03:02] of God how do you speak it in a mystery
[1:03:06] in a mystery how you read Paul's
[1:03:08] writings doesn't sound that mysterious
[1:03:10] to me
[1:03:12] why
[1:03:13] because it's something that now there's
[1:03:15] things look I've said this many times
[1:03:17] there's things in the scripture there's
[1:03:19] things that brother Brown has said that
[1:03:21] that I would say doesn't make sense to
[1:03:24] me and since it's probably not the right
[1:03:26] word but I don't know what else we're to
[1:03:28] use does it make sense to me it doesn't
[1:03:30] it doesn't uh uh flow with with my where
[1:03:37] I'm at at the time just put it that way
[1:03:39] so what do I do I put it on the Shelf
[1:03:42] I'll leave it there yes and I'll wait I
[1:03:45] don't go trying to dig to search to try
[1:03:47] to figure it out that's right now that's
[1:03:49] just me I I'm not saying everybody's
[1:03:51] like this or everybody does this this is
[1:03:53] just me I'm giving you my confession I
[1:03:55] put it on the Shelf I don't go digging
[1:03:57] for any kind of something on that I just
[1:04:00] leave it there
[1:04:01] because I know that this scripture is so
[1:04:04] perfect and that message is so perfect
[1:04:06] that in there in the right time God is
[1:04:09] going to show and reveal to me exactly
[1:04:12] where this place is so I can take it off
[1:04:14] the shelf and plug it where it goes amen
[1:04:17] now that being said that doesn't mean
[1:04:21] that what Paul said is a mystery to us
[1:04:24] it just is something that God remember
[1:04:26] brother random said God will reveal to
[1:04:29] you and let made known to you what you
[1:04:31] need when you need to know it you know I
[1:04:33] said that yes
[1:04:35] when you have need of knowing it right
[1:04:37] yes raise the lord well it's not always
[1:04:39] even Minister pastor we don't separate
[1:04:42] ourselves that God would reveal to us
[1:04:44] when the time is when the time is right
[1:04:46] whenever God wants to show it remember
[1:04:49] the timing is as much as important as
[1:04:52] the as the what and the how
[1:04:55] it's the win
[1:04:56] it's the win a lot of times that we miss
[1:04:59] sometimes we get remember we talked
[1:05:01] about last week and brother bran would
[1:05:03] have a vision and he would see something
[1:05:05] and and when that that Vision struck us
[1:05:08] time to pray for that little girl and
[1:05:09] she's well amen but now this Vision
[1:05:12] happens and brother Brown I'm sitting
[1:05:14] there and he's looking but there's one
[1:05:16] thing out of place there's a hat not
[1:05:18] where it's supposed to be
[1:05:20] amen and the Hat's got to be words where
[1:05:23] it's supposed to be in brother branham's
[1:05:25] Vision or it's not a valid it's not a
[1:05:27] valid time for him to do it and he can
[1:05:30] sit there for hours on end
[1:05:32] lamenting over this sick girl
[1:05:35] but until that Vision strikes exactly
[1:05:38] like brother Branham saw it it's not
[1:05:40] going to do any good and brother Branham
[1:05:43] can't be the one to go pick the Hat up
[1:05:44] and put it where he saw it in the vision
[1:05:46] right it's got to be done somebody else
[1:05:48] some other way
[1:05:50] and if it levitates off the chair it
[1:05:53] goes on the Hat Racks whatever happened
[1:05:55] it's got to be exactly the way he saw it
[1:05:57] in its time
[1:06:00] and then he sat there for hours and
[1:06:02] hours and hours all of a sudden somebody
[1:06:04] moves the Hat there's division's perfect
[1:06:06] he goes and prays the little girl and
[1:06:08] God heals her raise her up amen this is
[1:06:11] the the win is as important as the how
[1:06:14] and the why or where it it's just as
[1:06:17] important as when it takes place amen
[1:06:20] and sometimes I have to put stuff on a
[1:06:23] Shelf
[1:06:25] thank God most of my shelf is empty
[1:06:28] there are still things there but there's
[1:06:30] a lot of things over the years that the
[1:06:31] Lord's allowed me to take off that shelf
[1:06:33] and plug in and sometimes some of the
[1:06:36] confusion hasn't come necessarily from
[1:06:38] the scripture or even from the message
[1:06:39] it's from some things that I've heard
[1:06:42] preached in my past by other ministers
[1:06:45] that I try to plug in and say now where
[1:06:47] does that fit and I look and say it just
[1:06:49] doesn't fit say Lord I got to put it
[1:06:51] over here
[1:06:52] but then when God brings it down and
[1:06:54] shows it then that's just it amen hid
[1:06:58] and revealed praise the Lord Paul said
[1:07:02] we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery
[1:07:06] even the hidden wisdom which God
[1:07:09] ordained God ordained this before the
[1:07:13] world unto our Glory he ordained it to
[1:07:17] be hid that's why he said it is hid from
[1:07:20] the wise and prudent that's why Jesus
[1:07:21] stopped in the middle of all this going
[1:07:23] on and said I thank you Lord Jesus I
[1:07:25] thank you God that you've hid these
[1:07:27] things
[1:07:28] from the wise Improvement reveal them
[1:07:31] unto babes amen amen
[1:07:34] I'm a babe praise God such as would
[1:07:37] learn so I'm not worried about anything
[1:07:39] else I'm not worried about all the
[1:07:41] things what others say even I I'll say
[1:07:46] what others preach denominations
[1:07:48] whatever I don't worry about that it's
[1:07:50] just what the Lord puts on me what the
[1:07:53] Lord reveals to me what God shows me in
[1:07:55] here that's what matters to me
[1:07:57] amen should be what matters to each one
[1:07:59] of us praise the Lord
[1:08:02] God is ordained this from the foundation
[1:08:04] of the world they speak the wisdom that
[1:08:06] they speak the wisdom of Paul the wisdom
[1:08:09] of God and a mystery a hidden Mystery
[1:08:12] that means it comes forth with a veil
[1:08:15] remember when brother Brown was getting
[1:08:17] ready to uh uh it was talking to others
[1:08:19] about the seals
[1:08:21] and they come to brother random and said
[1:08:24] brother random this has got to be God's
[1:08:26] something revealed God brings and
[1:08:28] reveals to you that's outside the
[1:08:29] scripture that some great thing in
[1:08:31] brother Graham said absolutely not
[1:08:34] what it is is something that's already
[1:08:36] in the scripture that God has to reveal
[1:08:39] remember that cover of the seals was on
[1:08:43] for brother Branham
[1:08:45] even to the point that brother Branham
[1:08:47] admits back in his younger Ministry he
[1:08:50] preached the seals incorrectly he took
[1:08:53] the book of Larson uh Larkin Larkin I
[1:08:57] believe it was the dimensions the book
[1:08:59] on Dimension he took and he preached a
[1:09:02] lot out of that book
[1:09:03] to try to preach on the seals and it's
[1:09:07] absolutely wrong and he said that he was
[1:09:10] going to preach it wrong again
[1:09:13] until the angel come and showed him
[1:09:17] praise the Lord one at a time one each
[1:09:21] day to reveal to him and as each come
[1:09:23] and the cover was taken off there it was
[1:09:26] right amen praise the Lord to allow him
[1:09:29] to be able to preach the truth of the
[1:09:32] Gospel that was hid in this scripture
[1:09:35] Reverend said it can't be outside the
[1:09:38] Scripture it has to be absolutely
[1:09:40] contained Genesis 1 to revelation 22
[1:09:42] cannot be outside the scripture
[1:09:44] something that God has kept hid for all
[1:09:47] the ages generations of time
[1:09:49] he told Daniel he told John the
[1:09:52] Revelator seal it up
[1:09:53] it's not time for it but when it came
[1:09:55] time and the cover was taken off there
[1:09:58] it was praise the Lord for him to reveal
[1:10:00] no that's it that's different for an
[1:10:03] individual I've said this before I I I'm
[1:10:07] not saying they should change it but I
[1:10:09] have a little contention with the the
[1:10:11] revelation of the Seven Seals the book
[1:10:13] should not be titled that in my opinion
[1:10:15] because it's the truth of the Seven
[1:10:18] Seals brother Branham cannot give you a
[1:10:21] revelation I cannot give you a
[1:10:24] revelation no Pastor Minister can give
[1:10:26] you a revelation if God if a revelation
[1:10:29] from the scripture comes to you it must
[1:10:31] come from God himself amen not me not
[1:10:34] you
[1:10:35] when they say the Revelation it is a
[1:10:38] revelation to brother brown but it is in
[1:10:39] Revelation to you yes amen being a
[1:10:42] revelation to brother Adam is one thing
[1:10:44] being a revelation to you is something
[1:10:46] else because it's a person remember it's
[1:10:49] a personal relationship yeah that
[1:10:51] Revelation has got to come directly from
[1:10:53] God to you yes the Revelation now the
[1:10:56] truth of the Seven Seals absolutely I
[1:10:59] believe that 100 that's absolutely the
[1:11:01] scriptural truth of the Seven Seals But
[1:11:03] as God reveals it to you then you then
[1:11:06] the cover's taken off you get it then
[1:11:08] it's it's something that God has given
[1:11:10] to you personally praise the Lord no
[1:11:13] longer hid
[1:11:14] no longer hid so when Paul says it come
[1:11:18] with the with the hidden wisdom the the
[1:11:21] the the hidden wisdom which God ordained
[1:11:24] from the glory from uh uh before the
[1:11:27] world unto our Glory then that just
[1:11:29] shows of course that it's hid to those
[1:11:32] who
[1:11:33] don't see it can't see it
[1:11:37] to those that are lost Jesus said the
[1:11:40] Bible says watch for what should I eat
[1:11:42] first
[1:11:43] which which none of the princes of this
[1:11:46] world knew for had they known it they
[1:11:49] would hop they would not have crucified
[1:11:51] the Lord Of Glory right it was hid to
[1:11:54] them right amen but and they were blood
[1:11:57] the Bible says they were blinded
[1:12:00] but again a just God maybe I should get
[1:12:04] back into that again
[1:12:06] um to to purposely
[1:12:09] blind
[1:12:11] children it's like uh it's like uh of
[1:12:16] people being blind to something
[1:12:19] um well I've said that okay
[1:12:21] I've made this analogy before all of you
[1:12:24] have all of you seen the sign that has
[1:12:26] Jesus written in it and the situations
[1:12:28] on the on the off part that's cut out
[1:12:33] is the first time you saw that now I'm
[1:12:35] not I'm this is rhetorical so not
[1:12:38] looking for an answer but the first time
[1:12:40] you saw that did you see Jesus I didn't
[1:12:44] when I saw that for the first time
[1:12:46] somebody showed it to me they said what
[1:12:48] do you see I just saw a bunch of jumble
[1:12:51] I didn't see Jesus at all but Jesus was
[1:12:54] sitting right there I just couldn't see
[1:12:56] him others around me that were
[1:12:59] encouraged me look again they could see
[1:13:01] Jesus I couldn't
[1:13:03] you understand
[1:13:04] this is the same analysis same situation
[1:13:07] I'm talking about that God reveals to us
[1:13:10] now
[1:13:12] once I kept looking at it looking at it
[1:13:15] once I finally saw Jesus in there I said
[1:13:18] I got it I see it now
[1:13:20] and every time I look at one of those
[1:13:22] cutouts the only thing I ever see
[1:13:25] anymore is Jesus
[1:13:26] I never see the inside part anymore I've
[1:13:29] tried to just look at the inside part
[1:13:31] again can't do it when I look at it now
[1:13:34] all I see is Jesus
[1:13:36] praise the Lord that's God revealing
[1:13:39] himself to you when God reveals it to
[1:13:42] you it's uncovered and you can't see it
[1:13:45] any other way
[1:13:46] if somebody the greatest Theologian on
[1:13:49] this planet come through that door and
[1:13:51] try to teach you the Trinity and baptism
[1:13:54] to follow us on the Holy Ghost what
[1:13:55] would you believe
[1:13:58] you've probably scoring that man out the
[1:14:00] door there's not a single proof there's
[1:14:02] not a scripture he can read there's not
[1:14:04] one single thing he can say to you to
[1:14:07] convince you any other than what we know
[1:14:09] to be the truth because God's revealed
[1:14:13] it to you you cannot see it any other
[1:14:15] way
[1:14:16] Amen to him it's a mystery to you it's
[1:14:21] something that God has made known to you
[1:14:23] praise the Lord and the Jews were
[1:14:26] looking at it in a certain way so much
[1:14:29] so that Jesus was hid to them
[1:14:32] they were blinded to him being the
[1:14:35] Messiah because they were looking in the
[1:14:37] wrong way
[1:14:39] they were looking at the sign and the
[1:14:41] inside parts and they weren't seeing
[1:14:43] Jesus they weren't seeing the Messiah
[1:14:46] and they were blinded to it that's why
[1:14:49] it was hit to them
[1:14:50] amen not because God purposely come down
[1:14:54] and said okay I'll Smite you with
[1:14:55] blindness I wouldn't be a just God but
[1:14:58] their eyes were blind because they were
[1:15:00] looking in the wrong way right amen they
[1:15:03] were blinded because they were looking
[1:15:05] in the wrong way they couldn't see the
[1:15:07] Messiah standing right in front of them
[1:15:10] because all they could see was the in
[1:15:11] between the letters yes
[1:15:13] amen the Saints when God reveals himself
[1:15:17] to you and all you can and you see it
[1:15:19] Jesus right there that's all you can see
[1:15:21] yes amen that's all you see then praise
[1:15:25] the Lord ninth verse
[1:15:27] but as it is written I have not seen nor
[1:15:30] ear heard neither is entered into the
[1:15:33] heart of man the things which God has
[1:15:34] prepared for them that love him but God
[1:15:37] hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit
[1:15:40] praise the Lord for the spirit searches
[1:15:43] all things yayed the Deep things of God
[1:15:45] God reveal it God makes known to us now
[1:15:49] look
[1:15:51] scripture
[1:15:52] hey let's go to Exodus there's of course
[1:15:54] many many places in the scripture
[1:15:58] that we go to but let's go to Exodus
[1:16:00] chapter 12.
[1:16:03] Exodus chapter 12
[1:16:05] we'll start with verse 21 we went
[1:16:07] through Exodus 12 a couple of times with
[1:16:09] this last series that we did uh but we
[1:16:12] did get quite this far with it because
[1:16:14] it wasn't pertaining to our subject at
[1:16:16] the time uh and now it is Exodus 12 21
[1:16:20] of course this is about the Paschal Lamb
[1:16:22] the Passover Lamb uh that that God gave
[1:16:26] them instruction through Moses Aaron to
[1:16:28] be able to sacrifice so that their
[1:16:30] household would be saved and that the
[1:16:32] firstborn and those through the blood
[1:16:34] would be saved from the death angel
[1:16:36] and all the specifics that God gave and
[1:16:39] everything had to be exactly the way God
[1:16:41] said it to be amen just like we talked
[1:16:43] about when the priest went to the holies
[1:16:45] of holies every stitch on that garment
[1:16:48] had to be exactly Perfect by God's word
[1:16:50] or or when that man stepped behind there
[1:16:52] he was dead
[1:16:55] the Rope around him and he fell dead
[1:16:57] they'd just pull him out because anybody
[1:16:59] else stepped behind there was just as
[1:17:01] dead as he was right Amanda had to be
[1:17:03] just exactly the way God said it to be
[1:17:05] amen it's the same way praise the Lord
[1:17:08] but now look at a part of that was we'll
[1:17:11] start with verse 21. I just want to read
[1:17:13] a couple of verses of this to draw my
[1:17:15] point here
[1:17:16] Exodus 12 21 then Moses called for the
[1:17:19] Elders of Israel and said unto them draw
[1:17:22] out and take you a lamb according to
[1:17:24] your families and kill the Passover and
[1:17:28] ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip
[1:17:31] it in uh in the blood that is in the
[1:17:33] Basin and strike the lentil and the two
[1:17:35] side posts with the blood that is in the
[1:17:37] in the Basin and none of you shall go
[1:17:40] out at uh out at the door of this house
[1:17:43] until the morning for the Lord will pass
[1:17:46] through will pass through to Smite the
[1:17:49] Egyptians and when he when he seeth the
[1:17:51] blood upon the lentil and on the two
[1:17:54] side posts uh the Lord will pass over
[1:17:56] the door and will not suffer the
[1:17:58] Destroyer to come in unto your houses to
[1:18:00] Smite you now look this something very
[1:18:04] simple now
[1:18:07] hissa hyssop there was is a very common
[1:18:13] simple weed that grew everywhere
[1:18:17] now I'll there's a point I want to make
[1:18:19] in this because I've heard it pre-stone
[1:18:22] before and talked about how common and
[1:18:25] simple and all that this was with the
[1:18:28] with the commonality and the Simplicity
[1:18:30] that we talk about the gospel is
[1:18:32] but I want us to understand today that
[1:18:35] the hyssop was something that was so
[1:18:38] common there wasn't anybody that
[1:18:41] couldn't go child or adult that couldn't
[1:18:44] go and grab a handful of history and
[1:18:47] bring it back home
[1:18:49] anybody could get it
[1:18:51] it was for everybody
[1:18:53] it was very it was a very common Bush
[1:18:56] that was readily available my point
[1:18:59] being God will never ask anything of you
[1:19:03] or anybody a child or or an unbeliever
[1:19:07] he'll never ask anybody anything that is
[1:19:11] unattainable through their means
[1:19:13] he never will if God asks something of
[1:19:16] you and and we'll just say even the
[1:19:19] common salvation through Jesus Christ
[1:19:23] has to be attainable to every single
[1:19:26] person or God's not a just God right it
[1:19:30] has to be readily available it has to be
[1:19:33] simple enough that a that an
[1:19:35] eight-year-old that Jesus would take on
[1:19:37] his lap that could understand
[1:19:39] believe
[1:19:40] it has to be simple enough that anybody
[1:19:44] could attain it could get to it it has
[1:19:47] to be something that that God is not
[1:19:50] going to make something so hard and so
[1:19:52] difficult and so complicated that only a
[1:19:55] handful of people can understand
[1:19:57] he's not gonna make it that way I told
[1:20:00] you before back it was kind of a big
[1:20:03] thing back in the uh early 90s late 80s
[1:20:07] early 90s go to uh uh meetings uh back
[1:20:12] when we were raising our children there
[1:20:14] was meetings all the time we me and my
[1:20:15] wife were in church almost all the time
[1:20:17] uh I was usually either at work or in a
[1:20:20] meeting sometimes we were at home but
[1:20:22] most of the time we were out we were at
[1:20:24] church or I was at work one or the other
[1:20:27] and we'd go to meetings a lot and hear a
[1:20:31] lot of different ministers and enjoyed a
[1:20:33] lot of the ministers and and but I I had
[1:20:37] a few that
[1:20:38] my wife and I part way through it would
[1:20:41] just look at each other
[1:20:43] and I just shake my head
[1:20:46] maybe I can't remember for sure it's
[1:20:48] been you're challenged an old man's mind
[1:20:50] but 35 years ago 40 years ago look and
[1:20:53] say
[1:20:57] I don't know
[1:20:58] preacher I'm sorry I still don't know
[1:21:02] but come outside the service and I and I
[1:21:05] just came on my heart I asked people say
[1:21:08] they're shouting and they're celebrating
[1:21:10] they're enjoying the the Lord and and
[1:21:12] we're spinning I said man that was a
[1:21:14] great service yeah that was a great
[1:21:16] service and what did he say I don't know
[1:21:18] but it was so good
[1:21:20] I literally had people tell me that
[1:21:24] you know trying to find maybe I there's
[1:21:27] something wrong with me
[1:21:29] maybe I need more of God or something I
[1:21:32] I'm missing a revelation something
[1:21:34] somewhere and I go outside and say yeah
[1:21:36] that was a great that was a great
[1:21:38] message what did he say I don't know but
[1:21:40] it was tremendous
[1:21:43] literally that is I know it sounds funny
[1:21:47] but that's the truth amen the people
[1:21:50] they they just were so called so caught
[1:21:54] up in the emotion and the intellect of
[1:21:56] of this deepness that they were diving
[1:21:59] and talking about it it was so confusing
[1:22:03] I thought
[1:22:04] if there's if I'm confused a minister of
[1:22:09] how do these people how are these
[1:22:12] children
[1:22:13] it just it's just lost God is not going
[1:22:17] to make it to where it's not attainable
[1:22:18] for anybody right
[1:22:20] right amen no many many people refuse it
[1:22:24] but he's not going to make it to where
[1:22:26] they couldn't get it if they wanted to
[1:22:29] it's attainable for everybody just like
[1:22:31] they hit some hyssop was there it was a
[1:22:34] common weed it was a simple weed it was
[1:22:36] all over the place anybody anytime could
[1:22:39] go get Hessa God didn't say go use this
[1:22:43] bush that you got to climb up this
[1:22:45] mountain and take a 10-day journey to
[1:22:47] come back to to try to use to put this
[1:22:49] Blood
[1:22:50] it's a specific certain no no it's just
[1:22:53] all over the place just take a bunch of
[1:22:54] it and dip it in the blood there it is
[1:22:56] it's that simple
[1:22:58] it wasn't complicated and it was
[1:23:00] something that children could understand
[1:23:01] which was important because a lot of
[1:23:04] those children in there were first born
[1:23:06] and they would have been struck with
[1:23:08] death
[1:23:09] but it was so simple that they could
[1:23:11] understand now you might say well why is
[1:23:14] God doing that well not a lot of times I
[1:23:16] can't explain that
[1:23:17] I don't know why God does the way he
[1:23:19] does a lot of times but it's not my it's
[1:23:21] not me to have to understand or explain
[1:23:23] why all I know is he does it I believe
[1:23:26] it and that's done it for me
[1:23:28] amen I just accepted because he's God he
[1:23:31] can do and say whatever he wants amen
[1:23:34] salvation deliverance and it's going to
[1:23:37] be something it is that that any common
[1:23:41] person can understand that's God hiding
[1:23:44] Amen in the wisdom of man and revealing
[1:23:47] in the wisdom of the word to those who
[1:23:50] would believe
[1:23:51] to those who would receive it
[1:23:54] he had won revealed to the other
[1:23:57] praise the Lord
[1:23:58] now I got one more scripture I want to
[1:24:00] read uh before we uh close the service
[1:24:03] today uh revelation
[1:24:06] let's go over Revelations chapter 12 for
[1:24:09] a moment
[1:24:12] amen listen this why are you going
[1:24:14] Revelation while you're going to
[1:24:16] Revelation chapter 12. let
[1:24:18] um let me read this to you
[1:24:25] they put the god hiding himself in
[1:24:28] Simplicity then revealing himself in the
[1:24:30] same this was the one in Jeffersonville
[1:24:32] not the one in Albuquerque the one that
[1:24:34] brother Branham preached after the seals
[1:24:36] he preached in Albuquerque New Mexico
[1:24:38] not Jeffersonville uh this one though
[1:24:42] however comes from the one in
[1:24:44] Jeffersonville before the seals now
[1:24:46] excuse me now they thought
[1:24:49] they thought that now this is the
[1:24:51] Simplicity of God God revealing himself
[1:24:54] in Simplicity maybe I sure read this
[1:24:56] other scripture first but
[1:24:59] uh this little cracked up child and he's
[1:25:02] talking about Jesus of course as they as
[1:25:04] the world looked Upon Jesus this as this
[1:25:07] little cracked up child any illegitimate
[1:25:10] child is kind of an odd Curious Thing
[1:25:13] anyhow and there you are and he's again
[1:25:16] he's talking about Jesus see but God and
[1:25:19] we know dear we know that's not true but
[1:25:22] that's the way the world looked upon Him
[1:25:24] amen that's what brother Rams referring
[1:25:27] to is the way the world would have
[1:25:28] looked Upon Jesus
[1:25:30] uh but God hiding himself listen God
[1:25:34] hiding himself in what was thought of
[1:25:36] the world as filth
[1:25:38] the world Christ
[1:25:40] they considered filth
[1:25:43] God hiding hid himself in that
[1:25:46] praise the Lord hiding himself in what
[1:25:49] the world called filth corruption
[1:25:51] illegitimate God hides himself in the
[1:25:54] corruption of the of a dead seed and
[1:25:57] brings forth life
[1:25:59] Corruption of a dead sea the Bible
[1:26:03] Luke chapter 2.
[1:26:06] now this is what I want to pull out of
[1:26:08] Revelation 12 today
[1:26:12] Luke 2 now 7.
[1:26:15] God hiding himself in simplicity
[1:26:18] and revealing himself
[1:26:22] Luke 2 7 and she brought forth her
[1:26:25] firstborn son and wrapped him in
[1:26:28] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[1:26:31] Manger because there was no room for
[1:26:34] them in the end now does that sound like
[1:26:37] almighty God coming to Earth to rescue
[1:26:40] all of his people
[1:26:42] because that's who he came to yeah yeah
[1:26:44] that's who he told his disciples he said
[1:26:47] you go to the he said I've been sent for
[1:26:49] the lost sheep of the House of Israel
[1:26:51] amen he told that woman called her a dog
[1:26:56] he called her a doctor and she said well
[1:26:59] at least the dogs eat the crumbs off
[1:27:00] their master's table
[1:27:02] that woman had such Faith Jesus gave she
[1:27:05] got what she wanted amen Jesus just told
[1:27:08] her you're going to go home and find
[1:27:10] your your daughter well look at this
[1:27:13] Faith he didn't pronounce her well he
[1:27:16] just said you're gonna go find her well
[1:27:17] when you get home
[1:27:19] praise the Lord amen but he made it
[1:27:22] clear he wasn't sent to the Gentile he
[1:27:25] was sent to the wall sheep of the house
[1:27:26] Israel that Jesus himself became so
[1:27:30] simple God himself so simple
[1:27:34] that he brought himself on this planet
[1:27:37] so insignificant woman in an
[1:27:41] insignificant family
[1:27:43] to be wrapped in swaddling cloths
[1:27:45] probably as brother Brown said to a
[1:27:48] cloth off the back of a sweaty old oxen
[1:27:50] that they wrapped him in and sat in
[1:27:53] there on a manure Pile in the middle of
[1:27:55] a Manger
[1:27:58] God almighty
[1:28:00] and yet we want to make it just this
[1:28:03] great no wonder the Jews missed it amen
[1:28:07] and we're looking for it in a completely
[1:28:09] different way
[1:28:10] But as God called each one they saw it
[1:28:12] just like this just like we read the
[1:28:14] other day the story the uh of the woman
[1:28:17] at the well she came up and all added
[1:28:20] this a couple of things she said I you
[1:28:23] this is the man she she went told the
[1:28:25] whole city this is the man we've been
[1:28:27] looking for amen come see him this is
[1:28:30] Jesus revealing himself a god revealing
[1:28:33] himself in such a simple way the world
[1:28:36] people can't see it it do it the same
[1:28:39] today amen
[1:28:41] look Revelation 12 verse 1.
[1:28:46] and I'll finish with this and there
[1:28:48] appeared a great wonder I just wanted to
[1:28:50] begin at the first verse so their appear
[1:28:52] there appeared a great Wonder in heaven
[1:28:55] a woman who we know is the Orthodox
[1:28:59] Church Israel a woman called with the
[1:29:03] son which basically represents the
[1:29:05] gospel church coming into existence the
[1:29:08] Sun the light because This Woman's about
[1:29:10] to give birth and she's about to give
[1:29:13] birth to God Amen
[1:29:16] the Sun and the Moon under her feet
[1:29:19] which the moon represents the Law so is
[1:29:21] she standing on the law the law is
[1:29:24] fading away the law is going away
[1:29:27] because the Son of God is about to come
[1:29:29] forth amen amen
[1:29:31] the law under her feet
[1:29:33] she's clothed with the sun now the
[1:29:35] gospel forth the Gospel Church coming
[1:29:37] forth the moon under her feet the Old
[1:29:39] Law passing away and upon her head a
[1:29:43] crown of 12 Stars which represents the
[1:29:45] Twelve Apostles of course again coming
[1:29:48] forth as Jesus comes forth on the earth
[1:29:51] it's a preparing of and a bringing forth
[1:29:54] of the Son of God Jesus Christ
[1:29:57] and she and she being with child cried
[1:30:01] travailing in birth and pained to be
[1:30:04] delivered and there appeared another
[1:30:06] Wonder in heaven and behold a great red
[1:30:09] dragon having seven heads ten horns
[1:30:12] seven crowns upon his head that's the
[1:30:14] devil we went through this earlier
[1:30:16] that's Satan the devil
[1:30:19] the great red dragon and his tail
[1:30:23] drew the third part of the stars of
[1:30:26] Heaven his preaching his ministry his
[1:30:30] message
[1:30:31] drew a third part of the Stars the
[1:30:35] angels
[1:30:36] fallen angels as brother Adam called
[1:30:39] Fallen Angels drew the third part of the
[1:30:42] stars of heaven and then cast them to
[1:30:45] the earth and the dragon stood before
[1:30:48] this woman
[1:30:49] which was ready to be delivered to
[1:30:51] devour her child as soon as it was born
[1:30:54] that Satan getting in Harry now remember
[1:30:57] this kind of goes into the next message
[1:31:00] but remember
[1:31:02] Satan will always look for someone that
[1:31:05] he can work in yeah yeah he's always
[1:31:07] continually he's got his minions out his
[1:31:11] deceived Angels out to try to do his
[1:31:15] work to find someone in any way that he
[1:31:18] could work in and work through
[1:31:19] especially people of of influence
[1:31:23] he's trying especially to get people to
[1:31:26] have any influence over another group of
[1:31:28] people or over a large group of people
[1:31:30] or something like that that's why you
[1:31:32] see in here all this stuff out in the
[1:31:34] world today
[1:31:35] amen all the great people all the all
[1:31:37] the people that they look up to sports
[1:31:39] stars and movie stars and and all these
[1:31:42] people that I think is really kind of
[1:31:44] ironic that they call the movie stars
[1:31:46] but anyway because we're talking about
[1:31:48] the stars that were deceived but movie
[1:31:51] stars and sports are all this that has
[1:31:53] influenced other other people amen you
[1:31:56] know I'm saying this this sin this
[1:31:59] degradation this this evil spirit that's
[1:32:03] gotten on people to think that things
[1:32:04] are okay the way they do them today amen
[1:32:09] that is seeing influence over other
[1:32:11] people and that's what the Satan Satan
[1:32:13] is looking continually to try to find
[1:32:15] somebody he can work in obviously here
[1:32:17] he found Herod
[1:32:19] he was able to work in and through Herod
[1:32:21] and it is working through Herod Herod
[1:32:24] made a decree that all those child two
[1:32:27] and under would be killed murdered I
[1:32:29] believe it was two and under well
[1:32:31] sometimes I get this one in the story
[1:32:32] with Moses mixed together uh
[1:32:35] to be murdered to be killed to be
[1:32:37] slaughtered amen
[1:32:40] but God
[1:32:41] told these major
[1:32:44] Amen to tell Herod because they were
[1:32:46] warned God warned them amen tell them a
[1:32:49] lie
[1:32:50] and that's basically what it was just
[1:32:53] tell them a mistruth but amen so that he
[1:32:56] would know he wouldn't be able and in no
[1:32:59] way see now as Herod was there Satan
[1:33:02] through Herod they're trying to kill
[1:33:06] Jesus the moment he's born
[1:33:08] just like it says here ready to Devour
[1:33:11] the child as soon as it was born Aaron
[1:33:13] was there to try to destroy Jesus the
[1:33:15] minute he was born
[1:33:16] amen but God again just like he does his
[1:33:20] children continue to protect and to keep
[1:33:23] Jesus all along Amen to where he was
[1:33:26] able to as you'd say slipped through the
[1:33:29] cracks through Supernatural means that
[1:33:31] we could go on and on about Magi is just
[1:33:33] part of it that God used to be able to
[1:33:36] help Jesus as again we'd say slipped
[1:33:39] through the cracks so that Hera was
[1:33:40] unable to give to him Herod could not
[1:33:43] get to him and he moved Joseph here and
[1:33:45] he moved him here and well was he from
[1:33:46] Nazareth was he from Bethlehem was he
[1:33:48] God moving them were Herod could not get
[1:33:53] to him and Herod was unable to kill him
[1:33:56] but you know here in the scripture see
[1:33:58] because remember sin did not start on
[1:34:01] the earth in the Garden of Eden
[1:34:03] no sin started in heaven right
[1:34:06] right this message right here that Satan
[1:34:09] preached we go over to uh Isaiah again
[1:34:12] we find where Satan desired to be
[1:34:15] exalted just like God
[1:34:17] to be lifted up above the stars above
[1:34:20] the heavens Amen to be like the most hot
[1:34:24] not realizing that God is going to have
[1:34:26] a children that's like him on this Earth
[1:34:30] right now
[1:34:31] amen no wonder brother Adam said that
[1:34:34] all the Adam possess God's gift to this
[1:34:36] bride he could speak he could name he
[1:34:38] could say oh praise the Lord but she
[1:34:41] does it based on the authority of God
[1:34:43] not on her will but on his will
[1:34:45] we read that last week it's according to
[1:34:48] his good pleasure not mine
[1:34:50] so he we do that have that Authority but
[1:34:53] but the power without the character is
[1:34:55] satanic
[1:34:57] but God gives it's not given the power
[1:34:59] to someone who doesn't have the
[1:35:01] character to be able to use it amen use
[1:35:03] it properly Herod is there ready to
[1:35:05] devour this child Herod through the
[1:35:08] devil through Herod is trying to take
[1:35:10] this child
[1:35:11] and you know when Satan got to Earth he
[1:35:13] found someone he could work in
[1:35:15] amen I'm bleeding into the next service
[1:35:18] again I'm sorry
[1:35:20] but he found somebody he could work in
[1:35:23] that was the serpent
[1:35:25] so the serpent could go and tell a
[1:35:27] mistruth to Eve he took everything got
[1:35:31] her to doubt the word as first thing he
[1:35:34] does thanks is to get you to doubt the
[1:35:36] word he's got to get you to doubt if
[1:35:38] there's ever any kind of an inkling of
[1:35:40] Doubt of God's word Satan can use that
[1:35:44] Satan used that doubt in Eve to get her
[1:35:48] to do what she did right
[1:35:50] amen done the same here he found Herod
[1:35:53] and he was going to use Herod to kill
[1:35:56] Jesus as soon as he was born
[1:35:57] [Music]
[1:35:59] but she brought forth a manshaw who is
[1:36:02] to rule all nations with a rod of iron
[1:36:04] now if you don't have any doubt that
[1:36:05] that was Jesus this tells it the only
[1:36:08] one scripturally who we know the rule
[1:36:11] with the rod of iron
[1:36:13] and her child was called up unto God
[1:36:15] into his throne and the woman fled
[1:36:18] let me just read through this again I'll
[1:36:20] be done and the woman fled Into the
[1:36:23] Wilderness where she had a place
[1:36:24] prepared of God that they should feed
[1:36:27] her there a thousand two hundred and
[1:36:29] three score day now you know that's
[1:36:31] three and a half years amen
[1:36:34] typing perfectly back over to revelation
[1:36:37] 11.
[1:36:38] it's beautiful but I'm going to move on
[1:36:41] gets into the 70 weeks of Daniel as well
[1:36:44] and there was a war in heaven Michael
[1:36:46] and his angels fought against the dragon
[1:36:48] and the dragonfall in his angels and
[1:36:51] prevailed not neither was there found
[1:36:52] Place anymore in heaven
[1:36:55] a place found any more in heaven and the
[1:36:58] Great Dragon was cast out the old
[1:37:00] serpent called the devil and Satan would
[1:37:03] deceive it the whole world he was cast
[1:37:05] out into the Earth and his angels were
[1:37:07] cast out with him and I heard a loud
[1:37:10] voice sing in heaven now has come
[1:37:12] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[1:37:14] of God and and the power of His Christ
[1:37:17] for the accuser of our Brothers cast
[1:37:19] down which accused him before our God
[1:37:21] day and night they do the exact same
[1:37:23] thing today Saints and they overcame him
[1:37:27] praise the Lord which is
[1:37:31] it overcome him by the blood of the lamb
[1:37:35] and by the word of their testimony and
[1:37:38] they loved not their lives unto the Dead
[1:37:41] praise the Lord how to be overcome him
[1:37:43] today that's that exact same way
[1:37:47] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[1:37:49] of Our Testimony I have overcome that's
[1:37:52] why it's so very important that we watch
[1:37:54] what we say and we watch what we talk
[1:37:57] about amen have obviously a lot of that
[1:38:00] and those of you who have read my book
[1:38:04] the words that we State say how powerful
[1:38:07] they are
[1:38:08] amen that's why we always try to stay as
[1:38:10] positive speak as positive amen
[1:38:15] now God is simply now this is the god in
[1:38:18] Simplicity in Albuquerque
[1:38:20] this
[1:38:22] God makes you act funny even if you look
[1:38:26] like a Weathervane standing on the top
[1:38:29] of a building
[1:38:30] but as long as it's God doing it why
[1:38:33] it's all right what difference does it
[1:38:35] make
[1:38:36] it might take some of the well he says
[1:38:39] it Baptist Theological training out of
[1:38:41] you but as long as God is doing it he
[1:38:44] reveals himself in simplicity
[1:38:47] that preacher knows more about
[1:38:50] uh that preacher know more about God
[1:38:54] coming off the top of that house than
[1:38:56] learning all the years he went to school
[1:38:59] amen God reveals himself in Simplicity
[1:39:02] and shows himself in power hiding
[1:39:05] himself then showing himself the same
[1:39:08] mechanism
[1:39:10] want to see how simple you can get
[1:39:14] not how smart you can get but how simple
[1:39:17] you can get amen amen one more go away
[1:39:21] Jesus the Bible said just before the
[1:39:23] Andalusian destruction
[1:39:24] Jesus said so will it be in the coming
[1:39:26] of the son of man as it was in the days
[1:39:28] of Noah there were giants in the earth
[1:39:30] they were giants great statue of men and
[1:39:33] today there is intellectual Giants but
[1:39:36] it's all say I didn't come with great
[1:39:38] swelling words of man's Wisdom there is
[1:39:41] men who are old Great Men great powerful
[1:39:43] men they know they know the Greek just
[1:39:46] like in the Hebrew and everything can
[1:39:48] set it all together so intellectual but
[1:39:51] where is that Revival
[1:39:53] where is the god that's burning on the
[1:39:55] heart of the human being
[1:39:57] not how intellectual it is it takes
[1:40:01] Simplicity to bring the power of God
[1:40:03] Amen humility
[1:40:07] amen the power of God is in humility
[1:40:11] yeah us the revelation of God is in
[1:40:14] humility God's Not Looking for the smart
[1:40:17] the haughty the the educated he's
[1:40:20] looking for those that are the simple
[1:40:22] not that you can't have an education
[1:40:24] obviously there's nothing wrong with
[1:40:25] that amen but if your education takes
[1:40:27] you further away from God then you ditch
[1:40:29] that education and you take God yes amen
[1:40:32] that's where the problem comes in but
[1:40:34] God is still revealing himself to his
[1:40:37] people brother Brown said he'll be
[1:40:39] revealing things to us down through
[1:40:41] eternity so how could we even begin to
[1:40:43] think that we know everything now right
[1:40:44] amen amen there's no way to know
[1:40:47] what bring the god
[1:40:48] the god truth
[1:40:50] to the Next Generation if the generation
[1:40:52] is coming if there is one uh that's up
[1:40:56] to the Lord I was going to say I hope
[1:40:57] there isn't but that's up to him amen
[1:40:59] whatever his will is that that's what we
[1:41:02] all want is the will of the Lord then
[1:41:04] he's still going to continue to hide
[1:41:06] himself and reveal himself in Simplicity
[1:41:08] in the same Simplicity that he's always
[1:41:11] done amen amen God does it for us to be
[1:41:15] able to see and thank God he doesn't
[1:41:16] because friend I'd be out a long time
[1:41:18] ago if I had to be some great intellect
[1:41:20] to be able to see it I had to be some
[1:41:22] great intellect to be able to preach
[1:41:23] this word I'd be long gone I'd have been
[1:41:25] gone years ago amen thank God it doesn't
[1:41:28] take that amen faith believing trusting
[1:41:33] God revealing living believing that word
[1:41:37] God continues to reveal it because it's
[1:41:39] still simple today as he's always been
[1:41:40] yes amen praise the Lord let's stand if
[1:41:43] we could
[1:41:51] it's the same way God always does
[1:41:57] to bring back what I said earlier is the
[1:41:59] reason that
[1:42:00] so many people can't see it today
[1:42:04] amen it's hid and revealed I look at it
[1:42:07] and I see the reveal part I thank God
[1:42:09] that God reveals it but it's also the
[1:42:12] hid part
[1:42:13] God doesn't just reveal it but he hides
[1:42:15] it too
[1:42:16] amen and in that Simplicity is where God
[1:42:19] shows it and reveals it to us
[1:42:22] amen I'm so thankful he does just
[1:42:25] something is simple
[1:42:28] as as the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:42:32] the blood of Jesus Christ that people
[1:42:34] even look on I've even heard in the
[1:42:36] message friends I
[1:42:38] I hate to say it that way but it's just
[1:42:39] truth that people try to do away with
[1:42:41] the blood
[1:42:42] I think how could you the very
[1:42:45] fundamental Foundation of our belief
[1:42:48] and and the blood that Jesus shed for us
[1:42:51] for this for our salvation for the
[1:42:53] Forgiveness of sins amen the stripes he
[1:42:56] took for our healing that people could
[1:42:58] do away with that
[1:42:59] oh
[1:43:01] amen I I'm I'm thankful that through
[1:43:04] that simple Act
[1:43:05] amen that God that we talked about for
[1:43:08] several weeks God showed us in Genesis
[1:43:12] amen Genesis 3 21.
[1:43:15] when he's when he took the Lambs and he
[1:43:17] slew them threw them in the
[1:43:19] same thing God's showing us
[1:43:22] it was the blood of an innocent one
[1:43:25] it's so simple people don't want to
[1:43:27] receive it
[1:43:28] there was
[1:43:30] I was talking with a couple guys that
[1:43:31] worked last week and
[1:43:34] and and this thing came up about about I
[1:43:37] don't know wasn't really Cults but just
[1:43:38] this the crazy things that people
[1:43:41] believe today and the crazy things like
[1:43:44] religion-ish type things that people
[1:43:46] hold on to
[1:43:47] and and I just looked and I said why
[1:43:51] why would someone
[1:43:54] what is so great about this that they
[1:43:56] would cling to instead of something as
[1:43:58] so simple as believing Jesus Christ
[1:44:01] and they looked and agreed with me and
[1:44:04] said I I said I don't understand it
[1:44:07] either one guy said yeah just believing
[1:44:09] in Christ and accepting Jesus as your
[1:44:11] savior I said exactly right and again
[1:44:13] these are people look these are men that
[1:44:16] don't even go to church that I know of
[1:44:18] now what I'm I told you the ones quit
[1:44:20] drinking I told you I was talking about
[1:44:22] his head the other day he wants to get
[1:44:24] back in church now but
[1:44:26] um
[1:44:27] it just when I look at it it baffles me
[1:44:30] why everyone would want to believe
[1:44:32] anything all this other stuff out here
[1:44:34] in the world today they're so quick to
[1:44:36] grab a hold and believe crystals and
[1:44:37] whatever I don't want to point one out
[1:44:39] but and and and negate the Simplicity of
[1:44:43] just Jesus Christ and his blood amen
[1:44:46] amen I think it's just sometimes I think
[1:44:49] it's just too simple for some people to
[1:44:51] receive right to believe they think it's
[1:44:54] just got to be something greater or more
[1:44:56] higher revelated something it's got to
[1:44:59] be something else that people
[1:45:01] um
[1:45:02] won't believe
[1:45:03] amen but it is just that simple Saints
[1:45:07] and again I'm glad it's that simple
[1:45:10] praise the Lord let's sing This Little
[1:45:11] Chorus before we go today 4 24 so glad

[1:47:56] much to offer Saints but I'm so glad I
[1:47:58] belong to him yes amen the world may not
[1:48:02] know it but what God has to offer
[1:48:05] is far beyond anything that the devil
[1:48:09] could even try to offer
[1:48:11] amen
[1:48:12] praise the Lord Jesus so thankful for
[1:48:15] that so thankfully he's made it so
