[10:16] So, let's just bow our heads, Lord
[10:18] Jesus. Very thankful today, Father, of
[10:21] your grace and mercy to us, Lord. You've
[10:22] given us another day. You've woke us up,
[10:25] Lord, and give us health and strength
[10:27] and life and the ability to come into
[10:28] this place once again, trusting you,
[10:31] Lord, for all things, Father, for you
[10:33] are the giver of every good gift. Yes.
[10:35] We thank you, Lord, for this beautiful
[10:37] day, Lord, for the time to come and
[10:38] fellowship around your precious word.
[10:41] Expecting you to meet with us once
[10:42] again, Lord, as you always do, as you
[10:44] promised in your word that you would do.
[10:46] You have never failed, Father, because
[10:48] you cannot fail. Yes, Lord. We know that
[10:51] you will not fail us here today, God.

[10:59] with those who weren't able to make it
[11:00] for some reason. Lord would just lift
[11:03] them up before you, Father, in prayer as
[11:04] well. And just pray, God, you'd take
[11:06] complete full control over this service.

[11:24] unto yourself. We rebuke every demonic

[11:29] infiltrate this service in any way that
[11:32] you get the glory, honor, and praise for
[11:34] all that is said and done. Lord, we
[11:36] recognize we're nothing without you, but

[22:28] the lovely one. Oh, how that Lord Jesus
[22:31] is coming plainer and planer, more in
[22:33] view every day as God reveals himself to
[22:36] us. As God reveals that word to us, as
[22:39] God lifts us up and puts us in heavenly
[22:42] places in Christ Jesus. It's coming more
[22:45] and more plain to us. Saints, we look at
[22:47] the world and it's going in the complete
[22:49] opposite direction as hard as it can go.
[22:51] Yes. How we are living in that day of
[22:54] manifesting time. Praise the Lord.

[23:07] manifesting
[23:09] time. Everything will come to its
[23:12] fruition in this day. Amen. Praise the
[23:14] Lord Jesus.
[23:16] Amen. We have a few prayer requests to
[23:18] bring to your
[23:21] attention.
[23:24] Amen. I found out uh
[23:27] yesterday um through our conference call
[23:30] with my team that uh our team manager's
[23:33] wife uh has
[23:36] cancer. Um my team manager's name is
[23:39] Brian. I don't I'm sure I've probably
[23:41] mentioned him before, but uh he is our
[23:43] manager, but his wife She's about 10
[23:45] years older than he's about my age. He's
[23:48] about six years younger than he's
[23:50] actually closer to Sony's age really.
[23:52] But um uh his wife is about 10 years
[23:56] about 10 years older than him. She's
[23:57] around 70. But they found out this week
[24:00] that she has lung cancer and it is in
[24:03] her lymph nodes. Uh she was in the
[24:05] hospital. He's not going to be with us
[24:07] here at the job this week. He's staying
[24:09] home to be with her. She's in the
[24:11] hospital. but uh found out her name is
[24:14] Lannne uh that she has cancer. So,
[24:16] please appreciate your prayers for her
[24:18] for her. Uh God's perfect will in this
[24:21] situation. Um I don't uh I don't know uh
[24:27] I know that Brian's family was
[24:31] Catholic to a degree. Um I know brother
[24:35] Ram talked about Mormons and Mormons
[24:38] that didn't like practice Mormonism. be
[24:41] called Jack Mormons. So, I guess they're
[24:42] more or less Jack Christians or
[24:44] Catholics if that I don't that's
[24:47] probably not a term, but uh anyway,
[24:49] they're they're Catholics, but don't uh
[24:51] but I'm not sure about her. Uh so, u
[24:55] I've met her several times. She's come
[24:57] to eat with us. We've gone to uh work on
[24:59] a job up in Minneapolis. So, uh but uh
[25:02] she's a nice lady. She's been very nice
[25:04] to me. U but I appreciate your prayers
[25:08] for her and for him. uh and um they have
[25:12] family in that area and u uh
[25:15] grandchildren. So uh sure appreciate
[25:17] your prayers. I know I know in the
[25:19] experience with my sister um she had
[25:22] breast cancer and they thought they got
[25:24] it all but she was doing good and then
[25:26] they found out it was in her lymph nodes
[25:28] and when it's in the lymph nodes it goes
[25:30] throughout the body, right? Uh it just
[25:32] the lymph nodes are like a filter or
[25:34] whatever and it just if it goes to one
[25:38] usually if they find it in one they find
[25:39] it in all of them and it could be in the
[25:42] lung but that lymph node will go to the
[25:44] liver or whatever and that's what
[25:46] happened to my sister but um God is more
[25:49] than able that so just trust and believe
[25:53] in that situation for Brian and Lan and
[25:56] his wife if you would please pray for
[25:58] them. Also got a text from sister Julie.
[26:01] Uh she's had a persistent cough and just
[26:04] had a hard time getting rid of. She
[26:05] didn't want to come to church today. Be
[26:07] disruptive in church. So please pray for
[26:09] her. Also, she asked to pray for um her
[26:12] sister Kristen, niece Maggie. They're um
[26:15] I guess having the same issues. So
[26:18] please pray for them if you would as
[26:20] well. So Julie and u Kristen and Maggie,
[26:23] if you'd remember them in prayer. Uh
[26:26] also, as you see, Mike is not with us.
[26:28] He's out of town today. So, uh, please
[26:30] pray for him if you would. Uh, I got a
[26:33] text from Shria shortly before church
[26:35] that her they're upstairs neighbors kept
[26:38] them up all night. Uh, she said dancing
[26:41] around or something. I don't know what
[26:42] it is, but we have had upstairs
[26:45] neighbors in apartments before, and I
[26:47] understand and know how that feels. Um,
[26:51] but uh, please pray for them if you
[26:52] would. Sometimes downstairs neighbors
[26:54] aren't even better, but please remember
[26:57] them. if you would. They're going to
[26:59] just try to get some rest. He said they
[27:01] might try to stream with us today. So
[27:03] hopefully uh it looks like it's working,
[27:05] so that should be good. Amen. So please
[27:07] remember them in prayer. Also uh got a
[27:10] very heartfelt thank this morning. Uh
[27:13] her sister-in-law was doing much better.
[27:16] Uh I'll just go ahead and read it as
[27:18] sister Norma sent it. She said, "My
[27:19] sister-in-law felt the prayers and
[27:22] stopped shaking. uh she will let uh let
[27:26] the Lord handle what is coming next uh
[27:28] next week concerning her and the house.
[27:30] So, please remember that. Wanted to make
[27:32] sure and let the church everyone know uh
[27:35] that lifted up prayers for her. Thank
[27:37] you for those prayers uh that the Lord
[27:40] was mindful and heard the prayers and
[27:42] blessed her. So, we're very thankful for
[27:44] that. Amen. So, please remember uh
[27:47] Sister Lydia not here. Pat's of course
[27:50] with us, not with us today. Please
[27:52] remember as well. Amen. Lord is mindful
[27:56] of us all. Good to see you as join.
[27:58] Amen. Glad to have you with us today.
[28:01] Unspoken request on your heart. Does
[28:04] anyone else have anything before we go
[28:05] to the Lord in pray?
[28:10] Oh, Sonia's longtime client who was my
[28:13] client to start with. Uh Kay is moving
[28:16] to California next week. So, please
[28:19] remember her in prayer.
[28:22] She
[28:23] hasn't fine.
[28:27] She's getting medical.
[28:31] Yes. I will say is as all the flying
[28:34] I've done, the airports, every airport
[28:36] I've gone into, the airports have been
[28:38] very very good about transporting people
[28:41] uh from from place to place. So, I'm
[28:44] sure she's in good hands there. But
[28:45] please remember Kay in prayer. Um Lord,
[28:48] just help her. Uh she's sad that she
[28:52] won't have a Sonia there in California
[28:55] and she doesn't know what she's going to
[28:56] do without Sonia. So please remember her
[29:00] in prayer. Said just get there and uh
[29:03] she won't find another Sonia. I know
[29:06] that for absolute sure, but maybe she
[29:08] can find a adequate substitute maybe
[29:11] when she gets there. Uh but please
[29:14] remember her in prayer. My wife has
[29:16] grown quite fond of her and as I've said
[29:18] Kay has grown quite fond of Sonia so
[29:21] please remember her in prayer. Her
[29:23] family lives in California so they'll be
[29:25] there uh with the family. So appreciate
[29:28] your prayers for that. Let's all stand
[29:31] if we
[29:34] could. Just ask brother Dennis brother
[29:36] if you would please.
[29:38] Lord Jesus it's a honor once again to be
[29:42] in your house. Yes Lord. know that your
[29:45] presence is with us. You are welcome,
[29:48] Father. Yes, we want you to take the
[29:51] preeminence, take control of this
[29:53] service. Thank you, God. It's not time
[29:55] to be discouraged. It's time to take
[29:58] courage and stay with the word and do
[30:01] what you have called us to do to be uh
[30:04] real Christians written epistles read
[30:07] and known of all men. Oh Lord, I
[30:11] remember when Solomon had built the
[30:13] temple, you had David wanted to do it so
[30:17] badly, but he had just so many problems
[30:20] that you told him that out of his loins
[30:24] uh there'll be one that come and build
[30:26] the temple and it was Solomon. Amen. And
[30:29] father, you told him these words. My
[30:33] people who are called by my name, Amen.
[30:36] will humble themselves, will pray, will
[30:41] uh turn from their wicked ways. Yes,
[30:43] God. I will hear from
[30:46] heaven. I will uh I will answer their
[30:52] prayers. I will heal their lands. Yes.
[30:55] And Lord, that same promise is given to
[30:58] us. We must stay with that word. Thank
[31:02] you, Lord. not look to who's doing what,
[31:05] but we must have an individual
[31:08] experience with you, Father. Amen. You
[31:11] said work out your own salvation with
[31:14] fear and trembling. And Lord, it might
[31:17] not seem that there's many that are want
[31:21] to come to church. There's some that
[31:24] don't think it's important to pray and
[31:28] read your word or to pay their tithe.
[31:32] Lord, it's
[31:34] not people that are example. It's you.
[31:37] Your word is our our example and all
[31:40] that we must do. Yes, Lord. Oh, Father,
[31:43] there are several that are sick this
[31:47] morning. These are our precious brethren
[31:50] that we love so much. And Lord, they're
[31:53] dealing with sickness. Sister Julie and
[31:56] the family, they're dealing with a
[31:59] cough. and Father and our our other
[32:05] brethren that have been sick, our the
[32:08] Pats who who just are just old in age
[32:12] and just don't have the energy and the
[32:15] stamina to to do things that they they
[32:18] desire. And then
[32:21] Father, Brother Newton's boss, uh, Lord
[32:26] Brian's wife, his wife Lanne. Lord,
[32:30] she's dealing with cancer.
[32:32] Lord, we don't know she's saved. That's
[32:36] above all. And Brian, it's time that
[32:39] people give their hearts to you while
[32:42] you're still dealing with your Gentile
[32:45] bride. while we believe your blood is
[32:48] still on the mercy seat. And father, we
[32:51] believe the uh deliverance for Lan and
[32:56] above all that somehow our pastor being
[33:00] a godly man that he'll be a witness just
[33:05] alone to our his life being a written
[33:09] epistle, a walking Bible that they'll
[33:12] turn to him and ask, "What can I do to
[33:15] be saved?" Thank you, Father. And Lord,
[33:18] thank you, Lord. We you said in your
[33:20] word if you abide in me and my words
[33:24] abide in you ask what you will and I'll
[33:27] give it unto you. Amen. Whatever if two
[33:30] shall agree on anything I'll give you
[33:33] desires of your heart. Thank you Jesus.
[33:35] If we believe total deliverance a
[33:37] healing touch you are our great
[33:39] physician a high priest that can be
[33:42] touched by the feelings of our
[33:44] infirmities. Amen. and with by your
[33:47] stripes we are healed. That's your
[33:48] promise. We hold on to it, Father. Amen.
[33:52] We're born in conquerors in the name of
[33:54] Jesus Christ. Thank you, Jesus. Oh Lord,
[33:57] we are your advocates. We are your
[34:00] vessels that you want to work through.
[34:03] Use us, Father. Satan has no hold on us.
[34:07] We rebuke you, Satan, in the name of
[34:10] Jesus Christ. You have no hold on God's
[34:13] people. Thank you, Jesus. And Lord,
[34:15] bless our pastor and to bring forth your
[34:18] word. Let our hearts be soft and hungry
[34:23] to receive the bread of life this
[34:26] morning. Granted, Lord, in your name we
[34:28] pray, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[34:32] Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You
[34:34] can be seated if you'd
[34:36] like. Praise the Lord
[34:41] Jesus. Amen. Psalm number
[34:45] 579. Amen. We'll have it on the screen
[34:47] here for you. 579. It's only the chorus
[34:50] in the book anyway. You want to sing the
[34:52] verses? Just any day now. Praise the
[34:55] Lord. My our Lord is coming. Just any
[34:57] day now. Praise the Lord. Amen. I
[35:01] believe that. Don't you?
[35:04] Praise the Lord Jesus. I believe that
[35:06] with all my heart.
[35:08] Amen. Looking forward to that time.
[35:13] Just any day
[35:17] now, our Lord is
[35:20] [Music]
[35:21] coming. He'll be
[35:25] returning for you and me.
[35:31] Oh, I've been
[35:34] watching and I've been
[35:39] waiting. Just any day
[35:43] now. His face I'll see.
[35:49] Each time I stop and take the time to
[35:54] look around
[35:57] me, I see the signs of his
[36:02] appearing.
[36:04] [Music]
[36:05] Everywhere. The things he said would
[36:09] come to pass are now before us.
[36:16] And I feel a strange
[36:20] excitement in the
[36:23] air. Just any day
[36:28] now, our Lord is
[36:33] coming. He'll be
[36:37] returning for you and me.
[36:43] For I've been
[36:46] watching and I've been
[36:51] waiting. Just any day
[36:55] now. His face I'll
[37:00] see. Oh, there's this longing in my
[37:05] heart. For his
[37:07] [Music]
[37:09] appearing, I'll gladly leave behind
[37:13] these
[37:14] trials here
[37:18] below. For this
[37:21] journey has been long and I'm so
[37:27] wey. But Lord, somehow I feel I'm so
[37:32] much closer home.
[37:37] Just any day
[37:41] now, our Lord is
[37:46] coming. He'll be
[37:50] returning for you and me.
[37:56] For I've been
[37:59] watching and I've been
[38:04] waiting. Just any day
[38:08] now. His face I'll
[38:13] see. Just any day
[38:17] now. Our Lord is coming.
[38:22] He'll be
[38:26] returning for you and
[38:30] me. For I've been
[38:35] watching and I've been
[38:39] waiting. Just any day
[38:44] now. His face I'll see.
[38:49] Just any day
[38:53] now his face I'll see.
[38:58] Oh hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Can't
[39:02] you just imagine it, saints? Amen. You
[39:04] ever thought about that day? You ever
[39:06] thought about that time in your mind to
[39:08] imagine what it just might be like?
[39:11] Amen. What it just might be like to
[39:14] recognize and see him on that day. Oh, I
[39:17] visualized it so many times. So many
[39:20] different songs have put me in that
[39:22] place, in that position. And so many
[39:24] times my mind just wonders to go to that
[39:27] place, to imagine what it's going to be
[39:29] like. And still yet in my humanity, I
[39:32] probably don't even come close to what
[39:35] it is actually going to be like. But
[39:37] just to think about it, just to imagine
[39:40] it just just sends my heart a flutter.
[39:43] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[39:46] for praise the Lord. I'm so looking
[39:47] forward to that. Amen. Amen. Glory to
[39:50] God. Not just to leave this old wretched
[39:53] world, but to be with my Lord Jesus, my
[39:56] Lord and Savior. Amen. So many times we
[39:59] try with everything we have in us to
[40:01] praise him, to worship him, to serve
[40:04] him, to give him everything that we
[40:05] have. And yet it seems so
[40:07] inadequate. Amen. And it seems so
[40:09] inadequate what we can do, what we can
[40:12] offer him in this life, what we can give
[40:14] him with our strength, with our voice,
[40:16] with our heart, with our uh uh strength
[40:19] to lift up to him. It just seems so
[40:22] inadequate. Go out in the world with all
[40:24] that we have, all that we've got to give
[40:26] our lives into his hands. It just still
[40:28] seems with every every move. Amen. Amen.
[40:32] That it just seems so inadequate for for
[40:35] who he is and what he's done for us.
[40:38] Amen. But I believe he accepts it. Amen.
[40:42] Praise the Lord. And we give it to him
[40:44] freely. Amen. All that we are, all that
[40:46] we could ever be, we give to him freely.
[40:49] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. Glory
[40:53] to God. So thankful for that. Amen. Lord
[40:56] richly bless you. Amen. Anyone else
[41:00] maybe have a testimony today or
[41:01] something before we change over the
[41:05] service? Amen.
[41:09] Praise the Lord. If not, we'll just go
[41:10] ahead and stand to our feet. Amen. Turn
[41:13] over to Romans chapter 8. We're going to
[41:15] read one verse of scripture here and
[41:17] continue on with our thought from last
[41:18] week. Amen. Romans chapter 8 verse
[41:22] [Music]
[41:29] 19. Romans
[41:34] 8:19. Praise the Lord. We're going into
[41:37] adoption part 13. Amen. And manifested
[41:41] sons of God part two for this week. So
[41:45] trust and pray. Pray it be a blessing to
[41:47] you today. Amen. Romans 8:19. Before we
[41:50] read, let's bow our heads for another
[41:51] word of prayer. Lord Jesus, again,
[41:54] Father, we're so very thankful to be
[41:56] here today. So thankful of your love and
[41:58] mercy, Lord. Thank you for your grace
[42:00] that you give us, leading, guiding, and
[42:02] directing us into all your truths. Lord,
[42:05] we know God and recognize that in
[42:07] ourselves we are nothing without you.
[42:09] But God, we so thankful that through you
[42:12] we can do all things because you
[42:14] strengthen us, Lord. You bless us. You
[42:16] give us the help that we need, Lord, to
[42:19] continue to press this battle. Yes. The
[42:21] lateness of the hour and what we see and
[42:23] how this world is unfolding. God, we
[42:26] recognize that. But Lord, we also
[42:28] recognize more than anything that
[42:30] greater is he that is in us than he that
[42:32] is in the world.
[42:34] Thank you for these signs, Lord. Thank
[42:36] you for showing us, revealing to us,
[42:38] God, the the reality of the things
[42:41] that's happening today. By
[42:44] revelation, people see the things
[42:46] happening in the world today. Many
[42:48] people would acknowledge that that it it
[42:52] can't be the world can't go much longer.
[42:54] Some just secular Christians and regular
[42:56] people would admit to that sometimes,
[42:59] Father. But without revelation,
[43:00] understanding, yes, God, it's hard to
[43:03] It's hard to view that, to see that in
[43:06] its reality, Lord. But God, you've shown
[43:08] it to us. We thank you, Father, for that
[43:10] vision, for that eyes have Lord, Lord,
[43:13] peeled it off, God, that we can
[43:15] recognize and see the day and the hour
[43:17] that we live. Lord, we pray that you
[43:20] take complete full control of the
[43:22] remaining part of this service as we
[43:23] commit it into your hands. Lord, may you
[43:26] just bless and help us, Father, to
[43:27] accomplish that. that you set this
[43:29] service forth for today. God, we know it
[43:32] will not return void, but may that word
[43:34] find its bed ground on the hearts of
[43:36] your people. Once again, we commit it to
[43:38] you, Lord, and ask your blessings upon
[43:40] it. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[43:42] Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[43:45] Romans
[43:46] 8:19, we'll read this one verse of
[43:48] scripture and let you be seated. For the
[43:51] earnest expectation of the creature
[43:54] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[43:57] sons of God. Amen. You can be seated if
[43:59] you'd
[44:00] like. Amen. We've had uh a very
[44:04] important
[44:06] event happen this week. And you know me,
[44:08] I'm not someone that goes to try to make
[44:11] u uh prophecy be clear by modern events
[44:14] because that's not what brother Brandham
[44:16] preached. Amen. He may he's he preached
[44:19] modern events made by clear by prophecy.
[44:21] There's a difference between the two.
[44:23] that we do recognize acknowledge the
[44:26] scriptural significance of the pope's
[44:28] passing this week uh and the things
[44:30] that's happening and involving and
[44:32] behind that. Um there's a lot more in
[44:36] depth that I is not necessarily more
[44:39] along of a of a of a teaching type thing
[44:42] but uh that we won't delve into. But uh
[44:46] we do recognize how late the hour is
[44:48] saints and we do know that this could be
[44:51] the very last pope. Amen. That comes up.
[44:54] I This one that this one just died.
[44:56] Could have been the last. I don't know.
[44:58] Uh they talked about there being 165 and
[45:02] I believe that last one was the 165th
[45:04] one. This last one that went uh they had
[45:08] places on their wall or something for
[45:09] all the pictures of the pope. And to my
[45:12] understanding, this picture of this last
[45:14] one was the last placement they had for
[45:17] a picture of a pope.
[45:19] Um, we do know that brother Brandham
[45:22] said there would be one rise out of the
[45:24] United States. But I take that and I
[45:28] believe that absolutely but I take that
[45:31] with an understanding uh and I'm just
[45:34] giving this to you as my congregation.
[45:36] Um, I take that as understanding uh a
[45:40] lot like I would uh as I've preached
[45:42] before like California sinking. Uh we
[45:45] know California is going to sink. We
[45:47] know that. Amen. Amen. We know the
[45:49] judgment pronounced on Los Angeles. We
[45:51] understand and believe that. Amen. Is
[45:53] given by true God word prophet that
[45:56] California is going to sink. What we
[45:58] don't know is because he never says that
[46:02] is that sinking going to happen before
[46:04] or after the rapture. Right? We don't
[46:06] know that because we know there's going
[46:08] to be a period of time after the bride's
[46:10] gone that the world's going to continue
[46:13] on. Brother Van said they would continue
[46:15] having church. they would continue
[46:17] coming to the altar. They would continue
[46:19] thinking that that they're being saved
[46:22] and they're and there's not. Uh they'll
[46:24] the world would just continue to go on.
[46:27] Uh we know the second half of Daniel 70
[46:30] weeks and the three and a half years
[46:32] that's left and the tribulation that's
[46:34] got us in and all that's all going to be
[46:36] after the bride's gone. Yes. So I I
[46:39] don't major on that or preach that very
[46:41] much because that's not something that
[46:43] we are concerned about. That's not
[46:45] something we have to face that that we
[46:48] believe we're going to be gone before
[46:49] that happens, before that all sets in.
[46:52] Same thing with California. We don't
[46:54] know before or after. Same thing with
[46:56] the prophecy of uh uh of the Pope from
[46:59] the United States. We don't know uh if
[47:02] that's going to if we're going to see
[47:04] that or if it will be after we're gone,
[47:06] after the rapture. I I I've not found
[47:10] any place where brother Bam specified,
[47:13] right? It just is going to happen. And
[47:15] we know it's going to happen. I mean,
[47:17] Isaiah prophesied, "A virgin shall
[47:20] conceive. Didn't happen the next day.
[47:23] Didn't happen the next week. Didn't
[47:25] happen the next year." And he didn't
[47:27] specify, but it would happen. And it did
[47:30] happen. This almost 700 years later, but
[47:33] it did happen. Amen. We don't know when
[47:36] California before the rapture, after the
[47:39] rapture, don't know this this pope. And
[47:43] this may be that pope. We don't know.
[47:45] The one that's coming up may be the one.
[47:48] Um uh I I I I sent out a text to
[47:52] everybody because I felt it was a
[47:55] significant enough spiritual um uh event
[47:59] to let everybody know that maybe you
[48:01] didn't or did know. I'm not sure. I
[48:03] can't remember if I sent to you the uh
[48:06] where brother Brown talked about that
[48:08] where that prophecy came out of that
[48:10] pope to the United States. Uh but I did
[48:13] do some research and found out that like
[48:17] the pope that's in like the third
[48:19] position so they say uh at least one of
[48:23] the top five
[48:25] uh that's that they consider cardinals
[48:28] one of the top five is from the United
[48:30] States right he is United States born
[48:34] and bred cardinal and he's on the one of
[48:39] he's on the top tier the top list uh uh
[48:43] of the next pope to take to take the
[48:45] place of the pope. So uh we can see that
[48:48] happening. Um maybe it does, maybe it
[48:51] doesn't. If it doesn't doesn't mean
[48:55] doesn't mean the prophecy is not true.
[48:56] Doesn't mean the prophecy won't happen.
[48:58] It just means it wasn't that time,
[48:59] right? We don't know. God works in
[49:02] mysterious ways, saints. I mean, you
[49:04] talk about things that are out of the
[49:06] ordinary. Pretty much everything God
[49:08] does is out of the ordinary. I mean, one
[49:11] of the I I've done some strange things
[49:14] in my life that people consider strange
[49:17] uh just trying to follow the leadership
[49:18] of the Lord. Yes, I've had people
[49:21] question me, not understand. Uh I not
[49:25] understand sometimes, but just trying to
[49:27] find follow the leadership of the Lord.
[49:29] But I look back and I think the Bible is
[49:33] full of strange things that people did
[49:35] trying to follow God's word. Yes. Amen.
[49:38] Think about uh I mean who ever heard of
[49:41] a man building a huge boat just so two
[49:43] of every animal could come on it, right?
[49:46] I mean, you talk about strange. That is
[49:49] that's that's probably one of the
[49:50] strangest things you could think of. God
[49:53] instructing a man to take all that time
[49:56] to build this big huge boat so make sure
[49:58] every two of every animal could come and
[50:00] live on it. Right?
[50:02] That that's that's pretty strange
[50:04] saints. You got to admit we know it is.
[50:07] But we know that we serve a strange God.
[50:09] Strange according to humanity, right?
[50:14] Amen. But uh but the significance of
[50:17] this happening and this taking place is
[50:20] very significant. I personally thought
[50:23] uh this pope would have been the one to
[50:25] sweep us into that rapture actually
[50:27] because this pope was one of the
[50:29] friendliest popes. Uh he had garnered
[50:32] favorship with Muslims with Oh. pretty
[50:37] much every religion. He had garnered a a
[50:40] favorable rating with homosexuals and
[50:43] with um nominal Christians and
[50:47] charismatics and denominations. He had
[50:49] curried favor with every leader of the
[50:52] world that I can think of. Uh pretty
[50:54] much all of them came to visit him. All
[50:56] of them come to like him. He was very he
[50:59] was a very favorable pope worldwide
[51:03] uh to almost every facet of life to
[51:06] every race, every color, every gender um
[51:10] of course there's only two of those two
[51:13] um to to to all to every all the leaders
[51:17] countries and that that's you can see
[51:21] that being that beast pope that rises up
[51:24] to be able to take control over the
[51:27] entire world. You can see it's going to
[51:29] be someone that's going to garner
[51:32] favorability from all the countries,
[51:34] right? From all the leaders, right? From
[51:36] all the religions, from all the
[51:38] different colors and races. You can see
[51:40] that because he's going to be in control
[51:43] of all of them. How did how better to
[51:45] tell? Brother Bam said just like the
[51:47] devil has always done, he comes in like
[51:50] flatteries, right? Amen. He's not coming
[51:53] in with a rule of of a of an iron fist.
[51:56] He's coming in with flatteries,
[51:58] pleasantries,
[51:59] uh, to make them like him, say things
[52:03] that would make them like him, change
[52:06] their ways of thoughts as far as how the
[52:10] Catholic Church operates to try to
[52:12] garner favor from this group and from
[52:14] that group and from this religion. I can
[52:17] see that being that way. So that then he
[52:19] takes over the whole world like
[52:22] flatteries. Amen. flatters them, smooes
[52:25] them, make them feel home, make them
[52:27] feel like, oh, this is a good guy. And
[52:30] upon his passing, you hear that amongst
[52:34] I have amongst so many different people,
[52:39] denominations, and leaders and
[52:43] um it's but we know that's in Revelation
[52:46] 17 tells us that's going to happen.
[52:49] They're all going to come back to that
[52:50] one place. So, we can't ignore I I don't
[52:53] want to spend a whole service talking
[52:54] about it, but we can't ignore what's
[52:57] happened, right? And the significance,
[52:59] the spiritual significance of what's
[53:01] happening in the world today. It is
[53:03] truly, it is manifesting time. Amen. And
[53:07] it is manifesting time not just only for
[53:10] the manifested sons, daughters of God,
[53:12] but for the manifestation of it. See,
[53:15] because the light when the light shines,
[53:17] this this last day light is shining on
[53:20] everything. It's bringing all the wicked
[53:23] things to light, too. It's not just the
[53:25] manifesting of the sons of God, but it's
[53:28] also manifesting and showing all the
[53:30] other things around. You know, it used
[53:33] to be that uh in this country that we
[53:36] we've known and u I'll say like my dad
[53:40] used to say uh it's all rotten to the
[53:43] core and the core is rotten too. Um and
[53:47] and brother Brandham said that. So we've
[53:49] known that for years, but you've never
[53:51] seen a time where it's come out from
[53:53] undercover. People don't care. They
[53:55] don't try to hide anymore, right? People
[53:57] don't try to hide their hatred anymore.
[53:59] They don't try to hide their dissension
[54:01] and their uh their their just their
[54:03] their blatant uh uh immoralities and
[54:08] they they don't care anymore. It it's
[54:10] it's the whole world has gotten to the
[54:12] place it's just uh it people don't care,
[54:16] right? Uh used to be there was kind of
[54:18] undercover and people would now then
[54:21] they started calling for homosexuals
[54:22] then they started call coming out of the
[54:24] closet is the phrase that they use.
[54:27] They've come out of the closet. But they
[54:30] say then what they're saying is that
[54:32] they hid all these years. Amen. But what
[54:35] they don't realize that that spirit's
[54:37] just going gaining ground all the time,
[54:40] right? Just like all the other evil
[54:42] spirits just gaining ground all the
[54:44] time, getting stronger, getting more
[54:45] wicked. But now it's out in the open.
[54:48] All this is just out in the open. Light
[54:50] has shone on it. Amen. Men, people,
[54:54] wicked people still hate the light
[54:56] because it makes their deeds come into
[54:58] into light. Everybody sees how wicked
[55:01] they are now, but they don't care,
[55:03] right? It it just simply doesn't matter
[55:07] anymore. Amen. You probably see it as
[55:09] much in politics as anywhere else.
[55:11] Again, rotten to the core and core
[55:14] rotten too. Been for years, still is.
[55:17] Amen. But what have we got? We've got to
[55:19] a place where all these this manifesting
[55:22] is coming is coming out. It's shining
[55:25] light on it. It's coming to a reality
[55:27] and we see it. We recognize what's
[55:29] happening. Now, let's go back to the
[55:32] scripture. I wanted to make that very
[55:35] clear. I don't want anybody going out
[55:38] saying uh we've had before like uh like
[55:42] when Biden became president, was
[55:44] inaugurated, and and uh uh the woman the
[55:48] vice president um
[55:52] yeah Harris she wore this uh purple
[55:56] outfit and uh everybody was spreading
[55:58] all this while you know that brother
[56:00] Bram talked about the scarlet colored
[56:02] and the purple and all I said and and
[56:05] but see the problem that the problem you
[56:07] run into is you if you make something
[56:10] like that an absolute and it comes not
[56:12] to be true then you you can't speak with
[56:15] authority and not know what you're
[56:16] talking about. I know brother Brandham
[56:19] said that yes this could be that person
[56:22] but it might not. So don't make it like
[56:25] this is it or that that she is it or
[56:28] that he is it. You don't know right.
[56:31] Amen. Amen. Uh without further
[56:33] instruction of the Lord or another God
[56:35] prophet to come and bring that prophecy
[56:38] that brings it plain. We don't know. Uh,
[56:42] and of course now it looks like that
[56:45] this woman that was supposed to take
[56:47] over everything now is kind of almost
[56:50] fall fallen back into obscurity. Uh,
[56:54] nobody even seems to care about her
[56:55] anymore. I don't know if that's true,
[56:57] but uh maybe there's something down the
[56:59] road. Maybe she still is. I don't know.
[57:02] Uh but when you make when you make when
[57:05] you put everything into one thing and
[57:07] that turns out not not to be the thing
[57:08] then uh it it just looks bad. I used to
[57:12] do that when I very first started
[57:14] ministering. Uh I remember uh shortly
[57:17] after I started preaching they found
[57:19] that red heer in Israel. Oh my goodness.
[57:22] Every all the preaching in in North
[57:24] Carolina and that whole area or that
[57:26] whole region around there including
[57:27] myself is that red heer's there. That's
[57:29] it. You know, that's going to be that
[57:31] red
[57:32] heer probably done and made steaks and
[57:36] digested and everything else by now. Uh
[57:39] cuz that was 30 years ago. Yeah. Uh
[57:41] where is it now? That that cow's not
[57:43] still alive, right?
[57:46] But but that was it, you know. And you
[57:48] make that it then that's not it. Then
[57:50] where do you go from there? See, and you
[57:52] get to the point and and the Lord taught
[57:54] me a lesson about that. Amen. The best
[57:57] way
[57:59] to interpret God's word is to let him
[58:02] bring it to pass. Yes, that's the best
[58:05] interpretation I know of is when God
[58:07] brings it to pass. But thank God we do
[58:10] have a word. We do have a prophet that
[58:12] the Lord has shine that light upon our
[58:14] paths that we can that word's broke down
[58:16] for us so we can read it and God will
[58:18] feed us with it and we can see the times
[58:20] that we're living. Amen. This may be
[58:23] again this may be that time for that US
[58:26] pope. It seems like I know people that
[58:29] every time a pope dies the pope from us
[58:32] is next. Every time it's not been this
[58:36] may be may not. Doesn't matter. Again we
[58:39] don't even know if we'll see it. We
[58:41] don't even know if we'll be here to see
[58:42] that. That may happen after we're gone.
[58:44] We don't know. Right? But we do know the
[58:47] spe the spiritual significance of that
[58:50] event unfolding in front of us though
[58:52] still yet manifested sons of God. Now we
[58:55] get back to the scripture for the
[58:57] earnest expectation. We talked about
[58:59] that
[59:00] briefly. Earnest expectation just
[59:02] basically means uh an anxious
[59:05] persistence. Uh the earnest expectation.
[59:09] There's an anxious uh anticipation.
[59:12] persistent anxious uh persistent
[59:15] anticipation waiting for the creature
[59:19] waiting or creation. Remember we talked
[59:22] about that creature is creation waitth
[59:25] for the manifestation of the sons of
[59:28] God. Now again, it's not just the sons
[59:31] of God, but the manifestation of the
[59:34] sons of God where the light has come
[59:37] down and those sons of God producing the
[59:40] same life that Jesus did when he was
[59:42] here, right? living that same life,
[59:45] producing that same life, producing that
[59:48] same power, letting that same spirit
[59:50] work through them, letting that same
[59:52] spirit manifest itself through them and
[59:55] showing that those manifested sons of
[59:58] God, sons and daughters of God
[1:00:00] manifested on this world again today.
[1:00:03] See, or or now today, manifested for us.
[1:00:07] It's the same manifestation we talked
[1:00:09] about. That's a revealing. A revealing
[1:00:12] or an unveiling. A manifesting is just
[1:00:15] an unveiling. A revealing like uh like
[1:00:18] uh Luke 17:30. Amen. That when it talks
[1:00:23] about the revealing of the son of man.
[1:00:26] Amen. When that son of man is revealed,
[1:00:29] yes, manifested, unfolded, we can
[1:00:33] recognize and see that and know that
[1:00:35] that that applies to our day. Amen. We
[1:00:38] can see that that applies to our day.
[1:00:41] See that true that true gospel light
[1:00:45] brings everything into manifest. That
[1:00:48] true light brings everything into
[1:00:50] manifest. Now, let's go back and get
[1:00:53] some background in Genesis. We start
[1:00:56] with the seed chapter, the seed book.
[1:00:59] Genesis chapter 1, verse
[1:01:05] one. Amen. Genesis chapter 1, start with
[1:01:08] verse
[1:01:10] one. Um, you may just read the whole
[1:01:13] chapter. We'll see how we get to we get
[1:01:16] through this. Genesis 1 verse one. In
[1:01:20] the
[1:01:21] beginning, God created the heaven and
[1:01:24] the earth. Amen. And the earth was
[1:01:27] without form and void, and darkness was
[1:01:31] upon the face of the deep. So, the earth
[1:01:34] was without form and void. In fact, it
[1:01:37] was it was said to be uh this word
[1:01:40] chaotic
[1:01:41] or in
[1:01:43] disarray uh in chaos. It was without
[1:01:47] form and void, empty, dark. Uh could you
[1:01:51] imagine the the the situation the earth
[1:01:54] is God was unfolding it here bringing it
[1:01:57] from the without form, chaotic and void,
[1:02:01] empty, dark was upon the face of the
[1:02:04] deep. But then the spirit of God moved
[1:02:08] upon the face of the waters. Praise the
[1:02:11] Lord. God's spirit moved on the face of
[1:02:13] the waters. Now, that's not a trinity of
[1:02:16] God. That's just simply the spirit of
[1:02:18] God. Amen. Nothing different. Just God
[1:02:22] himself, his spirit. We have human
[1:02:25] spirits that are simply a reflection of
[1:02:28] his spirit that he has. He is God. He
[1:02:31] has a spirit. Amen. We're humans. We
[1:02:34] have a spirit, our human spirit. Amen.
[1:02:37] Amen. We also have now if you're born
[1:02:39] again, the Holy Spirit that lives in
[1:02:42] your soul. But that's not your human
[1:02:44] spirit. Amen. Your human spirit is your
[1:02:46] life. It's your conscience, affection,
[1:02:49] reason, memory. That's the the part of
[1:02:52] you that thinks and that remembers and
[1:02:55] uh it's not your brain, your spirit. See
[1:02:57] your spirit just like God's God's spirit
[1:03:00] God's spirit moved upon the face of the
[1:03:03] waters and God said let there be light
[1:03:07] and there was light and God saw the
[1:03:10] light that it was good and divided the
[1:03:12] light from the darkness and God called
[1:03:14] the light day and the darkness he called
[1:03:16] night and the evening and the morning
[1:03:18] were the first day. Now notice how the
[1:03:20] first thing that God created heaven and
[1:03:22] the earth and everything was chaotic.
[1:03:26] Everything was empty, void and dark. And
[1:03:29] so God created or peeled back. So the
[1:03:32] the vision of what God created come into
[1:03:35] fruition, come into view. The light was
[1:03:38] there was manifested right in front of
[1:03:41] them. Amen. Then the light. Now
[1:03:46] recognize God made the light to come
[1:03:50] first. First thing that was
[1:03:52] necessary for necessary for this earth
[1:03:55] was light. There had to be light.
[1:03:58] Everything would have still been the
[1:03:59] chaotic darkness that it was in if there
[1:04:02] had not come light. So there had to be
[1:04:04] light and the light had to come first.
[1:04:07] God called the light day, the darkness
[1:04:08] he called night. The evening and the
[1:04:10] morning were the first day. And God
[1:04:12] said, "Let there be a firmament in the
[1:04:13] midst of the waters. And let it divide
[1:04:15] the waters from the waters." And God
[1:04:17] made the firmament and divided uh
[1:04:20] divided the waters which were under the
[1:04:22] firmament from the waters which were
[1:04:24] above the firminant firmament. And it
[1:04:26] was so. Now notice God has taken the
[1:04:28] very two things that are the most
[1:04:31] essential to life and brought them forth
[1:04:34] first.
[1:04:36] Light and
[1:04:37] water. It takes light and it takes
[1:04:40] water. Amen. To sustain life. The life
[1:04:44] that God was about to create, the God
[1:04:47] that was about to to transform the earth
[1:04:50] or form into the earth. Life that he was
[1:04:53] about to bring forth. Well, it had to
[1:04:55] come through. There had to be light
[1:04:57] first. There had to be water first. It
[1:05:00] could not have sustained if there was
[1:05:02] still darkness, right? It couldn't live.
[1:05:06] Body life can't live. Animal life can't
[1:05:08] live. Human life can't live in the
[1:05:11] darkness. We have to have light. Yes.
[1:05:13] Amen. We can't live without water.
[1:05:16] Botney life, animal life, human life
[1:05:18] can't live without water. Amen. We have
[1:05:20] to have water. Amen. So the water and
[1:05:22] the light were the things that God
[1:05:24] created or brought forth first. Those
[1:05:27] were the things that was the most
[1:05:29] necessary. Uh eth
[1:05:33] verse. And it was so. And God called eth
[1:05:35] verse. And God called the firmament
[1:05:37] heaven, and the evening and the morning
[1:05:40] were the second day. God said, "Let the
[1:05:43] waters under the heaven be gathered
[1:05:45] together into one place, and let the dry
[1:05:47] land appear." And it was so. God called
[1:05:50] the dry land earth, and the gathering
[1:05:53] together of the waters called he seas.
[1:05:55] And God saw that it was
[1:05:57] good. And God said, "Let the earth bring
[1:06:00] forth grass." Now God's starting his his
[1:06:05] unfolding of creation. Now, God's
[1:06:08] created the heaven and the earth as it
[1:06:10] says. Amen. And as it says that, and as
[1:06:13] brother Brandham said, God said he
[1:06:16] created the heaven and the earth. Yes.
[1:06:18] Period.
[1:06:20] He didn't say how long. Didn't say uh uh
[1:06:25] what time it lasts or any. It's God
[1:06:28] created the heaven and earth. Brother
[1:06:29] Brham said that God created the heaven
[1:06:31] and the earth. Period. So from there God
[1:06:35] starts this seven-day process or really
[1:06:37] six days, seventh day rested of
[1:06:40] unfolding the beginning of the creation
[1:06:43] of starting this planet.
[1:06:46] U some people say over again. Amen.
[1:06:50] Brother Ram talked about the cat
[1:06:52] cataclysmic event. The Bible talks about
[1:06:54] a cataclysmic event that shook this
[1:06:57] earth that this earth was one time on
[1:06:59] its perfect axis. Amen. with the with
[1:07:02] the axis of this earth going straight
[1:07:04] up, north, perfect, south, perfect,
[1:07:06] straight up and down. But this
[1:07:08] cataclysmic event, whatever it was, turn
[1:07:11] this earth and tilted it over 23 and a
[1:07:14] half degrees. So this earth is not on
[1:07:16] its perfect axis anymore, right? Amen.
[1:07:19] If you run a pin through, as they say, I
[1:07:21] don't know how they figure this between
[1:07:23] something that's spinning up in heaven.
[1:07:25] I you know, you got something on a on a
[1:07:27] table or something, I can tell you this
[1:07:29] is up and this is downward. How do you
[1:07:31] do that and you suspend it in space? I
[1:07:33] don't know. I don't try to figure that
[1:07:34] part out. But I do know as brother Ram
[1:07:37] said that it's not in its perfect axis
[1:07:40] anymore. But he said that it will one
[1:07:43] day go back to that place. Right. Amen.
[1:07:46] Or it's in its perfect access again. Is
[1:07:49] that the tribulation? Is that the
[1:07:51] shaking of this earth when when it all
[1:07:54] explodes? And brother Ram said even the
[1:07:56] the earth will explode and the chemicals
[1:07:58] explode. the atmospheres will explode
[1:08:00] and burn all the sin and all the the
[1:08:04] separation of all the sin and all that
[1:08:06] was in in the earth and the atmosphere
[1:08:08] and everything that was wrong to make
[1:08:10] everything back right again was going to
[1:08:12] come back. I don't know. I don't know if
[1:08:14] it's that time or not, but he said it
[1:08:15] would come back again to its perfect
[1:08:17] access again where it was supposed to
[1:08:18] be. Amen. Whatever this time was, now
[1:08:22] God is bringing forth life again. He
[1:08:24] takes six days to do it. Amen. He does
[1:08:28] the body life and we see we've already
[1:08:30] had two days where he talks about the
[1:08:32] water the the the the sun and separating
[1:08:35] it and and the night and the day and he
[1:08:38] talked which which the Bible talks about
[1:08:40] again here and talks about the the water
[1:08:42] and the firmaments is the two days is
[1:08:45] the very important part of sustaining
[1:08:47] life. Amen. People talk about life on
[1:08:51] other planets. You know what they have
[1:08:52] to do before they even consider there
[1:08:54] might be life on another planet? They
[1:08:57] have to check to find if there's water
[1:08:58] on that planet.
[1:09:00] That's the first thing they find out. If
[1:09:03] they find out that there's water on a
[1:09:05] planet, then they can assume that the
[1:09:07] possibility of life exists on another
[1:09:10] planet. Now,
[1:09:12] that that's beyond me. I don't go into
[1:09:15] that. That's outside of my scope of
[1:09:18] intelligence or frankly uh desire to
[1:09:22] know. I I I don't really care to know if
[1:09:24] there's life on other planets. I'm not
[1:09:26] worried about that. I have a hard enough
[1:09:28] time taking care of this guy on this
[1:09:29] planet. So, uh, something else on
[1:09:32] another planet, that's okay. Let
[1:09:34] somebody else deal with that. I'll try
[1:09:35] to do my best to take care of this guy
[1:09:37] on this planet. But now we're getting
[1:09:39] into the creation. Uh, outside of the
[1:09:42] light, the firmament, and uh, ninth
[1:09:46] verse, God uh, let's see, God said, "Let
[1:09:49] the waters under the heaven be gathered
[1:09:51] together in one place. Let the dry land
[1:09:52] appear." It was so. God called the dry
[1:09:55] land earth, and gathered together uh of
[1:09:57] the waters called he seized. God saw it
[1:10:00] was good. And God said, "Let the earth
[1:10:01] now bring forth grass, the herb yielding
[1:10:06] seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit
[1:10:09] after his kind, whose seed is in itself
[1:10:14] upon the earth." And it was so. And
[1:10:16] every form of creation, botney life,
[1:10:20] animal life, human life, did the exact
[1:10:22] same way. Amen. As he put botney life
[1:10:26] here first in in the uh progressing of
[1:10:31] God's creation, starting with botney
[1:10:33] life, he put that uh in itself. Now, to
[1:10:38] me, um well, we haven't gotten to that
[1:10:41] place yet because this is just botney
[1:10:42] life, but to me, this solves the
[1:10:45] question of which came first, the
[1:10:47] chicken or the egg? To me, it's simple.
[1:10:49] Yeah. If you're a Christian and believe
[1:10:51] God and his word, we know the chicken
[1:10:54] came first because he created the
[1:10:56] chicken and he put inside the chicken
[1:10:57] the ability to reproduce, right? Then
[1:11:00] you got the egg. Amen. Not not difficult
[1:11:03] to those who believe. Amen. But this is
[1:11:06] that same thing. He created the the herb
[1:11:09] yielding seed. The fruit the seed was in
[1:11:12] itself to reproduce itself on the earth.
[1:11:15] 12th verse. And the earth brought forth
[1:11:18] grass and herb yielding seed after his
[1:11:21] kind. And the tree yielding fruit whose
[1:11:24] seed was in itself after his kind. And
[1:11:27] God saw that it was good. And the
[1:11:30] evening and the morning were the third
[1:11:31] day. And God said, "Let there be lights
[1:11:34] in the firmament of heaven to divide the
[1:11:36] day from the night. Let them be for
[1:11:38] signs, for seasons, for days, for years.
[1:11:41] And let them uh be for lights in the
[1:11:43] firmament of heaven to give light upon
[1:11:45] the earth." And it was so. And God made
[1:11:47] two great lights. The greater light to
[1:11:50] rule the day and the lesser light to
[1:11:51] rule the night. He made the stars also.
[1:11:55] Brother Ram talked about it. He just
[1:11:57] blew them off the palm of his hand.
[1:11:59] Amen. He blew one off and just took the
[1:12:03] took his fingertip and brought it over
[1:12:05] and stopped it right there. Said, "You
[1:12:07] stay right there." He brought the next
[1:12:09] one over and he put it over. and they
[1:12:11] look up and they say, "Oh, there's
[1:12:13] Orion's belt and there's a Big Dipper
[1:12:15] and there's a little dipper." And that's
[1:12:16] probably all I know. So, I won't call
[1:12:18] any others, but constellations of the
[1:12:20] stars, uh, somebody that knows all that
[1:12:23] can do. But God put those all in place
[1:12:25] and say, "Wow, that's that's fantastic
[1:12:27] how that is." No, God did it all that
[1:12:29] way. Yes. I don't know why. Why did he
[1:12:31] make one look like a little dipper? I
[1:12:33] have no idea. Why did he make one look
[1:12:35] like this or that and they got the
[1:12:36] zodiac from it and all this? I don't
[1:12:38] know.
[1:12:39] uh that's just his choice. But brother
[1:12:41] Bam talked about in the book of Genesis
[1:12:43] uh which he preached on like in the 50s.
[1:12:46] If you go and listen, he talked about
[1:12:47] God bringing that over and putting in
[1:12:49] place. And you know, I just think about
[1:12:51] God walking off to the edge of eternity
[1:12:54] and just blow them off his hands and
[1:12:56] just all every commanded every one of
[1:12:58] them to go exactly where he wanted them.
[1:13:00] Amen. Amen. Planets, the moon, stars,
[1:13:03] everything. He just he commands every
[1:13:05] bit of it because he's God. Amen. It
[1:13:08] wasn't something some great uh
[1:13:10] outstanding event. He just blew them off
[1:13:13] the palm of his hand and there goes the
[1:13:15] stars and there goes Saturn and there
[1:13:17] goes Mars and all that. God just put
[1:13:20] them all into place exactly where they
[1:13:21] are. They're still there. Amen. They're
[1:13:24] still there. People can explain all
[1:13:26] kinds of things and changes and all
[1:13:28] things have changed and all kind those
[1:13:31] stars are exactly the way they were the
[1:13:32] very first time they were set there.
[1:13:34] They're still there. Amen. Amen. Praise
[1:13:37] the Lord. God's in control of them. Yes,
[1:13:39] he is. Brings them all about. The stars
[1:13:41] also. God set them in the firmament of
[1:13:43] the heavens to give light upon the earth
[1:13:45] to rule over the uh over the day and
[1:13:48] over the night and divide the light from
[1:13:49] the darkness. And God saw that it was
[1:13:51] good. The evening and the morning were
[1:13:53] the fourth day. God said, "Let the
[1:13:55] waters bring forth abundantly the moving
[1:13:58] creature that hath life and foul that
[1:14:01] may fly above the earth in the open
[1:14:04] firmament of heaven." Now we get to that
[1:14:05] chicken. Amen. And God created great
[1:14:09] wells, and every living creature that
[1:14:11] moveth, which the waters brought forth
[1:14:13] abundantly after their kind, and every
[1:14:15] wing foul after his kind. And God saw
[1:14:18] that it was good. And God blessed them,
[1:14:21] saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and
[1:14:23] fill the waters in the sea, and let the
[1:14:25] foul multiply in the earth." God's
[1:14:27] second that evolution of life, that
[1:14:31] progression of life from botney life now
[1:14:34] to animal life, right? The evening and
[1:14:36] the morning were the fifth day. And God
[1:14:38] said, "Let the earth bring forth the
[1:14:40] living creature after his kind, cattle
[1:14:43] and creeping thing, and beasts of the
[1:14:45] earth after his kind." And it was so.
[1:14:47] And God made the beast of the earth
[1:14:49] after his kind, and cattle after their
[1:14:51] kind, and everything that creepeth upon
[1:14:53] the earth after his kind. And God saw
[1:14:55] that it was good. And God saw said, "Let
[1:14:58] us make man." Amen. Man is mammal. Amen.
[1:15:02] We are animal. Amen.
[1:15:06] animal flesh and we're animal nature.
[1:15:10] Amen. We were we we weren't created that
[1:15:12] way. We were created in the image of
[1:15:14] God. Yes. But we were created in in the
[1:15:18] aspect of mammals, just a a higher form.
[1:15:22] Amen. A greater form. Uh brother Bham
[1:15:25] said, "A man without the Holy Ghost is
[1:15:27] like a beast, an animal." Amen. And and
[1:15:31] we certainly do see that around today.
[1:15:33] the more the more and more of that
[1:15:35] manifesting itself around the world
[1:15:37] today where you see people's true beast
[1:15:40] nature beginning to uh manifest itself
[1:15:42] and come forth more and more all the
[1:15:44] time. Amen. Let us make man in our image
[1:15:48] after our likeness. And let them have
[1:15:51] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[1:15:52] over the fowl of the air and over the
[1:15:54] cattle and over all the earth and over
[1:15:56] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[1:15:58] the earth. So God created man in his own
[1:16:00] image. In the image of God created he
[1:16:03] him. Male and female created he them.
[1:16:05] Remember now in God's image is a spirit
[1:16:08] form. Amen. God has not put man in
[1:16:11] flesh. Yet he created him a spirit man
[1:16:14] first. Because notice he said he made
[1:16:16] man in his image. What is God's image?
[1:16:18] God's not a man. God's not a mortal.
[1:16:21] God's not a flesh being. God's a spirit.
[1:16:24] Right? Amen. This is when he made God
[1:16:26] man in his own image. He made man in in
[1:16:28] his image in the spirit of man in his
[1:16:31] own likeness. Spirit man, right? Male
[1:16:34] and female both male spirit and feminine
[1:16:38] spirit. God made the man in in this
[1:16:41] spirit. He created him in his own image.
[1:16:44] In the image of God created he them.
[1:16:46] Male male and female created he them.
[1:16:48] And God blessed them. And God said unto
[1:16:51] them, "Be fruitful and multiply and
[1:16:53] replenish the earth." and subdue it, and
[1:16:56] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[1:16:58] and over the fowl of the air, and over
[1:16:59] every living thing that moveth upon the
[1:17:01] earth. Now, notice, God gave man the
[1:17:04] dominion over all the earth. Amen.
[1:17:08] Brother Bam said that Adam was the God
[1:17:10] of this earth. God Adam was in control
[1:17:14] of this earth. He could move a tree. He
[1:17:18] could name an animal. uh he could do as
[1:17:21] he wished because he was he was given by
[1:17:23] God almighty God the dominion over this
[1:17:28] earth as an amateur God of this earth.
[1:17:32] So Adam was the God of this
[1:17:34] earth. God gave him that authority.
[1:17:38] God said, "Behold, I've given uh given
[1:17:41] you every herb bearing seed, which is
[1:17:43] upon the face of the of all the earth,
[1:17:45] and every tree in which the fruit uh
[1:17:48] fruit of the tree yields seed, yielding
[1:17:50] seed. To you it shall be for me, and to
[1:17:53] every beast of the earth, and to every
[1:17:54] fowl of the air, and to everything that
[1:17:56] creepeth upon the earth, wherein there
[1:17:59] is life. I have given every green herb
[1:18:01] for me." And it was so. And God saw
[1:18:03] everything that he had made. And behold,
[1:18:06] it was very good. And the evening and
[1:18:08] the morning were the sixth day. Now we
[1:18:10] know he rested the seventh day. So God
[1:18:12] give that dominion of the earth to man.
[1:18:15] Right? Amen. That was his promise. That
[1:18:18] was his uh that was his uh instruction.
[1:18:21] I give you uh dominion over the earth.
[1:18:24] Now of course when he put man in a flesh
[1:18:27] body and set him in the garden of Eden,
[1:18:29] the Bible says planted him in the garden
[1:18:32] of Eden. He shall be like a tree. Amen.
[1:18:35] Planted by the rivers of water. God, the
[1:18:37] Bible says he planted him in the Garden
[1:18:39] of Eden, a man, flesh man, and put the
[1:18:43] spirit, the masculine and feminine
[1:18:46] spirit in him. Amen. And then God
[1:18:49] recognized he is alone. He's lonely.
[1:18:52] I'll make him a helpmate. And he took
[1:18:54] the feminine spirit out of the man. And
[1:18:56] he made took from the rib of the man and
[1:18:58] made the woman and put that spirit in
[1:18:59] that woman. And now there were male and
[1:19:01] female. Right? Amen. two as humans flesh
[1:19:04] bodies each one. But he gave dominion to
[1:19:09] the earth to man. Amen. To subdue the
[1:19:13] earth to multiply and replenish to uh do
[1:19:16] as he wished. So the dominion of that
[1:19:19] was given to the man. Now
[1:19:23] look what brother said the breach uh
[1:19:26] between the church ages seals. Now, of
[1:19:28] course, when Adam fell to death, he
[1:19:31] brought death upon all creation. Amen.
[1:19:35] He brought death upon all creation.
[1:19:37] Well, no wonder all of creation is
[1:19:40] waiting for, longing for in great
[1:19:42] anxious anticipation for the
[1:19:45] manifestation of the sons of God, right?
[1:19:48] Because that was the beginning. that
[1:19:50] would be the beginning to make all of
[1:19:52] the wrongs that came as a result of this
[1:19:55] make it right again. In Genesis 3 verse
[1:19:59] 17, "And and unto Adam," he said,
[1:20:02] "Because thou has hearkened unto the
[1:20:04] voice of thy wife, and has eaten of the
[1:20:07] tree of which I commanded thee, saying,
[1:20:09] Thou shalt not eat of it, cursed is the
[1:20:12] ground for thy sake. In sorrow shalt
[1:20:15] thou eat of it all the days of thy
[1:20:17] life." Now, what did God do? God did not
[1:20:20] curse
[1:20:21] Adam. He cursed the ground. Right? Amen.
[1:20:25] Now recognize these instructions that
[1:20:28] God gave. He did not give them to the
[1:20:32] woman who later was named Eve. She was
[1:20:35] not Eve at this point. This woman who
[1:20:38] later was named Eve
[1:20:41] as Adam named her because she was the
[1:20:43] mother of all living.
[1:20:46] This instruction was not given to her.
[1:20:50] It was only given to Adam. Right? Amen.
[1:20:53] Because God didn't come down and say,
[1:20:55] "Eve, because uh or woman because I told
[1:20:58] you this." He did not tell her that. He
[1:21:01] told that to Adam, right? Now, no doubt
[1:21:03] Eve knew it because she she regurgitated
[1:21:07] it to the serpent. Right? She she uh
[1:21:10] replicated it. She's uh repeated it to
[1:21:13] the serpent over here. So, she had to
[1:21:16] know. But God didn't even acknowledge
[1:21:19] that. He acknowledged Adam, right? Amen.
[1:21:22] He's not saying, "A Eve, it's your
[1:21:24] fault." Woman, it's your fault. He said,
[1:21:26] "Adam, it's your fault." Amen. Adam,
[1:21:30] because you hearken to the voice of thy
[1:21:32] wife and has eaten of the tree of which
[1:21:34] I commanded thee, thou shalt not eat of
[1:21:36] it, cursed is the
[1:21:39] ground. Amen. Cursed is the ground for
[1:21:44] thy
[1:21:45] sake. In sorrow shalt thou eat it all
[1:21:48] the days of thy life. Now look what this
[1:21:50] word
[1:21:51] says. Now we go from Genesis 1 to
[1:21:53] Revelation 22
[1:21:56] almost in one giant leap here at least
[1:21:58] to Romans which also goes over into
[1:22:01] Revelation with it. But just for sake of
[1:22:04] this cursed is the ground. Now look what
[1:22:08] brother Ram said. He brought death upon
[1:22:10] all creation. Now creation still lived.
[1:22:15] Amen. But what did it die to? It died to
[1:22:18] that uh that state or that place of
[1:22:22] perfection that God had created it in.
[1:22:25] Amen. It fell from that place. It didn't
[1:22:28] die to die to never grow again. It died
[1:22:32] to that place that God had given them.
[1:22:34] They It fell from that position. See,
[1:22:37] all of creation cursed. The ground is
[1:22:40] cursed because of what Adam did. Amen.
[1:22:43] Well, no wonder, we can go back over
[1:22:46] here real quick or I will. No wonder the
[1:22:48] scripture says the creature was made
[1:22:51] subject to this vanity, right? The
[1:22:54] creature was made subject to it not
[1:22:57] willingly. See what Paul says in Romans?
[1:23:00] Not willingly. Why? Because the creation
[1:23:02] didn't do anything wrong. It was the man
[1:23:05] who done what was wrong. But because God
[1:23:08] put the man in charge of creation, all
[1:23:11] of creation failed when he
[1:23:14] fell. My that's why God said cursed is
[1:23:18] the ground for thy
[1:23:22] sake. Amen. Well, so if the man was the
[1:23:28] issue with the falling of creation to
[1:23:30] begin with, then how is that going to be
[1:23:34] restored?
[1:23:36] With a full
[1:23:38] restoration of the man back into his uh
[1:23:42] place again, right? Which begins with
[1:23:45] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:23:48] Yes. Praise the Lord. Look, creation
[1:23:52] creation was not waiting for the
[1:23:53] manifestation of the son of God. Because
[1:23:57] if it had been, it would have all went
[1:23:59] right back where it should have been
[1:24:01] when Jesus came, right? It wasn't
[1:24:04] waiting for the manifestation of the son
[1:24:07] of God. It's waiting for the
[1:24:09] manifestation of the sons of God. Amen.
[1:24:13] Praise the Lord. That falls that falls
[1:24:15] into our position. Yes. Praise the Lord.
[1:24:18] that falls our place. This latter day
[1:24:20] that we're living, we're at a time now.
[1:24:22] We're in the position now where we are
[1:24:24] in the control of that as manifested
[1:24:28] sons and daughters of God. Because
[1:24:31] creation fell because of Adam, creation
[1:24:34] will be made right because of man, the
[1:24:36] second Adam, Jesus Christ. Amen. Jesus
[1:24:39] made everything right, of course, and
[1:24:41] made it to the place that we could
[1:24:43] become the manifested sons of God. It's
[1:24:46] all because of him. Of course, we know
[1:24:48] that. I'm not giving us credit for
[1:24:50] something we didn't do. Uh Jesus did it
[1:24:52] all. But we recognize that the creation
[1:24:55] wasn't waiting for that. It was waiting
[1:24:57] for us. Amen. Them without us can't be
[1:25:00] made perfect even. But now because the
[1:25:04] ground was cursed for his
[1:25:08] sake, amen, the way of restoration is
[1:25:12] for man to come back to its rightful
[1:25:14] position again. Praise the Lord. And
[1:25:17] that's where we're headed, saints. Amen.
[1:25:19] That's what we're headed for. That's
[1:25:20] where we're going. Amen. That's why we
[1:25:23] come back. That's why we come back on
[1:25:26] this earth for a millennium. That's why
[1:25:29] we come back on this earth for a new
[1:25:32] heaven and a new earth. Amen. That's why
[1:25:35] we come back here because in that place,
[1:25:39] remember brother Araham said, in the
[1:25:41] millennium, every wrong will be made
[1:25:44] right. Amen. in the millennium. That's
[1:25:46] what he said. Yes. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:48] Every wrong will be made right.
[1:25:50] Everything will be back in its perfect
[1:25:52] position, perfect place, just like it
[1:25:55] was to be in the beginning. Of course,
[1:25:56] we now knowing the new heavens and new
[1:25:58] earth. Amen. We enter into that place of
[1:26:01] eternity where it's just it's just pure
[1:26:04] perfection. Amen. Amen. Human life,
[1:26:08] animal life, botney life. Yes. Amen. all
[1:26:12] back to its perfect place that it was to
[1:26:14] be in the beginning. You know, I got a
[1:26:16] thought and I I I don't want to prolong
[1:26:18] the service today, but
[1:26:22] uh you know, all humans were not meant
[1:26:26] to come. You know, people talk about and
[1:26:29] they say how well how how would it be
[1:26:32] it's unfair of God to put his seed in
[1:26:36] one person and not
[1:26:38] another. But what they don't understand
[1:26:41] is only the only the people that were in
[1:26:45] God's mind before the foundation of the
[1:26:47] world, only the people that were part of
[1:26:50] God
[1:26:51] then by that seed are going to be a a
[1:26:55] part of God now. Yes.
[1:26:59] Other people, and I don't mean this in a
[1:27:00] wrong way, and I've said this, and I've
[1:27:02] had people challenge me on this, but I
[1:27:04] I'm this the Lord's given me this
[1:27:06] pulpit. He's giving you people and I'm
[1:27:08] going to speak my heart. Amen.
[1:27:10] U not everybody that's on the earth
[1:27:13] today was supposed to be here.
[1:27:16] And when humanity fell and procreation
[1:27:20] began and it began with the serpent and
[1:27:23] the serpent seed in Eve in the woman to
[1:27:27] bring forth life that was never intended
[1:27:30] to be here. That was not in God's plan.
[1:27:33] Not that God didn't know that was going
[1:27:34] to happen. God knows everything. Yes.
[1:27:36] God knows everybody. That's why life is
[1:27:38] precious. Yes. Life is precious to God.
[1:27:41] Every life's recorded in a book. Amen.
[1:27:44] But not and and God gives every life the
[1:27:47] opportunity to receive him, to believe
[1:27:51] him, to not be bride, but but to to gain
[1:27:58] eternal life somehow through uh uh God's
[1:28:03] good graces. uh God's grace, God gives
[1:28:07] people that opportunity. Amen. That's
[1:28:09] why there'll be there'll be bride in the
[1:28:11] city and there'll be workers outside the
[1:28:13] city, right? U brother Graham talks
[1:28:17] about it. I I've read in the that people
[1:28:20] were good to the bride. Amen. Or give a
[1:28:24] cold glass of water or something, you
[1:28:26] know, to that effect. I don't want to
[1:28:28] dumb it down or simplify it, but but God
[1:28:31] has a way of being a just God, of giving
[1:28:35] everybody a chance. But not everybody
[1:28:38] was supposed to be here. Yes. God gave
[1:28:41] Adam the book of life. And every name
[1:28:43] that was predestined was in that book
[1:28:46] and was to come forth in its decreed
[1:28:49] time and season. Amen. Whenever that
[1:28:51] time came. Amen. It was supposed to be
[1:28:54] spoke forth and come forth and created
[1:28:56] just like God created in the beginning.
[1:28:59] God spoke Adam and he came forth out of
[1:29:01] the ground. God planted him in the
[1:29:02] Garden of Eden. God was supposed to
[1:29:05] create that way all the way
[1:29:07] through. Well, if that name was not in
[1:29:10] the Lamb's book of life, then that that
[1:29:14] person was never supposed when humanity
[1:29:18] fell into God's permissive will. All
[1:29:20] these people came came
[1:29:22] through for the simple reason that men
[1:29:25] and women figured out the secret of life
[1:29:27] and procreated, right?
[1:29:31] And came forth and brought forth all
[1:29:35] these
[1:29:35] people. I don't believe the earth was
[1:29:38] ever supposed to have seven billion
[1:29:40] almost eight billion people on it at one
[1:29:42] time. It never
[1:29:44] was. Amen. That that's my belief.
[1:29:49] Well, I'm thinking, well, if if if there
[1:29:52] never was in God's mind in
[1:29:56] perfection an allotted time for these
[1:29:59] individuals to come forth, it was for
[1:30:02] his people, for his bride. Yes, there
[1:30:04] was allotted that was in God's were a
[1:30:06] part of God. Yeah. But if it wasn't and
[1:30:09] they had really no appointed time for
[1:30:11] life, they just came to life because of
[1:30:14] procreation, then do those people have
[1:30:17] an appointed time of
[1:30:21] death or is there or is the appointed
[1:30:24] time of death only for God's elected,
[1:30:27] chosen,
[1:30:29] predestinated? Good question. I don't
[1:30:32] know the answer.
[1:30:34] I lean toward the part if if if if they
[1:30:38] weren't a part of God in the beginning
[1:30:40] to have an appointed time of life, I'm
[1:30:44] of the belief that they probably don't
[1:30:46] have an appointed time of
[1:30:47] death. So, when Brother Abraham says a
[1:30:50] person can die before their time, well,
[1:30:52] maybe uh maybe he's just talking about
[1:30:54] those people that never really had an
[1:30:56] appointed time of life like God's bride
[1:30:59] does. God's people, God's chosen, had an
[1:31:02] appointed time of life. Yes. Amen.
[1:31:04] Because they were in his mind before the
[1:31:06] foundation of the world. All these pe
[1:31:08] others God knew about, but they weren't
[1:31:10] in his perfect will. They came forth in
[1:31:12] permissive will. Did they have an
[1:31:14] appointed time of
[1:31:16] death or
[1:31:18] not? I don't know. That's a good
[1:31:20] question. But notice how
[1:31:23] God in in bringing forth of
[1:31:26] life brought forth this life that ended
[1:31:30] up becoming cursed. Yes. And because it
[1:31:34] was
[1:31:35] cursed, Paul could then bring to us the
[1:31:38] understanding all this
[1:31:40] creation is waiting
[1:31:43] for it to get back to the way it was.
[1:31:46] Let's put it that
[1:31:48] way. To get it back to how it was to
[1:31:51] start with in the beginning in the
[1:31:53] perfection of the Garden of Eden when
[1:31:56] all creation was perfect. Botney life,
[1:31:58] animal life, and human life were all
[1:31:59] perfect. Well, when the manifested sons
[1:32:02] of God come, we'll know it's the end
[1:32:04] time and that's the time we're living.
[1:32:06] And at that time, it's going to break
[1:32:08] forth into what we see and the
[1:32:10] purification and all that takes place in
[1:32:12] this earth and God comes and we all come
[1:32:14] back and live again here in this perfect
[1:32:16] perfect place when everything is
[1:32:19] restored back to the way it's supposed
[1:32:21] to be. All hinging on the manifestation
[1:32:25] of the sons of God. He brought death.
[1:32:28] Look now brother Mar said he brought
[1:32:29] death on all creation. Now he was given
[1:32:34] free moral agency. It was given to them
[1:32:36] to make a choice. Now Adam and Eve in
[1:32:39] the beginning there was a tree of right
[1:32:40] and wrong before them. That same tree
[1:32:43] sets before each and everyone
[1:32:45] today. God isn't doing for Adam or Eve.
[1:32:49] You say, "Well, it's their fault." Raban
[1:32:52] says, "No, it is not their fault. It is
[1:32:56] your
[1:32:57] fault. You can't place it on Adam now.
[1:33:00] You've got to place it on yourself
[1:33:02] because right wrong is set before you
[1:33:05] and we are on the same free moral agent
[1:33:08] basis as Adam and Eve were. So now it
[1:33:11] belongs to us. Do we accept it or do we
[1:33:14] reject it? Amen. Every one of us had the
[1:33:17] same. Now, brother Brandham knew what I
[1:33:20] just talked about uh intimated it in
[1:33:23] many places where where humanity come
[1:33:26] forth and God's chosen, God's bride. God
[1:33:29] didn't do that based on bias. He didn't
[1:33:32] do it based on prejudice. He did it
[1:33:35] based on his fornowledge. Yes. Amen. Of
[1:33:38] what? Of who was in his mind, who he
[1:33:40] was, who was a part of him from before
[1:33:42] the foundation of the world. And man's
[1:33:44] billions of these people are not were
[1:33:46] not. Amen. In that place, see, but
[1:33:51] recognizing that everybody still had a
[1:33:53] choice. Amen. People can still choose
[1:33:56] Jesus Christ. Yes. People can still
[1:33:58] choose the right way. Yes. People can
[1:34:00] still believe in the moral way and and
[1:34:02] and live a good godly Christian life.
[1:34:05] Amen. They may not be born again, but
[1:34:08] they be good but they can but good
[1:34:09] people. Amen.
[1:34:12] But you see when we are redeemed we no
[1:34:15] more want our own choice but we want his
[1:34:18] choice. Now Adam and Eve wanted their
[1:34:20] own choice. Now you look at humanity
[1:34:22] today that's exactly the replica of what
[1:34:25] humanity is today. Right? Everybody
[1:34:28] wants their own choice. Everybody wants
[1:34:31] their own way. I say everybody most
[1:34:33] everybody wants their own way. Yes.
[1:34:35] Humanity wants their own choice. They
[1:34:37] want to do what they want to do. Amen.
[1:34:40] We talked about the other day when God
[1:34:42] can be their people people want him as
[1:34:45] their savior, but they don't want him as
[1:34:46] their lord. God, we thank you for saving
[1:34:49] me, but now leave me alone. I got a life
[1:34:51] to
[1:34:52] live. You can't do that. It doesn't work
[1:34:55] that way. Amen. Amen. If you're born
[1:34:57] again, you don't want to live that way.
[1:34:59] If you're a child of God, you don't want
[1:35:01] to live that way. You want God to lead
[1:35:03] you and God to guide you. Amen. Now, let
[1:35:05] me drop down here. Now, Adam, when Adam
[1:35:08] sinned, he and his wife's reasoning
[1:35:10] instead of holding on to God's word, we
[1:35:12] just read that made Adam sin. His wife
[1:35:15] reasoned with Satan, the serpent, and
[1:35:18] then produced the product to Adam. And
[1:35:20] Adam turned loose of the word and sold
[1:35:23] out. He had to turn loose of the word
[1:35:26] because what he was doing was against
[1:35:28] the
[1:35:29] word. Turned loose of the word and sold
[1:35:32] out. He lost also his inheritance when
[1:35:35] he lost his fellowship and right to
[1:35:37] life. Remember the day you eat thereof
[1:35:40] the day you die. And when he lost his
[1:35:43] life, he also lost his inheritance in
[1:35:46] life. The book of life. Amen. That was
[1:35:49] his inheritance. What was Adam's
[1:35:51] inheritance? This was his inheritance.
[1:35:53] The life. Life was his inheritance.
[1:35:56] Amen. He had the book of life. Praise
[1:35:59] the Lord.
[1:36:01] when he lost his uh life, he lost also
[1:36:04] lost his inheritance in life because he
[1:36:08] had completely supreme control of the
[1:36:11] earth. He was a god of the earth. God's
[1:36:16] the god of the universe everywhere. But
[1:36:17] his son had this earth under his
[1:36:20] complete control. He could speak, he
[1:36:22] could say, uh he could name, he could
[1:36:24] say, he could stop nature, he could do
[1:36:27] anything he wanted to.
[1:36:31] But we got to understand he did whatever
[1:36:34] he wanted to under the opice of the Holy
[1:36:37] Spirit of God. Yes. Leading him having
[1:36:40] the life and spirit of God. Amen. And
[1:36:43] that's why you look today and people say
[1:36:45] well why isn't there this that and the
[1:36:47] other? Well it's based on what God's
[1:36:49] leading is in our lives. Yes. Amen. Why
[1:36:52] aren't there more healings? Why aren't
[1:36:54] there more miracles? Well, uh, the the
[1:36:56] the manifested sons of God are only
[1:36:59] going to do what they do according to
[1:37:00] what God gives them to do. Yes. Amen.
[1:37:04] And that's it. Because we follow the
[1:37:06] leadership of the Lord and the Holy
[1:37:07] Spirit in our lives, just like Adam did.
[1:37:10] We don't go around just uh, you know, I
[1:37:12] want a $10 million mansion in the
[1:37:14] foothills and a
[1:37:15] Bentley. Amen. I could speak whatever I
[1:37:18] wanted to. Well, that's not the spirit
[1:37:20] of God speaking.
[1:37:22] That's not the nature of Christ
[1:37:23] speaking. Amen.
[1:37:26] The nature of Christ speaks out. Praise
[1:37:29] the Lord. And it becomes uh to me what
[1:37:32] it seems outside of the bride becomes
[1:37:34] more and more uh becomes less and less I
[1:37:37] should say. God is the God of the
[1:37:39] universe everywhere. But his son had
[1:37:42] this earth under his own control. He
[1:37:44] could speak, he could name, say, he
[1:37:45] could stop nation, do what anything he
[1:37:47] wanted to. But when he did that, he lost
[1:37:51] his
[1:37:52] inheritance. Amen. He lost his
[1:37:55] inheritance. He had complete supreme
[1:37:58] supreme control as a minor God under God
[1:38:02] our father because he was a son of God.
[1:38:05] He said, "Oh boyh, now couldn't we stop
[1:38:08] here just a minute and get our real
[1:38:10] sermon?" You think about and what he
[1:38:13] just said? Yeah.
[1:38:16] Amen. Amen. as a minor God under God our
[1:38:20] father because he was a son of God. Now
[1:38:23] what about the sons of God today? What
[1:38:25] about the manifested sons of God today?
[1:38:28] Amen. Praise the
[1:38:30] Lord. Amen. He said, "Boy, couldn't we
[1:38:33] stop here and get our real sermons?
[1:38:34] Think about that. Where does that place
[1:38:37] us in
[1:38:38] today? What responsibility does that put
[1:38:40] on us? Where what does that show us who
[1:38:44] we are supposed to be?" Amen.
[1:38:47] It's what God has given to us. Oh, then
[1:38:50] if the blood has cleansed it back, what
[1:38:52] about now? See, look what the son of God
[1:38:55] at the second Adam did. He said, "The
[1:38:58] works that I do, the works that I do
[1:39:00] shall you do also." See, Adam lost his
[1:39:03] inheritance. The earth creation. Now, it
[1:39:07] passed from his hands to the one he sold
[1:39:09] out to, Satan, the earth. He lost the
[1:39:12] earth into the hands of Satan. But he
[1:39:14] could not, Satan could not take
[1:39:17] this. Satan could not get his filthy
[1:39:20] hands on this. Yes. This went back to
[1:39:22] the hands of the original owner, God.
[1:39:24] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. This went
[1:39:27] back to the hands of the original owner.
[1:39:29] That's how now in procreation of
[1:39:32] humanity comes forth as they come out of
[1:39:34] that book of life. But we come into the
[1:39:37] world in sin, shape, iniquity, come to
[1:39:39] the world speaking lies now. But name is
[1:39:41] still there on that book. That's why in
[1:39:44] Revelation 5, Jesus, you see Jesus over
[1:39:46] there taking that book and opening that
[1:39:48] book. And you saw why John was weeping
[1:39:51] because there was no man worthy to open
[1:39:53] that book. Cuz if that book had not been
[1:39:55] open, everybody would have been lost.
[1:39:57] Yes. There have been nobody saved.
[1:40:00] Praise the
[1:40:01] Lord. Now that book goes back in the
[1:40:04] hands of God. The earth went into the
[1:40:06] hands of Satan. That's why we now live
[1:40:08] in Satan's Eden as we now call it. Look
[1:40:10] at brother said in adoption. She said,
[1:40:12] "Now, this may choke you to
[1:40:15] death, but did you know that men are the
[1:40:19] sons, and I'll say, brothers and
[1:40:21] sisters, that are the sons of God are
[1:40:24] amateur
[1:40:27] gods?" How many ever know that? How many
[1:40:29] knows that Jesus said so? The Bible,
[1:40:31] Jesus said, "Did not your law say in
[1:40:34] itself that ye are gods? And if you call
[1:40:37] them gods, which God said in Genesis 2
[1:40:39] that were gods because they were had
[1:40:42] full dominion over uh domain over the
[1:40:45] dominion of the world. He gave him
[1:40:48] dominion over all
[1:40:51] things. He lost his godship. He lost his
[1:40:55] sunship. He lost his domain. And Satan
[1:40:58] took it over. But brethren, we are
[1:41:01] waiting. Praise God. This is 1960.
[1:41:05] We are waiting for the manifestation of
[1:41:08] the sons of God who will come back and
[1:41:11] take it over again. Amen. Praise the
[1:41:14] Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Waiting for
[1:41:16] the fullness of time when the pyramid
[1:41:18] gets to the top. When the full sons of
[1:41:20] God will be manifested, when the power
[1:41:22] of God will walk out. Hallelujah. He
[1:41:24] says, "And will take every
[1:41:27] power, every power that Satan has got
[1:41:30] away from him." Praise God. Amen. He
[1:41:33] said, "Yes, sir. It belongs to
[1:41:36] us. Amen. Doesn't belong to Satan. It
[1:41:40] belongs to us. Yes, it does. Thank you,
[1:41:42] Lord. Amen. Amen. What is that? That's
[1:41:45] following along with every thing that
[1:41:48] God gave this bride.
[1:41:50] Every promise that God gave this bride
[1:41:54] belongs to us. Yes. God's given to us.
[1:41:57] Now, we have every authority, every
[1:42:00] authority. Like we talked about last
[1:42:02] week in the Easter message, every
[1:42:04] authority to take every power that Satan
[1:42:09] has got away from him. Amen. Praise the
[1:42:12] Lord Jesus.
[1:42:13] Now, that's the authority of God. But
[1:42:16] it's based on God's perfect will. Not
[1:42:19] what I want done. Not what I want to see
[1:42:21] done. Not what I want to see happen, but
[1:42:23] what his perfect will is. In that
[1:42:26] instance, in that condition, we have the
[1:42:28] authority to take away every power that
[1:42:30] belong that that Satan has. Amen.
[1:42:34] Because it doesn't belong to Satan. He
[1:42:36] stole it in the beginning. Still belongs
[1:42:38] to us. Yes. Now, as God's manifesting
[1:42:41] these sons and daughters of God on the
[1:42:43] earth today, it's put back in their
[1:42:45] hands, in their control. That's why we
[1:42:47] said the other day, she gets to the
[1:42:49] place this bride will speak when he
[1:42:51] speaks or she will keep still. She will
[1:42:54] have thus sayeth the Lord or she will be
[1:42:56] silent. Yes. Amen. That's by the
[1:43:00] manifested sons of God. Praise the Lord.
[1:43:03] To do that perfect will of God. Look at
[1:43:06] this in Matthew. Matthew chapter
[1:43:15] 17. Matthew chapter 17 verse 14.
[1:43:30] Matthew
[1:43:32] 17:14 And when they were come to the
[1:43:35] multitude, there came to him a certain
[1:43:37] man kneeling down to him and saying,
[1:43:39] "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a
[1:43:42] lunatic and sore vexed, for all times he
[1:43:46] fall into the fire and off into the
[1:43:48] water." and I brought him to thy
[1:43:50] disciples and they could not cure him.
[1:43:54] The disciples who had been seven
[1:43:58] chapters earlier had been given the
[1:44:01] power by God by Jesus to cast out
[1:44:06] devils. You go read, I believe it's
[1:44:09] seven chapters earlier, Jesus gave them
[1:44:12] the power. Remember we read the other
[1:44:14] day where they ca where all of them came
[1:44:16] back rejoicing. Oh, they're they're
[1:44:19] subject last week. They're subject to us
[1:44:21] to thy name. Don't don't that. Yeah,
[1:44:24] that's true. But don't celebrate about
[1:44:26] that. Celebrate. Be happy because your
[1:44:28] name's written in the book of life,
[1:44:30] right? In heaven, he said. Amen. But now
[1:44:34] look, they had just been given that. But
[1:44:36] he brought the discip brought him to
[1:44:38] their disciples and they could not cure
[1:44:40] him.
[1:44:42] Then Jesus answered and said, "Oh
[1:44:44] faithless and perverse generation, how
[1:44:47] long shall I be with you? How long shall
[1:44:50] I suffer you? Bring him hither to
[1:44:53] me." And Jesus rebuked the devil and he
[1:44:58] departed out of him and the child was
[1:45:01] cured from that very hour. Something
[1:45:03] that he brought the disciples could not
[1:45:05] do, right? But yet they were given the
[1:45:08] power to do it. They were given the
[1:45:10] authority by Jesus to do it and they
[1:45:13] still couldn't do it. Oh, help us today.
[1:45:17] Amen. Help me, Lord, today.
[1:45:21] The child left and was cured from that
[1:45:22] very hour. Then came the disciples to
[1:45:25] Jesus apart and said, "Why could not we
[1:45:27] cast him out?" Jesus said unto them,
[1:45:29] "Because of your unbelief."
[1:45:31] And that's the worst curse. Amen.
[1:45:34] Unbelief. For verily I say unto you, if
[1:45:38] ye have faith as a grain of mustard
[1:45:40] seed, ye shall say unto this mountain,
[1:45:43] remove hence to yonder place, and it
[1:45:45] shall remove, and nothing shall be
[1:45:48] impossible unto you. That sounds a whole
[1:45:50] lot like what brother just said. Yes.
[1:45:54] Amen. That's exa that sounds exactly
[1:45:57] what like what he talked about that Adam
[1:45:59] had. It's exactly what he talked about
[1:46:01] was going to be restored back to the
[1:46:03] sons of God. It's exactly what we're
[1:46:05] looking for and expecting to happen
[1:46:07] today. It's exactly what brother
[1:46:09] Brandham said in taking away every power
[1:46:12] that Satan has. Praise God. Amen.
[1:46:16] Doesn't belong to him.
[1:46:19] Ye shall say to this mountain, move
[1:46:21] hence hence the yonder place. It shall
[1:46:24] remove and nothing shall be impossible
[1:46:26] unto you. Amen. Oh my. I We need to read
[1:46:31] that like every day for a whole year.
[1:46:33] Amen. Just read that. Believe it. How be
[1:46:36] it, this kind goeth not out, but by
[1:46:38] prayer and fasting. Prayer and not
[1:46:41] praying fast. Now, but praying and
[1:46:43] fasting.
[1:46:45] Look, I got my Bible thanks to brother
[1:46:47] Green. I still got my mustard seed here.
[1:46:52] He dumped a bunch of them in the Bible.
[1:46:54] You know, I thought, "Oh, those are all
[1:46:55] going to get lost." So, I took a whole
[1:46:57] bunch of them and I stuck them
[1:46:58] underneath my little sticker marker
[1:47:00] thing there so that they would stay. And
[1:47:02] still there. Amen. I don't know how long
[1:47:04] ago that was, but I got a bunch of them
[1:47:06] in there. So, Amen. I should have taken
[1:47:08] some out when the kids were here and
[1:47:10] given them to them. But,
[1:47:12] Amen. We know that that faith that lies
[1:47:15] in
[1:47:16] us is the faith to believe, the faith to
[1:47:20] speak, the power that God has shown that
[1:47:23] that that we have today. Amen. And the
[1:47:26] manifested sons of God. Yes.
[1:47:30] Let me read this.
[1:47:32] the these quote I'm sorry I'm getting
[1:47:33] late I was going to close these quotes
[1:47:35] are just too good to pass up
[1:47:38] but now the world the nature the world
[1:47:42] nature we just read it all of creation
[1:47:45] nature groaning
[1:47:47] crying everything's a moving what for
[1:47:50] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:47:53] when true sons born sons sons speak and
[1:47:58] their word is back.
[1:48:01] Praise the Lord. Amen. Look, friend, I
[1:48:04] don't I don't want to brag, but I'll
[1:48:06] brag on our congregation. U I said, I
[1:48:09] don't want to, and I'm going to anyway.
[1:48:11] Uh what used to be next door right
[1:48:14] there? Tattoo shopping. What did we do
[1:48:17] about it?
[1:48:20] Amen. What used to be over here?
[1:48:23] Smoke shop. What did we do? Amen.
[1:48:27] Amen. Where are they now?
[1:48:32] What what other results do we need? I'll
[1:48:35] come in here and lay my hands right
[1:48:36] there. Amen. Amen. What else do we need?
[1:48:40] What what other evidence are we looking
[1:48:42] for? Respect God moving. The people
[1:48:45] downstairs to me and my wife, they were
[1:48:49] uh rowdy a lot of times and hard to
[1:48:53] sleep sometimes and stuff and kind of
[1:48:55] noisy and kids and whatever else. And uh
[1:48:59] there was there's just one morning and I
[1:49:01] I I forgot what morning it was, but it
[1:49:04] just got all over me. Please forgive me.
[1:49:06] But I I bent down. I put my hands on the
[1:49:08] floor and I said, "They're gone. They've
[1:49:11] got to move out, Lord. That these people
[1:49:13] are they have got to move out." You know
[1:49:15] what they did? They sold our entire
[1:49:17] community to an a different
[1:49:20] organization and that person downstairs
[1:49:22] worked for them for the old one and they
[1:49:25] moved out. They're gone. Amen.
[1:49:29] I mean, what other proof do we need? I
[1:49:31] mean, that's just examples that I have
[1:49:32] right here that come to my mind that are
[1:49:34] just recent. I think about it in your
[1:49:36] own life, in your own Yes. Your your own
[1:49:40] power, authority, your own abilities.
[1:49:43] God has given that for us today. The
[1:49:45] manifested sons and daughters of God.
[1:49:48] Amen. It wasn't done I I didn't do it
[1:49:50] based on the fact that I didn't like the
[1:49:52] guys, either one of the guys. In fact,
[1:49:54] the guy over here I helped over with the
[1:49:56] electric and stuff and this he was a
[1:49:58] nice guy. He really was. But that wasn't
[1:50:02] going to stay there. It just wasn't.
[1:50:05] Especially with the music played and
[1:50:07] stuff. It just wasn't going to stay
[1:50:08] there. That one wasn't either. Now that
[1:50:10] guy was not a nice guy, but I didn't we
[1:50:13] didn't pray because of that. They just
[1:50:16] they could not stay here. Right. Amen.
[1:50:19] And now you notice that that place is
[1:50:23] not supposed to have anybody on Sundays.
[1:50:25] And they started having on Sunday. Then
[1:50:27] they started playing music. Did the same
[1:50:29] thing. Now I may not have announced it
[1:50:31] to the congregation, but I did the same
[1:50:33] thing. And now on Sundays, they come and
[1:50:35] still get haircuts, but they don't turn
[1:50:37] that music up anymore. You noticed?
[1:50:40] Amen. Why? Because you speak. Amen. You
[1:50:44] speak with authority of God's word. And
[1:50:46] it's not selfish.
[1:50:48] It's It's not something that you're
[1:50:50] being selfish at. I mean, I still say,
[1:50:52] "Lord, they have every right to have a
[1:50:54] business and make a living and have a
[1:50:56] job. That's perfectly fine. But they're
[1:50:58] not going to interfere with this." Yes.
[1:51:00] It just isn't going to happen. Amen. And
[1:51:02] if they are, they're going to go. Amen.
[1:51:06] And it stopped. So, God knows. But
[1:51:09] again, those are just a couple of things
[1:51:12] that I come to my remembrance that we
[1:51:14] know that we've done here, even just as
[1:51:16] a congregation. Amen. Amen. That you've
[1:51:19] done in your own life you think about.
[1:51:21] See, there's something there. Speak to
[1:51:24] it. Amen. I remember years ago uh when
[1:51:27] we lived in Florida, it was a brother,
[1:51:30] one of the brothers I I disagree with a
[1:51:32] lot on doctrine. I've talked about him
[1:51:33] before, but uh I believe he was a child
[1:51:36] of God. And we used to go sometimes to
[1:51:39] lunch and we'd go to this restaurant and
[1:51:42] um he told me how this restaurant
[1:51:44] treated him and how bad they were to
[1:51:46] him. and so on so forth, whatever. And
[1:51:48] he said that that place is going to go
[1:51:50] out of business. And it
[1:51:52] did. It did. It It wasn't long after
[1:51:55] that it went out of business. So God
[1:51:57] knows it's it's not it it it's not
[1:52:01] anything. We don't do this of
[1:52:03] selfishness.
[1:52:05] We don't do it for personal gain, right?
[1:52:08] We do it when the situation arises like
[1:52:10] that. And God's in control. God's in
[1:52:13] charge. But he is pleased to honor your
[1:52:16] word. Your word. Amen. Amen. And it has
[1:52:20] it it is our word. See, it's when the
[1:52:23] true sons, born sons, filled filled sons
[1:52:29] speak and their word is backed.
[1:52:33] Praise the Lord. We told you before
[1:52:36] about sometimes when our son would get
[1:52:39] picked on in
[1:52:40] school, a a boy
[1:52:43] in Florida in Cook. He was he was one of
[1:52:46] the worst that Mike had ever
[1:52:48] encountered. He was just
[1:52:50] relentless. And he would come home
[1:52:52] distraught. We'd go we we prayed
[1:52:55] together. Um and um that that same
[1:52:59] teacher, I believe it was, wanted to
[1:53:01] read the book Goosebumps to the school.
[1:53:04] And we didn't even know it. But Michael
[1:53:05] went up to the teacher and said, "My
[1:53:07] parents wouldn't want you reading that
[1:53:08] to me. I I don't want I don't hear." and
[1:53:11] she didn't read it. And then she went
[1:53:14] home, according to Micah, she went home
[1:53:16] and read the book and looked at it. So,
[1:53:18] and came back to class and told Micah,
[1:53:20] says, "You know what? After reading the
[1:53:21] book, you're right. I'm not going to
[1:53:23] read this to the class anymore." Amen.
[1:53:26] It's like the Harry Potter stuff and all
[1:53:28] that magic and all that. That's demonic,
[1:53:31] saints. That stuff is just demonical.
[1:53:34] Horrible to let kids and grandkids and
[1:53:36] whatever get mixed up in that. That's
[1:53:38] that stuff is evil, wicked, demonic.
[1:53:41] witchcraft, wickery, that's evil. Amen.
[1:53:45] But this boy, he was relentless. And we
[1:53:48] came and prayed and we said, "Lord, just
[1:53:50] help him to stop picking or whatever, do
[1:53:53] something different." Well, the boy had
[1:53:54] a motorcycle wreck and broke both his
[1:53:56] legs and was out of school, couldn't
[1:53:59] come back to school. When he finally
[1:54:01] came back, he was in a wheelchair and he
[1:54:02] was the nicest person to Micah you'd
[1:54:04] ever see. Amen. Now, we didn't we didn't
[1:54:07] ask God to tell him to crash a
[1:54:09] motorcycle and break his legs, but
[1:54:11] that's what happened. Amen. Mike got to
[1:54:14] go through the third grade in peace. But
[1:54:17] that's when you you speak the word. See,
[1:54:20] it's also training a child the way they
[1:54:22] should go. Amen. Let me finish this. I
[1:54:25] am going to
[1:54:28] close. Speak their word is back. I
[1:54:31] believe we're on the border. He says
[1:54:32] border of it right now. Of course, we
[1:54:34] knew it was already happening when he
[1:54:36] spoke this. It was already taking place
[1:54:39] and it's gotten to the place that it's
[1:54:41] even more so now. Yes, sir. Say to this
[1:54:44] mountain, "Certain thing be done. I'm
[1:54:46] believer in Jesus Christ. I give it to
[1:54:49] you in Jesus. In the name of G the Lord
[1:54:51] Jesus Christ, amen." There is a
[1:54:53] manifestation. Amen. Oh, brother, my
[1:54:56] crops are burning up over. I hadn't had
[1:54:58] any rain. I'll send you a rain in the
[1:55:00] name of the Lord God. Bless your crops.
[1:55:02] whole waiting groaning all nature
[1:55:05] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:55:07] sons of God. Oh, I got a couple more
[1:55:09] here that's
[1:55:12] just just working to put help us get to
[1:55:17] the place that we know who we are. Yes.
[1:55:19] In our placement in him. Amen. That we
[1:55:23] belong to the Lord. Our word is as good.
[1:55:26] Amen.
[1:55:30] God is
[1:55:31] honored to to honor our word. The word
[1:55:36] that we give is not is it's not again
[1:55:38] it's not something that we do of
[1:55:40] selfishness or self- gain or anything
[1:55:42] like that, but it's the word that God
[1:55:44] gives that we that we put that that that
[1:55:48] God honors. Amen. Amen. Our word, your
[1:55:51] word, that's that is the manifested sons
[1:55:55] of God. Yes. A lot of times we look
[1:55:58] around, we say, "Where's this and
[1:55:59] where's that?" And we forget so many
[1:56:00] times and we fail so many times to
[1:56:02] recognize what God's doing and what God
[1:56:05] has done for us. What God has just done
[1:56:06] in this little congregation and
[1:56:09] recognizing the the moving of the hand
[1:56:11] of God for us. Amen. It's true. But it's
[1:56:16] God honoring our word. Yes. Amen. I I
[1:56:20] didn't I I didn't I can't say that I got
[1:56:23] down on my knees and I prayed to God to
[1:56:25] do this. I just walked up the money and
[1:56:27] said, "You you've got to go in Jesus
[1:56:30] name. You've got to go." Amen. Amen.
[1:56:33] It's that simple. Speak it. Let God
[1:56:36] honor that word. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:56:40] Amen. Let's stand.
[1:56:53] Amen. Is God honoring that word? It's
[1:56:57] his word, but it's his word in us. We
[1:57:01] are in that position as manifested sons
[1:57:03] of God to let that word live in us and
[1:57:06] through
[1:57:07] us,
[1:57:08] manifesting through his bride today as
[1:57:12] the manifested sons of God. This is the
[1:57:14] manifesting time. Amen. God has given us
[1:57:17] that position, that place that we live.
[1:57:21] Amen. We live it for him. Praise the
[1:57:26] Lord.
[1:57:28] Amen. I was going to sing this sing this
[1:57:30] little chorus we sing so many times
[1:57:35] before.

[1:59:07] holy, tried and
[1:59:12] true, with
[1:59:17] thanksgiving. I'll be a

[1:59:41] me so that I
[1:59:44] might become him by grace.

[2:00:31] might become him by
[2:00:36] grace. Oh, could we sing it one more

[2:00:43] me so that I
[2:00:47] might become him by grace.
