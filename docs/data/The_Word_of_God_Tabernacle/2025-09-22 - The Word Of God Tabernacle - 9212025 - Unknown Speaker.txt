So many signs displayed. You're letting your bride know that you're coming for her soon. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. And Lord, I believe, like I've said before, if there was an angel that stood with a sign and and showed us that the coming of the Lord is near, still people won't repent. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Still people won't get right with God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As you told that gallant servant of yours, Joshua, he says, "The land is yours. Go possess it." &gt;&gt; Amen. But you've got to fight for every inch of ground. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; He didn't just say walk in and you'll have a picnic. &gt;&gt; He says, Joshua, there'll be enemies, &gt;&gt; but you'll defeat him if you stand with my word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you know that my spirit's with you, children of God, today, the promises of God are ours. &gt;&gt; But it's not going to be handed to us. Yes, &gt;&gt; we must fight for every inch of bellus &gt;&gt; and claim the promises that we have need of in our lives. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord help us. &gt;&gt; I know that &gt;&gt; that there are some that might say, "Well, I've come to perfection. &gt;&gt; Our time of perfection is when these bodies are changed. &gt;&gt; There's no shortcuts. There's no easy roads." &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. No, there's no hope pass that you can just make it, you know, so easy. &gt;&gt; I heard your prophet a couple of days ago says my worst enemy is William Brandom. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If I can get William Brandon out of the way, I know, Lord, that you can use me for your honor and glory. &gt;&gt; Yes, Father. And Lord, that speaks to our hearts even that much more because you use brother Brandham to bring a message, a word that'll get a bride ready for rapure. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Humble us, Father. Help us to recognize the littleer we get, the more bigger you can become in our lives. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Lord, there are needs in our church, in our little congregation this morning. For we know there's some that need a healing touch. My brother Danny, my wife who's nervous about her surgery. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amanda, Lord, with her eye appointment coming up and all the other niece maybe I've overlooked, Lord, at the patch, our sister going to rehabilitation with her hip surgery. For we know you are our loving God, a great physician that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And by your strip, we are healed. &gt;&gt; And we claim it, Father, for your honor and for your glory. Thank you, Lord, &gt;&gt; that your children have possessed the land and they're going to stand on your word and claim the promises, the healing, the deliverance, Lord, that they have need of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lord, this is a burden in my heart. &gt;&gt; There's some that are not ready, &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's time to seek you for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's not time to play games with you. We can put a facade that we're in the message, but that's not it at all. &gt;&gt; It's having that token, that life living in Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; that speaks for itself, a written epistle read and known of all men. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, all the unspoken prayer requests that hands that lifted up, may you grant them their harsh desire. May their cup runth over with your blessings, Father. &gt;&gt; Grant it God. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless our pastor as he brings forth your word. &gt;&gt; May we be uh recipients that are hungry and thirsting for your righteousness, knowing that we shall be filled. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, in your name we pray, name the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You can be seated if you'd like. Amen. Lord Jesus, he's so good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's turn over to Psalm numbers 51. We'll have it on the screen here. Amen. Glory to his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Micah sent me a uh a testimony. I wanted to go ahead and read that now. &gt;&gt; Amen. He sent me a testimony yesterday. He wanted me to read to everyone this morning. So, I can find it here. Uh Micah says, he said, "Our agency, you know, insurance agency he works at. Our agency had a 10th anniversary celebration Thursday and it was forecasted to rain earlier on in the day. Sean, the owner uh kept saying in case it rains or when it rains. I told her the first time she said it those phrases that no, it's not going to rain until we're done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I expected, it did not start drizzling until seven. the time set for our celebration to end. At the end of the night, she sent a text to all of us employees thanking them uh and to thank Micah for help uh for helping to manifest uh the word that she used of no rain. &gt;&gt; Uh Sean is a professing Christian, but this particular situation allowed me to teach her to speak things in faith out loud. So much that she mentioned it in the text to all of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Uh just being an example. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just being a written epistle, &gt;&gt; being a living disciple. Yes. &gt;&gt; Being Christ on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Shining his light through us, letting him use us. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's wonderful. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I enjoyed that. It's a good testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. just not not a God of the history, not a God of the Bible, but a living God of today. That's what we need to be producing, a living God of today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So, great example. A lot of times people say, "Well, I don't want to say that because what if it does and uh people say then they lose their faith or whatever." No, speak it and have faith. Just trust God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Has God ever failed you? God doesn't fail us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. I believe that. So, Micah put it on display and we're thankful to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Songs number 51. Amen. In the book, have it on the screen here. Songs number 51. Down. Glory to his name. Amen.

So thankful we know him in his power of his resurrection and his glory and we worship him. Amen. Thank you Jesus. Amen. Let's go ahead and stand if we could turn in our Bibles. Amen. You want to have a a prayer or a testimony? something on your heart today you'd like to mention &gt;&gt; that. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.

Amen. Praise the Lord. God is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. For blessing us with another through another week. Amen. Helping us to be here today. Praise the Lord. Let's turn over in the Bible now to Romans chapter 8. Amen. We're going to after last week go back to our adoption series. This will be adoption part 27 and the subtitle is what is in a name. What is what is in a name? Amen. Praise the Lord. Romans chapter 8. We're just going to read 14-1 17 here. Romans 8:14-17. Amen. Before we do, let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could. Precious Jesus, what a wonderful time it is, Lord. to worship you, just to glorify and praise your holy name. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just to mention that name, Lord God, to know and hear even uh people and know throughout the world, throughout this country, that your precious holy name is taken in vain probably more than it is worship today. &gt;&gt; But Lord, we want you to know that we say that name, we call out that name, we sing that name, it's in worship, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's in glorification. is to praise you, Father. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want to be there on that day, filthy and dirty, coming before your throne to bow down to call you Lord. Lord, I want to call you Lord. I want to worship you as Jesus, Lord of all today, &gt;&gt; oh God, and let our voices ring out to you Jesus because you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. You are Lord. You are the almighty God. You are the El Shadi, Lord. You are our alpha, Omega. You're beginning, ending. You're everything to us, Lord. God, we thank you so much for the blessings of this service and for these people, Lord, for those who may be watching today. We thank you, Lord, for this word and Father, for the truth and the revelation of this word. So many people can talk about this word and try to discuss this word and try to debate this word and criticize it, but Lord, it takes revelation from you, God. and revelation of that word and revelation to know who you are. We cannot even know you without revelation, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we thank you for that today. We thank you for l Lord your people God and to be a part of that family, the precious family of God, Lord. We pray you continue to move on every request, every need, everything that was spoken, each one that's here, God, and in our hearts as we worship and thank you. Lord, coming to this place now as we've opened up this precious holy rit, God, looking forward to you to speak to us through it. Lord, show us in here what you'd have us to know today. We commit it to you and ask your blessings upon it now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 8 and then we'll start with verse 14. Romans 8:14. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, aba, father. The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God. And if children, then hes, heirs of God and joint hes with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. Praise the Lord. You can be seated if you'd like. Amen. I want to uh I want to go back on one thing that we mentioned last week uh with the uh with the thing the Lord gave us. Matthew 25. Amen. I found out or heard this week through the news. Uh remember my my whole premise basically for last week's message was that foolish virgin in Matthew 25. and brother Brandham exhorting us to watch for that too to see uh when that nominal church goes after that oil. Amen. That's when the bridegroom came. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And I heard uh so u with the Lord's help and blessing last week. I went with that thought and a couple of the scriptures. But I found out this week now that when uh this man uh as you all probably know now, his name was Charlie Kirk. uh when he was assassinated, he started when he was 18 years old, he started an organization called Turningpoint USA. It was to be a conservative organization to reach out to mostly young people to try to get them to conservative values and even Christianity if he could. &gt;&gt; Yes. uh to try to turn this country back into a a man and a wife, not two men, not two women, but a man and a wife with children and a family, right? &gt;&gt; Uh and g uh uh uh uh our our Christian values. Amen. Uh to go back to the way the country was founded and built. Uh so when he was uh assassinated the other week uh there was he had actually in cities around the country he had 32 chapters of uh Turning Point USA that's headquarters 3,200 headquarters across the country and uh and and on uh uh college campuses around the country. Uh I found out maybe it was yesterday I can't I think it was yesterday I heard on the news that there are now remember what we told you about this how this is going to unfold uh what I really believe strong and really a lot of the foundation behind what uh the message is about last week in Matthew 25 uh about how this was going to explode into something that was going to bring this to a forefront that was that was going to I think be a beginning of or or a real strong push, let's just say, of that Matthew 25 of the of that nominal church going after that oil. Found out yesterday, remember 30 when he was killed, he had 3,200 3,200 chapters. As of yesterday, I found out by the news that there are now 65,000 new requests to start Turning Point chapters in this country. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; He had 3,000 from 18 years old to 31 years old. He had established 3,200 in the country. 3,200. Now, since his passing, just a little over a week, there's 65,000. Not 6,500, 65,000 requests to start a chapter of Turning Point in this country. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You talk about an explosion. I don't even know the math of that. Uh, somebody smarter than me is going to have to come up with what from 3,200 to 65,000 is request. They probably can't even honor them all. But the point of that is is showing the fervor of these people. showing the fervor of these nominal Christians, of these people out there wanting to push into this, wanting to get I I guess what they like to call revival uh out and get it sweeping across the nation. Friend, to me, that just fulfills script. I think that's just that's just fulfilling of scripture when you see that happen. And like I said, brother Random exhorted us to see that. And uh he thought it was happening during that time with him here. But you see what's going on now today, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; 65,000. &gt;&gt; That's that just that number astounded me. I thought it was worth bringing your attention today, especially after what the Lord had gave me and what we spoke last week on this really taking off and exploding into something that So, when you see all these things unfolding, friend, it just it just really ought to sober us. &gt;&gt; It it it really ought to wake us up. It really should get down in our hearts to say we we need to get to business with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we've just been floundering around with our experience and flounding around with, well, do we have the Holy Ghost, not have the Holy Ghost, floundering around with, you know, flirting with the world a little bit or, you know, kind of in, kind of out and uh, you know, which, you know, lukewarm is the most miserable place a person could be. Yes. Even God said, "I would rather you were cold or hot," &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; than lukewarm. It's just the most miserable place you can be to try to be a Christian and then flirt around in the world and stuff and all all this stuff. It's time to get down to what do they call brass tax &gt;&gt; to to say this is this is the time. This it it is here. Uh I I talked last week too about uh um uh about flying over the salt and sea and having taken pictures of it. Yesterday I flew right over top of it. I mean our plane literally split. I mean it was right over top the way the and it just it hit me so strong. I couldn't hardly contain myself on the airplane looking out the window and knowing we flew right over it &gt;&gt; and seeing that and and I had just listened uh when I was working last week and a tape that brother Brandon was reiterating uh that prophecy that went forth when he was in California on that choosing of a bride &gt;&gt; and he was going through that and talking about the salt and sea and then two or three days later I'm flying right up right over top of it. It just to me these things aren't coincidences. &gt;&gt; These things aren't just happening in a vacuum, friend. This this is real. This is going on. This is happening right now. And I don't know what else I can say or do that would help us grasp more of of we're at the end. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This thing is is winding up. It's it's it's at the end time. It's we're finishing it, friend. &gt;&gt; Yes. and and and and and that time is uh I I don't know how much more time it is. I'm not trying to prophesy, but uh from what I feel in my spirit and what I see going on, friend, and I see more scripture fulfilling, it just it just ought to sober us. Like I said, it ought to wake us up. It ought to bring us to a place to say, Lord, uh you know, this this uh I I I mean business today, Lord. &gt;&gt; I mean business with you, Lord. Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's uh it it's happening, friend. And um if it doesn't happen today, I'm looking for him tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if it doesn't happen this week, I'm looking for him next week. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; If it doesn't happen next this month, I'm looking for him next month. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever it is, however it is, it just u it's that time. Amen. It's that it it's that time to uh to make sure we know that we know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That we know that we know. Not to mention the fact that the world is getting more and more dangerous all the time, too. But the Lord takes care of us and watches over us. So, let's get down to this message I want to speak on today. Now, &gt;&gt; what's in a name? Amen. &gt;&gt; What is in a name? Let's go over to uh St. Luke uh chapter 1. Read in St. Luke chapter 1. Praise the Lord. I want to read a few verses of scripture here. St. Luke chapter 1 to bring a little bit more light on maybe the songs we sang uh today. St. Luke chapter 1. Let's begin reading with verse 24 if we could. St. Luke 1:24. And after those days, his wife Elizabeth conceived and hid herself five months, saying, Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among men. Now that's Elizabeth hiding conceived and then hid herself five months. 26th verse. Now, and in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in and uh in unto her, and said, "Hail, thou are thou that are highly favored. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his say, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. The angel said unto her, "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favor with God." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; "And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's very specific. Now, it's one thing to to know that God would place in Mary the seed, the germ, to bring forth life from Mary, having known no man. That's one thing. But look and see how specific it was that the angel made sure to know that when this baby came forth that his name would be Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a reason reason why he was to be Jesus. Amen. You can have babies born all the time. You think well uh God did something by bringing uh bringing him into this world. Amen. And they could have named him anything they wanted to, but it had to be specific. A very specific name. The name Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's why he specified his name is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, why was that important? Because the name means something. &gt;&gt; Your name means something, friend. Your name labels you in this earth. Your name gives you a character in this earth. Amen. And there was a reason why that he had specifically to call his name Jesus. He shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest. And the Lord shall give unto him the throne of his father David. And we know he'll be sitting on the throne of David in the millennium. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever. And of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then Mary said unto the angel, "How shall this be? I know not a man. The angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that the holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. Amen. He shall be called the son of God. Look at the scripture now, especially for people that deal with trinitarians. He shall be called the son of God, but he was of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost overshadowed Mary, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, who is the Holy Ghost? The spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like your spirit. If your spirit came out of your body, that would be the spirit of new men. If his spirit could come out, it was the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It wasn't the third God. It wasn't a third godhead in the Trinity. is just simply the spirit of God, the Holy Ghost. That's why he can say, "Well, he was the the son of God, but he was of the Holy Ghost." Why? Because same thing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's still God. &gt;&gt; What did he do? It's just like you being a son or daughter of God, just like being a child of God. He took that part of him, that germ seed of life, that thought attribute that he had of you before the foundation of the world when you came forth and placed that inside you. That's what made you a part of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not your flesh, not your spirit, not any part of your human being, but that spirit of God, that seed of God that was placed in you that made you as much God as it did Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus is just born a virgin birth, sinless birth. We were born in sin, shape, iniquity, come to the world, speaking lies. But that seed that was in you, Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That is God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That if you ever been a part of God, if you ever had eternal life, it had to be because the seed of God is in you. Because God is the only form of eternal life. And if God is the form of eternal life, then that seed is is eternal life. And that sea that's in you is as eternal as God is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's his life &gt;&gt; in you. Amen. It's not three gods. It's not two gods. It's one God. Yes. &gt;&gt; He's just expressing himself as son to come to save your s soul. God expressing himself in his spirit of the Holy Ghost to come and live in you and God almighty. It's the same is is God himself. Praise the Lord. Brother Aaron said, "It's not it's not God one like your finger. He's not one like your finger." Because if he's one like your finger, well, then where do you get with the Holy Ghost to or the sunship? Where's the sunship and the spiritship of God if he's one like your finger? No, he God separates himself out because he he's God. He can do that. Amen. He can take of his thought and put it in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's like in the natural, just think in the natural. If if someone comes and uh let's say they write a book or they write a song and and that that song or that book or that phrase, that quote in that book came from their intellect. It came from their uh spirit. It came from them as an original thought. Nobody else had ever had that thought in the history of humanity. Uh there's people in this country that have patented things like that. Uh I remember years and years ago uh carnally speaking years and years ago there was a coach of a basketball team, the NBA team, and his team had won the the championship two years in a row and they were going for a third time. they were in the championship and they were going to win uh they they were looking to win the third championship in a row. So he got on air and I don't know original thought nobody had ever heard it before. Nobody had ever said it before. Nobody had ever coined the phrase as you'd say coining a phrase. He said on on broadcast, "We're going to three." You know, he copy wrote that word and anybody that broadcast that word out in the public has to pay him royalties. 3P just that word copyright because it was something that came from from him, from his intellect, from his from his mind. It's it's a thought. Now somebody else can catch that same thought and and be in the same position and use the same word 3P. Why? Because it came from it came from this person. This person had that thought. He expressed that thought and that thought come into another person and that person became that thought and he said the word 3P could be the same as a song or a book a quote or something that that comes forth and it's a thought and it's a thought of a person and that person's thought goes forth and is expressed &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and when that person's thought is expressed it goes into people's intellect, into their ears, into their mind, into their spirit. And that thought that may have been originated by this person, by that quote, that thought comes into another person's spirit and it becomes a part of that person, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because now that person has received that thought. And if they express that thought, it's just going out and expressing to someone else what that lyric of that song was or what that quote of that book was or what that word somebody says was is an expression of that. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Well, friend, all you are is an expression of God Almighty. You're a thought expressed. &gt;&gt; God shared that thought. God manifested that thought. And God brought that thought into you. And now you become that word expressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as you come forth and you express God, it's God in flesh all over again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God using you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To express that thought, to express those words. That's just God doing the same as he did here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, we lose such track of it, friend. Because we want to make it so much differenter, so much a a part of religion, if you will. You're just as much a part of God there a as anybody &gt;&gt; as God himself because God put himself in you. &gt;&gt; You're the expression of that original thought. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; God expressing to you now. You're living it because it's who you are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You are God in flesh. God bringing to this earth a flesh body. He he expressed that thought in the womb of Mary. And that thought came flesh in the womb of Mary. And that that thought was birthed forth out of of Mary's womb and expressed into the world. &gt;&gt; And that flesh grew up as the son of God. Yes. &gt;&gt; As Jesus Christ or Jesus, his name was Jesus. We call him Christ as the anointed one because Christ means the anointed. And he was that expression, an earthly expression of God. Now, why did God have to bring an earthly expression of Jesus of himself on this earth through a woman? Why couldn't he just speak like he did in the beginning and speak say there's Jesus and bring him from the dust of the earth? Because Jesus had to come forth just like you and I to be a kinsman redeemer to be able to redeem us back. &gt;&gt; Amen. He could not be a kinsman redeemer and been a created being. He had to be a being that was born of flesh and blood of a woman just like you and I were. &gt;&gt; But he had to come in a sinless form to take our sins away. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's the only way he could. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To come our arbitrator, to become our mediator, to become our savior, to become our God, to become our Jesus Christ anointed in flesh. so that we could receive him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So that they then could touch him, could handle him, could feel him. He even told Thomas when Thomas was doubting that it was him, he said, "Come, come thrust your finger in my side." They could feel him, they could touch him. But he had to come through Mary to express himself to for God to express himself in the form of a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. so that he would be called the son of God. Jesus. Praise the Lord. Jesus. &gt;&gt; And there's just something about that name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know it is. I know when I was a young boy, Amen. Uh Gabriel, don't listen to this. When I was a young boy, uh I I I I could be a I I was influenced by my friends and people around me. And uh we went to church, went to a Baptist church for years. And uh when I got to I forgot 12, 13, whatever it was, we started going to a message church, but went to a Baptist church and I was young and uh very influenced by all the friends and stuff. And I I could be a rascal and I may have said this before, but uh I was plug ears. I told you I was voted the worst custer on my street or best custer. I don't know what that how do they call that? Best worst. I call it worse now. They probably called it best. It's not when I was a kid. You're the You're the best one at this. No, I was the worst. I was It was bad. But I know But I know because my my friends would challenge me. I This I have a hard time even saying this, but I just want to make a point. I I I when I would get to a place that they would challenge me to uh to just use foul language, just one thing after just one word after another. And I and and and I did. I mean, I'm 10 years old, whatever it was, just a little kid, and on and on and on. And because in in the young in my young years, even though we went to a Baptist church, well, I mean, we we were just we were just lost as loss could be, you know, I mean, we were uh we ended up spending a lot of weekends going out on the boat and naked and my parents drinking beer and whatever. And we were just it just, you know, we that just the way we lived. Amen. Which actually I look at today and I think that was pretty tame compared to what you see today. But anyway, uh and and any time that and and it really only happened once that I can remember anyway that I it they my friends would challenge me and I I would just excuse me I'm sorry but I would just start cussing just one word after the other just throwing them out just as fast as I could throw them and all of a sudden I took the Lord's name in vain And as soon as I did that, and as soon as that came out of my mouth, I stopped because something came over me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Kind of the feeling I got right now, something came over me and I never did that again. I was voted the best, worst, whatever on the street. I never said that again. Even as a little kid, even as a vile kid influenced by I never said something when I said when it came out of mouth, I stopped. I that was it. I quit. Something came over me and I just walked away. I didn't know what it was. I mean, I was just a little kid. I know what it was now. &gt;&gt; I didn't know then, but it was God speaking to me. It was God telling me. It was God's spirit showing me, "No, you you're not going to say that. Don't you say that. And and and I took it seriously. And I'm uh I I I never said that again. Amen. I'm not saying I didn't still use foul language as I was growing up as a little kid here and there, but that ended my reign, if you will, of being the best quote worst cusser on the street because uh that ended that. But it was just it was just the enveloping of that spirit that came over me when that happened. It just overtook me. &gt;&gt; When I took that precious name in vain, it it it did something to me, saints. It did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It it it from that moment on really that I can remember made a difference in my life. Um and and and it and it changed me. Thank God for the better. It changed me to take that precious that precious name. Amen. In vain. And you hear it all the time. I hear people say it all the time. You hear it all over the place. Especially if you go around in restaurants and uh shopping and through airports and stuff like that. You hear people take the name of the Lord in vain all the time. I do. Uh it vexes my heart. But I I hear it. Uh especially when you go through like a place like LA like I did yesterday. Just looking at the people in the airport of LA made me realize I do not ever want to live in LA. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh that that that place is as vile and disgusting and anyway, but taking that name, it would just it just did something to me cuz there's something about that name, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. There's something about that name. What's in that name? That name to us, it's precious. Now look, it's not just the name that he named. Let's go over to Ephesians now. It's not just a name that name there that Gabriel came and told Mary. Amen. And notice Mary's name. Mary for a reason. Right. Just like Joseph. Joseph for a reason. But that name that the way that name was was uh was brought forth was mentioned in the spec the specific way that it was supposed to be that uh Gabriel had gave her those instructions. But now look, not not just the thing I want to get to to is not just that name, his name, no o on him, but look what the scripture says. Uh Ephesians chapter 3, uh let's begin with verse 13. Ephesians 3:13. Wherefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is for your glory. For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named. The whole family of God in heaven and earth is named after Jesus. Did you see that? the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So you say, well, uh, you're the bride of Jesus Christ. That makes us miss Jesus. Well, it also this makes us Jesus, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That name, that name, his name is given to all the family of heaven and earth. Our family, we're part of the family of God. And that family we're a part of, Amen. is that name that's given unto us. Amen. So when you say God, I'm a reflection of God. I'm a reflection of Christ. Miss Jesus, God on earth, reflecting that spirit, living that life, being that example, being that written epistle read of all men, being the one that God looks to to express that spirit on this earth today in that name, to express that name. For that name, the name of Jesus. Jesus is our savior. That name of Jesus that brings with it the all of the power of heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All the family of God. Not all of earth. Now, it doesn't say all of earth. It says all of the family of heaven and earth. The whole family. Amen. Not everybody's a part of this family. Praise the Lord. Not everybody's a part of that name. Not everybody is called by that name. Amen. Just that name. by that family. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You'd call it, I guess in the world today, you call it the patriarch. The male of a family that begins or has a generation that comes out from under it like a family tree. You got a patriarch and a matriarch. Patriarch's father, matriarch's the mother, and out from it comes a family tree. Has some kids and kids have kids, them kids have kids, and by the time you get to the bottom is, you know, just a huge big conglomeration of people. But you started with a patriarch. &gt;&gt; Amen. That family, that family, all the family of God, heaven and earth, is named Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus, which means Jehovah Savior. Jehovah, God, Savior. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And people say, "Well, there's Jesus." And and I like there there's this song that the Gaither uh uh vocal band sings that uh I forgot the name of it, but it expresses a lot of the attributes of Jesus Christ and it gets like to the one of the last or the last uh part of it and they say he's the second person in the Trinity. Of course, when I sing it, I change it to he is God Almighty, but they call it the second person in the Trinity. When you get and you break Jesus out from being God, then all you have is just another human being, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He's if he's not God, then what is he? &gt;&gt; And if he's a lesser God, if he's the second person, you got a first person and a second person, then what does that make your family tree look like? How many patriarchs do we have up there? Amen. We have one. He's the patriarch of the family of God. That family comes forth because he is Jehovah God Almighty Jesus savior &gt;&gt; to bring salvation to the human race. That's why his name is Jesus. It expresses not just who he is but God veiled in flesh Jehovah. But it also expresses his purpose of being here to be savior. &gt;&gt; He's God savior Jesus. It's no wonder Gabriel made a specific example of why he needed to be named that name because of Jehovah Savior. I like when we had our children. My wife, I be honest, my wife, she went to prayer about our kids' names. Amen. I didn't so much honestly because I busy working and stuff and she worked too. But um she took it so seriously and prayed. That's that's how Tabitha Faith got her name and how uh uh uh Mike and Nathaniel got his name that because of her. I agreed with them obviously because they were I felt in my spirit that that was something that the Lord uh was was pleased with and scriptural and that meant a lot to me. But there's there's there's so much to that name that expresses that person and that person's nature, who that person is as a person. Just like excuse me, the name Jesus expresses who he is, his characteristics, who he was growing up, what his purpose was, God, savior, Jehovah, savior, Jesus. That's who he is. Amen. These names mean something. Look at this. Let me read this to you. Uh I'm get moving a little bit ahead, but that's all right. I'm just trying to do what the Lord tells me to do. &gt;&gt; This is actually the last the last quote I was going to read today. But look at this. Said, "Now God's gifts always find their place." 1963. Now, how many times names in the Bible, we don't notice it no more today. You've often heard me scorn this name of children calling uh people calling their children Ricky. And unfortunately my my my brother's name was Richard. And the nickname of Richard is Ricky. And when my when and they used to tell me when my uh uh when they were young, my my brother was growing up because I I was way younger than my brother growing up and with cousins and stuff, they had three that were named uh uh like Ricky and anyway, and they had a little rhyme to it and they c they actually called him Ricky. And when I read this now, I think, oh my, why didn't we why did they change his name? Didn't know any better. Amen. didn't know any better. But look, Brother Bam says people calling their children's names Ricky. Now Ricky is a horrible name. You mustn't call them that. If you've got a child named Ricky, for goodness sake, change that name to something else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ricky or Elvis or something like that. He said Ricky means rat. The name Ricky means rat again. Yeah. Why would you want to call your kid a rat? Ricky means rat. See? And so you go and what you call a person. Now what you call a person that expresses that a little lady the other day had a little boy out here called his name Ricky. Uh James Ricky because it was so popular. I guess back in that day Ricky was popular. Ricky Nelson and uh sports star music stars whatever named Ricky was a popular name. He said Ricky was a popular name. This boy lady named James Ricky. And because it was so popular, they called him Ricky. I told her, "Change that name." Amen. And I noticed some people sitting here right now has got a little grandson. One uh one uh let's see, he skips over. That's that's got a little grandson. And his name is the one one little boy's a sweetest pleasant little fella. And the other one is a Ricky. And that's what he is. His name is Ricky. Brother said that's exactly what he is. You just watch him as nature just like that. I said to some of his grandparents or someone I said tell the mother to change that boy's name. &gt;&gt; Just change that name over and watch what happens to that kid. See, you people don't want to believe that. We still think we live uh too long for that. But there is something in a name. &gt;&gt; He said, there is something in a name. Then why as long if there's nothing in a name, and we're going to get to this in just a minute. He said, why if there's nothing in a name, why, as long as Jacob was called Jacob, he was a suppler, a deceiver, and he was, that's what he was. But when he wrestled with the Lord all night and the Lord changed his name to Jacob, Jacob being a prince before God, he became that, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he became. He went from uh being suppler and deceiver to being uh Israel, a prince before God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; See, God changed his name. He had to have a name change. Praise the Lord. You look at Abraham. Let's just look at a few of these since I've got them written down here. We gone through the name of Jesus and we talked about the name. didn't have to have a name change there because the very important specific instructions from Gabriel was to call him Jesus. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. No other name, no other name under heaven where man could be saved. Amen. &gt;&gt; Colossians says, "All that you do, all that you do in word or in deed, do all in the name of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. Me and my wife got married in a Methodist church where her parents went to church. To this day, I have no idea why. I guess because they were paying for it. I don't know. But it's tradition that the bride's wife paid for the wedding, but it's the groom's uh excuse me, it's the bride's dad that pays for the wedding or the bride's family that pays for the wedding. It's the groom's family dad that pays for the minister. That pays the minister. That was tradition. I don't know how that goes now, but that when when we got married 40 years ago, that was tradition. That's been a whole generation. Good grief. Where did the time go? Um 40 years ago, it was tradition then. So my dad um her parents didn't care. But when my dad went up to pay the minister now he's a Methodist minister did a good sermon a ceremony. It it was a nice wedding nice ceremony uh and all that went with it and things. He just read it out of the book. I got the book the star book of ministers out there right now. I can tell you exactly what he said because he read it out of the book. But it was it was a fine wedding. But my dad, when he went to pay him before the wedding, when we were in the back room, he went to pay him. He told that man, he said, "Now when you you when you unite them, you unite them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the man looked at him and said, "What do you mean?" He said, "Don't you say father, son, holy ghost." He said, "You say you unite them. You marry them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." Amen. What the Lord has joined together, what the Lord has joined together, let no man put us under. Now, some random father or some random uh son or some random when what the Lord has put together. Amen. Let no man put us under. He said, "You say the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." We got the video. And I mean, my dad was paying him. What was he going to say? No. I mean, he took the money. He took my dad's money. uh and we got the video when he united us and when he joined us together as husband and wife he said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord I didn't know anything about it I didn't I wasn't even concerned about it but my dad was smart enough to know my dad had enough God to know when you marry them and you bring them unite them in the name of the Lord Jesus why do people they want to seem to want to do and worship the Lord Jesus and it comes all these other things and all these other churches and they'll worship and they'll call on the name of Jesus and they'll worship Jesus and and and they'll uh use that name over and over again and worship and different things. When they come to baptize somebody, they don't use the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, when I look at my Bible, you can look at Colossians 3:17 if you want to. Right now it says all that you do in word or in deed do in the name and I might be paraphrasing a little bit do in the name of the Lord Jesus or Jesus Christ. It doesn't say do all but baptize. It doesn't say when you come to baptize somebody it's okay to use titles. It doesn't say that. It says all that you do in word or deed. Baptism is one of the three ordinance deeds left to us. Baptism, foot washing, and communion. Amen. All you do in word or deed, doing the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But when you get to that point, they want to omit the name of Jesus. And you see because of the power of that name, because of the the the power that that name generates, why Satan has tried so hard for over for almost 2,000 years to get rid of that name, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; To snuff that name out. &gt;&gt; They brought that Catholic church in Nia Rome up to the forefront. What was one of the first things they did was to eradicate the name of Jesus, &gt;&gt; right? trying to get rid of the name of Jesus and bring in father, son, holy ghost. Titles, things that mean nothing. Brother Vanam says evil spirits travel in those titles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Evil spirits. You want to be baptized under the banner of an evil spirit? Not me. In name in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. all that you do in word or deed because it's that name that saves. Nobody can be saved outside of that name. Well, if baptism is a process point of salvation because baptism gets you to receiving the Holy Ghost, why would you why would you want to eliminate the name of Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It just does. There is it makes absolutely no scriptural sense to try to take the name of Jesus out of that. I I probably told the story here. Me and my I think you went with Did you go with me to when me and Brother Wayne went to that Baptist church? I I don't think maybe it was just me and I my good friend uh brother Wayne King went to our church there in Florida. He had a friend he was a lineman power company. His friend invited him to come and uh go to these meetings at a Anastasia Baptist church and he mentioned it on Sunday. I said, "I'll go with you." He said, "Okay." So, me and him, I think it was just the two of us. We went on one night, I forgot, Friday night, Saturday night, whatever it was. We went to one of these meetings and of course we got there early. We were we were in the chair because that's that's what you do. We got there early for church and it was almost empty and we're like, "Is there church tonight?" And a couple people are around. They're like, "Yeah, there's church tonight." Where is everybody? Because it's a big church, you know. It's a Baptist church. I've never known of a real Baptist church denomination like that being small. Uh there's usually hundreds of people. We got there, of course, you know, people started filtering in and they started coming down the aisles. Just coming down the aisles. Oh, hey Bobby. How you doing over there? I said, "How you?" You know, and and they're coming down the aisle and said, "Oh, I hadn't seen you in a long time. How you been over there?" And they're just in the in the middle of church. I'm sitting there trying to read my Bible or pray, I can't remember. And they're out there yelling and screaming to each other all over the congregation, all over the in inside the sanctuary, &gt;&gt; just yelling and screaming to each other, running back and forth to go greet people and stuff. And I don't have a problem with greeting people, but there's a vestibule for a reason. There's a fellowship hall for a reason, right? &gt;&gt; Not the sanctuary. Amen. I I mean, I I was I was waiting for somebody to break out a hot plate and start cooking some beans or something. I didn't know what they were going to do in that time. It was just a free-for-all. &gt;&gt; It's like, what what sanctity is to this? What reverence is there into in any all of this? Amen. and I went and had the entire service and in the entire sermon of course they had a contemporary band and contemporary music and stuff and okay it's not my thing I I don't worship to that uh sometimes I'll listen to music that may be a little more contemporary like but not a whole lot I definitely don't like the rock and roll stuff and jazz and all that but uh you know so but in church is the contemporary thing and you know they got a band going and every song they thing, every thing that was spoke, every prayer that was had, everything that was spoke by the minister, by the preacher, the name Jesus was not mentioned one time. I listened for it. Honestly, I listened for it. I do not remember because I remember coming out there and I remember thinking of coming up to end of that service and I poked brother Wayne. I think I told him. I'm like, they have not said the name Jesus one time in this entire service. No song. All the songs they sang, they were worship songs, but they never called the name Jesus. It was, you know, general platitudes to a god or something that people make Satan their god. But, you know, general platitudes, but there's something about that name when you call that name Jesus. I'm not saying every song has to say the name Jesus, but uh there should be something. But all these things, all the songs they sing, they came and had prayer for different things like the the uh uh prayer request or the u offering that was given and stuff like that. And they had prayer and ne nobody ever said in the name of Jesus Christ. Not at all. And it was right at the end they had the senior pastor senior pastor come up and close the service in prayer. And I and I I think I remember telling Wayne, I said, "Brother Wayne, they haven't mentioned that name one time." Senior senior pastor got up there and he prayed for the service at the end of the service. And at the very last thing that he said at the end of his prayer was in Jesus' name. Finally, one time in the entire service of everything, songs, prayers, every they didn't even close the other prayers in Jesus' name. I don't know why, but they didn't. Because what is it? It's the devil trying to eradicate the name Jesus, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He's trying to do it from your life. He's trying to do it from everything because he knows the power that is coming that comes and follows with the name Jesus. &gt;&gt; The name was spoken in the Bible the first time a little boy came to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, how much power can you think that name carries behind it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Savior, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's power in that name. &gt;&gt; That's why we baptize in that name. That's why all that we do in word or in deed, we do in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because that's what the scripture says. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. No other he no other name in heaven where man could be saved but that precious name, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at the Bible. You think why does it matter? Jacob, Jacob was named Jacob when he was born. Jacob means suppler, deceiver. God came and changed his name to Israel. As we said, prince with God. God changed his name. He had to change his name. Amen. He wasn't going to be associated with a deceiver, suppler. Amen. He's associated with a prince. A prince before God. Simon. Simon's name. Uh uh uh he has heard. Simon means he has heard or has been heard. Simon. God changed his name to Peter which means little stone. Amen. Little rock. That's why the Catholic Church thinks that Jesus said on this rock. They think they were talking about Peter. Peter was their first pope. They say so Peter was the first pope. So Peter was Peter was the first pope because Jesus said on this rock I'll build my church. So Peter was the first pope, the one that he built the church on. Amen. So you think what Jesus named him Peter? Amen. He said, "Your name is uh uh son of Jonas. Thy name is Peter." Amen. Little stone. And upon this rock I'll build my church. What rock? &gt;&gt; Amen. Couldn't be Peter, but that's what they think because he's Peter's little stone, &gt;&gt; right? But brother Graham of course helps us to understand that that church was built on the revelation of who Jesus Jesus Christ is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The revelation that Peter gave him. Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God. Upon this rock, upon this foundation, upon this revelation, upon this truth, I will build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it. Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad that you're part of that family, a part of that church, that the gates of hell cannot prevail? Oh, they'll come against you, old friend. Look, you know as well as I do, those gates of hell will press on you as hard as they possibly can. The devil will take you as far as you want. In fact, it'll take you farther than you want to go if you let it. Amen. Devil will, but it cannot prevail against you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It cannot overcome you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It cannot overtake you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You belong to God. You don't belong to the devil. You belong to God. You're his. That's why we're part of that family, the family of God. On that revelation, Amen. I will build my church. That's why the church of God through all every church from the fir from Pentecost, it was built on from Pentecost, it was built on Jesus Christ. The revelation of who Jesus Christ is. That's why when every one of those denominations that splintered off from 3:20 AD when the Catholic church formed in Nia Rome and God left that church amen and bitterness ended entered into the church Sernia when bitterness entered in then they took the name of some father son the holy ghost but the bride of Christ amen as we'll say the bride comes out of the church it is always has been founded on the revelation of who Jesus Christ is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We've been built on that name. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This bride. We say church. We we we bring that church in. But we got to we we know we know it's bride. We know there's a difference between the church nominal and the church spiritual. We know there's a church nominal that's out there. Those are the ones that's going trying to start going after that oil. But we know there's a church spiritual. We know there's a five wise virgins that God takes in a rapture. And that rapture or those children have been coming forth all the way from that Pentecost up to this time. And every one of them church ages, Martin, Luther, uh St. Martin and each one have been come forth and built on the revelation of who Jesus Christ is. Not two gods, not three gods, but one God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the revelation that Peter gave Jesus there. And he said, "On this foundation, I will build my church, my spiritual church." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what we're built on. That's why we hold that name so dear and so precious. Simon chain name was changed to Peter. Saul. Saul's name. Well, Saul means to be uh to uh means desired. Saul means desired. God changed Saul's name to Paul because he wasn't uh he wasn't that that was desired. Paul means little deputy which is basically what Paul did through the entire New Testament if you read you know Paul's life. Amen. That's exactly what he done when he came through and went to each city and brought forth the the word of God. Amen. Little deputy Abram. Abram's name was changed to Abraham. Abram is exalted father, which sounds like a good name, Abram. But that wasn't his position. His position wasn't to be exalted father. That's God Almighty. God Almighty is exalted father. Uh Abram's name, his position, his adoption was to be the father of many nations. Right? That's why he changed his name to Abraham to designate him as the father of many nations. That was his position. That was his placement. Amen. Was to be the father of many nations. Not an exalted father, but a father of many nations. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; His placement, his position. Sarai, uh his wife, uh Sarai means contentions. God changed Sarah's name to Sarah, which Sarah is princess. Praise the Lord. So, he took her from being contentious to being a princess. That's why God had to change their name so that the promised uh son of the uh of uh Isaac could come forth, &gt;&gt; because God promised, you said, "Well, the promised son was Jesus." But God promised Abraham a son, did he not? He promised him his son Isaac. Now of course we know the royal seed of Abraham, amen, is Jesus Christ. But that seed that was to come forth, issued physical seed from Abraham was to be Isaac, not Ishmamail through the bond woman. Because we know that the the the the shuck is not heir with the seed. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Not the genuine seed. Just like they'll never take that land. That is that land belongs to Israel. I don't care how much they fight, go back and forth. I don't care how many prophets, people uh uh uh uh presidents or whatever get involved in it. I don't care how many peace treaties they sign. I don't care how much they delve in it. None of that makes any difference. God gave it to Israel and it's theirs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it will always be there. &gt;&gt; In fact, when those mothers were birthing forth those children, they actually named them in the birth pains the name that they were to be placed over in that land. &gt;&gt; Yes. When Joshua's position was to place them in their land, he placed them based on what of course got the revelation of God. But their name placed them there and what they were to be uh shepherds or priests or uh whatever position, whatever place, whatever uh position they were to be f to to fill their adoption was to be in that position. That wife, that mother called that name out in her birth pains as that child was coming forth. Amen. Gad and Asher and Joseph and Benjamin. Amen. Was to be brought forth to place them in that land. Their name, their name placed them where they were supposed to be. That's why it's so important. Well, that promised son, this son could not have come forth, could not have until God changed their names. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God changed from Abram to Abraham and Sarah to Sarah. And when he changed their names, they were turned back to young man and young woman again. And Sarah finally conceived and brought forth a son. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And his name was Isaac. And there you go. &gt;&gt; We kick it off. And there we go forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. Read through the Bible. see exactly why each one was uh as it came forth from that lineage because God brought it forth to be that way. He had to change their names first. &gt;&gt; They had to have a name change. Amen. and and thinking about u uh uh Abraham uh to adding on the hamm the ham. It also changed his name from Abra from from exalted father to father of many nations. But it also put Abraham in his name in the place of perfection. It placed Abraham with now seven letters in his name instead of four &gt;&gt; or five as it was. It place it placed him in a position of A B R A H A M seven letters. Amen. Completion with God. That's why it had he he changed not only did it change his name from exalted father to father of many nations but it placed him in a place of his in his name of completion. Brother Brandham talked about there had never been another one come forth like that with a message like that until as he said this day G R A H A N Billy Graham that went around the world and bringing forth uh uh that sanctification message as he brought forth as brother Bram talked about there's nobody could have done it any better that's why God chose him to do it &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and he did &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; but he only had six letters in his name G R A H A He had the ham, the ham, but it was only six letters. You say that Ham is the father of nations. Yes, but it was to the people, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The the church nominal to the church uh uh uh nominal, not to the bride. &gt;&gt; Right? So if God sent somebody like that with the number of man, six letters, G R A H A M, six letters, the number of man to bring forth a ministry, a word to get people to salvation through that through that gospel and through that gospel message and that nominal church. Don't you think that God would do the exact same thing in a higher form for the bride of Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. through someone who didn't have six letters in his name, but he had a ham with seven letters. &gt;&gt; Brandon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; B R A N H A M. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seven letters. Now, that wasn't to the world. That wasn't to the church nominal. That message is to the bride. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That message is for God's elect. That message is for God's church spiritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. not church natural. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's why it's so precious to us to understand what God has done and the importance of those names. The importance of that name. That name was important. In fact, I I can't I tried to find it. Uh maybe brother Dennis can help me. But um you know, brother Dennis used to pastor too u and all. He uh studying the word, but I I I could I could believe I've heard somewhere or read somewhere where their family name was changed at one point &gt;&gt; to B r a ham. B R A N H. Brham. It wasn't seven letters before, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And it's not like brother Brham changed it so it would be Brham so he could say it was seven. No, it was before that. What you say? &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it that that name was changed. That family name was changed down to for whatever reason. I I want to try to find it again. I could not find it for some reason. If y'all find it, let me know. I'd appreciate it. Um, just let you know how fallible I am, but I couldn't find it. But I knew there was something way back in here. We talked about the back of the mind. There's a way back in here that remembered at some point that family name was changed to B R A N H A M. Seven letters with H A M on the end of it. Amen. Brought a message to the church spiritual. Praise the Lord. That's who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's who this bride is. This bride is the church spiritual. My goodness, this guy has when I don't have my glasses, it's all blurry. I can't see the time. Anyway, let let me just close here in a minute. Um, we got those names and the changing of the name. Amen. I got so much more here I want to say. And Methuselah, the name, the name Methuselah was a name that was given so that Noah would know when to get on the ark. Um, Brother Brandham talked about the the the each of the church ages that were named for a specific reason. If you look at the if you look at the name of each church age, you see the characteristic if you know what that name means, you see the characteristic of that church age. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he talks about you left your first love and rolled over into bitterness and the open door in the Philadelphia and the the uh the the uh the the missionary age and what all those things, those names put in position the character of that of that age. um our names, what our names are make a difference to who we are and and our character and children when they grow up that what their names are. Amen. Uh I I just called Gabriel's name and I just read his name out of the Bible. Amen. The names make a difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It it it it it identifies uh uh a person of who they are, their character. children's names. Amen. The name of Jesus more important than any name that we could think of. Brother Ram talks about the name of Bethlehem. The name of Bethlehem. The word bet h Beth means house. E L L means God in Hebrew. E L H E L H E M is bread which means Bethlehem where God Christ came forth was the house of God's bread. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The name You think, well, was he a Nazarene? Was he where where were where where was he born? They were here and they went here and then they came here and they ended up here and and he was born in a stable in Bethlehem, not Nazareth and not because he had to be in Bethlehem because he was it Bethlehem was the house of God's bread, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he was the bread of life that was brought down. Amen. He couldn't he couldn't be in Egypt. He couldn't have been in that. He couldn't have been born. You see how all this works? I got &gt;&gt; I feel so pressed now. I know the times when we got communion coming. Um there's so much that goes into these names, friend, to understand and so much of the scripture that brings it to that place. U you think, "Oh, this this is a horrible thing that that uh that they're having to make a a a pregnant woman that's about to give birth at any time now ride on the back of a mule to go over here." But they had to do that. If this horrible person, if this horrible king hadn't put out this edict, they would have never left Nazareth and Jesus would have been born there. That wouldn't have worked because Jesus had to be born in the house of God's bread in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you think this horrible person was just doing what God put on him to do? Yes. God orchestrates somebody like that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bar said he did Hitler to drive those Jews back to their homeland. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had to put that on Herod to drive Joseph and Mary, horrible as it was, on the back of that nasty mule with her almost about to give birth. Couldn't find a place here. Couldn't find a place there. They had no place here. They had no place there. So where'd they have to go? Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; And people say the Bible is fallible. And they say that it's contradictory. Friend, there is so much in the scripture that proves God's divinity &gt;&gt; and God's uh absolute perfectness is just well without revelation you just don't know it. You can't see it anyway. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he had to be born in the house of God's bread in Bethlehem. Brother Brandon preached a message. Why little Bethlehem? Praise the Lord. It's all done that way in their position. He talks about their position. He talks about he I even have a quote here where he talked about what we've mentioned before with those uh with those women and the patriarchs giving birth uh and calling out their names and the place that their names were was identifying how they were in their in their promised land. Amen. How important those names mean. How important a name means. What's in a name? What's in your name? What's in our name? What's in the name of Christ? Amen. I'm not worried about my name. You would think, well, I'm almost 60 years old. Uh, but how many years ago has it been now that I really had identified in my earthly name? But I Amen. I took on a new name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All this family in heaven and earth is named after that name. And I proudly proudly display it and wear it as a token of love, appreciation, and uh of authority who we are. Who we are in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's reflect that every day. Let's reflect that spirit. Let's reflect that power. Let's uh reflect that light every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; There's no other name. Amen. No other name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's stand if we could. Amen. I did not intend to take that much time, but Amen. And just uh just felt inspired of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. I did not put this on the uh tablet. my apologies, but if you want to turn over with me as we're going to transition over now into uh the taking of the Lord's supper number 16, we sing it. I sing it have ever since I pastored. Every time I take communion, Psalm number 16, first verse. Cleanse me, oh Lord. This is a showdown, brother B called. &gt;&gt; This Lord suffers a showdown. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's a time where again, you say a cruise saying of the rubber meets the road. This is that time. Amen. We check ourselves, make sure there's no impediments, there's nothing in our heart, there's nothing between us and someone else. Amen. that that you could do something about. Now, if somebody hates you that, you know, I've probably got a lot of people that hate me, but uh as far as I know in my heart, I've cleared everything right with anybody I know. And if they still hate me, then that's on them, not me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh as much as we can do to live peaceibly with all men, we try to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if there's anything that we feel in our hearts, we try to make it right. Praise the Lord. And we do this as we sing this We search our hearts, amen, as we sing this to make sure that mean we're in position, we're in the place the Lord, Amen, can use us and speak to us and as we take this most sacred time of the Lord's supper here. So let's sing this. It's Psalm number 16, just the first verse. Amen. Search me, oh God. Let's sing it. Search me, oh God, and know my heart today. [Music] Try me, oh Savior, [Music] know my thoughts. I pray &gt;&gt; see if there be some wicked way in me. Cleanse me from every sin and set me free. Oh, examine your heart again as we sing it again. Search me, oh God, [Music] and oh my heart today. Try me, oh Sior. Know my thoughts I pray. See if there be some wicked way in me. cleans me from every sin and set me free. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, as you examine your hearts now. Amen. Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Yes. Lord Jesus try me. My thoughts I pray. Oh Jesus, see it there be somewhere in cleans from sin and set me free. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus, examine us today, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; May our hearts be clean before you, Father. Examine my heart, Lord. Let me examine my heart, Lord. Make sure there's no impediment. Make sure there's no uncleanness, Lord. Make sure there's nothing there to hinder between me and you. Oh God, let that be for all of us here today as we approach this sacred time. Lord, it's given to us at this Lord's supper. Lord, I only try to have it when you really put it in and press it on my heart to have Lord. Yes. Now, this time when we come, we pray that you would help make sure that we're clean, cleansed, we're ready to receive this, Lord, your broken body and your precious blood. receive it unto ourselves, God, as you have given it to us as an ordinance to do until you come. Help us now, Lord, ourselves to you, Jesus. Amenus. Amen. Hearts, minds, Jesus. So stop this.
