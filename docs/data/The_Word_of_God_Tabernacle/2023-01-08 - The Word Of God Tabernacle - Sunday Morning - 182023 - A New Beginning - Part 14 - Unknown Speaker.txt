praise the Lord amen I love him don't you yes thank the Lord Jesus he's so good to us amen we'll go to the Lord in prayer now amen we have a couple prayer requests to mentioned to you amen um obviously sister Sheila is with us today but let's please remember her she's supposed to have her other eye surgery tomorrow buddy this is a long one um sister sheily is going to have her so I guess it's still tomorrow at nine o'clock in the morning so we remember Sister Shelia and then she had the other one done we're just believing that this is going to be as good or better amen amen praise the Lord sister Lydia text also she desired greatly to be here today but uh that she had a bad cough and that cough came back last night she was up most of the night with this bad cough and obviously didn't want to interrupt the service but just pray that the Lord would just touch that and he'll sister Lydia take this call from her amen sister Matisse not with us today she uh text me earlier today and said that the couple that she had been housing has finally been admitted I guess into a rehab center so they were up all night packing in whatever they were doing so she was extremely tired but the prayer request is if she can get rest in her body from resting sleeping but uh let's pray for that couple who they are or is this something that Matisse does you all know but if they need help they need to place the state temporarily whatever they need some help they need to be rehabbed they need Jesus more than anything so if the Lord sent them across matisse's path to bring this to this place and let's just pray for them amen I don't know their names or who they are but let's please remember them in prayer also I have a request that this came to my heart that I wanted to let everybody know of and you may not know but for as long as I can remember there's been a woman who walks up and down Oracle uh and it has been told that her parent that her husband and her children were killed on Oracle and she she walked up she just been walking up and down ever since uh she came to our church one time sister Matisse took her in um and she came to our church home on the when we were at Cortaro her name is Lydia uh she's known affectionately in the neighborhood by the as the umbrella lady we back in the day always called her the Oracle lady because she always walked up and down Oracle but I guess she expanded and started going down Aina she got ran over uh on Aina Wednesday or Thursday I can't remember I think it was Wednesday didn't I tell you all much about it Wednesday no it was Thursday it was Thursday okay so then it was so she got she got hit by a car on Ina Wednesday or Thursday uh as far as I know I haven't heard or read the last thing I found in the news was she was still in the hospital they hadn't heard any updates I don't know if she's passed um but it was just on my heart to pray for her so again her name is Lydia she came to our church one time I didn't ask her about the situation with her husband or children or any of that I didn't want to get personal she just came to one dime tried to help her talk to her Matisse wanted her to stay longer she just wanted one night's rest in matisse's home and she took a shower and that was it and that's all she wanted and she left and so people help her all the time in that but I think it's kind of sad she got hit by a car on Aina you're pretty bad too from what I heard critical life-threatening they said in the news so let's please remember uh her if we could in prayer again her name is Lydia got this prayer request here from brother Dennis says please remember my stepdaughter Jill in prayer she is constantly dealing with severe depression putting a lot of pressure and weight on Leah of course or her mother and Dennis's wife on Leah's shoulders which is bringing Leah's Depression more severe as well as as well Jill is constantly asking for financial help which is a heavyweight on us and that the Lord will help her get on her feet which she has several appointments that has opened her way that appointments opportunities excuse me opportunities that have opened her way salvation is salvation is the first and utmost for Jill and that she will function with a sound mind especially for the sake of her children amen has served so we all know Jill lives in St Louis this is Lydia's daughter Liz please remember her in prayer Amen in this situation of course in the Wake that it puts on Leah too so that anyone have an unspoken request on your heart today is trusting human Faith let's stand to our feet if we could trust him in faith believing yeah it's more than able he's always never miss an appointment always faithful brother Lord Jesus with our hearts in reverence to your

Revelation a lot of people don't have things amen God asked him to do something and oh I can't do that I wouldn't have asked you to do it if I didn't know you could do it I wouldn't have asked you to do it if I hadn't given you the equipment and the ability to be able to do it amen that's a profound statement a lot of people don't understand that lord I can't do that yes you can I mean Moses protested proficiently I can't do this I have this deficiency and I can't do I can't talk right in all the objections I'll be with you I'll take care of that I'll get Aaron speak for you and don't worry about it everything you need I've given to you yeah my praise the Lord everything we need Saints has been given to us amen praise the Lord thankful for that amen praise the Lord let's add to our feet if we could and then we're going to change all the service now turn our Bibles to Genesis chapter one we're on the new beginning part 14. I know it's getting kind of lengthy but we're getting there amen amen just a couple more services and we'll start in on that new city amen yes praise the Lord you beginning part 14 is where we're at here amen but as we normally do we start in Genesis chapter one read a couple read the first few verses and then before we do let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could Precious Jesus father we are so thankful Your Grace your mercy your love your blessings Lord all that you do for us give to us leading and guiding and helping and strengthening us Lord and God I just appreciate so much what sister Pat said because sometimes I know of myself get discouraged lord of the ability to be able to do something or go here leading or or or or some something you put in my path Lord and God would just as humans just get so objective sometimes but Lord we can't know and have faith that there's nothing that you would put in our path there's nothing you would call for us to do there's nothing that you would want us to move forward with that you haven't already given us the ability to do it and we can reach out and claim that and believe it in Jesus name because it's your promise Lord not ours all we have to do is step into it believe it have faith God is that faith that brings us to that level of place of belief and truth in your word God and in your abilities and showing us and helping us to recognize Lord these things that God it just means so much to us in this late hour that we live thank you Lord for your blessings upon this congregation upon this service Lord this place that you've given us father and we're so thankful of all that you do for us every day we pray that your Holy Spirit Lord would have preeminence now the main part of this service to speak to us what should have us to see and know and hear in this word that it would draw us closer to you Lord more like you in this last day in your image father Lord we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory and praise for all that is said and done bless these that have come Lord may your hand be upon them bless those who may be streaming watching now Lord we just committed to you commit them to you and each one of us anoint speaker in here alike now fathers you would accomplish what you sent set this service up for now as we committed to you and Grant and pray that you granted to us your blessings once again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Genesis chapter 1 we'll read the first couple of verses in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth the Earth was without form and void darkness is upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water amen you can be seated if you'd like amen good to be back again today amen I want to go over back over to Revelation chapter 20. last week we talked about the setting up of the white Throne judgment we've obviously gone through our times we've gone through the Armageddon we've gone through the Millennium through uh Gog and Magog and the setting up of this um this white Throne judgment talked about last week of those who would be in judgment and those who will be judged and those who will be sitting on the throne with Christ amen the bride and those that are his that are uh with him as Miss Jesus if you will and those that will come up before him in judgment and those that will be judged by those books and uh we're going to talk about those books Lord willing next week but this week I wanted to enter back into this judgment now we read over in Daniel and we see here and we'll read here again we read over in Daniel where it uh where Daniel of course solved is just like John saw this but of course God told Daniel to seal it up and of course he told that it would be revealed in this last days even to John the Revelator so he realized that at this time that God is showing and revealing and helping us know uh the things of the scripture that's unfolding to us uh and but but Daniel did give a very good depiction description of of this very scene of this why as we call it to Noah as the white Throne judgment scene or the white Throne is the final judgment uh we know that judgment continues on all the time uh God sends warning though before he issues judgment but judgments continue to go forward in life amen even the Bible says you shall know them by the fruits they bear uh that's a judgment but the final judgment is the white Throne judgment the Judgment that is the final separation between believer and unbeliever between Satan and God those two vines that grew up together through the church ages God's going to take that one Vine and it's going to be cast into the lake of fire while the other one goes and enjoys eternal life uh in the most beautiful place that Noah has ever seen there has never heard a nor is entering the heart of man what it's going to be like that God's got in store for us yeah but uh as as he gave us this depiction Daniel did and John the Revelator which you'll read here uh that this uh that this white Throne judgment has now been set up there's the premiere of it uh we sort of maybe can get a vision of it's a little difficult but we try to maybe get a little vision of what we're looking at now what we can see what the scripture is revealing to us and helping us understand uh but now in Revelation 20. I do want to read this part again Revelation chapter 20 uh verse 11. and I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whom's face the Earth and Heaven fled away and there was no found no place for them which we just talked about last week and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is The Book of Life again which we'll get into those books next week whether it takes a week or two on those I'm not sure I'm trying to I'm trying to not take I think the last time we talked about the books here over in Cortaro we I took four or five services to do it but I'm kind of just trying to take the highlights this time uh and just make it into one service and we'll just see however the Lord leads us that's all I want to do is whatever he'd have me to do the book Trope and another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things now this is a part one of the parts I want to get to that we the one of the things that we want to talk about today uh the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their Works amen and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it the dead and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their words and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire now we had this set up we realized that the bride the righteous those that redeemed those that received the blood of Christ who uh who did not reject it uh were born again filled with the Holy Spirit we could go through that in uh in Matthew 25 the first part of Matthew 25 which we will go over to Matthew 25 but I wasn't intending on reading the scripture about the ten virgins uh but you can see where the five foot the five wise virgins had oil in their land right Amen in their vessels and in their lamps and the five foolish only had enough in their vessel to sustain them for a period of time which again is just simply The Same Spirit but an anointing on the flesh rather than an indwelling presence of Christ in a person's soul right which is the new birth there's the difference between the foolish virgin and the wise version they're all virgins they're all virtuous they're all undefiled by men they're all undefiled by men's ideas opinions doctrines but five had oil in their vessels and in their lamps and the other five only had it enough in their lamps enough that went out that was in their flesh not in their soul they weren't born again they just had a spirit on them it's brother random talked about it in false anointing ones at the end time these people are anointed they absolutely have an anointing of the Holy Spirit but that anointing only goes as deep as the flesh or the spirit it is not a new birth yes a new birth changes a person from the inside out and makes you a part of of Christ the word amen and seals that spirit in there by the Holy Spirit to where no one could get in or out of there ever again and sealed until you're the day of your destination so these five that are foolish they have the Holy Ghost but only enough on their flesh only enough to jump and dance or shout or have a tingling in their Spirit or a manifestation of a of a gift of some kind or something and but yet they weren't actually born again they didn't actually receive the new birth of the Holy Spirit coming in their soul and there's the difference between the wise virgin who is born again the foolish virgin who simply has an anointing amen so as we go upon that we recognize that the bride those that are part of him that were born again that didn't receive the new birth are with him on the throne in judgment yeah they're judging the rest of humanity as theirs I say I will say Miss Jesus because she's a part of him yeah she's becoming part of him now she he's become her she's become him he took my place so I could take his amen God when it mentions as we said last week God he's talking about not just God he's talking about his bride his wife who we are was set with him in his throne in Judgment of the rest of humanity which includes the foolish virgins that come forth now uh there's uh brother random talks about of course in in a couple of places where there's uh the foolish virgins that are at the end time that go into the tribulation period and they have to seal their testimony of Jesus with their own blood but he also tells us that there is foolish virgin and wise Virgin uh through every age so we know there's bride in every age we already although that's very well established there's bride in every age but there is also foolish virgin in every age amen amen that come through and uh how God gets them to that point of of the ones at the end where they seal their testimony with their blood did that as they would have even in the Dark Ages and through those times it was foolish and wise virgins amen those foolish however because see from the damn Pentecost nothing has changed from the day of Pentecost it took a new birth to be in Christ amen from the from that day when the 120 received in the upper room that was the precedent that was the scriptural precedent that was set for everyone that ever desired to be or say they were a Christian you had to have a new birth you must be born again there was no uh there was no a wiggle room here you must be born again Jesus told Nicodemus you must be born again and the precedent the scriptural preced that set at the dead Pentecost the 120 there that received a new birth they received the spirit of God on them and in them and there's the difference and from that time everyone that had that that claimed to be a Christian that said they were that believed they were had to have that new birth that's how you that that is your ticket that is your token that that is your that is your uh uh your past to get on the train damn I the boat the plane the whatever the rocket ship whatever you want to call it uh the to go in the Rapture you have to have that ticket you have to have that token you must be born again there's no leeway so everyone through there had to have that those who did not if they stayed virtuous and fell under that same category as a foolish virgin will still yet come up for the wipes on judgment in fact all of the rest of humanity comes up before the Judgment at that time every one of them because it's that final judgment amen that's why it says I saw the dead small and great stand before God all of the Nations came before at this one place it's all a gathering now some came to church during life many came to the place of Armageddon some went through the Millennium inside the city outside some lived through and went through Gog and Magog but everybody will be here right every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord everyone so they all small great Rich poor whoever they are everyone comes to this place atheists agnostics Buddhists Hindus whoever they are every one of them will come to this judgment Throne amen and they'll have to give an account for their lives how now in the books according to their Works yes according to their words he says that twice here in the scripture they were judged every man according to their words now there's going to be some crossover here between here in the books the next Sunday but I want us to understand that since the bride is on the throne it helps us to understand that the book of your Deeds as the human carnality part of yourself was has been by the blood of Christ put in his sea of forgetfulness right amen so the Deeds that it that it reads out of these books for all of humanity except the Bride of yours is annihilated amen your your Deeds God's not judging you by your Deeds because you received the blood of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ annihilated every sin by his blood that would ever be accounted to you amen so when the books are open to look at any kind of Deeds no we don't make it by Deeds amen we only make it by his blood yes that's the only way we make it now the others that have the Deeds that they're read they rejected Christ they did not become born again and they and they're working on making it by their words you hear a lot of people say that I mean honestly that's the fundamental foundation of the Catholic Doctrine yes is by your Deeds by your works you must earn your way to heaven and a lot of people even that are Catholic I hear people that say they're Christians try to work their way to heaven friend you cannot do it yeah yeah you cannot you cannot do enough things in life to try to offset the sin and iniquity that we accumulated just from our birth right which we had nothing to do with but amen but that rejection is what puts a person in this position the receiving of Christ takes that deed of yours and does away with it so you're not judged according to your words you're judged according to Christ amen amen the word by the blood that's already been cleansed that's already been judged and found not guilty because you have become him there's no sin in him how can there be any sin in you right if you are born again and your very Soul which is the one that uh that that stands before God if that is controlled and owned and occupied by God himself then how can there be any sin in there there cannot so if there's if the devil wants to write down something you did bad this week or something you said bad that you put under the blood of Christ it's annihilated out of that book there's no book left for you I'll read you a quote next week but like I said these are going to cross over a little bit but now the others that come to be judged they are just according to their Works where are those Works those works are recorded in a book right amen all the things they say all the things they do remember last week we read the quote brother random said even to their very thoughts right their very folks are being recorded here and will be read forth and will be shown for us brother man talked about that great screen across the sky that that will be shown for everyone to see there's no deny it then you can hide stuff for people now you can lie about it you can do it in secret you can do it in a closet but there's no way you can hide it from God right amen and when that time comes there'll be no hiding it there'll be no privacy there'll be no secrecy there'll be no secret compartment that you tuck this away in it'll be there for everyone to see amen for these words now let's go to uh Matthew chapter 25. let's fortify this with some scripture Matthew 25 is obviously the first part of it is talks about the 10 virgins which we sort of give a brief synopsis about if you want to go back if you have never read about the 10 verses you can go back to Matthew 25 1-13 read about those virgins and find out uh why some went in and some did why did the why did the wise virgins go in with Christ and the and the foolish did not even to the point that the foolish even knocked and spoke and this is the 10th verse I'll just read this and while they went to buy the oil because their oil ran out all they had was what was on their flesh they didn't have enough to get them in a rapture the bridegroom came and they were ready and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us and he answered and said barely I say unto you I know you're not now that no is a different no than when he talks about I never knew you when he talks to that group of people earlier in in John he says a depart from me ye that work iniquity I never knew you that means I never had relation with you I don't know you we've we've not had any Fellowship communion uh relationship intimacy I never knew you but when he says I know you not here he's not telling These Foolish virgins that same thing if you look it up it's a different word he's saying I am not acknowledging you I am ignoring you is what he's saying I know you not is saying I'm not I'm ignoring you I I'm I'm not listening to you amen because this has already been done you had your chance and you didn't you didn't follow through you weren't born again the door's been shut the marriage been set with one to the marriage sufferer of the Lamb I'm ignoring you because it's finished and what is left is left to them that they are to go into tribulation amen so he says I the door was shut and he came and said open to us no I know you're not he's ignoring them watch therefore for you know near the hour day when the son of man cometh now let's go over to the 31st verse after this now the great scholar Scofield disagrees with uh what I'm about to tell you what I feel the Lord has showed me and and through the message I believe that brother Branham taught uh helps us realize that uh the great Dr Scofield was wrong right uh he believes that this that we're about to read was is not the great white Throne judgment uh because of a couple of semantical things that he says that the scripture doesn't specifically identify at this point although we do see that at the beginning of this chapter a Rapture takes place of the of the wise virgins right hey so it's got to be after that point uh but he makes a denotation of different things but there's some things I want to show you that also help solidify that this is speaking about the white Throne judgment but now listen uh 31st first 25 25th chapter 31st birth when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory amen now when was the son of man to sit according to scripture upon his throne of Glory that would be my question if this man was still alive what other time does the scripture tell us that he is to set on his throne of Glory amen well let's keep it let's keep going then and before him before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats now they're in judgment they are the ones being judged remember now we've got the Judgment all set these ones that are coming up before the throne as he's sitting on the throne with his bride in that throne with him in judgment All Nations come before him and he begins to separate them as a Shepherd would divide his sheep from the goats now it does not say that they are sheep it does not say that they are ghosts follow me with what the scripture says it says they accept he separates them one from another as a Shepherd would it's not saying they are it's saying that this is a a a a metaphor of what a Shepherd would do by separating the sheep from the goats he's not saying they're sheep and he's not saying there goes he's saying he divides them as a Shepherd would separate his sheep from the goats you understand it's like people I I don't want to create any controversy here but it's like in my opinion I differ with some people when they say that Jesus uh was bleeding in the Garden of Gethsemane he was bleeding but that's not what the Bible says the Bible says and if you believe that that's okay we're not going to fight over this but the Bible says that his sweat became as it were drops of blood it does not say they are drops of blood it said his sweat became as it were drops of blood so in other words his sweat would be pouring off his body like pouring this water out of a bottle not blood as it were well this is the same type to me you read the scriptures you got to follow what the scripture says it would be as it were a Shepherd separating his sheeps from the goats that's all he's saying amen I mean you could go play a game of checkers what's the first thing you're going to do when you open the Checker box you're going to separate the red ones the chips from the black chips well you could you could use that you could use that a metaphor just as much as you could anything you're just separating them that's all he's talking about he's just saying as it were so when people say well these are sheep so they got to be bright he didn't say they were sheeps he just said he's separating him as they as if it were a Shepherd dividing amen what if it were a checkered player separating his red chips from his black chips or whatever they call them they're not chips I guess amen that's all he's talking about amen it's it's just it's a time of of Separation okay let's move on and he and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left now remember the right hand is the point of authority okay the right hand of God is a point of authority not a literal fin but a par a point of authority then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for now you say well then that means that uh that these that this was prepared before the foundation were for them so that's got to be the pride no it doesn't right it's just saying that the kingdom that they're going to be allowed to become a part of was created for the before the foundation of the world Amen and they're going to be a part of it it was prepared before for them from before the foundation of the world because now they are a part of it and remember when you start entering into the eternals of God you start recognizing that God knew all this the beginning to the end amen or as it were a beginning and as it were there's an end there's no beginning or ending to Eternal we know that but as it were see from the foundation of the world that does not make them bribe amen amen it just means that they're inheriting life now why has God put some on the right as they were sheep why would he put some on the right that the scripture actually calls later as righteous amen and the only way you can become righteous is by the blood of Christ amen amen but remember These Foolish virgins sealed their testimony of Christ by their own blood amen for I wasn't hungered and he gave me so they're asked this is their question let me get back to this then shall the king say unto them on the right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I wasn't humbered and you gave me me now what's he doing he's judging them by what not by the blood of Christ right but by their Works yes amen isn't that exactly what Revelation 20 just told us that when he opens the books he judges them twice it says it by their words what's God telling them here how was he able to separate them from the right to the left because of their works because the books that were open and out of those books were read The Works remember last week I told you that there will be times even as the Bride As the wife will be sitting there in judgment and say when I was on Earth he did this for me yes he he was here for me she was here for me uh I I was broke down on the side of the road never saw this person my entire life haven't seen him since but I had a bad flat tire and I couldn't fix it and this person stopped and took their time energy effort and they fixed this tire for me and that person comes up in judgment right you don't think there's going to be some mercy towards that person because of that yeah amen let's read for I was hungry and you gave me me I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous hears where it calls them righteous how did they become righteous amen praise the Lord answer him people want to put God in such a box they want to put us in a box the blood of Christ it it can only do this it can do exactly what God says and he'll do it'll reach to the lowest lows right remember before the blood of Christ was even shed God gave Cade a space to repent right hey the grace of God is so prevalent and so enormous and so far-reaching he gave the son of the serpent the devil a chance to repent Jesus God told him I will accept you if you'll do right yeah of course he couldn't do it wouldn't do it couldn't do it but he gave him a space to repent friend who are we to save I know one thing brother Ram said we'll be surprised to people that's going to be there right yeah and we'll be very surprised the people that won't be there right I had to vary to that I don't think he said very well be surprised the people that are there and surprise probably the people that aren't going to be there amen it It's just sometimes it confounds the natural mind we want to try to have it all figured out and all worked out and this is going to be there and that one's going to be there exactly who God has planned for before the foundation world is going to be there yes amen praise the Lord let's see where do we go no stranger you took me and naked you clothed me I was sick you visited me and I was in prison you came into me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee and hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took the end or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King answered shall answer and say unto them barely I say unto you in as much as ye have done it unto one of these I could just see him pointing to the bride I can see him pointing to his wife here sitting in the throne as you've done it onto one of these the least of my brethren that'll be me have done it unto me amen praise the Lord now that's the scripture that's judging them based on their words which is what they will have to rely upon when they get there now no doubt there'll be people that obviously are on the right hand that will be granted life for the Judgment of their works but I'm telling you here friend I don't want to be one of those ones that takes the chance of being judged by my words right my words my words are filthy rags right right I don't want to be there and take a chance because I've had people tell me so well maybe they're foolish virgin to go through the tribulation why would you even say that I've had people I've heard people saying about the kids why yeah why would you say that about your children why would you say it about your grandchild I don't care how they're living I don't care what it looks like yeah I would never go there about that that is the last thing I would think about Now is it going to happen for people sure it is but I don't believe that for my children my grandchildren my family I don't believe that I don't and I would never want to put them there nor would I want to think of even for a moment to be there in judgment oh friend when the when the Fountain of Christ and the blood of Christ is so wide open to receive any and any everybody that would that would want it and receive it and come to him and surrender their lives to him as he gave his life for us why would you not do it why when the when the Holy Spirit in this last day is still there just pulsating to come into your life why would you reject him I just don't understand that but he's still there the opportunity still exists the place the the the point the opportunity it's still there for anybody that would receive it am I anybody that wants it desires it amen oh God Let It Be Lord I never want to be in that place yes they will be granted life but now notice now I will say this I said it once we'll get into it more detail later but these people are not bright but these people will not be inheritors of of The Inheritance that is allotted to the bride these people will not be in the new city the New Jerusalem right they will not be in that walled City they will not be there they'll be granted life absolutely but there'll be workers outside the city right now don't let that confound you Lord willing we'll talk about that more later but they are not inheritors of the things that the bride is inheritors of and they will not be in that new city only thing that they have is life that's it God just grants them life I mean I I shouldn't say that's it because that's quite a gift uh but that but that's all that's all they don't they're not inheritors of anything that the bride is here if you think that that vaults them into the position of where the bride is no no no it doesn't absolutely not God just God just in his in this Mercies and through the Judgment at that joke because remember God's a fair judge he's going to judge them fairly righteously he judged them in this way to allow them to have life let's continue on when you've done to know one of these the least of my brother you have done it unto me then shall he say unto uh on them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels now if this is not the white Throne judgment then why are these people that we know cannot be cast into the lake of fire until the white Throne judgment how can this not be that right sorry Mr Schofield but uh you your analogy is starting to break apart because these people that are that are put on the left which in my opinion will be the majority of people the majority of people will be on the left not the right there will be multitudes on the right which we'll talk about in a minute if hopefully I can get to that uh that'll be on the right but the far majority will be the people on the left sad to say but true amen close remember uh abroad is the gate and many find it and there is the way if you find it so uh we can know through other scripture that those that don't will be the far majority of the those that do so he says then shall he say to them with us depart from me ye curse into Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels so if this isn't the right your own judgment then what is it what other scriptural precedent if anybody wants to continue to think that way what other scriptural precedent do we have that tells us of this event other than the white Throne judgment there's not and God doesn't send anybody into a lake of fire until after the final white Throne judgment right amen if people tell you there's somebody in hell now that's wrong right if they say there's that that in the the pits of fire and that's wrong okay if you say hell is in Hades the grave I'm okay with that but the Lake of Fire it does that's not true they're not cannot be until after that final judgment cannot be yes if I was in Hungary and you gave me no meat I was thirsty and you gave me no drink I was a stranger you took me not in naked and you clothed me not sick and in prison you visited me not then shall they answer unto him saying Lord When shall we uh saw we thee and hungered or a thirst or stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not Minister unto thee then shall he answer them saying verily I say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not to one of these Elisa uh the least of these you did it not to me and these shall go away into Everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal now notice the differentiation here yes it tells them that those that are on the left go into an everlasting punishment not eternal amen Everlasting is a long time but it had a beginning and it will have an end just like we said last week hell was created and if hell was created it had a beginning and anything that has a beginning will have an end yes Everlasting yes not eternal but what did he tell them that are as described now here as the righteous into life eternal they are granted eternal life praise the Lord that's just the that's just the mercies of God Amen that's just the goodness of God that God gives that God's uh mercy and Grace look and and the Judgment now the Judgment of those of their works out of the books it's like I said I was stuck on the side of the road I had no hope no help no way out and somebody stopped and and did this I had one time brother Pat and brother Dennis can account to this one time in my stupidity I ran out of gas on Cortaro going to church and some people from nowhere they stopped their truck behind me they got out and they helped push my car off the side of the road they got their truck and left I'll never see those people again the rest of my life but I might see them but I will see him one day right now what do you think my judgment's going to be on them amen does that give them eternal life I don't know but if but if I have a say so I'm going to say something positive about these people that help me see we entertain angels unaware sometimes friend we don't realize they might be clothed like a homeless person they might be of a different nationality tongue race they might be of a different religion we don't know but a lot of times entertaining angels unaware and and also Entertaining Angels Aware as you've done it unto these the least of my little ones you've done it to me praise the Lord well that all factors into in my humble opinion the the the the the righteous Judgment of God according to the books don't you think that it was written down when those men jumped out of their truck didn't have to people zimming by left and right couldn't care if you're stuck just you're an annoyance to them you're in my way these people stop and push me you don't think that's not written in one of their books amen and I'll be the first one to stand up to say I was the one they did that to you amen does that give them eternal life I'm not saying it though right but if you if you want something from me or if you understand how I feel about it they're going to get a positive review on my on my account amen amen you see Yelp doesn't have anything on these books friend uh nothing you can put all kind of reviews on there you want on Yelp or whatever they are but when it comes to this time right when when Christ is sitting there and his bride and she's in judgment she said he's out cars zooming all around me and these these guys specifically stopped took their time pushed my car out of the way and got in their truck and left didn't know who they were don't know where they came from don't know where they went but they helped me has somebody done that to you before yeah and I don't mean push but I mean help you right get you out of a situation or bring you a cold cup of water whatever something that that a person has done to help those are the works that they'll be judged by amen now people give all kinds of money and time and things to Charities and all and they do good deeds but that doesn't put them in the category of doing it unto Christ when you've done it unto his little ones you've done it to him not because you gave a tax deduction to uh some charitable organization right but when you've done it unto these at least at my little ones you've done it to me amen look at this we read this last week he's talking he brother Ram talked about the virgins he says the foolish virgins uh they were not permitted to go to the wedding supper but they suffered persecution and was martyred and raised again at the general Resurrection remember after the after the Thousand Years the general Resurrection in the last day those are the people he separated look now those are the people where he separated like the sheep from the goats amen this is questions and answers being missed being being misunderstood they suffer persecution and was and was martyred and raised again at the general Resurrection in the last days those are the people where he separated the sheep from the goats amen uh makes it pretty and what did he do for us he put our sins on Christ because we received him in the first seal um I think I read this one too last week now notice the rest of the Dead church members dead church members live not again until the thousand years and then at the thousand years they were gathered another Resurrection come that was the General Resurrection which is the second resurrection and they were gathered and Christ and the bride not the church the bride Christ and his Queen Christ and the bride stood there seated stood semantics and they were separated like the sheep from the goats that's right there's the church members come up or foolish virgin if you will amen now there's all kind of talk of people say the foolish virgins come from this group The foolish virgins come from this group I'm of the opinion foolish virgin can come from any group and and I've heard arguments that a foolish virgin couldn't come out of the message people that are around the message I heard people against it I've heard people for it amen I I can see both sides and people hold their hard lines that's up to them I'm not I'm just saying that they could come and I've had people hold hard lines that they could come out of denomination or not come out of the nomination you think Al could a foolish virgin come out of denomination well now how are these people able to con reconcile this when this one's saying well they can't come out of the nomination they're saying they can't come out of the message people then where are they coming from how do you draw you draw such a hard and fast friend you cut everybody out and you know what I'd rather not do that God's gonna do that I I'd rather draw a circle and draw everybody as much as I can back in if I can I'd rather draw a circle not a line and if I can that's what I like to do I understand why they say this site and I understand why they say that sign again I'm not here to argue that point and they may be right I'm not saying I'm right I just would rather give Mercy than excluded and I would rather give someone an opportunity than no hope at all right and that's just my stance that's just how I feel about it and and that's just that's just the way I believe it but they will come up now brother Brown calls them church members will come up to be separated as she from goats foolish virgin the rest of humanity the foolish version will be in my opinion the ones that of course go off onto the right hand side uh and notice I'm not saying that it is but notice in the scripture when he talks about the wise and the foolish he says there's five wives and five bullies she gives us the exact same number there's not one more wise than there is foolish now does that account to the numbers as far as being bride and being foolish virgin are the exact same amount I'm not saying that but I do think there's some relevance to that other than just a parable that he had five on one side and five on the other but but I'll read a scripture here in just a minute so let me get through this real quick uh separate the chief and goes there's where the church members come up and they heard the truth rejected the truth then what's going to be said when that big thing spreads across the canvas brother Brandon talks about that again and the sky we did uh we did go into that part last week and show that you had the opportunity amen everybody will have the opportunity that's that's a righteous judge a righteous judge gives every opportunity Amen to receive it an opportunity how would you judge someone against someone who did not have the opportunity to receive it well that's not very just it it it's like saying coming into the church to say okay I'm gonna I'm gonna take this ten thousand dollars now you had your chance what do you mean I have a chance I didn't even know it was here how could that be a chance when you didn't even know everybody will know they have to know to be a righteous judge to be able to judge in that capacity now let's talk about uh uh the juice for a few moments let's go over to Revelation chapter six I'm not probably not going to be able to give this the time that I want to but we'll go to Revelation chapter six we know that's the seal chapter verse first first six seals we're in Revelation 6. but I want to pay particularly close attention to the fifth seal the fist still starts with the ninth verse so Revelation 6 9 and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar now alter is a place of sacrifice where's the sacrifice our sacrifice was Christ amen that was the sacrifice that was rejected by the Jews they said let his blood be on us and our children but look at this now I saw her in the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held now a lot of people think this was Christians this was bride or Christians at least that were under the Altar and a lot of people until and even brother Adam said I thought that until the Lord revealed it to me and showed me this is not Gentile this is not the bride these are Jews amen and he said and let's just redo it you'll you can see first of all they were slain for the word of God and the testimony they held they weren't slain for Christ they weren't slain for the testimony of Jesus they were slain for the testimony for the word of God and the testimony would say held the Christian is slain for their testimony of Jesus Christ when you talk about the bride that comes up into the Dark Ages they didn't just give their lives in martinement uh because of the word they held to the testimony of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit okay that's one and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true thus thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth and white rose were given unto them every one white robes weren't given amen now we'll we'll we'll read another scripture in a minute to to help you understand how you differentiate between the two this group was given white robes okay and we'll get it done in a minute and it was said unto them that they should rest for a little season until their fellow servants now the bride's not Gentiles aren't servants amen there's people this is the servants are the Jews and which again helps us understand that these are the also these salt these fifth seal souls and algebra Jews their fellow servants which I have to put in here to understand when you talk about the church ages this was all for gentiles the church ages from from the dead Pentecost until today but for those who would receive Christ the word be born again from the day of Pentecost to today now God has to account for because he doesn't forgive remember God said how could I ever forget my people and he doesn't and he can he puts them here in this fifth seal amen as a part of the seals fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as were as they were should be fulfilled which does happen and I beheld when he had opened the Sixth Seal well we finished this official that they should be killed the fellow servants would be killed as they were as the Jews now look as as their Brethren were let me read this to you in the fifth seal when after the Lord reveals this to brother Brown I notice I I don't usually spend a lot of time on the Gen on the on the Jew part of because it doesn't necessarily affect us or or or or pertain to us but to to bring scripture into continuity uh I think it helps that we look at it and discuss it and talk about it because uh the Jew is is uh was God's people so his servants but in the fifth seal now he says now we find out revelation 22 8 same thing now or to settle it look now he says this now to settle it for those whose Souls those Souls that were under the altar of the breaking of this seal that had been slain in the time between the death of Christ and the going up of the church so from the time basically from the day of Pentecost until the going up of the Bride this is those Souls under the altar in that period of time that were slain for this reason for the word of God and the testimony they help our brother Brandon brings into light A specific group which we know which we know very well is what we call the Holocaust he said the Eichmann group and all that them true Jews with their names on the book if you watch my brother according to the scripture they could talk Christ speak here and had all five senses not sleeping in a grave unconscious they were very much awake and could talk speak anything else but he he he accounts this group two a part of it as the Eichmann Group which is the Holocaust and the Jews that were slaughtered the millions of Jews that were slaughtered as a result of this who he said were true Jews amen true Jews and had their name on the book that's what brother Adam called in the fifth seal to understand that this fifth seal is the Jewish people yes amen that that died at that time and they're sitting there waiting for their Brethren fellow servants to come around to be able to see what they now know which were given white roads given to them that they will come around and the and the scripture says you just have to wait just a little while sit here under this Altar and they will come to that place and they will the Jews will finally after the bride's gone the Jews the spirit of God moves back to the Jews we've talked about this before then they will recognize the Jews there will recognize Jesus Christ as the Messiah amen and then they will have to be uh through the tribulation they will be martyred as well now let's look in Revelation 7 real quick Revelation 7 there's so much more I'd like to say but um let's go to verse 9. and maybe we'll fill this in next week we'll see and after this uh Revelation 7 9 after this now above that it talks about the 144 000 coming together uh the 12 12 000 of each of the tribes of Israel after this I be held in lobe a great multitude which no man could number of all Nations Kindred and people and tongues stood Before the Throne and before the lamb clothed with white roads and Palms in their hands now look a lot of people think this is the bride and it is not this is the group that comes forth from the white Throne judgment and we're and we're granted life they were accounted as righteous at that point and they and they had and they were wearing at this time white rose he meant they were wearing white robes so but let's just continue to read because they're they're not the Jews that were given white robes they had on white robes but they were a number that's after the Jews of a great multitude which no man can number out of all Nations Kindred people tongues stood Before the Throne which again tells you it's not the bride right because they were in the throne those who overcome will I grant to inherit to sit with me in my throne and cry to the loud boys saying salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamp and all the Angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell Before the Throne on their faces and worshiped God saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and Thanksgiving and honor and power and might be unto our God forever and ever amen one of the elders answers saying unto me what are these which are waiting a raid in white robes and whence came they and I said unto them sir thou knowest and he said to me these are they which came out of Great Tribulation now we know that can't be brought because we know the bride does not go through the tribulation amen these came out of the tribulation right they went through the white Throne judgment they were accounted as righteous and given robes right they came out of tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb which the blood of Christ is the only thing that can make something White and pure theirs was washed now in the blood of the Lamb see the bride does not need her garment wash she is wearing His Garment she is rubbed in his righteousness she doesn't need to wash her wash her robe she's got on his robe his robe of righteousness these came out of tribulation and had their robes washed praise the Lord therefore they are Before the Throne of God and serve him day and night in his Temple and he that setteth on the throne uh shall dwell among them they shall hunger no more because he's going to feed them and recognize theirs was washed the Jews had the robes because it was given to them why because they had been martyred their fellow servants had yet to recognize Christ as their Messiah to have those robes but they were given to them because of the truth that they stood for the testimony of God for being as brother Branham called them true Jews and were standing for that word they stood there they were given ropes but the Gentile foolish virgin had to have their robes washed in the blood through the tribulation they come out of tribulation and had because then that's when they received after God had had accounted them on the right hand as righteous amen amen oh praise the Lord I I want you to understand though now again as I close here they are not inheritors of anything but life they're not inheritors of anything that the bride has or will be in the new city I'll read that to you next week Lord willing amen let's stand though we could now foreign amen seventh the seventh chapter which I probably did not do a very good job of the seventh chapter is the six chapters of seals the seventh chapter is the 144 000 in the foolish virgin it goes into the eighth chapter in the eighth chapter first verse is the seventh seal and then when there's silence in heaven and um us Brothers we were talking about the the the the thousand days is one year one year's one year is a thousand days again brings about the understanding in the scripture and verbiage one day is as a thousand years uh basically what it's saying is there's eternity but I know people that would take that half hour of silence and they would try to do the math to figure out the difference in a day and a thousand years a thousand years in the day of what is 30 minutes and I'm thinking man if you've got to know that to be in God's right I am finished you can count me out I can't do that math some of these guys you might be all smart and Tommy's I don't know I can't do that kind of math and I'm not going to try to because I don't think that's what you have to do amen that's not a part of it but boy they stake their life on it they hold to that hard and fast when you look at the scripture and it just says that one day is as a thousand years it doesn't even say that one day's a thousand years but it's amazing people I I don't know why people aren't satisfied with just the Simplicity the pure gospel you've got to figure everything out just hold to the gospel and God's gonna bring it to pass what he desires to amen amen it's going to be what he wants it to be when he wants to be how he wants it to be it I just plan on being a part of it amen amen that's my desire praise the Lord amen let's sing this course before we go today I've got the number in here I don't remember what it is but one of the few aren't you glad one of the few praise the Lord Jesus [Music] all alone [Music] is [Music] I believe [Music] [Music] amen you believe you're one of those few praise the Lord gotta believe it by faith know it in your heart I'm one of his
