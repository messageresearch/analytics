as you know sister leah brother dennis's wife she uh is on the front line nurse of coba to the doctor there that sees patients continually so she's been a little cautious with brother dennis obviously coming to church and being with groups of people as all of you most of you know a couple years ago brother dennis had his bout with colon cancer and six months of chemo and also uh just wanted to be precautious and thankful that god has watched over and helped him out and i made that plea last week into our streaming uh that we have the little bit distancing seats here uh if you'd like to come

each one of you appreciate you being here today amen appreciate the lord's goodness remember sister norman in prayer amen she had a bad sinus infection so she wasn't able to be here today so just remember her in prayer and the others that may be not able to make it i guess alice is doing better praise the lord good little alice he wasn't feeling good during the week so thankful the lord touched her brought her family to service today so amen appreciate that i'm honored to have brother nat sister teresa with us today the past couple of months we're um we're on mysteries of god in christ part 15 so the mysteries of god in christ part 15 and as i do this series we kind of start with the same scripture each time because the scripture really is the foundation of the title of our service mysteries of god in christ part 15 and as we started last week mysteries of god in christ brother branham broke down again the three parts um god manifesting or revealing himself to his people god having the preeminence in his people and the restoration of the kingdom so we're on the restoration of his kingdom part two so the mysteries of god in christ part 15 the restoration of his kingdom part two but we'll begin a revelation chapter 10 verse 7 again for our reading but let's just bow our heads if we could another word of prayer before we approach the word father god we are indeed grateful again today of your grace and your mercy and the blessings you give us father we're certainly unworthy lord but you've made us worthy god you've taken our place so that we could take yours be robed in your righteousness without a spot wrinkle or blemish thank you father for helping us lord through the blood of jesus christ that was shed at calvary rose again on that third day for our justification so that we could stand as if though we had never done it in the first place justified in your eyes god and we're thankful father for those that have assembled here today god and each one of us has come god we just thank you father for the efforts and all that is done lord to bring us here and the desires in our heart and of course everything that you do for us lord and through a week and through a time and here today god to honor you and to learn of you i pray father that your word would be spoken today not just in lit service not just in word form only but in power and manifestation of your spirit to reveal it to our hearts and to draw us closer to you by it lord may every one of us when we leave this building today leave closer to you and more like you than when we came into this building lord we welcome and invite your presence today and pray that the spirit lord that has been uh that has been created here the atmosphere that's been created through the worship makes it freedom lord for you to work work among your people lord now lord i pray that you speak through these lips only what you have to be spoken anoint the ears of the here as well god lord we just thank you father for all that you do for us and we commit the remaining part of this service into your hands for your glory and honor we do it in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen revelation chapter 10 verse 7 amen will read but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets and you could be seated if you like amen i want to make you aware of the fact that um micah forgot so if you've been if it's been a question or if you've got a text or something uh micah forgot the power cord for his uh laptop so we're not able to live stream today but he is videoing it with his camera so it will be videoed as he's videoing it now and it will be downloaded on our website uh sometime this week i guess when he gets to it so it is being videoed i am audio recording it but it is not being live streamed so if anybody asked i know priscilla had asked angel that it wasn't on it's not going to be so apologize for that for those of you who may those who may be out there and may be asking i know the pats usually stream picked a good day to come for the first time not livestream because dennis and danny usually watch too so the pats and sister priscilla different ones so sister i already told her so uh but uh just keep that in mind but we are thankful it is recording on his camera and i am as i usually record it on my phone here so amen so we get to this in the uh the revelation chapter 10 verse 7 as we did and we left off last week we left off last week with matthew chapter 6. so as we left off last week i want to go back to and i want to again bring a reminder of course revelation 10 7 the mystery of god that mystery of god hid in jesus christ because many times we talk about the mysteries the bible talks about mysteries plural of god and we refer to mysteries plural many times but when you look at the scripture it says the mystery singular of god would be finished i believe that mystery is the revelation that god has given that he that jesus spoke to his disciples there upon the foundation of the revelation of what who he is who jesus christ is not the second person in a trinity not just a good prophet or a good man but god almighty fell in flesh and on that rock on that revelation he has built this church so this church is built up on that foundation of that mystery being revealed now who is that mystery being revealed to it's being revealed to his chosen it's being revealed to the ones that god reveals it to it doesn't come by knowledge it doesn't come by education it comes by the revelation of god that reveals it to us in christ now are all the mysteries that we know the bible talks about head from ages generations paul talked about brother brown talked about in that are all the mysteries last week we talked about the restoration of the kingdom went back to the to genesis chapter three and found out that nine verses i believe it was what did nine verses nine verses after the fall and we don't know time wise but you can figure out how much time it was but nine verses after the fall of man well of course when man fall all of creation fell that's why all of creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god because it's not going to be a rapture and a completion and a fulfillment of that restoration of the kingdom which is going to include animal life botany life until the manifestation of the sons of god manifest themselves that's why all creation is growing waiting for that time so when man fell all of creation fell so when all of creation failed of course adam lost the book when he lost the book he lost to the hands back of god who was the owner of the book he lost the world the assert that he had control over into the hands of satan satan still controls this world and is still satan's eat and even though jesus by the shedding of his blood bought this world back and now he owns it and it is our property it is our property it belongs to us but we are just sojourners here waiting for the completion of this time and the redemption of our bodies amen go to a marriage supper of the lamb tribulation sets in come back walk on the axe ash of the wicked in the millennium thousand years still a time period amen then you have gog magog and then the white throne judgment and then we have the new city new jerusalem coming down and setting up and then that's that pyramid shaped mountain pushes up and that city comes down dressed as an adorned as a bride for her husband amen a restoration of a kingdom a kingdom for a king and a queen to rule in the whole point but we noticed that nine verses nine verses after the fall god had already began to speak the restoration that he had intended to do when he spoke about the woman's seat jesus christ jesus christ coming for being the cornerstone of this part of restoration to bring that kingdom back to its rightful position again it's like i told you i've heard of course being from the south you know in the south a lot of churches are very emotional not not quite like sometimes it is in the west although you got sometimes when there's a lot of emotion expressed and things and and and that's okay not not saying anything about that especially as long as it's genuine the holy spirit moves and god moves you you move because that's the whole point we move and thug moves very much if you're just trying to make something on or put something up or just try to you know just emotion and emotion is here today and gone tomorrow that does not feel good but if it's god then god moves you then you move and god knows you then you know you move and you do it based on his movie and then god of course manifests and makes it all work perfect the way it's supposed to so nine verses now god is speaking about jesus christ that cornerstone to bring about that restoration because remember like i said last week this kingdom was a spiritual kingdom before it ever became a physical key that's right god was in his mind that spiritual kingdom existed in god the elohim the self-existing one that kingdom existed when he spoke that kingdom came into an existence in a physical form and then god put a man in it to address it and to take care of it and he became the amateur god of this earth god adam was amateur god under god because he had control of this earth yes and god was his god and god came down in the cool of the evening and walked and talked with him and fellowship lived here then god said it wasn't good for him to be alone and created the woman and then as you talked about after the fall nine verses he talks about the woman's sea well who is that woman seeing because woman doesn't have a seed god appointed her a seed by creating the germ of god in the womb of a woman named mary which brought forth jesus the woman's seed amen and satan and and jesus there's been that conflict all the way through remember he said you will bruise his head and he will bruise or you will bruise his head and he will bruise your heels see yes satan is always there on the heels of what god is doing what jesus did and what he's doing trying to prevert what god has done right that's that serpent on the heel of jesus on the heel of the woman's seed to pervert what god has created to try to destroy what god has brought to pass yes amen he always tries to see there's got to be the real before there can be the counterfeit and he always tries to bring the counterfeit when jesus comes with the real but remember the other thing even when satan is trying to pervert even when satan is trying to destroy even when satan is trying to counterfeit the foot of jesus it says would bruise his head amen yeah well if his foot is on the head of the devil where is your foot today you belong to him you are his you are his representative here today is god is living in you then where is your foot that's right what dominion does satan have what the control does satan have what power does satan have over you no no none only [Music] but if you hold on to it and you take it and you you stand your ground and tell him to take his ground then he has to go where you tell him to go that's right so now we've come to and i want to get to this part because satan will try to destroy your homes he'll try to destroy your family so try to destroy your jobs he'll try to destroy your life that's right amen yes he'll try to destroy your life but he has no power over a child of god amen no power over a child of god amen but last week now we finished off when we were talking about the spiritual kingdom before before it became a physical kingdom we talked about the fact that uh there had to be that restoration of of the bride and the bright groom god bringing jesus to bring a restoration of that groom to bring a restoration of that king for that kingdom that through him the bride the queen could be brought forth and that she could be brought forth and restored back to her proper place right when eve fell in the beginning it adam fell and they fell together well there had to be a restoration of the second adam jesus christ to bring that back to its right position that's happened praise the lord that's that mystery that was to be finished in this message yes this last day yes and it was it is to the bride we know who it is but that had to be restored to bring back that restoration from out of the sight of christ read that quote now that the side of christ came forth the bride right amen jesus christ bride so out of him came her to bring her back to that place of restoration again and there had to be that restoration first before god could bring back that restoration of the kingdom you notice it's just the opposite i guess you will of what it was in the beginning because at first god created the kingdom first then he put the man here then he put from the man the woman well this time god had to restore that man back to his place that that that that god ship that kingship for the kingdom right to bring forth the woman the the queen the bride so that she could be restored back so that this second eve the bride could be restored so when the completest of that bride through the word through the word was restored back then it could be a restoration of the kingdom of god well in doing that we finished off again last week of of the spiritual aspect of this kingdom and i want to i want to continue on that thought process i want to continue on with the with the with the thought process of the spiritual application the spiritual restoration of this kingdom before the physical restoration takes place yes amen remember uh romans 8 23 uh that is to wit the redemption of our bodies right amen the redemption of our bodies but the restoration has to take place first to restore this kingdom now remember what was what is what does restoration mean restoration means that you were once here we'll just say it simply you were here and you fell down to here right right yes restoration means this is where you were which means this in god is where you ought to be right amen this is your ought to be conditioned that's righteousness righteousness is a man and is ought to be conditioned that's what it that's what it means righteousness is it is ought to be conditioned so this is where you're supposed to be so when you when humanity fell and you came in a falling condition you were down here so restoration is to bring you back up to where you're supposed to be am i no longer in a fallen condition no longer the desires of the world no longer living as a a as a puppet to the devil but you are now restored back to the place that god saw you in his mind before the foundation of the world that restoration brings it back into its ought to be conditioned so if you had become by the blood of jesus christ and him taking our place on calvary and going to hell and raised on the third day for our justification then that has put you in the position of being clothed in his righteousness amen because he's the one that uh give you the garment to be clothed in now he didn't come clothe you listen now he didn't clothe you who clothed you you did the bible says the bride had made herself ready god just came and gave the ability god came and gave the the garment that you needed to put on the unnarrated favor of jesus christ and his word amen he gives you the ability now it's up to the individual to put that garment off amen to wear that garment to become and to live the life that is the very essence of the of the righteousness of jesus christ he said when i look in the mirror i don't see righteousness we're not talking about looking in the mirror right we're talking about jesus christ living his life through you the preeminence of god in your life yes amen it doesn't mean that you're not going to make a mistake it doesn't mean that you're not going to fall doesn't mean you're not going to be tricked by the devil into doing something they're saying something or motions or something coming forth of course we're still humans in this sticky flesh those things are going to happen but the perpetuation of the blood of jesus christ takes that sin and annihilates it from you it never happened to begin with right praise the lord praise god amen micah got me fired up this morning he sent me a text about that about the uh about the blood of jesus and and the remission yeah the remission of sin to remit sin is to annihilate her to do away with or as if though you've never done it in the first place that's right what has been one of my favorite scriptures i keep quoting to you over and over and over it was in david it was in romans blessed is the man to whom god will not impute sin amen praise the lord what does that mean it doesn't mean you are supposed to look at your faults and your mistakes and your failures and things you do wrong no we strive now it doesn't mean that you're going into the local bar and get yourself drunk and say well god will forgive me it doesn't work that way that's right there's a line between the grace of god and the making a disgrace of god that's right that's a disgrace of god yes but you know and god knows in your heart you have every intention and you have every purpose and and the very fiber of your being your soul uh to to not sin or to not make a mistake or not to do anything wrong that's your desire that's your heart very much god knows that so when you slip up and make a mistake there's grace there right amen there's grace to take care of that into and to annihilate that and to send that back on the head of satan where it lays till the day of judgment yes friend satan will be guilty of the things that you committed in your flesh that's right because he's the one that's guilty of it to begin with that's right he's the author and the finisher been of unbelief he's the father of lies right yeah that means from his very loins comes forth lies deceit and and that's that's his trip that's what he does to try to get you to deceive to try to get you to just believe when you do that now there's grace and see we're talking about the mystery of god and in christ that mystery are the mysteries plural of god just like we talk about there's only one sin remember we know there's only one sin what's that one sin it's unbelief of course but that unbelief will lead to many many many different things that you do wrong or sins of plural that you commit in your life but there's actually only one and that's just unbelief yes now getting to the spiritual aspect the spiritual aspect we go back to matthew chapter 6 again into the lord's prayer this is where we left it off last week we went through the lord's prayer he didn't didn't break it down but just focused on this one scripture so i'm gonna just read this one scripture here today now we've got that second eve the bride restored she had to be restored first jesus had to come jesus had to go away jesus had to die shed his blood go to hell and raise again to bring that the possibility of that restoration back to us that restoration is a process of as brother ram talked about being in the pawn shop uh you were in that position and you got in the devil's pawn shop and there had to be a price paid paid to get you out of that pawn shop yes when he got you out of that pawn shop it puts you back in a right position again that purchase that redemption that brought you back to that place when that's restored when that was restored and brought back to that to that place through the blood of jesus christ it brought the ability of of the restoration of the kingdom now this restoration again let's go uh matthew chapter uh chapter six verses nine and ten matthew six nine and ten praise the lord matthew 6 9 10. after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven holy is thy name hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come remember we're talking about the kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven remember that spiritual kingdom come that spiritual kingdom come the prayer that jesus said thy kingdom come well if that kingdom comes where does it come to it comes to a willing subject it comes a predestinated subject that kingdom comes and takes its abode in earth in this earth in your part of the dust of the earth god comes and makes his abode when he does that that prayer thy kingdom lord come that kingdom being him the holy spirit come so that your will would be done in this earth as you've already seen it lord as you have predestined as you have determined as you have foreign and sought in your mind let it be in me lord yes let me do that purpose that's going back to the preeminence of god having that preeminence in us amen so that your purpose your will lord not mine be done through me in here as it was in heaven what is that brought us to that kingdom into us that spirit coming into a willing vessel so now that restoration has taken place because god has put his life in you if god has placed his life in you he has shown to himself to the devil to the world to everybody around you that you belong to him amen amen you have been brought back and restored back to that position right back to the place that was intended before the fall the garden of eden amen back to that place again now for the king and the queen to reign in well there had to be that restoration first because if there if there had not been a restoration of first the king then where would we be living today we'd be well but before then the gentiles were just heathens we were just we were just animals carrying clubs on our backs and we were heathen people we weren't even a people right we would be going to hell faster than anything but even if you but even if you want to institute the the jewish tradition that god had given in the garden of eden there with killing the two lambs which was the second signification of jesus coming the innocent lamb shedding its blood the third of course was able when he offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice by doing what offering an innocent lamb and the blood that covered so we would still be living under simply a covering of blood of some animal or a bowler or goat or something like that or the the process of the uh of the aryanic priesthood that we were supposed that we would be under even if we were in jury we would still be in that condition which did nothing but cover sin it didn't do away with sin right the sin the desires that everything that was there was still there even after they worshiped right all that was still there god did not take that was not annihilated from their lives because the perfect shed blood of jesus to to to do away with that original sin had not happened so if he hadn't come then there's no way that the queen could have been restored but now that that was restored he said i must go away so that when so that i can come back and live in you very much so on the day of pentecost 120 was in an upper room by the obedience of the word of god they were in an upper room and that that fulfillment of that part of the restoration began right there when the spirit of god came down and like a licks of fire lit upon all 120 of them and the bible says that the spirit came on them and in them so it wasn't simply an anointing friend it was an indwelling it was what came in them right not just on them a lot of people in the world today a lot of christians a lot of nominal christians uh pentecostals whatever uh charismatic they they live on an anointing and and that's all they have is just a simple anointing yeah it's the spirit of god right but we know that spirit is lifting and going back to the jews because this gentile dispensation is about over right so it's simply an anointing that they live under yeah the gifts operate and things happen like absolutely sure do but remember gifts and callings of god are without repentance that's right so if a person is born with that gift and they get into the right atmosphere that that gift is going to operate and they'd be absolutely true yes but the person that is being manifested from can absolutely be a devil that's right that's the truth because they work under that anointing that's right but on the day of pentecost god identified himself with those people by just by not only anointing them but going in them now you've got an indwelling presence of god purchasing back you because he he took control of your soul uh uh first john chapter three i love that scripture because that seed remains in you he brought it back and that became his property right my i want to read i'm going to read something a little bit i just love this quote but it became his property now you look at this sticky flesh yeah it's still sticky even your spirit is influenced of the devil things the world your imagination your memory conscious infection it's all affected by the things of the world that's right it all comes into the seed tastes still smelling hearing it and then it influences you that's right but you've got something out that's inside the inside that is taking control of your soul that is purge just you this is not me my spirit's not even me you know who i am who i am is what is identified on the inside of the inside because that's what god's concerned with right god's concerned about your souls that's right so that's what he come to redeem he brought it back now the full redemption of course is going to happen romans 8 23 again it said when these bodies are redeemed we go home in a rapture or if we go by the great we're still going to rapture and and and meet the lord in the air go the mayor suffer the land for redemption but at this time that redemption that that restoration has taken place because god has purchased you god has taken control over your soul now you no longer bot you no longer belong to yourself you have been bought with a price yes that price was the shed of blood of an innocent lamb jesus christ yes he purchased you back now you belong to him the restoration in function that's still taking place now let's go over to luke chapter 17 luke chapter 17. now again we're still we're still getting in that midst to that restoration of the kingdom of his kingdom that restoration it begins spiritually and it ends up physically right because we're going to a physically restored evening people argue about going back to pentecost they can argue all we want about going back to pentecost i'm going back to the beginning amen for it was in the mind of god before the foundation of the world pentecost fine as that was restoration of the gifts the outpouring of the spirit that's all wonderful friends we need that absolutely but i i'm not going back to pentecost i'm going back to eden i'm going back to where everything was perfect everything was right no sickness no sin no death no sorrow no hospitals not a cove at 19 not an ambulance not hospital we're going back to the place of perfection it won't be a single shovel amen get a hole for a grave thank you lord because it will be yeah right amen that's right won't be a need for these things won't be a corn on toad amen it'll be perfect that's what i'm looking for but this restoration now this spiritual restoration luke 17 20 and uh and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come look at this now they're inquiring pharisees demanding of jesus uh when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation in other words you don't say oh there it is oh well there it is oh well go over to this city oh we'll go to this state go to this country it doesn't come with observation it doesn't come to say oh there it is oh we we have found the kingdom no it doesn't come with observation neither shall they say low here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is where within you amen if you've been born again if you've been filled with the spirit of god yes the kingdom of god now resides in you he broke himself up there on pentecost when it was once in a one man jesus christ the fullness of the godhead bottle now he broke himself up and now you are complete in him he's broke himself in a mini-member body now that kingdom is now where the kingdom of god is within me is within you it's not with observation he was there we got to go to this city you got to go over here it's like the welsh revival brother adam talked about remember the welsh revival broke out and it became an international sensation around the world and look friend it wasn't like they had twitter and twitter and whatever they got to facebook and and and what's out and then they ain't having that stuff this was no internet uh i don't even know how well their phone system was if they was even invented then but it was so widespread that around the world people came from all over to participate in the vulture revival these men came and they wanted to see where the walt's revival was they wanted to be a part of it and they found this old man twirling his uh a policeman twirling his billy stick there on the road they said uh sir could you help us he says certainly and he said we've come from so and so such and such and we wanted to see and participate and be a part of the wealthy revival sir could you point us to the world's revival is it over here is it over there and the man said no sir well is it in this auditorium no sir is it in this church no sir is it in this group of people no sir is it in the message no sir hello that's right no sir well sir could you point us in the direction of where the ralph's revival is he said you're looking at it i am the welsh revival yes everybody else that was a part of that was the welsh revival what are you today you are the bride's revival amen the bride revival is in you yes because the kingdom of god has come and is in you that's right that restoration has come and take its place in your life now the spirit of god the kingdom of god is in you yeah remember that's the restoration that's god bringing himself back to that place look at this let me move on brother brown said this is christ the mystery of god revealed which is the kind of where we've taken this subject from a man said the other day to me standing talking he said well what denomination do you belong to program said none he said what reven said none i said i belong to a kingdom well how do you the man say well how do you join that he says you don't join it you're born into it amen read the scripture a couple of times the last couple services amen corinth first corinthians by one spirit we are all baptized born into one body one body he said you don't join it you're born into it the man said what kingdom is that he said brother brahman said the mystical body of jesus christ amen and as we talked about that preeminence friend that body is what not just in this building not just in tucson arizona united states this body is an international bride worldwide america god has members of this body all over the world that's right amen and we're all one we're all a part of that same body no matter where we are all kindred tongue nation people we're all we're one one when one part of the body hurts the other part hurts when one part of the body suffers the other part of the body suffers yes people talk about well there hasn't been that great persecution or squeeze as they like to call it down and and and i think well what do you think that squeeze contains of just the people in your church just the people in your city your state just the people in the united states what do you think consists of the squeeze or the people that are part of this body they're international right well if a part of the body in china is suffering then all the body is suffering right when one of the party uh part of the body in russia is being squeezed we're all being squeezed because we're all a part of the same body understand i said the mystical body of jesus christ by one spirit we're all baptized into this body born by his spirit when we then then born by his spirit then we belong to that kingdom amen his kingdom that's right the restoration of his kingdom it's his people it's what he predestined is what he foreknew it's what god determined not my determination it's god's determination and friend that is a kingdom that cannot be moved it's a kingdom that cannot be shaken remember hebrews i believe it's hebrews 12 all that can be shaken will be shaken right but what cannot be shaken now only things that will remain are the things of god god himself is the only one that cannot be shaken thus the only part of you that cannot be shaken is that part of you who god is amen it cannot be moved this is an everlasting kingdom let me just read psalms 145. you can turn there if you'd like but i'm just going to read this one scripture david said psalms 145-13 if you want to write it down or turn it's up to you but it says thy kingdom david of course speaking to the lord thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom praise the lord there is no end to his kingdom amen you know there was no beginning to his kingdom either amen right eternal right never had a beginning does not have an end thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and thy dominion endure through all generations why because it's god it's god and and and all that come from him all that he is brought or issued forth has issued forth in that same light that same position that we belong to him we are a part of him if you have eternal life the only way that you can have eternal life is that part of you that's him that's right because he's the only thing eternal so if you're eternal that means you are a thought an attribute of god before the foundation of the world god put your name on the lamb's book of life amen amen hallelujah oh god aren't you thankful saints amen he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my words never pass away look at this now again christ the mystery of god revealed he said you don't need no creeds then denominations has perished but the headship itself recognized in the body by personal identifications god identifying himself proves the headship to the body then we are united under one vindicated headship and that is christ the vindicated headship is christ i'm sorry friend but the vindicated headship of this bride is not william branham that's right the vindicated headship of this bride is jesus christ that's right amen that's right all brother brown did was point us to him so that the wedding would take place not between brother branham and us and him or or us and him and brother brown no it's between us and jesus christ that's right praise the lord thank you lord we are united under one vindicated headship that is christ the word of god neither any church then our headship our headship is a kingdom our headship is the kingdom that is where within you praise the lord the kingdom of god is within you said the bible jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is of the word of god made spirit and life in our life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in the day when the lord uh when the word and god was one right same thing the word of god is one in his church today and his church today bride making it the headship of the body that it redeemed back there's that word amen redeemed to bring the message in the last day taken up uh uh taken up resurrected from the dead to go back and restore again as adam and eve in the beginning in the garden of eden as it was in the garden of eden that's where we belong friend amen that's where we are today that's what that resurrection was to bring forth heavens and earth will pass but this word what did you say kingdom can never pass away what did david say it's an everlasting kingdom this kingdom and not only can this kingdom not be done away with this kingdom cannot move this kingdom cannot change jesus said heavens and earth will pass away i i brought this to you before it's been a while but you look at those two words pass away now i can't pronounce the greek of it but if you look at those two words and you go back and you study pass away in the concordance you'll find it's the exact same two words by greek meaning that peter spoke of when he talked about this earth passing away well brother branham makes reference of course in future home of that passing away and that passing away does not mean annihilated it means changing from one form to another so this earth according to peter would pass away or change forms it'll change from one form to another right but jesus using that exact same greek word said that my word cannot what pass away or change from one form to another it cannot change same word cannot change cannot pass away cannot be done away with but cannot change it is unmovable unshakable praise the lord amen that's quite a statement considering what's been going on in this world in the past several years now the people's faith getting shook and tribulations come and people hear something about this or that with the messenger brother branham and all of a sudden there they go they're gone they won't have anything more to do some people just leave they don't want to have anything to do with christian or religion or whatever i i unfortunately have a facebook friend i just redid my facebook thing a little begrudgingly but i did and and somebody from the past that had on there that used to go the tabernacle is still on there and uh that person posts some kind of not nice things sometimes and i'm actually at the point i hate to do it but i'm almost to the point of unfriending that person because i i just i'm not someone that likes having cuss words scroll across my facebook feed so uh i'm i'm very close and things so you know so if that kingdom is in you it's unmovable now i'm not saying a person can't fall and be resurrected or brought back i'm not saying a person can't backslide or make mistake or something and come back i pray the lord they do but in the interim i don't want to hear it right i don't want to read that kind of stuff so anyway but you you see though but if that kingdom is in you it is unmovable it is unshakable it's like the revelation i've talked to you about when god's revealed something to your friend nothing can take it from you absolutely nothing can take away that's right and you know my analogy you know i live the life of a white male and why do i live the life of a white male because i'm a white male right i'm not a chinese woman so i don't live the life of a chinese woman because i'm not a chinese woman so when god reveals something to you you can't help but live it because it's who you are yes it becomes a part of you that's that kingdom in you that's the restoration of that kingdom in you praise the lord amen god let that strike home to us today our kingdom is not of this world amen our kingdom is not of this world not of this cosmos anyway world order now it's of this world we're going to come and live back here on this ball of dirt this big rock but this world cosmos this world order we're not this is not our place this is not our kingdom amen you want to vote in the election that's fine i will be if that's your choice you'd like to do that your civic duty that's fine if you don't that's fine amen uh brother dennis talked about wearing his mask in here and any of you you want to that's fine amen nothing wrong but brother nat it's just teresa they they've had a coconut about what two months ago or so yeah and uh and over it and zach had it and over it but praise the lord that's you know if you want to do that's fine there's not a thing in the world wrong with that that but this cosmos we're not a part of this is not our kingdom we live here we do what we do as citizens and uh we live our lives and and we're a part of that brother branham said we identify with america because we're americans because we live here born here and that's what we do but but our kingdom is not of this world our kingdom is not of this cosmos amen we do the things we go to work and we make the money and you know if you want to shed all of it just take every bit of money out of your account uh take your car uh you know because there's not going to be cars over there right there's not going to be any currency so you know if you want to go all out now uh i live all right uh you can come to bring your car over there uh and and just let me know i'll make sure and i'll give you my bank account number and you can just put it all right in there i promise you it'll go to the work of the lord one way or another it'll go to the work of the lord if you want to if you want to just get rid of all that so we live and do what we do here right amen but our kingdom is not of this world amen it's not of this world in the garden of eden there was a great that was well a lot of things took place but this quote i told you i was going to read this great thing that brother brown talks about took place in christ jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever look at this now in the garden of eden satan chose his part of the man did you know that in the garden of eden satan chose his part of the man his head his intellectuals that was satan's choice sega came to bring deception through intellectual he still does the exact same thing amen through intellectuals see there again when we get remember we talked about last week brother said in a millennium all the wrongs will be made right you think we're going to be driving around cars motorcycles buses in the millennium no uh absolutely not you think there's gonna be ambulances and and hospitals and all these things in the millennium no all those wrongs are gonna be made right it's just that thousand-year period that completely crushes the curse of the original sin man will live one thousand days or one thousand years as one day with the lord one full day no man has done it since the fall methuselah 969 i think came the closest but that will be the breaking complete annihilating of that original sin the garden of eden amen satan chose in the garden of eden his part of the man that was his head his intellectuals but god took his heart amen so the restoration of this kingdom is not going to be up here right it's not going to be in the mind it's not going to be on the flesh or in your spirit god chose the heart god chose the soul of the man that was where god chose to operate and dwell not in your intellect not in your mind not in your intelligence in your intelligence we vary one from the other you know that there's 20 some odd people in here today 20 some odd people and we probably all would to take an iq test every one of us would vary in some way shape or form from the other that's right i wouldn't take it for embarrassment but if we did i wouldn't want to be embarrassed in front of you but if we did we would all vary one to the other but if you got down into the soul of the man if he got down into the soul of the person every single human is the same right everybody every soul of every man red white green purple blue yellow don't matter no matter what language they speak male female doesn't matter their soul is worth 10 million words everybody amen same deals in the person's intellect he chose in the garden of eden the man's mind the man's intellect but god took his heart god chose the soul so where's the restoration gonna take place it's this spiritual restoration before the physical restoration which lord willing will get to next week that spiritual restoration has to take place in the person's heart the person's soul not your mind not your intellect right all those things are going to change of course when the redemption of this body takes place from going to rapture all that's going to be done away with but right now satan chose the mind the intellect god chose the heart the intellect will reason well i'm this way and i'm that way you'll never get anywhere with god there but your heart your faith will make you believe things that your mind knows nothing about your heart your soul will cause you to have faith in god to things that you can't see takes phil smeller here that your spirit can't have memory affection conscience reason none of that your soul your faith your heart will make you or bring you to believe things that your mind knows nothing about right that's right praise the lord amen that's how we know who he is that's how we know how this restoration has come back and you look around the world today and you see how much satan especially in these big churches and steepled and stained glass windows and the fineries and the millions and billions of dollars that they have has been controlled by the person's intellect it's been controlled by their emotion it's been controlled by their by their feelings instead of by their heart right god takes the heart of man and will put him on a corner to preach the gospel to whoever will listen god will take a heart of a man or a heart of three men and and bring to pass a little building so a little group can come and gather together and hear the word of god in worship that's what god does the intellect will have 20 people in a thousand member church building with 10 people in the pews saying all men just right i ain't worried about how all men you say what about what you do how you live what you say what you say where you go what your life is being born again of the spirit of god letting our lives become closer to him us becoming more like him amen amen it's got to be about relationship amen my wife my wife and i have had a relationship for for near 40 years now 35 years of marriage almost 40 years of knowing each other and we've gotten pretty familiar with each other although sometimes it seems like we don't know each other at all but but some of that comes with change though too but but that relationship comes to the place to where you even sometimes talk alike people even say you start looking like each other i'm sorry dear start looking like each other that relationship see if you have that relationship with jesus christ it does the same thing you know even on a grander schedule because it's a a scale because it's a spiritual aspect and not a physical aspect it's spiritual then you become to talk like him and act like him and sound like him amen why do you think they call them holy rollers amen amen amen praise the lord a holy roller is nothing but a roller to roll out the form of jesus christ you roll out the cookie dough and you you you uh stamp it to make a gingerbread man and there you've got it there he is see you got to roll him out first amen you got to roll them out on the street sometimes even but see that's god that's all god will work amen god don't put on big shows right god don't don't play for anybody right he don't clown for anybody that's right amen control the heart of the people and and the way he goes doing what his purpose and will is in this world amen she flies by the uh under the radar if if we could say that crude expression that way she flies uh undetected most of the time right right amen see you brother says now you believe things have faith in things your mind knows nothing about you cast down reasoning see you must be positive stay there until you're positive see a couple of scriptures as i close here first corinthians we'll follow finish this up first corinthians chapter 15. first corinthian first corinthians chapter 15 verse 15. i'm going to bring these two scriptures together in a close here first corinthians 15 15. now this i say brethren that flesh and blood what did we just read flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god it's not the flesh and blood what did god choose in the garden of eden satan chose the mind god chose the heart it's not in flesh and blood flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither does corruption inherit in corruption so it can't be something that we say well i did this oh that's wonderful you know but where's the heart right oh i gave this oh that's great but where's the heart right amen and now you can do that the heart's in the right place the heart's in the right place god is purchased and you do so that's see that that's faith with works right amen there's nothing wrong with the work but just don't take the work and try to make that the partner the platform you're going to use to get to heaven right a work's not going to get you there that's right right you do the works because something's in you to do it that's right romans chapter 14 16 17. we'll conclude with this as we just the read the first corinthians not in flesh and blood first corinthians now romans 14 16 17 let not then your good be evil spoken of for the kingdom of god is not me and drink it's not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost righteousness peace joy in the holy ghost that is the kingdom of god these things not in me to drink not in flesh and blood not in the tangible things but it's in the intangible the things that god the unseen brother graham talked about the unseen things you look to that are the unseen where god has restored the kingdom back you look and say we still live in satan well but the spiritual aspect remember brother brown talked about this it was quite a a thing that was mentioned many times there for a while when the last seed comes in the rapture will go well and and i know brother graham said that that's fine i don't focus on that necessarily i because people get to the place that they don't hardly witness anymore or try to uh uh uh evangelize or anything because you know they don't think there's any point in it uh i've known people like that and even in this message i've known people like that so i don't like to get to that point but there is a point to it because brother branham said it but what he's saying is that when that last seed comes in that completion of that kingdom the completion of it has to happen it started back in genesis 3 of 13 i think we read 14 wherever it was that's where it began but it's got to be a completion when that last one is redeemed when that last one has received him and god has come and taken abode in that person that kingdom has come to them amen then the completion of that has happened the purpose that god had set this in motion for will be finished and when that happens then the gentiles we go then god goes and deals with the jews they institute the daily oblation again and god reveals himself to his people and and then and then they come in and they're they're saved in a day we know the bible says they'll be saved in a day because they're a people they're one nation we're a many member body internationally right god takes his bride home and then he begins to deal with the jews and then she's dealing with the jews armageddon sets in and the tribulation and you look at it today and wonder if it's not already started right and some of the things going on around the country but anyway it hasn't i don't believe it has i'm still here so our game couldn't sit in we're still here right but it's going to happen it's at that point so that last seed that last seed comes gets to that a place and they're adopted that they've placed into that body amen then then the rapture will take place has that happened i don't know i don't know but it's not going to affect me trying to talk to people about jesus it's not going to stop me from trying to witness to other people to get them to christ somehow even if they're knocking the bride you can give them a a morsel of something to get them through tribulation will help right amen help maybe at some point they won't be the bride that says they're and judges the rest of humanity but maybe you can speak something to somebody that god will put them on the right hand instead of sending them to hell right right amen we don't know we do what we can for the lord while we're here amen praise the lord god restoring himself to us amen amen god bless you could you stand today
