[34:09] for us you know it should be something
[34:11] every day brother Bram talked about a

[34:21] much she's loved and make her know how
[34:23] much she's appreciated and make her know

[35:05] Lord we're so thankful amen I don't know
[35:08] how much like brother Danny said how
[35:11] much the rest of the world really even
[35:13] understands it just it's just become so
[35:15] much of a formality it's become so much
[35:18] of a
[35:19] commercialization amen Thanksgiving is
[35:22] skipped over people
[35:24] go all Halloween and go all out and then
[35:28] Christmas comes and they go all out they
[35:29] go from one polar into the other amen
[35:33] praise the Lord but there's right there
[35:35] in the middle that you can never forget
[35:38] amen that our Founding Father set for
[35:40] this nation time of worship and a time
[35:44] of Thanksgiving that we give to the Lord
[35:46] Jesus amen are you thankful today praise
[35:50] the Lord very thankful I want you to
[35:53] know too that when I was looking up
[35:56] songs week before last these are the
[35:59] songs that the Lord put together for me
[36:01] for today and it didn't even realize it
[36:03] was the Sunday before Thanksgiving oh
[36:06] that is the truth did not even realize
[36:08] it till yesterday thank you Lord and I
[36:10] thought wow tomorrow is Thanksgiving
[36:13] maybe uh maybe Lord will give me
[36:15] something about Thanksgiving uh for
[36:17] service today and I get here this
[36:19] morning and I look at the songs I'm like
[36:21] my those are all the songs I would
[36:23] probably sing for Thanksgiving to the
[36:25] Lord amen and God already put him there
[36:28] praise the Lord he's mindful amen and
[36:30] I'm so thankful just to know that we are
[36:33] we are his bought with a price he leads
[36:36] us and guides us amen praise the lord we
[36:39] want to go to the Lord in prayer now
[36:41] we've noticed there's quite a few people
[36:42] missing today amen we miss when
[36:46] anybody's not we miss so very much amen
[36:49] but brother Dennis is out as we all know
[36:51] we text to let you all know that brother
[36:53] Dennis was having problems with his left
[36:55] knee bothered him really bad um uh
[37:01] Joel could oh you've got him already see
[37:03] he's already a step up head me yeah amen
[37:06] so efficient thank you buddy
[37:10] um and he went to the doctor uh and
[37:13] found out that the that he had shingles
[37:16] the shingles were really flaring up his
[37:18] knee maybe more so he been having a lot
[37:21] of problems with his right knee because
[37:22] his right knee has not been doesn't have
[37:24] knee replacement just kind of bone on
[37:27] bone so his right knee's been balling he
[37:29] talked about maybe doing a transplant of
[37:30] his right knee this next year uh but
[37:33] then his left knee started flaring up
[37:34] which was unusual but found out again he
[37:37] had shingles uh and for all I've heard
[37:40] about shingles and anybody that's had
[37:41] them and my dad had them back when I was
[37:44] a kid uh only thing I remember about
[37:47] them is they're extremely painful that's
[37:50] the one thing I remember about them uh
[37:52] of course it matters and sometimes it's
[37:54] different depending on where on the body
[37:56] they manifest themselves but uh the one
[37:59] thing I hear is they're extremely
[38:01] painful uh sometimes they last even for
[38:04] months but we're going to believe for
[38:06] perfect healing for brother Dennis the
[38:07] Lord will touch him also sister Norman's
[38:10] not been feeling well this week uh she's
[38:12] feeling better but she thought she'd
[38:14] stay home get some more rest make sure
[38:16] that she she's feeling a lot better
[38:19] sister Lydia had been around some people
[38:21] that she uh had found out they had covid
[38:24] so sister Lydia is fine but just
[38:26] precaution sister Lydia stayed home uh
[38:30] to make sure that if something happened
[38:32] or if she happened to be around that
[38:34] person something so uh just remember
[38:37] Sister lyia in prayer of course my
[38:38] wife's not here um she woke up well she
[38:42] was coughing and hacking all night or a
[38:44] lot of the night having trouble sleeping
[38:47] uh and she woke up this morning and she
[38:49] sounded pretty rough but then she text
[38:51] me later and said that she uh when she
[38:53] got up she was very dizzy and you
[38:56] probably all know my wife has gets cases
[38:59] of vertigo and when that dizzy spell
[39:01] hits her there's nothing we had found
[39:04] that she can do but go lay down and go
[39:07] to bed try to sleep at all uh so she
[39:10] stayed home today uh so I trust and pray
[39:12] that you just remember her in prayer as
[39:15] well brother Danny has a prayer request
[39:17] here it says uh we were notified that we
[39:20] have new owners again at my apartment
[39:22] complex does that mean someone bought
[39:24] the apartment complex again yes okay so
[39:26] somebody new owns the complex yeah just
[39:29] okay recently okay they they even sent
[39:32] out a notice that numer numerous
[39:35] improvements including a high grade uh
[39:38] with a
[39:39] key including a high excuse me High Gate
[39:43] uh with a key to come and go which is
[39:45] safety is there's a big
[39:48] concern uh I got a certified letter
[39:50] stating that my rent will be increased
[39:54] by
[39:55] $295
[39:57] starting January 1 I got till
[40:02] 121 which is just a couple of weeks away
[40:04] to make a decision to Stay or Leave
[40:07] praying that I will make the right
[40:09] decision amen just pray the Lord touch
[40:12] you help you brother Danny make the
[40:14] right decision do the right thing
[40:16] that's that's quite a jump
[40:19] $295 especially especially for that
[40:22] place I was getting ready to say
[40:23] especially for that area no offense but
[40:26] uh
[40:26] it's it's not the Primo area of town to
[40:29] live in for that kind of rent to go up
[40:32] like that so we just remember that for
[40:34] brother Danny prayer the Lord would just
[40:36] have intervene in that
[40:38] situation uh got a prayer here prayer
[40:40] request prayer for Pat's neighbor uh

[41:26] for me and all he's just he's just a
[41:28] good guy he came to lunch di or two at
[41:30] Coopers and um uh just pray the Lord
[41:34] would just move on him we're all we're
[41:36] all growing older so uh I remember one
[41:40] time when brother Brandon was praying

[53:37] little eer about saying it but I'm going
[53:40] to say it anyway I wasn't anticipating
[53:43] this to be a very long service today so
[53:46] we'll see again though a lot of times my
[53:50] expectations are not the same as his so
[53:54] we just try to to do what he leads us to
[53:59] do whatever that might be amen let's
[54:02] turn over to Psalms chapter
[54:06] 100 amen I know we talked last week
[54:09] about um finishing up that last part
[54:12] that we had on that God in Simplicity
[54:15] and false teachers that the last part of
[54:18] the third part of that uh but um just
[54:21] felt to do something about Thanksgiving
[54:23] today at uh not that
[54:27] it's makes that difference every day of
[54:30] Thanksgiving
[54:32] but when we have this special time to be
[54:35] with family friends give thanks to the
[54:39] Lord um hopefully maybe a Grateful
[54:43] Nation amen because it's something that
[54:46] we that we have here in the United
[54:48] States a thankfulness uh you go over in
[54:51] Australia there's not a Thanksgiving
[54:53] that I know of not like we have England
[54:57] of course they don't have one our uh a
[55:00] lot of our thankfulness is that we were
[55:03] able to come here for Religious Freedom
[55:05] and worship the God how we wanted to
[55:07] without the oppression of the Catholic
[55:09] church in England amen amen so here we
[55:13] have it and it's important to us it
[55:15] means a lot that we're very thankful for

[56:40] Thanksgiving father that the foundation
[56:44] of that Thanksgiving is rooted solely in
[56:47] you so many other things that we have
[56:51] come from Pagan Traditions or different
[56:54] things Lord and God they are what they
[56:56] are we celebrate them as such Lord and
[56:59] as we do for you God and but Lord this
[57:02] is that time Lord that we know that the

[58:13] Jesus Christ
[58:15] amen
[58:17] amen Psalms chapter 100 I want to read
[58:21] the entire chapter just five verses Make
[58:25] a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye
[58:28] Lands serve the Lord with gladness come
[58:32] before his presence with seeing know ye
[58:36] that the Lord he is God it is he that
[58:39] hath made us and not we ourselves we are
[58:43] his people and the Sheep of his
[58:47] pasture enter into his gates with
[58:50] Thanksgiving and into his courts with
[58:53] praise be thank thankful unto him and
[58:56] bless his name for the Lord is good his
[58:59] Mercy is Everlasting and his truth
[59:02] endureth to all
[59:04] generations and you can be seated if
[59:06] You' like that's amen as actually that
[59:12] was my mom's favorite
[59:16] Psalm my mom always likes Psalms 101 she
[59:19] like the whole chapter but Psalms
[59:22] 101 as many of you probably know my
[59:25] family knows how much my mom loved to
[59:28] sing yes but she sang about as well as
[59:32] brother
[59:33] brandom and about as well as I do which
[59:36] isn't saying a whole lot but she loved
[59:39] to sing so she love this verse that said
[59:42] Make a Joyful Noise amen now a lot of
[59:46] people go around and say well the the
[59:48] Bible says the noise is supposed to be
[59:50] joyful but friend if it's coming from
[59:52] your heart is worship to the Lord is
[59:54] joyful it doesn't matter how melodious
[59:57] it is but it does matter how joyful it
[1:00:00] is when it comes from a Heart of Worship
[1:00:02] amen when it comes from a Heart of
[1:00:04] Worship it's joyful and it's joyful to
[1:00:07] the Lord praise the Lord so uh she was
[1:00:10] not afraid to get in front of anybody at
[1:00:12] any church at any time and singing what
[1:00:15] the lord gave her she wasn't ashamed to
[1:00:18] make a tape she had a cassette tape put
[1:00:21] out amen that brother Dwight Hall made
[1:00:23] for her and and and my mom knew and she
[1:00:27] actually asked brother Dwight who has
[1:00:29] obviously he very talented good musician
[1:00:31] and singer and she asked him when he
[1:00:34] went to do to go to that tape she said
[1:00:36] brother would you please just would you
[1:00:39] sing all these songs for these are the
[1:00:40] song She Wrote all the songs on her
[1:00:42] cassette if you ever heard her cassette
[1:00:44] they probably still have some at the
[1:00:46] Tabernacle um they weren't in great
[1:00:48] demand most people like uh uh like Great
[1:00:52] Performances and all when they listen
[1:00:54] but um you know a lot of people don't
[1:00:57] want to listen to like someone like my
[1:00:59] mom or brother brandom so there's
[1:01:01] probably a lot of them still left I I
[1:01:03] had a bunch left after she passed I I'm
[1:01:05] not sure where they are but had several
[1:01:09] but anyway if you've listen to it excuse
[1:01:12] me every song on that tape my mother
[1:01:15] wrote she wrote she wrote over a hundred
[1:01:18] songs she only put six or eight on the
[1:01:20] cassette but she went and asked brother
[1:01:22] Hall she said would you sing these songs
[1:01:24] on this tape for me she was she really
[1:01:26] didn't want to put out the songs with
[1:01:29] her singing them and brother twice said
[1:01:31] oh absolutely not he said I won't even
[1:01:33] do it if you don't sing them and she
[1:01:35] said okay it's every song on there my
[1:01:38] mother sang amen and it is what it is
[1:01:41] but God gave her that Talent amen that
[1:01:44] desire praise the Lord and I inherited
[1:01:48] that desire I love to sing I Love to
[1:01:51] Worship the Lord uh can't carry it tune
[1:01:54] in a 10 bucket but I love to sing so
[1:01:57] pardon me if it bothers you uh if
[1:02:00] there's something that you run away I it
[1:02:03] doesn't matter I love to sing I I i' i'
[1:02:06] prefer have a song leader for here but I
[1:02:09] love to sing I've always loved to sing I
[1:02:11] like music of course my children kind of
[1:02:13] got that too they love music um can sing
[1:02:17] Mike and T the sing I don't know how
[1:02:19] they got to sing but they're very good
[1:02:21] singers me and tabias or and Sonia is
[1:02:25] not very good but but love to sing amen
[1:02:28] and Make a Joyful Noise to give
[1:02:31] Thanksgiving to the Lord and that is the
[1:02:33] whole point of it amen a lot of times we
[1:02:36] we probably don't sing as uh as much as
[1:02:40] we should in church as we you know maybe
[1:02:43] we don't feel comfortable or something
[1:02:44] but it doesn't matter that's not the
[1:02:46] point the point is to make a Joyful
[1:02:48] Noise to the Lord and if it's something
[1:02:51] of worship from your heart is joyful the
[1:02:53] Lord receives his it as joyful amen and
[1:02:55] if he receives it as joyful then what
[1:02:58] else do you want what else do we expect
[1:03:00] if we're singing to try to get
[1:03:02] somebody's attention well that's a
[1:03:03] different deal if you're singing to try
[1:03:05] to get a record deal from some record
[1:03:07] company or some that's a whole different
[1:03:09] deal but if you're singing To Worship
[1:03:11] the Lord if you're singing to make a
[1:03:13] Joyful Noise if you're singing Because
[1:03:15] You Love the Lord and you want to
[1:03:17] worship him and you want to worship Him
[1:03:19] according to the scripture and you want
[1:03:20] to lift your voice and worship to God
[1:03:22] and give Thanksgiving to the Lord there
[1:03:25] you go amen then who else what else is
[1:03:29] there for anyone to say but that that we
[1:03:31] enter into his courts with Thanksgiving
[1:03:34] amen into his house with praise that's
[1:03:38] why we start our services out with
[1:03:39] lifting our voices to the Lord to
[1:03:41] worship and to praise him there's a
[1:03:44] particular point of this that I want to
[1:03:45] get to though in this service today
[1:03:47] let's go over to
[1:03:49] Leviticus I want to read a verse of
[1:03:51] scripture out of Leviticus chapter 22
[1:03:55] because as you all know we sang the
[1:03:58] song we give the sacrifice amen we give
[1:04:03] this sacrifice of praise um and and I
[1:04:07] will let you
[1:04:08] know if I move around a little bit more
[1:04:11] just understand it it starts hurting my
[1:04:13] knee if I just stand in one place too
[1:04:15] long so it helps me if I move a little
[1:04:17] bit more I kind of move anyway but maybe
[1:04:20] more so than I normally do so uh if it
[1:04:24] if it bothers you I'm sorry but um
[1:04:27] Leviticus 22 verse
[1:04:30] 29 amen Leviticus 22:29 listen to this
[1:04:34] now because we we sang the song we give
[1:04:37] the sacrifice of praise the praise that
[1:04:41] we give we give as a sacrifice unto the
[1:04:44] Lord uh I remember a brother I've
[1:04:47] mentioned this before brother dentist
[1:04:48] knows very well uh that mentioned about
[1:04:52] uh we don't we don't U uh we don't hold
[1:04:55] the Old Testament uh like we do the New
[1:04:58] Testament I said brother it's all the
[1:05:00] word of God am you can't get rid of any
[1:05:02] of it Genesis 1 to revelation 22 it's
[1:05:05] all the inspired word of God he said
[1:05:07] well we don't sacrifice animals anymore
[1:05:09] said yes but we offer up spiritual
[1:05:12] sacrifices to the Lord giving him thanks
[1:05:15] With Praise of our lips amen amen that's
[1:05:17] the sacrifice we give so to look at the
[1:05:21] comparison that we have that we give
[1:05:23] thanks giving we just read as David said
[1:05:26] Thanksgiving praise to the Lord we give
[1:05:29] Thanksgiving to the Lord it it I believe
[1:05:32] it should be in the same context The
[1:05:36] Same Spirit as God had explained to them
[1:05:40] as they were giving literal
[1:05:42] sacrifices literal animal sacrifices I
[1:05:46] believe is the lord gave them
[1:05:47] instruction for those literal animal
[1:05:50] sacrifices that that instruction goes
[1:05:52] for us today and our spiritual Worship
[1:05:55] in our spiritual sacrifice so I'm going
[1:05:58] to look at a couple of places and
[1:06:00] recognize one particular thing about our
[1:06:03] worship that should be in our hearts all
[1:06:05] the time now look Leviticus
[1:06:09] 22:29 and when ye will offer look now
[1:06:13] when ye will offer a sacrifice of
[1:06:16] Thanksgiving to the Lord offer it at
[1:06:19] your own
[1:06:21] will amen when you're going to off offer
[1:06:24] an offering unto the Lord offer it at
[1:06:27] your own will right now we we talked
[1:06:30] about this before in different aspects
[1:06:33] uh such as giving monetarily giving
[1:06:35] physically giving of your time uh tithe
[1:06:39] offering that kind of thing God always
[1:06:41] likes a cheerful Giver the scripture
[1:06:44] says God wants someone who gives of
[1:06:47] their heart amen they don't give because
[1:06:50] they want a tax deduction they don't
[1:06:52] give because they have nothing nothing
[1:06:54] better to do they don't give because
[1:06:56] they're forced to give or they become
[1:06:58] some sort of indentured servant they
[1:07:01] give because it's of their heart to give
[1:07:04] they don't give of their abundance they
[1:07:06] give of their substance right someone
[1:07:09] says I don't have time to do something
[1:07:11] that's the best time to do it yeah
[1:07:14] someone says I don't have the money to
[1:07:15] give that's the best time to give yeah
[1:07:18] amen Lord someone says I don't have the
[1:07:20] the the strength to get that's the best
[1:07:22] time to give I could have easily called
[1:07:25] service off today because of my voice
[1:07:27] because of my knee but I want to give
[1:07:29] everything I've got to the Lord if I
[1:07:31] fall down flat on this floor I know
[1:07:33] there's somebody here that'll pick me up
[1:07:35] right amen but if I'm going to do it
[1:07:37] it's going to be done at in praise and
[1:07:40] thanksgiving to the Lord Jesus amen amen
[1:07:44] and that's I believe what the Lord wants
[1:07:45] of all of us that it be given again the
[1:07:49] example that we have of our spiritual
[1:07:52] sacrifice mirroring the physical
[1:07:54] sacrifice that they gave one of the
[1:07:57] great instructions to give it at your
[1:07:59] own will right you give it freely from
[1:08:02] your heart yes you give it because you
[1:08:04] want to give it you give it of the
[1:08:07] desire to give it when you're forced to
[1:08:09] do something there's no blessing in that
[1:08:12] amen I've heard that people talk about
[1:08:14] how horrible is that and exchanging
[1:08:16] gifts and Christmas and it's a it's an
[1:08:19] act of rest rest of prosity I I I don't
[1:08:22] I don't see it that way
[1:08:24] you know
[1:08:26] because people should give not expecting
[1:08:28] to receive back right and and and and
[1:08:32] when you give you shouldn't expect
[1:08:34] somebody to give back amen now and and
[1:08:38] there shouldn't be an obligation on the
[1:08:40] other end to feel obligated to give back
[1:08:44] amen I so many times that it's happened
[1:08:48] and I've had ministers come here in
[1:08:51] Florida and the mountains and and and go
[1:08:54] to give the love offering for the
[1:08:56] ministering and for the work to the Lord
[1:08:58] and like oh no brother it's okay U you
[1:09:01] know the Lord's bless me and um I don't
[1:09:03] mean to call his name out but when
[1:09:05] brother when brother uh Dan Evans was
[1:09:08] here and preached for us I like to never
[1:09:10] got him to take a love offering yeah we
[1:09:13] took up a little love offering because I
[1:09:15] always give my tithe in than that uh but
[1:09:18] which you know makes it a lot more
[1:09:20] substantial that we as a congregation
[1:09:21] are able to give maybe to a visiting
[1:09:23] minister
[1:09:24] but he looked at it he's like I I can't
[1:09:27] take that I said brother I said don't
[1:09:28] you dare deprive me or this church of
[1:09:31] the blessing God has for us of giving
[1:09:33] this gift to you because you gave to the
[1:09:36] Lord amen you gave to the Lord by your
[1:09:39] time and presence and ministering let us
[1:09:42] give to the Lord by giving to you yes
[1:09:45] amen and that's that's what a Minister's
[1:09:47] tithing is supposed to be anyway is to
[1:09:49] give to the ministry amen but but I
[1:09:53] almost uh he he did take it I mean uh he
[1:09:57] bigger than I am but we would have had a
[1:09:59] contest if he hadn't took it cuz um
[1:10:02] that's just you
[1:10:05] know I've had other people say now don't
[1:10:07] don't don't deprive me of the blessing
[1:10:10] of giving amen because I'm giving it to
[1:10:13] you of my heart I'm giving it to you of
[1:10:15] my free will I'm giving it to you a as
[1:10:19] worship it's a worship you understand a
[1:10:22] giving is a worship we're thankful for
[1:10:25] things but we give as a result it's
[1:10:27] because that we're we're thankful we're
[1:10:30] we're worshiping we're worshiping God
[1:10:33] when we give when we give of ourselves
[1:10:35] when we give of our time everything we
[1:10:37] as we give it's worship we're worshiping
[1:10:40] the Lord amen of Thanksgiving but it's
[1:10:43] to be given of our own free will it's
[1:10:46] not to be given because you feel
[1:10:47] obligated or because you feel trapped or
[1:10:51] you feel forced to uh you you know you
[1:10:54] know
[1:10:55] me
[1:10:57] and 90% of the song Services we've had
[1:11:00] in the past almost eight years of the
[1:11:02] existence of this church I've been the
[1:11:04] song leader and you know me how many
[1:11:07] times and some of you have been here
[1:11:09] since the very first service how many
[1:11:12] times have I ever told you to raise your
[1:11:15] hands right or to clap or to or or to do
[1:11:21] something in worship how many how many
[1:11:23] times have I asked
[1:11:26] you I don't remember any may have amen
[1:11:30] usually if a song says let us lift up
[1:11:32] our holy hands I'm not asking you do it
[1:11:35] of your own free will right now I'm
[1:11:37] getting ready to read a scripture that
[1:11:39] may sound contrary to that but my belief
[1:11:42] is that we are to give it freely if you
[1:11:45] feel to raise your hand and worship you
[1:11:47] raise your hand right if you don't feel
[1:11:50] a spirit moving on you to raise your
[1:11:51] hand don't raise it yeah amen if you
[1:11:54] feel to lift your voice and worship and
[1:11:56] praise and sing as you go right ahead
[1:11:59] and do it if you don't and the spirit's
[1:12:02] not moved you don't do it amen if the
[1:12:05] spirit's moved on you to stand and speak
[1:12:07] in tongues and that's God doing it you
[1:12:10] better do it right if God moves on you
[1:12:13] and tells you to run around this church
[1:12:14] six times you better do iten although I
[1:12:17] would rather do it five or seven not six
[1:12:20] but anyway you better do it yeah don't
[1:12:23] worry about us if God's moving on you
[1:12:26] now you better make sure it's God but if
[1:12:28] God's moving on you to do it do it if he
[1:12:31] does it then just sit right there amen
[1:12:34] but you do it because God's giving you
[1:12:37] to do it not because I'm telling you to
[1:12:39] do it I hear so many times worship
[1:12:42] services and it's okay I'm not
[1:12:44] criticizing it I'm just telling you my
[1:12:46] way I'm not criticizing anybody but so
[1:12:49] many times I hear people say Okay clap
[1:12:51] to the Lord okay raise your hand okay
[1:12:53] okay standy okay do do this and and it's
[1:12:56] just it almost feels like I'm at a
[1:12:58] football game and the cheerleaders are
[1:12:59] saying go team go with I just only thing
[1:13:02] I'm missing is pom
[1:13:04] poms if if I
[1:13:12] want to worship I'm going to worship if
[1:13:15] I'm going to raise my f the spirit move
[1:13:17] I'm going to raise my hand I'm going to
[1:13:19] sing I'm going to praise but I do it of
[1:13:21] my own free will I do it because I love
[1:13:24] the Lord and because I want to worship
[1:13:26] Him amen I want to give everything I
[1:13:29] have in worship to the Lord amen that's
[1:13:32] why I like that part of that song so
[1:13:34] much just forget about yourself we get
[1:13:37] so distracted with everything else going
[1:13:39] on in life you know what friend
[1:13:41] yesterday is gone tomorrow may not ever
[1:13:44] be here but we have right now we try to
[1:13:47] make the best of what we can for what
[1:13:49] God's given us right now thankful for
[1:13:52] what God God has given us right now amen
[1:13:56] praise the Lord and we do it of our own
[1:13:58] free will let's continue let's go over
[1:14:01] to 2
[1:14:06] Chronicles 2 Chronicles chapter
[1:14:09] 29 God wants our
[1:14:12] Thanksgiving our confession our praise
[1:14:15] our worship our testimonies to be of our
[1:14:18] own free will amen these are these
[1:14:23] feasts and these these parties were all
[1:14:26] a part of worship for them in the Old
[1:14:31] Testament they didn't well until it
[1:14:35] became uh a sneak in God's nostrils it
[1:14:38] became a tradition they didn't do it
[1:14:40] because they had to do it they did it
[1:14:42] because he wanted to do it it became a
[1:14:44] feast it became a party it became a
[1:14:48] worship of them when they did when they
[1:14:50] sacrificed an animal or or something the
[1:14:52] Lord had commanded them to do they did
[1:14:54] it as a worship to the Lord amen they
[1:14:58] didn't come because it was 10:30 on
[1:15:00] Sunday morning they did it because it
[1:15:02] was in their heart to do it and that's
[1:15:05] what God loves that's why God wants you
[1:15:08] come any other way that's the problem a
[1:15:11] lot of people have they come and they do
[1:15:14] something not they do it out of
[1:15:16] obligation or they they do it out of
[1:15:19] someone else's expectation and they get
[1:15:21] absolutely nothing and they come and
[1:15:24] they blame God for for not getting
[1:15:28] anything when it's not God's fault God
[1:15:32] has a way that you are to approach him
[1:15:34] by and if we don't approach him by the
[1:15:37] scriptural prescription that we are
[1:15:39] supposed to approach him by then is
[1:15:41] there's no acknowledgement there amen
[1:15:45] don't feel forced
[1:15:48] obligated you come because you want to
[1:15:51] not because it's Sunday at 10:30 or or
[1:15:54] or and see that's the way it got with
[1:15:57] them when it when we got over into
[1:16:00] Isaiah God told him God told Isaiah
[1:16:03] Isaiah told the people you've done this
[1:16:05] year after year all the time and now
[1:16:08] it's nothing to you but a tradition you
[1:16:10] go to okay it's time to getet the animal
[1:16:12] let's get the animals go down let's get
[1:16:14] this over with slit his throat get this
[1:16:16] done and over okay it's fine we're done
[1:16:18] we've done our Penance for the day
[1:16:20] that's no more than the Catholic church
[1:16:22] right well let's wake up at six o'clock
[1:16:24] in the morning so we can go do our
[1:16:25] pentes and so we can make sure and have
[1:16:27] the rest of the day for
[1:16:29] ourselves amen see friend it has to be
[1:16:33] more you have to approach God and and
[1:16:36] God told Isaiah that sacrifice now look
[1:16:40] God they were doing exactly what God
[1:16:43] told them to
[1:16:45] do they were doing exactly what God told
[1:16:48] him to do and in doing exactly what God
[1:16:52] told him to do
[1:16:54] mechanically it became a stink in God's
[1:16:58] nostrils you could look and
[1:17:00] say what have I done wrong Lord this is
[1:17:03] exactly what you told me to do but how
[1:17:06] we do it and why we do it is just as
[1:17:09] important as the mechanical actual doing
[1:17:12] it
[1:17:14] amen we say well I'm here in church Lord
[1:17:17] now hit
[1:17:19] me well that's not the right attitude
[1:17:22] you come to church because you're
[1:17:24] expecting to receive of the Lord but
[1:17:26] you're also expecting to give of
[1:17:28] yourself yeah you're also expecting that
[1:17:31] you're going to give everything you've
[1:17:32] got to this service to worship of the
[1:17:34] Lord that's what they were supposed to
[1:17:36] do when it became a stink in God's
[1:17:39] nostrils it was when it became a
[1:17:41] formality when it became a ritual and
[1:17:44] God told him you don't even care anymore
[1:17:47] but yet they were doing exactly what God
[1:17:50] told them to do you understand
[1:17:53] it's not simply the mechanic of doing
[1:17:55] something it's how why we do it the
[1:17:59] heart the approach the approach of
[1:18:02] worship
[1:18:04] amen when we lift our hands and worship
[1:18:07] to God that's it to us listen to me now
[1:18:10] to us it's our body but when we raise
[1:18:14] our hand to the Lord that's not a
[1:18:16] physical display of
[1:18:19] strength it's a Define yes of the light
[1:18:22] that's in US of
[1:18:23] gravity but our hand goes up because our
[1:18:26] heart says
[1:18:27] worship it's not a physical show of
[1:18:30] strength right it's a spiritual show of
[1:18:33] worship to the Lord that we worship God
[1:18:36] Amen praise the Lord you do it of your
[1:18:39] own free will yeah 2 Chronicles let's
[1:18:42] let's uh chapter
[1:18:47] 29 amen 30 verse
[1:18:51] 30 moreover Hezekiah the king and the
[1:18:54] princes commanded the Levites to sing
[1:18:56] praise now now this says they commanded
[1:18:59] them to sing now but understand this was
[1:19:02] the initial instruction that God was
[1:19:05] giving them on what was to be pleasing
[1:19:07] to the
[1:19:08] Lord the the command the
[1:19:11] instruction was thus this is how you do
[1:19:15] it and when they followed that once the
[1:19:19] instruction was given they did it that
[1:19:22] way every single time thereafter it's
[1:19:26] like almost anything you do it's like on
[1:19:28] my job when when my boss or someone on
[1:19:31] the team trains me to do something a
[1:19:33] certain way they don't have to train me
[1:19:36] again they don't have to tell me that
[1:19:38] I'm supposed to do this or how to do it
[1:19:40] I know how to do it I know what needs to
[1:19:41] be done so I go do it it's that
[1:19:45] simple but when the command comes so I
[1:19:47] see it says they commanded well what
[1:19:50] he's doing is they're he's instructing
[1:19:52] them amen this is the worship that
[1:19:55] follows amen so look
[1:19:58] now and when they had made an end of
[1:20:00] offering the king and all that were
[1:20:03] present with him bowed themselves and
[1:20:06] worship moreover King uh
[1:20:10] moreover uh Hezekiah the king the
[1:20:12] princes commanded the Levites to sing
[1:20:16] praise unto the Lord with the words of
[1:20:19] David and of uh ASF the
[1:20:24] and they sang Praises with gladness so
[1:20:28] although he told them instructed them
[1:20:32] this is what we do when they began to do
[1:20:35] it according to the command of the
[1:20:38] Lord when they did it they did it with
[1:20:43] gladness amen amen now how would we know
[1:20:47] to do something that pleased the Lord
[1:20:50] unless he told us yeah what was pleasing
[1:20:53] to him yes amen so when he tells us what
[1:20:57] is pleasing to him we say that's a
[1:21:00] command or that's instruction but he
[1:21:03] doesn't have to tell us that again God
[1:21:07] should not have to come down every
[1:21:09] service and saying raising your hands in
[1:21:11] worship is pleasing to me he should not
[1:21:14] have to do that yeah we know by the
[1:21:17] scripture that is pleasing to him it's a
[1:21:19] command instruction and he doesn't have
[1:21:22] to come every single time and say okay
[1:21:25] now raise your hand yeah
[1:21:27] right he shouldn't have to have a song
[1:21:31] leader stand up here and say okay
[1:21:33] everybody raise your hands now right
[1:21:36] right we should know to do that right
[1:21:39] and if it's in your heart to do it do it
[1:21:42] if it's not don't right that's the best
[1:21:46] I can tell you amen some people say well
[1:21:49] do it anyway it it it'll get you going
[1:21:52] maybe maybe it will but that's up to you
[1:21:55] but I'm I'm saying if it's in your heart
[1:21:57] to do then do it when God commands us
[1:22:00] when God instructs us of something he
[1:22:03] doesn't have to tell us over and over
[1:22:05] again we know to do that we know when we
[1:22:08] do that it's pleasing to the Lord right
[1:22:10] we know when we do that it's worship to
[1:22:12] the Lord as long as it's coming from our
[1:22:13] heart is worship to the Lord we know
[1:22:16] that so once the once the instruction
[1:22:20] the command has been instit Ed and it's
[1:22:24] been put into practice then it comes
[1:22:27] with gladness in the
[1:22:29] heart I I trust and believe this morning
[1:22:32] whether you're here at home that when we
[1:22:34] sang that song Lift Your Hands in praise
[1:22:38] to the Lord and we did that instruction
[1:22:41] from the song we did it with gladness
[1:22:45] yes amen we did it with gladness with
[1:22:48] worship from our heart not just because
[1:22:50] the song said so amen it isn't just that
[1:22:54] it isn't just that time it's because we
[1:22:58] do it from our heart and
[1:23:00] worship the command to the
[1:23:03] Levites they began to sing praises unto
[1:23:06] the Lord and the words of David esth the
[1:23:09] sear and they sang Praises with gladness
[1:23:13] praise the Lord not out of drudgery but
[1:23:17] with
[1:23:18] gladness and they bowed their heads and
[1:23:21] worshiped then Hezekiah answered and
[1:23:24] said now ye have consecrated yourselves
[1:23:27] unto the Lord come near and bring
[1:23:31] sacrifices and thank and thank offerings
[1:23:35] into the house of the Lord and the
[1:23:37] congregation brought in sacrifices and
[1:23:40] thank offerings and as many look at now
[1:23:44] look what it
[1:23:46] says and as many as were of a free
[1:23:51] heart amen a free heart burnt
[1:23:57] offerings now I know we have every we
[1:24:00] have a time and a place we have service
[1:24:03] excuse me we have service Sunday
[1:24:06] mornings
[1:24:07] 10:30 and we come to that it's a
[1:24:10] standard it's a standard that's been set
[1:24:13] that we have that we've decided on the
[1:24:15] Lord's provided us a place 10:30 on
[1:24:17] Sunday mornings but that doesn't change
[1:24:20] the fact that when we come here we do it
[1:24:22] with our Free
[1:24:23] Will
[1:24:26] amen it it would come to the place that
[1:24:30] it becomes such a formality and you see
[1:24:33] how it's happened in so many other ways
[1:24:36] people that they just quit doing it
[1:24:41] because they never wanted to do it to
[1:24:42] start with right if they never really
[1:24:45] wanted to do it and their heart's not
[1:24:48] there to do it it doesn't accomplish
[1:24:50] anything I shouldn't say it doesn't
[1:24:52] accomplish
[1:24:53] anything you can't come into the house
[1:24:55] of the Lord and not get something
[1:24:57] somehow uh you're going to walk out of
[1:25:00] here one way better or worse one way or
[1:25:02] the other something's going to happen to
[1:25:04] you if you come into the house of the L
[1:25:06] A real house of the Lord where the the
[1:25:08] words being preached something's going
[1:25:10] to happen to you amen one way or the
[1:25:13] other but a lot of people they would
[1:25:15] just quit they wouldn't do it at all but
[1:25:17] these people they would consider it as a
[1:25:19] command of something they had to do
[1:25:20] forced to do no this is of a free heart
[1:25:24] to bring of a free heart something that
[1:25:27] we that we desire in our hearts to do of
[1:25:31] our own free
[1:25:33] will let's go over to uh Hebrews now I
[1:25:37] got a couple more scriptures and I want
[1:25:39] to
[1:25:42] read before we dismiss Hebrews chapter
[1:25:49] 13 Hebrews 1315
[1:25:55] look at this now by him therefore by him
[1:25:58] by God by God therefore let us offer the
[1:26:02] sacrifice of praise to God
[1:26:05] continually amen the sacrifice to
[1:26:09] God uh the sacrifice of praise to God
[1:26:12] now we've gone over from Old Testament
[1:26:14] to New Testament the sacrifice is no
[1:26:17] more the the parties and the
[1:26:20] celebrations and the new moon and all
[1:26:22] and the the the killing of animals and
[1:26:25] stuff now our sacrifice because our
[1:26:27] sacrifice has been sacrificed Jesus
[1:26:29] Christ has already died and give his
[1:26:32] life and shed his blood for us once for
[1:26:35] all so now we have one thing to do
[1:26:38] that's Aller a sacrifice of praise of
[1:26:41] worship and Thanksgiving for what he's
[1:26:44] done for us for what the sacrifice did
[1:26:47] for us amen and that praise that
[1:26:50] sacrifice of praise is to be given to
[1:26:53] praise to God
[1:26:55] continually that is the fruit of our
[1:26:58] lips which a lot of people seem to want
[1:27:00] to substitute today giving thanks to his
[1:27:04] name now I'm not
[1:27:06] against any form of worship that
[1:27:09] somebody feels that they want to Worship
[1:27:10] the Lord if you want to clap clap I
[1:27:12] don't have a problem with that I mean
[1:27:14] I've mentioned it before I think in a
[1:27:17] lot of churches it's gotten to the place
[1:27:19] that people substitute that for actual
[1:27:21] worship to the lord it's just it's just
[1:27:24] an noise uh but if that's if that's your
[1:27:27] way you worship by all means I would
[1:27:30] never tell anybody if the Lord moves on
[1:27:32] you to do that to worship then worship
[1:27:35] but I want you to see what the scripture
[1:27:38] says about our praise our praise is to
[1:27:42] be given to God of the fruit of our
[1:27:45] lips the fruit of our lips giving thanks
[1:27:48] to his
[1:27:49] name and look it is a whole lot lot
[1:27:53] easier to sit out there in the
[1:27:56] congregation and I would say even up
[1:27:59] here to sit out there in a congregation
[1:28:02] and do this versus worshiping the Lord
[1:28:05] with your
[1:28:06] lips how many people do you hear that
[1:28:09] actually verbalize their praise to the
[1:28:14] Lord praise the
[1:28:16] Lord
[1:28:18] hallelujah thank you Jesus amen
[1:28:22] praise God with the fruit of our lips
[1:28:26] how much
[1:28:30] easier amen and I'm not again I'm not
[1:28:33] squelching that at all if that's your
[1:28:35] form of worship if that's what you want
[1:28:37] to do to worship you go right ahead the
[1:28:39] Lord moves on you to do that you do it
[1:28:41] with the best in your heart you a free
[1:28:43] will with every ounce of energy you got
[1:28:46] amen but I'm showing you what the
[1:28:48] scripture says in giving praise
[1:28:50] sacrifice of praise from the fruit of
[1:28:52] our lips don't let one thing be a
[1:28:57] substitute for the other that's all I'm
[1:28:59] saying amen don't let this be a
[1:29:02] substitute for praise the Lord right
[1:29:06] amen because that's what the scripture
[1:29:08] says and that's all I know what the word
[1:29:11] says giving thanks to his name with the
[1:29:15] fruit of our lips that's our sacrifice
[1:29:17] we bring the sacrifice of praise amen
[1:29:22] with our lips praise God We Will We Will
[1:29:25] Rejoice but do good 16th verse now still
[1:29:29] Hebrews 13 verse 16 but do good and to
[1:29:34] communicate forget not for with such
[1:29:38] sacrifices God is well pleased amen God
[1:29:41] is well pleased you want to be well
[1:29:43] pleasing to the Lord that's one way to
[1:29:46] do it is to follow that prescription
[1:29:48] praise God give praise to God
[1:29:50] continually with the fruit of our lips
[1:29:53] amen praise the Lord fruit is something
[1:29:57] that is a result of uh uh the the the
[1:30:02] result of something else that's taken
[1:30:04] place amen like a tree a fruit wouldn't
[1:30:08] exist without a
[1:30:10] tree or or a plant am mean I know
[1:30:13] there's other plants that have fruits
[1:30:15] but a fruit wouldn't exist without a
[1:30:17] tree a fruit is just the result the end
[1:30:20] result of the existence of the tree or
[1:30:25] the plant the plant the tree there the
[1:30:28] fruit is going to come
[1:30:30] forth that fruit just proves what is in
[1:30:34] the
[1:30:35] plant if it's an orange tree it's the
[1:30:37] fruit is going to be an
[1:30:39] orange so the praise that you give is
[1:30:42] just a result of something that's
[1:30:44] already there it just proves what is in
[1:30:47] existence in your life in your heart
[1:30:50] amen amen where that coming from to
[1:30:53] Worship the Lord the fruit is just the
[1:30:55] end result it's what we give in
[1:30:58] existence to say God we acknowledge and
[1:31:01] we know that you are God and that we
[1:31:04] love you and we thank you we praise you
[1:31:07] we give you glory and honor for all that

[1:54:00] around uh stuff that jobs we were
[1:54:02] supposed to have come open is being
[1:54:04] pushed back again uh we don't really
[1:54:06] have anything else to do so uh I don't
[1:54:09] know where we're going next week I got
[1:54:11] two weeks of work left in the year

[1:54:20] I be look forward to that but um but I
[1:54:23] as far as next week I don't know I don't
[1:54:25] know where we're going uh I thought
[1:54:27] about cancelling next week's Service uh
[1:54:30] just so people could start getting
[1:54:32] better and well um uh but after today's
[1:54:36] service I feel like I don't feel we
[1:54:39] should
[1:54:41] so so seemed like there were going to be
[1:54:44] quite a few people missing today and
[1:54:46] just thought you know sometimes you just
[1:54:49] got to take a break break and just let
[1:54:50] everybody get well and stay home and
[1:54:53] rest and whatever uh and get better so
[1:54:57] um but uh right now we'll just we'll
[1:55:00] still just have hers next week uh I did
[1:55:03] also want to mention that uh my plan and
[1:55:06] my desire my heart is uh December 17th
[1:55:10] Sunday December 17th I want to have
[1:55:12] communion foot washing uh and maybe if I
[1:55:16] haven't got a chance to talk to Craig
[1:55:18] yet uh get place next door we can have a
[1:55:21] dinner together
[1:55:22] afterwards U so that's my heart's desire
[1:55:25] that's my plan um a lot of times I do it
[1:55:28] the first of the year but the 17th just
[1:55:30] seem to fit perfect as far as doing that
[1:55:33] it's coming the new year uh through
[1:55:36] Thanksgiving coming into Christmas and
[1:55:39] so maybe Lord willing as far as I know
[1:55:42] now and my desire is December 17th we'll
