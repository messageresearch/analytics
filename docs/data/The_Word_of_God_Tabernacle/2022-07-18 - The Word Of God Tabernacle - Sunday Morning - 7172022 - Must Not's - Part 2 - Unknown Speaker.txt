and art's home is getting invaded by a bunch of ants there we go thank you they're getting invaded with a bunch of ants and they're having a hard time getting rid of them uh i know they're those probably those little bitty ants that come out in monsoon season they're subterranean and they get flooded out and they try to find higher ground uh that's probably what they are i remember we had them somewhere we lived not recently but um the exterminator just said there's really nothing they could do just keep things sprayed the exterminator even said just get the best bug sprayer and spray and keep areas sprayed and try to keep them away it's about the best you can do till monsoon season's over but uh they're harvesting a hard time battling that she also said that art had been working 18-hour shifts uh this week and i really needed prayer the lord would just touch him and help him and strengthen him i didn't even know it was legal to work an 18 hour a day shift but anyway that's what she has here so he's tired and uh needs some strengthening so let's just remember heart of prayer as well amen i uh joel brought me a couple of prayer requests here one from sister shelia um see if this is out that art and triad uh please join in prayer for my ortho specialist appointment this tuesday believing the answer and healing from our lord jesus amen also for our triumph home invasion of ants it's very bad uh many people in crisis that i know may they turn fully to only one our lord jesus thank you amen absolutely sister we're gonna believe that's gonna be perfect tuesday you have a time of the appointment tuesday it's 2 30 2 30 amen so we'll remember that so lord willing 2 30. amen before then of course too but i always like to try to know the time that somebody's there pray during that time so also a prayer request sister norma says please pray for sister dorothy she has coveted and sister carol said sister who wants to sleep a lot is extremely weak which are two very strong characteristics of covet a man's history is a precious sister and lover dearly and let's just remember her in prayer the lord would just touch her and heal her of this demonic devil of covet amen also we want to continue to remember cheyenne in prayer we also want to remember sister teresa and her family her daughter gracie as you all probably know gracie's husband passed away we had prayer requests for him last week uh here and he has passed away this week so please remember that family your prayer no um details of any kind of arrangements that i know of as you as of yet uh but again just continue to please remember uh gracie and and teresa i guess i believe teresa was her daughter if i'm not mistaken named after teresa maybe i'm mistaken but uh she they lived with sister teresa uh grace and her husband and so now uh he has passed away so again please remember the new prayers you would anyone else have a request yeah it's up there uh i wrote it down as a praise brother it was a thank you to the lord was there another one oh that's brother and sister pat i'm sorry brother danny go ahead and give us what you got the only one i have here is a it sounds like a praise report for getting your driver's license oh no remember when i checked you and i said that it was um ordeal really i have to get my license every year yeah i went there and he made me take a night test in the very bottom you have to get all the letters i never heard of that i got the one all the letters above that he said well i went the lord blessed me i went and got a high exam i found out i

rachel she's going through a hard time uh and from sister patricia please pray with me to cast out the demon called cranial nerve palsy and restore my good vision in the name of jesus amen absolutely certainly remember that in prayer they got all kinds of names for those devils today don't they i don't think i've ever heard the name of that devil yet cranial nerve palsy but it's the devil nevertheless with a fancy name on him amen so we remember those requests of prayer uh daughter rachel and of course for sister pat amen anyone else you have an unspoken request on your heart today lord knows all of our needs all of our desires let's stand to our feet if we could amen dennis if you would to take these knees to the lord for us lord jesus we power our hearts and our heads in reverence together holy spirit knowing that you're here and you're mindful of each and every one and lord i just read how your prophet brother branham told us to truly strive to be better christians yes to love one another above all love one another yes jesus to truly uh strive to live a life that's worthy of the time amen of jesus christ yes yes lord to make an effort with as hard and as as diligent as we can to put you first knowing that if christ is truly in our hearts we can't wait for those search doors to open up and how your prophet said that if you don't feel that way then it's time to get to praying because something is wrong the more so we see that day approaching how much more can you wake us up the scriptures are unfolding before our very eyes man's hearts are failing for fear lord there's so much is going on that people uh i have even heard people say how much more can i take and lord we as believers in your word we know it's just the beginning of sorrows the great tribulation is not here because we're still here that father wake us up this devil is fighting harder than ever but lord you are showing us you want to fight for us harder than ever there are many that are sick that prayer requests have been read and lord we know you're mindful you're of each and everyone you're a great physician a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your strengths we are healed go father as we believe by faith and touch each and every one that needs a healing touch as our pastor said these are devils of diseases but father

your word yes you're shall agree it's touching anything it shall come to pass let us have the victory let us defeated lives only thing that will hold us back if there's unconfessed sin in our hearts

seated if you'd like amen we're going to go over to song number 38 and i want to have the course on the screen here psalm number 38 higher ground amen i found out got a new revelation this week ended up you know working in one of those car wash tunnels and uh our crew is a great crew but some of the other people there didn't have their jobs done so they were in there and there's people they put up this wall board around and for hours on end unfortunately we made enough racket i didn't hear it all the time but there was the whole time was hip hop rap all that i thought no wonder people are going insane and killing each other i'm ready to kill somebody i gotta listen another one of these songs i'm gonna go crazy myself i still wonder it's just a bunch of repetitive chanting of nothing but demonic evil stuff it's incredible how people can listen to that there's no music there's no musician to it the people couldn't play an instrument if their life depended on it they can't sing a lick they just chant over and over just the most vile disgusting things you could imagine i thought mine give me a drill but make just somebody make some noise but i figured it out that's why they're going insane they're they're just going crazy it's a big reason why amen but the lord blesses he always does amen so i'm thankful for that i'm looking for higher ground how about you amen praise the lord higher ground let's sing it i'm pressing onward [Music] every day [Music] lord lift me up and let me stand my [Music] [Applause] [Music] my [Music] and fears [Music] lord lift me off [Music] [Music] i

that he has prepared for us some of our precious saints brothers and sisters loved ones i've already made that place amen and i'm looking forward to seeing them at any time yes amen the dead in christ shall rise first yes and those that are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the lord in the air hallelujah praise the lord micah's got a song for us here he wants to sing amen we got it up here if you want to sing along with him in christ alone amen i don't know if that's the song i'm supposed to sing or not because there's another song that came on my mind it's been in my mind this whole song service so i'm trying to fill out what the lord wants me to do amen anybody have a testimony on your heart amen i should say everybody's got a testimony in your heart but anybody want to give your testimony amen when god sees you through one it seems demon that comes enough but you know what it's just teaching me something amen just keep on fighting satan is bad yes he is but i'm glad amen [Music] amen yes it is sister praise the lord absolutely is thank you lord amen you got it yeah amen it's going to be different so we're going to take this off if you know it you

been for it's for us all like i said but i believe somebody really got a blessing out of that song amen you want to come over here let's pray together lord jesus father satan keeps attacking my precious grandson giving him his stomach issues lord but we rebuke that devil and we bind our faith together in the name of jesus christ that you would take this from him lord satan you take your hands off of this young man i will mature you in jesus christ's name you have no right to him and i tell you in the name of jesus christ you must go lord touch him now father we believe in your precious name he is healed by your stripes in calvary we claim it as we bind our faith together for it in jesus christ's name amen amen been happening on and off with him in the past couple of weeks even last sunday we left here we went to go get something and he didn't it wasn't anything he drank or ate it just he sat down and was getting ready to get the food and then he his stomach started hurting and it was hurting while i had to go to the airport he just keeps having that trouble and then it just goes away after a little bit of 20 30 minutes or something goes away but i'm so proud of him because every time it happens like that he says pray for me how many children how many eight-year-olds in the world today when they're not feeling good go to you and say pray for me been taught that amen praise the lord so believing in faith satan has no right to him amen praise the lord let's stand to our feet if we could god shall bless you today the lord willing we'll try to continue on with last week's message amen and go back to the second timothy chapter two second timothy chapter two we'll pick up with this probably won't be as lengthy as last week because like i said these must knots that we were talking about that brother branham referenced to for us in crisis revealed in his word these three must nots the first one really to me was the more uh they're all three very important but the first one is very very much uh uh prominent today and and what and what's going on in the world and the first one that we talked about last week um was the misinterpretation of god's work misinterpreting him so we talked about that last week we'll get to the other two here today as they kind of run together they all really three run together but these last two more so so second timothy chapter two we'll read a few verses of scripture here but let's bow our heads for word of prayer before we do that lord jesus we're thankful father again to be in the house of god we're thankful for the health strength and life you give us thank you for the blessings lord that you bestow upon us every day lord yes in our lives god of the blessings you give us and never leaving or forsaking us god and just a peace that we can have to know that in the middle of a tumultuous world god you've given us a type host you've given us a standard you've given us an anchor you've given us something that helps keep us from getting ourselves all out of shape and worried and discouraged and down and depressed because we know our redeemer liveth yes and we know that on that last day that we will stand with you together and we will stand victorious in the precious name and under the shed blood of jesus christ we thank you lord for your willingness to go to calvary for doing it for us for becoming us that we can become you that by that lord we could draw nearer to you we could come close to you we could be more like you in this world that we live thank you for this time this service this place for these people that have come those who may be streaming we thank you so much for all that you do for us every day now we pray once again that you take complete control over this service we rebuke every demonic spirit in the name of jesus christ that we try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory and praise for all that is said and done thank you for your word lord now speak to us from it anoint hearing speaker alike that that would accomplish whatever your desire lord is for this service to be accomplished and we committed to you we thank you for it in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen second timothy chapter 2 we'll begin reading with verse 11 11 through well we'll see what we go through verse 11 it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the lord that they strive not about words to no prophet but the subverting of the here put to the subverting of the hearer study to show thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth amen you can be seated if you'd like amen rightly dividing the word of truth which is what uh we want to think about as we go back into this three must nots that brother random gave us and christ revealed in his own word you remember those three must not uh i'll read it again here because there's some maybe here that went here last week but i'll read this again it is from christ revealed in his own word of those three must-nots that he talked about now he mentioned about so many times you must do this you must do this the scripture says you must be born again the scripture says but there are those that he talked about here now like i said there probably are other things that we should not do or must not of the scripture but these are the three that he pointed out specifically and i believe the point of that was that of these three any of those three will cause the word itself to lose its picture it will lose its effectiveness it will lose its uh uh ability as god would to reveal it to us it loses all that if it gets out of focus the word starts getting muddled up and jumbled and and then all of a sudden if you if you misplace this or you misinterpret that or dislocate this the picture starts to get wrong it starts to get like i said last week the cow and the tree picking grass and so these are the three important things as as you said in studying the scripture and that's what that's what paul told timothy in studying the scripture these three mustangs there's obviously a lot of must-nots that we should do but in the scripture and studying the scripture those are things that will cause the scripture to lose its effectiveness to get jumbled up as i said we'll start if we see part of the scripture a certain way that's not according that is misinterpreted or mislocated or something it'll make other parts of the scripture not fit or look right or work right that's why so many people think uh that the bible contradicts itself no no the bible does not contradict itself if there's any contradiction it's how you've misinterpreted or mislocated or dislocated or misplaced it or something that's the only reason it won't work in perfect continuity and dovetail one word to the other genesis to revelation is that one of those three things has happened a misinterpretation has come a misplacement somehow or dislocation some has caused the word and your interpretation of it to be skewed to where it doesn't look like this fits with this but it all fits together and it has to and it will if you put it all exactly the way it's supposed to be as god wrote it amen so again understanding the importance of this three must nots is very vital the first one we talked of last week was not misinterpreting the word uh and understanding how important it is and in today's world and how many things even sister mati sent me a text about all these and i hadn't even thought about it but all these new variations of the bible i don't know how many translations of the bible there are today but you want to talk about misinterpretation uh when i get i think i may have said this to you years ago but when i look at a new bible which you can tell i haven't gotten a new bible but uh if i look at a new bible i had somebody one time that i took from the airport who gave me a bible and it was some translation i can't remember what i kept it but i looked at it but when i see a translation of the bible the first place i go is genesis and when you go through the first three four chapters of genesis and it doesn't match up with what we know to be the truth by art by what brother branham stood on the king james version of what he ministered which most all or most if not all are wrong uh you get an understanding right there i that that bible's gone that's right i don't use it i don't read it i don't it it's not going to be as any profit to me because it has already misinterpreted what the true scripture is into something that came out of some theology or some seminary somewhere or some doctrine or dr divinity who believes there's three gods i mean then so to me if those first three chapters are wrong i've put it away so that's kind of how i look at it but i thought that was very good i didn't even think of that about how people misinterpreted those things they take from the scripture and try to divulge and put into their their own opinions into there remember how we talked about the developing of our opinions and trying to interject our opinions into the scripture can no be no opinion it has to be you have to die out to yourself and accept and believe the word and its purity and its holiness and and the way god wrote it in the in the in the spirit of the holy spirit is exactly the way that we read it and god will reveal it to you that way and when god reveals it to you that way then every bit of it runs together in continuity yes amen now there's also the perspective of let's just take the four gospels there's also the perspective in the scripture of the four gospels being a good example of different men seeing the same event and writing it a different way and people would say oh well this one contradicts this one no no it doesn't um if if i were to write about this service today i would write about what i see right here in front of me about the ones on the left the ones on the right and how many is over here and how many is over there and my perspective and who's wearing glasses and uh and all the different that that's what i would write about now if somebody was standing over in that corner and looking at it this way they would write it a different way amen because they're looking at it at a different angle it's the exact same thing it's the exact same scenario and i believe god had though that's why those uh those cherubims are there to guard those gospels see that god allowed these different men to write these things from different backgrounds and from different perspectives and from different point of views to see the exact same thing it might look like it's different but it's not if you bring and take the entire picture and put it together see jesus would say one thing or one specific thing would happen well matthew might have thought that was important but luke didn't right luke may not have wrote what matthew wrote because matthew saw from a different perspective and that's why god had those four to write it the way they did so that we would get the entire picture amen so you see it's not a contradiction it's not a misinterpretation it's men filled with the holy ghost moved by the holy ghost i should say that's what the scripture says move by the holy ghost to write it and they wrote it that way now it was guarded so that not just anybody's not going to see it it has to be revealed by god it has to be written in the red in the spirit that it was written and it was written by the holy ghost it's got to be read with by men women feel with the holy ghost yes or it will not work right it will not dovetail it will not uh uh show itself perfect the way it is now christ revealed his own word now in order to study the scripture just laid that foundation paul told timothy study it rightly dividing the word not interpreting it amen not interpreting but rightly dividing it right the word of god which is truth there is three musts in studying the scripture and using god's word there is three things you must not do now let's study next ten minutes he said these things you must not do all out in the land wherever you are you must not do these things we tell you all the time what you must do now i'm going to tell you what you must not do now it's not again it's not with your life it's in studying the scripture right that's what brother branham made specifically sure to help help us understand in studying the scripture there's three must nots okay i'm going to tell you what you must not and do now must not do now you must not misinterpret the word that's number one the first thing you say well i believe it means this it means exactly what it says it needs no interpreter and you must not misplace the word and you must not dislocate the word those are the three must not must not interpret must not misplace must not dislocate the word and if we do either of these it throws the entire bible into a confusion and chaos see because then it doesn't dovetail right because men's ideas are interjected into it now let's go to dislocate for a few minutes and let me let me at first i just feel to do this let me at first uh take an overall picture of this from what i see because like i said last week it can sound like that miss misplace and dislocate sound a lot the same misplace and dislocate but if you go to study and how brother brown said it and how the scripture uh presents itself you can see that the two are very close together but they are different and as i was sitting a couple of weeks ago at my desk and asking the lord to give me something uh help me let me let me see this i i i like to be able to see it uh before i say it before i bring it before i stand up here i want to be able to see it i'll i want it to be dumped down so much for me that even my little p brain can see it and and the lord kind of showed it to me like this it's like a puzzle now dislocate now just bear with me for a few moments as we're going to delve into each one a little bit but again i won't be as long as it was last week but dislocate to dislocate means you must have the correct puzzle okay you must have the correct puzzle you can't if you dislocate you've got the wrong puzzle for the wrong time okay so you have to first have the right puzzle just like a dislocate we call what we have today the message of the hour that's our phraseology that we use uh for what the for the what we follow what we believe uh william branham the prophet and that message it wasn't him but it was that message it was it was christ the word coming to a people it cannot be dislocated to where that prophet come for this day and come and tell millions of people to go build an ark that would be dislocating the scripture right because it wasn't time for us to go build an ark for a big flood that would be dislocating the scripture so you have to have the correct puzzle the correct puzzle for this day we affectionately call the message of the hour that we believe that's the message for our day that's the puzzle that we are supposed to have that we live by amen now that that puzzle also has to be per put in its exact position so to dislocate means you've got the wrong puzzle you've got uh moses uh crossing the red sea or you've got us building an art somewhere or uh uh how many others we're gonna go out after church here and take all of us take a bunch of lambs over and sacrifice them on an altar up on mount lemmon or something you can't dislocate the scripture the word has to fit for your day for your age you can't take now it's like i said last week now martin luther we we're not martin luther's age but we do preach martin luther's message we do preach justification we just understand it in a greater light right we wesley yeah we don't have wesley's age but we do preach wesley's message so you see those all come up together but we're not standing just to say uh justification is it or sanctification is it or or or the gifts of the spirit that's it pentecost that's that that's it you stop right there no the message of this hour is to take a bride into a rapture this word is to take her and make her like him so that he when he comes shall find faith that we go in that rapture with him that's the only way we could do it so you can't dislocate or it won't it's not going to work this is a rapture age luther's wasn't the rapture age right wesley's wasn't a rapture age amen restoration gifts that was fine brought the spirit back we all needed that i believe that spirit is still here we didn't leave we didn't leave pentecost behind we just brought it with us a lot of people want to say well we're not pentecost anymore i know we're not but we we take that and we bring it into this day there's nothing wrong with the gifts of the spirit you just don't see them manifested as much as you did because the spirit of god's moving off the gentile bride but we do have it we have it here prophecies tongues those things god manifests himself in those the word is what's taking precedent today so it can't be dislocated you got to have the correct puzzle for the day that we live we have to have the correct puzzle we can't take noah's puzzle amen now to misplace is to make sure that every piece of that puzzle goes exactly where it's supposed to go so if we have not dislocated the word and we've got the correct puzzle we've got the correct puzzle for our day we've got the message of the hour we've got the correct puzzle for our day now we got to make sure that every piece of that puzzle gets put where it belongs every piece has to go because that's what makes that picture for us so we can see it and when the lord showed me that i thought well that's just dumbed down enough just for someone like me to understand it you got to have the right puzzle and then every piece of that correct puzzle has to be in its correct place amen you can't dislocate and you can't misplace the word you can't preach a footage when you're in the i age right right amen we have feet of course but you can't preach a torso age in a mind age we have a torso absolutely but we've gone higher than that yes you can't just say well this is just all it is i just stop right here well then where's the intelligence if you stop with the torso if you stop with the shoulders neck where's the intelligence where's the speaking where's the scene where's the thinking you have to go and that body that god had built up from the time that that seed fell in the ground from pentecost and that seed fell on the ground and that body that god has been building the the bride of jesus christ the mystical body of jesus christ has feet toes legs torso a neck head eyes and brain every bit of it in the mind just like we've gone from riding on horseback to horse and buggy that we've gone to the little motor car or motor carriage uh we've gone up into uh vehicles into automobiles cars to where now we've gone from going five miles an hour to 155 miles an hour 205 miles an hour they race they have races out to nascar those cars if the right track they can those cars could go over 200 miles an hour round and round and round you imagine if they came back from the 1850s and saw those would you imagine if they came back from the uh i i remember my grandmother was born in 1899 and the advent of the car the advent of the airplane all these things the advent of all these things happened during her lifespan good could you imagine today if somebody came that was in the 1850s and saw something going across the sky they grabbed their shotgun what is that giant things come to kill us they would they would know what to think that big silver thing flying over their heads what is that they would have no idea see that wasn't their day this is our day we look up and okay just another one boy they're awful noisy you know it's a lot of pollution a lot of noise we're so common to them and we can hop on one and be on the other side of the country in four hours where it used to take them four months that's the progression but we we still got feet we still got legs we still got torso neck head speaking seeing intelligence that's intelligence this intelligence age the fullness of the word god revealing himself in the fullness of who he is that mystical body of jesus christ that he's been building from that time when that seed fell on the ground god's been building that body up to this point up to this time and the intelligence and the message of the hour to bring a bride back into perfect unity with the bridegroom again just like it was in the garden of eden save all the sin around us amen just like it was the garden of eden god and man coming embracing together once again that is this age you can't dislocate it amen you can't uh put it back in a different age it's today it is this day this is the day that we live now some people want to say oh well sanctification's great and it is but we got to have more than sanctification if we're going to try to go in a rapture yes you must be born again yes there's got to be the justification sanctification peter said on the day of pentecost repent be baptized in jesus christ in jesus name and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the promise to you unto them and that gift gives way for the for the life of christ to come and take permanent residence of your soul amen that's a different age it's a different time you can't dislocate it it's got to be exactly at that time it's got to be like the puzzle that was made and every piece of that puzzle has to be exactly where it's supposed to be amen every piece of it again you can't you can take your picture but you can't put the cow in the tree and the birds got to be in the tree cows got to be on the ground right the picture's got a no no portion and i say that because there's so much uh misplacement of the word that's gonna say misinterpret but misplacement of the word there's so much of the misplacement of the word that that people say well brother branham said that's of course a lot of the most famous things that people in the message like to say well brother branham said well it's like we found out last week satan came to jesus and said it is written what was he doing he was misplacing the word you say misinterpreting the word misplacing the word he was misplacing the word he was putting it out of its context he was putting it out of what what the scripture was written to bring us enlightenment on it he was misplacing it that's why jesus said it is also written now people like to say that the word correct the word the word correct the error because you can't correct the word because there's nothing wrong with the word am i so the word didn't correct the word the word corrected the misplacement of that word when satan displaced it jesus came and said it is also written to put all the scripture back where it belongs to take that cow out of the tree and put it on the ground to take that bird and put him where he belongs in the heavens jesus did that and he gave it to us for an example to make sure we didn't do that and people do that today oh brother mam said what did he say it based on your interpretation did he say it based on what you think he meant did you base it based on your doctrine did you base it based on uh something that you believed back over here that you saw and got some grandeur of a revelation or something and then you come and say but you know it says this over here and the word says that's why we have to take everything back to the word yes amen how many times should we say brother branham said and then another one come and say but brother graham said over here no let's take it back to the word if brother branham said it it's in here yes it is because he did not leave the pages of this bible so if he said it it's in here so if you believe a specific interpretation or taking that puzzle piece and putting it in a corner when it belongs in the middle then let's take it back to the word let's find out where it does belong let's see it in here if you can't find it in here and it's not dovetailing one scripture to the other which it will dovetail one scripture to the other it will dovetail one uh quote to the other if it doesn't do that there's nothing wrong with that scripture you gotta go and find out where you got off he gave us a straight narrow path few there will be that find it we are supposed to stay on that straight narrow path but as soon as you get a little piece missing you're in the wrong place you get off just a tick and it doesn't take much amen just like in the garden of eden friend just one word that satan misinterpreted to eve that one work took it off just a tick but that little tick just that little off is what threw the whole world into the chaotic state that it's in today all it has to be is just that little bit and if you continue to follow that that thought process you continue to thought follow along with that and you find something else you think matches up with it or another scripture that matches up with it although it's not matching with the other scripture that's why so many people they get a lot of grace all confused and so well that's just in the old testament well then why don't you just take genesis to malachi rip it out of your bible and just go burn it if it means that little to you just throw it throw in the garbage david psalms proverbs solomon it's all old scriptures old testament too well then throw in the garbage if you don't believe the old testament throw it away but you're like chopping jesus in half because you get rid of the word and people and they misinterpret that to people and they prey upon people's desires and lusts because the truth is you can go to any church that'll tell you anything that you want to hear yeah there's churches out there i guarantee you'll find one that you that you like that that'll be saying the things that you want to hear somewhere some denomination if it's just a 15-minute sermon you'll find someplace out there that says that it'll say exactly what you want to hear right and then you can fit right in it's like uh when i was purchasing back in charlotte years this is 1989 90. there was a sales consultant called us older gentleman he's a christian professing christian he was a nice man and he was trying to tell the purchasing manager at the time my boss about going to church he's always witnessing and you know everybody has their excuses if they're not going and and not that you miss a service or two but i'm talking about just people that just don't go they'd rather cut the grass on sunday but um or whatever what do we do what are they uh rage or gravel on sunday or your dirt whatever it is here in tucson they'd rather do that on a sunday they just don't go and he's telling him he said you need to find you a church and go there i mean like making church the only way you can be saved uh i believe if you're saved though you will go to church but uh throwing the church didn't save you either you need to find one he said they're like gloves churches are like gloves you just need to keep going until you find that glove that fits right into your hand i thought what a subtle lie the devil that is this christian man this good christian man is trying to teach this man they just go find your glove that fits now you better go find you a man of god that preaches a pure unadulterated word or you're going to hell that's the way it is you repent or perish yes that's the way the scripture is not all just find a glove it's as long as that gloves fit it's it's okay and that's and it is but it is true if you look long enough it goes back to what i said a couple weeks weeks ago people are just going to do what they want to do most of the times they just try to find an excuse to do it they just try to follow well so-and-so said son said so i don't have to do that because some somebody says see they showed it in the scripture they read this scripture yeah but how is that scripture applied is it misplaced is it misinterpreted is it dislocated you got to find out how that scripture lines up with everything if the excuse is just oh it's old testament then just rip the whole thing out oh now they don't want to do that it's just certain things well then who gave you the authority who puts you as the arbiter of truth in charge of what part of the old testament we're supposed to believe and live and which part we're not who puts you in charge to tell me that that scripture is inspired in that scripture isn't friend every bit of him from genesis 1 to revelation 22 is inspired and we are to obey it all amen amen just a lack of revelation a lack of revelation amen law versus grace oh it gets so scrupled up but the bottom line is they find teachers we read that scripture last week teachers having itching ears they'll say whatever you want them to say as long as you keep coming and giving them your money and doing all to make their church a big church and a good name and on tv or whatever it is you just keep coming it's okay greens grass sky is blue and everything's beautiful just say beautiful pure holy good you know and and it really doesn't matter other uh otherwise yeah they're just patronizing people instead of preaching the gospel the gospel is to be preached is to be lived it's not to be pandered to it's not to try to make some excuse or find some reason to do something or not do something that that god says for you to or not to do just to try to fit your ends just to try to pacify something is the desire you had in your heart to begin with i didn't want to do this to begin with i finally found somebody that showed me the scripture that i don't have to my mind where does that leave where does that put it is it misinterpreted dislocated misplaced friend if it doesn't fall through this word genesis to revelation it's like i said last week this is the filter but that holy ghost the filter this word must go through every part of it and if it doesn't if there's a hang up somewhere you say oh i'm supposed to do this or i shouldn't do that or something that you find in the scripture oh but that that that's old testament yeah so we'll just throw that out oh but jesus didn't really mean it that way you know well i'll be baptized this way jesus you know peter peter was just peter but jesus said this see whatever excuse they can find see it says right there there's there's three gods whatever excuse people can find to mislocate displace misplace this cloak dislocate the word anything to to try to fit what they want to do the desires of the heart the bottom line of all that is they don't have the holy ghost they're not born again and they're just trying to find an excuse somehow somewhere try to back it up with some quote somewhere or scripture to try to justify their ends when the truth is they're not born again they didn't want to do it to start with right but it's obed disobedience to the word that disobedience will lead you down a path you don't want to go for him you're getting off that little bit of a tick and if you get that little bit off it's like i said last week people say well i i i listened to this preacher i said well you know that preacher believes this right this this minister is a trinitarian ministry believes there's three gods three separate gods three separate people oh yeah but he never preaches that but every single thing he sees and it gets filtered through gets filtered through with the understanding of three gods right it's tainted from the beginning yes you understand it's tainted from the start it doesn't matter if he doesn't preach that exact scripture everything he sees in the word has to be filtered through that demonic lie yes they've misplaced it dislocated and somehow they've gotten off but they do it because most of first they're not born again second they want that that was a desire in their heart to begin with oh you you can try to manipulate the word and sisters cut your hair all day or not wear dresses or dress holy or whatever it is and just live like the rest of the world ministers out in the world preaching oh it's okay to get yourself all scarred up with a bunch of colors and numbers and tattoos and stuff there's ministers people that call themselves ministers behind pulpits and say that's okay and people go there and say well my preacher says it's okay where did he get it from did he misplace it somewhere in here oh well we shouldn't scar our bodies that's old testament there you go again old testament i can show you in the new testament too if you want to see it not that the old testament is gone done away with but there's a truth to it yes and all it does is give people a leg way to do what was in their heart to begin with amen and it's in their heart because they don't have god that's unfortunately that becomes the bottom line it was in their heart to do this to live this way or whatever to get that tattoo let's just be very specific it was in their heart to do it all along they just found an excuse he finally found a reason somebody said or somebody quoted or somebody came up with a scripture and made it okay it's misplaced mislocated something's wrong somewhere amen it's got to be according to the scripture genesis to revelation now let's go to another scripture i know that may sound hard friend but it's just the truth it's like i said a week or two ago people ultimately people are going to do whatever they want to do amen they're they're going to live however they want to live if they're not born again yes if they're born again they're not going to do what they want to do they're going to do what he wants them to do yes they're not going to live the way they want to live they're going to live the way he wants them to live amen matthew chapter 17 let's see how jesus straightens out the word for the disciples who had it all scrupled up matthew chapter 17 verse 10. and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come see they got it all scrupled up that's why they asked the question and that's good they needed to ask the question they needed to get straightened out scripturally jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things that is spoken in a future tense yes so there is an elijah that is to come that will restore all things now we know that couldn't be even the scofield notes you read scofield's all scrupled up with his notes but there there was to be a restoration gift a restoration ministry to bring a people to that position before the great and dreadful day of the lord dreadful to the world great to the bride so that day jesus is putting in place now they know the scripture and they're quoting the scripture to jesus why does the bible why does it say this jesus said elias truly shall first come and restore all things that's future tense so there will be a ministry that will restore back now what's it going to restore it's going to restore exactly what malachi said it would restore behold i send to you elijah the prophet but come before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children which was then and the heart of the children to the fathers which is now lest i come and smite the earth with a curse now that word that word had to begin dual meaning the first part by that spirit of elijah the first part being fulfilled by john the baptist turning the hearts of the fathers to the children and then by the message we know the message of the hour to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers the faith amen the faith of the fathers now jesus is trying to lay this to them because they're looking at it and they don't understand it most people don't understand it today yes and a lot of times ministers look at it and almost say something uh don't please don't take me wrong but there's ministers this message got that scrupled up not just out in the world but we'll talk about worldly veins now they get this scrupled up they don't understand it and you know most of the time when they don't understand something like this they avoid it they don't even preach on it they won't even get to it and read it or if they do they'll just place everything on john the baptist as jesus said this next now look but i say unto you that elias has come already now that's past tense and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them the disciples understood he spake them of john the baptist on the second part but not the first part john the baptist didn't restore anything jesus said that this elijah ministry that was in the future was to bring a restoration john didn't restore anything so what's jesus doing by the gospels in matthew's gospel here those chairmans with flaming sword keeping this word at a guard keeping it protected from just anybody well it says just right there you know most people wanted to well it's just got to be plain and simple right there no no no god writes the scripture to where the common person without a new birth and a revelation of this cannot receive it they can't see it there has to be that that new birth that revelation of the word that god would reveal it in the context he said it wrote it that's why he puts it like this but people want to say hey they even come to jesus if you are who you just tell us plain just tell us outright and then jesus would tell him i am the son of god blasphemy you asked me to tell you right i just told you and it made you mad so the point was they didn't want to hear it they they weren't concerned with what the truth was they just had the misplacement of that just like they did isaiah said a virgin shall conceive a virgin conceived but was the pharisees and sadducees they hung onto their dogmas they hung on to their doctrines friend the only way you ever see it is to die to yourself to die to any earth training of a catholic church or gone to some seminary or or or been raised in some denomination and you know you got to guide all that yes all that has to go away yes to enter into the purity and holiness of this word to be born again let god reveal that to you jesus is he he's explaining it and breaking it out to them and saying yes there the scripture does say that can i paraphrase the scripture does say that and it says it that there will be an elijah that is to come that's going to restore all things now these they didn't understand the restoration at that point because nothing had been fallen what is there to restore at this point of the scripture what is there to restore well they after this they reach the pinnacle of the new birth in the upper room and the and the gifts of the spirit and then it fell down and the seed went into the ground and came up and through luther and wesley and it came back back to the point of restoration again bringing it back to a place that it had fallen from yes that's the only way you can restore something something was here it became an a a condition it shouldn't be in to restore it is to bring it back to where it was yes by the past restoring cars i see cars going down the road i think what a hunk of junk it's rusted out there's hardly a body on it and tops flying and flapping all over the place and there's no hood and everything's all that said what a hunk of junk but somebody else who knows what they're doing and what they're looking at will look at that car and say my that's a masterpiece i want that so what's he going to do with it he's going to take that car he's going to spend thousands of dollars dragging it across the country and he's going to restore it to what it was when he came off the factory line it was here this was the perfection of that automobile and then through wear and tear and miles and everything it became a punk of junk and most people look at it think it's a hunk of junk but then when that man with that eye the man that can look at it and put it in his proper place amen you got to know it to be able to put it in his proper place you've got to know it and when you know it and you know the value of it and you know what the value of it is to your heart you put it in its proper place then the restoration comes and puts it back what it was like as close as possible from the showroom floor amen thank god that this comes not close as possible comes exactly like that and takes us home praise the lord amen john the baptist didn't do that john about knew nothing about restoration that's why jesus said there is one that's coming but there has also been one and they killed him chopped his head off they did whatever they wanted to they hated him he had no education he had no affiliation he had no denomination a fellowship card he had none other uh their mainstream beliefs he just came out of the woods with honey dripping off his beard and told them that you must be baptized and repent in jesus that wasn't in jesus name at that time but be repent but repent of your sins and be baptized he had a message they didn't listen to him they thought it was crazy they went to spy on him and he looked at him and said you snakes in the grass you want to come here and show me that you're serious about what's going on here he said you show me some fruits of your repentance and then we'll talk amen give me some fruits of your repentance you say i want to repent no there's got to be fruits to follow that repentance or you're just a liar amen i'm sorry it's awful hard today but that's the truth amen there's one place that liars go yes we all know what the scripture says where liars end up that's in hell and he told him you have a bunch of snakes in the grass the axes laid to the root of the tree you serpents you show me some fruits we'll go from there they weren't there for for sincerity they were there for show they didn't care about what john was doing they didn't care about being baptized or anything else because they had it it wasn't in their heart it wasn't a desire amen there's got to be that desire jesus breaks it out for him it's going to be a lodge coming but there's elijah been here already and you did whatever to him you treated him in whatever manner even john the baptist came to the point that his eyes his eagle eyes got dimmed over and he sent some of his disciples that still followed him even though he told his disciples he had told his followers there's the lamb of god follow him amen even though he's even though the prophet said there he is follow him there were still men that stayed and followed john the baptist sound familiar yes even though the prophet of god came in this day and said there he is follow him they still follow brother branham amen and and i don't mean in the context that we we follow his message and believe his word i mean just believing that he's god baptizing in his name and all that they do they still had disciples and that evil eye being dimmed over he sent some of his men over and said go ask and see is he the one or is there one still coming and he said you go back and tell john the things that you've seen and heard and been testified to you go tell him what has all happened happening he'll know who i am praise the lord even though he baptized him and met him at the river and baptized him and saw the spirit come down on him his eagle eye even got timed over go ask and see he said you just tell him this he'll know amen and he knew now he said well i gotta decrease so that he'll increase didn't our prophet do the same thing yeah did he say the same thing i've got to decrease now so that this increases praise the lord increases in your life why why did he have to go away because people were getting the word dislocated yes they were looking at birth to brother branham as it i think i told you one time that the church i used to go to kind of uh broke i've you know i've been in the message most of all my life but when i came back to lord i got baptized filled with the holy ghost started ministering and there was there was a sister that was in the church bless her heart just absolute precious sister um but oh if if brother branham would just hear he would pray for me okay is it god still here you're not right is it god the one that heals you brother brown didn't heal you if you if if if you need to have a physical corporal body a brother brandon standing here to be able to raise your faith to the level to receive that healing then you've got worse problems yes and that's true and again that may be an awful hard saying but it's the truth because our faith is in christ yes our faith is in god we know god's the healer so god had to take brother abraham said i got a decrease god had to take that because every every every from what i've been told i wasn't here i was alive 10 days before brother brown passed away but my brother green had different ones i've i've met dozens of men that spent time with brother branham including brother pat that told me that everybody was looking to brother brown they were looking to him that's not what his message was about and that's not what the intent was to be but it's inevitable that as us as humans would do that it happened all through the scripture so he had to decrease so that we get our eyes off of a man and onto god the god that that man was pointing us to yes the message that that man was bringing us to and pointing us to so that that word christ the word will come and cap this bride praise the lord capper but people would get dislocated misplaced this scripture here or there and get it all jumbled up just like they did here and jesus had to correct them oh yes there's elijah coming but this elijah's already been and didn't even talk about the elijah the original elijah elisha and the old testament oh but you people got rid of the old testament so i guess you don't talk about elijah elijah anymore even though it comes in the new testament silson but unfortunately that's the way a lot of people treat him but jesus had to set it straight amen kind of said it's true let's go over to one more scripture i'm going to close jesus putting each elijah where they belong hebrews we're going to hebrews amen chapter 13 verse 8. you all probably could quote it just as much as i could quote it one of the themes brother brahma's ministry hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen he told him back in the old testament i am the lord thy god i change not he's the same he's the same right now as he was then as he has always been people misplaced the scripture you probably all know one of the things back at brother branham's day to try to to try to make brother branham look like he was possessed of some demon when all these people healings and manifestations and and prophecies and things that came forth to try to discredit it to say oh that would that was only for the apostles that ended that ceased when the last apostle died so you showed me that in the bible that might be what your seminary teaches but i want to know what this word says did it cease when the last apostle died but that's misplacing the word that's taking the wrong piece the puzzle piece and putting it out of place no it didn't die when the last apostle died he's the same today as he was then he does the same thing we know i've said this brother around he said it dozens of times if god did it one way for one person he's got to do it the same way for the second person or he's not god if the same condition arose in the old testament new testament back in life wherever it was if that arose at one point and god acted a certain way towards it the same circumstances come again god's got to do the exact same thing or he's not god that's why the whole scripture runs in perfect continuity together from the very beginning when god took lambs and sacrificed them and gave them to adam and eve to the very end where he said that the the bride the the lamb's wife has made herself ready amen amen the lamb all the way through it's all jesus christ every letter every jot and tittle as brother branham would say that's every mark every punctuation is is christ all the way through if you don't see it as jesus christ in every word of this message and this word if you don't see jesus christ go read it again pray god asks uh ask god god show me i'm missing something here something is not clicking right lord show it to me help me see it god i'll show it to you it might not be right that minute but he'll show it to you he'll help you see it it's like i told mentioned last week program said god will let you let you know it when you have need of knowing it right and there's times and places you look at and say well god gave god gave isaiah the prophecy a virgin shall conceive well it didn't happen right then it didn't happen at that church it didn't happen in his lifetime it didn't happen in the old testament it wasn't until mary came along almost 800 years later but the scripture was finally fulfilled so there is always not just a a thing but but a place there's a time for everything too so it might not be time but ask him anyway yes and it's like i said when you're going along in life you're living for god you're reading the bible you're praying or something and something just drops in there and he's there there it is and you've got it and you know because god fits it all together just perfectly you don't have to manufacture something it's like telling a lie you know why people have a hard time maintaining a good lie because they change the details all the time because they can't remember the lie they told two weeks ago right but when you have the truth and it's embedded in your memory and you you experienced it it's something uh if you don't embellish uh it's something that stays with you and you can tell it the same way over and over and over yes because it's that prevalent i heard brother green tell stories all the time all the time brother green told the stories all the time but i will say outside of you know a margin for human error a small margin it was exact this story was the exact same from the first time i ever heard him tell it till the time right before he passed away the same the story the details was the same every time i heard him tell it same time same thing every time amen that's the way it is when you tell the truth if you tell a lie it's hard to remember right what detail did i tell what who did i say this to and who did i tell that to because it becomes it comes a muddled mess this is saying that it's the same way people treat the word but if it's something that is embedded in you becomes a part of you then you don't have to worry about muddling about with doubt or confusion or any of that it's the purity of the word and god reveals it to you amen must not misinterpret we must not mislocate we must not displace the word yes amen those are three musts and studying the scripture amen don't just read a quote i i got a revelation make sure that word fits with the make sure that quote fits within the scripture the way that you see it it fits in the scripture i promise you that but the way you see it amen make sure that it fits the way you and it'll go all perfect make that perfect picture and it'll be jesus christ amen the perfect picture of jesus christ amen let's stand if we could well i said it was going to be shorter last week but i don't think it really was god knows amen yes praise the lord god knows praise the lord listening is little course amen to him to be like jesus and to be like jesus purity of god's word it's got to be handled with respect reverence it's got to be handled with the hands of god red in the context in which it was written by the holy spirit the holy spirit's not prevalent in you you are born again and that's the number one thing born again you must be born again praise the lord that's the only way we can be like jesus to be born again be like the word people see you they'll know there's something different i noticed when i went on this job people looked at me differently it's inevitable i expected it when they're around me they talked different because i could overhear them when they're over there talking to each other you know and some explicits and things not no not like some i've heard but but when they get around me then everything changes and you know there's something there there's a reason for that there's a spirit there's an atmosphere they know it they might not understand it they know it they know it let's be like jesus amen to be like jesus [Music] to be like jesus on earth thy lord [Music] all through life's journey from earth [Music] just

2 30. i remember that as well so remember sister teresa's sister gracie's well was a husband but he's passed but remember gracie and the family in prayer as i mentioned for our prayer requests um any details of anything yet no okay so but let's just please continue to remember i like your explanation the lord led you to use the puzzle the lord uses the puzzles with me all the time yeah he'll give me a piece and say okay now let's see you put it in there and see what puzzle i got for you the picture so i keep getting pieces yeah and uh i was playing uh bible trivia i play every day exactly nice question do you want to get you going i don't know you all get something out of that where you get what you wanna the bible the lord takes me through the bible with pieces of journal but um there was a about esau and uh so i just wonder why you know that why do the why do the arabs hate the jews so much today you know well it's esau's fault but uh esau became edom and edom was the and uh david and his officers and the kings and things that are they they annihilated the and so there are no more that's why the arabs are afraid of the israelites they know that israelites god can eliminate them right and he will someday or he said he would you know it's everyone that's not a believer yeah is going to be gone into the fear of forgetting amen yes it was just interesting so i looked online to see you know how many other people were studying the same thing oh there's been so many books written on there all down through yeah there's lots of all all similar stuff it's just there's a lot of information uh about exhaust and destruction yeah yeah it's it's amazing it just you know when you drop a little trigger question study it all week on or something just like like god does this [Music] praise the lord joel asked me that question the other day about why when israel came over and these people just scattered and i said well they had already heard that how israel annihilated these other people and they didn't want to be like them right so many times come up and you cannot deny there's something supernatural about those people you can't deny it and you can't fight against it i told him i said so they ran for self-preservation because they had heard and they knew that god was with them amen so praise the lord that's the truth amen to god bless you amen amen praise the lord brother tom would you dismiss us and pray brother father god yes truly you are our father and our god jesus yes and the only way a person can be like jesus is to have the spirit of jesus yes amen and lord i pray that nobody would leave here today without that spirit and lord it's there for anyone that wants it just simply open our hearts lord we ask you to forgive us for all our faults and yes we know that you'd never turn away a repent of heart that you dwell on humility and lord god we just pray that you'll walk with us through this week it's been good to be here we know that we'll leave you're a better person than we came in yes and it's our hearts desire to be like christ lord christians in this dreadful world where today we're in a world of so much perverting of scripture and what like it's been said where can we go to find the truth people running here and there up and down all across the world but that's the truth lord searching the internet looking on youtube and all they find is the perverting of the word help us lord we know why truth is in the spirit of god that will lead us into all truth yes we thank you again for letting us be here lord it's a privilege to to love you and to know that you love us and we pray that you give us that faith for us to believe that you do love us lord that you'll accept our repentant hearts and know that
