basis as I said too praise the Lord the Lord will cover us amen praise the Lord if you've been there you know what I'm talking about praise the lord we have a couple prayer requests Amen to uh bring your attention today you see there's quite a few people out sister Karen is trying to get over a little sickness not feeling well she did text me think about it she did text me before service and said that she is coughing and uh needed touch from the Lord so please remember Sister Karen in prayer also sister matisses we witnessed last Sunday she still being burdened with that cough and uh it's giving her a fit she's trying to let her lungs rest and she just decided to stay home today please remember her in prayer if you would also sister Julie Higgins she went on a business trip this weekend so please remember her in prayer she went to California so uh just trust in the Lord grant her traveling mercies and come back be back with us and Lord bless her uh for safe journey Amen to be back with us Lord really next week also brother Pat text me uh and he suffered greatly last night he said uh with leg cramps I guess he did some digging yesterday some shoveling and his legs were cramping up really bad on him was up all night last night with that I kind of can know at it and a little lesser probably a little lesser um severity maybe but there's been times on the job that I've woke up in the middle of the night my legs cramping and I try to stretch it and when you try to stretch this one this one cramps you try to stretch that muscle that one cramps and I just end up on the floor just praying it might help me because everything's cramping it hurts so bad and uh that seems like kind of what brother Pat experienced last night he said sister sister Pat got to feeling so bad for him she got up two or three times just to be with him so please remember yummy ask specifically that they just not come back because they're just so painful and of course he said he tries he walks back and forth he tries to sit down but when he sits down he falls asleep and then starts all over and uh fortunately some of you found me some Sav up some kind I don't know what it is in a little jar and when when that happens to me it happened a couple weeks ago again because I was up and down on the ladder two or three hundred times and you know you do that it just or crawling around we put up these ladder racks and there's like this much room to walk and you're walking back and forth bent over and hunts in your legs and um I I just when I get down there I I pull myself over to my suitcase and get that Palm out rub it on my legs and it takes a few minutes but it goes away and I go to bed and can sleep the rest of the night I don't know what that is it works good so so just pray the Lord the touch brother Pat and take those cramps away they are very painful so I understand so please remember him in prayer if you would also sister Norma has a request here please pray for my husband uh he has not been well in his uh his eyes are giving him problems amen so let's remember Romney in prayer if the Lord would just touch him also also request here from um it looks like sister Lydia's writing is this you okay please pray for my sister Esther she is having severe flu symptoms and her poor immune system is not helping her fight and to fight the infection amen so please remember it's just Lydia's sister Esther in prayer as well amen I didn't know if you wanted me to mention the funeral service times and dates okay um let me get to that a little bit uh brother Dennis has a request here from Mr Katie it says please keep my uh uh my wife Leah in prayer uh going to a very strong a very strong time of dealing with her depression uh dealing with a fam family member she was very close to also her daughter Jill of well uh get the victory over or over her depression and her bipolar condition amen so I hope I read that correctly president amen so let's remember all uh brother Dennis's wife Leah and his daughter-in-law sister Leah's daughter Jill in prayer the Lord just touched uh the both of them as well amen God is mindful is he not yes yes he is praise the Lord he didn't have a another request on your parking each that you want to bring coming home he's in Mexico again just remember uh sister Norma song prayer too because Richard's the one that just wanted Richard so let's remember him in prayer too coming back home uh from Mexico for traveling emergency so let's remember him have an unspoken request Lord knows all our hearts today let's stand to our feet if we could ask where the dentist Lord Jesus we bow our hearts and heads and Unison of the faith The Knowing Lord that we're talking to uh loving and caring God yes you're mindful of our needs Lord and amen not only do we express these requests we believe that your word will not fail us he says when two shall agree it's Touch of one thing it shall come to pass amen and we believe father we know how the enemy is fighting us harder than ever before Lord but greater he that's in us than he that's in the world yes God be with us who can be against us praise the Lord oh Lord help us to stand on your word to stand by faith that your promises will come to pass in our lives yes I heard the prophet say that hope was the greatest enemy of faith hope hope for it but faith gets it amen gets the job done yes and give us that Faith Lord no matter what we go through father we're Lord enabled in the name of Jesus Christ to be conquerors in anything that we endure and Lord Jesus we know that there's a lot of people that are hearing your word and they are just lackadaisical and just complacent thinking that we have a lot of time uh still before you come I can recall what Peter says Lord that he was mentioning where is the promise for everything seems to remain the same as our fathers the fell asleep since the creation of time yes and Lord don't let us fall into God Amen help us to recognize you could come today that's the problem said Never Lose Your Enthusiasm for the coming of the Lord and help us Lord to walk in the spirit to be led of the spirit yes of your word father amen there's so much I even hear Believers they're compromising um the prophet said that each messenger her came at the end of the age and how much more serious speak to our hearts yes that not only did you send a seventh angel messenger but you sent a Vindicated Prophet that brought a word to get a bride ready for a Rapture to help us to open our eyes to be living your life at all times not after we leave church we're going to go back to our worldliness back to our laziness when it comes to hearing your word is and reason your word and hearing the tapes the message of the hour and father Lord Jesus help us Lord to be more sincere as a as the prophet said that anyone that comes before you with sincerity and Desperation you'll feel them with your holy amen the Lord this morning there's several that are sick coughs and colds and and just leg cramps that they're just not feeling good but father we have a great physician that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your stripes we are healed we claim our healing we claim that bomb of guilt we claim that the person that we have need of not for ourselves only by especially for our brothers and sisters of the faith our loved ones father and Lord there are several that are dealing with mental illness mental uh anguish it was depression bipolar whatever it may be my wife deals with it but father you can deliver her once and for all and everyone that's going through it touching father deliver them yes Jesus just take that lying ugly Spirit out of their lives and bring peace that they can serve you and with all that's within them uh bless our pastor you see labors Faithfully to bring forth your word open our hearts Lord to receive it we know that the word can be preached time and time again unless you reveal it to us it's it's like pouring water on a duck's back it'll roll right off reveal yourself make yourself move yes real you are welcome here father you may you truly touch us all whatever we have need of bring us closer to you may your word become a living epistle in our lives read and known of all men yes Lord in your name we pray praise the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord you can be seated if you'd like amen one more song we're seeing here number 348. I don't have it up on the screen here the lighthouse amen always been one of my favorites you know I kind of like it when uh thank you sister Norma or someone who sings a special on it but I haven't heard it for a while so I thought I would say or we can sing it outstanding amen praise the Lord got to get a little specials out of us here [Music] there's a lighthouse on the hillside [Music] alive did I might see and the light that shines in darkness now will save me lead a soul [Music] my ship would sail no more and I thank God more than my house I own all my life today for King Jesus is and from he has shown the light around me and I could hear me knows tell me where would this be everybody that lives around us [Music] this way anymore there's no use of his standing round but then my mind goes back to that stormy night with just in time I saw that lies yes alive through that Old Lighthouse that stands upon the hill and I thank God for that my house I hold my life to him for King Jesus is the lighthouse [Music] he has shown his light around me that I could clearly see if it wasn't more than my house tell me where what this should be let's sing at last everybody [Music] out for the big ships don't sail this way anymore there's no use of its standing ground but then my mind goes back to that stormy time went just in time I saw that light it was alive from that Old Lighthouse that stands upon the hill and I thank God foreign [Music] that I could clearly see if it wasn't more that White House tell me where would this ship me and I thank God oh thank you Lord hallelujah oh yes Hallelujah Mercy is that White House house amen [Music] Hallelujah where would we be Saints where would we be Saints who weren't for the lighthouse Jesus amen shining around us oh God I remember why I don't sing this anymore praise the Lord but my mind goes back to that time when if it weren't for him I don't know where I'd be since amen I don't know where I'd be because he shined his light around me yes and I could see you around amen changed my life made me a new creature maybe want more and more and more of him than more of this life yes praise the Lord there's people all around us every day Saints they fight they struggle they push they pull just to try to gain a little more of life amen but I want more of him amen amen I want more of him praise the Lord all of what we can gain in this life will be Cannon father one day but all that we can send before us will be there waiting on us when we get there yes amen thank God for that Lighthouse Hallelujah does anyone have a testimony or something let me apart before we change the world of service sisters to Nogales from our dental appointment by myself oh praise the Lord very very smooth I always says it's just it's just beautiful they knew about it for their prayers amen my families they can most of all yes the lord always with us amen never leaves or for Sexes that's the first time you did it alone and they've gone several times but usually have somebody with you amen wonderful God is good anyone else further dance yes um last night Leah was feeling really bad and she told me you're going to have to stay with me tomorrow I'm just feeling bad so is it okay whatever you need you know I'll be there for you and I pray because the Lord make a way that can relate to church and you were feeling better this morning still down in a dump somewhat but she says yeah go to church I'll be fine amen so I thank the Lord for that praise the Lord and uh a couple of weeks ago out of misplaced my wallet and um a lot of times in my trucks things slide towards the back so Danny got a flashlight look under the seat I got a flashlight oh I just couldn't find it I went back and the Lord and pressing my heart to go back with a flashlight and look under the seat again I did and there it was wow praise the Lord wonderful is this normal well my husband told me about that blue wrote a book and it's called if hmm and he said do you know that in the Bible it said if you go obey if you will do that right then yeah that's right he said it's a free moral choice you want to do this God will give you promises so I thank God that you know had to remind my husband your husband yeah amen very true God absolutely so very true amen that's I I believe that amen you know I hear so many times certain quotes of the Bible quoted uh one on my you hear a lot resist the devil and he'll flee from you that is true that is scripture but you can't dismiss the first part of that scripture which says submit yourselves therefore unto God then you can resist the devil and he has to plead he doesn't have to flee at your word but he has to flee at your word from him it's the life behind the name amen so we sometimes we forget that part resist the devil so I resist the devil he didn't flee but but did you do the first part of that scripture did you submit yourself therefore unto God Amen if thou be amen it's like that song Micah sings it the Gaithers sing do you want to be well amen if you'll do this if you want to be well amen uh if if you're well what you plan to do after you have to if the Lord performs a miracle in your life that the Lord heals you completely what are you going to do with your life right right what's he gonna do are you gonna amen do you really want to amen I think that's a very profound thing amen anyone else I felt to seeing something but I wasn't quite sure what it was and the song came to my heart it was just impressed I said well if he asks again and again again even after several testimonies that I made it's not in there but I've seen it all the time and it's 380 in the book so [Music] I was [Music] heard us [Music] amen because he touched me oh he touched me and all the joy that blocks my soul [Music] he touched me and he made amen thank you Jesus I'm at this place [Music] oh yes hallelujah amen [Music] ities yes yes amen you touch me oh Jesus touch me and all the joy that God's eyes [Music] something wonderful [Music] he touched me anyway and since we've had this places presence he could have sent me [Music] he touched me oh he touched me [Music] something wonderful happened [Music] oh Jesus touch me [Music] something wonderful however oh my God Jesus touched me and he made yes yes yes Hallelujah amen thank you Jesus thank you Jesus Hallelujah I'm so thankful a touch from him will change your life praise the Lord let's stand to our feet now and we'll turn our in the scripture in our Bibles to Genesis chapter one two praise the Lord so thankfully he's touched us thankfully he's made us cleansed and made us whole amen by the blood of Jesus Christ yes by the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah we'll continue on now I've only got a few more here aboard Wheeling A New Beginning this will be part 19. amen we want to talk a little bit about the city today amen Lord Willem will get to the walls and that's probably might finish it up there so we'll see how it'll work wherever the Lord takes it so I want to do whatever his perfect will and be led by his Spirit Genesis 1 1-2 before we re-list our heads again for word of Prayer precious Lord Jesus father so very thankful again Lord it just overwhelming the things that we could say the things that we feel in our heart our Spirits it's overwhelming today Lord and just knowing that you're here knowing your presence is flowing through this place and knowing that we feel you real lord and recognizing and reminiscing and Lord in our hearts uh reflecting about what you've done for us and Lord where you've brought us from from and where we are today and God how you've strengthened and blessed us and to brought us to this place of where we are today certainly God we're not what we want to be but it's just like that lady that gave that testimony I'm not what I want to be I'm not what I ought to be but I'm certainly not what I used to be and that's only by your grace Lord It's Only by your mercy it's only by you leading us and bringing us and showing us yourself and revealing to us every day that we might grow in Grace Lord and grow into the statue of a perfect man and the image and the likeness of Jesus Christ the word Lord bless this service bless these people bless those who may be streaming Lord and speak to our hearts Lord speak to these lips anoint every one of us father to speak receive and know by Revelation what your will would be God through this word all encourage Us by us by it Lord help us to recognize and see Lord this is our home this is where we're going not this Cosmos that we live here on this Earth with the with the governments and the medicines and the doctors and the hospitals and the police and all this going on around this world the bias and the racism and the the the the the the biased Lord religious and and every which way God but there's just a place of love and peace and mercy and Grace and Harmony and oh Lord we just look for that place God help us in this service Lord to accomplish that that you sent us forth for and whatever that might be today we rebuke every demonic spirit that would hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory and honor and praise for all that is said and done here today for it's in your precious loving name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Genesis chapter one read the first couple of verses amen Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness is upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters you could be seated if you'd like amen foreign as I mentioned this is a new beginning part 19. amen and I want to go over to Saint John chapter 14. before we get back into Revelation 21 I want to go over to Saint John chapter 14 and begin our next scripture reading from there Jesus speaking of this that we're looking for this is Jesus speaking of what we have to look forward to amen he described it to his disciples and uh and by revelation we see in this reading that we'll go into what Jesus is trying to explain to not only his disciples here but us today through the ability for us to be able to open these pages and to read these words and to know God revealing those words off of that page into our hearts amen so let's begin reading Saint John 14 uh we'll just begin reading with verse 1. Jesus said let your heart let your let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me that's one of my favorite scriptures I like that verse especially when you feel overwhelmed or you feel depressed or you feel lost or in any way for some kind of encouragement uh here it is Jesus said let not your heart be troubled when you see everything going on around you see all the turmoil of the world today and you can't understand we just get to the place it me saying what is wrong with people is probably coming a phrase I use daily I probably just need to quit saying that I I pretty much know what's wrong with people but when you see certain things happen in your life what is wrong with people when Common Sense isn't so common anymore um I probably just need to quit doing that but uh but when you see those things you you know as much as we do what we can in this world this world is not our home Jesus spoke to us and said let not your heart be troubled amen that's some of the greatest words I know that we can tell to anybody especially if you're a Christian let not your heart be troubled what is there to worry about what is there to uh fraternize over what is there to be depressed about or stressed over when Jesus said let not your heart be troubled amen he's got it all under control he's handling it all amen no matter what the circumstances look like perfect faith brother Graham said perfect Faith Masters every circumstance right let not your heart be troubled amen you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also what a wonderful promise and whether I go ye know and the way ye know Thomas said unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way Jesus said unto him I am the way amen I am the way the truth the life no man cometh unto the father but by me amen uh if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him Philip said unto him Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us Jesus said unto him have I been so long time with you and yet he has uh hast thou not known me Philip he that has seen me has seen the father and has uh and has and and how sayest thou show us the father believeth thou that I am in the father and the father in me and the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but uh but the father that dwelleth in me uh in me he dwell uh doeth the works uh believe uh believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sake now Jesus is speaking about a place that he has gone to prepare for us amen and he tells his disciples here and he gets personal with them but before we get to that uh let's go back and reiterate talk about these little nuances that the that the Lord Jesus gives us here in this reading of the word in my father's house are many mansions now in our English language that doesn't make any sense a house uh in my father's house or many mansions well we figure a mansion is a humongous place that people live in and a house is just a small little darling place so how could a mansion that in a house Must List many mansions fit in one house so we understand if you go and look at what Jesus was talking about back in that vernacular that day a house was considered a kingdom and in my kingdom are many palaces or Mansions you could still s Palace but the house is a kingdom not just one simple dwelling place that has four walls and a door but a kingdom so the house that he's talking about is his kingdom in My Kingdom there's many palaces amen because he said he has already gone to prepare that place now a lot of people in this life they want to gain a lot of money and they want to have big houses and palaces and mansions and things like that and that's okay there's nothing wrong with that um whatever a person is ours is not my desire at one point in my life I used to uh I'll tell you something that one of the greatest lessons brother green ever taught me where we're going up Campbell I believe it was and I told him I said I'd like to have a house up there on the hill he looked at me and he said why and I couldn't answer him because of the city lights because the Mountain Lights I I didn't know there's millions of dollars millions of dollars up on that Hillside he looked at me said why do you want one up there and I really couldn't answer them because it was just vanity actually when I looked internally at his question to me the only thing that I could surmise in me was it's just vanity I just wanted one because it was big it was expensive it was beautiful the view or whatever it was but when when his question broke down in my heart to why it made me realize why do I want something like that hey it's just more headache it's just more upkeep it's just more expensive it's just more to clean it's just more to have to deal with why why would I want something like that when I hear Brother Ray I'm talking about when they a little cabin by the Riverside I'm thinking now that's more my speed amen now can somebody if you want to answer there's nothing wrong with that you want one up there that's fine maybe you can connect question just the question in my life was when he asked it to me was just pure vanity that's all it was in my in my heart and that helped me because I I got rid of that I'm like you know truth is I really don't and at this point in my life or our life just the two of us why would I want ten thousand square foot for me and my wife I'm or even if my son and daughter and family came over what is that eight of us total now with little baby ruth what's the point so anyway uh some people like that and that's okay but in God's kingdom there's many palaces or places of dwelling amen places of dwelling that place he has gone to prepare for us is places that's already built now in the Millennium we talked about that uh in there we will work we will build houses we will inhabit the houses that we build we will plant Vineyards we will eat it the fruit of those Vineyards but in this place it's already built we don't build this God's already built it so when he says in my kingdom are many mansions or many palaces you can understand that God's already done it he said I have gone to prepare a place for you amen I've gone to prepare and that's what God has done so when we read the scripture which we'll read again in a minute that John saw the holy city coming down from God out of Heaven is because God was it there in preparation of that place to bring it down upon that mountain so when Jesus said I have gone to prepare a place you can believe that because if they're waiting for this destruction of this Earth and that mountain to push up so that City can come right down on top of that mountain and set down upon that mountain and for all for all of us to eventually live upon amen amen praise the Lord so in my father's Kingdom now our many mansions palaces if it were not Saul I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you amen I'm thankful for that that's that place he's talking about now that's that place we've been reading about that's that place that we've been preaching on for almost 19 went on 19 sermons now with the new beginning it's that place Jesus said I go to prepare that place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you that means I'm going to come and get you and take you back with me so that we can all be in that place I prepared this place for you think about that for a minute amen because the Bible tells us that this world was created by God for God amen we live here we enjoy the parts of this world that we can uh many of it we can't anymore especially that we can and and that's good but this place God said I've gone to prepare for you amen it doesn't say he prepared this place for himself like he did this Earth but this place he said I've gone to prepare for you so you can think in your heart and know that whatever is about all of our individualities always because so many times friends and I hate this but so many times and I'll say it preachers especially want to stick everybody in a little box and and and make us like we're supposed to be cookie cutter Christians that every one of us are supposed to come out on some Godly conveyor belt and as we go by God's got a stamp it says boom there's Boo and every one of us is supposed to be exactly the same so when there's any variance of anybody when there's any different things in our lives not ungodly not sinful but just differences amen you you may eat you may eat Mexican food every day I eat it once every two or three months because I like it but I don't like it like that uh my son he probably would choose sushi restaurant over any other place yes yes I wouldn't go there if it was the last restaurant on the planet I would go find a squirrel or a rabbit or something and Chase it down and kill it before I would go to a sushi restaurant or eat sushi there are other things at sushi restaurants now that I do like like dip knock yourself but anyway not sushi so even my son for my own Lawrence is that much different than me see we're not cookie cutter Christians so when God says he's gone to prepare it for you that means that your Mansion your Palace your place of dwelling wherever God has for you when brother random talks about his Log Cabin friend if that was the desire in his heart you can bet on that's what's going to be there right right that's the way I believe anyway and what is in your heart what God does for you see this place is prepared for us amen it's gonna fit your little nuances and desires and things that you like nothing worldly not nothing vain it's not going to be vanity none of that's going to be there but from the very desire of your heart desires like that that's how God's preparing this preparing it for you amen not for himself but for few uh for you I've gone and prepare a place for you amen amen I will come again and receive you unto myself and that's what we're waiting for as the time now that's the place that we're sitting hopefully prayerfully we're believing is going to be not too much longer we don't know but that's up to him but he's going to come and receive us back unto himself that where he is is where we'll be amen and I like that and it won't just be in a spirit form like we know now that Jesus said I'll never leave you or forsake you he's always with us we know that but this won't just be Spirit form this will be he'll be there and we'll be there praise the Lord sometimes family moves away and goes and does things say well my spirit will be with you or I will be with you or something like that when you know but it's different when you're right there when you're right there together and that's exactly what it's going to be we're going to be right there with him every day yes praise the Lord every day there will I uh ye be also and whether I go now listen remember he's talking to his disciples here he says and whether I go you know so he's telling them where I'm going you know where I'm going and you know the way to get there you know how to get there and the way you know he's he's telling his disciples you know where I'm going and you know how to get there and look at the first thing Thomas says of course probably just he's just speaking up for the rest of them because they probably all thought the same thing Thomas said unto him Lord we don't know where you're going we know we we know not whether they're going and how can we know the way which makes sense how can you know to get there if you don't even know where you're going right amen if you've never been to Tucson before and I'm and I I tell you to go to a store over at 22nd Broadway oh what good does that do you you may not know or just say uh go to the go to the fries on the other side of town or or just go to the grocery store which grocery store which town this town how do you get there so it makes sense I mean what Thomas says makes sense if I don't even know where you're going how can I know how to get there if I don't know where you're going but the thing is they already knew if they didn't already know Jesus wouldn't have told them that right right Jesus told him you already know Thomas said no we don't Jesus said yes you do you just don't know you know and see that's something that I look at today kind of the place a lot of times where the bride is today there's a sequels faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God it helps bring us to a place and I've heard so many times people said we go to church and and we go home we go to church we go home if you go to church and the pure word of God the pure unadulterated word of God not man's ideas but the word of God is priests it cannot return void amen and if it cannot return void that means it is working something in your life yes and if it's working something in your life whether you know it whether you can feel it whether it's become to use something of a reality of that time it is working a work in your life and you have to believe and have faith and know that that word is taking its uh preeminence in your life amen it's working to work Jesus being in their presence was working at work and those disciples lives way more than they ever thought and so when it got to this place and Jesus said you know where I'm going you know how to get there they knew it but they just didn't know sometimes that's exactly where we need to get to we know you think well how does this fracturing Faith gonna be you'll know it when the time comes yes that's the way I see it some people say well it's got to be this got to be that I don't like the guy to bees anyway because I don't put a period at the end of my sentence this year when it comes to the Lord I put a comma amen and there's no gotta bees it doesn't got to be it's got to be according to a scripture but that's it amen any other God of bees doesn't have to go to be because that puts in your little box again right it doesn't got to be this way it's got to be the way God says it's going to be whether you understand it or not right amen amen no God is what's got to be like this no it doesn't right right it's going to be the way he says it's going to be and when God and this bride because I've heard people say well how's this and even Brothers Brother Band would say how how can we expect rapturing Faith don't have faith to heal a headache yes but friend let me promise just one thing for those who of course surprise this words being priests that work is being done in your life when you need Rapture faith and rapturing faith is Premiere at that time you will have it you will have something you don't realize you have right now we all do we are because the word to not return void you have something now we all do that you don't know they had something they didn't know they didn't know where he was going they didn't know the way that's why Jesus had to tell him I am the way if you don't know the way then you don't know me if you know me Jesus saying I'm pointing myself but Jesus is saying if you know me you know the way I've told you that's what he was just starting telling them when you've seen me you've seen the father so you know who it is you know how to get there because I'm the way and if you know me you know the way it's that simple if we know him we know the way right right if we know him we have the faith if we know him we know everything we need to know the Overcomers to overcome praise the Lord everything we have need to know we know now praise God Jesus said I am the way I am the truth and I am the life no man coming to the father but by me he told pilate the same thing amen and pilate looked at him and said what is truth without revelation he didn't know and he genuinely didn't know and he said what is truth well truth is standing right there staring you in your eyeball that's truth because truth's not a thing it's not a statement it's a person truth is a person and the person of Jesus Christ yes that is the way the truth the life amen nobody could come in the father but by him and he goes on and describes that now let's move on to the city he's talking about because this city is not only as we are going to live in that physical City in glorified conditions we're not going to be clouds puffing around just floating around and hello brother Dennis and hello sister Celia we're not going to be clouds just floating around we're going to be peaceful and glorified bodies yeah amen there'll be no there'll be no sin there'll be no uh fleshly humanly desires like we have today right amen we'll all be in the prom of Life which brother Brown described as around 19 20 21 years old and the problem of life before that first light goes out which I think he said we talked about the other day was that 21-22 I forget now the First Light of Life goes out at about 21 22 years old so to me it would have to be before that first light went out would be considered the problem of life sure so I'm assuming that's why brother Brandon mentioned 90 20 21 years old will be in that place in that condition but this will also be a this won't just because even though it'll be a physical uh event that takes place this mountain and the city uh and we'll be there with him in physical we see the light we talked about last week Jesus the lamb is the light it'll also be a spiritual event because anything with God is the spiritual event because he's a spirit amen God is a spirit so we know it will be but even the Corporal body of the position of Jesus uh will be prominent here obviously well there'll be a time when it won't be but that's Way Beyond anything that we have written or can think of or worry about amen but here it will be it'll be a prominent event spiritual and natural physical event as again as we are in our glorified bodies if you know me you should have known my father also and from henceforth uh you know him and has seen him now let's move on let's go over I want to read the rest of that let's go over to Revelation now uh chapter 21. so I can I can tell us all the same thing if you're a Believer if you're an overcomer if you're a Christian born-again Christian you know the way because you know him because Jesus is the way yes amen right he is the way so if you know him you know the way praise the Lord so when he says I'm going to come and and get you and take you back so that I'm with you always you're with me always we know that way because we know him praise the Lord been revealed God has shown Us in this day future home let me read this he's talking about Feast of Tabernacles gathering places for in the Millennium look now I think maybe I've already said this in the Millennium the Bible said they shall build houses they shall inhabit them but in this new Earth he's already went and prepared the place it's already built praise the Lord already built we just read it Jesus said I go to prepare a place we have nothing to do with the building of it amen because it's Eternal it's uh uh we enter into eternity oh I just love that word my a holy complication holy Gathering Place we went into that few few months ago now let's go Revelation chapter 21 uh we'll just begin with the first verse but I want to read the whole chapter whole chapter revelation 21. and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more to see I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband why because he made it for you amen amen in that in that the bride the bride to the husband praise the Lord oh that's beautiful uh third verse and I heard a great voice uh Out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God Amen God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying think of what this is going to be like Saints amen no crying neither shall there be any more pain no more pain brother no more leg cramps amen no more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is the thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life freely he that overcometh look at this now he that overcometh and he's speaking about the Overcomer which we will talk about a little bit through the finishing duration of this message uh like he does in Revelation 3 21. amen you know what let me just shoot over there real quick Revelation 3 21 to him that overcometh I will grant you sit with me in in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne now the overcomer he that over at seventh verse again Revelation 21 7 back here again he that overcometh shall inherit all things well of course you're going to inherit all things because they've inherited to sit with him in his throne only the Overcomer who inherits all things sit on the throne I that that's the only ones that could be there they may and the older ones that could sit in judgment praise the Lord inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and the Abominable the murderers poor mongers Sorcerers idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death now these are people of course that that died their first natural death did not come for the Thousand Years of the Millennium they laid in the grave amen come up at the end of the second uh in the second Resurrection after the Millennium to be judged at the white Throne judgment and were cast aside on the Left Right amen not not as the Sheep but as the goat to the left and we're cast into the Lake of Fire With the Devil with the false prophet the Beast in the Lake of Fire which burns with Brimstone it's the second death now what is death remember death is separation right death is a separation from God when God told them in the Garden of Eden the day you do this the day you die well they didn't die not naturally they still live their natural lives so if you read the scripture and God tells them and they did exactly what he told them not to do and God said if you do this you'll die what they did is they separated themselves from God Amen a great Chasm was thrown between God and man not to be returned again until the until the time of the birth of Jesus Christ who shed his life blood gave his life to bridge that Gap the blood of Jesus Christ bled to bridge the chasm to bring God and man back together again but at this time they separated themselves so what is the second death the second death is not only a a separation a complete separation but it's a permanent separation yes this separation or the second death as is called here in the scripture is a permanent separation of those that are in the Lake of Fire from God right amen amen no more chance no more hope it is over yes separated the second death amen this is set for those that fit this scripture reading verse 8 the Abominable whoremongers murders Sorcerers all those things Liars but understand you say well I'm not a sorcerer but if you if you do things in that capacity see it doesn't have to be somebody that worships the devil or uh something to that effect this is a generality statements adjectives words to describe uh those situations encompasses many actions uh sorcerer is not just a a Wiccan or a wizard amen there's there's thousands maybe millions of people that fall into this category not because they worship the devil or are a wizard or something to that effect but of the actions that they produce in their lives make makes them uh follows them under that category amen amen like a murderer murder is not just somebody that takes a person's life according to the Bible a murder is somebody who speaks something ill about somebody else and their tongue and their verbiage destroys that person's character right right that's murder when you say something or you present something about somebody to somebody else that's why you got to be very careful how you talk about other people's things yes uh I've probably been guilty of it of my life in the past and the Lord help me I try not to man we got to be very careful the way we talk about other people you could kill or murder that person to somebody else just with your tongue you don't have to have a gun you don't have the ax or Knight you can kill their character and if you do that you're You're a murderer right amen Jesus said uh that thou sayeth said whoever takes the life he said he said Jesus said I say whoever hates your brother without cause is a murder already hating your brother without cause amen and and what causes there for us to hate anybody is is mighty right you love it yeah I don't have any reason to hate anybody amen I don't care what they've done now you may disagree with that and you're welcome to but I I don't have a reason to hate anybody the Bible Jesus said to love your enemies well if you can't hate your enemies and you're supposed to love your enemies then who are you going to hate there's nobody left if you can't hate your enemy then who is there to hate yeah if you feel like you hate a person you're automatically going to do what put them into the enemy category right but if you're supposed to love your enemy how are you gonna hate them amen so you understand my point yeah so when Jesus said if you hate your brother without cause how can you hate him to begin with but our tongue destroys people's characters amen and when you do that you're a murderer so my point being is people look at this say well I didn't do that and I didn't know and I didn't do that and I wasn't like that no but what were we like what did we do that could fall under any of these things that he's talking about oh I just tell a little white lie I don't care if it's blue green brown purple yellow psychedelic it's a lie if it's a lie it's a lie white green yellow purple doesn't matter it's a lot you understand amen and of course this also is people who did not and did not accept and rejected the blood of Jesus Christ which cleanses any of that from all of our lives and could cleanse all of that from all of our Lives if we expect it believe it and receive it to ourselves that blood will annihilate because they any of us in here could say we didn't lie at some point in our lives amen but if we're truly repentful in our hearts and we go to the Lord and ask forgiveness he forgives us we don't live we don't live a Perpetual life of lying that's different amen let's move on that's the second death now and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vowels full of the seven last plagues and talk with me saying come hither and I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife okay now that angel is going to show John me and you because we're that bribe yes amen I like that praise the Lord and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God having the glory of God remember it's not just physical but it's spiritual too having the glory of God and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clearest Crystal maybe I get Mike up here to give us a gym lesson about all these gems we're getting ready to talk about they're all through the scripture those things and every one of them has a significance and relevance in the scripture amen many of them deal with the Jews probably get into later and he had a wall great and high that had 12 gates and at the gates 12 angels and names were written there on which are which are the names of the 12 tribes of the children of Israel on the East three gates on the north three gates on the south three gates on the west three gates we're not getting to the wall yet so I'm just going to skip through this and the wall of the city had 12 foundations and then the names of The Twelve Apostles of the lamb and he had talked with me had and he that talked to me had a great a golden Reed to measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall thereof in the city life Foursquare the length is as large as the breath as he measured the city with the Reed 12 000 furlongs the length of breadth the height are all equal and we've already went through that and he measured the wall thereof and 140 and four cubits according to the measure of a man that is of the Angel the building of the wall of it was a pure uh was of Jasper and the city was pure gold the city which we're talking about now because that's more I want to focus on here is we've uh as we've talked about the city the city now not the wall the city was pure gold like unto clear glass I I actually have a hard time envisioning that now I have items that are gone I mean this ring I got is pure gold uh forgot 14 probably cared but clear glass pure gold like clear glass transparent like you can look through it that just that's incredible I some of these things you just pure gold like under clear glass the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones the First Foundation was Jasper's second Sapphire third uh I haven't looked these up in a while so forgive me fourth Emerald fifth uh star dunks the Sig sarda seventh crystalite eighth barreled Knight topaz 10th uh I'm not sure the 11th uh a uh John kith the 12th an amethyst now I look at that the the lemon and reminds me of the Street next to the Tabernacle placento yeah it's almost the exact same spelling except that the end has an O on the Stream I always thought that was very outstanding unusual especially the way that God used brother Brown about brother brother Green in his life and the 12 gates were 12 pearls uh every several gate was of uh was of Pearl and the street of the city the street of the city now was pure gold and as it were transparent glass wow that's just that's just incredible thing and I saw no Temple now this is some of what we've gotten into already and I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof the nations of them which uh which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it the Kings of the earth to bring their Glory into it we talked about that the other day the gates of it shall not be shut At All by day for there shall be no night there in other words he's just saying it won't be shut and they shall bring the glory in honor of the Nations into it and there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth neither whatsoever worketh Abomination or make it the lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life the bride yes and he showed me a pure now we're getting to the city more he showed me a pure River of of Water of Life clear as Crystal proceeding out of the Lamb of God and of the lamb now that's wonderful see to see that water that pure River uh of of Water of Life clear as Crystal coming out of the Throne of God and remember where we talked about The Throne of this course is in the top which it wouldn't make much sense for the throne to be at the bottom or the water the river to come out of the bottom but it comes out of the top and runs along down through this city down through this mountain amen of this city that produces to every Palace every dwelling that's along there clear as Crystal preceding out of the Throne of God and of the Lamb in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the Tree of Life amen I'm going to read you something a little bit the brother Brown talks about this was there a tree of life which bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the Nations we talked about that the other day and Jesus ruling with the rod of iron and they come the Kings come to bring in the the leaves which were a a symbol of peace especially when you think about uh uh what was the first thing that the that the dove brought back to the ark was an olive branch with olive leaves of the leaf on it it's it's given in some in symbolic form of of of a p of Peace amen of a gesture of Peace these leaves the tree were for the healing of the Nations and there shall be no more curse but the Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it and his servants Shall Serve him and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads and there shall be no night there and they have no they need no candle neither light the Sun for the Lord God giveth him light and they shall reign forever and ever of course we talked about that light the other day so we to recognize this is probably in what human language could be brought is more beautiful than we could imagine uh obviously things of this even from what Jesus told us in Saint John 14 to what John the Revelator is speaking up here that was shown to him in Revelation 21 and 22 just go beyond human comprehension uh so the little things that we can Envision from this scripture reading helps us get an idea of of sort of what it might be like look like let me see let me read this to you because brother random goes in you know he was a lot better at dramatizing things than I was and and drawing these pictures out so let me read this it's obviously from future home Jesus got to prepare with the Divine hands a Divine City Divine architect for a Divine boughten people that's his bride the Bride of Jesus Christ for a predestinated people he has gone to prepare Abraham was looking for it now we've got into this before too Abraham was looking for it and he professed that he was a pilgrim and stranger for he looked for a city whose Builder and maker was God that Prophet knowing it was somewhere that city was somewhere amen he just didn't realize it was above him instead of in front of him but he did spiritually meet that City that low cost from the former melchized amen knowing it was somewhere John saw it just wasn't time for that Revelation that was all uh John saw it coming down but Abraham thought it must have been on Earth right then why because he met Melchizedek the king of it and gave him tithing praise the Lord which had no father no mother he had no beginning of Life for ending of or ending of life Abraham met him and they took communion right on the literal spot where the city will be raised up actually the mountains raised up the city comes down uh the Holy Mountain of the Lord where the redeemed will live praise the Lord amen so glad I'm part of that redeem that time just uh that time just don't stop no uh we're in time after a while we go into eternity we've talked about that too Oh Holy Mountain there will be streets of transparent gold Avenues houses and Parks he says if you want to read this Revelation 21 the tree of life will be there 12 different manners of fruit one each month will be born on it the people that eat this fruit they'll change their diet every month and it from and is the Tree of Life is only for the Overcomers praise the Lord over the Overcomer has inherited all things praise the Lord the ones outside of the city the kings that come in and bring their uh offering in for healing they are not partakers of that this is only for the bride and those on that mountain yes the Overcomer praise the Lord they'll be the Jews as well Overcomers 144 000. uh I would say I have never found a place where brother Brandon was specific about the Jews on this my understanding or thought about would be the 144 000 it's got to come from uh it's got to come all the way back from the Old Testament because God testifies of them as he taught as Jesus I didn't want to get into this today but is Jesus testifies in this of the city as the bride adored for her husband he talks about the bride the Gentile bride but when he describes the walls around the city everything about that he talks and describes is about the Jews amen so this city is not just for gentiles so understand it is for Jews so who of them will be there I believe of course it'll be the 144 000 those that were in the Millennium um it'll have to be Old Testament saints that come through so to what degree that is I couldn't tell you um obviously brother Branham was sent to a gentile bride not to a Jewish bride so uh some of those things that the Jews as between them and God right they're saved as a people and God takes care of that but they will be there as well but now he says now this but those outside the city because there will be workers there will be people living outside the city outside the walls of this city amen those ones that bring in the least for the healing of the Nations but this city this tree of life will only be for the overcomer only for the Overcomer do you know that it isn't for denominations you mean to say brother randomly turn to Revelation 2 he said just a minute uh Revelation 2 7 we find here uh whether it's really the truth or not reads like this now remember he is not talking uh to the Jews only this is the church the Gentile Church bride he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit said to the churches to him that overcome it amen amen I will give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God amen again to the overcomer Revelation 3 21 Revelation 21 that we just read and uh and as God described that for us Overcomers only that overcome the Beast overcome his mark That's Catholicism protestantism denominationalism who overcome the Beast his Mark the letter of his name he'll have a right to the Tree of Life to enter in the gates where nothing can defile nothing that goes in it can defile think of it now just a moment now go a little further tree of light will be for the Overcomer only the leaves the leaves will be for the healing of the Nations this is the kings that live in there outside the city bringing their honor in when they bring their honor in and Lay It Before the Throne of God just like the outside the 11 tribes brought in every one of them of the tribes of Israel every one of those other 11 tribes brought into the priesthood the tent uh to the 12th the Levites a tenth part which was timing that he talked about those will bring in from the outside of the city in to God to the throne of God just like in brother Branham just makes a reference the way it used to be with the levitical priesthood and those other 11 tribes had to bring the tenth of theirs to the priesthood so that they're always food in the storehouse yeah amen that's the only way there's food in the storehouse praise the Lord God we need to store we need food in our storehouse when they bring their honor into from the Blessed land they've received the Tree of Life break off a holly leaf tree of a tree of life leap they'll they'll walk out together there's no more war everything is at peace the leaves are a memorial for the healing this is what I was thinking of trying to get out earlier leaves are a memorial for the healing of the Nations the same tree not like Adam he was there was a tree of life in the Garden of Eden that was might not be eaten from it had uh before it failed the Tree of Life reminded him all the time of his youth continually going on the Tree of Life there was not to be partaken of but uh continually reminded him of his youth Perpetual youth is the way it was supposed to be which it will be as well in the in the new city a Perpetual youth there won't be as we get there as 19 20 21 in the problem of life and and we go old from there uh no it's a Perpetual life of living in that state that you're in amen same will uh same with all the nations the leaves will be for the healing of the Nations notice not no sickness now you've had the same rice as Adam notice the River of Light perhaps many although I like this many little streams making it up now in the Earth he talks about the River of Life I'm going to close just a few minutes Earth uh for I'm going to stop this and move on I've never seen nothing so quenching as to be in the mountains and find as I preached the other night that stream bubbling up that life-giving Source tired and thirsty fall down by a good strain I agree with that uh made down uh way downward germs can't even go hundreds of feet below the surface that water bubbling up coming up into life Everlasting in that natural life that gives such a a um a thirst quench amen that that gives life to us to those who drink it praise the Lord brother Graham explains this which I got to just a minute ago uh he questions and answers brother Branham who will populate the Earth outside the Heavenly City obviously we know we've already said there will be a population there will be people populated outside the walls of this city this question is brother Ram who are those people now who will populate the Earth outside of the city outside in outside it will be the redeemed that will pollute the Earth out beside the city but they will not be the elected called bride so who will these people be he called them the redeemed well just like we just read uh back when we talked and the uh the white Throne judgment those the foolish virgins that gave their lives that God separated as sheep on the right hand side they were granted life they were granted Redemption but they weren't granted rights to what the bride is granted to right they weren't Overcomers to inherit all things they were just given life for the purpose of what they did amen because remember they all were judged according to their deeds and these people remember uh when did we do this when you fed me when you clothed me when you visited me in prison when you did these things see and God and those are the foolish virgins they stayed virtuous they stayed virtuous remember even the foolish virgins were virtuous they were undefiled yes even though they didn't have the Holy Ghost uh New Birth they were still virtuous they were still Untouched by man's ideas religions they were still virtuous and they came forth even if they had to be purged during the tribulation even though they had foolish virgins all the way through the uh the church ages if they had to do that they still came up and God separated them as the sheep from the goats on the right hand side they were granted life and they are given life and they are there they're just what the bride characters of of the holy city so they live outside the city yes amen they live outside the city outside the walls of the city they will be the redeemed amen that God did redeem based on their deeds that will populate the Earth outside the city but not the elect called bride the bride will live inside the city inside the kingdom with the King on the outside will be the kings of the earth that labor and bring their toil uh he said not toils but fruit into the city and the Legion for the healing of the Nations and the doors will not be closed by night now this light on top of this mountain will not lighten the whole world uh I I kind of got into that a little bit last week and this really isn't the point I wanted to make today but I wanted to show you that when brother Branham made that statement in the future home he does correct it because in future home he said this light will lighten the horror then I tried to explain that a little bit to say you know unless there's some illumination we don't know of this is not going to be able to cover the entire Earth and brother Graham says that here she says now the light on top of the mountain will not lighten the whole world it'll only lighten the city that around the city obviously but it can be seen in distance of thousands of miles maybe but that still when you're talking about the uh 8 000 mile Earth from top to bottom uh it's not going to lighten the entire Earth world this ball of dirt it's not going to lighten the whole thing but it can be seen Thousand Miles maybe but it won't lighten the Earth because the Bible says in the new world from one Sabbath to another from one new moon to the other will people come up before the Lord unto Zine up to the city to worship and now there will uh now they will be outside the city not the bride but the people that come up in the second Resurrection will be killers of the soil just like Adam was and so forth career uh uh and carers of the garden but the king and queen will be in the city amen and then in the new city the New Jerusalem praise the Lord and now we notice I'm not going to take this out to draw this week because I'm getting ready to close we'll start that Lord willing next time uh of of the four walls that are around the city when I first saw this or heard it without Revelation but how can there be four walls around a pyramid I've always thought of a pyramid as three sides but there's also pyramids that are four-sided pyramids hence this city the mountain that's four-sided in the image of a pyramid instead of three and when you've got that you've got walls that can go all the way around it makes more sense then this city will be uh uh Mountain will be walled all the way around the city amen let me read this one more thing I'm going to close because I've already we've gone into the other things that I had I wanted to speak on today so you understand there will be the bride those Jews that will be in the city the Overcomers in the sea and there will be workers people outside the city it won't just be those that are inside but outside and outside the walls of the city future home let me read this I'm going to close he said now um just a minute go a little bit for the Tree of Life the Tree of Life uh well praise the Lord I already read that so we've got that anyway amen another thing he talks about leads the Nations for the uh for the healing of the Nations the Kings bringing in his honors Memorial uh uh as a tribute amen from the outside to bring to the inside Gates will be open uh there'll be no shut in the gates there'll be no Darkness there'll be no night it'll be a time of Water of Life the water that runs down through all the crevices and place of this city uh the gold the transparent gold of water crystal clear and and that's just a part of what this city is going to be like and amen just apart Tree of Life on both sides all around it just kind of starts getting me to understand why even as a little boy I've always thought about and liked mountains some of the best times I ever had in my life as a kid was going with my friend and into the mountains to his grandmother who basically lived on the side of underneath a rock on the bottom side of a mountain Creek Running Down Below we'd go play in the water and fish for trout and just some of the best times I ever had in my life was was right there in that place I thought how could there be any more anything any more peaceful on the earth than just out here in the middle of nowhere in the Stream and the provision that God made and in my heart it's always kind of been that way and I hear Brother Brown when I grow up talking about it and having a cabin down by that Creek or as they would call it Creek uh back there next to the river um it's just something that warms the heart there's a lot of people that's not satisfying for them but it is for me uh I I find the simple parts of life when I was young was some of the best times of my life and then grew up and felt like I needed to have the world on my shoulders and then you get older and you like it just takes right back to the revert to the Simplicity of where it was and where your heart is it makes me realize God gave me that heart because that's where I'm going yes that's that's not just the beginning of my natural life it's going to be in the end in my spiritual life yes amen and if I can have a cabin next to brother branhams or wherever it is doesn't have to be next to him uh I'll be happy yes praise the Lord top of the mountain bottom of the Mountain Middle of the mountain wherever it is I just want to be there I just want to be there I has not seen ears not heard neither in the heart of man what God's got in store amen let's stand if we could praise the Lord I wish I could do it justice I bet brother Brown I would think I would think brother Branham probably felt the same way I wish you could do it justice try to take it from the scripture and try to make try to bring it the way it's in your heart the way you see it the way God reveals it is just so hard to do amen it's just so hard to do amen I got a song with my heart I don't even know if it's in this book um let me see if I can find it real quick if not it's it's a very simple course uh I think Ray Boltz used to sing it sit here it's got the same title that might not be the same song about 258. 258 that's the course that's on my heart it's in here I will praise the Lord amen I will praise the Lord no
