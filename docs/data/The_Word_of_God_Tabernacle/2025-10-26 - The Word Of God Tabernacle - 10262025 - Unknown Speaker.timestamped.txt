[32:41] for another word of prayer. Dear Lord
[32:43] Jesus, so very thankful again, Father,
[32:45] of this word.
[32:48] Lord, this word is our lamp. It's our
[32:50] light. It's our compass. It's our
[32:53] everything. It's our all in all, Lord.
[32:55] It's our typost. It's our direction,
[32:59] God. Where would we be without it? Where
[33:01] would we be without you revealing it to
[33:04] us, Lord, and helping us see and know in
[33:06] this word what there is there for us to
[33:08] see and know, God? Oh Lord, I pray that
[33:11] you would bless it today. God, may your
[33:13] hand be upon us and strengthen us and
[33:16] speak to us from it. Lord, we're in
[33:18] great need, great desire, Father, again
[33:21] of you to speak to us, Lord, and to
[33:23] reveal yourself to us, to show yourself
[33:26] real, God, once again, Jesus Christ, the
[33:29] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[33:31] Lord, bless those that have come today,
[33:33] God. May you keep your hand on them and
[33:35] strengthen them, Lord.
[33:37] God, just pray that you would take this
[33:39] vessel, Lord, and speak only what you'd
[33:41] have to be heard, Lord, in this place
[33:43] today. Lord, we're needful of your
[33:45] spirit. And pray that you would, Lord,
[33:47] let that word come forth in power and
[33:50] manifestation of your spirit that it'll
[33:52] not return void, but accomplish in each
[33:55] of us, Lord, that that you send it forth
[33:57] for. God, we just pray that you'd
[34:00] continue to strengthen those that
[34:01] weren't able to make it, Lord, those who
[34:03] may be streaming today. But all this
[34:06] Lord is given into your hands. Ask your
[34:08] blessings now upon the remaining part of
[34:10] it. Strengthen us now to the to the task
[34:13] at hand and uh anoint hear and hear and
[34:17] speaker both God that we receive this
[34:20] word according to your perfect will in
[34:22] the Holy Spirit brings it in Jesus
[34:24] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[34:28] Ephesians chapter 4 read a few verses
[34:31] here. Verse 11. And he gave some
[34:33] apostles and some prophets and some
[34:35] evangelists and some pastors and
[34:37] teachers for the perfecting of the
[34:39] saints, for the work of the ministry,
[34:42] for the edifying of the body of Christ,
[34:45] till we all come in the unity of the
[34:48] faith, and of the knowledge of the Son
[34:50] of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
[34:53] measure of the stature of the fullness
[34:56] of Christ, that henceforth we be no more
[34:59] children, tossed to and fro, and carried
[35:02] out with every wind of doctrine by the
[35:03] slight of men and cunning craftiness
[35:06] whereby they lie in weight to deceive.
[35:09] But speaking the truth in love may grow
[35:11] up into him and all things which is the
[35:14] head, even Christ, from whom the whole
[35:17] body fitly joined together, and
[35:19] compacted by that which every joint
[35:21] supplieth according to the effectual
[35:23] working in the measure of every part,
[35:26] maketh increase of the body unto the
[35:28] edifying of itself in love. And you can
[35:31] be seated if you'd like.
[35:34] Amen.
[35:37] So, as I said, we're continuing on with
[35:39] the five-fold ministry here. And uh
[35:42] we're just continuing on with the
[35:43] generalization of ministry as a whole.
[35:46] Haven't gotten into the individualities
[35:48] of each of these offices as the
[35:51] five-fold ministry affords us. Uh but
[35:53] just talking again in generalities of
[35:55] the ministry uh of of of those that God
[35:59] has called to minister in these five
[36:01] offices. Amen. And recognizing the
[36:04] purpose of that. Remember the three-fold
[36:06] purpose for perfecting the saints, work
[36:08] of the ministry, edifying of the body of
[36:10] Christ. Here we all come in faith and in
[36:13] knowledge of God to the statue of a
[36:15] perfect man. Going over to Peter as we
[36:17] read through that statue of a perfect
[36:19] man and be no more children tossed to
[36:21] and fro. We talk about the doctrine, the
[36:23] things that bring faith. Amen. And faith
[36:26] come by hearing, hearing the word of
[36:28] God. But it can't be just going to uh to
[36:32] listen. Now, anybody that speaks the
[36:34] pure word of God brings faith. Amen. But
[36:37] when that word gets mingled in with a
[36:39] man idea or gets hybrided by doctrines
[36:42] of man, then that does not bring faith.
[36:45] The purity of God's word brings faith.
[36:47] And the ministering of that word brings
[36:49] faith. Amen. And anytime that word is
[36:51] spoken, it brings faith. Praise the
[36:54] Lord. Then it brings faith to not be
[36:57] carried about with because remember
[36:58] we're supposed to be established in the
[37:00] faith to not be carried about with every
[37:02] wind of doctrine. Amen. Every
[37:04] disturbance of doctrine. Remember uh
[37:07] this disturbance denotes the fact that
[37:10] this doctrinal teaching is something
[37:12] that's against the word. And it doesn't
[37:15] have to be wholly totally against the
[37:17] word. It doesn't have to be Satanism. It
[37:19] doesn't have to be Buddhism. It just has
[37:21] to be 99% word,
[37:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Because the 1% is what uh corrupts it.
[37:28] Amen. The 1% is what throws it off from
[37:30] where it should have been to begin with,
[37:32] which is exactly as we said, the same
[37:34] thing that happened in the Garden of
[37:36] Eden. So this this wind of doctrine
[37:38] denotes a disturbance. The wind denotes
[37:41] disturbance. Well, it it it's not a
[37:44] disturbance when the pure gospel is
[37:46] preached because the gospel is good
[37:48] news. And the good news is good, not
[37:51] disturbing. It's good. It's true. It's
[37:53] real. It's pure. It's helpful. It's not
[37:56] disturbing. It doesn't bring about
[37:57] anger. It doesn't bring about confusion.
[38:00] It brings about truth and revelation.
[38:02] Amen. So, if there's a disturbance, it's
[38:05] by that doctrine that's been handled by
[38:08] man and not the purity of God's word.
[38:11] Amen. Which we recognize this five-fold
[38:14] ministry is God using men just like God
[38:18] does for every gift that we have. Just
[38:20] like the this whole subject of adoption,
[38:24] every gift, every placement is operated
[38:26] by God. It's not you. Amen. It's God
[38:29] doing it. If you speak in tongues or if
[38:31] you prophesy or if you have a gift of
[38:33] helps or what whatever it is position
[38:35] that God's put you in, God gives you the
[38:38] ability to continue with that and to
[38:40] live in that and he is the one operating
[38:43] that gift in you. So it's him not not
[38:46] it's not me. It's not you. It's him
[38:49] doing it. Praise the Lord. So if it's if
[38:51] it's pure doctrine, it's God doing it.
[38:54] Amen. which reminds you of our uh our uh
[38:58] precious brother Bob Warts who didn't
[38:59] get to mention last week uh because we
[39:02] uh weren't feeling well, didn't have
[39:04] service. But um as you all know, brother
[39:07] Bob WS passed away. I hope maybe you do
[39:09] know if you know brother Bobby, he was
[39:11] the one that facilitated the Harmony in
[39:13] the desert for all those years. Uh he
[39:16] was the one that foot the bills. He took
[39:17] care of everything and uh got the
[39:19] facilities. He was the one that was the
[39:22] was the brainchild of it. and uh
[39:24] originated it and you know they just
[39:27] ended harmony like a year or two ago and
[39:30] now brother Bobby's gone to be with the
[39:31] Lord. Amen. So please pray for his
[39:34] family and those that affected of course
[39:36] by his family. He was loved by many
[39:38] including me. Uh love brother Bob very
[39:41] much. He respected me highly not
[39:43] necessarily because of me but he loved
[39:45] his dad so much and his dad loved to
[39:48] hear me preach. I hate to say that out
[39:50] loud but it's true. Uh so brother Bob
[39:53] because of his dad had a great respect
[39:55] for me and of course his mom too sister
[39:57] in AD but anyway he's gone to be with
[39:59] the Lord but it just made me think right
[40:01] after that I thought well you know they
[40:04] just quit having harmony and brother
[40:06] Bobby passes away because harmony is not
[40:09] harmony without brother Bob.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then I thought and then the
[40:13] Lord then the Lord hit me. It was God
[40:16] using brother Bob to do this to
[40:19] facilitate this harmony. Right.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; And when that work was finished, when
[40:23] God was finished with brother Bobby, God
[40:25] took him home.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; I mean, how simple can it be?
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; How fulfilling can it be to recognize
[40:32] that when God's put you in a position,
[40:34] God's put you in a place and when that
[40:36] when the fulfillment of that is done,
[40:38] then it's time to go home. It God took
[40:41] him home. It's only been it's only been
[40:44] over a year or two, I think. I think
[40:46] they they may have even had a little
[40:48] short condensed one last year of some
[40:51] kind. I'm not exactly sure, but and but
[40:53] it just made me think, Brother Bob found
[40:55] his place. He got in that place. He
[40:58] lived that place the best he could. And
[41:01] when when that time was over, God took
[41:03] him home. I mean, that's the way I look
[41:05] at it. That's the way I see it. Amen.
[41:08] But that wasn't him doing that. See, it
[41:10] makes you think, well, Brother Bob was a
[41:12] very good businessman. He was a very
[41:14] shrewd, very uh uh uh I guess you'd say
[41:18] fairly wealthy businessman. He owned
[41:20] different companies, businesses, and
[41:22] stuff like that. And uh his dad did too.
[41:24] And uh he was he was fairly wellto-do as
[41:27] a result of that. And you always
[41:29] wondered, you know, well, you know, why
[41:31] why would why would he be in that
[41:33] position and not me, you know, but
[41:36] brother Bob wouldn't have been able to
[41:37] fulfill the purpose God put him here for
[41:39] in my opinion, at least one of them,
[41:42] right? if he had not been a successful
[41:45] businessman like that.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; God put him in the position he put him
[41:49] in. See, I'm trying to get us to
[41:50] understand because after this or we'll
[41:53] we'll see where this goes from here, but
[41:55] after this is where we start getting
[41:57] into each individual ministry. And
[42:00] brother Brandham talks about each
[42:02] individual ministry. Uh I think I got a
[42:04] quote. I might not get to it today, but
[42:06] uh where he talks about each individual
[42:08] ministry and he said and a question come
[42:11] to him and says, "How do we know where
[42:13] we belong in the body of Christ?" I
[42:15] paraphrasing that a little bit and he
[42:17] says, "Well, that's an excellent
[42:18] question. I'm sure everybody would like
[42:20] to know about that." He said, "First
[42:22] thing I do is look at the person." And
[42:25] going on in the in the quote, he's
[42:26] talking about if a person feels like
[42:28] they're uh a minister, he looks at their
[42:30] nature. Amen. He said, "If a person's
[42:33] real flighty and and and and all," he
[42:37] said, "But and he thinks he's a pastor,"
[42:39] he said, "A pastor is not flighty."
[42:41] Amen. A a pastor's settled is settled
[42:44] and and and strong and confirmed and
[42:47] stable, not flighty. See, like brother
[42:49] Brandham, Brother Brandham was flighty.
[42:52] Brother Brandham was always going.
[42:53] Brother God was always sending him going
[42:55] here, going there, want to be on the
[42:57] airplane, going overseas. Amen. So he he
[43:01] realized although he wanted to be a
[43:02] pastor and stay at home, which is the
[43:05] one thing that I guess got him, his wife
[43:07] and all his in trouble, he was going to
[43:09] stay at home and just be a pastor, but
[43:11] he didn't have the nature to be a
[43:13] pastor. So you see, my whole point in
[43:16] this is that God brings us from from who
[43:20] we are into where we should be. He
[43:23] equips us with what we need to be able
[43:25] to accomplish what he's put in our
[43:27] lives. And then so we can do what he
[43:30] sent us here for and what we've done it.
[43:32] And maybe when that time is over, then
[43:34] it's time to go home. Brother Ed Biscll
[43:37] just went, we've lost a lot of soldiers
[43:39] to the cross here the past couple years
[43:41] or so. Amen. But that work would be
[43:45] done. That work is done. And what's I've
[43:47] said many times, I love my family. I
[43:49] love the church. I love being here. I I
[43:52] love life. God's blessed me beyond
[43:54] measure. But, you know, when it comes
[43:56] right down to it, when God's done using
[43:58] me, when my purpose is complete, why why
[44:01] would I still be here?
[44:03] What's the point of my being hanging
[44:05] around?
[44:07] I mean, my
[44:09] I've said this before, but uh my wife
[44:12] even mentioned maybe it was yesterday
[44:14] about I've spent a lot of time my wife
[44:17] spent a lot of time in the past few
[44:19] years going to uh rest homes and
[44:22] hospitals and people were places where
[44:26] really elderly people more or less just
[44:30] lay around
[44:31] &gt;&gt; exist. They exist nothing more than
[44:34] existing.
[44:36] Their their major accomplishment on a
[44:39] daily basis is converting uh oxygen into
[44:43] carbon dioxide.
[44:45] That's it.
[44:47] And you think, why are they still here?
[44:50] The advancement of medicine, we keep
[44:52] people alive. Are we keeping people
[44:53] alive beyond the time when they really
[44:55] should have gone home? I I don't know.
[44:58] I'm not God. I'm not going to speculate.
[45:01] But sometimes it makes you wonder and I
[45:03] think well when when that time comes
[45:06] Lord you know when you're ready for me
[45:09] uh I'm ready. I I hope and pray that uh
[45:13] I we all go together in a rapture
[45:16] catching a wave any day now. I'm looking
[45:18] to fly away from here the body change
[45:21] and that would be wonderful. whatever
[45:23] way God describes for it. But God
[45:27] doesn't God doesn't give someone
[45:30] uh a calling in life without having that
[45:34] person with the right attitude or right
[45:37] nature and right position and equipped
[45:39] to do the job to be able to do the job.
[45:42] I personally may have had a tremendous
[45:45] desire I didn't a tremendous desire 20
[45:49] years ago to have harmony in the desert.
[45:52] I didn't. But I what if I would? I
[45:55] couldn't have done it.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; I could have asked people, "Would you
[45:59] would could you contribute? Could you
[46:01] contribute? Could you know?" But Brother
[46:03] Bobby didn't have to do that. He got it
[46:04] on his heart and he did it
[46:07] &gt;&gt; right.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; He paid the bills. Of course, God paid
[46:10] the bills because if God calls you to do
[46:12] it, God's going to pay the bills.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; God's going to take care of that. Don't
[46:15] worry about that. But he he equips the
[46:18] person first.
[46:20] He put him in the position to be able to
[46:22] do it. And when it was over, now he's
[46:24] gone to his reward. So, praise the Lord
[46:27] for that. Amen. So, we've got this
[46:30] five-fold ministry
[46:33] that is to bring and to preach the word,
[46:36] to edify, to build up, to bring the
[46:39] purity of the word, to get themselves
[46:41] completely out of the way and let God
[46:43] use them to bring that word in the
[46:46] position that God called them. See?
[46:49] Amen. Because it's God doing the
[46:50] calling. It's God operating the gift. If
[46:52] a person is truly yielded to God, you
[46:55] remember, you know, brother Bam said he
[46:56] only h actually only had one gift.
[47:00] You know, he said that he said, "I've
[47:02] only got one gift. That's to get myself
[47:04] completely out of the way and yield it
[47:06] to the Lord." That's it. That's the only
[47:07] gift he had. He said, "Oh my, the
[47:10] praying for the sick and the people that
[47:11] got healed and all these things that
[47:12] happened and the visions he had and the
[47:14] prophecies that went on." He said, "I
[47:15] had one gift. get myself out of the way.
[47:18] That's the greatest gift any of us can
[47:20] have
[47:21] &gt;&gt; to get ourselves completely out of the
[47:23] way and let God use us and let God speak
[47:26] through us whatever the situation
[47:28] whatever the calling is. That foul-fold
[47:30] ministry then is in that position to
[47:33] bring that pure word to bring a word
[47:35] that would that would edify and bless
[47:38] the bride of Jesus Christ so she's
[47:40] equipped with what she needs to be able
[47:42] to overcome the ws of the devil.
[47:46] the things of the world, the word of
[47:49] God, the purity of the word of God, to
[47:51] let that word go into each individual,
[47:53] to let that word find its vetting ground
[47:55] in our hearts and use us as his
[47:58] disciples, to use us as his vessels.
[48:01] Amen. That we can be the ones that are
[48:03] called of God. Now, I want to go over to
[48:04] second Timothy
[48:07] uh chapter 4, read a couple of verses of
[48:09] scripture here.
[48:15] Amen.
[48:17] Second Timothy chapter 4
[48:24] and we'll just start uh
[48:29] Amen.
[48:31] Excuse me. I want to go to second
[48:34] Timothy chapter. Let's do chapter 2
[48:36] first. Second Timothy chapter 2.
[48:41] Amen.
[48:43] Second Timothy chapter 2. We'll start
[48:44] with the Let's start with Let's start
[48:47] with the 12th verse.
[48:50] Amen. Second Timothy chapter 2 verse 12.
[48:53] If we suffer, we shall also reign with
[48:56] him.
[48:57] If we deny him, he also will deny us.
[49:02] If we believe not, yet he abideth
[49:05] faithful, he cannot deny himself. of
[49:08] these things, put them in remembrance,
[49:11] charging them before the Lord, that they
[49:13] strive not about words to no profit. You
[49:17] see that so much, saints, Amen. And
[49:21] people fight and strive and uh uh uh
[49:25] confliction just over words. Amen.
[49:30] To but it bring to no profit. See, but
[49:32] to the subverting of the hearer, that's
[49:35] the destruction.
[49:37] This entanglement of words and verbiage
[49:40] and uh and disagreements like that does
[49:45] does nothing but bring destruction to
[49:47] the hearer. That's why we only want to
[49:51] follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[49:54] and the ministering of his pure
[49:55] unadulterated word. That's what brings
[49:58] faith. That's what brings hope. That's
[50:00] what brings the edification, the
[50:02] building up. That's what equips us.
[50:04] That's where we get the knowledge. where
[50:06] we get the uh the the strength. Amen. To
[50:09] be able to overcome. You can't get it
[50:12] when there's confusion, when there's uh
[50:15] a battling about back and forth with
[50:17] words, with uh with things that are
[50:21] unedifying and and bring to a subverting
[50:24] of the hearer, a destruction of the
[50:26] hearer. That's we're not here as a
[50:29] ministry to bring destruction to
[50:31] hearers. We're we're here to bring faith
[50:34] and hope and and uplifting and building
[50:37] up and encouragement, a perfecting, a
[50:41] place to be able to reach that that uh
[50:44] that stature of a perfect man. Beginning
[50:47] with faith, the foundation of which is
[50:50] faith that builds us up to that point.
[50:53] We're supposed to do do the edifying,
[50:56] not the destroying.
[50:59] supposed to edify, to build up, and and
[51:03] if if it doesn't bring that, then what
[51:05] of what good is it? You get plenty of
[51:08] destructive thoughts, destructive words,
[51:11] destructive actions out in the world. We
[51:14] sure don't need it in churches. We sure
[51:17] don't need it amongst ministers. We sure
[51:19] don't need it amongst believers.
[51:22] We need truth and edification. Amen. And
[51:25] building up. So, we strive not up
[51:28] Strive not, Amen. about these words that
[51:32] are to no profit, to the subverting, the
[51:35] destruction of the hearer. Study,
[51:38] Amen. Again, we're talking about the the
[51:40] the generalization of the ministry
[51:43] itself. study to show thyself approved
[51:47] unto God,
[51:50] a workman that needeth not to be
[51:52] ashamed, rightly dividing the word of
[51:56] truth, rightly dividing. Amen. Now,
[51:59] there has to be a gift of some kind.
[52:02] There has to be a spirit of some kind, a
[52:05] Holy Spirit, a a godly spirit. There has
[52:08] to be God in there to be able to bring
[52:11] that gift to be able to rightly divide
[52:14] the word. If a if a man is a God- called
[52:18] man to carry the word of God, then God
[52:21] has equipped him with the gift to be
[52:24] able to rightly divide the word. But
[52:26] then there's encouragement that Peter
[52:29] has to Timothy telling him to to to
[52:32] study and show thyself approved uh unto
[52:36] God. a and be a workman that needeth not
[52:40] to be ashamed and to rightly divide the
[52:44] word. Now, rightly dividing, let's look
[52:47] what that says in the Greek. Rightly
[52:50] divide those those words come together
[52:54] to mean to cut straight.
[52:57] To rightly divide is to cut straight.
[53:00] That's not to pander or to uh uh cookie
[53:04] coat, sugarcoat,
[53:06] uh
[53:08] pat on the back. Is to cut that word
[53:11] straight.
[53:13] Amen. We We are a people of holiness.
[53:17] We live a life of holiness. We are a
[53:20] holy people unto the Lord. That's what
[53:23] the scripture says. Now I know what
[53:26] other churches do, what other
[53:27] denominations do, how they cut straight
[53:30] whatever they do. I know as
[53:33] responsibility of this tabernacle that
[53:35] God has instructed me to rightly divide
[53:38] that word and to cut straight.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; There's sin in the camp. It's time to
[53:44] get right. Amen. It's time to make it
[53:46] right. It's time to cut that word
[53:48] straight. To make those path straight.
[53:52] Amen. according to the word of God to
[53:55] teach the truth directly and correctly.
[53:59] That's not cut corners.
[54:01] That's not to to make it puffier better
[54:05] than it is. You got plenty of ministers
[54:07] out in the world today whose main
[54:09] ministry is how beautiful the grass is
[54:11] and how blue the sky is. I mean, that's
[54:13] just everything is just beautiful and
[54:15] great and you're all wonderful and
[54:17] everything's fine and you just keep on
[54:19] going and all is going to work out well
[54:21] and the sky is beautiful and you know
[54:24] God's prosperous and God blesses and you
[54:26] know it's it's it's all well and good
[54:29] you know and and that's that's all
[54:31] anybody ever gets if you listen to that
[54:34] kind of ministry. That's all you ever
[54:35] get. But what you need, what the bride
[54:40] needs is ministry that cuts that word
[54:43] straight,
[54:44] &gt;&gt; that preaches that word, preaches that
[54:46] truth directly and correctly
[54:49] &gt;&gt; that's to rightly divide. And the only
[54:51] way to do that is to have a gift. And
[54:53] friend, when you do that normally,
[54:56] you're going to have what you have here
[54:58] this morning, a handful. You're not
[55:00] normally going to have large groups of
[55:02] people that'll sit there and listen to a
[55:06] a word that's being cut straight,
[55:08] especially in these last days.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; In these last days where it's falling
[55:12] off left and right, one after the other,
[55:15] falling away from the pure word. They
[55:17] may not be leaving Christianity as a
[55:19] whole, but they're leaving the pure,
[55:21] unadulterated word and the message that
[55:23] we know to be the truth. When they leave
[55:26] that, then what have you got?
[55:28] You're not going to have large huge
[55:30] churches. Not normally. Amen. You might
[55:34] have a gathering or as brother Brandham
[55:36] called it, a lodge where people of like
[55:40] thought come together and they get up
[55:43] and say, "Well, it's Sunday morning and
[55:45] it's time to go to church." They go and
[55:46] sit there and they get up and they walk
[55:47] out and leave and go have their lunch
[55:49] and that's all it meant to them. You
[55:51] have plenty of people like that. Brother
[55:53] Brandham called them made believers and
[55:56] unbelievers,
[55:56] &gt;&gt; right? You do have a contingency of
[55:59] believers by the grace of God. Amen. And
[56:02] I'm thankful for God's believers, but
[56:04] that group is going to be the way far
[56:06] smaller group than the other two. I
[56:09] mean, you you could take them all and
[56:10] scrape them all together. Wouldn't even
[56:12] come close to either one of the other
[56:13] two categories of the make believe
[56:15] unbeliever. But when the word's being
[56:17] brought straight, rightly divided. Amen.
[56:21] To cut straight to teach the truth.
[56:24] Amen. People a lot of times aren't going
[56:26] to want to listen to it. They're not
[56:28] going to want to listen to how we're
[56:29] supposed to because we're we're holy
[56:31] people. How we're supposed to dress, how
[56:33] we're supposed to live, how we're
[56:34] supposed to talk, how we're supposed to
[56:35] conduct ourselves. Amen. How we're
[56:37] supposed to act, how and what way are we
[56:39] supposed to be as as children of God.
[56:42] And of course, in our humanity,
[56:44] I I fall I fall short of that mark a
[56:46] thousand times a day probably in our
[56:49] humanity. But that's that's the that's
[56:51] the goal. That's who we are. That's what
[56:53] we strive for. That's one in our heart
[56:55] we desire. We do something a little
[56:57] wrong that was and we realize it. God
[57:00] says,
[57:01] "I'm sorry, Lord. Amen. Didn't mean to
[57:04] act like that. I didn't mean to talk
[57:05] like that. We're a holy people. We live
[57:08] a holy love. We live a life of holiness
[57:11] unto the Lord." Amen. And it's supposed
[57:14] to be that way and come straight from
[57:15] the word to cut straight. And if it's
[57:18] out of line, then it needs to get back
[57:20] in line. When brother Bram saw that
[57:22] vision, the end of that line and was
[57:24] getting out of step, he woke up himself
[57:27] from the vision arise himself in the
[57:30] vision screaming, "Get back in line. Get
[57:32] back in line." Why? To write the divide
[57:36] to bring that word truth. He said, "I
[57:38] travel across." And brother, brother Ram
[57:40] was ready to quit.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. One time he did for a very short
[57:44] period of time because God told him
[57:45] said, "I didn't send you here to quit.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; You get back on that field." Amen. But
[57:49] anyway, he did quit for a short period
[57:51] of time. He said, "I travel back and
[57:53] cross across this nation." He said,
[57:54] "Every time I go across this city and
[57:56] this city, next time I come back, it's
[57:58] worse than it was when I was there the
[57:59] first time." Amen. Recognize it's going
[58:03] to be that way.
[58:05] Unfortunately, it's going to be that way
[58:08] because we are the end times. Amen.
[58:12] Broad is the gate. Many find that. But
[58:14] narrow narrow is the way to truth.
[58:18] narrow is the way to righteousness.
[58:20] Amen. And we must maintain and and keep
[58:23] ourselves holy and pure before the Lord.
[58:26] Amen. As God brings it and a minister of
[58:28] God is going to preach that word to
[58:30] bring that uh into play to understand.
[58:34] Now look, Paul starts talking about uh
[58:37] he starts actually naming names here.
[58:39] Now he says uh don't need don't be
[58:43] ashamed to rightly divide the word of
[58:45] truth. Amen.
[58:47] may run people off, but you rightly
[58:49] divide the truth. You preach that truth.
[58:51] Amen. Your reward will be in heaven.
[58:54] But now 16th verse, he said, "But shun
[58:56] profane and fain uh and vain babblings,
[59:00] for they will increase unto
[59:02] ungodliness." And we've not witnessed
[59:04] that. You see, as it starts and it gets
[59:06] worse, it gets worse. It gets worse.
[59:09] Amen. Um
[59:11] you you see I I can see even with the
[59:14] guys at work sometimes and they'll a
[59:16] little conversation seems somewhat
[59:18] innocent. But then the next one adds a
[59:21] little more to it and a little more to
[59:22] it and it just gets worse and worse.
[59:24] Amen. It just becomes vain babblings,
[59:27] ungodly verbiage. Amen. Profane vain
[59:31] babblings. For they will increase unto
[59:33] more ungodliness and their word. And
[59:36] that that also includes uh a hybridation
[59:39] of the word. Amen. A hybridation of the
[59:42] word is vain babings.
[59:44] If you bring a man's idea or a church's
[59:47] denomination's doctrine idea or
[59:49] something that's vain babblings and it
[59:51] leads to nothing more than just
[59:53] ungodliness.
[59:55] You see it out in the world today. So
[59:57] many people that think they're
[59:58] Christians
[1:00:00] uh that that that profess Christianity
[1:00:03] wear garments and stuff that that say
[1:00:06] they believe in Jesus and the third word
[1:00:09] out of their mouth is a cuss word.
[1:00:13] But they think they believe who they
[1:00:15] are. But all it does is lead to worse
[1:00:17] and worse and worse. You get into the
[1:00:19] Catholic Church and my goodness, people
[1:00:21] just think they can do whatever they
[1:00:22] want. It doesn't matter because they're
[1:00:24] going to do penance for them anyway and
[1:00:25] buy themselves out of purgatory and
[1:00:27] whatever whatever the denomination the
[1:00:30] priest does to bring them forth out of
[1:00:32] there. And I don't know how many times
[1:00:35] even in e even recently in the passing
[1:00:38] of Charlie Kirk, the assassination of
[1:00:40] Charlie Cook, I heard so many people
[1:00:42] talk about pray for Charlie Kirk. Pray
[1:00:44] for a man who's dead.
[1:00:47] Charlie Kirk has met his maker. He He He
[1:00:51] has He's finished his race. He's done.
[1:00:53] There's no There's no reason to pray for
[1:00:56] someone that's gone beyond. They're
[1:00:59] done. Their race is over. Their fate is
[1:01:02] sealed. Period. But there's a there's a
[1:01:06] there's an outlying belief out there and
[1:01:08] it comes from Catholicism that you know
[1:01:11] you pray for a soul that's gone on
[1:01:13] somehow your prayers will take them out
[1:01:15] of hell and put them into as they call
[1:01:17] the pearly gates you know make
[1:01:20] everything right. Your prayers will take
[1:01:21] them out of purgatory or wherever they
[1:01:23] are not even the scriptural word hell
[1:01:26] what and throw them right in before the
[1:01:28] pearly gates. First of all nobody goes
[1:01:30] to hell until after the white throne
[1:01:31] judgement. Great. Another thing they
[1:01:34] know they just don't understand.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. They don't get, don't believe. But
[1:01:39] what does it do? It just leads to more
[1:01:40] and more ungodliness, more and more lack
[1:01:44] of truth of God's word.
[1:01:49] Anyway, let's just continue on because
[1:01:53] brother Paul's he's getting ready to
[1:01:55] call names here. We we don't do that
[1:01:57] today, but he didn't hold back. He says,
[1:02:00] "But shun profane and vain battlings for
[1:02:03] they will increase under more
[1:02:04] godliness." And you see that even people
[1:02:06] who profane Christianity,
[1:02:09] godliness,
[1:02:11] ungodliness, and their word will eat as
[1:02:15] doth a canker of whom he says, Himenius
[1:02:20] and Felitus are two of the men who are
[1:02:24] doing this. He calls them by name. Amen.
[1:02:28] Now, of course, uh I I know when brother
[1:02:33] Brandham uh left Tucson and was
[1:02:38] headed back to Jeffersonville,
[1:02:41] he was going to preach the trail of the
[1:02:43] serpent. He tells it on tape. He's going
[1:02:45] to preach the trail of the serpent. He
[1:02:46] had the notes. He was going to call
[1:02:48] names. He never got to that place, but
[1:02:52] he said he was going to call names.
[1:02:55] Amen. Didn't get that chance. didn't do
[1:02:58] it. But Paul never shunned from it. He
[1:03:00] called two names right here. These these
[1:03:04] two men preach a word that is a canker
[1:03:07] to your soul that will kill you, that
[1:03:10] will destroy you, that will lead to
[1:03:12] ungodliness. Why? Who concerning the
[1:03:16] truth have erred saying that the
[1:03:18] resurrection is passed already and
[1:03:21] overthrow the faith of some. Do you see
[1:03:23] that repeating itself even today? I have
[1:03:26] met and know people that themselves say
[1:03:28] that we are living in the millennium.
[1:03:32] I say if this is the millennium, kill me
[1:03:34] now.
[1:03:37] Th this is the millennium then I have
[1:03:40] been sorely
[1:03:42] deceived and disappointed.
[1:03:45] There's nothing millennious like to this
[1:03:49] age according to the scripture. Nothing.
[1:03:53] The resurrection's passed already. And
[1:03:56] what they do, they take the word 20
[1:03:59] years ago and said it was like this.
[1:04:01] It's got to be now. It's got to be here.
[1:04:03] This has already happened. He's already
[1:04:05] come forth. And and when they do that 10
[1:04:08] years later, what do they say? Well, you
[1:04:11] said 10 years ago. It's kind of like,
[1:04:13] excuse me, but I don't mean to get
[1:04:14] political, but it's kind of like the
[1:04:16] climate change. You know, the earth was
[1:04:18] supposed to been over what, 20 years
[1:04:20] ago? 25 years, I think. Gore told us
[1:04:23] like 40 years ago that that the earth
[1:04:25] was only going to last 10 more years if
[1:04:27] we keep going the way we're going.
[1:04:28] People tell us 10 years ago, "Oh, this
[1:04:31] we're we're going to be we're going to
[1:04:33] be nothing in 10 years." But see, what
[1:04:35] do those people do when that 10 years is
[1:04:36] over? We're here and nothing's changed,
[1:04:38] right?
[1:04:42] Oh, well then they they they change what
[1:04:44] it went from global warming to climate
[1:04:46] change now. So that includes hot and
[1:04:48] cold. So it can be extreme. and they
[1:04:50] say, "Well, it hasn't been this way in a
[1:04:52] hundred years." So, what you're telling
[1:04:54] me is it has been this way before.
[1:04:57] This is not unprecedented. In other
[1:04:59] words, which they want to make you
[1:05:01] believe, which is the same thing these
[1:05:03] people do when they try to take the word
[1:05:06] and and make it into a man-made dogma.
[1:05:11] And and well, when that when that time
[1:05:14] is up, it's like this guy the other day.
[1:05:16] I don't know who it was, but well, the
[1:05:18] coming of the Lord is this day or this
[1:05:20] day. I said, well, first of all, if you
[1:05:22] have something that prophetically
[1:05:24] correct, you should know what day. You
[1:05:26] shouldn't guess.
[1:05:29] But what happens when those two days
[1:05:30] pass?
[1:05:32] You never heard you never hear anything
[1:05:33] else about it. That man should be
[1:05:36] brought before a true man of God in the
[1:05:38] church of the Lord and had that evil
[1:05:41] spirit prayed off of him because he's a
[1:05:42] devil.
[1:05:44] Because you don't speak in the name of
[1:05:46] the Lord a lie,
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; You speak in the name of the Lord, it
[1:05:49] better be God and it better be the truth
[1:05:51] or you're a devil and you need to have
[1:05:53] that evil spirit prayed off of you.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; But what happened after those days?
[1:05:59] Nothing happened. Amen. Nothing changed.
[1:06:03] He's still here. Bride's still here. I'm
[1:06:06] still here cuz I'm still here.
[1:06:09] So what happened? So they got to change
[1:06:11] to say, "Well, well now, uh, well, the
[1:06:14] resurrection had to already have
[1:06:16] happened.
[1:06:17] We we have to be living. This has got to
[1:06:19] be the millennium." Oh my,
[1:06:23] talk about a destruction to the hearer.
[1:06:27] But those people are out there. But the
[1:06:30] good part is the bride, she cannot be
[1:06:33] deceived. Oh, there'll be people follow
[1:06:35] that. Amen. But the bride cannot be
[1:06:38] deceived. And that's the good part
[1:06:41] because if we're bride and we belong to
[1:06:43] God's kingdom, then we cannot be
[1:06:45] deceived. No matter what of this comes
[1:06:48] up, no matter if we have and dare I'll
[1:06:50] say those himeniuses and felitas today
[1:06:54] that we have here in this country, in
[1:06:57] this world that do the same thing.
[1:07:01] I saw a video a couple years ago of a
[1:07:03] man overseas. He was out in front of a
[1:07:06] whole bunch of people preaching and
[1:07:07] talking about how we should be baptizing
[1:07:09] in the name of William Mary and
[1:07:11] Brandham.
[1:07:13] And I I forgot what it only got to. It's
[1:07:15] been a couple years ago. And he got and
[1:07:18] and
[1:07:20] he said something that was blasphemous
[1:07:23] and entered into
[1:07:25] being baptized in William Brandham again
[1:07:27] and God struck him dead right there. Saw
[1:07:30] it. Hit the ground as hard as he could
[1:07:33] hit. dead as a doornob.
[1:07:36] Something was coming out of his mouth. I
[1:07:37] don't know what it was, but the man, God
[1:07:40] struck him dead right there. Now, why he
[1:07:42] did him, not others, I don't know, but I
[1:07:46] I saw the video myself, and this was
[1:07:48] years ago. I I don't This was this was
[1:07:51] before AI became a popular thing or
[1:07:53] something that people talked about or
[1:07:55] used often. So, I don't believe it was
[1:07:58] some kind of deep fake that I saw. And
[1:08:00] but you understand God's going to
[1:08:02] protect his children. God's going to
[1:08:04] protect his word or whatever he's got to
[1:08:06] do, he'll do it. Amen. Now, he lets some
[1:08:08] that keep going. Paul didn't I guarantee
[1:08:12] you Paul didn't stop Himenius or Felitus
[1:08:15] from this. He didn't stop them. They
[1:08:17] kept on doing and bringing about their
[1:08:18] same dogma. Amen. But but Paul's warning
[1:08:23] them and letting the true bride know,
[1:08:25] these people are false. These people are
[1:08:28] liars. We bring the truth of God's word
[1:08:31] and we had the facts. We had the we had
[1:08:34] the evidence to back it up. Brother Bram
[1:08:37] did the same thing.
[1:08:40] He got challenged at one time in the
[1:08:41] meeting. The Lord showed him, "They're
[1:08:43] going to challenge you about baptism."
[1:08:45] He went in that meeting and they called
[1:08:47] him up. He says, "I know why we're all
[1:08:49] here."
[1:08:51] And he and another brother he had told
[1:08:52] the whole scenario about he said you
[1:08:55] listen to him because he told me exactly
[1:08:57] how this is going to be where we were
[1:08:59] going to be and how we were going to be
[1:09:00] sitting. He said you better listen to
[1:09:02] him. Brother Ram says now he took his
[1:09:04] Bible said now I want you to come and
[1:09:06] show me right now. Show me. Come up here
[1:09:08] and stand up. Show me where I'm wrong in
[1:09:11] the scripture. He said not a one of them
[1:09:13] come up there. He said after the meeting
[1:09:16] people came to him and talked about
[1:09:17] coming to the tabernacle and the Bram
[1:09:20] tabernacle and get baptized and
[1:09:21] everything and going to baptize their
[1:09:23] church. He said not a one of them showed
[1:09:24] up.
[1:09:27] Meal ticket
[1:09:29] compromise
[1:09:31] whatever the fact a true a true man of
[1:09:34] God minister of God will rightly divide
[1:09:36] that word and bring it straight. Amen.
[1:09:40] Not to overthrow the faith, but to bring
[1:09:42] faith, to increase faith, to encourage
[1:09:46] faith. Let me read this. I'm going to
[1:09:48] close here in just a minute.
[1:09:50] Amen.
[1:09:52] Let me read this. Israel and the church,
[1:09:58] but Jesus was here on earth, he was God.
[1:10:02] He was Emmanuel. God was in Christ
[1:10:05] reconciling the world to himself. He
[1:10:08] never used any of his great gifts. Now,
[1:10:10] look at this and think of this for just
[1:10:12] a moment. Help this encourage you to
[1:10:15] today because we'll probably have to
[1:10:17] finish this um week after next uh I'll
[1:10:21] announce in a few minutes, but I
[1:10:23] announced before you all probably
[1:10:24] remember brother Nel Johnson supposed to
[1:10:26] be with us next Sunday. So maybe the
[1:10:28] Sunday after that, the Lord willing. He
[1:10:31] said, but but now look at this. Let this
[1:10:32] encourage you. He said, "Now Jesus came,
[1:10:35] God incarnate." I just say it that way.
[1:10:37] He never used any of his great gifts.
[1:10:41] When he met Satan, he said, "It is
[1:10:45] written."
[1:10:47] Well, what what was that to do for us?
[1:10:51] That was to encourage us. That was to
[1:10:53] let us know, how do you defeat him? It
[1:10:56] is written. How do you defeat Satan? By
[1:10:59] the word.
[1:11:00] Amen. Not just not just Jesus when he
[1:11:04] was here, God incarnate.
[1:11:08] Amen.
[1:11:10] Who who am I looking at this morning?
[1:11:13] Once you understand that about yourself,
[1:11:15] don't let the devil defeat you be your
[1:11:17] by your shortcomings. You got to
[1:11:19] recognize if you're a bornag again
[1:11:21] Christian filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:11:23] you have God living in you.
[1:11:26] Not the same office as Jesus obviously,
[1:11:30] but you have God living in you, leading
[1:11:32] you, guiding you, showing you, helping
[1:11:34] you, shaping you. calling you to his
[1:11:37] word, calling you to this ministry, the
[1:11:40] the the adoption, whatever that is in
[1:11:42] your life. He's calling that to you to
[1:11:45] understand when the devil comes, how do
[1:11:48] we defeat him? The same way Jesus did.
[1:11:51] He didn't use some great power and cast
[1:11:54] him into a frog.
[1:11:56] When Satan came to him on Mount
[1:11:58] Temptation, he said, "Thou art to flee."
[1:12:01] No, he just said, "It is written.
[1:12:06] the same thing that we do, the same
[1:12:08] ammunition that we have that we use to
[1:12:12] defeat the devil. It's the same thing.
[1:12:15] Now, you got to it's got to come with
[1:12:17] the same authority. You got to know who
[1:12:19] you are. Jesus knew who he was. You need
[1:12:22] to know, we need to know who we are in
[1:12:25] Christ to be able to operate. This is
[1:12:27] the is it's the life behind the name
[1:12:31] that makes the devil the demon tremble.
[1:12:33] Amen. He said, "Now he just said, it is
[1:12:37] written,
[1:12:39] man shall not live by bread alone." It's
[1:12:41] written, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord
[1:12:43] thy God." He defeated him.
[1:12:47] That's it. Know the scripture. We must
[1:12:50] know the scripture, be able to use it.
[1:12:53] Now, Satan came on the third attempt and
[1:12:57] used the word
[1:12:59] to try to defeat Jesus with, but he
[1:13:02] didn't rightly divide the word.
[1:13:05] Satan didn't rightly divide the word. He
[1:13:07] didn't bring the word straight. He
[1:13:09] misused,
[1:13:11] misplaced the word that God had already
[1:13:13] given.
[1:13:15] So, when Jesus heard that, he corrected
[1:13:18] the error with the word.
[1:13:22] Amen. Not his knowledge, not his
[1:13:24] intellect, not his experience or what
[1:13:26] he's been through. No, with the word.
[1:13:28] That's why brother Bram said you must
[1:13:30] know the word.
[1:13:33] Otherwise, you can be defeated by when
[1:13:35] Satan came to Eve in the Garden of Eden.
[1:13:36] What did Satan come to Eve in the Garden
[1:13:38] of Eden with? The word. He just twisted
[1:13:41] one little thing. What did he come with
[1:13:43] to Jesus with? He didn't even twist one
[1:13:46] little thing when he came to Jesus with
[1:13:47] the word. He just misplaced it. He put
[1:13:51] it outside of the character God had
[1:13:53] spoke it in. You see so many times of
[1:13:55] that today. Amen. People taking out of
[1:13:58] character and uh whatever else and
[1:14:02] misrepresenting the Satan just
[1:14:04] misrepresented the word. He didn't
[1:14:06] rightly divide the word. And because he
[1:14:09] didn't, he brought the word in error.
[1:14:12] But notice when Jesus came back with
[1:14:14] him, he came back with the word to
[1:14:17] correct the word the to correct this the
[1:14:20] word that Satan had given the word.
[1:14:23] Jesus came and brought the word to place
[1:14:26] the word that Satan had brought back
[1:14:28] where it should be placed to rightly
[1:14:30] divide. Anybody can get up and talk
[1:14:33] about the word or read the scripture.
[1:14:36] But it takes a godgiven gift of God's
[1:14:39] word and his ministry and the Holy
[1:14:41] Spirit to rightly divide that word to
[1:14:44] bring that word in the truth and the
[1:14:46] power and the and the correctness that
[1:14:48] God gives. Now to be able to defeat the
[1:14:51] devil, the word you must know the word.
[1:14:55] You must become the word. You must speak
[1:14:57] the word rightfully dividing placing
[1:15:00] that word where it belongs. He said now
[1:15:02] Satan knows it too. Satan knows the word
[1:15:04] too.
[1:15:06] But you've got to know how to rightly
[1:15:08] divide the word of God. To know that is
[1:15:13] to be able to put that word in its
[1:15:14] proper context, proper place that God
[1:15:17] when that when that word comes forth,
[1:15:19] then God answers.
[1:15:22] God doesn't come forth with a cankered
[1:15:24] word or with a word that's been hybrided
[1:15:26] or a word that's been uh changed or
[1:15:29] misplaced or misrepresented.
[1:15:31] He comes when that pure word is spoken
[1:15:33] in the in the power and manifestation of
[1:15:36] his spirit. And that's what defeats the
[1:15:38] devil.
[1:15:40] Amen. You can say, "Get thee behind me,
[1:15:43] Satan, all you want." But if you're in
[1:15:45] the situation as that vagabond you was
[1:15:48] in the scripture, that devil doesn't
[1:15:49] have to move an inch.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; That devil jumped on that man and he ran
[1:15:56] out of that house wounded and naked.
[1:15:59] I come to you in the name of Jesus whom
[1:16:01] Paul preached. You mean you don't have
[1:16:03] your own Jesus? You've got to bring the
[1:16:05] one that Paul preached. You got to have
[1:16:08] your own.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; You got to have Jesus for yourself.
[1:16:11] You've got to have your own personal
[1:16:12] experience, your own personal
[1:16:13] revelation.
[1:16:15] Your own personal indwelling.
[1:16:17] When that's there, Satan must go. He has
[1:16:20] no choice. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's
[1:16:24] let that
[1:16:26] uh word to recognize the the rightly
[1:16:29] dividing of that word through the
[1:16:31] ministry bring us to that place. I got
[1:16:34] one more
[1:16:36] I want to get into next time. It's a
[1:16:38] little too much for what we have left
[1:16:40] today. So, Lord willing, we'll just uh
[1:16:42] pick up where we left off here. Um
[1:16:46] wi with the general
[1:16:48] u ministry itself. Amen. the the the
[1:16:53] ministry that God's give. Amen. So,
[1:16:55] let's stand if we could. We'll stop
[1:16:58] right there
[1:17:06] and recognize and the one last thing
[1:17:08] here
[1:17:11] I was hoping to make sure we all got
[1:17:13] especially through that last quote was
[1:17:16] to understand the gift that God's given
[1:17:18] you. Amen.
[1:17:21] Because we're
[1:17:23] truthfully by the scripture, we're all
[1:17:24] kings and priests. But to be able to
[1:17:26] rightly divide the word yourself. Amen.
[1:17:29] Ministry brings that rightly divided
[1:17:31] word to a congregation, to a group of
[1:17:33] people. But you must in your own life
[1:17:35] understand and be able to rightly divide
[1:17:38] that word. There's no man there's no man
[1:17:41] ever lived that's been able to preach
[1:17:42] this entire Bible.
[1:17:45] It's not possible. And all the revel
[1:17:47] brother I listen the other day. Brother
[1:17:49] Ram was on a subject and he and he read
[1:17:52] one sentence and he said, "Now see from
[1:17:54] that one sentence he said a minister
[1:17:56] would go every single night and barely
[1:17:58] even touch that one subject every night
[1:18:01] for a month and barely touch from that
[1:18:03] one sentence. You think a man could take
[1:18:06] the entire scripture in a lifetime? Not
[1:18:08] possible.
[1:18:09] But it is possible for you to take the
[1:18:11] word and for you to read it and for you
[1:18:13] to ingest it and for you to for it
[1:18:15] become a revelation to your heart and to
[1:18:16] your life."
[1:18:18] Amen. And for you to be able to rightly
[1:18:21] divide that. Amen. Some places you get
[1:18:24] you maybe not quite understand. That's
[1:18:26] okay. God never said it or stand it. He
[1:18:28] said, "Believe it. Put it on the shelf.
[1:18:31] Set it aside. Don't Don't stress over
[1:18:33] it. Set it aside. God will reveal it to
[1:18:36] you. When it comes your time to know it,
[1:18:38] God will reveal it to you. God will show
[1:18:41] it to you. Help you understand. Amen.
[1:18:44] Because that's the kind of God he is.
[1:18:45] And if not, we'll know better more on
[1:18:47] the other side. Praise the Lord. Where
[1:18:49] it does matter the most. Amen. Praise
[1:18:53] the Lord Jesus. Let's sing this course
[1:18:55] again before we go. Amen.
[1:18:59] Just any day now. I really like this
[1:19:02] song. I think it has great words and
[1:19:03] melody to it.
[1:19:06] It's easy to sing and it's a beautiful
[1:19:08] song. Let's just sing just the chorus
[1:19:10] part. Amen. Before we go now,
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; just any day now,
[1:19:17] our Lord is coming.
[1:19:22] He'll be returning
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:26] for you and me.
[1:19:31] For I've been watching
[1:19:35] and I've been waiting
[1:19:40] just any day now.
[1:19:44] His face I'll see. Oh hallelujah again.
[1:19:47] Now just any day now
[1:19:53] our Lord is coming.
[1:19:57] He'll be returning
[1:20:02] for you and me.
[1:20:06] For I've been watching
[1:20:11] and I've been waiting.
[1:20:14] [Music]
[1:20:15] Just any day now,
[1:20:20] his face I'll see. Oh, can we sing it
[1:20:22] one more time to him now? Just any day
[1:20:27] now
[1:20:28] our Lord is coming.
[1:20:33] He'll be returning
[1:20:37] for you and me.
[1:20:41] Oh, I've been watching
[1:20:46] and I've been waiting
[1:20:49] [Music]
[1:20:50] just any day now
[1:20:55] his face I'll see.
[1:20:58] [Music]
[1:20:59] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:02] I believe that saints.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; I believe just any day now the Lord's
[1:21:07] coming to take us home to be with him.
[1:21:09] Praise the Lord. Oh, what a wonderful
[1:21:12] time it'll be. So shall we ever be with
[1:21:16] the Lord. I just have never felt
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; such a pull. Like I just like I pull
[1:21:20] almost every day
[1:21:23] a pull on me. It it just it just keeps
[1:21:26] coming back and keeps reverberating in
[1:21:28] my spirit all the time. It just can't be
[1:21:30] much longer. Amen. However much time,
[1:21:34] let's just stay straight with the Lord.
[1:21:36] Amen. Let God continue to speak to us.
[1:21:40] his word continue to mold us and make us
[1:21:43] how he'd have us to be. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:46] Amen. God richly bless you. Uh apologize
[1:21:49] for the early service today again. Um my
[1:21:52] flight leaves at before 1:00. So um but
[1:21:56] I'm going to Michigan this week. So
[1:21:59] appreciate your prayers for that. The
[1:22:00] flight Lord would just bless that. Amen.
[1:22:05] Uh remember next week, brother N.

[1:22:10] night. Him and sister Shirley are in
[1:22:12] town. Uh they're staying with his
[1:22:14] brother L and sister-in-law Heather
[1:22:19] across the street over here. Actually,
[1:22:20] they just live right here on Jenn
[1:22:21] Mattis. But anyway, they're in town
[1:22:24] supposed to be with us next Sunday. So,
[1:22:25] I hope everybody's able to is able uh
[1:22:28] can be with us next week. So, please and
[1:22:32] be in prayer for that as well.
[1:22:35] Just trust that the Lord has something

[1:22:39] need. Amen. That speaks to us. So God
[1:22:43] richly bless you today. We'll be
[1:22:45] dismissed in prayer. Please continue.
[1:22:47] Remember all the other prayer requests.
[1:22:49] Amen. People not with us being able to
[1:22:51] be with us today. So
[1:22:54] anyone else have anything before?
[1:23:17] Yes. Praise the Lord. Absolutely.
[1:23:24] Anybody else? If you didn't hear, Sister

[1:23:30] her hours at work and

[1:24:51] Christ's name.
