[35:18] to be done we'll thank you and praise
[35:20] you for all things in jesus christ's
[35:22] name amen amen
[35:25] amen
[35:27] saint uh or saint romans we're going to
[35:30] read from
[35:31] amen romans let's see if we get this
[35:35] what would you start with verse 1 amen
[35:37] roman romans chapter 14 verse 1 him that
[35:40] is weak in the faith receive ye
[35:43] but not to doubtful disputations for one
[35:46] believeth that he may eat all things
[35:48] another who is weak eateth herbs
[35:51] let not him that edith despise him that
[35:54] eateth not
[35:55] and let him and let not him which eateth
[35:58] not judge him that eateth
[36:00] him that eateth for god hath received
[36:03] him
[36:04] who art thou that judges another man's
[36:06] servant
[36:08] to his own master he standeth her
[36:10] falleth
[36:11] yea he has he shall be hold it up for
[36:14] god is able to make him stand
[36:17] one man esteem one day above another
[36:20] another esteem every day alike let every
[36:23] man be fully persuaded in his own mind
[36:26] he that regardeth the day regardeth it
[36:28] unto the lord and he that regardeth not
[36:31] the day to the lord he doth not regard
[36:34] it
[36:35] he that eateth eateth to the lord for he
[36:37] giveth god thanks and he that eateth not
[36:40] to the lord he doeth not and giveth god
[36:43] thanks
[36:44] for none of us liveth to ourselves and
[36:47] no man diet to himself
[36:50] for whether we live we live unto the
[36:52] lord whether we die we die unto the lord
[36:56] whether we live there for or die we are
[36:58] the lords
[37:00] for to this end christ both died and
[37:03] rose and revived that he might be lord
[37:05] both of the dead and living amen you
[37:09] could be seated if you'd like
[37:12] we'll end that there that's quite a
[37:17] unusual
[37:18] writing
[37:20] but
[37:21] the point's very clear uh if you're used
[37:24] to reading
[37:26] uh
[37:26] the english vernacular it's uh when um
[37:30] and and i don't know what all the
[37:32] terminology of the adjectives and
[37:35] adverbs and all
[37:38] i don't know what all that means for or
[37:40] which ones which is the sum i can get
[37:43] but you know when they start putting
[37:45] certain things out of order it gets a
[37:47] little complicated to read but the point
[37:50] is very clear amen and jesus through
[37:53] paul of course paul speaking to the
[37:55] roman church is saying that him that
[37:57] eateth uh him that
[38:00] him that is weak
[38:01] in the faith receive you but not to
[38:04] doubtful disputations in other words
[38:06] that means hypocritically right not not
[38:09] saying okay i receive you but
[38:12] uh and there's always the butts people
[38:14] have the butts and people say well
[38:17] you know i like you i accept you
[38:19] but uh i i don't think uh you know
[38:23] you're gonna make it welcome to our
[38:25] church but i don't think you're gonna
[38:26] last very long
[38:30] that's exactly what jesus is telling
[38:32] them not to do
[38:33] and uh i i want to i want to talk about
[38:38] um
[38:39] as unto the lord amen uh because that's
[38:42] i believe what this was all about this
[38:44] little section of scripture reading is
[38:46] all about as as unto the lord what we do
[38:49] we do is unto the lord amen whether you
[38:51] regard the day you regard it unto the
[38:53] lord if you don't regard the day you
[38:55] don't regard the day unto the lord if
[38:58] you eat herbs you you give god thanks if
[39:00] you don't you give god thanks whatever
[39:02] it is that you do you do unto the lord
[39:05] amen and that's the whole point is is
[39:07] what we do
[39:08] we do unto the lord and if we do it unto
[39:11] the lord we're gonna we're gonna do it
[39:14] with an open heart and with an open mind
[39:16] with an open spirit
[39:17] you know the anointing of the day or one
[39:19] of the anointings of the day is is that
[39:22] people are so quick to condemn someone
[39:24] just because they don't think like me
[39:27] or just because they don't think like
[39:28] you
[39:29] uh now
[39:30] that that's one thing out in the world
[39:32] because that spirit is out in the world
[39:34] but friend we can't let that spirit of
[39:36] the world get on to us
[39:38] get on to the christian get onto the uh
[39:41] uh the the godly level-headed thinking
[39:44] people to understand that you could have
[39:47] just as good a valid opinion as i could
[39:50] in fact i could be absolutely 100 wrong
[39:53] you can be 100 right but i can be so
[39:57] stubborn about it that i'm not not even
[39:59] willing to listen to you
[40:00] and see that's that's one of the
[40:02] anointings that's going on in the world
[40:04] today uh
[40:05] your opinion doesn't matter if it's not
[40:08] like
[40:08] mine that that's that's the way the
[40:11] world and especially this country anyway
[40:14] is going if you don't if you don't think
[40:16] about it the way i do you're wrong if
[40:19] you don't say it the way i do you're
[40:21] wrong if you don't sing that song the
[40:23] way i sing it you're wrong
[40:25] and that's not the way it's supposed
[40:26] that's not the christian attitude if we
[40:29] do it as unto the lord we worship we
[40:32] praise we accept it as a lord right and
[40:35] that's what the that's what paul is
[40:38] telling them here see one might be weak
[40:40] in faith well they they if they're weak
[40:43] in faith pray for them don't put them
[40:46] down right no don't don't make fun of
[40:48] them don't talk about them don't say
[40:50] well they're never going to amount to
[40:52] anything oh they're never going to make
[40:53] it all they're never gonna no uphold
[40:56] that person encourage them don't receive
[40:59] them hypocritically
[41:01] don't receive them and say oh i i
[41:04] received you but receive them as unto
[41:07] the lord how would jesus receive them
[41:09] right well when he receives them he
[41:12] dotted calvary to receive them so if he
[41:14] gave his life to receive them then what
[41:17] should we do
[41:18] that's why paul said we do it but we
[41:20] don't do it with all of our heart
[41:22] we don't do it with all of our with all
[41:25] of our mind with all of our soul we
[41:26] don't give everything to it and if
[41:29] whatever we do
[41:30] everything we do we should do is unto
[41:33] the lord everything we should do we
[41:35] should give a hundred percent of what we
[41:37] do no matter what it is amen i i said
[41:41] here a couple of weeks ago i i mentioned
[41:44] because it just came on my heart and uh
[41:47] it was something i guess that the lord
[41:49] wanted to say then but
[41:51] uh for a subject for tonight but i
[41:55] mentioned one time i said every time you
[41:57] sisters cook a meal for your husband
[41:59] you're not cooking that for your husband
[42:01] you're cooking it for god
[42:04] every time i said every time
[42:06] the blade of that shovel hits the dirt
[42:08] when i have to dig a ditch i'm doing it
[42:09] listen to god
[42:11] i'm not doing it to get paid although i
[42:14] am i'm not doing it to get the job done
[42:17] although i am i'm doing it as unto the
[42:20] lord every roof i climb on every house i
[42:22] get under every pinch every blister
[42:26] every cut every zap
[42:29] electricity i get is unto the lord
[42:33] every meal you cook everything you do
[42:36] every speck of dust you wipe up you do
[42:38] it as unto the lord
[42:41] amen
[42:42] that's the way it should be everything
[42:44] we do we give a hundred percent
[42:47] so many times we think oh i'm not gonna
[42:49] do that or i'm not gonna do that for
[42:51] them or i'm not you know friend
[42:54] when does it come to the time where
[42:57] where
[42:58] that that decision process that god
[43:01] gives us
[43:02] excludes so many things in people
[43:06] i i just don't understand it
[43:09] you know i i was thinking the other day
[43:11] was um
[43:13] we were doing a job and and i think when
[43:16] when i when i go to a person's house i
[43:18] treat that person's house like that's
[43:21] god's house
[43:22] that's how i would want them to treat my
[43:25] house right true
[43:26] i and i treat it i look at it as that's
[43:29] that's god's house that he gave me an
[43:31] opportunity to work on
[43:33] this this is this is god's possession
[43:37] and that's why i try to treat things
[43:39] that way
[43:40] i know that's lost today but the fact of
[43:43] living for christ is lost today on most
[43:46] people
[43:47] and so
[43:48] a lot of that gets lost but that
[43:50] anointing comes in and tries to
[43:52] infiltrate in us right and we try to get
[43:54] by with just doing a little here a
[43:56] little there or giving fifty percent
[43:59] giving a seventy percent friend
[44:00] everything we should do we should do is
[44:02] unto the lord whatever it is
[44:05] every load of laundry that you that you
[44:08] do
[44:08] every time you hit a computer button
[44:11] every time you get in your car and drive
[44:13] every time that you
[44:15] you you give it you give it as unto the
[44:18] lord that's why we we pray for our food
[44:21] we thank god we give god thanks for what
[44:23] we're about to eat
[44:25] and that's why we we do it because it's
[44:28] unto the lord
[44:29] everything we do we regard to the lord
[44:33] everything
[44:34] it doesn't matter what it is
[44:36] we do it as unto the lord because that
[44:38] is our life
[44:40] the world doesn't they don't care
[44:42] and
[44:43] and you can see now by the way things
[44:46] are that
[44:48] you you try to you try to believe and
[44:50] think of the world and and and this
[44:53] country is as
[44:54] being
[44:56] a a good foundation fundamentally sound
[45:00] morally uh uh
[45:02] uh
[45:03] standard people
[45:05] you know if there's a job to be done
[45:07] they're gonna do it
[45:08] that was 80 years ago
[45:11] that was 50 years ago right it just
[45:14] doesn't
[45:15] seem to be the way it is anymore
[45:17] unfortunately right
[45:19] people just don't care
[45:21] but that anointing can't come on to the
[45:23] christian that anointing can't come on
[45:26] to us
[45:27] that anointing can't overtake us to
[45:29] where we think oh my
[45:31] i gotta i gotta do this again
[45:33] i gotta give this again i gotta be over
[45:36] here again i gotta do this again you do
[45:39] it as unto the lord if god's leading you
[45:41] especially
[45:42] do it as unto the lord
[45:44] amen we give us unto the lord
[45:47] we give what gets put in tithes
[45:50] offerings uh
[45:52] what we give ministers and
[45:54] mission field and and what we give we
[45:57] give it is unto the
[45:58] lord every penny that goes in that box
[46:02] you're not giving it to me right you
[46:04] give it us to the lord right when i do
[46:06] it i give it to the lord right amen
[46:10] because that's what we're supposed to do
[46:13] when we write the check at the end of
[46:15] the month to pay rent for this place i
[46:17] do it as unto the lord amen
[46:20] because that's what we're that's what
[46:22] we're supposed to do
[46:24] amen
[46:25] everything we do and god will bless you
[46:28] for that right god will multiply you for
[46:31] that
[46:32] god will increase you
[46:34] mightily
[46:36] if we do it in faith
[46:38] people sometimes give us you know i'll
[46:39] not kick a little
[46:43] you know
[46:46] stretch that dollar so thin that
[46:49] by the time you've done george
[46:50] washington's ball is an eagle
[46:53] shaped every speck of hair on his head
[46:57] god loves the cheerful gifts
[46:59] and that doesn't just mean monetarily
[47:01] right that's that means in everything
[47:02] you do yes and everything you do you do
[47:04] it as unto the lord if you do something
[47:06] you can do it to the as unto the lord
[47:08] that's why we do it look he said
[47:12] paul said here
[47:14] he said
[47:18] seventh verse none of us liveth to
[47:21] ourselves
[47:22] and no man diet to us to himself
[47:25] we don't live to ourselves and who are
[47:27] we living for
[47:31] yeah a lot of people living for
[47:32] themselves the selfishness of the world
[47:35] a lot of people may be living for
[47:37] somebody else some people may be living
[47:40] for a church or a minister or
[47:42] an organization of some kind some people
[47:45] may be living for this sports event or
[47:47] this sporting
[47:48] team or or some they'll paint themselves
[47:51] all up and they'll shave their heads and
[47:52] they'll turn purple and yellow just to
[47:54] go to try to because they live for that
[47:56] that's what they live for right
[47:59] but if we're christians we live unto the
[48:03] lord that's the only reason we live
[48:05] the only purpose for our lives is that
[48:08] we do it for the lord i'm alive because
[48:11] i'm alive to him only reason amen
[48:15] we die we die to uh we don't die to
[48:17] ourselves
[48:19] who dies unto the lord that's that's why
[48:21] we expect to go see him when we're done
[48:25] for whether we live we live unto the
[48:27] lord whether we die we die unto the lord
[48:29] whether we live therefore or die we are
[48:31] the lord amen
[48:33] for to this end christ both died and
[48:36] rose and revived that he might be lord
[48:38] both of the dead and of the living
[48:41] amen
[48:43] what we do
[48:44] that's why we do it we do it as unto the
[48:46] lord now let's go over to acts chapter
[48:48] 5.
[48:51] amen acts chapter 5
[49:00] i know it's a strain a lot of people
[49:02] don't have that attitude
[49:04] a lot of people around you don't feel
[49:05] the same way or act the same way
[49:07] they get by in their jobs as little as
[49:09] they can
[49:11] i mean as long as they can get that
[49:12] paycheck from week to week they just get
[49:14] by as little as they can possibly get by
[49:16] they used to be in the corporate world
[49:17] i've seen many of them amen get by as
[49:20] little as they can one time we were up
[49:22] and i think i told you maybe we were uh
[49:24] doing that big job up in oracle and
[49:26] trying to put the electric underground
[49:29] for this big rv park and we were gonna
[49:32] dig this big long ditch 30 30 inches
[49:36] deep 150 feet long
[49:39] so brother roger was getting some help
[49:41] he went to a labor
[49:43] a day place
[49:45] one guy he put the shovel to the dirt
[49:47] and he was digging the other guy he got
[49:50] the manic and he hit a few things and
[49:52] he'd just stand there and he'd hit a
[49:54] couple and he'd just stand there and
[49:56] then pretty soon uh i got over to where
[49:59] i was shoveling uh
[50:01] shoveling out the ditch and and he just
[50:03] and he's standing there talking
[50:06] the next 30 minutes all he did is talk
[50:09] just trying to get away with standing
[50:11] there and doing nothing but still get
[50:13] paid right right and he did about an
[50:16] hour's work maybe and that's generous
[50:19] and going and and roger just told him
[50:21] look if you're not gonna work leave wow
[50:24] so steve buffles
[50:25] uh who was there and kind of helping
[50:28] supervise uh brother rogers said go
[50:30] ahead and take him back so they went
[50:32] back and the guy was expecting to get
[50:34] paid for the day
[50:37] he wasn't even there but two hours and
[50:39] probably didn't do 30 minutes work tops
[50:42] right
[50:42] but he wanted to get paid for the day
[50:46] oh my i think brother roger finally paid
[50:48] him two hours told the people
[50:50] took it back said he was worthless i
[50:52] think he finally agreed to pay him two
[50:54] hours he wanted to pay for the whole day
[50:56] he did nothing
[50:58] he wanted to get paid for doing nothing
[51:01] and it seems like unfortunately that's
[51:03] kind of the way it is brother john you
[51:05] have a hard time finding good health
[51:06] absolutely amen brother rogers tried to
[51:08] find some good health before and uh
[51:10] unfortunately you had to settle with me
[51:12] and i don't know how good that is but uh
[51:14] i guess we do all right but it's hard to
[51:16] find somebody willing to work
[51:18] are they willing to do a job somebody
[51:20] willing to do a job right right because
[51:23] they have negated the very fundamental
[51:26] foundation that holds it all together
[51:29] and that's christ
[51:31] if you don't have christ as your
[51:33] substance and your point and your
[51:35] foundation
[51:36] then none of it matters none of it
[51:38] amounts to anything if you're living to
[51:41] yourself
[51:43] then you have nothing amen you will die
[51:46] to yourself
[51:48] but if you do it as unto the lord
[51:51] then you'll have him
[51:53] and he will give you the strength and he
[51:54] will bless you to do it god's not going
[51:56] to cause you to do something that you
[51:58] are incapable of doing right although
[52:00] sometimes i feel that but but he's not
[52:02] going to do that right
[52:04] he would when when god puts something
[52:06] for you to do he's going to allow you to
[52:08] have the ability to be able to do it
[52:10] amen
[52:11] acts chapter 5 now
[52:14] verse 33.
[52:18] amen now they captured uh
[52:20] peter and some of the disciples
[52:23] and they were gonna stone them even
[52:25] talked about putting them to death going
[52:27] to kill them
[52:29] and verse
[52:30] 33
[52:32] after peter witnessed
[52:35] when they heard that
[52:37] they were cut to the heart and took
[52:39] counsel to slay them
[52:42] but look at this now
[52:44] then stood there up one in the council a
[52:48] pharisee named gamaliel
[52:51] a doctor of the law had a reputation
[52:53] among all the people commanded to put
[52:56] the apostles forth a little space
[52:59] and said unto them
[53:01] ye men of israel know whereas he took
[53:03] peter and them and set them aside and
[53:05] started to speak to those that were that
[53:08] were supposed to be the religious
[53:09] leaders the men that were supposed to be
[53:12] in charge
[53:14] of religiously spiritually supposed to
[53:17] be in charge
[53:18] gamalia started speaking to him his is a
[53:20] doctor of law
[53:24] but he had enough sense to know
[53:26] how to discern right right and how to
[53:29] understand
[53:30] and so he put peter the messiah when he
[53:33] saw that they were about to kill him he
[53:35] put him aside and said wait a minute
[53:37] brothers
[53:38] let's hold a second here
[53:40] he said unto them ye men of israel take
[53:43] heed to yourselves what ye intend to do
[53:45] as touching these men right
[53:49] for before these days rose up
[53:52] uh theaters
[53:53] boasting himself to be somebody
[53:56] to whom a number of men about 400 400
[54:00] men joined themselves unto he
[54:03] uh joined themselves
[54:05] who was slain
[54:06] this man got killed
[54:09] and all as many as obeyed him were
[54:11] scattered and brought to nothing 400
[54:14] followed this
[54:15] person
[54:16] amen and what happened it came to
[54:19] nothing
[54:20] why because he was living unto himself
[54:24] he was not living as unto the lord he
[54:25] was living as unto himself so the work
[54:28] came to nothing
[54:31] after this man rose up judas of galilee
[54:34] in the days of the taxing
[54:36] and drew away much people after him
[54:39] he also perished and all even as many as
[54:42] obeyed him were dispersed
[54:45] and now i say unto you refrain from
[54:48] these men let them alone
[54:51] for if this council or this work be of
[54:54] men it will come to knock
[54:58] if it's a man it'll come to nothing it
[55:01] means nothing there's no point to it
[55:04] well
[55:05] so and so is that there's there's a
[55:08] church full of people
[55:10] but if it's not of god it'll come to
[55:11] nothing
[55:12] now today now there was a time
[55:15] scripturally
[55:17] where those people
[55:19] met their demise
[55:20] because that's the day that they lived
[55:22] amen they met a
[55:25] demise
[55:27] mostly now this day is not so much
[55:30] because this is the very deceptive age
[55:32] of laodicea and we know that and the
[55:35] deception is going to be great the
[55:37] demise today isn't so much a physical
[55:40] demise as much as it is a spiritual
[55:43] demise yes
[55:44] the good part about this would be so
[55:47] close to see the very elective possible
[55:49] the good thing about this is that only
[55:52] the elect will know what is right in god
[55:55] and what is wrong and of man right
[55:59] the elect will know
[56:01] the holy ghost field person will know
[56:04] god's children will know
[56:07] and it will come to nothing
[56:09] now they may have some great big work
[56:12] going on it may be a church
[56:15] full of people there may be thousands of
[56:17] them following that but what's it gonna
[56:19] come to if it's of a man
[56:22] it's gonna come to nothing are thousands
[56:24] gonna follow it oh sure it might be
[56:27] thousands might be tens of thousands
[56:29] follow it but it will still come to
[56:30] nothing not spiritually
[56:33] amen there would be spiritual death once
[56:36] it was physical death now it's a
[56:38] spiritual death once when it came to
[56:40] nothing it was because of their demise
[56:42] today it's a spiritual death and they
[56:45] are a lot they're dead while they're
[56:47] getting living right right they don't
[56:50] know it
[56:51] amen
[56:53] people so many times
[56:55] people today are fighting and resisting
[56:58] against god and they don't even realize
[57:02] it
[57:02] right
[57:03] fighting against god resisting the very
[57:06] move of god and they don't even realize
[57:10] how many
[57:14] you've recognized what god is doing and
[57:16] seeing the work of god in the hand the
[57:19] the hand of god in the situation and
[57:21] recognize god is moving with that people
[57:25] god is moving with that with that
[57:27] congregation or that uh move or whatever
[57:30] it is right and if god's
[57:35] not necessarily monetarily oh they they
[57:39] they
[57:42] you can't count monetary i mean
[57:44] they got buildings that are just built
[57:46] of gold
[57:48] and treasures and everything else it's
[57:50] not that
[57:51] there's plate there's churches that have
[57:53] converted
[57:55] basketball stadiums into churches
[57:58] filling them up two and three a week
[58:01] amen
[58:04] but is it of god right
[58:07] i didn't say it wasn't right
[58:09] but the question is is it of god
[58:12] because if it's not a god it'll come to
[58:14] nothing
[58:15] if it if it is of god amen now look what
[58:18] gamalia said now
[58:20] if it's if it's not of god refrain from
[58:22] these men
[58:24] let them alone for if this council or
[58:27] this work be of men it will come to not
[58:31] but
[58:33] amen there we go but if it is of god
[58:37] no matter if the person
[58:39] eats herbs
[58:40] amen i said
[58:43] paul said that may be weak in faith if
[58:46] they eat herbs but don't don't discount
[58:48] that person
[58:50] don't dismiss that person
[58:53] hold that person up encourage them give
[58:56] them a good word of encouragement
[58:58] positive and uplift them
[59:01] pray for
[59:02] them see if god might move in their life
[59:06] amen
[59:08] because if the work is of god ye cannot
[59:12] praise the lord
[59:14] you cannot overthrow it
[59:17] lest happily ye be found even to fight
[59:20] against god
[59:23] fighting against god
[59:25] so many people it seems that they are
[59:27] fighting against god
[59:29] resisting god
[59:31] coming against god and don't even
[59:33] realize it
[59:35] they think and and the bible says they
[59:37] would kill you
[59:40] thinking they're doing god a favor right
[59:42] amen and we thought that was going to be
[59:44] from out in the world seems like it's
[59:46] going to be right here in the ranks yeah
[59:48] that they're killing you now how can
[59:51] they kill you not just with a gun knife
[59:53] or drain all the blood out of your body
[59:56] by character assassination yeah they'll
[59:59] kill you by character assassination
[1:00:02] they'll talk about you or put you down
[1:00:04] or put you in a position where others
[1:00:07] will look down on you the word people
[1:00:09] won't have respect for you or listen to
[1:00:12] you or or even give you voice anymore
[1:00:14] right
[1:00:16] my mind and if they do is to doubtful
[1:00:19] disputations
[1:00:21] oh i've got to be friendly to them
[1:00:24] i have got to say hello what kind of
[1:00:26] christian would i be if i didn't say
[1:00:28] hello to them oh that's all fine and
[1:00:31] danny but that's doubtful disputations
[1:00:33] friend
[1:00:36] that's not the way a christian does it
[1:00:38] a christian from their heart
[1:00:40] loves to see another christian yeah
[1:00:44] loves to be able to fellowship with
[1:00:45] another christian you know when you talk
[1:00:48] to somebody and they would just rather
[1:00:50] be off somewhere else watching a pig
[1:00:52] race or something
[1:00:54] they'd rather be doing whatever else
[1:00:56] they don't care just as long as they're
[1:00:58] not trying to listen to you
[1:01:01] talk to you
[1:01:02] or
[1:01:03] is exhausting it is it is to be friendly
[1:01:06] to you
[1:01:07] it's character assassination they fit
[1:01:10] you with the tongue
[1:01:12] they tie that that
[1:01:14] fiery
[1:01:15] weapon
[1:01:16] that kills people so many times
[1:01:19] that destroys people's reputations that
[1:01:22] destroys people's standing among others
[1:01:26] whatever the and actions sometimes it's
[1:01:29] not even a tongue it's an action
[1:01:33] if someone of an authority shuns another
[1:01:36] one what do you think the people that
[1:01:37] look up to that person going to think
[1:01:39] about that person yeah
[1:01:41] they're going to shun too
[1:01:43] they're not going to think anything of
[1:01:45] those people if the person they're
[1:01:46] looking up to for leadership does it
[1:01:48] what do you think they're going to do to
[1:01:50] them
[1:01:51] same thing
[1:01:53] but paul but gamalia said watch it
[1:01:56] you do that you might find yourself
[1:01:58] fighting against god
[1:02:00] oh
[1:02:01] amen how many people are fighting
[1:02:03] against god today don't even know it
[1:02:06] fighting against the very god they claim
[1:02:08] to be serving
[1:02:10] living for right amen
[1:02:13] it's it's it's sad
[1:02:15] it's a shame what did what did just tell
[1:02:18] paul song jesus told saul it is hard for
[1:02:22] you to kick against the pricks
[1:02:24] it is hard for you to live this life it
[1:02:26] is hard for you to keep i know you got
[1:02:28] letters in your pocket to damascus to
[1:02:30] put this that christian church out of
[1:02:32] business
[1:02:33] i know that but it's hard for you to
[1:02:35] keep doing this
[1:02:36] it's hard for you to keep kicking
[1:02:38] against that it's hard for you to keep
[1:02:40] coming against the work that i'm
[1:02:42] sanctioned
[1:02:44] i said stop it
[1:02:46] lord what must i do
[1:02:49] you've got to become one of them
[1:02:52] amen you've got to become
[1:02:54] one of them
[1:02:56] so take those decrees tear them off
[1:02:58] throw them in the garbage and go down
[1:02:59] and worship with those people
[1:03:02] amen give a genuine love
[1:03:05] give a genuine uh handshake
[1:03:08] welcome
[1:03:10] amen
[1:03:11] go give them
[1:03:13] your love
[1:03:14] your encouragement go tell them go show
[1:03:17] them that you're with them not against
[1:03:19] them all right amen and throw that
[1:03:21] decree away that's not that's
[1:03:23] i'm obviously dramatizing that's what
[1:03:25] will happen god jesus struck saul down
[1:03:28] blind and ananias had to come pray for
[1:03:30] him but you understand what i'm saying
[1:03:33] what am i supposed to do
[1:03:35] go help those people
[1:03:38] go pray for those people give to those
[1:03:41] people whatever you've got whatever you
[1:03:43] can do whatever it is that's in your
[1:03:45] quiver that you can uh that you can
[1:03:48] supply give to them
[1:03:50] help them
[1:03:52] impart some wisdom impart some knowledge
[1:03:55] impart anything that's going to
[1:03:58] enhance their lives
[1:04:01] and be positive we do it as unto the
[1:04:03] lord what would you do if it was jesus
[1:04:06] right
[1:04:07] amen it's like i said before what would
[1:04:09] you do if that was jesus house
[1:04:12] what would you do if that was jesus's
[1:04:14] car
[1:04:15] would you what would you do if that was
[1:04:17] jesus's money
[1:04:18] what would you do if that was jesus
[1:04:20] church how would you treat it
[1:04:22] amen amen how would you treat how would
[1:04:25] you work on your job if you knew what
[1:04:27] you were doing you were doing for god
[1:04:32] god came down and said okay i want you
[1:04:34] to do this for me
[1:04:36] whatever it is that's your job
[1:04:39] how would you do it
[1:04:40] oh god i don't know i really you know
[1:04:43] what are you are you really a christian
[1:04:45] then
[1:04:47] because it's
[1:04:48] it it kind of becomes suspect at that
[1:04:50] point
[1:04:52] if you don't really want to work for god
[1:04:54] if you don't really care then you're
[1:04:56] just living unto yourself
[1:04:58] you live unto yourself you're going to
[1:05:00] die unto yourself
[1:05:02] what would you do if jesus was asking
[1:05:04] you to do it how would you treat it how
[1:05:06] would you cook your next meal
[1:05:09] if you knew that meal was that was for
[1:05:11] jesus to eat
[1:05:13] literally in a corporal body he was
[1:05:15] gonna consume that meal how would you
[1:05:18] cook it
[1:05:20] amen
[1:05:21] how would how would i
[1:05:24] fix that electric here
[1:05:27] if i knew that that was his house if
[1:05:29] this was going to be a representation of
[1:05:31] him
[1:05:32] how would i do it
[1:05:34] see that's a sad thing sometimes saints
[1:05:37] i've heard so many times
[1:05:40] the phrase and they call themselves
[1:05:42] christians
[1:05:44] because of the way they act the way they
[1:05:46] do because of the way they treat them
[1:05:48] because of the half way that they do a
[1:05:50] job
[1:05:52] now
[1:05:54] i understand that that
[1:05:57] christians are if you tell people you're
[1:06:00] a christian especially if you tell
[1:06:01] people you're a minister
[1:06:03] although i
[1:06:04] i understand the
[1:06:06] minister's supposed to be blameless but
[1:06:08] aren't we all
[1:06:10] i believe every one of us are supposed
[1:06:12] to be blameless
[1:06:13] godly christians but
[1:06:16] when people i know and i know people
[1:06:18] stare and look and and sometimes just
[1:06:21] wait for you to slip up right yeah
[1:06:23] exactly well don't give them the
[1:06:24] opportunity
[1:06:26] don't don't give them the chance
[1:06:29] don't slip up
[1:06:31] that's the best thing to do
[1:06:33] but i've heard so many times something
[1:06:35] that was done wrong
[1:06:37] and and just just halfway not not a
[1:06:39] mistake i mean well i'll make mistakes
[1:06:41] i'm not talking about that i'm not
[1:06:43] talking about a little mistake that was
[1:06:45] done or something but but something was
[1:06:47] just done halfway and you know there was
[1:06:49] no effort put into it and people look
[1:06:50] and say oh and they call themselves a
[1:06:53] christian
[1:06:54] i've heard that so many times
[1:06:57] i i hope it's never been said about me
[1:06:59] probably has been i don't know
[1:07:02] don't know if it was or not i hope it
[1:07:04] wasn't but how many times have you heard
[1:07:06] people say oh and they call themselves a
[1:07:07] christian well don't give them the
[1:07:09] opportunity
[1:07:11] don't give anybody the chance to say
[1:07:13] that about you
[1:07:15] because you do it as unto god
[1:07:17] amen
[1:07:19] that's i'm doing that to you lord amen
[1:07:22] i'm not i'm not doing this for my boss
[1:07:24] i'm not doing that for this job i'm not
[1:07:26] doing this to earn money all that
[1:07:30] is all true
[1:07:34] i'm waking up this morning for you what
[1:07:37] do you want me to do today
[1:07:39] i'm living this day for you god what do
[1:07:42] you do
[1:07:44] everything
[1:07:46] i that's just i you you think that
[1:07:48] brother you you're just radical that's
[1:07:50] just over the top maybe but that's how i
[1:07:53] believe it
[1:07:54] that's how i live my life
[1:07:56] and i believe that's how all of us
[1:07:58] should do amen amen we should all live
[1:08:00] our lives with that attitude with that
[1:08:02] feeling because jesus is the all-seeing
[1:08:05] eye and everything we do he is watching
[1:08:07] amen
[1:08:09] he is watching
[1:08:10] amen he gives us specific instructions
[1:08:14] i'll close here in just a few minutes
[1:08:15] but in ephesians chapter five i'll read
[1:08:18] a couple more scriptures as i close here
[1:08:20] ephesians 5
[1:08:22] verse 21
[1:08:27] submitting yourselves one to another in
[1:08:29] the fear of god how in the fear of god
[1:08:33] amen
[1:08:34] as a representative of jesus christ
[1:08:39] what would a representative of jesus
[1:08:42] christ be
[1:08:44] how would they act
[1:08:46] how would they talk
[1:08:47] how would they present themselves how
[1:08:49] would a representative because a
[1:08:51] representative of jesus is only supposed
[1:08:54] to be an extension of him right
[1:08:57] in other words you're supposed to be
[1:08:59] jesus
[1:09:00] in flesh right
[1:09:02] you're supposed to be representing him
[1:09:05] in every way exactly who he is
[1:09:10] amen
[1:09:13] submitting yourselves one another in the
[1:09:15] fear of god
[1:09:17] wives
[1:09:18] submit yourselves unto your own husbands
[1:09:21] as unto the lord
[1:09:23] amen
[1:09:24] every meal
[1:09:26] every
[1:09:27] speck of dust you vacuum up
[1:09:30] every
[1:09:32] piece of clothes you put in the laundry
[1:09:35] you do is unto the lord pray amen
[1:09:39] because as you submit yourselves unto
[1:09:41] your own husbands you do it as how
[1:09:45] as unto the lord
[1:09:48] amen
[1:09:50] the husband is the head of the wife even
[1:09:53] as christ is the head of the church and
[1:09:56] is the savior of the body
[1:09:58] therefore as the church's subject unto
[1:10:01] christ
[1:10:03] so let the wise be to their own husbands
[1:10:06] in everything
[1:10:09] husbands
[1:10:10] love your wives
[1:10:12] well that trumps everything i just read
[1:10:14] people say ah see i told you wives
[1:10:16] you're supposed to submit time to the
[1:10:18] husband
[1:10:20] wife you've got to submit to me
[1:10:22] well i know that's what the bible says
[1:10:24] but now what does it say about the
[1:10:25] husband husband love your wife
[1:10:28] that love is the love of god
[1:10:32] how did christ love his church
[1:10:34] love his bride
[1:10:36] he didn't beat her around and
[1:10:38] treat her like a maid
[1:10:41] he treated her like his queen
[1:10:44] he treats us like his queen
[1:10:46] like his like his uh uh
[1:10:49] extension of him
[1:10:52] love
[1:10:53] that love compelled him to go to calvary
[1:10:56] for her that's right amen
[1:10:59] so when husbands are up saying
[1:11:01] you gotta submit to me you better watch
[1:11:03] what the rest of that says
[1:11:06] you better love that wife
[1:11:08] if you don't you're gonna be held
[1:11:10] accountable to god yes
[1:11:12] amen amen as unto the lord
[1:11:16] praise the lord
[1:11:19] husbands love your wives even as christ
[1:11:22] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:11:25] for it
[1:11:27] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:11:29] with the washing of the water by the
[1:11:31] word
[1:11:32] that he might present it to himself a
[1:11:34] glorious church
[1:11:36] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:11:38] thing that it should be holy and without
[1:11:41] blemish that's his bride all right that
[1:11:43] is me and you
[1:11:46] sought men to love their wives as their
[1:11:48] own bodies
[1:11:51] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[1:11:54] amen so as you treat your wife you
[1:11:56] treating yourself
[1:11:58] amen
[1:12:00] for nothing ever yet hated his own flesh
[1:12:03] but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[1:12:06] the lord the church for we are members
[1:12:08] of his body of his flesh of his bone
[1:12:11] for this call shall man leave his father
[1:12:13] and mother shall be joined unto his wife
[1:12:16] and they too shall be one flesh
[1:12:19] this is a great mystery but i speak
[1:12:21] concerning christ in the church
[1:12:23] nevertheless that every one of you in
[1:12:25] particular so loved his wife even as
[1:12:28] himself and the wife see that she
[1:12:30] referenced her husband
[1:12:32] there's where you get the mutual respect
[1:12:35] amen
[1:12:36] that's where you get as unto the lord
[1:12:39] because he said here he's speaking of
[1:12:42] the mystery of christ and the and his
[1:12:44] bride the church but it's also that
[1:12:47] level of
[1:12:49] of between
[1:12:51] people
[1:12:54] and we don't just treat
[1:12:56] other christians that way we treat
[1:12:58] everybody that way
[1:13:00] we should treat everybody as as we would
[1:13:03] treat god
[1:13:08] what if
[1:13:09] remember saint martin
[1:13:12] saint martin was uh was going down the
[1:13:15] street and i guess the lord compelled
[1:13:17] him
[1:13:18] because the bomb was freezing
[1:13:21] the man was freezing
[1:13:23] and saint martin i guess was compelled
[1:13:25] of the lord he he took his military coat
[1:13:28] he ripped it in half and he gave that
[1:13:30] bomb half of his coat so he could try to
[1:13:32] stay a little bit warm and not freeze to
[1:13:34] death that night
[1:13:37] military people were making fun of him
[1:13:39] laughing i believe it was in the
[1:13:40] military laughing at him making fun of
[1:13:43] him saying you look silly in that half a
[1:13:45] coat what did you do with the other
[1:13:46] hatching coat you ripped and gave it to
[1:13:48] a bomb why'd you do that for
[1:13:52] making him feel like a fool
[1:13:55] saint martin excuse that
[1:13:57] that's true
[1:13:58] scriptural but
[1:14:00] saint martin that night was asleep
[1:14:03] and god jesus came to him in that in a
[1:14:06] dream
[1:14:07] or or i don't a dream or not a dream but
[1:14:10] jesus came to him that night and saint
[1:14:13] martin looked and jesus was standing
[1:14:15] there wrapped in that half a coat
[1:14:17] right amen
[1:14:18] because he did it as unto the lord
[1:14:21] amen and that's the way we we all should
[1:14:24] approach life
[1:14:26] approach one another approach our
[1:14:28] families approach our jobs approach
[1:14:31] everything that we do
[1:14:33] everything that we do
[1:14:35] we do it for the lord as unto him
[1:14:38] as unto him one more scripture
[1:14:42] in colossians
[1:14:45] colossians chapter three
[1:14:59] uh verse 17
[1:15:02] colossians 3 17 and whatsoever you do in
[1:15:06] word or indeed
[1:15:07] or word or deed
[1:15:09] do all in the name of the lord jesus
[1:15:13] giving thanks to god and the father find
[1:15:15] him all that we do word or indeed all
[1:15:19] didn't say some but didn't say the
[1:15:21] things you considered important
[1:15:23] didn't say just in church didn't say
[1:15:25] just in front of your friends
[1:15:27] or your church members it said all that
[1:15:30] you do
[1:15:32] everything we do we do inward or deep
[1:15:36] we do in the name of the lord jesus
[1:15:39] giving thanks to god and the father by
[1:15:40] him why submit yourselves unto your own
[1:15:43] husbands as fit in the lord husbands
[1:15:46] love your wives and be not bitter
[1:15:48] against them
[1:15:49] children obey your parents in all things
[1:15:53] for this is well pleasing unto the lord
[1:15:57] amen
[1:15:58] children obey your parents in all things
[1:16:04] this is well pleasing unto the lord yes
[1:16:07] i wish i had obeyed that me too
[1:16:10] amen i wished i had obeyed that
[1:16:13] i didn't have a grasp on it at that time
[1:16:16] but i wish i had anyway i'd probably
[1:16:20] made my parents lives a little easier
[1:16:22] but i'm thankful that god shows us this
[1:16:25] to help us understand this is what is
[1:16:28] pleasing to the lord
[1:16:29] this is how we please god this is
[1:16:32] what we do be pleasing to the lord is
[1:16:34] live every moment all the word all
[1:16:37] indeed
[1:16:39] to ourselves to one another where we do
[1:16:42] it as unto the lord
[1:16:44] whatever we do in word warranty we do in
[1:16:47] the name of the lord jesus
[1:16:49] amen
[1:16:50] submitting ourselves to one another
[1:16:53] praise them so the next time that you
[1:16:56] feel that spirit come on you think well
[1:16:58] i'm you know
[1:17:00] man if i have to do one more load of
[1:17:02] laundry i'm gonna go crazy if i gotta
[1:17:05] i feel that way sometimes when brother
[1:17:07] roger tells me there's another ditch
[1:17:09] ahead i gotta do one more ditch i'm done
[1:17:12] or or whatever it is
[1:17:16] we all have our own ditches
[1:17:18] amen right
[1:17:19] i'm done uh i'll i'm just i'm not gonna
[1:17:22] do this i've you know i'll slack off and
[1:17:25] let so and so dig the the bulk of the
[1:17:28] ditch
[1:17:29] would jesus have done that
[1:17:32] amen
[1:17:34] praise the lord
[1:17:35] well he's a better ditch digger than i
[1:17:37] am
[1:17:38] well everybody's probably a better ditch
[1:17:40] digger than i am
[1:17:42] i haven't had a whole lot of practice
[1:17:44] but that doesn't negate my
[1:17:45] responsibility
[1:17:47] you know i'm just yourself from this
[1:17:49] example friend every one of us have
[1:17:50] those situations in life every one of us
[1:17:53] have those obstacles every one of those
[1:17:54] every one of us faces those things all
[1:17:57] the time every day
[1:17:59] if you breathe the breath of life today
[1:18:02] if you breathe it tomorrow
[1:18:04] it'll present itself again
[1:18:08] it'll show itself real again tomorrow
[1:18:10] just like you did today and we'll do it
[1:18:12] again as unto the lord
[1:18:15] amen
[1:18:16] glad you asked me to do this approach it
[1:18:18] with that god you asked me to do this
[1:18:21] god you wanted me to do this
[1:18:23] god this is i'm doing this for you amen
[1:18:26] amen
[1:18:27] praise the lord so then whatever
[1:18:29] whatever
[1:18:30] we get then we give to the lord
[1:18:33] because we did it for him
[1:18:36] there's a scripture in exodus i believe
[1:18:39] it is i usually use that scripture when
[1:18:41] i preach on tithes and offers but that
[1:18:44] that scripture says my my strength has
[1:18:47] gotten me this this wealth
[1:18:50] your strength you wouldn't have a
[1:18:52] strength in your body if god didn't give
[1:18:54] it to you
[1:18:55] my strength in my back my intelligence
[1:18:57] you wouldn't have a brain if god didn't
[1:18:59] give it to you that's right
[1:19:01] you wouldn't have anything if god give
[1:19:03] it to you so everything i've got belongs
[1:19:06] to him amen because i wouldn't have any
[1:19:08] of it if it wasn't for him
[1:19:11] praise the lord so i'd do it for him
[1:19:13] amen
[1:19:14] let's stand if we could tonight

[1:27:07] the night
[1:27:09] he's saying you know

[1:27:22] and then he said the bible says peter
[1:27:25] said here
[1:27:28] i never remember reading that
[1:27:30] so i got up and went looked it up sure
[1:27:32] enough it does
[1:27:34] but
[1:27:36] it was amazing that uh
[1:27:39] that jesus would take
[1:27:41] someone that he knew was ignorant the
[1:27:43] ignorant another put it in the
[1:27:44] scriptures
[1:27:46] and then tell me so build this church on
