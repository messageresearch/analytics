brother as he is he'll get up sometime and start singing a song and just write a song as he's singing it behind the pulpit i think this is what i heard this is one of them he just wrote he just sang this song it just came out of him so i like it it's a real blessing so praise the lord we'll go to this psalm one more before we go to the lord in prayer amen psalm number 33 we all know this one probably pretty well the rock of ages amen thank you jesus he is the rock of ages let's sing it to him [Music] rock of ages pray for me let me hide myself in thee let the water and the blood from thy word inside [Music] good my tears forever flow could myself no longer know these for sin could not at all must save and thou alone in my hand o price i bring simply to thy cross like me [Music] while i draw this fleeting bread when my eyes shall close in there when i rise to worlds unknown and behold beyond thy throne rock of ages left for me let me hide myself in thee amen praise the lord jesus hide us in you lord god amen you know brother branham told us we can be so lost in christ so he hit in him satan can't even find you amen praise the lord that's where i want to be amen i'm going to be so good in him satan can't even get to me you can't even find me amen praise the lord jesus we have a couple of prayer requests amen to mention did we have any over there and i didn't see any but you can double check for me if you want amen while i read these couple of requests that we have here we want to remember uh sister elizabeth sister zika's daughter sister karen and tom's daughter when she went on a trip sonia took her to the airport at four o'clock this morning she went on a trip so let's remember her in prayer the lord would just be with her and bless her trip give her a trip back uh safe back sister shelia was not able to be with us today sent me a text with a couple of prayer requests on it uh one said please pray for my neighbors the husband lynn has been in the hospital for four weeks tomorrow he has requested to come home to die him and his wife been married 43 years lynn and pat burwell is their names uh also she said please pray for my son who is driving to portland from seattle to support his friend of 30 years sean sean's mother is dying sean has flown home to be with her with her from bordering country of ukraine he has been transporting refugees since russia attacked ukraine amen thank you god bless you her son's name of course you probably know as dominic and then so let's remember him also and this in the entire situation family there in prayer if we could the lord would just move upon them grant them his grace and their lives um also as you all know uh sister joyce duggal passed away this week this week kind of seemed like out of the blue although sister joyce has had some heart issues for some time now i remember going to visit her many times in the hospital when she would be sick previous tmc and she's had congenital heart failure and i i don't know i don't even remember what else the sister's been through the lord has been so good to her and blessed her with so many more years and so many more times with her husband with her children grandchildren great grandchildren but it was her time so i say it with a very sad heart i love sister joyce very dearly as i do so many times with those that are close to sister joyce was a tremendous sister she was a matriarch of one of the great families that came to tucson tabernacle and she was a sister who was not afraid to speak her mind she wasn't afraid to stand for what she believed even when it came against her friends that believed contrary to her uh she didn't mind voicing those opinions she didn't mind telling others how she felt and she stood for me when so many people did not and i appreciate and loved her very much um she gave help and aid to lives that probably nobody many people will never know and countless ones that probably couldn't even be counted right her family children grandchildren great-grandchildren my wife just saw her last saturday morning not yesterday but a week ago at her great-grandson's funeral that we talked to you about uh she seemed fine she's doing good um so we saw her a couple weeks ago when brother roger came to visit we went to longhorn for lunch and she was there she stopped and stood there and talked for 10 15 minutes she's just just she's just that kind of sister there's so much more i could say but with the sake of time and service today i don't have any details of service if anybody does please feel free to raise your hand or mention it i don't have any details as of yet obviously i'm assuming it'll be at the tucson tabernacle sometime in the near future but just went to two funerals last saturday and wednesday i think it was wednesday sister joyce pass um it just keeps happening saints how many times we've mentioned here uh ones that we love and love dearly and all that they just just keep going this would be the third sec two funerals last saturday and this is the third passing away none of covet amen it's not copied uh but god's just taking his children home and i i you know i've shared with you a little thoughts that i may have had on that line and maybe it's true maybe it's not i don't know for sure but god knows and that's all that matters but we'll certainly dearly miss sister joyce she was a very precious sister and i loved her very much uh so please remember the family in prayer the entire google family if you would uh brother keith your husband and of course the children grandchildren as i said so please remember them in prayer if you would um precious sisters gone home to be with the lord amen have an unspoken request today the lord knows all of our hearts today i looked on the internet to see if anybody had posted i'm friends with ed i'm friends with uh joyce i'm uh well joyce uh sometimes they when someone passes away people the children or something post on their facebook page so people will get it so i looked on sister joyce's i looked on i'm friends with jennifer her daughter that lives in texas but went by the visit a couple of times uh and there was nothing there so does anybody have any detail or know anything about any arrangements okay so as soon as we get them we'll let you know and um but again the main thing now is we pray for the family so let's stand to our feet if we could remember these requests and once it's our hearts today the lord will be with each one of them praise the lord god forgive me if there's any that i forget sometimes sometimes they slip my mind so amen but we always love the lord and what he does for us brother pat would you take peace to the lord for us today lord jesus we have needs to depend on you yes solve the needs take care of the problems thank you jesus we appreciate that that you do and we believe in this life we're here giving them to you yes lord jesus we love you lord as if you help us be acceptable in your sight yes amen thank you for lord keeping us safe and healthy going in your in your ways your path yes father in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen praise the lord

grace all the glory and praise they went and they did a biopsy amen praise the lord clean mental health praise the lord of that jesus yeah just a testimony i just want to thank the lord for continuing to provide um i've been at my new job for a month now and everything's going very well she's even talked about giving me heart ownership of the agency and um things are just the lord's unfolding so many things at once i just want to thank you for it amen praise the lord jesus wonderful god is good we got to remember we're going to have a prayer for brother angel after service today i don't know if you mind me mentioning it you don't mind me brother our angel was well i don't know a whole story but after service maybe lord villain but uh brother ernest ernesto his brother came to the breakfast yesterday morning and mentioned about it and then sister priscilla sent me a prayer request that we want to pray for and lay hands on brother angel today but apparently brother angel had a little bit of a stroke yesterday uh while you were driving that's what he said while he was driving and priscilla had to take the wheel and uh for a little bit so we want to pray for the angel and keep him before the lord of course but we're going to lay hands on him after church today and call the lord jesus for touch on brother angel strokes are a little different a lot of times than other ailments once you get a stroke you're successful to them uh the rest of your life they can happen one right after the other even and things like that so we want to pray that that not happened to brother angel amen and the lord would just touch you in this it was an isolated incident and it's done it's over amen we'll just pray it wasn't even a stroke how's that praise the lord a little anxiety or a little indigestion or something that's it yeah amen yes that's sure i believe that absolutely amen praise the lord so i failed to mention that during the prayer requests and so apologize but i did i knew there was something weighing on my mind that's why i said what i said after we got done if i forgot something please forgive me because i knew there was something weighing on my mind to thank god for bringing it back to me so amen so let's stand if we could we'll go into scripture now uh turn in our bibles to saint matthew chapter 7. saint matthew chapter 7. praise the lord matthew chapter 7 we're going to begin reading with verse 21. matthew 7 21. praise the lord i enjoy the testimonies amen god's so good to us you know that just gives you so much encouragement you know what the lord does for you but when you hear how the lord's moving in others lives and god's blessing and amen you look at that and think well lord where's my portion then god drops a little portion of you and amen and then you witness and testify to that and god's just good let's just bow our heads forward prayer if we could lord jesus father it is such a privilege lord to again bow our heads toward the dust from whence these bodies came acknowledging you as our lord and our savior our god acknowledging you lord as being there for us always and never leaving or forsaking us and the honor the privileged lord that we have to be able to speak to you personally lord i don't have to go through a priest i don't have to go through a board i don't have to go through some denomination i don't have to have somebody else intercede for me although prayer for one another is good but lord i can speak right directly to you and know that you hear and answer our requests and know that you answer back and that you speak back lord so many times lord what a privilege it is the king of kings the lord of lords yes the creator of heaven and earth is there to listen and to be attentive to our hearts and our desires we thank you so much lord for this time of fellowship once again for this place that you give us for all that you do for us every day thank you for these that have come lord those who may be streaming thank you for all that you do for us every day god and this word lord that you've given us reveal it to us once again lord and show us in here what you'd have us to see and know strengthen our lives bless our lives keep us lord ever in your care father as we commit this to you and our and pray lord that you would speak only what you'd have us to hear and anoint our ears to receive it god i pray that you'd bless and be with every request and every need but again my heart is heavy lord for our precious sister joyce i'm so thankful god that that she's gone home to be with you a beautiful young lady again lord never to have any more hospital visits or heart problems lord the god her heart is for you looking and waiting for her family and trusting for all of us to go home very soon lord we are looking to that time god bless each one now lord in the reading of your words we committed to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen matthew chapter 7 verse 21 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart for me ye that work iniquity therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and the beat and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and do with them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and the and and great was the fall of it amen you could be seated if you'd like amen we're going to have a little bit of a bilingual service today very little bit of a bilingual service um i had the title of this today la roca my wife thinks i'm crazy when i try to speak any spanish with a southern accent but i'm doing it anyway the title today la roca and that's it i'm done that's all the bilingual you're getting today that's not all i know so the rock amen i want to title this the rock today there's a little church actually down well it's not a little church but uh on orange grove right at thorny dale called la rocca it is the rock the church the rock uh but uh i want to speak on this today it's something that the lord gave me kind of as a as a i guess you'd say an offshoot from last week and something the lord had given me to say and sometimes oftentimes when the lord gives something and he just drops something fresh something else comes from it and this came from that i wasn't really sure of that until i came in here in prayer and yesterday i really didn't know uh but after the breakfast yesterday morning and i enjoyed the brothers breakfast so god bless you thank you those who were able to come and were there with us and just enjoyed the fellowship but after and coming over here and spending some time with the lord uh he put that on my heart and reminded me of that so uh and then started giving me some scripture so one of the scriptures we just read now i want to begin this again the title is the rock amen we know that jesus is the rock we talk about a lot of attributes of jesus and we talk about a lot of uh characteristics that jesus has and so many times we we seem to fail to mention and talk about how jesus is that rock he's the anchor the stabilizing force but we must also remember and the thing that a lot of the thing that separates as this scripture tells us that separates the true believer from the make-believer is that rock amen jesus here said they come and they said lord and they call them lord said we've done this in your name we've done this in your name and people say well yeah they call on jesus name well but what is their foundation built on if their foundation isn't built on christ the wrong they can say they come in his name all they want but right here he says depart from me ye that work iniquity i never even knew you you never had relationship with me you never were a part of my life you never came in and had intimate relations with me i did not know you i don't i didn't know you then and i don't know you now you might have mentioned the name jesus or called and implored that name which anybody can do but we go on to find out that jesus said only those that i acknowledge and recognize are the ones that do the will of the father the ones that do what i tell them to do the ones that follow my words if you follow not my words then you don't belong to me it doesn't matter matter how many times they call on the name jesus it doesn't matter how many songs they sing or how much is written about it it's irrelevant if the foundation is not the rock not just a rock but the rock it's got to be jesus christ the rock and unless that foundation is laid on there it doesn't matter we talk about the statue of a perfect man we talk about us being the the housing of the holy spirit we talk about uh ourselves being built up and those things but friend we can have the most beautiful most perfect most uh eloquent most uh uh a holy building that you could imagine but friend if that building is not laid on the foundation of jesus christ then none of it matters none of it matters and see that's the sad part about it so many times because you see people trying to build these spiritual houses but they haven't dug down deep enough to get down to that foundation of jesus christ to lay that there so that when the winds come and the storm blows the house stands right they don't go down deep enough they don't get in there hard enough sometimes people just say uh just come and say well i'm a christian okay you got it you're a christian friend sometimes you gotta dig down deep you gotta get down in to get down to that foundation and lay that spiritual building on that foundation some people come in this message and they feel like they can lay their foundation on william branham right you cannot lay your foundation on william branham it will not work it will be destroyed when the winds blow and the storms come it won't stand some people probably laid their on perry green right you can't do that right you can't lay your foundation on any man on any other man jesus christ you can't lay your foundation on any human anybody that's uh that seems to be a godly good person and that's fine and i would guarantee you if either one of those brothers was here in the flesh right now they would tell you audibly that i am right and don't you dare build your christian foundation in your home and you that spiritual household either one of them they would tell you that personally i believe that but unfortunately so many times it seems like it happens that way people come in the message and say i know the message and they read the books and they get the quotes and they get the the special things that they can say like we talked about last week with the nomination they have their famous little quotes and their famous little scriptures and their specific things that that's and that's their foundation it's almost like a religion or politics you listen and sometimes you listen to a republican speak and they say the exact same thing all the time you listen to a democrat and they're called talking points they have their little talking well blah blah blah and just say these few little words and i guess now they call the word salad but they just say a bunch of stuff and it means nothing they use 50 words and say absolutely nothing because it's all just a bunch of jibber-jabber it's all a bunch of talking points and that's what unfortunately we have in in religion different denominations have their talking points the message has their specific scriptures or their specific quotes that's where they go all the time friend they're laid on the wrong foundation amen your foundation has got to be dug down and and gotten down to that bedrock which is jesus christ yes amen jesus christ christ is that roxy a rock builds a solid foundation let's let's read another account of this over in uh st luke now remember anybody can call themselves a christian anybody can as long as you're not a mute you can say i'm a christian but the problem is does your life line up to your testimony very much brother ram said don't jump any higher you can live yes amen i believe in the gifts of spirit and i i prayed that that manifest in each one of us and whatever they are stir that gift up whatever it is yes but friend the gift's not not going to save you right uh a a few quotes your scripture is not going to save you it's not going to be that that foundation that you need that when all the things in friend you know as well as i do the storms come they're going to continue to come and they're going to beat against that house and they're going to smash and the waves are going to come and the wind's going to blow and the sand is going to knock and all that can be done is going to be done to make sure that you are built on that that solid rock foundation of jesus christ and not a doctrine right not a system not a denomination not a not an individual not a pastor a prophet or a person no it's it has to be on jesus christ yes nothing else and they say i'm a christian but what does that really mean what does it mean to people what does it mean to us what does it mean to you to say i'm a christian what does that mean to you when i say i say i'm a christian i testify to other people and say i'm a christian what does that mean to me i don't know what it means to them but i know what it means to me and what does it mean to be a christian it doesn't mean just that i can say that or just that i come to church once in a while or i participate or i read the bible or pray a little bit or something it doesn't mean that because people do that all the time like like jesus just said here they said we did this in your name this and your name this and your name this and your name we we forsake all we did all this in your name jesus he said i don't even know you right you call on my name but i don't even know you why didn't jesus know them because they weren't obedient to the word and christ is the word yes amen you cannot have a revelation of the word of god unless you have a revelation of who jesus christ is and you cannot have a revelation of who jesus christ is unless your spiritual house is built on that foundation yes christ the rock cannot be if it's built there then the house will be built up there saint luke uh chapter 6 verse 40 uh 46. verse 40 chapter 6 verse 46 jesus said why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say isn't that just a wholesale witness of what christianity seems to be in most circles today you call yourself a christian you say unto me lord lord but you don't do what my word tells you to do you're not obedient to the scripture you're not obedient to the word and how can you call yourself a christian if you're not obedient to what he tells you to what his word says why do you live like that why do you dress like that why do you act like that and call yourself a christian amen christians not a word it's a life yes it's not a a phrase it's not a club that you join it's a life it's a foundation it's something everyone that's ever going to be a part of him that is built up in it's him 46 uh 46 we just read why do you say lord and did not do what i tell you whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth them i will show to you whom he is like he is like a man which built a house and dig deep amen dig deep some people don't want to take what comes what what it takes to be a christian they don't want to do what it takes they don't want to commit themselves to the to the well i i'll just say the work the struggle the what it takes to get down to that foundation the only way you can get down to that foundation is to get rid of everything else that's cluttering it's like we talked about last week people leave denominations and and try and come in this message and they bring that garbage with them i mean they might die out to some of it but they some of their ideologies and some of their foundation fundamental beliefs they bring with them and try to bring and integrate it into this message right and it just doesn't work you gotta die you gotta dig deep you gotta throw all that other out and dig down to that foundation you gotta get past that denomination you gotta get past that pastor you gotta get past whatever anybody said because this relationship is between you and him this relationship is between you and christ and you and christ alone it's not you brother adam and christ it's not you me and christ not you brother green and christ it's you and christ and christ alone period amen so you got to dig down to that you got to get down to that foundation he says dig deep some people just don't want to do the work they just want to come in and say i'm a christian i'm a message believer i think oh i wear uh a hat or a tie or something and there's nothing wrong with any of that friend but that doesn't that doesn't testify to god who you are right amen might destify to somebody out of here in the world that you you identify yourself as such and such but has christ identified you as such and such am i well he hasn't if it's not on that foundation dig deep you got to get down deep friend and laid the foundation on a rock shall i say the rock jesus christ now the metaphor here christ is using for a literal house on a rock but that representing us that house of god built on zero the foundation amen and uh on iraq and when the flood arose the stream beat the intimately upon that house and could not shake it i like that for it was founded upon a rock could not shake it oh my that's wonderful friend you know it just tells us if your foundation is jesus christ it doesn't matter what comes to you you're not going to be shaken by it it doesn't matter what doctrine swings your way it doesn't matter what somebody as well it tries to tie these stuff together and try to make some great news something that it doesn't matter any that comes it's not going to sway you it's not going to change you it it it's not going to shake you amen because you know what your foundation is yeah when when trials come it's not going to shake you when that went and and it's going to beat friend you know that those winds are going to come those waves are going to be hard but it doesn't shake you because you know what's foundation is you know what you are built upon and you know regardless and you know it comes that when you're on that foundation that foundation holds it's not the house is holding it's the foundation that's holding see that's the problem a lot of the people think that they have in this world their security and they built that and they say they built these oh new big uh buildings that will withstand hurricanes and with stain uh withstand earthquakes and and withstand tornadoes friend there is no such thing there isn't there may be some that they have the technology that might help a little bit better but when god takes california and shakes her so bad underneath there and a single building's gonna stand right not one amen i don't care how technically advanced they are in building these buildings when that foundation is not settled it's not stable it's not on that rock it will shake down amen amen it will shake down the stream beat vehemently upon that house but it could not shake it for the foundation was on a rock was it the house amen it was the foundation was it that the house being built good that's fine it should be but it's the foundation that what keeps it from blowing over that keeps it from crumbling to the ground is the foundation that foundation is the most important part people we we always talk about that the statue of a perfect man i'll read it here in just a few minutes and and the building up and all but it's the foundation that's the most important part you can have the most beautiful building you can have the most technologically advanced you can have million multi-million dollar house setting on but if it's not on that foundation friend it will be shaken down amen it will be but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built a house upon the earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great the ruin of the house was great when it fell now how many times have we noticed and seen especially in these last days that people had apparently their houses their spiritual houses built upon something other than the rock right what happens to it when a little something comes i i've had people try to convince me that brother branham was not the prophet for this day i've had people try to convince me that he lied and that stories were fabricated in garbage like this i've had people ask me oh this brother has a compelling evidence uh i'll send it to you i said brother don't bother don't bother i'm not going to listen to it i don't want to listen to it and even if i did listen to it it's not going to shape me so it doesn't matter you can come with the biggest title wave tsunami you want and try to beat me upside the head with it but this man is stable and steady and is not going to be shaken i don't care what they say am i now come to find out when you really dig deep you find out what they've found out is garbage right it's not even true amen trust me i've looked at i've looked at all of it that i could find and it's all garbage and lies and lines even about the clout lies i've had people that i've heard that try to dispel the cloud and they're telling fabrications it's lies it's not even true don't worry doesn't shake me and they say also no no no i've told you before if somebody comes to some kind of doctrine or something oh wow brother branham said so and so no if it's what if if it's what the lord is behind he'll reveal it and he will he'll not only reveal it but then he will uh testify to it he does in my life anyway he will testify to it he will show that that is the truth he will manifest it in a way that we realize that's god we know that's god and nothing else shakes it so when somebody comes and says oh jesus came in 63 there's no more coming he's not coming he was he's here i used to see someone's in florida and the brother come up and said oh you can't sing that anymore he's not coming he's here i said well i know he's here but he's still coming right right amen oh no no no that that happened way back so and so on such and such and you start looking in the message find out if you if you take the little interpretation of what brother branham said about all that i said then you and me are both lost because that is for either one of us became christians one of them was before i was ever born now where are you i'm 56 now friend but it doesn't shake you understand people can come with whatever they want to come with but it doesn't shake because i my foundation is christ this word and if it goes off this word i don't care who tries to manipulate it doesn't matter amen my foundation is christ it's this word amen you can't build on anything else and expect it to stand because it won't it can now let's go to second peter let's talk about this statue for a few minutes the thing that we effectively as message believers call the statue of a perfect man brother bantam title the statue of a perfect man perfect being not sinless right perfect not being without fault or mistake no perfect being mature grown-up christian a mature person of full age that's what it means perfection not sinless perfection but a full age a grown-up a mature christian is that perfect man reaches that place amen now look here um second peter chapter one uh we'll just start with verse one simon peter a certain apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of our of jesus christ our lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these these promises ye might be partakers of the divine nature which is the holy spirit having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lusts and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge difference and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound not just in you but abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and had forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall never fall well he talks to us about this statue of a perfect man and dares i say and i know this is on camera but dares i say there is a religion within this message that builds their entire foundation upon this right amen they build their foundation upon this upon this statue of a perfect man but your foundation cannot be faith you understand add your faith virtue but your foundation cannot be faith your foundation has to be jesus christ and your faith is in the foundation that you're setting on which is jesus christ if the bottom line of our building is faith faith in what what do you have faith in that if faith is the bottom line then what is there to have faith in it says add your faith virtue well how do you well then what is there to have faith in to add your virtue to what are you believing in what is your faith in it's got to be your faith has to be in the foundation that this building his house is laid on you've got to dig down deep first and once you get down to that bedrock foundation of jesus christ then you can lay faith on it and you can have faith in the rock that you are setting on and then you can add to your faith virtue and then from your virtue knowledge and tempers and then you build that house and that house will stand amen because it is laid on that foundation the rock it is laid on jesus if it's laid on anything else we know it won't stand but it's got to be on that foundation it's got to be on that rock it has to be on jesus christ or it doesn't matter how beautiful and wonderful your faith is oh faith healers i lay my hands on somebody they're immediately well that's just a gift of the spirit that doesn't mean your foundation's on christ oh but they have great faith yeah but faith in what where is your faith you say well they have faith that's good but if it's not on that solid foundation then what is it because again that's just the gift of the spirit amen amen and then turn around and disobey the word about whatever life they're living or whatever word they're preaching right disobeying the word sorry the foundation is not on jesus christ oh we've done many mighty works jesus i never even knew you and they try to show their works to you as a proof that they're a christian friend your works don't prove you're a christian your life proves you're a christian amen how will they know that you're my disciples when you have love one for the other that's a life lived amen that's a that is an evidence of proof that shows through your life that you do amen and you can't fake it i people can for a little while and try to manufacture something along the lines because you can have anybody can have faith everybody does have faith the bible says every man has been dealt the measure of faith everybody's got faith right whether you're christian or not you've got faith so it just it builds from there but if the foundation is in jesus christ the words of what's the faith in amen the church i'm in the message denomination [Music] your bank account your job politics what is your foundation what is your faith in at that point oh my faith is in jesus then you obey the word you live the word you obey what christ said here in a holiness amen in a holy living is that your obedience amen is it in the word yes praise the lord amen it's got to be yes of the foundation if it's not it's blown away yes amen and and if we do these things now when he mentions the building he talks about the building here and peter says when peter says add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge temperance temperance patience now some people believe that you have to you have to accomplish this entire list before you can even get the holy ghost well friend my contention is how can you have it without the holy ghost that's right amen you get the holy ghost the foundation and then you build on that if you're building on anything else other than that then you're on the wrong foundation right you got to get that first amendment amen what did what did paul even tell him he said do your first words over again do it do if there was no sincerity behind your repentance if there was no uh actual repent of spirit in you when you repented the god and got baptized then it didn't do any good if you weren't truly if you came to the lord and you repented you said lord i'm sorry forgive me if you weren't truly repentant of that it didn't matter he's on a cowhide amen it didn't matter didn't mean anything you're your your testimony your life has to fit your testimony if your testimony is lord i'm sorry forgive me then what you're saying is lord i know this is wrong and i didn't mean to do it and i won't do it again amen amen that's what repentance is repentance doesn't mean that you're walking along in life and doing things you shouldn't all of a sudden you parse and say god forgive me i'm sorry and then you just keep walking no means you're walking you ask god forgive me i'm sorry i didn't mean to act that way or do those things and you turn and you go the other way that's right yes you live a different life because you're a different person you obey a different word you live a different life because you're a different person amen then you become somebody different now when this when this building is built that we talk about this statue of a perfect man that's built up to godliness brotherly kindness and charity charity being the capstone of course which is literally christ himself so we understand that now jesus is the author the foundation and the finisher the capstone of us of our faith he's the author and finisher of our faith he's the beginning the foundation he is the end he is the alpha and he is the omega so he bookends this spiritual house christ the foundation which we always talk about the capstone but we forget the foundation a lot of times you want to add capstone you got to have the foundation right so he's the foundation he's that bedrock that we build this house on and then he comes and captures it amen now when that agape godly love comes and catches that individual then you know that it's been accepted by god it's been it's been a a tabernacle a house that is please pleasing to god and god receives you to himself that statute amen that that capstone that comes and caps you that that agape godly love that so we're now booked in this house is so what does it make us nothing special we're just his we're [Music] omega beginning ending we're all his yes well for all he is we're going to do what he tells us to do it's like the children sitting here what is one of the greatest things that you know how they love you oh they can come and hug you and kiss you and that feels so good as a parent you love them to death but what makes you more proud is the fact that they listen and obey what you tell them amen amen that's when you know that you've gotten somewhere you know that you've done something amen and it doesn't have to be a directive you understand it doesn't have to be that god comes and says okay you do this no it just means that when i walk and i live i'm doing it based on what he taught me amen i see some kids sitting here and they're being mostly sweet uh mostly quiet sitting obediently i think they wouldn't be that way if they weren't trained amen their lives are a reflection of how they were taught it's not a directive you give them although you have to do sometimes you have to do that sometimes amen or or give a hand gesture or something protoplasm stimulation program said and that gets their attention but most of the time you set and see and that's the thing that makes the parent proud and that's the thing that makes god proud it's not that god comes down and says okay do this go here do this and he does that sometimes but the fact that we just live our lives based on his word in obedience to what he's told us to do he's given us the directive he just wants us to live it out he just wants us to be obedient to it in fact a lot of times the lord just lets us go and lets us once we get to a certain place and say well huh i just want to see how is she going to do this how is he going to act in this situation how did what is what is this going to bring in there how are they going to what are they going to say about this and see he he does that to make sure to see are we going to obey what he told us to do amen now you know just like the children we make mistakes and we might say something we shouldn't or get up in a spirit or anger or something we shouldn't and and act in ways that we shouldn't and god has to come and correct us amen but the thing that makes him the proudest is the fact that it doesn't have to be told every single time do this do this be this be that you do it because you know that's what he told you to do you live your life because you know that's what's pleasing to him through his word amen and after that house is built after that building that god in brotherly kindness charity he says now if these things be in you and abound they'll make you neither bear nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that likes these things is blind cannot see a falloff has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather give diligence to make your calling and elections sure and if you do these things you shall never fall so now he goes and tells us about after the foundation is built or or after this house is built that we live unto that statue we live as instruments of that statue that faith that virtue that knowledge that tempers patience everything that's in it we live to that and as we live our lives to that if we hold that is at our standard the foundation the capstone you can not fall praise the lord it doesn't matter what comes you won't be shaken it doesn't matter what comes you cannot fall you can't why because he's the one that you're standing on and if you could fall at that point he can fall and we know he can't fall so if he can't fall then i can't fall because that's what i'm established here am i right that's what i'm standing on that's what's beneath me that's what's above me that's what's all over me in me around me all over us amen you cannot fall impossible to fall let's go back over to matthew again chapter 16. amen now this that we talk about is it's only to the believer only to the believer this is not to the make-believer this is not to the unbeliever it's only to the believer because only the believer is going to believe the word to the point that they make it their absolute yes right that they make it their lives the make believer can fake it and look at this and believe that you know certain things i mean friends i've talked to people that claim to be i mean fundamental foundational people in this message that there are two or three things that we know in this message that we hold dear as true that they don't even believe and i've talked to them about it i said how could you not oh the bible doesn't say it exactly like that well you could you could find several things that brother branham taught us that you look in the scripture and say oh it doesn't say exactly that word no but you look at how that and that's what the gift of that prophet yeah that and i said okay if you want to dispel this that brother branham taught us that i mean was it's not just something simple but really a fundamental principle brother branham taught us in the scripture um and you want to dispel that i said then what about what authority do you speak to dispel it i know the authority brother branham spoke to bring it to us what is the authority you stand on to dispel what that prophet said right amen i want to know jesus said if you can't believe me believe the words because they testify to who i am well if you believe the words you're going to believe the word if it's believed properly if you just follow an assign that's something different that that sign will lead you down to a dead end and obviously often to the abyss but if you don't if you don't see it that way then about what authority do you speak where is your prophetic gift where is your uh place in the scripture that that we can find and say that you have the authority to come against this what is your authority that you speak i know what brother branham says i don't have a question about that amen we all know that we know the man's life we know how he lived we know the things he did we know the miracles that happen we know all we know all those things so by what authority do you come against what god spoke to that man amen nothing contrary to the scripture we know that brother branham couldn't bring anything contrary to the scripture matthew 16. i'll leave it at that matthew chapter 16. so we see this is only to the believer because only the true believer is going to believe it enough to receive it and then become it that word becomes them matthew 16 verse 15. he uh let's start up at verse 13. matthew 16 13. when jesus came into the coast of syria philippi he asked his disciples saying who do men say i the son of man am they said some say thou art john the baptist some elias others jeremiah's or one of the prophets which listen this is where this is the point that many people get scrupled up and it follows this pattern some say who are these some they're people obviously men probably that are saying that you are john the baptist how could jesus be john the baptist when john the baptist baptized jesus you're the reincarnation of john the baptist really and we were the same age he baptized me and he's saying that jesus you understand they say well they look at something and all they see is what's in front of them it's like the world going crazy now don't get me wrong i think we're all destroying ourselves and i do believe that brother said that men would destroy themselves we're destroying the earth we're destroying ourselves but this green stuff and i'll say it that way so many times they get up and preach at you and all they care about is that thing right there oh you just plug it in the wall well they forget they forget how it comes from point a to here to plug it into the wall set oh well all you got to do is plug it in yeah but what does it take to get it from over there to that plug i don't tell you that part and see that's the problem that people have the parallels are just outstanding when you look at him you say that's exactly a lot of the way that people do they see that jesus said well wow that's like john he's john the baptist reincarnate and they forget everything that brought him to that point and the fact that they were together and that john baptized jesus and john declared jesus the son of the lamb of god and take away the sin of the world jesus is standing there and disciples come to jesus of john's and tell him tell john so and so such and such you go tell john that well why don't you just tell himself if he's a reincarnation of john but you understand all they see is right there and so many times that's all people see they don't see how it got to there people forget how does electricity get to this plug well you got to do this you got to do this you got to go through that you got to have coal fire plants and all this other stuff and all these things that have to make the power to bring it to bring it to here to begin with probably using more than they did if you just put some gasoline tank go amen that's my opinion but i've studied and i know there's there's a lot that goes into putting electricity in that plug friend right oh you just plug garden water be all right now you got to get electricity that plug somehow amen what are we going to do fill up the entire earth with a bunch of windmills and solar panels oh that that'd be a pretty sight wouldn't it to have all of our great landscape covered with all these huge panels and anyway again i said that prefacing i do believe we are killing ourselves i've said that before and brother brown said man we've killed themselves amen we've got that point i said so i say now are we better with these things are we better when they travel down the road on a horseback amen i say i say humanity is better off 100 years ago than we are now people with all these advancements and all the technology and all the things we use them and and we use them for good but uh was humanity better than or better now but matthew 16 uh he said you some say that john the baptist some say elijah jeremiah so the prophets he said unto them but who who but whom say ye that i am i'm not concerned about everybody else now i want to know what you think what is your opinion what do you say what are you guys saying when you're over there in the corner whispering to one another what is your opinion about who i am simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god amen spokesman speaking up big mouth peter let it known and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say un also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys to the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bow on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever shalt thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven praise the lord that he charged him not to tell who he was what was he who was he because that that is not something that was to be public knowledge it was to the believer the believer as they stood there and i'm sure some of them maybe even weren't sure themselves but the spokesman stood up and said thou art the christ the son of the living god jesus said on that foundation on that rock i will build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it now it does not say that the gates of hell won't come against it right it just says the gates of hell will not prevail against it oh we know that the gates of hell come against it all the time brother adam said that all hell is out against this teaching we know that yes so that hell of that that that a spirit is going to come against it but it cannot prevail yes now you understand we see the theme that the lord gave yesterday amen you cannot fall you cannot fail it'll be but it will stand now he's standing here and says the gates of hell will not prevail praise the lord so if we can just get this one thing and understand that if our if that foundation if our building is built on christ that solid rock foundation that it cannot and you build your house on it you cannot fall amen it will not fall it cannot be broken down it cannot be torn down it cannot be prevailed against it will stand amen praise the lord now we've got four scriptures that the lords give us to recognize that in all the things that we see going on in the world and people that have left the christianity have left the church have left message that if it's built on a foundation not the message or not not brother branham that's not the message the message is the word but not a man not a pastor but on jesus christ and the problem is so many foundations are built today not on jesus christ's words right they're not they're built on a message or they're built on a denomination or they're built on a dogma amen you've got to know the word for yourself yeah try to go witness to somebody and say and and have a disagreement about a certain doctrinal concept or scriptural concept and say oh well but brother branham said they're going to look at you like you're crazy shall i admit you to palo verde i'll usher you personally are you crazy who is brother branham is that your brother is he a younger brother older brother who is they don't know who you're talking about right you got to talk about the word the scripture amen if you talk about the scripture the word then you've got something and you can prove to somebody in the word not the foundation to say oh brother branham said brother graham said what did jesus say i know jesus used brother brown to say don't get me wrong in him but the foundation can't be william branham it's got to be this word yes okay then you go to somebody if your foundation is built on him then you can go to anybody you want you know where you stand yes and that devil will come against you and it will not prevail because you know where you stand that's why brother branham so many times would take his bible and say i challenge any one of you to come stand here right now and show me in this bible where i'm wrong right and not one of them would do it why not because he knew the foundation he was standing on yes amen it wasn't on him it wasn't on wesley or any other prior ministry or message or whatever he was standing on jesus christ this word that's how he could challenge him because he knew in here where he stood that's what we must absolutely know that we stand in this word yes we obey the word we live the word we become the word it is our father but it has to start with that foundation if it's not that foundation friend then we're in trouble that's what jesus was trying to tell them here i am that foundation i am the one that this is built on on this rock the revelation of who jesus christ is he's not the third person of a godhead he's not the 10th or 12th person he is god almighty himself amen and that rock is the one that this church that we will be built on yes amen spiritual house is built on that who he is oh he's not he's not just one of a dozen he is god jesus christ is god he's the same yesterday today and forever yes he is praise the lord first peter let's go back first peter chapter 2. first peter i'm gonna close here in just a few minutes first peter chapter two verse chapter two verse nine or verse four excuse me four 429 now remember peter is the one that that just was just given the keys to the kingdom of heaven peter was the one who stood up this big mouth man who stood up and i say that because sometimes he got his foot in his mouth it was so big so but but when the lord gave revelation there was something there and and this and and this is the same man peter peter's the one that spoke up and said thou art the christ is none of the living gods now if as the catholic church says that church was built on peter as they call their first pope then why does peter say right here the man that they say it was built on say right here that that rock he was talking about was jesus let's read it to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious jesus christ ye also as lively stones ye also now praise the lord now we're transitioning ye also as lively stones or living stones or quickened been made alive by his spirit you as a holy ghost-filled christian lively stones are built up a spiritual house and a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ amen wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in zion a cheap cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded or prevail against or overcome or fall right or knocked down amen shall not be confounded you won't be shaken friend unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which uh which be disobedient disobedient to the word the stone which the builders disallowed the same as men that made the head of the corner which is the literal foundation the building block of a house the most important part and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and a holy nation of peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous life praise god the transition my friend is complete you have laid your foundation on jesus christ that solid rock and now you as a lively stone you who have been quickened you who had been made alive by his spirit who were once dead in sins and trespasses are now made a quickened lively stone a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people to show forth praises unto that foundation unto that capstone unto that rock to offer spiritual sacrifices to him amen now what is our position our position is to bring forth and show forth jesus christ as he is the same yesterday today and forever our lives are to be lived to manifest this word to a lost and dying world amen our position is to show that jesus is not dead people can do their zen gardens and their yogas and stuff all day long with all these other religions false gods i'll stick with the scripture i'll stick with the bible amen we went to a did a job the other day and this was a man of philosophy nice man nice couple had him a little buddha statue in his office setting there with a little little thing full of sand with this little rake oh god i'm thinking people have to go and and and forgive me i don't mean to but people have to do what they have to do to find peace in this earth right whatever they've got to do to find it that's up to them yes but i but my cry was thank you lord that i don't have to uh play in the sand to know i've got peace in my heart from the lord jesus amen praise god but you see it's gripping the world it really is yes it's all gone everywhere has anybody ever asked you have you got your zen on well that's what they're talking about that's buddha amen well i don't know about that but i got the holy spirit amen he gives me he is my peace amen breaking down every wall a couple that david said to us i'll close uh psalms 27 now this is the rapture scripture he said that brother van impe used in the rapture message the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear we spent 10 services going through this so we won't do it so much here today the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell why because their their building was on a wrong foundation yes amen you see now praise the lord though and host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear i will not stress i will not stumble i will not be swayed the war should rise against me in this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock yes amen praise the lord jesus one more psalm 61. psalm 61 verse 1 hear my cry o god attend to my prayer the end of the earth will i cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i for thou has been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy i will abide in thy tabernacle forever i will trust in the covet of thy wings salah praise the lord let's stand if we could so many times friends it seems the issues that people end up having they have different issues for different reasons people end up having issues in the message or they believe or don't believe their foundation wasn't laid properly it didn't dig down deep enough it happens a lot of times now don't get me wrong but it happens a lot of times to children who grow up in this message because they're just offspring of mom and daddy who were in the message and they just they grew up gnawing on the pew and falling asleep and living and growing up in the fuse and they don't ever get that experience for themselves they don't ever get they don't ever get to where they their parents dug down but the kids they just inherently are already there and they don't dig down to get for themselves to dig down to get to that foundation because see at that time their foundation is mom and daddy right and and that's denominational like we talked about last week oh why are you a methodist well my dad was a methodist my mama my grandchildren or my granddaddy my great-granddad for eight generations we've been catholic we've been baptist i'm a baptist because my daddy was a baptist and i see that's the nomination yes you're not in this message because mom and daddy was you've got to dig down that foundation yes you see it a lot of kids that are raised in this message you have to dig down into that foundation yourself amen don't put your foundation on mom and daddy yes your foundation has got to be in the in christ that solid rock i mean it's in it's in mom and daddy until you get to the age of accountability but there comes that time where you shed that and you've got to have christ for yourself as every individual has to do amen praise the lord let's sing this again i like this song i used

something by somebody who can actually sing you can go on the happy valley website i'm sure they have it on uh their music section there with brother donnie's singing it but i like it praise the lord and i worship the lord with it anyway it doesn't matter very much he's not worried about it the lord is not worried about it amen just the worship from our hearts yes he is bigger than all my problems he's a great big mighty god la roca amen he is the rock praise the lord make sure saints your foundation is on that rock amen solid face rock amen even in even in life we know that to be true yes amen that's why jesus used that as a metaphor even in life the god doesn't go down to that rock friend and you got problems amen people have spiritual problems because their foundation is not in that rock yes my help us lord amen thank you jesus god bless you prayed something said to bless you today amen what a wonderful god we serve amen remember the lord a couple weeks we'll have communion foot washing two weeks two weeks till easter you kind of tell because it's getting hot outside but uh i say hot i say that with tongue and cheek because it's gonna be in another month or so it's gonna be 110 and we'll wish it was this again but thank the lord uh he still watches over us and he blesses us but easter is in a couple of weeks so lord willing we'll um we'll observe the communion in foot washington on on that sunday we'll have a little message and even joy that uh community watching the lord give us so amen um haven't thought anymore well i have thought about it but i haven't made any more progress on trying to have a get-together dinner especially since uh craig has rented the place next door now so we can't use that i'm sure he probably has a place for us but he always keeps wanting to put me in one of those places upstairs up here and i didn't really want to have us to go up down the stairs and some of you may have trouble getting up the stairs i don't know but um so we'll just see maybe we'll just just get a place at a restaurant or something i don't know but if you have any ideas let me know i'd still like to do it have a fellowship together it's just nice when we have a room all to ourselves and it's just our room and we can just use it for us and fellowship and not have to worry about anybody maybe i just get the hotel room down here or a conference room or something maybe and we'll do it there but anyway we'll see how the lord provides but i still want you to know it's on my heart i like to do it i appreciate craig even told uh sounded like he was still doing it but y'all probably heard it but i walked in i've made friends with the worker here and talked to him about every time i come and he said that he would be done by the time we started service didn't sound like he was but but he said he said that craig told him to stop when we start service so i thought that was real nice that that the man who owns the place would tell his worker don't you work while they're having church so again it's not like he did but it was all right um he's got to do what he's got he's got a job to do and we got a job to do so praise the lord so god bless you today anyone have anything on your heart before we go you gotta pray in prayer and then turn the camera off yeah so thank you for reminding me love you god bless you appreciate you again god is good to us have a blessed week the lord provides uh provides us with more days we never know but whatever the lord gives i want to live for him amen amen look upon you to make sure our foundations are strong and that are built upon each and every day as we move forward we get more and just manifested in our life each and every day and others we speak up but we live in accordance with us as we get closer to your day of resurrection we ask that you with us as we exalt you higher than you've never met lord a
