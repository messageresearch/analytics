[39:30] she wanted a lamp for my dad I gave her
[39:33] that and then my Aunt Berta
[39:36] um
[39:37] she had all that an audible lamp the
[39:40] same way as my dad's
[39:42] and she got that
[39:44] and then my last Aunt here that just
[39:47] passed away and
[39:50] um
[39:51] perhaps that you took her home before
[39:54] she became very ill that's when it had
[39:57] her husband passed away and she saw a
[40:00] lamp she said oh I like that oil lamp
[40:03] she said what's my name
[40:07] is oh
[40:10] there's three oil lamps three is God's
[40:14] Perfection I will tell you the truth
[40:17] that I was watching this
[40:24] and that was a confirmation to me
[40:26] because I was talking in the with my
[40:28] earphones
[40:30] to my aunt
[40:31] the last of the stepsisters
[40:36] that um you know it's three lamps isn't
[40:39] that funny to learn from my steps
[40:45] and that was the confirmation to me this
[40:47] morning and everything amen you know
[40:50] that is good praise the Lord you know
[40:52] God answers our prayer we may not see
[40:54] yes and my aunt Anne and they were all
[40:58] Catholic and she's got out of there

[41:12] amen
[41:14] praise the Lord
[41:16] amen
[41:19] amen yes praise the Lord there's one
[41:23] thing that God is extremely well there's
[41:25] everything God's extremely good at one
[41:28] thing that comes to my mind God it's
[41:30] very very long-suffering and patient we
[41:33] want everything right now Lord I want
[41:36] them to say right this second and God
[41:38] said be patient
[41:40] I've got it under control that's the
[41:43] worst thing for us too it's hard for us
[41:46] to wait we want to see results right now
[41:47] and God says you know that Mountain's
[41:49] being moved it might be a grain of sand
[41:52] at a time but it's being moved
[41:56] praise the Lord he is never in a hurry
[41:58] amen anybody else
[42:01] uh
[42:05] I'm sure there are times and
[42:08] my brothers and sisters my faith
[42:12] they probably feel like I did this
[42:14] morning
[42:15] I
[42:18] I sometimes think about Lord why uh what
[42:22] can I do to you what is my calling
[42:25] uh
[42:27] I don't seem to be
[42:30] standing out or anything you know I
[42:33] don't have a
[42:35] forceful calling or something like that
[42:38] but I can do
[42:39] that I you know
[42:42] so there's a gentleman that lives down
[42:45] the street from us we live on a dirt
[42:47] road
[42:50] every Sunday morning this gentleman is
[42:52] sitting out of his yard
[42:55] and we wave at it as we go by and he
[42:57] knows where we're going
[43:00] well he was supposed to pass away a
[43:03] couple months ago years years and years
[43:06] ago wow
[43:07] and he looks so strong and healthy now
[43:11] you know
[43:12] and um if that's all I can do is go down
[43:15] the street and somebody know where I'm
[43:17] going yeah
[43:21] I can do that Lord amen amen
[43:26] I'm just thankful that he showed me that
[43:29] this morning yes
[43:33] amen
[43:35] he has to
[43:37] acknowledge yeah
[43:40] [Music]
[43:42] amen
[43:44] absolutely thank God for that Revelation
[43:50] like that but
[44:01] said everyone has a gift of some kind he
[44:05] said you may only use that gift one time
[44:07] in your entire life
[44:09] but everything else leads up to that and
[44:11] after that God may use and we always
[44:13] major on the ministry and uh or or
[44:16] singing and uh or speaking in tongues or
[44:20] prophecy or something but you know the
[44:22] gift of helps and government all those
[44:24] are just as important guy and like I
[44:26] said program said you male movies at one
[44:28] time in your entire life they just want
[44:30] to be one time
[44:31] amen I I still struggle to understand
[44:34] how it says good singers could come out
[44:36] of two people that couldn't carry a two
[44:38] in a tin bucket but I'm thankful that
[44:40] they got the gift anyway that's that's
[44:42] to make the most important thing to me
[44:44] I'm thankful the Lord is blessed but you
[44:47] know just something simple
[44:49] amen something simple that's all it has
[44:52] to be is to trust God live for him you
[44:55] know I've had I had a brother tell me
[44:56] one time several times I still don't
[44:59] know what I'm supposed to do I still
[45:00] don't know what my college I still don't
[45:01] know this that and the other and I said
[45:03] brother if you don't know what by now
[45:04] you just you're not going to know it
[45:06] because this was a brother that was
[45:08] very helpful
[45:10] it's always encouraging people he was
[45:13] always open in his home for people he
[45:14] was always giving people money he was
[45:16] always he was there to help people all
[45:18] the time if a visitor came into a church
[45:21] he would take him to lunch you're the
[45:24] first one to go to him hey I'm so and so
[45:27] uh how about I take you to lunch you got
[45:29] a place to stay and things like that and
[45:31] he doesn't know what his call is
[45:33] like how could you not but it but it's
[45:37] okay
[45:38] God knows and
[45:41] uh we just give our lives to him and he
[45:44] takes care of it the rest of the way so
[45:46] amen that's wonderful there's no way
[45:48] that man can acknowledge God
[45:51] and you're going to church every time
[45:54] anyone else
[45:59] not let's just stand to our feet if we
[46:01] could
[46:02] get to the word of God here I'm going to

[46:07] turn to uh Jude I want to go to the book
[46:10] of Jude amen and read a couple of verses
[46:13] of scripture out of here again to try to

[46:21] faith uh with the service today

[47:27] for our good because we love you Lord
[47:31] we thank you for this service for this
[47:33] time for all that you've done through it
[47:35] for us through the week Lord and
[47:37] blessing us and bringing us here Lord

[47:41] service now as we commit it to you we
[47:43] rebuke every demonic spirit that would
[47:45] try to hurt hinder and filtrate this
[47:46] service in any way that you get the
[47:49] glory and honor and praise for all that
[47:50] is said and done Lord we just thank you
[47:53] God for this word for a prophet for the
[47:56] revelation of this word to come into our
[47:58] hearts Lord to continue to bless us and
[48:02] to press us forward Lord into this
[48:05] battle that we're in Lord Lord Brother
[48:08] Tom mentioned about going through a mud
[48:10] puddle and not getting Mud On You Lord
[48:12] and it's just understanding in this
[48:14] world of what we go through and
[48:15] continuing to press this battle and
[48:17] continuing to press forward towards the
[48:19] mark of the high calling in you Lord
[48:22] Jesus and gorgeous service today is just
[48:25] a part of that and Lord as we've come I
[48:27] pray that your Holy Spirit once again
[48:29] would bless us and to move and with
[48:32] power and demonstration again Lord
[48:34] through the ministering of your word
[48:36] speak to us now Lord as we commit it to
[48:38] you anoint hearing speaker alike that
[48:41] what you'd have to be accomplished in
[48:42] this service today will be done as we
[48:45] commit it to you and ask your blessings
[48:46] upon it now in the name of the Lord
[48:47] Jesus Christ we pray amen
[48:52] book of Jude I'll read the first uh
[48:54] we'll read the verses three and four
[48:56] beloved when I gave all diligence to
[49:00] write unto you of the common salvation
[49:02] it was needful for me to write unto you
[49:05] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[49:08] contend for the faith which was once
[49:10] delivered unto the Saints for there are
[49:13] certain men crept in unawares who were
[49:16] before of old ordained to this
[49:19] condemnation
[49:20] ungodly men turning the grace of our God
[49:23] into lasciviousness denying the only
[49:26] Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ you
[49:29] could be seated if you like
[49:31] amen
[49:33] we know that is uh
[49:35] uh as people
[49:40] even would call the name of Jesus
[49:43] they still deny him even though they
[49:45] call on him or mention his name you say
[49:48] how is it possible that a person that
[49:51] calls on the name of Jesus
[49:53] would deny him
[49:55] well same way that Satan has called on
[49:59] Jesus and still denies him
[50:02] the only way to deny Jesus or the only
[50:05] way to receive Jesus I should say is to
[50:08] receive his word
[50:09] to receive his word is to obey his word
[50:12] to obey his word we have to have faith
[50:15] in his word the only way to have faith
[50:17] in his word is that we have faith from
[50:19] God to know that what this word says is
[50:22] God's unfailable word voice speaking to
[50:26] us and we know that we can be
[50:28] established and and steadfast in the
[50:32] word knowing that we're an obedient to
[50:34] Jesus Christ how do people deny Christ
[50:37] by denying his word how do they deny the
[50:40] word they don't have faith in the word
[50:42] how did Eve how did Eve deny the word
[50:45] because she didn't have faith in the
[50:47] word when something different came along
[50:49] she went away from the word to accept a
[50:52] lie based on one thing and that was the
[50:56] serpents through Satan through the
[50:58] serpents message to her that what God
[51:01] Said would not happen but that if you
[51:04] did what I said something greater would
[51:07] happen to you and that your eyes would
[51:09] come open you'd know what's good and
[51:11] evil and you be as God's and things and
[51:13] she denied God's word to receive a
[51:17] different word Satan's word and the only
[51:20] way to deny Christ is to receive
[51:23] something other than God's infallible uh
[51:27] uh word his his voice the word of God
[51:30] the revealed word of God to to deny the
[51:34] revealed word that we have for this day
[51:37] is to reject Jesus Christ amen to reject
[51:40] the word that Luther brought for
[51:42] Luther's day was to reject Christ you
[51:45] say but Luther didn't preach what
[51:46] brother random priests it wasn't his
[51:48] time was it his calling it wasn't for
[51:51] that age for that generation for those
[51:53] people but when those people believed
[51:56] what God brought through that man for
[51:58] that time they are just as much bright
[52:01] as you are but you have denied what he
[52:04] said was to reject the word how did that
[52:06] happen because people came in well the
[52:10] Bible specifically says men so will say
[52:13] men crept in and it's and you look at
[52:16] the degradation of society and I know
[52:18] brother Brown said you know the
[52:19] conditions the church look at the
[52:20] condition of the women but that only
[52:22] came because of the degradation of the
[52:24] man
[52:24] the man was the one that was the head
[52:26] the man was the one that was in charge
[52:27] the man's the one that forgive me blew
[52:30] it
[52:31] so you can look at the other side all
[52:33] you want but
[52:37] I look at the man who was had the
[52:41] position to take control over it and
[52:43] again I just used these true words he
[52:46] blew it
[52:47] amen so men come in crept in now how do
[52:52] they creep in they creep in by Looking
[52:54] Like You by sounding like you by saying
[52:57] the same things by looking the same way
[52:59] by singing the same songs but sitting
[53:02] next to you in the same church by
[53:03] getting involved in the same programs
[53:05] and everything else that's how they
[53:07] creep in otherwise if they don't do that
[53:10] how do they creep in you you you can't
[53:13] creep in unawares unless it's something
[53:15] that comes in looking exactly like the
[53:18] original looking exactly like the way
[53:21] that the scripture says or sounding the
[53:23] same way or acting the same way that's
[53:25] the only reason they can creep in
[53:27] unawares and they've crept in to do one
[53:31] thing the same thing that the serpent
[53:34] crept in to the Garden of Eden to defile
[53:37] Eve by it's the same way that they that
[53:41] they are defiled today by having
[53:43] relation to someone other than Jesus
[53:47] Christ who word to have relation to a
[53:51] defiled man-made uh uh word is is is is
[53:57] is adultery to God it's leaving the pure
[54:01] word of God
[54:02] so Judas giving an exhortation here he's
[54:06] saying that I'm I'm telling you that
[54:09] let me read it again I gave all
[54:11] diligence to write about the common
[54:13] salvation amen the common salvation
[54:17] it is nameful for me to write to you and
[54:20] exhort you exhort you that you earnestly
[54:23] contend for the Faith with which was
[54:26] once delivered earnestly contend for the
[54:30] faith what does that mean
[54:32] what does it mean to earnestly contend
[54:36] will simply put Earnest means to be
[54:39] Earnest is to be serious in your
[54:42] intention purpose or effort do earnestly
[54:46] means that you're serious about
[54:47] something you you you hold a zealousness
[54:51] about you that that brings you into a
[54:54] condition where you're not playing
[54:57] Church
[54:58] you're not putting on this isn't a
[55:01] facade
[55:02] there's no pretension here
[55:04] there's nothing pretend this is all real
[55:07] this is all true this is for my heart
[55:10] serious before God I'm not coming to
[55:13] church just to see what other people
[55:14] look like wearing who else is going to
[55:16] be there I'm not doing this just to try
[55:18] to put on a show to make other people
[55:20] think that I'm a Christian I do this
[55:22] because I'm zealous because I'm serious
[55:25] because I'm Earnest in what I believe
[55:28] what I'm doing is because of the earnest
[55:31] earnesty of my heart that I love the
[55:34] Lord serious in intention purpose effort
[55:37] an intense conviction
[55:39] your conviction is something that drives
[55:42] you your conviction is something that
[55:45] brings you from from point A to point B
[55:48] a conviction is something that that
[55:50] nobody should be able to dissuade you
[55:54] from you're going to press towards that
[55:57] Mark regardless of what anybody else or
[56:00] anything else or anywhere else nothing
[56:03] is going to stop me amen Paul said
[56:06] height death uh things present things to
[56:09] come Nothing's Gonna separate me from
[56:12] the love of God that's that is an
[56:14] earnestness that is a contention a
[56:16] conviction amen when you have a
[56:19] conviction that's something nobody can
[56:21] take away from you because it's
[56:23] something that you are determined to do
[56:25] you're Earnest in your in your drive to
[56:29] do this and your earnesty here is to
[56:32] contend
[56:33] you're going to condemn now what does
[56:36] contend mean well
[56:38] um
[56:39] brother random uh I believe talked about
[56:42] uh uh overcoming and he used boxing you
[56:47] know brother random would use boxing a
[56:48] few times as uh sort of as an allegory
[56:51] it was something that uh he used to do
[56:54] as a young man and he he still said he
[56:57] even enjoyed the sport of boxing
[56:58] although he said it had changed so much
[57:00] because Man became Guinea and one hit
[57:02] with the hand and his skull would
[57:04] crashing and things that's what he said
[57:06] he said now they wrap feather pillows
[57:09] around their hands and they still can't
[57:10] stand it but he enjoyed the sport of
[57:13] boxing so that was kind of an analogy
[57:15] that he would use and when when when
[57:18] someone has uh the heavyweight champion
[57:22] they had they hold the heavyweight title
[57:25] they are at the top of their profession
[57:29] uh they can't get any higher it's the
[57:33] number one position in that sport than
[57:35] you can attain to is to be the
[57:37] heavyweight champion of the world that
[57:40] was like the number one thing in boxing
[57:42] when I grew up even it was like it was
[57:44] like the top of the top Muhammad Ali he
[57:46] was celebrating still is celebrated to
[57:50] to the nth degree because he was the
[57:52] heavyweight champion of the world but
[57:54] they were people who felt they were just
[57:57] as capable of getting that Championship
[57:59] as he was so what did they do they
[58:03] wanted to get that from him and the only
[58:06] way to get it from him is to contend for
[58:08] it to fight him for it amen now you have
[58:13] something that the devil doesn't
[58:15] necessarily want but he doesn't want you
[58:18] to have it and that's faith in Jesus
[58:21] Christ he doesn't want it he'll never
[58:24] have it but he doesn't want you to have
[58:26] it regardless of whether he wants it or
[58:29] not in fact he would rather you not have
[58:31] it than than anything else so the
[58:35] contention begins to come because God's
[58:38] give you something you know you have
[58:40] something because you're a child of God
[58:42] you had that faith and Satan is going to
[58:46] come and contend for that he's going to
[58:48] fight you for every inch of ground that
[58:51] you gain in Jesus Christ you've had to
[58:53] fight for it you have to fight the devil
[58:56] every inch Satan place with your mind
[58:59] Satan place with your spirit you'll play
[59:02] with the people around you he'll play
[59:04] with your uh a mess with your your
[59:07] children or or your family or your your
[59:09] spouse or relatives whatever it is Satan
[59:12] will do uh your friends or or co-workers
[59:16] or or people that you know around he'll
[59:19] do anything to try to steal that Faith
[59:21] away from you that's why Jude said that
[59:24] you must earnestly contend
[59:28] it can't be a passing fancy friend
[59:30] there can be no say to no now God knows
[59:34] if you play in church but Satan does too
[59:38] Satan knows if you're pretentious Satan
[59:40] knows if you're just putting on a facade
[59:42] he knows that amen and that's exactly
[59:45] where he's going to hit you it's that
[59:47] place that you're weak is because you're
[59:49] just putting on church or pretending
[59:51] he's going to contend for that he's
[59:54] going to try to take it from you so what
[59:56] do we do well when Joe Frazier or George
[1:00:00] Foreman came up and challenged Muhammad
[1:00:01] Ali he didn't just stand there and let
[1:00:03] those guys beat him to a pulp he fought
[1:00:06] back
[1:00:07] he wanted to keep that prize he wanted
[1:00:10] to hold on to that Championship so he
[1:00:13] didn't just let those guys beat him up
[1:00:15] he fought back
[1:00:17] he beat him back don't just stand there
[1:00:19] and let the devil strip you of
[1:00:21] everything that he's trying to keep you
[1:00:22] from having you fight back you take back
[1:00:26] what belongs to you in fact don't even
[1:00:28] let him get it
[1:00:30] don't even let it say get I hear those
[1:00:32] songs all the time I'm going to take
[1:00:33] back what the devil stole don't let the
[1:00:35] devil take anything from you in the
[1:00:38] first place you should never have to
[1:00:40] take anything back
[1:00:42] contend fight for it fight for it Jude
[1:00:47] said earnestly content for what the
[1:00:48] faith content is to strive in rivalry
[1:00:52] rivalry or against difficulties
[1:00:56] to strive or to fight against opposing
[1:00:59] factions or the enemy
[1:01:02] to contend amen it's not like you're
[1:01:06] trying to necessarily pick a fight
[1:01:09] although if it's the devil I'm game
[1:01:12] but he's trying to take it from you
[1:01:15] so what do we do we take the fight to
[1:01:18] him
[1:01:18] how do you fight him every time you pick
[1:01:22] up your Bible and you read every time
[1:01:25] you get down and pray however you pray
[1:01:28] wherever you pray whenever it is if
[1:01:31] you're in your car you're just standing
[1:01:33] around whatever you Jesus stood in the
[1:01:35] middle of a crowd one day and looked up
[1:01:36] and said Lord and and started praying
[1:01:40] standing in the middle of a crowd
[1:01:41] doesn't matter where you're at right
[1:01:42] doesn't matter whether you're kneeling
[1:01:45] standing whatever you're doing setting
[1:01:47] the Bible says to pray without Cece
[1:01:50] that's contending every time you do that
[1:01:53] it's a black eye of the devil you take
[1:01:55] the fight to him every time you come to
[1:01:57] church every time you help somebody
[1:01:59] every time you you do something that's
[1:02:01] going to enhance the kingdom of God or
[1:02:05] or help bless somebody's life or to help
[1:02:08] make a difference in the world to do
[1:02:09] something good amen every time you do
[1:02:12] something Godly
[1:02:14] you're you're taking the fight to the
[1:02:16] devil
[1:02:17] but the devil is there to strip it from
[1:02:20] you to take it from you and say and
[1:02:23] friends let me tell you Satan is winning
[1:02:25] the battle in this world
[1:02:27] amen he's winning the battle in this
[1:02:29] world you know why because this world
[1:02:31] belongs to him
[1:02:33] this world Cosmos belongs to the devil
[1:02:36] but let's look and talk about this just
[1:02:39] for a moment on on this true Faith
[1:02:41] before I get to a couple of points that
[1:02:43] I want to say uh Romans chapter 10
[1:02:56] amen
[1:03:04] Romans chapter 10.
[1:03:06] we'll begin with verse 14.
[1:03:09] it's all a very familiar scripture to us
[1:03:11] but when you look around and we spent a
[1:03:15] we spent a quite a few services on our
[1:03:17] new beginning and and going through
[1:03:19] teaching that
[1:03:21] but it comes to time Saints where I I
[1:03:24] personally
[1:03:26] uh as Pastor feel compelled to uh to
[1:03:30] bring something to encourage our faith
[1:03:33] I know personally
[1:03:36] it helps me
[1:03:38] I know personally it strengthens me
[1:03:40] when the Lord begins to speak to me or
[1:03:43] speak to me through his word or through
[1:03:44] a message I'm listening to about faith
[1:03:47] and if you listen to the messages the
[1:03:49] tapes as much as I do you'll hear
[1:03:51] Brother Brown talk about faith and
[1:03:53] pretty much every single tape right
[1:03:55] every service of course when he has
[1:03:57] prayer lines and all that's the main
[1:04:00] focus the main focus of a prayer line
[1:04:03] service is Faith of course but uh but
[1:04:05] even in the teaching services and things
[1:04:08] it all boils around to Faith why faith
[1:04:11] is the foundation of that statue of a
[1:04:13] perfect man
[1:04:14] if you don't have faith you're never
[1:04:16] going to go anywhere with Christ how can
[1:04:19] you believe how can you know there's a
[1:04:20] godliness you believe in him unless you
[1:04:22] have faith but now look this faith that
[1:04:24] we're talking about
[1:04:27] Romans chapter 10 verse 14.
[1:04:30] how then shall we call on him and whom
[1:04:33] they have not believed
[1:04:36] and how shall they believe in him of
[1:04:39] whom they have not heard and how shall
[1:04:42] they hear without a preacher
[1:04:44] and how shall they preach except they be
[1:04:47] sent and as it is written now how
[1:04:52] beautiful are the feet of them that
[1:04:54] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[1:04:56] Glad Tidings of good things now
[1:04:58] I want you to notice something that
[1:05:01] we're going to separate here and and
[1:05:03] there's a couple of things I want to
[1:05:05] talk about that
[1:05:07] in fact let me just finish reading verse
[1:05:09] 16. uh but they have not all obeyed the
[1:05:12] gospel for Isaiah said uh Lord who hath
[1:05:16] believed our report so then Faith cometh
[1:05:18] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:05:20] God now
[1:05:22] the first verse that we read here in the
[1:05:25] last verse we read here bookend
[1:05:27] everything else that Paul was talking
[1:05:30] about in this short little statement in
[1:05:32] in to the Roman Church this small little
[1:05:35] statement the begin was whosoever called
[1:05:39] the uh no 14th verse how then shall they
[1:05:42] call on him and whom they have not
[1:05:44] believed believed
[1:05:47] and how how do you believe
[1:05:50] with faith only way to believe something
[1:05:52] is have faith
[1:05:53] and how shall they believe in him and
[1:05:55] who they have not heard that's the word
[1:05:59] amen faith in the word
[1:06:02] uh have not heard and how shall they
[1:06:04] hear without a preacher someone ordained
[1:06:08] to bring by God the pure unadulterated
[1:06:11] word of God
[1:06:13] amen
[1:06:14] and how shall they preach except they be
[1:06:17] sent you say there's a lot of preachers
[1:06:19] out there today but what are they doing
[1:06:21] are they sent because only a preacher
[1:06:25] he's talking about in this word here is
[1:06:28] one that is bringing the pure
[1:06:30] unadulterated word of their hour amen
[1:06:33] not just somebody that interjects
[1:06:35] something from a seminary or their own
[1:06:37] ideas or their own opinions or their own
[1:06:39] way of seeing or looking at something no
[1:06:42] is to bring the pure unadulterated word
[1:06:46] that's the only qualification that a
[1:06:49] preacher has to know that that that
[1:06:52] person is bringing God in fact
[1:06:54] that is the only way to me as I read
[1:06:58] this the only way that a person a man
[1:07:02] could be qualified
[1:07:04] or Quantified or referred to as a
[1:07:08] preacher
[1:07:10] somebody I've said this many many times
[1:07:12] friendly but just because a man has the
[1:07:15] gift of Gavin is comfortable standing in
[1:07:16] front of people does not make him a
[1:07:18] preacher right amen it might make him a
[1:07:20] decent politician yeah but it won't make
[1:07:23] him a preacher
[1:07:24] how is the preacher preach unless he
[1:07:27] sent a preacher does not
[1:07:30] other people may there may be people out
[1:07:32] there who Pastor churches or whatever I
[1:07:34] don't know that's up to them that's
[1:07:36] between them and God I'm not thinking of
[1:07:37] anybody I'm not calling anybody out I
[1:07:39] just know it exists because the word
[1:07:41] says it does
[1:07:43] that's the only reason I know it exists
[1:07:45] because the word says it exists Jude
[1:07:48] just told us that it exists so what is a
[1:07:52] preacher what what quantifies a man in
[1:07:55] Paul's eyes here in Romans as a preacher
[1:07:58] someone who delivers and brings to
[1:08:00] people the pure unadulterated word of
[1:08:04] God
[1:08:05] end of story nothing added nothing taken
[1:08:09] away nothing changed nothing altered
[1:08:12] it's the pure word of God and God only
[1:08:15] not man's ideas not man's opinion but
[1:08:18] what God said that's the only thing that
[1:08:20] quantifies the preacher so when it says
[1:08:23] the preacher has to be sent it doesn't
[1:08:25] mean somebody that's out just preaching
[1:08:27] their denominations belief or doctrine
[1:08:29] or whatever no that's not a preacher
[1:08:31] amen a preacher someone that brings the
[1:08:34] word pure word of God which book ends
[1:08:37] now the 17th verse so then Faith come by
[1:08:41] hearing hearing what the word of God
[1:08:45] from whom a sent preacher not somebody
[1:08:50] that's just out preaching whatever they
[1:08:52] think whatever they want to whatever
[1:08:53] their Seminary told them to preach no
[1:08:55] what the word of God the pure
[1:08:58] unadulterated word of God says that's
[1:09:01] where faith comes from That's How faith
[1:09:03] is built that's how Faith grows Faith
[1:09:07] cometh by hearing and hearing the word
[1:09:10] of God
[1:09:12] not hearing somebody's opinion about it
[1:09:14] but the word of God look now he says how
[1:09:18] can they be uh and how shall they preach
[1:09:21] except they be sent it is written how
[1:09:23] beautiful are the feet of them that
[1:09:25] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[1:09:26] Glad Tidings and good things but now
[1:09:28] look what he says in the 16th verse he
[1:09:30] said but
[1:09:31] they have not all obeyed the gospel
[1:09:35] they well who is he just talking about
[1:09:39] preachers
[1:09:41] they have not all obeyed
[1:09:45] the gospel
[1:09:46] amen and even if it isn't just preachers
[1:09:49] it would qualify for anybody that
[1:09:52] doesn't believe the word of God that is
[1:09:55] not enhanced or or helped blessed by the
[1:09:58] word of God edified by the word of God
[1:10:01] then who are these people they have not
[1:10:03] obeyed the gospel that takes us back to
[1:10:06] what we just talked about a minute ago
[1:10:08] oh believing and obeying are two
[1:10:11] different things
[1:10:12] amen you say brother nude
[1:10:16] the Bible says if you believe well
[1:10:18] Satan believes but he does not obey
[1:10:22] amen there's a big difference in
[1:10:24] believing in something and obeying
[1:10:26] something
[1:10:27] amen when you obey then that brings you
[1:10:30] into the category of that faith and
[1:10:33] one's Faith look now one's Faith the
[1:10:36] pure Faith now we're going to talk about
[1:10:37] in the context that Paul's preaching and
[1:10:39] one's faith that Faith he's talking
[1:10:42] about has by the word of God has found
[1:10:44] its place in you has found this place in
[1:10:48] that individual you must fight for that
[1:10:51] every single day
[1:10:54] you must fight because at that moment
[1:10:57] it's the moment that Satan begins to
[1:10:59] send his minions out to destroy you to
[1:11:01] take it from you to do any needs he
[1:11:04] possibly can he'll use any device he can
[1:11:07] possibly use say to use the serpent to
[1:11:09] defale Eve
[1:11:10] what makes you think Satan isn't using
[1:11:13] other people to do the same thing
[1:11:17] amen
[1:11:18] people around you maybe there's men
[1:11:21] that's tripped in unawares maybe there's
[1:11:24] ministering of of something other than
[1:11:27] the word oh I believe brother Banner
[1:11:30] meant this you know I'm not you know me
[1:11:32] I'm not interested in what you think
[1:11:34] brother Branham meant
[1:11:36] amen
[1:11:37] now in context to the word
[1:11:41] because what brother Branham preached
[1:11:43] came from this word yes amen and if your
[1:11:46] interpretation or your definition of
[1:11:50] what brother random said preached
[1:11:52] doesn't match up with this word from
[1:11:54] Genesis 1 to revelation 22 then there's
[1:11:57] nothing wrong with this and there's
[1:11:59] nothing wrong with him or that message
[1:12:02] the problem lies with you
[1:12:04] or me
[1:12:06] or whatever it may be
[1:12:07] amen and there's the contention the
[1:12:11] contention that Satan comes against that
[1:12:13] pure belief and Jude says we must
[1:12:16] earnestly contend for that faith
[1:12:19] because these have come in and this
[1:12:21] isn't unprecedented we know this Saints
[1:12:24] let's go to uh Matthew just for a minute
[1:12:26] Matthew chapter uh
[1:12:29] oh well with Matthew chapter 7.
[1:12:35] two scriptures
[1:12:37] that I want to share with you
[1:12:40] Jesus said one and Paul said the other
[1:12:43] I mean two great authorities be number
[1:12:46] one Authority obviously Jesus Christ and
[1:12:49] Paul
[1:12:51] speaking to us look now Matthew 7 verse
[1:12:55] 13.
[1:12:58] enter ye in at the Straight Gate for
[1:13:01] wide is the gate and Broad is the way
[1:13:03] that leaded to destruction and many
[1:13:05] there be which go therein
[1:13:08] their act because straight is the gay
[1:13:11] and narrow is the way which leadeth unto
[1:13:14] life and few there be that find it
[1:13:17] be aware of false prophets which come to
[1:13:21] you in sheets clothing there we go jeans
[1:13:23] clothing what does that mean they come
[1:13:25] in looking just like you sounding just
[1:13:27] like acting just like setting maybe
[1:13:30] maybe and I don't mean here but sitting
[1:13:33] right next to you
[1:13:34] amen
[1:13:36] in sheep's clothing so they look just
[1:13:39] like you
[1:13:40] but inwardly they are ravening wolves
[1:13:45] ye shall know them by their fruits you
[1:13:48] men gather grapes or Thorns or figs or
[1:13:52] of thistles even so every good tree
[1:13:55] bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt
[1:13:57] free bringeth forth corrupt I bringeth
[1:13:59] forth evil fruit but look
[1:14:02] it can happen
[1:14:04] where that comes in like sheep's
[1:14:07] clothing can look just like sound just
[1:14:10] alike
[1:14:12] um
[1:14:14] if you've got the holy spirit in that
[1:14:16] and that level of discernment that comes
[1:14:18] with that Holy Spirit friend is not
[1:14:20] deceiving to you
[1:14:22] I I I I have known people
[1:14:26] I have been around people I have rubbed
[1:14:28] shoulders ministers
[1:14:30] that
[1:14:31] you held in esteem as a colleague is a
[1:14:35] brother uh
[1:14:38] and they they sound the part they look
[1:14:41] the part they play the part everything
[1:14:43] about you would think that person
[1:14:46] but there's just something in there that
[1:14:50] that brings a question mark into your
[1:14:53] spirit
[1:14:56] I've done that before do I treat that
[1:14:58] person any different no
[1:15:00] I I by God's grace and I I stand before
[1:15:03] him today I would like to think praying
[1:15:05] Lord I've never treated anybody that I
[1:15:08] felt that way differently
[1:15:10] but on down the road 10 15 20 years
[1:15:13] later all of a sudden something happens
[1:15:15] and that person's gone
[1:15:17] they're preaching something off the word
[1:15:20] denouncing the message altogether
[1:15:24] and you know there was something that
[1:15:26] was in there 20 years ago this in
[1:15:29] your spirit that just didn't seem right
[1:15:34] the bride cannot be deceived no
[1:15:38] no amen she cannot be deceived
[1:15:41] there can be a time where
[1:15:44] there might be a going along
[1:15:47] before they they're before they come to
[1:15:51] the realization that what they're doing
[1:15:54] where they're going what they're
[1:15:55] listening to is not right because they
[1:15:58] will not be the bride cannot be deceived
[1:16:00] but remember
[1:16:02] the serpent Satan to the serpent brought
[1:16:05] to Eve 99 word
[1:16:09] amen 99 percent
[1:16:12] I've had people in
[1:16:14] come to me I tell them you know I I know
[1:16:18] this person just be careful I know how
[1:16:20] they believe
[1:16:22] well I've I've been going to church here
[1:16:24] six months and I've never heard him say
[1:16:26] anything about that I said just I'm just
[1:16:28] telling you just I know this person
[1:16:30] personally I know what they believe just
[1:16:33] be careful that's that's all I can tell
[1:16:35] you just be careful amen and maybe not
[1:16:40] long after that or something
[1:16:42] uh not only is what that person preached
[1:16:44] gonna be influenced by what they believe
[1:16:46] about it amen like I've told you many
[1:16:49] times people uh go to a nominal church
[1:16:51] or something and and if that's the
[1:16:53] Nugget they can get then you know that
[1:16:56] that's that's up to them but I I'd say
[1:16:59] these nominal churches out here they're
[1:17:01] they're 95 plus percent trinitarian
[1:17:05] yeah
[1:17:06] well I never heard him preach about that
[1:17:09] doesn't matter every single thing that
[1:17:11] man is preaching is going to be
[1:17:13] influenced by his belief that there's
[1:17:15] three Gods right it has to be yeah and
[1:17:20] and I say that by experience because I
[1:17:22] know that whatever the Lord gives me it
[1:17:25] has to run through this thinking man's
[1:17:27] filter
[1:17:28] it has to go through this filter
[1:17:31] and in this filter it tells me whether
[1:17:34] it's right wrong whatever this filter
[1:17:37] says
[1:17:38] amen and that's what I have to follow
[1:17:40] and if it's outside of that then
[1:17:43] then it can't be right
[1:17:46] and that's when you begin to contend and
[1:17:48] say
[1:17:50] when I do that when I personally preach
[1:17:54] something I look through the eyes the
[1:17:56] lens of the true godhead
[1:18:01] whatever your belief is that's what you
[1:18:02] believe
[1:18:03] oh that's that's that's going to be
[1:18:06] Seasons with what their belief is I've
[1:18:09] said that before and you know that let's
[1:18:12] go to Paul because my time's getting
[1:18:14] away uh Paul Acts chapter 20.
[1:18:20] there's no law Acts chapter 20.
[1:18:25] we just read Matthew 7 uh where Jesus
[1:18:29] said that to beware of false prophets
[1:18:31] that come in sheep's clothing
[1:18:33] look what Paul says in Acts chapter 20.
[1:18:41] Acts chapter 20 verse 26.
[1:18:44] wherefore I take you to record this day
[1:18:47] that I am pure from the blood of all men
[1:18:51] for I have not Shone to declare unto you
[1:18:53] all the counsel of God not all the
[1:18:57] Council of Paul not all the Council of
[1:19:00] Barnabas or anyone else all the counsel
[1:19:03] of God
[1:19:04] what he received from God he gave as of
[1:19:09] God
[1:19:10] to those that that he witnessed to
[1:19:13] I have not shown to declare unto you all
[1:19:16] the counsel take heed therefore unto
[1:19:19] yourselves and to all the flock over the
[1:19:21] which the Holy Ghost has made you
[1:19:23] overseers to feed the Church of God
[1:19:26] which he hath purchased with his own
[1:19:29] blood
[1:19:31] for I know this
[1:19:34] look what Paul says oh I know this
[1:19:39] that after my departing shall Grievous
[1:19:42] wolves enter in among you not sparing
[1:19:46] the flock
[1:19:48] yeah Paul said I know
[1:19:51] amen now I didn't pull the quote but you
[1:19:53] know brother Branham said approximately
[1:19:54] the same thing that upon his departure
[1:19:57] that there would be Grievous wolves come
[1:19:59] in
[1:20:00] not godly and now how do they come in
[1:20:04] they come in in sheep's clothing they
[1:20:07] come in saying the same thing acting the
[1:20:10] same way yes
[1:20:11] playing the same part because to them
[1:20:14] there's no earnesty it's it's the
[1:20:17] pretension to try to fit in
[1:20:20] it's someone remember I told you God has
[1:20:23] patience you know who else has patience
[1:20:25] the devil
[1:20:27] the devil has patience he doesn't care
[1:20:29] how long it takes to get you his
[1:20:31] ultimate end goal is to get you
[1:20:34] he doesn't care how who he has to use
[1:20:36] what channels he has to go through and
[1:20:39] he's very patient to make sure
[1:20:41] regardless of what he's going to get you
[1:20:43] and when he sees a little when he sees a
[1:20:46] little change
[1:20:47] when he sees a person it's not as
[1:20:49] dedicated or consecrated to the Lord or
[1:20:52] praying or reading or whatever it is in
[1:20:54] your life and all that we consider that
[1:20:56] we do that he that's Victory to them
[1:21:00] Satan that is Victory amen but Paul
[1:21:03] tells us I know that Grievous walls are
[1:21:07] going to come in brother man said the
[1:21:08] same thing I know that Grievous wolves
[1:21:10] are going to come in have they come in
[1:21:13] absolutely thank you
[1:21:16] absolutely by
[1:21:20] a large portion
[1:21:23] it's our time it's our place to
[1:21:26] earnestly contend for that faith that
[1:21:29] was once given never
[1:21:31] Jude said it was once delivered to the
[1:21:34] Saints
[1:21:35] and we know that was to be and and it
[1:21:38] was delivered at the day of Pentecost
[1:21:40] and what happened it all fell apart and
[1:21:41] went through but what was to happen in
[1:21:43] this day there was to be a restoration a
[1:21:47] turning of the hearts of the children
[1:21:48] the faith back to the fathers amen us
[1:21:52] the children the Faith of Our Fathers
[1:21:56] turned back Amen to be restored once
[1:22:00] again to what the word
[1:22:02] the truth of God's word the pure
[1:22:05] unadulterated word God sent a man a
[1:22:09] prophet to bring that word to us
[1:22:12] contending for that Faith himself
[1:22:15] insane
[1:22:17] they're going to do the same thing as
[1:22:19] they deal with Paul I'm paraphrasing
[1:22:21] obviously
[1:22:22] you must contend for that faith fight
[1:22:25] for every inch of ground Saints and look
[1:22:28] at this world around us
[1:22:31] look at this world around us I saw some
[1:22:33] statistics the other day and these
[1:22:35] statistics just
[1:22:37] didn't surprise me but
[1:22:41] floored me just
[1:22:43] and that's not the right it it Grieves
[1:22:45] me
[1:22:47] I saw that these statistics
[1:22:51] because remember everything about life
[1:22:54] everything almost everything about life
[1:22:57] everything about this Cosmos that we
[1:23:00] live in
[1:23:01] is is against faith
[1:23:05] you know that pretty much everything in
[1:23:07] this Cosmos today
[1:23:09] greats against your faith
[1:23:13] the world teaches don't believe it if
[1:23:16] you can't see it touch it feel it they
[1:23:19] come against anything and everything
[1:23:21] that is of faith
[1:23:23] amen of course there's
[1:23:25] not not only now do we have hospitals
[1:23:28] pretty much everywhere but now they have
[1:23:31] and I'm not again against hospitals I'm
[1:23:33] just for Christ
[1:23:35] man that's like a lot of people say uh
[1:23:38] you know they're against brother
[1:23:40] so-and-so or sister so and so look I'm
[1:23:42] not against anybody I'm just for Jesus
[1:23:46] and if me being for Jesus
[1:23:49] comes in contrast to somebody else
[1:23:51] whether and so be it but I'm not going
[1:23:53] to lead the ground of being for Jesus
[1:23:55] even if that puts me in contrast to
[1:23:58] somebody else
[1:23:59] so I'm not against the hospitals I'm
[1:24:02] just pro-jesus I'm pro-divine healing
[1:24:05] I'm Pro miracles amen are you
[1:24:09] amen hospitals are good medicine's good
[1:24:12] doctor's good but now you got not only
[1:24:14] the hospitals around but you got urgent
[1:24:16] cares daughter descend the landscape
[1:24:18] everywhere
[1:24:20] urgent cares all over the place
[1:24:22] Doctors Hospitals everything everything
[1:24:26] that goes against our faith
[1:24:31] what is this world teaching us
[1:24:34] everything pretty much to say everything
[1:24:37] about this world is teaching us to
[1:24:40] disbelieve God
[1:24:42] and to not have faith in God
[1:24:45] look
[1:24:46] the statistics I saw the other day
[1:24:49] they just they were very discouraging I
[1:24:52] I just gotta admit uh I I don't let it
[1:24:55] get me down because we understand the
[1:24:57] world that we live in
[1:25:00] I think they gave four or five
[1:25:01] categories
[1:25:03] one of them was patriotism
[1:25:06] the patriotism in this country I mean
[1:25:08] when I was a kid it was you know you
[1:25:12] went to elementary school you did two
[1:25:14] things you prayed and you said the
[1:25:16] Pledge of Allegiance yes
[1:25:18] yes where's it gone
[1:25:20] they took out the Bible prayer and got
[1:25:22] out of schools and they replaced it with
[1:25:24] hatred guns and violence
[1:25:27] they wonder why this has happened
[1:25:30] they said well we take God out you
[1:25:32] introduce violence you take love out you
[1:25:35] introduce hatred that's the bottom line
[1:25:38] of it
[1:25:39] the media is celebrating
[1:25:42] and pretending that this girl that went
[1:25:45] in to shoot these kids up is now the
[1:25:48] victim yeah please
[1:25:51] I'm sorry this that person may have run
[1:25:54] across people that were very rude and
[1:25:56] mean or something but a true Christian
[1:26:00] a true God Holy Ghost feel Godly
[1:26:04] Christian is the only place that any of
[1:26:06] these people anybody can find love today
[1:26:10] true love yes
[1:26:12] yes amen the other worlds he said oh
[1:26:14] it's okay you know you're you're fine
[1:26:16] everything's fine that's not love
[1:26:19] is I want you to make it to Heaven
[1:26:21] regardless That's My Hope and prayer is
[1:26:25] that you make it to heaven
[1:26:28] that's true love
[1:26:30] amen now now that person is the victim
[1:26:34] not the three little children not the
[1:26:37] three adults that were killed but the
[1:26:39] one that murdered them is now the victim
[1:26:42] now explain that to me
[1:26:44] they took out gun they took out God
[1:26:47] prayer patriotism Pledge of Allegiance
[1:26:51] replace it with what violence death guns
[1:26:54] hatred
[1:26:56] when you take God out what do you have
[1:26:58] left
[1:26:59] that's all you have left patriotism has
[1:27:02] dropped from like in the seven and this
[1:27:04] is just in the past 20 years I think it
[1:27:06] was has dropped from like 76 percent to
[1:27:08] below 50 percent
[1:27:10] for the country how do you think people
[1:27:14] what people think about this country oh
[1:27:16] it used to be considered the greatest
[1:27:18] country on earth a lot of people still
[1:27:20] believe it that way there are a lot of
[1:27:22] people that live in this country now
[1:27:24] that do not aspire to that
[1:27:27] amen amen if we really went to a war
[1:27:30] with a with a superpower
[1:27:34] if China Russia
[1:27:36] decided to get together and and pick up
[1:27:38] arms even though they hate each other
[1:27:41] but you know the enemy the any of my the
[1:27:43] enemy of my enemy is my friend
[1:27:46] even though they hate each other they
[1:27:48] believe in one thing they have a common
[1:27:50] goal of communism
[1:27:51] if they got together and joined their
[1:27:53] forces we'd have no chance
[1:27:55] amen and that may who knows that may be
[1:27:58] what happens to make the prophecy
[1:28:00] brother round border to border Coast to
[1:28:02] Coast
[1:28:03] destroyed
[1:28:05] amen it's down look we wouldn't we
[1:28:08] wouldn't be able to get enough people to
[1:28:10] fight no
[1:28:11] there wouldn't be enough young men to to
[1:28:13] take our arms to fight against them
[1:28:15] right Faith down from again in the 70s
[1:28:21] to like 30 some percent drop 40 points
[1:28:24] in just 20 years or so
[1:28:26] Faith down

[1:28:47] founded on
[1:28:48] down below 50 in the 30s or something
[1:28:51] some real low number
[1:28:54] of this country
[1:28:56] but you know the one thing that is up
[1:28:58] that people consider of importance this
[1:29:01] is if I didn't say so this is a list of
[1:29:03] the things that people consider
[1:29:05] important now in their lives
[1:29:07] they don't consider patriotism important
[1:29:10] they don't consider Faith Family Values
[1:29:12] getting married having children uh
[1:29:15] having morals in their lives that's not
[1:29:17] of any importance to them anymore but
[1:29:19] you know the one thing that is up in
[1:29:21] importance in people's lives I probably
[1:29:23] don't have to say it you know what it's
[1:29:24] gonna know what I'm gonna say
[1:29:26] money
[1:29:28] money is one category that's now above
[1:29:31] 50 of importance in people's lives they
[1:29:35] consider filthy looker more important
[1:29:38] than patriotism Faith morals Family
[1:29:41] Values
[1:29:42] money
[1:29:43] that's what it's all become about today
[1:29:46] amen money

[1:29:51] kneels on a football field in protests
[1:29:55] of the national anthem in the American
[1:29:56] flag and he celebrated as some great
[1:29:59] hero
[1:30:01] another man on the high school football
[1:30:03] field kneels in prayer and they arrest
[1:30:06] him

[1:30:45] wanted that man in Canada

[1:30:55] cocktails he's not burning anything he's
[1:30:57] not shooting or looting he's just
[1:30:59] standing there in silent prayer and
[1:31:01] protest and they arrested him and jail
[1:31:04] just for standing on the street corner
[1:31:08] they have drag stories drag queens
[1:31:10] stories in public libraries for children
[1:31:14] and they're celebrated
[1:31:16] this man I talked about the other day
[1:31:18] Kirk Cameron come out with a children's
[1:31:19] book about God and values and and and
[1:31:23] morality and
[1:31:26] there's only a handful of libraries
[1:31:27] across this country he could even get
[1:31:29] into to try to to bring it
[1:31:31] people hate him
[1:31:34] put him out won't let him do it drag
[1:31:36] stories oh yeah sure they're having
[1:31:41] the Congress
[1:31:42] approached the heads of military and
[1:31:46] said why is our military
[1:31:48] uh men and women subject to these drag
[1:31:51] shows and their children and one of them
[1:31:53] spoke up and said I didn't even know
[1:31:55] that was going on
[1:31:56] you're a five-star general in charge of
[1:31:59] the military and you didn't even know
[1:32:01] this was happening
[1:32:04] it's sad print but that's where we've
[1:32:06] gotten to
[1:32:07] they're more concerned about what
[1:32:09] adjective or what pronoun they call you
[1:32:12] instead of how to load a gun or defeat
[1:32:14] an enemy or to
[1:32:16] do anything our military should be
[1:32:18] trained to do
[1:32:20] if you want to learn a pronoun I don't
[1:32:22] care that's fine
[1:32:24] if you want to be called him heard they
[1:32:26] them that's up to you I don't
[1:32:29] I I we live in a free world-free Society
[1:32:32] during coven
[1:32:34] casinos and all kinds of places like
[1:32:36] that were allowed to stay open but the
[1:32:38] churches had to remain closed do you
[1:32:40] remember that
[1:32:41] amen even people even during that time
[1:32:45] there were churches and pastors arrested
[1:32:47] because they insisted on having church
[1:32:49] services
[1:32:51] amen thank God lord allowed nothing ever
[1:32:54] like that King does
[1:32:55] but they were arrested
[1:32:58] made to stay closed why
[1:33:00] because everything about this world is
[1:33:03] going away from that
[1:33:05] Jude says content
[1:33:08] friend we have to fight I'm not saying
[1:33:10] fight the government I'm not saying
[1:33:11] fight the police I'm not but fight the
[1:33:14] devil yeah yes because that is the
[1:33:17] bottom line to all of this
[1:33:20] they stand
[1:33:21] and they scream and yell at what's
[1:33:24] coming in the front door as they're
[1:33:25] sneaking in the back
[1:33:27] and a lot of people don't realize it
[1:33:29] that's why you have to have on the whole
[1:33:31] armor of God and contend
[1:33:34] contend for the faith
[1:33:37] is Satan is not just going to give up
[1:33:40] and let you have it
[1:33:42] he's not he's not just gonna go away
[1:33:45] we have to contend every day how do we
[1:33:48] contend
[1:33:49] put on your boxing gloves of faith
[1:33:51] amen
[1:33:53] put on the whole armor of God fight him
[1:33:56] defeat him with the only Weaponry but
[1:33:59] the best Weaponry The Undefeated
[1:34:01] Weaponry of the scripture
[1:34:04] amen Faith that's who Christ is Christ
[1:34:08] is the word
[1:34:10] all these things of the world that's
[1:34:12] happening all around us it's sad to
[1:34:15] watch like I said when I was a kid
[1:34:17] going to elementary school
[1:34:19] first thing in the morning you've prayed
[1:34:21] and you said the Pledge of Allegiance
[1:34:23] yes standing with your hand over your
[1:34:25] heart
[1:34:26] amen yes that's that that was normal you
[1:34:31] could have a Bible very few kids I
[1:34:34] remember in school had one you could
[1:34:36] have a Bible on your desk or inside your
[1:34:38] desk
[1:34:39] carry it with you
[1:34:41] amen now you're kicked out if you do
[1:34:44] something like that they won't let you
[1:34:46] they'll expel you if you try to bring a
[1:34:48] Bible into school now
[1:34:50] maybe not all of them but it's gotten to
[1:34:53] the place that
[1:34:54] I'm thankful my son-in-law and daughter
[1:34:56] are able to take care of their children
[1:34:58] without having to send them to these
[1:35:00] places because I I tell you just makes
[1:35:03] you wonder what all of these programs
[1:35:05] and things are indoctrinating the kids
[1:35:06] today
[1:35:08] and the programs that they go through to
[1:35:10] to make them think this is okay
[1:35:13] teachers get on uh different things and
[1:35:16] and they won't let them say pledge of
[1:35:18] allegiance to the American flag but she
[1:35:20] said but I got a flag I'll have them
[1:35:22] that they can pledge allegiance to and
[1:35:24] the camera spans over to the rainbow
[1:35:26] flag
[1:35:28] they can pledge allegiance to that
[1:35:31] contend
[1:35:33] amen contend that is a part of
[1:35:37] contending I know it's I I I can
[1:35:40] guarantee it's not easy for my daughter
[1:35:42] and and my son-in-law to do what they do
[1:35:45] to take care of their children that's
[1:35:46] hard right they're missing a whole other
[1:35:49] income that my that my daughter could
[1:35:50] get possibly if she put them in daycare
[1:35:54] or in public school or something like
[1:35:56] that but they're contending you've got
[1:35:58] to contend to hold that Faith to hold
[1:36:00] that line
[1:36:01] and they're responsible for holding that
[1:36:03] line for their children as much as
[1:36:05] themselves that's a hard thing to do
[1:36:07] you've had to do it as well we had to do
[1:36:09] it as well with them
[1:36:12] things have changed even from when they
[1:36:14] were there but we can continuously
[1:36:16] contend for that faith
[1:36:18] amen because that's that's the thing
[1:36:21] that keeps us going amen that's the
[1:36:23] thing that keeps us afloat praise the
[1:36:25] Lord Victory Is Ours
[1:36:28] Victory Is Ours in Jesus Christ
[1:36:31] amen who has made Us Victorious he has
[1:36:34] conquered death hell in the grave and
[1:36:36] everything that's in between
[1:36:38] he gave us the keys now we stand
[1:36:42] victorious in Jesus name he took our
[1:36:44] place so that we can take his now let's
[1:36:46] continue to contend for that don't let
[1:36:49] Satan steal it from you don't let one
[1:36:51] little lesbian talked about last week a
[1:36:53] little trial or something that that
[1:36:55] God's allowing to come our way to derail
[1:36:59] us or to get us so depressed down
[1:37:02] disappointed discouraged that we can't
[1:37:04] even wake up in the morning and I've
[1:37:06] been there it's not easy when those
[1:37:09] forces come so strong and and and would
[1:37:13] even use
[1:37:15] someone that's dear to you to do it
[1:37:17] that hurts
[1:37:19] it hurts deep Cuts deep
[1:37:22] but God always takes that sap
[1:37:25] and you stand up on your feet you say
[1:37:27] though the skin worms destroy my flesh
[1:37:30] and my body shall I see God amen amen
[1:37:34] gotta continue to contend friend the
[1:37:37] world's not going to do it for you
[1:37:39] this world's headed the opposite way
[1:37:42] amen amen
[1:37:44] what was considered wrong in my day is
[1:37:48] now there's nothing wrong with it
[1:37:50] can you imagine if it goes another 30 40
[1:37:53] years
[1:37:54] what is considered wrong today is there
[1:37:57] even anything considered wrong today
[1:37:59] I mean I don't know because you see
[1:38:02] these different District Attorneys out
[1:38:04] here and and and people murdering other
[1:38:08] people and they're set free
[1:38:11] people pushing other people on the train
[1:38:13] tracks to be ran over by trains and get
[1:38:16] busted in the head with a ball bat and
[1:38:18] they're let and they're just set free
[1:38:19] makes me wonder is there anything that
[1:38:22] isn't
[1:38:23] that is wrong anymore
[1:38:27] makes you wonder
[1:38:29] morals and where it's gotten but it
[1:38:31] helps you understand
[1:38:33] amen people have people have crawled
[1:38:36] into self-preservation mode
[1:38:39] and that's a sad place to be
[1:38:42] because when you're in self-preservation
[1:38:44] mode you're only thinking about yourself
[1:38:46] you're only doing things for yourself
[1:38:48] you're only going to do what helps you
[1:38:51] and yourself amen but that's not the
[1:38:55] life of a Christian
[1:38:57] amen
[1:38:58] brother Bram said when you live your
[1:39:00] life for others you're staring heaven in
[1:39:01] the face help us continue to contend
[1:39:03] Saints amen contend for that Faith don't
[1:39:07] let Satan defeat you that stand if we
[1:39:09] could
[1:39:20] amen

[1:44:54] praise the Lord I wanted to mention to
[1:44:57] you you know next week coming is Easter
[1:44:59] amen
[1:45:02] uh and brother Roger Collins is going to
[1:45:05] have some Easter services uh he's the
[1:45:08] only one I don't know if anybody else is
[1:45:09] or not I don't know uh I tell you what I
[1:45:13] know and this is what I know if any
[1:45:16] other church is having them they didn't
[1:45:17] send it to me so
[1:45:19] um but brother Rogers having service uh
[1:45:22] on Friday night at Seven uh Saturday
[1:45:25] night at six
[1:45:27] and Sunday morning he's at 10 30 of
[1:45:29] course we'll have our Sunday we'll have
[1:45:31] our Easter Sunday service here and he's
[1:45:33] also having a service Sunday afternoon
[1:45:35] at five o'clock
[1:45:37] amen so please remember that he also
[1:45:39] streams uh if you're unable to go or
[1:45:41] want to watch uh he also streams if you
[1:45:45] need the address to where their new
[1:45:47] church is just let me know I'll get you
[1:45:49] the address if you feel like you want to
[1:45:53] attend that so I talked to brother Dan
[1:45:57] uh Dan Evans
[1:45:59] the interim pastor the Tabernacle and he
[1:46:02] talks about wanting to try to do
[1:46:03] something but
[1:46:05] um
[1:46:06] I said well you know
[1:46:09] as far as those nights I know Fridays
[1:46:11] Friday night Saturday nights nights are
[1:46:13] kind of difficult sometimes for uh some
[1:46:16] of the older ones have a hard time
[1:46:17] seeing at night and that but uh but I I
[1:46:21] said if you do something just let me
[1:46:23] know or if y'all have
[1:46:25] something go on or meal or services and
[1:46:29] I haven't heard I have not heard back
[1:46:31] from him so uh as of right now I don't
[1:46:34] know that they're doing anything at the
[1:46:36] Tabernacle so all I know is that these
[1:46:39] services that brother Roger sent to me
[1:46:41] so that's all I have also
[1:46:45] I talked to Craig this week I asked him
[1:46:48] about the barber shop of course you know
[1:46:51] this place is leaving uh well by faith
[1:46:55] Hallelujah
[1:46:56] they haven't they haven't committed to
[1:46:59] that yet but they don't know they don't
[1:47:00] have a choice so they have to leave
[1:47:04] um but I asked him about the barbershop
[1:47:06] and he said well they got a couple years
[1:47:08] left on their lease and they're doing
[1:47:09] real well so I don't know about that I
[1:47:13] just tell the Lord I said Lord are there
[1:47:15] any of the hindrance and move them but I
[1:47:18] don't beverage a barber shop if they
[1:47:19] have
[1:47:21] you know to make money in that but I
[1:47:23] actually personally would like to get
[1:47:26] that place uh if we could and open the
[1:47:28] wall up right there and have our
[1:47:31] entrance come in that door and have that
[1:47:33] have that Estee fuel out there and have
[1:47:34] an office and a place for Sunday school
[1:47:37] and that over here and since that
[1:47:40] doesn't look like at least this moment
[1:47:42] is going to happen I was thinking about
[1:47:44] and I was talking to the Lord about it
[1:47:46] in prayer this morning about maybe
[1:47:48] asking him at least for now if we can
[1:47:50] get one of these places behind us
[1:47:52] as far as I know both of these places
[1:47:55] the Yokohama and the fiber care or
[1:47:57] whatever they're empty and seeing how
[1:48:00] much you would charge us to rent one of
[1:48:02] those two facilities out and that would
[1:48:04] move my office over there and have a
[1:48:06] Sunday school room over there we could
[1:48:08] try to open it up to have Fellowship
[1:48:10] luncheons things like that uh sort of a
[1:48:13] fellowship hall if you will so I plan on
[1:48:16] doing that and asking him so I just
[1:48:19] wanted to keep you abreast to let you
[1:48:21] know the things that I'm thinking what's
[1:48:23] going on in my mind and uh how I would
[1:48:26] kind of like unless the Lord opens some
[1:48:28] other place up
[1:48:30] um
[1:48:30] I've looked at a lot of places I've
[1:48:32] looked at other places maybe to go
[1:48:35] most of them are a lot more expensive
[1:48:38] but
[1:48:40] I always felt like if the Lord moved us
[1:48:42] from here it would be a more permanent
[1:48:43] place or
[1:48:45] place by itself that we're not in the
[1:48:48] storefront or something so but whatever
[1:48:50] the Lord wants that's what I want so but
[1:48:52] I I at this time I don't have any plans
[1:48:55] of leaving
[1:48:56] or else
[1:48:58] so if we're not going to I want to try
[1:49:01] to look at
[1:49:03] expanding this a little bit and making
[1:49:05] it the thing I dislike probably the most
[1:49:08] is the bathrooms we always bathrooms
[1:49:10] that were ours that were in our facility
[1:49:13] but whatever the Lord provides
[1:49:17] it should be going bathroom that much
[1:49:18] anyway except maybe the children or
[1:49:20] something
[1:49:21] but so but God bless you again I just
[1:49:24] wanted to keep you aware of that so that
[1:49:26] you know what my thoughts and all are
[1:49:29] and we'll go from there so we'll see
[1:49:32] what the Lord has to do with that and I
[1:49:34] give it to you as a point of Prayer
[1:49:39] can I ask the church to please pray this
[1:49:43] morning and his blast this young lady is
[1:49:46] sit on my
[1:49:48] she came in and she was so sick and
[1:49:52] she's just gotten sicker and sick and I

[1:50:16] first opportunity to really pray for her
[1:50:19] and pray her in to the Lord she's not

[1:50:25] responsive because she hasn't been
[1:50:26] drinking water it's she's a mess
[1:50:29] but so I'm asking you to please believe
[1:50:32] with me to just bomber with the holy
[1:50:36] spirit so that she is just you know she
[1:50:39] can make up she
[1:50:41] can recover herself from the spirit of
