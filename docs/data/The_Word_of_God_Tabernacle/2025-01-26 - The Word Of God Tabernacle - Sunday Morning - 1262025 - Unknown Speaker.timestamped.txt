[39:48] the Lord's willing I'll probably
[39:49] background a little bit where we left
[39:52] off from last week I just trust the Lord
[39:54] to uh speak today amen from this word as
[39:59] if any of us speak amen yes that
[40:02] includes me if any of us speak it's just
[40:05] us speaking it means nothing amen but
[40:08] when he speaks and yes through any of us
[40:10] when he speaks then it carries weight
[40:13] carry substance amen because it's his
[40:16] word not ours praise the Lord Jesus
[40:20] thank amen so we're going to go back to
[40:23] Psalms chapter 51 again Psalms chapter
[40:26] 51 vers 5 read that verse of scripture

[41:25] God what it means to be a child of God

[42:54] ourselves Lord in this service into your
[42:56] hands remain be part of it this
[42:58] beautiful communion service that we're
[43:00] about to partake of but Lord we just

[43:09] going to be done in according to your
[43:11] perfect will as we ask it in the
[43:13] precious and lovely name of our Lord and
[43:15] Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen
[43:19] Psalms chapter 51 verse5 Psalms 515
[43:23] behold I was shapen in iniquity and in
[43:26] sin did my mother conceive me you can be
[43:29] seated if you'd
[43:31] like
[43:36] amen I want to go back to other to uh
[43:39] one other scripture that we read in St
[43:41] John chapter 3 uh I'm I'm going to read
[43:45] a couple of scriptures here just right
[43:46] off to just kind of background where we
[43:48] left off from last week uh to get us
[43:51] caught up to this place uh I I know I
[43:54] went probably through more detail than
[43:57] you as a mature Born Again body of
[44:00] Believers needed but there was a a
[44:03] visitor in our midst and I kind of
[44:05] probably described things and went
[44:07] through some things a little more in
[44:08] detail uh hoping maybe that it it didn't
[44:11] confuse her uh so that maybe it would be
[44:15] something that she could grasp instead
[44:17] of uh just coming out and thinking that
[44:20] you know I don't know what he was
[44:22] talking about so uh we laid the
[44:25] scripture in there so to make sure that
[44:28] uh it it takes hold and of course uh I
[44:31] don't know who watches this uh after
[44:33] we're done so uh anyway uh so if it if
[44:37] it seemed a little repetitive to you
[44:39] please forgive me but uh it it is always
[44:42] of course to get us to a specific point
[44:45] that we're headed towards amen and that
[44:47] is our subject of adoption which is what
[44:50] we're going to talk on today so I want
[44:52] to go back to the second scripture we
[44:53] read again uh I'm not going to read the
[44:56] whole thing just just uh St John chapter
[44:58] 3 one verse verse 7 the most important
[45:01] verse St John 3 verse 7 Jesus told U uh
[45:08] Nicodemus at night Marvel not that I
[45:11] said unto thee ye must be born again
[45:15] amen amen you must be born again so
[45:18] before this walk again can ever take
[45:20] place before it can ever begin there has
[45:23] to be a new birth amen before you can
[45:26] ever take your first breath before you
[45:28] could ever take your first step before
[45:30] you could ever take B take your first
[45:32] bite of food you had to be born yes amen
[45:37] naturally to do the same thing
[45:39] spiritually you have to you must be born
[45:42] again that's the only way you can even
[45:44] begin on this journey and that as we
[45:47] said last week is just the beginning of
[45:49] our journey amen that is just the
[45:52] beginning of our journey uh I want to go
[45:54] back over to First John and and go back
[45:57] to there real quick
[46:00] because I want to go in a little more
[46:03] detail about this I didn't do last week
[46:06] uh purposefully uh just for the sake of
[46:10] time uh but uh this week I want to go in
[46:13] a little more in depth about the process
[46:17] that we talked about and look at it
[46:19] scripturally and were it types and
[46:22] shadows in the Old Testament we uh
[46:25] mentioned it just a little bit briefly
[46:27] uh but maybe a little more in detail
[46:29] today but first John chapter 5 I want to
[46:32] read the two verses of scripture I'm not
[46:34] going to read the whole thing again but
[46:35] just two
[46:38] verses first John chapter 5 uh two
[46:42] verses 7
[46:44] and8 and background this as
[46:47] well John said for there are three that
[46:50] bear record in heaven the Father the
[46:53] word and the Holy Ghost and these three
[46:55] are one amen now you can't dispute that
[46:58] you can't deny that unless you just
[47:00] decide to ignore the scripture but the
[47:03] scripture says they are one you can't
[47:05] have three and make them one and that's
[47:09] what trinitarians try to do they say
[47:11] there's three persons in but they're all
[47:14] one no if there's three persons they can
[47:17] agree in one but they're not one amen if
[47:21] there's three persons you got three
[47:23] personalities there's three people
[47:24] there's three entities there's three
[47:26] indiv idual that's three it's not one
[47:29] amen but the Bible says that the three
[47:32] are one amen they're one now uh as as we
[47:37] saw this and there are three that bear
[47:39] witness in Earth the spirit the water
[47:42] and the blood and these three agree in
[47:44] one they're not one but they work in
[47:46] continuity as one yes amen because they
[47:50] agree in one the the spirit the water
[47:53] the blood brings forth that three-step
[47:55] process we know of a new birth getting
[47:58] to a a a a new being and that three
[48:01] steps is what we talked about uh of
[48:04] course last week justification
[48:05] sanctification and the baptism of the
[48:07] Holy Ghost those three steps they agree
[48:10] in one which makes us uh as
[48:14] individuals uh that we claim to be born
[48:17] again uh one individual of these three
[48:20] that agree because the process of these
[48:23] three bring you to one place so they
[48:26] agree in one this these three bring you
[48:29] to a place of Salvation these three
[48:32] bring you to a place of New Birth amen
[48:35] that's what these that's how they agree
[48:37] in one that's how they bring to one but
[48:39] the father son the Holy Ghost the Father
[48:41] the word the Holy Ghost words logos
[48:43] Christ those three are one praise the
[48:47] Lord that we talked about last week I
[48:48] read this quote I'm going to read it
[48:50] again key to the door brother said see
[48:53] the holy uh the Holy Spirit stays right
[48:56] right straight with the scripture right
[48:59] straight with the scripture amen so when
[49:01] you come up with a Doctrine a belief a
[49:03] thought or as brother denst talked about
[49:05] in his prayer people that try to
[49:07] interpret the word it's got to be
[49:09] according to the scripture and it can't
[49:11] be according to one verse it can't be
[49:13] according to one chapter it's got to be
[49:16] continuity through it continually
[49:18] Genesis to Revelation it can't just be
[49:22] um a a a scripture here or there I've
[49:25] told U uh I believe I've mentioned this
[49:27] before a brother I knew in Florida he
[49:30] talked to so many different things
[49:32] doctrines and things and well brother
[49:34] bam said this and brother bam said that
[49:37] I said but yeah brother you have to run
[49:39] that quote with the rest of the quotes
[49:42] right you have to run that quote with uh
[49:45] uh with the rest of the message and you
[49:48] have to run that quote with the spirit
[49:51] in which it was spoken yeah and that's a
[49:53] lot of times what is missed even with
[49:55] the scripture
[49:57] it has to be believed uh preached in the
[50:00] in the way that it in the spirit that it
[50:03] was brought and a lot of times that's
[50:05] forgotten a lot of times people go off
[50:08] on tangents because they find one quote
[50:10] but now if you take that quote out of
[50:12] context out of the spirit of it if you
[50:15] take it out of the context the spirit of
[50:18] it then you can get your C the tree
[50:20] picking grass right if you put it in
[50:23] continuity with the rest of the
[50:25] scripture then it flows perfectly you
[50:27] can take that puzzle piece and put it
[50:29] exactly where it belongs because it's
[50:32] not misinterpreted it's not misplaced
[50:34] it's not misunderstood it's exactly what
[50:37] the word says well not what not what uh
[50:41] people would say they mean but what it
[50:43] says and they miss that the the
[50:45] interpretation of that because they
[50:47] don't follow it through right so it
[50:50] becomes garbled to them so when brother
[50:53] bam says see the Holy Spirit stays white
[50:56] right with the the scripture it's not
[50:58] just one quote here or there it's not
[51:00] just a verse here or there you could
[51:02] take a certain verse I think even
[51:04] brother green uh made this statement
[51:07] that you could take two scriptures and
[51:08] make a Doctrine out of it um and I
[51:11] believe it was uh uh Judas went and hung
[51:15] himself and you take another and says
[51:17] now you do the same thing and you can
[51:19] make a doctorine say well Judas is car
[51:21] went hung himself you go do the same
[51:23] thing and didn't he say that I think
[51:25] brother green used to say say that yes
[51:27] they say you can make a Doctrine you
[51:28] just take a couple of scriptures and you
[51:30] misplace them you take them out of the
[51:32] spirit of the of the uh and the
[51:34] continuity the the context and you can
[51:37] make it sound anything you want yeah and
[51:39] people go on limbs because of things
[51:41] like that and misinterpret or misplace
[51:44] the things that even the quotes are
[51:46] saying or that the scripture is saying
[51:48] so that's why you know brother BR said
[51:50] the Holy Spirit stays right with the
[51:53] scripture and it's got to go you can't
[51:55] you can't take one and not fit it into
[51:57] the old you can't take a New Testament
[52:00] scripture and not place it in the Old
[52:02] Testament the Old Testament was just the
[52:05] type and Shadow of the new right amen so
[52:08] that's what we're going to talk about in
[52:09] just a minute so it has to stay
[52:11] scripture Genesis the Revelation it's
[52:13] faith in that that unlocks every mystery
[52:18] amen amen the Bible said first John 5:7
[52:21] there are three that bear record in
[52:22] heaven we just read it father word which
[52:24] is Christ the Holy Ghost these three are
[52:26] are one there are three that bear record
[52:29] in heaven water blood spirit these three
[52:31] are not one but they agree in one amen
[52:36] now you can't have the father without
[52:39] having the son you can't have the son
[52:41] without having the Holy Ghost they are
[52:44] one but you can be justified without
[52:48] being Sanctified right you can be
[52:51] Sanctified without having the Holy Ghost
[52:54] sanctification is by the blood through
[52:56] the blood comes life and the Holy Ghost
[52:58] is the power of God see through the
[53:01] power that is given to the church the
[53:03] bride the people that power that is
[53:05] given see you can you can be anointed of
[53:09] the Holy Ghost on your flesh and not be
[53:11] born again right but you can't be born
[53:15] again and not having an anointing of the
[53:17] Holy Ghost right amen if he is in you he
[53:21] is with you praise the Lord but that
[53:24] that anointing can be with you you and
[53:27] you not be born again praise the Lord
[53:29] that's why they only agree in one see
[53:32] you can have one without the other the
[53:34] justification sanctification as brother
[53:36] B just said here you can have one
[53:38] without the other right but if you've
[53:39] got the father you've got the son you've
[53:42] got the Holy Ghost these three are one
[53:45] you can't have one without the other
[53:46] because they're one praise the Lord
[53:49] people say well
[53:50] I A lot of times they'll they'll they'll
[53:54] garble even Christians even pastor
[53:56] pastors I've heard
[53:58] ministers they'll say well you know uh
[54:01] this one is Allah and this one is uh
[54:05] whatever they call their different Gods
[54:08] uh and and well yeah but we all worship
[54:10] God no no no no no we
[54:13] don't well they worship all of that's
[54:16] their God they're they're worshiping
[54:18] God no you're not right if you worship
[54:22] the one true God then you if you have
[54:26] the true God you've got the son yes
[54:29] you've got the son you've got his Spirit
[54:32] good you can't take and say well you
[54:34] know we're worshiping God and they're
[54:36] worshiping God and they're worshiping
[54:37] God they're just we're just all
[54:39] worshiping God it's all okay cuz we're
[54:41] all worshiping God no we're
[54:42] not amen you can't have one without the
[54:45] other because they are one you can't
[54:47] split them up and say okay well you can
[54:49] have God we're going to take Jesus they
[54:52] don't believe in Jesus well then you
[54:54] can't have God right you you can't have
[54:56] God if you don't have him amen because
[54:59] they're one praise the Lord so it it it
[55:03] it GS me honestly when I hear Christians
[55:07] ministers even saying well they just we
[55:09] just we're all worshiping God political
[55:12] people sometimes say that you know they
[55:13] have to say that because they want to
[55:15] try to get in favor with everybody
[55:17] because they want their vote right they
[55:19] say well we're all worshiping God it's
[55:21] okay doesn't work that way Saints amen
[55:24] can't have one without the other praise
[55:26] the Lord amen when uh me and my wife
[55:30] become one many years ago but she can be
[55:32] at the supermarket and I can be at
[55:34] work amen praise the Lord Jesus said
[55:38] when you've seen me you've seen the
[55:39] father I can't say that I can't say when
[55:43] you've seen me you've seen Sonia that's
[55:45] not true amen there's a lot of people
[55:48] that's known me in my life they've never
[55:50] seen or known my wife at all never met
[55:52] her of any kind couldn't tell you what
[55:55] she looked like stand Al line they
[55:56] wouldn't have a clue who she was amen
[55:59] same as her she's met people probably
[56:01] never met me amen wouldn't pick me out
[56:04] of a lineup because we're not one amen
[56:08] we agree in one sometimes but we're not
[56:12] one God you understand see that God the
[56:16] Father the Son the Holy Ghost they are
[56:19] one am amen and you cannot have one
[56:21] without the other when Jesus said you've
[56:23] seen me you've seen the father he's just
[56:24] telling them we are one yes amen praise
[56:29] the Lord they are one the others they
[56:32] agree in one but they are one so we got
[56:34] this
[56:37] the the the new birth the the process of
[56:41] the new birth uh Peter gave it to us on
[56:44] the day of Pentecost I'll read it again
[56:47] acts 238 we know it Peter said unto them
[56:50] repent be baptized every one of you in
[56:53] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[56:54] remission of sin and you shall receive
[56:56] the gift of the Holy Ghost for the
[56:58] promise to you and your children uh and
[57:01] to all that are fall for as many as the
[57:02] Lord Our God shall call the repent be
[57:05] baptized filled with the Holy Ghost
[57:07] justification sanctification baptism of
[57:10] the Holy Ghost Born Again amen remember
[57:12] the baptism makes the way for the person
[57:14] of Christ himself amen the three-step
[57:18] process the three steps it come that
[57:21] leads to Calvary it's those three steps
[57:23] that brings us now brother Ram said and
[57:26] I've seen people try to use this to uh
[57:29] to in my opinion throw others off even
[57:33] ministers in the
[57:34] message that brother vam said that full
[57:38] obedience to the word entitles you to
[57:41] the
[57:42] token and people think that that means
[57:46] and I I've heard people say it that that
[57:48] means that you have to uh you have to
[57:51] come to every you have to go to you have
[57:54] to come to a place of of human
[57:56] Perfection then to get the Holy Ghost
[57:59] you can't do anything wrong you can't
[58:01] make any mistakes you can't fall in any
[58:04] way if you fall you're lost or backslid
[58:08] or whatever they want to call it I I I
[58:10] personally I'm I'm not a big fan of the
[58:13] word backslide uh but anyway we'll we'll
[58:16] leave that on the shelf for another time
[58:19] but but but when they get to that place
[58:21] and talk that like that it it it kind of
[58:26] uh
[58:27] uh it kind of makes
[58:30] me uh it makes people feel less than
[58:34] what they are it makes people feel like
[58:37] they have to have they have to have
[58:39] human Perfection before they can even
[58:42] receive the Holy Ghost and that is not
[58:44] true right Amen brother all brother B
[58:47] was talking about is full obedience to
[58:50] the word the word he's talking about for
[58:52] the new birth is acts 238 yes that
[58:56] that's the full obedience to the word
[58:58] repentance there must be full complete
[59:01] repentance baptism in the name of the
[59:04] Lord Jesus Christ not in the name of
[59:06] some titles but in the name of the Lord
[59:09] Jesus Christ entitles you to the Token
[59:13] yes that's full obedience to the word
[59:15] when you fully obey that word you are
[59:18] entitled to the Token are you going to
[59:21] make a mistake after you might make a
[59:23] mistake in the next 10 minutes after
[59:26] Haven got it that's not likely but you
[59:28] might or a bad thought the devil might
[59:31] drop some kind of thought in your mind
[59:33] 30 minutes after your after the birth
[59:37] yeah amen now it's not it's it's not
[59:40] your fault not your mistake you just
[59:43] throw that in the uh Delete category but
[59:47] we're still human we're still in this
[59:49] sticky flesh you're still going to we're
[59:51] still going to make mistakes we're still
[59:53] going to uh be human right
[59:57] amen but people would think that you've
[59:59] got to you've got to come to some human
[1:00:02] Perfection when Jesus said be ye
[1:00:04] therefore perfect as her father in
[1:00:07] Heaven is perfect he means it means full
[1:00:10] of full age of maturity amen of of a of
[1:00:15] a full age and how are you going to come
[1:00:18] even at that how are you going to come
[1:00:20] to the place of full
[1:00:22] maturity of a complete mature Christian
[1:00:26] until you first got the Holy Ghost right
[1:00:31] amen it it's it's sort of a it's sort of
[1:00:34] a subth thought of uh excuse me if I've
[1:00:38] got this wrong and if you watch this and
[1:00:40] it offends you I'm sorry but the Thunder
[1:00:42] Doctrine where thinks that you have to
[1:00:44] have every one of those completely
[1:00:46] perfected in your life before you can
[1:00:48] get the Holy
[1:00:50] Ghost we talked about that when we went
[1:00:52] through this their thought is each one
[1:00:55] of these steps if I if I if I recall
[1:00:58] this correctly if I'm wrong please
[1:00:59] forgive me uh as far as the people that
[1:01:03] believe that Doctrine but there are
[1:01:04] people I know that believe that you have
[1:01:06] to have that complete Perfection the
[1:01:08] statute of a perfect man completed in
[1:01:11] your flesh before you can even get the
[1:01:13] Holy Ghost my contention is how are you
[1:01:16] ever going to get to the completion of
[1:01:19] that in your life unless you've got the
[1:01:22] Holy Ghost amen I can't do it right none
[1:01:26] of I human I've tried to we probably all
[1:01:30] tried to but we can't do it without him
[1:01:33] amen how can I ever forgive or show
[1:01:36] godliness or brotherly kindness to
[1:01:39] someone that has treated me like trash
[1:01:42] yeah another believer if you will yeah
[1:01:46] amen how can I have that if I can't if I
[1:01:49] don't have the Holy Ghost how am I ever
[1:01:51] going to show brotherly kindness to the
[1:01:53] brother that's destroyed me and talk
[1:01:56] about me and put me down and ridiculed
[1:01:58] me and made fun of me or whatever amen
[1:02:01] how am I ever going to be able to do
[1:02:02] that I can't do that in myself right I
[1:02:06] can only do that because he lives in me
[1:02:10] that's the only when he takes now my
[1:02:12] flesh might rise up immediately because
[1:02:14] I get angry or upset but when you take
[1:02:17] time to settle down it's like that time
[1:02:20] I mentioned that brother green talked
[1:02:22] about when brother bam he wanted to talk
[1:02:24] to brother bam and he said okay we'll
[1:02:25] talk talk about that later and brother
[1:02:27] green walked through the room and
[1:02:28] brother Brown was sitting there on the
[1:02:29] couch with his feet across the couch he
[1:02:31] says now brother Perry about your
[1:02:33] problem he thought you know he's the one
[1:02:36] that brought it up and took him by
[1:02:38] surprise he said sit down here he said
[1:02:40] now you've got to do the same thing I
[1:02:43] do didn't even tell him what his problem
[1:02:45] was but you know he didn't have to
[1:02:48] yeah he knew what the problem was but he
[1:02:51] said you've got to do what I
[1:02:53] do now what a revelation
[1:02:56] yeah to know that brother brandham was
[1:02:58] what just a man and he's got to do it
[1:03:03] the same way amen live it the same way
[1:03:07] and that's the only way to bring this
[1:03:09] flesh under subjection he said now when
[1:03:11] you can come to
[1:03:13] yourself remember that's the most
[1:03:15] important part when you can get a hold
[1:03:18] of
[1:03:19] yourself you say Lord forgive me for
[1:03:22] thinking like that Lord forgive me for
[1:03:24] acting like that
[1:03:26] and make it right amen somebody might
[1:03:29] say something about you or put you down
[1:03:31] or whatever and you might rise up and
[1:03:34] you might be angry about it it might
[1:03:36] upset you you might even act in a way
[1:03:38] that you shouldn't have I've done that
[1:03:41] before but when you get to yourself and
[1:03:43] you get to the place it's just you and
[1:03:46] God you can come to yourself that was
[1:03:48] brother Ram's words brother great you
[1:03:50] can come to
[1:03:51] yourself then you can begin to expound
[1:03:55] these attributes in your
[1:03:57] life amen and it can only come from
[1:04:00] having a new birth can only come from
[1:04:03] being born again can only come from the
[1:04:05] life of God in you only way it can come
[1:04:10] now these three steps to justification
[1:04:12] sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost we
[1:04:14] talked about the most dangerous spot
[1:04:16] we're going to get to that here acts 238
[1:04:20] repent be baptized receive the Holy
[1:04:22] Ghost justification sanctification
[1:04:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost the same thing
[1:04:28] that happened the new birth with with
[1:04:31] God's original bride the children of
[1:04:34] Israel with God's original bride his
[1:04:37] children uh uh in the beginning when
[1:04:40] they came out of
[1:04:42] bondage which is what we all did amen we
[1:04:47] all come out of bondage yes when we came
[1:04:50] to the Lord cuz we were all we all
[1:04:52] thought we were free we all thought we
[1:04:55] were Liber we all thought well I can do
[1:04:57] whatever I want whenever I want however
[1:04:58] I want whatever I'm free I can drink I
[1:05:02] can cuss I can gamble I can live a
[1:05:04] righteous life doesn't matter I'm free I
[1:05:06] can do whatever I want amen I'm free to
[1:05:09] do we all thought we were free we were
[1:05:12] never more in bondage than we were at
[1:05:14] that moment right amen the only
[1:05:17] Liberation the only Freedom that comes
[1:05:20] is when you give your life to Christ yes
[1:05:22] amen and Christ frees you amen now you
[1:05:26] still you can still live however you
[1:05:28] want you can still do whatever you want
[1:05:32] you can still drink and cuss and Gamble
[1:05:34] and you can still do all those things
[1:05:36] you just don't want to
[1:05:38] anymore amen God takes the want to away
[1:05:42] amen praise the Lord amen when the wants
[1:05:45] to when the want to is gone it doesn't
[1:05:48] it's it doesn't mean anything you
[1:05:51] know can I say I'm going to be brutally
[1:05:54] honest
[1:05:56] about myself I was talking to uh I've
[1:06:00] mentioned the guy that lives here in
[1:06:01] town name's Doug's on our team uh kind
[1:06:05] of being a little self-destructive drink
[1:06:08] smokes and uh just does stuff that you
[1:06:12] know it just like it doesn't seem like
[1:06:15] he really cares if he lives or dies
[1:06:18] sometimes I told him I I said did not
[1:06:20] even care I mentioned I mentioned the
[1:06:22] other day about the thing he's talking
[1:06:23] about the liver and the money he cared
[1:06:25] more about the money that he did his
[1:06:26] liver that's the same guy and I was
[1:06:29] talking to him the other day and uh uh I
[1:06:33] I said you know I I
[1:06:35] remember
[1:06:36] um a time when I got drunk when I would
[1:06:41] drink I
[1:06:43] was way younger than the legal drinking
[1:06:46] age but I guess nobody cared I'd go in
[1:06:51] the bar with the guys I worked with and
[1:06:53] sit right there with the rest of them
[1:06:54] and you know know they didn't seem to
[1:06:56] care they' give you as much as you
[1:07:00] want uh get blind drunk I remember going
[1:07:03] home I remember driving myself home well
[1:07:06] I don't remember driving myself home
[1:07:08] that was the problem but I remember
[1:07:09] later that I was at one place at one
[1:07:12] time and the next time I'm
[1:07:14] home and I think how did that happen how
[1:07:18] did I even get
[1:07:20] home and I told him I
[1:07:24] said in that PL in that place at that
[1:07:27] point before me and Sonia got married uh
[1:07:31] the Lord started working with me amen
[1:07:34] cuz even at that time and and the one
[1:07:37] two hadn't gone yet but even at that
[1:07:40] time I started thinking this is just
[1:07:43] stupid why would anybody do
[1:07:47] this anything could have happened
[1:07:49] between to me between point a and point
[1:07:52] B why would anybody ever get themselves
[1:07:55] like that why would anybody ever do that
[1:07:57] I don't understand the stupid thing is I
[1:08:01] did it
[1:08:03] again and didn't
[1:08:06] remember
[1:08:08] and I
[1:08:11] um I remember falling down in the
[1:08:14] bathroom and hitting the little door
[1:08:16] stopper thing at the bottom of the door
[1:08:17] and it
[1:08:19] goes you know those I remember
[1:08:23] that uh why my par didn't come out of
[1:08:26] the room I don't know but I got myself
[1:08:28] got into the room went to bed and I
[1:08:31] thought I this is just stupid why do you
[1:08:34] do this first thing I never never like
[1:08:40] the taste of
[1:08:41] beer never in my life I drank it anyway
[1:08:45] but I never liked it never liked the
[1:08:47] taste of liquor hated it did never like
[1:08:50] the taste of it it's horrible but it did
[1:08:52] it anyway it was a thing to do it's kid
[1:08:55] you free drink do whatever you want it's
[1:08:58] right there you could be
[1:09:01] cool I never liked it to start with and
[1:09:04] the second time like this is this is
[1:09:06] just
[1:09:07] stupid and and this is common for people
[1:09:11] this becomes comedy for people to talk
[1:09:14] about in
[1:09:16] stories I I even even some of the guys
[1:09:19] on the team that talk about stories like
[1:09:20] that and I just sat there I've sat there
[1:09:23] before I've said
[1:09:27] why would you do
[1:09:28] that anything could have happened to you
[1:09:31] between here and
[1:09:33] there I know the Lord was watching over
[1:09:35] me but I didn't know that then but even
[1:09:39] then I thought why do you do that this
[1:09:40] is just stupid you don't even like it to
[1:09:43] start with why would you drink it well
[1:09:46] the others are drinking it this is what
[1:09:47] they're doing you know blah blah so and
[1:09:50] so and honestly I didn't quit but I
[1:09:53] basically quit
[1:09:56] I even I even got to the place to where
[1:10:00] the guys I worked with they were older a
[1:10:02] lot older than
[1:10:03] me they were like yeah we're taking on a
[1:10:05] bachelor party before I married Sonia
[1:10:08] said no no I'm not going yes we're going
[1:10:11] to take you no I'm not going to
[1:10:14] go and they said we're taking you
[1:10:16] whether you like it or not and I finally
[1:10:19] got to the place I was I was
[1:10:22] 19 I was a kid I was 19 19 years old and
[1:10:27] I thought no I'm not going to
[1:10:30] go and they said we're taking you
[1:10:32] whether you like it or not and I
[1:10:35] thought okay I said but I'm not going

[1:10:45] the night before the night before got to
[1:10:47] be two nights before I'm not doing it
[1:10:50] you can put me in shackles I'm not going
[1:10:51] the night before so we come to an
[1:10:53] agreement cuz I was just I was wasn't
[1:10:55] going to do that anymore Saints I just
[1:10:56] wasn't going to do it it just me as even
[1:10:59] as a kid I know I look at it now and I
[1:11:02] know God was dealing with me amen and I
[1:11:04] don't know why I'm saying all this maybe
[1:11:06] it's speaking to somebody but I I
[1:11:08] thought why I'm doing all this I was not
[1:11:10] going to do it again but they they
[1:11:13] persuaded me they pushed me they
[1:11:14] basically forced me I said okay just not
[1:11:16] going to be in the night before my
[1:11:17] wedding the night before the night
[1:11:19] before okay and uh did it again and that
[1:11:23] was it that I was drunk and that's the
[1:11:27] last time never did it again amen I I
[1:11:31] just quit it's like and I wasn't I
[1:11:33] didn't give my heart to the Lord I
[1:11:35] didn't I wasn't a Christian in in my
[1:11:39] opinion I didn't live for God I wasn't
[1:11:42] doing it because of that I wasn't doing
[1:11:44] it because he took the want away stuff's
[1:11:47] disgusting anyway I don't know why
[1:11:48] anybody would drink it but anyway it
[1:11:51] there was no taking the I just wasn't
[1:11:53] going to do it period I didn't care her
[1:11:55] with with I don't care what they said I

[1:11:59] about any of that so me and my wife got
[1:12:01] married I i' never do that again and I
[1:12:04] think why do people do that but I can
[1:12:07] look back and know Saints I know that
[1:12:11] it's just God in my life it's God
[1:12:14] watching over you God protecting you God
[1:12:17] being with you the whole way even to the
[1:12:20] point before you're born again and God
[1:12:23] you think God takes the want away I I
[1:12:25] didn't even want it even before I gave
[1:12:27] my heart to him amen I didn't I didn't
[1:12:30] care to do it me and Sonia would go to a
[1:12:33] Mexican restaurant and have a margarita
[1:12:35] or something like that it wasn't like
[1:12:37] that cuz we weren't Christians we
[1:12:40] weren't living for God we were just
[1:12:41] worldly people went with my brothers and
[1:12:44] all that and I was not I was but by the
[1:12:47] time I got 21 where I could legally
[1:12:50] drink I quit
[1:12:53] drinking but it it was just the point
[1:12:56] that God take God that watches over you
[1:13:00] and takes care of you and protects you
[1:13:02] and helps you and and watches over you
[1:13:05] and to the point that when when you get
[1:13:07] to that place even of a new birth it
[1:13:10] just seems so simple it seems like I
[1:13:13] I've had people that come up and say
[1:13:15] well you know they think if they if they
[1:13:17] become Christians or they commit to the
[1:13:19] Lord or they give their heart to God or
[1:13:21] they repent they got to give everything
[1:13:23] up
[1:13:25] well I I can't smoke anymore then I
[1:13:28] can't drink anymore I said I didn't tell
[1:13:31] you to quit smoking or drinking I said I
[1:13:34] I just said give your heart to the Lord
[1:13:36] just repent and give your heart to the
[1:13:38] Lord I didn't tell you to quit doing
[1:13:39] this stuff just give your heart to God
[1:13:42] Amen that's all you got to do if you
[1:13:45] give if you truly give your heart to God
[1:13:47] and you truly repent God will take it
[1:13:50] away God will help you it may not be
[1:13:52] immediately I got criticized I think
[1:13:55] I've told you before a brother that had
[1:13:57] a good heart he loved the Lord he came
[1:13:59] to church he was faithful he brought his
[1:14:00] family but he still
[1:14:03] smoked but he came up to me one day and
[1:14:06] he wanted to get baptized I said okay I
[1:14:09] said it's just like this sister that was
[1:14:11] here the other day she said well what do
[1:14:13] I need to do first I said exactly what
[1:14:15] the scripture says repent amen you fully
[1:14:18] repent to the Lord You're you are truly
[1:14:21] sorrowful for your past life and your
[1:14:24] past in your Disobedience and you repent
[1:14:27] from that and get baptized he's
[1:14:30] obligated to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:14:32] amen the new birth amen if you do that
[1:14:36] did she ask me that and and and that's
[1:14:40] what brings Christ into your life yes
[1:14:43] amen that's what makes the difference so
[1:14:47] it's it's like when she asked me when I
[1:14:48] tell people so well I I got to quit so
[1:14:51] he wanted to get baptized and uh uh I
[1:14:55] said okay and he said well you know and
[1:14:57] I went through the same thing we
[1:14:59] discussed it talked to him about it he
[1:15:01] had a sincere heart he loved the Lord
[1:15:03] and so he came forth and we took him and
[1:15:05] baptized him in a retention pond in
[1:15:06] Florida St Augustine Florida to baptized
[1:15:10] him in a retention p and I got
[1:15:12] criticized by people in the church right
[1:15:15] well one specific person because I
[1:15:18] baptized a man that was still
[1:15:21] smoking and I think what better way to
[1:15:23] clean the man up than to put him under
[1:15:25] the faucet
[1:15:27] amen amen how do you get mud off of you
[1:15:31] go in the shower and you wash off what
[1:15:33] better way to help wash them clean than
[1:15:35] under the SP it amen amen let him set
[1:15:39] under the word let him set under the
[1:15:41] spirit let him sit under Christ let him
[1:15:43] sit under the water and let God wash it
[1:15:45] all the way amen amen I said
[1:15:49] plus I believe I can't remember if it's
[1:15:52] Billy Paul but uh I I remember the story
[1:15:55] where uh this guy did the same thing
[1:15:58] brother Brandon baptized him he still
[1:16:00] smoked and people people criticized
[1:16:02] brother Bram for baptizing a man that
[1:16:04] smoked he said well you're not brother
[1:16:06] brandom I said well neither are
[1:16:08] you but I said one time uh the guy
[1:16:13] wanted uh
[1:16:15] cigarettes and he wanted to buy
[1:16:17] cigarettes and brother Brandon went down
[1:16:19] and saw some brother and he said now
[1:16:20] here's some money he said I can't I
[1:16:22] can't take God's money uh to buy this
[1:16:25] man cigarettes amen but if you would go
[1:16:28] take a carton of cigarettes buy a carton
[1:16:30] of cigarettes take him up to the man
[1:16:33] hand them to him and say these are for
[1:16:35] brother
[1:16:36] brandham he said we do that he said yeah
[1:16:40] brother BR I'll do that he went and
[1:16:42] bought the carton cigarettes took his
[1:16:43] money not brother R's money took his
[1:16:45] money went and bought the carton
[1:16:46] cigarettes he hand them to the man in
[1:16:48] the hospital bed and said here now these
[1:16:49] are from Brother brand he said the man
[1:16:52] never smoked another cigarette in his
[1:16:53] life am
[1:16:55] never even touched the carton that he
[1:16:57] just bought for him never smoked another
[1:16:59] one amen you don't know what it does
[1:17:02] what it takes it's God but you just give
[1:17:05] your heart to the Lord don't worry about
[1:17:06] the rest right God will take care of it
[1:17:09] amen just get them out the SP it let God
[1:17:11] was them clean yes that's what God
[1:17:13] that's his specialty is cleaning them up
[1:17:16] but the worst place a person can be is
[1:17:18] is in a place where they've been
[1:17:20] Justified and Sanctified they feel like
[1:17:22] they're okay but they haven't gone and
[1:17:24] got received the Holy the Holy Ghost
[1:17:27] they haven't been born again so we got
[1:17:31] in the in Israel as we talked about the
[1:17:35] same type as we have the scripture let's
[1:17:37] go through this if we can real quick in
[1:17:40] the scripture to the New Birth that they
[1:17:43] had remember we talked about God gave
[1:17:45] them a Promised Land a physical land
[1:17:49] that they were to go to and inhabit and
[1:17:51] take over right amen we talked about
[1:17:54] that last week
[1:17:55] that was their placement that was their
[1:17:57] inheritance that was their adoption a
[1:18:00] place that they were to go to it was
[1:18:02] their Promised Land remember what our
[1:18:04] Promised Land is Our promised land is
[1:18:07] the Holy Ghost amen God promised us the
[1:18:11] Holy Spirit repent be baptized and you
[1:18:14] shall rece be baptized in the name of
[1:18:16] Jesus Christ and you shall receive the
[1:18:19] Holy Ghost amen that's our promis L
[1:18:22] that's the promise God gave to us but
[1:18:25] for the three-step process that we go
[1:18:27] through in Repentance and baptism the
[1:18:31] the the children of Israel did the same
[1:18:33] thing in their
[1:18:34] justification they went that they came
[1:18:37] out of Egypt with Moses that was their
[1:18:41] justification they came out of the World
[1:18:44] when they came out of the world through
[1:18:47] Moses they became justified in their own
[1:18:50] place now they weren't subject to the
[1:18:52] Egyptians they weren't slaves to the
[1:18:54] Egyptians or any of that they came out
[1:18:57] of sin they came out of the world it's
[1:18:59] just like uh the glass in the chicken
[1:19:02] yard remember the glass in the chicken
[1:19:04] yard you can take the glass out of the
[1:19:07] chicken yard and it's Justified it's no
[1:19:10] longer in the chicken yard amen it's
[1:19:12] just set here it's just a glass setting
[1:19:14] here amen it's still full of whatever
[1:19:17] substance was in the chicken yard which
[1:19:20] you can imagine but it was but it's
[1:19:23] Justified it's no longer in the chicken
[1:19:24] yard yarden it's not clean yet it's
[1:19:28] filthy and not fit to use but it's not
[1:19:30] in the world anymore right that's
[1:19:34] Justified amen when you come out you uh
[1:19:38] and no longer part of it is
[1:19:40] justification when they came out of
[1:19:42] Egypt they were Justified they did that
[1:19:44] under Moses when they came across the
[1:19:47] Red Sea Into the Wilderness through
[1:19:49] Moses again amen
[1:19:52] sanctification uh in
[1:19:55] uh coming across even a representation
[1:19:58] of water if you will they didn't they
[1:20:00] didn't get wet because the Lord parted
[1:20:02] the Red Sea but as they came across the
[1:20:04] Red
[1:20:05] Sea Into the Wilderness into the place
[1:20:09] that they were supposed to be going they
[1:20:12] uh that was a sanctification that was a
[1:20:14] place of of a cleaning up amen of
[1:20:17] getting themselves ready you take the
[1:20:19] glass and you clean it up amen that
[1:20:23] that's sanctification
[1:20:25] amen you Justified it by taking it out
[1:20:27] of the chicken yard you sanctify by
[1:20:29] cleaning it all up and getting every all
[1:20:31] the uh chip chicken droppings off of it
[1:20:33] you clean it make it all nice and
[1:20:35] beautiful uh pristine condition that's
[1:20:39] sanctification amen they came through
[1:20:42] when they came through the Red Sea and
[1:20:44] now when they come through the Red Sea
[1:20:46] Into the Wilderness they got into a very
[1:20:48] dangerous position because God sent some
[1:20:52] witnesses over for them to go over in
[1:20:54] into their Promised Land but there were
[1:20:57] ones that come back with bad reports
[1:20:59] with evil reports they said there's no
[1:21:02] way we can take that because there's
[1:21:05] Giants over there that make us look like
[1:21:08] grasshoppers they even brought back on
[1:21:11] these uh I forgot what they call them
[1:21:13] but the the sticks that They carried on
[1:21:15] their shoulders from person to person 68
[1:21:17] feet apart amen they had fruit fruit as
[1:21:21] evidence from the land big grapes and
[1:21:24] all that They carried on these stage on
[1:21:26] these on these poles they had evidence
[1:21:29] look Saints they had evidence that the
[1:21:32] promis land was exactly what God said it
[1:21:35] was and told them it was theirs go get
[1:21:39] it I'll be with you praise the Lord but
[1:21:43] they got into the most dangerous
[1:21:47] comfortable position they had the
[1:21:49] Egyptians were behind the Egyptians were
[1:21:52] destroyed in the Red Sea they come out
[1:21:55] Sanctified feeling good worshiping God
[1:21:58] and thought everything was great they
[1:22:00] got so comfortable they got so eased and
[1:22:02] Zion they got so it become natural to
[1:22:05] them that they that they become it seems
[1:22:08] like they become
[1:22:10] disinterested and going ahead into the
[1:22:12] promised land that God had promised them
[1:22:15] they were happy they were content they
[1:22:17] were at a place that they
[1:22:20] thought this is a good place we're happy
[1:22:24] here everything's good God blesses us
[1:22:26] and all this is this is great I go to
[1:22:29] church and I pay my TI and I live the
[1:22:31] way you know and and and and everything
[1:22:33] is good and sat there in the most
[1:22:36] dangerous spot I imagine Judas thought
[1:22:39] the exact same thing judas's carrot s
[1:22:42] the great same thing God sent him out
[1:22:45] and he went out and saw demons cast out
[1:22:48] and miracles take place when they came
[1:22:50] back rejoicing I guarantee you judas's
[1:22:52] carrot was just yelling and scream and
[1:22:54] worshiping as loud as any of the others
[1:22:57] amen he was happy about that he was he
[1:23:01] was a part of them he was one of them
[1:23:04] amen but there was there was something
[1:23:06] in Judas that was missing that was the
[1:23:09] desire to go into that land to go into
[1:23:12] that promised land to go into the depths
[1:23:15] of the word to go into the depths of the
[1:23:17] Holy Ghost to receive the Holy Spirit he
[1:23:20] could not do it so when he got Justified
[1:23:23] like I said St John 17 17 Jesus says
[1:23:26] sanctify them Lord by your word amen and
[1:23:29] so at that point sanctification came and
[1:23:32] they became eased and comfortable they
[1:23:35] became so comfortable that even Peter
[1:23:39] the most staunchest speaker of the group
[1:23:42] lied cussed and denied Jesus Christ
[1:23:45] three times denied even knowing him
[1:23:50] three times they got that they had
[1:23:52] gotten that so far out but there was
[1:23:55] still something in Peter that stood
[1:23:57] there with him and watched him and saw
[1:23:58] what was going on Amen Judas went and
[1:24:01] sold Jesus out for 30 pieces of silver
[1:24:04] and went and killed himself amen because
[1:24:07] he couldn't go on into the furtherance
[1:24:09] of of of of the birth being born again
[1:24:13] the Holy Ghost he could not go into the
[1:24:15] upper room children of Israel they got
[1:24:18] EAS in Zion they became comfortable in
[1:24:20] the wilderness the glass is clean yeah
[1:24:23] it's beautiful but what good is a clean
[1:24:25] glass do if you don't use
[1:24:28] it it's just an ornament it's just a
[1:24:30] decoration I know my wife gets a lot of
[1:24:33] coffee cups with the scriptural sayings
[1:24:35] on them and stuff and she loves them and
[1:24:37] she puts them up on the shelf for
[1:24:39] display and stuff we never use them she
[1:24:41] never uses them amen but when you come
[1:24:43] in there and you look and you see the
[1:24:44] sayings it's
[1:24:46] encouraging amen the the the sayings on
[1:24:49] the cups sometimes I look at them
[1:24:50] sometimes I read them sometimes I don't
[1:24:52] but sometimes I read them and they're
[1:24:53] encouraging
[1:24:55] amen when you can you sit there and the
[1:24:56] word is sitting right in front of you
[1:24:58] amen so those are nice when she gets
[1:25:00] those gifts but there's still uh the the
[1:25:04] the the writing is good but what good if
[1:25:06] is a glass again we probably got glasses
[1:25:09] in our cabinet we hadn't used in years I
[1:25:12] what's the point in taking and
[1:25:13] cluttering up a cabinet if you don't
[1:25:14] even use it what good is a clean glass
[1:25:17] if you don't use it amen there's got to
[1:25:20] be a usage to the glass
[1:25:24] hence comes the Holy Ghost amen amen
[1:25:28] what's the what the Holy Ghost fills up
[1:25:31] the glass amen it puts it into
[1:25:35] use not just a beautiful glass setting
[1:25:37] there all clean yeah it was in the
[1:25:39] chicken yard yes it's nice and clean and
[1:25:41] that is a great thing that is wonderful
[1:25:43] God is a miracle working God but what
[1:25:45] good does it do if it's not full of the
[1:25:47] Holy Ghost that God can use it God
[1:25:50] didn't clean God didn't justify you out
[1:25:52] of the world and sanctify and clean your
[1:25:54] life up just for you to sit on a Pew and
[1:25:56] do nothing just for us to sit at home
[1:25:59] and do nothing just for us to not
[1:26:01] witness or talk to anybody or be a use
[1:26:03] of God in any way amen God didn't clean
[1:26:07] you up just to be a non onal log he
[1:26:09] cleaned you up to be put into use that's
[1:26:12] what the Holy Ghost is for yes the Holy
[1:26:15] Ghost puts movement in your feet it puts
[1:26:18] a a a purpose in your heart that you can
[1:26:21] walk with that you can talk with that
[1:26:23] you can live with with that you can be
[1:26:25] the person that God wants you to be
[1:26:28] because you're not just Justified and
[1:26:29] Sanctified you're filled with the Holy
[1:26:31] Ghost now it's God leading your life not
[1:26:34] you the footsteps of a righteous man are
[1:26:38] ordered of God Amen God directs your
[1:26:41] steps God directs your path God shows
[1:26:43] you tells you leads you it's God that
[1:26:45] does it now I that's being born again
[1:26:48] led by the spirit of God I've had people
[1:26:50] say well should should we go down here
[1:26:52] on the corner and preach I said said if
[1:26:54] God tells you to do it you better do it
[1:26:56] amen right if God doesn't tell you to do
[1:26:59] it you might get arrested I don't know
[1:27:01] right
[1:27:02] that's assumption brother R talk about
[1:27:06] uh venturing forth without Authority
[1:27:09] sometimes he would say that people say
[1:27:11] well come here brother brandom or come
[1:27:12] here or do this or go to this place
[1:27:15] these people really need you these
[1:27:17] people are crying out for you well
[1:27:18] that's all fine and good but I don't go
[1:27:20] anywhere unless God tells me to and when
[1:27:23] God tells me to go there I go post haste
[1:27:26] because I know he's going to be with me
[1:27:29] right I don't care what demons are over
[1:27:31] there I don't care what witches warlocks
[1:27:33] I don't care what spirits that are B to
[1:27:35] battle I don't care what's going on with
[1:27:36] their government I don't care if God
[1:27:38] sends me he will take care of me yes he
[1:27:41] that's a full glass that's someone that
[1:27:44] has the Holy Ghost and when the children
[1:27:45] of Israel cross over Jordan into the
[1:27:49] Promised Land by Joshua this time not
[1:27:53] Moses amen cuz Moses was disobedient to
[1:27:56] God he smoked the rock instead of
[1:27:57] speaking to it God said you will not be
[1:28:00] the one to lead them Joshua steep
[1:28:02] forward LED them across Jordan which was
[1:28:06] their baptism which was their the the
[1:28:09] the Holy Ghost which is also you also
[1:28:12] know Jordan represents death Jordan
[1:28:15] means death death to what death to me
[1:28:18] death to you amen death to ourselves so
[1:28:21] that Christ can live in us so Christ can
[1:28:23] take over over our lives it's no more us
[1:28:26] but it's him that's death going across
[1:28:28] Jordan they went across Jordan and a lot
[1:28:31] of times we don't we talk about the Red
[1:28:33] Sea but God did the exact same thing to
[1:28:34] Jordan for
[1:28:36] them
[1:28:38] amen God can do it no matter what
[1:28:41] anybody says amen it's our own thinking
[1:28:44] it's our own reasoning it's our own
[1:28:46] Humanity that gets in the way so many
[1:28:48] times but they walked over into the
[1:28:51] promised land and what did they face
[1:28:53] they faced the the thing that God told
[1:28:55] him this big humongous City with all
[1:28:57] this this this wall that was so thick
[1:29:00] you could run three chots a breast
[1:29:01] across Race Across the top of the wall
[1:29:04] it was so
[1:29:05] big amen friends have you ever woke up
[1:29:09] have you ever got to a place in your
[1:29:10] life where you've come up to an obstacle
[1:29:13] that had so that was so insurmountable
[1:29:15] that three chariots could run across a
[1:29:17] breast and a Race Across have you ever
[1:29:20] come across a wall like that in your
[1:29:22] life not physically I'm not talking
[1:29:24] about an actual city with a wall I'm
[1:29:27] talking about in your life yes amen I
[1:29:32] think we probably all have would you
[1:29:35] come to that wall do we give
[1:29:38] up do we
[1:29:41] quit do we not take the city
[1:29:44] anyway because on the other side of that
[1:29:47] wall we'll just say this because it it's
[1:29:51] what we talk about the most physical
[1:29:53] healing because on the other side of
[1:29:55] that wall is your healing yes amen the
[1:29:59] only way to get on the other side is for
[1:30:01] the wall to be tore down amen they come
[1:30:05] up to
[1:30:07] Jericho and they got to the place that
[1:30:09] the wall where they were murmuring and
[1:30:11] complaining just like they did the Red
[1:30:12] Sea just like they did oh how many times
[1:30:15] the children of Israel just murmured and
[1:30:17] complain but now we got a new generation
[1:30:18] coming up we got a new leader and Joshua
[1:30:21] hears from God and God tells him exactly
[1:30:25] what to do around the city and go around
[1:30:27] blow the trumpet he then go around he
[1:30:29] comes up this day and he says oh I I
[1:30:31] don't think we're going to be able to
[1:30:32] get this done and God says talk to that

[1:34:07] generations of people that's got to live
[1:34:08] here now amen so God told Joshua and
[1:34:12] Joshua started doing what he started
[1:34:15] placing every one of them in their place
[1:34:18] from this place to this place it becomes
[1:34:21] kind of starchy and boring maybe if you
[1:34:24] will to read or to listen to but the
[1:34:27] bottom line is God had every one of them
[1:34:29] in their position in their place even to
[1:34:32] the Levites even to the the the
[1:34:34] priesthood levitical priesthood he had
[1:34:37] their position set up for them to
[1:34:39] minister to all those people all the
[1:34:42] tribes all in in uh and all perfectly
[1:34:45] placed he put them in their position
[1:34:48] amen and that's exactly what God does
[1:34:50] for us amen yeah I've been born again at
[1:34:54] the Holy Ghost I I I've reached my
[1:34:56] Promised Land but now you've got a a
[1:34:59] placing of suns to take place a a a
[1:35:03] fullness of a
[1:35:05] word when when brother Brandon brought
[1:35:07] forth the
[1:35:09] seals it opened up and exposed
[1:35:12] everything that had been hid from ages
[1:35:14] and
[1:35:15] generations that people had probed that
[1:35:17] and tried to get to and and and try to
[1:35:19] think but that fullness of that word
[1:35:21] came and the whole the entire scripture
[1:35:24] became open it it was it was there for a
[1:35:28] fullness for for the
[1:35:31] placing of of the body of Christ now
[1:35:35] it's time for you to take your place

[1:35:41] my place whatever it is that God has for
[1:35:44] you in your life walk in it yes amen
[1:35:49] that's the placement of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:50] that puts you in that place in that land
[1:35:53] where where you're supposed to be
[1:35:56] amen praise the Lord when God places us
[1:35:59] there then it's it's up to him to lead
[1:36:02] us and guide us in that in that way amen

[1:37:22] 8:22 for we we
[1:37:24] know we know that the whole creation
[1:37:28] granth and travaileth in pain together
[1:37:32] until now amen and I will say even until
[1:37:37] now and not only they but ourselves also
[1:37:41] which have the first fruits of the
[1:37:43] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[1:37:48] ourselves waiting for the adoption
[1:37:53] to it or that is to say the Redemption
[1:37:58] of our
[1:38:00] bodies the Redemption what is the
[1:38:02] Redemption of our bodies these things
[1:38:05] that the Holy Ghost is working out to
[1:38:09] amen the Redemption of these bodies is
[1:38:12] when it culminates in a body change amen
[1:38:16] all of creation is waiting for that
[1:38:18] manifestation of the sons of God to the
[1:38:22] place of fullest adoption to the place
[1:38:25] where that adoption is
[1:38:27] complete amen and God takes us home amen
[1:38:31] everybody's in their place everybody's
[1:38:33] in their position everything is made
[1:38:37] right everything's where it's supposed
[1:38:39] to be it's in the body of Christ how
[1:38:41] it's supposed to
[1:38:43] be that's when God takes us home that is
[1:38:47] to say the Redemption of our bodies our
[1:38:50] bodies then
[1:38:53] we say are redeemed they come to the
[1:38:56] place of redemption we're already
[1:38:59] redeemed amen but we actually have a
[1:39:01] body change yes and we go on a Rapture
[1:39:05] yes and God takes us home that's the
[1:39:07] Fulfillment that's the Pinnacle of that
[1:39:10] adoption we've reached the place in
[1:39:12] Christ where Christ desired for us and
[1:39:15] God saw in his mind before the
[1:39:18] foundation of the world it reaches and
[1:39:20] then all the creation why is all
[1:39:22] creation groing because when that
[1:39:26] happens amen that is the beginning
[1:39:30] because it won't happen immediately
[1:39:32] because then tribulation sets in and all
[1:39:34] but that's the beginning to getting back
[1:39:37] to the place where all of creation was
[1:39:40] in the harmony that it was in in the
[1:39:42] Garden of
[1:39:43] Eden amen rose bushes will have no more
[1:39:47] Thorns those of you that are desert
[1:39:50] lovers and love all these stickers and
[1:39:53] thorns and all out here I'm not a fan
[1:39:55] myself but if I'm sorry but they're all
[1:39:59] going to be gone
[1:40:01] amen it's not supposed to be that way
[1:40:04] amen the the there's not going to ever
[1:40:07] be a dog chase down a cat again there's
[1:40:11] not ever going to be a cat chase down a
[1:40:13] mouse again amen there's there's there's
[1:40:16] not ever going to be a lion hunt down a
[1:40:19] gazelle
[1:40:20] anymore that that's all gone that was
[1:40:23] never in the beginning it was never in
[1:40:25] the original creation but when sin came
[1:40:27] in all of creation fell but the
[1:40:31] manifestation of the sons of God in this
[1:40:33] full Redemptive place where our bodies
[1:40:35] go into Rapture when and after the
[1:40:37] tribulation when God Burns it all off it
[1:40:39] brings nature back to the place it was
[1:40:41] supposed to be so when we come back to
[1:40:44] live
[1:40:45] here when we live here all of nature
[1:40:48] will be the way it was supposed to be
[1:40:50] Amen in Perfect Harmony perfect
[1:40:54] continuity everything perfect amen
[1:40:57] Perfection no
[1:40:59] sin thank you Lord no unbelief amen
[1:41:02] because everything will be the way it's
[1:41:04] supposed to be that's why all of
[1:41:05] creation is groaning and waiting as we
[1:41:09] are groaning and waiting for that
[1:41:12] Redemption of our bodies amen praise the
[1:41:16] Lord let's stand if we could
[1:41:28] amen Lord willing next week we'll get
[1:41:31] back
[1:41:32] to to this and pick up here where we
[1:41:36] left off yes and get back to that
[1:41:39] place uh to finish that thought I wanted
[1:41:42] to get to but we will so amen so pray
[1:41:46] the Lord bless you amen I'm thankful to
[1:41:49] God's mercy amen he loves us yes he does
[1:41:54] we just want to make sure Saints we
[1:41:56] don't fall short of who we
[1:41:59] are we don't fall short of the position
[1:42:02] that God gave us amen the the the
[1:42:05] placement that God I've had so many
[1:42:07] people say but but brother than you I
[1:42:09] don't know what I'm supposed to do I
[1:42:11] don't know what my position is I don't
[1:42:13] know what my placement is the only thing
[1:42:16] I can tell you I mean others can see
[1:42:18] gifts in your life or things like that
[1:42:21] and may have an idea just based on your
[1:42:23] character based on your actions based on
[1:42:26] your talents and things maybe uh what
[1:42:30] your placement might be what what God
[1:42:33] has for your life uh nobody can tell you
[1:42:37] that best thing I can tell you is find a
[1:42:40] closet
[1:42:42] somewhere amen find a closet find a
[1:42:45] quiet place find but go to your prayer
[1:42:47] spot go and talk to God about ask him
[1:42:51] say Lord I
[1:42:54] just I I want to
[1:42:56] know sometimes I've had people tell me
[1:42:59] that and I know who that person is and
[1:43:01] what their life is and I said and I'm
[1:43:04] like well brother can't you see
[1:43:07] this can't you see that and like I just
[1:43:11] thought that was just a a normal thing
[1:43:14] that people do I said no people don't do
[1:43:16] that but you do it why do you do it
[1:43:20] because God's called you to that
[1:43:23] I didn't realize that I just did it
[1:43:25] because I thought it was a good thing to
[1:43:26] do or the right thing to do or whatever
[1:43:29] why do you think
[1:43:30] that because God put it in your heart
[1:43:34] God's leading you God's showing you and
[1:43:37] people take their place and sometimes
[1:43:39] don't even realize they're actually
[1:43:42] living in their adoption and don't even
[1:43:44] know it they're living in the position
[1:43:46] God put them in the good part about that
[1:43:49] is that if they are that means that they
[1:43:51] just they've been they're being led of
[1:43:53] God they've let the Holy Spirit lead
[1:43:56] their lives and they and he's LED their
[1:43:58] lives into the place that they're
[1:44:00] actually living their adoption and even
[1:44:02] might not realize it yes amen I've I've
[1:44:05] had people like that too but God knows
[1:44:10] and if there that question Amen Let God
[1:44:15] answer it amen the best thing I can tell
[1:44:17] you is just it's the advice I would give
[1:44:19] people when they ask me about a spouse
[1:44:22] do I look look for a wife do I look for
[1:44:24] a husband I said if you go diligently
[1:44:27] looking you'll find
[1:44:29] one but it's not likely going to be the
[1:44:31] one God has for you yes just live your
[1:44:34] life yes that's all you can do live your
[1:44:38] life live your life as a Christian
[1:44:41] obedience to God and his word and let
[1:44:43] your footsteps be ordered of God and God
[1:44:46] will put you in the right place at the
[1:44:48] right time with the right person yes if
[1:44:51] that is his will yes amen amen at the
[1:44:54] right place the right time it's the same
[1:44:56] thing if you don't know you just walk
[1:45:00] just obey God just live your life for
[1:45:04] God and walk your footsteps order of God
[1:45:08] and God will put you in the place and
[1:45:09] the position what you're supposed to be
[1:45:11] what you're supposed to do amen when I
[1:45:14] first became a minister I didn't think
[1:45:17] it was the a bazillion miles from my
[1:45:21] mind that I would ever end up back in
[1:45:23] Tucson and it was a gazillion miles away
[1:45:28] that I would ever live in Florida or
[1:45:30] move to
[1:45:32] Florida I didn't want to move to Florida
[1:45:35] honestly I didn't want to move to
[1:45:39] Tucson but when God but when God
[1:45:42] says go do you go and do but you want to
[1:45:46] or not whether you like it or not um but
[1:45:50] when you know it's God I will say I have
[1:45:52] argued with God plenty of times in my
[1:45:54] life but when I know it's something that
[1:45:56] serious and I know it's him I've never
[1:45:59] argued yes amen and and truth be told my
[1:46:03] wife has never argued with me amen as
[1:46:06] much as she might not have wanted to she
[1:46:09] never argued amen that's the will of the
[1:46:12] Lord of course she would definitely not
[1:46:14] argue with coming back to Tucson that
[1:46:16] would she would have never argued about
[1:46:18] that but she's never because we are if
[1:46:22] we say we are one in this yes
[1:46:27] amen that's the best advice I can give
[1:46:30] people and tell them amen be a Christian
[1:46:33] live your life live a good humble simple
[1:46:37] Christian Life that's it it all goes
[1:46:40] back doesn't it amen praise the Lord
[1:46:42] let's get into the communion service
[1:46:44] Psalm number 16 I like to sing this just
[1:46:46] the first verse as we do amen did you
[1:46:50] turn the streaming off not yet
[1:46:54] I don't necessarily like or need the
[1:46:56] stram
