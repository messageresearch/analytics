to be in the house of the Lord today richly bless you amen let's turn our Bibles now to Matthew chapter 10 we're going to read a few verses of scripture here let you be seated Matthew chap 10 verse 5 we probably all know that Matthew 10 of course is the place that Jesus sent his disciples forth gave them commission to go forth to preach and to heal and to uh basically be his extension amen Jesus is was one man when he walked on the earth he had these disciples that he sent forth amen he sent one this way this way this way this way to do to do the work they were the extension of God Amen notice today that we're all over the world Christians godly people Holy Ghost Field Born Again people all over the world doing God's commission still doing God's commission amen his commission still stands for everyone that's a Believer today praise the Lord Jesus amen before we read can we bow our heads for another word of prayer Lord Jesus very thankful once again Lord for your blessings to us for this service Lord and for all that you've done for us to this point God and feeling your presence and knowing you're real yes knowing your blessings that's upon us Lord and you've done so much Lord even to this point in in this service God lord we're just thankful Lord for those that have come those who may be streaming and we're very thankful Lord of your word thankful god of the message and the truth that You' shine upon Our Lives Lord that we have a light to walk in not walking in darkness not groping in darkness but we have light we walk with purpose we walk with meaning we walk with faith because we know the light is shining upon us that every step we take is a positive step it's a right step it's a righteous step Lord because we are walking in your footsteps for the footsteps of a righteous person are ordered of you so we walk in those steps Lord knowing that you have ordered them God to give us that commission yet today because it doesn't change nothing of it changes your word doesn't change you don't change people change circumstances change but you don't you just find another vessel and I pray God that we have a little sample of that example those today Lord you you use others to do your work father that you live through live through US Lord live through us today God and provide and perform all the precious work that you have yet still to do on this Earth we don't know what it is or how much or how long but Lord we want to be faithful to the duty God may you bless this the reading of your word Lord and we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way Lord let it be according to your perfect will father as you bless us in it Lord and we give you thanks and praise for all that you've done all that you're doing and going to do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen praise the Lord Matthew chapter 10 let's begin with verse five amen verse five first few verses just talk about the naming of the 12 disciples but in the fifth verse he says these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not but go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and as you go preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out Devils freely ye have received freely give provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses nor scrip for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet staves for the Workman is worthy of his meat you can be seated if you'd like amen God is our provider God is the one that provides whatever it is that we have need of God is the one that provides it amen and we trust God to bring provision for whatever we have need of and we know here that Jesus as he gave Commission to his disciples as we are Disciples of God today knowing that we receive the same Commission because we are believers today we are the extension that God has moved as he moved out of the Jews as he told them here of course to not go to the Gentiles but as God's Ministry moved from the Gentiles his ministry but the as the Holy Ghost came from the Jews over to the Gentiles that that commission became our commission amen it became the believer's commission commission it become what we know now today it wasn't then we know now today as Christians became the Christian commission the commission was to go into all the world and to preach the gospel the commission was to go out and heal the sick and to raise the dead and to cleanse the lepers and to per and to pray for and allow God to move in us to perform Miracles healings provisions whatever God is going to provide or whatever we might need God sending us forward so that that provision takes place in all of our Lives God has allowed us to do that God has given us that commission but he he gave that commission all of us have it of course but he gave us that commission and then he said he said this to his disciples in but then he said provide neither gold or silver nor brass in your purses amen don't worry about money don't worry about your wallet right then he says nor script for your journey don't take two coats don't take the shoes amen just sandals just your regular Footwear nor stage don't worry about running across uh uh bad people or animals or anything that might hurt you you don't need to take a weapon amen a physical weapon of course the the weapon of war that we have is the word of God but don't take a weapon don't take money don't take don't don't worry about your script don't take two coats don't don't worry about all this that you say I'm going on this long journey we always provide all this stuff we always make sure we have enough money we always sure we make sure and have enough stuff we always make sure we have enough gas to get where we're going and enough provision to take care and provide for ourselves and protect ourselves but God told him he says that you're going on my commission you go with nothing basically go with nothing I will provide it for you because the Workman is worthy of his meat right praise the Lord now we know that today of the provision to say well uh uh it would come from the provision of the hand of so and so but that doesn't matter that's still God I I have never seen $100 bills raining from the sky could God do it absolutely but most of the time if not all the time God has someone else that he's put on their heart as a provision to give right amen not coming from the sky it's not growing on the trees it's not it's not like our tumbling bushes out here crot or it it doesn't come that way it comes from the hand that God uses to provide it with yeah and that's the provision that we know a lot of times we use this as far as giving as unto the Lord giving to a minister a labor is worthy of his hire so on so on such and forth uh so forth but we know that that's God's provision God's doing that it isn't the individual it's God God moving on the hand of somebody how many stories have you heard that uh that somebody comes up and says well uh God I I just had it on my heart to give you this $100 amen and and and you go to say well I I I needed this I needed to pay a bill or I needed to put groceries on the table or I needed something and God put it on that heart to give it to this person because they're the one that need it that's God providing the meat right that's God saying you don't need to worry about staves you don't need to worry about gold silver you don't need to about worry about uh what you buy and what you say and what you do I'll provide it for you even to the point that Jesus told them they will hate you they will put you in jail they will scorge you they will bring you before councils he even told them when you're brought before the council don't worry about what you're going to say right I'll say it through you yeah don't worry about gold silver script coats staves purse don't even worry about what you're going to say I will give to you what you need to say praise the Lord I mean how greater commission could we have what greater provision could we expect from God but then to realize that we walk as in the Lord and God provides every bit of it for us amen this thought come from the misnomer of course that uh all the things that is said and people worry about and uh stuff and election and money going away and all God takes care of us yes God provides for us no matter what it is yes and he s them on this Commission in life and you say I I God hasn't come down to give me this direct commission but it's G he's giving it to us in the scripture we believe the scripture don't we right if we believe the scripture and we believe the scripture applies to us then God is going to be the one to do it he has always done it amen yes the labor is worthy of his hire and God always provides and takes care of even to the point of what you're going to say right amen I tell you when you re when you put God to the test and realize that God will provide what he said he would provide it it takes all the worry away yes it it it takes all the guess workor out of it it takes all the well I wonder if I mean how many times I mean if if God can provide everybody I mean we believe for salvation uh We Trust and Believe that we we know we're we're saved well well if if God is a big enough God to save our souls and to put his life in us then is he not a big enough God to provide for the little things right for the for the tiny things for the things that uh uh uh that that are needed for life for for human existence I mean the greatest gift and the greatest provision will be after this life the the life after this life is the most important thing the soul is what matters not the body but let's go over uh same chapter but 28th verse skip all the other thing down to the 28th verse listen now and fear not them which kill the body but are but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and Body in hell that is God nobody else can do that but the Lord amen are not look it now are not Two Sparrows sold for a farthing that's about that's a couple Cent amen Two Sparrows sold for a farthing which is a a a very insignificant amount of money of a couple pennies if you will and one of them shall not fall fall on the ground without your father in other words not one of them will fall unless God knows about it God knows God cares one Sparrow that's worth a a penny maybe one sparrow that falls God knows about it God's concerned about it God cares about it and if God does that for them he said What About Us what about us which in US is a soul worth 10 million worlds what could you think of the value of the world would be today what what would you consider the world of the the value of the world is today we've got how many billionaires that have M that have uh uh more money than they'll spend in a 100 lifetimes we got uh trillions of dollars of national debt how much do you think this world is worth they talk about simple hurricane coming through a a a state or a city and the billions of dollars it's going to cost to rebuild it that's just one city that's just one area what do you think about the entire world now obviously in the United States we're one of the wealthiest if not the wealthiest country in the world so everything that we have is exuberant and expensive uh if something like that were to go through some parts of India it would cost about 50 cents are rebuild because they're just grass huts and and bamboo or something that's holding up a a mud hut or something you just take some more mud and just put it all back up just cut down some more bamboo and get some more pom PS you got a whole house again I mean you talk about 50 Cent to build rebuild uh 10 bucks to rebuild the whole little town so it's different of course in different parts of the world here we're very extravagant uh of of people uh if you go through it the same thing goes to Cyclone or hurricane goes to a certain city billions of dollars to rebuild it amen how much would it be worth but brother bam said now he said it two different ways I know brother green always said uh brother johnon I believe it was said that worth 10,000 but I also found several quotes where brother bam said the soul is worth 10 million worlds amen which bottom line is is priceless so's prices was it's 10,000 10 million 10 billion uh the point is it's Priceless so what do you think then one Sparrow fault now how about us Soul's worth 10 billion worlds Sparrow's worth a penny then 10 billion worlds 10 million worlds whatever it is priceless and what about us look continue on 30th verse but the very hairs of your head are all all numbered and that's a good thing cuz I washed a bunch of them down the drain this morning uh I'm I'm thankful there goes number 2,861 2,862 actually probably more in the millions by now it seems like anyway they're falling out more and more quicker and quicker faster and faster but um um they're turning loose faster than I can keep them coming but anyway they're all numbered God has them all numbered that just I read that again this morning and it just blows my mind I just can't fathom that they think well I could number every hair on my head you probably could theoretically sit down or somebody with you could and take a little tape or something and wrap every hair and put one two I mean it might take you a long time but you could probably theoretically do that amen but God knows not just your hairs but everybody's billions of people billions of people Quin Tuple numbers of hair he has every one of them number I just I that just that's the God we're talking about that is the provider that we're talking about no wonder he's all we need if he can number every hair on everybody's head from beginning of of creation to today what is the little things that we worry about so many times that we fret over so much that seems like it's going to be the end of the world and God just it doesn't even not even a snap of a finger not even a twinkling of an eye less than that God changed the whole circumstance built on our faith obviously God provides always provides is said what am I going to do if this happens what am I going to do if this goes away what am I going to do if this God's going to take care of me God's going to watch after you amen If he if he thought enough of you to save your soul he is not going to let you go down a garbage dumb he never seen the righteous forsaken or seed begging bread God will always provide it may not be everything that you want but I guarantee you it will be everything that you need right amen God is sending God will take care of God's Great God's will will not lead you where God's grace cannot keep you right amen and if you fall you walk along in God's perfect will in your life even permissive will that we fall into even in in God's will per perfect or permissive God will still take care of you yes the RO the harder Road will be the permissive road but God will still provide yes God will still take care of you God will still always be there I Stumble and fall God will still be there all you have to do is get back up amen make a mistake all you've got to do is get back up God will still be there that's right amen God has left me no he hasn't you left him you may have left him but God never leaves us that's right God will always protect and take every hair I just still I still can't I just bogles the mind I know brother BR made statements like how many gats there would be and how many times it bat its eyes and how much Tallow every Gat would make these these kinds of analogies just uh blow my mind yeah it just blows my mind 31st verse fear ye not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows or you say the word many doesn't seem like very much but uh it is when you look at the rest the the prospect of it when God is showing it through US amen praise the Lord we're here working to do the same thing now Matthew chapter 14 shortly after all this provision all this promise all that God said still doubt amen with us with the disciples there's still doubt God help us God help our carnality God help our Humanity God help our flesh God help our minds there always there's still those things there of reasoning and and and and imaginations and things that flood our spirit that caus us to start doubting again amen uh it's like uh brother no was saying the other day I think it was him said it they they saw Jesus come walking on the water yeah and think he they think it's some kind of evil spirit or something he gets closer to the boat and they say oh no it's Jesus and Peter looks and says it is Jesus hey Jesus can I come Jesus said come on he hops out of the boat walks right over to Jesus he's doing fine till he started looking at all the circumstances right he started looking at everything around him started looking out the improbability of a human being being able to walk on water and he started to reason and then he started to sing amen but when he started to sink what happened to him God grabbed him God grabbed him pulled him back up and they walked to the boat together praise the Lord God was there for him God took care of him but still in the midst of that there was that little doubt that came in yes amen and and we deal with that all the time s we all do still walking this journey still walking this walk that's that's what we deal with now Jesus is dealing with that here and let's read we know the stories uh of the fishes and Loaves but let's go over and read uh in the 14th chapter 15th verse Matthew 14:15 amen Jesus is gotten quite a following a lot of people following around amen Jesus had compassion on them Jesus prayed for them Jesus healed some their their sickness Jesus ministered to them amen I mean what greater thing to think that you've got people in your custody if you will that you're able to influence that you're able to speak to that you're able to help I me that's a big thing uh especially today A lot of times people Garner in the world today they'll Garner big followings and they'll Garner a lot of people that have confidence in them and and for what purpose uh to spe some kind of rhetoric or something to try to uh uh convince them of this that and the other things that's really insignificant Jesus garnered a following uh uh uh there was no internet there was no computers uh there was no social media so there was no Tik Tok there was nothing that you could see that's suround the world uh to be a social media influencer no these were people that were bodily in presence with Jesus Christ right they were there and he had a following what better thing do you think to have that you can have a following of people to have enough for respect and enough confidence in you that when you speak to them you can help them but look what the disciples say 15th verse now and when it was evening his disciples came to him saying this is a desert place in the time is now passed send the multitude away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves fiddles um we finally got people there's a group of people here that I can minister to there's a multitude of people here that I can preach to that I can help that I can try to guide into the kingdom of heaven and you want me to send them away I'm not going to send those people anywhere they're staying right here I'm going to keep them right here so I can minister to them so that I can speak to them so that I can minister to their needs heal the sicknesses you keep them right right here don't send them away amen there it's again worried about their tummies right oh my God help us we're all worried about our tummy so much amen fast a little bit you'll you'll stop worrying about your tummies so much amen that's the truth friends amen I I speak from personal experience you all given enough to know my family my wife knows when I was in North Carolina I I fasted every week I still fast every Sunday morning I never eat till after church even if church is at 1:00 uh if we have 4 5:00 in the afternoon before I get a meal I don't eat on Sunday morning I don't I drink a little water that's it I have no coffee my wife knows I have coffee every morning have no coffee this is all I have on Sunday mornings but I had back there I dedicated I was at lunch one time I said Lord I'm going to dedicate this to you and I took every Wednesday and I fasted I didn't didn't drink I didn't eat I didn't no water no crackers nothing all day every Wednesday I fasted I took my lunchtime at work even if someone was calling on me and we usually went to lunch together sales consults I always want to take you to lunch uh the big social convention you know let's go to lunch okay let's go to lunch and talk it out we don't talk enough now but we eat anyway I take that time and I would go I would get in my car and go find an empty he plac in the parking lot somewhere I sit there and pray to God for my whole lunch hour and just talk to him not not not even I say necessarily pray just talk to him amen and I got to the place to where my body I was in control of my body I got to the place where my B where I told my body when and what it was going to eat right that's just that just I mean I'm not a doctor I don't know if that happens to everybody but happened to me my body found out who was control who was in charge it's me that's right and so many times we're so worried about our tummies amen that we forget there's a God that provides for us and takes care of us amen God takes care of us praise the Lord amen the Bible doesn't say to pray fast it says pray and fast not pray fast pray and fast I believe that's a valuable thing that we need to try to get back to sometimes and not and not take that and this is not on fasting but the Lord just put them on my heart just now so I got to say what he tells me to say but take that time that you're not say well I I I'm fasting today so uh you know I'm GNA go play ball or something or a video game or whatever no take that time and dedicate that time instead of uh uh filling our tummies take that time and give it to God take that time and spend it with the Lord It's read praying listen toate whatever it is takey that time specifically dedicated to God not to your flesh but to God I tell you what you see some different you'll see some changes happen in your life I promise you that and it's not my promise I'm promising because it's in the scripture it's God's promise not mine that's why I can say it's a it's a promise God said it not me amen you see God do things God is a miracle working God he expects from us God has see Jesus had influence over these people Jesus had these people here and he had gared their confidence and they're wored and and and his disciples are wored as human as humans as carnal they're worried about their tummies well let them go get something to eat no you keep them right here they're going to stay here well we don't have any we don't have any food for these people Jesus look but Jesus said unto them they need not depart give them to eat give ye them to eat they said unto him we have not but Five Loaves and two fishes a little boy here had his lunch Five Loaves and two fish said we got Five Loaves and two fishes he said bring them hither to me right I'll take care of that see that's what got in my heart the other day when brother Noel was talking about that story when uh was it him talking about the soup and all these people started showing up and we're like we don't have near enough soup for all these people but every time they kept dipping out soup there was soup to dip out Hallelujah and everybody ate to their full and there was soup left over y amen I said now I think praise the Lord that's God providing right A lot of people say oh hurry run to the store hurry go get some of this hurry we need to make some more soup all go to the whatever soup it was if it's bazoli or something make make go to the Mexican restaurant just buy something and we'll no God will provide just let God provide yes amen what do you do bring them hither to me he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass he took the Five Loaves of two fishes looked up to heaven and he blessed it praise God there you go there's your key that unlocks the door bless it he blessed it he break it gave the Lo to the disciples and the and the disciples to the multitude he blessed it and when he blessed it what happened Hallelujah a miracle took place Hallelujah and he fed thousands of people with a couple of fish and Five Loaves thousands of people and how many basket loads did they have left over amen good I was going to read that but very good and and we may get to that but they took up 12 baskets of fragments that was left over look friend the original the the original Five Loaves and two fishes wouldn't fill up five 12 baskets right the original meal wouldn't fill up 12 baskets but they had fed everybody 5,000 I think it was in this one it's 5,000 10,000 anyway 5,000 not counting the women and children fed 5,000 with two loaves uh Five Loaves and two fishes and 12 baskets left over and didn't have to start with 12 baskets full hallelujah praise God you tell me how that works you tell me I'm going to hit it again you tell me that God can't multiply whatever you've got yes you ask God to bless it you give it and God will multiply it amen again it's like the iron floating it's like the tith giving you just bless it you give it and God multiplies it how he does it I don't know but you'll end up with more than you started with amen amen praise the Lord let me read through the rest of this he blessed it there's your key he blessed it break it gave the loaves to the disciples the Disciples of the multitude and they did all eat and were filled and took up of the fragments that remain 12 baskets full praise the Lord and and they that had eaten were about 5,000 men besides the women and children weren't even talking about the women and children just the men that were 5,000 four loaves oh think God can't do it amen you believe God can do that today amen he absolutely can Will and does praise God God's provision God takes care of it in the service of the Lord God makes a way 15th chapter let's go over to the 15th chapter just one over still in Matthew Matthew 15 uh 32 then Jesus called his disciples unto him and said I have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat and I will not send them away fasting lest they faint in the way and his disciples said unto him which when should we have so much bread in the wilderness as to fill so great a multitude and Jesus said unto them how many loaves have you and they said seven and a few little fishes and he commanded the multitude again sit on the ground he took the seven Loaves and the fishes and gave thanks and break them he blessed it amen break them gave them to the disciples the disciples to the multitude and they all ate to their field again again now that you you've already seen this happen one time let's just put ourselves in this scenario you've seen it happen one time you saw where you had Five Loaves Jesus had Five Loaves and two fishes you saw that he fed 5,000 people plus the women and children you saw that that there were 12 basketfuls of fragments taken up after everybody was full and you still question God are you really still going to question God that's my question not just in the story but to us are we still going to question God because Jesus told them I don't want to send them away because they need to eat and I want them to stay here but then the disciples 33rd verse again look again they said unto him when when should we have so much bread in the wilderness to fill so great a multitude did you not just see him feed 5,000 plus the women and children with Five Loaves and two fish did you not just see that did that not just happened and you doubt him again already how many times has God provided how many go times has God taken care of how many times has God healed how many miracles have you seen performed in your life or your family and yet we question oh God going to do it again will he do it again yes oh help us Lord help thou my I believe Lord help thou my unbelief amen there's still question again J said just bring them here again what do you do it did the exact same thing took the bread and Fishes he asked he thanked and Bre and blessed it and he began to break it they gave it to them and everybody was filled yes Hallelujah the disciples they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full again more left over in fragments than what there was when he started God praise the Lord how does that work Saints you'd tell this to some unbelieving scientists and they would put you in a rubber room in a straight jacket they would think you are completely crazy this did not happen oh either that it would TR try to figure out some way to scientifically prove how this could happen amen they always people always trying to scientifically Fe well yeah this could have the The Parting of the the Red Sea could happen because there's a great wind that come in look friend the the I don't mean to be contrary please forgive me if I am if somebody's watching this and you feel differently I'm okay I know it it was by the Breath of God but when a wind comes in outside I am old enough and hopefully intelligent enough to know that when the wind blows a certain way the flag goes like this or my hair blows like this but let me tell you Saints the seed didn't blow to one side he parted the Red Sea is that not scripture right he took the Red Sea and divided it now how if the wind is coming this way did the waves go that way how did this go this way or the way go this way if the wind's blowing this way if the wind's blowing this way yeah I could see but how did he part it yeah amen oh well the wind was going this way and he parted it you mean he took an arrow sharp wind amen I see I'm trying to take this out of trying to reason with God away right then say that God by his Miracle working ability is by his breath divided this this Red Sea amen can he take the wind and do it absolutely but that's the Breath of God but he split the Red Sea in half yeah so they could walk on what dry ground dry ground now you tell me what East Wind did that this is a miracle Saints this is a supernatural event we cannot dumb it down with trying to scientifically prove it amen but people would try to do it all the time yeah these are super Supernatural events that we can't dumb down with some kind of scientific proof this is God the miracle working God that we know he is providing for his children yes yes you are Lord providing a way that we can that we are all able to be able to be partakers of it look we know this very familiar uh scripture to First Kings I'm leaving off my notes now but first Kings chapter 17 another story that falls exactly in in the same line that's what we're talking about First Kings 178 and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise unto Elijah arise get to uh get thee to zarapa which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he arose and went to zarap and when he come to the gate of the city Behold a widow woman was was there Gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand and she said as the as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful now my hand is fairly big it's probably bigger than hers was most men's hands are bigger than lady's hands she had a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a crws and said behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat and die I got just enough meal for a cake for me and my son and just enough oil to make up that cake so that me and my son is going to be our last supper amen where have you heard that before it's going to be our last supper we're going to eat it we're going to die because that's all we have left nothing left amen Elijah said unto her fetch not uh F fear not go and do as thou has said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son now that sounds kind of selfish but what God's doing to Elijah is trying to teach and help this woman learn obedience right amen if you do what is asked of you amen then I will take care of the rest amen it's like a it's like so many scriptures we quote often and sometimes we forget some of the more important parts of those scriptures like uh resist the devil and he'll flee from you well that sounds all great and good and it's true but you can't leave off the first part of that scripture that says submit yourselves therefore unto God right and if you don't submit yourself therefore unto God you can try to resist the devil all you want and it will do you no good that's right you must first submit yourself therefore unto God then you can resist the devil and he has to flee praise God you've got to take all of the scripture and when Elijah is telling this woman that to in in obedience to make me a cake first he's not being selfish right but he knows what God's going to do and he's testing her faith he's trying her faith is she going to do what the prophet is asking what God is asking and do this or is she going to be rebellious and say oh no no no no what's left over is going to be for me and my son no had to be obedient he said bring me one first then make for you in your sin in other words if you make me one there'll be enough for you and your son for thus sayith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruise of oil fell until the day that the Lord sendeth rain on upon the Earth and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days and the barrel of the mill wasted not neither did the cruise of oil fell according to the word of the Lord which was spoke by Elijah right amen we got a pot of soup and we got a thousand people to feed it with what you going to do just keep dipping soup I have just enough meal and oil just for two people what you going to do I'm just going to keep dipping meal I'm just going to keep mixing mixing oil I'm just going to keep baking cakes amen and every time she went to that Barrel there was food there to cake every time she went to that cruise of oil there was oil there to make the cake with every time she needed it it was there to provide and they ate for many days her and her house and the oil never ran dry and the meal never ran out right praise God because God is the provider look friend the United States government is not your provider I might get in trouble saying that on on YouTube but they are not your provider God is your provider right your employer is not your provider God is your provider amen God will take take care of you regardless of anything else happens there's people in this message I don't techically agree with them brother R talked about concentration camps in Alaska a lot of people preach I've heard preachers preach that the bride's going to be stuck in concentration yet I don't particularly believe that brother Bram didn't say that amen he didn't say that like that anyway so I'm not trying to be contrary to brother brandham uh I'm trying to take what he said and apply it to the rest of the the word and the message scripturally to to to develop what I believe my faith and and my trust of what the word says Amen brother brandom says this bride doesn't go through a bunch of punishment right amen will there be some persecution at the end absolutely May there be some times around the world where there we there will be bride may not be everybody around the world but in certain parts of the world there may be bride that may end up in situations not necessar concentration camps but need an absolute miracle from God to be able to make it the next day the next week next month amen may not happen in this country I don't know right but that's up to God but regardless God's our provider yes regardless of what happens he will take care of us I mean how many stories have we heard I I get a flood of stories that come to my mind now I don't want I don't want to replicate them them all but or give them to you but uh how many stories you heard of of of of the provision of God like this amen story of people sitting down at the dinner I remember one in particular I'll say real quick sitting down at dinner and you've probably all heard it and I probably missed some of the details but uh am and his family they had nothing to eat they gathered around the table to eat their family dinner like they normally did and he said uh you know so and so bite your head to pray but there's no food what AM my blessing just pray me just pray and bless it pray it and bless it while there's in the middle of their prayer there's a knock at the door and somebody come with bags loads of groceries to give to them how do you explain that how do you reason that away how do you scientifically prove that that's just a miracle that's just God I was walking around this place and I was praying this morning like I always do and I I I just thank God I thank him all the time for it but I look and I even see this us getting this being here from where we were on Coro this is a miracle this is a miracle that God provided this everything that's here and everything that's done and everything that's given us is just a miracle that we have it so thankful I don't ever God help me ever want to be uh take for granted what God done for us amen what God's given us God's a miracle working God God's provider God will take care of us regardless of the circumstance or situation he's still God Amen he still does it I mean when I started looking at this friend there were absolutely no shortage of scriptures there was no shortage of stories there was no shortage of testimonies that I could give that that would give to you how God provides Abraham taking his son and God said take your son your only son right God that's what God told him to do go take your son your only son and go up to a place I'll show you a sacrifice him that's what God said well we know God doesn't accept human sacrifices so that you know but Abraham was there it's different when you look back and you think on things than it is when you're in the mid middle of it uh when you when you look out and you see a tornado headed right at you it's one thing but when you look back and you see the tornado's gone and it's it's done and over with that's a different story amen when you're in the middle of the Whirlwind it's a whole different story than looking back on something or or somebody saying well if it was me I would have that's okay I I that's fine I probably do that too yeah if I had been there if that if that was me I would have done so you do not know what you would do unless you're in that situation that's just the B to me that's my belief as the bottom line you don't know what you're going to do till you get to that somebody says I've heard people say oh if I get rich uh if I win the lottery or whatever it is first thing I'm G to do is pay my ties I think you do you pay them now right then you're probably not going to pay them then but you don't see people don't know they no no what you're going to do until they get in that situation amen but the understanding the faith to realize that God provides it it is a great Revelation that we have look going back to the Loaves and Fishes brother imperfect Faith a Critic once said that no wonder Jesus could take Five Loaves and five thou and feed 5,000 said the loaves were bigger in that day big enough one loaf to feed a thousand P people that loaf would be the size of my car and a boy is carrying around in his lunch pil no wonder he could feed 5,000 the loaves were bigger in that day he just cut each loaf to feed a thousand brother Brandon says I give you to understand that a little boy had it in his lunch a little child packed Five Loaves of bread that could beat 5,000 people and be full and that was again that's not counting the women and children let alone the 12 baskets they took up afterwards all the critics just always somebody critic somebody to criticize amen but it it has to be the faith see when Abraham took Isaac up there he didn't know what God was going to do he was in the middle of the hurricane he was in the middle of the tornado he was in the middle of the storm friend he didn't know what God was going to do all he knew is this is what God said he tried to obey it the best that he could and he took his son up there he bound him he got the altar he got the wood he got everything ready and was just about to take the knife to plunge into his son's throat and God stopped him an angel called from heaven and said Abraham Abraham Abraham said yeah I'm I'm right here he said don't hurt your boy amen that God's providing himself don't hurt him amen you have now proed that you you will not withhold anything from me not even your only son the son of promise and as he was hearing that voice he heard a crackle in the thicket behind you and he turned around and there's a ram right there stuck in the thicket goes over against the lamb sacrifices them and they go back home amen God providing God always provides when how many times in Samson's life Samson had the strength but one time he had thousands of soldiers with helmets and in Stick coming at him he looked around and found an old dried up jaw B Jawbone of a of a mule and he beat down and cracked the helmets of thousand of them with the Jawbone of of a of a mule thousand of them oh it the Bible says it was a new Jawbone but obviously it had been decayed down to the point that it was just bone right he beat a thousand of them with one Jawbone you think that was Samson that was God Amen but it was God in Samson remember don't forget that part that is the most important part friend yes God does it but God does it through us God uses us Amen to do his work God uses us our our spiritual Acuity our spiritual ears need to be uh in tune to listen to what God wants to wants to tell us where God wants to send us what God wants us to do and make sure it's God Amen because the devil speaks too and you don't want to go uh down that road that road leads you in a wrong place but when God's speaking amen my sheep hear my voice they know my voice amen they'll follow me they won't follow anybody else they don't listen when the devil speaks they don't listen but they know my voice my my sheep know my voice you you you know his voice when he speaks then you do what he asks amen we try to follow with the spirit as God gives it to us Amen to be led by his Spirit I'm going to close here Philippians amen I had several of the scriptures I was going to read but I think I think we've got the point the place we're at scripturally and and I'm sure as so many times I know it's so many times it happens happens to me when the ministry is going forth there's probably stories in your mind that you know when God took care of you when God provided for you whether it was monetary whether it was spiritual whether it was Financial whether it was emotional whether it was mental uh whatever the condition whether it was something you needed maybe it's something you need to get rid of maybe it was uh a provision whatever it was I mean maybe like my kid you're falling down out of a tree when you're a little kid and you're just sailing backwards just waiting for this thud or whatever's going to happen and and something catches you yeahall two Arms Reach Out invisible arms and catch you hallelujah how do you explain that how does the little I don't even remember how old he was but how does the 10 12 year old boy how do you make that up it just it just doesn't happen and you know how many times there's things in your life I know that you're thinking about them amen you're remembering times when God provided for you when God performed a miracle when God took care of you when God provided amen God does Philippians Now read this we'll close here Philippians chapter 4 Philippians 4:19 but my God is he your God Amen my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus now what are his riches you can't sell that short either well what are his riches well we talk about the Earth his riches are the Earth planets solar system galaxies uh everything that's contained in them everything that's about them everything that's ever been created amen and that's what separates people come up and say well you know take a scriptural story and say well I could do that I could create that and you know that one time that skeptic came to brother Brandon and and with that attitude brother Ram says okay build me a blade of [Music] grass give me a give me a grass seed no no no no you got to come up with your own seed this is creation you don't take something to make something out of something no no that's not creation right that's replication amen take nothing and make something out of it well I can't do that of course you can God can God takes nothing and makes something out of it praise the Lord that's why he can provide whatever our needs are what are his riches everything anything everything way so far beyond anything that we can even imagine or think it's God Amen and he's the provider every bit of it as your as his air belongs to you if we can just tap into it a little bit amen amen recognize God is our provider God takes care of us amen praise the Lord let's stand if we could how many times we said little is much if God is in it amen don't think about much about some things looks seems small little but little as much if God is in amen praise the Lord Jesus praise God Amen let's sing this course I think I've got it here the name he's everything to me Psalm number 70 maybe Michael put it on the screen for us
