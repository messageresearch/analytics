god bless you amen thank you for coming tonight um my family and father brother john thank you for being here amen appreciate you being here and it's kind of tough to minister just to a camera i've done it but uh it really helps when there's spaces out there and there's amen's coming this way so i certainly do appreciate that amen each one of you may be streaming tonight pray the lord bless you as well let's turn our bibles down to romans chapter 14. we're gonna begin reading with verse one romans 14 1. romans 14 1. we'll read a few verses of scripture to get our thought from time amen romans 14 1. before we read the word though our heads for another word of prayer lord jesus father we are very thankful of all that you've done for us lord and for this week that you've given us thus far for this day for this service tonight we're so appreciative of god for health and strength and life in our bodies for the desire to come to the house of god expecting to meet with you lord expecting to hear from you expecting you lord to take complete control over this service and your holy spirit to come and move in a special lord we're expecting lord for you to do the exceedingly and abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think where we are two or three are gathered lord tonight we're here in your name god we thank you father for this building thank you for the blessings you give us every day lord we rebuke every demonic spirit lord it would try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this service in any way that you would get the glory and the praise for all that is said and done help those who may be streaming those who may have wanted to come not were able to tonight lord in each one that is here god may we just uh get your blessings fresh once again yes lord from the throne of god as you would speak to us from your word accomplish that in it what you'd have it to be done we'll thank you and praise you for all things in jesus christ's name amen amen amen saint uh or saint romans we're going to read from amen romans let's see if we get this what would you start with verse 1 amen roman romans chapter 14 verse 1 him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbs let not him that edith despise him that eateth not and let him and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth him that eateth for god hath received him who art thou that judges another man's servant to his own master he standeth her falleth yea he has he shall be hold it up for god is able to make him stand one man esteem one day above another another esteem every day alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the lord and he that regardeth not the day to the lord he doth not regard it he that eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thanks and he that eateth not to the lord he doeth not and giveth god thanks for none of us liveth to ourselves and no man diet to himself for whether we live we live unto the lord whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live there for or die we are the lords for to this end christ both died and rose and revived that he might be lord both of the dead and living amen you could be seated if you'd like we'll end that there that's quite a unusual writing but the point's very clear uh if you're used to reading uh the english vernacular it's uh when um and and i don't know what all the terminology of the adjectives and adverbs and all i don't know what all that means for or which ones which is the sum i can get but you know when they start putting certain things out of order it gets a little complicated to read but the point is very clear amen and jesus through paul of course paul speaking to the roman church is saying that him that eateth uh him that him that is weak in the faith receive you but not to doubtful disputations in other words that means hypocritically right not not saying okay i receive you but uh and there's always the butts people have the butts and people say well you know i like you i accept you but uh i i don't think uh you know you're gonna make it welcome to our church but i don't think you're gonna last very long that's exactly what jesus is telling them not to do and uh i i want to i want to talk about um as unto the lord amen uh because that's i believe what this was all about this little section of scripture reading is all about as as unto the lord what we do we do is unto the lord amen whether you regard the day you regard it unto the lord if you don't regard the day you don't regard the day unto the lord if you eat herbs you you give god thanks if you don't you give god thanks whatever it is that you do you do unto the lord amen and that's the whole point is is what we do we do unto the lord and if we do it unto the lord we're gonna we're gonna do it with an open heart and with an open mind with an open spirit you know the anointing of the day or one of the anointings of the day is is that people are so quick to condemn someone just because they don't think like me or just because they don't think like you uh now that that's one thing out in the world because that spirit is out in the world but friend we can't let that spirit of the world get on to us get on to the christian get onto the uh uh the the godly level-headed thinking people to understand that you could have just as good a valid opinion as i could in fact i could be absolutely 100 wrong you can be 100 right but i can be so stubborn about it that i'm not not even willing to listen to you and see that's that's one of the anointings that's going on in the world today uh your opinion doesn't matter if it's not like mine that that's that's the way the world and especially this country anyway is going if you don't if you don't think about it the way i do you're wrong if you don't say it the way i do you're wrong if you don't sing that song the way i sing it you're wrong and that's not the way it's supposed that's not the christian attitude if we do it as unto the lord we worship we praise we accept it as a lord right and that's what the that's what paul is telling them here see one might be weak in faith well they they if they're weak in faith pray for them don't put them down right no don't don't make fun of them don't talk about them don't say well they're never going to amount to anything oh they're never going to make it all they're never gonna no uphold that person encourage them don't receive them hypocritically don't receive them and say oh i i received you but receive them as unto the lord how would jesus receive them right well when he receives them he dotted calvary to receive them so if he gave his life to receive them then what should we do that's why paul said we do it but we don't do it with all of our heart we don't do it with all of our with all of our mind with all of our soul we don't give everything to it and if whatever we do everything we do we should do is unto the lord everything we should do we should give a hundred percent of what we do no matter what it is amen i i said here a couple of weeks ago i i mentioned because it just came on my heart and uh it was something i guess that the lord wanted to say then but uh for a subject for tonight but i mentioned one time i said every time you sisters cook a meal for your husband you're not cooking that for your husband you're cooking it for god every time i said every time the blade of that shovel hits the dirt when i have to dig a ditch i'm doing it listen to god i'm not doing it to get paid although i am i'm not doing it to get the job done although i am i'm doing it as unto the lord every roof i climb on every house i get under every pinch every blister every cut every zap electricity i get is unto the lord every meal you cook everything you do every speck of dust you wipe up you do it as unto the lord amen that's the way it should be everything we do we give a hundred percent so many times we think oh i'm not gonna do that or i'm not gonna do that for them or i'm not you know friend when does it come to the time where where that that decision process that god gives us excludes so many things in people i i just don't understand it you know i i was thinking the other day was um we were doing a job and and i think when when i when i go to a person's house i treat that person's house like that's god's house that's how i would want them to treat my house right true i and i treat it i look at it as that's that's god's house that he gave me an opportunity to work on this this is this is god's possession and that's why i try to treat things that way i know that's lost today but the fact of living for christ is lost today on most people and so a lot of that gets lost but that anointing comes in and tries to infiltrate in us right and we try to get by with just doing a little here a little there or giving fifty percent giving a seventy percent friend everything we should do we should do is unto the lord whatever it is every load of laundry that you that you do every time you hit a computer button every time you get in your car and drive every time that you you you give it you give it as unto the lord that's why we we pray for our food we thank god we give god thanks for what we're about to eat and that's why we we do it because it's unto the lord everything we do we regard to the lord everything it doesn't matter what it is we do it as unto the lord because that is our life the world doesn't they don't care and and you can see now by the way things are that you you try to you try to believe and think of the world and and and this country is as being a a good foundation fundamentally sound morally uh uh uh standard people you know if there's a job to be done they're gonna do it that was 80 years ago that was 50 years ago right it just doesn't seem to be the way it is anymore unfortunately right people just don't care but that anointing can't come on to the christian that anointing can't come on to us that anointing can't overtake us to where we think oh my i gotta i gotta do this again i gotta give this again i gotta be over here again i gotta do this again you do it as unto the lord if god's leading you especially do it as unto the lord amen we give us unto the lord we give what gets put in tithes offerings uh what we give ministers and mission field and and what we give we give it is unto the lord every penny that goes in that box you're not giving it to me right you give it us to the lord right when i do it i give it to the lord right amen because that's what we're supposed to do when we write the check at the end of the month to pay rent for this place i do it as unto the lord amen because that's what we're that's what we're supposed to do amen everything we do and god will bless you for that right god will multiply you for that god will increase you mightily if we do it in faith people sometimes give us you know i'll not kick a little you know stretch that dollar so thin that by the time you've done george washington's ball is an eagle shaped every speck of hair on his head god loves the cheerful gifts and that doesn't just mean monetarily right that's that means in everything you do yes and everything you do you do it as unto the lord if you do something you can do it to the as unto the lord that's why we do it look he said paul said here he said seventh verse none of us liveth to ourselves and no man diet to us to himself we don't live to ourselves and who are we living for yeah a lot of people living for themselves the selfishness of the world a lot of people may be living for somebody else some people may be living for a church or a minister or an organization of some kind some people may be living for this sports event or this sporting team or or some they'll paint themselves all up and they'll shave their heads and they'll turn purple and yellow just to go to try to because they live for that that's what they live for right but if we're christians we live unto the lord that's the only reason we live the only purpose for our lives is that we do it for the lord i'm alive because i'm alive to him only reason amen we die we die to uh we don't die to ourselves who dies unto the lord that's that's why we expect to go see him when we're done for whether we live we live unto the lord whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lord amen for to this end christ both died and rose and revived that he might be lord both of the dead and of the living amen what we do that's why we do it we do it as unto the lord now let's go over to acts chapter 5. amen acts chapter 5 i know it's a strain a lot of people don't have that attitude a lot of people around you don't feel the same way or act the same way they get by in their jobs as little as they can i mean as long as they can get that paycheck from week to week they just get by as little as they can possibly get by they used to be in the corporate world i've seen many of them amen get by as little as they can one time we were up and i think i told you maybe we were uh doing that big job up in oracle and trying to put the electric underground for this big rv park and we were gonna dig this big long ditch 30 30 inches deep 150 feet long so brother roger was getting some help he went to a labor a day place one guy he put the shovel to the dirt and he was digging the other guy he got the manic and he hit a few things and he'd just stand there and he'd hit a couple and he'd just stand there and then pretty soon uh i got over to where i was shoveling uh shoveling out the ditch and and he just and he's standing there talking the next 30 minutes all he did is talk just trying to get away with standing there and doing nothing but still get paid right right and he did about an hour's work maybe and that's generous and going and and roger just told him look if you're not gonna work leave wow so steve buffles uh who was there and kind of helping supervise uh brother rogers said go ahead and take him back so they went back and the guy was expecting to get paid for the day he wasn't even there but two hours and probably didn't do 30 minutes work tops right but he wanted to get paid for the day oh my i think brother roger finally paid him two hours told the people took it back said he was worthless i think he finally agreed to pay him two hours he wanted to pay for the whole day he did nothing he wanted to get paid for doing nothing and it seems like unfortunately that's kind of the way it is brother john you have a hard time finding good health absolutely amen brother rogers tried to find some good health before and uh unfortunately you had to settle with me and i don't know how good that is but uh i guess we do all right but it's hard to find somebody willing to work are they willing to do a job somebody willing to do a job right right because they have negated the very fundamental foundation that holds it all together and that's christ if you don't have christ as your substance and your point and your foundation then none of it matters none of it amounts to anything if you're living to yourself then you have nothing amen you will die to yourself but if you do it as unto the lord then you'll have him and he will give you the strength and he will bless you to do it god's not going to cause you to do something that you are incapable of doing right although sometimes i feel that but but he's not going to do that right he would when when god puts something for you to do he's going to allow you to have the ability to be able to do it amen acts chapter 5 now verse 33. amen now they captured uh peter and some of the disciples and they were gonna stone them even talked about putting them to death going to kill them and verse 33 after peter witnessed when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them but look at this now then stood there up one in the council a pharisee named gamaliel a doctor of the law had a reputation among all the people commanded to put the apostles forth a little space and said unto them ye men of israel know whereas he took peter and them and set them aside and started to speak to those that were that were supposed to be the religious leaders the men that were supposed to be in charge of religiously spiritually supposed to be in charge gamalia started speaking to him his is a doctor of law but he had enough sense to know how to discern right right and how to understand and so he put peter the messiah when he saw that they were about to kill him he put him aside and said wait a minute brothers let's hold a second here he said unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men right for before these days rose up uh theaters boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about 400 400 men joined themselves unto he uh joined themselves who was slain this man got killed and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to nothing 400 followed this person amen and what happened it came to nothing why because he was living unto himself he was not living as unto the lord he was living as unto himself so the work came to nothing after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed and now i say unto you refrain from these men let them alone for if this council or this work be of men it will come to knock if it's a man it'll come to nothing it means nothing there's no point to it well so and so is that there's there's a church full of people but if it's not of god it'll come to nothing now today now there was a time scripturally where those people met their demise because that's the day that they lived amen they met a demise mostly now this day is not so much because this is the very deceptive age of laodicea and we know that and the deception is going to be great the demise today isn't so much a physical demise as much as it is a spiritual demise yes the good part about this would be so close to see the very elective possible the good thing about this is that only the elect will know what is right in god and what is wrong and of man right the elect will know the holy ghost field person will know god's children will know and it will come to nothing now they may have some great big work going on it may be a church full of people there may be thousands of them following that but what's it gonna come to if it's of a man it's gonna come to nothing are thousands gonna follow it oh sure it might be thousands might be tens of thousands follow it but it will still come to nothing not spiritually amen there would be spiritual death once it was physical death now it's a spiritual death once when it came to nothing it was because of their demise today it's a spiritual death and they are a lot they're dead while they're getting living right right they don't know it amen people so many times people today are fighting and resisting against god and they don't even realize it right fighting against god resisting the very move of god and they don't even realize how many you've recognized what god is doing and seeing the work of god in the hand the the hand of god in the situation and recognize god is moving with that people god is moving with that with that congregation or that uh move or whatever it is right and if god's not necessarily monetarily oh they they they you can't count monetary i mean they got buildings that are just built of gold and treasures and everything else it's not that there's plate there's churches that have converted basketball stadiums into churches filling them up two and three a week amen but is it of god right i didn't say it wasn't right but the question is is it of god because if it's not a god it'll come to nothing if it if it is of god amen now look what gamalia said now if it's if it's not of god refrain from these men let them alone for if this council or this work be of men it will come to not but amen there we go but if it is of god no matter if the person eats herbs amen i said paul said that may be weak in faith if they eat herbs but don't don't discount that person don't dismiss that person hold that person up encourage them give them a good word of encouragement positive and uplift them pray for them see if god might move in their life amen because if the work is of god ye cannot praise the lord you cannot overthrow it lest happily ye be found even to fight against god fighting against god so many people it seems that they are fighting against god resisting god coming against god and don't even realize it they think and and the bible says they would kill you thinking they're doing god a favor right amen and we thought that was going to be from out in the world seems like it's going to be right here in the ranks yeah that they're killing you now how can they kill you not just with a gun knife or drain all the blood out of your body by character assassination yeah they'll kill you by character assassination they'll talk about you or put you down or put you in a position where others will look down on you the word people won't have respect for you or listen to you or or even give you voice anymore right my mind and if they do is to doubtful disputations oh i've got to be friendly to them i have got to say hello what kind of christian would i be if i didn't say hello to them oh that's all fine and danny but that's doubtful disputations friend that's not the way a christian does it a christian from their heart loves to see another christian yeah loves to be able to fellowship with another christian you know when you talk to somebody and they would just rather be off somewhere else watching a pig race or something they'd rather be doing whatever else they don't care just as long as they're not trying to listen to you talk to you or is exhausting it is it is to be friendly to you it's character assassination they fit you with the tongue they tie that that fiery weapon that kills people so many times that destroys people's reputations that destroys people's standing among others whatever the and actions sometimes it's not even a tongue it's an action if someone of an authority shuns another one what do you think the people that look up to that person going to think about that person yeah they're going to shun too they're not going to think anything of those people if the person they're looking up to for leadership does it what do you think they're going to do to them same thing but paul but gamalia said watch it you do that you might find yourself fighting against god oh amen how many people are fighting against god today don't even know it fighting against the very god they claim to be serving living for right amen it's it's it's sad it's a shame what did what did just tell paul song jesus told saul it is hard for you to kick against the pricks it is hard for you to live this life it is hard for you to keep i know you got letters in your pocket to damascus to put this that christian church out of business i know that but it's hard for you to keep doing this it's hard for you to keep kicking against that it's hard for you to keep coming against the work that i'm sanctioned i said stop it lord what must i do you've got to become one of them amen you've got to become one of them so take those decrees tear them off throw them in the garbage and go down and worship with those people amen give a genuine love give a genuine uh handshake welcome amen go give them your love your encouragement go tell them go show them that you're with them not against them all right amen and throw that decree away that's not that's i'm obviously dramatizing that's what will happen god jesus struck saul down blind and ananias had to come pray for him but you understand what i'm saying what am i supposed to do go help those people go pray for those people give to those people whatever you've got whatever you can do whatever it is that's in your quiver that you can uh that you can supply give to them help them impart some wisdom impart some knowledge impart anything that's going to enhance their lives and be positive we do it as unto the lord what would you do if it was jesus right amen it's like i said before what would you do if that was jesus house what would you do if that was jesus's car would you what would you do if that was jesus's money what would you do if that was jesus church how would you treat it amen amen how would you treat how would you work on your job if you knew what you were doing you were doing for god god came down and said okay i want you to do this for me whatever it is that's your job how would you do it oh god i don't know i really you know what are you are you really a christian then because it's it it kind of becomes suspect at that point if you don't really want to work for god if you don't really care then you're just living unto yourself you live unto yourself you're going to die unto yourself what would you do if jesus was asking you to do it how would you treat it how would you cook your next meal if you knew that meal was that was for jesus to eat literally in a corporal body he was gonna consume that meal how would you cook it amen how would how would i fix that electric here if i knew that that was his house if this was going to be a representation of him how would i do it see that's a sad thing sometimes saints i've heard so many times the phrase and they call themselves christians because of the way they act the way they do because of the way they treat them because of the half way that they do a job now i understand that that christians are if you tell people you're a christian especially if you tell people you're a minister although i i understand the minister's supposed to be blameless but aren't we all i believe every one of us are supposed to be blameless godly christians but when people i know and i know people stare and look and and sometimes just wait for you to slip up right yeah exactly well don't give them the opportunity don't don't give them the chance don't slip up that's the best thing to do but i've heard so many times something that was done wrong and and just just halfway not not a mistake i mean well i'll make mistakes i'm not talking about that i'm not talking about a little mistake that was done or something but but something was just done halfway and you know there was no effort put into it and people look and say oh and they call themselves a christian i've heard that so many times i i hope it's never been said about me probably has been i don't know don't know if it was or not i hope it wasn't but how many times have you heard people say oh and they call themselves a christian well don't give them the opportunity don't give anybody the chance to say that about you because you do it as unto god amen that's i'm doing that to you lord amen i'm not i'm not doing this for my boss i'm not doing that for this job i'm not doing this to earn money all that is all true i'm waking up this morning for you what do you want me to do today i'm living this day for you god what do you do everything i that's just i you you think that brother you you're just radical that's just over the top maybe but that's how i believe it that's how i live my life and i believe that's how all of us should do amen amen we should all live our lives with that attitude with that feeling because jesus is the all-seeing eye and everything we do he is watching amen he is watching amen he gives us specific instructions i'll close here in just a few minutes but in ephesians chapter five i'll read a couple more scriptures as i close here ephesians 5 verse 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god how in the fear of god amen as a representative of jesus christ what would a representative of jesus christ be how would they act how would they talk how would they present themselves how would a representative because a representative of jesus is only supposed to be an extension of him right in other words you're supposed to be jesus in flesh right you're supposed to be representing him in every way exactly who he is amen submitting yourselves one another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord amen every meal every speck of dust you vacuum up every piece of clothes you put in the laundry you do is unto the lord pray amen because as you submit yourselves unto your own husbands you do it as how as unto the lord amen the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and is the savior of the body therefore as the church's subject unto christ so let the wise be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives well that trumps everything i just read people say ah see i told you wives you're supposed to submit time to the husband wife you've got to submit to me well i know that's what the bible says but now what does it say about the husband husband love your wife that love is the love of god how did christ love his church love his bride he didn't beat her around and treat her like a maid he treated her like his queen he treats us like his queen like his like his uh uh extension of him love that love compelled him to go to calvary for her that's right amen so when husbands are up saying you gotta submit to me you better watch what the rest of that says you better love that wife if you don't you're gonna be held accountable to god yes amen amen as unto the lord praise the lord husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that it should be holy and without blemish that's his bride all right that is me and you sought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself amen so as you treat your wife you treating yourself amen for nothing ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh of his bone for this call shall man leave his father and mother shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ in the church nevertheless that every one of you in particular so loved his wife even as himself and the wife see that she referenced her husband there's where you get the mutual respect amen that's where you get as unto the lord because he said here he's speaking of the mystery of christ and the and his bride the church but it's also that level of of between people and we don't just treat other christians that way we treat everybody that way we should treat everybody as as we would treat god what if remember saint martin saint martin was uh was going down the street and i guess the lord compelled him because the bomb was freezing the man was freezing and saint martin i guess was compelled of the lord he he took his military coat he ripped it in half and he gave that bomb half of his coat so he could try to stay a little bit warm and not freeze to death that night military people were making fun of him laughing i believe it was in the military laughing at him making fun of him saying you look silly in that half a coat what did you do with the other hatching coat you ripped and gave it to a bomb why'd you do that for making him feel like a fool saint martin excuse that that's true scriptural but saint martin that night was asleep and god jesus came to him in that in a dream or or i don't a dream or not a dream but jesus came to him that night and saint martin looked and jesus was standing there wrapped in that half a coat right amen because he did it as unto the lord amen and that's the way we we all should approach life approach one another approach our families approach our jobs approach everything that we do everything that we do we do it for the lord as unto him as unto him one more scripture in colossians colossians chapter three uh verse 17 colossians 3 17 and whatsoever you do in word or indeed or word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father find him all that we do word or indeed all didn't say some but didn't say the things you considered important didn't say just in church didn't say just in front of your friends or your church members it said all that you do everything we do we do inward or deep we do in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him why submit yourselves unto your own husbands as fit in the lord husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord amen children obey your parents in all things this is well pleasing unto the lord yes i wish i had obeyed that me too amen i wished i had obeyed that i didn't have a grasp on it at that time but i wish i had anyway i'd probably made my parents lives a little easier but i'm thankful that god shows us this to help us understand this is what is pleasing to the lord this is how we please god this is what we do be pleasing to the lord is live every moment all the word all indeed to ourselves to one another where we do it as unto the lord whatever we do in word warranty we do in the name of the lord jesus amen submitting ourselves to one another praise them so the next time that you feel that spirit come on you think well i'm you know man if i have to do one more load of laundry i'm gonna go crazy if i gotta i feel that way sometimes when brother roger tells me there's another ditch ahead i gotta do one more ditch i'm done or or whatever it is we all have our own ditches amen right i'm done uh i'll i'm just i'm not gonna do this i've you know i'll slack off and let so and so dig the the bulk of the ditch would jesus have done that amen praise the lord well he's a better ditch digger than i am well everybody's probably a better ditch digger than i am i haven't had a whole lot of practice but that doesn't negate my responsibility you know i'm just yourself from this example friend every one of us have those situations in life every one of us have those obstacles every one of those every one of us faces those things all the time every day if you breathe the breath of life today if you breathe it tomorrow it'll present itself again it'll show itself real again tomorrow just like you did today and we'll do it again as unto the lord amen glad you asked me to do this approach it with that god you asked me to do this god you wanted me to do this god this is i'm doing this for you amen amen praise the lord so then whatever whatever we get then we give to the lord because we did it for him there's a scripture in exodus i believe it is i usually use that scripture when i preach on tithes and offers but that that scripture says my my strength has gotten me this this wealth your strength you wouldn't have a strength in your body if god didn't give it to you my strength in my back my intelligence you wouldn't have a brain if god didn't give it to you that's right you wouldn't have anything if god give it to you so everything i've got belongs to him amen because i wouldn't have any of it if it wasn't for him praise the lord so i'd do it for him amen let's stand if we could tonight amen pray the lord is well pleased with what we do amen pray the lord is the ones represented in what we do amen sometimes we do things for strangers sometimes we take time out of our day to help somebody we've never met in our entire life but god honors it amen god blesses it you get down the road and you saw and and sometimes you you know you obey the lord and you get down the road and you you got something in your mind you think oh this you just something weighs on you it's going to be tough hard difficult you get there and it's just a breeze yes you think oh man that was just a breeze that wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be why why wasn't as bad as you thought it was going to be maybe god was there helping you because you helped somebody else right maybe god was letting you get through this a lot easier because you helped that person you made their lives easier and you did it with the joy of your heart right you did it because you wanted to you gave of yourself you did it is unto the lord and what does the lord do he repays you oh my that was that was the easier i thought oh praise the lord but we don't know could have been just because what you did over here amen look friend god knows god doesn't forget amen god keeps track he's the all-seeing eye amen amen praise the lord amen i love him don't you amen praise the lord jesus amen thank you jesus

then tell me so build this church on amen yes sir praise god what do you still got help praise god amen i might have a little hope there god yeah true yeah brother brahma called all the disciples
