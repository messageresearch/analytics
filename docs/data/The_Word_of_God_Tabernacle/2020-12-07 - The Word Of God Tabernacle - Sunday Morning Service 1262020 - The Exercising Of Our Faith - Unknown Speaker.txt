this morning god reminded me to he's already told us what his will is amen and and that i just needed to um you know cut through the fog of my and reminded me he wants me to be in church this morning amen and he reminded me that he can do anything i've had him see i've seen him cut the time off the clock like miraculously and uh and while traveling on my on my little car and and this morning was another one of those days and i just said lord i declare what you've already said amen i prophesy i shall be in church this morning and i will be there early 11 15 from college i had to go up there and pick up my good stuff and then come back and i had to have a conversation with the family my and well praise the lord wonderful that's great i left around um it was maybe 8 30 between 8 30 and 9. amen that testimony goes perfect with what i want to talk about today thank you for that amen anyone else song or testimony yes i just want to thank the lord because jennifer came down sick with

just want to thank the lord amen and my son and his girlfriend started going to church on ubc but i told him you go over the lord you amen amen and then he himself admitted i already know the difference mom but manna wants me to go with him yeah to church so i said son you do what the lord needs you to do yeah and you said you said to yourself you know he knows the difference right amen praise the lord wonderful thank you that's our son nathan anyone else amen sorry song if there's time of course this game popped in my head when i saw the list daddy sent me it's one of my favorites to sing it's been requested by people here before so feel free to sing along uh he touched me hey man all right i was shackled by a heavy burden beneath the load of guilt and shame then the hand of jesus touched me hallelujah amen i am no longer the same [Music] because he touched me yes [Music] and know the joy that floods my soul you know something [Music] amen and since i met my blessed yes and since [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] is me [Music] and know the joy that floods happened and now i know he touched me it's because he touched [Music] something wonderful happened and now i

by the mighty hand of god there's nothing else like it friend you know that amen you know that there's nothing else like it but from a touch from the hand of god amen praise the lord i pray we have been touched so far this morning and looking forward to a further touch of the lord as he'd speak to us today amen so let's if we could stand to our feet amen we'll go to the word of god now open your bibles to hebrews chapter 11. first uh first new testament scripture we start out with in a couple months or so i guess but and then we'll just read a couple of verses of scripture okay hebrews chapter 11 we'll begin with verse one amen felt my heart is just something actually for the past couple of weeks that the lord wanted to speak on faith so i just uh trust to be a blessing amen before we read the word let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer precious jesus again lord we come to you thanking you so much for all that you've done for us and lord given to us in this beautiful day and lord your word father we open the pages of our bibles lord and god trusting that you're going to speak to us from it now god we know that you would anoint the speaker the hearer like god that whatever you would have purposed and intended lord for this service today god and for your people for those who are here for those who may be watching lord that it would be accomplished in us god as you send it forth for we know it'll not return void god but we're trusting you god that it would do what you said and believe by faith god that that's exactly what you show to us and help us for this last day lord we're getting to a place as you know god as we know here lord of that statue of a perfect man the foundation is faith we're getting to a place lord that that faith has become more and more real to us it has to become more and more of a revelation jesus lord in this last day because we're coming to a place of of a body change we're coming to a place of a unity of faith a faith that's going to need to reach a place lord a plateau that we've probably never reached in this mortal realm before god but lord i'm just believing father that you god as you speak to us your word that word comes into our hearts it comes into our spirit into our lives it becomes a part of us lord and god when we're walking around on our daily journey you just open it to us lord how many times god in our daily journey you can reflect to us and we look and see god how that word comes instrumental in our lives as we speak it to someone else or it becomes real to us in a traumatic situation or we try to help somebody or speak to somebody or witness in some way lord that word just becomes so real to us and that faith becomes so powerful to us lord it just helps us understand that that faith does come by hearing and hearing the word of god whether we realize it right now or not we know god that that's exactly i believe exactly what you're doing for us this bride in this last day through the revealed word of the hours bringing her to that place bringing her to that time lord that that word lord that has been spoken that word by faith that comes into us that word is what brings about that faith to bring what is needed for this last day yes we thank you god when all tongues have ceased when all gifts are over when everything is all said and done your word stands true yes your word is real your word will not pass away we thank you god for it we pray lord that you would reveal it even now and help encourage us lord by what you would speak to us today lord you just help your unworthy servant here lord each one of us god we're we're so in ourselves unworthy but trusting you in all things we can do all things through christ which strengthens us today bless it lord now bless this service we commit it to you and ask your uh blessings on it again in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen amen hebrews 11 we'll just read the first couple of verses now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made by things which do appear you could be seated if you'd like we've read that scripture many times we've expounded on it many times you've read it you've heard it you've probably heard many other ministers people expound on it and preach on it but it's really one of the best places if you want to talk about faith to begin so faith and and this first three verses is sometimes a little complicated or a little challenging to understand when you get into the double negatives and you get into the uh the uh all the adjectives that's added into it uh it can it can get to the places uh for example through faith we understand the world's refrained by the word of god that the things which are which are seen were not were not made by things which do appear that's not normally how we talk in our english language uh so it it takes one thing and goes around and brings it back to to the negative to show that it's a positive uh which is kind of unusual but you know if you go take the negative battery off your cable your car won't start so there's there's that negative that brings the charge to the positive so yeah but anyway is the challenge of that but i just want to talk about today the exercising of our faith if you will the exercising of our faith faith isn't common uh faith isn't just something like i was talking about in the memorial service yesterday about love love is not just something that's a word love is not just something that you tell somebody love is just not something that's written down a piece of paper sung in a song love is something that's expressed if it's real love if it's true love if it's the love of god it's something that's expressed it's something that's given out is something that's shown it's an action and we know that the loves that god has in the bible the agapo and agape one is a noun and one is a verb well the agapeo love is something that's a verb it's an action it's something you do it's something you perform it's something that you show somebody not just by words faith is the same way faith isn't something that you just say faith isn't something that you say well i got faith or it's not something you just sing about and and all those things are fine and and pronouncing your faith is good but there's got to be something behind your faith to show that the faith is really there amen if there's not something to follow the faith to prove that the faith is real then you can say it all day long but the manifestation of your faith is not evident in people's lives in our lives for for everyone and anyone to see it's got to be something that's an action there's got to be something that you do and it's not something that you just like i said earlier in the service and you just sit down and say okay god hit me you know hit me with a good dose of faith don't it you know that's good to have the faith because every man's dealt demands your faith but you got to get up off the couch and do something about it you got to put action to your faith you got to put emotion you got to put something behind your faith so that your faith works right uh there's many stories that you read through the message that that people didn't understand faith and i think a lot of times people even probably myself don't completely understand faith but it comes a time where the faith that you claim to have needs to be exercised it needs to be put forth there needs to be muscle behind it there needs to be evidence behind it you know the bible says we'll probably read this in a few minutes but uh faith without works is dead right jesus said you've got faith all along but i say well uh you know i got faith by my works well you know my works prove my faith well which is it gonna be well it's one and the same it's synonymous you've got faith and the faith is gonna follow you jesus said the works that i do shall you do amen well look through the bible we all know the works that jesus did right well if jesus said all the works that he did the works that we'll do well then what does that put us very much see not but but again we've got to understand and not let our faith get weak by the thing to sink well something's powerfully supernatural has to happen every minute of my life where i'm not a christian you know i've known people like that i i knew a brother back in north carolina has passed away now but he actually proclaimed to me my our pastor he said you know if i get into service and i don't speak in tongues i don't feel like i'm saved when we're trying to say brother are you really that's that that's the least of the gifts even according to the bible according to paul that even is even the least of the gifts but yeah he was so in that and of course you know the pentecostal thought of it and then and that and then he's like well you know i if i don't speak in tongues i don't feel like i've been to church or i don't feel like i'm saved it's not something that you look and say well there's got to be a supernatural happening every minute of your life right because most of our lives just like abraham if you compile you think of how supernatural abraham's life looks most people do look at abraham and think by faith and abraham live the supernatural life god told him here god told him here god told him here but a lot of what abraham did most of what abraham did 95 plus percent of what abraham did was by faith right it wasn't by something that god said okay take a step over here okay now take a step over here and thus said the lord you got to take a step over here no it wasn't that it was by faith right he walked by faith god said okay leave your father leave your home and i'm gonna show you a land that's it let's go okay now it's your turn to go do it right and it's your turn to put feet feet print upon the faith and go do what god told you to do and it's time to leave your father now it's time to now god didn't say okay all this along the way you know it's been told i don't know how accurate it is because i haven't done it myself but it's been told that they that people have compiled the total amount of time scripturally documented that god spoke lift to ear to abraham guess how much time well guess probably not the thing to do in church but i'm going to tell you that that is that they say was compiled that god actually spoke to abraham comes to about 12 minutes 12 minutes i've been standing here talking to you for more than 12 minutes i mean just since opening the bible for 12 minutes right 12 minutes they say now again i don't know how accurate that is but people have taken and and i guess they timed the things that god talked to abraham 12 minutes you imagine 12 minutes in your life you think some people want god to talk to him every second of every day that's right some people think brother branham knew everything to do about every situation every time and every coming event well your deity at that point brother man wasn't dead he was a man he was subject to the things that god showed him and helped him with i don't know if anybody's ever compiled through documentation how i mean how much time that adds up to but 12 minutes to abraham and most people think well god told abraham everything no he didn't abraham just put shoe leather behind his behind his face amen god just abraham just moved out when god told him to do something he exercised it you do what god said do and you move on now what if you don't get a direct say say something from god to say okay leave your father mother go into a land which i show you and and and then go do that what if god doesn't do that then then what do we have left we have his word right we have his word to walk by we have his word to live by we have his word that gives us the beautiful precious promises that we have today so when god says by my stripes you're healed can you not walk in that right step into that and believe yes how many times as brother branham said on tape i know you've all heard it but how many times he said now get up off that cot right now get up out of that wheelchair stand to your feet do something about it the prayer of faith has gone forth you say you got faith now stand on your feet and prove it show to everybody don't just lay there and rot get up on your feet and move do something right let let god let the world let yourself know that you really truly believe what you say you're you believe amen that you really have the faith that you say that you believe this is uh one of them i'll read to you uh brother and it's uh in the prophet visit south africa and he says i recall during the message as i was sitting on the platform watching the people and their reaction to the message of faith being brought to them i noticed one lady was sitting about 30 40 feet in front of the platform she was looking at her hands you could see the large knuckles now think about this especially if you've had any issue with arthritis he said you could see uh by her large knuckles and the apparent stiffness of the fingers that she was suffering from arthritis she was unable to move her fingers but as she had heard the word of god expounded her faith had grown and she looked down at those crippled fingers and she tried to move them hmm amen have you ever been in prayer to the lord and you ask god to touch in a certain way or you have an ailment back shoulder arm whatever and you say and you're you're in in prayer you get up from prayer and and you say praise the lord amen and you do something you stand up praise the lord i'm healed right yeah and you and you act upon it praise god it's not hurting me praise god it's not sore anymore praise the lord i'm healed amen amen stand on it she's brother graham said she tried to move those little fingers at first there was practically no movement at first and the at first is the worst thing yes the at first part is the worst thing because people start dwelling on the at first right and they forget about the later and the promise and the healing that is there to come very much and they get so fixated on the app first and then oh it hurts oh i can't do it but at first they barely moved them crippled fingers she tried to move practically no movement at all she continued to exercise her faith and she did it because uh and she did it became evident that she was able to move them more than she had before her fingers started moving that arthritis started leaving her face started kicking in yeah and and and the results came after a few more minutes she opened and closed her hands with perfect ease a smile came over her face and face and she realized she was then free from the crippled condition that had caused by the arthritis amen amen praise the lord sister norman was giving us a testimony a couple weeks ago how uh we just had a real powerful service and the spirit of god moved through the place and she had this thing on her hand and going home she looked and the thing was gone great notice that god had healed us completely gone yes amen see that's the kind of god we serve well that's the scriptural god see because the scripture of god says in psalms 107 uh we'll just begin with verse 18 psalms 107 18 their soul abhoreth all matter of me they draw near into the gates of death then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses he sent his word amen he sent his word now we're talking yeah and healed them and delivered them from their destructions what did it the word amen what was that scriptural evident in this story as he was preaching the word of faith she was sitting there and faith began to take hold into her life and as the faith took hold now it just didn't a lot of times people say damn there it is sometimes it's like a gradual thing your face starts building it starts getting to a place that you start thinking well yeah you know that is right god is real am i he did promise me and and before you know it you're just you're opening closing your hands with ease right as as the story goes well that's what it says the bible says he sent his word and his word healed them brother random had how many people come through prayer lines in his ministry thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions i don't know probably close to a million at least hundreds of thousands i would imagine and all the prayer lines he had but the bible says the word went forth and healed them right nothing wrong with the prayer line we had people come up last week a couple people we prayed for them i felt led to have uh people who wanted to get prayed for come and have lay hands later on that's scriptural too right but we know that the bible says that the word went forth and healed them the word went forth we know there's gifts of healing that's fine but the bible also says the word went forth and healed them and and delivered them from their destructions didn't just healed he delivered praise the lord oh oh 21st verse all that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men amen praise the lord oh that men would i imagine that girl that lady probably had a jubilee after she saw her hands go open and then closing like this amen she probably maybe just in her heart we don't know uh he doesn't say or she jumped up and down but i imagine at least in her heart she got a jubilee and thank you praise the lord the knuckles straight down the hands are moving and every minute and it's all gone by the grace of god but the point was she exercised it right she didn't just sit there and say oh well praise the lord it's a good message and you know come to church and enjoy it and hear the man of god and he preaches and talks to us and reads to us out of the bible and all such no she took it personally she took it personally to the point that she put action behind it and she exercised it brother adam even said that she exercised her faith and she began to work on those hands i'm sure they probably heard there's some of you i think in gears had arthritis uh i've heard of people i know and a lot of people in my life have had arthritis and sister karen zinka and different ones my mom had bigger knuckles her arthritis wasn't that bad but anyway i've known a lot of people and it's painful and sometimes it hurts just to move that joint i mean it's painful but um and i imagine she it was probably painful but as she began to work it and the word began and a word continued to be preached and the faith began to continue to grow and her faith and she began to exercise and let the exercising of her faith show that there was a work behind what she said in faith and believe then then god healed it god took and healed it because she did something she didn't just sit there and let it and just let it evolve she did something about it amen she did something about it we talked about abraham last week and we went into genesis and the things that was talked about with abraham and and you know you read the bible you see abraham when god told him about isaac abraham laughed when god told him with sarah in the tent sarah laughed they both laughed 190 years 100 abraham was 100 she was 90 and they both laughed but the bible in romans doesn't tell you that right so when god comes and explains it to a man of god saul paul to write it in the bible in the new testament it doesn't talk about that it talks a whole different story let's read a little bit of it romans chapter 4 romans chapter 4 verse 17 it says as i have as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and call it those things which be not as though they were things that be not as though they were right just like the opening scripture hebrews 11 amen faith is a substance well what is that substance is the thing is the substance of things hoped for it's an evidence of things not seen now i i can tell you i have a water bottle on this pulpit and and if it was different you couldn't see it you'd have to take my word for it but you might still doubt that there was actually a water bottle here but when you saw it you said okay there's the evidence the evidence proves that what i said was right well what's the evidence that we're looking for when we talk about having an exercising of our faith we're looking for the manifestation of the spirit of god to move in our lives we talk about physical healing all the time but it's not not just physical healing right it's spiritual and financial and emotional and for our families and for our loved ones and there there's so many things that god you know you know you don't have to believe god for just one thing at a time right amen right um i honestly it was a time in my life i kind of was like that unconsciously i would just pray for like one thing at a time and one time i was praying and i thought well i have more wrong to me wrong more wrong than just that right i just ask god he's a multi-tasker he can do it all at one time if he wants right he can hear it all at one time he can ingest it he's gone i don't just have to tell him there's certain people i know that if you tell them more than one thing the one thing that you said first is going to get done the thing that you said second they didn't even hear right i just know people like that that's just the way it is i'll probably like that sometimes that you you might say two or three different things one or two things get heard one thing gets left off god's not like that he's a multitasker he can take it all yeah amen he can take it all from all of us at one time he he can do it all so there's much more than just physical healing that we're talking about but the exercising of that faith is what's the key here is what we're talking about we needed evidence our faith if it's true faith our faith will bring an evidence it'll bring proof amen amen it'll bring proof now 18th verse who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall i see be now look at the scripture again it says he who against hope now that's the other thing that a lot of people have trouble with they have a problem i spoke on this a little bit yesterday going beyond the vision of our see tasteful smell here going beyond just the tangible what we see here what we have in this natural normal nominal life going beyond that and seeing beyond the the realms of this natural reach to where god is to where faith exists to our healings brought down or whatever it is to our lives right against hope you look and say well there's no hope of that happening well that's true man there isn't if you're going to take that attitude if you're gonna say that and believe that yeah there is no hope i used to have people come into my job in charlotte and they would say uh and i'd have a little sniffles or something they say you gotta call us and nope say oh you know you got it i hear the sentences i said no i said no that's just a lying devil that's not true that's not real what you hear and see now is not real that's a lie the devil right right amen and then i would go into someone else's office a different time or something and they'd have a little something they'd say oh i'm so sick i said yes you are no you're mad look at me why would you say that i said well you just confessed it you just told me you were you just told the whole world the devil everybody else you're sick so you're right that's right you're gonna see are you gonna be sick you're gonna stay sick until you have faith to believe that that you're healed yeah you're gonna be sick so your testimony has a lot to do with the exercising of that faith we can't it's so easy today now i think now pardon me a minute if you disagree with me i think that a lot of what's going on here is a test of our faith amen of a real believer true believers faith i really do i think it's a real test of our faith and i'm not saying because you do or don't wear a mask i'm not saying because you have or haven't come to church i'm not talking about that i'm just talking about the faith of believing what god is doing for his people today because there's gonna be this word that comes into a bride's heart as it's spoken by a minister as the word of god or brother branham or however it's spoken by the pure word of god not a man's ideal opinion but the pure word of god is going to bring forth faith to a people's lives it has to amen it absolutely has to now no matter whether you can feel it or think it friend when you if you're a child of god that faith is there that word has come it's going to produce itself it has to and it's getting to the place that right now we've lived in a country of plenty we've lived in a country where we have everything we don't need anything i don't know of anybody unless sometimes they get in trouble or by choice don't have food to eat or clothes on their back or a roof over their head most people do and if they don't a lot of times it's their fault right not always but a lot of times i i know people i used to drive uber lyft i know people uh get in the car and they tell me their friends are are homeless 19 years old i said why perfectly healthy well strong they choose to be that's right he wanted to be sometimes they make even more money standing on the corner than you and i do slaving away every day i think how but that's just the way it is but normally most of us have food we have clothes we have a house we have we have a good life we have insurance you have doctors medicine some of the best advancements of technology and science and medicine the world has ever known uh since the andalumian world uh because we know they were far beyond that to where we are today but we're getting to that point again now so much so that there's people like elon musk talk about putting things in people's heads and turning it into a robot they're they're wanting to change people's uh thought process and things in their brain so that they don't do things wrong or never make a mistake or anything i mean just basically turn you into a robot right artificial intelligence taking over the country point is we've had it good we've had it easy friend but we can't let our faith grow weak it's so easy for it to grow weak when you don't use it right when you don't have to use it when you don't feel like there's any uh something that you say well i i'm getting a headache i go to the medicine cabinet uh i i i broke my leg i go to the doctor or stitch or uh whatever it is i go to my bank account i got some money i got a job whatever god takes care we got cars we can get here to there faster than anybody's ever done it uh airplanes and whatever we just haven't had to use our faith so much right right i don't know unless you just haven't told me that there's anybody in this room and probably streaming now that's ever set down at your dinner table with absolutely not a speck of food in your house right there's people i know have done that heard stories about it but when you're hungry what do you do if you don't go to the the local restaurant or something you go into your cupboard and you got food i know i'm embarrassed sometimes to tell this about me and my wife and we'll sit there and say what do you want to have for dinner why we don't have hardly much heat here and you go look in the cupboards they're full you go look in the freezer full you go look in the fridge full and we're talking to each other well there's not much here to eat right you know what these people come from third world countries they'll probably smack us in the face there's more food in there that feeds my family in a month right but we've got it so easy right we got it so comfortable i think maybe it is oh this covet maybe even isn't pulling out of the of the of the padding out of the nest so we get down to get a sticker say lord i i want to trust you my faith to be in you again our faith try to keep our faith from letting it grow weak exercising exercise our faith every day every day we should exercise it i'm not i'm not saying you're expecting necessarily something supernatural of the heavens to open every day but something in your life to to spark that faith i mean if it's just in prayer if it's just in reading your bible or listening to a message or something a a tape then something that just sparks that faith don't let it grow amen because abraham believed against hope against hope and the only way you can believe against hope is to forget everything that you see hear every technology everything that tells you everything that says it's this but it's not god it's this you have to go against all of that and say no it's not you ever heard the story that was told i believe it's a true story if i remember that these uh these people and i believe it was uh yeah it was it was uh i can't remember if it was on tape but it was it was involving brother branham and this uh child i can't remember trying to think it was a son or daughter i can't remember a child that had an accident and she was laying uh in the hospital and the parents were grieved and they wanted brother branham to come pray for her and the doctors are saying there's no hope you know she's going to be going anytime you know there's no way she can live there's no way she can survive and her vitals kept going down and down and down the machines kept giving a bleak picture the machines that she was tied to kept making it look like she was going and going and going and going you know and and all hope was gone right so when when brother branham came in and prayed for her the parents started getting happy they started celebrating and praising the lord and the doctor comes into the nurse and says what are you all so happy about don't y'all see those machines don't you see the condition of your i'll just say daughter don't you see the condition of your daughter don't you see what's happening here she is dying she is going and there's nothing else we can do about it praise the lord because that's when god works the best yes because when there's nothing else you can do about it is when god works the best and they said oh you precious nurse we appreciate all that you've done for us we appreciate the care that you've given to our daughter and all that you've done to help her say but ma'am you're trained to look at those instruments and to read those instruments and to follow your medicine to follow your training that's that's what you're trained in that's what you're supposed to do he said but we're trained to believe god and a prophet of god has come and prayed for our daughter and we know against hope she's going to be well right am i we know she's going to be well and of course i don't have to tell you the rest of the story amen her vitals started coming up but see they exodus even after brother branham prayed for her you understand the story and why i said it even after brother and prayed for the vitals kept going down right she kept getting worse after he prayed for her but their faith went from zero to a hundred percent am i because they believed right they believed now that was brother brown it doesn't have to be brother branham right now because it's just the faith here's if it's still faith it's the same faith it takes faith to move them out and it takes faith to believe god it takes faith from anybody simple faith it doesn't have to be a faith that that you say i'm going to pull the moon down and wrap a bow around it tonight no it just says just simple faith just simple faith to i just believed god against hope against hope those parents believed against hope everything told them contrary everything told abraham contrary his own body was speaking to him her own body was speaking to her and said you cannot do this right right this is not biologically possible right but god says i made biology america right amen i made your body i made the components of your body and they're going to be to the position and the place by body chains that you're going to conceive and bring forth the promised son amen amen amen praise the lord in the case of hell cannot prevail against him right that's right hallelujah against hope he believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which uh which was spoken so shall thy seed be being not weak in faith even though he laughed right we see in genesis he laughed but god's account he didn't hear that amen god doesn't count that day i'm not saying god didn't hear him god right he just didn't account it yes sir right right being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also able uh able also to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also it's for us it's for right here december 6 2020 with the swirling vertex of covet going around this world it is for you it is for us it is for you today to exercise that faith and believe this pertains to me as well as it did for abraham this pertains to me as well as it did for brother branham this pertains to me as well as it does anybody ever lived right because i'm a part of him amen i'm a part of this promise yes by faith i'm the facing not necessarily the blood lineage but the facie through jesus christ i'm a part of that i'm a part of it and the gates of hell cannot prevail against you or i anyone that believes because it was for us too it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead and who if you believe i believe am i i believe today amen you believe amen i believe yes i believe in by faith i believe and by faith and works in my life that i believe yes now god moves in mysterious ways we don't always understand it right and sometimes we not we might not always recognize it in the capacity as god is bringing it but the thing of it is god does it right god brings it to pass now i've said this before but when when you when you go in prayer and you know we have prayer requests today or you pray in your own special place it's your own time whenever you pray or talk communion with the lord and you ask god or you commune with god or you you petition god on somebody else's behalf or a healing for someone or salvation for a family member or something you know we always have in our minds but this you know that that this is the way god's gonna do it you know there's always that preconceived notion you know this is how god's gonna do it this is the way god is going to deliver this is where god is going to help this is where god's going to heal and you know sometimes we get so fixated just like they did with the messiah coming they had gotten so fixated on exactly how the messiah was supposed to come that when he did come they completely missed him right right and then when he became to came to uh expose himself to them of course their eyes were blinded they couldn't see but they missed him all together who expected their savior and deliverer to come and be born on the on a manure pile right who i know nobody would have conceived that but that was god's way of doing it right and see whatever god's way of doing it is the way that we want it to be done because however god chooses to do it when that's another thing we have a problem right right when god chooses to do it now don't but now don't let wind confuse your lack of faith okay now don't let don't let our lack of faith be confused with when now when is appropriate because god is going to be in his time but don't just say well when because you don't have enough faith to believe right if you don't have enough faith to believe then own up to it and say i just you know brother sister my faith just hasn't reached the place that i could just receive that yet right and just be honest don't say well god it's not in his time yet or something it might not be you understand what i'm saying don't confuse the two of those don't confuse your faith in your wisdom right some people they may not have faith and they said well i'm just uh i'm just using wisdom and that's fine because there's a place for that there's a place for faith there's a place for wisdom there's a place that you follow the leading of the lord in your life and that's the most important thing amen follow the leading of the lord your life but don't confuse the two don't confuse the two don't let one denigrate the other put the other down amen if the face is there let that work work that faith right amen let it work that faith and your faith then becomes evident because people see right amen it's craziness to the world but to a christian to a believer it's it it's the gospel it's a way of life right it's truth to them it was truth to abraham god said go abraham went 12 minutes i still can't get over that 12 minutes he spoke to abraham but all that abraham did all the things that happened in his life it was about faith he did it by faith the things brother branham did and i used him as examples because you know the scriptural example and of course our most recent example of probably the one that lived the closest to jesus but look friend those examples we look to i can tell you and if each one of us got up and testified you could come up with you would have something in your life that's just as powerful just as supernatural it might not have happened on that white of scale but it's not supposed to open on that widest scale we didn't have the ministry brother branham had right we didn't have the colleague brother bradham had but i can absolutely document to you miracles that have happened in our lives yes amen that boy right there fell 20 feet out 20 foot out of a tree on his bright and didn't hardly get a scratch and he will testify to you when he was eight mama an angel caught me you're mad got out there no more in five seconds being there an angel caught me i felt an arm grab me here and here and lay me down on the ground who does that sounds some the world would have had the boy committed thought he was insane well you're crazy to believe such no it's not crazy it's just a way of life amen it's just who we are that's just one thing i come up with with him sitting there in my remembrance but how many of you can do the same thing right now you could each one of you could probably i'm sure do the same thing because that one thing comes to your mind my wife's got a brand new muscle in her foot had it for 20 plus years yes 30 over 30 years brand new muscle that's what the doctor said right the doctor said she's got a new muscle hmm praise the lord well that's one time i'm gonna believe the doctor doctor says she got a new muscle well praise the lord she got a new muscle but i got more than the doctor to back that up that's why i believe that right but you could do the exact same thing now god didn't have to come down and and and hurricanes and tornadoes and whirling vortexes fire and brimstone no it's it's just living a godly christian life by exercising every day our faith you know some people believe that they have a hard time with their children and they bring them to church and you know especially nowadays you know children uh i'm thankful tabatha and zach bring their children and and art and sharia bring their children but some people you know i've had people tell me all my children just can't they can't take it they can't sit still i said well how do you think they're ever going to learn right if you don't put them in the situation right how are they going to ever learn if you don't bring them and put them in the places going to exercise that to train them the way they're supposed to be they never will learn that's right i had people at my job in charlotte they told me i'm not taking my kids out to any public place until they're 15 or whatever it was i thought i said that's not training your children right if you didn't want your children why did you have them right if you don't want them now i'm not i'm not for abortion uh if you don't want children don't do what it takes to get children right that's the easiest way not to have children don't perform the act that causes children to come forth that's the best thing but they said i'm not going to get my children out anywhere and that kid come to work one day and i got a real glimpse of what she was talking about that kid was everywhere but they have to be trained right and i'm thankful that they train them so when you train them my point in saying this is when you train them it brings us to a place in life where when that training will kick in right right and i and that's what exactly what god's doing for us exactly what god's doing to us this is all our life experiences all training it's all that god does i can look back on things in our lives friend as i know you could and not understand it one bit now more than i did then say god why did this happen right why did you allow this to happen why did this go on why did this happen this way god is training you god is molding you god is making you now some things happen or just our fault we just did something that we shouldn't have done or said something we shouldn't have done or whatever the circumstances but a lot of our lives if you're a christian if you're a believer you're one of god's it's training god's leading us and bringing you this to this place for a purpose for a reason it's just like training the children well now when when when alice and gabriel and t and and joel and emma get into church they're generally pretty good children when they first started coming you were there not so much disruptive around but see that's they got trained right and they know now we're in church right you act this way when we're in church this is what you do amen amen this you listen and then when they get older then they start listening and and that's that's the training the same thing happens to us as children or as children of god that faith gets exercised amen and we need to keep the exercising of our faith so it doesn't grow weak so easy for our faith to grow weak but we need to make sure that we keep our faith i'm going to read one more scripture and uh time's getting by but let's turn to uh james here's another one brother brown was talking about and i hear ye him in oregon 1960 he said if you couldn't move a finger move it now if you couldn't hear out of one ear put your finger in the other one no matter or no matter what you are you'll never do no better listen very closely now he says you will never do no better until you exercise your faith you'll never do no better never mind i probably should have finished with that that's probably a good finishing place you'll never do no better until you exercise your faith amen and i'm talking to myself that's good i want to hear this amen i can never do any better until i exercise my faith amen give god a chance at it now give god a chance to do something for you so brother branham is equating exercising the faith as in giving god the chance that's what he said he's coupling the two together exercise your faith give god a chance to do something for you see the prayer of the faith been prayed hands been laid on you but now by the commandment of the lord jesus i command the devil leave you and every one of you be made well amen amen i believe it in the name of jesus amen those things the two that came up here sunday i believe it maybe amen my daughter's gonna go to the doctor tomorrow and you know what doctors aren't gonna find anything wrong with her you know why because there is nothing wrong with her that's right period there's there's there's no discussion uh we've already rebuked the devil so that's over he has no place there that's the end of it amen doesn't matter what else comes about whatever it's against all the doctors can say or think right amen that's the way it is because that's what the bible says james 2 17 even so uh james did i say james 2 17. did i say that right okay james 2 7 8 2 17. even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone faith being alone is dead get that now faith being alone is dead without works is dead yea a man may say thou has faith and i have works show me thy faith without thy works i will show you my faith by my works praise the lord that's exactly what jesus said he said if you can't believe me believe what you see right believe the evidence of who i am right the bible spoke of me my life has replicated what the bible says you see the evidence and the things that's happened in the ministry into my life if you can't believe me because i was born on manure pile believe the things you see happening exactly is it not telling you who i am amen amen show me your faith show me thy faith without thy works i will show thee my faith by my works thou believers that there is one god thou believeth well the devils also believe and tremble did you know that the devils out of hell believe in one god and yet the greatest denominationals and 90 plus percent of them don't right wow but the devils do most of christendom will tell you there's three of them right right some will tell you there's at least two i don't know if you know them i've known some of them too a lot of them will tell you there's three some of them will tell you they're two the bible will tell you there's only one yes so i'm not worried about denominations trying to tell me they're three right or some uh rogue denomination says there's two i want to say what the bible says the bible says there's only one even the devils know there's only one amen praise the lord amen is true now believers there is one god there does well the devils believe also and tremble but will thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar see is thou how faith wrought the wrought his works and by faith was uh by works was faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which said abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god ye see now you see then now that by works a man is justified and not by faith only likewise was not also was not rey had the heart of justified by words when she had received in the messengers sent them out another way for as a body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead works is a manifestation of the faith that you have and the truth of god's word am i it's an evident to prove there's something in your life amen it's something that shows prayer requests we have the things that you have sometimes unspoken sometimes spoken things in your family things may be on your job whatever the situation may be again friend we're living in a country living in a world a country with all the negativity swirling around us right i told my wife the other day i said if this was a hundred years ago 90 plus percent of the americans would not even know that covet existed because it doesn't hardly even affect most of their lives of course most of them lived very secluded anyway and weren't around very many people because you didn't have huge metropolis everywhere like la and new york and so forth but i said you would never even know it you you turn on the news now you look at certain news programs and that's all they yell at you right that's all it's about i've never seen i i told sister norma's husband yesterday it's so good to see ronnie yesterday i told him i said i have never seen people so scared to death and petrified over something that has a 95 plus percent chance of recovery now i understand some people of course pre-existing conditions and things like that that's different of course uh older generation that type but i said 90 they they closed down schools and the statistics say they always say follow the science follow the science follow the statistics follow the data what does the data say the data says that a lot of these places are closing their schools when the data tells them that 99.9 of the children survive coven if they even get it at all yeah almost a 100 chance of survival and yet the everything it's apocalypse amen now one person is too many i understand i've said that before one person passing from it but i'll leave you with this story because this is the fear-mongering that's going on to help us exercise our faith amen i hear them screaming all the time about how many people have died biting through that against trump all the time but i was with a client the other day or someone that we're doing some electrical work for my brother roger was out of town and i was trying to find a trip a breaker kept tripping it had a round short somewhere i was going over their house to find it uh like i did the dinka's house and uh you know you know me most places i go i end up talking about the lord to somebody that wants to talk so uh we're just talking about the lord but he told me that he went into his homeopathic doctor and they had no mask and he asked why she said she says well i'm not under the cdc guidelines i don't know what all that means but that's what she said and so they didn't wear a mask she said i've never had anybody have covered come in but she said she had a client come in and this is how deceptive it is you can't put your faith and trust in all this she came in
