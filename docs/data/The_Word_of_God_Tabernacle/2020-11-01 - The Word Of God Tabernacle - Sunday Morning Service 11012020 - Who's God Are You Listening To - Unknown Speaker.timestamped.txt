[39:50] um i don't remember when i did them
[39:52] thursday friday something like that i
[39:54] got these hung up so
[39:55] i did we we had this temporarily put in
[39:59] here this cords aren't going to be here
[40:00] eventually we'll get the sound booth
[40:02] back in the back
[40:03] um we'll have that cord this cord that's
[40:06] coming from over here is going to go
[40:07] straight to the sound booth
[40:09] and that chord is going to go straight
[40:10] to the sound boost so these chords won't
[40:12] be here but
[40:13] we just set it up temporarily so that we
[40:15] could try to get it to work now and see
[40:16] how it worked and
[40:18] my computer and the tablet that micah
[40:20] brought for
[40:21] zach to work on it's not quite the same
[40:23] especially if you're used to a church it
[40:25] has one that functions properly
[40:28] we're just kind of piece milling it with
[40:31] micah's knowledge and
[40:32] zach's help and getting it all put
[40:34] together so appreciate your indulgence
[40:37] during that period of time there may be
[40:38] a few glitches here and there but
[40:40] eventually brother roger i said it's
[40:42] going to get cameras and put them up
[40:43] here
[40:44] and we're going to get a sound booth put
[40:46] over there so it's going to operate
[40:48] everything
[40:49] so anyway so uh i i like it
[40:52] i think it turned out pretty good um i
[40:55] got a couple things i
[40:56] i think i could do to change it to where
[40:58] to be a little bit different but
[40:59] for now anyway but i appreciate the god
[41:02] providing for that
[41:03] and being able to get the receptacles
[41:05] put in
[41:06] some of that the hardest part was kind
[41:07] of running the wires behind the wall
[41:09] because there's styrofoam back in there
[41:11] and getting it through there was
[41:12] a little challenge but god blessed it
[41:14] and i'm so thankful for that and welcome
[41:16] to the house of god today and appreciate
[41:18] each one of you coming so
[41:20] amen we'll get right to the word now if
[41:21] we could and uh go to
[41:24] first kings if you'd stand to your feet
[41:26] if you could please
[41:27] we'll go to first kings chapter 13.
[41:33] amen first kings chapter 13.
[41:40] i'm going to attempt to see if this
[41:41] works
[41:44] i was going to do that the first day we
[41:45] did this and i didn't but i'm going to
[41:47] try and see if that works because if
[41:50] when angel can come in they're probably
[41:51] going to take all this up here so
[41:54] i don't want to take up my normal spot
[41:56] over there so
[41:58] if we're going to get more people that
[42:01] come in we'll probably
[42:02] have to put a few more chairs out so
[42:08] god bless you uh first kings chapter 13.

[44:32] lord jesus christ we pray
[44:35] amen amen amen first kings chapter 13
[44:38] we're just going to read two verses and
[44:39] we'll let you be seated
[44:41] it's another biblical old testament uh
[44:45] account like we read last week so it's a
[44:48] little lengthy in the reading but we'll
[44:49] just read two verses and we'll let it be
[44:51] seated
[44:52] uh the 23rd verse so we're in first
[44:54] kings chapter 13
[44:56] and we're going to read the beginning of
[44:58] the 23rd and the 24th verse
[45:01] and it came to pass after he had eaten
[45:03] bread and after he had drunk
[45:05] that he saddled for him and asked to
[45:07] went for the prophet
[45:09] whom he had brought back and when he was
[45:11] gone
[45:12] a lion met him by the way and slew him
[45:15] and his carcass was cast in the way and
[45:18] the ass stood by it
[45:19] the lion also stood by the carcass
[45:22] you could be seated if you'd like
[45:26] and pardon me a moment again i forgot to
[45:29] mention
[45:30] also brother roger when i talked to him
[45:33] the other day he told me that brother
[45:35] steve buffalos had been in the hospital
[45:37] uh with an infection
[45:39] so uh please remember him he's out of
[45:40] the hospital now but please remember him
[45:42] in prayer
[45:43] uh the lord would just touch him and of
[45:45] course bringing complete
[45:46] total recovery of his of his body so
[45:49] amen remember him in prayer now this
[45:51] thought came to me the other day
[45:54] as you all know uh brother roger collins
[45:56] had
[45:57] seven i actually had like nine meets and
[45:59] nights and meeting but
[46:00] uh before i had my tooth pulled that
[46:02] monday night i came
[46:04] a man brother john was here and came and
[46:06] brother roger made a
[46:08] a a um he alluded to this
[46:11] story in the bible and it really struck
[46:13] me strong so
[46:14] i decided to write that note down and as
[46:17] i was looking at something that the lord
[46:18] would have me to bring for today this
[46:20] came back to my heart
[46:21] and started looking at it and of course
[46:23] you know if
[46:24] if you've ever well if you're led of the
[46:26] lord you know how it works
[46:28] you know the lord will bless you here
[46:29] and if it's blessed there then it'll
[46:31] bless you over here and then it just
[46:33] keeps evolving and it just keeps
[46:34] building and the lord just
[46:36] blesses and blesses it blesses it so uh
[46:39] as the lord blessed this and
[46:40] as it continued to unfold i just trust
[46:43] and believe it to be the will of the
[46:44] lord today
[46:45] so uh it's his uh story it's it's it's
[46:48] quite an
[46:49] interesting story and and a thought came
[46:51] to my heart actually a title
[46:53] to put to it and the title today is
[46:56] whose god are you listening to
[46:58] amen whose god are you listening to
[47:02] so let's go back to the first verse uh
[47:04] first kings chapter 13. let's go back to
[47:06] the first verse and let's just read
[47:08] through this story
[47:09] we already read the kind of the end of
[47:11] the story we found out what happened to
[47:13] this man at the end of the story but
[47:15] let's
[47:15] let's go back to the beginning of it
[47:17] into the beginning of this chapter
[47:19] and find out how it got to this point
[47:21] and what happened in between those times
[47:23] and
[47:24] and what the difference would make see
[47:26] because uh
[47:27] and remember again even like last week
[47:30] keep in your mind the whole time
[47:32] of the title that we have that we placed
[47:34] on this
[47:35] uh remember last week's title you
[47:38] remember last week's title
[47:40] okay praise the lord this week whose god
[47:42] are you listening to
[47:43] last week was is that you lord this week
[47:46] is whose god are you listening to so
[47:48] as they go through this story think of
[47:50] that keep that in mind of course not
[47:52] just through this story but through this
[47:53] lesson today so
[47:54] first kings chapter 13 verse 1 and
[47:57] behold
[47:59] there came a man of god out of judah by
[48:01] the word of the lord
[48:02] unto bethel and jeroboam stood by the
[48:05] altar to burn incense now notice
[48:08] where this is this is a man of god this
[48:11] is a man of god
[48:12] this is a man of god or prophet of god
[48:15] that's being led
[48:16] by god okay so there came a man of god
[48:19] out of judah
[48:20] by the word of god so it's a man of god
[48:23] a prophet of god that's being led by the
[48:26] spirit of god
[48:27] that god is speaking to and voicing him
[48:29] to go a certain way
[48:31] right amen so he tells him to go into
[48:34] bethel
[48:35] and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn
[48:37] incense
[48:38] and he cried against that now this man
[48:40] of god now
[48:41] cried against the altar in the word of
[48:43] the lord
[48:44] and said o altar altar thus saith the
[48:48] lord behold a child shall be born
[48:51] unto the house of david josiah by name
[48:54] and upon thee shall he offer the priests
[48:57] of the high places that burn incense
[48:59] upon thee
[49:00] and men's bones shall be burned upon
[49:03] thee
[49:03] so now look this is not a pleasant thing
[49:06] that god's sending this prophet to go
[49:08] declare upon these people and upon the
[49:10] king
[49:10] jeroboam this is quite the contrary this
[49:13] is a
[49:14] this is a curse this is a warning and a
[49:17] curse
[49:17] that this man of god by the word of god
[49:19] is giving to the king
[49:21] and upon the altar that the king is
[49:23] standing there
[49:24] outside of the word of the lord this man
[49:27] this jeroboam of course which is a
[49:28] wicked king
[49:30] was standing outside of the word of god
[49:32] because it wasn't his responsibility
[49:34] or his duty as the king to stand there
[49:37] and burn incense on the altar
[49:39] that's the priest job right that's not
[49:41] jeroboam's job
[49:43] but you know just as it happened to uh
[49:46] others
[49:46] um uh in the scripture uriah and
[49:49] different ones
[49:50] that they they got puffed up and think
[49:53] that they're
[49:54] uh more powerful than what they were and
[49:56] they had a greater position than what
[49:57] they
[49:58] should have had and and they took
[49:59] control over things that they shouldn't
[50:01] have taken control over
[50:02] so not only with this man wicked but he
[50:04] was going against the word of god and
[50:06] trying to perform something
[50:07] that wasn't his duty to perform only the
[50:10] priest was supposed to be the ones
[50:12] authorized by god they were consecrated
[50:16] by god
[50:16] to go into that place to burn those
[50:19] incense on behalf of the people
[50:21] to god wasn't the king's job to do was
[50:24] his responsibility
[50:25] he wasn't consecrated he wasn't in the
[50:28] right position
[50:29] he wasn't taught right it wasn't none of
[50:31] this was by the word of god
[50:33] so god sends this prophet down to tell
[50:36] jeroboam
[50:37] this is wrong and this altar is going to
[50:39] be cursed because of you
[50:41] amen third verse now and he gave a sign
[50:45] the same day saying this is the sign
[50:48] which the lord has spoken behold the
[50:50] altar
[50:50] shall be rent and the ashes that are
[50:53] upon
[50:54] it shall be poured out now that's a uh
[50:57] that's just not a fraywear pro of a
[51:00] prophecy
[51:01] that's not a prophecy that a person can
[51:03] say well
[51:04] it did or didn't come to pass it's not a
[51:06] prophecy that's going to happen 700
[51:08] years later
[51:09] it's not going to be a pro it's not a
[51:11] prophecy that's going to happen
[51:13] down the road that nobody could verify
[51:15] or not verify
[51:16] it's a prophecy that was going to happen
[51:18] right then and there
[51:19] that day notice that's what the bible
[51:22] says
[51:23] the sign that day amen
[51:26] it was a sign to be fulfilled that day
[51:30] that the lord has spoken and the altar
[51:33] will be rent and the ashes would be
[51:35] poured out
[51:36] that was going to happen right there
[51:37] before them
[51:40] it came to pass when king jeroboam heard
[51:42] the saying of the man of god which he
[51:44] cried against the altar in bethel
[51:46] that he put forth his hand from the
[51:48] altar
[51:49] saying lay hold on this man in other
[51:52] words
[51:53] he's again prideful he's not humbling
[51:55] himself before the man of god
[51:57] prideful arrogant removes his hand from
[51:59] word never should have been
[52:01] been to begin with and he says lay hold
[52:03] on this man of god who's speaking evil
[52:05] against me and against this altar
[52:08] lay hold hands on him get rid of him
[52:10] basically what he's saying all right
[52:11] you should look in the scripture and
[52:12] they talk about laying hands on somebody
[52:15] it isn't laying hands on to pray for
[52:17] it's laying hands on to
[52:18] to beat and to torture and to get rid of
[52:21] that's what he's talking about
[52:23] lay hand on it means get rid of him
[52:25] right
[52:28] and his hand which he put forth against
[52:30] him
[52:31] dried up so that he could not pull it
[52:33] again unto him
[52:35] and the altar also was rent
[52:38] and the ashes poured out from the altar
[52:41] the fulfillment of the prophecy right
[52:43] there before him
[52:44] amen according to the sign which the man
[52:47] of god had given
[52:48] by the word of god notice that's the
[52:50] third time that it's referencing
[52:52] that this is by the word of god these
[52:55] things are happening
[52:56] by the by the oracle of god by the
[52:59] by the direction of instruction of god
[53:02] this is by the word of god
[53:03] three times now five verses three times
[53:06] it's made sure to mention
[53:08] this is by the word of god this is not a
[53:10] man that is a self-proclaimed prophet
[53:12] this is not a man
[53:14] who's going about his own business it's
[53:15] not a man who's giving his own word
[53:18] this is a man who's speaking by the word
[53:20] of god as that word comes to him amen
[53:24] the altar was rent ash is poured out
[53:26] which the man of god
[53:28] had given by the word of the lord and
[53:30] the king answered and said unto the man
[53:32] of god
[53:33] entreat now the face of the lord thy god
[53:37] the lord thy god notice he didn't say my
[53:39] god he said thy god and treated the
[53:42] the man of god entreat now the face of
[53:44] the lord thy god
[53:46] didn't claim him as his own even though
[53:48] this prophet
[53:49] came from judah and this is a king of
[53:52] israel
[53:53] and there should have been one people
[53:55] they should have been together it should
[53:56] have been
[53:58] one people together you know israel and
[54:00] judah split
[54:01] but they should have been one together
[54:03] but his god he's
[54:04] he's declaring here your god is not my
[54:07] god
[54:08] yeah and treat your god yeah because
[54:10] your god
[54:11] is god and that's the bottom line of it
[54:14] uh once they get out of trouble they
[54:16] don't act like it
[54:18] uh they want to claim god until they get
[54:20] out of trouble and when they're out of
[54:22] trouble they don't need god anymore
[54:23] right
[54:24] it's like people need god when they're
[54:25] sick people need god when they're dying
[54:27] people need god when they're in trouble
[54:29] but when they get it when they're out of
[54:31] trouble and when they're done being sick
[54:32] or whatever
[54:33] they don't need god anymore yeah he's
[54:35] turned their back on god well that's the
[54:37] same thing
[54:38] now happens here king answered the man
[54:41] of god entry now the face of the lord
[54:43] thy god
[54:44] and pray for me that my hand may be
[54:47] restored me
[54:48] again and the man of god besought the
[54:50] lord and the king's hand was restored to
[54:52] him again
[54:52] and became as it was before amen even
[54:55] though
[54:56] the curse was on him with curses upon
[54:58] the altar
[54:59] god still answered that man of god's
[55:02] prayer for that man's hand to come back
[55:04] right again amen
[55:06] and the king said unto the man of god
[55:08] come home with me and refresh thyself
[55:10] and i will give thee a reward
[55:12] the man of god said unto the king if
[55:15] thou will give me
[55:16] half thy house i will not go in with
[55:19] thee neither will i eat bread nor drink
[55:21] water in this place
[55:23] for so was i it so was it charged me
[55:27] by the word of the lord praise the lord
[55:31] charged me by the word of the lord
[55:33] saying eat no bread
[55:34] nor drink water nor turn again by the
[55:37] same way that thou
[55:38] came us so he went another way and
[55:41] returned not by the way which he came to
[55:43] bethel amen
[55:44] now listen this man of god has performed
[55:48] the responsibility that god by the word
[55:51] of god had given him
[55:53] right he had gone and had and had
[55:56] dispersed
[55:57] what god had requested of him to do amen
[56:00] and he leaves
[56:01] exactly like the word tells him to leave
[56:04] he goes some other way and leaves out uh
[56:07] uh by that way that came through bethel
[56:10] he's leaving a different way doing just
[56:11] exactly that's what the word said do
[56:13] amen god told him by the word of god do
[56:15] this do this do this do this don't do
[56:17] this don't do this and don't do this you
[56:19] know
[56:19] sometimes the don'ts are just as
[56:21] important as to do exactly right
[56:23] sometimes the don't do this is just as
[56:25] important as they do do this
[56:27] right amen sounds kind of weird i guess
[56:29] but it's true
[56:31] amen the dues are just as important too
[56:33] but sometimes the don'ts are just as
[56:34] important don't do this don't do that
[56:36] because it's god's word yes it's not a
[56:39] man's word
[56:40] it's not some rhetoric it's not
[56:43] something thrown out
[56:44] uh just haphazardly this is the word of
[56:46] god
[56:47] remember the word of god will not return
[56:49] void it
[56:50] will accomplish what it is sends out for
[56:54] it will accomplish that now we use that
[56:57] a lot i use it a lot
[56:58] to to talk about what the lord's doing
[57:01] in our services
[57:03] and when the lord sends the word out he
[57:05] sends it out for a purpose
[57:06] yes and we pray god accomplish the
[57:08] purpose that you sent it for
[57:10] whatever part you wanted it to play
[57:13] whatever point you wanted it to make
[57:15] whatever you wanted to be accomplished
[57:17] by it lord let it be accomplished
[57:19] whether it's by the voice of a singer or
[57:21] somebody testifying or
[57:23] the ministry whatever it is lord when
[57:25] you send it forth accomplish what you
[57:27] said
[57:27] forth for now that's a good and positive
[57:30] thought
[57:30] but what about the other side of it
[57:33] sometimes the word of the lord is
[57:34] brought forth
[57:35] as a curse as a responsibility
[57:40] the word of god is brought to us so that
[57:42] we are to live by it
[57:43] and follow it well what happens if we
[57:46] don't that's right
[57:48] it's still going to accomplish what it
[57:50] was sent forth for amen
[57:52] amen right you still want to accomplish
[57:54] that
[57:56] even if it's not something you say oh
[57:57] well this is good lord accomplish the
[57:59] blessings in our life and the
[58:01] and the growing in you lord but it's
[58:02] also going to accomplish
[58:04] what god sent it forth even if it
[58:06] becomes a negative in your life
[58:08] or seemingly negative anyway it will
[58:10] accomplish it anyway
[58:12] regardless so god's word is going to
[58:14] accomplish itself
[58:15] period he just uses willing subjects to
[58:18] do it through
[58:20] it's going to accomplish you can't deny
[58:22] that and you can't stop it
[58:24] it's going to accomplish it amen it will
[58:26] not return void
[58:28] it's going to do it so he's done
[58:30] everything now
[58:31] god has given this man of god a word of
[58:34] the lord to do this
[58:35] do this don't do this don't do this it's
[58:38] going to accomplish what he sent it
[58:39] forth for
[58:40] amen but he's got to obey it the man of
[58:43] god has got to obey it
[58:44] amen he's got to continue to obey it now
[58:47] 11th verse let's continue on the rest of
[58:49] the story
[58:50] because we haven't even gotten to the uh
[58:52] the the subject i want to talk about
[58:54] now they're dwelling on uh their dwell
[58:57] an old prophet
[58:59] in bethel so this man of god
[59:02] god this man of god has followed god's
[59:05] bidding
[59:06] he's followed the leading of the lord he
[59:09] has done what the lord wanted him to do
[59:12] the lord told him to go a different way
[59:13] he's going a different way by through
[59:15] bethel
[59:16] and there's a prophet in bethel an
[59:19] old prophet old man that is man of god
[59:22] we assume look at it by the readings if
[59:24] you go through the scripture and then
[59:25] samuel
[59:26] it's a younger man this is an older
[59:28] prophet
[59:29] now this older prophet in bethel and his
[59:32] sons
[59:32] came and told all the works that the man
[59:35] of god had done that day
[59:36] in bethel the words which he had spoken
[59:40] unto the king
[59:41] then they all they told also to their
[59:44] father now
[59:45] if this if this prophet is in bethel
[59:48] and he's a real true prophet and we're
[59:50] going to believe that he was a prophet
[59:53] you know there's there's prophets that
[59:55] are that are prophets that follow the
[59:57] leading of the lord and
[59:58] do the bidding of god and there's
[1:00:00] prophets like balaam like we talked
[1:00:02] about last week that are hireling
[1:00:03] prophets
[1:00:04] and they don't do the bidding of the
[1:00:05] lord and they don't follow the will of
[1:00:07] the lord nor the word of the lord
[1:00:09] but they're still prophets because
[1:00:10] they're born that's a gift that brought
[1:00:12] that gift see and so this old prophet
[1:00:16] if he's in the land of bethel he's in a
[1:00:19] place
[1:00:20] that god has already cursed he's in a
[1:00:22] place where jeroboam is
[1:00:24] that the the cursing of god has come
[1:00:27] upon the altar and
[1:00:29] what god had promised that he would do
[1:00:31] to them and for
[1:00:32] them so if this old prophet is there
[1:00:36] and all of this wicked things are going
[1:00:38] on why isn't this older prophet
[1:00:40] screaming out against it
[1:00:43] now i understand the prophet's got to do
[1:00:45] with what the lord tells him to do
[1:00:47] this old prophet has got to speak only
[1:00:49] what god gives him to speak
[1:00:51] and just like makaya did there in the
[1:00:54] second kings he has to speak what god
[1:00:56] says to speak
[1:00:57] of course micaiah was one prophet that
[1:00:59] listened to god when there was 400 over
[1:01:01] here that just did whatever
[1:01:03] uh um ahab said right so
[1:01:06] you see the statistics there but anyway
[1:01:08] as we continue see
[1:01:10] if he's this old man this whole prophet
[1:01:12] that's in bethel
[1:01:13] why isn't something happening here for
[1:01:16] this old prophet to say something
[1:01:18] but this old prophet gets something when
[1:01:21] his sons come and tell him about what
[1:01:23] had just happened
[1:01:25] no doubt this old prophet
[1:01:28] probably thinking to himself and in his
[1:01:30] heart back
[1:01:31] about wow i haven't seen something like
[1:01:34] that happen in years
[1:01:36] i haven't seen anything like that i
[1:01:38] haven't seen anything that supernatural
[1:01:40] take place
[1:01:41] in years let's go meet this young guy
[1:01:45] so the sons come and tell him and this
[1:01:48] man this old prophet gets in his heart
[1:01:50] he wants to go find this guy
[1:01:52] so 12th verse their father said unto
[1:01:55] them now
[1:01:56] say let's go find this guy what way went
[1:01:59] he
[1:01:59] for his sons had seen what what way the
[1:02:03] man of god went
[1:02:04] which he came down came from judah and
[1:02:06] he said unto his sons
[1:02:08] saddle me the ass so they saddled him in
[1:02:10] the ass and he
[1:02:12] rode thereon and went after the man of
[1:02:14] god
[1:02:15] and found him sitting under an oak tree
[1:02:17] and said unto him
[1:02:18] art thou the man of god that cameth for
[1:02:21] uh came is from judah
[1:02:23] and he said i am then he said unto him
[1:02:26] come home with me and eat bread now what
[1:02:29] was the word of the lord to this young
[1:02:30] man
[1:02:31] this this man of god do not
[1:02:35] eat any bread do not drink any water
[1:02:38] do not stop or lodge anywhere
[1:02:42] but do your bidding and come home amen
[1:02:45] he already told jeroboam that when
[1:02:47] jeroboam wanted to come and stay with
[1:02:49] him
[1:02:50] and he said i won't do it for the half
[1:02:52] of the kingdom i won't do it
[1:02:54] right but now this old prophet comes
[1:02:57] amen not the king not the wicked king
[1:02:59] but the old prophet
[1:03:00] see he comes come home with me and eat
[1:03:05] bread and he said
[1:03:06] i may not return with thee nor go in
[1:03:09] with thee neither will i eat bread nor
[1:03:11] drink water with thee in this place now
[1:03:14] what's he doing he's repeating what god
[1:03:16] told him to do i can't do it god told me
[1:03:19] not to do it i'm not going to do it
[1:03:21] but look what the old man says for it
[1:03:24] was said to me by the word of the lord
[1:03:26] thou shalt eat no bread drink no water
[1:03:28] nor turn again by the way that thou
[1:03:30] camest
[1:03:31] he said unto him the old man now the old
[1:03:33] prophet
[1:03:34] he said unto him i am a prophet also as
[1:03:38] thou art o prophet maybe
[1:03:41] as thou art i doubt right amen it might
[1:03:44] have been an old prophet yes
[1:03:46] but as this young prophet was i doubt
[1:03:49] amen
[1:03:50] just because of the actions right amen
[1:03:53] and
[1:03:54] and he uh now look and he said unto him
[1:03:57] i am a prophet also
[1:03:59] as thou art and an angel spake unto me
[1:04:03] by the word of the lord
[1:04:04] saying bring him back with thee into
[1:04:07] thine house that he may eat bread
[1:04:09] and drink water but he lied
[1:04:12] unto him the old prophet lied
[1:04:16] unto the young prophet amen but now
[1:04:18] what's the young prophet got to do
[1:04:20] he's got a decision to make correct
[1:04:23] because
[1:04:23] now this old prophet is not only saying
[1:04:26] hey
[1:04:26] come eat with me he's now saying but an
[1:04:29] angel came to me with the word of god
[1:04:33] telling him to go get this young prophet
[1:04:35] and come and stay with me and eat bread
[1:04:37] and drink water
[1:04:40] now what's the subject what's the title
[1:04:42] today
[1:04:44] who's god are you going to listen to the
[1:04:46] god that told
[1:04:47] you to go do this and to not lodge or
[1:04:51] eat or drink and come home
[1:04:53] are you going to listen to this man's
[1:04:55] god
[1:04:56] who's god you're going to listen to
[1:04:58] because this man that's the actual
[1:05:00] that's
[1:05:00] absolute decision this man has got to
[1:05:02] make right now
[1:05:03] he's got to decide right now is he going
[1:05:05] to listen and obey the god that told him
[1:05:08] what to do
[1:05:09] or is he going to listen to a god that
[1:05:11] this old man said
[1:05:12] what told him to do
[1:05:16] see there's a lot of voices in the land
[1:05:17] today friends there's a lot of voices a
[1:05:20] lot of things there's
[1:05:21] a lot of people talking there's a lot of
[1:05:23] people say well the lord said and the
[1:05:24] lord said you could turn on tvs and you
[1:05:26] can hear it all day long the lord said
[1:05:27] the lord said the lord told me
[1:05:29] the lord told me you can hear it and see
[1:05:30] it all the time there's all kinds of
[1:05:32] voices in the world today
[1:05:34] there's governments politics there's uh
[1:05:36] people everybody wants a voice
[1:05:38] everybody's got a voice but the problem
[1:05:41] i think
[1:05:42] is a lot of the times the problem is
[1:05:44] that
[1:05:45] people have become so devoid of
[1:05:47] listening to the word of god
[1:05:49] so devoid of even knowing when it's god
[1:05:51] speaking to them
[1:05:53] that they don't even know it's god
[1:05:54] talking to begin with right
[1:05:57] so is it god or is it god i don't know
[1:06:00] i just do what this one says or i just
[1:06:02] go with the see friend
[1:06:03] you cannot live and prosper in the lord
[1:06:07] on somebody else's revelation amen
[1:06:09] amen you cannot do it amen
[1:06:12] god has called you as individuals to
[1:06:15] live
[1:06:15] your life for him according to the
[1:06:17] calling of god in your life
[1:06:19] and when god tells you to do something i
[1:06:22] don't care how many other people come
[1:06:23] against it or say anything about it
[1:06:25] or tell you to do something different
[1:06:27] you do what god told you to do
[1:06:31] now understand it's not going to be
[1:06:32] anything unscriptural right
[1:06:34] amen it's not going to be anything
[1:06:35] unscriptural it's not going to be
[1:06:36] something sinful so
[1:06:38] well the lord told me to do this and
[1:06:40] that that god told you to do is sinful
[1:06:42] or against his word
[1:06:44] doesn't work that way amen it doesn't
[1:06:46] work that way but again a person
[1:06:48] has to be in tune to the holy spirit see
[1:06:51] god will only hold
[1:06:52] you responsible for what he tells
[1:06:56] you he's not going to hold the other
[1:06:58] person that lied to you
[1:07:01] what responsible he's going to hold you
[1:07:04] responsible
[1:07:06] it's just it goes back to the garden of
[1:07:08] eden like we've said many times
[1:07:10] when god told adam what to do when he
[1:07:13] came to the curse
[1:07:14] he god didn't even reference to the
[1:07:16] serpent or to eve
[1:07:18] or the woman she wasn't eve then but he
[1:07:20] didn't even reference to the serpent
[1:07:22] or to the woman what he told a a
[1:07:25] adam in the garden of eden
[1:07:29] god told adam don't do this don't do
[1:07:32] this
[1:07:32] you can do this this this and this but
[1:07:34] don't do this and don't do this remember
[1:07:36] sometimes the don'ts is just as
[1:07:38] important as the news
[1:07:40] because it's still god's word as long as
[1:07:42] it's still god's word it's just as
[1:07:44] important
[1:07:44] right and then when they fail and they
[1:07:47] all come to this great council of the
[1:07:49] three of them with god
[1:07:51] they're all passing the book of course
[1:07:52] to one or the other right but god does
[1:07:54] not hold the serpent
[1:07:56] responsible for what he told adam
[1:07:59] god doesn't hold eve responsible of the
[1:08:01] woman responsible for what he told adam
[1:08:04] god told adam do not
[1:08:07] do this amen now when he cursed the
[1:08:11] the ground and he he cursed the serpent
[1:08:13] and and the woman he did
[1:08:14] he didn't say but now did i tell you
[1:08:18] he didn't tell the woman that why did he
[1:08:21] tell her that
[1:08:22] because god didn't tell her he told adam
[1:08:25] so who's responsible adam
[1:08:29] it's adam's responsibility to do what
[1:08:31] god told him to do
[1:08:32] god is only going to hold you
[1:08:34] responsible for what he tells
[1:08:37] you amen he's not going to hold somebody
[1:08:40] else responsible
[1:08:41] i don't care if they lied to you i don't
[1:08:43] care if they deceived you
[1:08:45] i don't care if they tricked you into it
[1:08:47] god's going to hold
[1:08:48] you responsible for what he tells you
[1:08:51] not somebody
[1:08:52] else the question then is
[1:08:55] what god do you listen to who's god are
[1:08:57] you listening to
[1:08:58] whose revelation are you living on
[1:09:01] friend
[1:09:02] you cannot live on my revelation right
[1:09:05] my wife can't live on my revelation my
[1:09:07] children grandchildren
[1:09:08] cannot live on my revelation they have
[1:09:11] to live on their own amen
[1:09:13] they have to do what god calls them to
[1:09:15] do amen they have to listen to the god
[1:09:17] that speaks to them
[1:09:19] i got to do the same thing in my life i
[1:09:21] got to listen to the god that talks to
[1:09:23] me
[1:09:24] i can't go on somebody else's revelation
[1:09:27] i can't
[1:09:28] i don't we're not meeting in this
[1:09:29] beautiful building today because brother
[1:09:31] roger told me to
[1:09:33] right oh brother nat told me too we're
[1:09:35] meeting in this beautiful building today
[1:09:37] because god spoke to me
[1:09:39] amen amen and when the opportunity came
[1:09:42] in the
[1:09:42] and it opened up we just walked right
[1:09:45] into it i praise the lord here it is yes
[1:09:48] and thank god for it but i didn't do it
[1:09:49] because somebody else told me to
[1:09:51] right i didn't move to tucson because
[1:09:53] somebody told me to
[1:09:54] i didn't move to florida because
[1:09:56] somebody told me to i didn't go to the
[1:09:58] white mountains because somebody told me
[1:09:59] to
[1:10:00] i went because god told me to yeah right
[1:10:03] and you talk about the opposition friend
[1:10:06] yes you want to talk about opposition
[1:10:08] when god speaks to your friend you're
[1:10:10] going to get more opposition than you
[1:10:12] ever imagined
[1:10:13] you're going to get the devils and two
[1:10:15] hundred thousand demons on you like
[1:10:17] white on rice or white on white rice
[1:10:20] there's other kinds of rice in there
[1:10:21] anyway they're gonna be all over you
[1:10:24] like nothing
[1:10:25] why because they don't want you to
[1:10:28] accomplish what god is sending you
[1:10:30] forth to do right and if you do do it
[1:10:32] they want to curse you somehow
[1:10:34] to where you're not able to do it again
[1:10:36] right amen
[1:10:38] that's what happened to this young man i
[1:10:40] will read the rest of the story but
[1:10:41] we've already read what happened to him
[1:10:43] right that was the first couple of
[1:10:45] verses we read we found out what
[1:10:46] happened to the poor guy
[1:10:48] just because he was doing what god told
[1:10:50] him not to do right
[1:10:52] just because another man come across and
[1:10:54] lied to him
[1:10:56] lied to him that an angel spoke to him
[1:10:59] and told him by the word of the lord
[1:11:02] now will that old prophet have to pay a
[1:11:04] price
[1:11:05] for deception and lying of course he
[1:11:07] will right but who did god hold
[1:11:09] responsible for this young man's
[1:11:11] disobedience
[1:11:13] god did god held him responsible god
[1:11:16] didn't kill the old prophet
[1:11:19] god just killed the young prophet god
[1:11:21] just killed the man of god
[1:11:22] because he disobeyed let's read the rest
[1:11:25] of it
[1:11:26] as we'll continue on
[1:11:31] and he lied to him see not 18 first but
[1:11:34] he lied to him
[1:11:36] so he went back with him and did eat in
[1:11:39] the house in his house and drank water
[1:11:41] and it came to pass
[1:11:42] as they sat at the table that the word
[1:11:44] of the lord came unto the prophet that
[1:11:45] brought him back
[1:11:46] and he cried unto the man of god that
[1:11:48] came from judah saying
[1:11:50] thus saith the lord for as much as thou
[1:11:52] has disobeyed
[1:11:54] the mouth of the lord and has not kept
[1:11:56] the commandment which the lord god had
[1:11:58] commanded thee
[1:11:59] but came us back and has eaten bread and
[1:12:02] drank
[1:12:03] drunk water in this place of which the
[1:12:05] lord did say to thee
[1:12:07] eat no bread drink no water thy carcass
[1:12:10] shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy
[1:12:13] fathers
[1:12:15] my mind how many times does disobedience
[1:12:19] lead to death
[1:12:20] right yes since the garden of eden
[1:12:23] yes when god told adam the day you do
[1:12:26] this the day you die
[1:12:28] the day you disobey is the day you die
[1:12:30] how many times has disobedience brought
[1:12:32] death
[1:12:33] sometimes spiritual death sometimes just
[1:12:35] a separation from god sometimes a
[1:12:37] physical death
[1:12:38] but it always accomplishes what god said
[1:12:40] it will yes
[1:12:41] disobedience brings death
[1:12:45] you will not your carcass shall not come
[1:12:48] to the sepulchre of thy followers
[1:12:50] and we read 23rd verse and he came to
[1:12:51] pass after he had eaten bread and after
[1:12:53] he had drunk that he saddled him
[1:12:55] settled for him in the ass to whip for
[1:12:56] the prophet whom he had
[1:12:58] brought back when he was gone a lion met
[1:13:00] him by the way slew him and his carcass
[1:13:03] was cast in the way they asked to buy it
[1:13:05] the lion stood by the carcass lion
[1:13:07] didn't even eat it
[1:13:08] he just killed him right and the lion
[1:13:10] stood there
[1:13:12] lying set there after he killed him
[1:13:14] remember the opossum last week
[1:13:17] who has control over nature who has
[1:13:19] control over these animals
[1:13:22] he told the possum to come down the
[1:13:24] street and come down the alley and sit
[1:13:25] right there at that prophet's door right
[1:13:27] right
[1:13:27] sit right there at brother branham's
[1:13:29] door waiting for him to pray on
[1:13:31] before him waiting there with those
[1:13:33] babies suckling on her
[1:13:34] waiting there with the dude falling on
[1:13:36] her all night long
[1:13:38] waiting for that man of god to come pray
[1:13:39] as soon as he prayed she got up and took
[1:13:41] her babies and went down the hall
[1:13:42] uh went down the way looked back thank
[1:13:44] you sir went back in the woods and
[1:13:48] this lion commissioned by god
[1:13:52] can i say it that way yes okay this lion
[1:13:54] commissioned by god
[1:13:56] kills this young man and just late just
[1:13:59] leaves and laying there and just sets
[1:14:00] there
[1:14:01] doesn't do anything to him doesn't eat
[1:14:03] him just leaves it there
[1:14:06] and behold men passed by and saw the
[1:14:08] carcass cast in the way
[1:14:10] and the lion standing by the carcass as
[1:14:12] they came and told the city
[1:14:14] where the old prophet dwelled
[1:14:17] the lion was just sitting there even
[1:14:19] when other people passed by to see the
[1:14:21] scene
[1:14:22] and saw the carcass laying there they
[1:14:24] saw the lion sitting there
[1:14:26] the lion had completed his job he wasn't
[1:14:29] after the other guys
[1:14:31] he wasn't eating the old prop of the
[1:14:34] young prophet
[1:14:35] he was just sitting there because he had
[1:14:38] done what he was supposed to do
[1:14:40] but this unfortunately young prophet
[1:14:44] was deceived by this older prophet into
[1:14:46] doing something that god told him not to
[1:14:48] do
[1:14:49] and friend the bible tells us many many
[1:14:52] places
[1:14:53] what we should do and many many places
[1:14:56] what we should not do
[1:14:57] right that's why we live the lives we
[1:14:59] live in and dress the way we dress
[1:15:01] not the way we do and go the places or
[1:15:03] not go places
[1:15:05] that we don't go because god has
[1:15:08] commissioned and called and separated
[1:15:10] the group of people out of the world
[1:15:12] and we are those people amen we are
[1:15:15] those people so when god tells you to do
[1:15:17] something
[1:15:17] you say what is in his word sure there's
[1:15:20] many
[1:15:21] places in his word but there are times
[1:15:23] that god speaks to you personally
[1:15:24] now that's the time we must have our
[1:15:26] ears ready our spiritual acuity ready
[1:15:29] for what the lord would speak to us
[1:15:30] about
[1:15:31] or want us to do or tell us about
[1:15:34] i i really like it when someone is in a
[1:15:38] as a pastor for many years in the valley
[1:15:40] of decision and
[1:15:41] and trying to make a decision and
[1:15:43] they'll tell me and they'll say brother
[1:15:45] mutant
[1:15:45] i just want to take this before the lord
[1:15:47] and i said praise the lord brother
[1:15:49] sister i'll be with you
[1:15:50] and we'll go to the lord together with
[1:15:52] this right now we may be in two
[1:15:54] different domiciles maybe in two
[1:15:55] different places
[1:15:56] but we're still going to the same god
[1:15:58] right amen and we're
[1:16:00] coming to god to find out lord what is
[1:16:02] your word on this what would you say
[1:16:05] what would you have me do
[1:16:07] amen amen what would you have me do
[1:16:10] job had a whirlwind fire
[1:16:14] thundered lightning but he said god
[1:16:16] comes by in a steal small voice he
[1:16:18] misses him
[1:16:20] but that spiritual acuity of knowing the
[1:16:23] voice of the lord
[1:16:24] amen being in tune to the voice of the
[1:16:26] lord i told you many times it's the
[1:16:28] first time i'm going to say this since
[1:16:29] my mom passed away but
[1:16:32] my mom could have called me on the phone
[1:16:36] and the and i didn't need caller id
[1:16:39] the first second i heard that woman's
[1:16:41] voice on the other end of the line i
[1:16:42] knew exactly who it was
[1:16:45] now how did i know exactly within five
[1:16:48] seconds of who was on the other line
[1:16:50] without caller id how would i know that
[1:16:53] because i've heard my mama's voice my
[1:16:55] entire life plus nine months
[1:16:58] i've been listening to her voice all my
[1:17:00] life
[1:17:01] i know her voice i know it when she
[1:17:04] speaks to me
[1:17:04] i know when she's the one on the other
[1:17:06] end of the line i know it's her
[1:17:08] because i can tell her voice well friend
[1:17:11] that's the exact same thing
[1:17:12] that's how you know the voice of the
[1:17:14] lord people have asked me well how do i
[1:17:15] know it's god
[1:17:16] i said well do you talk to him very much
[1:17:18] right do you
[1:17:19] have a relationship with him do you
[1:17:21] converse with him
[1:17:22] do you talk to him has he ever talked to
[1:17:25] you have you ever listened to his voice
[1:17:27] have you ever been in a in a still small
[1:17:31] a quiet place to converse and to talk
[1:17:34] with him and let him talk back
[1:17:37] if you've got a relationship friend you
[1:17:39] know it
[1:17:41] he knows it when you speak he knows it's
[1:17:44] you when he speaks you know it's him
[1:17:47] that's how you know the difference it's
[1:17:48] about how do i know it's the devil it's
[1:17:50] not the devil
[1:17:51] because first of all to be according to
[1:17:52] the word won't be off the word the devil
[1:17:54] make sure and get you off the word even
[1:17:55] though 99
[1:17:57] of truth comes from the devil it's that
[1:18:00] one percent that perverts
[1:18:02] the other thing is you'll know his voice
[1:18:05] if you have a relationship with him and
[1:18:07] you know him and you know him
[1:18:08] intimately when he speaks to you you
[1:18:10] know it because you've been talking to
[1:18:12] him right
[1:18:13] you've been in conversation with him
[1:18:15] you've been
[1:18:16] in fellowship and in friendship and
[1:18:18] relationship with him that's how you
[1:18:20] know his voice
[1:18:21] it's very simple if you don't
[1:18:24] yeah you're not gonna know its voice you
[1:18:26] might
[1:18:27] but you might very well just be deceived
[1:18:29] too
[1:18:31] but if you've had that relationship and
[1:18:33] you know it's god and god
[1:18:34] vindicates and backs up his word you
[1:18:37] know it's god
[1:18:38] amen i know when god speaks to me friend
[1:18:42] i know it because he's proved it very
[1:18:44] much and i know when he speaks he backs
[1:18:46] it up
[1:18:47] my man in ways that are miraculous and
[1:18:50] supernatural am i
[1:18:52] i trust that we could probably stand
[1:18:54] here for the rest of the day with
[1:18:55] testimonies along those lines it's not
[1:18:57] just
[1:18:58] me i understand that but i'm the one
[1:19:01] talking so i have to draw my own
[1:19:02] experience
[1:19:03] so but i know you have it too but it's
[1:19:06] listening to that voice
[1:19:09] some people seem more interested
[1:19:13] and busier with their lives to fix you
[1:19:16] than they are to fix themselves right
[1:19:18] right it's not my job to fix you
[1:19:22] it's not your job to fix me or someone
[1:19:25] else
[1:19:25] right that's not my my my job my
[1:19:29] position is to worry about numero uno
[1:19:32] right and and and my relationship with
[1:19:35] the lord amen
[1:19:36] amen now i mean obviously it's my heart
[1:19:39] and my
[1:19:40] uh my thoughts and my prayers towards
[1:19:42] others absolutely
[1:19:44] but i'm not here to fix them i'm just
[1:19:46] here to try to help them right amen
[1:19:48] i'm just here to try to help you if i
[1:19:50] can if you need help i'll try to be here
[1:19:52] every second i can
[1:19:54] to help you every one of you amen
[1:19:57] i am you're on the hook up or you're
[1:19:59] sitting here i
[1:20:00] i guarantee you promise if you need me
[1:20:02] i'll do everything i can to be there to
[1:20:04] help
[1:20:04] the lord praise god but i'm not here to
[1:20:08] to babysit you or to uh to fix you
[1:20:12] all this is wrong and this is wrong and
[1:20:13] this is wrong you know what
[1:20:15] i had to tell a brother one time he he
[1:20:17] called and said something said well
[1:20:18] don't say so and so i said brother if
[1:20:20] there's any correction that needs to be
[1:20:22] done
[1:20:22] god will do it yes that's not my
[1:20:25] position
[1:20:26] that's not my job the bible says
[1:20:28] vengeance is mine saith newton bennett
[1:20:31] you no it says vengeance his mind saith
[1:20:34] the lord that's not my job that's for
[1:20:36] him to do right
[1:20:37] amen if there's anything that needs to
[1:20:38] be done or fixed let god do it
[1:20:41] let god fix it god is again god is only
[1:20:44] going to hold you responsible for what
[1:20:47] he tells
[1:20:48] you to do amen amen let's look at
[1:20:51] another story here
[1:20:58] notice oh let's go to first samuel
[1:21:03] first samuel chapter 15. notice though
[1:21:05] now this old prophet
[1:21:07] for this scripture reading never
[1:21:10] suffered any consequences
[1:21:13] he is the one that lied that got this
[1:21:15] poor young man killed
[1:21:17] but he suffered no consequences that you
[1:21:20] can see
[1:21:21] now we obviously know there's going to
[1:21:24] be consequences for his actions
[1:21:25] obviously but right then at that point
[1:21:29] god only held that young man responsible
[1:21:31] for what he told him not the old man
[1:21:33] and and and what god holds this old
[1:21:36] prophet responsible for
[1:21:38] is not what he told the young prophet
[1:21:42] he's not going to hold that man
[1:21:43] responsible for what he told the man of
[1:21:45] god
[1:21:46] he's only going to hold him responsible
[1:21:48] for lying about what he said
[1:21:50] that's what he's going to be held
[1:21:52] responsible for amen
[1:21:55] now first samuel chapter 15
[1:22:00] uh let's start with verse nine y'all
[1:22:02] know the story very well
[1:22:05] micah probably more than most of you
[1:22:07] micah's probably heard me tell this
[1:22:09] story more than anybody
[1:22:13] i told this to a lot of churches back
[1:22:15] east and
[1:22:16] micah drove me around so but it's
[1:22:19] saul now i don't know if you have a
[1:22:22] scofield bible
[1:22:24] if you have a scope of the bible my
[1:22:25] scofield bible at the top of
[1:22:28] chapter 15 it says saul's
[1:22:31] incomplete obedience well friend
[1:22:34] i know scofield was a small smart man i
[1:22:37] know a lot of his notes are good they're
[1:22:38] accurate i know
[1:22:39] some of them that aren't brother brandon
[1:22:41] said some of schofield notes are wrong
[1:22:44] and i've known by studying through my
[1:22:46] bible that there's a lot of his notes
[1:22:48] that are wrong
[1:22:48] but i know he's a highly intelligent man
[1:22:50] a theologian
[1:22:52] but i'm sorry whoever put this
[1:22:55] and i'm going to assume it's him
[1:22:57] couldn't be more wrong
[1:23:00] this is not saul's incomplete
[1:23:03] obedience story is about saul's
[1:23:07] blatant disobedience right not
[1:23:10] in complete obedience friend i'm sorry
[1:23:14] but to me and before god there is no
[1:23:16] such thing as
[1:23:17] incomplete obedience you either obey
[1:23:20] god's word or you don't
[1:23:22] period there is no income why did 80
[1:23:26] of what you said lord what good does
[1:23:28] that do
[1:23:29] that's right god called you to do 100
[1:23:32] he expects 100 percent he's not asking
[1:23:36] you to follow him
[1:23:37] 80 he wants a hundred percent of you
[1:23:40] right he just said lord i i i believe
[1:23:43] this word i believe this message
[1:23:44] up to a point what do you believe it at
[1:23:47] all then
[1:23:48] right why do you live this at all look
[1:23:50] friend
[1:23:51] it all that's going to do is make a
[1:23:52] human miserable right
[1:23:54] amen all it's going to do is drive you
[1:23:56] crazy and make you miserable and you
[1:23:58] live a miserable life
[1:24:00] if you can't believe it if you can't
[1:24:02] live it if it's not in you to do
[1:24:04] i can't believe i'm saying this but go
[1:24:06] live in the world at least
[1:24:08] enjoy some of what you got right because
[1:24:10] if you're not going in
[1:24:12] you might as well enjoy this little bit
[1:24:14] because it's all you're gonna have
[1:24:16] that's right yes i've had people tell me
[1:24:20] the things that about others in the
[1:24:23] world and i said well pray for them
[1:24:24] that's the first thing
[1:24:26] obviously we pray for them there's a
[1:24:27] soul in there worth 10 million worlds
[1:24:29] pray for them
[1:24:30] pray the lord and pray they'll see the
[1:24:32] lord they'll come to the lord but
[1:24:34] otherwise let them alone let them have
[1:24:37] their riches
[1:24:38] let them have their wealth let them have
[1:24:39] their fun life and their bars and their
[1:24:41] carousing whatever the gambling whatever
[1:24:43] they do
[1:24:44] let them have it's all they're going to
[1:24:45] have right yes if they're going to end
[1:24:48] up
[1:24:48] in demise anyway at least let them enjoy
[1:24:51] a little bit but friend don't be
[1:24:53] miserable here and go to hell
[1:24:55] right you understand what i'm saying
[1:24:58] amen
[1:24:58] i'm sorry but i'm kind of a black and
[1:25:00] white preacher kind of
[1:25:02] as the shoe fits wear it you know i'm
[1:25:05] not preaching any one person
[1:25:07] but if the shoe fits wear it and don't
[1:25:10] curl up your toes and say the shoe
[1:25:12] doesn't fit either if it fits put it on
[1:25:16] don't curl up your toes and say well
[1:25:17] these shoes don't fit well they don't
[1:25:19] because you're curling your toes
[1:25:21] you're curling your little spirit up
[1:25:22] there and you said i don't believe this
[1:25:24] that's your choice but if the shoe fits
[1:25:28] friend until you wear it
[1:25:29] but it's it's a can you go with me a
[1:25:32] minute to say
[1:25:33] don't be miserable here and end up going
[1:25:35] to hell that's right
[1:25:37] if you can't live it if you're not
[1:25:38] predestined if you're not one of his and
[1:25:40] do the best you can to live the happiest
[1:25:42] life you can on this earth
[1:25:44] enjoy it to the to the to the best of
[1:25:46] your ability
[1:25:48] because once life leaves this body you
[1:25:50] got nothing
[1:25:51] that's right that's the great hope that
[1:25:53] we have
[1:25:54] amen we have a happy life here and god
[1:25:57] blesses
[1:25:57] us and we're going to have eternal life
[1:26:00] and live in perfection with our savior
[1:26:02] amen and with one another thank you
[1:26:05] amen yes i'm looking forward to spending
[1:26:07] eternity
[1:26:08] folks that okay amen i am
[1:26:13] samuel now no incomplete obedience
[1:26:16] it's either obedience or disobedience
[1:26:18] period
[1:26:20] but saul said ninth verse saw in the
[1:26:23] people
[1:26:24] spared a gag and the best of the sheep
[1:26:26] and the oxen of the fatlings and the
[1:26:28] lamps and all that was good
[1:26:30] would not utterly destroy them but
[1:26:32] everything that was vile and refused
[1:26:34] that they uh they destroyed utterly now
[1:26:39] god's commission to saul the king
[1:26:43] was to utterly destroy and kill the
[1:26:46] amalekites
[1:26:47] and everything that was living human and
[1:26:51] animal
[1:26:51] amen god even told him to
[1:26:55] kill the women the infant and the
[1:26:57] sucklings
[1:26:58] right kill them all eradicate them
[1:27:02] destroy them every animal
[1:27:05] every person every baby
[1:27:08] kill them yes that's god's instructions
[1:27:11] amen saul as we just read came comes
[1:27:14] back with a gag
[1:27:16] and and some of the sheep because
[1:27:19] him and the people decided that it would
[1:27:22] be
[1:27:22] good if we kept some of the best of the
[1:27:25] animals
[1:27:26] and what was what does it say vile and
[1:27:29] refused
[1:27:30] they destroyed utterly right right my
[1:27:34] question then is whose god are they
[1:27:36] listening to
[1:27:39] because the god that i read that's the
[1:27:41] god of this bible
[1:27:43] told him to destroy every bit of it
[1:27:45] right man
[1:27:46] well if god told him to destroy every
[1:27:48] bit of it don't you think
[1:27:50] every bit of it is violent refuse amen
[1:27:53] so who made the determination now that
[1:27:55] only this little select group was
[1:27:57] violent refused
[1:27:59] oh well only these over here are violent
[1:28:01] refused no every bit of us violent
[1:28:03] refused in the
[1:28:04] in the eyes of god and what other eyes
[1:28:07] matter
[1:28:08] saul's eyes didn't matter people's eyes
[1:28:10] didn't matter
[1:28:12] it did samuel the prophet of god there
[1:28:15] his didn't matter
[1:28:16] the only ones that mattered was god
[1:28:18] right god said
[1:28:20] every bit of us file and refuse kill it
[1:28:22] get rid of it amen
[1:28:24] then came the word of the lord unto
[1:28:26] samuel saying
[1:28:28] it repenteth me that i have set up saul
[1:28:30] to be king for he had turned
[1:28:31] back from following me and hath not
[1:28:34] performed my commandments
[1:28:35] and it grieved samuel and he cried unto
[1:28:38] the lord
[1:28:39] all night again the word of the lord
[1:28:43] came to samuel
[1:28:44] when samuel rose early to meet saul in
[1:28:47] the morning
[1:28:48] it was told samuel saying saul came to
[1:28:50] carmel
[1:28:51] and behold he set him up a place and has
[1:28:53] gone about
[1:28:55] and passed on and gone down to gilgal
[1:28:58] samuel came to saul saul said unto him
[1:29:01] blessed be thou of the lord listen to
[1:29:03] what saul says now
[1:29:06] blessed are the lord saul
[1:29:09] says i have performed the commandment of
[1:29:13] the lord
[1:29:15] can you see it's the same blindness that
[1:29:17] people live with today
[1:29:19] oh i've done what god said do
[1:29:22] well 99 of it 75
[1:29:26] of it whatever you wanted part of it you
[1:29:29] wanted to do
[1:29:30] whatever suited you yeah you did what
[1:29:33] suited you
[1:29:34] you you obeyed god's word to a point
[1:29:37] that you're like i don't want to do that
[1:29:40] well what good is that that's not
[1:29:41] obedience that's not
[1:29:43] incomplete obedience that is
[1:29:44] disobedience amen right
[1:29:47] but psalm is all mine is saying
[1:29:50] is telling the prophet of god and and
[1:29:53] saul knew samuel
[1:29:55] and god knew as saul knew that samuel
[1:29:58] had a direct communication with god
[1:30:00] almighty as the prophet of god
[1:30:02] right and yet he's standing in front of
[1:30:05] this man samuel
[1:30:07] and he's saying i have done or performed
[1:30:09] the commandment of the lord
[1:30:12] what's samuel's response samuel said
[1:30:14] well then what meaneth this bleeding of
[1:30:16] the sheep in my ears and the lowering of
[1:30:18] the oxen which i hear
[1:30:20] if you had done what god said dude these
[1:30:23] animals wouldn't be here
[1:30:25] right if you had done what god said do
[1:30:28] they would be
[1:30:28] dead in uh and with the amalekites and
[1:30:31] the rest of them that you killed right
[1:30:34] right so if you've done what god said do
[1:30:37] they wouldn't be
[1:30:37] here
[1:30:41] saul said they have they they
[1:30:44] passing the bug again they have brought
[1:30:46] from the amalekites for the people
[1:30:49] spared the best of the sheep and of the
[1:30:51] oxen to sacrifice now
[1:30:54] first of all i have done what god said
[1:30:57] do
[1:30:57] samuel says no you haven't sought these
[1:31:00] sheep and these oxen are still back here
[1:31:02] i hear them if you'd have done what god
[1:31:03] said

[1:31:15] uh passing off on somebody else but now
[1:31:18] he's saying
[1:31:19] we have the people have spared the best
[1:31:22] of the sheep and of the oxen
[1:31:24] to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and
[1:31:28] the rest we have utterly destroyed
[1:31:30] god didn't ask for those animals to be
[1:31:32] sacrificed to him
[1:31:34] if god had one of those animals to be
[1:31:36] sacrificed to him he would have asked
[1:31:38] you
[1:31:38] right yeah but he didn't ask you for
[1:31:40] them
[1:31:42] amen amen all the rest we have destroyed
[1:31:45] but first of all he says i've done it
[1:31:47] samuel says no you have
[1:31:49] he says well the people decided to
[1:31:51] because what we're going to do samuel
[1:31:53] oh the the the high and mighty holier
[1:31:57] than
[1:31:58] now pious saul we're gonna take these
[1:32:01] animals

[1:32:10] nostrils you're gonna take and give to
[1:32:11] him

[1:33:12] he would bring that stuff home every
[1:33:14] night i had to make it go to his room
[1:33:16] the smell of it made me nauseated i
[1:33:18] could not smell it
[1:33:20] you understand what i'm saying now this

[1:33:44] i'm going to do something that would
[1:33:45] honor you but i want to do it the way i
[1:33:47] want to do it
[1:33:49] well if you really want to do something
[1:33:50] that's going to be pleasing to the
[1:33:52] person you want to honor
[1:33:53] ask them what they want ask them what
[1:33:55] they want to do ask them where they want
[1:33:57] to go
[1:33:59] but saul didn't care the people said oh
[1:34:01] we thought we'd have these sheep and you
[1:34:03] know that that was just an excuse
[1:34:05] this for the shaving the sheep to
[1:34:07] sacrifice was just an excuse
[1:34:10] it was just a reason a scapegoat to try
[1:34:12] to get it
[1:34:13] doing what they should have been doing
[1:34:14] to begin with oh we saved the best for
[1:34:17] what
[1:34:18] there's nothing there that's the best oh
[1:34:20] brother newton
[1:34:21] we'll give you the best sushi there is

[1:34:28] no offense to anybody that loves sushi
[1:34:29] including my son
[1:34:31] nobody this uh now i can smell it now so
[1:34:34] i'm a little bit better
[1:34:35] but i hate it
[1:34:39] you understand yes that's what i'm
[1:34:41] talking about
[1:34:42] right blatant
[1:34:46] disobedience put him out of favor with
[1:34:49] god
[1:34:50] amen and god set him aside
[1:34:53] and put him apart and
[1:34:56] and samuel told him i'll have to skip
[1:34:58] down because my time's gone
[1:35:01] saul said unto samuel yeah i have obeyed
[1:35:03] the voice of the lord 20th verse now
[1:35:05] and have gone the way which the lord
[1:35:07] sent me and brought ag the king
[1:35:10] uh of the amalekites and have utterly
[1:35:13] destroyed the amalekites
[1:35:14] god said kill a gag
[1:35:18] samuel had to unsheath his
[1:35:21] saul's sword just to kill again to
[1:35:23] fulfill what god said to him
[1:35:30] and samuel said that the has the lord as
[1:35:33] great delight and burnt offerings and
[1:35:35] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[1:35:38] the lord
[1:35:39] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:35:41] and to hearken
[1:35:42] than the fat of rams rebellion is as the
[1:35:46] sin
[1:35:46] of witchcraft you talk about demonic

[1:36:05] people don't understand the kind of
[1:36:07] spirits they invite their homes and
[1:36:09] their lives and families
[1:36:10] right and these spirits that are real
[1:36:12] friends oh well i don't feel it i don't
[1:36:14] see any effects

[1:36:22] yes for the rebellion as the sin of
[1:36:24] witchcraft
[1:36:25] stubbornness iniquity of idolatry and
[1:36:27] that's exactly what saul did
[1:36:30] witchcraft is exactly what saul did yes
[1:36:33] is it not because right after this is
[1:36:36] when samuel died
[1:36:38] and saw had to go to the witch of vendor
[1:36:40] to get samuel to come up from the dead
[1:36:44] actually literally performing
[1:36:47] the act of witchcraft amen right right
[1:36:50] yeah the dead person came
[1:36:52] up but why to the act of
[1:36:55] spiritualism wickery demons
[1:37:00] and samuel came up and was still there
[1:37:02] told him why have you called me from my
[1:37:04] rest
[1:37:05] and he was still a prophet because he
[1:37:07] said you and your sons will be with me
[1:37:09] this time tomorrow
[1:37:11] prophesying right he said if the lord
[1:37:14] has turned you away
[1:37:15] what can i do about that amen
[1:37:19] for what disobedience and god gave saul
[1:37:22] chance after chance after chance
[1:37:26] just like in the garden of eden
[1:37:28] non-obedience
[1:37:29] has led to death many many times god
[1:37:32] help us
[1:37:33] amen i never want to be to that point
[1:37:37] but we got to live our lives we have to
[1:37:39] be what god called us
[1:37:41] and do what god called us to do amen let
[1:37:44] me see
[1:37:46] i've got a couple more scriptures i just
[1:37:47] want to read them real quick we'll close
[1:37:49] here
[1:37:50] um
[1:37:56] amen look what look what uh paul said
[1:37:59] in galatians the first chapter i'm just
[1:38:01] going to read it here galatians the
[1:38:03] first chapter
[1:38:05] um you can go back i was going to read
[1:38:06] from the sixth verse but for sake of
[1:38:08] time
[1:38:09] um let's start with the 11th verse but i
[1:38:13] certify you brother
[1:38:14] that the gospel which was priests of me
[1:38:16] is not after man
[1:38:19] for i neither received it of man neither
[1:38:21] was i taught it but by the revelation of
[1:38:24] jesus christ
[1:38:24] now we know that he said at the feet of
[1:38:26] gamalia we know he went
[1:38:28] met with peter after his eyes were open
[1:38:31] and
[1:38:32] it was with peter but look what he's
[1:38:34] saying
[1:38:35] he's saying a knowledge i gained
[1:38:38] yes but i only am in front of you today
[1:38:42] because of the revelation that jesus has
[1:38:45] given me
[1:38:48] amen amen i know i'm not on another
[1:38:51] man's revelation
[1:38:52] i'm not here to preach what another
[1:38:54] man's preached i'm not here to give you
[1:38:56] what somebody else says is truth
[1:38:58] i can only give you what god has given
[1:39:00] me is true
[1:39:02] revelation you do the same
[1:39:05] by the revelation of jesus christ
[1:39:09] for ye have heard of my conversation
[1:39:11] time passed the jewish religion how that
[1:39:13] i'm
[1:39:13] beyond measure i persecuted the church
[1:39:15] of god and wasted it
[1:39:16] profit in the jewish religion about
[1:39:18] above many my equals in my own nation
[1:39:21] being more exceedingly zealous of the
[1:39:23] traditions of my fathers
[1:39:25] but when it pleased god who separated me
[1:39:27] from my mother's womb and called me by
[1:39:28] his grace to reveal his son and me that
[1:39:31] i might preach him
[1:39:32] among the heathen immediately i
[1:39:35] conferred not with flesh and blood
[1:39:38] wasn't concerned with somebody else's
[1:39:40] thought or revelation
[1:39:41] i was only in revelation or concerned
[1:39:43] with the revelation that i got from the
[1:39:45] god that now lived in me
[1:39:47] the one who separated from me my me from
[1:39:49] my mother's womb
[1:39:50] that's the only one i'm concerned with
[1:39:52] that's the one i followed yes
[1:39:54] that's the one i live by now he told
[1:39:57] others
[1:39:57] paul told others follow me as i follow
[1:40:00] christ
[1:40:01] amen did he not follow me as i follow
[1:40:04] christ
[1:40:05] but that is that is living by the
[1:40:07] revelation of paul
[1:40:09] look let's just read this scripture here
[1:40:13] um
[1:40:16] i believe it's in revelation chapter 9
[1:40:18] or acts chapter 19 acts chapter 19
[1:40:22] here it is acts chapter 19. let's see
[1:40:24] there's people that tried to live by
[1:40:26] paul's revelation
[1:40:28] see what happened i i quote this many
[1:40:30] times
[1:40:31] in acts chapter 19 uh we'll begin with
[1:40:34] the 11th verse
[1:40:35] god wrought special miracles by the
[1:40:36] hands of paul
[1:40:38] so that from his body were brought for
[1:40:40] brought unto the
[1:40:41] sick handkerchiefs aprons diseases
[1:40:43] departed from them
[1:40:44] and the evil spirits went out of them i
[1:40:46] keep buying
[1:40:47] prayer cloths from brother i'm in this
[1:40:49] in this spot right here
[1:40:52] i keep it in this place right here then
[1:40:55] certain of the vagabond jews
[1:40:56] exorcist took upon them to call over
[1:40:59] them which had evil spirits the name of
[1:41:01] the lord jesus
[1:41:02] saying we adjourn you by jesus who paul
[1:41:05] preached
[1:41:06] now who's got the revelation right who's
[1:41:09] god is he listening to exactly and there
[1:41:12] were seven sons of one ski of a jew
[1:41:14] and chief priests which did so and the
[1:41:17] evil spirit answered and said
[1:41:19] jesus i know and paul i know but who are
[1:41:22] you
[1:41:24] he didn't recognize this man he
[1:41:27] recognized paul
[1:41:28] he recognized jesus by the life that was
[1:41:31] in them because this is
[1:41:32] spirit to spirit friend now it may have
[1:41:35] been in a human vessel that was standing
[1:41:37] in front of them
[1:41:38] but it was a spirit speaking out to that
[1:41:40] spirit and said
[1:41:41] i recognize the spirit of jesus christ
[1:41:43] god almighty
[1:41:44] the re and the same spirit that was in
[1:41:46] paul but i don't recognize that spirit
[1:41:48] in you
[1:41:50] and that spirit of that man jumped on
[1:41:53] this other man and he ran out of the
[1:41:55] house naked and wounded
[1:41:56] right because he was living off of
[1:41:58] paul's revelation
[1:42:00] he was living on what paul said he was
[1:42:03] living on the
[1:42:04] jesus whom paul preached you can't have
[1:42:07] a jesus just who paul preached
[1:42:09] or your parents or your pastor or
[1:42:11] anybody you've got to have your own
[1:42:13] revelation
[1:42:14] amen you don't go by just the god that
[1:42:17] somebody else is saying
[1:42:19] what is god speaking to you what is god
[1:42:22] telling you right brother brown
[1:42:26] god spoke to our former pastor brother
[1:42:28] greene one time
[1:42:30] and this very thing when he was getting
[1:42:32] ready to go out onto the
[1:42:33] mission field spoke to him and it's in
[1:42:36] acts 4.
[1:42:38] i'm just going to read a couple of
[1:42:39] verses i was going to start further up
[1:42:42] but um let's just start with a verse 18
[1:42:46] and they called him
[1:42:47] commanded not to speak at all teach in
[1:42:50] the name of jesus
[1:42:51] but peter and john answered and said
[1:42:53] unto them whether it be right in the
[1:42:54] sight of god to hearken unto you more
[1:42:56] than
[1:42:56] unto god judge ye for we cannot but
[1:43:00] speak the things which we have seen and
[1:43:01] heard
[1:43:02] right praise the lord we're only going
[1:43:05] to say
[1:43:06] what god gives us to say we're only
[1:43:08] going to live on the revelation that god
[1:43:10] gives us
[1:43:11] we're only going to go and say what god
[1:43:14] says
[1:43:15] and takes us that's all that matters
[1:43:18] we're not going to live by your dictates
[1:43:19] you tell us not to do this i'm sorry
[1:43:23] more pleasing to god and we want to be
[1:43:25] pleasing god
[1:43:26] amen amen we want to be pleasing to god
[1:43:30] and go where god sends us say what
[1:43:33] god tells us to say not vary from that
[1:43:36] word one iota but stay
[1:43:38] right on it amen regardless of the
[1:43:42] ridicule
[1:43:43] regardless of the the the shame or
[1:43:45] whatever somebody else may lay upon you
[1:43:47] or some name they may call you we talked
[1:43:49] about that a couple weeks ago friend
[1:43:51] right forget about all that amen
[1:43:54] probably harder for you young people no
[1:43:57] doubt
[1:43:58] it's hard growing up today in this world
[1:44:00] and the life and the
[1:44:02] things the way things are today be a
[1:44:04] christian confess a christian live like
[1:44:06] a christian look like a christian
[1:44:08] hard amen very hard but
[1:44:12] it was hard in our day not near as hard
[1:44:14] i think probably a
[1:44:16] million times harder now than it was
[1:44:18] then
[1:44:19] to live a christian life to be a godly
[1:44:22] person
[1:44:22] to let god rule you and live through you
[1:44:28] amen and can i i know some of your
[1:44:32] school age please don't when somebody
[1:44:35] tries to ask you or say something about
[1:44:37] why
[1:44:37] the way you look or please don't say
[1:44:39] it's my religion
[1:44:41] don't let it be religion right right man
[1:44:45] i lived this way and i look this way
[1:44:48] because it's pleasing to my lord jesus
[1:44:50] and that's
[1:44:50] it and that's all that matters it's
[1:44:53] pleasing to my lord
[1:44:55] and i want to be pleasing to my lord
[1:44:57] amen
[1:44:58] nothing on them people you don't look
[1:45:00] down on them you don't make them feel
[1:45:02] bad you don't
[1:45:03] post yourself up because of it but you
[1:45:05] just simply i just want to be pleasing
[1:45:07] to the lord jesus
[1:45:08] and i believe that my bible teaches me
[1:45:10] that this is what's pleasing to him
[1:45:12] so this is how i live this is what i do
