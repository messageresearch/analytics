[28:28] obeying your word they bring forth every
[28:33] excuse It's like your Prophet said it's

[29:14] selves is our greatest enemy and Lord we
[29:17] can do nothing in ourselves we can

[29:54] in the message that your prophet

[30:06] hitchhiker I can tell you have a genuine
[30:09] Spirit yes and father a hitchhiker he

[30:23] unsettling running from post to post not
[30:27] having a place of worship where they can
[30:29] stand and back up the the work of God
[30:33] and and stick with the pastor oh Lord

[34:32] Lord Jesus I'm happy about that amen so
[34:35] as a result uh I'm going to by hopefully
[34:39] maybe in the next month or so I'm going
[34:40] to ask Craig maybe if we can have a meal
[34:42] over there just like we did there that
[34:44] one time so we got a little we got some
[34:46] room over here next door so we'll see
[34:49] I'll talk to him about it he's kind of
[34:51] want me to do him a favor now with our
[34:53] nonprofit apparently there's U all those
[34:57] uh containers that they moved off the
[34:58] border that cost us millions of do
[35:01] taxpayer dollars and the government uh
[35:03] wanted us to move them whoever I don't
[35:06] know I I get lost in all that's just
[35:09] anyway so now they're having to sell all
[35:11] those 10 20,000 containers uh and with a
[35:16] nonprofit you can buy them without going
[35:18] to auction you can just buy them
[35:20] straight out they're like $2,000 a piece
[35:23] anybody wants one let me know if you
[35:24] want one on your property or something
[35:26] you need to have for storing stuff or
[35:28] something it's just like those regular
[35:30] containers that you get that they ship
[35:32] stuff in uh we put all our stuff in them
[35:35] on our job sites we call them aonics
[35:37] that we but they're very secure but
[35:39] anyway they're selling them for like
[35:41] 2,000 a piece uh to nonprofits and so
[35:45] Craig wants to buy some I think his son
[35:46] wants to buy some I think his son is
[35:49] looking at buying a couple of them and
[35:50] turning it into a house uh which a lot
[35:53] of people do there's a whole place down
[35:55] here off Congress there's a whole uh

[41:01] hallelujah amen thank you Jesus praise
[41:05] the Lord
[41:07] amen we want to go ahead and change the
[41:09] off the service now uh I meant to also
[41:12] make a announcement that um U that we
[41:17] had talked to had been had had had talk
[41:20] to Craig about the some of the smoking
[41:24] and stuff that goes around and the
[41:25] marijuana smell and stuff but they put
[41:28] out uh this memo I sent you a text of it
[41:32] uh a memo about the no smoking policy uh
[41:36] the only place that it is allowed to
[41:39] smoke and I know we don't but I'm just
[41:40] saying uh for future reference or if you
[41:43] see any anything let me know the only
[41:46] smoking they're supposed to be on this
[41:48] property is way back over here in this
[41:51] corner uh they have to supposed to go
[41:53] around the side of the building and down
[41:55] there's a there's a place right down
[41:57] there there's a metal container down
[41:59] there there's not supposed to be any
[42:02] smoking on the property in the buildings
[42:04] in the bathrooms uh there's anything
[42:07] done it's supposed to be in that back
[42:09] corner and whatever they smoke is
[42:11] supposed to be uh the residual whatever
[42:14] is supposed to be thrown in that metal
[42:16] container so um I say that so that if
[42:19] you notice anything different uh
[42:22] continuing last week was kind of a was
[42:25] uh sort of a an apex to it I guess a
[42:30] final straw if you will because I guess
[42:33] we different ones have smelted on and
[42:36] off uh in the bathroom and stuff but
[42:39] somebody was out with front over
[42:43] here U and it was so bad art and tried
[42:45] didn't want to take their kids out to
[42:47] bring them in church right away because
[42:48] of that and so anyway uh that that is
[42:52] the official stance every every tenant
[42:55] got one one of these so if you see
[42:57] anything at all let me know uh if you
[43:00] can I verify who maybe it's coming from
[43:03] what shop or what business I'll make
[43:06] sure and let Craig know because it is
[43:07] not supposed to be that way so just let
[43:10] everyone know amen so let's stand to our
[43:13] feet if we could now we're going to turn
[43:15] in our Bibles to Matthew chap 11 going
[43:18] to continue where we left off a couple
[43:20] of weeks ago Amen on the simple
[43:25] God
[43:26] and you'll pardon me for a minute I
[43:28] forgot my phone so the phone I record
[43:30] the messages on so Matthew
[43:55] 11:25
[44:07] it's not where it normally is I don't
[44:08] know what I did with it amen but it's
[44:11] being recorded in him so praise the Lord
[44:14] Matthew 11 verse
[44:17] 25 amen before we read the word we just
[44:20] bow our heads for another word of prayer

[45:39] would have this to be done God we rebuke
[45:41] every demonic spirit that would try to

[45:45] any way that you get the glory honor and
[45:48] praise for all that is said and done we
[45:50] thank you for it Lord we commit
[45:51] ourselves to you now ask these blessings
[45:54] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[45:56] pray amen amen Matthew 11:
[46:01] 25 at that time Jesus answered and said
[46:04] I thank thee uh oh Father Lord of Heaven
[46:07] and Earth because thou has hid these
[46:09] things from the wise and prudent and has
[46:11] revealed them unto babes praise the Lord
[46:14] you can be seated if You' like uh keep
[46:17] your Bibles there I got a few scriptures
[46:18] I want to go
[46:21] through that I want to read to begin off
[46:24] with amen but uh uh the first one's
[46:26] going to be in Isaiah Isaiah chapter
[46:31] 1 Isaiah chapter 1 want to speak today
[46:34] and continue on the thought that we've
[46:36] had uh this will be God in Simplicity
[46:39] part five uh God in Simplicity part five
[46:42] I want to speak on the
[46:44] foolishness amen talk about God being
[46:46] simple so simple it looks foolish to the
[46:49] world Amen and it's amazing how many
[46:51] things that especially in the New
[46:53] Testament it talks about the foolishness
[46:56] that man thinks is foolish but God uh uh
[46:59] lives in amen and dwells in and how he
[47:02] operates and acts and does looks foolish
[47:05] to the people of the world Amen so God
[47:08] and simplicity part five uh will speak
[47:11] on the topic of the subtopic of
[47:14] foolishness now Isaiah chapter 1 I want
[47:17] to read two verses of scripture uh 19
[47:20] and 20 Isaiah 1 19 and 20 amen if ye be
[47:25] with willing and obedient ye shall eat
[47:29] the good of the land but if you refuse
[47:31] and rebel you shall be devoured with the
[47:34] sword for the mouth of the Lord ha
[47:38] spoken it amen you shall be devoured
[47:41] with the sword for the mouth of the Lord
[47:45] has spoken it now let's go over to
[47:48] Revelation I got a couple places in
[47:50] Revelation I want to read beginning with
[47:52] verse uh chapter
[47:54] 19 Revelation
[47:59] 19 amen Revelation
[48:02] 19:15 give you a minute to find it there
[48:05] Revelation
[48:09] 1915 amen Revelation 19:15 says and out
[48:13] of his mouth goeth a sharp
[48:17] sword that with it he should Smite the
[48:21] Nations and shall rule them with a rod
[48:23] of iron and he treaded the wine press
[48:26] the fierceness the wrath of almighty God
[48:28] out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword
[48:33] amen over Revelation one
[48:36] now Revelation one I got one verse of
[48:39] scripture I want to read
[48:42] there Revelation
[48:45] 116 amen Revelation
[48:48] 116 and he had in his right hand Seven
[48:51] Stars and out of his mouth when a sharp
[48:55] two EDG sword and his countenance was as
[48:58] the sun shineth in his strength I think
[49:01] we kind of get in the pattern here
[49:03] through throughout the scripture of out
[49:07] of God's mouth cometh sword two-edged
[49:11] sword because it's a two-edged sword for
[49:13] cutting coming and going amen no wasted
[49:16] motion with God it's a two-edged sword
[49:19] coming and going out of God's mouth
[49:21] goeth this two-edged sword now to pick
[49:24] up our subject now I want to go to First
[49:27] Corinthians uh chapter
[49:30] 1 amen 1 Corinthians chapter
[49:34] 1 I want to take this scripture to pick
[49:37] up our subject and we will as we've read
[49:40] these other scriptures they were just
[49:41] for the laying down of the foundation
[49:44] that we will obviously be speaking on
[49:47] and uh getting to through the scripture
[49:49] First Corinthians hopefully this will
[49:52] kind of tie it together there's there's
[49:54] other scripture uh that we did not read
[49:57] second Thessalonians it talks about the
[49:59] sword that goes out and destroys them is
[50:02] the sword of God it's the same the same
[50:05] thing that gives light to us is Darkness
[50:09] to the world to the unbeliever to those
[50:12] that will not believe or the foolish as
[50:14] the Bible says amen and that's the word
[50:16] of God Amen what comes out of God's
[50:18] mouth is the word of God praise the lord
[50:22] it's just uh spoken of of course through
[50:25] the scripture as the sword that comes
[50:27] forth the sword that devours amen now
[50:31] look uh 1
[50:33] Corinthians chapter 1 we're going to
[50:35] begin reading with verse 17 1
[50:38] Corinthians 1:17 for Christ sent me not
[50:41] to baptize but to preach the gospel amen
[50:46] preach the gospel the gospel is what the
[50:49] good news the good news of what the word
[50:51] of God yes amen God sent me not to
[50:54] baptize
[50:56] but to preach the gospel not with wisdom
[50:59] of words lest the Cross of Christ should
[51:02] be made of none effect for the preaching
[51:05] of the cross the preaching of the Cross
[51:07] is to them that perish foolishness
[51:10] foolishness which is our subtitle today
[51:13] to them that perish the preaching of the
[51:16] Cross is foolishness the preaching of
[51:19] the word is foolishness that's that
[51:22] seems outstanding considering that
[51:26] the christiandom
[51:27] world most go by the word they they say
[51:32] anyway they Proclaim that this word is
[51:35] what they live by it's what they go by
[51:38] what they preach is the word of God but
[51:41] the preaching of the Cross is to them
[51:43] that perish
[51:45] foolishness but unto us which are saved
[51:48] it is the power of God so you notice
[51:51] again the very thing that gives life to
[51:53] those that believe is the very thing
[51:55] that brings death to those that do not
[51:58] right amen those that do not believe
[52:00] they consider it foolishness to the
[52:03] world we are foolish we are we we the
[52:07] way we act the way we live is
[52:09] foolishness to the world they don't
[52:12] understand a lot of times why we do the
[52:14] things that we do why we act the way we
[52:16] do why we don't do certain things why we
[52:18] don't live certain ways why we don't say
[52:21] certain things why we don't eat or drink
[52:24] certain things amen they call that
[52:27] foolishness I think I told you one time
[52:30] uh the the the the guy that was the
[52:33] Cragin on our job that's a good friend
[52:35] and all now he he told me one time he
[52:37] said I never met a preacher that or a
[52:40] minister that didn't drink right that's
[52:42] what we have
[52:43] now that's what he told me now how many
[52:46] he's ever met in his life I don't know
[52:48] he didn't divulge the number but he said
[52:50] I never I never met a preacher didn't
[52:52] drink amen so to to to them it's
[52:56] foolishness Amen to us it's
[52:58] righteousness to us it's Godly to us
[53:01] it's a way of life to us it's what we do
[53:04] because we want to live a life according
[53:06] to God's word and in pleasing to him and
[53:09] to us it becomes a desire it becomes a
[53:13] desire to those that are filled with the
[53:14] spirit to want to live that way to want
[53:17] to be like that and the thing that
[53:19] they're called Holy Roller foolish uh
[53:21] what nuts whatever they may call us it
[53:24] it it it becomes to us as a badge of
[53:26] honor honestly does to me anyway I
[53:30] consider it a privilege to to be talked
[53:32] about to be made fun of now he wasn't
[53:34] saying that to make fun of me I I think
[53:37] he actually was saying it to make fun of
[53:39] them the ones that the ministers that
[53:42] drink I think he's he was actually
[53:44] telling me that because it it was kind
[53:47] of like building me up to the place that
[53:50] uh you live a life I've never seen any
[53:52] other preacher live before right that
[53:54] was kind of what I got got out of it but
[53:56] it's a badge of honor that we take that
[53:58] that we would be called that but to the
[54:00] world it's foolishness but to us it's
[54:03] righteousness to us it's life to us it's
[54:06] everything amen and we hold it as such
[54:09] because it's in our heart to be so Amen
[54:13] to the world to them that perish it's
[54:15] foolishness but us but unto us which are
[54:18] saved it is the power of God the very
[54:21] same vehicle amen the very same vehic
[54:25] vehicle that saves us destroys those
[54:29] that don't believe those that refuse to
[54:32] believe those that cannot believe those
[54:34] that perish amen 19th verse now for it
[54:40] is written I will destroy the wisdom of
[54:44] the wise and will bring to nothing the
[54:47] understanding of The
[54:49] Prudent where is the wise again if
[54:52] there's any more of scripture of God
[54:54] living and revealing himself in
[54:57] Simplicity God being a simple god making
[55:01] himself simple we'll say to us
[55:05] amen this is it I will destroy the
[55:09] wisdom of the wise and will'll bring to
[55:11] nothing the understanding of The Prudent
[55:13] where is the wise where is the Scribe
[55:17] where is the disputer of the world hath
[55:20] not God made foolish the wisdom of the
[55:24] of this world
[55:26] absolutely yes others look on it and
[55:28] think it's something outstanding others
[55:31] look on it and think that's such a
[55:32] wonderful thing I and I'll put it like
[55:36] this uh uh brother bandam talked about
[55:41] television and he said television could
[55:44] have been one of the greatest inventions
[55:46] man has ever known right but it became a
[55:48] curse I'll say the same thing to these
[55:51] cell phones to the internet to social
[55:54] social media all those things those
[55:56] things all be could be absolutely
[55:58] wonderful great things but people have
[56:01] absolutely ruined them serpent seed has
[56:04] taken the inventions of those things
[56:06] that could really be a help and a
[56:08] blessing and brought them to be a curse
[56:11] yes you look at it today and all that
[56:13] has become a curse amen I I've gone uh
[56:17] places like when I went to uh I I
[56:20] usually often always carry my Bible with
[56:22] me uh I go to church and all but um uh
[56:27] when I went to Brother Rogers to his
[56:28] service there I didn't have my Bible
[56:30] with me so I used my phone it was a
[56:31] blessing I have my phone to be able to
[56:34] follow in the scriptures amen I I feel
[56:36] kind of funny having my phone out in the
[56:38] middle of church but I trust he knew
[56:41] what I was doing I was not uh looking up
[56:44] the news I was following along in
[56:46] scripture see it's a blessing that way
[56:48] it's something that can be good to us a
[56:50] lot of times nowadays if I listen to the
[56:52] message I'll listen to it on my phone
[56:54] yeah yeah amen most of the time
[56:56] sometimes on my tablet but usually on my
[56:58] phone I listen to the message it's it
[57:00] becomes a great blessing that way but
[57:02] how much other things of Filth and
[57:05] garbage and and betrayal and I mean it
[57:08] just it's just a huge whole world of
[57:11] nothing but of garbage and filth that's
[57:14] just destroying people's lives could be
[57:17] a blessing is not God takes the wisdom
[57:21] of the world not godly wisdom but the
[57:25] wisdom of the world and made it foolish
[57:27] to us we look at it and say how foolish
[57:31] that was why would somebody do that
[57:34] others look at it and think oh that's a
[57:36] great thing it's like uh uh I've seen
[57:39] I've gone in h stores or restaurants and
[57:42] uh uh behind the counter or or a waiter
[57:45] waitress that have you know tattoos all

[57:54] what's that of and they're explaining it
[57:56] and they're going all this I'm thinking

[58:00] ugly that
[58:01] is I don't care how perfect a a design
[58:06] or or Artistry that just looks
[58:08] absolutely hideous to me I told my wife
[58:11] the other day I said for brother
[58:13] brandham uh because I guess I don't see
[58:15] it as much anymore for brother brandham
[58:17] it was a woman smoking a cigarette you
[58:20] remember brother Brown talked about
[58:21] seeing a woman smoking a cigarette was
[58:23] the most degradable thing thing You'
[58:25] never seen well it's the tattoos to me I
[58:28] see a especially a woman I see woman
[58:30] with tattoos on them like that it just
[58:33] it just I just grips my I don't know how
[58:35] to say it just tears me up I know they
[58:38] don't know better and and I know if God
[58:41] got it got a hold of their heart that
[58:43] change and you know and all that but it
[58:45] just it's just they look at it and think
[58:47] oh that's beautiful that's Artistry
[58:49] that's that's in membrance of my husband
[58:51] or my parents or whatever and it's a
[58:54] memorial or something I think it's like
[58:56] putting a bumper sticker on a
[58:58] Rolls-Royce that's that's my opinion of
[59:01] it but and then but the world looks and
[59:03] oh that's so beautiful it looked hideous
[59:05] to me Amen to those that believe now
[59:09] that is just nothing more than an
[59:11] example of what the scripture is telling
[59:12] us God where is the wise where is the
[59:15] Scribe thep Of The World God had made
[59:17] the foolish had made foolish the wisdom
[59:20] of the world Amen the wisdom of the
[59:23] world looks foolish to us for after that
[59:26] in the wisdom of God 21st verse
[59:29] now for after that in the wisdom of God
[59:32] the World by wisdom knew not God it
[59:35] pleased God by the foolishness of
[59:38] preaching to save them that believe
[59:41] praise the Lord through the foolishness
[59:43] of preaching through the foolishness of
[59:46] what the sword that cometh out of his
[59:48] mouth amen the word that cometh out of
[59:52] his mouth what is it that's any
[59:54] different Saints if that exact same word
[59:57] comes out of your mouth today to the
[1:00:00] world it's foolishness but to them to
[1:00:03] believe it is salvation Amen to to
[1:00:06] preach the gospel and whatever now I
[1:00:08] know is talking about an audible
[1:00:10] Ministry I know it's talk about a uh uh
[1:00:13] Paul preaching and those that are
[1:00:15] ministers that are God Called to preach
[1:00:18] the word to stand behind a pull pit or
[1:00:19] whatever it is but Saints I want to tell
[1:00:21] you today it is as much your life as it
[1:00:24] is anybody that stands behind this P pit
[1:00:27] your life that ministers to the world is
[1:00:29] is valuable because you are living
[1:00:33] written Epistles read of all men right
[1:00:36] that the world sees the sword that comes
[1:00:39] out of God's mouth is the word that you
[1:00:42] live and your living and your breathing
[1:00:44] and your speaking it's the word of God
[1:00:47] the literal sword if you will that comes
[1:00:50] out of God's mouth that preaches to the
[1:00:52] rest of the world it's God ministering
[1:00:56] it's you God ministering through you the
[1:01:00] foolishness of preaching to save them
[1:01:02] that believe what we're doing this
[1:01:05] morning to a lot of the world is
[1:01:06] considered
[1:01:07] foolishness why would you come and do
[1:01:09] this why would you come and give your
[1:01:11] time why would you broadcast this why
[1:01:13] would you spend your time why would you
[1:01:15] spend your efforts and all that you do
[1:01:17] to to keep this church going to make
[1:01:20] this a place where people can come and
[1:01:22] get out of the world it's foolishness to
[1:01:24] the world world yes preaching the gospel
[1:01:27] oh he hasn't said anything to me oh
[1:01:29] that's just a a a something to try to
[1:01:32] get you to to to be scared they're just
[1:01:36] trying to control you by fear no just
[1:01:38] trying to preach the gospel amen amen
[1:01:41] just trying to preach the word and if
[1:01:42] it's in this word it's the word of God
[1:01:46] that's coming out of mouth the the mouth
[1:01:48] of God now what did Isaiah say he said
[1:01:51] to those that would believe and obey
[1:01:54] they shall be blessed by this sword by
[1:01:56] this word those that disbelieve and
[1:01:59] disobey will be destroyed or consumed by
[1:02:03] this sword amen so you believe obey
[1:02:09] praise the Lord it is life to you the
[1:02:12] preaching of the Gospel is life it saves
[1:02:16] those that will believe 22nd verse for
[1:02:19] the Jews require a sign the Greeks seek
[1:02:21] after wisdom but we preach Christ CHR
[1:02:24] crucified unto the Jews a stumbling
[1:02:27] block and unto the Greeks foolishness
[1:02:30] foolishness the Simplicity of Christ has
[1:02:33] always looked foolish to people it
[1:02:35] looked foolish when he was here the
[1:02:37] Simplicity of Christ and his message has
[1:02:40] always look like foolishness to man man
[1:02:43] always has looked upon that to think
[1:02:45] that that was uh that how foolish that
[1:02:48] is but a true man of God a true minister
[1:02:52] of God will preach the word every every
[1:02:54] time not his own ideas not something
[1:02:57] from some Seminary he'll preach the word
[1:03:00] of God and the true pure unadulterated
[1:03:02] word of God is what is what he'll say
[1:03:05] only what he'll say 24th verse but unto
[1:03:09] them which are called both Jews and
[1:03:12] Greeks Christ the power of God and the
[1:03:15] wisdom of God to those who are what
[1:03:19] called Praise the Lord those that are
[1:03:21] called because the foolishness of God is
[1:03:25] wiser than men and the weakness of God
[1:03:29] is stronger than men foolishness of God
[1:03:33] is wiser amen the weakness of God is
[1:03:38] stronger than man for ye see your
[1:03:40] calling Brethren how that not many wise
[1:03:43] uh wise men after the flesh not many
[1:03:45] mighty not many noble are called but God
[1:03:48] ha chosen praise the Lord Jesus amen
[1:03:52] amen it doesn't get any more so than me
[1:03:55] so thank God for that God had chosen the
[1:03:58] foolish things of the world to confound
[1:04:02] the wise and God had chosen the weak
[1:04:05] things of the world to confound the
[1:04:07] things which are Mighty I was talking to
[1:04:09] my crew the other day I forgot how it
[1:04:11] came up but they were talking about
[1:04:13] being baptized and and one of them said
[1:04:16] they had been baptized of course in the
[1:04:17] Catholic church when they were a little
[1:04:18] kid and then they're supposed to be
[1:04:20] confirmed I didn't even know what all
[1:04:21] that was but I guess when you get 18 or
[1:04:23] something you got to be confirm then I I
[1:04:26] don't know which is water what makes a
[1:04:28] difference but they sprinkle you when
[1:04:30] you're a baby so that saves you in case
[1:04:31] you die as a baby uh and I got to talk
[1:04:34] to him and I said well I said do you
[1:04:36] really think God is so mean now I'm
[1:04:38] probably paraphrasing us thing said
[1:04:40] exactly like this I said you think God
[1:04:42] is so mean that he would send a little
[1:04:45] child that doesn't know right from wrong
[1:04:47] good or bad to hell if they die before
[1:04:50] they understand these things and none of
[1:04:53] them knew what to say
[1:04:54] hallelujah
[1:04:56] amen something is so simple you you
[1:05:00] would think that it would be grasp by
[1:05:03] the most nominal Christian to think why
[1:05:06] would God judge a child who's not been
[1:05:10] sprinkled judge a child to hell if they
[1:05:13] die before that point in their life he
[1:05:15] is such a mean and wrathful vengeful God
[1:05:19] he would send a child like that to burn
[1:05:21] in hell and they didn't even know right
[1:05:22] for wrong yeah
[1:05:26] I it seems simple to me but see when you
[1:05:30] give that to people they don't
[1:05:32] understand that well well we do it just
[1:05:34] in case just in case
[1:05:36] what I I I that where where we started
[1:05:39] our church they baptize babies I talked
[1:05:41] to them about it so why do y'all do that
[1:05:44] they had a little PL pamphlet that
[1:05:45] explained it I read kind of part of the
[1:05:47] pamphlet it's like well it's better to
[1:05:49] be safe and sorry I said what kind of
[1:05:51] faith is there in that right right I I I
[1:05:54] I'd rather not take the chance chance of
[1:05:56] what disbelieving God's word it just
[1:05:59] didn't make any sense see they grasp at
[1:06:02] things they know not of but when you
[1:06:04] bring them a simple gospel they they
[1:06:07] they don't grasp the understanding so
[1:06:09] well that makes sense but but I'd rather
[1:06:12] be safe and
[1:06:13] sorry yeah it's just it's just a sad
[1:06:16] state that people got to but that's the
[1:06:18] wisdom of the world versus the
[1:06:21] foolishness of God to think how how
[1:06:24] simple it is that if a child dies before
[1:06:27] getting to that age all babies go to
[1:06:29] heaven that's pretty simple am God is
[1:06:32] not going to judge a child and they
[1:06:34] might not be
[1:06:36] predestinated they might not be uh a
[1:06:39] bride right but they God's not going to
[1:06:41] send them to hell right they'll they'll
[1:06:43] be granted life they may be bride maybe
[1:06:46] not they be be on the outside workers
[1:06:48] outside the city I don't know that's up
[1:06:50] to God to sort out but they don't go to
[1:06:52] hell right I mean it was something that
[1:06:55] simple that that would that would
[1:06:57] confound
[1:06:59] their
[1:07:01] their only foundation of Christianity
[1:07:03] really is
[1:07:05] Catholicism uh that's all they knew and
[1:07:07] and that's that's what they go by and
[1:07:09] then confirm when you're 18 I anyway it
[1:07:12] it was just it was I I cut the
[1:07:15] discussion a little short but they did
[1:07:18] just didn't know what to say you get to
[1:07:21] the place where you you bring a simp of
[1:07:24] God's word and it confounds people
[1:07:28] because they hadn't been taught that
[1:07:30] they have never heard that but when they
[1:07:33] listen to it it makes sense if they
[1:07:36] haven't been overly clouded with all of
[1:07:38] the Dogma that comes from a church or an
[1:07:41] organization or a preacher they haven't
[1:07:43] been clouded with all that they can look
[1:07:44] at it and say that that is simple that
[1:07:47] makes sense to me it's like we were
[1:07:49] talking last week and I implored
[1:07:52] you let let's don't take something that
[1:07:55] we see like that and say okay this is
[1:07:58] absolutely th that you know uh I've been
[1:08:01] through that in 30 years of Ministry for
[1:08:04] people had come forth and they said oh c
[1:08:06] th this is it this is that this is that
[1:08:09] one you know from the Bill Clinton and
[1:08:13] and Y2K and uh the red heers and the
[1:08:16] stars and all the things I've heard so
[1:08:19] much of it friend and people say well
[1:08:21] this is it this has got to be it to the
[1:08:23] point that some people just have
[1:08:25] actually said on this exact date in
[1:08:30] complete contrast to the scripture right
[1:08:33] this exact day this is the day that the
[1:08:35] that the Rapture is going to take place
[1:08:38] doesn't happen right yeah there's no
[1:08:40] repentance there's no I'm sorry there's
[1:08:43] no I was wrong it's just move on to the
[1:08:46] next day whatever that is right and it's
[1:08:49] just a sad thing Saints my thing is just
[1:08:52] the Simplicity of God let God unfold it
[1:08:54] the way he is in his mind he's got this
[1:08:57] picture all perfect laid out it's
[1:08:58] unfolding the way he wants it to just
[1:09:01] let him do it the way he wants to do it
[1:09:03] and just be a good humble simple
[1:09:04] Christian live a good humble simple life
[1:09:07] live a righteous Godly life before the
[1:09:09] Lord and before your a fellow man and
[1:09:11] let God sort all the rest out god'll
[1:09:14] bring it to pass now I know Israel's are
[1:09:16] time pieace and we talked about that
[1:09:17] last week we know that we can look and
[1:09:19] feel the pull that's coming in our
[1:09:21] hearts that we can't be much longer amen
[1:09:24] but we don't know for sure this is that
[1:09:28] Hillary Clinton and and now Camala
[1:09:30] Harris and whatever it is I don't know
[1:09:33] maybe it may be I don't know uh we we
[1:09:38] make again I hate to get back on this
[1:09:42] but people make it a thing that that
[1:09:45] they that they this has got to be this
[1:09:48] woman it's got to be the president god
[1:09:50] brother Brandon never said that right
[1:09:52] right they they they start they get so
[1:09:55] consumed with this that they start
[1:09:57] adding details onto the actual uh
[1:10:01] message onto the actual prophecy or onto
[1:10:03] the actual exhortation brother Bram was
[1:10:06] giving and they start adding things
[1:10:08] brother Bram never said this woman was
[1:10:09] going to be present he just said a
[1:10:11] powerful woman was going to rise up in a
[1:10:14] powerful position he even said it could
[1:10:17] be the Catholic
[1:10:19] church
[1:10:21] right so we make things out of something
[1:10:24] that's not there amen and we run off on
[1:10:27] a tangent on and you end out on a limb
[1:10:29] somewhere and God's moving on Amen
[1:10:33] praise the
[1:10:34] Lord let let me read this again 27th
[1:10:38] verse but God ha chosen God had chosen
[1:10:42] the foolish things of the world to
[1:10:45] confound the wise and God had chosen the
[1:10:48] weak things of the world to confound the
[1:10:52] things which are Mighty in of course not
[1:10:56] in in the world Mighty in the world and
[1:10:59] base things of the world and things that
[1:11:01] are despised ha God chosen yay and
[1:11:05] things which are not to bring to not
[1:11:07] things that are that no flesh should
[1:11:11] glory in his in in his presence but of
[1:11:13] him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is
[1:11:17] made unto us wisdom and righteousness
[1:11:20] and sanctification and Redemption that
[1:11:22] according as it is written he that
[1:11:25] glorieth let him glory in the Lord amen
[1:11:28] in the Lord It's foolishness to man but
[1:11:31] we believe it we believe it we know it's
[1:11:35] the truth yes unfortunately it seems
[1:11:38] like that in general not I don't throw
[1:11:41] everybody into this pot but in general
[1:11:43] it seems like most people are drawn to a
[1:11:46] personality instead of to the word
[1:11:49] they're drawn to a great oror someone
[1:11:52] who looks good or something like that
[1:11:54] instead of the word of God in general
[1:11:56] and unfortunately that's not where God
[1:11:59] is now a person I'm not saying a person
[1:12:02] uh can't preach the word and have a good
[1:12:04] personality I'm not saying somebody
[1:12:06] can't preach the pure word and be a good
[1:12:08] orator amen but you don't draw to a
[1:12:11] personality you draw to the word amen I
[1:12:15] don't I I believe I trust and I pray and
[1:12:18] I believe my family's not here because
[1:12:20] I'm the pastor right I believe they're
[1:12:23] here because because they believe that I
[1:12:24] preach the word and this is where God
[1:12:26] has sent
[1:12:27] them amen not because I actually had
[1:12:29] brother Potter one time of Reuben he
[1:12:32] come and he admonished me he said I
[1:12:35] appreciate your I believe it was him he
[1:12:36] said I appreciate your stand uh and
[1:12:39] letting your dog cuz my cuz when Tabitha
[1:12:41] was going to church after I started the
[1:12:43] church over here on Coro she kept going
[1:12:45] to Brother Martin stro right and I told
[1:12:47] her you go where God tells you to go I
[1:12:49] didn't make her stop and leave I didn't
[1:12:51] make her feel ashamed or something that
[1:12:53] she she needed to come over here because
[1:12:54] I'm her daddy no she goes where she
[1:12:57] feels led to go she goes where God sent
[1:12:59] here she goes where she feels that the
[1:13:01] Lord's feeding her right amen and I and
[1:13:04] I trust and believe that should be the
[1:13:05] same way with everybody not a
[1:13:07] personality not cause they're my family
[1:13:10] not because of this I've heard a lot of
[1:13:11] that happen Saints but you go where God
[1:13:13] tells you to go and God will bless you
[1:13:16] amen God will feeds you with the word
[1:13:18] not because of a great personality or
[1:13:20] great oror or because I'm a little more
[1:13:22] energized because I'm a little more
[1:13:24] happy or because I'm a little more uh
[1:13:26] vocal and and and and and physical with
[1:13:30] it all no because the word's being
[1:13:32] preached the bottom line is youve take
[1:13:35] away all the other stuff that's the only
[1:13:37] thing that matters amen I know sometimes
[1:13:41] uh my voice gets a little exuberant I
[1:13:43] don't intend it to be that way I really
[1:13:46] don't it just something that gets in my
[1:13:48] heart and when it comes out that's just
[1:13:50] the way it comes out uh my wife tells me
[1:13:53] sometimes you got you're you're too loud
[1:13:55] sometimes I say I can't help it I'm
[1:13:57] sorry you get up there and preach and
[1:13:58] see how you feel let the Holy Spirit and
[1:14:01] anointing get you and see what happens
[1:14:02] to you right amen when it comes that way
[1:14:05] Saints sometimes you just can't sit
[1:14:07] still sometimes you got to get up
[1:14:09] sometimes you got to throw your hand
[1:14:11] sometimes you got to get loud sometimes
[1:14:13] you speak in Tong sometimes you
[1:14:15] clap amen but it's the power of God it's
[1:14:18] not us doing it it's God doing it and
[1:14:21] when you let him do it it flows and
[1:14:22] everything works just perfect the way
[1:14:24] God intended it amen God has a purpose
[1:14:28] God has a plan you've heard brother
[1:14:29] Pat's testimony I think he's told it
[1:14:32] here before when he was at the
[1:14:33] Tabernacle one time and the Lord moved
[1:14:35] on him and said get up and run around
[1:14:37] the the the pews and he just sat there
[1:14:40] and himself he wasn't going to do it
[1:14:42] amen and he said the guy right next to
[1:14:44] him a couple minutes later the guy right
[1:14:46] next to him got up jumped around went
[1:14:49] and run around the pews
[1:14:51] Hallelujah brother Pat refused to do it
[1:14:53] so God moved on to the next guy that
[1:14:56] would amen and he did now what purpose
[1:14:59] served I don't know that's not me to
[1:15:02] that's not me to understand why did why
[1:15:05] was it what was the point I don't know
[1:15:07] but God whatever God tells you to do you
[1:15:10] do it amen the best you build it's not
[1:15:12] out of order amen praise the Lord but we
[1:15:16] do it according to what the spirit of
[1:15:17] God is moving on us to do it looks like
[1:15:19] foolishness to the world sometimes I've
[1:15:21] seen people look around and SN
[1:15:24] can't be foolishness to to God's people
[1:15:26] if it's God doing it amen let's look at
[1:15:29] this the world falling apart I isn't
[1:15:32] that the truth am prophetic message uh
[1:15:36] world falling apart he he preaches this
[1:15:38] a few times I believe this one's in New
[1:15:41] York New York
[1:15:43] 1963 that's the way it was at the
[1:15:46] beginning the very thing started the
[1:15:48] whole system of sin was because somebody
[1:15:51] Eve Satan produced a better plan than
[1:15:55] God's he produced wisdom they eat from
[1:15:59] the Tree of knowledge you know brother
[1:16:01] Ram says another place she went looking
[1:16:04] for wisdom what have we said before you
[1:16:07] go looking for something friend I
[1:16:08] guarantee you'll find it and you might
[1:16:11] find it in the devil in his playhouse
[1:16:13] but you'll find it right amen because it
[1:16:15] might not be the word it might not be
[1:16:17] God's will that's right amen but if you
[1:16:20] want to you go looking you'll find it oh
[1:16:23] oh well I'd rather not dress this way
[1:16:25] well if you go far enough you're going
[1:16:27] to find a place to where you dress the
[1:16:29] way you want to well I don't I don't
[1:16:32] really want to uh act like this or do
[1:16:34] well you just go far enough you keep
[1:16:36] hunting you're going to find a place
[1:16:37] that tells you oh you don't have to do
[1:16:39] that oh you don't have to go there oh
[1:16:42] you don't have to act like that you go
[1:16:44] far you'll find it amen and you say oh
[1:16:47] well there it is that's that's that's
[1:16:48] exactly what I've said this whole time
[1:16:50] and God's trying to feed you the word
[1:16:52] and blind you do it amen looking eating
[1:16:56] as he said from the Tree of knowledge
[1:16:59] wisdom always takes you away from God
[1:17:02] faith brings you back to God you don't
[1:17:05] know God by your great wisdom no that is
[1:17:09] of the world it's foolishness to God but
[1:17:13] it pleased God through the foolishness
[1:17:15] of preaching the word the sword coming
[1:17:17] out of God's mouth it's a sword
[1:17:21] regardless amen who is the mouthpiece of
[1:17:23] God
[1:17:24] today it's not me I'm a part of it it's
[1:17:28] his bride that's right amen out of you
[1:17:31] comes a short sord now obviously there's
[1:17:34] an office that's held here that that's
[1:17:37] in that esteem as well that preaches the
[1:17:39] word amen that falls in that category uh
[1:17:44] probably in a in a greater light because
[1:17:46] of the calling but God's called us
[1:17:49] all but his foolishness to the world
[1:17:53] the world looks at you especially
[1:17:55] sisters
[1:17:56] going through the mall or whatever looks
[1:18:00] foolish but it's God right brother Pat
[1:18:03] was talking to us was talking we had we
[1:18:06] had lunch Thursday and he saw some
[1:18:09] program or something that uh that they
[1:18:13] put out a question to a group of people
[1:18:15] whatever it was and and and asked and
[1:18:18] put a picture said and ask and had this
[1:18:21] woman with their hair all cut off and
[1:18:22] probably shorter than Zach's or maybe
[1:18:24] even mic's I don't know but uh put it
[1:18:27] out said is this appropriate for a
[1:18:31] haircut for a woman over 60 and a lot of
[1:18:34] people look at that oh that's absolutely
[1:18:36] low maintenance don't have to mess with
[1:18:38] it now
[1:18:40] I I think when I look at that and I say
[1:18:44] that's that's the attitude of of
[1:18:47] unbelievers yes period but when I look
[1:18:51] at it and I see the sisters and I I know
[1:18:53] what my wife went through and especially
[1:18:56] early uh that's a whole another story my
[1:18:59] wife had long beautiful thick hair and
[1:19:02] then through menopausal and her
[1:19:05] hair my wife has took such pride in her
[1:19:09] hair and trying to strengthen it and
[1:19:12] trying to make it grow and trying to get
[1:19:14] it thicker and trying to make it look
[1:19:16] better you know a lot of people just
[1:19:18] well just shave it all off that's what
[1:19:20] the world say looks foolish
[1:19:23] when the world looks and says is this
[1:19:25] appropriate a Christian looks and says I
[1:19:28] got to do I want to do everything I can
[1:19:30] to make it as beautiful as long as thick
[1:19:33] as as I possibly can your glory to the
[1:19:37] Lord amen amen is't that right your
[1:19:41] glory to the Lord your glory your your
[1:19:44] your honoring of your head yes and a
[1:19:47] Christian says I want to make it as
[1:19:49] pretty and as beautiful and as thick and
[1:19:51] as long and and and the world's out
[1:19:54] there saying what excuse can I have to
[1:19:56] cut this mop off yeah that's what the
[1:19:59] world's saying but a Christian doesn't
[1:20:01] act that way and it looks foolish when
[1:20:04] you go out there and you see the rest
[1:20:06] and what it is with these women nowadays
[1:20:08] I don't understand are completely
[1:20:10] shaving their heads of course that's
[1:20:11] scripture the Bible says you might as
[1:20:13] well be shaven if you're just going to
[1:20:14] cut it at all so I guess they're just
[1:20:16] fulfilling scripture but baldheaded
[1:20:18] women
[1:20:20] it
[1:20:21] uh how many times in my young 57y old
[1:20:26] life am I going to say never did I ever
[1:20:28] imagine I would ever see something like
[1:20:31] this it's happening almost daily anymore
[1:20:33] Saints it's happening now through the
[1:20:37] foolishness of the preaching of the word
[1:20:40] amen the foolishness to the world is
[1:20:43] through foolishness the preaching of the
[1:20:45] world uh of his word but it's to save
[1:20:49] the
[1:20:50] Lost Amen to save the L lost praise God
[1:20:54] so God always uses something foolish and
[1:20:58] simple that's why it goes over people's
[1:21:00] heads right it's too
[1:21:02] simple and and I can I can grasp that
[1:21:07] when you when you really think about
[1:21:09] it how could something of such great
[1:21:14] value be
[1:21:17] free nothing in the world is like that
[1:21:21] nothing's free period stick of gum's not
[1:21:23] free unless somebody happens to give it
[1:21:25] to you and then it wasn't free somebody
[1:21:26] had to pay for
[1:21:27] it but how can something of such great
[1:21:32] value be
[1:21:33] free it just boggles the mind a normal
[1:21:37] human mind has difficulty as I
[1:21:40] understand grasping the concept that
[1:21:44] salvation is free amen yeah it doesn't
[1:21:47] cost you anything right and yet your
[1:21:50] soul is worth 10 million worlds
[1:21:54] my praise the Lord but it's free I I I
[1:21:59] see where people get CAU how could
[1:22:01] something be free in that context when
[1:22:04] he called let me finish this now when he
[1:22:06] called his disciples if he would have
[1:22:08] chosen caus and the great priest they
[1:22:11] had trained for that hour they couldn't
[1:22:14] see him obviously there had been
[1:22:16] something to brag on they had their
[1:22:18] doctor's degree and everything but he
[1:22:20] goes down and he gets ignorant men
[1:22:23] fishermen who couldn't even read their
[1:22:26] own name or write their own name that he
[1:22:28] might take uh that he might take nothing
[1:22:31] and make something out of it amen
[1:22:34] remember the foolishness of God is
[1:22:36] greater than anything man's ever known
[1:22:39] the weakness of God is stronger than the
[1:22:41] strongest man could ever produce praise
[1:22:44] the
[1:22:45] Lord even the great St Paul said he had
[1:22:48] to forget all he ever know that he might
[1:22:51] find Christ Christ praise the Lord dying
[1:22:55] well that saints that had just become
[1:22:56] such a thing to me anymore dying dying
[1:23:00] dying daily amen we die of course we
[1:23:03] give our hearts to the Lord and we give
[1:23:05] ourselves over to the Lord as a lamb
[1:23:07] would but there's just something about
[1:23:10] that dying every day amen dying every
[1:23:13] day praise the Lord and look today
[1:23:16] people don't want a pastor unless he can
[1:23:19] talk just proper make all of his nouns
[1:23:22] and pronouns boy that puts me way out
[1:23:25] and if that be so I couldn't get in no
[1:23:28] pull pit amen because I don't even know
[1:23:32] the difference between a noun and a
[1:23:34] pronoun I might a little bit but it's
[1:23:36] fuzzy and the only thing that I know is
[1:23:39] I know him and that's all that I care to
[1:23:42] know amen praise God that's the quote
[1:23:45] I'm reading amen I'm doing it because I
[1:23:48] feel so
[1:23:50] U like me saying it
[1:23:53] that's all I care to know for he is my
[1:23:56] noun he is my pronoun he is my life now
[1:23:59] the things we want to know is him but
[1:24:02] you see our religious system has adopted
[1:24:04] the educational system and took and
[1:24:07] tried to take place of the Holy Spirit
[1:24:10] that's what they've done to take place
[1:24:12] of the holy spirit amen we look like
[1:24:15] fools to the world but to Jesus Christ
[1:24:19] amen oh it's it's the wisdom
[1:24:22] praise the Lord because again like we
[1:24:24] said a couple weeks ago it's not our way
[1:24:27] it's his
[1:24:29] way it's not our will it's his will it's
[1:24:32] not our mind it's his mind praise the
[1:24:35] Lord man can't comprehend it the bride
[1:24:38] is growing closer into it but the world
[1:24:40] they'll never they they can't because it
[1:24:43] is so contrary every day everything the
[1:24:46] world does government vention science
[1:24:49] medicine grows further and further away
[1:24:51] from God amen I'm not complaining
[1:24:54] against any of them I live in this
[1:24:55] Cosmos but it all gets us gets the world
[1:24:58] further and further away from God yes
[1:25:00] praise the Lord to one day you won't
[1:25:03] even need a car you just travel as a
[1:25:05] thought amen won't have to worry about
[1:25:07] the atmosphere and fossil fuels and
[1:25:10] whatever else amen I've heard scientists
[1:25:13] talk about saying oh the world wasn't
[1:25:15] made to have this many people well
[1:25:17] that's true it was only supposed to be
[1:25:19] designed for those that were in the
[1:25:20] Lamb's Book of Life amen
[1:25:23] only those who are in the Lamb's Book of
[1:25:24] Life are supposed to be the ones that
[1:25:26] are supposed to be here which probably
[1:25:28] excludes you I don't want to be
[1:25:30] judgmental but there's a very good
[1:25:32] chance it does not include the one who
[1:25:34] actually made that statement that's all
[1:25:37] God made it for him and his children
[1:25:39] yeah praise the Lord wasn't it wasn't to
[1:25:42] be made for serpent seed it wasn't to be
[1:25:44] made for unbelievers it was to be made
[1:25:46] for Christ and uh for God and his
[1:25:48] children amen praise the Lord Hebrews
[1:25:51] let's go I got two more scriptures I
[1:25:53] want to read and we'll close
[1:25:57] here Hebrews
[1:26:00] 4:12 we know this very very well Hebrews
[1:26:04] 4:12 you might even could quote it for
[1:26:06] the word of God is
[1:26:08] quick and Powerful that word quick just
[1:26:11] means alive it's living the word is
[1:26:14] living amen doesn't mean it's fast it
[1:26:17] means it's Living Praise the Lord it is
[1:26:21] living it is quick powerful and sharper
[1:26:24] than any two-edged sword piercing even
[1:26:27] to the dividing of sunder of Soul and
[1:26:29] Spirit which we preached on few years
[1:26:32] back actually on the cero church we
[1:26:35] delved into that a little deeper which I
[1:26:37] won't do
[1:26:38] today piercing even to the dividing aund
[1:26:41] of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and
[1:26:44] marrows and a discerner of the thoughts
[1:26:46] and intents of the heart praise the Lord
[1:26:49] Discerning the thoughts and intense
[1:26:51] another quote let me read recognizing
[1:26:53] your day in its message look at this
[1:26:57] foolishness you want to talk about
[1:27:01] foolishness amen some God had to take
[1:27:04] something foolish to Open the Eyes of a
[1:27:09] blinded Prophet if you will balam never
[1:27:12] recognized the angel of the Lord until
[1:27:15] the mule spoke in tongues amen right all
[1:27:19] know the story right it brings that
[1:27:21] image to your mind every time I hear any
[1:27:24] kind of excert of this story I can see
[1:27:28] that mule between that between his Stone
[1:27:30] pillars and and him sitting there
[1:27:33] banging back and forth that's I picture
[1:27:35] that every time uh Bam could not
[1:27:38] recognize that well that and the mule
[1:27:41] looking back said why are you whipping
[1:27:42] me would you stop that I'm trying to
[1:27:45] help
[1:27:48] you amen that's what I see mu just
[1:27:51] speaking I have been a good mual to you
[1:27:54] I've been good to you I've done
[1:27:55] everything you asked and now you're
[1:27:57] beating me for no reason and I'm trying
[1:27:59] to help you yeah that's the same thing
[1:28:01] people do today too Bam could not
[1:28:04] recognize that an angel was standing in
[1:28:06] his way a blinded preacher could not
[1:28:09] recognize that it was God standing in
[1:28:12] his way trying to keep him from selling
[1:28:14] his GI for money so when he came out and
[1:28:17] the donkey spoke to him God said if it
[1:28:20] weren't for that dumb mu you be a dead
[1:28:22] man right now that's right oh bet that
[1:28:25] donkey got fed good that
[1:28:28] night he would if his mine and when the
[1:28:31] mule spoke in a human voice then balum
[1:28:34] recognized that it was the angel
[1:28:36] standing in the way keeping him from
[1:28:37] doing what he was doing oh praise the
[1:28:40] Lord amen the foolishness what does that
[1:28:43] look like to man that looks like
[1:28:45] craziness do you imagine if God did well
[1:28:48] if if the world did that today and a
[1:28:50] donkey opened his mouth that probably
[1:28:52] take him and try to put him in the
[1:28:53] circus or sell him on eBay or something
[1:28:55] I got to talk him you well he only spoke
[1:28:57] in tongues one time he's only going to
[1:29:00] speak in tongues once you can sell him
[1:29:01] for a million bucks but he's only going
[1:29:03] to speak in tongues this one time so
[1:29:05] it's already been said done and know
[1:29:07] it's over praise the Lord so one more
[1:29:10] one more scripture Ephesians chapter
[1:29:13] 6 uh starting verse
[1:29:18] 12
[1:29:20] amen so bam got off easy in that case
[1:29:25] but God taking the foolishness of a mule
[1:29:28] trapping the prophet right there and not
[1:29:31] going any further mine it's just uh it's
[1:29:34] it's uh it's quite a story I I like the
[1:29:38] truth the fact of it is that it actually
[1:29:40] happened it's
[1:29:41] true uh I just I we haven't had a pet
[1:29:45] for a long time but I could just imagine
[1:29:48] when we had a pet if Rosie or something
[1:29:50] had opened her mouth and
[1:29:52] said something uh how would you feel if
[1:29:55] your dog brother
[1:29:57] Dennis it would uh it would take you
[1:30:00] back for sure
[1:30:03] amen Ephesians chapter 6 ver2 let's read
[1:30:06] this for wrestle not against flesh and
[1:30:09] blood but against principalities against
[1:30:12] Powers against the rulers of Darkness
[1:30:13] the world against spiritual wickedness
[1:30:15] in high places even though we probably
[1:30:18] spent the larger part of our energy on
[1:30:21] the those things that are nominal
[1:30:24] instead of the things that are spiritual
[1:30:26] right fighting the things that are
[1:30:28] natural fighting the things of the flesh
[1:30:31] coming again instead of fighting the
[1:30:33] things that are spiritual everything you
[1:30:35] see that's going on in this world today
[1:30:36] all these the the evil and the
[1:30:38] wickedness and all the protest and
[1:30:40] everything I mean how a person can stand
[1:30:42] on the side of somebody that would
[1:30:44] behead a burn a baby I don't get but
[1:30:46] it's a spirit yes there's a spirit there
[1:30:49] Saints and we read last week where that
[1:30:52] Spirit comes from and we know where this
[1:30:54] spirit is going to lead to I told the
[1:30:57] Lord yesterday when I was praying in
[1:30:58] here I said God I know we've preached
[1:31:00] about this I've read it in scripture
[1:31:02] I've heard brother BR talk about it I
[1:31:03] just never realized how hard it was
[1:31:07] going to be on me to see this country
[1:31:10] devolve into the place it's getting to
[1:31:12] right it it's
[1:31:14] hard I never realized how hard it was
[1:31:17] going to be to see these things
[1:31:19] happening and for Israel coming Under
[1:31:22] Siege Now by so many fronts the turkey
[1:31:25] pres I think it's the turkey president

[1:31:29] ministers U uh said something derogatory
[1:31:32] about Israel now I read this Thursday or
[1:31:35] Friday now the country of Turkey is
[1:31:38] declaring Israel war crimes against
[1:31:43] Israel for fighting back for having
[1:31:46] their women raped and their children
[1:31:48] beheaded right they are the war
[1:31:50] criminals see friend and turkey is just
[1:31:53] North just on the other side of the
[1:31:54] Mediterranean just North of Israel on
[1:31:57] all sides remember what the scripture
[1:31:59] said on all sides I just never realized
[1:32:02] how hard it was going to be on me
[1:32:05] personally on on my Humanity on my
[1:32:08] civility on my flesh on my spirit to see
[1:32:12] this unfold it just it it's hard
[1:32:14] sometimes you you want to and my flesh
[1:32:16] wants to strike back right but it's
[1:32:19] unfolding is the way God's word said it
[1:32:21] would and it's going to continue to do
[1:32:23] so so God help me amen God help us to
[1:32:28] see it happen I've had people say well
[1:32:31] if that person is supposed to be the
[1:32:32] president for this to all unfold let it
[1:32:34] happen that's hard that's easier said
[1:32:36] than done right it is to me anyway amen
[1:32:40] it is it is to me anyway so I'll just
[1:32:43] leave it there we wrestle not against
[1:32:45] flesh and blood seed 13th verse

[1:34:25] of you and you're raising and put you in
[1:34:28] in the position the things in the we
[1:34:30] went through all that in the adoption
[1:34:32] series but I think sometimes God takes
[1:34:35] some of the weaknesses the places where
[1:34:37] you're the weakest to show that he's the
[1:34:38] one in control right not you amen
[1:34:42] because without him Saints I would be
[1:34:44] paralyzed to fear right now sure to
[1:34:47] stand in front of you in that camera and
[1:34:49] going to be on YouTube really
[1:34:52] new been wouldn't do that that's God
[1:34:55] some people say oh that's uh uh whatever
[1:35:00] no no I I I never wanted any part of it
[1:35:04] I've told you my testimony but I'll
[1:35:05] leave that again for another day but God
[1:35:08] sometimes he'll take the weakest part of
[1:35:10] you and use it just so he can prove to
[1:35:12] you that it's him doing it not you
[1:35:16] amen today Christ reveal in his own word
[1:35:20] today so confused about the evidence
[1:35:23] excuse me evidence of the Holy Ghost and
[1:35:25] so forth Satan can impersonate any kind
[1:35:28] of a gift that God has got but he cannot
[1:35:32] listen now he cannot Satan cannot bring
[1:35:36] that word word by word why because it's
[1:35:39] the word that come out of the mouth of
[1:35:41] God Amen praise the
[1:35:44] Lord it cannot come he cannot bring it
[1:35:47] like that because he's not built for it
[1:35:50] he's not not a Believer amen not
[1:35:55] called Satan can impersonate any kind of
[1:35:58] a gift amen tongu prophecy uh
[1:36:02] interpretations all the gifts all the
[1:36:04] things that shine out that people always
[1:36:06] try to want to Major on Satan can
[1:36:08] impersonate any one of those but he
[1:36:10] cannot bring this word word by word yes
[1:36:13] amen he can impersonate the best oror he
[1:36:17] can impersonate the best speaker he can
[1:36:19] impersonate the most greatest
[1:36:21] personality he can impersonate the most
[1:36:24] emotional he can impersonate any that
[1:36:26] but he cannot impersonate the word
[1:36:28] that's why I say when you break all that
[1:36:30] down and you take all that away it BR it
[1:36:33] boils down to the word amen what's the
[1:36:37] word I told you before me and my wife we
[1:36:40] used to be in services and people
[1:36:41] shouting screaming carrying on ministers
[1:36:43] up they're all emotional he's carrying
[1:36:45] on and these people shouting and
[1:36:47] screaming and amen and you get outside
[1:36:49] and I look at my wife and I'm like what
[1:36:50] is he talking about
[1:36:52] and we're not novice Saints and look and
[1:36:54] say what is he talking about we got our
[1:36:56] church and say oh and they're still just
[1:36:57] shouting and say yeah that was a
[1:36:58] wonderful yeah that was a great message
[1:37:00] I'd ask them what did they say I don't
[1:37:02] know but it was
[1:37:04] wonderful how was it wonderful because
[1:37:06] you got a tickling up down your spine
[1:37:08] that did you no good only the word is
[1:37:12] what builds you and brings you and and
[1:37:14] reveals itself and makes you what you
[1:37:16] are amen only the word and that's the
[1:37:20] thing that Satan cannot do is bring that
[1:37:24] word word by word that's where he failed
[1:37:26] in the Garden of Eden and that's where
[1:37:28] he's always failed that's where then the
[1:37:31] tapes on they talked about the the
[1:37:34] message false anointed ones which we
[1:37:35] Minister on a couple times
[1:37:37] here they can be Anointed with the
[1:37:40] spirit speak in tongues dance shout
[1:37:42] preach the gospel and still be a
[1:37:45] devil it's the
[1:37:48] inside now remember Jesus said all the
[1:37:50] father had given me no man can come to
[1:37:53] me except the father draw him first
[1:37:56] that's simple salvation friend that's a
[1:37:58] hard thing that people can't understand
[1:38:00] how could something so great be so fre
[1:38:03] how can something of such great value
[1:38:07] cost me
[1:38:09] nothing amen praise my praise the Lord
[1:38:12] just my life I give my life to him amen
[1:38:16] but I do it freely I don't do it because
[1:38:19] he makes me to I I do it because he
[1:38:21] tells me I have to or I'm going to hell
[1:38:23] no no I'm not I don't do this to dodge
[1:38:25] hell I do this because I love it amen I
[1:38:30] love it and that's why we do what we do
[1:38:32] because we love him it's our love
[1:38:34] towards him now that's foolish to the
[1:38:36] world right it looks like foolishness in
[1:38:39] preaching people may be in that barber
[1:38:41] shop this morning may think they're in
[1:38:43] there and and and no telling what they I
[1:38:46] hope not but it's foolishness to the
[1:38:48] world they look at it and think why
[1:38:50] would somebody act like like that why
[1:38:52] would somebody talk like that they don't
[1:38:54] understand amen but to the world it's
