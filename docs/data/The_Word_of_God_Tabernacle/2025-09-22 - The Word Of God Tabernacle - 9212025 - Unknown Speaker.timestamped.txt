[20:02] the Lord would just bless and keep them
[20:04] and continue to bring healing and
[20:06] deliverance. I said they would be

[22:10] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[22:12] It's a privilege once again to be in
[22:14] your house, Father.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. knowing that above all your
[22:18] presence is here, Father.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; And if we've come to see one another or
[22:25] try to meet one another after church,
[22:28] we've come in vain
[22:30] &gt;&gt; because our purpose is to meet with a
[22:32] living God.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we know that the hour is so
[22:36] late. So many signs displayed. You're
[22:39] letting your bride know that you're
[22:41] coming for her soon.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. And Lord, I believe, like
[22:45] I've said before, if there was an angel
[22:49] that stood with a sign and and showed us
[22:52] that the coming of the Lord is near,
[22:55] still people won't repent.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; Still people won't get right with God.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:01] &gt;&gt; As you told that gallant servant of
[23:05] yours, Joshua, he says, "The land is
[23:09] yours. Go possess it."
[23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you've got to fight for every
[23:14] inch of ground.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, Lord.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; He didn't just say walk in and you'll
[23:19] have a picnic.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; He says, Joshua, there'll be enemies,
[23:23] &gt;&gt; but you'll defeat him if you stand with
[23:26] my word.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; If you know that my spirit's with you,
[23:30] children of God, today,
[23:33] the promises of God are ours.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; But it's not going to be handed to us.
[23:39] Yes,
[23:40] &gt;&gt; we must fight for every inch of bellus
[23:43] &gt;&gt; and claim the promises that we have need
[23:46] of in our lives.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; The Lord help us.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; I know that
[23:51] &gt;&gt; that there are some that might say,
[23:53] "Well, I've come to perfection.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; Our time of perfection is when these
[23:58] bodies are changed.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; There's no shortcuts. There's no easy
[24:03] roads."
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. No, there's no hope pass that
[24:07] you can just make it, you know, so easy.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; I heard your prophet a couple of days
[24:15] ago says my worst enemy is William
[24:18] Brandom.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; If I can get William Brandon out of the
[24:22] way, I know, Lord, that you can use me
[24:26] for your honor and glory.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, Father. And Lord, that speaks to
[24:29] our hearts even that much more because
[24:32] you use brother Brandham to bring a
[24:35] message, a word that'll get a bride
[24:38] ready for rapure.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Humble us, Father. Help us to recognize
[24:44] the littleer we get, the more bigger you
[24:48] can become in our lives.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; And Lord, there are needs in our church,
[24:53] in our little congregation this morning.
[24:57] For we know there's some that need a
[24:59] healing touch. My brother Danny, my wife
[25:02] who's nervous about her surgery.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; Amanda, Lord, with her eye appointment
[25:08] coming up and all the other niece maybe
[25:13] I've overlooked, Lord, at the patch, our
[25:16] sister going to rehabilitation with her
[25:19] hip surgery. For we know you are our
[25:23] loving God, a great physician that can
[25:26] be touched by the feelings of our
[25:28] infirmities.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; And by your strip, we are healed.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; And we claim it, Father, for your honor
[25:35] and for your glory. Thank you, Lord,
[25:36] &gt;&gt; that your children have possessed the
[25:40] land and they're going to stand on your
[25:44] word and claim the promises, the
[25:47] healing, the deliverance, Lord, that
[25:50] they have need of.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; And Lord, this is a burden in my heart.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; There's some that are not ready,
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; It's time to seek you for the baptism of
[26:00] the Holy Ghost.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; It's not time to play games with you. We
[26:05] can put a facade that we're in the
[26:07] message, but that's not it at all.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; It's having that token, that life living
[26:14] in Lord Jesus,
[26:15] &gt;&gt; that speaks for itself, a written
[26:18] epistle read and known of all men.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, all the unspoken prayer requests
[26:23] that hands that lifted up, may you grant
[26:26] them their harsh desire. May their cup
[26:29] runth over with your blessings, Father.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; Grant it God. Yes, Lord.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; Bless our pastor as he brings forth your
[26:38] word.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; May we be uh recipients that are hungry
[26:43] and thirsting for your righteousness,
[26:46] knowing that we shall be filled.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, in your name we pray, name the
[26:51] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You can be
[26:56] seated if you'd like.
[26:59] Amen. Lord Jesus, he's so good. Amen.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's turn over
[27:04] to Psalm numbers 51. We'll have it on
[27:06] the screen here. Amen. Glory to his
[27:09] wonderful name.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Micah sent me a uh a
[27:13] testimony. I wanted to go ahead and read
[27:15] that now.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He sent me a testimony yesterday.
[27:21] He wanted me to read to everyone this
[27:23] morning. So,
[27:26] I can find it here.
[27:28] Uh Micah says, he said, "Our agency, you
[27:32] know, insurance agency he works at. Our
[27:34] agency had a 10th anniversary
[27:37] celebration Thursday and it was
[27:39] forecasted to rain earlier on in the
[27:41] day. Sean, the owner uh kept saying in
[27:45] case it rains or when it rains. I told
[27:49] her the first time she said it those
[27:51] phrases that no, it's not going to rain
[27:54] until we're done.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; As I expected, it did not start
[27:59] drizzling until seven. the time set for
[28:02] our celebration to end. At the end of
[28:05] the night, she sent a text to all of us
[28:08] employees thanking them uh and to thank
[28:12] Micah for help uh for helping to
[28:16] manifest
[28:17] uh the word that she used of no rain.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; Uh Sean is a professing Christian, but
[28:23] this particular situation allowed me to
[28:26] teach her to speak things in faith out
[28:28] loud. So much that she mentioned it in
[28:32] the text to all of us.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, praise the Lord.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Uh just being an example. Amen.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Just being a written epistle,
[28:42] &gt;&gt; being a living disciple. Yes.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Being Christ on earth.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Shining his light through us,
[28:48] letting him use us. Amen.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful. Praise the Lord.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; I enjoyed that. It's a good testimony.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. just not not a God of the history,
[28:59] not a God of the Bible, but a living God
[29:02] of today. That's what we need to be
[29:04] producing, a living God of today.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So, great
[29:09] example. A lot of times people say,
[29:11] "Well, I don't want to say that because
[29:13] what if it does and uh people say then
[29:16] they lose their faith or whatever." No,
[29:18] speak it and have faith. Just trust God.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Has God ever failed you? God
[29:24] doesn't fail us.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. I believe
[29:27] that. So, Micah put it on display and
[29:30] we're thankful to that.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Songs number 51.
[29:35] Amen. In the book, have it on the screen
[29:36] here. Songs number 51. Down. Glory to
[29:40] his name. Amen. Let's sing it now.

[33:08] &gt;&gt; So glad he knows me.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; A lot of people know him. The devil
[33:13] knows him. The devil knows him
[33:14] personally even.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; But he doesn't know him.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; Not like he knows me. Praise the Lord.
[33:22] Amen. So thankful we know him in his

[33:28] and we worship him. Amen. Thank you
[33:30] Jesus. Amen. Let's go ahead and stand if
[33:34] we could turn in our Bibles. Amen. You
[33:37] want to have a a prayer or a testimony?
[33:41] something on your heart today you'd like
[33:44] to mention
[33:49] &gt;&gt; that.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Does he say his
[34:01] vision's getting better?
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; That's wonderful. Praise the Lord.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Anyone else?
[34:15] Amen. Praise the Lord. God is good.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. For blessing us with another
[34:22] through another week. Amen.
[34:25] Helping us to be here today. Praise the
[34:28] Lord. Let's turn over in the Bible now
[34:30] to Romans chapter 8.
[34:33] Amen. We're going to after last week go
[34:36] back to our adoption series. This will
[34:38] be adoption part 27
[34:41] and the subtitle is what is in a name.
[34:46] What is what is in a name? Amen. Praise
[34:50] the Lord. Romans chapter 8. We're just
[34:53] going to read 14-1 17 here. Romans
[34:57] 8:14-17.
[35:00] Amen. Before we do, let's just bow our
[35:01] heads for another word of prayer if we
[35:03] could. Precious Jesus, what a wonderful
[35:06] time it is, Lord. to worship you, just
[35:09] to glorify and praise your holy name.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Just to mention that name, Lord God, to
[35:14] know and hear even uh people and know
[35:18] throughout the world, throughout this
[35:19] country, that your precious holy name is
[35:23] taken in vain probably more than it is
[35:25] worship today.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; But Lord, we want you to know that we
[35:29] say that name, we call out that name, we
[35:33] sing that name, it's in worship, Lord.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; It's in glorification. is to praise you,
[35:38] Father.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want to be there on that
[35:41] day, filthy and dirty, coming before
[35:45] your throne to bow down to call you
[35:47] Lord. Lord, I want to call you Lord. I
[35:50] want to worship you as Jesus, Lord of
[35:53] all today,
[35:54] &gt;&gt; oh God, and let our voices ring out to
[35:56] you Jesus because you are the same
[35:59] yesterday, today, and forever. You are
[36:02] Lord. You are the almighty God. You are
[36:05] the El Shadi, Lord. You are our alpha,
[36:08] Omega. You're beginning, ending. You're
[36:10] everything to us, Lord. God, we thank
[36:12] you so much for the blessings of this
[36:14] service and for these people, Lord, for
[36:17] those who may be watching today. We
[36:19] thank you, Lord, for this word and
[36:20] Father, for the truth and the revelation
[36:22] of this word. So many people can talk
[36:25] about this word and try to discuss this
[36:27] word and try to debate this word and
[36:29] criticize it, but Lord, it takes
[36:31] revelation from you, God. and revelation
[36:34] of that word and revelation to know who
[36:36] you are. We cannot even know you without
[36:39] revelation, Lord.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; And we thank you for that today. We
[36:43] thank you for l Lord your people God and
[36:45] to be a part of that family, the
[36:47] precious family of God, Lord. We pray
[36:50] you continue to move on every request,
[36:52] every need, everything that was spoken,
[36:53] each one that's here, God, and in our
[36:55] hearts as we worship and thank you.
[36:58] Lord, coming to this place now as we've
[37:00] opened up this precious holy rit, God,
[37:03] looking forward to you to speak to us
[37:04] through it. Lord, show us in here what
[37:06] you'd have us to know today. We commit
[37:09] it to you and ask your blessings upon it
[37:11] now in the name of the Lord Jesus
[37:12] Christ, we pray. Amen.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 8 and then we'll start with
[37:18] verse 14. Romans 8:14. For as many as
[37:22] are led by the spirit of God, they are
[37:24] the sons of God.
[37:25] For ye have not received the spirit of
[37:27] bondage again to fear, but you have
[37:29] received the spirit of adoption, whereby
[37:31] we cry, aba, father. The spirit itself
[37:34] beareth witness with our spirit, that we
[37:36] are the children of God. And if
[37:38] children, then hes, heirs of God and
[37:41] joint hes with Christ. If so be that we
[37:44] suffer with him, that we may be also
[37:47] glorified together. Praise the Lord. You
[37:49] can be seated if you'd like.
[37:52] Amen. I want to uh I want to go back on
[37:55] one thing that we mentioned last week uh
[37:58] with the uh with the thing the Lord gave
[38:00] us. Matthew 25. Amen. I found out
[38:05] or heard this week through the news. Uh
[38:09] remember my my whole premise basically
[38:12] for last week's message was that foolish
[38:15] virgin in Matthew 25. and brother
[38:18] Brandham exhorting us to watch for that
[38:21] too to see uh when that nominal church
[38:24] goes after that oil. Amen. That's when
[38:26] the bridegroom came.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; And I heard uh so u with the Lord's help
[38:32] and blessing last week. I went with that
[38:34] thought and a couple of the scriptures.
[38:36] But I found out this week now that when
[38:39] uh this man uh as you all probably know
[38:42] now, his name was Charlie Kirk. uh when
[38:45] he was assassinated, he started when he
[38:47] was 18 years old, he started an
[38:49] organization called Turningpoint USA. It
[38:52] was to be a conservative organization to
[38:55] reach out to mostly young people to try
[38:57] to get them to conservative values and
[39:00] even Christianity if he could.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. uh to try to turn this country back
[39:04] into a a man and a wife, not two men,
[39:09] not two women, but a man and a wife with
[39:12] children and a family, right?
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Uh and g uh uh uh uh our our Christian
[39:19] values. Amen. Uh to go back to the way
[39:23] the country was founded and built. Uh so
[39:27] when he was uh assassinated the other
[39:30] week uh there was he had actually in
[39:34] cities around the country he had 32
[39:37] chapters of uh Turning Point USA that's
[39:41] headquarters 3,200 headquarters across
[39:45] the country and uh and and on uh uh
[39:47] college campuses around the country. Uh
[39:50] I found out maybe it was yesterday I
[39:53] can't I think it was yesterday I heard
[39:54] on the news that there are now remember
[39:57] what we told you about this how this is
[40:00] going to unfold uh what I really believe
[40:03] strong and really a lot of the
[40:05] foundation behind what uh the message is
[40:08] about last week in Matthew 25 uh about
[40:11] how this was going to explode into
[40:14] something that was going to bring this
[40:15] to a forefront that was that was going
[40:18] to I think be a beginning of or or a
[40:22] real strong push, let's just say, of
[40:24] that Matthew 25 of the of that nominal
[40:28] church going after that oil. Found out
[40:31] yesterday, remember 30 when he was
[40:33] killed, he had 3,200 3,200
[40:38] chapters.
[40:39] As of yesterday, I found out by the news
[40:43] that there are now 65,000
[40:47] new requests to start Turning Point
[40:50] chapters in this country.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; He had 3,000
[40:55] from 18 years old to 31 years old. He
[40:58] had established 3,200 in the country.
[41:00] 3,200.
[41:02] Now, since his passing, just a little
[41:04] over a week, there's 65,000.
[41:08] Not 6,500,
[41:10] 65,000
[41:12] requests to start a chapter of Turning
[41:16] Point in this country.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; You talk about an explosion. I don't
[41:21] even know the math of that. Uh, somebody
[41:23] smarter than me is going to have to come
[41:25] up with what from 3,200 to 65,000
[41:29] is request. They probably can't even
[41:31] honor them all. But the point of that is
[41:34] is showing the fervor of these people.
[41:36] showing the fervor of these nominal
[41:39] Christians, of these people out there
[41:41] wanting to push into this, wanting to
[41:43] get I I guess what they like to call
[41:45] revival uh out and get it sweeping
[41:49] across the nation. Friend, to me, that
[41:51] just fulfills script. I think that's
[41:53] just that's just fulfilling of scripture
[41:56] when you see that happen. And like I
[41:58] said, brother Random exhorted us to see
[42:00] that. And uh he thought it was happening
[42:02] during that time with him here. But you
[42:05] see what's going on now today,
[42:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[42:07] &gt;&gt; 65,000.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; That's that just that number astounded
[42:11] me. I thought it was worth bringing your
[42:12] attention today, especially after what
[42:15] the Lord had gave me and what we spoke
[42:16] last week on this really taking off and
[42:20] exploding into something that So, when
[42:23] you see all these things unfolding,
[42:24] friend, it just it just really ought to
[42:27] sober us.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; It it it really ought to wake us up. It
[42:30] really should
[42:33] get down in our hearts to say
[42:36] we we need to get to business with the
[42:38] Lord.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we've just been floundering
[42:41] around with our experience and flounding
[42:43] around with, well, do we have the Holy
[42:45] Ghost, not have the Holy Ghost,
[42:46] floundering around with, you know,
[42:48] flirting with the world a little bit or,
[42:50] you know, kind of in, kind of out and
[42:52] uh, you know, which, you know, lukewarm
[42:54] is the most miserable place a person
[42:56] could be. Yes. Even God said, "I would
[42:58] rather you were cold or hot,"
[43:00] &gt;&gt; right,
[43:00] &gt;&gt; than lukewarm. It's just the most
[43:03] miserable place you can be to try to be
[43:04] a Christian and then flirt around in the
[43:06] world and stuff and all all this stuff.
[43:09] It's time to get down to what do they
[43:11] call brass tax
[43:13] &gt;&gt; to to say this is this is the time. This
[43:17] it it is here. Uh I I talked last week
[43:21] too about uh um uh about flying over the
[43:26] salt and sea and having taken pictures
[43:28] of it. Yesterday I flew right over top
[43:31] of it. I mean our plane literally split.
[43:35] I mean it was right over top the way the
[43:38] and it just it hit me so strong. I
[43:40] couldn't hardly contain myself on the
[43:42] airplane looking out the window and
[43:45] knowing we flew right over it
[43:48] &gt;&gt; and seeing that and and I had just
[43:51] listened
[43:52] uh when I was working last week and a
[43:55] tape that brother Brandon was
[43:56] reiterating uh that prophecy that went
[43:59] forth when he was in California on that
[44:01] choosing of a bride
[44:02] &gt;&gt; and he was going through that and
[44:03] talking about the salt and sea and then
[44:06] two or three days later I'm flying right
[44:08] up right over top of it. It just to me
[44:10] these things aren't coincidences.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; These things aren't just happening in a
[44:15] vacuum, friend. This this is real. This
[44:17] is going on. This is happening right
[44:19] now. And I don't know what else I can
[44:21] say or do that would help us grasp more
[44:25] of of we're at the end.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; This thing is is winding up. It's it's
[44:32] it's at the end time. It's we're
[44:35] finishing it, friend.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. and and and and and that time is uh
[44:39] I I don't know how much more time it is.
[44:41] I'm not trying to prophesy, but uh from
[44:44] what I feel in my spirit and what I see
[44:46] going on, friend, and I see more
[44:48] scripture fulfilling, it just it just
[44:51] ought to sober us. Like I said, it ought
[44:54] to wake us up. It ought to bring us to a
[44:55] place to say, Lord, uh you know, this
[44:59] this uh I I I mean business today, Lord.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; I mean business with you, Lord. Amen.
[45:07] Oh, praise the Lord.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; It's uh
[45:13] it it's happening, friend. And um if it
[45:17] doesn't happen today, I'm looking for
[45:19] him tomorrow.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; And if it doesn't happen this week, I'm
[45:22] looking for him next week.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[45:23] &gt;&gt; If it doesn't happen next this month,
[45:25] I'm looking for him next month.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever it is, however it is, it
[45:30] just u it's that time. Amen. It's that
[45:35] it it's that time to uh to make sure we
[45:39] know that we know.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we know that we know. Not to
[45:43] mention the fact that the world is
[45:45] getting more and more dangerous all the
[45:47] time, too. But the Lord takes care of us
[45:49] and watches over us. So, let's get down
[45:51] to this message I want to speak on
[45:53] today. Now,
[45:55] &gt;&gt; what's in a name? Amen.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; What is in a name? Let's go over to uh
[46:00] St. Luke
[46:02] uh chapter 1. Read in St. Luke chapter
[46:05] 1.
[46:07] Praise the Lord.
[46:10] I want to read a few verses of scripture
[46:12] here. St. Luke chapter 1 to bring a
[46:16] little bit more light on maybe
[46:19] the songs we sang uh today.
[46:26] St. Luke chapter 1. Let's begin reading
[46:28] with verse 24 if we could.
[46:31] St. Luke 1:24. And after those days, his
[46:35] wife Elizabeth conceived and hid herself
[46:38] five months, saying, Thus hath the Lord
[46:41] dealt with me in the days wherein he
[46:43] looked on me to take away my reproach
[46:46] among men. Now that's Elizabeth hiding
[46:49] conceived and then hid herself five
[46:52] months. 26th verse. Now, and in the
[46:55] sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent
[46:58] from God unto a city of Galilee named
[47:01] Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man
[47:04] whose name was Joseph of the house of
[47:06] David. And the virgin's name was Mary.
[47:11] And the angel came in and uh in unto
[47:14] her, and said, "Hail,
[47:17] thou are thou that are highly favored.
[47:20] The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou
[47:23] among women. And when she saw him, she
[47:26] was troubled at his say, and cast in her
[47:29] mind what manner of salutation this
[47:31] should be. The angel said unto her,
[47:34] "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found
[47:37] favor with God." Praise the Lord.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; "And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy
[47:42] womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt
[47:45] call his name Jesus."
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's very specific.
[47:52] Now, it's one thing to to know that God
[47:57] would place in Mary
[48:01] the seed, the germ, to bring forth life
[48:06] from Mary, having known no man. That's
[48:09] one thing. But look and see how specific
[48:12] it was that the angel made sure to know
[48:18] that when this baby came forth that his
[48:21] name would be Jesus.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; There's a reason reason why he was to be
[48:27] Jesus. Amen. You can have babies born
[48:30] all the time. You think well uh God did
[48:34] something by bringing uh bringing him
[48:36] into this world. Amen. And they could
[48:39] have named him anything they wanted to,
[48:42] but it had to be specific. A very
[48:45] specific name. The name Jesus.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's why he specified
[48:51] his name is Jesus.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Well, why was that important? Because
[48:57] the name means something.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Your name means something, friend. Your
[49:02] name labels you in this earth. Your name
[49:04] gives you a character in this earth.
[49:07] Amen. And there was a reason why that he
[49:11] had specifically to call his name Jesus.
[49:16] He shall be great and shall be called
[49:18] the son of the highest. And the Lord
[49:21] shall give unto him the throne of his
[49:23] father David. And we know he'll be
[49:24] sitting on the throne of David in the
[49:26] millennium.
[49:28] And he shall reign over the house of
[49:30] Jacob forever. And of his kingdom there
[49:33] shall be no end. Then Mary said unto the
[49:35] angel, "How shall this be? I know not a
[49:38] man. The angel answered and said unto
[49:40] her, The Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost
[49:44] shall come upon thee, and the power of
[49:46] the highest shall overshadow thee.
[49:49] Therefore also that the holy thing which
[49:52] shall be born of thee shall be called
[49:54] the son of God. Amen. He shall be called
[49:58] the son of God. Look at the scripture
[50:00] now, especially for people that deal
[50:03] with trinitarians.
[50:05] He shall be called the son of God, but
[50:09] he was of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost
[50:12] overshadowed Mary,
[50:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, who is the Holy Ghost? The
[50:17] spirit of God.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Just like your spirit. If your spirit
[50:22] came out of your body, that would be the
[50:23] spirit of new men. If his spirit could
[50:26] come out, it was the spirit of God.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[50:28] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the third God. It wasn't a
[50:31] third godhead in the Trinity. is just
[50:34] simply the spirit of God, the Holy
[50:36] Ghost. That's why he can say, "Well, he
[50:39] was the the son of God, but he was of
[50:42] the Holy Ghost." Why? Because same
[50:44] thing,
[50:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[50:46] &gt;&gt; It's still God.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; What did he do? It's just like you being
[50:50] a son or daughter of God, just like
[50:52] being a child of God. He took that part
[50:55] of him, that germ seed of life, that
[50:58] thought attribute that he had of you
[51:00] before the foundation of the world when
[51:02] you came forth and placed that inside
[51:04] you. That's what made you a part of God.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Not your flesh, not your spirit, not any
[51:11] part of your human being, but that
[51:14] spirit of God, that seed of God that was
[51:16] placed in you that made you as much God
[51:19] as it did Jesus Christ.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus is just born a virgin birth,
[51:26] sinless birth. We were born in sin,
[51:28] shape, iniquity, come to the world,
[51:29] speaking lies. But that seed that was in
[51:32] you, Amen.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; That was God.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; That is God.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; That if you ever been a part of God, if
[51:39] you ever had eternal life, it had to be
[51:41] because the seed of God is in you.
[51:43] Because God is the only form of eternal
[51:45] life. And if God is the form of eternal
[51:47] life, then that seed is is eternal life.
[51:50] And that sea that's in you is as eternal
[51:52] as God is.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Because it's his life
[51:56] &gt;&gt; in you. Amen. It's not three gods. It's
[51:59] not two gods. It's one God. Yes.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; He's just expressing himself as son to
[52:05] come to save your s soul. God expressing
[52:09] himself in his spirit of the Holy Ghost
[52:12] to come and live in you and God
[52:14] almighty.
[52:16] It's the same
[52:18] is is God himself.
[52:22] Praise the Lord. Brother Aaron said,
[52:23] "It's not it's not God one like your
[52:26] finger. He's not one like your finger."
[52:29] Because if he's one like your finger,
[52:30] well, then where do you get with the
[52:32] Holy Ghost to or the sunship? Where's
[52:35] the sunship and the spiritship of God if
[52:38] he's one like your finger? No, he God
[52:41] separates himself out because he he's
[52:44] God. He can do that. Amen. He can take
[52:47] of his thought and put it in you.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; It's like in the natural, just think in
[52:52] the natural. If if someone comes and uh
[52:56] let's say they write a book or they
[52:59] write a song and and that that song or
[53:03] that book or that phrase, that quote in
[53:05] that book came from their intellect. It
[53:08] came from their uh spirit. It came from
[53:10] them as an original thought. Nobody else
[53:13] had ever had that thought in the history
[53:15] of humanity. Uh there's people in this
[53:18] country that have patented things like
[53:20] that. Uh I remember years and years ago
[53:24] uh carnally speaking years and years ago
[53:27] there was a coach of a basketball team,
[53:29] the NBA team, and his team had won the
[53:33] the championship two years in a row and
[53:37] they were going for a third time. they
[53:39] were in the championship and they were
[53:41] going to win uh they they were looking
[53:43] to win the third championship in a row.
[53:46] So he got on air and I don't know
[53:49] original thought nobody had ever heard
[53:51] it before. Nobody had ever said it
[53:52] before. Nobody had ever coined the
[53:53] phrase as you'd say coining a phrase. He
[53:56] said on on broadcast, "We're going to
[54:00] three."
[54:02] You know, he copy wrote that word and
[54:05] anybody that broadcast that word out in
[54:07] the public has to pay him royalties.
[54:11] 3P
[54:13] just that word copyright because it was
[54:15] something that came from from him, from
[54:18] his intellect, from his from his mind.
[54:21] It's it's a thought. Now somebody else
[54:25] can catch that same thought
[54:28] and and be in the same position and use
[54:31] the same word 3P. Why? Because it came
[54:34] from it came from this person. This
[54:37] person had that thought. He expressed
[54:40] that thought and that thought come into
[54:42] another person and that person became
[54:44] that thought and he said the word 3P
[54:50] could be the same as a song or a book a
[54:53] quote or something that that comes forth
[54:58] and it's a thought and it's a thought of
[55:00] a person and that person's thought goes
[55:03] forth and is expressed
[55:05] &gt;&gt; right
[55:06] &gt;&gt; and when that person's thought is
[55:07] expressed it goes into people's
[55:10] intellect, into their ears, into their
[55:12] mind, into their spirit. And that
[55:15] thought that may have been originated by
[55:18] this person, by that quote, that thought
[55:20] comes into another person's spirit and
[55:23] it becomes a part of that person,
[55:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Because now that person has received
[55:29] that thought. And if they express that
[55:31] thought, it's just going out and
[55:33] expressing to someone else what that
[55:36] lyric of that song was or what that
[55:38] quote of that book was or what that word
[55:40] somebody says was is an expression of
[55:43] that.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Right?
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Well, friend, all you are is an
[55:46] expression of God Almighty. You're a
[55:49] thought expressed.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; God shared that thought. God manifested
[55:54] that thought. And God brought that
[55:56] thought into you. And now you become
[55:59] that word expressed.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; And as you come forth and you express
[56:04] God, it's God in flesh all over again.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; God using you.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; To express that thought, to express
[56:12] those words. That's just God doing the
[56:15] same as he did here.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, we lose such track of it, friend.
[56:19] Because we want to make it so much
[56:21] differenter, so much a a part of
[56:24] religion, if you will. You're just as
[56:26] much a part of God there a as anybody
[56:31] &gt;&gt; as God himself
[56:33] because God put himself in you.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; You're the expression of that original
[56:38] thought.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; God expressing to you now. You're living
[56:42] it because it's who you are.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; You are God in flesh.
[56:47] God
[56:49] bringing to this earth
[56:52] a flesh body. He he expressed that
[56:56] thought in the womb of Mary. And that
[56:59] thought came flesh in the womb of Mary.
[57:02] And that that thought was birthed forth
[57:05] out of of Mary's womb and expressed into
[57:08] the world.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; And that flesh grew up as the son of
[57:12] God. Yes.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; As Jesus Christ or Jesus, his name was
[57:17] Jesus. We call him Christ as the
[57:19] anointed one because Christ means the
[57:22] anointed. And he was that expression,
[57:25] an earthly expression of God. Now, why
[57:28] did God have to bring an earthly
[57:30] expression of Jesus of himself on this
[57:32] earth through a woman? Why couldn't he
[57:36] just speak like he did in the beginning
[57:38] and speak say there's Jesus and bring
[57:41] him from the dust of the earth? Because
[57:43] Jesus had to come forth just like you
[57:45] and I to be a kinsman redeemer to be
[57:48] able to redeem us back.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. He could not be a kinsman redeemer
[57:53] and been a created being. He had to be a
[57:56] being that was born of flesh and blood
[57:58] of a woman just like you and I were.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; But he had to come in a sinless form to
[58:03] take our sins away.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; That's the only way he could.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; To come our arbitrator, to become our
[58:11] mediator, to become our savior, to
[58:14] become our God, to become our Jesus
[58:18] Christ anointed in flesh.
[58:20] so that we could receive him.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; So that they then could touch him, could
[58:25] handle him, could feel him. He even told
[58:27] Thomas when Thomas was doubting that it
[58:29] was him, he said, "Come, come thrust
[58:31] your finger in my side." They could feel
[58:34] him, they could touch him. But he had to
[58:37] come through Mary to express himself to
[58:40] for God to express himself in the form
[58:43] of a man.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. so that he would be called the son
[58:47] of God. Jesus. Praise the Lord. Jesus.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; And there's just something about that
[58:54] name.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; You know it is. I know when I was a
[58:58] young boy, Amen. Uh Gabriel, don't
[59:01] listen to this. When I was a young boy,
[59:04] uh I I I I could be a I I was influenced
[59:08] by my friends and people around me. And
[59:12] uh we went to church, went to a Baptist
[59:14] church for years. And uh when I got to I
[59:17] forgot 12, 13, whatever it was, we
[59:19] started going to a message church, but
[59:21] went to a Baptist church and I was young
[59:23] and uh very influenced by all the
[59:26] friends and stuff. And I I could be a
[59:29] rascal and I may have said this before,
[59:33] but uh I was plug ears. I told you I was
[59:38] voted the worst custer on my street or
[59:40] best custer. I don't know what that how
[59:41] do they call that? Best worst. I call it
[59:44] worse now. They probably called it best.
[59:46] It's not when I was a kid. You're the
[59:48] You're the best one at this. No, I was
[59:50] the worst. I was It was bad. But I know
[59:53] But I know because my my friends would
[59:57] challenge me. I This I have a hard time
[59:59] even saying this, but I just want to
[1:00:01] make a point. I I I when I would get to
[1:00:05] a place that they would challenge me to
[1:00:08] uh to just use foul language, just one
[1:00:12] thing after just one word after another.
[1:00:14] And I and and and I did. I mean, I'm 10
[1:00:16] years old, whatever it was, just a
[1:00:18] little kid,
[1:00:20] and on and on and on. And because in in
[1:00:23] the young in my young years, even though
[1:00:25] we went to a Baptist church, well, I
[1:00:26] mean, we we were just we were just lost
[1:00:29] as loss could be, you know, I mean, we
[1:00:31] were uh we ended up spending a lot of
[1:00:33] weekends going out on the boat and naked
[1:00:36] and my parents drinking beer and
[1:00:37] whatever. And we were just it just, you
[1:00:40] know, we that just the way we lived.
[1:00:43] Amen. Which actually I look at today and
[1:00:46] I think that was pretty tame compared to
[1:00:48] what you see today. But anyway, uh and
[1:00:53] and any time that and and it really only
[1:00:57] happened once that I can remember anyway
[1:01:00] that I it they my friends would
[1:01:03] challenge me and I I would just excuse
[1:01:06] me I'm sorry but I would just start
[1:01:08] cussing just one word after the other
[1:01:11] just throwing them out just as fast as I
[1:01:14] could throw them and all of a sudden I
[1:01:17] took the Lord's name in vain
[1:01:20] And as soon as I did that, and as soon
[1:01:22] as that came out of my mouth, I stopped
[1:01:26] because something came over me.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Kind of the feeling I got right now,
[1:01:31] something came over me and I never did
[1:01:34] that again.
[1:01:36] I was voted the best, worst, whatever on
[1:01:38] the street. I never said that again.
[1:01:42] Even as a little kid, even as a vile
[1:01:46] kid influenced by I never said something
[1:01:49] when I said when it came out of mouth, I
[1:01:51] stopped. I that was it. I quit.
[1:01:54] Something came over me and I just walked
[1:01:56] away. I didn't know what it was. I mean,
[1:01:58] I was just a little kid. I know what it
[1:02:00] was now.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; I didn't know then, but it was God
[1:02:03] speaking to me. It was God telling me.
[1:02:05] It was God's spirit showing me, "No, you
[1:02:08] you're not going to say that. Don't you
[1:02:11] say that. And and and I took it
[1:02:14] seriously. And I'm uh I I I never said
[1:02:17] that again. Amen. I'm not saying I
[1:02:19] didn't still use foul language as I was
[1:02:22] growing up as a little kid here and
[1:02:23] there, but that ended my reign, if you
[1:02:26] will, of being the best quote worst
[1:02:29] cusser on the street because uh that
[1:02:32] ended that. But it was just it was just
[1:02:34] the enveloping of that spirit that came
[1:02:36] over me when that happened. It just
[1:02:39] overtook me.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; When I took that precious name in vain,
[1:02:42] it it it did something to me, saints. It
[1:02:46] did.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It it it from that moment on
[1:02:50] really that I can remember made a
[1:02:51] difference in my life. Um and and and it
[1:02:55] and it changed me. Thank God for the
[1:02:57] better. It changed me to take that
[1:02:59] precious that precious name. Amen. In
[1:03:02] vain. And you hear it all the time. I
[1:03:05] hear people say it all the time. You
[1:03:07] hear it all over the place. Especially
[1:03:08] if you go around in restaurants and uh
[1:03:11] shopping and through airports and stuff
[1:03:13] like that. You hear people take the name
[1:03:15] of the Lord in vain all the time. I do.
[1:03:18] Uh it vexes my heart. But I I hear it.
[1:03:22] Uh especially when you go through like a
[1:03:24] place like LA like I did yesterday.
[1:03:27] Just looking at the people in the
[1:03:29] airport of LA made me realize I do not
[1:03:31] ever want to live in LA. Amen.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Uh that that that place is as vile and
[1:03:36] disgusting and anyway, but taking that
[1:03:39] name, it would just it just did
[1:03:42] something to me cuz there's something
[1:03:44] about that name,
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's something about that name.
[1:03:47] What's in that name? That name to us,
[1:03:50] it's precious. Now look, it's not just
[1:03:54] the name that he named. Let's go over to
[1:03:56] Ephesians now.
[1:03:59] It's not just a name that name there
[1:04:01] that Gabriel came and told Mary. Amen.
[1:04:04] And notice Mary's name. Mary for a
[1:04:07] reason. Right. Just like Joseph. Joseph
[1:04:09] for a reason. But that name that the way
[1:04:12] that name was was uh was brought forth
[1:04:16] was mentioned in the spec the specific
[1:04:19] way that it was supposed to be that uh
[1:04:22] Gabriel had gave her those instructions.
[1:04:24] But now look, not not just the thing I
[1:04:27] want to get to to is not just
[1:04:31] that name, his name, no o on him, but
[1:04:34] look what the scripture says. Uh
[1:04:36] Ephesians chapter 3, uh let's begin with
[1:04:39] verse 13.
[1:04:42] Ephesians 3:13.
[1:04:46] Wherefore I desire that you faint not at
[1:04:48] my tribulations for you which is for
[1:04:50] your glory. For this cause I bow my
[1:04:53] knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:04:56] Christ, of whom the whole family in
[1:05:00] heaven and earth is named.
[1:05:04] The whole family of God in heaven and
[1:05:07] earth is named after Jesus. Did you see
[1:05:12] that?
[1:05:14] the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of
[1:05:18] whom the whole family in heaven and
[1:05:20] earth is named.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So you say, well, uh,
[1:05:24] you're the bride of Jesus Christ. That
[1:05:26] makes us miss Jesus. Well, it also this
[1:05:28] makes us Jesus, too.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That name, that name, his name is
[1:05:34] given to all the family of heaven and
[1:05:36] earth. Our family, we're part of the
[1:05:39] family of God. And that family we're a
[1:05:41] part of, Amen. is that name that's given
[1:05:43] unto us. Amen. So when you say God, I'm
[1:05:47] a reflection of God. I'm a reflection of
[1:05:49] Christ. Miss Jesus, God on earth,
[1:05:52] reflecting that spirit, living that
[1:05:54] life, being that example, being that
[1:05:56] written epistle read of all men, being
[1:05:59] the one that God looks to to express
[1:06:01] that spirit on this earth today in that
[1:06:04] name, to express that name. For that
[1:06:07] name, the name of Jesus. Jesus is our
[1:06:11] savior. That name of Jesus that brings
[1:06:14] with it the all of the power of heaven
[1:06:16] and earth.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; All the family of God. Not all of earth.
[1:06:22] Now, it doesn't say all of earth. It
[1:06:24] says all of the family of heaven and
[1:06:28] earth. The whole family. Amen. Not
[1:06:31] everybody's a part of this family.
[1:06:33] Praise the Lord. Not everybody's a part
[1:06:35] of that name. Not everybody is called by
[1:06:38] that name. Amen. Just that name. by that
[1:06:42] family.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You'd call it, I guess
[1:06:45] in the world today, you call it the
[1:06:47] patriarch. The male of a family that
[1:06:50] begins or has a generation that comes
[1:06:52] out from under it like a family tree.
[1:06:55] You got a patriarch and a matriarch.
[1:06:57] Patriarch's father, matriarch's the
[1:06:59] mother, and out from it comes a family
[1:07:01] tree. Has some kids and kids have kids,
[1:07:03] them kids have kids, and by the time you
[1:07:05] get to the bottom is, you know, just a
[1:07:07] huge big conglomeration of people. But
[1:07:09] you started with a patriarch.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. That family, that family, all the
[1:07:14] family of God, heaven and earth, is
[1:07:17] named Jesus.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus, which means Jehovah Savior.
[1:07:24] Jehovah, God, Savior.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; And people say, "Well, there's Jesus."
[1:07:30] And and I like there there's this song
[1:07:32] that the Gaither uh uh vocal band sings
[1:07:36] that uh I forgot the name of it, but it
[1:07:38] expresses a lot of the attributes of
[1:07:40] Jesus Christ and it gets like to the one
[1:07:43] of the last or the last uh part of it
[1:07:46] and they say he's the second person in
[1:07:48] the Trinity. Of course, when I sing it,
[1:07:51] I change it to he is God Almighty, but
[1:07:54] they call it the second person in the
[1:07:56] Trinity. When you get and you break
[1:07:58] Jesus out from being God, then all you
[1:08:01] have is just another human being,
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; He's if he's not God, then what is he?
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; And if he's a lesser God, if he's the
[1:08:10] second person, you got a first person
[1:08:12] and a second person, then what does that
[1:08:14] make your family tree look like? How
[1:08:16] many patriarchs do we have up there?
[1:08:19] Amen. We have one. He's the patriarch of
[1:08:22] the family of God. That family comes
[1:08:25] forth because he is Jehovah God Almighty
[1:08:28] Jesus savior
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; to bring salvation to the human race.
[1:08:34] That's why his name is Jesus. It
[1:08:36] expresses not just who he is but God
[1:08:40] veiled in flesh Jehovah. But it also
[1:08:42] expresses his purpose of being here to
[1:08:45] be savior.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; He's God savior Jesus.
[1:08:50] It's no wonder Gabriel made a specific
[1:08:52] example of why he needed to be named
[1:08:55] that name because of Jehovah Savior. I
[1:08:59] like when we had our children. My wife,
[1:09:01] I be honest, my wife, she went to prayer
[1:09:03] about our kids' names. Amen. I didn't so
[1:09:06] much honestly because I busy working and
[1:09:09] stuff and she worked too. But um she
[1:09:12] took it so seriously and prayed. That's
[1:09:15] that's how Tabitha Faith got her name
[1:09:17] and how uh uh uh Mike and Nathaniel got
[1:09:22] his name that because of her. I agreed
[1:09:26] with them obviously because they were I
[1:09:28] felt in my spirit that that was
[1:09:30] something that the Lord uh was was
[1:09:33] pleased with and scriptural and that
[1:09:36] meant a lot to me. But there's there's
[1:09:40] there's so much to that name that
[1:09:42] expresses that person and that person's
[1:09:44] nature, who that person is as a person.
[1:09:47] Just like excuse me, the name Jesus
[1:09:51] expresses who he is, his
[1:09:53] characteristics, who he was growing up,
[1:09:56] what his purpose was, God, savior,
[1:09:58] Jehovah, savior, Jesus. That's who he
[1:10:01] is. Amen. These names mean something.
[1:10:04] Look at this.
[1:10:06] Let me read this to you.
[1:10:09] Uh I'm get moving a little bit ahead,
[1:10:12] but that's all right. I'm just trying to
[1:10:14] do what the Lord tells me to do.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; This is actually the last the last quote
[1:10:18] I was going to read today. But look at
[1:10:19] this. Said, "Now God's gifts always find
[1:10:21] their place." 1963. Now, how many times
[1:10:25] names in the Bible, we don't notice it
[1:10:27] no more today. You've often heard me
[1:10:30] scorn this name of children calling uh
[1:10:33] people calling their children Ricky.
[1:10:36] And unfortunately my my my brother's
[1:10:41] name was Richard. And the nickname of
[1:10:43] Richard is
[1:10:45] Ricky.
[1:10:47] And when my when and they used to tell
[1:10:49] me when my uh uh when they were young,
[1:10:53] my my brother was growing up because I I
[1:10:56] was way younger than my brother growing
[1:10:58] up and with cousins and stuff, they had
[1:11:01] three that were named uh uh like Ricky
[1:11:05] and anyway, and they had a little rhyme
[1:11:07] to it and they c they actually called
[1:11:09] him Ricky. And when I read this now, I
[1:11:11] think, oh my, why didn't we why did they
[1:11:13] change his name? Didn't know any better.
[1:11:15] Amen. didn't know any better. But look,
[1:11:18] Brother Bam says people calling their
[1:11:20] children's names Ricky. Now Ricky is a
[1:11:23] horrible name. You mustn't call them
[1:11:26] that. If you've got a child named Ricky,
[1:11:28] for goodness sake, change that name to
[1:11:30] something else.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Ricky or Elvis or something like that.
[1:11:34] He said Ricky means rat.
[1:11:38] The name Ricky means rat again. Yeah.
[1:11:41] Why would you want to call your kid a
[1:11:44] rat? Ricky means rat. See? And so you go
[1:11:48] and what you call a person. Now what you
[1:11:50] call a person that expresses that a
[1:11:53] little lady the other day had a little
[1:11:55] boy out here called his name Ricky. Uh
[1:11:58] James Ricky because it was so popular. I
[1:12:01] guess back in that day Ricky was
[1:12:03] popular. Ricky Nelson and
[1:12:06] uh sports star music stars whatever
[1:12:09] named Ricky was a popular name.
[1:12:12] He said Ricky was a popular name. This
[1:12:14] boy lady named James Ricky. And because
[1:12:17] it was so popular, they called him
[1:12:19] Ricky. I told her, "Change that name."
[1:12:22] Amen. And I noticed some people sitting
[1:12:25] here right now has got a little
[1:12:26] grandson. One uh one uh
[1:12:31] let's see, he skips over. That's that's
[1:12:34] got a little grandson. And his name is
[1:12:36] the one one little boy's a sweetest
[1:12:40] pleasant little fella. And the other one
[1:12:42] is a Ricky.
[1:12:44] And that's what he is. His name is
[1:12:46] Ricky. Brother said that's exactly what
[1:12:48] he is. You just watch him as nature just
[1:12:51] like that. I said to some of his
[1:12:53] grandparents or someone I said tell the
[1:12:55] mother to change that boy's name.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Just change that name over and watch
[1:13:00] what happens to that kid. See, you
[1:13:03] people don't want to believe that. We
[1:13:05] still think we live uh too long for
[1:13:07] that. But there is something in a name.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; He said, there is something in a name.
[1:13:13] Then why as long if there's nothing in a
[1:13:15] name, and we're going to get to this in
[1:13:17] just a minute. He said, why if there's
[1:13:19] nothing in a name, why, as long as Jacob
[1:13:22] was called Jacob, he was a suppler, a
[1:13:24] deceiver, and he was,
[1:13:27] that's what he was. But when he wrestled
[1:13:30] with the Lord all night and the Lord
[1:13:32] changed his name to Jacob, Jacob being a
[1:13:36] prince before God, he became that,
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:41] Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; That's what he became. He went from uh
[1:13:45] being suppler and deceiver to being uh
[1:13:49] Israel, a prince before God.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; See, God changed his name. He had to
[1:13:55] have a name change. Praise the Lord. You
[1:13:57] look at Abraham. Let's just look at a
[1:13:59] few of these since I've got them written
[1:14:01] down here. We gone through the name of
[1:14:04] Jesus and we talked about the name.
[1:14:05] didn't have to have a name change there
[1:14:07] because the very important specific
[1:14:10] instructions from Gabriel was to call
[1:14:12] him Jesus.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. No other name, no other name under
[1:14:18] heaven where man could be saved. Amen.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Colossians says, "All that you do, all
[1:14:24] that you do in word or in deed, do all
[1:14:28] in the name of Jesus Christ."
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:31] Me and my wife got married in a
[1:14:33] Methodist church where her parents went
[1:14:34] to church. To this day, I have no idea
[1:14:37] why. I guess because they were paying
[1:14:39] for it. I don't know. But it's tradition
[1:14:43] that the bride's wife paid for the
[1:14:46] wedding, but it's the groom's uh excuse
[1:14:50] me, it's the bride's dad that pays for
[1:14:53] the wedding or the bride's family that
[1:14:55] pays for the wedding. It's the groom's
[1:14:58] family dad that pays for the minister.
[1:15:02] That pays the minister. That was
[1:15:03] tradition. I don't know how that goes
[1:15:05] now, but that when when we got married
[1:15:07] 40 years ago, that was tradition. That's
[1:15:11] been a whole generation. Good grief.
[1:15:14] Where did the time go? Um
[1:15:17] 40 years ago, it was tradition then. So
[1:15:20] my dad um her parents didn't care. But
[1:15:23] when my dad went up to pay the minister
[1:15:25] now he's a Methodist minister did a good
[1:15:28] sermon
[1:15:30] a ceremony. It it was a nice wedding
[1:15:32] nice ceremony uh and all that went with
[1:15:34] it and things. He just read it out of
[1:15:36] the book. I got the book the star book
[1:15:38] of ministers out there right now. I can
[1:15:40] tell you exactly what he said because he
[1:15:41] read it out of the book. But it was it
[1:15:44] was a fine wedding. But my dad, when he
[1:15:47] went to pay him before the wedding, when
[1:15:50] we were in the back room, he went to pay
[1:15:53] him. He told that man, he said, "Now
[1:15:55] when you you when you unite them, you
[1:15:58] unite them in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:00] Christ."
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; And the man looked at him and said,
[1:16:04] "What do you mean?" He said, "Don't you
[1:16:07] say father, son, holy ghost." He said,
[1:16:09] "You say you unite them. You marry them
[1:16:12] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:16:15] Amen. What the Lord has joined together,
[1:16:19] what the Lord has joined together, let
[1:16:22] no man put us under. Now, some random
[1:16:24] father or some random uh son or some
[1:16:27] random when what the Lord has put
[1:16:30] together. Amen. Let no man put us under.
[1:16:33] He said, "You say the name of the Lord
[1:16:35] Jesus Christ." We got the video. And I
[1:16:37] mean, my dad was paying him. What was he
[1:16:39] going to say? No. I mean, he took the
[1:16:42] money. He took my dad's money. uh and we
[1:16:46] got the video when he united us and when
[1:16:48] he joined us together as husband and
[1:16:50] wife he said in the name of the Lord
[1:16:52] Jesus Christ
[1:16:54] praise the Lord I didn't know anything
[1:16:56] about it I didn't I wasn't even
[1:16:57] concerned about it but my dad was smart
[1:16:59] enough to know my dad had enough God to
[1:17:01] know when you marry them and you bring
[1:17:03] them unite them in the name of the Lord
[1:17:06] Jesus why do people they want to seem to
[1:17:08] want to do and worship the Lord Jesus
[1:17:10] and it comes all these other things and
[1:17:12] all these other churches and they'll
[1:17:14] worship and they'll call on the name of
[1:17:16] Jesus and they'll worship Jesus and and
[1:17:18] and they'll uh use that name over and
[1:17:21] over again and worship and different
[1:17:23] things. When they come to baptize
[1:17:24] somebody, they don't use the name of the
[1:17:26] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:17:30] Now, when I look at my Bible, you can
[1:17:32] look at Colossians 3:17 if you want to.
[1:17:35] Right now it says all that you do in
[1:17:38] word or in deed do in the name and I
[1:17:40] might be paraphrasing a little bit do in
[1:17:42] the name of the Lord Jesus or Jesus
[1:17:45] Christ.
[1:17:46] It doesn't say do all but baptize.
[1:17:50] It doesn't say when you come to baptize
[1:17:52] somebody it's okay to use titles. It
[1:17:55] doesn't say that. It says all that you
[1:17:58] do in word or deed.
[1:18:02] Baptism is one of the three ordinance
[1:18:04] deeds left to us. Baptism, foot washing,
[1:18:07] and communion.
[1:18:09] Amen. All you do in word or deed, doing
[1:18:13] the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; But when you get to that point, they
[1:18:17] want to omit the name of Jesus. And you
[1:18:20] see because of the power of that name,
[1:18:23] because of the the the power that that
[1:18:26] name generates, why Satan has tried so
[1:18:29] hard for over for almost 2,000 years to
[1:18:33] get rid of that name,
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; To snuff that name out.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; They brought that Catholic church in Nia
[1:18:39] Rome up to the forefront. What was one
[1:18:42] of the first things they did was to
[1:18:44] eradicate the name of Jesus,
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; right? trying to get rid of the name of
[1:18:48] Jesus and bring in father, son, holy
[1:18:51] ghost. Titles, things that mean nothing.
[1:18:55] Brother Vanam says evil spirits travel
[1:18:58] in those titles.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Evil spirits. You want to be baptized
[1:19:02] under the banner of an evil spirit?
[1:19:06] Not me.
[1:19:08] In name in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:12] Christ. all that you do in word or deed
[1:19:15] because it's that name that saves.
[1:19:20] Nobody can be saved outside of that
[1:19:22] name.
[1:19:24] Well, if baptism is a process point of
[1:19:28] salvation because baptism gets you to
[1:19:31] receiving the Holy Ghost, why would you
[1:19:34] why would you want to eliminate the name
[1:19:36] of Jesus Christ?
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; It just does. There is it makes
[1:19:41] absolutely no scriptural sense to try to
[1:19:45] take the name of Jesus out of that.
[1:19:49] I I probably told the story here. Me and
[1:19:52] my I think you went with Did you go with
[1:19:55] me to when me and Brother Wayne went to
[1:19:57] that Baptist church?
[1:19:59] I I don't think maybe it was just me and
[1:20:01] I my good friend uh brother Wayne King
[1:20:04] went to our church there in Florida.
[1:20:07] He had a friend he was a lineman power
[1:20:10] company. His friend invited him to come
[1:20:13] and uh go to these meetings at a
[1:20:16] Anastasia Baptist church and he
[1:20:20] mentioned it on Sunday. I said, "I'll go
[1:20:21] with you." He said, "Okay." So, me and
[1:20:24] him, I think it was just the two of us.
[1:20:26] We went on one night, I forgot, Friday
[1:20:28] night, Saturday night, whatever it was.
[1:20:30] We went to one of these meetings and of
[1:20:33] course we got there early. We were we
[1:20:35] were in the chair because that's that's
[1:20:36] what you do. We got there early for
[1:20:38] church and it was almost empty and we're
[1:20:40] like, "Is there church tonight?" And a
[1:20:42] couple people are around. They're like,
[1:20:43] "Yeah, there's church tonight." Where is
[1:20:45] everybody? Because it's a big church,
[1:20:48] you know. It's a Baptist church. I've
[1:20:50] never known of a real Baptist church
[1:20:52] denomination like that being small. Uh
[1:20:55] there's usually hundreds of people. We
[1:20:57] got there, of course, you know, people
[1:21:00] started filtering in and they started
[1:21:02] coming down the aisles. Just coming down
[1:21:03] the aisles. Oh, hey Bobby. How you doing
[1:21:06] over there? I said, "How you?" You know,
[1:21:08] and and they're coming down the aisle
[1:21:09] and said, "Oh, I hadn't seen you in a
[1:21:11] long time. How you been over there?" And
[1:21:13] they're just in the in the middle of
[1:21:15] church. I'm sitting there trying to read
[1:21:17] my Bible or pray, I can't remember. And
[1:21:18] they're out there yelling and screaming
[1:21:20] to each other all over the congregation,
[1:21:21] all over the in inside the sanctuary,
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; just yelling and screaming to each
[1:21:27] other, running back and forth to go
[1:21:29] greet people and stuff. And I don't have
[1:21:30] a problem with greeting people, but
[1:21:31] there's a vestibule for a reason.
[1:21:34] There's a fellowship hall for a reason,
[1:21:36] right?
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Not the sanctuary.
[1:21:38] Amen. I I mean, I I was I was waiting
[1:21:41] for somebody to break out a hot plate
[1:21:43] and start cooking some beans or
[1:21:44] something. I didn't know what they were
[1:21:46] going to do in that time. It was just a
[1:21:47] free-for-all.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; It's like, what what sanctity is to
[1:21:52] this? What reverence is there into in
[1:21:54] any all of this? Amen. and I went and
[1:21:57] had the entire service and in the entire
[1:22:00] sermon of course they had a contemporary
[1:22:02] band and contemporary music and stuff
[1:22:04] and okay it's not my thing I I don't
[1:22:06] worship to that uh sometimes I'll listen
[1:22:09] to music that may be a little more
[1:22:11] contemporary like but not a whole lot I
[1:22:14] definitely don't like the rock and roll
[1:22:15] stuff and jazz and all that but uh you
[1:22:18] know so but in church is the
[1:22:20] contemporary thing and you know they got
[1:22:22] a band going and every song they thing,
[1:22:26] every thing that was spoke, every prayer
[1:22:29] that was had, everything that was spoke
[1:22:32] by the minister, by the preacher,
[1:22:36] the name Jesus was not mentioned one
[1:22:39] time.
[1:22:41] I listened for it. Honestly, I listened
[1:22:44] for it. I do not remember because I
[1:22:46] remember coming out there and I remember
[1:22:49] thinking of coming up to end of that
[1:22:50] service and I poked brother Wayne. I
[1:22:52] think I told him. I'm like, they have
[1:22:54] not said the name Jesus one time in this
[1:22:56] entire service. No song. All the songs
[1:23:00] they sang, they were worship songs, but
[1:23:02] they never called the name Jesus. It
[1:23:04] was, you know, general platitudes to a
[1:23:07] god or something that people make Satan
[1:23:10] their god. But, you know, general
[1:23:12] platitudes, but there's something about
[1:23:14] that name when you call that name Jesus.
[1:23:17] I'm not saying every song has to say the
[1:23:19] name Jesus, but uh there should be
[1:23:21] something. But all these things, all the
[1:23:23] songs they sing, they came and had
[1:23:25] prayer for different things like the the
[1:23:28] uh uh prayer request or the u offering
[1:23:32] that was given and stuff like that. And
[1:23:33] they had prayer and ne nobody ever said
[1:23:36] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:23:41] Not at all. And it was right at the end
[1:23:44] they had the senior pastor senior pastor
[1:23:46] come up and close the service in prayer.
[1:23:49] And I and I I think I remember telling
[1:23:51] Wayne, I said, "Brother Wayne, they
[1:23:53] haven't mentioned that name one time."
[1:23:56] Senior senior pastor got up there and he
[1:23:58] prayed for the service at the end of the
[1:24:00] service. And at the very last thing that
[1:24:03] he said at the end of his prayer was in
[1:24:05] Jesus' name. Finally, one time in the
[1:24:09] entire service of everything, songs,
[1:24:11] prayers, every they didn't even close
[1:24:13] the other prayers in Jesus' name. I
[1:24:16] don't know why,
[1:24:18] but they didn't.
[1:24:20] Because what is it? It's the devil
[1:24:23] trying to eradicate the name Jesus,
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; He's trying to do it from your life.
[1:24:27] He's trying to do it from everything
[1:24:29] because he knows the power that is
[1:24:31] coming that comes and follows with the
[1:24:33] name Jesus.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; The name was spoken in the Bible the
[1:24:37] first time a little boy came to life.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; I mean, how much power can you think
[1:24:42] that name carries behind it? Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Savior,
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's power in that name.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; That's why we baptize in that name.
[1:24:54] That's why all that we do in word or in
[1:24:57] deed, we do in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because that's what the
[1:25:03] scripture says.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. No other he no
[1:25:07] other name in heaven where man could be
[1:25:08] saved but that precious name, Jesus.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at the Bible. You think why
[1:25:14] does it matter?
[1:25:17] Jacob,
[1:25:18] Jacob was named Jacob when he was born.
[1:25:20] Jacob means suppler, deceiver. God came
[1:25:24] and changed his name to Israel. As we
[1:25:26] said, prince with God. God changed his
[1:25:28] name. He had to change his name. Amen.
[1:25:31] He wasn't going to be associated with a
[1:25:33] deceiver, suppler. Amen. He's associated
[1:25:37] with a prince. A prince before God.
[1:25:39] Simon. Simon's name. Uh uh uh he has
[1:25:45] heard. Simon means he has heard or has
[1:25:47] been heard. Simon. God changed his name
[1:25:50] to Peter which means little stone. Amen.
[1:25:53] Little rock. That's why the Catholic
[1:25:55] Church thinks that Jesus said on this
[1:25:58] rock. They think they were talking about
[1:25:59] Peter. Peter was their first pope. They
[1:26:01] say so Peter was the first pope. So
[1:26:04] Peter was Peter was the first pope
[1:26:06] because Jesus said on this rock I'll
[1:26:08] build my church. So Peter was the first
[1:26:11] pope, the one that he built the church
[1:26:13] on. Amen. So you think what Jesus named
[1:26:17] him Peter? Amen. He said, "Your name is
[1:26:20] uh uh son of Jonas. Thy name is Peter."
[1:26:23] Amen. Little stone. And upon this rock
[1:26:27] I'll build my church. What rock?
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] Couldn't be Peter, but that's what they
[1:26:34] think because he's Peter's little stone,
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; right? But brother Graham of course
[1:26:39] helps us to understand that that church
[1:26:41] was built on the revelation of who Jesus
[1:26:44] Jesus Christ is.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; The revelation that Peter gave him. Thou
[1:26:49] art the Christ, the son of the living
[1:26:51] God. Upon this rock, upon this
[1:26:55] foundation, upon this revelation, upon
[1:26:58] this truth, I will build my church and
[1:27:01] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:27:04] it. Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad
[1:27:07] that you're part of that family, a part
[1:27:08] of that church, that the gates of hell
[1:27:10] cannot prevail? Oh, they'll come against
[1:27:12] you, old friend. Look, you know as well
[1:27:14] as I do, those gates of hell will press
[1:27:16] on you as hard as they possibly can. The
[1:27:19] devil will take you as far as you want.
[1:27:21] In fact, it'll take you farther than you
[1:27:22] want to go if you let it. Amen. Devil
[1:27:25] will, but it cannot prevail against you.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; It cannot overcome you.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; It cannot overtake you.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You belong to God. You
[1:27:36] don't belong to the devil. You belong to
[1:27:37] God. You're his. That's why we're part
[1:27:41] of that family, the family of God. On
[1:27:44] that revelation,
[1:27:46] Amen. I will build my church. That's why
[1:27:49] the church of God through all every
[1:27:51] church from the fir from Pentecost,
[1:27:55] it was built on from Pentecost, it was
[1:27:57] built on Jesus Christ. The revelation of
[1:28:00] who Jesus Christ is. That's why when
[1:28:04] every one of those denominations that
[1:28:06] splintered off from 3:20 AD when the
[1:28:09] Catholic church formed in Nia Rome and
[1:28:11] God left that church amen and bitterness
[1:28:15] ended entered into the church Sernia
[1:28:17] when bitterness entered in then they
[1:28:20] took the name of some father son the
[1:28:22] holy ghost but the bride of Christ
[1:28:25] amen as we'll say the bride comes out of
[1:28:28] the church it is always has been founded
[1:28:31] on the revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:28:34] is.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; And the name of Jesus.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; We've been built on that name.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; This bride. We say church. We we we
[1:28:43] bring that church in. But we got to we
[1:28:46] we know we know it's bride. We know
[1:28:48] there's a difference between the church
[1:28:49] nominal and the church spiritual. We
[1:28:52] know there's a church nominal that's out
[1:28:53] there. Those are the ones that's going
[1:28:55] trying to start going after that oil.
[1:28:57] But we know there's a church spiritual.
[1:28:59] We know there's a five wise virgins that
[1:29:01] God takes in a rapture. And that rapture
[1:29:05] or those children have been coming forth
[1:29:08] all the way from that Pentecost up to
[1:29:10] this time. And every one of them church
[1:29:12] ages, Martin, Luther, uh St. Martin and
[1:29:15] each one have been come forth and built
[1:29:17] on the revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:29:19] is. Not two gods, not three gods, but
[1:29:23] one God.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; That was the revelation that Peter gave
[1:29:27] Jesus there. And he said, "On this
[1:29:29] foundation, I will build my church, my
[1:29:32] spiritual church." Praise the Lord.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; That's what we're built on. That's why
[1:29:38] we hold that name so dear and so
[1:29:39] precious. Simon chain name was changed
[1:29:42] to Peter. Saul.
[1:29:45] Saul's name. Well, Saul means to be uh
[1:29:49] to uh means desired. Saul means desired.
[1:29:55] God changed Saul's name to Paul
[1:29:58] because he wasn't uh he wasn't that that
[1:30:02] was desired. Paul means little deputy
[1:30:06] which is basically what Paul did through
[1:30:09] the entire New Testament if you read you
[1:30:11] know Paul's life. Amen. That's exactly
[1:30:14] what he done when he came through and
[1:30:16] went to each city and brought forth the
[1:30:18] the word of God. Amen. Little deputy
[1:30:23] Abram. Abram's name was changed to
[1:30:25] Abraham. Abram is exalted father, which
[1:30:28] sounds like a good name, Abram. But that
[1:30:31] wasn't his position. His position wasn't
[1:30:34] to be exalted father. That's God
[1:30:36] Almighty. God Almighty is exalted
[1:30:38] father. Uh Abram's name, his position,
[1:30:43] his adoption was to be the father of
[1:30:46] many nations. Right? That's why he
[1:30:48] changed his name to Abraham
[1:30:51] to designate him as the father of many
[1:30:53] nations. That was his position. That was
[1:30:57] his placement. Amen. Was to be the
[1:30:59] father of many nations. Not an exalted
[1:31:02] father, but a father of many nations.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; His placement, his position. Sarai,
[1:31:09] uh his wife,
[1:31:12] uh Sarai means contentions.
[1:31:15] God changed Sarah's name to Sarah, which
[1:31:18] Sarah is princess.
[1:31:21] Praise the Lord. So, he took her from
[1:31:23] being contentious to being a princess.
[1:31:27] That's why God had to change their name
[1:31:30] so that the promised uh son of the uh of
[1:31:34] uh Isaac could come forth,
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; because God promised, you said, "Well,
[1:31:38] the promised son was Jesus." But God
[1:31:41] promised Abraham a son, did he not? He
[1:31:44] promised him his son Isaac. Now of
[1:31:45] course we know the royal seed of
[1:31:47] Abraham, amen, is Jesus Christ. But that
[1:31:51] seed that was to come forth, issued
[1:31:53] physical seed from Abraham was to be
[1:31:55] Isaac, not Ishmamail through the bond
[1:31:58] woman. Because we know that the the the
[1:32:00] the shuck is not heir with the seed.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not the genuine seed. Just like
[1:32:06] they'll never take that land. That is
[1:32:08] that land belongs to Israel. I don't
[1:32:10] care how much they fight, go back and
[1:32:12] forth. I don't care how many prophets,
[1:32:14] people uh uh uh uh presidents or
[1:32:17] whatever get involved in it. I don't
[1:32:19] care how many peace treaties they sign.
[1:32:21] I don't care how much they delve in it.
[1:32:23] None of that makes any difference. God
[1:32:25] gave it to Israel and it's theirs.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; And it will always be there.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; In fact, when those mothers were
[1:32:32] birthing forth those children, they
[1:32:35] actually named them in the birth pains
[1:32:38] the name that they were to be placed
[1:32:40] over in that land.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. When Joshua's position was to place
[1:32:45] them in their land, he placed them based
[1:32:47] on what of course got the revelation of
[1:32:50] God. But their name placed them there
[1:32:54] and what they were to be uh shepherds or
[1:32:58] priests or uh whatever position,
[1:33:01] whatever place, whatever uh position
[1:33:03] they were to be f to to fill their
[1:33:05] adoption
[1:33:07] was to be in that position. That wife,
[1:33:10] that mother
[1:33:12] called that name out in her birth pains
[1:33:16] as that child was coming forth. Amen.
[1:33:19] Gad and Asher and Joseph and Benjamin.
[1:33:24] Amen. Was to be brought forth to place
[1:33:27] them in that land. Their name, their
[1:33:30] name placed them where they were
[1:33:32] supposed to be. That's why it's so
[1:33:33] important. Well, that promised son, this
[1:33:36] son could not have come forth, could not
[1:33:38] have until God changed their names.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; God changed from Abram to Abraham and
[1:33:44] Sarah to Sarah. And when he changed
[1:33:46] their names, they were turned back to
[1:33:49] young man and young woman again. And
[1:33:51] Sarah finally conceived and brought
[1:33:53] forth a son.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; And his name was Isaac. And there you
[1:33:56] go.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; We kick it off. And there we go forward.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Read through the Bible. see
[1:34:02] exactly why each one was uh as it came
[1:34:06] forth from that lineage because God
[1:34:09] brought it forth to be that way. He had
[1:34:11] to change their names first.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; They had to have a name change. Amen.
[1:34:17] and and thinking about u
[1:34:21] uh uh Abraham
[1:34:23] uh to adding on the hamm the ham. It
[1:34:28] also changed his name from Abra from
[1:34:31] from exalted father to father of many
[1:34:34] nations. But it also put Abraham
[1:34:39] in
[1:34:41] his name in the place of
[1:34:45] perfection.
[1:34:48] It placed Abraham with now seven letters
[1:34:51] in his name instead of four
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; or five as it was. It place it placed
[1:34:59] him in a position of A B R A H A M seven
[1:35:04] letters.
[1:35:06] Amen. Completion with God.
[1:35:10] That's why it had he he changed not only
[1:35:12] did it change his name from exalted
[1:35:14] father to father of many nations but it
[1:35:17] placed him in a place of his in his name
[1:35:20] of completion. Brother Brandham talked
[1:35:23] about there had never been another one
[1:35:25] come forth like that with a message like
[1:35:27] that until as he said this day G R A H A
[1:35:32] N Billy Graham that went around the
[1:35:34] world and bringing forth uh uh that
[1:35:38] sanctification message as he brought
[1:35:40] forth as brother Bram talked about
[1:35:41] there's nobody could have done it any
[1:35:43] better that's why God chose him to do it
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; right
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; and he did
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; but he only had six letters in his name
[1:35:50] G R A H A
[1:35:52] He had the ham, the ham, but it was only
[1:35:55] six letters. You say that Ham is the
[1:35:57] father of nations. Yes, but it was to
[1:36:00] the people,
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; The the church nominal
[1:36:04] to the church uh uh uh nominal,
[1:36:08] not to the bride.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Right? So if God sent somebody like that
[1:36:13] with the number of man, six letters, G R
[1:36:17] A H A M, six letters, the number of man
[1:36:20] to bring forth a ministry, a word to get
[1:36:23] people to salvation through that through
[1:36:26] that gospel and through that gospel
[1:36:28] message and that nominal church. Don't
[1:36:31] you think that God would do the exact
[1:36:33] same thing in a higher form for the
[1:36:35] bride of Jesus Christ?
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:39] through someone who didn't have six
[1:36:41] letters in his name, but he had a ham
[1:36:45] with seven letters.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Brandon.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; B R A N H A M.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Seven letters. Now, that wasn't to the
[1:36:55] world. That wasn't to the church
[1:36:57] nominal. That message is to the bride.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; That message is for God's elect. That
[1:37:04] message is for God's church spiritual.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. not church natural.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's why it's so precious
[1:37:13] to us to understand what God has done
[1:37:17] and the importance of those names. The
[1:37:19] importance of that name. That name was
[1:37:21] important. In fact, I I can't I tried to
[1:37:25] find it.
[1:37:27] Uh maybe brother Dennis can help me. But
[1:37:30] um you know, brother Dennis used to
[1:37:32] pastor too u and all. He uh studying the
[1:37:36] word, but I I I could I could believe
[1:37:38] I've heard somewhere or read somewhere
[1:37:42] where their family name was changed at
[1:37:44] one point
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; to B r a ham. B R A N H. Brham. It
[1:37:50] wasn't seven letters before,
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; And it's not like brother Brham changed
[1:37:55] it so it would be Brham so he could say
[1:37:58] it was seven. No, it was before that.
[1:38:01] What you say?
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it that that name was changed.
[1:38:06] That family name was changed down to for
[1:38:08] whatever reason. I I want to try to find
[1:38:10] it again. I could not find it for some
[1:38:11] reason. If y'all find it, let me know.
[1:38:13] I'd appreciate it. Um, just let you know
[1:38:16] how fallible I am, but I couldn't find
[1:38:19] it. But I knew there was something way
[1:38:21] back in here. We talked about the back
[1:38:23] of the mind. There's a way back in here
[1:38:25] that remembered at some point that
[1:38:27] family name was changed to B R A N H A
[1:38:29] M. Seven letters with H A M on the end
[1:38:31] of it. Amen. Brought a message to the
[1:38:36] church spiritual. Praise the Lord.
[1:38:39] That's who we are.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; That's who this bride is. This bride is
[1:38:43] the church spiritual. My goodness, this
[1:38:44] guy has when I don't have my glasses,
[1:38:47] it's all blurry. I can't see the time.
[1:38:49] Anyway, let let me just close here in a
[1:38:52] minute. Um, we got those names and the
[1:38:56] changing of the name. Amen. I got so
[1:38:58] much more here I want to say. And
[1:39:01] Methuselah,
[1:39:02] the name, the name Methuselah was a name
[1:39:05] that was given so that Noah would know
[1:39:07] when to get on the ark. Um,
[1:39:12] Brother Brandham talked about the the
[1:39:14] the each of the church ages that were
[1:39:17] named for a specific reason. If you look
[1:39:19] at the if you look at the name of each
[1:39:21] church age, you see the characteristic
[1:39:24] if you know what that name means, you
[1:39:25] see the characteristic of that church
[1:39:27] age.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; When he talks about you left your first
[1:39:31] love and rolled over into bitterness and
[1:39:34] the open door in the Philadelphia and
[1:39:36] the the uh the the uh the the missionary
[1:39:39] age and what all those things, those
[1:39:41] names put in position the character of
[1:39:46] that of that age. um our names, what our
[1:39:50] names are make a difference to who we
[1:39:52] are and and our character and children
[1:39:55] when they grow up that what their names
[1:39:57] are. Amen. Uh I I just called Gabriel's
[1:40:02] name and I just read his name out of the
[1:40:04] Bible. Amen. The names make a
[1:40:08] difference.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; It it it it it identifies uh uh a person
[1:40:14] of who they are, their character.
[1:40:16] children's names. Amen.
[1:40:20] The name of Jesus
[1:40:22] more important than any name that we
[1:40:24] could think of. Brother Ram talks about
[1:40:25] the name of Bethlehem. The name of
[1:40:27] Bethlehem. The word bet h Beth means
[1:40:30] house. E L L means God in Hebrew. E L H
[1:40:35] E L H E M is bread which means Bethlehem
[1:40:40] where God Christ came forth was the
[1:40:42] house of God's bread.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; The name You think, well, was he a
[1:40:48] Nazarene? Was he where where were where
[1:40:50] where was he born? They were here and
[1:40:52] they went here and then they came here
[1:40:54] and they ended up here and and he was
[1:40:56] born in a stable in Bethlehem, not
[1:40:59] Nazareth and not because he had to be in
[1:41:03] Bethlehem because he was it Bethlehem
[1:41:05] was the house of God's bread,
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; And he was the bread of life that was
[1:41:09] brought down. Amen. He couldn't he
[1:41:12] couldn't be in Egypt. He couldn't have
[1:41:14] been in that. He couldn't have been
[1:41:16] born. You see how all this works? I got
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; I feel so pressed now. I know the times
[1:41:22] when we got communion coming. Um
[1:41:27] there's so much that goes into these
[1:41:28] names, friend, to understand and so much
[1:41:30] of the scripture that brings it to that
[1:41:33] place.
[1:41:34] U
[1:41:36] you think, "Oh, this this is a horrible
[1:41:38] thing that that uh that they're having
[1:41:41] to make a a a pregnant woman that's
[1:41:45] about to give birth at any time now ride
[1:41:47] on the back of a mule to go over here."
[1:41:49] But they had to do that. If this
[1:41:52] horrible person, if this horrible king
[1:41:55] hadn't put out this edict, they would
[1:41:57] have never left Nazareth and Jesus would
[1:41:59] have been born there. That wouldn't have
[1:42:01] worked because Jesus had to be born in
[1:42:04] the house of God's bread in Bethlehem.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Do you think this horrible person was
[1:42:12] just doing what God put on him to do?
[1:42:16] Yes. God orchestrates somebody like
[1:42:18] that.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bar said he did Hitler
[1:42:22] to drive those Jews back to their
[1:42:24] homeland.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had to put that on Herod to
[1:42:29] drive Joseph and Mary, horrible as it
[1:42:32] was, on the back of that nasty mule with
[1:42:34] her almost about to give birth. Couldn't
[1:42:37] find a place here. Couldn't find a place
[1:42:39] there. They had no place here. They had
[1:42:41] no place there. So where'd they have to
[1:42:42] go? Bethlehem.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; And people say the Bible is fallible.
[1:42:50] And they say that it's contradictory.
[1:42:51] Friend, there is so much in the
[1:42:54] scripture that proves God's divinity
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; and God's uh absolute perfectness is
[1:43:03] just well without revelation you just
[1:43:06] don't know it. You can't see it anyway.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; But he had to be born in the house of
[1:43:11] God's bread in Bethlehem. Brother
[1:43:13] Brandon preached a message. Why little
[1:43:15] Bethlehem?
[1:43:17] Praise the Lord. It's all done that way
[1:43:19] in their position.
[1:43:21] He talks about their position. He talks
[1:43:23] about he I even have a quote here where
[1:43:25] he talked about what we've mentioned
[1:43:27] before with those uh with those women
[1:43:29] and the patriarchs giving birth uh and
[1:43:32] calling out their names and the place
[1:43:33] that their names were was identifying
[1:43:36] how they were in their in their promised
[1:43:38] land. Amen.
[1:43:41] How important those names mean. How
[1:43:43] important a name means. What's in a
[1:43:45] name? What's in your name? What's in our
[1:43:48] name? What's in the name of Christ?
[1:43:50] Amen. I'm not worried about my name. You
[1:43:53] would think, well, I'm almost 60 years
[1:43:56] old. Uh, but how many years ago has it
[1:44:00] been now that I really had identified in
[1:44:02] my earthly name? But I Amen. I took on a
[1:44:05] new name.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; This Jesus.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; All this family in heaven and earth is
[1:44:11] named after that name. And I proudly
[1:44:15] proudly display it and wear it as a
[1:44:18] token of love, appreciation, and uh of
[1:44:22] authority who we are. Who we are in him.
[1:44:26] Amen.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Let's reflect that every day. Let's
[1:44:30] reflect that spirit. Let's reflect that
[1:44:32] power. Let's uh reflect that light every
[1:44:36] day.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; The name of Jesus.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; There's no other name. Amen. No other
[1:44:42] name. Amen.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But the name of Jesus.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's stand if we
[1:44:47] could.
[1:44:49] Amen.
[1:44:52] I did not intend to take that much time,
[1:44:54] but
[1:44:56] Amen. And just uh
[1:44:59] just felt inspired of the Lord.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:05] Praise the Lord. I did not put this on
[1:45:07] the uh tablet. my apologies, but if you
[1:45:10] want to turn over with me as we're going
[1:45:13] to transition over now into uh the
[1:45:16] taking of the Lord's supper
[1:45:29] number 16,
[1:45:31] we sing it. I sing it have ever since I
[1:45:35] pastored. Every time I take communion,
[1:45:38] Psalm
[1:45:39] number 16, first verse.
[1:45:43] Cleanse me, oh Lord.
[1:45:46] This is a showdown, brother B called.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; This Lord suffers a showdown.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; It's a time where again, you say a
[1:45:54] cruise saying of the rubber meets the
[1:45:56] road. This is that time. Amen. We check
[1:45:59] ourselves, make sure there's no
[1:46:01] impediments, there's nothing in our
[1:46:03] heart, there's nothing between us and
[1:46:05] someone else. Amen. that that you could
[1:46:08] do something about. Now, if somebody
[1:46:10] hates you that, you know, I've probably
[1:46:13] got a lot of people that hate me, but uh
[1:46:16] as far as I know in my heart, I've
[1:46:17] cleared everything right with anybody I
[1:46:19] know. And if they still hate me, then
[1:46:21] that's on them, not me.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh as much as we can do to
[1:46:26] live peaceibly with all men, we try to
[1:46:28] do.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if there's anything that we
[1:46:31] feel in our hearts, we try to make it
[1:46:33] right. Praise the Lord. And we do this
[1:46:35] as we sing this We search our hearts,
[1:46:38] amen, as we sing this to make sure that
[1:46:41] mean we're in position, we're in the
[1:46:42] place the Lord, Amen, can use us and
[1:46:45] speak to us and as we take this most
[1:46:48] sacred time of the Lord's supper here.
[1:46:50] So let's sing this. It's Psalm number
[1:46:52] 16, just the first verse. Amen. Search
[1:46:54] me, oh God. Let's sing it.

[1:47:50] me
[1:47:52] from every
[1:47:55] sin
[1:47:57] and set

[1:50:38] there's no impediment. Make sure there's
[1:50:40] no uncleanness, Lord. Make sure there's
[1:50:43] nothing there to hinder between me and
