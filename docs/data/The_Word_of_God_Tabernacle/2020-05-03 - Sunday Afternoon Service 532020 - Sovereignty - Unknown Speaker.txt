the people there in the Fellowship and Lord just love those people so dearly God just bless it now we just commit it to you Lord and ask your blessings upon it may you speak through me I pray God we just commit ourselves to you this congregation in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen thank you god bless you again appreciate each one's comments and questions and thoughts and looking at the midweek there was a a concern Airi a question that was posed to me this week about the midweek service that I had put online that was a little bit long I apologize for that but it was a question about it and I wanted to clarify that to everyone that's watching or anybody else that might see this that when I talked about the the earth of the the States the United States being burned over a border border coast to coast and and the prophecy that we know this is going to be fulfilled this country I was when I was referring to whether the bride was going to be here or not I was I was I was actually being facetious and somebody asked me about that because I know brother madam said that before one bomb Falls or fire falls whatever that the bride is going to be gone I know that I guess I was just unfortunately and I went back and watched it and I can see where the person would feel that way but I unfortunately was probably making light too much of the the people and hopefully understood I was talking about and trying to get the point across that that people try to mold modern events to fit prophecies and that's not the way it's supposed to be the modern events are made clear by the prophecy and not the other way around and I guess I was making light of that thinking how obvious it is that the bride shorter the bride's going to be gone before that happens because it's gonna burn this country completely over so I was being facetious I apologize I can see if somebody's watching it where you got the wrong idea about that and I apologize for that we know absolutely that the bride's gonna be gone before all those things take place and that's one reason not to still believe that the bride is going to be gone even before California sings that's just my opinion in brother Graham doesn't say that but but anyway the calamity and all that's going to ensue in that but we're just thankful that the Lord help us to be ready that's the other point I want to make make sure that we're ready regardless because even if the rapture is not for 10 years he may come and get me today so it's not going to matter to me when the rapture is it becomes against me today what's going to matter to me is how I'm with the Lord right now today and that's what matters and that's what matters to you that's what matters to all of us so that's the most important thing you get that right in your heart and all is well amen but I want to go into the scripture now and get to our subject for this Sunday and again I pray and trust to be a blessing to you again I said it was a thought that I had had to give doing the midweek but it really got a little more involved and longer than I was expecting so I wanted to make it on the Sunday so we'll just do this today so let's go over to Colossians and look at Colossians chapter 1 we're gonna read three verses of Scripture beginning with the fifteenth first so Colossians chapter 15 I guess maybe when I had the chance I should have got both bifocals on I could actually bring this and this at the same time but you bear with me okay Amen Colossians chapter 1 begin with verse 15 amen verse 15 who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature firstborn of every creature think about that the image of the invisible God well one know who that is that's Jesus the image is the expression Jesus was the full expression in bodily form of the of the invisible God and he was the firstborn of every creature he said well Jesus didn't come till four thousand years after creation how could that be well it tells us this wasn't just a man it wasn't the second person in the Godhead this was God Almighty coming in flesh veiling himself to his people so that only those that could see by revelation would know who he was and he still hides himself in the same way he hides himself in the middle of all the trinitarianism and the second person in God heads and things he's still Jesus Christ he still got almighty he's the one in the same he is the expression the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him by him Jesus God same one in the same so you can't separate them we're all the were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether this ever thought of that he's the creation he's the creator of all the things it's visible but the Bible tells us he's the creator of all things that we can't even see any jewels and everything else anything is invisible he created that as well whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him all things visible and invisible were created by him and for him sorry I'm already starting to move our name but all still oh I'm sorry I get a little excited is the reading the scripture the maintance Prince about all things were created by him and for him that's now keep that in mind because that's the one of the most powerful statements here that we want to get to our topic and 17th verse and he is before all things there we go first born very picture and by him all things consist or stand all things to this day still stand or consist of what they are from the beginning of creation when God said let there be when God said let there be it created and created by him and for him and even to this day what he said still stands what he said still is consistent it consists of the moon rising the Sun coming up the trees the grass the birds the animals humans everything consists it continues it still stands today not you know as as God created it and of course it's evolved and changed because of man being on the earth man has changed the way they do things because they had a higher intellect but of course the birds they still harvest and build nests and do everything they did and the animals and botany life and animal life all do exactly consisting zactly the way God created it to be but the point is he created it he created it it was all created by him and for him next like to sit you know people don't believe you God say okay well you just you you make your own grass then you say well we'll take some of this dirt no no no no you can't you can't take the dirt that God has already created create your own dirt create your own see build your own blade of grass see but God did that and you can't people can deny it all they want but the fact is it still consists it's still the same as still here and I want to take that and talk about the sovereignty of God because the sovereignty of God has become so Misun well becoming has been still is so misunderstood by people the sovereignty of God is something that comes to us by revelation a revelation is something that God reveals to you and reveals to his own and he doesn't just reveal it to anybody or everybody he only reveals it to his chosen those who will see it with those who see it they understand that God is sovereign right here it tells us everything was built by him and for Nia and people think they have a better way of doing it people think they have a better way that it should be people think that it should be done this way or you know I have a better idea about this no you don't but people think that they don't understand why certain things happen the way they do in the world and and because of their intellect you know brother Branham even said man would get too smart man will get smarter too smart for their own good to the point that they would even destroy themselves and we see that we're getting to that place people are dying by the hundreds by the thousands because of man and see as man is destroying themselves it becomes so intelligent they think that they have a better idea they have a better way of doing it that God did it but we understand the God's chosen understand by revelation that's why sovereignty is a revelation to understand God is sovereign it was created by him you know what you scientists you think you have a better idea than God you've got to create your own earth and then you can be sovereign over your on earth you can solve it you can do whatever you want and that little world of creation that you create then you can be sovereign you can do it the way you want to do it I didn't want to do it and everything you could do it that way now that's the way they've created treated this Satan's Eden they treated this Satan's eating this won't cause loss like we talked about last week they treated it the way they wanted to they've treated it and and changed and manipulated it and made it to work it fits what they think you wanted they want it to be but if you want to have a better idea than God you think you're more important to better than God then you go create your own world but this world was created by him and for him and he is sovereign in it he is sovereign what is sovereign sovereign is a supreme ruler or the ultimate there's got to be an ultimate in everything and God is the ultimate by revelation and we realize that sovereignty is a revelation and without a revelation you're not going to understand the sovereignty of God is going to think well why did this happen like this or why did these people get this and these didn't I mean just think about the things that people don't understand today how many times you've watched on the news that a storm come through a city tornado or something and and you're looking one house is completely nothing but toothpicks after the tornado rips through that city and the house right next door to it is standing almost perfectly it's like it wasn't even touched not even almost not even like a storm came through but one hand you got one this toothpicks on the other hand you got one that's hardly even touched well I can't explain that I can't begin to understand what that happens people think it would just think about the cruelty virus today thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people may be contracted comes into terms into kovat 19 as they call it but a lot of people contract it well some people don't even show any symptoms at all some people that you wouldn't even know that they even have anything and then the pressure right next to a dies from I explained that you can't explain that it's no ALC it's a bug and it's above my pay grade as this thing goes it's a problem it's above our intellectual conception to understand why God does those things but you know there's things that happen in the world that it's not for us to understand it's not for us to be able to prove or figure out or or scientifically prove it's not for us to do that we just believe in trust in the sovereignty of God by that God has everything under control and he is the supreme ruler he is the supreme authority he is the ultimate just like if you got a ballgame umpire is is the he is the sovereignty of that game if he calls a ball it's a ball I don't care what the picture says I don't care what the pictures coach says sort of the team may come and run all the field doesn't matter according to the officials of the book of the rules of that game that upset a ball it's a ball period there's no interpretation there's no changing it it is a ball he can change his mind but my point is nobody else can change it from a ball to a strike because he is the ultimate he is the sovereign one of that game the judge is that way but now let's get back to to the the perspective of Christianity and and godly living and and in the world the things that go on in the world the things that go on in the world we see that because God is sovereignty sovereign his sovereignty that God is all-powerful God is all-knowing God is omnipotent God is omnipresent God is unchanging God is immutable he's the almighty all-powerful God well because he is that that allowed him to be the creator of this world by him for him he is all-powerful unchanging and because God is sovereign some people don't understand who without a revelation that God does things wrong you've probably heard the story brother Branham talks about a man really killing scoffing about God saying how could God fold his hands over his tummy and and watch those young children mauled to death by lions and ripped in half during the dark ages how could a God set back silent and let all this happen busy and people do the same thing today why can there be a Shriner's why can there be a children's hospitals why could there be P young children dying of cancer because this is first of all like we said this is not our world this is not our cosmos we're creatures of a different place we're Pilgrims and strangers here but it's not ours to understand it's not urges to say well that was unfair well who said it was unfair me what made it unfair my standard God's standard what made it unfair see this is this is we live in God's world he is the one that saw bird God doesn't break the rules God is perfect God is righteous and God is just every decision he makes he makes with with with an attitude err it's hard to use words outside of our human vernacular but he takes the thought process or the attitude that that everything in his mind from now through eternity is perfect as he as he calls it he can't make a mistake God can't have a better thought man does they say they do anyway sometimes I think a lot of the thoughts that come out to seem to be better aren't necessarily better but man does these things change and evolve humanity does but God doesn't so even in God's sovereignty in his almighty all-powerful all-knowing omnipotent unchanging immutable he's just that's why we can trust him because he's just and whatever he does say well when he when he took mine on my wife's son after 36 and a half hours how is that just I I can't figure that out but I do know that my life is in the hands of someone that's far greater than I am I know that my life is in the hands of someone that knows way better than I do his ways are far beyond my ways his thoughts way beyond my thoughts or how could I even begin to pursue to tell God a better way of doing it God created the elephant god created the mouse God created the eagle and God created the hummingbird that's his choice he created the big blue whale and he created the plankton it's his choice the big blue whale eats the plankton the plankton says why can't I be a big blue whale because they've got that make you that way so we all have our purpose to serve but God is the one that is sovereign in adjusting and calling everything as it is in the religious world in the religious world no offense now but in the religious world Catholics believe the Pope is solvent Catholics believe that the Pope is their sovereign deity he is their sovereign ruler whatever the Pope says that's what happens whatever the Pope's opinion is that's what they go by they they change it right and you edict right on you something differents variance from what it used to be and if he says that that's what they live by that's what they go by that's their that's their ultimate that's that's their sovereignties is in that one man when that man dies they put it on in this place and the same thing happens all over again but see we don't put our sovereignty our trust of sovereignty in a man we put our trust of our sovereignty in the Lord Jesus in God and the one who created this you want to ambassador of God on this planet look at those who God has put his spirit in God has put his spirit in those become his ambassadors because they are chosen by him not by man they didn't throw rocks or they didn't add icer or as he did in the Bible but but is God chosen and when God chooses God chooses right and when God chooses right it manifests itself the way it's supposed to I can't explain why one house is destroyed the other one isn't I can't just I can't tell you why one gets a disease doesn't touch him doesn't even hardly affect him at all and the other one dies from it I I can tell you why the things of the Dark Ages and all that derma week had to go on the ground and die so it can come back again but the understanding people say well they don't want to follow what God because of this that and the other well if you want to follow someone something that is unchangeable that doesn't change that is always the same that doesn't die today and come back tomorrow or someone that's unjust or makes a decision about one thing one way this time and another thing about this same thing another time or shows favoritism to this person or that family or something you want somebody you can serve that you can depend on to be immutable unchanging just and faithful and righteous and true that's Jesus Christ the only one that there is let's go to Roman's and my goodness I think I've already ate up my 20 minute myth we now enrollments there's Cub chapter nine Romans chapter nine let's begin with verse 10 it's very familiar scripture reading a lot of people go to it because it's a scripture a lot of people don't understand and I think some people make out of this scripture really things that don't pertain in this scripture but anyway we'll just I might get into that just but let's start with verse 10 Romans chapter 9 verse 10 and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election my extent so whose purpose is this for it's not for Rebecca's it's not for Isaacs his not for Jacob or Esau is not for mine is not for yours not for brother branham's is for gods it's God's purpose far be it for me to try to say that he should have done it different but it was God's purpose that this is done by by God through for God's purpose according to election that the predestination of God the election of God now if you watch this and you don't understand that you have to know that God is all-knowing God knew as we put in our human language the beginning from the end now the to God there is no beginning audience because he's Elohim the self existing never had a beginning or ending but in our word God knew everything beginning to the end so if God knew that then he knew who would and who would not based on the free will that he put in every one of our lives we all have a choice we all have a decision to make in our lives which way we're gonna go who we're gonna choose we're gonna I'm gonna serve the Lord we're gonna serve a big fat guy statue anyway so others but what are we gonna choose what's our decision being agnostic atheist course I don't even believe in atheists sounds ironic doesn't it but don't believe it atheists don't exist because everybody has a God everybody has something that they serve but God's election God's predestination because God knew he could predestinate he could choose his election stood is not of works but as him they call it so it's nothing to either when I'm done is it's not the works that either one of them performed it's not any good deed that anyone could have done of course neither one was even born yet neither and because neither one was even born it had to be of God who called it so God's the one that calls in his sovereignty God chose God decided now he didn't decide just based on well some crazy stuff like we do as humans he basted his decisions based on what he knows what his foreknowledge tells him he knew that Esau was gonna sell his birthright he knew that he saw wasn't gonna value the birthright that he that God had given him he knew that he was going to just sell it out for a mess of pottage II did not mean anything to him and he knew that Jacob was gonna want it so badly and it was gonna mean so much to him that he was even gonna deny even de c.v sought to get it he knew that and because of the desired the man's heart do you think about David looking at Bathsheba David said I'll not put a wicked thing before my eye and then he looks across he sees best Sheba and what happens but God called David a man after his own heart why not because of the act not because of the thing with Bathsheba but because of the man's heart but because of the the men he was a man after his own heart because of his heart he looked into the man's heart and saw what that man really consisted of what he really was it wasn't works but it's God's election God's choosing and in Jacob's heart he desired that birthright it meant more to him than it did Esau and that's why God loved Esau loved Jacob 12 first it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated before either boy was born now people think that's unrighteous Oh God is sovereign he does what he wants you want to tell him something better you want to tell him he should have made the mouse a big old fat gray thing and the elephant a little B no that's his choice he decides what to do and he's righteous in doing it he's righteous than doing it it's amazing today how little accountability people take for their own lives our own actions and decisions and things they say it do it's it's incredible how little responsibility people have it seems like in the world today about the things they do there's no accountability it bleeds over into the religious world like we was talking about it another little thing people prophesy and say things are the one things that dot that I happened he didn't happen aren't even scriptural and then nobody calls him out nobody holds them responsible I'll tell you what is holding them responsible that's God global holds you responsible to everything you think because your thoughts speak before God the new you more powerfully before God then do your words so God knows and that's what matters the most so before either boy was born God said I love Jacob and I'm hate Esau I'm not gonna tell him he should have done it a different way that's his choice with with with a simple molecule he could just draw me off the planet I'd end up spinning in being in hell so ha I'm not going to tell them the better way to do it there's for me to do it that that's God choice what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God god forbid for he said to Moses I will have mercy on who I'll have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion amen praise the Lord that's wonderful Lord I'm thankful his light shine on my pathway one day and I said yes Lord so then it is not a him that willeth nor him that runneth but of God that showeth mercy for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth remember remember think about the sovereignty of God then this I've always wondered now you may have an answer that you've made up and that's fine and I have my own answers of things that are scripturally unanswerable and there's many many things that are unanswerable because we're just human so you may have your own answer but I've always wondered God called Moses and did what he did with Moses not go through the whole story but then God calls and tells Moses to go down and and tell Pharaoh to let his people go Moses old man beard hanging down his belly cricket stick with the wife on them going going down to Egypt to take over Regal Moses I'm going to take over Egypt the most powerful country in the world I'm the most powerful man Pharaoh gonna go take over well how do you plan to do that Moses I don't know God just told me to do it amen it's God song amen God told me to do it I'm gonna go do it but then when Moses goes down there what does God do God doesn't stick Pharaoh under a chair or under a desk God doesn't kill Pharaoh or or diminishes army or anything like that God actually hardens Pharaoh's heart against Moses that's incredible God sends a man and before he can even get there God makes the God makes the thing he's telling him to do even harder to do but that's God God's got a lesson God wanted to make sure that Moses didn't get any glory for this this was all God God can soften the heart and God can harden the heart however God wants it to go he says the leaders and the rulers of our country are his their hearts are in his hand he can do with them as he will because he's sovereign amen but just think about the Pharaoh God sent Moses and then made Moses job even harder than it was Wow thank you or whatever whatever it takes sword we're just gonna believe right we're gonna believe therefore he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy in whom he will he hardeneth that will say then unto me all thus he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will god help us no Lord all huh I never want to do that don't want to resist his will neighbor old man who aren't vowed that requires against God listen this you're a sinner today in your listen you think about this who replies against God you want to come against God it's not a good idea you might flourish you might do great in this world look your soul's gonna be a held accountable shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why has thou made me thus has not the the power the Potter God power over the clay me of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor in another vessel to dishonor isn't he the one that made is like I said you want to be soldered make your own world you want to be sovereign create your own planets create your own universe creates your own galaxies and then you can be sovereign over it don't take God's creation and try to be sovereign over God's creation God is sovereign he does as he will but again what he does he does justly he does right to sleep what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction so think about if God made me and God did because God made all of us we read Colossians all things were created by him for him visible and invisible so if we're made by God so how can I say that if the same block God made one a vessel of Honor one investible dishonor from out of the same womb come the East on Jacob when he loved one he hated before the world boy was born so that the election of God might stand predestination who am I to say that I should have been that one or I should have been put in this position or I should have been given that great place of authority or that great bunch of money or or power or something Who am I to say that I should have been done this or that God made me those he made me the way I am he gave me the parents he gave me he raised me in the home he raised me and the neighborhood he raised me with the friends that I had that the schools that I went to and the teachers that I had to the wife that I got to the children that were born to me that the grandchildren to every facet of my life to this point and the church we have in you precious Saints God is sovereign and all of it it's all according to his plan it's all according to his will now Who am I to say well you know I deserve a have a church with two hundred people in it I don't want to church to two hundred people in it but if God saw fit whatever his will is that's what matters amen because wherever God sends us and whatever God wants us to do he he plans it it's according to his will and he gives us the grace to be able to do it whatever it takes God gives it to us whatever we need to do God is the one that's in charge of it so we can't say one is better and one is not because it's all up to him God is sovereign God is just let's go to a couple of the scriptures before I close visions chapter one maybe we'll get a little bit more than this predestination here the Fijians chapter one you know the gods Paul spoke to the Ephesian Church in a way of greater maturity level than he did to the Corinthians and others but the feasts were were more of a group that was more mature in God so he speaks to them and begins to them about predestination if he's one for by the fourth first Paul is saying according as he hath chosen us in him before what before the foundation of the world before God even laid this foundation out here that we're standing on today before God said let there be he already had established this he already had chosen me in you as a part of him because we were in him as a fall or attribute we were already in him as a part of him and Fred if you were not a part of him then you will not be a part of him now or ever but if we were that soft remember that thought see God God seeks his own counsel God doesn't seek counsel you go read the Bible Hebrews can't remember if I wrote that scripture down but there's no counsel that God does with man God doesn't count some me on it God doesn't say well what do you think no God does it period he is his own counselor he counseled with himself so I for me to say well you know you should have chosen so-and-so or you should have decided this that that God chose me God chose you so if we were that thought in him we were that attribute chosen before the foundation of the world a predestination chokes you then look at this before the foundation of the world God chose elected you well if you were a part of them then you'll be a part of them now you'll always be a part of because that part of you who he is is who you really are that part of God that God placed in these time bodies these human bodies do you want their you won't be there because as God is all-knowing he knew all the way again beginning to end that put us in him that put us in him God knew everybody would be gone but he put us in him by the understanding of free of foreknowledge predestined before the foundation world chosen in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of Newton's will oh no no the Pope's would no it doesn't brother branham's will no it doesn't say that what is it to the good pleasure of his will capital H my Bible doesn't have a capital H but it should be God's will he's a predestinated us to be adopted as sons and daughters of God by Jesus Christ to himself according to his good pleasure not mine not yours a long thankful he did so I take pleasure in it but it wasn't for my purpose wasn't for yours wasn't for my good pleasure let's say that wasn't for my good pleasure he didn't count some me on it he said would you like to know he didn't go to the others would you like to now when God comes into our hearts as we're born into this world God comes to every person and gives every person the opportunity and they decide and choose whether they're going to accept him as their Savior or not that's their choice God knocks on every door God knocks on every heart and everyone has that choice but God knew my predestination so that those who would accept he adopted into his family he placed them in his family eight men were placed in his family that's the purpose that God has put for us to serve on this earth and is for his good pleasure we serve at his good pleasure to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through the blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he had abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to this according to his good pleasure he revealed it to us according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself it's in him that he purposed it that in the dispensation of the fullness of times or during that time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both of which in heaven which are on earth even in him that goes right over to our Colossians reading when we talk about everything being inyoung everything was in him by him for him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will he worketh all things how after the counsel of his own will he didn't counsel me he counseled brother Anton it's gonna przemek order to but it's for you to get the point without it to understand brother Graham said Who am I to tell him what to do he talked about getting in the prayer line he said I could tell what God can tell god what to do people come up from prayer line in brother man it's like do y'all I do it but I can't tell god what to do if you come with this prayer line I can't say God kill this person now you better deal only you can't tell what to do that's his choice some people come up on the platform you got healed and some people didn't explain it it's not to be explained to be believed accepted God I understand I accept it maybe it was my fault maybe I didn't have the faith I needed maybe I my heart wasn't right with the Lord or something I don't know but but I do know that he has everything and everything is done perfect and right by him and and all things work after the counsel of his own will he only counsels with himself that we should be to the praise of the glory who first trusted in Christ that is who God made us that is who God has chosen us to be that's our purpose in life and it was God's choice to do it it wasn't our choice is God's way of doing it if man thinks he has a better way people lean on education people lean on medicine people lean on science people you know politics people lean on their wealth or their fame or their fortune their popularity people probably some peak church people lean on other things or ministers on their big congregation or something what but everybody leans on something everybody is like I said there's no such thing as an atheist everybody has a God there's something that everybody leans on something that everybody puts first in their lives and what they trust in but you take the sum total of all those things and add them all up and you don't have a drop it's like it's like a drop a drop of water in the Pacific Ocean to who God is and what God's sovereignty is to us it means absolutely nothing you take the total sum of every bit of science medicine politics education you add it all and put it in one big huge lump and it's not one drop out of the dropper indict the Pacific Ocean to who God is science say they have what is perfect they have the solution they have the only thing that can meet the challenge friend the only thing that can meet today's challenge is God the only one that can meet today's challenge it's not a scientist is not a doctor I'm thankful for what God helps him do but it's God God's you're the one that can meet this challenge and he meets that challenge in our lives individually every day that's the only way that we're able to do it it's the only thing that gets us there things that science said a hundred years ago was foolproof is is old news today scientists themselves will tell you that it's always constantly going from one place to the next or opening this door or something changing over here and building a new instrument or a new gadget to to do something that wouldn't do before God knew all that God created it God created six gods God is the best scientist ever been because not jaded the science dogs the best doctors ever been because God created the body he knows how it was made he knows everything about it he's the one who created it oh praise the Lord I'm thankful that even if we look at God as being that sovereign God remember that sovereignties by revelation that sovereign God God makes a way for each one of us let's go to one more scripture in Psalms 94 I read this one more scripture to you will close here just in a moment amen sums chapter 94 we'll begin with verse 3 Psalms 94 and 3 look at this now somes 94 3 Lord even even David look at David thinking about this Lord how long shall the wicked how long shall the wicked triumph you thinking David even in himself he's thinking well he's looking over here and he's watching the wicked people the ungodly people the people that maybe even leading other people astray and he caused them wicked and he says how long are they going to prosper so apparently even in David in his heart and in his reasoning thinking God these wicked people are prospering so greatly these wicked people are leading others astray how long are they going to continue to prosper how about are they going to continue to what we look like it would be called be blessed how about Lord David even himself see that's God's working God does that for a reason you understand that God has ministers out there today to drop people into error just as good as this as much as he has ministers out there to draw people into righteousness and those people serve their purpose just like God godly people served their purpose just like the God called ministers served their purpose the man called minister serves their purpose it's nothing out that God doesn't know or gods not allowing gonna miles all this for a reason it's all for a purpose you can't fool and you can't drop out the believer all the father has given will come and even if someone that is called is where they shouldn't be they will be where they're supposed to be eventually because God's called it and God's calling no man-made Damas going to keep on because thoughts called and the only thing when they finally get to that realization they're going to be able to feed on is equal food is this revealed word of the outer that's the only thing they're going to be able to feed on and when they realize they're in the chicken yard they're going to get to the places but see even in the chicken yard that chicken yard is serving its purpose David is saying why how long Lord how long shall the wicked triumph obviously the wicked were trying and he's questioning why how are they being so blessed and prosperous how long shall they triumph how long shall they are and speak hard things and all the workers of iniquity boasts themselves they break in pieces by people Oh Lord and afflict done heritage they slay the widow and the stranger and murder the fatherless yet they say the Lord shall not see neither shall the God of Jacob regarded soon obviously these are wicked people doing wicked things apparently as it would look to us prospering as David was saying they're prospering in that how can they be prospering when they're doing such wicked things because God has a reason for everything don't you think for a home that God didn't create Lucifer a God created Lucifer can you not think for just a moment that in creating Lucifer he knew what Lucifer was going to become and do well sure he did and he created in any way do you not know that when think that when God created man and woman he created man and woman with reproductive organs in their bodies already even though that wasn't his perfect will for procreation but he did it anyway know that there would be a fall and that there would be a need for procreation by man a woman he knew that he knew the fall was gonna happen he knew these things were going to take place he created it because there had to be a purpose see if there wasn't a devil how would we ever be sick well if we're never sick you think well wonderful I never want to be sick who wants to be sick the ones that grow the virus no nobody wants to but if you never sick how do you know how good it is to be well how do you know God as a healer if you never were sick if he wasn't a fall in the Garden of Eden you became lost born in iniquity how would you ever know what salvation is about how would you know who your Savior is Jesus Christ if there wasn't a father if there wasn't an anti-type to the type then how could we ever realize how precious the type is to is how the real is to us there's always a counterfeit but if there's a counterfeit there's always a real because if there's not a real the counterfeit came off up than the counterfeit side see the real because it was the original but if there's an original there's a counterfeit but there's a counterfeit that this shows that the real is genuine and the genuine God the sovereign God is real in his sovereign grace in his sovereign mercy and his sovereign love he is it to who he will and how dare I the clay tell the potter how to make me how to shape me how to mold me how dare I'd the clay tell God you are rough when you did this you're wrong when you went there you were wrong when you've got this person in how could you have saved Paul an assault was a murder how could you have saved him that was a bad decision you just should have stuck with Mathias that's what the church chose the church chose Mathias God you should have just kept my pious and forget about this Saul character no we always think we have a better way of doing it don't we I always think we have a better idea always think we have the solution we always think we have the right way there's only one right way and that's God's Way and the only one that's going to know that right way is those who's in tune and connected with him those who have his spirit and those who are connected to him we can't figure some of these things out I'll probably never and not that I need to or want to figure out why the Lord took our son three within a day and a half and many tragedies things that we consider tragedies on this earth but it's like I told you a few weeks ago and I think one of the mid weeks you know we shudder when little children might have problems or die or something like that but you know those little children go into the presence of the Lord they're going to be there those children go to heaven so would it would it been better that they grow up and become a drug dealer or something than to be with the Lord not saying that would have been a drug dealer but you understand see the sovereignty of God why does God do it we may never understand a lot of the things and purposes a reason why God does things you know there's a little song that says we'll understand it better by and by maybe we will maybe we won't I think if we decide to or want to we might could I think we get on the other side we're probably just not gonna care we're just gonna be thankful to be there be there with one another be there with our loved ones family be there with the Lord Jesus the one who saved me by His grace I think that's gonna be the main theme of our hearts and lives at that point when we get to that place God is sovereign friend anybody tries to come with some scientific proof or education medicine or something to say that they're better they're more important or they got a better father a better way of doing it they're a liar only God he's sovereign he created this place is created by him and for him and we're here for his purpose we're here to do his will not ours be led by his spirit not our purpose or not our fault amen I'm thankful and I'm thankful he is I'm thankful he is sovereign I'm thankful he does make the decision and he does make it the way he wants it to be according to his good pleasure because I could be really lost if he didn't sometimes it's hard sometimes it's not easy sometimes it grates the flesh so hard you think Lord how when but God has a way God has a purpose if you've ever been through one of those you know what it is you've come through it and we've come out better on the other side God just does what he tries to do to keep us close to him to keep us more like him so thanks let me implore you again let's not let this separation be a permanent thing let it not be something that grips us to become more lazy but more a student and thinking of how wonderful it's going to be when we get back together again and were more in fellowship again with one another and back in church and I can look at your beautiful faces ministering and hear the amens and the hands raising and all the great things and fellowship afterwards and I'd love to have a meal next Sunday for Mother's Day but you know there's a reason for also but just keep that on your heart continue to read your Bible pray seek the Lord let God be your portion you'll continue to do so amen appreciate the Lord you love him today God so good to us I appreciate each one coming by and seeing and seeing you the Sonia visiting and different things like that we love you appreciate you all so much there's anything we can ever do for you please let us know amen and I pray this was a blessing to you today somehow and just continue to pray and would just look to the Lord for the next guidance and deliverance and whatever his decision is for us to go from here so appreciate you love you all amen and if you need anything let us know God richly bless you have a great day Sonia says that let's pray so we're gonna order ended prayer Lord Jesus we thank you father for blessing us today thank you Lord for your hand upon our lives and for being with each one of us God may you just bless those that watch today and God may you just speak to our hearts Lord and draw us closer to you may we understand and be revealed to us father the sovereignty of who you are and the realization that you are in our lives and in this world and regardless of what man may say what the world or science or education may say Lord you are the number one you are the ultimate you are the absolute God we hold you as such I pray that you bless our Congress and congregation richly Lord keep them in your hands and bless them Lord through this week father help us to stay faithful as we come through this trying time now and we commit ourselves to you I commit them to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you [Music]
