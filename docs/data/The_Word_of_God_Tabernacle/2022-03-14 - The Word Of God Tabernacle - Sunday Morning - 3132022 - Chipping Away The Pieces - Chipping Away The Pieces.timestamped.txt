[35:37] his ways better higher better than our
[35:40] ways
[35:41] amen
[35:42] it's beyond all human understanding
[35:45] the world has tried to search for
[35:47] thousands of years
[35:48] what love is about meaning of love
[35:51] and they haven't even begun to scratch
[35:53] the surface
[35:54] even us as christians recognizing the
[35:57] love of god in our lives
[35:59] just barely scratches the surface
[36:02] amen if we can think about what the lord
[36:05] just did for us personally
[36:07] amen
[36:08] and how the depth of that love and how
[36:11] deep it would go there it's a bottomless
[36:14] amen
[36:15] praise the lord jesus
[36:16] he loves us amen beyond any
[36:19] understanding that we could have yes
[36:21] praise the lord jesus and i'm so
[36:23] thankful for that aren't you amen praise
[36:26] the lord
[36:27] amen god bless you gentlemen
[36:29] today amen
[36:31] welcome good to see our tribe come in
[36:34] amen lord bless you
[36:35] we're going to go in the scripture now
[36:38] if you want to stand with me and turn in
[36:41] your bibles
[36:43] we're going to go over to
[36:45] isaiah chapter 64.
[36:50] amen isaiah chapter 64.
[36:58] praise the lord jesus
[37:01] some people just
[37:03] can't grasp
[37:05] the things that god does
[37:07] they don't make sense to us
[37:10] they're not sensible
[37:12] but they do to him
[37:15] sometimes the hardest things we have in
[37:17] life are the best things that we can
[37:20] that the lord can do for us
[37:22] that's why we trust him
[37:24] that's why we trust him because he knows
[37:27] best
[37:28] but it's like that song said
[37:30] even through the darkest of the valleys
[37:34] through that valley gives me the
[37:36] strength to be able to climb the next
[37:38] mountain
[37:39] i wouldn't make it to the peak of the
[37:40] next mountain if it wasn't for the trial
[37:43] of the valley
[37:44] amen that's where we draw our strength
[37:46] from
[37:49] praise the lord
[37:50] isaiah chapter 64. we're going to read a
[37:52] couple of verses of scripture
[37:55] amen
[37:57] thought came to me during the week this
[37:59] week and
[38:01] i feel like the lord put something
[38:03] together for us today so trust it be a
[38:05] blessing to you
[38:06] amen isaiah 64 read a couple of verses
[38:08] of description before we do let's just
[38:10] power our heads for a word of prayer
[38:13] and lord jesus father truly our greatest
[38:16] strength does come through our darkest
[38:18] trials
[38:19] the inspired
[38:20] person that wrote that lord is truly a
[38:23] revelation to us today
[38:25] we thank you lord for all that you do
[38:27] for us every day god and so many times
[38:30] we we do fail to thank you for the for
[38:33] the trials that we go through for
[38:35] sometimes what we would deem as a dark
[38:37] hour
[38:38] or something that's hard on our flesh
[38:41] lord but god many times the things that
[38:44] you do for us is to mold us and to shape
[38:46] us and to put us in the image that you
[38:48] want us to be and the likeness that you
[38:50] would have for us and that likeness is
[38:52] you
[38:53] the only way we can do that is to have
[38:54] the mount the mind of christ and to mold
[38:57] our flesh to mold our spirits to mold us
[39:00] into that image that lord we might
[39:02] reflect that today to let the world see
[39:05] that the love of god to us is shot
[39:07] abroad in our hearts reflected to this
[39:09] world to show that you are still jesus
[39:12] christ the same yesterday today and
[39:14] forever
[39:15] we thank you lord for that time we thank
[39:17] you for uh the blessings that you give
[39:19] us lord so many times and lord that that
[39:22] that does mean the things that sometimes
[39:24] are difficult to us sometimes the things
[39:26] we don't understand
[39:28] but believe that you have all things in
[39:30] your hands and all things are working
[39:32] together for our good because we love
[39:35] you
[39:36] the only way that that would work is
[39:38] because we do love you not because we
[39:40] have some
[39:41] affinity for you lord are we your good
[39:44] god today and not tomorrow or i serve
[39:46] you today or not tomorrow no no no it's
[39:49] it's an unconditional love that we have
[39:51] for you god it's a sharing back of that
[39:54] unconditional love that you have for us
[39:56] and that unconditional love brings us
[39:58] into a place of believing god the
[40:01] unchanging god that you work everything
[40:04] for our good
[40:05] we thank you for it lord we pray god
[40:08] that you bless the remaining part of
[40:09] this service have your
[40:11] way in it lord we committed to you speak
[40:14] through this speaker these lips lord
[40:16] hear with the ears of each one of us
[40:18] today accomplish that that you would
[40:20] send it forth for father as we committed
[40:23] to you and it is for truly your glory
[40:25] and honor and we thank you god for all
[40:27] these that have come those who may be
[40:29] streaming lord may you be the focal
[40:32] point of everything that we do and say
[40:33] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[40:35] pray
[40:36] amen amen
[40:38] amen isaiah 64 read beginning with verse
[40:42] six read a couple verses let you be
[40:44] seated but we are all as an unclean
[40:47] thing
[40:48] and all our righteousnesses are as
[40:51] filthy rags
[40:53] and we all do fade as a leaf and our
[40:56] iniquities like the wind have taken us
[40:59] away
[41:00] and there is none that calleth upon
[41:02] thine name that
[41:04] stireth up himself to take hold of thee
[41:08] for thou has hid thy face from us and
[41:10] has consumed us because of our
[41:13] iniquities
[41:14] but now oh lord
[41:16] thou art our father
[41:18] we are the clay and thou art our potter
[41:21] and we are all
[41:22] and we all are the work of thy hand
[41:26] you can be seated if you like
[41:30] and as i was going through the lord was
[41:32] giving me scripture thing yesterday i
[41:34] ran into so many
[41:37] ways to title this so many titles that
[41:39] it could be
[41:41] but i stuck with the thought that the
[41:43] lord originally gave me during the week
[41:45] this week and so i'm going to title this
[41:47] today chipping away the pieces
[41:50] chipping away the pieces the thought of
[41:52] that that came to me during this week
[41:54] that uh that
[41:57] that at the end time and we know we all
[41:59] believe we're at the end time i believe
[42:01] we all believe we're at the end of the
[42:02] end time that
[42:04] how much time we have left is hard to
[42:06] determine we don't know
[42:08] my time might be up today and that's all
[42:10] that really matters to me
[42:11] is when i'm going but the time is at
[42:14] hand that we know that a rapture is
[42:16] about to take place in a wholesale uh uh
[42:19] exiting
[42:20] exodus of a group of people is going to
[42:23] be with the lord jesus the world will
[42:25] will be without us any longer and
[42:28] it came to me that i started thinking
[42:31] about that story that uh that brother
[42:34] random told a couple of places and of
[42:35] course is documented if you go and look
[42:38] it up on the internet you find this
[42:39] documented of where it was asked
[42:43] about the sculptures that michelangelo
[42:45] did the paintings at michelangelo dibus
[42:47] specifically the sculptures and he
[42:49] talked about david he talked about moses
[42:52] it was specifically when it was asked
[42:54] about david but i believe it would apply
[42:57] to as he did david and he did moses and
[42:59] these beautiful sculptures you ever seen
[43:01] the picture of them just outstanding i
[43:04] it just baffles the mind to me anyway
[43:06] someone who is uh who is devoid of any
[43:10] kind of creativity uh when i look at it
[43:13] and i think how could somebody
[43:16] take a huge hunk of rock and make that
[43:18] out of it it just it baffles me it's
[43:21] just incredible or take a a flat nothing
[43:24] black wall or canvas or something and
[43:26] and paint something so outstandingly
[43:29] realistic and beautiful and uh
[43:32] my wife can do that it just it just
[43:34] baffles me how people are that gifted
[43:36] that god gives them and can do and so it
[43:39] was asked
[43:40] david is his sculptures are just so
[43:43] beautiful and just so perfect and
[43:45] detailed it was asked to him uh you know
[43:49] how how did you ever
[43:51] get in your mind what david looked like
[43:53] or how did you ever get it in your mind
[43:56] how moses looked like to because we
[43:58] don't have pictures of them and we don't
[44:00] know what their images are it just has
[44:02] to be something that that was derived
[44:04] out of someone's mentality out of
[44:06] someone's thought out of someone's heart
[44:09] and it was asked how did you derive
[44:11] these of of what you felt like a moses
[44:14] looked like or what you felt like a
[44:16] david would look like and how did you
[44:18] take this big
[44:20] huge hunk of marble and just and just
[44:23] cute it all out and chiseled all the way
[44:26] to where this beautiful sculpture comes
[44:28] up and none of us know what david or
[44:30] moses looked like but we look at it now
[44:32] we identify that as david
[44:34] we look at that and we identify that as
[44:37] moses what what did uh what inspired you
[44:40] to to knock away and chip away all those
[44:42] pieces to bring those images to life he
[44:45] said that's easy now i'm paraphrasing of
[44:48] course he didn't say that
[44:50] but but let me just paraphrase a little
[44:53] bit that's easy
[44:55] he said david was always in the marble
[44:57] all i did was chip away the pieces
[45:01] moses was always in the marble all i did
[45:04] was chip away the pieces
[45:06] all i did was knock out
[45:09] everything that wasn't david
[45:12] all i did was knock out every piece of
[45:15] marble that wasn't moses
[45:17] and when i knocked every piece of marble
[45:19] out that wasn't moses
[45:21] there was moses
[45:23] when i knocked out every piece of marble
[45:25] that wasn't david there was david
[45:28] praise the lord now see
[45:30] when you get inspired about things like
[45:32] that it really gives you a little
[45:34] revelation especially when you have uh
[45:37] i'm it works i got to be careful
[45:38] sometimes because i handle hot wires and
[45:41] and i get excited sometimes when things
[45:43] like that and thoughts like that come to
[45:45] me not to
[45:46] cross some wires and end up myself a
[45:49] statue but
[45:51] uh so i have to be careful sometimes
[45:54] because when things like that hit it
[45:56] just excites you it excites me anyway
[45:59] and when it's just when it's hit i
[46:01] thought that's exactly it see because
[46:04] that's that that's god
[46:06] god had in his mind the image of you
[46:10] and the image of me yes and all that
[46:13] we've gone through this life
[46:15] all that god is doing for us is just
[46:18] chipping away the pieces that are that
[46:20] that was not the image that god has in
[46:23] his mind
[46:24] that's what we're going through this
[46:27] shall i say refining time
[46:29] where uh the chisel comes out and then
[46:32] maybe a polishing rag or or a sander or
[46:35] something to finish up the last details
[46:39] and see i believe that's exactly what's
[46:41] going on today
[46:42] a lot of times when a sculptor or a
[46:44] painter or
[46:46] or or even when you're doing a job or
[46:48] making a piece of furniture or painting
[46:50] a wall or something you'll go around
[46:53] after you're done and you'll look at it
[46:54] and you and you find a little spot
[46:57] you find a little default or a a little
[47:01] a mistake that you made or something and
[47:03] you go and you fine tune it so that it
[47:05] so that it really comes into the way
[47:08] it's supposed to look like a painting or
[47:11] or a piece of furniture or something or
[47:13] an automobile or or something that
[47:15] you're working on or something
[47:17] there's always a fine tuning that's to
[47:20] be done
[47:21] all those chipping away
[47:23] all that that god's chipping away in our
[47:26] lives is just bringing into the image
[47:29] that he already had in his mind
[47:32] you were already there saints to
[47:35] understand this now like
[47:38] like we've said before
[47:40] uh
[47:41] like the prodigal son the prodigal son
[47:44] was a son
[47:46] he was never not a son
[47:49] he was always a son
[47:51] from birth in his father's lords he was
[47:54] always a son and nothing he did
[47:58] changed that amen amen nothing he did
[48:02] change that he was always a son
[48:05] in god's mind you were always there yes
[48:08] god just had to chip away the pieces
[48:11] that's not you am i that's not that
[48:14] image of you that god made now i'm not
[48:16] talking about the flesh the the spirit
[48:19] of i'm talking about the real you that
[48:21] god's seen you before the foundation of
[48:24] the world
[48:26] god's just chipping all that god just
[48:28] he's just chipping away anything that's
[48:30] not you right getting rid of anything
[48:33] that's not you because we collect
[48:35] baggage friends we know that as we're
[48:37] young and we grow up and we're raised
[48:39] and
[48:40] and we're taught things and we learn
[48:42] things and we pick up baggage here we
[48:44] pick up baggage there
[48:46] and our humanity and our carnality like
[48:48] brother dennis prayed we gather all this
[48:51] baggage up and it comes to time where
[48:53] there's got to be a way to to get rid of
[48:56] all that stuff that we form into the
[48:58] image that god already had in his mind
[49:02] it's not a miracle to say that i'm being
[49:06] molded and shaped into the image of god
[49:09] i'm the clay he's the potter right it's
[49:11] not a miracle at that it's just that
[49:15] just like michelangelo god is just
[49:17] taking away everything in our lives that
[49:20] isn't us
[49:22] that isn't of that image that god had in
[49:25] his mind
[49:26] and if god chips it away then it's a
[49:29] necessity for it not to be there
[49:32] there's a reason why it's not supposed
[49:34] to be there if god's chipping away
[49:36] certain things in our lives whatever it
[49:38] is amen we all have
[49:40] again baggage
[49:42] things that tags along in our lives that
[49:45] that hinders us from reaching a certain
[49:47] level maybe or a certain place with the
[49:49] lord jesus or something like that god
[49:52] god comes and starts chipping those
[49:54] things away
[49:55] and getting rid of those things so that
[49:57] we're only we are only the image that
[50:01] god had in his mind before the world
[50:04] and he does that to all of us
[50:06] the bride worldwide
[50:08] when it gets to that image
[50:10] just like michelangelo did with moses
[50:13] and moses became so in the mind of
[50:16] michelangelo
[50:18] and he became so perfectly in that image
[50:21] he struck him on the knee with a hammer
[50:23] and said speak moses
[50:26] a piece of marble
[50:28] he expected a piece of marble to speak
[50:32] now you know sometimes
[50:34] really good artists kind of live on the
[50:37] edge of insanity
[50:39] amen that's why they cut off their ears
[50:41] and things like that
[50:43] this really good artists will live on
[50:46] the edge of insanity
[50:48] i think a really good artist is a very
[50:50] is a very spiritual person in a lot of
[50:53] ways and and someone who's in that in
[50:56] that place
[50:57] that they're they're
[50:59] between sanity insanity and we call it
[51:02] insanity but if you're a christian and
[51:04] you're a godly holy ghost spilled person
[51:06] that just takes you into a gift of the
[51:08] spirit
[51:10] it doesn't make you crazy people in the
[51:12] world think you're crazy but it doesn't
[51:14] make you crazy but if you're not and
[51:16] you're just a
[51:18] everyday person or like a michelangelo
[51:20] or someone not a born-again christian
[51:22] it'll tip you right over into a place of
[51:24] insanity
[51:26] it will and these places people get to
[51:28] that place
[51:29] and
[51:31] and for someone to have finished that
[51:33] sculpture and took years and whatever it
[51:37] did to get rid of all the pieces that
[51:39] wasn't moses
[51:40] and then to as people would say ruin it
[51:43] by chipping the knee out which brother
[51:46] adam always said was what made it the
[51:48] masterpiece to him but chipping that
[51:50] piece of that knee out and saying speak
[51:53] moses
[51:54] well that's probably just that
[51:56] that that man
[51:58] that guilt that had
[52:00] had just teetered over into the place of
[52:03] insanity
[52:05] whacking a piece of marble on the knee
[52:07] and saying speak
[52:11] it wasn't without divine intervention
[52:13] that marble was not going to speak
[52:16] now could it sure god they could speak
[52:18] just like you did the donkey just like
[52:20] he could anything amen god speaks every
[52:23] day through stuff and a lot of times we
[52:24] don't pay any attention but god's always
[52:27] speaking
[52:28] god's always talking god talked to
[52:30] brother branham through squirrels and
[52:31] fish and everything else god speaks to
[52:33] us all the time and he could have
[52:35] whacked him on the knee he could have
[52:36] spoken but uh it was it had it it had
[52:40] just come to such a reality
[52:44] it that that image
[52:46] that reflection that he that michael
[52:50] michelangelo had in his mind
[52:52] in his heart
[52:54] that image that he had been
[52:56] contemplating on and working on for
[52:58] years had finally come to manifestation
[53:01] it was there in front of him to the
[53:03] point that that image
[53:06] that all the pieces finally got chipped
[53:08] away
[53:09] that came into that image that he
[53:12] smelled it to say speak
[53:16] amen amen i believe god's got a bride
[53:19] yes that he's bringing into his own
[53:21] image amen he's chipping away all of the
[53:24] pieces yes and now that holy spirit is
[53:27] coming into our lives saying speak
[53:30] amen now that stroke
[53:34] is brought upon a group of people
[53:36] that not only are able to
[53:39] but have the authority and the right and
[53:42] the responsibility
[53:44] to speak that's right
[53:46] that is us today
[53:48] we have that right
[53:50] we have that ability and we in my
[53:53] opinion have the responsibility
[53:55] to be speaking today speaking what the
[53:58] word amen amen amen is that time brother
[54:02] brown preached 1963 souls in prison
[54:05] there's that time where there's a
[54:07] ministry going forth that is to the
[54:10] total loss
[54:12] when jesus died of calgary and went to
[54:14] hell he preached to the souls that were
[54:17] in prison
[54:18] he preached to those that were in hell
[54:20] that were eternally doomed and had no
[54:23] hope
[54:24] he preached to the souls that were there
[54:26] in prison yes amen and what's happened
[54:29] today
[54:31] now brother graham said over and over
[54:33] how many times and
[54:35] and when will it be
[54:37] but it will be yes
[54:39] that time
[54:41] where there will be a speaking to the
[54:42] souls that are in prison that have no
[54:45] hope yes they have no chance
[54:48] amen now
[54:50] again we we i never we never want to get
[54:53] in our minds that that this is that time
[54:56] we don't know but we do know there's a
[54:58] time and or that that this time is that
[55:01] time that we are to speak
[55:04] to speak that word not be silent but
[55:06] speak but of course we speak as he
[55:08] speaks
[55:09] and silent where he's silent that's the
[55:11] scripture we know that that's where a
[55:13] lot of times people get in trouble they
[55:15] want to just go do something well that's
[55:17] okay that that zeal is beautiful that's
[55:20] wonderful because there's so many people
[55:22] that just rather sit on the sea to do
[55:24] nothing but the wisdom behind it
[55:27] amen is is what's most paramount the
[55:31] wisdom behind
[55:33] when you speak what you speak who you
[55:35] speak to
[55:37] but the ability
[55:39] and the responsibility is there
[55:41] for us to speak the holy spirit is now
[55:43] striking the bride it is our time it's
[55:46] the bride time this is the bright hour
[55:49] that god has given us for us to speak
[55:52] amen to speak the word
[55:54] the revealed word of the hour that
[55:56] others may know what the truth of that
[55:58] word is now whether a person accepts it
[56:01] or not is their choice but that doesn't
[56:03] negate us speaking that word amen speak
[56:08] amen
[56:09] god still
[56:11] chipping away those pieces
[56:13] look this i i went ahead and printed
[56:16] this out
[56:17] god's only provided place of worship
[56:23] where brother graham tells one of the
[56:25] one of the places he talks about the
[56:26] story here
[56:29] he talks about going to los angeles at
[56:31] forest lawn i guess where the statue of
[56:33] moses is
[56:35] michelangelo it's the perfect statue
[56:38] he said all but on the right knee
[56:40] there's a nick about a half inch deep
[56:43] i was looking and pointed it out to me
[56:45] he said michelangelo has spent a
[56:47] lifetime of trying to make
[56:49] uh he was a sculptor trying to make an
[56:53] image of moses
[56:55] back in his mind he had in his mind what
[56:58] moses should look like
[57:00] he had that in his heart what moses
[57:02] should look like and then he spent his
[57:04] lifetime
[57:06] chiseling a little here rubbing a little
[57:08] there stand back and look at it year
[57:10] after year after year he worked on it
[57:13] finally when it was completed he stepped
[57:16] back and laid his big rag on his uh uh
[57:19] his hammer
[57:21] and his hammer and looked at the statue
[57:24] it was such a perfect image of moses
[57:27] that he had it in his heart till he got
[57:29] so beside himself he grabbed a hammer
[57:32] and struck it and hollered speak
[57:35] amen
[57:37] it's called michelangelo's masterpiece
[57:40] the great something in that sculpture
[57:42] that vision that he had of what moses
[57:45] ought to be
[57:47] he was only portraying it look a great
[57:50] portrayal
[57:51] of our father
[57:53] a portraying of our father who in his
[57:56] mind had that image of you
[57:59] what you should be
[58:00] who you should be what kind of person
[58:02] you should be
[58:03] amen how we sh how close we should be to
[58:06] god we talked about last week the lord
[58:09] calling closer well the way to get
[58:11] closer in that image the only way to get
[58:14] closer to god is to come more in that
[58:15] image right and the only way to come
[58:18] more in that image is for more pieces to
[58:20] get chipped away
[58:22] when more pieces get chipped away we
[58:24] come more into that image we come more
[58:26] into his likeness then the shadow
[58:28] becomes more in the real all the time
[58:31] amen
[58:32] it doesn't look much like a hand when
[58:34] it's out here but when it gets right
[58:35] here the closer it gets the more it
[58:37] comes into that image
[58:38] and that shadow becomes more into the
[58:40] likeness of the real thing
[58:42] well that's what god is coming bringing
[58:44] it closer getting rid of anything that's
[58:47] not us amen just getting rid of the
[58:50] pieces
[58:51] so that we come into that very image
[58:53] that very likeness
[58:55] winning wing it away getting a win uh
[58:58] getting uh getting it away from us amen
[59:00] we are
[59:01] that perfect image that god had in his
[59:04] mind
[59:05] you believe that
[59:06] we are that perfect image that god had
[59:08] in his mind
[59:09] i believe that i am that perfect image
[59:11] now satan wants to try to defeat you
[59:13] with all the things you do wrong and all
[59:15] the mistakes you've made in your life
[59:16] and all the things you come up short on
[59:18] the sins and the iniquities and all this
[59:20] other stuff just like uh isaiah said
[59:23] here oh god and our iniquities have
[59:26] drove us away like the wind
[59:28] but you oh god or our father amen you
[59:32] are the one who is the potter of this
[59:34] clay you are the one that molds us and
[59:36] makes us into the image that you desire
[59:39] for us to be
[59:40] amen now some people could look and say
[59:43] well it's it's it's making it what it
[59:46] what it wants to be well michelangelo
[59:47] just said it was always there i just got
[59:49] rid of what wasn't it
[59:51] amen i prefer that yet myself amen just
[59:56] getting rid of everything that's not god
[59:58] right saint john chapter 15.
[1:00:04] so don't let the devil defeat you that
[1:00:05] way since amen amen don't let him defeat
[1:00:08] don't let him defeat your faith like
[1:00:10] that
[1:00:11] that's the one thing that wants to
[1:00:12] defeat your faith
[1:00:14] defeat you from believing who you are
[1:00:17] because if you don't believe who you are
[1:00:19] you can't believe who he is right
[1:00:21] because the two are one
[1:00:23] and that image that god had this
[1:00:25] bringing together the two becoming one
[1:00:28] again if satan can defeat you in that
[1:00:31] and get you looking at the at the
[1:00:33] frailty of your flesh in the mirror
[1:00:36] then we'll fall short right amen don't
[1:00:39] look at that look at the mirror of god's
[1:00:41] word yes amen god's word
[1:00:44] saint john chapter 15.
[1:00:47] let's go at it this way now saint john
[1:00:49] 15 1
[1:00:50] i am the true vine
[1:00:52] and my father is the husbandman
[1:00:55] every branch in me that bringeth not
[1:00:58] fruit he taketh away
[1:01:00] okay so that's number one
[1:01:02] every branch that beareth not every well
[1:01:05] listen this every branch in me
[1:01:09] notice that
[1:01:11] jesus said every branch in me
[1:01:15] that beareth not fruit he taketh it away
[1:01:21] so what is he what is he referring to
[1:01:24] you think well if that's
[1:01:27] if
[1:01:27] if that's somebody that's in christ why
[1:01:30] would he take it away
[1:01:34] you ever thought of that
[1:01:36] because jesus said every branch that's
[1:01:39] in me
[1:01:40] in him
[1:01:42] amen
[1:01:43] you notice there's a lot of people
[1:01:45] around the world
[1:01:47] that claim to be christians that call on
[1:01:50] the name jesus that say they believe him
[1:01:53] as the ultimate almighty god
[1:01:56] but yet they don't live for him they
[1:01:58] don't serve him right they don't uh
[1:02:01] preach or believe his
[1:02:02] the word
[1:02:04] well those people are people that would
[1:02:07] claim to be in christ but they're not so
[1:02:10] they're not bearing the fruits of the
[1:02:11] word if they're not bearing the fruits
[1:02:13] of the word then god gets rid of them
[1:02:16] they're not a part of the family oh yeah
[1:02:19] they still continue on
[1:02:21] but they're not a part of the family
[1:02:23] right they're not a part of of christ
[1:02:26] they're not bearing the fruits of god if
[1:02:28] they're not burying the fruits then
[1:02:29] they're not of him
[1:02:32] and if they're not bearing fruits
[1:02:35] they're gone
[1:02:36] amen he says the father taketh them away
[1:02:40] so that's number one every branch in me
[1:02:43] that beareth not fruity taketh away
[1:02:46] every branch that beareth fruit
[1:02:49] he purgeth it
[1:02:51] that it may bring forth more fruit
[1:02:55] now we all know that that that purging
[1:02:58] is
[1:02:59] well if you're the
[1:03:00] tree uh the purging is not a very
[1:03:04] pleasant experience to the tree
[1:03:07] because the purging is in the tree is a
[1:03:10] cutting away of the excess and dead
[1:03:13] limbs that are hanging on
[1:03:15] keeping the tree from producing more and
[1:03:18] better fruit
[1:03:20] because the tree is supplying to all of
[1:03:24] the the roots of the and the trunk of
[1:03:26] the tree is supplying everything that
[1:03:28] every a bit of branch and fruit of that
[1:03:31] leaves that that tree needs
[1:03:33] well if there's branches just hanging on
[1:03:36] and they're not bearing any fruit what's
[1:03:38] the point of them
[1:03:40] if they're not bearing fruit then he
[1:03:42] heals them all
[1:03:44] well if he hewns them off then that
[1:03:46] gives more that gives more of what's
[1:03:48] coming from the root to that that is
[1:03:51] bearing fruit
[1:03:52] so
[1:03:53] the purging is taking away any of those
[1:03:56] things in your life
[1:03:58] the baggage the chipping away the pieces
[1:04:01] of things that's absorbing time
[1:04:05] that's absorbing energy that is
[1:04:07] absorbing your attention getting away
[1:04:11] away with those things doing away with
[1:04:13] those things so that the important parts
[1:04:15] of your life that is bearing the fruit
[1:04:18] begins to bear more fruit
[1:04:21] better fruit
[1:04:23] how do you do that by getting rid of the
[1:04:25] things that aren't bearing fruit
[1:04:27] by getting rid of things in our lives
[1:04:29] that don't bear fruit or that are
[1:04:31] bearing
[1:04:32] not good or rotten fruit
[1:04:34] or even a limb that may be hanging there
[1:04:36] that's just dead
[1:04:38] you know what dead limb still gets stuff
[1:04:41] from the tree
[1:04:42] it just isn't getting enough to keep the
[1:04:44] to keep the limb alive so the the limb
[1:04:47] looks dead
[1:04:48] you ever looked at a limb and it looks
[1:04:51] just dead there's no leaves on it no
[1:04:52] fruit on it you go cut that limb off and
[1:04:55] and when you cut it off from the main
[1:04:57] vine we'll say it still looks like it
[1:04:59] has life in it
[1:05:01] i've done that
[1:05:02] many many times i'll look at it look
[1:05:04] just as dead as it can be now sometimes
[1:05:06] i grab it snap it right off you know
[1:05:08] there's it's just gone but a lot of
[1:05:11] times you'll grab one and try to and it
[1:05:13] won't snap because it still has life
[1:05:15] there
[1:05:16] it's taking life away from the part of
[1:05:18] the tree that's producing fruit
[1:05:22] a way to make the tree that's producing
[1:05:25] fruit produce better more fruit is to
[1:05:28] get rid of that that is supplying over
[1:05:30] to that that's dead
[1:05:32] why send something of substance to that
[1:05:36] that's not producing anything
[1:05:38] get rid of it
[1:05:40] that's that's what god does to each one
[1:05:43] of us
[1:05:44] to get rid of those things those
[1:05:46] unprofitable things in your life i know
[1:05:51] as a young man as a young minister
[1:05:53] i used to engage
[1:05:55] so many times in debates and i guess you
[1:05:58] could say arguments and doctrines and
[1:06:00] things like that and i just
[1:06:02] i finally i guess i got it at least a
[1:06:05] speck of enough wisdom i quit doing that
[1:06:09] i found out that it is very unprofitable
[1:06:12] and unfruitful and unedifying to me to
[1:06:16] sit there and argue with somebody about
[1:06:17] it right
[1:06:20] i i did
[1:06:22] now i know the bible says to reason and
[1:06:24] i still talk to people in reason
[1:06:26] scripture but that's not what i'm
[1:06:28] talking about
[1:06:30] i've been in places i've been in
[1:06:33] restaurants back east
[1:06:35] where people got in ministers
[1:06:38] in such discussions
[1:06:40] and i'll say argument the whole
[1:06:41] restaurant was watching them
[1:06:44] i was embarrassed
[1:06:47] because the whole restaurant was making
[1:06:48] fun of because they were yelling at each
[1:06:50] other
[1:06:52] fussing at each other
[1:06:53] like brothers this is not edifying right
[1:06:56] look if it's something that's not
[1:06:58] edifying why are you hanging on your
[1:07:01] life
[1:07:02] why are you keeping it
[1:07:04] why is it a part of your life if it's
[1:07:07] unfruitful and unedifying
[1:07:10] if that limb is dead or dying if it's
[1:07:13] not producing fruit in your life get rid
[1:07:16] of it
[1:07:17] kill it
[1:07:19] chip away those pieces
[1:07:21] so that the rest of that tree which we
[1:07:24] are the bride tree
[1:07:25] is is producing that fruit that that the
[1:07:28] rest of your life will be more fruitful
[1:07:32] if you heal off let let's
[1:07:35] i'm not going to say anything specific
[1:07:37] but if there's anything that's uh like
[1:07:40] taking effort from your life right
[1:07:43] that's becoming unfruitful why do you
[1:07:46] leave it don't let it hang on you
[1:07:49] get rid of it you know there's the parts
[1:07:52] of your life that are more fruitful
[1:07:54] you know there's parts of your life that
[1:07:56] are more edifying
[1:07:57] that bless you more that help you bless
[1:08:00] others more you know there's parts of
[1:08:02] your life that produce more fruit well
[1:08:05] if you take it away from there to to
[1:08:07] energize the other part that is being
[1:08:10] fruitful wouldn't it be more fruitful
[1:08:14] sure it would
[1:08:16] amen
[1:08:19] shipping off the pieces
[1:08:22] bringing it to where it becomes bearing
[1:08:24] more fruit
[1:08:26] more fruit
[1:08:28] look now let's continue it's purging he
[1:08:32] purges it
[1:08:35] chip
[1:08:35] basically that's chipping away the
[1:08:37] pieces perjugate is getting rid of
[1:08:39] anything that's unfruitful or dead
[1:08:42] which is unfruitful in itself
[1:08:45] now he says
[1:08:46] now ye are clean
[1:08:49] praise the lord amen
[1:08:53] that clean is uh is in a place of
[1:08:57] uh completion
[1:08:58] of perfection
[1:09:01] we would say maturity adulthood
[1:09:04] uh completion is reaching a place of
[1:09:07] full maturity
[1:09:08] oh we get to that place where we are
[1:09:10] clean
[1:09:11] clean through what the word
[1:09:14] it says you are clean through the words
[1:09:16] which i have spoken unto you
[1:09:18] what jesus said in
[1:09:20] saint john 17 17 sanctify them through
[1:09:24] thy truth that word is the truth
[1:09:28] brother branham talked about that being
[1:09:30] sanctified finding a place of
[1:09:33] sanctification
[1:09:34] cleansing
[1:09:36] well that's what they had done they had
[1:09:37] been cleansed
[1:09:39] well when you reach that place that that
[1:09:41] god comes and you you you repent and
[1:09:44] you're you're baptizing god fills you
[1:09:47] with the holy spirit you are cleansed
[1:09:50] god is using you and your life is
[1:09:52] producing the fruit of the spirit
[1:09:55] and now the fruit of that spirit is
[1:09:57] being manifested through your spirit
[1:10:00] through your body and so it's man of
[1:10:03] crush so christ is being manifested
[1:10:05] through your own flesh
[1:10:08] through your own body
[1:10:11] manifesting to others to see yes that
[1:10:14] fruit is showing itself and your life is
[1:10:16] being fruitful
[1:10:23] is that a part of the squeeze that
[1:10:24] people talked about for years and years
[1:10:27] 30 years or more i've been
[1:10:29] uh
[1:10:30] i lose count i was i'm coming up on 35
[1:10:33] years of preaching and ministering and
[1:10:36] i i wonder i've always had a little
[1:10:39] different take on the squeeze as i've
[1:10:41] told you
[1:10:43] but could that be a part of that that
[1:10:45] we're talking about i know brother brown
[1:10:46] talked about the squeeze the ecumenical
[1:10:49] council
[1:10:50] but there's but that thing that brings
[1:10:53] us into that place of desperation
[1:10:56] our blink brings us into that place of
[1:10:59] uh of of complete
[1:11:02] surrender
[1:11:03] to the lord and faith and belief look
[1:11:08] we know that we're heading up something
[1:11:12] that the entire world has never seen
[1:11:15] before now exceed it as we talked about
[1:11:18] there with our messages in the rapture a
[1:11:20] few times along through the scripture we
[1:11:22] know it has happened but a wholesale
[1:11:24] rapture of a large group of people has
[1:11:26] never taken place
[1:11:28] a general catching away that we're
[1:11:30] talking about now
[1:11:32] so this last day alive and remain
[1:11:35] grouped which we all are now we've had a
[1:11:37] lot that's gone on but this alive and
[1:11:40] remain group now coming together
[1:11:42] to bring this
[1:11:44] place this bride this alive and remain
[1:11:47] to a place
[1:11:48] of such faith
[1:11:51] to receive a body change and to leave
[1:11:54] this planet without tasting death
[1:11:59] it's going to take something
[1:12:01] a huge down
[1:12:03] when you get to the statue of a perfect
[1:12:05] man you recognize that when it gets
[1:12:08] towards the top of that pinnacle when it
[1:12:11] gets towards the top of that pyramid it
[1:12:14] comes to a very peak of just a point
[1:12:18] there's down when you got faith there's
[1:12:20] all kinds of room
[1:12:22] at the base of the pyramid when there's
[1:12:24] faith there's all kinds of room right
[1:12:26] but when you get up to the very top and
[1:12:29] you've reached the pinnacle of that of
[1:12:31] that agape love
[1:12:33] when you've reached that pinnacle
[1:12:34] there's not a whole lot of room but it's
[1:12:36] got to get to that place
[1:12:38] that's the place we're looking to get to
[1:12:41] to leave here yes
[1:12:43] amen
[1:12:44] to leave here
[1:12:46] to produce something
[1:12:48] again as an elaborate group to produce
[1:12:51] something that's not been produced
[1:12:52] before by a wholesale group of people an
[1:12:55] international group of people that are
[1:12:56] alive that's doing something to bring us
[1:12:59] to a place to where we live here
[1:13:03] without tasting death
[1:13:05] that's what we're looking to well if
[1:13:08] it's going to get to that place then
[1:13:09] don't you believe there's got to be some
[1:13:11] perching
[1:13:12] yeah there's got to be some fine tuning
[1:13:14] there's got to be some chipping away of
[1:13:16] those last pieces the rubbing the
[1:13:19] polishing the the getting that image to
[1:13:21] the exact perfection that god saw it to
[1:13:24] be that mystical body of jesus christ of
[1:13:28] the bride internationally
[1:13:30] all of our brothers and sisters around
[1:13:32] the world coming together to form that
[1:13:35] image of that mystical body of christ
[1:13:38] well
[1:13:39] that goes back from the first church age
[1:13:43] this alive and remain group is the one
[1:13:45] to catch that
[1:13:47] amen
[1:13:48] because the dead in christ shall rise oh
[1:13:50] yes yes we know that they're there
[1:13:53] they're ready
[1:13:54] i'm looking forward just to that day
[1:13:58] but this salivary main groups
[1:14:01] we have got to come to that place of
[1:14:03] that that
[1:14:04] that cleanness that that perfection of
[1:14:07] image
[1:14:08] in jesus christ of becoming one with him
[1:14:12] so much they don't tell the two apart
[1:14:15] above so much they don't tell the two
[1:14:17] apart that's right that's your life
[1:14:20] that's your personal life
[1:14:22] that's in each one of us individually
[1:14:24] but as a group god's doing the same
[1:14:26] thing for all of us i know the bible
[1:14:28] says the bride has made herself ready
[1:14:31] and she is because she's taking the word
[1:14:33] and she's clothing herself with it but
[1:14:35] it's god that's doing the chipping away
[1:14:37] because he's the part
[1:14:38] we're the clay he's the one chipping
[1:14:40] away the pieces sometimes we get things
[1:14:43] that are very unpleasant to us
[1:14:45] amen
[1:14:46] very unpleasant uh
[1:14:48] things that might hurt here or hurt
[1:14:50] there but it's of a necessity because
[1:14:53] without that
[1:14:55] dark trial of that valley we wouldn't
[1:14:57] have the strength to get to the
[1:14:59] mountaintop right
[1:15:01] we wouldn't have the ability the faith
[1:15:03] to get to a rapture
[1:15:06] if one doesn't happen two won't happen
[1:15:09] everybody wants to talk to the mountain
[1:15:11] experience but nobody wants to go
[1:15:13] through the valley to get to it right
[1:15:15] but it's the only way to get to it is to
[1:15:17] go through the valley
[1:15:19] amen that purging that chipping
[1:15:22] amen is that is that a part of the
[1:15:25] squeeze do we see what's going on around
[1:15:27] us today is that a part of it i don't
[1:15:29] know
[1:15:31] amen
[1:15:32] but i believe this bride she's coming
[1:15:34] into that image because faith is comes
[1:15:36] by hearing and hearing the word and no
[1:15:38] matter whether you feel it you can tell
[1:15:39] it or you can uh
[1:15:42] tell somebody else about it whatever
[1:15:44] doesn't matter
[1:15:46] the words the word
[1:15:47] faith comes by hearing if you're hearing
[1:15:49] the prove the pure true
[1:15:52] word of god being ministered or as you
[1:15:55] read it and as god reveals it to you
[1:15:57] that brings faith
[1:15:59] it's bringing faith
[1:16:00] amen when you need it it'll be there
[1:16:04] it'll be there praise the lord there's a
[1:16:07] reason for it all
[1:16:08] god is positioning this bride for that
[1:16:11] rapture
[1:16:12] he's positioning her for that rapture
[1:16:14] matthew let's go over to matthew chapter
[1:16:16] 3.
[1:16:23] michelangelo worked on that sculpture
[1:16:25] for years and years
[1:16:27] but when it finally got to that place
[1:16:30] when it was completed in his mind that
[1:16:33] image had been completed
[1:16:35] he was so overtaken
[1:16:37] he struck it god's positioning this
[1:16:40] bride the same the same way we're being
[1:16:42] positioned
[1:16:44] uh
[1:16:45] to go in a rapture
[1:16:47] god is shaping us molding us
[1:16:50] cutting away more pieces
[1:16:52] amen matthew chapter three let's uh
[1:16:56] let's read beginning with verse nine
[1:17:01] john the baptist wasn't very nice to
[1:17:03] these uh religious people
[1:17:06] and think not to say within yours let's
[1:17:08] see
[1:17:09] verse 8 bring forth therefore fruits
[1:17:13] meant for repentance
[1:17:14] in other words you you say you're one
[1:17:17] thing but you don't show that you're
[1:17:18] that right
[1:17:20] if you're going to tell me you're
[1:17:23] something
[1:17:24] prove to me you're something
[1:17:26] don't just tell it to me show it to me
[1:17:29] bring me fruits if you say you've
[1:17:31] repented
[1:17:33] give me the fruits of your repentance
[1:17:36] that's where the rubber meets the road
[1:17:37] if you will
[1:17:39] amen
[1:17:40] and think not to say within yourselves
[1:17:42] we have abraham to our father for i say
[1:17:45] unto you that god is able these stones
[1:17:47] to raise up children unto abraham
[1:17:50] now also
[1:17:52] the axe is laid unto the root of the
[1:17:54] trees therefore every tree which
[1:17:56] bringeth not forth good fruit is shewn
[1:17:59] down and cast into the fire
[1:18:02] everyone that's not bringing forth good
[1:18:04] fruit
[1:18:06] we just read over and john
[1:18:08] more fruit much fruit
[1:18:11] is shewn down and cast in the fire
[1:18:14] i indeed baptize you with water we'll
[1:18:17] come at this from another way now
[1:18:19] i indeed baptize you with water into
[1:18:21] repentance but he that cometh after me
[1:18:23] is mightier than i whose shoes i am not
[1:18:26] worthy to bear
[1:18:28] he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[1:18:30] and with fire amen amen fire fire is
[1:18:34] that purger
[1:18:36] fire is a purger
[1:18:38] fire gets rid of sin
[1:18:41] fire gets rid of germs diseases
[1:18:45] fire pur cleanses things
[1:18:49] and the holy ghost and fire does the
[1:18:50] exact same thing in your life
[1:18:53] spiritually
[1:18:55] brings the cleansing
[1:18:58] i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize
[1:19:01] you with the holy ghost and with fire
[1:19:04] whose fan is in his hand
[1:19:07] and he will thoroughly purge his floor
[1:19:10] and gather his wheat into the garner but
[1:19:13] he will burn up the chap with
[1:19:16] unquenchable fire now we've got another
[1:19:18] instance now this is a wholesale
[1:19:21] separation if you will
[1:19:23] the bible says not to be unequally yoked
[1:19:26] here is a here is a wholesale separation
[1:19:30] taking place
[1:19:33] john is saying here that jesus is coming
[1:19:36] and he will baptize you with the holy
[1:19:38] ghost and with fire
[1:19:40] and his fan
[1:19:42] is in his hand now it's not a fan like a
[1:19:45] ceiling fan or a
[1:19:47] fan you push it and blows air this is a
[1:19:50] this is a winnowing fan
[1:19:53] where it's like a little basket or a
[1:19:55] fork of some kind
[1:19:57] it has a handle on it
[1:19:59] and that fan you take and you winter the
[1:20:03] widows the grain
[1:20:05] purge the grain
[1:20:08] you take it and you you you dip into the
[1:20:11] weed and you sling it up in the air
[1:20:14] it's called winnowing
[1:20:16] or
[1:20:16] purging
[1:20:18] and what it does is the chaff or brother
[1:20:21] adam called the shock
[1:20:23] amen because you know
[1:20:25] the shock cannot be heir with the weak
[1:20:28] right amen can not right
[1:20:31] not air with the wheat the shuck is a
[1:20:33] protector of the wheat the shuck hangs
[1:20:36] on the wheat for a long time and looks
[1:20:38] just like the wheat at some point in the
[1:20:40] progression of the wheat's growth
[1:20:43] but the weed and the chaff are two
[1:20:45] different things
[1:20:46] and when the week comes to a place of
[1:20:49] maturity
[1:20:50] there comes that finalization of getting
[1:20:53] the we in prepare in preparation for use
[1:20:58] and so the widowing they
[1:21:00] take the fan the winnowing fan and go in
[1:21:04] the wheat and throw it up in the air
[1:21:06] and what that does is it causes the
[1:21:09] chaff the the shock as brother branham
[1:21:11] said to fly away from the wheat
[1:21:14] so that the wheat so that the chap blows
[1:21:17] away with the wind
[1:21:19] amen uh
[1:21:21] ephesians 4
[1:21:23] blown away with every wind of doctrine
[1:21:26] amen that shaft blows away but the wheat
[1:21:30] is grounded
[1:21:32] the wheat has found its thai post
[1:21:35] it knows where it's standing in the word
[1:21:38] it knows who it is and what its place is
[1:21:41] and so it comes as it's grounded back to
[1:21:44] the earth when the chaff gets driven
[1:21:46] away with every wind of doctrine
[1:21:48] the chaff is blown away but the wheat
[1:21:50] comes down so that the only thing that's
[1:21:52] left is the true pure grain
[1:21:57] the wheat only not the chaff
[1:22:00] so there's a blowing away of the the
[1:22:03] chipping away of all the pieces that's
[1:22:05] just still hanging on there at the end
[1:22:08] even when the even when the wheat has
[1:22:10] has been harvested and brought in it
[1:22:13] still has to go through that winnowing
[1:22:15] process
[1:22:17] to where it gets rid of all the chow off
[1:22:19] the wheat so you only have genuine wheat
[1:22:23] look what
[1:22:24] look what he said here the fan is in
[1:22:27] jesus hand
[1:22:28] amen so he's the one winning
[1:22:31] he's the one that's throwing this wheat
[1:22:33] and purging this week
[1:22:36] and he's doing it he will in his hand he
[1:22:39] will surely
[1:22:42] amen not just flippantly not just you
[1:22:44] know uh
[1:22:46] oh part-time no he's gonna thoroughly
[1:22:50] in other words there won't be one single
[1:22:52] grain
[1:22:54] that will not be purged
[1:22:56] if you belong to god god's going to
[1:22:58] continue to purge you
[1:23:00] if you don't belong to god god will just
[1:23:02] leave you alone
[1:23:04] i said this many times
[1:23:06] i've seen a lot of people leave church
[1:23:08] i've seen a lot of people quit and go
[1:23:10] off or do things
[1:23:15] reject this message and whatnot i said
[1:23:17] and i've told you could ask my wife no i
[1:23:20] don't tell anybody specific but you can
[1:23:22] ask us and now now you'll see
[1:23:25] if this person is really a child of god
[1:23:27] and they're leaving they're leaving the
[1:23:28] truth they're leaving the message
[1:23:30] they're leaving christ
[1:23:32] they'll
[1:23:32] they will be miserable yes they're a lot
[1:23:36] everything in their life will go wrong
[1:23:40] almost everything in their life will go
[1:23:42] wrong
[1:23:43] now if they're not because god's gonna
[1:23:45] bring that person back where they're
[1:23:47] supposed to be
[1:23:48] now they may refuse it
[1:23:50] now we know brother ram tells us about
[1:23:52] times uh
[1:23:54] where people absolutely they still
[1:23:56] refuse it and god takes them
[1:23:59] god talked to brother brahm talked about
[1:24:01] and i know i'm going to miss some of the
[1:24:02] details but a man that drowned to death
[1:24:04] because uh
[1:24:06] uh
[1:24:08] because he let's just say he went before
[1:24:11] his time
[1:24:13] you know brother ham said you could go
[1:24:14] before your time
[1:24:16] but this but the reason that is is
[1:24:19] is because this person was not
[1:24:22] living for god and they were supposed to
[1:24:24] be and they were a child of god
[1:24:27] now
[1:24:28] i don't think this is a majority of
[1:24:30] people but this does happen brother
[1:24:32] branham taught us that it does
[1:24:34] that
[1:24:35] that there will be people sometimes that
[1:24:37] will just they just won't do it and
[1:24:39] their lives will be miserable their
[1:24:40] lives will be missed i believe my
[1:24:42] brother was one of those people
[1:24:44] my brother when he was a young boy he
[1:24:46] went to church all the time he was
[1:24:48] faithful as baptist church but he was
[1:24:49] faithful even when he was a young man
[1:24:51] felt he had a call in his life
[1:24:54] he went to my dad and said he felt he
[1:24:56] had a call in his life and my dad was
[1:24:59] very supportive and helpful and whatnot
[1:25:01] of course that time you were supposed to
[1:25:02] go to a seminary or whatever he was too
[1:25:04] young for that but you know you get to
[1:25:06] that place you're supposed to go to a
[1:25:07] seminary or something and become a
[1:25:09] baptist preacher minister whatever well
[1:25:12] he went on a little with his life and he
[1:25:15] got away from god and he
[1:25:17] neglected the call and
[1:25:19] he didn't
[1:25:20] follow through or do anything with it
[1:25:22] and he got married and his wife and they
[1:25:24] were living whatever life and stuff and
[1:25:26] uh and he just went away from god
[1:25:29] from that time his whole life friends
[1:25:32] i'll tell you his whole life was
[1:25:34] miserable
[1:25:35] except for one little portion he found a
[1:25:38] nice wife he had a boy
[1:25:42] and and god took her
[1:25:45] my brother was out
[1:25:47] driving a truck he was in boston or
[1:25:50] somewhere his wife died at home
[1:25:53] god took a car
[1:25:55] his next wife's next wife he married out
[1:25:57] three or four times he got married
[1:25:59] been burned when he was a kid he got
[1:26:01] burned 80 he had second and third degree
[1:26:04] burns over 80 of his body in 1967
[1:26:10] something like that
[1:26:13] 80 of his body second third degree birds
[1:26:15] his flesh was just falling off his body
[1:26:18] he was supposed to die
[1:26:20] i remember being in the hospital the
[1:26:22] doctors and people wheeling my mother
[1:26:23] around on a wheelchair she couldn't even
[1:26:25] walk
[1:26:26] so distraught
[1:26:29] my brother was burning weeds in the back
[1:26:31] of his yard one time and he had a rag
[1:26:33] hanging out of his back pants and the
[1:26:34] rag caught on fire
[1:26:36] burned up his back of course that just
[1:26:39] brought him back to flashbacks he'd just
[1:26:40] get on the road to start walking
[1:26:43] my brother would he just walked he just
[1:26:46] he would just
[1:26:48] teeter over into that insanity and he
[1:26:51] just we just walked
[1:26:54] just aimlessly no purpose no reason
[1:26:59] he'd come back to himself
[1:27:01] he was delivering drugs one time he had
[1:27:04] a van he moved up into the mountains of
[1:27:06] north carolina but the job was down in
[1:27:08] charlotte so you had to drive back and
[1:27:10] forth all the time so he would drive
[1:27:12] down real early in the morning and pick
[1:27:14] up the drugs for drug stores
[1:27:17] not illegal drugs
[1:27:20] he'd pick up the drugs at the at the
[1:27:22] pharmacy wherever it was to distribute
[1:27:24] him to
[1:27:25] and deliver him to the drug stores and
[1:27:27] work his way all back up home again
[1:27:29] one time he was going around uh the
[1:27:32] mountains in north carolina my brother
[1:27:34] was a stickler about about the speed
[1:27:36] limit he went to speed limit all the
[1:27:38] time
[1:27:39] he wore his seat belt as religiously as
[1:27:42] any human i had ever seen in my life up
[1:27:43] to that point
[1:27:45] he wore his seat belt every single time
[1:27:48] he got in that van every time i never
[1:27:51] saw my brother not put his seat belt on
[1:27:54] for some reason
[1:27:56] when my brother when he was going
[1:27:57] through those mountains he did not have
[1:27:59] his seatbelt on
[1:28:02] nobody knows why he doesn't remember not
[1:28:04] having it on but it wasn't on
[1:28:07] and he went around one of them curves in
[1:28:08] the mountains of north carolina 50 miles
[1:28:10] an hour and a drunk coming hit him head
[1:28:12] on at 65.
[1:28:14] head-on
[1:28:17] the impact was so hard
[1:28:19] it threw him
[1:28:21] into the back of the van
[1:28:24] without a seat belt it was just one
[1:28:26] little just one little seat one little
[1:28:28] smaller than that just one little seat
[1:28:30] that you could sit in it says nothing
[1:28:32] there to hold it threw him in the back
[1:28:34] of the van but he hit him so hard his
[1:28:37] right shoe
[1:28:38] was stuck
[1:28:40] where the gas pedal was that truck that
[1:28:42] car hit him so hard it actually ripped
[1:28:44] the shoe off his foot
[1:28:46] didn't break his foot
[1:28:48] but took the shoe off his foot his shoe
[1:28:50] was so hard i had to go to the van and
[1:28:52] pick his shoes up it was so stuck in
[1:28:54] there i had to grab it and work my way
[1:28:56] to get that shoe out it was stuck in
[1:28:58] there so hard
[1:28:59] the lord spared his life again he was
[1:29:02] supposed to have his seat thrown on get
[1:29:03] out of his seat but only being crushed
[1:29:04] to death
[1:29:06] the lord spared him again
[1:29:09] but my brother's life was miserable
[1:29:10] miserable miserable miserable he'd have
[1:29:13] one sickness have another he'd have one
[1:29:15] miserable marriage after another he'd
[1:29:17] have another
[1:29:18] failure marriage after another
[1:29:20] son left and daughter didn't want
[1:29:22] anything to do with him he had a
[1:29:23] miserable
[1:29:24] i hate to say it that way but it's just
[1:29:26] the truth
[1:29:27] my brother had a miserable life
[1:29:31] and he he died
[1:29:34] 10 years ago or so
[1:29:37] probably longer than that time goes by
[1:29:38] so fast
[1:29:40] uh
[1:29:41] of a stroke
[1:29:43] died
[1:29:45] he went into a coma i said god don't
[1:29:47] take my brother till i know he's ready
[1:29:50] he was supposed to die that day he
[1:29:52] lasted a week
[1:29:54] and i felt a peace in my heart
[1:29:56] just like i did my sister i said okay
[1:29:59] he was gone that day
[1:30:00] passed away that day
[1:30:03] but he lived a miserable life
[1:30:05] god tried over and over and over to get
[1:30:08] his attention
[1:30:09] brother brown talks about that man who
[1:30:11] died he said why so and so did this
[1:30:14] happen he had started drinking and stuff
[1:30:16] said god took him home before he got too
[1:30:18] far out
[1:30:19] or something like that before he got too
[1:30:21] far away god took him home he died
[1:30:23] before his time but because he wasn't
[1:30:26] serving the lord
[1:30:27] people take that sometimes to seed and
[1:30:29] say well you can just die anytime no no
[1:30:32] no god's in control of these things
[1:30:33] don't don't forget that
[1:30:36] god's in control of this amen but
[1:30:39] but if you get so far out and you belong
[1:30:42] to him
[1:30:45] god will bring you home before you get
[1:30:46] so far out there's no coming back
[1:30:50] and god will allow
[1:30:53] and people will go because we're free
[1:30:55] moral agents
[1:30:57] to go out and like i said before you can
[1:30:59] ask my wife i've told her i said we'll
[1:31:00] see now if that person's life just goes
[1:31:04] all nice and rosy and fine and they're
[1:31:06] doing great and things are wonderful in
[1:31:08] life or things get better you know the
[1:31:10] rich young ruler when he turned god down
[1:31:13] he got richer right his life didn't get
[1:31:16] miserable he got richer so he found out
[1:31:18] he where his demise was where he ended
[1:31:21] up so we know he wasn't a child of god
[1:31:23] he got richer had to build more barns he
[1:31:26] had to tear down perfectly good barns to
[1:31:28] build bigger ones to hold all of his
[1:31:30] stuff
[1:31:34] but he wasn't one of them
[1:31:36] but you see and i've seen it before too
[1:31:38] people's lives will become so miserable
[1:31:41] that they will come back
[1:31:43] god wants to bring that person back
[1:31:45] where they're supposed to be
[1:31:46] their life will be miserable if they
[1:31:48] leave him
[1:31:50] amen if they leave him and that's where
[1:31:53] a
[1:31:54] a lot of people come to
[1:31:57] if a person leaves him their life gets
[1:31:59] miserable
[1:32:01] and they're just god's just trying to
[1:32:02] draw you back yes god's just trying to
[1:32:04] bring you back to where you're supposed
[1:32:06] to be and i should say
[1:32:09] most of the time it happens that way
[1:32:11] right amen
[1:32:13] it happens that will we come back to who
[1:32:15] we're supposed to be
[1:32:17] who god made us in the beginning
[1:32:19] what that image is that god saw he wants
[1:32:22] it to be that way yeah
[1:32:23] sometimes people have a hard time with
[1:32:25] that purging
[1:32:27] sometimes
[1:32:28] things of life get so hard they just
[1:32:30] can't stand it anymore
[1:32:32] and they leave
[1:32:34] sometimes those people leave
[1:32:37] because they're not god to begin with
[1:32:40] they look at romans 8 28 and they say
[1:32:43] this says it's supposed to work together
[1:32:44] for my good but it's only for those who
[1:32:47] love god amen
[1:32:49] if you don't love god it doesn't work
[1:32:53] right and people say oh i love god but
[1:32:55] then they they don't obey his word
[1:32:58] they don't live for him
[1:33:00] they don't
[1:33:02] do what the word tells them to do they
[1:33:04] they don't live by the dictates of his
[1:33:06] work how can you love somebody and then
[1:33:08] not obey them
[1:33:11] especially if they're to be your lord
[1:33:13] your master
[1:33:15] well you don't you say you do but you
[1:33:16] don't a lot of people just have an
[1:33:18] affinity for god
[1:33:20] oh they like god when
[1:33:22] when he's doing good for him and when
[1:33:24] everything's going great but when things
[1:33:26] are bad then then they turn their back
[1:33:28] on
[1:33:29] i've seen it so many times when things
[1:33:31] start going wrong in people's lives they
[1:33:33] quit going to church right
[1:33:35] the timings you come to church the most
[1:33:39] that should be the time you should cinch
[1:33:41] up that much tighter and get in there
[1:33:42] and fight that good fight
[1:33:45] get the strength from your brothers and
[1:33:47] sisters and from the ministering of the
[1:33:49] work and grow that strengthen because
[1:33:51] when you get to that next mountain
[1:33:53] you're going to be able to climb it
[1:33:55] right amen
[1:33:56] it's hard yeah it's hard
[1:33:59] but you got to understand it all works
[1:34:01] together for our good because we love
[1:34:03] him
[1:34:05] that's agape unconditional love
[1:34:08] so that no matter what happens lord i
[1:34:10] believe you
[1:34:11] i trust you that's hard
[1:34:13] especially when you're sitting there
[1:34:14] watching your first son die
[1:34:17] when you when you watch your first son
[1:34:19] take his last breath and you quote that
[1:34:23] someone had come up to me and quoted
[1:34:25] that scripture to me i might have
[1:34:26] punched him in the face
[1:34:28] i was hurt saints i'll be honest with
[1:34:30] you
[1:34:31] a lot of times people don't want to be
[1:34:32] honest that's just the truth
[1:34:35] i was hurt
[1:34:36] i was mad
[1:34:38] i was crying so uncontrollably i
[1:34:41] couldn't stop the water coming out of my
[1:34:43] eyes
[1:34:44] that hurt
[1:34:46] but you know you get to the place where
[1:34:48] you
[1:34:48] you find who you are
[1:34:51] you recognize what the blessings god has
[1:34:53] done for you
[1:34:55] and you finally
[1:34:56] like job did
[1:34:57] the lord giveth and the lord taketh away
[1:35:00] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:35:03] amen
[1:35:04] and i'm thankful
[1:35:05] because the lord took our first son but
[1:35:07] then he gave us two children just like
[1:35:09] job job lost
[1:35:12] doubled what he lost to start with
[1:35:14] because then he had the other on the
[1:35:15] other side
[1:35:16] now we got
[1:35:17] our first son is on the other side
[1:35:19] waiting on us amen
[1:35:20] praise the lord amen jesus
[1:35:24] purging his floor
[1:35:26] now that's the part i was getting to
[1:35:28] before i started that
[1:35:29] uh
[1:35:30] purging his floor he will thoroughly
[1:35:33] purge his floor his floor these
[1:35:36] threshing floors were a uh or a a
[1:35:40] portion of
[1:35:42] ownership or identity
[1:35:45] a threshing floor was a place of
[1:35:47] identity
[1:35:49] and
[1:35:50] when it says that jesus thoroughly
[1:35:52] purged it's his floor that he's purging
[1:35:56] he's not concerned about
[1:35:59] and that might not be the right way to
[1:36:01] say it to not be
[1:36:02] misunderstood
[1:36:04] but
[1:36:06] it's like i said before
[1:36:09] me and my wife were responsible for our
[1:36:10] children if our neighbors children acted
[1:36:13] up that's their parents
[1:36:15] issue to deal with not mine
[1:36:18] amen now if they were in my house i
[1:36:20] would straighten them out
[1:36:22] but
[1:36:24] it's not my responsibility to raise
[1:36:27] other people's children
[1:36:30] god is responsible to his own
[1:36:33] he's not responsible to those that
[1:36:35] aren't his own
[1:36:37] if they're on his purging floor he's
[1:36:40] responsible for them he is the winner of
[1:36:43] his own
[1:36:45] not that not it's not his that's why i
[1:36:47] say it if they come in and they part of
[1:36:50] church and they leave and they they
[1:36:52] neglect this and they they turn their
[1:36:53] backs on god and the message whatever
[1:36:56] and their lives get better or greater or
[1:36:58] they're all happy and everything's fine
[1:36:59] i'll worry about that yes yeah that's
[1:37:02] the worst in my opinion that's the worst
[1:37:04] sign a person can have that they're not
[1:37:06] a christian they're not they don't
[1:37:07] belong on his floor
[1:37:10] because god will purge his floor
[1:37:13] god will continue to drive away that
[1:37:15] chaff
[1:37:16] away from his wheat as long as it takes
[1:37:18] it is whatever he has to do to do it
[1:37:21] but if it's not his floor it's not
[1:37:25] and i have a hard time saying this
[1:37:26] without it being misunderstood but it's
[1:37:28] not his responsibility they're not his
[1:37:32] understand
[1:37:33] so if they go out and they belong to him
[1:37:35] they're his responsibility that's his
[1:37:37] floor he's going to do the purging right
[1:37:39] he's going to do the winnowing
[1:37:41] amen because if we belong to him
[1:37:44] praise the lord
[1:37:48] well i just leave that's
[1:37:49] it's his floor
[1:37:52] and he'll gather his wheat into the
[1:37:54] gardener
[1:37:55] but he will burn up the chapel with
[1:37:57] unquenchable fire yes amen so where does
[1:38:01] that come to he said he will oh yeah
[1:38:04] you get to get to the white throne
[1:38:06] judgment who do you think is the one
[1:38:07] pronouncing that that
[1:38:10] satan and his followers go to hell
[1:38:13] who do you think is pronouncing that
[1:38:15] judgment
[1:38:16] he is you know amen
[1:38:21] remember the shock is not heir with weak
[1:38:24] amen the wheat belong to him
[1:38:27] the wheat are his
[1:38:28] amen
[1:38:31] praise the lord
[1:38:38] let me read this modern events made
[1:38:40] clear by prophecy
[1:38:44] the shuck held it but now the shock
[1:38:46] pulls away
[1:38:47] shut pulls away the shock pulls away it
[1:38:50] has to
[1:38:51] amen
[1:38:52] and remember 20 years has passed by and
[1:38:55] no more denominations has come out of
[1:38:56] this message and it won't
[1:38:59] we're at the end of denominations the
[1:39:01] wheat has taken its shape but what's the
[1:39:04] matter with the wheat now it must lay
[1:39:07] now we're at this end time now the wheat
[1:39:10] must lay in the presence of the sun to
[1:39:12] ripen
[1:39:14] to ripen before the combine picks it up
[1:39:18] before the combine picks it up
[1:39:21] it has to lay in the presence of the sun
[1:39:23] to ripen the presence of the s-o-n to
[1:39:26] ripen before the combine cuz so that
[1:39:29] would be the last process
[1:39:31] in this uh in this winnowing to bring
[1:39:34] the wheat to maturity to bring it to a
[1:39:36] place of use it's the last process
[1:39:40] laying the presence of the sun is the
[1:39:41] last process before the before it comes
[1:39:45] comes by to be picked up
[1:39:47] amen that's the last thing
[1:39:50] are we in that time yes this bride she's
[1:39:53] laying in the presence of the s.o.n
[1:39:56] waiting for that combine
[1:39:58] waiting for that call
[1:40:00] waiting for that time you know it used
[1:40:02] to be
[1:40:02] a time
[1:40:04] where
[1:40:06] before they had smelters that they would
[1:40:08] take the gold
[1:40:10] and they would
[1:40:11] the goldsmith would take the golden he
[1:40:13] would take a hammer and he would beat
[1:40:16] that gold and beat the gold and turn it
[1:40:18] over and turn it over and beat it until
[1:40:21] it until he can see his own reflection
[1:40:23] in it
[1:40:24] that's where you can see the purity of a
[1:40:26] metal
[1:40:27] by seeing your reflection in it and
[1:40:29] that beating would get all the dross all
[1:40:32] the material all of the pyrite anything
[1:40:34] that was in it that didn't belong there
[1:40:36] would be beaten out with the with the
[1:40:40] with the a beater's hammer
[1:40:42] would get rid of all the dross and all
[1:40:44] the thing out of the and it was done so
[1:40:46] that the man could see his own
[1:40:48] reflection
[1:40:50] that's what
[1:40:51] god is doing for us
[1:40:54] is getting rid of anything chipping out
[1:40:56] all the pieces that don't that aren't a
[1:40:59] part of that reflection
[1:41:01] that we reflect christ
[1:41:03] getting rid of everything that's not
[1:41:05] that reflection
[1:41:07] so that whatever's left is nothing but
[1:41:10] him am i amen that's all that needs to
[1:41:13] be left it's just him yes he gets rid of
[1:41:16] everything
[1:41:18] but him yes chipping away
[1:41:20] like michelangelo chipping away
[1:41:23] everything that's not david
[1:41:26] amen
[1:41:27] yeah
[1:41:28] we still have some refining god's still
[1:41:31] working on us
[1:41:33] god's still chipping away some pieces
[1:41:35] here and there god help us yes amen
[1:41:37] sometimes there are little things
[1:41:39] sometimes there but you know it's the
[1:41:40] little foxes that spoils the vibe yes
[1:41:43] sometimes just little things sometimes
[1:41:44] just bigger things sometimes it's
[1:41:46] hurtful things
[1:41:50] but god does it for a reason because
[1:41:51] he's getting us to that place
[1:41:53] of of a pure reflection of christ yes
[1:41:57] amen
[1:41:58] so when god looks at us he sees himself
[1:42:01] yes praise the lord let's stand if we
[1:42:03] could
[1:42:15] paul said despise not
[1:42:19] the
[1:42:21] persecutions the
[1:42:23] chastities of the lord
[1:42:26] even when we take communion he talks
[1:42:28] about it
[1:42:29] amen when we take communion he says
[1:42:32] that we don't take it unworthily
[1:42:35] so that we're not condemned with the
[1:42:37] world we judge ourselves
[1:42:39] so that we're not condemned with the
[1:42:40] world yes amen so when we judge
[1:42:43] ourselves
[1:42:44] we fix whatever
[1:42:47] whatever may be ungodly
[1:42:49] get rid of anything it's not like him
[1:42:52] yes amen so that we're not condemned
[1:42:54] with the ungodly
[1:42:56] praise the lord
[1:42:57] amen
[1:42:59] let's sing this little course again
[1:43:01] that we had sang earlier
[1:43:04] amen he didn't throw the clay away thank
[1:43:06] god he did amen you know he could have
[1:43:10] maybe he
[1:43:11] he had every right to
[1:43:14] but he loves us so much
[1:43:16] amen he loves us so much
[1:43:19] he just
[1:43:20] in his patience just molded us and
[1:43:22] shaped us amen aren't you thankful for
[1:43:25] that
[1:43:30] over
[1:43:31] [Music]
[1:43:48] a vessel
[1:43:54] i
[1:43:54] am today
[1:43:58] and it's all because jesus
[1:44:02] didn't throw
[1:44:04] the
[1:44:09] oh it's over
[1:44:12] and over
[1:44:15] he molds me
[1:44:17] and makes me
[1:44:24] [Music]
[1:44:29] a
[1:44:30] vessel of honor
[1:44:34] i
[1:44:35] am today
[1:44:38] it's all because jesus
[1:44:43] didn't throw
[1:44:45] the clay away one more time
[1:44:48] [Music]
[1:44:51] over and over
[1:44:54] he molds me and makes me
[1:44:59] [Music]
[1:45:09] a
[1:45:10] vessel of honor
[1:45:14] i am today
[1:45:18] it's all because jesus
[1:45:22] didn't throw the clay away
[1:45:29] amen
[1:45:30] a vessel of honor
[1:45:33] i can be today
[1:45:35] because he didn't throw the clay away
[1:45:38] the only reason only way
[1:45:41] that we could be vessels of honor
[1:45:43] vessels for him today yes just because
[1:45:46] he was patient
[1:45:48] loving
[1:45:49] kind
[1:45:50] and continues to mold us and shape us
[1:45:53] into his image
[1:45:55] into his likeness
[1:45:56] praise the lord
[1:45:58] brother branham said
[1:46:00] we are privileged
[1:46:02] to be invited
[1:46:04] to mold our character
[1:46:06] to meet his
[1:46:08] praise the lord i believe that's a
[1:46:10] challenge we all should be willing to
[1:46:12] take yes amen undertake because you know
[1:46:16] as the lord
[1:46:17] moves and shapes and chips
[1:46:20] molds
[1:46:22] you know we we could be resistant
[1:46:25] we can be resentful
[1:46:27] we can be hard-headed
[1:46:29] but we can say yes lord
[1:46:32] yes lord
[1:46:33] remember the flesh of jesus went to the
[1:46:35] garden three times
[1:46:38] three times to ask if the cup could pass
[1:46:40] from it yes amen now obviously none of
[1:46:44] us have anything as severe as being
[1:46:46] crucified on a roman cross
[1:46:49] but three times
[1:46:51] so you think about that yes god help us
[1:46:54] amen
[1:46:56] lord just let my will be molded to be
[1:46:58] yours yes
[1:47:00] let your image be reflected through me
[1:47:03] let you be able to see yourself in me
[1:47:06] it's all the pieces that aren't
[1:47:09] i will say newton bennett but it's not
[1:47:11] newton bennett it's whoever whoever i
[1:47:14] really am newton's just the name my
[1:47:16] parents gave me as a human here but
[1:47:18] whoever i am that molded
[1:47:21] that chip those pieces away that
[1:47:24] that reflect that image that he saw in
[1:47:27] his mind
[1:47:28] amen
[1:47:29] and truly
[1:47:31] look
[1:47:32] as as michelangelo worked on that statue
[1:47:37] to my opinion
[1:47:38] i was in the man's mind but to my
[1:47:41] opinion
[1:47:42] as he chipped on that marble
[1:47:45] i don't believe he ever saw anything but
[1:47:47] david
[1:47:48] amen i don't believe you ever saw
[1:47:50] anything but moses that's all he ever
[1:47:52] saw as he chipped and shipped and
[1:47:54] shipped he didn't see him he didn't see
[1:47:56] a hunk of marble he saw moses yes he saw
[1:47:59] david
[1:48:00] god didn't see you as you came into this
[1:48:02] world speaking lies
[1:48:05] he saw you as the image
[1:48:07] in his mind
[1:48:09] and as the pieces get chipped away
[1:48:11] that's all god ever sees
[1:48:14] because you're always a son yes
[1:48:16] never not a son i love that
[1:48:19] i just love that
[1:48:21] never not a son always a son no matter
[1:48:24] what you did what you went through what
[1:48:26] happened where you are what
[1:48:28] always a son if you were ever a son
[1:48:30] always a son
[1:48:32] praise the lord so thankful
[1:48:35] god doesn't see
[1:48:37] all the other stuff he just sees that
[1:48:39] emphasis yes amen
[1:48:41] praise the lord
[1:48:43] amen god bless you love you appreciate
[1:48:46] you i pray something was said to bless
[1:48:47] and strengthen you in some way today
[1:48:50] amen remember the prayer requests we had
[1:48:53] those who weren't with us today
[1:48:54] stressing the lord's hand upon each one
[1:48:57] and
[1:48:57] bring them back the next appointed time
[1:48:59] but appreciate each one of you being
[1:49:00] here and being with us today
[1:49:04] yeah i'll give a short testimony about
[1:49:06] what you said so when i was in prayer
[1:49:09] this morning
[1:49:11] a woman came to my mind who had been
[1:49:15] two years ago when alejandro died i went
[1:49:18] away to another state
[1:49:20] and
[1:49:21] and i met a woman who was giving a word
[1:49:25] of knowledge and other things to people
[1:49:27] just as they wandered in and out prayer
[1:49:29] room
[1:49:30] and when i came up to her she just
[1:49:32] started speaking to me
[1:49:34] and then she said
[1:49:37] she finished by saying
[1:49:43] wrap your arms around me and love on me
[1:49:46] like you would on jesus
[1:49:50] and the lord reminded me
[1:49:54] of many times that i've been in the
[1:49:56] service
[1:49:58] and i had just
[1:50:00] i just hugged him
[1:50:03] i didn't care who was looking i didn't
[1:50:05] care he was there
[1:50:07] and i was hiding
[1:50:11] and jesus
[1:50:13] reminded me of this woman this morning
[1:50:16] she was wearing pants and she looked
[1:50:18] about as worldly as you could look
[1:50:21] dressed like a man she had her hair back
[1:50:26] and god reminded me
[1:50:29] of
[1:50:31] god in the woman
[1:50:34] and
[1:50:35] how he was working on her
