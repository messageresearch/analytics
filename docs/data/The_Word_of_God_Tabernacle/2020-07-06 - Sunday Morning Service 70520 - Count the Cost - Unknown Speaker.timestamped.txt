[0:05] hello everyone god bless you again today
[0:08] welcome to our livestream for this
[0:10] Sunday you know we had some adversity
[0:14] going on around today and this week and
[0:16] past couple weeks so probably going to
[0:19] as we are having livestream today will
[0:21] probably do it again next week and then
[0:23] we'll see where the Lord leads after
[0:25] that I talked to the Holiday Inn so
[0:27] we're okay still to go back in after a
[0:29] couple of weeks so just appreciate your
[0:32] patience with the things that have been
[0:33] going on with the kovat stuff and then
[0:35] kind of coming close to home to us here
[0:37] I'm very happy to report though that but
[0:40] the Zach who did test positive is doing
[0:43] very well had really mild symptoms
[0:46] probably been sicker with the flu before
[0:50] and sister Celia and sister Sharia had
[0:54] wanted to quarantine because they had
[0:56] been in contact with each other have
[0:57] been in contact with sister sashe who
[1:00] actually tested positive as well so we
[1:03] just felt like would with it that close
[1:05] and quarantine going on that just be
[1:08] better off would just do the livestream
[1:09] for right now and I believe brother
[1:13] Zach's quarantine is about up so I'm
[1:17] sure she Leah's sure I think try the
[1:19] kids had a little a couple little
[1:21] symptoms too but they're doing much
[1:23] better again it's just strange how this
[1:26] thing seems to kill some people and
[1:29] other people have had bad colds were
[1:32] sure worse than this oh it's kind of
[1:35] hard to tell the way this thing goes but
[1:38] trusting the Lord still believing the
[1:40] gut protects us and takes care of us and
[1:42] watches over us so we're here today and
[1:45] our home in Sonya and welcome you into
[1:47] our living room so god bless you today
[1:50] before we get started I want to open the
[1:53] service in prayer and have quite a few
[1:55] prayer
[1:56] to give to you today I'll try to make
[1:59] them brief me and brother Roger was on
[2:01] the job Friday and had to go do a bid
[2:03] and brother Rogers truck overheated and
[2:06] messed his engine up so just pray for
[2:08] him the Lord would just guide him and
[2:11] that was our work vehicle so what to do
[2:13] next and provide for him whatever the
[2:16] need is that we can do there also
[2:18] remember brother John Duncan I didn't
[2:21] find out until this week but brother
[2:23] John went to Las Vegas to be with his
[2:25] family over the holiday weeks I did talk
[2:28] to him since he got there safe and
[2:30] everything's going well he was happy to
[2:32] be with his family so please remember
[2:34] him as his trip continues and comes back
[2:37] to be with us here in Tucson so please
[2:39] remember brother John in prayer as well
[2:42] also a very serious somber request that
[2:45] I mentioned to you all of you know about
[2:48] sister Priscilla sister passing away
[2:50] this week unexpectedly hit the family
[2:54] very hard sister Priscilla last prayer
[2:56] for her family she feels very broken
[2:59] lost right now it's kind of difficult
[3:01] sometimes when you go through these real
[3:04] extreme adversities to understand why
[3:07] comes sometimes become our proverbial
[3:10] cry is why I actually had that in the
[3:13] book when I was talking about me and my
[3:15] wife and our son passing away it's it's
[3:18] a difficult situation but we're trusting
[3:20] and believing as Priscilla put in her
[3:21] text that
[3:23] quoting Joe the Lord gives the Lord
[3:25] takes away blessed be the name of the
[3:28] Lord she says I continue to worship and
[3:30] praise him and thank him but we are very
[3:32] thankful as I talked to angel and Maria
[3:36] day that they felt her sister had
[3:38] confessed and wanted to get baptized and
[3:40] was a Christian and believed the way
[3:43] that Priscilla was living in things so
[3:45] we're very thankful for that she was
[3:48] just waiting hoping to get baptized but
[3:50] I said well the Lord knows her heart and
[3:52] that's what matters the most baptism
[3:54] doesn't save you friend we know that
[3:57] that's just unto repentance so it's when
[4:00] you get the Holy Ghost is what the Lord
[4:02] identifying himself with us is what
[4:04] brings salvation the Holy Ghost in their
[4:07] lives so God knows her heart and where
[4:10] she is now so just trusting and
[4:11] believing that we continue to remember
[4:13] sister Priscilla her mother sister
[4:15] family in prayer of course if their
[4:17] family and brother angel said his family
[4:20] too so please remember them in prayer if
[4:23] you would for that situation again you
[4:25] continue to remember Zach and prayer
[4:27] sister Celia Sharia art and Gabriel
[4:31] Alice and their family home of course
[4:33] Tabitha Zach and Joel and Emma - as you
[4:37] know as I told you Micah did go get
[4:40] tested and he tested negative which we
[4:42] were all with Zach and Tabitha for
[4:44] Tabitha's birthday so me and Sonia have
[4:47] had absolutely no symptoms Tabitha and
[4:48] the kids have had no symptoms so we're
[4:50] very thankful the Lord has blessed us
[4:53] and kept us protected during this
[4:56] situation also brother Dave had text me
[4:59] a request he told me that sister Callie
[5:01] Kelley Batman had had a stroke again you
[5:07] know she's had several been susceptible
[5:09] to that we'll just trust in the Lord's
[5:11] hand upon sister Kelly he also sent me a
[5:14] couple requests one says please pray for
[5:17] Tyler a teenage friend of a customer /
[5:20] friend
[5:21] he needs a heart/liver transplant
[5:24] remember that prayer also he said please
[5:27] remember pray for Rob the husband of a
[5:30] Charlotte friend Kathy with liver cancer
[5:32] is having a difficult time drinking
[5:35] eating and keeping anything down so but
[5:38] the Dave sent those requests and today
[5:40] slit remember that in prayer as well
[5:42] sister Sheila also wanted us to please
[5:44] remember her brother Harlan seems like
[5:48] maybe Harlan's wife who's been intrical
[5:50] in this prayer requests that we've been
[5:52] giving that had a softer heart but we
[5:58] continued one a continue to remember
[6:00] calling in prayer sister Sheila is not
[6:03] sure she wants to make sure as I'm sure
[6:05] her brother Harlan does that his wife's
[6:08] apology and
[6:13] humbleness is sincere so let's just
[6:17] continue to remember her brother Harlan
[6:19] in prayers you all know we mentioned his
[6:21] the court date got postponed so there
[6:24] could be a very much a reason beyond
[6:25] covent want that happened so let's just
[6:28] please remember that sister Norma had a
[6:31] few requests want to remember in prayer
[6:34] she had four prayer requests she said my
[6:37] sister will be going into a private
[6:38] assisted living tomorrow breaks my heart
[6:41] but I can't take care for any longer
[6:43] only the Lord knows what tomorrow holds
[6:46] so please remember Tony sister Norma's
[6:49] sister in prayer also please pray for my
[6:52] daughter granddaughter and her friend
[6:54] this is an unspoken request
[6:56] she also says please pray for my husband
[6:59] I did not share it but his kidney
[7:01] function has gone down again I almost
[7:05] lost him in 2011 when everything was
[7:07] shutting down so let's remember Ronnie
[7:10] and prayer sister Norma's husband also
[7:13] her daughter Kathy is a disease that her
[7:17] stomach will not empty out of her food
[7:18] rots it does not digest and have that as
[7:23] a prayer request so I remember that in
[7:26] prayer that God's hand would be upon her
[7:28] upon her sister and upon these requests
[7:31] today remember her sister's name's Toni
[7:33] her husband's name is Ron Ronnie and
[7:36] their daughters Cathy so let's just
[7:38] remember these requests in prayer for
[7:40] sister Norma also from brother Dennis we
[7:44] want to continue remember his wife
[7:45] Leanne prayer Leah's getting very weary
[7:48] not only just the mental stress of
[7:51] dealing with this all the time in the
[7:52] cove
[7:53] but then the physical situation always
[7:55] wearing mask glam gallons clients
[7:58] complaints and things going on they're
[8:00] just I'm sure it's probably a pretty
[8:02] rough time having to deal with all of
[8:05] that in the medical world so please
[8:07] continue remember Lian prayer also asked
[8:10] to pray for one of Hurts granddaughters
[8:12] who's struggling with her identity as a
[8:14] young woman she told her mother she
[8:16] believes that she is attracted to other
[8:18] women so we're just gonna remember that
[8:21] in prayer we know how the devices that
[8:23] the enemy are today and of course the
[8:26] girl has her mother's support so that
[8:28] doesn't help but we do know that the
[8:30] Lord can intervene in this situation and
[8:32] that God's hand can be upon that and
[8:34] move upon that in a special way so
[8:37] please remember that in prayer too it's
[8:40] been a busy week a lot of things going
[8:42] on but God is still ever faithful and
[8:45] true we know he's always there just like
[8:47] a midweek service that I gave to you a
[8:49] little fault that I had very simple but
[8:51] it just came to me in prayer that it was
[8:53] very important to recognize and continue
[8:57] to remember that in all of what's going
[8:59] on God is still there he's never left us
[9:02] never forsook us he's still here he's
[9:05] still doing the same yesterday today and
[9:07] forever amen siliceous remember those I
[9:09] hope I got all the requests and many of
[9:12] them text in here I wanted to make sure

[9:19] and if I miss one for some reason
[9:20] somehow please forgive me but God knows
[9:23] our hearts God knows these requests and

[10:03] fact that you are there and you right

[11:50] holy lovely name of the Lord Jesus
[11:52] Christ we pray amen amen
[11:55] god bless you today start my recording
[11:59] here I want to go to st. Luke chapter 14
[12:04] to begin our scripture reading as all of
[12:06] you know we had the fourth of July
[12:08] weekend this weekend and that was
[12:10] yesterday and of course is the fifth of
[12:12] July and this thought came to back my
[12:14] heart I had had this a few weeks ago is
[12:17] going to be a midweek service but the
[12:18] Lord changed it and added a lot of
[12:20] things to it and just trust it be a
[12:23] blessing to get today so we're going to
[12:25] go to Saint Luke chapter 14 and going to
[12:28] begin reading with verse 25 st. Luke 14
[12:32] verse 25 we'll begin reading give you a
[12:36] moment to be get that there
[12:41] praise the Lord as I've said before it's
[12:43] a little different when you've preached
[12:45] for over 30 years to live congregations
[12:47] and you get feedback and you watch
[12:49] people's faces and things clicked on
[12:51] it's a little different now when you're
[12:53] sitting there at home but I trust you're
[12:56] there and you're interactive and you're
[12:58] participating even if I can't see or
[13:00] hear you so amen st. Luke 1425 and there
[13:07] can't and there was great multitudes
[13:09] with him and he turned and said unto
[13:11] them now look at this there's great
[13:15] multitudes following him now recognize
[13:18] that usually when there's great
[13:19] multitudes a a fair amount of that great
[13:23] multitude isn't really wanting to be
[13:25] with him their hearts not sincere
[13:27] they're not the heart is not in the
[13:29] right place counterfeit Christians as we
[13:34] call them may be today as we get into it
[13:36] and I want to as we've talked about that
[13:40] I want to get into this about counting
[13:43] the cost and then we want to talk about
[13:45] counting the cost today there was a
[13:48] great multitude with him and he turned
[13:51] and said unto them notice this great
[13:52] multitude is following Jesus and he
[13:55] turns he said if any man come to me and
[13:58] hate not his father and mother and wife
[14:00] and children and brethren and sisters
[14:04] yayyyy and his and his own life also he
[14:08] cannot be my disciple you see what Jesus
[14:11] is trying to tell them they're all
[14:12] following him they're all going along
[14:15] with him but one of their hearts where
[14:18] does their determination where is their
[14:20] dedication see he's wanting to make this
[14:22] clear he's wanted to find out so that
[14:25] they understand what the cost is for
[14:28] having to follow him a lot of people say
[14:30] they want to follow him and they get in
[14:32] the scripture and they look and say word
[14:34] says if you can
[14:35] with your mouth you are safe but they
[14:37] don't understand until they get into
[14:40] what it is to be a Christian to be able
[14:42] to count the cost and see what it's
[14:44] going to cost them and if they're
[14:45] willing to pay the price most people
[14:48] aren't willing to pay the price
[14:50] there's people then the Bible that had
[14:53] to pay the price there's people through
[14:54] the Dark Ages that many of them paid an
[14:56] ultimate price watching their children
[14:59] and their family members burn at the
[15:01] stake and killed and murdered
[15:03] there's people today that we still have
[15:05] to understand what it means to count the
[15:07] cost to be a Christian to be a Christian
[15:09] of true godly Christian today Holy Ghost
[15:12] field comes with a price friend comes
[15:15] with a cost that it will cost you and
[15:18] that's what Jesus warning is to them
[15:20] here he's trying to help them understand
[15:23] look you're following me but following
[15:25] me is gonna cost you you have to
[15:28] understand unless you're willing to
[15:29] forsake everything now he's talking
[15:31] about father mother wife children those
[15:34] things but what he's basically saying is
[15:36] I'm going to be first in your life or
[15:38] I'm not gonna be in your life that's the
[15:40] bottom line
[15:41] see so are we willing to pay that price
[15:43] are we willing to count that cost and
[15:46] understand that this is way worth more
[15:48] than anything else that we've ever ever
[15:52] if ever entered into sea and whosoever
[15:55] does not bear his cross and come after
[15:57] me cannot be my disciple see that
[16:00] crosses ours to bear for which of you
[16:03] intending to build a tower said it not
[16:06] down first and counted the cost whether
[16:08] he has sufficient to finish it see don't
[16:11] begin don't start something you can't
[16:13] finish I remember when I was a young kid
[16:16] that was kind of a motto my dad used to
[16:19] tell me that became a big theme don't
[16:21] start something can't finish and then
[16:23] even in school when you know these young
[16:26] kids and junior high and all were
[16:29] flexing our masculinity and
[16:31] bristling up and wanna fight who are
[16:34] like what don't something don't start
[16:35] something you can't finish in other
[16:37] words if you willing to tangle with me
[16:38] you better understand what you get into
[16:41] so it kind of became a thing see don't
[16:43] start something can't finish but truth
[16:45] is that's biblical it is biblical don't
[16:48] start something you can't finish see and
[16:50] if you're starting to follow Christ you
[16:52] got to understand what the cost is going
[16:53] to be and a lot of people don't
[16:55] understand that today they think that
[16:57] because they can live any kind of life
[16:59] and boot do any kind of thing and just
[17:01] say oh well I accept Jesus well I'm good
[17:03] now no it doesn't work that way and then
[17:05] go and be the same person you were the
[17:07] same life that same way and listen the
[17:09] same music and did the other same places
[17:12] doesn't work that way there's a cost
[17:14] that comes with it and thankfully when
[17:17] the Holy Ghost comes in there that cost
[17:19] becomes very minimal because we know
[17:21] what the reward is for count before
[17:23] before the cost that we give up for it
[17:26] but now his his lesson here is now you
[17:29] didn't build a tower you don't sit down
[17:32] first and count the cost say we know
[17:34] what this is going to take we know what
[17:36] this is gonna taste it's like a farmer a
[17:38] farmer knows that he's not gonna plant
[17:40] something in the heat of the summer
[17:43] something or certain things that taking
[17:46] more water or less water things like
[17:48] that I mean if I were to take a swirl
[17:50] and put it in Florida probably wouldn't
[17:52] last very long it's not adapted for that
[17:56] and a farmer is not going to plant
[17:57] things and that that the heat of the
[18:00] summer the heat of the Sun is gonna burn
[18:02] in scorch you're not going to get a crop
[18:03] like that so you count the cost you sit
[18:06] down and say what is the best time what
[18:08] is the best way do we have what it takes
[18:10] to finish this do we have what it takes
[18:12] to get this from beginning to end and
[18:15] that's what it means to Odyssey people
[18:17] I've known people to run this race for
[18:20] years I've known people to come to
[18:22] church
[18:22] it's believed for twenty thirty years
[18:24] and then he gets down to the end and
[18:26] away they go because they didn't
[18:28] understand that first to get what it
[18:30] needed to be able to count that cost and
[18:33] to go forward with what it was going to
[18:35] take to get beyond that point see got to
[18:38] count the cost first 29th first less
[18:42] happily after he hath laid the
[18:43] foundation is not able to finish it all
[18:46] that behold it and begin to mock him
[18:49] saying this man began to build and was
[18:51] not able to finish gotta finish what you
[18:54] started
[18:55] or what King going to make war against
[18:57] another King said it not down first and
[19:00] consulted whether he be able with ten
[19:02] thousand to meet them then cometh
[19:04] against him with twenty thousand or else
[19:07] while the other is yet oh great way off
[19:09] he sendeth in an embassy and desired
[19:12] conditions of peace so likewise
[19:14] whosoever he'd be of you that forsaketh
[19:17] not all forsaken not all that he have he
[19:20] cannot be my disciple salt is good that
[19:23] if salt is lost his savour wherewith
[19:25] shall it be seasoned it is neither fit
[19:28] for the linen nor yet for the dunghill
[19:30] yet men cast it out he that hath ears
[19:33] let him hear see so it brings us to that
[19:37] understanding who is willing to pay the
[19:40] price who is willing to understand what
[19:42] it cost and see it brings me to the
[19:46] dynamic of what's going on in this
[19:48] country today and a lot of the things is
[19:50] it there's a lot of knee-jerk as we call
[19:54] they used to call it I guess they call
[19:55] it again a lot of knee jerk reactions
[19:58] going on a lot of knee-jerk reactions in
[20:00] people's lives and companies and
[20:02] businesses and in things that moms are
[20:06] tearing down statues and
[20:08] and and taking parts of cities and
[20:10] wanting to get rid of the police these
[20:15] people even consider understand what it
[20:17] means to not have a policeman come to
[20:20] your home when you're in need of someone
[20:23] when you're sick or when some violence
[20:26] going on or when you're being threatened
[20:28] they not understand see that there comes
[20:32] there's a price with everything
[20:33] everything has a price and people don't
[20:36] understand the ramifications that come
[20:39] from this you think about this and I'm
[20:42] gonna be very specific but you think
[20:44] about this zone that was created in
[20:47] Seattle that was police free two people
[20:50] died in that zone in the past few weeks
[20:52] two people they'll probably never find
[20:55] the killer
[20:56] the people that were killed never got
[20:58] any medical help because the people in
[21:00] there wouldn't let them in they didn't
[21:02] understand what it was gonna cost to do
[21:04] what they did a lot of knee-jerk
[21:06] reactions no accountability no
[21:08] responsibility today it's like do
[21:10] whatever you want be whatever you want
[21:12] and and on these things that there's no
[21:15] repercussions well friend there is
[21:17] repercussions now even though it may be
[21:19] the repercussions in this country and
[21:21] then the things going on around here may
[21:23] be lessening the repercussions are still
[21:25] there friend because we all have to
[21:27] answer to one on one day at one time
[21:30] every one of us have to answer for our
[21:32] actions one day before the Lord
[21:34] everybody no matter who they are
[21:37] so it's accounting the cost to these
[21:39] people count the cost and understand
[21:41] yeah the the lack of responsibility
[21:44] that's there the lack of accountability
[21:47] there can be very very serious
[21:50] consequences for not thinking certain
[21:53] things through or as a Christian would
[21:55] be or pray about them first
[21:57] there can be very serious consequences
[22:00] on the back end of something less we've
[22:03] gone to the Lord and ask God prayed
[22:05] about it thought it through decided
[22:08] somehow is this going to be what what I
[22:13] can finish what I the result is going to
[22:16] end up on on a good end you know I mean
[22:19] if we dismantle and get rid of all the
[22:21] police what's going to be the result
[22:23] what's going to end up at the end of
[22:26] that the end of that if they actually
[22:28] get what they're talking to I don't
[22:30] believe they will but if they actually
[22:31] get what they wanted what do they think
[22:33] is gonna happen if all those horrible
[22:36] things happen in this little zone in
[22:38] Seattle for that short period of time
[22:40] and all the things that took place there
[22:43] besides the burgers what do you think is
[22:45] gonna happen if that happens around this
[22:47] nation around this country when all the
[22:50] major metropolis is you down on one one
[22:52] and nobody shows up there is nobody to
[22:54] even answer 9/11 because they've been
[22:57] defunded see no accountability no
[23:00] responsibility and grave consequences
[23:03] for people's actions see you gotta
[23:06] understand when you when you delve into
[23:08] this that you you there's a price to pay
[23:11] don't start what you can't finish see
[23:15] and that's what a lot of people do today
[23:17] these grave consequences can really make
[23:20] a big difference in people's lives and
[23:21] they've made a difference in in our
[23:24] lives because it leads to something and
[23:27] and and when it leads to that that are
[23:31] we willing to take that
[23:33] are we willing to accept that as the
[23:35] responsibility of what we did over here
[23:38] now see that's just it people will do
[23:41] things something bad will happen and
[23:43] when the bad happen because of their
[23:45] actions they'll blame somebody else for
[23:47] the result well this is not somebody
[23:49] else's fault to that result the result
[23:51] is your fault because of your actions
[23:53] but a lot of times people will act and
[23:56] react without knowledge or forethought
[23:59] or intelligence and they don't realize
[24:02] what it takes
[24:03] there's a lot of Christians in the world
[24:05] today they say well I want Jesus but
[24:09] they don't really know what they want
[24:10] they think they want him they think they
[24:13] know what they want but do they really
[24:15] because they go off and live any kind of
[24:17] life and do any kind of way and one day
[24:20] of their Christian or say they are one
[24:21] day they're next and they act this way
[24:23] or do these things and there's a cost
[24:25] that comes with that and they know
[24:27] people just don't understand what it
[24:29] takes and what the cost is when that
[24:31] when those men and those women came over
[24:35] into this new land they knew what it was
[24:37] going to take those people were willing
[24:39] to give their life so that you and I
[24:42] could enjoy the freedoms suppose it
[24:44] nouns kind of Gandhi you know recently
[24:46] but that we've enjoyed for all these
[24:48] years
[24:49] thankfully we still enjoyed the freedom
[24:51] of religion we still have the
[24:53] opportunity to worship the Lord Jesus to
[24:56] stream this live to talk about him to
[24:59] sing about him well the longer you're
[25:01] not in California they don't let you
[25:02] sing in your church services anymore but
[25:05] very liberal governor but anyway we
[25:07] could talk about him we can sing about
[25:09] it we can write about it we can publish
[25:11] about see we still had that freedom and
[25:14] those people were willing to
[25:16] for that and many of them did died they
[25:20] knew what the cost was going to be they
[25:21] were willing to pay the price because
[25:24] they knew what the end result was going
[25:25] to be and the end result is what the
[25:27] greatest country that probably existed
[25:29] come forth in the United States of
[25:31] America and we're thankful to be able to
[25:33] live here today and the freedom set into
[25:35] fours it's going in a different
[25:38] direction because we know many years ago
[25:39] turned its back on God but this is where
[25:42] we're at what was the cost of those
[25:45] actions the costs of turning down God
[25:48] has led us to a godless society and you
[25:51] can look around today and you can see
[25:53] what a godless society is all about it
[25:56] seems like the government is more
[25:58] interested in collecting every human on
[26:00] this planet's DNA than they are anything
[26:03] else tracking you tracing you what's it
[26:08] going to cost what is that going to to
[26:11] mean you know when you when you lay down
[26:16] and of this another old saying but when
[26:20] you lay down in the bed with a dog it's
[26:22] got fleas you gotta understand what
[26:24] that's gonna cost you you know the old
[26:26] saying is lay in the bed with the dog
[26:27] it's got sleeves you're gonna get fleas
[26:29] that's what the cost is that's what it's
[26:32] going to cost you you decide to do that
[26:34] it seems odd with all the dog stuff
[26:37] going on today but that's just an old
[26:38] stigma used to have many many years ago
[26:40] you lay in the bed with the dogs got
[26:42] fleas you get fleas that's the result it
[26:45] costs something there's something that
[26:47] comes as a cost that comes with doing
[26:49] that and that's what that cost is now I
[26:52] want to keep going further because I
[26:54] want the I want to evolve this into
[26:57] something that's a little greater than
[26:58] just just those superficial things we're
[27:01] talking about because the cost is even
[27:03] greater than that see because there's
[27:07] the cost that comes with a finish let's
[27:12] just say I'm gonna go to Roman's here
[27:15] Romans chapter 4 if you want to go ahead
[27:16] and turn there Romans chapter 4 but when
[27:19] when you go shopping you go to the
[27:21] grocery store to go shopping you got to
[27:24] make sure that and I've been in line
[27:27] behind people before and when me and
[27:29] Sonia we're struggling at times we had
[27:32] to do the same thing you go through
[27:34] there you take a calculator and you say
[27:36] this is this much and this is this much
[27:38] and this is this much and we really need
[27:42] or would like to have that but we can't
[27:44] get it because we've reached our budget
[27:45] and you got to look in the cart and say
[27:47] okay are we better with this are we
[27:49] better with this we'd have this you got
[27:52] to count the cost on how many times I've
[27:54] set behind people in a supermarket line
[27:56] and they're having to say ok we'll take
[27:59] that off and okay we'll take that off
[28:01] and and the cash you're sitting there
[28:03] trying to take all these items off of
[28:04] their bill because they don't have
[28:06] sufficient to pay for it if you don't
[28:08] have sufficient to pay for it see at the
[28:10] end of that there's a finishing time
[28:13] there's a finishing time after you've
[28:16] brought your actions forth you've
[28:18] shopped right that's a simple analogy
[28:21] you've shopped at the end of your
[28:24] shopping there comes a reconciliation
[28:26] there comes a time of reckoning where
[28:28] you've got to pay for what you bought or
[28:31] what you just took you got to pay for it
[28:34] that's the finish line you can walk out
[28:36] the door after you've paid for it but
[28:38] you got to pay for it first and it comes
[28:41] with a cost the groceries aren't fee
[28:43] free they come with a cost you got to
[28:46] pay for them well the pain the cost
[28:48] comes at the end to see was this worth
[28:52] the price and when that it comes then
[28:55] you can see that's when it reconciles
[28:57] and
[28:59] was it worth it or not now in Romans
[29:02] chapter 4 I want to read beginning with
[29:05] verse 20 talk about Abraham for just a
[29:08] moment I just got a couple more thoughts
[29:10] to add to this and and then the
[29:13] completion of this and and we'll go for
[29:15] today but in Romans chapter 4 most of
[29:19] you probably know this but talking about
[29:21] Abraham here it let's begin with verse
[29:26] 18 who against hope believed in hope
[29:28] that he might become the father of many
[29:30] nations according to that which was
[29:32] spoken so shall thy seed be be not weak
[29:35] in faith he considered not his own body
[29:37] now dead when he was about 100 years old
[29:39] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[29:42] he staggered not at the promise of God
[29:45] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[29:49] giving glory to God
[29:51] and being now look at this and being
[29:53] fully persuaded that he had promised he
[29:59] was able also to perform so what Abraham
[30:04] is saying or what Paul sang about
[30:06] Abraham is that Abraham believed in whom
[30:09] he knew as God Almighty the
[30:13] self-existing elohim he's talking about
[30:17] Abraham as he knew God he staggered not
[30:21] at the promise of God through unbelief
[30:22] strong in faith strong in faith giving
[30:25] glory to God being fully persuaded that
[30:29] what he had promised who he God Abraham
[30:34] was fully persuaded and his faith
[30:38] identified him to God as righteous
[30:41] because of his faith because he was
[30:44] fully persuaded that the god that he had
[30:47] faith in that started this is faithful
[30:51] and able to perform or finish it abraham
[30:56] was faded and that faith that ability
[31:00] that that that he had that abraham had
[31:04] fully persuaded that faith is what
[31:08] accounted him to god as righteousness
[31:11] and remember righteousness is a person
[31:14] norse someone in the state of there
[31:16] ought to be condition they're in the
[31:19] condition they're in the place that they
[31:21] ought to be with God oh that's the
[31:24] perfect place I mean that's utopia
[31:26] that's what the world looks for utopia
[31:28] that's it see but that's probably what
[31:31] they're doing with these cop free zones
[31:34] with with the cop you there weren't
[31:36] supposed to be police to begin with
[31:37] there were no police the Garden of Eden
[31:39] and will be police in the new world and
[31:41] the new city the New Jerusalem there
[31:43] will be new police and that's of the
[31:45] world that's of the city that's of the
[31:47] devil we won't need that we won't need
[31:49] hospitals we won't need doctors medicine
[31:51] we don't have any Colvin or you can
[31:53] serene those things in that world it's
[31:55] just none of that and so we don't have
[31:59] to worry about that those people they're
[32:00] thinking at the Utopia well the utopia
[32:03] is here not there but Abraham knew what
[32:06] it was and he knew and was and
[32:09] I faith enough to believe that he who
[32:12] had started it he who had promised was
[32:15] able to perform it amen and I believe we
[32:19] should have that same faith the same God
[32:22] that did that is the same God that's
[32:23] gonna finish it
[32:24] God doesn't start something he can't
[32:26] finish understand even he starts it he's
[32:30] able to finish it when he finishes it
[32:32] then you know what it is done therefore
[32:35] it was imputed to him it was accounted
[32:38] to him as righteousness or as a
[32:42] righteous act from a righteous person as
[32:45] God seeing Abraham in his ought to be
[32:48] condition God help me
[32:50] that's exactly the place that I believe
[32:52] each one of us want to be exact place
[32:55] each one of us should be it was
[32:57] accounted to him as righteous because he
[32:59] believed that the God that said he would
[33:02] do it was able to perform it so when we
[33:05] get into something and we understand if
[33:06] God has started it then God's going to
[33:09] be the one to finish it and if he is not
[33:11] able to finish it he wasn't started and
[33:16] I believe that excuse me I believe that
[33:18] for us I believe that if God started
[33:22] that working you God would not call you
[33:25] or commissioned you to do something if
[33:27] God didn't already know that you could
[33:29] do it why would God call you knowing
[33:32] that you had that you don't have the
[33:34] ability to do it you don't have the
[33:37] ability to finish it if God calls you to
[33:40] something he'll finish
[33:41] you'll finish it through you but you'll
[33:44] finish it because it's his
[33:45] responsibility see then it becomes his
[33:48] responsibility and not ours
[33:50] were just here as servants of the Lord
[33:52] we're just here to give our lives to him
[33:55] and servitude and whatever he calls for
[33:57] us to do that's what we want to do
[33:59] that's but that becomes our life that's
[34:01] what we want to do now st. John I want
[34:05] to continue with this frame of thought
[34:06] now st. John chapter 5 verse 31 seeing
[34:12] John chapter 5 verse 31 look at this for
[34:15] a moment if I bear witness to myself my
[34:20] witness is not true there is another the
[34:23] beareth witness of me and I know that
[34:25] the witness which he witnesses of me is
[34:27] true ye sent unto John and he bear
[34:31] witness unto the truth but I receive not
[34:35] testimony for man but of these things I
[34:39] say that you might be saved he was a
[34:41] burning and shining light burning
[34:50] shining light that you were willing for
[34:52] a season to rejoice in this life but I
[34:56] had greater witness that I had of John
[34:58] the works of the father here we go but I
[35:02] have greater witness than that of John
[35:04] for the works which the father hath
[35:06] given me to finish look at this now the
[35:09] works that the father has given me to
[35:11] finish the same works that I do bear
[35:14] witness of me that the father hath sent
[35:16] me so see that work that God had to get
[35:21] finished
[35:22] God didn't entrust this to just anybody
[35:24] God didn't entrusts us to Abraham God
[35:27] didn't trust this to brother Branham God
[35:29] didn't entrust this to Adam or to any
[35:31] great man he came himself he sent His
[35:35] only begotten Son
[35:38] he came himself to finish this work and
[35:41] Jesus in that corporal body is declaring
[35:45] the greater witness of John that the
[35:47] works was the father had given him to
[35:51] finish the same works I do because he
[35:54] was able to finish it he was able to do
[35:57] it he was able to complete what God had
[36:01] given him to do because he God has Jesus
[36:04] God in flesh came himself to do this
[36:07] work didn't trust anybody else in it but
[36:10] he came to do it himself as he was the
[36:11] only one that could do it
[36:13] he was the lamb the sacrificial lamb
[36:15] that was to be sacrificed the only one
[36:18] sinless burn of a born of a virgin that
[36:22] could that could actually complete this
[36:24] work that had been that had begun nor
[36:27] did he begin it began in the Garden of
[36:29] Eden it began back in Genesis and Jesus
[36:33] was able to complete that part of that
[36:36] work what that ultimate sacrifice it was
[36:40] identified all through the Bible Paschal
[36:42] Lamb and so forth we know but it was
[36:45] completed when Jesus came himself and
[36:48] completed it and the work that was given
[36:51] him to finish he was able to finish it
[36:53] because he was the only one that could
[36:55] do it just like the works that God give
[36:58] each one of us that that we are able to
[37:01] do he did not entrust it with somebody
[37:03] else he did it himself
[37:05] it was the only way that it could be
[37:07] finished now we have a job to do we have
[37:12] a job to finish we have a part to play
[37:16] amen
[37:17] we have a part to play
[37:19] look at this a couple of scriptures here
[37:22] with this before I close in Philippians
[37:25] let me read this I got this one quote I
[37:26] want to read to you failed to print it
[37:29] out but I've got it here on my phone so
[37:32] bear with me just a moment
[37:34] it's what house will you build me a lot
[37:38] of you probably will recognize this but
[37:41] in finishing that work see look at this
[37:43] and finishing that work because we all
[37:45] have that work to finish and what house
[37:49] will you build me brother man was
[37:51] talking to the people what house you
[37:53] would build mean really if you've
[37:55] listened to it it's it's really more of
[37:57] a dedication talking a interaction
[38:00] brother branham to the congregation
[38:01] there it's brother green has opened the
[38:03] church they're here and tapped in Tucson
[38:06] for the people and for those to come and
[38:09] attend and brother Branham was there and
[38:11] dedicating the place he said now there
[38:14] was many people who followed me and
[38:16] that's not unusual usually a person we
[38:20] the people love one another and it love
[38:23] will drive you to do things you don't
[38:26] think you would do and many of that love
[38:29] will drive you see to do things you did
[38:32] not think that you would do if you love
[38:34] the Lord Jesus like we should it'll
[38:37] cause us to do things we never thought
[38:38] we would act in ways or give up things
[38:41] or be the way that we're supposed to be
[38:44] based on his word because we love him
[38:46] not cuz were scared of him it's like we
[38:49] talked about last week it's not a ruling
[38:50] of fear friend
[38:51] it's a ruling of love and of reverence
[38:55] and of respect and obedience see that's
[38:58] where God rules his children God we
[39:01] follow him because we love him not
[39:03] because we're scared he gonna send us to
[39:05] hell but because we love Him see but
[39:07] Vantage love will cause you to do things
[39:10] the right kind of love
[39:11] cause you to do things you didn't think
[39:12] you would do many of you left your homes
[39:15] you left all just Tuco come out here
[39:18] into this desert many has called me many
[39:22] has asked me shall we come to Arizona
[39:23] would it be a good place for us well as
[39:26] it was said I don't take this from us to
[39:29] summons and those who love living here
[39:31] but this is what he said many has asked
[39:35] me shall we come to Arizona
[39:36] give me a good place for us well as it
[39:38] was said all about Moses in them it was
[39:41] no place of fruit no place of
[39:43] pomegranate although I think brother
[39:48] Tamas Inc has got some nice pomegranates
[39:50] on a tree they got in their yard there
[39:51] but anyway no place to prove no place of
[39:54] pomegranate still not Moses of course
[39:56] here there is not much work to do and
[39:59] living is high and the cost of living is
[40:02] high it's really a rough place to live
[40:04] is Tucson Arizona wages are poor and
[40:07] food is high and rent it's a horrible
[40:09] place to live in that manner but it's
[40:12] healthy it's dry and we sometimes we
[40:15] mustn't get our minds fashioned on the
[40:17] things of this earth we must look to the
[40:20] leading of the Holy Spirit but one thing
[40:22] that troubled me and coming here and
[40:24] telling people what you should not calm
[40:26] or you should come that I leave up to
[40:29] each individual and the way that the
[40:31] Lord leads each individual to do I think
[40:33] every one of us should do that be led by
[40:36] the spirit on what to do many of you
[40:39] here are from around Jeffersonville the
[40:41] congregation there and you've come out
[40:43] here now the thing that bothered me was
[40:45] a place of worship and I realized as I
[40:48] read in the scripture here Stephen is
[40:50] addressed just before his death for they
[40:52] stone him immediately afterwards for his
[40:54] message he was speaking he said our
[40:56] fathers talking of Hebrews in the early
[41:00] days how that they tried to find favor
[41:02] for God to build a place of worship he
[41:05] said that Solomon built him a house or a
[41:07] building we are acquainted with the
[41:09] story which actually came the title of
[41:13] this message while house will you build
[41:14] me but I like his next words howbeit the
[41:17] Most High dwelleth not in houses that's
[41:19] made with hands in another place over an
[41:22] eye they said a body has thou prepared
[41:24] me see sacrifice offerings buildings so
[41:27] forth but a body has thought prepared me
[41:29] well we realized that we were that he
[41:33] was speaking then of the body where God
[41:35] tabernacle in Christ but look at this
[41:37] now so what I want to get to but I
[41:39] believe today that the question has come
[41:42] - brother green to move here him and
[41:46] sister green giving up their place back
[41:48] in the east also back in Texas to come
[41:51] here to start with nothing just simply
[41:55] by an inspiration feeling that they
[41:57] should do it I appreciate men that will
[42:00] follow the leading of Christ regardless
[42:03] of the cost it costs them amen god help
[42:07] us all to follow that leading of the
[42:09] Lord at whatever cost it may cost him
[42:12] God knows me and my wife at most a few
[42:16] times and do it based on what I feel or
[42:19] what we feel as a leading of the Lord
[42:21] and there's been a time then you know
[42:25] left a home and left my friends and left
[42:28] my family and except for sung and the
[42:30] kids and you know my immediate family
[42:32] mom sister Nana
[42:34] left a good job ahead for 10 years and
[42:36] all they go to a place I had no church
[42:38] had no building and no job had no money
[42:40] but God took care because he always
[42:43] takes care and sometimes I look and can
[42:46] see some of the results that God had
[42:48] just from obedience just obedience to
[42:51] his word I appreciate a man that will
[42:54] follow the leading of Christ regardless
[42:56] of the cost it cost them you know
[42:58] brother brother Greece just
[42:59] as he's sitting there listening to
[43:01] brother branham say this and he's
[43:03] thinking to himself is that what I did
[43:05] sometimes you don't even really know it
[43:07] for sure but you feel that you do
[43:09] something that you feel on your heart to
[43:11] do and that's just the Lord leading it
[43:13] that's the Lord leading and see God
[43:15] doesn't always come down with a baseball
[43:17] bat or come whisper in your ear give an
[43:19] audible voice it'll just be a slight
[43:22] unction something in your heart that God
[43:23] puts there and you know it's got doing
[43:26] it you don't realize the ramifications
[43:28] or what all's being involved in it but
[43:31] God is in control and all we have to do
[43:34] is what the Lord leads us and we feel
[43:36] that to do regardless of the cost that
[43:39] cost them though the whole world may be
[43:41] your very best friends
[43:43] think that you're wrong but it isn't
[43:46] wrong to you as long as you feel there
[43:48] is something behind it it's God moving
[43:51] you it's never wrong and it's onion and
[43:54] he'll always pan out right and it might
[43:58] not always be exactly what you thought
[44:00] or what other people may think or maybe
[44:03] not even pan out exactly immediately but
[44:05] when it reaches it's finished when it
[44:07] reaches its place of completion whatever
[44:09] that is you recognize and God will show
[44:12] and God recognized he was in it he was
[44:16] doing the leading it'll pan out right
[44:18] see God always bring it to the place
[44:21] that it needs to be as it comes forward
[44:23] to us now I want to go to this
[44:26] scriptures I had you turn to of
[44:27] Philippians and I had to say that to
[44:30] brother BAM said appreciate someone who
[44:34] will fill the leading of the Lord do
[44:37] what God leads them to do regardless of
[44:39] what the cost is God will lead us to it
[44:42] God will show us amen Philippians now
[44:45] now we got to understand
[44:47] we are the bride now I'm not just
[44:51] talking about me my wife our church
[44:52] family I'm talking about the bride
[44:55] internationally there's a bride
[44:56] worldwide there's those that God is
[44:58] called
[44:59] commission filled with the Holy Ghost
[45:01] internationally around the world we are
[45:03] that bride this bride has a
[45:06] responsibility it's like I said the
[45:08] other day when a man marries a wife he
[45:12] doesn't marry a wife and take her across
[45:14] the threshold of the house and sit down
[45:15] to couch well that's the end of it
[45:19] that's that was a great wedding well
[45:21] we'll have a nice marriage whoo we just
[45:23] said here no there's something to do
[45:26] there's always something to do
[45:28] there's there's there's things to be
[45:31] done the husband there's things to be
[45:33] done the wife the bride today God does
[45:35] his part
[45:36] it's our part - there's a part here on
[45:39] this earth that we have to do that we
[45:41] have to finish because this bright at
[45:44] this time is at the end we don't know
[45:48] how much time we've got left I think God
[45:51] gives us the time and I appreciate the
[45:53] time to be able to continue to do the
[45:55] work of the Lord whatever he calls us to
[45:58] do whatever he asked for us to do we
[46:01] want to do it we want to reach out to as
[46:03] many people as we can reach out to we
[46:06] want to try to help as many people as we
[46:08] can help we want to bring to Christ as
[46:10] many people as we possibly can if the
[46:12] Lord will just shine his grace upon us
[46:14] and help us to do it that's the time we
[46:16] have but we don't know how much time we
[46:19] have we don't know that but I do know
[46:21] that we're at the end and we do know
[46:23] we're at a rapture time whether will any
[46:26] of us be alive to see it or not we don't
[46:28] know whether I will we don't know but we
[46:30] know we're at the end we're at the end
[46:33] according to the scripture there's that
[46:36] endtime bride that has its part to play
[46:38] there's that alive and remain group
[46:40] that's going to have its part to play
[46:42] that's
[46:43] to complete this time because see once
[46:46] that Gentile bride goes in the rapture
[46:48] that's going to be the end of that
[46:51] dispensation of time of the gods working
[46:54] and dealing with the Gentile you'll go
[46:56] to the Jews then that'll be the finish
[46:59] of it then that Gentile bride and we're
[47:01] all at the wedding married marriage
[47:02] supper of the Lamb
[47:03] together with that table stretched
[47:05] thousands of miles long seed together
[47:07] having fellowship that'll be the finish
[47:10] the end of that
[47:11] well this bride has that part to play
[47:13] it's our part to play it's ours to do
[47:15] Philippians chapter 1 verse 3 look at
[47:18] this I thank my god upon every
[47:21] remembrance of you always in every
[47:24] prayer of mine for you all making
[47:26] requests with joy for your fellowship in
[47:29] the gospel from the day from the first
[47:32] day until now being confident of this
[47:34] very thing that he who is that he again
[47:39] just like Abraham had who is that me
[47:41] that's God amen he that begun which
[47:46] begun had begun a good work in you will
[47:50] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[47:54] or finish it complete it do it because
[47:59] he knows that you were able to do it you
[48:03] were able to finish you were able to
[48:05] complete what God had put on us to do
[48:08] when he began the work but look whose
[48:11] work it is is not my work it's not your
[48:14] work it's his work he has begun a good
[48:18] work he began the work in me he began it
[48:22] in me he began in you because
[48:24] knew that you were able to finish that
[48:26] work and he said that as I just said
[48:31] that you were able to do it but he says
[48:33] he began the good work he will perform
[48:37] that work well how does he perform it
[48:39] how does he do it
[48:41] how does he completed through us through
[48:45] this endtime bride that God has placed
[48:47] on this earth we had that part to play
[48:49] he started it so that makes it his work
[48:53] I've said that many times even about
[48:55] this church even about us our
[48:57] congregation and us together as a church
[48:59] as a congregation as a group of people
[49:01] I've said that many times is his work
[49:04] not mine not yours it's his work so if
[49:06] it's his work he's responsible for it if
[49:08] he's responsible that he's responsible
[49:10] for that that is a part of that work and
[49:13] we are all a part of that work if he's
[49:15] responsible that that is his
[49:17] responsibility to keep this work to the
[49:20] place where it is where he wants it to
[49:22] be and he's going to perform it or
[49:25] finish it or bring it to its completion
[49:27] whatever that is every work in us every
[49:31] work in this bride internationally that
[49:33] we're doing from the first church age
[49:35] when God began to deal with the Gentiles
[49:37] and poured out his spirit upon all flesh
[49:39] till today when God has reached to the
[49:42] place through the opening of the word
[49:44] and bringing its message and he himself
[49:46] coming in the Holy Spirit and putting
[49:49] himself in you and completing that work
[49:52] through you that he already determined
[49:55] his work his work that he'll finished
[49:59] he'll perform but he's doing it in me
[50:02] he's doing it in
[50:04] and he's found you faithful and worthy
[50:07] to be able to finish it to be able to do
[50:10] it it's God working through us it's our
[50:13] responsibility it's our duty it's our
[50:16] time God has given it to us count the
[50:19] cost
[50:20] are you able to finish it I've got a
[50:25] little midweek coming up this week I
[50:27] want you to listen to but talking about
[50:30] counterfeit a lot of counterfeit today a
[50:32] lot of counterfeit in the world today
[50:35] but again where there's counterfeit
[50:37] there's a regal there's a real you're
[50:40] the genuine and God has called you for
[50:43] that purpose God has called you for that
[50:45] reason I don't care how old you are God
[50:47] young you are I don't care how long
[50:49] you've been in faith how long you had
[50:50] the Holy Ghost whether you preach or
[50:52] whether you a male or female doesn't
[50:55] matter God has called you if God has
[50:59] called you the God is in you to complete
[51:01] that work to finish that work it's our
[51:04] responsibility to do there's people
[51:06] depending on us you know there's people
[51:09] depending on us in the scripture
[51:11] there's people depending on us look at
[51:13] this Hebrews I'm going to finish with
[51:15] this scripture but look in Hebrews
[51:16] chapter 11 we go to the faith chapter
[51:18] the last two verses
[51:21] it goes through all the history all the
[51:24] things the prophets and the great men
[51:26] and women in the Bible and and they're
[51:29] brought out in this great time of faith
[51:31] this great chapter of faith but at the
[51:34] end it shows the finishing part it began
[51:39] here and it began in faith see faith is
[51:43] the substance what brought him down on
[51:45] the day of Pentecost faith if they
[51:49] didn't have faith they would have
[51:50] scattered long before the Spirit came
[51:51] down if they didn't have faith to
[51:53] believe they would have never been there
[51:55] in the upper room they wouldn't have
[51:57] been there mulling over this thinking oh
[51:58] I I think it's coming I think we got it
[52:00] I think it's over I think what are we
[52:02] doing here why did we come here what is
[52:04] the purpose of all this then it said
[52:06] there they would have they would have
[52:07] disbanded but they have faith faith is a
[52:10] substance that was the beginning as it
[52:13] began it came through
[52:16] of course I talked about our time now it
[52:20] began with Adam and Eve in the Garden of
[52:24] Eden that it came through you see all
[52:27] these men of faith and Enoch and Abraham
[52:29] and know it you see all those men of
[52:31] faith and Rahab women of faith that come
[52:34] through the scripture it took faith and
[52:39] it comes down to the end and at the very
[52:42] end the last two chapters now it comes
[52:45] to a finish it's it's a closed in my
[52:49] opinion faith began in God said God said
[52:52] in the beginning
[52:53] let there be and there was that was the
[52:56] beginning remember it took faith for God
[52:59] to believe it when he said it he had
[53:01] faith to believe that what he spoke it
[53:03] was going to come forth faith is a
[53:04] substance well that began now at the end
[53:07] there's a finish
[53:09] what is that finish that finishes up to
[53:11] us that finishes in our hands look what
[53:15] it says Hebrews 11 39 look what it says
[53:17] and these all having obtained a good
[53:21] report through faith received not the
[53:24] promise they didn't receive what is that
[53:28] promise that promises the completion the
[53:31] promise is the finishing of it the
[53:34] promise is the complete change not just
[53:37] the spirit change soul change I'm
[53:39] talking about
[53:40] I even a body change the completion of
[53:43] that promise see they did not receive
[53:45] that promise God have provided some
[53:48] better way some better thing for us that
[53:52] they without us should not be made
[53:56] perfect them without us the dependence
[54:00] is on us it's in our hands to finish
[54:03] this work it's in our hands to complete
[54:06] this have we counted the cost have you
[54:09] counted what it would take have we
[54:11] counted that it might cost our families
[54:13] have we counted that it might cost our
[54:15] best friends have we counted that it
[54:18] might that we might lose our moms dads
[54:22] families what have we counted that it
[54:25] might cost our job that we counted that
[54:27] it might cost our are our parties in
[54:30] whatever have we counted these things to
[54:33] realize to be able to finish this it's
[54:37] got to take someone that God has called
[54:39] and set aside
[54:41] and thus willing to be
[54:44] his servant and to be lived by his
[54:47] spirit to reach this place that us
[54:51] coming into this completion finishes
[54:55] that to the place of perfection those
[54:59] people are depending on us
[55:01] those people are waiting on us we're
[55:04] waiting we're depending we're trusting
[55:07] God to help them be with us and let this
[55:09] live through us so that we finished this
[55:13] work he's faithful at beginning
[55:15] he's faithful that finishes it through
[55:17] to us he's going to finish that work
[55:19] it's up to us it's our responsibility
[55:21] it's our time don't start something you
[55:25] can't finish amen it's that time that we
[55:28] that we finish this now this this has
[55:31] come to the end I hope and pray I'm here
[55:35] to see it happen I hope all of us are
[55:37] listening to be here today
[55:39] I hope we all are here to see this
[55:42] happen to be a part of this and to see
[55:45] that body changed in the moment and
[55:47] tweaking of an EIN go to beating the
[55:49] Lord so shall we ever be with him if
[55:52] we're not we'll still be there
[55:53] won't bear the other because those that
[55:55] have gone before will raise first but
[55:58] God has given us that time to finish
[56:01] this you know men men and women and
[56:05] godly people through their time they've
[56:07] done their part brother Branham did his
[56:09] part brother man did his part God took
[56:11] him home that's just part done and
[56:14] that's it a lot of people want to dig
[56:16] all that up and bring it back and and
[56:19] make him their pastor and marry them and
[56:21] things like that I don't agree with that
[56:23] because God has men of God today fill
[56:26] with the Holy Spirit to do that part if
[56:29] God stopped calling men to the gospel of
[56:32] Christ and to minister this and to bring
[56:35] this in the past story away and to marry
[56:37] into Barry and then this is over let's
[56:40] just forget it we'll just go home it's
[56:44] up to us to finish it
[56:46] brother branham did his part it's up to
[56:48] us to finish this bride this last day
[56:50] have we counted the cost have we
[56:52] understood what it was going to take to
[56:54] finish it a lot of people falling away
[56:56] today
[56:57] there probably be even a greater falling
[56:59] away maybe think of brother Billy power
[57:02] to pass away what might happen before
[57:05] the rapture save Billy Paul passes away
[57:06] mine and all the things has been said
[57:09] all these years about California sinking
[57:12] it will sink shark swimming through the
[57:15] door of the bait company and all those
[57:16] they said and it will happen I believe
[57:18] it just don't know when that's up to God
[57:21] I know I'm not the interpreter of that
[57:23] dream or that vision that's up to God
[57:25] God's wonders father bring that forth
[57:27] I'm just responsible for bringing forth
[57:29] the gospel believing in finishing this
[57:32] work but what if it were to happen how
[57:33] many people would leave at that point
[57:36] there's great been been many people
[57:38] leave
[57:40] but there's gonna be a bride there's
[57:43] going to be a genuine there's gonna be a
[57:46] true a real that's gonna stand counter
[57:49] the cost and realize what it takes and
[57:52] understands what the cost is and is
[57:54] willing to pay that price at whatever it
[57:57] might be you know things happen in our
[58:01] lives some of its traumatic some of it's
[58:04] hard some of it'll send you to your
[58:07] knees that's where we should be anyway
[58:10] but God has a way of bringing into that
[58:13] place for all of us to grow stronger
[58:17] closer to him and more like him
[58:20] amen when you're broken there's nobody I
[58:23] know better to take the pieces and put
[58:25] them all back together exactly the way
[58:27] they're supposed to be when you're lost
[58:29] there's no one I know of better that can
[58:32] find you than Jesus Christ he's the only
[58:35] one and he brings it and when he does it
[58:37] he makes it all work perfect amen you
[58:41] know when we do a jigsaw puzzle we take
[58:44] all the pieces and we put them all where
[58:46] they look like they go and they make
[58:48] this great picture and it looks just
[58:49] like the picture on the box and it's
[58:52] beautiful picture but if you look at it
[58:53] you still see all the scenes and
[58:56] everything if where all these pieces
[58:58] were put together and all but you know
[58:59] what God puts it all together he makes
[59:01] the picture complete there's no more
[59:04] scenes to say over here was a piece over
[59:06] here was a piece not just it just makes
[59:08] it all nice and smooth it just looks
[59:10] like a beautiful picture it all
[59:12] completes itself exactly right when you
[59:14] look in it and it reflects Jesus Christ
[59:19] amen that's the point he wants it to be
[59:22] I believe that's where we all want it to
[59:24] be amen but make sure that we count the
[59:27] cost first don't just say oh I'm a
[59:29] Christian oh I believe the message well
[59:31] that's all fine and good but there's a
[59:33] whole lot more to it than just that are
[59:35] we willing to to do what it takes to
[59:38] bring it to the end
[59:39] I'm thankful there were men and women
[59:41] back to over 200 years ago that were
[59:44] willing to pay the price they're willing
[59:46] to count the cost I'm thankful
[59:48] there was a man named William Marion
[59:49] Branham who was willing to pay the price
[59:51] and to date the cost of whatever N and
[59:54] medon Brenham who probably had to deal
[59:58] with as much or more than he did through
[1:00:00] it all who was willing to pay the price
[1:00:02] the cost that it would take to go
[1:00:05] through all that to bring this message
[1:00:06] to bring this word to a bride to be so
[1:00:09] willing and so yielded that God could
[1:00:12] use that man to a place that people were
[1:00:15] given their lives back and this word but
[1:00:17] the word came and thank God that he was
[1:00:20] willing to bring that word so that we
[1:00:22] can have it today and the moving of the
[1:00:25] Holy Spirit to instruct him to put that
[1:00:28] word and tape and put that word in the
[1:00:30] book and put that in his food in the
[1:00:32] storehouse so that we can go to that
[1:00:34] storehouse today and we can consume it
[1:00:37] ourselves I wasn't there never heard it
[1:00:39] live but I can still consume it today
[1:00:42] I'm thankful there was somebody willing
[1:00:44] to do that and I pray that we today are
[1:00:48] in the position that we understand the
[1:00:50] cost and willing
[1:00:51] pay the price now there's things down
[1:00:54] the road that may happen that we don't
[1:00:55] know about I mean when when we were just
[1:00:59] coming I was just coming back to the
[1:01:01] Lord my wife giving her heart to the
[1:01:03] Lord we had no idea wanting to start a
[1:01:05] family that Lord was going to take our
[1:01:07] first son we don't know those things
[1:01:09] sometimes they're down the road but we
[1:01:12] do know that I'm willing that we're
[1:01:14] willing to do whatever it takes for
[1:01:16] whatever it costs were willing to do it
[1:01:19] help us to do it
[1:01:21] amen it's a call today that your heart's
[1:01:24] desire
[1:01:25] and I believe that's where God will take
[1:01:27] it and use it at someone that God could
[1:01:31] use brother Bannon always said several
[1:01:33] times he said if God could just give one
[1:01:35] man who was willing in his complete
[1:01:39] control he could turn this world upside
[1:01:40] down it's got to be a willing subject
[1:01:43] amen gotta be a willing subject praise
[1:01:47] the Lord - god bless you pray something
[1:01:49] was said to bless you and help you today
[1:01:51] amen Lord willing next week we'll
[1:01:53] probably still stream just Aaron on the
[1:01:56] side of caution
[1:01:57] probably stream I've talked to the hotel
[1:01:59] after that Lord willing we'll see try to
[1:02:03] find the mind of the Lord if everything
[1:02:05] seems right then and we'll probably go
[1:02:06] back to the Holiday Inn but we'll see
[1:02:08] whatever the Lord has for us and we'll
[1:02:11] we'll go down that road I don't want to
[1:02:13] knock down any doors but I want to walk
[1:02:15] through the door said he opens for us I
[1:02:17] want to force anything but I don't want
[1:02:20] to miss anything the Lord my half-horse
[1:02:22] - and on that light I don't think I ever
[1:02:26] mentioned to you that I can't remember
[1:02:28] now but just for a moment I did talk to
[1:02:31] the pastor
[1:02:32] voice of God fellowship on Prince Romero
[1:02:36] and their facility is too large for us
[1:02:39] they have two units not just one their
[1:02:44] rent is way beyond what we could afford
[1:02:46] so that not that and they weren't
[1:02:49] merging actually either that they've
[1:02:51] been having services together but not
[1:02:53] necessarily technically merging as the
[1:02:55] two churches into one but they haven't
[1:02:57] been using their facility because the
[1:02:59] COBE thing and everything so but it
[1:03:02] wouldn't work for us anyway under those
[1:03:03] circumstances so I just thought I'd let
[1:03:05] you know that but we do want to walk
[1:03:07] through the door that the Lord opens for
[1:03:09] us
[1:03:10] amen so appreciate each one of you being
[1:03:13] here today pray the Lord richly bless
[1:03:15] you
[1:03:15] we'll just dismiss some word prayer now
[1:03:17] to bow our heads
[1:03:19] Lord Jesus father we thank you again for
[1:03:22] speaking to us from your word Lord from
[1:03:25] taking this little lesson father that
[1:03:26] you put on my heart to hopefully help us
[1:03:29] God and to help us understand what it
[1:03:31] takes to reach the finalization of this
[1:03:34] of this life of this word of living for
[1:03:37] you and being your disciple Lord it's
[1:03:40] more than just saying we're a disciple
[1:03:42] when Jesus told those multitudes of
[1:03:44] people he chose 12 that was his
[1:03:46] hand-picked chosen 12 but when all this
[1:03:48] multitude was following he looked at him
[1:03:51] and said do you realize what you're
[1:03:53] doing do you understand what cost it may
[1:03:56] cost you to follow me it's not easy
[1:03:59] sometimes Lord but you're always there
[1:04:01] with us we thank you Father for blessing
[1:04:03] us thank you for speaking to us today
[1:04:05] help us to be ready lord help us to be

[1:04:16] and go lord I pray that you bless those
[1:04:18] from the hook-up today
[1:04:20] lest our congregation bless and move
[1:04:22] upon every request again I pray Lord
[1:04:24] that your hand of mercy would be on them
[1:04:26] and bless and strengthen them in a
[1:04:28] special way we thank you God for this
[1:04:31] country the purging and all that's going
[1:04:34] through Lord we know we're at the end
[1:04:35] times but thank you Lord to still be in
