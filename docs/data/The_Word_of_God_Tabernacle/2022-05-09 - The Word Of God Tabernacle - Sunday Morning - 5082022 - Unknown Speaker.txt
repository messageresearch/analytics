wonderful [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] jesus just wanted to talk to us for a little bit trust he hit your heart amen several out today as you can see thank you jesus it may be mother's day brother dennis attended texas wife leah as we prayed for last week is still struggling mightily and probably even more so today being mother's day so brother dennis she asked if he would stay home with her again today and so he's home with his wife so please remember very prayer the lord would just touch her and take away that anxiety that depression completely deliver her i believe when we agreeing with brother dennis that the lord's still dealing with our heart so uh to bring her amen to this truth so we know that there's a purpose behind and a reason for everything god doesn't just do things he does things for a reason and purpose so uh let's remember brother dennis uh sister lee of prayer also he asked he's having a scan i forget but it's his yearly scan you know the colon cancer that brother dennis had a c scan tomorrow tomorrow morning and not only of course as he's looking for this he scan to come come through negative but he said the last time he had the c scan he got sick after the test so he had asked us to pray for him and lift him up as well this morning uh the frauds are at home their angel got sick not feeling well friday he's still not feeling good today up last night with chills and fever and also please remember they stayed home uh with him today so please remember brother angel in prayer uh brother angel sent me a text also about his mother genevieve she had had a seizure last night uh you know she's been dealing with those uh for several years now and we're just trusting it to completely deliver her of that so uh please remember her in prayer if you would as well brother danny's still at home uh he said his allergies are still acting up and his it's affecting his eyes even in his sinuses so please remember brother danny in prayer as well sister julie sent me a text her and she said maggie hadn't been feeling well which is her niece and and seems to have that kristen and julie have contracted some whatever the sickness whatever is there so the three of them are not feeling well at home today so please remember them in prayer if you will as well the others i'm not sure i haven't heard from the pats or uh steroids but just trust in the lord's hands upon them amen and they'll be with us next week so anyone have an unspoken request on your heart do you have a spoken request um enoch just called me about two weeks ago anybody who may not know enoch is alex rael's son and he said that he the doctor told him he has cancer stomach cancer he has three more years to go to finish his sentence and he had h pillory which causes ulcers in the stomach and he was in medical in a different prison for that but i think so if it's not traded properly it causes cancer i don't know he needs i i am asking that god had given him he knows christianity knows the message and now i'm just praying that if god had given him the faith um change his mind whatever he has to do to be able to enter into that place of healing because at this point it looks like there's no other alternative because the the prison does not really treat cancer and and and i don't know that uh outside doctors can send anything in it's just a very locked up situation so his his only hope is prayer that god would just make a way he only eats his beans and rice and nothing and processed meat that's all there is available and he's just really suffering and those are the kind of things that he can't eat and that's all he has to eat amen so like i said um that was brother alex rael's son enoch we had him in school first couple years him and hosanna and he's in prison now and they found out he has cancer so please remember enoch if you would in prayer and anyone spoke anyone else have a request just a short group a small group this morning so feel a little more liberty if you have something on your heart to speak it if not let's just stand to our feet take these needs to the lord in prayer i mean you pray with us at home though several of us said they would be streaming today so michael would you pray for these things for us our heads my gracious heavenly father lord god we come to you father thanking you first of all for everything you've done lord jesus thank you for you see almighty god for taking care of us for providing for us for giving us places to live food lord jesus and for providing for each and every one of us lord jesus we ask that you would forgive us of all our sins anything we've done that would enter our prayers hinder our faith under our walk with you lord yes oh god and lord as we bring our needs to you lord to lay them at the throne knowing that you'll take care of them father god we ask that you would touch jesus who needs healing financially lord jesus health or god mentally physically emotionally lord jesus whatever it may be lord or yes for the enoch father who's been diagnosed with cancer father god and we know that you are greater than cancer yes yes our prophet spoke greatly about that father yes god lord brother dennis is he accused already go through this scan father god we're trusting him believing that the healing that you gave him years ago stands father firm on your word and that he will not be sick or ill or other effects from the skin yes brother brother danny father god these allergies that try to attack and people father god is just the devil father trying to trick our immune system something's wrong lord jesus and it's your nature your beauty your pollen that you're giving to the earth to thank you lord amen lord jesus we rebuke satan in the name of the lord jesus christ and we ask that you be with us in the remaining part of the service to remove any hindering spirit from this place we commit everything into your hands we ask everything in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask amen amen amen praise the lord you can be seated if you'd like amen i got one more song i wanted to sing before we go to the word today amen just a simple thought but lord give me for mother's day so does that be a blessing to you today but let's sing this one more song before we change the service over fill my cup [Music] i'm not sure if i can sing this song now i think i'm overflowing already amen praise the lord let's sing it though [Music] thirsting of my soul [Music] is [Music] four themes [Music] speaking [Music] is [Music] there are millions in this worldly things [Music] treasures that i find in jesus christ my lord [Music] of my soul [Music] feed me till i want no more [Music] things [Music] that won't pass away [Music] lord will come and save you if you need [Music] i lift it [Music] is [Music] is [Music] there are millions in this world who are crazy [Music] but no can match the wondrous treasure that i find in jesus christ my lord hallelujah [Music] [Applause] thirsting of my soul bread of heaven is [Music] [Applause] amen praise the lord jesus hallelujah thank you father well that just those who show that no matter how full you yet there's still more amen praise god amen so thankful too thank god you can never get too full saints never get too full of him praise the lord jesus amen i will change your service now but i just thought i'd ask if anyone has a testimony on your heart before i was a christian i had this vision of a circle in which god was at the top and i was at the bottom and uh his love was raining down on me and and i didn't know what to do with all this love and uh because i wasn't a christian i had didn't know anything so as i'm meditating and what i could do it and all of a sudden i see at nine o'clock i start to see the faces of people up here and god just directed me i was inspired to give god's love to them and when i did i saw i go back up to god and then he ran down more on me than he had at the first so now i knew what to do with it so i gave it to the people and they gave it to god and i was just so thrilled that i had some way to give it back to god and then they ran down more on me than he had the first two times and this cycle continued until i was so full like a pawn i my mortal body couldn't take any more and and i felt like i was going to die now looking back i made the wrong decision to stop the meditation i should have just gone in and died that's a better place to be amen i like that shed abroad in our hearts that we can give to others amen that's right i like that living your life brothers you're staring heaven in the face praise the lord jesus let's all stand to our feet is anybody else go ahead maybe you'll pray for me the last time i didn't tell you what was the matter but what you prayed you asked the lord not to be afraid and it shocked me but i said i am not going to fear for your friends amen that we have the holy ghost pastor yes thank you praise the lord amen so thankful god bless sister norma has so many times as he as he has all of us amen let's stand to our feet if we could we'll grab our bibles and then turn into the first kings chapter three as i said just something uh just an east uh mother's day message lord give me my heart you know we don't usually try to have something that was being along the themes of mother's day and gets to the point where you've said a lot of things you can say about mother's day and without just continuing to repeat yourself but i figure if the lord keeps the mother's day to me is so special that it warrants it to me i don't necessarily preach a father's day message we're just thankful to our heavenly father but mother's day is it's a little bit different and i always like to even though every day should be a mother's day as we know that but we know it rarely is with anybody i i hate to admit but i never spent every day of my life treating my mother like it was a mother today i now wished i had now that she's gone or not here in the flesh with us anymore but uh but to me it's it's always been a very special time today's a very special time uh i miss her very much but uh but this to me warrants that so uh i wasn't exactly sure what the lord wanted me to bring here but uh this story came to my heart and you all know it very well and it's the love of a mother i want to speak on though the subject today is something real uh because to me there's nothing more real than a mother's love to me there just isn't just when god separated that feminist part out of adam and put it in eve or the woman at the time she wasn't even at the time but that feminist spirit that it just like that that that boost of love was put in her heart and that love that's for her children just uh is to me the most special it's just the most special thing that there is um you know you see sporting events and you used to be anyway uh if i saw a sporting event and they'd come and interview somebody afterwards and this young man he says i want to say i love my mom or get on camera and say hi mom you rarely ever hear them say i love my dad or hi dad there's always high mom but there's a reason for that so amen first kings chapter 3 amen before we read let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer lord jesus father we are again so very thankful what you've done for us given to us for the blessings that you shine abroad in our heart every day thank you for this word lord thank you for our mothers lord there may be some in our congregation who may not have had the best mother but lord they're our mothers nevertheless and we're thankful god if nothing more than just bringing us in the world and giving us the opportunity to live our lives here and to serve you and to live for you god because even if they came from someone who may not have been a great mother lord you became our mother our father our sister our brother our everything lord and we love you and we thank you for that we thank you lord for being with us this morning lord and just in such a special way feeling your presence so near so precious oh god lord it just reminds us again of of how close you really are to us every day and just maybe a little trigger of something to to manifest that spirit and bring that spirit so real to us it just engulfs us so god makes us feel warm all over makes us feel that presence that you're so mindful of us we thank you for it lord we thank you lord for the truth of your word for the message we thank you for good godly mothers raise their children in the nurture and admonition of god and as we have this day that we celebrate that mother's day we know you are that to us as well lord not just our heavenly father you are everything lord we thank you father for these that have come lord those who may still be streaming here and lord we're thankful most of all for you and for your presence we commit the remaining part of the service to your hands trust you to meet with us and speak through these lips the words you'd have us to hear today that it would honor and glorify and magnify your holy name jesus in your precious name the lord jesus christ we pray amen again a very familiar story that we know of it's the most wise man that we consider uh that's ever lived so first kings chapter three we begin with verse six uh chapter three begin with verse 16. then came there two women that were harlots unto the king and stood before him the one woman said o my lord i and this woman dwell in one house and i was delivered of a child with her in the house it came to pass the third day after i was delivered that this woman was delivered also we were together there was no stranger with us in the house save me save we two in the house this woman's child died in the night because she overlaid it she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while thine handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom when i rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it was dead but when i had considered it in the morning behold it was not my son which i did bear the other woman said nay but the living son is my the living is my son the dead is thy son and this said no but the dead is thy son the living is my son thus they spake before the king then said the king the one saith this is my son that liveth and thy son is dead the other said nay but thy son is dead and my son is the living the king said bring me a sword they brought a sword before the king the king said divide the living child in two give the one half to one the other half to the other then spake the woman whose living child was unto the king for her bowels yearned upon her upon her son and she said o my lord give her the living child and in no wise slay it but the other said let it be neither mine nor thine but divided then the king answered and said give her the living child and in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that his wisdom was of god was in him to do judgment you can be seated if you like now again as i said before we all know this story quite well uh one of the most famous stories actually the world knows this story quite well i've probably heard this story mentioned among worldly people even as much as maybe christians but it's a very a wise choice a very wise way to discern but we know that that wisdom come from god but again the thing that obviously strikes us here and of course this being mother's day is that this mother's heart for her child the differentiation that you can see from a true godly mother and someone who isn't really a mother or someone who has allowed that spirit of motherhood to be tamped down by whatever means that there are in the world but there is something always in the heart of that woman that's going to be a mother you know brother branham tells us that even if a woman today refuses to have a child now there's some women that that cannot have children medically for some reason but if they simply refuse to have a child they'll take to themselves a dog or a cat to mother it because they it's instinct in them to want to be a mother to mother something and that that thing that we recognize that that is that special bond that uh that that god gives to a mother that allowed in this woman's heart to want to lose her son and him stay alive rather than her son to die and what a great story because obviously the woman whose child it was not could care less about that child her child was already dead she didn't care whether solomon chopped that other child in half or not because it wasn't hers but the woman whose child it was was more willing to allow that child to go and maybe even never see it again than to allow that child to be killed now that being of a true mother could be spoken of in a spiritual sense as well because a true godly mother wants her child to serve god wants her child to be born again wants your child to be saved wants your child to be spending eternity together with them on the other side that's true heart of a mother that mother would rather cause that child and see that it kind of almost gets to the spare the rods for the child type situation but that mother is going to do what it takes for that child for that child to become obedient so that that child is raised in the right way so that they recognize and acknowledge god when they get older because as much as the the a true mother wants her child to stay alive physically that true godly mother wants her child to be alive spiritually and that prayer for that mother or from that mother that prayer to that uh to god for that child is to me prevails before god as much as any prayer that there is it exists but the thing about it that that i want to speak on today just again for a few minutes but how the lord leads that i want to talk about that that mother's love and the reality of that love there's a lot of things in the world today and and as we sing this song there's there are so many people that i believe in the world today uh that that just they just really want something that's real now you know there's a there's a soul inside everybody every human that's ever born has a soul worth 10 million worlds and that soul cries for the living god now in everybody you say oh it is just for the predestination no i believe every soul that is born because life is precious to god life is a precious thing and every name every person that's born is written in a book of life every day because that life is precious and and in that soul because that soul would be the eternal part of that person that soul is the thing that cries out to god now how many times and through how many people does that that yearning become camped down by the things of the world now see that that becomes the issue in so many people's lives now it's a lot of times not understood it's not acknowledged but the fact of the matter is that that yearning that's in everybody is is is there it's inherent but in so many people they allow that desire to get driven down by everything else all the things in the world all the cares of life so many people try to mask it with righteous living with with drugs with alcohol with substitutes things that they try to to bring into their lives to quench that thirst of god that desire is still there even if a mother and and we've seen and heard so many stories unfortunately of mothers that have taken their children and done unspeakable things to them uh throwing them in garbage cans or dumped them in rivers or all kinds of horrible things but i will testify that i believe because it's god that still in that woman there's that desire to be mother because she's born that way it's inherent from god to be that way but something in life some conditions some adversity something has tamped down that desire has tamped down that that reality of what's in there and it's perverted it just like the the perversion of the taste that's supposed to be for god that people have they turn to so many other things it's become perverted it's become perverted so many times in women's hearts even though that yearning is there becomes perverted i don't think it's a i don't think it's an accident uh you may differ with me and maybe i'm wrong but i don't think it's an accident that this leak came out of the supreme court about them uh tearing down roe versus weight and the legalization national legalization of abortion on the week of mother's day i honestly don't think that's a coincidence now did man orchestrate that no i don't think man orchestrated that i think that's a sign to us to recognize what is real and what isn't real what is god doing amen there's been 63 million babies murdered in this country before they ever had a chance to have life 63 million can you imagine and i don't think it's a coincidence that this is going on now on this week of mother's day this week that we celebrate mother's day because this country has thrown itself into a a a a tizzy over this leaked document that's not even official yet don't even know what's going to happen i personally celebrate it it won't legalize it it'll it would do away with the national legalization of abortion and just give it back to the states to the people's hands so this is not going to get rid of abortion but it's a step in the right direction does it tell us maybe we have another year or two that we didn't realize i don't know that's up to god that's his choice but i don't think it's an accident that it happened in the week of mother's day 63 million human beings 63 million babies murdered before they ever even had a chance to be a human to have life and that's sad it gets to be today that a certain group of people they almost it seems like or maybe they do maybe it's not just almost maybe they do value a dog's life more than they do a human's life yeah yes more it seems like certain people advocate more for for adopting a dog than they will have a child that someone could could adopt yeah and that's sad when did it get to be to where the animal took the president over a human in life do you know what is illegal to kill a a sea turtle in its shell right before it has a chance to come to life it is actually illegal to kill to take that egg to use that egg or to kill it or you know it's actually illegal to do that but you can kill an unborn child human and there's others that that's just one that i just remembered i don't even have that in my notes that just came to my mind it is actually illegal to kill an unborn i think it's a sea turtle or something it is illegal to kill that and but yet you can you can you can go down the street and kill a human it's even been talked about infanticide i've heard a governor of a state that said that lady can have that child and then and then the the woman and the doctor could decide what to do with the child from there in other words they could kill it if they wanted to well that's just that's just outright murder so let's get this spirit uh we know we're living in satan's evening we know these these things come into people's lives and they they move into people's spirits and they darken a person's soul even darker than they were they become so hard they become so calloused and crusted that it just it it it just defies humanity if that person comes like an animal brother of adam said without the holy ghost a man is just a beast even if it has a soul it's just it's nature how it acts is just like a beast and so this spirit that tamps down that that god-given desire that god-given nature that's in there that that god-given uh respect for life that that we as a christian nation have inherent in us as human beings everybody struggles for life even at the end of life when a person's reaching their end of life i remember watching our son take his last breath that little body it didn't know any better it it didn't know what it meant to him intellectually to breathe or to to to live another day or he didn't have a slightest idea he was a day and a half old but that little body was laying there struggling pulling sucking every bit of air that it could possibly get in its body because that body was struggling for life it was fighting and struggling and it was doing everything in its little power to try to stay alive wasn't the will of god for it to stay alive but you could watch it and see as it drew its breath oh friend i just i i cried like never before i i wasn't even i don't even i don't even say i was crying water was just pouring out of my eyes you know i i i've cried a lot in my life but it wasn't like crying it's just like water was pouring out of my eyes and i couldn't stop it as i watched that little form that little body that little human try to stay alive and you don't think that it's that way even at conception even at the time when that little baby comes to to fruition and and is conceived it's that way in that woman's in that woman's body and people have such some people have such disregard for that but that spirit that that presses that that's in there that that god-given inherent in there to to want to have that life and have that life come forward and to have just just have a respect for that life and thank god that there is still a way that life can be brought forward and that god would honor that amen and god does honor him god honors the godly mothers that have that and in their soul in that spirit of of that motherhood to want a mother something i've heard people say and we've said it sometimes we were empty nesters and you know and the kids have gone off out of the house and things like that and i used to take people around and they tell me how their empty nesters or their kids were off in some different state or they had to follow a job or something like that and but you know you could always tell that no matter how far away or no matter how old or how big that child gets it'll always that mother it'll that mother will always that'll be her baby always it doesn't matter what changes it doesn't matter who they are where they go you can see them once a year it'll that will always be mama's baby always because that doesn't change no matter how old they get or how big they get but this this spirit of being a of reality something that that shows that that there is something that is that is really real something that is in that inherent human that soul that desire for mother that desire for god that thirst for life that is there that desire that's there with people so many times it gets camped down i i can't believe that people even who have been misguided or have had that camp down or broke the law or killed somebody or done something wrong that that isn't all that that isn't still there how do we know that person laid there on their prison bed at night and that come to their heart i believe it does the coldest heart out there because it's what god put in them it's how they were born there's something in there that wants to thirst for god and then the things happen and it gets pushed out again but oh if there's just some way somehow that person could get to that reality that that reality that is god the world is doing everything but the world is becoming more and more fake and put on all the time it's becoming more uh uh superficial it's becoming more oh just just think about all the things that try to have people escape from the reality of what life is and and life itself and god all the fake all the put on hollywood think about how everything comes out of hollywood everything about it is fake superheroes comics comic books i think comic books those are far from what reality is comic book superheroes science fiction i've never seen that time i've never been a science fiction person myself even when star wars came out in the 70s and everybody went crazy i'm like why are you that's the stupidest thing i've ever seen who would want to even watch that people looking all moral gnarled up and living on a planet and flying it it didn't make any sense to me still doesn't but science fiction now it's got to work probably the majority of what even comes out of hollywood is science fiction now or comedy or a cartoon or a superhero or something man that can shoot webs on a building and fly around or or stop a bullet with their hand i don't even know if they do it the superhero stuff and and the the fake the sci-fi reality tv there's not a reality thing about any of that stuff right every bit of it's all put on and fake there's nothing real about that never seen anything of reality and all that there's nothing real about that social media is just as guilty social media and all the the the hype and the put on and the fake the tick tock oh my goodness people are dying trying to do stuff that others are doing on this tick tock giving their lives and and acting just just acting crazy and people are making some people are making a lot of money off this stuff and all of it's a bunch of put on oh it's a bunch of fake there's nothing to it there's no reality to it disney is not the happiest place on earth i'm sorry it is to me this is amazing yes that will probably happen with my family amen with you all but this is not it amen some nice rides characters all that said it's all put on it's all fantasy that's why that's why people they say it's the happiest place because people want to get away from their real lives and get into something that's fake and put on costumes and all that all those things like that it's all fake but i i i never would have known or thought back you know 20 30 years ago that the science fiction and the superhero the comics and all that stuff would have become such a big thing like it is today it's it's like they can't think of anything of reality to try to put out anymore so let's just come up with the most hideous gruesome nasty ugliest most unbelievable thing that you can and just just throw it out in front of people and it's warping the young people's minds yes so that reality that they're born with immediately gets camped down because this is all pressed down on them it comes to their body their spirit and it it it takes toll that that soul that thirst that's in there so then it perverts that thirst so then he wants something else besides what the thirst is for and that's god you remember brother brown i'm talking about alley-oop brother green used to tell us that brother what brother brandon what brother branham said about alley-oop this cartoon character alley-oop that was supposed to be a i think as a prehistoric something some prehistoric uh caveman or whatever i guess they say it was alley-oop anybody ever seen the commercial of the the cartoon or that brother green gave him out i looked him up it was it wasn't my thing i never was much of a cartoon person this alley-oop brother branham said that that was the closest to satan that he had seen you know this he said this is the closest to jesus that you that god had showed him there in the broomstage field he said that ali was the closest thing he'd seen the devil and and people's kids reading that stuff all the time of this fake science fiction put on made up stuff amen but i do believe that there's still people i i believe everybody i believe everybody really truly if you broke it down and got rid of all the crusty mess on top everybody really desires to have something that's really a life home a marriage family people want things that are real if that other stuff were to all go away get rid of all the other uh things that pervert when you get right back right down to it that's exactly what humanity devolves uh really desires more than anything you think about you think about the people of ukraine for a minute they don't care what disney's new character gay character is they don't care what new reality show is on they don't right now they could care less what cartoon or sci-fi movie is coming out next or superhero they couldn't care less about superman or batman or whatever they couldn't care less because their lives have devolved down to one thing that's survival that's living having something that's real close reality to those folks right now is a bomb dropping on their heads and their kids laying dead in the street that's reality to them they want something that's real and that's exactly what god gives to us to me that's exactly what a mother provides a true godly mother now provides is that reality a true reality you know listen this brother branham said uh they said this in several places but in 1954 i picked this one out he said the backbone of any nation is womanhood now you think about that for a minute because remember we've told this i think maybe this was the last mother's day i can't remember but the sacredness uh i know brother branham was was hard on the woman but he was hard on ungodly women right he was hard on jezebels wasn't hard on the godly sister but womanhood in general not godly women but ungodly women yeah he was hard on them but he understood and believed i believe the sacredness that god gave that woman god entrusted the female with the ability to reproduce to bring forth life into the world i can't do that i have life in me i have seen in me but i can't bring that forth bring it into life without the woman without the mother god allowed you and entrusted you sisters with that responsibility women with that responsibility and to me that's a very sacred responsibility and brother adam says then the backbone of any nation is womanhood backbone of any nation couldn't be standing here before you today if i didn't have a backbone you could be sat in there if you didn't have a backbone so what is a nation without a backbone womanhood broken he said when it comes to the morals and you and when you break motherhood you've broken your nation so friend if we didn't already know it i officially declare we are living in a nation that is broken now he said nation i believe we're living in a world that is broken and we know what's next but that doesn't change the reality in our hearts you know brother dan was here last week talking about um you know the things that's going on in the country and and uh i think it was a time magazine or something you mentioned a picture of the woman of the year or something like that and and yeah all those things happen and and yeah it hurts our heart because it's hard to see i love this country i love its people i hate to see what's happening and we know it's going to but that doesn't change how i feel about it right it doesn't change how i feel about it i know that the majority of people that are around us today are going to go to hell because the scripture says so but that doesn't change how i feel about them that doesn't change my desire to want them to not go to hell my desire is for them to see this truth and to receive this truth and to go and spend eternity with me even if they're on the outside of the city at least they can be granted life yeah yes that's my heart i believe that's all of our desires but when motherhood is broken you've broken the backbone of a nation you've broken that nation since 1974 i think it was 70-something roe versus weight 63 million babies and how could we think that motherhood is not broken that situation and looking at the children that are being raised today it's hard it's a chore i'm looking at mothers looking at me it's hard you all know it's hard i say it as a father and i and that's from a father's point of view look being a mother is a much much more difficult than being a father just is first of all god gave you the responsibility of being the mother to that child that's the first thing man is responsible but it is harder for the sisters for the women to raise those children than the nurtured admonition of god and god sees that that's why god honors that that's one reason i like having this mother's day even if it's just taking a few minutes to have a scripture a celebration of an acknowledgement of that just like this woman here true mother a true mother wants to see her baby live that's what a true mother does there's a special connection i believe there's a there's a special spiritual connection now there's obviously the physical connection but there's that spiritual connection i believe between the mother and his child and her child it's something that transcends just the flesh and just the uh just the humanity of it there's a spiritual bond that develops there between that child and that mother that again is something that's unlike anything else unlike anything else look at this you all know this story i'm going to read a couple of stories to you on that reality but this one is um my new ministry brother brown said 1959 both of them are a little lengthy brother brandon said i that same god hallelujah that jehovah jireh he's just as much jehovah jirei today as he was on the mount with abraham he can still produce an animal to his glory three squirrels was not a vision i shot them blood came out of them i dressed them ate them they weren't visions they were squirrels i said that same jehovah jireh trying to get his promise over to me and the thickness and dullness of my mind he could speak my need into existence the same as he could speak abraham's need into existence i had no more than said that till sister had he's sitting there crying right now he said sitting there hadn't said a word and she said that's nothing but the truth that pleased the lord please the lord so much god told brother brandon speak to her and tell her that he'll she'll get whatever she wants she said that's nothing but the truth one thing about sister hattie that a lot of people don't know well you would if you read the message enough but there's one thing about sister hattie that a lot of people didn't know hattie was her right was her middle name people have wrote songs about how right she was and how right this was in that because of her name and trying to bring the coalition of the right with what she said the right word and that's okay there's nothing wrong with that but actually her name at that time was not right her name was actually moser she was a widow her actual her actual legal name at that time was hattie mosher it wasn't actually hattie wright brother bantam does tell that he calls her hattie right more than any because she was in the right family but her married name when she was a widow was hattie moser actually her legal name at the time this happened was was different but anyway that's a whole nother segue she said that's nothing but the truth she said the right thing she said just like banks sat down there i heard a voice as i as it swept from my ears like up into the woods miss right sitting back there with a little girl was trying to intercept with edith i couldn't hear miss right that super anointing swept over me still said tell hattie that she's found grace in the sight of god who would have thought said tell her to ask whatever she will then you speak it by this gift into existence whatever she's asketh speak it into existence i look to sister hattie the first time it was ever performed on a human being i said sister hattie ask what you will god is going to give it to you what do you think of that congregation says amen does it get into you seven times he had confirmed it by an animal seven is god's complete number here is the first time on a human being and he uh he did he chose some great he did not choose some great aristocrat or a great noted minister a poor little widow woman that could hardly write her name god knows what he's doing said ask what you will had he uh and had he said to me brother banner what do you mean i said ask anything your heart's desires and it shall be produced right here and that you know that the lord god of heaven answers his scriptures are true my the my first time the new gift my first anointing i could hardly hear her she looked around we have been talking about her little crippled sister there i said oh no doubt in my heart within a few minutes little edith will be jumping for the glory of god hattie looked around all around she said brother bill my greatest desire is for the salvation of my two boys amen now that's not a mother you think about that this morning what else could sister had he have asked for maybe her car was a clunker breaking down maybe her house roof was craving in maybe she uh could ask for uh the healing of her sister or family for herself she could ask for a million dollars to roll through the door and a million dollars would roll through the door she could ask for anything god told brother branham tell her she can have whatever she wants whatever she says whatever she asks for you speak it and it will come to pass and that mother's heart could only think of one thing that was the salvation of her two boys now that's the heart of a mother despite everything else despite all the other things she could have asked for amen she asked for the right thing and god knew it god knew what she was going to ask for god knew that she was going to ask for the salvation of her voice god has everything under control like that franny knows exactly she said i want the salvation and she said they had gotten into that ruffian teenage years you know where the teenagers start acting like their know-it-alls and don't need their parents anymore and don't want their mom hanging around and stuff and they were getting rough in she said she said i want the salvation of my two boys and he says i give them to you in the name of the lord jesus christ she said those two boys fell on their knees before god weeping before the lord he said the power of god came so real those boys started shaking he said the buildings started shaking but those boys started shaking so they fell on their faces before god weeping and crying before the lord i don't care i don't care people that are anti-message will say all those boys did this they went out and see them blah blah blah whatever i don't care where those boys ever ended up i don't care what those boys ever did in life i don't care where they ever went said perform i don't care if they were in jail their whole lives i don't care what they did those boys are going in heaven that's right those boys are safe period amen but i think of it even in a more real sense because yes that's wonderful to hear about there with brother branham and hattie but to me it's more real than that to me that's a promise to me that's right that i have that no matter what happens no matter where my children or where they may have done or when or whatever that doesn't matter they're gods and they're going to be there period there's no question they are saved that's right there's no discussion she got it there and it's a great story that we tell and the heart of a mother and something that was real friend but i'm telling you what's real to me what should be real to you it doesn't matter where they went it doesn't matter what they did those boys are saved why because they belong to her my children are saying why because they belong to me they belong to my wife amen if there's anything good about our children it's because of her not me god of course but it's the mother anything even actually good about me today is my mother my dad i love my dad he was a wonderful father put my feet on the path of truth this message but it's my mother's reason i'm standing here amen i believe that in my mother's prayers it's just one of those things amen the prayers of the father is powerful saints but there's nothing like the prayer beloved that prevails before god and i hold on to this promise for me as much as had he would there for her and people say all those boys weren't saved to see what people look at they look out with their eyes they look at with these things sitting in their skulls instead of looking at what the promise of the word says what comes from your heart of what comes from this word what god says is more powerful than anything else isaiah said a virgin is going to conceive it took almost 800 years but what god said came to pass it didn't matter how many women came through it didn't matter how many people they thought might have been didn't matter how many uh situations they considered or thought of it was going to come in god's way in god's time with the right person it's god's choice we're still here today i don't understand why we're still here but we are and i'm thankful we are because it's another day to live for god it's another day to try to do something for the lord jesus if we don't have it tomorrow then praise the lord we'll do all we can for him today you know brother branham said i was i was going to mention this last week and i thought would brother dad hear that i wouldn't um get into preaching but you know brother branham said i heard him on a tape the other day he said that uh and i didn't know this but scripturally but when jesus when brother branham talked about los angeles california going underneath the sea sliding into the ocean he said he came back and the lord showed him where that was in the scripture where jesus cursed capernaum in the same way he says you exalted in heaven will be brought down to hell but he said it was almost a hundred years now this is the part i didn't know it was almost a hundred years before capernaum ever slid into the sea jesus was long gone by then almost a hundred years i thought mine that was 1965 when brother brown said that god spoke to brother branham what are w where are we at today i don't know 65 is it going to be the same thing who knows but people fret and worry and say oh it's still has it doesn't matter it's been spoken it's going to happen amen it's going to happen 100 years that seems like a long time to us i don't i don't even personally know anybody that i know personally that's lived 100 years i don't think anybody my family has lived 100 years that's a long time so you think about 100 years amen people are just looking for something that's real to me i really believe people are just looking for something that's real and it's up to us to produce that reality before them let's look at another one real quick and we'll close exodus chapter 2 verse 1. there went a man out of the house of levi took the wife a daughter of levi and the woman conceived and bear a son and when she saw him that was a goodly child she hit him three months because it had been a decree of course to kill all the babies and when she could no longer hide him she took him uh took for him an ark of full rushes dubbed it slammed it with pitch put the child there in and she laid in the flags of the riverbank and his sister stood afar off to wit what would be done to him daughter pharaoh came down to wash herself to the river her maids walked along the river's side and when she saw the ark among the flags she sent her mate to fetch it when she had opened it she saw the child and behold the babe wept she had compassion on him and said this is one of the hebrews children even though she knew what the pharaohs decree was she kept the child then said his sister to pharaoh's daughter shall i go and call thee a nurse of the hebrew women that she may nurse the child for thee pharaoh's daughter said to her go the maid went and called the child's mother not knowing that that was his sister pharaoh's daughter's uh go made call a child's mother and pharaoh's daughter said unto her take the child away and nurse it for me and i will give you thy wages and the woman took the child and nursed it and the child grew she brought him into pharaoh's daughter and he became her son called his name moses and she said because i drew him out of the water a man a woman's love a mother's love again willing to put her son trusting god having faith enough to trust god to put that child in that basket with the crocodiles everything else in the nile could have drowned it could have flipped over anything could have happened to that child but put him in the hands of god rather than in the hands of pharaoh pharaoh was willing to kill him but god was going to save us and then god ironically took that child and put him right in pharaoh's house became second in command the most powerful man in the world in the world and he was the one that was supposed to be the deliverer because of a mother's heart now that mother's heart that it is his sister when told pharaoh's daughter uh uh can i find somebody to nurse him for you oh yes i'll pay her went got her mom moses's mother and said here and she got to nurse her own child phrase she got to take care of and rear her own child and got paid to do it pharaoh's daughter actually paid moses mother to take care of her own child because of her faith because of her faith because of that heart of a mother amen you remember i closed with this i printed it but i'm not going to read it it's a little leaky i said i had a couple but i do this almost every mother's day but the one thing that meant that uh that i think of that i see here with humanity getting to the place that it's getting women and the things that they're doing and i see women out there screaming and yelling because they don't they afraid they won't have the ability to kill an unborn child it makes you wonder what would happen if that person if that woman if that potential mother were to have a child or to be a mother or to see something that was real that hunting trip i talked about so many times that brother branham went on his friend lizard eyed bird and lizard i had that whistle that he blew and caused that mother deer to stand up because her heart was bleeding for her baby or for a baby i mean we don't even know for sure because they make these distinctive sounds these these fawns these babies it brother adam said her baby but i don't even know that it was really clear that she heard her baby because it was just bert's whistle but it was a baby and in her heart being a mother a baby was in distress and she was going to risk her life to save him she stood up in that in that field just as plain as she could be lizard.bert put that gun right down on her and brother random said the deer saw the hunter and i tell you friend if that deer gets a smell a whiff a look or anything of anything out of the ordinary her flag is up and she's gone yeah but she stepped more out in the clearing to see what was going on to see that baby that was that was in trouble recognizing it might not have been very much longer for her and all the testimonies all the witnessing all that brother branham did to try to lead birth to christ he still was stoned cold-hearted as he always was but when that man saw that deer stand up and he saw her heart getting ready to give her life for her baby done something to him brother branham says he saw something real not that what brother branham gave him wasn't real but for bert that's what it took for god to show him that mother that godly in a dear mother it makes me wonder if she'll risk her life for a baby that might not have even been hers or it wasn't because it's just a whistle what does that say about human women today who are willing to just in any way just kill it kill the children just kill them all it just shows you how ungodly and perverted we've gotten as a nation where life is so undervalued life is so undervalued it's sad to think about that that's that's the position that a lot of people are in today and fighting they're spending their time out their sacrificing their meals and their sleep just so they can go stand in front of a building and yell and scream about their ability to kill an unborn child talk about darkness talk about stone cold hearted friend has gotten to that place but i thank god they're still godly mothers they're still godly mothers raise their children in the nursery nurture and admonition of god they're still godly mothers that have faith that trust god whatever they have need for them for their families they still believe and trust god the sanctity of life is still precious to them it means something the backbone of a nation i believe it's the same thing in even in a church in that backbone that family the family that satan has so successfully broken up in a world of fake and a world to put on in a world of comics sci-fi and everything else there's a reality i believe that reality is what we're all looking for we believe we have the world's looking for it the whole world amen we can be thirsty for something that god can feel and we'll be quenched we'll always want more but will be quenched no matter how much alcohol this world drinks they'll always want more no matter how much drugs they consume they're only going to want more no matter how many cigarettes or e-cigarettes or anything else they puff on it's only going to make them want more of them because it does not satisfy it does not satisfy praise the lord but thank god god has given us something that is real you can't get you can't get warm by a painted fire you can't make a substitute of something god put in you with something else other than him amen but i thank god he'd give us these examples that we can look to of a godly mother of what a mother's heart really is what it really means amen yes as a child you're unhappy sometimes because a mother's love is as corrective as it is ooey gooey mushy huggy lovey kissy sometimes it's just as corrective and that's just as much the love of god as the other amen praise the lord we'll stand today if we could as the song sang says just like the woman at the well she was seeking that because she had tried she'd gone from man to man to man she was looking for something that was real she was looking for something that would stabilize her something that would feel or something that would help her be satisfied in life we have that amen we have that praise the lord praise the lord jesus if anything we can do friends just try to help other people see that amen well i can't find it in here we'll just try it i wanted i just wanted to sing that again we'll just put it back up here if we can here we go amen fill my cup lord praise the lord jesus feel it lord fill it with something that's real something that's stabilizing [Music] feel my lord is [Music] fill it up and [Music] i was seeking for things that could not satisfy but [Music] shall run dry just [Music] this thirsting of my soul

dorothy's prayer sister matisse about 30 years ago 20 years 25 years ago um a prophet wrote it out for me for what was going on in my life and he ended it with a promise he said that when you are
