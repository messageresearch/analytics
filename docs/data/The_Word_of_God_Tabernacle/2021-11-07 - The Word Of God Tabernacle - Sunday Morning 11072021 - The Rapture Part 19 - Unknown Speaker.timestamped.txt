[0:38] the day after joel's birthday i think it
[0:41] was
[0:42] and she said if you want to see your
[0:43] mother alive you better get here now
[0:46] so that's when i changed my plans from
[0:48] tuesday to the
[0:50] wednesday i believe it was their
[0:51] thursday and i got there that afternoon
[0:54] my mom passed that next morning but i
[0:57] was so thankful
[0:59] although my mom knew exactly how i felt
[1:01] i knew exactly how she felt but it just
[1:04] did a lot for me
[1:05] personally to be able to
[1:08] tell my mom exactly to pour my heart out
[1:11] to to to say my last say uh to my mom
[1:14] before she went across she couldn't
[1:16] respond
[1:17] but the little tear that came out of the
[1:19] corner of her eyes said it all to me so
[1:21] uh that that meant a lot to me so i i
[1:26] just
[1:26] personally selfishly would like brother
[1:28] roger to get there before his dad
[1:30] crosses over but whatever the lord's
[1:32] will would be amen so just remember that
[1:35] family and them in prayer if you would
[1:36] and of course uh brother roger's mother

[1:45] woke up today not feeling as well as he
[1:47] did
[1:48] um and was coughing during the night but
[1:50] she let him cough while she slept
[1:53] because she really needed to sleep she
[1:54] said uh but she said his fever broke
[1:57] three days ago
[1:59] so as you know he did test positive
[2:03] when your fever's broke then that's it
[2:05] you're over it but i've heard now the
[2:08] symptoms will leaks
[2:10] especially the cough

[2:22] the cough late
[2:25] after a month or more after so
[2:27] uh but anyway his fever has broke he's
[2:30] been fever-free for three days so she's

[15:15] at the dealership and they did all the
[15:17] steps
[15:18] and then it was
[15:19] approved
[15:21] well there was like a lockdown in their
[15:23] computer system so that
[15:27] it was

[16:20] and apparently the person who took it
[16:24] god convicted their heart
[16:26] and when my back was turned they
[16:27] returned it it was the only time that

[16:42] making a way for friendship too because
[16:44] i i wanted to um testify to this person

[16:50] someone when they feel like they've got
[16:52] something between you and them
[16:54] where they've taken my stuff so god
[16:57] returned it i almost flipped over it

[24:25] once again

[24:37] accomplished today lord and each one
[24:39] that has come for whatever purpose you
[24:41] drew every one of us here today god and
[24:43] we know that your word cannot return
[24:45] void so we're believing that you're
[24:47] going to accomplish and establish each
[24:50] of us what the purpose of that is today
[24:52] i believe it's to draw strength is to
[24:54] draw powers to draw faith it's to draw
[24:57] comfort lord because paul even said at
[25:00] the end of this that we should comfort
[25:02] one another with these words yes lord
[25:04] it's something i believe that we're
[25:06] facing
[25:07] lord in this hour i believe we're facing
[25:09] coming up it's very imminent lord
[25:12] even 55 60 years ago lord the prophet of
[25:15] god was telling us how close it was even
[25:18] paul back in the day was telling us how
[25:21] close it is how close how much more
[25:23] close is it now lord to your coming we
[25:26] know we won't know the day or the hour
[25:28] that's reserved just for you but i
[25:30] believe that you've whispered enough
[25:32] little sweet nothings into your bride's
[25:33] ear that we have an understanding of the
[25:36] season and we know the time that we live
[25:38] lord and is the time of the coming of
[25:40] the lord we thank you lord for the
[25:43] truths of your word father the the
[25:46] doctrine the revelation of this word
[25:48] that helps encourage us and continue us
[25:51] to press this battle lord to give us
[25:54] that truth lord and where it lies and
[25:57] where it is in our lives and and what we
[25:59] should be looking to and expect for this
[26:01] last day
[26:02] we thank you lord for it we thank you

[26:13] show us where we need to be in you where
[26:14] we need to be living where our lives are
[26:16] where we should be

[26:20] here have a desire lord to be pleasing
[26:22] to you say god may you just grant it
[26:25] lord we thank you for those that have
[26:27] come we pray that you bless those who

[26:33] of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
[26:36] amen first thessalonians chapter 4 verse
[26:38] 13
[26:40] but i will not have you to be ignorant
[26:42] brother concerning them which are asleep
[26:44] that is sorrow not even as others which
[26:46] have no hope
[26:47] for if we believe that jesus died and
[26:49] rose again even so them also which sleep
[26:52] in jesus will god bring with him
[26:54] for this we say unto you by the word of
[26:56] the lord that we which are alive and
[26:58] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[27:00] not prevent them which are asleep for
[27:02] the lord himself shall descend from
[27:04] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[27:06] the archangel with the trump of god and
[27:08] the dead in christ shall rise first
[27:11] then we which are alive and remain shall
[27:13] be caught up together with them in the
[27:15] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[27:17] so shall we ever be with the lord
[27:19] wherefore comfort one another with these
[27:21] words
[27:22] you could be seated
[27:24] amen i don't know about you i hope
[27:27] that uh i just
[27:29] when i started doing that i just felt to
[27:31] read that scripture before every segment
[27:34] of this but uh every time i read this
[27:37] you think
[27:39] you know you think something when you in
[27:40] the natural if you do something over and
[27:42] over again it just becomes common to you
[27:45] it becomes uh something that's just like
[27:48] uh
[27:48] dull and and it just doesn't have the
[27:51] effect as it did but i tell you friend
[27:53] every time i read this it becomes more
[27:55] and more precious to me
[27:57] every time i read it i go through and i
[27:59] stand here and i read it if i read it in
[28:01] my study or something i every time i
[28:03] read this it becomes more more precious
[28:06] to me more more real more powerful
[28:09] it just just does something to my soul
[28:12] every time i read it if this does
[28:14] something to my soul you know you might
[28:16] get sick of uh of seeing me
[28:20] you might get sick of seeing one another
[28:21] you might get sick of the car you drive
[28:23] you might get sick of the meal you eat
[28:25] all the time you might get sick of uh of
[28:28] the things going over and over and over
[28:30] and uh one of the worst sayings i hate
[28:33] it
[28:34] i'll just say that i hate it
[28:36] god said he hated things so he said he
[28:39] hated nicolas
[28:42] i hated to say
[28:44] and god bless my wife because she said a
[28:46] bunch
[28:47] that is the same old same old i hate
[28:49] that
[28:50] i just but but in the world that's a lot
[28:53] of times that's where it comes to it's
[28:55] it's just the same old same old over and
[28:57] over again it just becomes commonplace
[28:59] and boring you know but the word of god
[29:01] just does not not to a child of god it
[29:03] does when the word of god and it speaks
[29:05] to you and that spirit resonates in your
[29:07] heart friends it becomes more and more
[29:09] precious every time you read it and i'm
[29:11] sorry i i don't mean to go on about it
[29:13] but as i was reading and i just got so
[29:16] inspired and enthused reading it again
[29:19] i just had to say something so praise
[29:21] the lord we're uh we've gone through
[29:23] this scripture of course in many facets
[29:25] uh that are pertaining to the rapture we
[29:27] are on part 19 and i figured uh figured
[29:30] it out or factored it it's been like
[29:32] four months uh that we've been on this
[29:35] subject and uh i don't believe there's
[29:38] much more the lord has i feel like it's
[29:39] coming to a close but this scripture
[29:42] here that we finally got to the place
[29:44] that we're majoring on and got to verse
[29:47] 16. we started on verse 16 last week and
[29:51] uh where the bible says the lord himself
[29:55] amen now he's not sending a substitute
[29:56] but the lord himself shall descend from
[29:59] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[30:02] the archangel with the trump of god and
[30:04] the dead in christ shall rise first so
[30:07] being that this scripture that brother
[30:10] branham broke it down in the rapture
[30:11] message felt inspired to do the same
[30:14] thing for us as as we go through this
[30:17] now of course he went through it in just
[30:19] a few minutes and uh and i i told you
[30:23] last week as we were
[30:24] uh looking into the shout and as the
[30:26] lord was unfolding things and revealing
[30:28] things
[30:29] it could have been another two or three
[30:31] services probably at least and that's
[30:32] just coming from my little p brain and
[30:34] my little image limited understanding i
[30:37] imagine that somebody who really had a a
[30:39] really uh a
[30:42] good revelation or brain or something
[30:44] they could think it through could
[30:45] probably spend weeks on it maybe but uh
[30:48] but we just took one service on the show
[30:51] uh finished it last week i told you
[30:53] there's other things that the lord gave
[30:54] me and there's notes still in my desk i
[30:57] just left that alone well he did the
[30:58] same thing yesterday
[31:00] uh it started during the week
[31:02] but well it started long before that but
[31:05] to to the writing down of notes
[31:08] about the next facet of this so we are
[31:10] talking about now the shout the voice
[31:13] and the trump now those three things is
[31:16] as we know the bible says the lord
[31:18] himself shall shall descend with so we
[31:21] know that the lord does all three while
[31:23] he is descending while he is in his mode
[31:26] of descension coming to the gentile
[31:30] bride to take her home now remember
[31:33] there's songs and there's messages and
[31:35] there's people that for so long talk
[31:37] about when jesus puts his foot on earth
[31:39] again friend jesus is not going to plant
[31:42] a foot on this earth outside of us being
[31:44] his proxy until the millennium amen
[31:47] jesus does not put a foot on this earth
[31:50] again outside of us
[31:52] being his representatives he does not
[31:54] put a foot on this earth again in a
[31:56] corporal body until the millennium we go
[31:59] to meet him in the air but on his
[32:01] dissension now he does these things
[32:04] these three things in that mode of
[32:06] descension the first one was a shout
[32:10] when his distinction was that he sent a
[32:13] message down and he brought a prophet
[32:15] into this last day to bring that message
[32:18] to a people so that that word could be
[32:20] revealed to their heart to prepare them
[32:23] and gather them together now we figured
[32:26] that we found that out last week
[32:27] scripturally that the message was to
[32:30] come because remember this rapture is an
[32:33] international rapture right this rapture
[32:35] isn't just come together our little
[32:37] church or our little city or state or
[32:40] even country this this message come
[32:43] together a bride a gentile last day
[32:46] alive and remain group bride from around
[32:48] the world
[32:49] from all kindred tongues people nation
[32:53] god is gathering his people together so
[32:56] if if being in one nation doesn't gather
[32:58] us together if being of one uh a culture
[33:02] doesn't bring us together if being of
[33:05] one language doesn't bring us together
[33:07] if all if none of these common things
[33:09] that we talk that people have in common
[33:11] that that bring them together remember
[33:13] brother brown talked about denominations
[33:15] and the commonality that denominations
[33:18] have and and basically what that was was
[33:20] just people with common ideas flocking
[33:22] to the same place at the same time which
[33:25] is more no more really than just a lodge
[33:28] it's just a it's just a place where
[33:30] common people with common ideas and
[33:32] thoughts come together and share those
[33:34] ideas together well that that's that's
[33:36] nothing more than a lodge that's nothing
[33:39] more than than than a soup supper or a
[33:41] senior center or something where people
[33:43] just come together like brother pat has
[33:45] a thing on online about cars and all the
[33:48] people that care and
[33:49] and love cars and all come to that group
[33:51] and they share their ideas and their
[33:53] thoughts and that little chat room or
[33:55] whatever it is that they discuss they
[33:57] discuss cars people who don't care
[33:59] anything about cars probably sister pat
[34:02] doesn't have anything to do with that
[34:03] group and doesn't want to don't care
[34:05] anything about it
[34:06] so so what is it it is there's got to be
[34:10] a commonality that brings all the bride
[34:14] from around the world and the alive and
[34:17] remain group to bring her all together
[34:19] so all these other things don't do it
[34:21] what will do it it's got to be the word
[34:24] of god yes the word is common everywhere
[34:27] and the revelation of the spirit of god
[34:29] is common everywhere to every
[34:32] people tongue nation and so this message
[34:35] came to gather those people together in
[34:38] that thought of that word by the
[34:40] revelation of that word to bring her
[34:43] under that one headship that one auspice
[34:47] the word
[34:48] the message christ the word so that
[34:50] shout was to come as we found out was to
[34:53] come to gather the
[34:55] the alive and remain group together
[34:58] so there's that uh that element that
[35:02] that that is to bring her to the place
[35:04] that she's ready when he calls yes
[35:08] when that call happens when that trumpet
[35:10] sounds she's ready to go to meet him
[35:14] the preparation of this wedding garment
[35:17] is what was to do that that was the
[35:19] shout amen now the voice
[35:22] so we established that last week now the
[35:24] voice
[35:25] uh that's the second thing here so the
[35:28] shouts to bring together the alive and
[35:30] remain group and there's to be a voice
[35:33] amen a voice that's to go forth
[35:36] now
[35:37] a voice a person's voice
[35:40] is one of the most
[35:42] distinguishing features that a person
[35:44] has
[35:46] um
[35:47] you've probably set and heard me
[35:49] minister long enough or talk or teach
[35:52] you long enough that if if you were
[35:56] blindfolded and you walked into a
[35:58] strange place with strange people and i
[36:00] started talking you would probably know
[36:02] it's me yes
[36:04] just like i would probably know because
[36:06] i've heard long enough that i would know
[36:07] it's you
[36:08] amen i would know that
[36:11] i could pick up the phone
[36:13] and it'd be a stranger and i wouldn't
[36:15] know that person somebody could call
[36:17] come walk in the door and a stranger i
[36:19] may not know them
[36:20] if i had my back turned i might not
[36:22] recognize i probably wouldn't recognize
[36:24] their voice because they're a stranger
[36:25] to me
[36:26] but
[36:28] my mother could call me and i didn't
[36:30] have to have caller id to know
[36:34] and i heard one millisecond of her voice
[36:37] i knew it was her right i mean why
[36:40] because i've been listening to that
[36:41] voice and she's gone on now but uh
[36:43] before she passed i've been listening
[36:45] that voice for 55 years
[36:48] plus 54 years plus the nine months i was
[36:51] in her
[36:53] so i had been listening to her my entire
[36:55] life so of course i am that close to her
[36:59] our personal relationship is close that
[37:02] when she said something i knew it was
[37:04] her immediately i knew it was her yes
[37:07] most of you if not you i would know
[37:10] right away if you walked in the door and
[37:11] i was blindfolded i would know who it
[37:13] was i could tell you who it was because
[37:15] i know your voice it's one of the most
[37:17] distinguishable
[37:18] distinguishing uh
[37:20] uh factors of of of a person
[37:24] this the significance of your voice
[37:27] it means a lot amen now uh
[37:31] you have distinguishing factors that you
[37:33] can look at a person and tell them or or
[37:36] something like that in fact uh you know
[37:38] what a lot of times when someone sees a
[37:40] crime and they actually you know
[37:45] go to the police and tell them they saw
[37:46] a crime mostly just video it now and
[37:49] anyway so if they actually want to go
[37:52] they well what is the what did the
[37:53] perpetrator look like
[37:55] most of the time they first thing they
[37:57] say is is if they were white or black or
[37:59] hispanic or
[38:01] asian or something like that that's one
[38:03] of the most distinguishing physical
[38:05] features people may call that racist but
[38:07] it's the truth that's just the one of
[38:09] the most distinguishing factors that a
[38:11] human has that to look at amen and you
[38:14] can say well he was about six foot tall
[38:16] it was a guy as a man uh obviously
[38:19] very distinguishing too all the days
[38:21] sometimes you see people you're just not
[38:23] sure
[38:24] but six foot
[38:25] uh had a beard or
[38:27] or a slim build or a heavy builder
[38:30] things like that those are all
[38:31] distinguishing features for the eye but
[38:33] what about to the spirit
[38:36] because we're not talking about
[38:37] something that you can see with your eye
[38:39] because we go to see him now there was a
[38:42] day when jesus came in a corporal body
[38:44] and they could touch him they could see
[38:46] him they could feel him
[38:49] all the distinguishing factors to know
[38:51] this is jesus but there's but there had
[38:53] to be something that spoke to their
[38:55] spirit to tell them who jesus was
[38:58] because that flesh of jesus was simply
[39:01] that
[39:02] without a revelation without something
[39:04] that resonated back to that person that
[39:07] that's who that was then it was just
[39:09] another individual
[39:11] just like most the people in that day
[39:13] they saw jesus they might have ate with
[39:15] them they might have been in church with
[39:16] it
[39:20] but to them is nothing more than just
[39:22] another person so there had to be
[39:24] something distinguishable that voice
[39:27] is something that speaks it's
[39:29] distinguishable
[39:31] amen and it's the one of the most
[39:32] distinguishing characteristics that a
[39:35] person has
[39:36] amen it it's distinguishable now let's
[39:40] go to uh
[39:41] uh i'm gonna
[39:43] change things up a little bit from where
[39:44] i was going to but let's go to saint
[39:46] john chapter 11
[39:50] or chapter 10 excuse me
[39:56] chapter 10.
[40:00] we'll come back to that first
[40:02] thessalonians in a minute
[40:05] but
[40:06] just to follow up with
[40:09] uh this thought
[40:11] on the voice
[40:13] and like i said the saints i left uh
[40:16] i left pages of notes that i'm not even
[40:19] going to get into today
[40:21] uh about the voice the voice of god my
[40:24] boy sits in the bride today
[40:26] uh but saint john chapter 10
[40:30] verse 27 uh
[40:34] let's start with verse 25.
[40:37] jesus answered them i told you and you
[40:39] believe not
[40:41] the words that i do in my father's name
[40:43] they bear witness of me but ye believe
[40:45] not because ye are not of my sheep as i
[40:48] said unto you
[40:50] my sheep hear my voice
[40:53] amen
[40:54] my sheep hear my voice and i know them
[40:58] and they follow me
[41:00] so those that know the voice of god are
[41:03] those that belong to him those that are
[41:06] his sheep
[41:08] those that are his disciples
[41:10] those that belong to him those that are
[41:12] attributed
[41:15] as a seed from before the foundation of
[41:17] the world he knew them then he knows
[41:19] them now amen
[41:21] and they recognize his voice right so
[41:25] when he speaks
[41:27] not william branham when he speaks now
[41:30] he spoke through william brown but when
[41:32] he speaks it resonates to your heart
[41:35] to your life and you know that it's him
[41:38] speaking right
[41:39] because it's of his authority not of not
[41:42] brother adam's not mine not anybody
[41:44] else's it's of his authority that he
[41:47] speaks and we know that voice
[41:50] now how do we know that voice the same
[41:52] way we know all the other voices that we
[41:54] know
[41:55] i spent time with him
[41:58] i've listened to his voice i've spoke to
[42:00] him he knows me
[42:02] he loves me i love him we have a
[42:05] relationship
[42:07] and in that relationship there's
[42:09] conversation
[42:10] in any good relationship in any
[42:12] relationship at all there's
[42:14] conversation when you have conversation
[42:16] with god you speak he hears
[42:19] he speaks back you know his voice
[42:22] because his voice doesn't necessarily
[42:24] although it can
[42:25] speak to your ears but his voice speaks
[42:28] to your heart yes
[42:31] and when his voice speaks in the spirit
[42:33] to your heart then it's something that
[42:36] that speaks to you and resonates in your
[42:38] life to know who it is
[42:40] it's not a distinguishing see i went
[42:42] through all that to see it's not a
[42:45] distinguishing characteristic of
[42:47] something that we see takes phil smeller
[42:49] here it's a distinguishing
[42:51] characteristic of what speaks to your
[42:53] heart
[42:54] it speaks inside you so that it stirs
[42:58] you that you know that it's him it's not
[43:00] just a man
[43:02] and when you put on that tape you know
[43:03] that is it's not a man it's god speaking
[43:06] to you right when god ministers from
[43:09] this word when god speaks to you through
[43:11] the word you know it's him because it's
[43:13] his voice speaking right it's not a
[43:16] person then
[43:17] when you speak preach uh uh
[43:20] bring the word it's it's it's god it's
[43:23] his voice speaking and we know his voice
[43:26] and he said my sheep hear my voice
[43:30] my she
[43:31] now you see the rest of the world
[43:34] those that are not his sheep they don't
[43:36] know him
[43:38] they don't know his voice you can read
[43:40] through the bible and
[43:42] this is some of the notes i left on my
[43:43] desk or in my desk but you can read all
[43:46] through the scripture where uh god would
[43:48] speak and others didn't hear anything
[43:50] but a trumpet right or a thunder
[43:53] or a noise usually a thunder brother
[43:55] says the voice of god is the thunder
[43:58] amen like revelation 10 when the
[44:00] thunder's
[44:01] when he's when he screamed with a loud
[44:03] voice it
[44:06] speeds of thunder and that's a whole
[44:08] nother that's a whole nother service but
[44:11] other people around just like when when
[44:13] jesus spoke to paul to saul which became
[44:16] paul
[44:17] up to him
[44:18] others around him they heard a voice but
[44:20] they didn't know what what was going on
[44:21] or who it was or what was being said
[44:24] only paul did because paul was the one
[44:26] that could hear his voice
[44:28] amen because it spoke spoke to his to
[44:31] his soul not to his ears
[44:34] the others around that's all they heard
[44:36] people around so many places when god
[44:38] talks all they heard was a thunder
[44:41] all they heard was a trumpet or so or a
[44:43] noise or a clasp or something that's all
[44:45] they heard
[44:46] that's all through the bible
[44:48] his sheep hear his voice
[44:51] and they know that voice that voice
[44:53] speaks to them and it's distinguishable
[44:56] amen
[44:57] now it's distinguishable outside of the
[45:00] distinguishable that we know one another
[45:03] because he speaks into
[45:07] amen doesn't go through the ears goes
[45:09] into the heart so when he speaks we know
[45:12] him amen
[45:14] and i know them and they follow me
[45:17] we follow him because it's his voice
[45:19] speaking
[45:21] and i give unto them eternal life and
[45:24] they shall never perish
[45:26] neither shall any man look at this i
[45:28] love this
[45:30] any man
[45:32] neither shall any man
[45:34] pluck them out of my hand amen praise
[45:37] the lord
[45:38] you belong to god your family belongs to
[45:41] god there is no one that can pluck him
[45:43] out of the hand of god there is no way
[45:46] they can be lost because they belong to
[45:48] him
[45:49] people get so worried all the time and
[45:52] fretting about this and that one and i
[45:54] understand the prayers for our loved
[45:56] ones friend i pray for them too
[45:58] i bring them before the lord expect god
[46:00] to convert them and bring them along and
[46:02] the sooner the better
[46:04] but if they're in god's hands he cannot
[46:06] lose one
[46:08] not one yes
[46:10] praise the lord
[46:11] my father who which gave them me is
[46:14] greater than all and no man is able to
[46:16] pluck them out of my hand i and my
[46:19] father are one
[46:20] praise the lord so that voice that
[46:23] speaks you recognize it
[46:26] well now let me ask you this question as
[46:28] we
[46:29] transition into the next part of this
[46:32] if we do
[46:34] what if what if you now recognize god's
[46:38] voice when god speaks to you
[46:40] do you recognize god's voice when he
[46:42] speaks to you do you know what's god
[46:44] speaking to you
[46:45] do you recognize that yes when you
[46:47] recognize that it's god speaking to you
[46:50] then
[46:52] then it transcends any and everybody
[46:54] else that might speak
[46:56] it takes precedence and more importance
[46:58] over anything anybody else might say
[47:02] it's the voice of god so if you
[47:04] recognize you acknowledged here today
[47:07] that you recognize the voice of god when
[47:09] it speaks to you
[47:11] do you not think that you would
[47:13] recognize that that voice cried out
[47:16] even if you've been in the grave or even
[47:18] if you you're not in the grave but even
[47:20] if you've fallen asleep or even if
[47:21] you're in that
[47:22] amen
[47:24] do you not think that you would still
[47:26] recognize
[47:27] god god doesn't lose you when you pass
[47:30] away
[47:31] actually it becomes
[47:33] closer greater
[47:34] more in the spirit realm right then in
[47:37] the flesh the flesh is what separated
[47:39] from the most now
[47:41] very much but don't you think you would
[47:43] if we know it now of course we would
[47:45] know it then
[47:47] when that voice cries out we would know
[47:48] that voice
[47:50] not surely they know that voice they did
[47:52] we talked about the in matthew chapter
[47:55] 27
[47:56] when we talked about matthew 27 when he
[47:58] when he cried with that loud voice
[48:01] and the dead in christ rose and appeared
[48:04] unto many when he cried with a loud
[48:06] voice and those people from the graves
[48:08] arose
[48:12] won't you think the same thing would
[48:13] happen with the same people with his
[48:15] voice spoke again
[48:17] in this last day yes well that's the
[48:19] scripture the dead in christ shall rise
[48:24] amen
[48:25] saint john chapter 11
[48:28] just a page over
[48:35] so saints
[48:36] we know his voice
[48:39] we know his voice
[48:42] listen that is very important for you to
[48:44] settle in your spirit your soul right
[48:46] now
[48:47] we know his voice
[48:49] if you don't know his voice if you're
[48:51] listening if you're watching if you
[48:54] don't know his voice saints repent and
[48:57] get to the place that your life is
[48:59] hitting christ and you come to the
[49:01] relationship with him that you know it's
[49:03] him when he's speaking
[49:06] i'm afraid
[49:08] and i use that word probably in the
[49:10] wrong context
[49:12] that a lot of people
[49:14] dares i say most people say they pray
[49:18] but they have a one-sided conversation
[49:20] right
[49:22] they're just talking
[49:24] there's no response there's no listening
[49:27] there's no conversation back
[49:30] well that's not a relationship
[49:33] if the conversation is not a two-way
[49:35] street then it's not a relationship it's
[49:37] not even a conversation
[49:39] that's why i tell you about our client
[49:41] the other day friday
[49:42] uh
[49:45] even when i had a second or two to say
[49:47] something he was already what he wasn't
[49:49] listening he was already in his mind he
[49:51] already knew what he was going to say
[49:52] next
[49:53] wasn't even concerned about it and a lot
[49:55] of people are the same way god i need
[49:56] this god give me that god i gotta have
[49:58] this god help oh and maybe help this
[50:00] person this person if you can't
[50:03] that's not a relationship that's not a
[50:05] conversation right
[50:07] there's no voice going on there that's
[50:09] just you talking
[50:10] but when there's a voice when there's
[50:12] when there's a conversation when there's
[50:14] a relationship
[50:16] now look there was a man one time that
[50:18] had a very dear relationship with jesus
[50:21] in the flesh when christ was here name
[50:24] was lazarus story john chapter 11 that's
[50:28] what i want to get to
[50:30] but but but understand
[50:33] we know his voice
[50:35] if you don't know it friend now is the
[50:37] time to get to knowing it am i amen
[50:40] now's the time
[50:41] or or he will cry out and you will miss
[50:43] it all together yes amen
[50:46] now
[50:47] saint john chapter 11
[50:49] uh we'll begin with verse 39.
[50:54] uh 38 we'll just do verse 38.
[50:57] saint john chapter 11 verse 38 jesus
[51:00] therefore again groaning in himself
[51:01] coming to the grave
[51:03] it was a cave and a stone lay upon him
[51:06] jesus said take ye away the stones
[51:10] martha the sister of him that was uh
[51:13] the sister of him that was dead saith
[51:15] unto him lord by this time he stinketh
[51:19] he'd been dead four days
[51:23] after three days after 72 hours
[51:25] corruption sets in amen and she knows
[51:28] that and he knew that after in the
[51:30] fourth day he's thinking he's rotting
[51:32] faith's falling in
[51:34] he's he's as
[51:37] as you would think in the automobile
[51:39] industry he's beyond repair
[51:43] or or any mechanical device it's beyond
[51:46] repair it can't be fixed and that's what
[51:48] her
[51:49] implication here was he stinketh lord
[51:52] he's beyond repair you can't raise him
[51:54] now he's already face has fallen in skin
[51:56] worms has eaten on him he's he's beyond
[51:58] repair he's done it's been four days
[52:02] but jesus said unto her
[52:04] said i not unto thee that if thou
[52:06] wouldst believe thou should have see the
[52:08] glory of god
[52:10] amen
[52:11] there you go so what does it take to see
[52:14] the glory of god
[52:16] faith yes it takes faith to see the
[52:19] glory of god you want to see the glory
[52:21] of god today you must have faith in him
[52:24] yes
[52:26] he said if you would just believe have
[52:28] faith you would see the glory of god
[52:31] amen
[52:33] then they took away the stone from the
[52:34] place where the dead was laid jesus
[52:36] lifted up his eyes and said father amen
[52:40] i thank thee
[52:41] that thou has heard me
[52:43] and i knew that thou hurdest me always
[52:46] but because of the people which stand by
[52:49] i said it
[52:51] that they may believe that thou has sent
[52:54] me
[52:55] and when he had thus uh when when he
[52:57] thus had spoken
[52:59] he cried with a loud voice
[53:02] lazarus
[53:03] come forth
[53:05] amen
[53:07] and he that was dead came forth bound
[53:09] hand and foot the grave closed his face
[53:11] was bound about with a napkin jesus said
[53:14] unto them loose him and let him go
[53:17] praise the lord
[53:18] loose him what came forth
[53:22] jesus cried with a loud voice
[53:25] lazarus
[53:27] come forth and that voice brought the
[53:30] dead back to life again amen amen that
[53:34] voice
[53:35] brought the dead back to life the same
[53:38] voice first thessalonians 4 16
[53:41] that voice that cries out that will
[53:43] resurrect the dead one day
[53:46] now brother adam said i believe
[53:48] if jesus said stood there don't matter
[53:51] where he was even though he was in front
[53:53] of the grave if he had stood there if
[53:54] you'd been on the mount of olives god
[53:56] wherever he had been if jesus had stood
[53:58] there and said come forth
[54:01] every grave that every body in the
[54:03] ground would have opened right then and
[54:04] there
[54:06] amen but he said lazarus
[54:08] come forth so it was so there was a
[54:10] significance
[54:12] to the voice that was sounding
[54:15] those voices all through the bible and
[54:18] we've talked about those voices and the
[54:20] voices of our nominal uh life our
[54:23] natural life we talked about all those
[54:26] voices there are all kind of voices
[54:28] scriptural voices but there was
[54:30] significance to this voice
[54:33] amen to this voice now
[54:37] this
[54:38] resurrection of the dead
[54:41] says that he spoke with a loud voice
[54:45] and as i dramatized and as we many times
[54:48] or oftentimes
[54:50] think in our minds
[54:52] when god's when the bible says he spoke
[54:55] with a loud voice
[54:56] we think that god yelled it
[55:00] now
[55:01] that may have very well been true
[55:04] brother branham dramatized it the same
[55:06] way
[55:07] but if you go look in the greek you'll
[55:09] see that that word loud means just as
[55:13] much
[55:14] great voice as it does loud voice
[55:19] so my point here in saying this is it
[55:21] wasn't necessarily the voice itself or
[55:25] the volume of the voice as much as it
[55:27] was the significance and the power and
[55:31] authority that was behind that voice
[55:34] amen the loud voice means great
[55:38] it means
[55:40] uh
[55:41] imminent for ability virtue authority
[55:45] and power
[55:46] that's the same verb it's the same
[55:48] definition of the word loud
[55:51] loud voice great voice there was
[55:55] authority behind the voice there was
[55:58] significance
[55:59] to that voice the purpose of that voice
[56:02] and what he did there and calling out
[56:05] lazarus was for that one singular human
[56:09] male to come forth from the dead
[56:12] and when that voice screamed out
[56:15] lazarus came forth
[56:17] now the bible says he came forth now it
[56:20] also said esteemed the void the loud is
[56:22] esteemed highly for the importance of a
[56:25] great moment or a great weight
[56:28] importance so it isn't just necessarily
[56:32] the volume as as much as it is the
[56:34] importance the significance the
[56:37] greatness the power and authority behind
[56:40] it amen amen
[56:42] the authority that jesus carried when he
[56:45] cried with that authoritative voice
[56:48] lazarus came from the dead right
[56:51] after state king
[56:53] been dead for four days now think about
[56:55] that
[56:56] now this is before the resurrection of
[56:59] the old testament saints yes
[57:01] so this is a this is a resurrection of a
[57:04] person
[57:05] scripturally
[57:07] unprecedented
[57:08] until this time
[57:10] where this man came forth after being in
[57:13] a grave
[57:14] after corruption had set in after after
[57:17] 72 hours
[57:18] four days
[57:20] now that corruption that just proves
[57:23] scripturally
[57:25] that it doesn't matter how far you've
[57:26] gone
[57:27] it doesn't matter how
[57:28] dead you are yes doesn't matter how long
[57:31] you've been dead it doesn't matter how
[57:32] long the body's been in a grave
[57:34] when that voice cries out
[57:37] the significance of that voice of first
[57:40] thessalonians 4 16 is going to raise
[57:43] every dead person out of the grave
[57:47] that died in christ
[57:49] those who died in christ from the first
[57:52] church age we've explained from the
[57:53] first church age to this time
[57:56] they're all going to resurrect at that
[57:58] voice amen right
[58:00] amen
[58:02] the significance of that voice
[58:05] the authority behind that voice that
[58:08] loud voice that authoritative voice is
[58:11] going to cry out
[58:13] and it doesn't matter where they are
[58:15] it doesn't matter friend listen to me
[58:17] you
[58:20] and you could scatter their ashes from
[58:22] here to china yes
[58:24] but when that voice cries out
[58:27] every molecule of that being is going to
[58:29] come together again in a glorified state
[58:32] and resurrect a new life yes
[58:35] man
[58:37] this body
[58:38] i know it's a nasty past house now
[58:41] friend but it won't be then right right
[58:43] and it don't matter how rotten they are
[58:45] it don't matter how stinking they are it
[58:47] don't matter if they ain't nothing but a
[58:49] bunch of bones or dust laying in that
[58:51] casket or if their ashes are spread
[58:54] across the pacific ocean
[58:56] yes
[58:56] god when that voice comes forth is going
[58:58] to bring every molecule of it back
[59:01] together again
[59:02] amen resurrection yes the time of the
[59:06] resurrection where that voice brings
[59:08] them all together
[59:09] amen
[59:11] now lazarus came forth
[59:13] bible says here he came forth
[59:15] and as he come out of the grave
[59:18] the cave
[59:19] as he come out he was bound
[59:23] hand and foot
[59:27] well how do you think he got out of
[59:28] there then
[59:30] doesn't say anybody went in there and
[59:32] got him
[59:34] it doesn't say that
[59:36] that they had a rope and pulled him out
[59:39] it says he came forth
[59:42] bound hand and foot
[59:45] you ever tried to walk with your feet
[59:46] bound
[59:48] it's kind of tough
[59:52] i don't think i don't think it happened
[59:53] that way at all saints right you don't
[59:55] know my opinion now this isn't
[59:56] scriptural because this is my opinion
[59:59] i think lazarus came forth at that voice
[1:00:01] and he just levitated right across to
[1:00:03] jesus
[1:00:05] he had no way to walk right he was bound
[1:00:07] head and foot with great clothes he was
[1:00:09] like this friend
[1:00:10] found head and foot
[1:00:12] how was he supposed to walk out like
[1:00:14] that
[1:00:15] nobody came and got him how was he
[1:00:17] supposed to get out there
[1:00:19] hop like a bunny
[1:00:20] i didn't no i think that when that voice
[1:00:23] cried out that man came right out to
[1:00:25] jesus
[1:00:26] he came right out there and stood and
[1:00:28] then and
[1:00:29] sat right there jesus said listen let
[1:00:32] him go
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:34] loose him and let him go now
[1:00:36] they
[1:00:38] the practical application was they took
[1:00:40] all the great clothes off of him
[1:00:43] actually was he loosed from
[1:00:45] what was he actually loosed from the
[1:00:47] grip of
[1:00:50] death
[1:00:51] amen he was loosed from the grip of
[1:00:54] death right yeah he had great clothes
[1:00:56] all around him yeah practically they
[1:00:58] took all those great clothes off but
[1:00:59] what was he loose from
[1:01:02] what was he saying to let him go from
[1:01:04] death the curse of death the curse of
[1:01:07] death had no more hold on praise the
[1:01:09] lord because god had raised him from the
[1:01:12] dead yes amen amen now that curse wasn't
[1:01:15] completely broke until jesus himself did
[1:01:17] it the perfect sacrifice the perfect
[1:01:19] sacrificial lamb when he resurrected
[1:01:21] from the dead and destroyed death that
[1:01:24] destroyed it for good but this was just
[1:01:26] a sample
[1:01:28] this is just a this is just a little
[1:01:30] taste of what jesus is about to do and
[1:01:32] him himself with his voice
[1:01:35] that significant voice raising that man
[1:01:38] from the dead yes
[1:01:40] well if it rose if it rose them from the
[1:01:42] dead there
[1:01:44] if we cried the loud voice of the at his
[1:01:46] crucifixion and those that were in the
[1:01:49] graves
[1:01:50] arose
[1:01:52] then how would we thinking
[1:01:55] that the dead in christ that shall rise
[1:01:57] first even though we have the shout here
[1:02:00] the shout goes forth
[1:02:03] but in the but in the process of this
[1:02:06] rapture
[1:02:07] the dead actually raised first
[1:02:11] and are here with us again for a minimum
[1:02:13] of 30 days
[1:02:14] and then they're here and they present
[1:02:17] themselves and we see those
[1:02:19] uh those ones lost ones of those loved
[1:02:22] ones those who've gone on before
[1:02:25] and we're here together
[1:02:27] gathered
[1:02:28] shout voice
[1:02:31] voice of the resurrection that
[1:02:33] resurrects now i've heard people say
[1:02:37] and i don't dispute this and i'm not
[1:02:38] saying they're wrong and i'm not saying
[1:02:40] i'm right
[1:02:41] but i was thinking about this because i
[1:02:44] heard somebody one time say that it
[1:02:45] would be the voice of the bride that was
[1:02:47] resurrect the dead
[1:02:49] and i thought why that that that has
[1:02:51] merit i i i could see that you know
[1:02:54] brother graham said the voices in the
[1:02:55] bride
[1:02:57] but then i started looking and
[1:02:59] and and thinking about this and praying
[1:03:01] about it meditating on it however you
[1:03:03] want to say we all do it different ways
[1:03:05] i guess but my connection with the lord
[1:03:07] and him speaking to me
[1:03:09] is maybe different than yours but the
[1:03:11] important part is we speak to him and he
[1:03:14] speaks to us so when he spoke
[1:03:16] and reminded me of that of that quote
[1:03:19] that brother branham said
[1:03:21] the bride would have would be the final
[1:03:24] voice to the final age amen
[1:03:27] he did not say that she would be the
[1:03:29] voice to all the other ages
[1:03:32] he did not say that her voice would be
[1:03:34] the voice for all those that have gone
[1:03:36] beyond he said she would be the final
[1:03:39] voice to the final age
[1:03:42] based on that i disagree with
[1:03:45] that being the voice of the bride to do
[1:03:48] that now may be true i don't know if the
[1:03:51] lord chose me for the light i'll let you
[1:03:53] know if he showed you something
[1:03:55] but
[1:03:57] all i can see in the scripture
[1:03:59] it it it's not that way now
[1:04:02] does the bride speak with the authority
[1:04:04] of god behind her yes
[1:04:07] brother brown said she'll have thus
[1:04:08] saith the lord or she'll keep quiet
[1:04:10] right so she's got thus saith the lord
[1:04:12] she speaks as god would speak absolutely
[1:04:16] but in what capacity because remember
[1:04:19] the significance of the voice is just as
[1:04:22] important as the voice
[1:04:24] what was the voice for
[1:04:27] now
[1:04:27] let's go before i get ahead of myself
[1:04:29] let's go to first corinthians
[1:04:32] i'm going to close uh here shortly but
[1:04:35] first corinthians
[1:04:42] amen first corinthians chapter 14
[1:04:50] verse chapter 14 verse 6.
[1:04:54] first corinthians 14 6. now paul is
[1:04:57] going to be on the gifts of the spirit
[1:04:58] now and of course
[1:05:00] this is expressively talking about gifts
[1:05:02] of the spirit and speaking in tongues
[1:05:05] which obviously is a gift of the spirit
[1:05:07] i don't know very many people that have
[1:05:09] it i have in the past
[1:05:12] i know people that probably still have
[1:05:14] it and just haven't done it in a long
[1:05:15] time because it still exists yes amen
[1:05:19] god didn't leave and brother branham and
[1:05:21] take all the gifts with him right amen
[1:05:23] the gifts of the spirit are still here
[1:05:25] including speaking in tongues it's still
[1:05:27] a good lesson for us today that is what
[1:05:29] paul is speaking of
[1:05:32] in the sixth verse he said now
[1:05:34] if i come unto you speaking with tongues
[1:05:37] what shall i profit you except i shall
[1:05:40] speak to you either by revelation or by
[1:05:43] knowledge or by prophesying or by
[1:05:45] doctrine in other words if i don't say
[1:05:47] something to you that you will
[1:05:48] understand if i don't say something to
[1:05:51] you in your vernacular in your language
[1:05:53] if i don't say something to you that you
[1:05:55] can comprehend what's the point in
[1:05:57] saying it
[1:05:59] right there's no communication there
[1:06:01] look communication is a two-way street
[1:06:04] communication people think communication
[1:06:06] like i spoke wednesday commute a lot of
[1:06:08] people think communication is just you
[1:06:10] talking
[1:06:12] that's not communication
[1:06:14] communication is a two-way street
[1:06:17] amen that's how you commune with each
[1:06:19] other you talk they talk you talk they
[1:06:21] talk it's a conversation
[1:06:23] it's the same thing here
[1:06:25] that's the only way that that that you
[1:06:27] can actually have relationship
[1:06:30] is it's you have fellowship
[1:06:32] you talk you talk to each other
[1:06:35] and if and if there's no discussion
[1:06:38] if i just if i just talk to you just
[1:06:41] blabbering you're not gonna understand
[1:06:43] what i have to say even though i might
[1:06:44] have something on my heart to say that
[1:06:46] means something and it's significant but
[1:06:48] if i just go but i'll be able to have
[1:06:50] you have to be able to help you again
[1:06:51] you're not gonna know what i'm talking
[1:06:53] about even if it's genuine tongues right
[1:06:56] you're not gonna know what i'm talking
[1:06:57] about of course unless the lord gives
[1:06:59] you the interpretation
[1:07:00] or somebody says the interpretation but
[1:07:02] paul's talking about someone coming
[1:07:04] forth and just speaking in tongues and
[1:07:07] how is that edifying anybody
[1:07:10] now you say oh you can feel the spirit
[1:07:12] that's true
[1:07:15] and i enjoy that that that's wonderful
[1:07:17] any time i've heard anybody speak in
[1:07:19] genuine tongues or prophesy or something
[1:07:22] i feel a powerful anointing
[1:07:24] amen if it's genuine i've been involved
[1:07:27] so but if it's genuine i feel the power
[1:07:29] of god moving strong
[1:07:31] see and i feel that and that's good but
[1:07:34] what is the edification of the message
[1:07:36] they're giving if it's not given to you
[1:07:39] where you can understand it
[1:07:41] and that's his whole point
[1:07:42] amen
[1:07:43] the point is
[1:07:46] is is being able to bring you something
[1:07:48] that that you can comprehend that you
[1:07:50] can uh that you can understand that you
[1:07:52] can hear
[1:07:55] and listen now seventh verse and even
[1:07:57] things without life-giving sound either
[1:08:00] pipe or heart except they give it a
[1:08:03] distinction in the sounds how shall it
[1:08:05] be known what is pike their heart
[1:08:08] it's just like zach playing the guitar
[1:08:10] mic playing the piano
[1:08:11] micah could go over here and play on the
[1:08:13] piano be beautiful and you're like what
[1:08:15] is that
[1:08:17] but if he goes and plays beautifully on
[1:08:18] the piano a song that you know you're
[1:08:20] like oh yeah and you start singing with
[1:08:22] it and you feel the spirit move and the
[1:08:25] and the
[1:08:26] power of that message
[1:08:28] in that song because it came with words
[1:08:31] but even if it's not without life it's
[1:08:33] just uh it's just a musical instrument
[1:08:35] or something
[1:08:36] like the trumpet
[1:08:38] when it sounded it has to have a
[1:08:40] significance if he just plays on it
[1:08:43] it might sound nice but
[1:08:46] you don't know
[1:08:48] michael what song is that i just made it
[1:08:50] up or it's this song or something you've
[1:08:52] never heard
[1:08:54] amen but if you play something
[1:08:56] beautifully that you know
[1:08:58] then it speaks to you
[1:09:00] it it witnesses your spirit you might
[1:09:03] even again start singing the song with
[1:09:06] him
[1:09:07] because you know that it has a
[1:09:09] significance
[1:09:11] understand that's the point of this a
[1:09:13] significance
[1:09:16] eighth verse
[1:09:17] for if the trumpet old testament now if
[1:09:19] the trumpet give an uncertain sound who
[1:09:22] shall prepare himself to the battle of
[1:09:25] course you know back in the old
[1:09:26] testament the the trumpeters would shout
[1:09:29] out a specific command
[1:09:31] of what's going on if they see an enemy
[1:09:33] or somebody approaching or which
[1:09:35] direction they're coming from or how
[1:09:37] many there are something
[1:09:38] there has to be a significance to the
[1:09:41] trumpet as it played out
[1:09:44] the person had to understand what was
[1:09:47] being trumpeted
[1:09:49] sir like morse code if you will even if
[1:09:52] now it wasn't morse code of course but
[1:09:54] something to that ideal
[1:09:57] if if you got a dot dash dash dot dash
[1:10:00] dot or something morse code well if the
[1:10:02] trumpet sounded out in a specific order
[1:10:05] to say hey they're coming from the south
[1:10:07] it's so and so there's so many of them
[1:10:09] or whatever you know how to prepare
[1:10:11] yourself for the battle
[1:10:14] you know how to get ready for what's
[1:10:16] about to happen but if the trumpet just
[1:10:18] blasts out something you don't know or
[1:10:21] something you don't understand you sit
[1:10:23] there and say well i heard the trumpet
[1:10:25] but what's going on
[1:10:26] are they coming from the north south
[1:10:28] east west uh who is it are there
[1:10:31] is not mistaken and now you got a bunch
[1:10:34] of confusion
[1:10:37] trump it was for
[1:10:38] if it was for anything
[1:10:41] or what the significance of it was see
[1:10:44] they blasted it in a specific order or a
[1:10:47] specific way so that those that are in
[1:10:50] the congregation would know what is
[1:10:53] meant
[1:10:55] that's why that's why he's telling this
[1:10:57] story that's why paul's telling this
[1:10:58] story that's why i'm telling this story
[1:11:01] there's all kinds of voices there's all
[1:11:04] kinds of people that use voices there
[1:11:05] are all kinds of voices that have
[1:11:06] significance in the bible
[1:11:08] but there's a significant special voice
[1:11:12] let's say special with power authority
[1:11:15] like what raised lazarus from the dead
[1:11:18] that is going to that is going to
[1:11:21] sound out
[1:11:23] to raise the dead that have gone on in
[1:11:25] these church ages
[1:11:27] that it's going to resurrect them
[1:11:30] there was something that had to gather
[1:11:32] together the alive and remain group
[1:11:35] to bring her under that one umbrella
[1:11:38] to bring her one under that one auspice
[1:11:40] together the bride might not know who
[1:11:42] they are where they are can't speak the
[1:11:44] language whatever but we're we're knit
[1:11:47] together by that one commonality
[1:11:51] well the the dead in christ have to have
[1:11:53] the same thing
[1:11:55] now they're dead in christ so they died
[1:11:58] with that commonality
[1:12:00] if they didn't die with that commonality
[1:12:02] of christ then they're not coming up
[1:12:04] anyway
[1:12:05] so they died with that commonality they
[1:12:08] had all that in common when they passed
[1:12:11] so when that voice cries
[1:12:14] that voice isn't just for a lazarus
[1:12:18] it's not just for a william brown it's
[1:12:20] not just for a martin luther it is not
[1:12:23] just for my mom or dad that voice when
[1:12:26] it cries is going to resurrect the
[1:12:28] entirety of the dead that died in christ
[1:12:31] ahead of us
[1:12:33] that's why they rise first
[1:12:36] and we're all here together at one time
[1:12:38] praise the lord so his dissension
[1:12:42] is with that shout
[1:12:44] for the alive and remain
[1:12:45] that voice
[1:12:47] for those that have gone ahead
[1:12:49] to gather them together to to ready
[1:12:52] themselves to be prepared
[1:12:55] when that trumpet sounds to take them
[1:12:57] home
[1:12:58] amen the shout the voice the trump
[1:13:02] each one each one has its own
[1:13:05] significance
[1:13:07] amen i'm going to read a couple of the
[1:13:09] scriptures
[1:13:11] in saint john chapter 6
[1:13:15] saint john chapter 6 verse 35.
[1:13:22] jesus said unto them i am the bread of
[1:13:25] life
[1:13:26] he that cometh to me shall never hunger
[1:13:29] and he that believe on me shall never
[1:13:32] thirst
[1:13:33] but i said unto you that ye also have
[1:13:36] seen me and believe not they're not of
[1:13:38] his sheep
[1:13:41] all that the father giveth me shall come
[1:13:43] to me amen can't him out of his
[1:13:45] hand
[1:13:46] praise the lord
[1:13:47] they'll all come
[1:13:50] may somebody come
[1:13:52] and serve him for years
[1:13:53] some may come and serve him for a minute
[1:13:56] but all that are his are going to come
[1:13:59] right
[1:14:00] all the father has given me shall come
[1:14:02] to me and him that cometh to me i will
[1:14:05] in no wise cast out
[1:14:07] for i come down from heaven not to do my
[1:14:09] own will but the will of him that sent
[1:14:11] me
[1:14:12] and this is the father's will which has
[1:14:15] sent me
[1:14:16] that all those of all which he had given
[1:14:20] me i should lose nothing
[1:14:22] but should raise it up again at the last
[1:14:25] day
[1:14:26] amen amen he gonna raise them all up at
[1:14:30] the last day
[1:14:31] and this is the will of him that sent me
[1:14:34] that everyone which sees the son and
[1:14:36] believeth on him may have everlasting
[1:14:39] life and i will raise him up at the last
[1:14:42] day amen praise the lord
[1:14:45] everyone that has gone on don't don't
[1:14:48] care where their body is don't care if
[1:14:50] they were cremated don't care if they
[1:14:52] were buried people that would absolutely
[1:14:54] put you out of the economy of god if you
[1:14:56] have somebody you know cremated
[1:14:59] and that's a sad state in my opinion
[1:15:01] friend
[1:15:02] amen it's a tradition
[1:15:05] but it doesn't matter
[1:15:06] you can take them and you can you can
[1:15:09] you can take a plane ride around the
[1:15:11] world and you can scatter a little ash
[1:15:13] everywhere you go and that thing and
[1:15:15] every bit of it will come right back
[1:15:16] together
[1:15:17] so it don't matter yeah amen it doesn't
[1:15:20] matter
[1:15:21] god is more than able so many times we
[1:15:23] get it in our minds these things oh you
[1:15:25] know but god's god can do anything for
[1:15:28] him we know god can do anything
[1:15:31] he will raise him up
[1:15:33] at the last day
[1:15:35] saint john chapter 5.
[1:15:38] 24 page over saint john 25 or 5 24.
[1:15:45] verily verily i say unto you he that
[1:15:47] heareth my word
[1:15:49] and believeth on him that sent me have
[1:15:51] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:15:53] the condemnation but is passed from
[1:15:55] death unto life so friend if you ever
[1:15:58] feel
[1:15:59] condemned it's not god doing it
[1:16:02] if you're his
[1:16:03] you cannot be or come into
[1:16:06] condemnation
[1:16:08] satan will condemn you now
[1:16:11] the holy spirit might convict you right
[1:16:13] for doing something wrong
[1:16:15] to turn you around to do something right
[1:16:17] but he's never going to condemn you
[1:16:19] god is not in the business to try to
[1:16:21] make you his children feel like you are
[1:16:24] less than what you are in him
[1:16:26] and that's what condemnation does
[1:16:28] condemnation brings you down
[1:16:30] condemnation makes you feel low not
[1:16:32] humble though but less than what you
[1:16:34] really are right
[1:16:37] cannot come and accommodate condemnation
[1:16:39] but is passed from death
[1:16:41] unto life
[1:16:43] praise the lord verily verily i say unto
[1:16:44] you the hour is coming and now is when
[1:16:47] the dead
[1:16:49] shall hear the voice of the son of god
[1:16:51] and they that hear shall live
[1:16:55] amen they will come forth
[1:16:57] the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:17:01] amen
[1:17:02] for as the father hath life in himself
[1:17:04] so has he given to the son to have life
[1:17:07] in himself and has given himself
[1:17:10] authority to execute judgment also
[1:17:12] because he is the son of man marvel not
[1:17:15] at this
[1:17:16] for the hour is coming
[1:17:19] which
[1:17:20] and i there's there's we say the hours
[1:17:23] here
[1:17:24] amen and not today necessary i don't
[1:17:26] mean today but it's upon us amen
[1:17:30] for the hour is coming into which all
[1:17:33] that are in the graves shall hear his
[1:17:35] voice
[1:17:37] and shall come forth
[1:17:39] they that have done good unto the
[1:17:41] resurrection of life
[1:17:42] they that have done evil unto the
[1:17:45] resurrection of damnation
[1:17:47] and what is
[1:17:49] the resurrection of evil
[1:17:52] what are those that have done that have
[1:17:54] uh
[1:17:55] done the evil unto the resurrection of
[1:17:58] damnation
[1:17:59] what is it to be evil
[1:18:01] people say oh no murderers and
[1:18:04] and people who uh corrals around and
[1:18:08] all the gamblers down at the gambling
[1:18:09] every one of the gambling places going
[1:18:11] to hell and all the prostitutes and all
[1:18:13] the that's that's not evil
[1:18:15] those are the re those are the results
[1:18:17] of unbelief
[1:18:19] amen but evil is just not believing
[1:18:23] to be evil is not to believe
[1:18:26] on him whom he has sent that's evil
[1:18:30] and that's exactly what the devil is
[1:18:32] trying to get each and every human to do
[1:18:35] is to not believe it
[1:18:37] no matter what you say
[1:18:38] no matter what comes across your lips do
[1:18:41] you believe or not because your actions
[1:18:42] will determine whether you do or don't
[1:18:45] your life will determine whether you
[1:18:47] believe it or not
[1:18:49] it's that simple you don't have to say a
[1:18:50] word but what you do will dictate what
[1:18:54] you actually are
[1:18:55] what you actually believe
[1:18:57] amen evil is not to believe
[1:19:00] don't believe then you'll come up in the
[1:19:02] second resurrection unto the white
[1:19:04] throne judgment right
[1:19:06] my mind the rapture let me read this i'm
[1:19:08] closing the rapture message therefore
[1:19:10] the message called the message again the
[1:19:13] shout calls the bride together see the
[1:19:16] shout
[1:19:17] the same one
[1:19:19] with a loud voice screamed out that
[1:19:23] shower a voice screamed out with a voice
[1:19:25] that woke lazarus
[1:19:27] with a loud voice she cried lazarus come
[1:19:30] forth
[1:19:31] or a significant great
[1:19:34] authoritative voice
[1:19:36] not necessarily the volume but the
[1:19:39] significance
[1:19:40] the authority behind the voice
[1:19:43] it wakes up the sleeping bride the
[1:19:46] sleeping dead
[1:19:47] and they come forth
[1:19:49] amen for the dead in christ shall rise
[1:19:52] forth for the lord himself shall descend
[1:19:53] from heaven with the shout the voice of
[1:19:56] the archangel the trump of god and the
[1:19:58] dead in christ shall rise first
[1:20:01] oh my praise the lord let's stand if we
[1:20:03] could
[1:20:08] amen
[1:20:16] praise the lord i'm glad the lord has
[1:20:19] already prepared it's like that
[1:20:21] three-step process of becoming saved
[1:20:24] amen repent
[1:20:26] and if there's no remember that's that
[1:20:29] three stage the
[1:20:30] people always major on that the tip of
[1:20:32] the pyramid friend but if you don't have
[1:20:34] the foundation you'll never get to the
[1:20:36] tip of the pyramid right
[1:20:38] you'll never get to love them unless
[1:20:39] you've got faith
[1:20:41] and people always major on that end
[1:20:42] result they always forget a lot of times
[1:20:44] they do the same thing with with
[1:20:46] being born again
[1:20:48] they'd do the same thing there if you
[1:20:50] don't have repentance i don't care
[1:20:51] anytime you go to a water get baptized
[1:20:54] or whatever you're not going to get it
[1:20:56] right there's got to be repentance
[1:20:58] true sincere repentance amen yes if you
[1:21:02] repent
[1:21:04] then baptize the name of the lord jesus
[1:21:06] christ you shall receive the holy ghost
[1:21:08] yes
[1:21:09] that's the promise
[1:21:11] but the repentance has got to be done
[1:21:13] first before the
[1:21:17] salvation before there is the holy
[1:21:19] spirit that comes not just on you not
[1:21:22] just feel a nice tingle but the holy
[1:21:24] spirit that will come and live in you
[1:21:26] that spirit that will take a body in
[1:21:28] your life
[1:21:29] amen
[1:21:30] praise the lord that's where it makes a
[1:21:32] difference well that shout it's the same
[1:21:34] thing got to be the shout first
[1:21:37] before you have the voice yes
[1:21:39] for those who come together amen so we
[1:21:43] all go to meet the lord
[1:21:46] amen
[1:21:47] first he was here in a corporal body
[1:21:50] and he was here with him and

[1:22:04] little closer to them and him getting a
[1:22:06] little closer to us that's all it is

[1:22:29] brother graham said back when they
[1:22:30] started shooting rockets up the air
[1:22:32] people felt god just lived right up
[1:22:34] there and they thought oh if they'd
[1:22:35] shoot a rock up there they'll just rock
[1:22:36] it they'll just see god up there oh this

[1:26:53] o'clock
[1:26:55] but the subsequent two wednesdays we
[1:26:57] will not be having service
[1:26:59] so let me get my calendar that might
[1:27:00] help me a little bit
[1:27:02] um
[1:27:06] so this wednesday the 10th we will have
[1:27:08] church this coming wednesday the 10th
[1:27:11] which is this
[1:27:14] is the 17th and 24th we will not be
[1:27:17] having service here
[1:27:19] okay
[1:27:20] the lord willing brother rogers going
[1:27:21] out of town so i'm going to do some work
[1:27:23] in here and i'm going to
[1:27:25] uh
[1:27:26] do all the drywall repair and stuff we
[1:27:28] need to do so then the following week
[1:27:30] which should be the 16th 17th 18th we're
[1:27:33] gonna we're gonna try to paint
[1:27:36] uh i'd like to try to get it done on
[1:27:38] tuesday maybe wednesday but even if we
[1:27:40] get it done even if we get the painting
[1:27:42] done on tuesday
[1:27:44] you're not
[1:27:48] so
[1:27:49] i just thought it'd be easier to just
[1:27:51] cancel that wednesday night service
[1:27:53] since we're gonna try to paint uh and
[1:27:55] the paint fumes and everything and
[1:27:57] hopefully we'll have it
[1:27:59] good enough for the following sunday and
[1:28:01] then of course the next wednesday night
[1:28:03] is the wednesday night before
[1:28:04] thanksgiving
[1:28:05] so there will be no service here on uh
[1:28:07] on that wednesday night either so the
[1:28:09] 17th 24th so after this wednesday night
[1:28:12] the 10th there will be no more wednesday
[1:28:14] night services until december 1st
[1:28:16] amen so remember that
[1:28:18] um also
[1:28:23] have
[1:28:24] and there's not as many hardly as many
[1:28:26] here there was wednesday night but if
[1:28:28] you're watching streaming uh
[1:28:31] uh i'd like to try to have a dinner uh
[1:28:35] or something like that for us a
[1:28:37] fellowship luncheon together uh i
[1:28:40] mentioned it for sunday i talked to the
[1:28:42] landlord craig
[1:28:44] and
[1:28:45] uh about getting us one of these
[1:28:47] facilities places
[1:28:49] that we could have a meal in and he said
[1:28:51] sure he could do that and so
[1:28:54] i had to talk to myself i'm gonna charge
[1:28:56] you anything but whatever it is i'll pay
[1:28:57] for it but
[1:28:59] well have a
[1:29:00] be nicely cleaned this mess out next
[1:29:02] door we could just go right next door
[1:29:04] because it's big enough in there to have
[1:29:06] something so we'll have something
[1:29:09] wherever it is he'll
[1:29:11] supply us a facility to be able to have
[1:29:13] that and um
[1:29:14] so i would like to do it
[1:29:17] uh between thanksgiving and christmas
[1:29:20] so i forgot what i said we could do a
[1:29:22] saturday depending on what people would
[1:29:25] like to do
[1:29:27] but i thought
[1:29:28] um maybe like the
[1:29:32] uh the fourth or fifth
[1:29:34] the 11th or 12th which is saturday
[1:29:37] sunday saturday sunday
[1:29:39] so maybe one of those two weeks after
[1:29:41] that christmas starts selling in people
[1:29:43] get busy and things like that so maybe
[1:29:45] one of those two weekends
[1:29:47] if you'd like a saturday that's fine
[1:29:50] i'm planning on buying a refrigerator
[1:29:52] putting it over here so uh if we have
[1:29:54] cold stuff or something it can sit in
[1:29:56] there if we have drinks it could set in
[1:29:57] there uh obviously if you have stuff
[1:30:00] that needs to stay warm or crock pot or
[1:30:02] something like that we can plug them in
[1:30:04] uh just like we did at the other place
[1:30:06] so if you if that sounds like something
[1:30:09] i would like that um i always think it's
[1:30:12] a real blessing when we're able to do
[1:30:13] that
[1:30:14] and have something like that uh i'd
[1:30:17] prefer on sunday afternoon after service
[1:30:20] but if others would prefer a saturday we
[1:30:21] could do that too
[1:30:26] what you think i'll get some more
[1:30:27] details later and i'll let you know what
[1:30:29] we come up with for a facility and
[1:30:30] things like that and try to nail down a
[1:30:33] specific day time of course if it's on
[1:30:36] sunday it'll just be after church um so
[1:30:38] and if you have any other comments or
[1:30:41] ideas just let me know i appreciate that
[1:30:44] amen so remember the prayer request
[1:30:47] and things we had and
[1:30:49] those requests that came forth
[1:30:52] amen so
[1:30:54] i believe that's all the announcements
[1:30:56] i had to make
