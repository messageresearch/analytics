[49:42] one verse let you be seen in verse 10.
[49:44] verse 10 says finally my brethren
[49:47] be strong in the lord and then the power
[49:49] of his might
[49:51] you can be seated if you like
[49:55] and i want to
[49:56] go back to the first verse
[49:58] i want to speak on this morning on
[50:01] strong in the lord
[50:05] something that the lord had given me
[50:06] this week that
[50:08] i'm not really sure why but
[50:11] sometimes there's times that i don't
[50:13] really know why the lord puts a subject
[50:16] or something on my heart but
[50:18] there's always a reason for it so i'm
[50:20] doing so i try by by the grace of god
[50:23] not to take my own mind about it or my
[50:25] own way of what i want to do or what i
[50:27] want to say or
[50:29] any notes or scriptures or quotes or
[50:31] anything and just preach what the lord
[50:33] puts on my heart so
[50:35] it derives from this scripture
[50:37] be strong in the lord being strong in
[50:40] the lord but now i want to go back to
[50:42] the first verse and i want to read
[50:45] a good portion actually of the sixth
[50:47] chapter focusing
[50:49] on that tenth verse there and the title
[50:52] of course strong in the lord today
[50:55] first verse says
[50:57] ephesians 6 1 children
[50:59] obey your parents in the lord for this
[51:02] is right
[51:03] honor thy father and mother which is the
[51:06] first commandment with promise
[51:08] that it may be well with thee and thou
[51:10] mayest live long on the earth
[51:13] and ye fathers provoke not your children
[51:16] to wrath
[51:17] but bring them up in the nurture and
[51:19] admonition of the lord
[51:21] servants be obedient to them that are
[51:24] your masters according to the flesh
[51:26] with fear and trembling in singleness of
[51:28] your heart as unto christ
[51:31] not with i service as men pleasers but
[51:34] as the servants of christ
[51:36] doing the will of god from the heart
[51:39] with good will doing service as to the
[51:42] lord and not to men
[51:45] knowing that whatsoever good anything
[51:48] any good thing any man doeth
[51:50] the same shall be received of the lord
[51:53] whether he be bond or free
[51:55] and ye masters do the same things unto
[51:58] them forbearing threatening knowing that
[52:01] your master also is in heaven neither is
[52:04] there respect of persons with him
[52:07] finally my brethren be strong in the
[52:10] lord and in the power of his might
[52:12] put on the whole armor of god that ye
[52:14] may be able to stand against the wiles
[52:17] of the devil
[52:18] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[52:21] blood but against principalities against
[52:24] powers against the rulers of the
[52:27] darkness of this world against spiritual
[52:30] wickedness in high places
[52:32] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[52:34] of god that ye may be able to withstand
[52:37] in the evil day and having done all to
[52:40] stand
[52:42] stand therefore having your loins gird
[52:44] about with the truth and having the
[52:46] breastplate of righteousness your feet
[52:48] shod with the preparation of the gospel
[52:50] of peace
[52:51] above all take this shield of faith
[52:54] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[52:57] the fiery darts of the wicked and take
[52:59] the helmet of salvation and the sword of
[53:01] the spirit which is the word of god
[53:04] praying always
[53:06] with all prayer and supplication in the
[53:09] spirit and watching there unto with all
[53:12] perseverance and supplication for all
[53:15] saints
[53:16] amen
[53:17] it's quite a powerful reading of the
[53:19] scripture that the that uh
[53:22] paul gives to the ephesian church we
[53:24] know of course the ephesian churches
[53:26] brother brown teaches us was the
[53:28] strongest more spiritually stable a
[53:30] church that there was there in those
[53:33] of those churches that were there was
[53:35] the church of ephesus and that's why
[53:37] paul took it upon him to himself to
[53:39] teach to the church of ephesus things
[53:41] that were more spiritual binding and
[53:43] needful and
[53:45] and in more depth if you will it was
[53:47] about get along with this guy and don't
[53:49] say wrong things to this person don't
[53:51] have bitterness and don't have hardness
[53:53] and all those things are important but
[53:55] uh paul
[53:56] struck down to some very deep subjects
[53:59] when he began to talk to the current to
[54:01] the ephesian church and and helping us
[54:05] understand uh what we're facing today
[54:08] and being strong in the lord is one of
[54:10] those things now uh as we get to this
[54:13] topic this subject of strong in the lord
[54:16] uh the first thing that struck my mind
[54:19] is when that thought came when i first
[54:21] saw that uh i started to wonder what
[54:24] does it mean
[54:26] to be strong in the lord
[54:28] and if you think that in yourself i
[54:30] think a lot of times we read over
[54:31] scripture it says be strong in the lord
[54:33] oh okay i'll be strong with the lord.
[54:35] but what does that mean
[54:37] what does it mean to be strong in the
[54:39] lord i know what it means to be strong
[54:42] amen i know what it means to be
[54:44] physically strong i know what it means
[54:46] to have uh bulking muscles and be able
[54:48] to lift huge weights and and being
[54:51] strong physically to uh to be able to
[54:54] withstand
[54:55] certain obstacles in life physically i
[54:58] understand what that means but that just
[55:00] means a person that's strong
[55:02] uh but that's not what the scripture is
[55:03] saying the scripture is saying be strong
[55:07] in the lord amen what does it mean to be
[55:10] strong
[55:11] in the lord because that's a to me
[55:13] that's a completely different thing than
[55:16] even just being strong
[55:18] and even being strong spiritually
[55:21] you can be strong a person can be strong
[55:23] spiritually but not be strong in the
[55:25] lord
[55:26] there's a complete different thing to me
[55:29] as i look at it but the only way that
[55:31] you can be strong in the lord is for you
[55:34] to allow your life to let god have his
[55:39] way in you and through you amen that's
[55:41] the only way you're going to be strong
[55:43] in the lord yet a person might can be
[55:45] strong but and our strength can only
[55:47] take us so far as we're mentally strong
[55:50] or we're physically strong or
[55:52] emotionally strong and uh
[55:55] some people are stronger than others it
[55:57] seems like today the mental strength of
[55:59] people is going away we've becoming uh
[56:03] a society of of a
[56:06] mentally a society of mush
[56:09] we might have people as healthier we
[56:11] might have people living longer we might
[56:13] have people that are stronger than they
[56:15] used to be but mentally it seems like
[56:17] we're turned into much
[56:19] uh
[56:21] where we've just become a a a a
[56:25] what's that term that they use today
[56:27] um
[56:28] snowflakes uh i guess that's the term
[56:31] that you use mentally a snowflake
[56:33] something that uh
[56:35] has a a very low tolerance has a has a
[56:40] very short self shelf life uh someone
[56:44] that you can't touch or it'll
[56:45] disintegrate and fall apart uh they have
[56:48] to have their safe space now don't say
[56:50] anything hurtful or derogatory don't
[56:52] don't tell the truth about things
[56:54] because you might hurt somebody's
[56:55] feelings oh my goodness um
[56:58] if you can't have your feelings hurt a
[57:00] little bit every once in a while then
[57:02] uh
[57:03] we we're in bad shape friends i mean
[57:07] if you break it right down to it uh
[57:09] something is there to offend somebody
[57:12] every day
[57:15] if you live your life you're going to be
[57:17] hurt
[57:18] if you live your life you're going to be
[57:19] offended if you live your life your
[57:21] feelings are going to get hurt it just
[57:23] happens yeah amen so that kind of
[57:26] strength seems to be waning a little bit
[57:28] so
[57:29] that that's what the world offers but
[57:31] what we want to talk about is what it
[57:33] means to be strong in the lord
[57:35] amen to be strong in the lord
[57:38] where nothing rattles you
[57:42] nothing worries you
[57:44] you don't worry about things now being
[57:46] concerned about something is different
[57:48] to me than worry
[57:50] we pray over things and we trust the
[57:52] lord we believe god is going to move on
[57:54] that situation but it's not something
[57:56] that we consistently and and constantly
[57:58] worry about that we worry over that just
[58:01] shows that we're not strong in the lord
[58:03] we're only trying to use our own
[58:05] strength
[58:06] we're trying to use our own strength to
[58:08] withstand whatever the situation is and
[58:11] friend that just doesn't last you'll
[58:13] fold under the pressure of some uh
[58:16] trials that come in our lives we're just
[58:18] not the strength in ourselves to be able
[58:20] to do that we have to be strong in the
[58:23] lord
[58:24] and to be able to be strong in the lord
[58:26] and in the power of his might
[58:30] not my strength not my might i might try
[58:32] to fix it i might try to do something
[58:34] about it i might try to
[58:36] uh know what's better of a way to to
[58:39] manipulate this than god does but i
[58:41] don't
[58:42] the the truth of the matter is i don't i
[58:45] don't know a better way i don't know
[58:48] how to do it better
[58:50] i don't have a better idea about it so
[58:52] my strength needs to come in the
[58:55] settling of the lord to be settled in
[58:57] the lord so so that whatever comes
[59:00] i'm able to withstand it by the strength
[59:03] of the lord and the power of his might
[59:06] his might in me
[59:08] now being strong of the lord
[59:11] has got to now now i can
[59:13] we can go over the things about being
[59:15] strong in the lord
[59:17] building your strength
[59:19] uh brother adam talked about exercising
[59:22] your faith
[59:24] exercising your faith because uh the
[59:26] faith of god has has big muscles and
[59:29] hair on his chest
[59:31] but see brother random wasn't talking
[59:32] about physically he was talking about
[59:35] spiritually he was talking about a
[59:37] person built up to the place that no
[59:40] matter what comes their way they stand
[59:42] firm they stand steady
[59:45] no matter what it looks like feels like
[59:47] no matter what the circumstances present
[59:49] themselves as we stand steady and firm
[59:51] in the lord we're not rattled by it
[59:54] whatever comes we're not rattled by it
[59:56] we don't worry about it because we're
[59:59] we're depending on god
[1:00:01] we're trusting on the lord we have faith
[1:00:04] in god whatever god has done for us
[1:00:07] what god will always do and whatever god
[1:00:10] has done for somebody else
[1:00:12] whatever god has done through these
[1:00:14] scriptures not even necessarily to me
[1:00:16] before but in the word he has to do the
[1:00:19] same thing all the way through he's not
[1:00:21] god
[1:00:22] i can be strong to understand that god
[1:00:24] is in control i don't want to be in
[1:00:27] control how many of you tried to been in
[1:00:29] control and just ruined the whole
[1:00:30] picture
[1:00:32] amen i feel like sometimes that's been
[1:00:34] my life
[1:00:35] i've tried to take control over things
[1:00:37] and it just turned into a mess
[1:00:39] because i don't know i've got to be
[1:00:41] strong in the lord
[1:00:43] i've got to hold steady
[1:00:46] fast firm
[1:00:48] let nothing rather you because that's
[1:00:50] the thing that the devil wants to do is
[1:00:52] to rattle your faith
[1:00:54] is to get you internal back and forth
[1:00:57] now again i we can talk and and and i
[1:01:00] can i can bring you the scripture and
[1:01:03] the quotes and things that we talk about
[1:01:05] uh
[1:01:06] praying and having a good prayer life
[1:01:08] and and reading the scripture and having
[1:01:10] a a time that we that we're in the word
[1:01:12] of god and we're listening to the
[1:01:14] message and we're we're strengthening
[1:01:16] ourselves in the lord by all those
[1:01:18] things but friend you know all those
[1:01:20] things
[1:01:22] i don't i can remind you of those things
[1:01:24] i can remind myself of those things
[1:01:26] because they are ultimately extremely
[1:01:28] important in our spiritual strength
[1:01:31] in our faith in the lord because those
[1:01:34] things is what we draw strength from
[1:01:37] the word i believe that's why we're here
[1:01:39] this morning even we draw strength from
[1:01:41] that word we draw strength from one
[1:01:43] another we draw strength being in this
[1:01:46] presence of the holy spirit we draw
[1:01:48] strength from listening to the word and
[1:01:50] letting god minister to us and letting
[1:01:52] that word reveal itself to us and
[1:01:55] feeling strengthened that when we go out
[1:01:57] in the world we're able to withstand
[1:01:59] anything the devil might try to put
[1:02:00] before us yes because we're strong in
[1:02:03] him not strong in me i'm not depending
[1:02:05] on myself i'm not depending on my
[1:02:07] righteousness i'm depending on him and
[1:02:10] what his righteousness is and what he
[1:02:12] has given and done for me
[1:02:14] in my life in your life we stand strong
[1:02:17] sure all those things are important all
[1:02:19] those things are needful read your bible
[1:02:22] pray every day absolutely all those
[1:02:24] things we should do those because those
[1:02:27] are the things that bring us strength
[1:02:28] but the resulting element of it is the
[1:02:31] strength of god in my life
[1:02:34] in the power of his mind
[1:02:36] that's what i stand by now
[1:02:38] that being said
[1:02:41] which is the truth that being said
[1:02:44] it goes on to tell us
[1:02:47] that we
[1:02:48] put on the whole armor of god
[1:02:51] amen we
[1:02:53] put on the whole armor of god be strong
[1:02:56] in the lord
[1:02:57] and the power of his might
[1:03:00] but we also put on the whole armor of
[1:03:02] god
[1:03:03] and that whole armor of god that was
[1:03:05] just described here that talks about the
[1:03:08] uh the our loins girded with truth the
[1:03:11] the breastplate of righteousness our
[1:03:13] feet shod with the gospel of preparation
[1:03:16] gospel of peace shield of faith that we
[1:03:18] are able to withstand the fiery darts of
[1:03:20] the enemy the helmet of salvation the
[1:03:22] sword of the spirit
[1:03:24] the sword of the spirit
[1:03:26] amen
[1:03:27] amen that sword of the spirit that god
[1:03:29] give us to destroy the enemy with
[1:03:32] amen look what brother branham says
[1:03:33] about that
[1:03:35] we all know about the situation that
[1:03:37] brother branham went into when he was up
[1:03:38] on in sabino canyon
[1:03:42] and what we call pulpit rock or
[1:03:45] uh sword mountain or whatever anyone's
[1:03:48] verbiage might be to call it uh
[1:03:52] we all have everybody here been there
[1:03:54] yes we all been to sword sword mountain
[1:03:56] or they call pulpit rock or whatever uh
[1:03:59] anyway it's uh
[1:04:01] it's a bit of a hike and up a mountain
[1:04:04] if you haven't been there um
[1:04:06] i'd encourage you to but um i don't know
[1:04:08] how many of us would be able to make it
[1:04:10] in the heat the way it is today i've
[1:04:13] done a lot of uh i've done a lot of
[1:04:15] sabino tours in july and i i just soon
[1:04:18] not do another one

[1:04:22] town or something you know i would i
[1:04:24] would do it again i've had somebody a
[1:04:26] sister matisse even talked about wanting
[1:04:29] the church to take a pilgrimage up to
[1:04:31] sabine i said sister why didn't you say
[1:04:33] this in october november or something
[1:04:35] might have had a little bit of better
[1:04:37] participation uh going up so well we can
[1:04:40] go early but see the tram doesn't start
[1:04:42] running till
[1:04:43] i think nine o'clock
[1:04:45] uh so to get up there at six you're
[1:04:47] gonna have to walk and it's almost four
[1:04:49] miles from parking lot to the top and
[1:04:51] then you gotta go up switch back all the
[1:04:53] way up and up and up and and it's at
[1:04:55] least four hours if you take the tram
[1:04:58] uh
[1:04:59] but it's it's it's worth it i've done it
[1:05:02] dozens of times i guess and in the
[1:05:04] summer and a lot of times i've taken
[1:05:07] people and i tell them ahead of time
[1:05:09] make sure blink bring plenty of water
[1:05:11] they bring a bottle
[1:05:14] i learned to take about 10 bottles of
[1:05:17] water because i'm end up giving eight of
[1:05:19] them away
[1:05:20] and try to have a couple for myself
[1:05:22] but it's hot up there um
[1:05:25] but
[1:05:26] but fantastic supernatural things
[1:05:28] happened up there
[1:05:30] so it's it's a place that
[1:05:32] i appreciate going to
[1:05:34] and and i'm always blessed to go there
[1:05:37] and i'm and i'm blessed and thankful of
[1:05:39] the things that uh brother greene taught
[1:05:41] us and pictures he found and and brother
[1:05:44] branham's desk and stuff to help us
[1:05:46] understand exactly where these things
[1:05:48] were and uh
[1:05:50] it it to me is a special thing and i i
[1:05:53] i'd go on a heartbeat going times to
[1:05:55] just pray uh but um
[1:05:58] uh but i enjoy taking people and taking
[1:06:00] their for the first time i've gone with
[1:06:03] people and every stop we'd stop bring
[1:06:05] people from the congo
[1:06:07] and every stop we stopped at they'd take
[1:06:09] a half hour to pray every stop eagle
[1:06:12] rock and and then uh a sword mountain
[1:06:15] and then and dove cove and all the place
[1:06:18] and they'd sit and pray for a half hour
[1:06:21] at every spot
[1:06:22] i tell you in the presence of god would
[1:06:24] come it's just beautiful but anyway this
[1:06:27] outstanding thing that happened
[1:06:29] we know that when brother brown was up
[1:06:31] there
[1:06:32] he was praying one time and he had his
[1:06:34] hands lifted up
[1:06:36] and he said and he felt something hit
[1:06:38] his hand
[1:06:40] and it and he looked at it it was a
[1:06:42] sword
[1:06:43] and
[1:06:44] i'm telling you this to re refresh your
[1:06:46] memory on the story and those who may
[1:06:48] watch you don't know
[1:06:50] the sword hit his hand he opened his
[1:06:52] eyes and looked and the sword was
[1:06:54] glistening in the sun
[1:06:56] and then he started speaking and talking
[1:06:58] to himself and and a voice
[1:07:00] spoke back
[1:07:02] and said that is the king's sword
[1:07:06] now we get to the quote here this is
[1:07:08] this one is particularly from the breach
[1:07:10] message
[1:07:11] that voice said that is the king's sword
[1:07:15] and i thought if it would have said a
[1:07:18] king's sword it might have been that i
[1:07:20] would have understood it but it said the
[1:07:23] king's sword
[1:07:25] amen which we just read we know what
[1:07:27] that sword is right
[1:07:29] amen we know what that sword is we just
[1:07:31] read it in the scripture it's the king's
[1:07:34] sword
[1:07:35] so i may not have this right thought but
[1:07:37] there's only one the king and that is
[1:07:40] god and his sword here is sharper than
[1:07:43] in two edges sword
[1:07:44] as you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:07:46] you
[1:07:47] in dueling you see now this is the part
[1:07:49] i want to get to
[1:07:51] in dueling you see i don't understand
[1:07:53] one word of it or one principle of
[1:07:55] dueling but the best of my understanding
[1:07:58] the knife striking across
[1:08:00] finally the swords coming and striking
[1:08:03] one another
[1:08:04] and when the swords lock
[1:08:07] uh
[1:08:08] if they lock with the enemy
[1:08:11] and you lock the swords and the swords
[1:08:13] come together and they lock together
[1:08:16] uh like this it takes the strength of
[1:08:20] the man dueling
[1:08:22] because see his sword would be pointed
[1:08:24] at my heart
[1:08:26] mine to his heart
[1:08:27] but you're locked these swords
[1:08:30] striking together locked together
[1:08:32] and then they strike and when these
[1:08:34] swords come together
[1:08:36] the one that can shove the other one
[1:08:38] down
[1:08:39] shove the sword straight to the heart
[1:08:42] is the strength of the one who's doing
[1:08:46] so it takes the strength of the dueler
[1:08:49] to take the sword of the word
[1:08:52] to the heart of the enemy
[1:08:55] it takes the strength of the dueler now
[1:08:58] are you any match to the devil
[1:09:01] no
[1:09:02] i am not as strong in that spiritual
[1:09:05] context as he is
[1:09:07] but in christ the lord
[1:09:09] god has given me
[1:09:11] and supplied us with the strength with
[1:09:14] the power with the ability to be able to
[1:09:17] take this sword and drive it to the
[1:09:20] heart of the enemy
[1:09:21] satan is the enemy how many times have
[1:09:24] you locked swords with him
[1:09:26] well how many days have i been alive
[1:09:31] amen
[1:09:33] every day the devil tries to lock swords
[1:09:36] with me every day i lock swords with
[1:09:38] that devil
[1:09:39] bringing them together and it takes the
[1:09:42] strength now it's again the strength
[1:09:44] that the lord has supplied to us
[1:09:47] the strength that the lord has given me
[1:09:49] to once again in this new day to take
[1:09:52] that sword to bring it right through the
[1:09:55] heart of the enemy
[1:09:56] praise the lord defeat that enemy on the
[1:10:00] spot
[1:10:01] because he has no authority over you he
[1:10:03] has no authority over a child of god and
[1:10:06] we are strong in the lord and in the
[1:10:08] power of his might so it takes the
[1:10:11] strength of the dueler so where is our
[1:10:14] strength
[1:10:15] my strength is in the lord
[1:10:17] to be strong in the lord
[1:10:19] amen in jesus christ's name
[1:10:22] when we pray
[1:10:24] and when we ask the lord for things when
[1:10:26] we bless our meals we don't say in in
[1:10:29] the name of dennis katie or in the name
[1:10:32] of shelia truman or in the name of
[1:10:33] newton bennett we say it in the name of
[1:10:36] the lord jesus christ
[1:10:38] that takes that sword to the heart of
[1:10:41] that enemy because he cannot withstand
[1:10:44] that name amen the name of jesus christ
[1:10:48] when it said in faith believing amen now
[1:10:50] there's plenty of people that utter the
[1:10:53] name plenty of people that uttered in in
[1:10:55] vain
[1:10:56] and in cursing they utter that name but
[1:10:59] when it's said with faith from the heart
[1:11:01] of a believer
[1:11:03] it'll shake the very foundations of hell
[1:11:06] and take that sword to the heart of the
[1:11:08] enemy
[1:11:08] amen you've got to know what your sword
[1:11:10] is now okay so now where is my
[1:11:13] strengthening come from my strength
[1:11:15] coming from the lord where does my help
[1:11:17] come from my health coming from the lord
[1:11:19] but what is our sword our sword is the
[1:11:21] word amen
[1:11:23] how do we know how to be able to use our
[1:11:26] sword unless we know what it says yes
[1:11:29] we have to know what the word says we
[1:11:32] have to know every promise in this book
[1:11:34] is mine
[1:11:35] every promise that god promised me every
[1:11:38] story every chapter every line brother
[1:11:40] brandon even gone so far as to say every
[1:11:42] jot and tittle
[1:11:43] which basically just means exclamations
[1:11:46] and punctuation
[1:11:48] amen job title punctuation every
[1:11:50] exclamation point every comma every
[1:11:52] verily verily barely
[1:11:55] we know the word
[1:11:57] well that's the only way you're going to
[1:11:58] be able to take the word the sword to
[1:12:00] the heart of the enemy oh it sounds
[1:12:01] wonderful to think oh if i just take
[1:12:03] that sword in and we always think well
[1:12:05] that's some natural uh uh metaphor that
[1:12:08] we come up with no no no no it's the
[1:12:10] word
[1:12:11] the word is that sword that's what you
[1:12:14] take to the heart of the enemy the
[1:12:16] strength of your faith in that word to
[1:12:18] know how to take it to the heart of the
[1:12:20] enemy that was eve's problem in the
[1:12:22] beginning the woman's problem in the
[1:12:24] beginning
[1:12:25] eventually was as strong in the word as
[1:12:28] the devil was as the enemy was so he was
[1:12:32] able to deceive her
[1:12:34] you know there's many gonna fall by the
[1:12:35] wayside because they don't have a
[1:12:38] fundamental revelation of the word of
[1:12:40] god to be able to have that sword in
[1:12:42] their holster ready to take it to the
[1:12:44] heart of the enemy at any time there's
[1:12:46] people just don't have it
[1:12:48] she knew it she had heard it
[1:12:51] intellectually in her mind she knew what
[1:12:53] adam had told her
[1:12:55] god said don't do this
[1:12:58] but intellects won't take it to the
[1:13:00] heart of the enemy
[1:13:03] being able to memorize it does not take
[1:13:05] it to the heart of the enemy amen those
[1:13:07] things are fine
[1:13:09] you can memorize the scripture cover to
[1:13:11] cover that's fine
[1:13:12] but it takes the strength of the dueler
[1:13:16] to take it to the heart of the enemy
[1:13:17] amen amen the strength doesn't come from
[1:13:20] my intellect the strength doesn't come
[1:13:22] with how good i can remember something
[1:13:24] my strength comes from my position and
[1:13:26] my placement and my my faith in the lord
[1:13:29] jesus
[1:13:30] who i am who i am who am i in him that's
[1:13:33] what the strength comes from
[1:13:35] who am i
[1:13:37] i cannot
[1:13:39] let my heart deceive me i cannot let my
[1:13:43] heart condemn me
[1:13:45] as john said
[1:13:46] i cannot because if my heart condemns me
[1:13:49] i can't have victory over the enemy i
[1:13:51] can't have strength right i'm not going
[1:13:54] to be able to withstand when that enemy
[1:13:56] comes to bring whatever it is to me to
[1:13:58] my family to my life whatever it might
[1:14:00] be
[1:14:00] i won't be able to withstand it
[1:14:03] if my heart condemned me why because you
[1:14:04] don't have the faith that you need
[1:14:07] amen
[1:14:08] abraham was strong in the lord giving
[1:14:10] him praise and thanks even though it
[1:14:12] took 25 years for the promised son to
[1:14:14] come about he was strong in the lord
[1:14:17] in faith believing that the god that's
[1:14:20] done this and the god that did that the
[1:14:22] god that brought me through here and the
[1:14:24] god that saw us through here is the same
[1:14:25] god that's going to see me the rest of
[1:14:27] the way through
[1:14:28] strong in the lord no matter what the
[1:14:31] time frame is no matter how impossible
[1:14:33] it might look we're strong in the lord
[1:14:35] he stood strong in the lord now let's
[1:14:38] look at this scripture
[1:14:39] in first timothy chapter four
[1:14:50] first timothy chapter four
[1:14:53] we'll start with verse one here as well
[1:14:55] first timothy 4 1.
[1:15:00] now the spirit speaketh expressively i
[1:15:03] mean specifically
[1:15:05] to the point expressedly that in the
[1:15:08] latter times some shall depart from the
[1:15:11] faith
[1:15:13] giving heed to seducing spirits and
[1:15:16] doctrines of devils those are people
[1:15:18] that did not have the strength of the
[1:15:20] lord of the sword of the word to take to
[1:15:23] the heart of the enemy
[1:15:24] they became deceived by whatever wiles
[1:15:27] the enemy brought their path just like
[1:15:29] in the beginning just like even the
[1:15:31] beginning whatever the enemy would bring
[1:15:36] spirit of seducing and doctrines of
[1:15:39] devils
[1:15:42] speaking lies in hypocrisy
[1:15:45] having their conscience seared with a
[1:15:47] hot iron
[1:15:49] and the blind can't know it
[1:15:51] if you're blind to it you don't know
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:15:54] correct
[1:15:56] forbidding to marry listen to this now
[1:15:58] my this just don't speak of this last
[1:16:00] day see
[1:16:01] forbidden to marry
[1:16:03] and commanding to abstain from meats
[1:16:06] commanding that you abstain from meat
[1:16:10] my mind but look what the lord says
[1:16:13] abstain from me which god hath created
[1:16:16] to be received with thanksgiving of them
[1:16:19] which believe and know the truth
[1:16:22] for every creature of god is good and
[1:16:26] nothing can be refused if it be received
[1:16:29] with thanksgiving i see that's the
[1:16:31] problem people have
[1:16:33] that to me is the problem a lot of
[1:16:34] people have
[1:16:36] they don't have the faith to believe
[1:16:38] when they bow their head at the table
[1:16:39] that what they're about to consume is
[1:16:42] blessed and nourished to strengthen and
[1:16:45] bless our bodies
[1:16:46] they just don't have the faith
[1:16:48] it becomes a ritual
[1:16:52] meal time prayers become a ritual
[1:16:55] it becomes something that we just do
[1:16:57] because we're supposed to
[1:17:00] well that's just as much a stink in
[1:17:02] god's nostrils as in isaiah when they
[1:17:05] took their lambs and they went to go
[1:17:07] drag their lambs down and say i gotta go
[1:17:09] sacrifice today and no emotion no
[1:17:11] feeling no heart
[1:17:14] they just do it cause they got to do it
[1:17:15] it's a job
[1:17:17] it becomes a ritual
[1:17:19] it becomes a ritual to people and they
[1:17:21] don't believe
[1:17:22] saints we have to know when we bow our
[1:17:25] heads or when we approach the father
[1:17:26] when we speak to him
[1:17:28] in whatever capacity wherever we are for
[1:17:31] whatever reason he hears us and he
[1:17:34] answers our prayer amen
[1:17:36] strong in the lord yes
[1:17:39] strong in the lord
[1:17:42] if it be it is for it is sanctified by
[1:17:45] the word of god and
[1:17:47] prayer
[1:17:49] sanctified by the word of god and prayer
[1:17:52] praise the lord
[1:17:54] that's good i like that if thou put the
[1:17:57] brother in remembrance of these things
[1:17:59] thou shalt be a good minister of jesus
[1:18:02] christ nourished up in the words of
[1:18:03] faith and of good doctrine whereunto
[1:18:05] thou hast attained
[1:18:07] but refuse profane and old wives fables
[1:18:11] and extra listen to this now exercise
[1:18:14] thyself rather unto godliness there we
[1:18:18] go now
[1:18:19] exercise ourselves
[1:18:22] unto godliness now when we hear the word
[1:18:25] exercise we always think about lifting
[1:18:28] weights and pumping iron and running
[1:18:30] down the street and the exercise of
[1:18:32] jumping jacks and all this and all those
[1:18:34] things are fine that that's good there's
[1:18:36] nothing wrong with those things
[1:18:37] absolutely uh but it used to be men got
[1:18:41] it because they worked for a living now
[1:18:43] they build gyms everywhere which you can
[1:18:45] is okay because times have changed and
[1:18:47] those things change
[1:18:49] but but the point is
[1:18:52] that we are to as christians
[1:18:55] exercise ourselves rather to godliness
[1:19:01] amen not necessarily to a pumped up body
[1:19:04] being in shape is fine
[1:19:06] physically and
[1:19:07] absolutely i don't have anything against
[1:19:09] that uh but
[1:19:11] extras but the more important exercise
[1:19:14] that we have
[1:19:15] is to exercise ourselves unto godliness
[1:19:19] the practices that we practice the
[1:19:22] drills that we put ourselves through the
[1:19:25] things that we attain to in life
[1:19:28] again such as coming to church
[1:19:31] praying reading our bibles consecrating
[1:19:34] ourselves putting on a tape whatever it
[1:19:35] might be a message that exercises us
[1:19:39] unto godliness
[1:19:41] that doesn't build muscles in our body
[1:19:44] but it exercises us unto godliness yes
[1:19:48] amen because friend this that we're
[1:19:50] talking about it's a life
[1:19:54] this is a life lived
[1:19:58] it's not something that just happens
[1:20:00] today and then goes away tomorrow
[1:20:02] this is a life that is lived that we're
[1:20:04] supposed to do the only way to be strong
[1:20:07] in the lord
[1:20:08] is for a life for your life to be lived
[1:20:11] to exercise and to demonstrate and to
[1:20:14] show that uh uh that that that's a life
[1:20:17] of godliness
[1:20:19] not not humanity not me
[1:20:23] but of godliness see
[1:20:25] exercise rather unto godliness
[1:20:28] for bodily exercise profiteth little now
[1:20:33] it does profit
[1:20:35] just profits little but it still does
[1:20:38] profit or for a little while
[1:20:40] amen
[1:20:43] but godliness
[1:20:45] is profitable unto all things amen
[1:20:49] having promised of the life that that
[1:20:51] now is and of that which is to come that
[1:20:55] exercising of godliness this is a
[1:20:58] faithful saying worthy of all exception
[1:21:01] that exercise unto godliness so what is
[1:21:04] it that
[1:21:05] not negating the exercise brother adam
[1:21:07] even talked about uh of course he hunted
[1:21:10] all the time so he got all kinds of
[1:21:12] exercise walking up down mountains hilly
[1:21:14] hills valleys and i i've gone to sunset
[1:21:17] mountain over where brother banham uh
[1:21:19] probably would have been according to
[1:21:21] the map and the tapes and everything and
[1:21:24] oh my goodness just to get over there uh
[1:21:27] is quite a track
[1:21:29] but uh he got a lot of exercise but he
[1:21:32] talked about billy graham
[1:21:33] that billy graham was getting so tired
[1:21:35] he couldn't hardly preach his sermons
[1:21:37] and he went to the doctor doctor said
[1:21:39] well you're wasting away billy you got
[1:21:41] to do some exercise you got to exercise
[1:21:43] your body
[1:21:45] so there is a value to exercising your
[1:21:48] body but the po but the importance
[1:21:52] should be on the exercising of the
[1:21:54] godliness yes amen
[1:21:56] not just the body but the exercising of
[1:21:59] godliness making sure that your
[1:22:02] priorities are in the right place
[1:22:04] because that's how you become strong in
[1:22:07] the lord
[1:22:09] not just strong but strong in the lord
[1:22:12] exercising unto godliness and that
[1:22:14] godliness is a life
[1:22:16] yes
[1:22:18] you're not just godly in church
[1:22:20] you're not just godly in front of the
[1:22:22] people that matter you're not just godly
[1:22:24] in front of the pastor or those in the
[1:22:26] church
[1:22:27] your godliness is your life yes it's how
[1:22:30] you live it's who you are it's what you
[1:22:32] become yes that godliness is you in
[1:22:37] in in in flash form
[1:22:40] it it's sort of like a
[1:22:42] um
[1:22:43] and it's not just in coming to church
[1:22:46] right
[1:22:47] it's not just being a christian on
[1:22:49] sunday or wednesday or whatever it is
[1:22:52] it's not just being east or christmas
[1:22:55] it's sort of like
[1:22:56] it's sort of like learning a new
[1:22:58] language is anybody more do anybody here
[1:23:01] know more than one language
[1:23:03] i
[1:23:04] don't i think michael knows three or
[1:23:07] four
[1:23:08] or at least parts of them anyway
[1:23:11] but
[1:23:14] i don't
[1:23:16] i don't i know a few words of spanish i
[1:23:18] might know a word or two here and there
[1:23:19] of a different language or something i
[1:23:21] don't know
[1:23:22] uh i have never been proficient in
[1:23:24] another language i have set out
[1:23:28] to learn spanish
[1:23:30] especially living in tunisia and i
[1:23:32] should be able to speak spanish living
[1:23:34] in tucson although i think everybody
[1:23:36] that's in america should learn how to
[1:23:37] speak english that's my opinion but um
[1:23:41] but
[1:23:42] just as if i were to go to mexico and
[1:23:44] try to live there i think i should learn
[1:23:46] how to speak spanish right i just that's
[1:23:48] just i just if i go to france i think i
[1:23:50] should learn how to speak french
[1:23:53] i should not obligate those people to
[1:23:55] learn english so they can communicate
[1:23:56] with me i should learn how to speak
[1:23:58] french because i'm in their country
[1:24:00] anyway yes uh that's a soapbox
[1:24:03] so but it's like learning that language
[1:24:06] i've learned a fair amount of spanish
[1:24:09] from time to time
[1:24:11] but you you might
[1:24:13] learn some words you might learn some
[1:24:15] phrases you might learn uh
[1:24:18] the alphabet or something to that effect
[1:24:20] but friend if you don't use it
[1:24:24] if you don't if it doesn't become common
[1:24:26] to you
[1:24:27] to where it's something that you use
[1:24:29] regularly
[1:24:30] those things tend to go away
[1:24:33] they slip
[1:24:35] just hebrews 2 tells us not to let these
[1:24:38] things slip see those things will just
[1:24:40] slip if it doesn't become a life that's
[1:24:43] lived
[1:24:44] if it doesn't come something that we do
[1:24:47] on a daily basis to where it really
[1:24:49] becomes as we would say second nature
[1:24:52] although i would consider it to be first
[1:24:54] nature because it is our life
[1:24:57] but as the world term would say second
[1:25:00] nature second nature is like the bicycle
[1:25:02] writing
[1:25:04] they say once you learn how to ride a
[1:25:05] bike you never forget
[1:25:08] but
[1:25:10] there are
[1:25:11] things like that that go with uh
[1:25:14] learning how to ride a bike you can
[1:25:15] learn how to ride a bike never ride a
[1:25:17] bike 20 years later you still going to
[1:25:18] ride that bike
[1:25:20] well i know how to ride a bike but i
[1:25:21] rode a bike for
[1:25:23] the first 20 years of my life or 15
[1:25:25] years or whatever
[1:25:27] so i did it proficiently
[1:25:30] you understand it becomes life
[1:25:33] not just oh i come to church here and
[1:25:35] there uh i i i might come on easter i
[1:25:38] might come on christmas or you know uh
[1:25:41] well
[1:25:42] i i i might do a little this i might do
[1:25:45] but see if it's not a life live yes
[1:25:49] there's not going to be enough strength
[1:25:51] in the lord there to be able to
[1:25:53] withstand the walls of the devil yes
[1:25:56] it's just not going to be there
[1:25:58] when
[1:25:59] if i just learned a few words of spanish
[1:26:02] or let's just say i learned
[1:26:05] a few phrases
[1:26:07] and i go down to mexico or something and
[1:26:09] somebody's just talking and talking to
[1:26:10] the doctor but like i have no idea what
[1:26:12] you're talking about
[1:26:14] i i don't know what you're saying
[1:26:17] you know
[1:26:19] i i've gone to mexican restaurants
[1:26:21] before
[1:26:22] and
[1:26:23] and and say a little spanish phrase that
[1:26:25] i know and the waiter just starts
[1:26:27] gabbing and gavin and gavin i'm no way
[1:26:29] but that's all i know i don't know
[1:26:31] i
[1:26:32] i said here i told you every spanish i
[1:26:34] know that's it so i have no idea what
[1:26:37] you're talking about get myself in
[1:26:38] trouble but
[1:26:40] if you're not proficient enough at
[1:26:42] something see again it becomes life it
[1:26:45] becomes something that you should do
[1:26:47] exercise every day
[1:26:51] every day
[1:26:52] amen even if you even if you do physical
[1:26:56] exercise
[1:26:57] i've seen people and known people to get
[1:26:59] buffed and big
[1:27:00] and even kind of my brother my brother
[1:27:02] when he was a young kid um 16 17 he got
[1:27:06] really strong my brother got uh he
[1:27:08] worked out i mean he was religious about
[1:27:11] it he was faithful to it even in the old
[1:27:14] times where uh they had different kind
[1:27:16] of weights it was more of a challenge to
[1:27:19] actually start working out than what
[1:27:20] they've got today and just rubber bands
[1:27:22] and stuff
[1:27:23] you know or whatever they are but my
[1:27:26] brother he had things you had to strap
[1:27:27] your feet and all this stuff and but he
[1:27:30] got big he got strong but when he got
[1:27:32] later in life
[1:27:34] and he was sitting in a van driving for
[1:27:36] a living or in a truck driving for a
[1:27:38] living those muscles started going from
[1:27:41] up here to down here
[1:27:44] because he didn't exercise it
[1:27:47] didn't take care of it
[1:27:48] well that's what happens to our
[1:27:50] spiritual life we might be up here now
[1:27:51] for just a moment but then if we don't
[1:27:53] keep it as a part of our life yeah if it
[1:27:55] doesn't become a part of our godliness
[1:27:58] our godly living then our muscles go
[1:28:00] from here to here right amen or from
[1:28:02] here to here
[1:28:04] see it doesn't stay
[1:28:05] because it's not something that's going
[1:28:07] to hold it has to be a life
[1:28:09] that life is a faith that faith that
[1:28:12] cannot that that true unadulterated
[1:28:15] faith that cannot be mixed with anything
[1:28:17] else
[1:28:18] there could be no leaven in that faith
[1:28:20] there cannot be any doubt in your faith
[1:28:23] there can't be any reasoning in your
[1:28:25] faith
[1:28:27] abraham stood strong in the lord and god
[1:28:30] uttered him for it he stood strong in
[1:28:32] the lord and that's what we are to do
[1:28:34] god told
[1:28:35] god told joshua when he took moses off
[1:28:37] the scene
[1:28:39] he told josh he said be strong and of a
[1:28:42] good courage
[1:28:43] but why did he tell him that or what did
[1:28:45] he tell him after that
[1:28:47] be strong and of a good courage because
[1:28:50] i will be with you whether so ever thou
[1:28:54] goest
[1:28:55] praise the lord amen my friends what a
[1:28:58] what an encouragement for us to believe
[1:29:00] that the lord is with us to be strong in
[1:29:02] the lord to be stronger than to know he
[1:29:05] is with us
[1:29:07] he never leaves us or forsakes us he's
[1:29:09] always there with us
[1:29:10] amen
[1:29:12] praise the lord our faith can't be mixed
[1:29:14] with anything now first corinthians
[1:29:16] chapter 16.
[1:29:24] talking about that life lived let me as
[1:29:26] you're turning there to first
[1:29:27] corinthians 16. let me read this quote
[1:29:29] to you
[1:29:31] uncertain sound december 1960
[1:29:35] and yet the man
[1:29:37] somewhere down in him somewhere in him
[1:29:39] if he could only let that little
[1:29:42] he said as i illustrated it a little
[1:29:44] button
[1:29:45] you see a little button here
[1:29:47] just on my sleeve a little button when a
[1:29:50] man is saved that much of him is god
[1:29:53] that's the little light that comes in to
[1:29:56] make him quit doing what's wrong
[1:29:59] that little life holy spirit god that
[1:30:02] comes in there that keeps him and and
[1:30:04] causes him to stop doing the things that
[1:30:06] are wrong
[1:30:08] now if you can take all the malice and
[1:30:10] envy and strife and unbelieve out and
[1:30:12] let that little button of light and the
[1:30:15] power of god
[1:30:16] it will keep growing
[1:30:19] here we go now it'll keep growing
[1:30:22] growing
[1:30:23] growing
[1:30:25] growing
[1:30:26] crowding out all unbelief
[1:30:29] growing but see that's what it has to do
[1:30:32] it has to grow it has to grow it has to
[1:30:35] grow i don't take one lesson of spanish
[1:30:37] and be able to go to mexico and speak
[1:30:39] fluently to someone who's been their
[1:30:41] whole life i can't do that
[1:30:43] amen you don't take one lesson and all
[1:30:46] of a sudden you've got it you're there
[1:30:48] no there it takes a process you grow in
[1:30:50] the lord growing that little button that
[1:30:53] light growing so well i'm born again
[1:30:55] yeah but you've got to continue to grow
[1:30:57] in the lord you've got to continue to
[1:30:59] strengthen the lord you've got to
[1:31:00] continue to allow the spirit of god to
[1:31:03] strengthen you in that word
[1:31:06] amen in that word strengthen you in that
[1:31:09] word
[1:31:10] praise the lord that word and as it
[1:31:12] grows and it grows and it grows brother
[1:31:15] adam said it crowds out
[1:31:18] all the unbelief
[1:31:20] praise the lord well if you crowd out
[1:31:22] all the unbelief what's left faith am i
[1:31:26] faith in god
[1:31:27] your heart doesn't condemn you why
[1:31:29] because you're living a godly life yes
[1:31:32] a holy life you're living a life that's
[1:31:35] pleasing to the lord jesus
[1:31:37] that's what brings strength
[1:31:39] that when other things come then you're
[1:31:41] able to withstand them
[1:31:43] crowding out unbelief all all unbelief
[1:31:46] and you don't uh and you don't do it by
[1:31:49] exhortations of bodily exercise you do
[1:31:52] it by a sanctified
[1:31:55] consecrated life that the holy spirit
[1:31:58] moves through you
[1:32:00] i caught some of it in the places here
[1:32:02] where not long ago he said now that
[1:32:04] sanctified
[1:32:06] consecrated life
[1:32:08] there we go
[1:32:09] sanctified consecrated life with the
[1:32:12] holy spirit moving through you
[1:32:14] all unbelief crowded out nothing but a
[1:32:18] sword of the word and faith to drive it
[1:32:21] to the heart of the enemy
[1:32:22] a strong hand
[1:32:24] a strong hand of faith to drive that to
[1:32:26] the heart of the enemy strong in the
[1:32:28] lord joshua be strong and of a good
[1:32:31] courage abraham strong in the lord
[1:32:34] believing that what god said he would do
[1:32:37] because we're strong in the power of his
[1:32:39] mind
[1:32:40] not the power of my might
[1:32:42] my might will fail me first corinthians
[1:32:44] chapter 16 verse
[1:32:47] verse 13.
[1:32:51] look down watchy
[1:32:53] stand fast in the faith
[1:32:56] quit you
[1:32:57] like men
[1:32:59] be strong
[1:33:00] now that that sounds really strange but
[1:33:03] the word quick there just means to be
[1:33:05] brave yes
[1:33:07] be courageous and brave
[1:33:09] so watch ye
[1:33:11] stand fast in the faith
[1:33:15] and be brave courageous
[1:33:17] like men and be strong
[1:33:20] be strong courageous
[1:33:22] stand fast
[1:33:24] let the strength of the lord
[1:33:26] pulsate through you
[1:33:28] to take that word to the heart of the
[1:33:30] enemy
[1:33:32] let all your things be done with charity
[1:33:36] amen which we spoke of the scriptures
[1:33:38] here just a little bit earlier
[1:33:40] exercising our faith
[1:33:43] not staggering right not taking control
[1:33:45] of it of ourselves
[1:33:47] but believing that the strength the lord
[1:33:49] has given me now some people they think
[1:33:52] that they just
[1:33:54] that some comes and they just stand back
[1:33:56] and say okay lord you do it
[1:34:00] doesn't work that way you know
[1:34:02] you put on the whole armor of god
[1:34:05] when when the red part when this red sea
[1:34:07] was parted what did god say god told
[1:34:10] moses
[1:34:11] you get up on your feet and you speak
[1:34:14] hold that rod over so there was
[1:34:16] something moses had to do right there
[1:34:19] was a part moses had to play and that's
[1:34:22] the same in our lives we don't just sit
[1:34:24] back and say okay god you just take care
[1:34:26] of it right no there's a part we play
[1:34:29] right in that
[1:34:30] that we in our prayer life
[1:34:33] in our faith
[1:34:35] amen and putting a hand to it i mean
[1:34:38] brother pat can sit there on his seat
[1:34:40] there and he can say okay lord i want my
[1:34:43] 51 chevy put my 51 4 put together i'm
[1:34:46] waiting
[1:34:48] there's the tools tools are over
[1:34:50] parts are all just put it together for
[1:34:52] me lord
[1:34:53] no
[1:34:54] god knows how it goes together
[1:34:57] amen
[1:34:59] of course so does brother pat but he's
[1:35:01] had a lot of practice but
[1:35:03] god knows how to put it together the god
[1:35:06] has to take a man to put the wrench in
[1:35:08] his hand to put it to the bowl yes
[1:35:11] god has to have a man to take to put the
[1:35:13] sword in his hand and take it to the
[1:35:15] enemy
[1:35:16] god's got to take you
[1:35:19] and let you the strength of god to put
[1:35:21] that sword in your hand and you take it
[1:35:24] to the heart of the enemy yes you be the
[1:35:26] one to turn that bolt
[1:35:28] you be the one to grab that instrument
[1:35:30] or whatever it is and let god pulsate
[1:35:33] through you
[1:35:34] we get set here now could god make that
[1:35:36] piano play without anybody sitting there
[1:35:38] yes absolutely you've done it before
[1:35:40] that's very prominent story brother bam
[1:35:42] tells about uh the the girl singing the
[1:35:45] great physician now is dear she's
[1:35:47] singing and raising her hands and
[1:35:48] worshiping god when the spirit of god
[1:35:50] falls and that piano just keeps playing
[1:35:52] the great position now is near he could
[1:35:54] do it absolutely could do it he could
[1:35:58] put that forward together he could do it
[1:36:00] right but he uses us
[1:36:03] he gets an instrument
[1:36:05] and he takes that instrument and sets it
[1:36:07] there with the power of god and the
[1:36:08] knowledge in his fingers to play that
[1:36:10] piano
[1:36:11] amen to play that guitar
[1:36:13] to play jesus but stand up here and and
[1:36:16] preach to all of us
[1:36:18] it takes god bringing an instrument and
[1:36:21] through us
[1:36:23] that are strong of the lord to operate
[1:36:26] the purpose that god wants planned his
[1:36:28] plan to be done in this world in our
[1:36:30] lives
[1:36:31] it takes us to do it that's why
[1:36:34] we have to be strong in the lord to have
[1:36:36] faith because it's our hands it's our
[1:36:39] feet it's our minds it's our sight
[1:36:43] it's our abilities
[1:36:44] that god does it through we talked about
[1:36:46] last week god don't put anything more on
[1:36:48] what you can do
[1:36:50] god's not going to call you to do god's
[1:36:52] not going to call you
[1:36:54] let me just do this
[1:36:56] god's not going to ask you to get
[1:36:58] something off of an eight-foot shelf if
[1:37:00] you're three foot tall
[1:37:04] amen i've seen brother roger crawl
[1:37:07] through some very small attics and under
[1:37:09] some very small crawl spaces under
[1:37:11] houses
[1:37:12] and i ask him sometimes
[1:37:15] i'm smaller
[1:37:16] let me do it but sometimes it takes the
[1:37:19] master electrician to know what he's
[1:37:22] what he wants to do when he's up there
[1:37:24] but typically god is not going to call
[1:37:28] someone who's three foot tall to get
[1:37:30] something off a nine-foot shell
[1:37:33] amen he has a nine-foot guy to do that
[1:37:36] with
[1:37:38] praise the lord
[1:37:40] now that's a very simplistic way of
[1:37:42] putting it but god has each one of us
[1:37:44] that's why we're all different god has
[1:37:46] each one of us in our place for our
[1:37:48] purpose
[1:37:50] and all of the things i've talked about
[1:37:52] last week that he can use to bring about
[1:37:54] that purpose that he has but every one
[1:37:56] of us
[1:37:58] the common denominator and every one of
[1:38:00] us has to be we have to be strong in the
[1:38:02] lord
[1:38:04] amen strong in the lord not strong in
[1:38:07] myself
[1:38:08] not strong in my abilities what i can do
[1:38:13] but strong in the lord amen sure brother
[1:38:16] pat knows how to put that forward back
[1:38:17] together he's done it over and over and
[1:38:19] over again he knows exactly how to do it
[1:38:22] but how many times have you heard him
[1:38:23] testify of places he's gotten to lord
[1:38:26] help me here yes amen
[1:38:30] because we all need him
[1:38:33] we all need him
[1:38:34] and now all need him to be
[1:38:36] and continue to be but our the stronger
[1:38:39] the lord that's our part
[1:38:41] god's done his part the strong of the
[1:38:42] lord's my part amen i'm going to have to
[1:38:45] put on that whole armor
[1:38:49] one scripture i'm going to close psalms
[1:38:51] 18 29.
[1:38:55] psalms 18 29.
[1:38:58] says for by thee i have run through a
[1:39:00] truth
[1:39:02] and by my god have i leaked over a wall
[1:39:05] amen
[1:39:07] praise the lord
[1:39:09] could god
[1:39:11] use a three-foot purse to get something
[1:39:13] off a 9-foot shelf
[1:39:14] sure he could
[1:39:16] normally he doesn't
[1:39:18] but he could
[1:39:19] but i think we've understood the fact
[1:39:21] god can do whatever he wants right
[1:39:24] amen god could take a person with no
[1:39:27] fingers and play a piano or a guitar if
[1:39:29] he wants to
[1:39:30] because god can do whatever he wants
[1:39:32] it's up to him
[1:39:33] amen but typically in the operation of
[1:39:36] the lord and what god does for us he
[1:39:38] puts us in positions that he knows that
[1:39:41] we'll be able to do
