[23:33] don't sing this song very often because
[23:35] it's quite a difficult one to sing I
[23:37] tried to get out of singing this song
[23:39] but the Lord wouldn't let me and with
[23:42] Micah not here it makes it even uh a
[23:45] little more challenging because Micah
[23:48] knows the note that I sing I can
[23:50] basically I have such well I can't sing
[23:53] anyway but uh the my range is so limited
[23:58] that I have to start at a specific level
[24:01] uh to be able to hit the low and then
[24:03] the high parts uh so if I do mess up
[24:07] please forgive me try to start it over
[24:10] again but I want to sing this song it's
[24:13] everything that we could think is a song
[24:16] to glorify Jesus Christ amen uh this
[24:20] song to me embodies everything that
[24:23] Jesus is amen and U I've felt to sing it
[24:28] uh Christmas song people I don't know if

[24:34] message too so we're going to we're
[24:36] going to sing it amen I'm sure we all
[24:39] know it uh so we're gonna we're going to
[24:41] do our very best to try to sing this so

[34:26] stand to our feet if we could then we'll
[34:28] go right to the scripture Exodus chap
[34:32] 26 as I said this will be part six uh or
[34:37] part six part three uh the last part of
[34:41] uh going Beyond the
[34:43] Veil uh going Beyond the Veil we had had
[34:46] kind of did not plan it that way but it
[34:49] kind of turned out to where the last
[34:51] part of this was going to be really
[34:53] perfect for a Christmas message uh which
[34:56] is unusual I already kind of have a St
[34:57] my mind for the Christmas uh message uh
[35:01] that would have been last Sunday uh but
[35:03] it's going to be today so uh Lord
[35:06] willing uh this be a blessing to you
[35:09] today Exodus chapter 26 we're going to
[35:11] begin begin reading with verse
[35:14] 33 just read a couple of verses of
[35:16] scripture and uh draw our text on today
[35:19] and finish up this going Beyond the Veil
[35:22] if you remember the first two parts and
[35:25] uh going into those uh talking about
[35:28] that Veil and getting to this place this
[35:30] is the point this third part really is
[35:33] the part that was instrumental in the
[35:36] fall of uh of this little Series so uh
[35:39] trust and prayer be a blessing to you
[35:41] but for your be let's just bow our heads
[35:43] for another word of prayer if we could
[35:45] Lord Jesus father God we're so very
[35:47] thankful Lord Of Your Grace your mercy
[35:49] your blessings Lord thank you for being
[35:52] here today we know God that without you
[35:55] all of this would be in vain but Lord we
[35:57] we thank you Father that we are here God
[36:00] and we're able to turn back the pages of
[36:01] this holy RIT trusting you to speak to
[36:04] us from it once again today Lord we know
[36:07] that we can read the words on this on
[36:09] this bi in this Bible we know that we
[36:11] can speak on them Lord but it takes you
[36:13] to come and bring an anointing Lord it
[36:15] takes you to come and and reveal it to
[36:18] us Lord to show it to us to open it to
[36:20] us Lord that it be manifest as you
[36:23] manifest yourself to us God that we can
[36:25] see and hear what you'd have for us to
[36:27] know through this portion of your
[36:29] scripture today Lord let it be an
[36:32] encouragement let let it be a blessing
[36:34] let it be what every one of us God are
[36:36] Desiring needing and Lord have something
[36:39] as we walk out of this place today
[36:41] knowing that you spoke to us father God
[36:44] we are very grateful Lord if you
[36:46] bringing us through another year Lord
[36:49] we've had uh several UPS we've had many
[36:51] Downs Lord that's what life seems to be
[36:55] to most of us but Lord we know that in
[36:57] all the ups and downs God that you are
[37:00] always with us you promised to never
[37:02] leave us or forsake us Lord God and as
[37:05] my wife's one of my wife's favorite
[37:08] stories about the footprints of the
[37:10] sands of time when it got so dark and so
[37:13] Bleak and we only looked back and saw
[37:15] one set of footprints you could speak to
[37:18] us and say that's my footprints because
[37:21] I was carrying you oh God what a reality
[37:24] it is to us Lord not just a poem not
[37:26] just a story not just someone some
[37:29] something someone thought of it Lord
[37:30] It's a reality to us God and we thank
[37:34] you for it Lord through this past year
[37:36] and Lord if we make it to a new year
[37:38] which it looks like we will God but if
[37:40] we make it to a New Year may you just
[37:42] bless us in it may your hands be upon us
[37:44] and continue as we know you will and do
[37:47] God to fulfill your word and be with us
[37:50] Lord to never leave us or forsake us God
[37:53] we commit it to you Lord we are nothing
[37:55] in ourselves but all that we have we
[37:57] commit to you Lord we pray that you'd
[37:59] take this service into your complete
[38:01] control now take this vessel Lord in
[38:04] your complete control speak to us from
[38:06] these lips Lord anoint our ears to hear
[38:09] and reveal to us that that you'd have us
[38:11] to hear and say and know but we trust
[38:14] you in it God bless us father we commit
[38:17] ourselves to you we look forward God to
[38:19] what you're going to do continue to do
[38:21] for us not failing to recognize what you
[38:24] are doing and continuing to help us Lord
[38:27] we commit it to you Lord uh it's in your
[38:30] hands in your name the precious name of
[38:32] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we ask
[38:34] and pray these things
[38:37] amen Exodus
[38:40] 26:33 let's read this we'll let you be
[38:42] seated and thou shalt hang up the veil
[38:45] under the Tates that thou mayest bring
[38:47] in thither within the veil within the
[38:49] Veil The Ark of the testimony and the
[38:52] veil shall divide unto you between the
[38:54] holy place and the most holy and thou
[38:57] shalt Put The Mercy Seat upon the Ark of
[39:00] the testimony in the most holy Place
[39:04] amen you could be seated if you'd
[39:09] like as our subject has been and is
[39:12] today going Beyond the Veil amen we
[39:16] speak of the veil here we can recognize
[39:19] and not going into again all of the uh
[39:22] way that the Tabernacle in the
[39:23] wilderness was set up but we can
[39:25] recognize here that the the most holy
[39:28] place of the Tabernacle that was set up
[39:30] there a tabernacle of the Wilderness
[39:32] obviously you had the outside of the
[39:33] Tabernacle you had you had the the inner
[39:36] Court uh the outer court and the inner
[39:39] Court was the Holy place then you had
[39:40] the most holy place the most holy place
[39:43] was designated for the word in that most
[39:46] holy place behind that Veil amen which I
[39:50] want to get to again in just a minute
[39:53] because uh so if you'd like to we could
[39:55] turn over to numbers uh Numbers Chapter
[39:58] 4 in that most holy place we recognize
[40:01] that God had put the word the showbread
[40:04] which is a representation of the word
[40:06] and the shik glory was there in that
[40:09] most holy place behind that veil of
[40:13] badger skin which we'll read here in
[40:15] just a minute was the word and the
[40:18] spirit amen we know that that runs
[40:21] continuity all the way through the Bible
[40:23] as we've done kind of a study on that in
[40:25] the past of recognizing when Jesus said
[40:28] those that worship me must worship me in
[40:30] spirit and in truth we recognize that
[40:32] that's not just something that Jesus
[40:34] said that has been a precedent that has
[40:36] been set scripturally all through time
[40:38] as we know it as the as the worship of
[40:41] God has always been in spirit and in
[40:45] truth it has always been in spirit and
[40:48] in the word amen we read here that the
[40:50] Ark of the Covenant which contained the
[40:53] word of God was behind the veil in the
[40:56] most holy place in the place of the sh
[41:01] glory in the place where there was life
[41:04] amen where the life of God where where
[41:06] God came to to to meet with man at that
[41:09] time now let's go to Numbers Chapter
[41:15] 4 because Numbers Chapter 4 is
[41:17] instrumental in getting us to uh our
[41:20] main thought today amen of going behind
[41:23] that Veil going beyond that Veil amen
[41:27] numbers chap 4 verse 25 and
[41:31] 26 amen numbers
[41:33] 425 and
[41:35] 26 let's read that here and they shall
[41:38] bear the curtains of the Tabernacle and
[41:40] the curtains of the Tabernacle of the
[41:41] congregation his covering and the
[41:44] covering of the badger skins that is
[41:46] above it and hanging for the door of the
[41:49] Tabernacle of the congregation so we see
[41:51] the overlay these veils that that uh
[41:55] made the Tabernacle that made the outer
[41:58] court that made the inner court and into
[42:01] the holy place was those that were
[42:03] overlaid of badger skin he said above it
[42:06] hanging for the door the tabern
[42:08] Tabernacle of the congregation and the
[42:10] hangings of the court and the hangings
[42:13] of the door of the Gate of the Court
[42:14] which is by the Tabernacle and by the
[42:17] altar round about and their cords and
[42:19] all the instruments of their service and
[42:22] th all that is made for them so shall
[42:25] they serve now this bad skin was a very
[42:28] important part of what God was using in
[42:32] bringing Veil to the things that God was
[42:35] doing in this Tabernacle that very to
[42:38] get into the Tabernacle itself was to go
[42:41] past it to get into the holy place was
[42:44] to go past it to get into the most holy
[42:47] place was to get beyond the badger skin
[42:50] to get Beyond the Veil The Veil that God
[42:54] had set so that we have an that there
[42:56] was Entry Way amen now there was a time
[43:01] in this time that there was only those
[43:04] that God had that that God had given uh
[43:08] permission or allowance to go into that
[43:11] most holy place to go into that place
[43:14] where the shakana glory was to go into
[43:17] that place where the showbread was where
[43:20] the worship was of the spirit and Truth
[43:22] or the word and the spirit there was
[43:25] only that that God had consecrated Aaron
[43:28] and the priesthood consecrated to go
[43:31] into that most holy place there was the
[43:35] only ones that God allowed because if uh
[43:38] uh if someone non-concrete
[43:57] the priesthood went through before they
[43:59] could even get into that place it had to
[44:02] be specifically every Stitch of their
[44:06] garment God had
[44:08] orchestrated everything that they done
[44:10] every uh uh uh uh process that they went
[44:15] through and their washing and their
[44:17] clothing and everything that they had to
[44:20] do had to be P specifically as God had
[44:24] ordained it if it was anything out of
[44:27] place now listen to this now we know
[44:31] that we we we we have a message that a
[44:35] prophet brought that could drive a
[44:37] attack with a gun with a with a bullet
[44:40] from 50 yards I've never done that my
[44:43] life and I've hunted a lot in my life
[44:45] I've shot a lot of rifles and uh
[44:47] shotguns and such I've never driven a
[44:50] attack at 50 yards or Beyond amen maybe
[44:53] brother Tom Tommy Hunters now more than
[44:57] I've been maybe they've done it I've
[44:58] never done it but to understand that you
[45:02] hit a Target that
[45:04] big with a bullet that
[45:07] big from 50 yards is not a light thing
[45:11] to talk about it's it's not like anybody
[45:14] can do that amen but that's the
[45:17] Precision that it had to be and it
[45:20] echoed not just the Precision of that
[45:23] that just simply echoed the character of
[45:27] the man that God chose and the Precision
[45:30] that was used to bring this message to
[45:33] bring this word to a bride today it had
[45:36] to be perfectly exactly according to
[45:39] God's command it had to be perfectly
[45:42] exactly in line with every word of this
[45:45] Bible every as he said jot and TI every
[45:49] exclamation point every grammar every
[45:51] bit about it it had to be in perfect
[45:54] continuity amen so one just reflected
[45:57] the other well it was the same thing
[45:59] back here every Stitch what God
[46:02] specifically said of how it had to be
[46:05] made and what cloth or what material it
[46:08] had to be made of what the colors were
[46:13] how they were to present themselves and
[46:15] if there was one listen to this now if
[46:18] there was one stitch out of place and
[46:21] that man walked into that holy of holies
[46:24] he dropped dead
[46:27] one stitch you think about the Precision
[46:30] of the word yeah amen and people just
[46:33] lolly gag around with it and think well
[46:36] I'll just take this part not this part
[46:37] or I'll try to live this part but I
[46:39] can't live that part or you know I
[46:41] believe it but it just no one
[46:44] stitch if one word is off now we know
[46:47] that the scripture says you take one
[46:50] word away or add one word too we know
[46:52] what it says one word if one stitch was
[46:56] off
[46:57] and they went into that most holy place
[46:59] they dropped dead they they they tied a
[47:03] cord around them when they went into
[47:06] that most holy place they tied a CT
[47:08] around them so if one little thing was
[47:11] out of place and they dropped dead
[47:13] nobody else was going to go in behind
[47:14] that belt cuz they Dro dead too there
[47:17] would be a dead man if they try to go in
[47:19] there and get that man out they would
[47:21] drop dead as soon as they got in
[47:23] there so they W they they tied a quarter
[47:26] around him a rope around him so if he
[47:28] dropped dead and he fell dead something
[47:31] was out of place they pull him out with
[47:32] the Rope right cuz there wasn't anybody
[47:34] else going to go in there amen that's
[47:37] how perfect that's how Precision it had
[47:40] to be that's how perfect and how
[47:43] Precision this message had to be that's
[47:46] how perfect and precision it has to be
[47:49] in our lives this word has to be in our
[47:53] lives word upon word line upon line pre
[47:56] preep upon precept had to be that way
[47:59] has to be that way amen or it spells
[48:03] what death now you may not drop dead
[48:06] immediately naturally but the death
[48:09] today is the spiritual death for not
[48:13] going behind the veil now then it was
[48:16] death to go behind the veil anybody
[48:19] walked even even the ark even when David
[48:22] was trying to bring the ark back he was
[48:25] getting into the land of obeda
[48:27] and and the Ark tipped a little bit and
[48:29] a man in his
[48:31] righteousness of trying to protect the
[48:34] word in the ark put his hand on it and
[48:37] dropped
[48:38] dead because he wasn't allowed
[48:41] to this man and his Integrity his heart
[48:45] for the ark and for the word was there
[48:48] so much he wanted to keep it from
[48:50] falling over but he wasn't allowed to
[48:53] touch it and even in his righteous when
[48:57] he touched it he
[48:59] died amen if anybody went in behind that
[49:03] Veil that wasn't prepared that wasn't
[49:05] ready that wasn't in the position
[49:08] scripturally by God they dropped dead
[49:12] amen oh but what dwelt behind that Veil
[49:15] what was dwelling behind that Veil it
[49:18] was God God was behind that Veil that
[49:22] Shana Glory was behind that Veil there
[49:25] was life behind that Veil The Life Of
[49:29] God was in there and everything that God
[49:31] had orchestrated and told him to do
[49:33] brought that to pass to word God dwelt
[49:35] in that place amen it was an instrument
[49:38] that God used to be able to contact the
[49:41] people and God consecrated and set aside
[49:44] a priesthood to be able to uh uh to be
[49:48] in position to go behind that Veil to
[49:52] make intercession for the people amen
[49:55] and they had to follow every things line
[49:57] by line step by step everything had to
[50:00] be exactly
[50:01] perfect but there was such life behind
[50:04] that Veil there was such life let's
[50:07] let's go to a a let's stay we we'll stay
[50:10] in numbers but go over to the 17th
[50:18] chapter amen notice that most holy place
[50:24] was behind the badger skin
[50:27] that most holy place was behind the veil
[50:31] and what's the message to go Beyond the
[50:34] Veil well then they
[50:38] couldn't if they went behind the veil
[50:40] they dropped dead they could not go
[50:42] behind the veil it was death to go
[50:44] behind the veil amen but today we
[50:48] understand that if we don't go Beyond
[50:51] the Veil if we don't go behind that Veil
[50:54] it is death not to one once it was death
[50:57] to go behind the veil now it's death not
[50:59] to go behind the veil which we'll get to
[51:01] again a little bit later but look at the
[51:02] light behind this Numbers chapter 17
[51:06] let's read
[51:08] this uh let's start with verse six I was
[51:11] going to just read one verse of this but
[51:12] I want to read more of it but numb
[51:17] 176 and Moses spake unto the children of
[51:20] Israel and every one of their princes
[51:22] gave him a rod of gave him a rod a peace
[51:26] so listen
[51:27] Moses spake to the children of Israel
[51:30] every one of their princes gave him a
[51:32] rod a stick amen Joel likes to collect
[51:37] sticks when he goes out in the what we
[51:39] call Woods here we don't have woods and
[51:42] juus on uh not by my uh standard anyway
[51:47] uh but when he goes out a stick maybe a
[51:51] dried up Cactus or something but he
[51:52] likes to collect sticks every time he
[51:54] goes out and plays at our place he comes
[51:56] back with a hand full of sticks walking
[51:57] sticks they're all these sticks
[52:01] rods Moses asked all the
[52:05] princes uh to bring one according to
[52:08] their father's uh houses even 12 rods
[52:12] and the rod of Aaron was among the rods
[52:15] so you got five dead dried up sticks
[52:18] amen the ones that Joel brings to the
[52:21] house I have no idea what they are I
[52:24] don't know where they came from I don't
[52:26] know what kind of tree they fell off of
[52:29] vegetation I have no idea it's just a
[52:32] dried up old stick you can't maybe a
[52:35] professional botanist can figure it out
[52:37] I can't most people I don't imagine
[52:39] could it's just a dried up old Dead
[52:42] stick you got 12 of them 12 dried up old
[52:46] dead
[52:47] sticks Moses said bring them in Aaron is
[52:49] one of them what's he trying to find out
[52:52] he's trying to find out who is God's
[52:55] choice cuz he was a big
[52:56] there's a big Todo there's always always
[53:00] the pride always the arrogance always
[53:03] the me first always I'm the one uh God
[53:08] chose me I I I am the selected one
[53:11] everybody wants to be that thing there
[53:13] was a a big thing going on it was very
[53:17] well known and we know of course by the
[53:20] scripture Moses knew who God chose to
[53:24] stand in his uh in that place of
[53:27] priesthood he knew but he said let okay
[53:31] you all you all bring of your princes
[53:32] you bring all your rods 12 rods ands one
[53:35] of them these old dead sticks we're
[53:38] going to find out who God approves of
[53:40] and who he
[53:41] doesn't
[53:43] amen little little like the ear thund
[53:46] them kind I guess but it was the way
[53:48] that God that that Moses said we're
[53:50] going to find out bring them all in
[53:52] seventh verse Moses laid up the rods
[53:56] before the Lord in the Tabernacle of
[53:58] witness and it came to pass that on the
[54:01] tomorrow Moses went into the Tabernacle
[54:05] of witness and behold the rod of Aaron
[54:08] for the house of Levi was budded
[54:12] hallelujah praise the Lord Aaron's Rod
[54:16] was the one that
[54:17] budded and brought forth Buds and
[54:20] bloomed blossoms and yielded
[54:25] almonds praise God you want to talk
[54:28] about life a life that was there the
[54:32] life of God took an old DE dead dried up
[54:37] stick just like Joel brings home to our
[54:40] house an old dried up Dead stick and God
[54:44] gave it life and it budded Buds and it
[54:47] brought forth almonds you know what
[54:50] there's no questioning what Rod that
[54:54] came from right amen amen there's no
[54:57] questioning you don't have to you don't
[55:00] have to
[55:01] peradventure that this Rod came from an
[55:04] almond tree you know it came from an
[55:06] almond tree cuz when the life of God
[55:08] Struck it it produced almonds again
[55:11] praise the Lord if God can take an old
[55:14] dried up Dusty dry brittly old stick and
[55:18] bring it life what can he do for
[55:21] us amen they're all crusty dried up
[55:24] prickly cells
[55:27] God can bring life to that thing he can
[55:29] bring life to us and it can produce
[55:31] fruit praise God what's that fruit show
[55:34] that you belong to not an almond tree
[55:37] but you belong to the family of God
[55:39] that's because that's the kind of fruit
[55:40] you produce amen that's the fruit that
[55:43] comes out of these old dried up beans is
[55:45] the fruit of God and it shows to the
[55:48] world it shows to the world that's a
[55:51] Christian that's a man of God that's a
[55:53] sister that's a daughter of God they're
[55:55] producing ing the fruit of God Amen how
[55:59] shall men know who the son of man am
[56:03] amen how should they know us amen how do
[56:08] we know a tree that's out in in the
[56:11] world a bush a
[56:13] plant amen am it brings forth life when
[56:18] you bring forth life there's no question
[56:21] the question the question's over because
[56:24] it brings forth the life of God
[56:26] if it brings forth the life of God then
[56:28] it's God showing himself through you
[56:31] budding himself out through you but
[56:33] that's the life that was behind in this
[56:35] shik Glory the life of God took an old
[56:37] Dead stick and brought it to life then
[56:39] there was no question who God's choice
[56:41] was because all the other rods just
[56:43] stayed dead rotten
[56:45] sticks
[56:47] amen but God's choice God's decision
[56:51] Aaron's rod budded and brought forth
[56:54] alond amen that showed the the per the
[56:58] Perfection of God
[57:01] in veiled in that Shak of Glory veiled
[57:05] in that holies of holies amen this man
[57:09] that God chose was a man that could go
[57:11] in there had to be perfect exactly right
[57:14] according to the scripture go in behind
[57:16] that Veil amen and that's where God met
[57:20] with him on behalf of the people that's
[57:23] why that's why that priesthood was there
[57:26] that was the whole point to go behind
[57:29] the veil to stand in the Gap to be there
[57:32] as as a as a gap between between God and
[57:36] the people amen God made that way it was
[57:40] God's choice it was God's decision God
[57:42] made that uh uh decision amen God also
[57:46] made another decision God made a
[57:49] decision to send his only begotten son
[57:51] into this world his only begotten son
[57:54] amen now I hear a lot of times people
[57:58] say God's only son I I understand what
[58:02] they're saying but we got to understand
[58:05] that Jesus was his only begotten son I'm
[58:09] a Son of
[58:10] God but I didn't come into the world to
[58:13] save the world from their sins I didn't
[58:15] come into the world to save be men's
[58:18] Souls but the only begotten son Jesus
[58:21] Christ did that was God's choice God
[58:24] made that choice to send his only only
[58:26] begotten son who the word veiled in
[58:30] flesh the word veiled in flesh to the
[58:33] point the world could not see it his own
[58:35] people didn't know it they were blinded
[58:38] to
[58:39] it amen they were blinded they didn't
[58:43] see who he was to his like the song says
[58:46] to his own a
[58:48] stranger is it this the son of Joseph
[58:51] and Mary isn't this the a carpenter
[58:55] isn't this this whatever excuses they
[58:58] wanted to
[58:59] make but he was almighty God veiled in
[59:03] Bader skin veiled in flesh prophesied to
[59:09] be so
[59:12] Isaiah Isaiah chapter 9 verse
[59:17] 6 For unto us a child is
[59:21] born unto us a son is given praise God
[59:27] best gift I ever got amen best gift I
[59:31] ever got wasn't on Christmas either amen
[59:35] but it's the best gift I ever got a son
[59:38] is given and the government shall be
[59:40] upon his shoulders and his name Shall be
[59:43] Called
[59:44] wonderful counselor the Mighty God Amen
[59:49] let's see trinitarians try to do away
[59:51] with that one amen Jesus Christ is the
[59:56] Mighty God Amen I I read one time I
[59:59] can't remember if brother brandom said
[1:00:01] it or where I heard it but brother the
[1:00:04] Billy Graham made a proclamation of that
[1:00:07] when he was preaching one time and said
[1:00:10] Jesus Christ is the Mighty
[1:00:13] God and they and and there was people
[1:00:16] came against him hard for that and you
[1:00:19] know what is you know what his uh uh
[1:00:23] answer was that's what the scripture
[1:00:27] says amen that's right that's what the
[1:00:31] scripture says you can try to tear them
[1:00:33] into three pieces all you want but
[1:00:35] that's what the Bible says amen he is
[1:00:38] the Mighty
[1:00:40] God he's the Everlasting father now wait
[1:00:43] a minute I thought he was the son of
[1:00:46] God
[1:00:48] Amen the Everlasting fathers the Prince
[1:00:51] of Peace Jesus Christ come people didn't
[1:00:55] recognize it me and the family went over
[1:00:58] to Winter Haven would you do a lot of
[1:00:59] times go look at the lights Pretty
[1:01:01] Lights beautiful lights amen gets it
[1:01:05] gets more worldly all the time but it
[1:01:07] pretty lights uh twinkling glowing you
[1:01:13] know pretty light you see every once in
[1:01:15] a while every once in a while you see a
[1:01:18] nativity scene too not very often
[1:01:21] anymore but every once in a while me and
[1:01:23] Joel got to the place we were kind of
[1:01:24] looking this one no this one Happ no
[1:01:27] this one have
[1:01:28] no he saw more than I did some of them
[1:01:31] were little and he saw very few there
[1:01:33] was some there was some there that were
[1:01:35] promoting Jesus there was people in the
[1:01:37] street singing Christian songs which
[1:01:39] with crosses lit up which I like very
[1:01:41] much but um but you saw very very little
[1:01:44] of that anymore and the ones you saw
[1:01:46] most of them most of the nativities are
[1:01:48] wrong anyway because they had the mai
[1:01:50] coming to Jesus in a manger bringing
[1:01:53] gifts and we know we' proved that
[1:01:54] scripturally to be wrong
[1:01:56] they couldn't have wise men uh the uh
[1:01:59] Shepherds but not the wise men not with
[1:02:01] the gifts now had the gifts coming in
[1:02:04] laying at Jesus feet so even a lot of
[1:02:06] times the nativities are wrong amen but
[1:02:09] you see that worldly expression that
[1:02:11] people have it's become it it's become
[1:02:14] that because that's what it bred out of
[1:02:16] Christmas bred out of paganism and
[1:02:18] that's what it's come to amen I we
[1:02:21] celebrate Jesus birth and uh I I kind of
[1:02:24] liken it to my wife we celebrate my
[1:02:26] wife's birthday on J on July 10th we
[1:02:29] have no idea when she was born but we
[1:02:31] celebrate on July 10th amen I'm not sure
[1:02:34] when Jesus was born brother random told
[1:02:36] us in the springtime amen where all
[1:02:38] Lambs come forth I believe that amen I
[1:02:41] believe that to be the truth makes uh
[1:02:44] well I don't like to say the word sense
[1:02:45] but it makes sense if you look at it a
[1:02:48] lamb is to come forth is supposed to
[1:02:50] come forth uh uh in the springtime and
[1:02:54] that makes sense but exactly what what
[1:02:56] day what month we don't know absolutely
[1:02:57] for sure but we celebrate because we're
[1:03:00] thankful that he was born because if he
[1:03:02] hadn't been born he couldn't live if he
[1:03:04] hadn't lived he couldn't have died if he
[1:03:06] hadn't have died he couldn't have come
[1:03:07] back and if he hadn't come back I
[1:03:09] wouldn't have him living in me amen amen
[1:03:13] I'd be a man most miserable still today
[1:03:17] if I didn't have Jesus Christ Living in
[1:03:19] me amen so praise the Lord for that
[1:03:22] we're thankful in flesh Jesus Jesus the
[1:03:25] word in flesh Jesus was that Veil Jesus
[1:03:30] was that that that body was the badger
[1:03:33] skin that was that was hiding the
[1:03:36] shakana glory that was blocking that was
[1:03:39] holding people from seeing holding eyes
[1:03:42] people are seeing that that was God
[1:03:45] there a baby laying in a
[1:03:48] man a
[1:03:50] boy Carpenter
[1:03:53] wood a boy telling his mother I must be
[1:03:57] about my father's business and that
[1:03:59] wasn't building houses that wasn't
[1:04:01] building Furniture wasn't carpentry work
[1:04:04] amen because he knew who he was praise
[1:04:07] the Lord when the devil tried to come
[1:04:09] and tempt him he knew exactly who he was
[1:04:11] he told the devil who he was devil knew
[1:04:13] who he was amen but he had he told him
[1:04:15] anyway he knows who you are but he still
[1:04:18] tries to tempt you he still tries to try
[1:04:21] you he still tries to overthrow you
[1:04:23] every single chance he gives he sends
[1:04:25] every little menion and he can possibly
[1:04:26] muster up to try to get to go your way
[1:04:29] again no matter how bad they've been
[1:04:30] beat up no matter how much they've been
[1:04:32] defeated no matter how hard they've been
[1:04:35] uh uh put down in ridicule they still
[1:04:37] keep coming but you know what he still a
[1:04:40] loser that's right he's still going to
[1:04:42] go away from me defeated he's still
[1:04:44] going to go away from us beaten and
[1:04:46] scorned amen because through Christ
[1:04:49] we're already made Victorious that's
[1:04:51] right Jesus Christ healed the word Jesus
[1:04:54] Christ healed God he was the badger skin
[1:04:58] amen the badger skin that hid Jesus
[1:05:00] Christ let's go over to Matthew chap
[1:05:08] 27 the badger skin that hid Jesus
[1:05:11] Matthew chapter
[1:05:13] 27 the badger skin that hid skin that
[1:05:16] hid the
[1:05:19] word let me read you this quote before
[1:05:23] we go uh into Matthew 26 and read there
[1:05:26] let me read this quote to you in the
[1:05:28] Hebrew series 1957 brother bam said the
[1:05:33] veil is the
[1:05:35] flesh the veil is what keeps us from
[1:05:39] seeing God face to face in this
[1:05:42] church
[1:05:44] amen I didn't print it you know brother
[1:05:47] random said if this veil of Flesh were
[1:05:48] to drop off right now you'd see God
[1:05:50] standing before
[1:05:52] you amen why because he knew who he was
[1:05:57] amen now do we know who we
[1:06:01] are if the veil of this flesh were to
[1:06:04] drop off who is
[1:06:07] there amen if Newton Bennett's dead it
[1:06:11] sure can't be him because that's only
[1:06:15] thing I have to identify this flesh is
[1:06:17] Newton Bennett if this fell of Flesh
[1:06:19] were to drop off who would be here if he
[1:06:22] were to drop off who would you see
[1:06:26] amen that's why we must go Beyond the
[1:06:28] Veil sort of like we said on our last
[1:06:31] part two we were talking about it go
[1:06:34] beyond that Veil go beyond that
[1:06:36] flesh let let God help us to see one
[1:06:40] another the way he sees us because God
[1:06:43] doesn't see this nasty thing
[1:06:47] amen we must look beyond that Veil we
[1:06:50] must look beyond that flesh look the
[1:06:54] veil is the FL the veil is what keeps us
[1:06:57] from seeing God face to face in this
[1:06:59] church the veil is what keeps us from
[1:07:01] seeing the Angels at their positions
[1:07:04] this morning like we talked about with
[1:07:05] Elisha and Gazza amen the Angels the
[1:07:08] camp the the Chariots of Fire all around
[1:07:10] there's more with us they're all with
[1:07:12] them we went through that last I think
[1:07:13] it was last time in their position
[1:07:16] standing by the seats standing by the
[1:07:18] seats amen he's talking about the seats
[1:07:20] in the church there at that time there
[1:07:23] is in Jeffersonville standing by the
[1:07:25] seats the angels of God their position
[1:07:27] the veil is what keeps us from seeing
[1:07:31] him we are hid behind the veil and that
[1:07:34] Veil is the flesh we are Sons and
[1:07:37] Daughters of God we're in the presence
[1:07:39] of God the angels of God are encamped
[1:07:41] about those who fear Him we're in the
[1:07:44] presence of God all the time I'll never
[1:07:48] leave thee neither will I ever forsake
[1:07:51] thee I'll be with thee always even to
[1:07:54] the end but the Veil is the flesh that's
[1:07:57] what keeps us out of his presence amen
[1:08:01] or seeing him face to face if you will
[1:08:05] now look Matthew chapter
[1:08:10] 27 I won't be too much longer Matthew
[1:08:14] 27:1
[1:08:16] 15 Jesus when he had cried again with a
[1:08:20] loud voice yielded up The Ghost and
[1:08:23] behold the veil of the Temple
[1:08:26] praise the Lord amen the veil of the
[1:08:30] temple was rent in Twain From the top to
[1:08:34] the bottom and the Earth did quake and
[1:08:35] the Rocks did ran the veil of the temple
[1:08:40] remember it was death to go behind that
[1:08:43] Veil one time but now it's death not to
[1:08:47] the veil of the temple was rent in Twain
[1:08:51] and brought into PL view God almighty
[1:08:55] so we could be able to have entrance
[1:08:58] into that place into that shagana Glory
[1:09:01] into that holies of holies we now have
[1:09:04] permission we now have ability we now
[1:09:08] have God to be able to go in behind that
[1:09:11] Veil and unless we go behind that Veil
[1:09:14] today it's
[1:09:16] death praise the Lord today the world
[1:09:19] thinks they have
[1:09:21] life the life that's a simulation of
[1:09:25] God's life has been perverted to death
[1:09:31] so death is groping the world today we
[1:09:34] know control over multitudes
[1:09:37] unfortunately of people multitudes and
[1:09:39] God help me I got to be honest
[1:09:42] things I go to places with lots of
[1:09:44] people airport pray for me if you would
[1:09:48] please
[1:09:49] airport like the
[1:09:51] lights places that have a lot of people
[1:09:54] restaurant or something
[1:09:56] I feel sometimes like I'm getting more
[1:09:59] cynical and Lord help me I fight it
[1:10:02] don't want to be that way sin is
[1:10:05] becoming so prevalent sin has be got
[1:10:08] such a hold of people I was setting I I
[1:10:11] got to be honest with you I was setting
[1:10:14] not that I'd lie to you but uh full
[1:10:17] disclosure I I believe it was in the
[1:10:19] airport the other
[1:10:22] day and especially especially when
[1:10:25] children come by when I see children
[1:10:28] come by Joel and him his
[1:10:30] age or even
[1:10:35] Ruth and I see
[1:10:37] parents
[1:10:39] that they're pierc everywhere they're
[1:10:41] tattooed everywhere they're smoking or
[1:10:44] whatever it
[1:10:46] is hair is combed over and cut off this
[1:10:49] side I'm trying to say this without
[1:10:51] being cynical now or or
[1:10:55] men with buns
[1:10:59] or and I see the children I think what
[1:11:02] chance does that child
[1:11:04] have with an influence like
[1:11:07] that what is that child going to become
[1:11:11] brother random talks about the flappers
[1:11:13] daughter becoming a strip teas becoming
[1:11:15] a so on and so forth what is that what
[1:11:18] chance is that poor child I literally I
[1:11:21] I got full disclosure I believe it's an
[1:11:23] airport i s in airport the other day day
[1:11:26] and I just started crying I could not
[1:11:28] control
[1:11:29] myself uh fortunately uh the guy that
[1:11:33] lives in town that works with me on my
[1:11:35] team he usually Chatters all the time he
[1:11:37] was quiet he wasn't saying anything
[1:11:40] because I couldn't have answered
[1:11:42] it and it just came over my heart it
[1:11:44] just it it it gried me so the sin of
[1:11:47] this world and people are just going to
[1:11:49] Hell by the
[1:11:51] millions and it's hard to watch
[1:11:55] it's hard to be in this place and see
[1:11:57] that going on and not feel something tug
[1:12:00] at your
[1:12:01] heart and make you feel God if it was
[1:12:03] just something I could
[1:12:07] do and if it could be done he would have
[1:12:09] done it because he's done all he can
[1:12:12] do it comes our
[1:12:14] choice it becomes our decision that we
[1:12:19] make are we going to follow him are we
[1:12:21] going to follow the world are we going
[1:12:23] to pattern ourselves after the world
[1:12:25] people talk about not doing this not
[1:12:27] doing that you know the number one thing
[1:12:29] I look at the brother random actually
[1:12:30] gave instruction to said do not pattern
[1:12:32] yourself after the
[1:12:35] world Amen that's some of the that's one
[1:12:38] of the best Pops I think I've I've read
[1:12:40] as far as life living amen don't pattern
[1:12:45] yourself after the world the world trend
[1:12:47] is this don't pattern yourself after
[1:12:49] that amen my wife can tell you my my my
[1:12:53] children can tell you I'm probably the
[1:12:54] first person from that I've never been a
[1:12:57] fad person I've never been someone to
[1:13:00] follow along if somebody's wearing a
[1:13:01] certain Jean or a shirt have whatever
[1:13:05] the ponytailer I've never been somebody
[1:13:08] to follow follow fads uh I've never
[1:13:11] cared about it it it's just I'm just me
[1:13:16] and that's all I know to tell people
[1:13:17] it's just me but it come on my heart so
[1:13:20] strong the other day I couldn't do
[1:13:22] anything but Cry tears just started come
[1:13:25] out of my eyes I can I couldn't stop it
[1:13:28] eventually obviously I was but I try my
[1:13:32] I try not to get to the place that I'm
[1:13:35] that it becomes so cynical because it's
[1:13:38] it's hard to see people so
[1:13:42] lost so
[1:13:44] lost but it's it's understandable to
[1:13:47] know that if it weren't for the grace of
[1:13:48] God in my life I'd be as lost as
[1:13:51] them if not for God's grace there go I
[1:13:55] I don't want to get
[1:13:57] self-righteous or condenscending or
[1:14:00] think I'm better or more important
[1:14:01] because I'm
[1:14:02] not amen I'm just his
[1:14:06] son and I just want to live to the
[1:14:10] position that he's called for me to live
[1:14:14] and that's all I know when I die that'll

[1:14:39] Veil amen into that sh of Glory into
[1:14:43] that holies of holies into that most

[1:15:04] went into the holy city and appeared
[1:15:06] unto many praise the Lord because the
[1:15:09] veil was torn into two providing full
[1:15:14] access providing full access to God it
[1:15:19] was death to go behind the veil now it's
[1:15:22] death not to go behind the veil it was
[1:15:24] death to not to go beyond it and ask
[1:15:27] death not to go beyond it amen you know
[1:15:31] when brother Ram tells a story when his
[1:15:35] wife hope died his uh U first wife when
[1:15:40] she died I've been to the
[1:15:42] Grave I've been i' I've I've stood next
[1:15:45] to the stump that's a stump now the tree
[1:15:47] he talks about and he stood there as
[1:15:51] they lowered her body down into that
[1:15:54] grave
[1:15:55] and as he stood there and watched them
[1:15:57] lower that body into that grave she came
[1:15:59] up beside him and put her arm in his oh
[1:16:02] hallelujah amen did you
[1:16:05] imagine put her arm in his God allowed
[1:16:09] him to go at that moment Beyond the Veil
[1:16:12] to see her there to recognize her there
[1:16:16] and her presence there as they and
[1:16:18] she I I guess you would say in that
[1:16:22] other dimension stood there with him and
[1:16:24] watched him lower that body into that
[1:16:26] hole amen beyond that Veil they were
[1:16:31] able to go she he was able to go beyond
[1:16:35] that Veil to see that it still tormented
[1:16:38] him obviously as he tells many times but
[1:16:42] being able to go beyond that helped him
[1:16:44] get to that place oh you know how many
[1:16:47] times he talks about our loved ones
[1:16:49] being with us and if
[1:16:52] if well like Elisha told Gaza like told
