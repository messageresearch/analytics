our hearts today request let's stand if we could ask brother take these to Lord Jesus we bow our hearts and heads and innocent of the faith knowing that we stand here by your grace father and Lord I just heard your Prophet earlier this week that the devil is fighting us harder than ever and that we got to fight for every inch of ground that we gain yes amen father the the thing that we need to Realize by Revelation it's not our fight it's your fight yes it's not our battle it's your battle yes you have to fight our battles you have to take complete preeminence in our hearts in our lives at all times father it's when we try to do it ourselves we'll fail you there's some that might even be present this morning or on the streaming that say well I'm a lot better than what I was and uh you know I'm trying to serve the Lord that's where we make our mistake we're trying to do it yes that's why Paul said I Die daily amen and your Prophet says my greatest enemy is William Bram our greatest enemy is ourselves father you need to come in and get ourselves out of the way it's your Holy Spirit may work through US Lord It's a time where we know the hour is short the the race is almost ready to be complete we can see the Finish Line father and so we don't want to compromise in our walk with you in any way amen we don't want to just be standing before you didn't I do this for you Lord didn't I speak in tongues didn't I help the poor and you look at us and say depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you oh Lord that's sober we're here to live for you to do your will and

greater sacrifice the greater the blessings that you are a rewarder of them that diligently seek you yes Jesus and father we don't put forth that effort to show you that we want you preeminent first in our lives you won't be there father you won't take control Lord I can recall that brother Brown said Eskimos walked 30 mi in snowshoes to get to a service yes and the Mexicans one time in Mexico when your Prophet was having a Revival sat in the rain cathes holding on to rosaries sat in the rain Lord for two or three hours waiting for the service to begin because they saw Jesus Christ alive

thank you Lord thank God for that first John chapter 1 we'll begin reading with verse 5 first John 15 praise the Lord amen first John before we read let's just bow our heads for another word PR good precious Lord Jesus so father we are so very thankful again Lord of your grace and mercy Lord for a time to come again out of the world and Lord to come into this place and separate ourselves from everything out there around us and all the things that we go through every day Lord just to have a little bit of time God in this place today that's consecrated dedicated Lord for you father to worship you to praise you to glorify and magnify and exalt you Jesus Lord expect you God to meet with us here in a special Supernatural way for you to flow through this place and to do the exceeding abundantly above all that we could ever ask or than touching every heart touching every life healing every sick body meeting every need God and speaking to us from your word yes drawing us closer to you lord lord making us more like you helping revealing your word to our hearts and showing in here where we should be God lord if we can't find ourselves in every letter written in this scripture God we need to go back and read it again yes for Lord It's You and Your Love Letter to us speaking to us father Lord helping us realize that we are that word as you are are that word we become that word yes the great invisible Union taking place God that God and man come together once again oh thank you Lord for the intimacy of the relationship that we have with you Jesus Christ standing upon your word and believing God that you continue to strengthen and Lord see us through every adversity of life we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done so Lord now again Lord as we say so many times accomplish in this service now and with us that that you had set it forth for God those that are here those who may be watching those who may be watch who watch it later Lord whatever it may be God let it be across uh this platform Lord that God what you would accomplish in each one of us through eternity what you'd sent it for today we just give you thanks honor and glory for it and ask your blessings upon it now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen first John 1 we'll begin reading with verse 5 first John uh 1 John 15 this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sin he is faithful and just forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sined we make him a liar and his word is not in US amen you could be seated if you'd like I'd like to go back to that seventh verse especially but the entire reading that we have here amen God is light in him is no Darkness at all if there's no darkness in him and we claim to be one of his then there's no darkness in US amen amen what is that darkness that darkness is unbelief yes what is unbelief unbelief is sin amen praise the Lord so if we walk walk in sin and we say we belong to God uh our lives are going to need to change because we're making him out to be a liar actually the Bible says we're lying amen uh but if we walk in the light as he is in the light hear that seventh verse If he if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all Sin from all unbelief from all Darkness amen if we walk in that light that blood has cleansed us from all unrighteousness that blood has cleansed us from all sin and brought us in relationship brought us in Union brought us together with God so that God and man become one again amen amen praise the lord we were Bound in sin and the blood of Jesus Christ loosed us from that sin the blood of Jesus Christ and the light of God cleanses us and frees us from the bondage of sin from the bondage of unbelief and brings us in God's presence so that we can have again Fellowship amen with God uh maybe not exactly like uh that Adam had it in the Garden of Eden but as close as it's going to get with man on this Earth amen as man and God in Fellowship once again we just had uh the nation at a at a birthday uh a Fourth of July a day of what we call a freedom day we call a Independence Day a day that this nation declared its independence and freedom from bondage amen bondage of man bondage of rulership bondage of religion bondage of uh of Freedom that they that they so desired to want to have amen and that's why man regardless of what people want to say today regardless of everything they try to get rid of as far as this country is concerned this country was founded on biblical principles this this nation was founded on the freedom of religion to Worship the Lord Jesus in the way that we desire to Worship the Lord not based on what somebody dictates to us but the freedom of our hearts the freedom of our of our soul to be able to express to God how we feel and and how we want to worship and there's so many nations in the world today you cannot do that Amen in fact there's many nations in this world that will imprison you if you try to do that they will put you in jail they will put you to death if you have a Bible or if you try to have church or if you try to serve the Lord Jesus now they'll let you do it under their system amen they'll let you come under their system and worship God under their system but not in the freedom and liberty that the Lord Jesus gave us died and bled and gave us to be able to have the freedom to do it in the capacity that our heart demands us to do it not based on some religion not based on some denomination not based on some Creed or some Nation saying well if you're going to do it you got to do it the way we say to do it no he gave it to us in the way that from the dictates of our hearts we want to serve the Lord that's the freedom that men and women died for this country so that we can have the freedom to do that that's the reason that Jesus Christ went to Calvary and died so that we would be able to have that freedom today amen and now we have that freedom because the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed us from all sin now the bondage of sin that Satan tried to bring man under in the Garden of Eden which he was very uh uh uh uh uh able to do which he accomplished quite uh uh uh quite outstandingly if you will he was able to bring this world under the bondage of sin but Jesus Christ Loos that bondage amen Jesus Christ died shed his blood to loose that bondage to bring us into a freedom now what why why would God go through that to bring us to a place of Freedom if we're not going to exercise that freedom in serving him if we're not going to exercise that freedom in worshiping him and living for him why would he do that amen he only did it for those who would he only went there for those who would serve him for those who would worship him for those who would live according to the holy spirit in your life by the by the freedom that God has given us in his word people think we're in bondage Saints you know that there's a lot of people out in the world today think that think that we uh in this message our beliefs our feelings our our our understanding revelation of the scripture puts us in bondage friend but I say that we are more free people than there are on the planet today are those that serve the Lord Jesus in the dictates of their heart by the scripture amen amen praise the Lord oh if they could just only get a taste of it they could understand yes if they just get a glimpse of it they can see why we live the way we live but it comes by Revelation it comes by God revealing it let's go to St John in uh St John chapter 8 as Jesus is talking to a group of these amen Jesus is speaking to a group of them now St John chapter 8 St John chapter 8 we'll start with verse 30 St John 8:30 as he spake these words many believed on him then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if ye continue listen to what Jesus tells them now if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed if you continue in my word what is that walking in the light yes the word is the light Christ is the light if you continue in my word if you continue in the light if you continue living by the dictates of uh of God Amen through his only begotten son who was standing right there talking to them then you are then are you my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen who is the truth Jesus is the truth right amen the truth's not a statement the truth's not a word uh the truth is a person the truth is Jesus Christ he himself said I am the way the truth and the LI right amen no man can come to me except the father draw him now he's speaking to these that say they're Believers and telling them if you continue in my word then you will then you are then you are are my disciples right if you and ye shall know the truth amen the word is his is his truth and the truth shall make you free praise the Lord shall liberate you from what well that's the that's the question they didn't understand they thus they again with the carnal mind speaking to him they said they answered him we be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man I'll sayth thou ye shall be made free see they don't understand amen still living in the bondage of sin and not realizing it amen because it t it takes as much an understanding of of of sin that it is the revelation of the word before someone can receive help they have to understand they're in trouble before someone can be healed they have to understand they're sick yeah right before someone can be saved they have to understand and come to acknowledge that they're lost amen without understanding or not coming to an understanding Revelation that they're lost how can they ever be saved it's got to be it has to be that acknowledgement it's it's the principle really one of the driving principles that alcoholics ecomist uses uh to my understanding you go to Alcoholic Anonymous and you acknowledge you're an alcohol alcoholic when when you go to a meeting or something they make you declare in front of all these people hi I am so and so and I am an alcoholic right I haven't drank for 20 years but I'm an alcoholic they make them declare that so that they continue to recognize I'm a human that always needs continual help right amen and we come to that recognition we know the Lord Jesus what he's done for us and what he's brought us through and who we are today but we also understand that we're human our flesh is sticky and that we're always the people that are in need of help amen but we got to First acknowledge that there's a problem we got to First acknowledge God I need help if you if you understand you need help then you can try to find where to get help from amen if my car breaks down I don't go to the dentist amen if my car is not running I I don't I don't walk down to the uh podiatrist I take my car to a mechanic right amen and conversely I if I have a cavity I don't go to the mechanic what good would that do I go to the dentist I go to the place that's going to help but I have to first understand that I need help yeah once I know I need help then I can find where do I need to go for help right and that's we cry on the Lord Jesus say we know that there's nothing or nobody in no way that anything can be done to help me outside of him amen amen and when that acknowledgement comes and you recognize and you you ask him Lord amen that's where we come to the place of repentance these people don't even know they're in bondage they say we don't how how can we be in bondage we're Abraham seed how can you say that we need to be made free Jesus answered them 34th verse verily verily I say unto you whosoever committes sin is the servant of sin praise the Lord is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the but the son abideth ever if the sun therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed free from what not a a physical shackle but the shackles of sin right the shackle of unbelief the shackle that holds still holds millions billions of people I could be so bold as to predict billions of people are held in this same shackle today they have not acknowledged that they are Shackled by sin that they're Shackled by unbelief that they need Liberty that they need to be made free yeah we think God we live in a nation that's a free Nation yes amen we live in a place that we have that freedom and so many people decide and and and choose to remain in bondage when the freedom is there that we can that we can uh enjoy and become a part of our Lives just to be free free to what free to Worship the Lord free to serve God God set us free so that we can worship him yes bondage is to be enslaved bondage is to be yolked and Shackled Shackled and yolked to sin to bondage and Jesus came and broke those bondage yes broke that yoke separated man from sin and yet people still decide to because we're all free moreal ages to stay in that in that sin in fact most people of course the Bible tells us actually St John that people like Darkness rather than light yeah they they want to remain in darkness yes because in darkness their evil Deeds are still hid it's the light that exposes the evil Deeds right and a person that recognizes I would rather be this way than that way I would rather stay in bondage and a lot of people would rather stay in bondage amen they'd rather stay in in a place where they feel like they can live however they want to live amen but as Sin tries to continue to take a whole over people's lives and will continue to try to manipulate our minds in the believing that let's just when do you realize or when when do you understand and I'll just use the word understand for lack of better verbage understand when something is under the blood when do you come to acknowledgement of recognizing that the sin committed the unbelief the things that been been done the things in our flesh or even in our old life were done when do we come to acknowledge when do we realize understand recognize in our lives that that is under the blood yes that that has been annihilated by the blood of Christ amen taken away from you never to be held against you again when do we understand when do we come to the uh the knowledge of understanding that every one of those things is under the blood of Christ yes and they're not held against me anymore how do you know that how can you come to an understanding of believing that I stand sinless before God that I am robed in the very righteousness of Jesus Christ how do you come to that understanding when can you come to that understanding is it just words we say or is it something we truly believe if it's something we truly believe you'll live like it you'll act like it you'll talk like it you life will exude the presence of Jesus Christ and recognition that he is in you living through you yes there's only one way you can believe it there's only one only one way you can understand it and that's by faith you know that by God's word God I have obeyed your word and in my heart not just something I said not just being dunked in a pool of water but in My Heart Lord I've obeyed your your word yes in my heart God now I know that if I've done what I've what I have been asked to do by Your Word my desire my heart that Lord you will do what you said you would do and you said that your blood will separate me from sin your blood Separates Me from unbelief now I trust that and I know that when I confess that all of that is under the blood done amen never to be held against you anymore yes amen never can be held to your account right amen erased completely gone from any existence of you have ever having done it in the first place that's what justification means not even there then Satan will come and try to make you feel like or tell you again you're guilty when you know you're not you have to believe by faith I confessed it I put it under the blood I ask God to forgive me I repented that Satan is on you now right amen and when God took it off of you and put it on him because it was that it was his to begin with he is the originator of it the father of Lies amen sin is a lie to tell a lie is a sin yeah amen he's the father of Lies which seems like anymore nobody even seems to care that they lie uh even even even when you can see something with your own eyes you can hear with your own ears a person will still come out lie straight to your face they don't care anymore but it's sin and that sin now sin of course carry a person farther than they want to go amen eventually catch up to a person amen that lie that sin will eventually catch up to a person but those lies those things that sin came from him to begin with he is the father of Lies yes he is he tried to put it on you and make you do something against your own uh your own personal will using you against yourself but when you repent and you ask God to forgive you that is taken off of you and put back where it came from praise the Lord that's back on the head of Satan right that's why I tried so hard to take that and put it right back on you again and try to say oh but don't you remember yes he boy sure I do devil of course I remember I'm not going to lie about it yeah I remember I asked God and he forgave me of that now it's on you amen you have to be you at the white Throne judgment are going to have to be held accountable for that not me amen amen you're GNA make him mad people say sometimes it's like sometimes it's like people want to CRI in a hole and just hope the devil's ever touches them bring it on devil I hope he knows my name personally I hope every Devil he's got knows it personally you know why let's just put it this way does anybody in here know Babe Ruth the name the name Babe Ruth yes and why do you know him you might not know one thing about baseball never watched the baseball game they never care anything about baseball but you B you know who Bab truth is why because he was so good amen praise the Lord he did what he did better than anybody that's why everybody knows his name I want to be the best and the closest to God that I humanly can possibly be so that every devil knows my name amen yes I don't care whether those minions have come my direction or not they're going to know my name they're going to know your name don't crawl in a hole and try to hide in the devil right you got his number he has nothing on you Saints all he's trying to do is Bluff you back again into believing and accepting and taking on you what you already put on him what was his to begin with yes and he's trying to accuse you of what he's done don't take it don't take that Devil's lie he'll try to get he'll try to get you to believe you're not a Christian he'll try to get you to believe that you're lost he'll try to get you to believe that God doesn't really love you or God didn't really forgive you or all this all the lies it's all lies every bit of that's contrary to the scripture then why would we believe that over what God told us in his word yeah amen amen people say I had proof proof of what amen people can show physical proof I'm not concerned about physical proof I want to know spiritually where I am spiritually not physically this body without a Rapture this body is going to go back to dust from when it came right I care about where the soul is going I care about where I am with the Lord amen not with in my relationship with God not with this planet this planet is all fine and good we're going to come back and live here one day but I care more about my soul who am I where am I living how close am I living to the Lord how much in the image of God are we Saints so that every devil of hell so then when the devil trums and tries to commission some of his minions to come at you they're going to beg the devil now please don't make me go over there again please I don't want to I we went over there I took a whole leech in the guys and he beat every one of us to a pul devil please don't send us back over there anywhere I'll go anywhere but over there hallelujah amen don't you want to be that person amen praise God Satan has nothing to do with you amen you're a Believer yes you're a child of God God has loosed and set you free Jesus got done with went to hell took the keys to death and hell and climbed up on uh uh uh uh up on high and proclaimed down through a man that says death where is your sting grave where is your Victory amen amen death has no sting death grave has no Victory why because he's already liberated us he's already set us free how can it how can death in the Great hold someone that's sinless they couldn't hold him can't hold you praise the Lord I love that old southern cus it's a southern song Amen I used to hear some got to have a really good voice Sing It Ain't No Grave G to hold my body down there Ain't No Grave gonna hold my body down I wish I knew the rest of the words but I don't sorry can't sing it very good anyway but I love that song Ain't No Grave going to hold my body down why because we're going to resurrect and come against everything that Satan has tried to bring against God and his children second Corinthians let's go to Second Corinthians here chapter 5 2 Corinthians 5:21 look at this oh it's beautiful Saints it's the it's the one thing that gave us our freedom amen that gave us our liberties Satan's tries to spy out our liberties Satan tries to spy out our freedom Saints but God has given us that freedom for he ha made him uh for he had made him to be sin for us made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him now do you believe that praise the Lord when did that happen do you believe that happened yes you got to know by faith that's exactly what God has done to bring us into a relationship with himself with Jesus Christ to become the very righteousness of God he who knew no sin took our sin so we would be sinless he took our place so we could take his Justified so we never done it in the first place free liberated set free to worship God to live for God now we enjoy the Liberties that God gave us so that we can live therein by the freedoms and Liberties that God has that God has given us not not from Britain uh Germany Japan any other of the enemies we've had in Wars all this China whatever going on N none of that but the but but the bondage that Satan brought Humanity under in the Garden of Eden and tries to keep you under every day the bondage of sin that Jesus Christ has loosed and set us free let's go to Galatians now praise the Lord I had this a little longer than I really wanted to have for the service today so uh Lord willing will just uh finish up this and continue next week but Galatians uh let's go to Galatians chapter 5 Galatians chapter 5 read a few verses of scripture here there's so much that speaks to it Saints so many scriptures that encourages us and explains tells us where we're standing we just have to believe it amen we if we say we're Believers we we must believe this Galatians 51 stand fast that means hold firm amen hold firm don't waver amen Don't Be Shaken hold fast Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty where with Christ has made us free praise the Lord don't don't let it waver you don't let it shake you no matter what happens who comes don't let it shake you Saints you hold fast in that Liberty where Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage amen the bondage sin sin that holds so many people captive yes that sin that prison of sin that prison of sin that Jesus set us free from amen I was in sin's prison dark and cold just a lost sheep wandering from God's Eternal fold then the door sprang open and Jesus spoke to me I have signed your pardon you think about that pardon remember remember the story brother Brown tells about Abraham Lincoln and that man amen and that man was fighting for his life and he was on death row and he was pleading and a man come and was going to went before Abraham Lincoln to plead the man's case and and on a napkin or something Abraham pardon Abraham pardon the man signed Abraham Lincoln takes it back to the man see you're you're free you've been pardoned amen signed by the president of United States the man just said oh why would you mock me like that amen and a lot of people feel the F do the same way oh I I I just I can't believe that Jesus would do something like that cuz you remembers like we've said there's no other religion on the planet that that has a leader who gave their own life and suffered and died and bled so that we could have freedom so that we could have salvation another word never used that you know of in in another religion about salvation who who knows to be saved now they just work on themselves to become better right uh uh Buddhist and all oh we just want to be better people well that's fine and good but you can't do it without the blood of Jesus Christ and you might become a better person that's not will take you into heaven that's not will give you eternal life praise the Lord and that man J said uh uh you're just trying to mock me you're just making fun of me I'm about to die tomorrow and you come and Forge present signature then just leave me alone let me die in peace he finally convinced the man just finally left the next day they shot the man killed him executed him and he said why was this man executed he was pardoned by the president of the United States so I tried to give him his pardon but he wouldn't accept it they come out and say well a pardon is not a pardon unless it is accepted as a pardon right amen it's only a pardon if you accept it as a pardon praise the Lord and thank God there was somebody that was going to live through eternity that would accept Jesus Christ's pardon or he would not have done it right amen friends I tell you I I personally believe if I was the only one down through the animals of time that was going to believe this truth and accept his salv his his sacrifice for my salvation he would have done it anyway just for me if there's no other human ever on the planet in the history of humanity was going to accept it and he knew I would he'd have done it anyway just for me billions may have turned him down billions May may not want to have anything to do with him but I knew that he knew that I would so he did it he did it for me you got to make it that personal if you really believe that Saints you got to make it that personal he did it for you yes amen Jesus signed your pardon now you can go free am now the anybody that accepts that pardon can go free but how many people reject that Parton oh I don't believe that or I don't see it like that or whatever their excuse is and they stay in bondage why people love Darkness rather than light yes amen praise the Lord let's continue on don't be entangled again with the Yoke of bondage behold I Paul say unto you that if you be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing for I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debor to do the whole law remember we've been just been talking about the law Grace if he does this he's he's if he he tries to obey the law he's a deor to the whole law you don't pick and choose your laws yes amen you don't say well I'm gonna I'm GNA do this and Obey this but I don't like that one so I'm not going to do that you know it's same way people cherry pick the scripture you I believe this part of the scripture I want to live this part uh that says that he will strengthen me but you know this part that says I need to obey uh I I'm not sure want to do that right this part that says oh he's my he's my uh my God and savior I'll take that yes I need a savior but this part about him being my Lord I I don't know if I really want him lording over me then you don't want him at all amen if you're going to take any part you take all part if you reject any part you reject them all amen amen de to do the whole law fourth verse Christ has become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from Grace if you're justified by the law because the law does not justify remember you cannot have relationship with Christ by the law the letter is not how we know God we know God by the spirit amen our relationship with him is by the spirit not by the letter praise the Lord for we through the spirit wait for the hope through what the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by Faith by faith it's got to come by faith Saints for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision develops anything nor uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love amen amen ye did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you a little leav lenth the whole lump I have confidence confidence in you through the Lord that ye will be none otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be and I Brethren if I preach circumcision why do I yet suffer persecution then it is the offense of the then is the offense of the Cross ceased I would they were even cut off which trouble you but see that that's not how we grow that that's not how we get strength amen uh a bodybuilder can can go to a gym and sit there and look at the weights all day long but that's not going to help him he's got to pick them up and use them he's got to work on they got to that there has to be a resistance against his muscle so the muscle builds there's got to be a resistance there so that your faith builds so that your trust in the Lord Lord so that your confidence so your walk it builds it gets stronger you get stronger see it says he said I would that they would be cut off to trouble you but it's the trouble the iron sharpeneth iron it's the trouble sometimes that grows the biggest muscles yeah that brings the best results that gets you the closest to God that puts us on our knees before the Lord amen amen for Brethren ye have been called unto Liberty praise God we've been called to Liberty but look what he says now we've been called to Liberty we've been called to freedom but amen we've been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another so we don't take the liberties we don't take the freedom he gave us just to live any old way we want just to live our lives in sin we take the Liberty and the freedom that God has given us so that we can serve him amen outside of the bondage of the devil in sin yes he's G us that freedom so that we can live for him so that we can serve him I'm free to do whatever I want amen I smoke as many cigarettes as I want I drink as much beer as I want I cuss as often as I want amen I just don't want to amen amen and why do I not want you because it's not in me to do because it's not it's not righteous Holiness with him the god that lives in me oh I I could live any way well I just don't want to amen we don't take the Liberty that God gave us to use it to sin to use it any way God's well God will forgive me well yeah he will but you don't take God's grace and make a disgrace out of it because then you cross you cross over that line that brother Ram talks about many times yes people crossing in that line and then when you cross that line there's no way back right right amen there remaineth I'm sorry but the scripture says there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin at that point right Amen brother R pointed out people on tape who crossed that line he talked about that one woman uh that he he called her out in service and after service she scalded and said how dare you embarrass me like that in front of all those people I just trying to help me sister how dare you don't ever do that something like that and she walked stomped out saw however many years later she yelled at him with a whiskey bottle in her hand hi Parson said do I know you she said I was that girl was sitting down that you called on and said this could be my last chance she said you know what that was my last chance took a slug of that whiskey he said you ought to be ashamed of yourself he said Parson I could see my mama's soul frying in hell and it wouldn't bother me now that's a person who's crossed the line yes amen but he warned her that could have been her last chance and it was her last chance my mind do it would have get to that place but it does happen amen by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even this Thou shalt there we go again there's that same Leviticus 1918 Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself praise the Lord but if you bite devour one another take ye that you not consume one another another praise the Lord I believe in the in the in the patronage of our country there was a man that stood forth one time and said Give me liberty or give me death it was Patrick H amen Give me liberty or give me death he knew what it meant to have the liberty of the freedom to be able to live the way he wanted to by the dictates of his Lord and Savior not by another you're telling him as such right amen but by the dictates now God has set us free now what do we do with our freedom what are we doing with our liberties that God had gave us what are we doing with the freedoms that the Lord give us amen are we stomping over them we taking advantage of them are we appreciative of them or they become so common that we don't even it's just not even that important anymore amen needs to be something that we think about Saints unfortunately I'm afraid as far as this country concerned is probably the latter so many people today don't know what it's like don't know what it's about because they're so callous to it anymore yes to to have the freedoms that we have for the ones that served and gave their lives and died and bled and even just serve even if they live through it the service to be able to help this country Stay Free the way it is it's lost today a lot of in a lot of ways a lot of people a lot of young people it's lost they don't appreciate it it's not as important to them anymore because it's they become callous to it they they don't understand I'm sorry but a lot of times I get myself a little self-righteous indignation and I say why don't we just pick them up take them and drop them in the middle of North Korean they'll find out real quick what it's like to have the freedoms and liberties we have yes won't take them long at all amen they'll find out real quick praise the Lord but I'm so thankful that nearing what we have and the freedoms the Lord is give us yes Amen to serve him to live for him that's why we can have this little nothing place with just a handful of us in the middle of nowhere in Tucson Arizona and still have a the services have God visit us and the the things that we have for our our service and what God does for us amen amen God's not God's not worried about the multi-million dollar buildings and tens of thousands of people Amen brother Bram said I'd rather Branch drink Branch water and eat soda crackers on the street corner preach the gospel the truth the truth than to compromise on God's word yes amen praise the Lord let's appreciate that freedom let's use it to the occasion the Lord has given us amen let's stand if we could praise the Lord Jesus so many people think that uh brother brother brandom pointed us to himself those are people that I would like to uh get them to show me any one place in any word in any cave in anywhere that brother Ram ever pointed us to himself ever you know why I feel confident about that it's not there that's right and I can show them I don't know on a number but I can show them multiple occasions thousands of occasions where he pointed us to Christ amen and that's where it should be amen amen the Bride In Christ praise the Lord become one amen thank you Lord Jesus amen he set us free amen he has loosed and set us free praise the Lord Jesus signed our part can we sing this chorus to a couple times again amen
