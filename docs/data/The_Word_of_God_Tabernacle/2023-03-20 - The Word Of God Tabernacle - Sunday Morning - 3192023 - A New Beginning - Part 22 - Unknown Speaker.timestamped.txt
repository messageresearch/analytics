[26:06] Lord Jesus with all our hearts and
[26:09] reverence to the greatness
[26:12] the god that's created all things that's
[26:15] around us and then universe and yet you
[26:19] humbled yourself
[26:21] and you went to the cross and you died
[26:24] for our sins yes that we may have a way
[26:28] to receive thank you eternal life and
[26:31] now you come and abide in our hearts
[26:34] Lord
[26:35] and there's such a burden on My Heart
[26:37] Lord to see that why are we still here
[26:42] Lord I I heard your prophets say it
[26:47] should have taken a few days journey for
[26:50] the children of Israel to cross over
[26:53] into the promised land and it took him
[26:56] 40 years because of their unbelief God
[26:59] help us and father I researched it and
[27:02] experts said by the way they were
[27:04] traveling it should have taken 11 days
[27:07] and where are we at right now Lord are
[27:12] we compromising with the world we want
[27:15] to be identified with the world and yet
[27:18] we identified with you we cannot serve
[27:21] to master oh you know we love the one or
[27:23] hate the other lord it's time to totally
[27:27] commit Our Lives to you there's some
[27:30] that if they it can be a church and
[27:33] don't think about it and don't okay well
[27:36] I I'll go to church I got nothing else
[27:39] to do Lord where's the dedication where
[27:43] is the sincerity that's why we're
[27:46] wondering I believe in the wilderness of
[27:49] life right now Lord my heart's desire is
[27:53] to see the Rapture take place to be with
[27:57] you for eternity and Lord I can recall
[28:01] in the scriptures there was one man he
[28:06] thought it was all right to take a few
[28:09] gold trinkets oh wow yes and yet he
[28:13] caused the family of God at that time to
[28:17] fail as they were trying to defeat Miami
[28:20] yes Lord what are we holding on to are
[28:24] we holding on to some ungodly desire
[28:27] some trinket of unbelief maybe we want
[28:31] to show them you know we want to look
[28:34] pretty as the sisters painting ourselves
[28:37] and cutting our hair and doing things
[28:39] contrary to the word of God how about us
[28:42] Brothers Lord not taking the leadership
[28:45] not praying and trying to provide good
[28:49] leadership amongst the family Lord and
[28:53] just maybe joining in with some filthy
[28:56] jokes and filthy conversation and
[28:59] letting Our
[29:01] Testimony down by compromising with the
[29:05] world and then the word father oh help
[29:09] us Lord help us Lord as the prophet said
[29:13] if there's unconfessed sin in our lives
[29:16] we you a person can be Anointed with a
[29:20] gallon of oil and then
[29:23] sin this will stop you from giving that
[29:27] person the Deliverance they need and
[29:31] Lord help us to recognize the day and
[29:34] the hour that we're living in yes oh God
[29:37] let us confess our sins put together
[29:39] with blood and let there be power
[29:42] amongst your people there'll be
[29:45] demonstration and power as we call on
[29:49] your name Lord oh it's not time to uh
[29:54] play church it's not time to just take
[29:58] for granted that um I'll go to church
[30:01] and the rest of the week I'll just do my
[30:03] own thing when uh lust has conceived it
[30:07] bringeth forth sin and When sin is
[30:10] finished then bringeth forth death O

[32:12] then always forget uh
[32:14] always forget things that's on my heart
[32:17] to mention as far as prayer requests
[32:20] um we had a good trip like I said me and
[32:22] Sonya did but we would like to ask you
[32:24] to pray for us uh the main reason we
[32:27] went there was to find a headstone for
[32:29] our son our first son who passed away
[32:31] after 36 and a half hours and uh finally
[32:34] got the means ability to do it but the
[32:36] one that we want the most the one that
[32:38] Sonia basically I mean
[32:41] pretty much that's what we want is is
[32:45] not in stock anymore they don't make it
[32:47] nobody wants it I guess so uh it's very
[32:51] difficult to get
[32:53] so we're looking for someone either
[32:55] locally in the states that can carve
[32:57] granite or we'll have to get it from
[33:00] overseas somewhere and the lady said it
[33:02] could look like a lamb or it could look
[33:03] like a dog
[33:04] so we're we're kind of we're a little
[33:07] bit stuck right now so we appreciate
[33:10] your prayers the Lord will just
[33:12] find something somebody uh without you
[33:16] know charging five thousand dollars for
[33:18] a little Tombstone
[33:20] that can Harbor granite and we can have
[33:24] that so that's kind of what we really
[33:26] want so I appreciate your prayers about
[33:28] that and uh also I appreciate your
[33:30] prayers I'm going back out again this
[33:32] afternoon
[33:33] um I'm not flying this time though our
[33:36] job is in El Paso this week so I'm
[33:38] driving
[33:39] so I'll be going to the airport and pick
[33:41] up a rental car and driving to El Paso
[33:43] so but things can go just as crazy wrong
[33:46] with the devil trying to intervene is in
[33:49] the cards that count on a plane so you
[33:51] know
[33:52] prayers about that as well so
[33:54] I appreciate the Lord's goodness to us
[33:57] now if anyone else have a testimony in
[33:59] your heart
[34:01] yes sister

[34:05] ever used

[34:16] so anyway I don't have a garage so I've
[34:19] used a card cup a few years

[40:57] some things that we don't know for sure

[43:26] now and as the remaining part of this
[43:28] service your blessings upon it in the
[43:30] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[43:32] amen amen amen Genesis chapter one read
[43:35] the first couple of verses here again
[43:38] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[43:42] and the Earth
[43:43] and the Earth was without form and void
[43:44] and darkness upon the face of the deep
[43:46] the spirit of God moved upon the face of
[43:49] the waters you could be seated if you'd
[43:52] like amen praise the Lord as I said this
[43:55] would be the last uh this will be the
[43:58] last part that we have here to bring to
[44:01] you part 22 New Beginning
[44:05] and again I pray that something was said
[44:07] to be a help and a blessing to each one
[44:09] of you but let's turn over to Revelation
[44:11] chapter 21. amen and we'll finish this
[44:14] up
[44:15] by reading a couple of verses and we'll
[44:17] finish on those Gates
[44:19] and manage your turn in there I'll go
[44:20] ahead and grab this uh I'll probably
[44:22] draw this up just one more time I had
[44:25] kind of done it before
[44:26] before started getting into the into the
[44:29] foundations and the gates and we
[44:31] finished up with the foundations the
[44:32] other day and this uh
[44:36] that we had here the breast slate
[44:39] increase the office at that time
[44:42] amen but we'll try to see the Lord
[44:45] willing how we can put this up to finish
[44:48] this off now let's start uh let's just
[44:50] read Revelation 12 and 13 and then we'll
[44:55] drop down to 21 which uh puts us on
[44:58] those Gates we'll talk about that here
[45:00] and finish this up today
[45:02] Revelation 21 12 and had a wall great
[45:06] and high
[45:07] and had 12 gates and at the gates 12
[45:11] angels and the names written thereon
[45:13] which are the names of the 12 tribes of
[45:16] the children of Israel and on the East
[45:18] three gates and on the north three gates
[45:21] on the south three gates on the west
[45:24] three gates now let's drop down to the
[45:26] 21st verse here
[45:28] and the 12 gates were 12 pearls every
[45:32] several gate was of one Pearl we talked
[45:35] about that last week amen or last time
[45:38] every every gate was of one Pearl
[45:42] several again the several just means
[45:43] each gate Each One Singular gate uh as
[45:47] it's saying that this is uh versus uh
[45:51] some entryways that may have uh uh a
[45:55] bifold doors or two doors that would
[45:57] open this is just one gate and it's just
[46:00] one several games to itself of one Pearl
[46:03] amen and the street of the city was pure
[46:06] gold as it were transparent glass now
[46:09] Less in in reference as we go through
[46:12] this uh I just got a little bit more to
[46:14] give to you on this uh in reference to
[46:17] this the the 12th verse uh and the 13th
[46:20] verse really let's go over to Ezekiel
[46:22] chapter 48. amen I told you we look at
[46:26] what the the size of these Gates now we
[46:28] talked about the size of the walls how
[46:31] big the walls are going to be basically
[46:32] on the scripture of How High the wall
[46:34] would be and we don't know for sure
[46:36] because I had not been able to find any
[46:38] place in the scripture that tells us how
[46:41] high the gates are but Ezekiel 48 does
[46:45] tell us how big they are or or in
[46:48] essence how wide they are so let's go to
[46:50] Ezekiel chapter 48 and we'll begin
[46:52] reading with verse 30.
[46:55] Ezekiel 48 verse 30.
[47:00] foreign
[47:01] amen read it through and then we'll go
[47:03] back and talk about it for just a moment
[47:05] and these are the goings out of the city
[47:09] on the North side
[47:11] 4500 measures now it's talking about
[47:14] each side having four thousand five
[47:18] hundred measures now a measure uh is is
[47:23] not uh per se an Old Testament
[47:26] measurement uh cubits is the most well
[47:31] used measurement of the Old Testament
[47:33] and a cubit is approximately 18 inches
[47:36] give or take a little again uh we don't
[47:40] work in in the exact inches or the
[47:44] sixteenth of an inch uh we're just
[47:46] talking about these as approximate sizes
[47:48] just as we've done through the entire
[47:51] chapter uh of Revelation 21. but it's
[47:54] approximately a cubit is approximately
[47:57] 21 inches so when he's talking about a
[47:59] measure the best I can find when it's
[48:02] talking about a measure it's talking
[48:03] about a cubit
[48:05] so as it says four thousand five hundred
[48:08] measures basically four thousand five
[48:11] hundred cubits is the opening on the
[48:14] North side amen now uh when I first read
[48:17] this I read it wrong uh I I got it uh I
[48:22] got I got it messed up on the size of
[48:24] the gates uh but as I read through this
[48:27] it'll probably become clear to you
[48:30] because I started to believe that each
[48:32] gate was four thousand five hundred
[48:35] measures but that's not true each
[48:38] opening on each side accumulative is
[48:42] four thousand five hundred measures amen
[48:44] and being about 18 inches uh 4 500
[48:48] measures is approximately a mile and a
[48:51] half
[48:51] amen just so that you understand each
[48:55] one of those openings now let me just
[48:57] continue to read on so that uh it may
[49:00] become a little light to you even before
[49:01] I even say anything else four thousand
[49:04] five hundred measures and the gates of
[49:06] the city shall be after the names of the
[49:09] tribes of Israel now remember we talked
[49:12] about the gates and the foundations uh
[49:15] including both Jew and Gentile on each
[49:19] one amen as each gate is a pearl amen
[49:23] which represents the Gentile bride which
[49:26] we'll go into a little bit later each
[49:28] Pearl representing the Gentile bride in
[49:31] each gate of 1 Pearl is the name of one
[49:35] of each of the 12 tribes of Israel
[49:38] the gates of the city shall be shall be
[49:41] after the names of the tribes of Israel
[49:43] three gates northward one gate of Reuben
[49:46] one gate of Judah one gate of Levi and
[49:49] on the east side 4 500 and three gates
[49:53] three gates within the 4 500 measures
[49:57] and one gate of Joseph one gate of
[49:59] Benjamin one gate of dam and at the
[50:01] South Side 4 500 measures and three
[50:05] gates one of Simeon one of issachar one
[50:08] gate of zebulun at the West Side four
[50:11] thousand five hundred was their three
[50:13] gates one gate of GAD one gate of Asher
[50:16] one gate of Napoli it was around it was
[50:20] around about about 18
[50:24] 000 measures and the name of the city
[50:27] from that day shall be the Lord is there
[50:32] amen that's probably the best part I
[50:34] like to me the name of the city from
[50:38] that day shall be the Lord is there amen
[50:41] but verse 35 is what uh caught my
[50:44] attention because if you make every gate
[50:47] 4 500 measures then the entirety of the
[50:51] gates is 54 000 measures but the 35th
[50:54] verse says that it's only eighteen
[50:56] thousand measures which makes each side
[50:59] 4 500 measures so if you take each gate
[51:04] and you divide it up between the 4 500
[51:07] measures that makes each gate
[51:10] approximately 2200 feet a little less
[51:13] than half a mile
[51:15] so each gate that we have here and I'll
[51:18] try to it's going to be crude because
[51:20] I'm I'm doing this quickly of course uh
[51:24] each gate
[51:29] so this is the city
[51:31] the pyramid the wall that's around it
[51:33] each side has three gates
[51:37] the openings on each side and remember
[51:40] the openings
[51:43] account for the entirety of the openings
[51:46] all three account for 4 500 measures
[51:51] so if you divide that up that's 1500
[51:53] measures per day so each gate is 1500
[51:58] measures wide
[52:00] if you do the math then each measures
[52:03] approximately 18 inches that's 2200 feet
[52:06] that's a little less than half a mile so
[52:08] each one of these Gates is a little less
[52:11] than half a mile long uh that seems like
[52:15] a a pretty sizable gate and it is but
[52:19] when you think about the entire side
[52:20] here being approximately 1500 miles a
[52:25] half a mile for each gate or a little
[52:27] less than a half a mile is actually not
[52:29] that not that big uh I thought about it
[52:33] and I'm gonna give you my opinion in my
[52:36] opinion I believe these Gates will slide
[52:39] to the side I don't think they'll open
[52:42] uh like this I personally think ah this
[52:46] has nothing to do with scripture has
[52:48] nothing to do with what brother Brown
[52:49] says this is my opinion now you might
[52:52] have your opinion and that's there's
[52:53] nothing wrong with that if you think
[52:55] they uh swing open then that's fine
[52:58] you're entitled to that I personally
[53:01] think that these Gates will slide to the
[53:03] side A lot of times what they call them
[53:06] barn doors now or something a lot of
[53:08] people ask you one of that in their
[53:09] homes now uh for their bathrooms and
[53:12] stuff me and me and my wife just stayed
[53:15] in a hotel and that's what their
[53:16] bathroom door was it just it slid to the
[53:19] side it was out outside the wall and
[53:22] that door just slid to the side and made
[53:24] me think I I I I love the opinion that's
[53:27] probably how these are going to be
[53:28] rather than trying to swing on hinges I
[53:31] think they just slide but they're
[53:32] they're pretty big nevertheless when you
[53:34] figure a little less than half a mile
[53:37] for each gate those are pretty big Gates
[53:40] but each side has an accumulative
[53:43] opening of 4 500 measures now we know
[53:47] these gates are to be open all the time
[53:50] the Bible says uh we'll probably finish
[53:53] up our with this and reading the whole
[53:55] thing over again but it tells us that
[53:58] that these Gates will be open all the
[54:00] time they'll be open day and night amen
[54:02] for those that come from outside the
[54:04] city come and bring in the the leaves
[54:08] for the healing of the Nations and and
[54:10] paying honor and tribute to amen just
[54:13] like we know that the foundations are
[54:15] garnished as a tribute just like the
[54:17] names are written these pearls as a
[54:19] tribute these things are all tributes in
[54:22] response and and an acknowledgment of
[54:25] the great God that has brought it all
[54:27] together that has brought not just the
[54:30] Gentiles to this place but Jew and
[54:32] Gentile brother Branham said again that
[54:35] this is for the Overcomer not just to
[54:38] the Gentile Bradford but for those who
[54:41] overcome amen amen and he lets us know
[54:44] by each one of these how God is
[54:46] including
[54:48] his people peculiar people and his bride
[54:52] that he's bringing them together Amen to
[54:55] to represent this and these gates are
[54:57] one of those things so these Gates
[54:58] approximately eight uh approximately a
[55:01] little less than a mile each amen made
[55:05] of one Pearl now what is uh when you
[55:09] look up a pearl
[55:11] it's not difficult to understand what a
[55:13] pearl is
[55:16] but the scripture speaks about uh about
[55:19] Pearl
[55:21] the importance of a pearl what a what a
[55:24] pearl is how a pearl comes to be because
[55:26] it's it's God that does it I mean it's
[55:29] God that uh brings has the gold out here
[55:33] people just go dig it up God's the one
[55:35] that put the silver out here people just
[55:37] dig it up the God made the oyster to
[55:41] where he creates these pearls they're
[55:43] they're beautiful diamonds out of the
[55:45] ground those all come from God
[55:47] man just discovered them and considered
[55:50] them precious and and and
[55:53] sometimes rare but God's the one that
[55:56] made them so they're all belong to him
[55:58] so but a pearl is is pretty fairly
[56:01] self-explanatory but when you talk about
[56:04] uh uh a metaphor if you will of a pearl
[56:08] uh the the concordance says the Pearl is
[56:13] also considered a word of great value
[56:19] a pearl is considered a word of Great
[56:22] Value praise the Lord now what is it to
[56:26] God that is a that that today is a word
[56:30] of Great Value now we know his word is
[56:33] of Great Value absolutely amen but what
[56:37] word is it today that God has all down
[56:42] through history through the churches but
[56:44] we're talking about right now today that
[56:46] God has that is a word of great value
[56:50] let's go over to Matthew
[56:53] uh and let's read in Matthew
[56:56] chapter 13.
[57:01] Matthew 13 44.
[57:06] let's look at what Jesus talks about
[57:08] this Pearl how important it is of this
[57:12] Pearl what this Pearl means what this
[57:14] Pearl represents it's not just something
[57:17] to say well it's of one Pearl I mean
[57:20] this must have been a huge oyster or
[57:23] wherever it came from God creates
[57:25] whatever he wants he doesn't have to God
[57:27] does not have to use an oyster to make a
[57:30] pearl you understand that so amen but a
[57:33] pearl of what of what importance is it
[57:35] that these gates are of pearl we talked
[57:39] about this last time in a lot of the
[57:40] songs and a lot of the uh the the old
[57:44] ancient way of thinking about uh uh
[57:47] Jesus giving giving peace the keys to
[57:50] the kingdom and and and Peter standing
[57:52] at the Pearly gate looking for your name
[57:54] on a book or something
[57:56] it's amazing what the carnal mind can
[57:59] can come up with when you think about
[58:01] actual realities and truths of the
[58:04] scripture and get them so scrupled up
[58:06] that they really don't even amount to
[58:08] what the scripture is telling us be
[58:10] trust me when we get to this place Peter
[58:14] will not be standing here at the gate
[58:16] waiting for your uh
[58:19] uh entrance papers to open and unlock
[58:23] the key so that you can get into the
[58:25] Pearly Gates amen that that will not be
[58:28] happening here amen but you understand
[58:30] the way that the the mentality of humans
[58:33] and thinking the way they go Matthew
[58:35] Chapter 13 Verse 44.
[58:38] again now look what Jesus said again the
[58:42] kingdom of heaven now look how important
[58:46] it is to recognize uh
[58:48] the 10 play I believe is 10 places that
[58:52] Jesus speaks up here in Matthew that he
[58:56] Likens unto the kingdom of heaven we
[58:59] also know like uh Matthew 25 the ten
[59:02] virgins Jesus said it is likened unto
[59:06] Heaven five Wise by foolish well this is
[59:08] one of those places where Jesus Likens
[59:12] his Parable here to the kingdom of
[59:15] heaven now
[59:17] the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto
[59:20] treasure hid in a field a treasure
[59:24] hidden a field
[59:27] the witch meant when when a man hath
[59:30] found he hideth uh he hideth and for Joy
[59:34] thereof goeth and sell us all he have
[59:37] and buy it that field amen now we've got
[59:41] in this
[59:44] this one verse let's just read the 45th
[59:47] verse 2. again the Kingdom of Heaven is
[59:50] likened to a merchant man selling goodly
[59:53] pearls who when he had found one pearl
[59:57] of great price went and sold all that he
[1:00:01] had and bought it now notice this man
[1:00:06] has done the exact same perform the
[1:00:09] exact same uh ritual if you will
[1:00:14] to to redeem
[1:00:17] both classes
[1:00:19] the hidden treasure
[1:00:22] uh the the the peculiar treasure the The
[1:00:25] Treasure of great value and the pearl of
[1:00:29] great value
[1:00:30] this man has performed the same Act
[1:00:34] to redeem or to purchase the treasure
[1:00:38] and The Pearl
[1:00:39] it's not a different act it's the same
[1:00:42] thing that he does for one he does for
[1:00:44] the other now who does God consider his
[1:00:47] peculiar treasure
[1:00:49] let's look at the scripture here
[1:00:52] Psalms chapter 135 I think I got it here
[1:00:57] Psalms 135 and 4. look at this for the
[1:01:01] Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself
[1:01:04] Israel which would be the father
[1:01:08] patriarch of the of the 12 tribes of
[1:01:11] Israel which we talk about hear the
[1:01:13] names on the on the Pearl on the Pearly
[1:01:15] Gates
[1:01:16] Jacob look for the Lord had chosen Jacob
[1:01:20] unto himself and Israel that's his
[1:01:24] people amen that's God's chosen people
[1:01:26] Israel was God's chosen people for his
[1:01:29] peculiar treasure
[1:01:32] God has picked Jacob God has chosen
[1:01:35] Jacob and Israel well Jacob is Israel
[1:01:39] but what he's talking about is Jacob and
[1:01:42] his posterity his children the 12 tribes
[1:01:46] of Israel from which all come forth and
[1:01:49] issue out of whose names as we know have
[1:01:52] written on each one of these 12 pearls
[1:01:54] Gates of pearl
[1:01:56] God has chosen him as what peculiar
[1:01:59] treasure now Jesus said heaven is like
[1:02:03] unto a man
[1:02:04] uh who found a great treasure
[1:02:08] and what did he do
[1:02:10] when he found this great treasure
[1:02:13] he let everything else go
[1:02:16] he saw all that he hath
[1:02:19] to buy that field of great treasure
[1:02:22] amen sold everything you had what does
[1:02:26] that mean that means he gave everything
[1:02:29] he had
[1:02:30] he gave us all
[1:02:32] he gave everything he could give
[1:02:34] to obtain this treasure to purchase this
[1:02:38] treasure there's I say to redeem this
[1:02:41] treasure
[1:02:42] praise God he did everything he could do
[1:02:46] and that was Diet Calvary to give his
[1:02:49] life to shed his blood that they could
[1:02:51] find Salvation
[1:02:53] amen and not only that but on that day
[1:02:56] he went to hell
[1:02:58] and he took the keys and he let
[1:03:01] captivity captive
[1:03:03] and he let them loose and they came and
[1:03:06] appeared before many here on Earth and
[1:03:08] his Ascension they went with him
[1:03:10] praise the Lord that great treasure that
[1:03:14] he sold all that he had to give but now
[1:03:16] notice he did the exact same act one act
[1:03:20] amen not to
[1:03:22] God didn't do one act to purchase the
[1:03:25] treasure and one actor purchased the
[1:03:26] Pearl no it's one act
[1:03:29] look at this the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:03:32] likely to a merchant man seeking goodly
[1:03:33] pearls when he had found one pearl of
[1:03:36] great price went and sold all that he
[1:03:39] had and bought it he gave everything he
[1:03:42] had
[1:03:43] he sold everything he had he gave
[1:03:45] everything that he is could be he gave
[1:03:48] all that he had he gave himself he
[1:03:51] selleth or he dieth you purchased that
[1:03:54] Pearl amen amen amen the same
[1:03:58] Act of redemption was for Israel it was
[1:04:02] for his chosen people as much as it was
[1:04:05] for his Gentile bride
[1:04:08] praise God the one act of selling
[1:04:11] everything he had of giving all that he
[1:04:14] had
[1:04:15] to purchased that treasure to purchase
[1:04:18] that Pearl amen amen praise the Lord so
[1:04:22] God did the exact same thing that one
[1:04:25] act that help not only save a lost and
[1:04:29] dying people a gentile people that was
[1:04:31] not even a people
[1:04:33] you know we weren't even a people right
[1:04:35] we weren't even acknowledged we weren't
[1:04:38] even recognized and in the spirit realm
[1:04:41] and in the eyes of God meant absolutely
[1:04:43] nothing right
[1:04:45] God common through this act
[1:04:48] he found something of great value
[1:04:51] a word
[1:04:53] a word of great value
[1:04:56] praise the Lord a word a pearl a word of
[1:05:00] great wisdom a word of Great Value what
[1:05:03] is the bride become today she's become
[1:05:05] him who is he he is the word yes and
[1:05:09] she's become the word of Great Value
[1:05:11] that he sold all that he had he gave
[1:05:15] everything he could give he died so that
[1:05:18] you could live yes he shed his blood so
[1:05:21] you can have Redemption amen now it's
[1:05:25] completely annihilated now not only did
[1:05:27] he do that as we would call it today
[1:05:30] paying forward
[1:05:31] but he did it for those all that came up
[1:05:34] that didn't have that Redemption right
[1:05:36] all those that were under the blood of
[1:05:38] bulls and goats all those were under the
[1:05:40] the sacrifices of the Old Testament
[1:05:43] which God accepted for that day but not
[1:05:45] a good enough for Redemption
[1:05:46] it took a Redemptive plan of Jesus
[1:05:49] Christ the man that could actually
[1:05:51] purchase it
[1:05:52] amen
[1:05:54] just like I said none of us could have
[1:05:55] purchased it none of us had we couldn't
[1:05:58] have paid it there's no way we could pay
[1:06:00] that debt there's no human John even had
[1:06:02] the book in Revelation 5 and he looked
[1:06:05] around and there was nobody found worthy
[1:06:07] not even John himself amen amen and he
[1:06:10] began to cry because nobody could open
[1:06:12] that book
[1:06:13] nobody was worthy to loose those seals
[1:06:16] to really reveal those names to show The
[1:06:19] Plan of Redemption nobody could do it no
[1:06:22] man until the lamb stepped forth yes
[1:06:25] amen he looked around and he saw bloody
[1:06:27] lamb what was that Bloody lamb that was
[1:06:29] the price that was paid for the
[1:06:31] Redemption of this treasure in this
[1:06:33] Pearl
[1:06:34] you've got this pearl of Great Value
[1:06:36] this word of wisdom the bride is
[1:06:39] becoming the word of great wisdom of
[1:06:41] great value
[1:06:43] to God
[1:06:45] you my friend were of such great value
[1:06:47] to God and he gave all that he had for
[1:06:50] you very much he gave everything he
[1:06:52] could give yes there was nothing else
[1:06:54] that Jesus Christ could have done he
[1:06:56] could not have given any more than
[1:06:58] himself yeah his life his blood but you
[1:07:02] were of such great value to him he was
[1:07:04] willing to do it
[1:07:06] amen amen praise God aren't you thankful
[1:07:08] that God saw you with that great value
[1:07:10] how many of you look in the mirror in
[1:07:12] the morning and see a great value
[1:07:16] I don't
[1:07:17] I try to I said God help me look through
[1:07:21] your eyes so I can see what you see and
[1:07:23] I look and I see this same ugly God
[1:07:25] every day I think my what was it in this
[1:07:28] man that God saw that made him want to
[1:07:30] go to Calgary for I'll never know I'll
[1:07:33] never know just only from the fact of
[1:07:36] outside of this ugly exterior is a seed
[1:07:39] of God
[1:07:41] Amen that word of Great Value that came
[1:07:45] from God from before the foundation of
[1:07:46] the world that he placed in you that was
[1:07:48] be redeemed back to himself amen that's
[1:07:52] what he's looking at he's not looking in
[1:07:54] the mirror you're looking at amen he's
[1:07:57] looking in mirror of the word yes and in
[1:08:00] that mirror he sees himself when he
[1:08:02] looks at you
[1:08:04] he doesn't see you in your faults and
[1:08:05] mistakes he doesn't see you in your
[1:08:07] failures and when you fall he sees you
[1:08:10] of that perm of great price he sees you
[1:08:12] of that great value of someone who was
[1:08:16] worthy listen someone who is worthy and
[1:08:19] unworthy people who was worthy enough
[1:08:22] for him to place his own life in you
[1:08:26] all right what greater value can you get
[1:08:29] what greater value can there be that God
[1:08:33] Almighty himself taking a piece of
[1:08:35] himself a thought as brother Branham
[1:08:36] said an attribute to put it in each one
[1:08:39] of us
[1:08:40] amen with some such great value
[1:08:44] he calm and gave his life for it praise
[1:08:46] the Lord
[1:08:48] those of the Old Testament those are the
[1:08:50] ones that peculiar treasure that we read
[1:08:52] about those are the ones that did not
[1:08:55] know they could only be under the the
[1:08:57] blood of a bull or a goat or a sacrifice
[1:08:59] of some kind they didn't have the
[1:09:01] Redemption that we have
[1:09:04] but Jesus Christ come and paid that
[1:09:07] price yes amen he redeemed them
[1:09:10] that reached all the way back to the
[1:09:13] Garden of Eden and brought them back up
[1:09:15] to himself yes and it reached all the
[1:09:18] way forward to the very time that God
[1:09:20] will take us from this Earth to bring us
[1:09:22] to him amen now let's look at this a
[1:09:25] pearl let me read this quote
[1:09:28] you know something very striking to me
[1:09:31] in the message
[1:09:33] not just the word of Great Value because
[1:09:36] obviously the word that God brought
[1:09:40] through this Prophet was of
[1:09:44] great doesn't even seem like a good
[1:09:46] enough word I was going to say great
[1:09:48] value but that just doesn't seem to do
[1:09:49] it justice
[1:09:52] I don't know if you think of better
[1:09:53] adjective let me know we'll just say a
[1:09:55] great value uh that God allowed him
[1:09:58] brought him died to himself to bring a
[1:10:01] word to us of that great value was of
[1:10:04] such value to us but when you look
[1:10:06] through that message and the things that
[1:10:09] God allowed uh this Prophet to do and go
[1:10:12] through when it come up to the very end
[1:10:14] it was a very special event that
[1:10:17] happened to brother Brown it happened
[1:10:18] right over here
[1:10:21] uh right over here in Sabino
[1:10:24] let me read to you brother Braham talks
[1:10:26] about it the breach's message he said I
[1:10:28] was standing there in prayer he said I
[1:10:29] was standing
[1:10:31] I've had a lot of people that I've taken
[1:10:32] up there and they kneel down I said you
[1:10:34] said you kneel down but brother Branham
[1:10:36] said when he was praying there as what
[1:10:38] we consider sword Mountain Pulpit Rock
[1:10:40] whatever you want to call it brother bam
[1:10:42] said I was standing there praying yeah
[1:10:45] yeah so you I've had people come to
[1:10:48] Congo all over the place I said you're
[1:10:49] more than welcome to kneel do it in your
[1:10:51] own way I said but if you're trying to
[1:10:53] replicate what brother Brown was doing
[1:10:54] he said he stood yeah so anyway just a
[1:10:58] little nugget for you I was standing
[1:11:00] there in prayer and something happened
[1:11:02] and now something fell in my hand
[1:11:06] now I know if you don't understand
[1:11:08] spiritual things it may be or may seem
[1:11:10] very strange but something struck in my
[1:11:13] hand and I when I looked it was a sword
[1:11:16] now what does the sword represent
[1:11:19] the word yes amen the word the third
[1:11:22] pole the opening of the word the sword
[1:11:24] was given to him and a hand was a
[1:11:26] representation
[1:11:28] he said I looked and it was a sword and
[1:11:31] the handle was made of what
[1:11:33] you all know
[1:11:35] it's made of pearl
[1:11:37] amen the handle that is held
[1:11:40] to take the strength of the Dueler for
[1:11:44] the sword that that's the part that
[1:11:46] actually gets held by the strength of
[1:11:49] the the strength of the Dueler goes from
[1:11:52] the man to person to the handle
[1:11:55] amen the sword the sword is is like
[1:11:59] saying
[1:12:00] it's like a lot of people say today guns
[1:12:03] kill people guns don't kill people
[1:12:05] a person has to hold that gun and pull
[1:12:07] the trigger to kill the person or to
[1:12:09] shoot a bullet yeah there has to be a
[1:12:11] trigger there has to be an activation
[1:12:13] from a live human being well the sword
[1:12:16] in itself the word here is is just what
[1:12:19] it is the Bible even says itself it's a
[1:12:21] dead letter
[1:12:23] but it takes a hand of strength
[1:12:26] it takes a hand of faith on that curl
[1:12:30] on that Pearl to take the blade of the
[1:12:33] sword to the heart of the enemy
[1:12:36] praise the Lord amen
[1:12:38] the sword the handle look now again the
[1:12:41] handle was made of pearl he said the
[1:12:44] prettiest Pearl I ever seen now let me
[1:12:47] ask you this when we talk about this
[1:12:49] huge oyster making pearls for the city
[1:12:52] you think a oyster made the pearls of
[1:12:54] the handle of that sword
[1:12:57] no
[1:12:58] that is something God created amen God
[1:13:02] made this amen just like he could make
[1:13:04] anything he wants to make just like he
[1:13:06] can make this one Pearl
[1:13:09] God can make it however he wants it to
[1:13:11] be who am I to say all I know is what
[1:13:14] the Bible says the Bible says one Pearl
[1:13:17] it says one Pearl that's what I'm going
[1:13:19] to say Amen but an oyster didn't make
[1:13:22] the Pearl on the handle of this sword
[1:13:24] God made it
[1:13:26] God manufactured or whatever you would
[1:13:28] say to put the the pearl handle on this
[1:13:31] sword the prettiest brother Ram said the
[1:13:34] prettiest Pearl I've ever seen
[1:13:36] and the guard was so and so on he's
[1:13:39] talked about and
[1:13:40] um the saber blade was so long my point
[1:13:43] of it though was the handle of the sword
[1:13:45] now he goes on later and talks about it
[1:13:47] takes the strength of the Jeweler to
[1:13:50] take the sword to the heart of the enemy
[1:13:52] well the strength is nothing more than
[1:13:54] not something on your arm or your back
[1:13:56] or your body the strength is your faith
[1:13:58] yes it takes faith in the word to drive
[1:14:02] it to the heart of the enemy I hear
[1:14:04] people all the time trying to rebuke the
[1:14:07] devil when they have absolutely no place
[1:14:09] and no right to rebuke him right yes
[1:14:11] none they are standing on nothing but
[1:14:14] their own intellectual understanding
[1:14:15] right they don't have the faith that it
[1:14:18] takes to grab the Pearl on that handle
[1:14:19] and take that word to the heart of the
[1:14:21] enemy right
[1:14:23] but that Pearl is what is the controller
[1:14:26] amen without the pearl handle it's like
[1:14:29] driving a car down the street without a
[1:14:31] steering wheel which I guess you can do
[1:14:33] on both cars today but uh you you can
[1:14:37] you you can't really normally drive a
[1:14:40] car down the road unless you do
[1:14:42] something with a steering wheel
[1:14:43] the car is great maybe the most
[1:14:45] beautiful thing ever but what good is it
[1:14:48] do you don't have a steering wheel that
[1:14:49] can take it to where it wants to go see
[1:14:51] the blade on the sword is find the word
[1:14:53] but it takes faith in that word to drive
[1:14:56] it to the heart the enemy and that and
[1:14:58] that handle was The Pearl
[1:15:00] praise the Lord let's look at what that
[1:15:02] Pearl again let's get a little deeper
[1:15:04] what that Pearl would represent notice a
[1:15:07] pearl
[1:15:08] a pearl is the perfect symbol it's the
[1:15:12] perfect representation of the unity of
[1:15:15] the Bride
[1:15:16] amen although she is a mini member body
[1:15:19] she is one yes you know that the bride
[1:15:23] is one but she's a mini membered body
[1:15:26] but of one and this Pearl is the perfect
[1:15:30] representation you say how is that so
[1:15:33] because the Pearl is created the Pearl
[1:15:37] is not manufactured
[1:15:39] the Pearl comes about and is formed by
[1:15:42] what is called accretion
[1:15:44] accretion is something that takes
[1:15:47] different parts or different layers of
[1:15:50] things that are sometimes
[1:15:53] not even related
[1:15:55] and it puts on and it and it Blends them
[1:15:59] together into one perfect Unity of what
[1:16:04] we consider a beautiful pearl today
[1:16:06] but it takes a a layer upon a layer it
[1:16:10] takes one here and it takes one there it
[1:16:12] takes each one of us that makes up that
[1:16:15] Pearl and is formed together it's not
[1:16:18] mechanically made I actually wrote it
[1:16:21] down here let me just read it
[1:16:23] the Pearl is not mechanically made I of
[1:16:26] course nowadays you never know what they
[1:16:28] do and make these fake things but
[1:16:30] accretion is an organic which is natural
[1:16:34] it's a natural organic growth
[1:16:37] growing to the growing together of parts
[1:16:41] that are naturally separate
[1:16:44] amen the growing together of parts that
[1:16:47] are naturally separate that is how a
[1:16:50] pearl is formed that is how a pearl is
[1:16:53] made from parts that are normally just
[1:16:55] like you and I
[1:16:57] we come here today as one unit but we're
[1:16:59] all separate amen we're all different
[1:17:01] we're all separate units and and
[1:17:04] different units in so many ways we're
[1:17:06] different units but we come together as
[1:17:09] one under this roof under the auspice of
[1:17:12] Jesus Christ and his shed blood we come
[1:17:15] together as one and that's the perfect
[1:17:17] representation of the Bride as a whole
[1:17:21] the bride as a whole is one unit a
[1:17:24] mini-membered body from all over the
[1:17:26] world of every Kindred tongue people and
[1:17:29] Nation to make one bride to Jesus Christ
[1:17:31] yes that mystical body of Jesus Christ
[1:17:35] yes it takes accretion it takes the
[1:17:39] natural growth of the growing together
[1:17:41] of all these parts that are normally not
[1:17:44] a part of each other
[1:17:45] they're normally separate
[1:17:48] but God brings together how does he do
[1:17:50] it by one Spirit by one Spirit we are
[1:17:54] all baptized into one body
[1:17:57] amen one spirit so the holy spirit in
[1:18:00] you is the same Holy Spirit in me the
[1:18:03] same Holy Spirit over here is the same
[1:18:05] Holy Spirit over there same Holy Spirit
[1:18:07] here is the same one down the street
[1:18:08] same one down the street same one the
[1:18:10] next state next County next country next
[1:18:12] uh uh continent
[1:18:15] it's the same spirit amen and it brings
[1:18:19] us all together
[1:18:20] amen I was happy to be able to see some
[1:18:23] of my precious friends for years ago
[1:18:26] when we very first came in this message
[1:18:27] I saw we saw half a dozen people that
[1:18:30] were standing right there when me and
[1:18:31] Sonia got baptized and the Holy Ghost
[1:18:34] fell and the the church and it it was
[1:18:37] it's a precious thing to go back and
[1:18:40] remember but you know even though 2 000
[1:18:43] miles separate us
[1:18:45] we could come together and break bread
[1:18:47] and it's like we're one again it's like
[1:18:49] we never were not one again pardon the
[1:18:52] double negative we were always together
[1:18:54] always one and there'll be a time where
[1:18:57] there will be no separating there will
[1:19:00] be a time where there will be no party
[1:19:01] here on this Earth is the only thing
[1:19:03] time this what separates people from
[1:19:05] over overseas around the world different
[1:19:08] parts of the world different parts of
[1:19:09] the country
[1:19:10] people I don't even know but all one
[1:19:13] naturally separate but we're all a part
[1:19:16] of that same mystical body of Jesus
[1:19:18] Christ
[1:19:19] that's why when I pray for and I pray
[1:19:21] for the bride internationally yeah yeah
[1:19:22] the bride worldwide because God knows
[1:19:25] who they are I might not know every one
[1:19:26] of them I know I don't but God knows
[1:19:28] them and they're a part of me I'm a part
[1:19:31] of them we're all part of the same body
[1:19:33] we're all a part of that pearl of great
[1:19:35] price
[1:19:36] that Jesus Christ was willing to pay for
[1:19:39] now you see the representation of that
[1:19:41] Pearl

[1:19:59] representation of his people of the
[1:20:02] Overcomer in this city all that all
[1:20:05] those now look again all that the
[1:20:08] foundations
[1:20:10] and the gates are all on the outside
[1:20:14] surrounding this city
[1:20:17] speaking to
[1:20:18] those that are inside the city
[1:20:21] those that are inside that City are
[1:20:24] represented by all of the things that
[1:20:26] God has done out here on the outside of
[1:20:28] the city the city itself is like a brand
[1:20:31] adored for her husband we know that but
[1:20:33] God's showing himself in his Redemptive
[1:20:36] plan
[1:20:37] the man that the the the man that
[1:20:39] purchased
[1:20:41] this great treasure and this great pearl
[1:20:44] of great the pearl of great Christ has
[1:20:46] represented himself in US

[1:21:25] I kind of mentioned to you last time
[1:21:27] that that last service this one was kind
[1:21:30] of one and a half services so uh the
[1:21:34] last one was maybe a little shorter this
[1:21:36] is maybe a little shorter uh but um the
[1:21:39] only way I could figure to make it work
[1:21:42] so we're not here until two o'clock in
[1:21:44] the afternoon
[1:21:46] Ephesians chapter five let's read this
[1:21:48] one last year 25th verse
[1:21:50] husbands
[1:21:52] uh Ephesians 5 25 husbands
[1:21:56] love your wives
[1:21:58] even as Christ also loved the church and
[1:22:03] gave himself for it
[1:22:06] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:22:09] with the washing of Water by the word
[1:22:14] amen
[1:22:15] Pearl word of great value
[1:22:19] a pearl of wisdom as people would say
[1:22:24] that he might present it to himself a
[1:22:27] glorious church not having spot or
[1:22:28] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:22:31] should be holy and without full image
[1:22:33] now look at this
[1:22:35] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[1:22:37] loved the church and gave himself he
[1:22:41] gave himself now notice how perfectly
[1:22:44] that goes with what Jesus said in
[1:22:47] Matthew 13 that we just read he gave
[1:22:49] himself sold everything he had gave
[1:22:53] himself for that Pearl
[1:22:56] that he might sanctify and cleanse it by
[1:22:58] the wash of the water of the word the
[1:23:00] pearl of great price then he might do
[1:23:02] what present it us to who
[1:23:06] himself
[1:23:08] amen
[1:23:11] he does the work
[1:23:13] he cleanses he sanctifies he he saves He
[1:23:18] blesses he washes of the water of the
[1:23:20] word so that we are in the position
[1:23:24] by him to be presented to him
[1:23:29] he's doing it
[1:23:32] it's not about me
[1:23:34] it's not about us
[1:23:36] it's about him it's about all that he's
[1:23:39] done all that he still does Amen the
[1:23:42] Washi of the Water by the word to
[1:23:45] present this bride to himself
[1:23:49] but this bride now
[1:23:52] perfect yes because he gave himself for
[1:23:55] her he's the one that cleansed her he's
[1:23:58] the one that washed her he's the one
[1:24:00] that Sanctified her he's the one that
[1:24:02] put himself in her to present her to him
[1:24:07] but she now has become him
[1:24:10] and the two become one

[1:25:38] get to this place let me look at let's
[1:25:40] read let's look at this one more time
[1:25:42] and I'm going to close
[1:25:44] Revelation 21 verse 1.
[1:25:47] John said and I saw a new Heaven and a
[1:25:51] new Earth for the first Heaven and the
[1:25:52] first Earth were passed away
[1:25:54] there was no more seed and I John saw
[1:25:58] the holy city New Jerusalem coming down
[1:26:00] from God out of Heaven prepared as a
[1:26:03] bride adorned for her husband
[1:26:06] and I heard a great voice out of Heaven
[1:26:08] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[1:26:10] with men and he will dwell with them and
[1:26:13] they shall be his people and and God
[1:26:15] himself shall be with them and be their
[1:26:18] God
[1:26:19] shall wipe away all tears from their
[1:26:22] eyes and there shall be no more death
[1:26:23] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[1:26:26] there be any more pain for the former
[1:26:28] things are passed away
[1:26:30] and he that sat upon the throne said
[1:26:32] behold I make all things new and he said
[1:26:35] unto me right for these words are true
[1:26:37] and faithful
[1:26:39] he said unto me it is done I am Alpha
[1:26:41] and Omega the beginning and the end I
[1:26:43] will give unto him that is the thirst of
[1:26:45] the Fountain of Water of Life freely he
[1:26:48] that overcometh shall inherit all things
[1:26:50] you know overcome her inherit all things
[1:26:53] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[1:26:56] son but the fearful and unbelieving and
[1:26:58] abominable murders and whoremongers and
[1:27:00] Sorcerers idolaters and all liars shall
[1:27:03] have their part in the lake which
[1:27:04] burneth with fire and brimstone which is
[1:27:07] the second death there came unto me one
[1:27:09] of the Seven Angels which had the seven
[1:27:11] balls full of the seven last plagues
[1:27:14] that talk with me saying come hither I
[1:27:16] will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife

[1:31:36] St Patrick's Day or maybe it was spring
[1:31:39] break I can't remember which was just

[1:31:53] I hope you do it won't be there I
[1:31:55] promise you that that kind of thing will
[1:31:57] not be there yes but the mentality of
[1:32:00] people to think like that yes I've heard
[1:32:03] people I've heard people say
[1:32:06] if it's not like that uh all but all the
[1:32:10] fun they say they have I don't want to

[1:32:34] sisters but I'm going to read it because
[1:32:36] I read it again

[1:32:49] pros for protesting drag queen story
[1:32:53] time in the public libraries
[1:32:57] a Canadian Pastor was arrested for the
[1:32:59] second time this month as he protested a
[1:33:03] drag queen Story Time event for kids at
[1:33:07] a public library

[1:33:18] prohibited him for being within 200
[1:33:20] meters of events involving lb
[1:33:25] lgbtq community
[1:33:27] uh police say breaching 200 he was told
[1:33:31] not to come within 200 meters
[1:33:34] now this he said well this is Canada
[1:33:36] friend it's coming here too we already
[1:33:38] know this is already happening here uh
[1:33:41] we we have a voice in this country
[1:33:43] that's come out against I'll just leave
[1:33:45] it at that that's come out against that
[1:33:47] uh and God bless his heart uh he used to
[1:33:51] be an actor I can't remember his name

[1:34:04] things of Godly things of this Christian
[1:34:06] book that that that he wrote to help
[1:34:08] instill some Godly values in them and he

[1:34:13] him come and do this yes
[1:34:14] yes they'll allow the other but they
[1:34:17] won't allow this now what do you think
[1:34:18] about a public facility that's garnering
[1:34:22] the attention of the children today
[1:34:24] that'll allow them to watch and
[1:34:27] participate in a drag queen show but not
[1:34:30] something that's Godly holy Christian
[1:34:31] wholesome
[1:34:33] where are we
[1:34:36] how much how much later
[1:34:39] can it go how much further can it go how
[1:34:43] brother Ram talked about the cup of
[1:34:45] iniquity how how
[1:34:47] much more can there be that this cup can
[1:34:51] take right but before it's flooding over
[1:34:54] I
[1:34:55] I know he looks through a different set
[1:34:57] of eyes and I'm glad he does
[1:35:00] uh because there was a time when I was
[1:35:01] lost and I'm glad he had mercy and uh
[1:35:05] long-suffering for me to come in and
[1:35:07] maybe there's one more I don't know
[1:35:10] but whatever it is friends we're done

[1:35:22] UK the UK they're they're 10 times worse
[1:35:26] than we are yes with this field
[1:35:29] and and it's become mainstream yes and
[1:35:32] people are coming to the places like oh
[1:35:34] you know accepting of it this word this
[1:35:38] Bible to to a large portion of this
[1:35:42] country is nothing anymore
[1:35:45] it doesn't mean anything to you right
[1:35:47] you look at the watered-down versions
[1:35:49] that people have tried to interpret off
[1:35:51] of the scripture to make it sound like
[1:35:54] something that it is not to justify
[1:35:57] their their their Lifestyles and the way
[1:35:59] they want to live and do and act
[1:36:02] God
[1:36:04] how much longer yes amen
[1:36:07] I I just it blows you it blows my mind
[1:36:12] to understand certain things and and and
[1:36:16] why and how things are going on the way
[1:36:19] that they're going uh I I I I'll never
[1:36:22] understand God help me I know I'm old
[1:36:25] but I'll never understand how women
[1:36:27] think something's sticking out of their
[1:36:29] nose and eyelashes that look like Daddy
[1:36:31] Long Legs looks attractive
[1:36:34] I I I'll probably never understand that
[1:36:37] I mean
[1:36:38] we walked out of a place the other day I
[1:36:41] forgot uh I think it was I was at work
[1:36:44] we went to lunch and I told the guys I
[1:36:46] said if you're hot just go stand in
[1:36:48] front of this girl who y'all just tell
[1:36:50] her to Blink
[1:36:52] our eyelashes I I couldn't believe it
[1:36:57] today
[1:36:58] I stand back
[1:37:00] I'm exaggerating but it's just gotten so
[1:37:03] bad yes it's just and and remember what
[1:37:06] brother Madam said you want to know the
[1:37:09] condition of the church look at what the
[1:37:11] women look at the women how they act
[1:37:13] today
[1:37:15] amen tattooed all up and pierced and all
[1:37:18] in
[1:37:19] amen that's that's the way it is and
[1:37:22] those are souls and I pray for their
[1:37:24] souls I I I don't want any of them go to
[1:37:26] hell right but it shows the condition of
[1:37:29] the day that we live yes God help us
[1:37:31] believe it's time amen well make sure
[1:37:35] we're in the place we should be with him
[1:37:36] amen amen more than anything
[1:37:39] more than anything praise the Lord
[1:37:43] let's sing this course amen
[1:37:46] Lord prepare me
[1:37:49] to be a sanctuary

[1:39:45] and said you know brother you and your
[1:39:47] awful hard
[1:39:50] sometimes I don't think we're hard
[1:39:52] enough but could you imagine what
[1:39:53] brother Brandon would say under the
[1:39:54] condition s going into the world today
[1:39:55] knowing what he said 50 years ago 50
[1:39:58] almost 60 years ago what do you think he
[1:40:00] would say if you were in this world like
[1:40:02] I I I'm rough
[1:40:04] oh my God
[1:40:06] for the condition of what there was in
[1:40:09] the 60s
[1:40:12] when I was young
[1:40:14] going to school
[1:40:17] guys didn't look like they looked today
[1:40:18] they're all over the place and ponytails
[1:40:21] and buns and all this stuff and it
[1:40:23] looked like
[1:40:24] pardon me but I'm at the perverts
[1:40:27] it looked like that wine because a girl
[1:40:29] would look at a guy like that
[1:40:32] so a guy looked decent and okay to try
[1:40:35] to have to try to attract a female
[1:40:37] if he looked like that but nowadays does
[1:40:41] that matter in fact sometimes it seems
[1:40:43] like the crazier the more they're
[1:40:45] attracted to him and just some just the
[1:40:47] opposite
[1:40:48] when I was going to school if a girl had
[1:40:51] something hanging out her nose a guy
[1:40:52] wouldn't look twice at her
[1:40:54] so she didn't do it because she knew it
[1:40:56] she wanted to track the guy she didn't
[1:40:58] look like that and that's
[1:41:01] gonna have tattoos all up and down
[1:41:03] no God would look at her you know what
[1:41:05] no God would give her the time of day
[1:41:07] unless it were a Hell's Angel biker or
[1:41:09] something they might
[1:41:12] and kept it that way and now it's just
[1:41:15] it it's just all it's the horse rider
