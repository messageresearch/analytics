[27:39] measure that but anyway it's his body
[27:41] it's his heart but he's feeling much
[27:43] much better doing much better uh so I
[27:46] didn't expect him to be here as kind of
[27:48] soon to be here after opening up your
[27:50] chest uh but they usually watch so God
[27:53] bless you brother Pat please remember
[27:55] him in prayer if you would uh also
[27:58] I had not heard from Sister Julie uh
[28:01] yesterday this morning please pray for
[28:02] her miss her obviously of course when
[28:04] she's not here uh very much so please
[28:07] remember her in prayer also brother Dany
[28:09] wrote a
[28:11] request uh for his friend Ron who lives
[28:14] in the apartments with
[28:16] him he went to the hospital where they
[28:19] removed a blockage from his bow duck
[28:22] when they released him he was told that
[28:25] to see an oncologist
[28:28] uh this coming Monday to find out if it
[28:30] was cancerous or not and so brother
[28:33] Danny's prayer our prayer for this man
[28:35] Ron is that the test will come back
[28:39] benign negative for cancer so let's
[28:42] remember that in prayer if you would um
[28:45] also uh brother Dennis wrote a request
[28:47] out here that he had
[28:50] mentioned um uh that he wanted us to
[28:53] know he said please continue to keep me
[28:56] up in prayers
[28:58] I have been blessed to be over with the
[29:01] shingles but now I'm dealing with um I
[29:05] have to look it up on my phone to get
[29:07] the the medical name of it uh some kind
[29:11] of Neurology neur neuropathy
[29:14] neuropathy uh let me just find that I
[29:17] think it's a little more involved
[29:20] because I have neuropathy in my hands
[29:22] yeah not it's not neurop it's it's
[29:25] neurolog something of post herpetic uh
[29:30] neuralgia yes that is a lasting pain in
[29:34] the areas of your skin where you had
[29:37] shingles uh this is the medical thing
[29:39] brother Dennis sent me he said around
[29:41] one in five people with shingles will
[29:44] get post post herpetic
[29:47] neuralgia uh people aged 50 over
[29:50] particularly at RIS many people with
[29:53] this make a full recovery within a year
[29:57] but symptoms occasionally last for
[30:00] several years or may be permanent uh and
[30:03] that being said I will read you what the
[30:06] rest of what brother Dennis wrote is
[30:08] dealing with that uh post herpetic
[30:12] neuralgia which is very hard to cope
[30:15] with I'm constantly dealing with sharp
[30:18] pains and aching discomfort and I was
[30:22] told it would take one and three month
[30:24] one to three months to get over this and
[30:27] with some uh and with some even over a
[30:30] year I am believing as we agree together
[30:34] that I'll be over this next week and be
[30:37] back in fellowship with all of you
[30:39] Believers God bless you brother Dennis
[30:42] amen so that is our prayer as well we're
[30:44] going to believe that as well and trust
[30:46] that that's the Lord going to touch has
[30:49] already touched continue to touch help
[30:51] brother Dennis amen and bless him with
[30:53] this situation and take the pain away
[30:55] from him uh I found out
[30:58] yesterday uh that it's I guess not
[31:01] necessarily an urgent prayer request but
[31:02] for some reason when I was in here
[31:04] studying I had an old friend of mine
[31:07] from work uh he didn't work where I did
[31:09] but he was a sales consultant that
[31:10] called on me uh he died he passed away
[31:15] seven years ago he just came on my heart
[31:17] so I decided to Google him and it was a
[31:19] whole article from mad that was on there
[31:23] uh and apparently May of 2016 he was
[31:27] riding his motorcycle a guy pulled out
[31:29] from a bar ran over a curb ran over the
[31:32] sidewalk right out in front of him uh
[31:34] motorcycle hit him uh laid on the street
[31:37] dying the man gets out of his car walks
[31:39] around goes back in the bar and my
[31:42] friend laid there on the on the concrete
[31:44] dying uh he did die as uh as a result of
[31:48] his wounds and he was a very good friend
[31:50] of mine um and I just pray that you his
[31:53] he actually that had actually been the
[31:56] day that his daughter had graduated from
[31:59] high school they were C celebrating
[32:01] their daughter's graduation from high
[32:03] school so it's quite a quite a blow I
[32:05] know it's been seven years ago seven and
[32:07] a half years uh but uh his wife's name's
[32:10] Lisa the daughter's named Reagan please
[32:12] pray for them uh it just it came kind of
[32:15] a blow to me uh just don't expect that
[32:18] he was a little older than I was but
[32:20] just don't expect those things to happen
[32:22] like that when you do and that way it
[32:25] just grips your heart so uh kind of kind
[32:28] of was a tough blow for me yesterday to
[32:30] hear about that so I hadn't spoke to him
[32:32] since we left Charlotte but he was still
[32:36] a good friend of mine and u i just pra
[32:40] that he was good to me he's in the arms

[43:54] of um since we've gone into uh this
[44:00] message God in Simplicity we've been on
[44:02] false teachers first couple of Parts
[44:05] we're on part three
[44:06] today um actually back before

[44:14] part three of this uh false
[44:17] teachers uh back before Thanksgiving
[44:20] then we had Thanksgiving Thanksgiving
[44:22] message and then a couple of services
[44:24] off so uh the Lord willing would try to
[44:26] get back into this uh try to if we can
[44:30] maybe sort of pick up before we left off
[44:32] but we'll go back to Matthew chapter 11
[44:34] verse 25 uh that we use of scripture to
[44:38] begin this uh subject this topic God in
[44:41] Simplicity amen before we read the word
[44:43] can we bow our heads for another word of
[44:45] prayer Lord Jesus father it is indeed a

[45:05] we're most of all thankful for you
[45:07] father and your spirit being here doing
[45:10] exceeding and abundantly above all that
[45:12] we could ever ask or think depending on

[46:00] does not return void but accomplish what
[46:03] you have it set forth for today as we
[46:05] give you praise honor and glory for it
[46:08] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[46:10] pray
[46:11] amen Matthew
[46:13] 11:25 amen it says at that time Jesus
[46:17] answered and said I thank thee old
[46:19] father Lord of Heaven and Earth because
[46:21] thou has hid these things from the wise
[46:22] and prudent and has revealed them unto
[46:25] bath
[46:26] praise the Lord you could be seated if
[46:28] you'd like those who may remember uh the
[46:31] last time that we were here and spoke
[46:33] through the second
[46:35] part amen of false teachers the way that
[46:39] the false teaching comes so many times
[46:42] uh uh
[46:45] becomes
[46:46] uh more complicated more difficult
[46:50] harder to understand uh for a common
[46:53] person for a regular person or lot a lot
[46:55] of times for almost anybody to be able
[46:58] to understand and uh we mentioned at
[47:02] that last time that we were going to get
[47:05] uh this time was going to become very
[47:06] personal it's going to become very close
[47:09] to us uh and and it's the topic that's
[47:14] hard to deal with sometimes and hard to
[47:16] bring up you don't really want to
[47:18] mention it or say anything about it but
[47:20] the fact of the matter is it is
[47:23] true it is true today just like it was
[47:26] true in the scripture just like it was
[47:27] true when brother Brandon was here just
[47:29] like it was true when Paul said what he
[47:31] said about Grievious wolves coming in
[47:33] sparing not the flock it's still true
[47:36] regardless and as hard as it is the
[47:38] scripture tells us this amen so let's go
[47:41] over to Second Peter amen uh we'll read
[47:45] beginning at the 2 chapter first verse
[47:48] second Peter
[47:52] 2:1 this is not to ward off anything
[47:55] about
[47:56] uh uh anyone in particular anything I I
[48:00] know I have mentioned before uh that uh
[48:04] Paul called Nam scripture uh in a couple
[48:07] of places brother brandom had got to the
[48:10] place that right before the Lord took
[48:11] him he was planning on calling some
[48:13] names out of people and um I I don't
[48:16] feel at Liberty to do that nor would I
[48:20] uh of course it would only be something
[48:22] that would be uh my observation any with
[48:25] anyway without a revelation from the
[48:27] Lord uh but the fact that it does happen
[48:30] is just the warning that the scripture
[48:32] gives us it's not something that I'm
[48:34] trying to promote as an overall scare
[48:37] you of other ministers or anything like
[48:39] that but it's just a warning it's a
[48:41] warning through the scripture it's a
[48:43] warning to understand that even in our
[48:45] own ranks today even in this message
[48:49] that the same thing persists and it's
[48:51] here uh and and and and the Lord allows
[48:54] it to be that way
[48:56] amen there's something that brings and
[48:58] causes a
[48:59] separation uh between and remember the
[49:02] whole bottom line of this isn't Church
[49:05] it isn't Fellowship it isn't having a
[49:08] place to go it isn't a pastor it isn't
[49:10] the people around you it isn't all these
[49:13] things that we do that are that are
[49:14] really mainly pump in circumstance that
[49:17] surround everything that we uh do as
[49:19] Christians the bottom line of being a
[49:22] Christian the bottom line of being a
[49:23] Bible believing God-fearing Holy Ghost
[49:26] filled Christian is the word that's the
[49:29] bottom line to all of this to everything
[49:31] that we do uh to all the services to uh
[49:35] the Sunday school and to the attendance
[49:37] and to the fellowship and all the things
[49:38] we enjoy together the meals we have
[49:41] together and the time we spend and the
[49:42] fellowship and the relying upon one
[49:45] another for prayer requests and things
[49:46] like that the bottom line of the whole
[49:49] thing of being a Christian is the word
[49:51] and that's the bottom line that's that's
[49:53] where it all settles to and ends up up
[49:56] is the word and that's the most
[49:57] important thing because Christ is the
[49:59] word amen Christ is the word without
[50:01] Christ the revelation of that word then
[50:04] what does any of it do for us it's a
[50:07] nice I guess maybe it be a nice life to
[50:09] live but what's the end result the end
[50:12] result for us is we want to be in a
[50:14] rapture we want to go to heaven we want
[50:16] to be with our lord Jesus our savior our
[50:19] loved ones that have gone on before
[50:20] that's what we want that's what our our
[50:23] whole point of being here is to is to uh
[50:27] have that goal and to have that aim to
[50:29] end up at that place that's the whole
[50:32] thing people choose different ways they
[50:35] choose different thoughts they different
[50:37] denominations different churches uh so
[50:40] many people uh there's only one way and
[50:44] that is Jesus Christ but there's
[50:46] thousands and thousands and thousands of
[50:48] ways that people have conjured within
[50:50] themselves to get to that one place amen
[50:53] it's amazing how that comes about but
[50:55] the fact is that the Lord the Lord
[50:58] Deliver Us that are his delivers us all
[51:02] amen delivers us all that belong to him
[51:05] uh but the most important thing here not
[51:07] to notice is the word and that's the one
[51:10] thing that that Paul called out if you
[51:13] notice you look at the names that Paul
[51:15] called in Scripture it was because of
[51:17] false Doctrine if you look at the
[51:19] warning that Jesus gave uh through the
[51:22] church ages it was because of what false
[51:25] Doctrine what was it when brother
[51:27] brandham was here it it it it's like
[51:30] when brother brandham talked about uh
[51:32] Martin Luther holding his head above all
[51:34] the fanaticism see but he had to stay it
[51:37] wasn't the fanaticism it was staying
[51:39] straight on that word that message that
[51:42] God gave him the just shall live by
[51:44] faith all this other stuff swirling
[51:46] around was just that same thing with
[51:48] brother brand people calling him God and
[51:51] baptizing his name and all this
[51:52] falseness all these things that are
[51:54] wrong and and people out there today
[51:57] saying how wrong this message is saying
[51:59] how wrong brother brandom was and all
[52:01] just swirling around the bottom line is
[52:04] to get the message out to get the word
[52:07] out to let this word this this truth
[52:09] come and permeate into a group of
[52:11] people's hearts and lives and change
[52:14] their lives so that those people are the
[52:17] people the people of God are the people
[52:19] that God sent him for to bring this word
[52:22] so that Christ could live in us so that
[52:24] that word would take pretence in our
[52:26] hearts no false Doctrine none of this
[52:29] other that's all out and all all the
[52:31] even the fellowship and stuff we have
[52:34] all that's great and fine but that's not
[52:36] what it's about it's about Christ in
[52:38] Christ the word amen and so when it
[52:41] comes to this this
[52:43] warning Peter gives here now Peter
[52:46] doesn't call names but he's very
[52:48] specific chapter 2 verse one but there
[52:52] were false prophets all also among the
[52:56] people
[52:57] where among the people what false
[53:00] prophets where among the people amen now
[53:05] that's obviously talking about the
[53:07] people that they had had fellowship with
[53:10] people they had we'll just say today
[53:12] church with people they rub elbows with
[53:15] people they listen to ministering from
[53:19] amen false prophets among those people
[53:22] again I'm not trying to scare you I'm
[53:24] just trying to help understand this is a
[53:26] part of life it's a part of of a warning
[53:29] of the scripture amen this is scripture
[53:32] that we are to be aware of Amen make
[53:35] sure that when we are on the word that
[53:38] that word is coming from the scripture
[53:40] amen which we know the message brother
[53:42] Brandon brought was from the word praise
[53:45] the Lord now false prophets also among
[53:49] the
[53:50] people said it was going to get personal
[53:52] Saints amen right among the people
[53:55] people even as there shall be false
[53:59] teachers among
[54:02] you amen now that's getting really
[54:05] personal Peter's telling us very
[54:07] personally here there's going to be
[54:11] there shall be false
[54:14] teachers among you Among Us that's what
[54:19] it is now look remember we've talked
[54:22] about this several times I've mentioned
[54:23] this the Bible says that it was be so
[54:25] close it would deceive the very elect if
[54:27] possible we know denomination is not
[54:30] close we know the Catholic church is not
[54:32] close we know these things out in the
[54:34] world and the government all this stuff
[54:36] all those things they're not close not
[54:39] close enough that would deceive the very
[54:41] elect yes charismatic Calvary churches
[54:44] all those those aren't close enough to
[54:46] that that would deceive you right you
[54:49] know better than that that's not
[54:51] anything that would deceive you but what
[54:53] would be so close that it would deceive
[54:56] the El if it were possible that would be
[54:59] just like it was at the beginning when
[55:02] Satan brought 99% truth to Eve that 99%
[55:07] truth would be the thing that would
[55:09] bring the deception for this last day
[55:12] through false teachers false teachers
[55:15] what does a teacher do he teaches or
[55:18] even she of course she wouldn't be
[55:21] deceptive enough to a Believer uh to uh
[55:24] uh to deceive you but it would be a a
[55:28] false teacher that would teach what
[55:31] false Doctrine yeah false Doctrine can
[55:35] be anything that is 99% truth or less
[55:41] because anything less than 100% is a
[55:44] false Doctrine it's something that's
[55:45] been added to something that's been
[55:47] changed something that's been
[55:49] interjected by a man's opinion thought
[55:51] idea whatever it is that brings in a do
[55:55] Dogma not a Doctrine not a scriptural
[55:58] Doctrine but a Dogma because a Dogma is
[56:01] something
[56:02] man-made a Doctrine is something
[56:04] god-given a Dogma is something that's
[56:07] man-made and a Dogma is not what we live
[56:10] by it's not what we go by we don't want
[56:12] any man's idea interjected into the
[56:15] scripture we want it to be the word and
[56:18] the word only praise the Lord
[56:21] so false teachers among you who
[56:25] privately or privy privately shall bring
[56:28] in damnable heresies again it you think
[56:33] 99% is really good 99% of almost
[56:37] anything else is wonderful I
[56:40] mean if you hit if you hit 99% of
[56:43] bowling pins you'd be on the PGA tour or
[56:46] the PBA tour you'd be a professional
[56:49] bowler if you hit uh a uh we'll just say
[56:54] any if you hit a if you get a a a base
[56:57] hit 99% of the time you come up to bat
[56:59] you're going to be the best baseball
[57:01] player ever 99 seems like a lot that's
[57:05] that's that seems like a great
[57:06] percentage but 99% you call it a dandel
[57:10] heresy yeah because 99% is exactly what
[57:14] it took to throw this whole world into
[57:17] the chaotic state that it's in today
[57:19] yeah
[57:20] 99% praise the Lord so yes it could be a
[57:23] deceiving her Y which is what that means
[57:27] amen it means to be deceptive it means
[57:30] to be destructive a heresy that's
[57:33] destructive a Dogma that's destructive
[57:36] that's brought in by false teachers that
[57:39] are among the people that are even among
[57:42] you praise the
[57:44] Lord even denying the Lord that bought
[57:49] them and bring upon themselves Swift
[57:53] destruction well of course they deny
[57:54] deny the Lord if they deny the word if
[57:57] they're bringing 99 or less per of the
[58:00] word of course they deny the Lord Jesus
[58:03] because they're denying the word If you
[58:05] deny any part of the word Genesis 1 to
[58:08] revelation 22 If you deny any part of
[58:12] that word you're denying Jesus Christ
[58:15] well of course you say well is that deny
[58:17] the Lord of course they do it they deny
[58:19] the word they deny the Lord and those
[58:22] that follow them and believe their
[58:25] pernicious ways believe their Dogma
[58:28] teaching it might sound good to the
[58:30] flesh Saints but it's not God's word
[58:34] actually most of the time if it's
[58:36] something that you hear that's pleasing
[58:38] to the flesh is probably not coming from
[58:41] the purity of God's word amen because
[58:44] most of the word isn't meant to be good
[58:46] to the flesh it's good for the soul not
[58:49] for the flesh amen God's word's good for
[58:52] the soul it's soul food not not natural
[58:55] food it's soul food it's food for the
[58:57] soul praise the Lord amen so of course
[59:01] they deny the word they deny Christ
[59:03] that's that
[59:05] simple but now the worst part about this
[59:07] is not only are there going to be false
[59:10] teachers or they are false teachers we
[59:13] nowh at the end so we're not looking
[59:15] something in the future way out it's
[59:17] here has to be we at the end the worst
[59:20] part is verse two and
[59:23] many many any shall follow their
[59:27] pernicious ways that's destructive
[59:29] pernicious is is uh is is uh uh the end
[59:34] of Destruction amen the the death is the
[59:38] end of that predition is what it comes
[59:41] from pernicious predition that end of
[59:45] Destruction many shall follow their
[59:48] pernicious Ways by reason of whom the
[59:53] way of Truth shall be evil spoken of Now
[59:56] isn't that just the truth that's
[59:58] happening today more and more all the
[1:00:00] time the way of Truth what's the way of
[1:00:02] truth that we have for this day the
[1:00:05] message the message that God brought
[1:00:08] through a prophet is the way that we
[1:00:11] have today that's being evil spoken
[1:00:15] of uh me and my wife had this discussion
[1:00:19] well we've had it several times but we
[1:00:20] had it just the other day of a of people
[1:00:24] that leave the message and most of these
[1:00:27] people when they leave the message they
[1:00:30] can't just go off and live their lives
[1:00:32] they they've got to slander and put down
[1:00:35] and ridicule and say horrible evil nasty
[1:00:39] demonic things about it and about
[1:00:41] brother bradam and about his
[1:00:44] family they say why if if you don't
[1:00:47] believe this then I'm sorry you don't
[1:00:50] but you know uh
[1:00:53] bye
[1:00:55] but they can't do that it has to be
[1:00:58] something that becomes an object of what
[1:01:00] they are speaking evil of of the truth
[1:01:04] this truth has become something that's a
[1:01:07] focal point of what their evil speaking
[1:01:10] is about and they've left the message
[1:01:13] they've denounced the truth they've
[1:01:15] denounced the prophet and yet now
[1:01:18] they've got to speak evil of it and many
[1:01:21] follow these ways amen now
[1:01:25] evil can be brought in different ways it
[1:01:28] can be brought as in people that have
[1:01:30] left and it can be people that remember
[1:01:32] we talked about last week uh or the last
[1:01:36] time we spoke on this uh second
[1:01:38] Thessalonians remember second
[1:01:40] Thessalonians there's a great falling
[1:01:43] away but recognize uh the understanding
[1:01:47] that I I could absolutely be wrong but
[1:01:51] the thought the process the possibility
[1:01:54] forgot to start my phone here the
[1:01:57] possibility that that falling away isn't
[1:02:00] people leaving church it isn't
[1:02:02] altogether necessarily people leaving
[1:02:05] the message but people leaving the
[1:02:08] fundamental foundation of the of the
[1:02:11] doctrine of the Church of the of this
[1:02:13] message that they're leaving they leave
[1:02:16] away from the word which is verse one
[1:02:20] they've left the word they've Fallen
[1:02:23] away from their first love as Jesus told
[1:02:27] them in in the first church age they've
[1:02:29] Fallen away from their first Love Gone
[1:02:32] Away from the word to hybrid something
[1:02:35] for whatever reason uh it it seems like
[1:02:38] it's got to become more complicated so
[1:02:40] more people believe it uh it's got to be
[1:02:43] more educated it's got to be more highly
[1:02:47] intellectual uh it's got to be something
[1:02:49] that that is harder for people to attain
[1:02:52] so they they assume that it's got to to
[1:02:54] be right because how could he preach
[1:02:57] like that if it wasn't
[1:02:59] true or remember the the the rain falls
[1:03:02] on the just and the unjust you say how
[1:03:05] can they preach like that by the same
[1:03:06] anointing that I'm preaching this
[1:03:08] morning by the same anointing that falls
[1:03:10] on uh the Wheats and the tears the same
[1:03:13] anointing that's Fallen across the city
[1:03:15] the same is Fallen Across the Nation on
[1:03:18] true Brothers on on on everybody on the
[1:03:21] true and the false of course they can do
[1:03:23] that amen but they bring about their own
[1:03:26] way their own ideas their own thoughts
[1:03:30] many are
[1:03:32] following those pricious ways those
[1:03:36] dangerous
[1:03:37] ways by the way which the truth is being
[1:03:41] evil spoken of amen and this message
[1:03:44] today is probably more so since it was
[1:03:47] introduced being evil spoken of than at
[1:03:49] any time that people are walking away
[1:03:52] from it leaving it having having nothing
[1:03:54] to do with it but speaking evil about it
[1:03:57] it's sad but
[1:04:00] many many are folling following that way
[1:04:04] that's why it's a very Stark warning to
[1:04:07] understand I friend I don't want to be
[1:04:09] one of those
[1:04:11] people I don't I don't want to be one
[1:04:13] that falls by the side to by 99%
[1:04:19] truth but be on the
[1:04:21] word settled in the word the truth the
[1:04:26] message that derived from this scripture
[1:04:29] amen people say there's contrary things
[1:04:32] well brother bandam contradicted himself
[1:04:34] here well I can show you a hundred
[1:04:36] places that people think the Bible
[1:04:38] contradicts itself amen so if you're
[1:04:42] going to say one contradicts the other
[1:04:44] without Revelation then you can
[1:04:46] certainly say this contradicts itself
[1:04:49] without Revelation it all contradictory
[1:04:52] but what does it do it separates divides
[1:04:55] the unbeliever from the make believer
[1:04:57] make Believer from the
[1:04:59] believer amen remember those three
[1:05:02] classes of people are were to go
[1:05:05] together up till the end they were a lot
[1:05:07] of in a lot of ways look a lot alike of
[1:05:09] course the believe the make believer and
[1:05:10] the believer amen unbeliever is just
[1:05:13] always an unbeliever but the make
[1:05:14] believer and the believer gone along
[1:05:17] together amen for all this time that
[1:05:19] there's something that brings the
[1:05:21] separation just like there's a there
[1:05:24] something that brings the separation
[1:05:25] between the foolish virgin and the wise
[1:05:27] virgin what is it it's the oil amen the
[1:05:31] Holy Spirit praise God that separates
[1:05:34] those two that brings truth in third
[1:05:39] verse
[1:05:41] now and and through
[1:05:46] covetousness that's evil Lust by the way
[1:05:49] through covetousness shall they with
[1:05:52] Fain words that's good molded words
[1:05:55] great speaker
[1:05:57] orator shall they with feigned words
[1:06:01] make merchandise of you whose judgment
[1:06:05] now of a long time linger not and their
[1:06:09] damnation Slumber Earth not so this and
[1:06:14] those people through covetousness
[1:06:17] through lustful thinking through lustful
[1:06:19] ideas through through through the flesh
[1:06:22] the desires of the flesh
[1:06:24] convince people through their lust make
[1:06:28] merchandise because that's that that's
[1:06:30] the heartest desire to want to do it
[1:06:32] because notice if a person that's a
[1:06:34] Believer what did Brother green always
[1:06:36] say the the bride cannot be deceived
[1:06:39] amen she can there can be some to go
[1:06:42] along for a while but God will bring to
[1:06:45] her attention and reveal to her a bride
[1:06:47] member someone that belongs to him bring
[1:06:50] to her into that place where she's
[1:06:53] supposed to be to recognize something's
[1:06:55] not right something's going on here that
[1:06:58] is not right and that person will pull
[1:07:00] away and leave away from anything that's
[1:07:04] that's 99% truth or less let's just put
[1:07:06] it that way amen but they make
[1:07:09] merchandise of the others because
[1:07:11] there's something in that person that
[1:07:13] wanted that anyway people go along for a
[1:07:16] while but deep down in there you can
[1:07:18] only hide it for so long deep down in
[1:07:20] there there's something that always
[1:07:22] wanted this and when
[1:07:24] it's brought out and brought forth how
[1:07:26] do you think all these Cults come to
[1:07:28] fruition you think we look at it and say
[1:07:31] how could someone have fallen for this
[1:07:33] man how could someone have gone down uh
[1:07:36] to a different country or drank this
[1:07:38] stuff or acted this way or how could
[1:07:41] someone become a part of that and you
[1:07:43] look at it and think uh that that that
[1:07:46] how could because they they pray upon
[1:07:49] the people who have that desire in their
[1:07:52] heart already
[1:07:55] they pray upon of course the lonely and
[1:07:58] the destitute and and the people that
[1:08:00] feel worthless or the people that feel
[1:08:02] like they're unloved they pray upon
[1:08:04] those people but there's something in
[1:08:05] there that that that that message
[1:08:08] reaches out to them whatever their
[1:08:10] message is that reaches out to something
[1:08:12] that's in their a desire of theirs that
[1:08:15] they want to do it becomes a
[1:08:17] merchandising it's kind of a strange
[1:08:20] word in the scripture but that's what it
[1:08:22] is they become a part of that because
[1:08:24] it's something that they've always
[1:08:26] wanted it's it's a part of what their
[1:08:28] life or what they've wanted to do amen
[1:08:31] look at brother bam says several
[1:08:34] places and and gives warning himself but
[1:08:38] let me read a couple of things to help
[1:08:40] us here God hiding and revealing himself
[1:08:42] in
[1:08:46] Simplicity he brings it very
[1:08:49] clear he said those
[1:08:52] men uh who had been taught a man could
[1:08:55] not be a teacher a priest until he was
[1:08:58] born in a certain lineage after Levi so
[1:09:02] forth and just think his great great
[1:09:05] great great great great great
[1:09:07] grandfather was a priest laying right in
[1:09:10] that word in that Temple day and night
[1:09:13] like the Catholic priest or Minister
[1:09:15] that's handed down Minister from
[1:09:18] generations to the certain churches so
[1:09:21] forth my great great grandfather was a
[1:09:23] miss
[1:09:24] a Methodist Bishop my grandfather was a
[1:09:26] bishop and so forth amen just like the
[1:09:29] same idea that people have about
[1:09:32] politics well my great granddaddy my
[1:09:34] granddaddy my they were all Democrats
[1:09:36] I'll be a Democrat they're all
[1:09:37] Republicans so I'll be a republican they
[1:09:39] were all Baptist so I'll be a Baptist
[1:09:40] they were all my whole family we were
[1:09:42] all Methodist so I'll be a Methodist too
[1:09:44] it follows that same line of thinking
[1:09:46] that he's talking
[1:09:48] about all that lives right in the word
[1:09:52] lives right in in the word but they had
[1:09:55] formed their own way of it which is
[1:09:59] exactly what Peter's warning was they
[1:10:01] had formed their own way of their own
[1:10:04] way not God's way their own
[1:10:08] way and their children had accepted it
[1:10:12] in such a way that the fathers had
[1:10:13] taught it until the fathers had taught
[1:10:16] it off the real way they made such an
[1:10:20] organization out of it till when the
[1:10:23] Spirit tried to present the truth they
[1:10:27] could not receive it and that's the same
[1:10:31] thing today that got of course brother
[1:10:34] Ram's talking about his time his age
[1:10:36] when he was here what he was dealing
[1:10:38] with through denominations and people
[1:10:41] coming and raising and being going to
[1:10:43] seminaries and Baptists and methodists
[1:10:45] and Catholics and and and all this that
[1:10:48] they had been part of and so it was a
[1:10:49] hard nut if you will to crack because
[1:10:52] brother random saw it how men had
[1:10:55] developed this denominations had
[1:10:57] developed this and they had made their
[1:10:59] own way of it laying in the scripture he
[1:11:01] says day and night day and night amen
[1:11:05] they had made their own way of it so
[1:11:07] when truth had got themselves so built
[1:11:10] up in this that even when truth actual
[1:11:13] scriptural truth Vindicated truth come
[1:11:17] and present itself they would not listen
[1:11:22] they could not receive it they did not
[1:11:25] he said they could not receive it and
[1:11:28] that's the same thing
[1:11:30] today the same thing going on
[1:11:33] today now what did Brother bam say what
[1:11:35] did Paul say after my departure Grievous
[1:11:38] wolves will come in not sparing the
[1:11:39] flock and that's exactly what happened
[1:11:41] when Paul left it's exactly what's
[1:11:44] happened after brother brandom left and
[1:11:46] now even more so now that you see the
[1:11:49] brothers that was with brother brandom
[1:11:51] going away amen like the brother Muse
[1:11:53] and the brother greens and these that
[1:11:55] are going away more and more you see it
[1:11:57] even that much more amen even after
[1:12:00] brother brandom had went away he says I
[1:12:03] don't mean to be rude but it's right
[1:12:06] it's the same thing today they make it
[1:12:08] so
[1:12:10] complicated some other way they teach it
[1:12:13] just like it been said but God don't
[1:12:16] have any grandchildren you know that God
[1:12:18] has sons and daughters and his sons and
[1:12:21] daughters listen to his word amen they
[1:12:23] believe his word praise the Lord the
[1:12:27] indictment strong message if you haven't
[1:12:29] listened to it
[1:12:32] indictment look at this now when it
[1:12:34] separates there is bound to be some
[1:12:37] basic reason that we're not together
[1:12:39] it's studying in studying it I realize
[1:12:42] in studying it it's not the colors of
[1:12:44] our skin because yellow black brown
[1:12:48] white all separate different
[1:12:49] organizations it's not the kind of food
[1:12:52] we eat we all eat the the same food we
[1:12:54] wear the same clothes and so forth but I
[1:12:56] see where basically it's at is man who
[1:13:00] has gotten off the beaten path of the
[1:13:03] teaching of the Gospel off the beaten
[1:13:07] path of the teaching of the Gospel amen
[1:13:10] not a man's idea not a denomination not
[1:13:12] a seminary but off the
[1:13:14] gospel man has gotten off the gospel now
[1:13:18] you've got people that are that are over
[1:13:21] their heads in politics and still call
[1:13:23] call themselves Reverend look a minister
[1:13:26] a reverend has no business being if he's
[1:13:30] a true minister in politics he doesn't
[1:13:35] no room on TV no room running for office
[1:13:38] you see them they run for office I know
[1:13:40] they probably get in their heart say
[1:13:42] they want to do something good they want
[1:13:43] to change things friends I I can get
[1:13:46] that but he has no business not a true a
[1:13:49] minister has no business being in that
[1:13:52] venue God God's gave him a venue if he's
[1:13:55] a true Minister and it's right behind a
[1:13:56] pull pit preaching this gospel amen
[1:14:00] that's where it belongs praise the Lord
[1:14:03] they've gotten off the beaten path of
[1:14:05] teaching the gospel each man there ought
[1:14:08] to be the same way to definitely show
[1:14:10] which is right and wrong and the only
[1:14:12] way you'll ever do it is not put any
[1:14:15] interpretation to the word just we just
[1:14:17] read it the way it is believe it the way
[1:14:20] it is and hold to that word the way it
[1:14:22] is amen how do they do they take many
[1:14:26] people believe those pernicious ways and
[1:14:28] take them off the beaten path look at
[1:14:31] this one beaten path that brother Bram
[1:14:34] firmly laid for us for this day that has
[1:14:38] gone off that path listen this God in
[1:14:40] hiding himself and in Simplicity again
[1:14:44] brother man says I'm make it's very
[1:14:45] short amen you probably know where I'm
[1:14:48] headed when I say
[1:14:50] this brother R said he God never
[1:14:55] ordained
[1:14:56] denominations he never ordained groups
[1:14:59] of
[1:15:00] men he ordained men to preach the gospel
[1:15:05] not
[1:15:06] Machinery not Mechanical Devices he pre
[1:15:10] he he ordained man to preach the gospel
[1:15:14] not saying that you can't that you don't
[1:15:16] listen to the tapes the message not
[1:15:19] saying that amen but it takes in this
[1:15:23] day just like it was then God's
[1:15:26] anointing on men of God that are called
[1:15:29] of God to preach this gospel still the
[1:15:32] same today amen he didn't ordain a
[1:15:35] Machinery he didn't ordain a mechanical
[1:15:37] device he ordained a man yeah he
[1:15:40] ordained men to preach the gospel and
[1:15:42] there are men that are ordained of God
[1:15:44] that are preaching this pure
[1:15:46] unadulterated word yet today all over
[1:15:48] the world therefore the bride for this
[1:15:52] last day
[1:15:53] to get that bride ready those sa this
[1:15:56] Rapture is about to take place and we're
[1:15:58] about to go home now what's happened on
[1:16:00] the other side of things that there are
[1:16:03] groups of people that are
[1:16:06] strictly
[1:16:08] declaring only push play only play a
[1:16:12] tape only listen to brother brandham
[1:16:15] when brother brandham himself if they
[1:16:16] listen to it while they push the button
[1:16:18] if they listen to what brother bandam
[1:16:20] said is absolutely contrary to what he
[1:16:22] said
[1:16:24] contrary to what brother Brandon
[1:16:25] preached was for him only to push a play
[1:16:29] button for us only to listen to brother
[1:16:31] brandham absolutely not brother brandham
[1:16:34] said he'll always have men to preach the
[1:16:36] gospel ordained of God Amen tell what to
[1:16:41] listen to when to listen to it how and
[1:16:44] and and go with that friend if that
[1:16:47] isn't as nickan as I've heard I don't
[1:16:50] know what is that's denomination as any
[1:16:54] denomination including the Catholic
[1:16:56] church that's as nickon as any any
[1:17:00] controlling body has over a group of
[1:17:02] people that you'll find in the scripture
[1:17:04] or anywhere in history it's happening
[1:17:08] right
[1:17:09] now that one group of it all I that's
[1:17:13] okay I I love them they're my brothers I
[1:17:16] love Brother
[1:17:17] Joseph absolutely spent time with him
[1:17:20] he's a good brother he stopped one time
[1:17:22] and had conversation with us was at
[1:17:24] brandom Tabernacle was very friendly
[1:17:27] love the man do anything to help him but
[1:17:29] he's
[1:17:30] wrong all this is wrong friend it's up
[1:17:34] to you and I God did not ordain a group
[1:17:37] of men he ordained men to preach the
[1:17:40] gospel right praise the Lord not to be
[1:17:42] in control over other people but to but
[1:17:46] to preach the
[1:17:47] gospel
[1:17:49] Galatians let's go to Galatians I'll
[1:17:51] finish this up here Galatians I got two
[1:17:54] more scriptures
[1:17:57] Galatians is next and then we'll go to
[1:17:59] Jude Galatians chapter
[1:18:02] 2 verse
[1:18:05] one Galatians
[1:18:08] 2:1 then 14 years after I went up again
[1:18:12] to Jerusalem with Barnabas and took
[1:18:14] Titus with me also and I went up by
[1:18:17] Revelation communicated unto them that
[1:18:19] gospel which I preach among the Gentiles
[1:18:22] but private ly to them which were of
[1:18:24] reputation lest by any means I should
[1:18:27] run or had run in
[1:18:29] vain but neither Titus who was with me
[1:18:33] being a Greek was compelled to be
[1:18:36] circumcised and that because of false
[1:18:38] Brethren unawares listen now false
[1:18:41] Brethren false brethren we know this
[1:18:43] brother Brown preached
[1:18:51] false
[1:18:53] anointed amen at the end time Paul false
[1:18:57] Brethren
[1:18:59] unawares amen that means they're in the
[1:19:02] group and people don't realize it amen
[1:19:06] just like Peter said in the group
[1:19:09] unawares many people follow their
[1:19:14] ways when their false Brethren
[1:19:17] unawares brought in who came in
[1:19:20] privately to spy out our Li Li Y which
[1:19:23] we have in Christ Jesus that they might
[1:19:26] bring us into bondage again that's
[1:19:30] exactly the opposite of what a lot of
[1:19:32] them will tell you A lot of them will
[1:19:35] tell you you do not be in what they
[1:19:37] consider the bondage of this message
[1:19:40] friend it's not the bondage of the
[1:19:41] message it's the liberty of Christ to
[1:19:43] live according to his word see that was
[1:19:46] the problem that they have when they
[1:19:47] came to this United States and
[1:19:49] established this country they had to
[1:19:51] live based on the dict Ates of what the
[1:19:53] church and the government was telling
[1:19:55] them to do they could not live by their
[1:19:57] conscience and the dictates of this word
[1:19:59] they had to live by what they were told
[1:20:01] to do that's bondage they call it
[1:20:04] Freedom friend it's not Freedom it's
[1:20:06] bondage freedom is living how you want
[1:20:09] to live and how you want to live as a
[1:20:12] Believer is according to the word to be
[1:20:14] pleasing to the Lord Jesus that's
[1:20:17] freedom and they came in to spy out
[1:20:20] false Brethren unaware
[1:20:23] they're false but yet
[1:20:25] undetected trying to spy out people's
[1:20:28] Liberties and tell them this isn't like
[1:20:30] this this isn't like this you shouldn't
[1:20:31] have to do this you don't have to live
[1:20:33] like that you don't have to do this and
[1:20:35] what do they do they confuse people and
[1:20:38] cause people something probably again it
[1:20:41] was already in their heart oh I didn't
[1:20:43] really want to do that anyway well now
[1:20:45] you've got an excuse not a reason
[1:20:49] reasons or excuses are two different
[1:20:51] things you have an EXC excuse let's see
[1:20:54] how good your excuse goes before God
[1:20:56] Almighty but I but not a reason I have
[1:21:00] an excuse now because it was already
[1:21:02] something in there that when they came
[1:21:04] forth with this false word they made
[1:21:07] merchandise out of you oh my same thing
[1:21:11] happens today to people Saints they take
[1:21:13] the word and they twist it to make their
[1:21:15] own ideas about it or they just tell you
[1:21:18] well in fact a lot of people just take a
[1:21:21] whole half of this Bible wow let's just
[1:21:23] go over to Matthew one just ripped the
[1:21:25] other St the
[1:21:28] garbage friend if you cannot believe and
[1:21:31] place your entire Eternal salvation and
[1:21:34] eternal life on every word of this Bible
[1:21:36] throw it all away
[1:21:38] yeah amen I believe every bit of it even
[1:21:41] the part I don't understand amen and try
[1:21:45] our best to obey every bit of it what
[1:21:49] the word says is God's word to me but
[1:21:52] false Brethren come in unawares they say
[1:21:55] this and that and they they tickle
[1:21:56] someone who who kind of wanted to do
[1:21:58] that anyway and all they go that's the
[1:22:00] he makes merchandise out of them my mind
[1:22:03] brings them what does it do it brings
[1:22:05] them into
[1:22:07] bondage brings them into bondage
[1:22:09] especially if that person is a True
[1:22:11] Believer especially if that person's a
[1:22:14] true seed of God it'll really bring that
[1:22:17] person into bondage I mean you see a lot
[1:22:19] of times people go off in the world and
[1:22:21] go do whatever live their lives and and
[1:22:24] and nothing ever really happens to them
[1:22:26] I I'm sorry but I worry about those
[1:22:28] people yeah because if you're not
[1:22:30] serving the lord God's going to make
[1:22:32] your life miserable until you
[1:22:34] do
[1:22:36] amen if you're not doing what you're
[1:22:38] supposed to be doing or how you're
[1:22:39] supposed to be doing it God's going to
[1:22:41] get it from you somehow he's going to
[1:22:44] make it miserable somehow God's going to
[1:22:46] do it amen to try to bring us around to
[1:22:49] where we're supposed to be in him amen
[1:22:52] that's his whole point is to bring us to
[1:22:54] that place
[1:22:56] Jude let me read Jude and a couple
[1:23:00] uh quotes and I'll
[1:23:06] close I mean two of the largest facets
[1:23:08] in the message today are are uh
[1:23:12] intellectualism and legalism yeah
[1:23:15] legalism to bring people into bondage
[1:23:18] again because it's not legalism that we
[1:23:20] live and me it's Holiness that we live
[1:23:22] we live we don't live this way because
[1:23:24] we have to we live this way because we
[1:23:26] want to and living that way just because
[1:23:30] you do it as an intellectual exercise or
[1:23:33] something that's you've been educated
[1:23:35] into doesn't mean
[1:23:37] anything it's got to be from your heart
[1:23:39] something again going back to
[1:23:41] Thanksgiving something that we do from
[1:23:43] our heart because we want to do it amen
[1:23:46] not because we're forced to do it
[1:23:47] because we want to do it it's in our
[1:23:49] heart to do it we know what God's word
[1:23:52] says about about it so we want to live
[1:23:53] it to the best of our abilities
[1:23:56] intellectualism like I
[1:23:58] said is just trying to take and make
[1:24:01] this message up where people can't half
[1:24:04] the time can't understand it amen make
[1:24:08] it more intellectual than just the pure
[1:24:11] salvation of the
[1:24:13] Gospel Jude now verse three and
[1:24:17] 4 beloved when I gave all diligence to
[1:24:21] write unto you of the and salvation it
[1:24:23] was needful for me to write unto you and
[1:24:25] exhort you that you should earnestly
[1:24:28] contend for the faith which was once
[1:24:31] delivered unto the Saints now why should
[1:24:32] we have to contend for Faith why should
[1:24:36] we have to fight and battle
[1:24:39] earnestly earnestly fight and battle and
[1:24:43] contend for
[1:24:45] faith not just Faith but the faith that
[1:24:48] was once delivered to the Saints the
[1:24:52] faith that we know that we saw
[1:24:54] manifesting itself in brother Bam's
[1:24:57] Ministry and in those that believe
[1:25:00] throughout time up to this
[1:25:02] point they do the same
[1:25:05] thing the exhortation from Jude is to
[1:25:08] earnestly contend don't let that be
[1:25:11] stolen from you don't let that faith
[1:25:14] that that pure unadulterated Faith Of
[1:25:17] God be stolen from you taken from you uh
[1:25:21] manipulated away from you hold on to it
[1:25:24] contend anybody comes to take it away
[1:25:26] friend you pull out the sword of the
[1:25:29] spirit and you you go to work amen don't
[1:25:33] let it be taken from you if you have to
[1:25:36] uh make an enemy out of a friend don't
[1:25:38] make them an enemy but they may think
[1:25:41] you're an enemy then whatever you do you
[1:25:44] got to contend earnestly contend to hold
[1:25:47] on to keep that faith for fourth verse
[1:25:51] for there are C certain men crept in
[1:25:54] unawares wow it sounds a whole lot like
[1:25:57] what Peter said and what galatian what
[1:25:59] Paul said in
[1:26:00] Galatians amen men crept in unawares so
[1:26:05] they're in there but people don't know
[1:26:08] it God will reveal it to you if you
[1:26:11] belong to him he'll reveal it to you
[1:26:13] amen that's why Paul knew and called
[1:26:16] names that's why brother Bram knew and
[1:26:17] was going to call names amen God help us
[1:26:22] there in there they're in here unawares
[1:26:26] in this message among our ranks some
[1:26:28] have left some leave it and say the
[1:26:30] message is nothing and they call what we
[1:26:32] believe and hold true to be
[1:26:34] heresy amen that's exactly right the
[1:26:37] things that we hold dear the things that
[1:26:39] we believe in to that's a part of our
[1:26:43] Salvation they they call
[1:26:46] heresy they've come in unawares some are
[1:26:49] still here some have left who were
[1:26:51] before of old or ordained they were
[1:26:53] ordained to this
[1:26:56] condemnation they were ordained to do
[1:26:58] what they do you say how can those
[1:27:01] people exist God ordained them to do so
[1:27:04] remember again we go back to
[1:27:05] Thessalonians I wish I wish this hadn't
[1:27:08] been hadn't come so long after we read
[1:27:11] that part because it runs so well in
[1:27:13] continuity together with uh second
[1:27:16] Thessalonians if you want to go back
[1:27:17] read it again um 2 Thessalonians chapter
[1:27:20] 2 it's very very important to draw that
[1:27:23] back to this to understand this isn't
[1:27:26] just an isolated thing this isn't just
[1:27:28] something that I pulled one scripture to
[1:27:30] try to make a Doctrine friend this is a
[1:27:32] theme that went all through the Bible
[1:27:34] that went all through the New Testament
[1:27:36] at least went all through in brother
[1:27:37] Bam's
[1:27:38] Ministry remember the that the people
[1:27:43] calling brother randam God all the
[1:27:45] fanaticism that followed people had to
[1:27:47] have a brother vom God used a sign in
[1:27:50] the hand there people come along had to
[1:27:52] have a sign in their hand uh the
[1:27:54] discernment people had to try to discern
[1:27:57] uh prayer lines with people staggering
[1:27:58] around like brother bam did on the video
[1:28:00] like like they're falling in the same uh
[1:28:05] anointing or something like that my
[1:28:07] friend it's just it's just Carl
[1:28:09] impersonation yeah and it's the
[1:28:11] fanaticism still goes on
[1:28:13] today I've seen it happen even at the
[1:28:16] Tabernacle not brother green now amen
[1:28:19] did just false impersonation I'll just
[1:28:22] leave it at that but try to draw people
[1:28:25] away God and and does it but they come
[1:28:28] in unawares but they are ordained to
[1:28:31] that place they were ordained by God to
[1:28:35] that time what did God say in
[1:28:37] Thessalonians what what did Paul what
[1:28:39] did God have Paul say in Thessalonians
[1:28:42] that he would send them strong delusion
[1:28:45] and that they would believe a lie and be
[1:28:48] damned by it yeah my mind they ordained
[1:28:53] to this ordained just as ordained as a
[1:28:57] true Minister as I by God's grace I
[1:29:00] believe I am a a true minister of God
[1:29:03] ordained just as
[1:29:05] ordained just as I'm ordained to this
[1:29:08] post here today they are ordained to
[1:29:10] their post by God to this
[1:29:15] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[1:29:18] grace of our God into lasciviousness and
[1:29:21] denying the only Lord God and our Lord
[1:29:23] Jesus Christ taking the grace of God and
[1:29:25] making a disgrace out of it what was
[1:29:27] Paul's answer to the Roman Church for
[1:29:28] that they say well if Grace is abounding
[1:29:31] and if it abounds more if we sin why we
[1:29:33] just keep sinning Paul said God forbid
[1:29:37] it's not for that purpose amen it's not
[1:29:41] so you can just go do whatever you want
[1:29:43] and God's grace is going to be there
[1:29:45] right God's Grace will be there for
[1:29:47] those who believe and hold to it and
[1:29:50] Trust in it because we need God's grace
[1:29:53] even today more than ever yeah we need
[1:29:55] God's grace and God does forgive God
[1:29:58] does bring forgiveness into our
[1:30:00] absolutely but we don't go about living
[1:30:02] and doing however we want just believing
[1:30:05] that God's going to forgive us that's
[1:30:07] making the grace of God a disgrace
[1:30:11] that's taken the grace of God and make
[1:30:13] it into
[1:30:16] lasciviousness people ordained men
[1:30:20] ordained to that purpose unfortunately
[1:30:24] it's sad unfortunately but
[1:30:27] true amen I said I was going to read
[1:30:30] this couple of things here and we're
[1:30:32] going to
[1:30:34] close
[1:30:37] amen maybe I just go down just to this
[1:30:39] one
[1:30:41] here praise the Lord I'm looking for
[1:30:43] this other one I was trying to
[1:30:47] find amen here we go in the church age
[1:30:50] book this is out out of the church age
[1:30:52] book trying to
[1:30:54] remember uh can't remember exactly which
[1:30:58] one it was in here which section of the
[1:31:00] church a book but if you wanted to go
[1:31:02] find it it wouldn't be a problem to find
[1:31:04] if you do a search on it but brother Ram
[1:31:06] said this now now in every case you'll
[1:31:09] find he's come through read reading 1
[1:31:11] Timothy 4 now uh that some in the latter
[1:31:14] times will depart from the faith giving
[1:31:16] heed to seducing spirits and such
[1:31:18] doctrines of devils he said first
[1:31:20] Timothy which we didn't read that part
[1:31:23] uh trying to keep this a little shorter
[1:31:24] now now in every case though he says
[1:31:27] after reading that he says now in every
[1:31:28] case you will notice that a false
[1:31:31] prophet is one who is outside the word
[1:31:35] that's number one that's the number one
[1:31:37] most important thing a false someone who
[1:31:39] is false is outside the word a false
[1:31:43] prophet is outside the word just as we
[1:31:47] showed you that Antichrist means anti-
[1:31:50] word so these false prophets come
[1:31:53] perverting the word or again just 99% is
[1:31:56] a perversion of the word giving it a
[1:31:59] meaning that fits their own devilish
[1:32:03] ends he said have you ever noticed how
[1:32:06] the people who lead others astray bind
[1:32:10] them closely to themselves by
[1:32:14] fear by fear
[1:32:17] intimidation by fear they bind people to
[1:32:20] themselves not
[1:32:22] Christ amen I I would challenge anybody
[1:32:27] to find one place where brother bam ever
[1:32:30] tried to bind people to himself yeah
[1:32:32] never
[1:32:34] ever but he always tried always worked
[1:32:38] always preached to bind the people to
[1:32:40] Jesus Christ amen always to Jesus Christ
[1:32:44] and with God's help and mercy that's all
[1:32:46] I'll ever do is try to bind people
[1:32:49] including myself to Jesus Jesus
[1:32:52] Christ but these false prophets these
[1:32:55] false
[1:32:56] teachers they lead each other lead
[1:32:59] others astray and bind them by fear
[1:33:04] intimidation scar Scare Tactics oh well
[1:33:08] you're going to go to hell if you don't
[1:33:09] come
[1:33:10] here so much there's a church in town
[1:33:13] that when people leave that church they
[1:33:15] take them out from under the blood and
[1:33:16] tell them they're lost even if they're
[1:33:17] just going to another message Church
[1:33:19] even if they just feel led to go under
[1:33:21] another Pastor even if the Lord's just
[1:33:23] taking them somewhere else they're
[1:33:25] they're lost if they don't go to that
[1:33:27] church lost they're not a part of God's
[1:33:31] economy what are they doing binding the
[1:33:34] people to themselves by fear scaring the
[1:33:38] people you will not make a Rapture if
[1:33:40] you go any place else well that's just a
[1:33:43] horrible heresy amen of
[1:33:47] itself that's not even 99% word that's
[1:33:51] not even 9% word they say that if the
[1:33:54] people don't do what they say or if they
[1:33:57] leave then destruction will
[1:34:00] follow they are false prophets for a
[1:34:04] true Prophet will always lead one to the
[1:34:06] word and bind the people to Jesus Christ
[1:34:11] and he won't tell the people to fear Him
[1:34:14] or what he says amen we have respect for
[1:34:18] God and for God's word absolutely but we
[1:34:22] don't even try to promote God in that
[1:34:25] light to say well now if you leave god
[1:34:29] well yeah you're doomed but not a church
[1:34:33] God can lead people where he wants to
[1:34:34] lead them God can reveal to anybody who
[1:34:37] he wants to reveal to we've read that
[1:34:40] all we know that all through the
[1:34:41] scripture All Through Time where did
[1:34:44] Brother brandham even came up in
[1:34:46] denomination was claimed to be a
[1:34:48] denomination and was originally ordained
[1:34:51] as a the Baptist
[1:34:52] Minister but that's not where God wanted
[1:34:55] him that's not where God had him to be
[1:34:57] and when he left and he went out and God
[1:34:59] showed him these are your
[1:35:01] people I'll take care of you and God
[1:35:04] blessed him God was with him God took
[1:35:07] care of him and whatever he did God was
[1:35:10] leading him but he lost a lot of people
[1:35:13] as a result he lost friends he lost
[1:35:15] brothers in Christ that that left him
[1:35:18] amen it's like that song we sang do thy
[1:35:22] friends despise and reject Thee Well if
[1:35:26] your friends despise you they're not
[1:35:29] friends especially if you espouse to
[1:35:32] them your feelings and what you believe
[1:35:34] and what you hold true in life what's
[1:35:36] important to you if they leave you over
[1:35:39] that they're not
[1:35:40] friends amen praise the Lord that's the
[1:35:43] way I look at it anyway how could a true
[1:35:46] friend leave you despise you uh they're
[1:35:49] not a friend amen but the the word will
[1:35:52] stand true and God will stand true with
[1:35:54] his word and with his people always amen
[1:35:58] always it's a
[1:36:00] beware through the scripture we know
[1:36:04] it's got to line up with the word Saints
[1:36:06] amen got to line up with the message
[1:36:08] which is derived from the word if it
[1:36:11] doesn't there's anything there just
[1:36:13] doesn't click and somethings off it's
[1:36:16] God
[1:36:17] leading uh you know my wife has a has a
[1:36:22] a client that's a lady friend I guess
[1:36:24] now that she works with takes care of
[1:36:26] and her son lives in San Diego and we
[1:36:28] saw him had lunch with him this past
[1:36:30] week and he was asking me about our
[1:36:32] church and I said that don't I we're
[1:36:37] just a Bible believing Bible believing
[1:36:39] group of Christians well what where do
[1:36:42] you derive from us derive from the from
[1:36:44] the Bible you know because a lot of
[1:36:46] people don't understand if you've got no
[1:36:48] denomination and no no uh uh thing that
[1:36:52] you your platform is is uh projected
[1:36:56] from then what do you preach a stuff
[1:36:58] preach by
[1:36:59] Revelation the Bible says you can't even
[1:37:01] know Jesus but by Revelation I said uh I
[1:37:06] and he asked me about uh the Bible and
[1:37:09] the interpretations of the Bible and all
[1:37:11] the different uh um uh variations of the
[1:37:15] Bible I gu there's thousands of them now
[1:37:18] I said well I don't promote any
[1:37:20] particular one I just promote let it be
[1:37:22] the revelation of God through that word
[1:37:24] to you not what not to understand it
[1:37:27] I've had people a lot of times having
[1:37:29] well I don't understand don't worry
[1:37:31] about understanding it right read
[1:37:34] it the best you know how you can study
[1:37:37] it through absolutely find other
[1:37:39] scripture to go with it but you don't
[1:37:41] need to understand it you need to let
[1:37:42] God reveal it to you yeah amen try to
[1:37:45] make that point to understand God will
[1:37:48] reveal it and that's what we hold to and
[1:37:50] believe God revealing to us amen is that
[1:37:54] the word is that the truth and God will
[1:37:58] show it amen even if it's something you
[1:38:00] may not have read in the message or in
[1:38:02] the Bible God will reveal it to you let
[1:38:04] you know show you whether this is
[1:38:07] whether this is real or not amen praise
[1:38:10] the Lord but we beware because it is it
[1:38:13] is here in our ranks amen God help us to

[1:38:35] speak to our hearts when it speaks to
[1:38:38] our hearts we have the Holy Ghost it'll
[1:38:41] speak and tell us exactly what we need
[1:38:43] to know amen it'll speak and show us
[1:38:47] where we are in that word and what we
[1:38:49] need to do what the Lord will show us

[1:42:44] still seems to be quite a bit of uh
[1:42:47] sickness uh lack of attendance um
[1:42:51] due to the sicknesses and all we I'm
[1:42:53] going to postpone it we I had had it
[1:42:55] planned for next Sunday was hoping to do
[1:42:58] it next Sunday but uh with I just want
[1:43:01] to make sure everybody's well and all is
[1:43:03] good before we do communion foot washing
[1:43:04] and have a lunch so um I'm not sure if
[1:43:08] Christmas Eve is a good time to to do it
[1:43:11] which will be the next Sunday uh the
[1:43:13] next Sunday I fly out of town again uh
[1:43:17] so that puts us like the 14th of January
