[33:03] brother mike holloway i didn't put a
[33:05] prayer request in for him i just wanted
[33:07] to explain it to you just briefly uh my
[33:11] brother mike holloway sent me a text
[33:12] wednesday you know we've been praying
[33:14] for him and he's had that heart issue
[33:16] and he said that he's feeling
[33:18] wonderful everything is perfect he's
[33:21] doing good at body
[33:23] and he got a different cardiologist
[33:25] they're going to do
[33:26] a scan thursday this week he's going to
[33:29] meet with the expert friday for another
[33:31] revaluation
[33:33] so the doctors are telling him he
[33:35] shouldn't be feeling better
[33:37] uh you should be feeling worse
[33:39] but that not in god's book
[33:42] i believe brother mike's jumped in the
[33:44] water
[33:45] i believe he's gotten some healing but i
[33:48] want you to remember him in prayer if
[33:50] you would amen brother michael always
[33:52] hold a a very special place in my heart
[33:55] i love him dearly but just please

[33:59] too but he's going thursday for that
[34:01] test and friday for the vows to remember
[34:03] him also please remember sister joy
[34:05] hockamy i know i'll put the prayer
[34:07] request for her i just wanted to make
[34:09] that a quick request just to you know as
[34:11] we move the service along but sister joy
[34:14] is in a very dire situation she really
[34:16] is
[34:17] there's nothing the medical community
[34:18] can do for her there's no
[34:20] apparently there's no medicine and give
[34:22] her painkillers but that's about it
[34:24] there's no operation or whatever the
[34:27] bones are going back together and
[34:29] crooked and she's in constant pain

[39:39] amen
[39:40] you know there's
[39:43] every service brings its own unique uh
[39:46] challenges it brings its own unique
[39:47] spirit word
[39:49] and
[39:50] uh afterwards uh in the position that
[39:53] i'm in that uh
[39:55] ministering it it brings the different
[39:57] perspective probably maybe than it does
[39:59] you there maybe not
[40:01] uh but every once in a while uh i'll end
[40:05] the service and in my mind i'm still
[40:09] uh preaching
[40:09] just keeps coming it just keeps going
[40:11] and it keeps coming and honestly friend
[40:13] i gotta just i really
[40:15] um
[40:16] i gotta stop saying that i'm not lying
[40:19] to you i don't lie to you so it's just
[40:21] horrible to be honest i'm always honest
[40:23] but uh try to anyway right but the truth
[40:26] of it is i i was this was in my spirit
[40:29] all week
[40:30] uh continuing from where we left off
[40:33] from last week
[40:35] knowing that you know we have the time
[40:37] constraints and that we
[40:38] uh do what we can under the time and all
[40:41] that god gives us and
[40:43] i went a little over an hour last week
[40:45] but it just kept going in my spirit all
[40:47] week really i was preaching this message
[40:49] in my heart and i i i started
[40:53] uh working on these things during the
[40:55] week and then yesterday morning and uh
[40:59] and i
[41:00] wrote some things down i felt the lord
[41:01] had for today and and continuation of
[41:04] last week and it just kept going and i
[41:06] thought well
[41:07] you know that
[41:09] i kind of you know get to the place
[41:10] where you feel like there's
[41:12] notes there that's going to take you
[41:14] through a service and and then stuff
[41:16] just kept coming and so i got another
[41:18] piece of paper and i just started
[41:20] writing down on that piece of paper
[41:22] and uh just as the lord kept feeding it
[41:25] so yeah
[41:26] i'm i'm not a very smart man i just do
[41:29] what i feel led to do amen and that's
[41:32] all i know to do so i i can't say any
[41:36] better or worse or anything but just to
[41:38] do what the lord puts on my heart to do
[41:40] amen amen so uh i'm thankful that the
[41:43] lord does that but
[41:45] i'm thankful that we know that there's
[41:46] going to be a rapture very thankful to
[41:48] know that there's going to be a catching
[41:50] away amen of course last week we ended
[41:52] up getting to the place it was kind of
[41:54] outside my notes but to the place that
[41:56] we were speaking on faith and rapturing
[41:58] faith and rapturing grace and what it
[42:00] would take for a body change and get us
[42:02] into a rapture amen everything that
[42:05] comes with it and
[42:06] uh from the spiritual aspect aspect of
[42:09] it in that point and i've quoted a
[42:11] scripture several times
[42:13] that i want to read today and that's the
[42:14] next place i want to go romans chapter
[42:16] 10.
[42:22] i quoted this scripture quite a few
[42:24] times last week and establishing
[42:26] something that's actually been on my
[42:27] heart for years because i've heard so
[42:30] many people and i have felt the same way
[42:32] i've told you this
[42:34] many many times in thinking
[42:36] uh the service we go to and the word
[42:39] that's heard and everything that goes on
[42:41] and and sometimes you can look back and
[42:44] you can think carnally
[42:46] and and in your carnal thinking you can
[42:48] look and think are we any closer than we
[42:51] were 30 years ago
[42:53] 33 or so when i first started preaching
[42:55] i thinking lord
[42:57] and brother did the same thing yes you
[42:59] know brother brown did the same thing he
[43:00] said all the preaching i've done
[43:03] 30 years or whatever worth the preaching
[43:04] i looked at it as more bob here and more
[43:06] slackware and women and everything going
[43:08] on all the sin and stuff is on the
[43:10] increase and it's worse than it was 30
[43:12] years ago
[43:14] and so i know
[43:16] he did the same thing and i look
[43:17] sometimes i think are we any closer
[43:19] because uh there is a bride friend and i
[43:22] believe i'm a part of that right
[43:24] i believe you're a part of that right
[43:26] and if we're a part of that bride we are
[43:29] closer now than we were within america
[43:32] it's just inevitable based on the fact
[43:34] of the truth of god's word that's all it
[43:37] is i'm not basing it on anything that i
[43:39] could see tears full smell here i'm not
[43:41] basing on any imagination region
[43:43] constant infection memory i'm basing it
[43:46] solely on that sixth cent of faith
[43:49] and that faith based on god's word
[43:52] telling us who we are and where we are
[43:54] and that the word cannot return void
[43:58] read that scripture last week but this
[44:01] scripture i read
[44:02] i quoted several times i did not read it
[44:06] and i told you this had been in my mind
[44:08] and i was witnessing to this to a
[44:09] brother the other day and i quoted the
[44:12] scripture to it and it and it dawned on
[44:15] me as he actually completed the
[44:17] scripture
[44:18] that i that i that something struck me
[44:20] it's like the holy spirit spoke to me
[44:22] that there's something there you need to
[44:24] go home and look at that
[44:25] so i did and i looked at this scripture
[44:28] more so let's read it it's the 17th
[44:30] verse
[44:31] romans 10 17.
[44:36] and and then you probably see where
[44:38] we're going then so then faith cometh by
[44:41] hearing
[44:42] and hearing by the word of god
[44:45] now it's never really dawned on me
[44:47] anymore other than the fact that faith
[44:50] comes by hearing and that we quoted
[44:52] remember last week many times faith
[44:55] comes by hearing amen but when you but
[44:58] when but when for some reason when that
[45:00] brother quoted the entirety of the
[45:03] scripture to me
[45:04] again the holy spirit spoke to me and
[45:06] said there's something more there you
[45:08] need to look at
[45:09] so like i said i went home and i started
[45:12] looking at it and reading it and i sat
[45:14] there and i prayed and i said god what
[45:16] is it in here that you want me to see
[45:18] what is it in here that i'm missing
[45:20] because the wording of this seems very
[45:22] strange
[45:23] i mean read it listen listen again faith
[45:26] come by hearing and hearing by
[45:28] right and that's just kind of odd when
[45:31] the point that you're trying to get
[45:32] across is the faith caused by hearing
[45:35] what is it that that's there that is
[45:38] that that i just say that i was missing
[45:41] lord what is in that scripture that i
[45:43] was missing that i wasn't seeing
[45:45] and this is after sitting there and
[45:47] praying and looking at i'll tell you
[45:48] what the lord showed me
[45:51] faith comes by hearing now we know what
[45:53] that is faith comes by
[45:56] hearing
[45:57] that's pretty simple that's the part we
[45:59] understand we know that
[46:00] faith comes by hearing by hearing is
[46:03] when you hear the word spoken to you
[46:06] amen that's simple we understand that
[46:08] part but look at the conjunction here
[46:12] faith is just doesn't come by hearing
[46:16] it comes by hearing
[46:18] and
[46:20] hearing by
[46:21] right
[46:22] now i'll be honest with you again i'm
[46:25] not i'm not a very smart person never
[46:27] claimed to be some great intellect but
[46:30] that stumped me
[46:31] i could not understand or could not
[46:35] grasp the revelation of what this
[46:37] scripture was speaking to us and you
[46:39] remember we talked about
[46:41] revelation last week we talked about it
[46:43] again a little bit at our luncheon
[46:44] yesterday which we enjoyed very much
[46:46] brother john god bless you thank you
[46:48] miss brother art we missed you and miss
[46:50] brother danny being there with us uh
[46:54] when we have it again i encourage you to
[46:55] come hope you can come i know you had to
[46:57] work but uh but we enjoyed it very much
[46:59] and we were talking about it again
[47:00] yesterday revelation
[47:02] the rapture is a revelation faith is a
[47:05] revelation so if you bring the two
[47:07] together you're basically saying the
[47:09] same thing right amen
[47:11] faith is a revelation the revelation
[47:14] takes for body change
[47:15] revelation is something that comes to
[47:17] you uh that becomes a part of you
[47:20] brother pat gave us his explanation
[47:22] yesterday of what of how he uh brings it
[47:26] in his mind and how he sees it which is
[47:28] perfect sense i've told you uh it
[47:31] becomes a part of you uh i think i've
[47:33] even told you one time that i've looked
[47:36] at you ever seen that jesus plaque that
[47:37] used to be popular many years ago
[47:40] that said jesus but but they accentuated
[47:43] the inside the parts jesus and a lot of
[47:45] times when you look at it all you see is
[47:47] a bunch of jumble and people say well
[47:49] that that says jesus
[47:51] and when you look at it you're like i
[47:53] don't see jesus all i see is jumble and
[47:56] you may have done the same thing i don't
[47:57] know different people probably saw a
[47:59] different way maybe you saw jesus
[48:00] straight off i didn't
[48:02] and
[48:03] i'm sure you know what i'm talking about
[48:04] yeah and i always thought was the inside
[48:08] parts between the letters all i saw i
[48:10] didn't see the j-u-s-u-s i saw the
[48:12] little things because it was accentuated
[48:14] but once i saw
[48:16] once i spent a time looking at that and
[48:19] once i saw jesus in there the next time
[48:23] i looked at it or the next hundred times
[48:25] i looked at it i could only see jesus
[48:28] amen see when it becomes a revelation
[48:31] that's all you can see
[48:33] amen brother brown or brother uh pat
[48:35] talked about and this dip probably may
[48:37] be different for all of you but brother
[48:39] pat's a mechanic and he says you know
[48:42] somebody can tell you all day long how
[48:43] the inside components of a combustion
[48:46] engine work
[48:47] and how the pistons go up down and the
[48:48] oil and everything and the and all that
[48:50] has to keep the motor going to get
[48:53] for the motor to be running
[48:54] he said but once i took a motor apart
[48:56] and i saw it and i could see it and i
[48:59] saw the components and i knew how it
[49:01] worked he said now it doesn't matter how
[49:03] many times somebody explains it to me i
[49:06] know how it works because i experienced
[49:08] it right yeah
[49:10] then then you can't unexperience it you
[49:12] can look at a full-blown engine all in a
[49:14] in a car with everything around it and
[49:16] you can see what's inside the engine
[49:18] because you know what's there right
[49:21] you've experienced it it's become real
[49:23] to you amen that's kind of
[49:26] another another carnal interpretation of
[49:29] a spiritual revelation but it's the same
[49:31] thing
[49:32] once you see it you can't unsee it
[49:35] that's a revelation
[49:36] no matter how many people try to come to
[49:38] you and say oh no it works this way in
[49:40] this way this is inside there and that's
[49:42] inside there he said no no no no it's
[49:44] not because i've seen it
[49:46] i know what's in there amen somebody
[49:48] could come and say oh jesus said be
[49:51] baptized follow some holy ghost so no no
[49:53] no no god's already showed me right it's
[49:55] already been revealed to me i know how
[49:57] baptism in the scripture is supposed to
[49:58] work in the name of the lord jesus
[50:00] christ
[50:03] once you see it you can't unsee it you
[50:06] know it's there that's revelation faith
[50:08] come by hearing but now faith comes by
[50:11] hearing by hearing is when you hear the
[50:14] word spoken to you yes but it says and
[50:18] so there's another component
[50:20] it's not just you hearing the word
[50:22] because
[50:24] faith comes that way yes but it also
[50:28] comes or or it continues to come or the
[50:31] greater portion of that because see
[50:33] anybody can sit in here today
[50:35] anybody could be streaming or see this
[50:38] on archives and they can hear the words
[50:40] spoke
[50:41] and it will bring a certain level of
[50:43] faith but friend we're not talking about
[50:45] just a certain level of faith we're
[50:47] talking about rapturing faith
[50:49] we're talking about body changing faith
[50:52] like we talked about abraham and sarah
[50:54] yes
[50:54] body changing faith not just a simple
[50:57] faith that comes by hearing but there's
[50:59] another component
[51:00] and to the believer and to the bride
[51:03] which is where i focus this message
[51:05] not just on the simplicity of faith but
[51:08] god's faith in his bride amen for a
[51:11] rapturing group for a alive and remain
[51:14] group that's the focus this message is
[51:17] upon and the bible says that it comes by
[51:20] hearing and hearing
[51:23] by
[51:24] now if you ever heard or or or seen
[51:27] billboards or watched a commercial or
[51:30] something and they and they say so and
[51:32] so and such and such is brought to you
[51:34] by
[51:36] right that tells you that the
[51:38] the hidden entity over there over there
[51:41] is the one who produced the product
[51:44] right
[51:45] well when you're hearing by something
[51:48] that's the word speaking back to you
[51:52] by revelation amen as the revealed word
[51:55] speaking back to you because now you're
[51:58] hearing
[51:59] by the word
[52:00] you're just not hearing the word spoke
[52:03] to you you're hearing the word minister
[52:06] to you because it's now by the word
[52:09] so it's not just uh the word or by
[52:12] hearing but it's hearing by the word
[52:14] brought to you by
[52:17] this faith is brought to you by because
[52:20] see it's a living word
[52:23] the word is alive
[52:25] amen and it's a living oracle and if
[52:28] it's a living oracle then it speaks
[52:31] right remember brother brandon preach
[52:33] the thinking man's filter
[52:35] what is that that's a person who has the
[52:37] holy spirit filtering what he does
[52:40] things says acts through that word amen
[52:43] that's the word speaking yes you
[52:46] understand that's the word speaking when
[52:48] a revelation comes to you that's the
[52:50] word speaking well who is the word
[52:53] jesus christ is the word yes well that's
[52:56] where revelation comes from so when he's
[52:58] hearing by the word
[53:00] the word is speaking back to you
[53:03] amen
[53:05] praise the lord that's the spirit of god
[53:07] making the word known to you revealing
[53:10] the word to you letting you see that
[53:13] word see that different perspective of
[53:15] that word is just not just a drunkard
[53:18] sitting on the back row listening to the
[53:20] word being priest walking out with a
[53:22] certain level of faith no that brings in
[53:24] the element of god's children god's
[53:27] bride a rapturing faith of the word
[53:29] speaking back to you
[53:32] it's like baptism
[53:34] anybody can go get baptized
[53:36] and witness to the rest of the world
[53:38] that they've accepted jesus as their
[53:40] personal savior and that's all fine and
[53:42] good but you're not saved until what
[53:45] until god witnesses to the rest of the
[53:47] world that you belong to him by putting
[53:50] his spirit in you
[53:52] now there's the difference
[53:54] just like hearing by hearing and hearing
[53:57] by
[53:58] it's you
[54:00] hearing that word but then it's the word
[54:02] speaking back to you yes it's the word
[54:05] witnessing to you revealing to you what
[54:07] that word is that you're hearing amen
[54:10] what it means to you what it is to you
[54:13] who christ is to you it's him speaking
[54:16] amen amen because he's living he's alive
[54:19] and he's ministering to you through his
[54:21] word that's where the faith comes from
[54:25] or the rapturing faith not just a simple
[54:27] faith to know that when you flip the
[54:29] switch the light is going to come off
[54:30] but a rapturing faith amen a body
[54:34] changing faith
[54:35] a faith that will take this pride out of
[54:37] this place today
[54:39] amen amen
[54:41] praise the lord amen amen
[54:43] enraptured that's what we're looking to
[54:46] being enraptured
[54:48] now
[54:49] we know the scripture not a couple of
[54:51] the scriptures i had before with
[54:53] ephesians chapter 4 uh verse 11
[54:56] and he gave some apostles some prophets
[54:59] some evangelists some pastors and
[55:01] teachers yeah
[55:03] now
[55:05] for the word to speak back to you
[55:09] you have to hear the word spoken yes
[55:13] if you don't hear the word spoken you
[55:16] don't know what that element of that
[55:18] word is right you've never heard it
[55:22] it's like somebody saying uh well i know
[55:24] what the bible says but you've never
[55:26] read it if you've never read it how do
[55:28] you know what it says if you've never
[55:30] heard anybody expound on it how do you
[55:31] know what it says
[55:33] you can assume
[55:34] what it says
[55:36] you can presume
[55:37] you can think you know
[55:39] but you don't know until you've heard it
[55:41] right you don't know until you've read
[55:42] it
[55:44] i i talk about quotes and things in the
[55:47] message
[55:48] how do you know what brother branham
[55:50] said unless you've listened right
[55:53] how do you know what a certain thing is
[55:55] unless you've done it unless you've
[55:57] listened to it
[55:58] well how can that word speak back to you
[56:00] if you've never heard it spoke to begin
[56:02] with
[56:04] that's why paul in romans is talking and
[56:06] coupling that scripture with ministry
[56:09] just like paul goes into the ephesian
[56:10] church and does the exact same thing and
[56:12] says that he gave some apostles some
[56:15] prophets some evangelists some pastors
[56:17] some teachers and what are they for
[56:20] to bring the word right
[56:22] amen a god called man
[56:26] will bring the word and the word only
[56:29] right yeah
[56:31] he won't bring his opinions he'll bring
[56:33] the word and the word only he won't
[56:34] bring it from some seminary
[56:37] or or some uh institution of some kind
[56:40] not to build some kingdom or to make
[56:42] himself any more important or higher or
[56:44] better or more revelated right but no
[56:46] he'd just speak the word
[56:48] it just preached the gospel word as it
[56:51] has been brought to us and of course
[56:53] through the message of the hour in this
[56:55] last day
[56:57] my question is
[57:01] just think for a moment
[57:03] if you if if you went around
[57:06] every message church in the world
[57:10] and you asked everybody in every one of
[57:12] those church
[57:13] and take a poll
[57:15] hold a conference what would you say the
[57:18] message is
[57:20] how many answers do you think we get
[57:25] thousands
[57:26] tens of thousands
[57:28] of what a person some people think the
[57:30] message is just a bunch of quotes by
[57:32] william brown
[57:33] right
[57:35] friend i'm sorry i don't mean to giggle
[57:37] that's not the message
[57:39] the message just isn't a bunch of
[57:40] handful of quotes by william branham
[57:43] that's not the message right
[57:46] the message is jesus christ the word
[57:49] made manifest in your life
[57:51] that's the message yes sir when they
[57:54] when brother branham talked about the
[57:55] message going back to the jews that's
[57:58] pretty simple people think well who's
[58:00] going to do it who's going to go over
[58:01] there god's going to go over there
[58:04] jesus christ is going to go over there
[58:06] and they're going to say where did you
[58:07] get those stars he says in the house my
[58:09] friends right they're going to realize
[58:11] that they crucified their very messiah
[58:13] that's right and they're going to do
[58:14] what they're going to accept the messiah
[58:17] which is christ the word the message
[58:19] amen but i bet you'd probably get
[58:21] hundreds of hundreds of answers
[58:23] thousands maybe even tens of thousands
[58:26] you think about in tucson or even in
[58:28] arizona how many people she said what
[58:31] would you say the message is
[58:33] what would what would be the answers i'd
[58:35] be interested to know absolutely i'm not
[58:37] going to do it but it would be
[58:39] interesting to know
[58:40] amen when it's when it's very simple
[58:44] but god gave a ministry
[58:46] to bring the word to a people and that's
[58:49] exactly what god called ministers do
[58:51] right they bring the word to the people
[58:54] so the people hear the word
[58:57] and as that word is heard
[59:00] then it speaks back now that word might
[59:02] not speak back to you while you're
[59:03] sitting there it might speak back to you
[59:04] when you get your car right might speak
[59:06] back to you get home they might speak to
[59:08] you in your prayer time tomorrow when
[59:10] you're witnessing somebody next week but
[59:12] it'll speak back to you yes because the
[59:15] word is alive it's living
[59:17] and the word speaks the word brother
[59:19] graham said the word bleeds with the
[59:21] word gleans you know the word speaks
[59:23] because the word is christ amen you
[59:25] can't lose the element of that just with
[59:27] the verbiage
[59:28] it's jesus christ it's the word speaking
[59:30] back to you that's the witness of the
[59:33] spirit in your life when that word
[59:34] speaks back to you you got to hear it
[59:36] first
[59:37] the five-fold ministry and it's for the
[59:39] perfecting of the saints
[59:41] the perfecting that is the completion
[59:44] that is the the the uh uh maturity level
[59:48] to bring a maturity level of christ and
[59:50] how does that come by faith amen
[59:53] it it is a perfecting not not that
[59:55] you're gonna be sinless so that you're
[59:57] never gonna make another mistake that's
[59:59] that's not the kind of perfection it's
[1:00:00] talking about it's talking about a
[1:00:02] maturity right yeah a
[1:00:04] level of adulthood in christ for the
[1:00:07] work of the ministry
[1:00:08] for the edifying the building up of the
[1:00:11] body of christ
[1:00:12] till we all come in the unity of what
[1:00:16] faith
[1:00:18] till we all not not the word of god
[1:00:20] tabernacle not tucson tabernacle not
[1:00:24] just tucson or arizona or the united
[1:00:26] states but until we all who is the all
[1:00:29] that encompasses every believer on the
[1:00:32] planet earth that god has predestined
[1:00:35] and ordained to be in his body amen
[1:00:39] all yes well that makes it an
[1:00:41] international rapture
[1:00:43] that calls for the rapture of god's
[1:00:46] children to be worldwide
[1:00:49] internationally
[1:00:50] that's why it's more than just a a a
[1:00:54] scientific experiment or proof to say oh
[1:00:57] we're being caught up
[1:00:59] well you know the people down there on
[1:01:00] the other side of the earth they're
[1:01:02] saying up to
[1:01:04] we're pointing that way and they're
[1:01:05] pointing that way
[1:01:07] which way is up
[1:01:10] tell that to a scientist see what their
[1:01:12] answer is
[1:01:13] which way is up i'm pointing that way
[1:01:15] they're pointing that way but they're up
[1:01:17] and i'm up
[1:01:19] the only up is the word christ yes that
[1:01:22] is up here being caught up as being in
[1:01:25] christ that's what being caught up is
[1:01:28] catching a way to meet the lord in the
[1:01:29] air yes oh we're gonna get to that too
[1:01:32] amen we're gonna get you see those all
[1:01:35] you you see how uh
[1:01:37] how the how the activity of all these uh
[1:01:40] anomalies flying around everywhere has
[1:01:42] increased yes
[1:01:44] now i don't know if it's increased to
[1:01:46] the degree they think it has or there's
[1:01:48] just more cameras around than there used
[1:01:50] to be right i mean anybody sees anything
[1:01:52] now they swipe in their pocket and they
[1:01:54] take a picture of it
[1:01:56] you know surveillance cameras the little
[1:01:58] things this big
[1:02:00] how many people have these little
[1:02:01] doorbells with with cameras on them to
[1:02:03] catch things or cameras in people's cars
[1:02:06] uber lyft drivers and and and and
[1:02:09] people like that have little cameras in
[1:02:11] their cars
[1:02:13] facing out seeing all these all these
[1:02:15] things are captured all over the place
[1:02:16] now
[1:02:17] what's the increase of it amen
[1:02:21] brother said one's going to drop down
[1:02:23] pick you up one of these days
[1:02:24] praise the lord amen but we'll get to
[1:02:26] that another time
[1:02:27] but look the unity of the faith is to
[1:02:30] bring the entire body of christ into
[1:02:33] that same place
[1:02:35] that's why the entire body the ministry
[1:02:37] should be speaking the same thing right
[1:02:39] now not the same subject but the word
[1:02:42] right
[1:02:43] amen i don't have to be preaching the
[1:02:45] same subject as a as the brother down
[1:02:48] the street this morning i'd be fine and
[1:02:50] dandy that's great happens a lot too but
[1:02:53] as long as it's the pure unadulterated
[1:02:56] word being ministered that's what we're
[1:02:58] talking about
[1:03:00] even if somebody's pushing a tape button
[1:03:02] or or or they're uh in a different
[1:03:04] country as long as the word of god the
[1:03:07] unadulterated word is being ministered
[1:03:10] then it's reaching that place of
[1:03:12] speaking to people's hearts and letting
[1:03:14] that word speak back to them yes to
[1:03:16] bring rapture faith a unity
[1:03:20] a unity of faith
[1:03:22] because this is going to be in a moment
[1:03:24] the twinkling of an eye for the entire
[1:03:26] bride body
[1:03:27] internationally and the moment and
[1:03:29] twinkling of an eye so it's got to be a
[1:03:31] unity
[1:03:32] it can't just be happening here and not
[1:03:34] happening over there right it can't just
[1:03:36] be happening in this country and not in
[1:03:38] the other countries
[1:03:39] it can't just be happening to this
[1:03:41] believer not this believer it's got to
[1:03:43] be a unity yes
[1:03:45] it's got to be an entire body coming
[1:03:47] together under that headship of the
[1:03:50] revealed word the word speaking back
[1:03:53] amen
[1:03:54] the word speaking to your heart right
[1:03:56] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[1:03:59] the word of god brought to you by jesus
[1:04:02] christ
[1:04:03] not some company not some broadcast or
[1:04:06] something around the world but brought
[1:04:07] to you by jesus christ
[1:04:10] praise the lord by faith
[1:04:12] faith is coming to bring a unity of
[1:04:15] faith to speak to people that living
[1:04:17] word
[1:04:19] that word that's a lie that speaks to
[1:04:21] you and lives through you amen now how
[1:04:24] much faith think of this how much faith
[1:04:28] does it take
[1:04:29] to bring a body change
[1:04:33] you ever thought of that
[1:04:34] how much faith do you think it would
[1:04:36] take
[1:04:37] to cause your body to be changed into
[1:04:40] incorruption immortality
[1:04:46] how much
[1:04:48] how much faith does it take
[1:04:51] for a rapture to happen
[1:04:53] for a group of people internationally
[1:04:57] when a faith is the great of a mustard
[1:05:00] seed can move mountains
[1:05:04] faith is the grain of a mustard seed is
[1:05:06] enough to move mountains how much faith
[1:05:09] is it going to take to cause a body
[1:05:12] change
[1:05:14] amen you ever thought of that because
[1:05:16] people always well we've got to have
[1:05:17] enough faith or our faith's got to be
[1:05:19] increased we got to get more faith how
[1:05:20] much faith does it take
[1:05:23] amen
[1:05:24] how much faith does it take friend
[1:05:27] look when you look back at abraham and
[1:05:29] sarah you look at abraham and sarah and
[1:05:32] see by the word again
[1:05:35] hebrews 11 11 through faith also sarah
[1:05:39] this is the same scripture we read last
[1:05:40] week
[1:05:41] sarah herself
[1:05:43] now talked about abraham you know what
[1:05:45] let's just read that it's it's only 11
[1:05:47] 30.
[1:05:48] eighth first by faith abraham when he
[1:05:51] was called to go out into a place which
[1:05:53] he should after receive for an
[1:05:55] inheritance
[1:05:57] he obeyed and he went out not knowing
[1:05:59] whether he went
[1:06:01] by faith he sojourned in the land of
[1:06:03] promises in a strange country
[1:06:05] dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and
[1:06:07] jacob the heirs with him of the same
[1:06:10] promise for he looked for a city which
[1:06:12] had foundations whose builder and
[1:06:14] neighbor is god amen brother brown
[1:06:17] teaches us that in future home that that
[1:06:20] that abrah he believed abraham had a
[1:06:23] communion with
[1:06:24] fellowship with melchizedek right on
[1:06:26] that spot right
[1:06:28] right on that spot
[1:06:31] because what abraham was looking for
[1:06:34] was not going to be manifested in our
[1:06:36] time element
[1:06:38] that city that abraham was looking for
[1:06:41] is the city that we're longing to go
[1:06:43] through go to that will be after the
[1:06:45] white throne judgment right amen after
[1:06:48] the marriage said for the lamb after the
[1:06:50] white throne judgment right yeah
[1:06:52] that city he believes set up right there
[1:06:55] with the exact spot robron said abraham
[1:06:57] and melchizedek had had fellowship and
[1:06:59] communion right on that spot
[1:07:02] but whose builder foundations the
[1:07:05] builder and maker is god
[1:07:07] through faith also sarah herself
[1:07:09] received strength to conceive seed and
[1:07:11] was delivered of a child when she was
[1:07:13] past age because she judged him faithful
[1:07:17] who had promised
[1:07:19] amen now
[1:07:21] what about the story of abraham and
[1:07:24] sarah in genesis
[1:07:26] would even remotely cause you to believe
[1:07:29] that they had the kind of faith that it
[1:07:31] took to bring a body change
[1:07:36] what is there and i'm not talking about
[1:07:38] romans
[1:07:40] i'm not talking about new testament
[1:07:42] reflection of abraham and sarah written
[1:07:44] by god
[1:07:46] i'm talking about the story of abraham
[1:07:48] and sarah written in genesis as it
[1:07:51] happened right
[1:07:52] what about their lives now i know
[1:07:54] abraham left and he went out and obeyed
[1:07:56] god's word yeah of course he stumbled a
[1:07:58] couple times he impregnated hagar
[1:08:00] they're still fighting over there today
[1:08:02] ishmael isaac still fighting over there
[1:08:04] today
[1:08:06] but but
[1:08:07] but the bomb woman will never be heir
[1:08:10] with the free woman right right
[1:08:12] it belongs to god's chosen right and
[1:08:14] that was isaac
[1:08:16] anyway
[1:08:18] but what about this scenario when they
[1:08:20] got to that age and god
[1:08:23] talk to abraham abraham i'm going to
[1:08:25] visit you abraham i'm going to visit you
[1:08:27] my promise is abraham i'm going to visit
[1:08:29] you even change their names from abraham
[1:08:31] to abraham and sarai to sarah even
[1:08:34] change their names and i'm going to
[1:08:36] visit you i'm going to meet with you and
[1:08:39] god continually telling abraham this is
[1:08:41] going to happen
[1:08:43] hagar no no no no abra abraham my
[1:08:46] promise is going to come through sarah
[1:08:49] but she's barren doesn't matter
[1:08:51] amen
[1:08:52] when god came with the investigating
[1:08:54] judgment angels
[1:08:57] amen when he came with them
[1:09:00] and abraham stood there and
[1:09:02] and and god had his back to the tent
[1:09:06] and he was explaining to abraham what he
[1:09:08] was going to do and that this child was
[1:09:10] going to come through sarah she laughed
[1:09:12] at him
[1:09:14] she like in fact brother adam said that
[1:09:16] god would have destroyed cher right
[1:09:17] there if she wasn't part of abraham and
[1:09:19] the promise right for laughing in the
[1:09:21] face of god she laughed at it so what
[1:09:24] about those stories
[1:09:26] would even remotely lead us to believe
[1:09:28] that they had the kind of faith that it
[1:09:30] would take to bring a body change
[1:09:35] amen
[1:09:36] that's quiet didn't it
[1:09:38] quiet when i thought the same thing for
[1:09:40] when they thought came to me
[1:09:42] what about their stories read their
[1:09:43] stories again go back to genesis read
[1:09:46] about abraham and sarah yeah right and
[1:09:48] show me
[1:09:49] yeah abraham walked by faith god
[1:09:51] continually talked to abraham too
[1:09:54] but what what was it that would bring
[1:09:56] enough faith to cause a body change
[1:10:00] now this reverts back to my question my
[1:10:03] prior question how much faith does it
[1:10:05] take to bring a body change
[1:10:09] if faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[1:10:11] the word
[1:10:12] and god's revealing that word to you and
[1:10:14] that word is becoming settled in your
[1:10:16] heart then that faith is in you whether
[1:10:18] you realize it or not
[1:10:20] and when the time comes as i said before
[1:10:22] when the time now we're talking i'm
[1:10:24] talking about believers yes i'm not
[1:10:27] talking about make believers unbelievers
[1:10:29] i'm not talking about people playing
[1:10:30] church or thinking their bride i'm
[1:10:33] talking about the bride of jesus christ
[1:10:36] okay amen because people still i still
[1:10:38] give people all this this brides and a
[1:10:41] mess no friend she is not
[1:10:44] i cannot make that any plainer or
[1:10:46] clearer in my opinion she is not amen
[1:10:51] she is the virtuous sinless
[1:10:55] a bride of jesus christ
[1:10:58] unadulterated word herself
[1:11:01] she is not out of place
[1:11:06] she's where she's supposed to be yes
[1:11:10] but we always expect again that great
[1:11:13] sound to go off some great thing to
[1:11:16] think oh i i
[1:11:18] you know i can do anything
[1:11:22] but that faith is being built in you as
[1:11:24] you hear the word yes it has to be yes
[1:11:27] because that's the bible
[1:11:29] it's being built in the bride of jesus
[1:11:32] christ because she is the one to whom
[1:11:34] that word is speaking back to
[1:11:37] and as that word is speaking back to you
[1:11:39] and witnessing and revealing itself to
[1:11:41] you it's lifting you to it and elevating
[1:11:44] you to a place that first of all makes
[1:11:47] you want more there you go second of all
[1:11:49] to a point that when that appointed time
[1:11:51] happens friend it's going to happen
[1:11:54] instantaneously to every bride member
[1:11:56] that's alive and remain across the
[1:11:58] planet
[1:12:00] amen
[1:12:02] and it'll be by faith
[1:12:03] a unity of faith
[1:12:05] so what kind of faith did abraham and
[1:12:07] sarah have
[1:12:09] it says right here it says in genesis
[1:12:12] that sarah was past the age of fairy
[1:12:16] she was her body was beyond bearing
[1:12:18] children
[1:12:20] friend she was 90 years old
[1:12:25] could you imagine sister pat being 90
[1:12:27] and having a kid oh no
[1:12:32] sister norman no
[1:12:43] could you imagine after
[1:12:45] she was past that age dead wound milk
[1:12:47] veins dried up and god still anointed
[1:12:50] and blessed her enough to be able to
[1:12:51] bear a child
[1:12:53] to be able to have enough faith the
[1:12:55] bible says here
[1:12:57] through faith
[1:12:59] so sarah had to have the faith yes
[1:13:02] where was it
[1:13:04] i can't find it in genesis
[1:13:06] right but it was there yeah
[1:13:09] amen
[1:13:10] sometimes i look at my life and i say
[1:13:12] faith what faith where is your faith
[1:13:15] you pray for this and this and this over
[1:13:17] and over and over you you approach god
[1:13:20] about this this and this over and over
[1:13:21] and over where's your faith
[1:13:24] amen you do the same thing i do
[1:13:29] the simple answer is it's there okay you
[1:13:32] know the problem we have
[1:13:34] the body changing faith isn't
[1:13:37] necessarily based on the amount of faith
[1:13:39] you have
[1:13:42] understand
[1:13:44] it's not necessarily based on the amount
[1:13:46] of faith you have
[1:13:48] now it is
[1:13:49] but not simply based on that
[1:13:52] but it's also based on the amount of
[1:13:54] faith
[1:13:55] the amount of freedom your faith has to
[1:13:58] operate
[1:13:59] that's the problem a lot of people run
[1:14:01] into
[1:14:03] the freedom to be able to allow the
[1:14:05] faith to operate in your life
[1:14:09] the faith may be growing the faith may
[1:14:11] be building the faith may be there but
[1:14:13] does the faith have the freedom to
[1:14:15] operate in you as it should right right
[1:14:19] brother branham kept his life so clean
[1:14:21] and so pure
[1:14:23] that when the time come there was
[1:14:25] nothing to clog the channel of the faith
[1:14:28] he needed to reach god for the people
[1:14:32] yeah amen amen now it
[1:14:34] didn't always happen right but multiple
[1:14:37] of course on most occasions it didn't
[1:14:42] rid the hindrance that's the best thing
[1:14:45] read the thing that hinders your faith
[1:14:48] the most
[1:14:49] unclog the channels right
[1:14:52] first john tells us that if our heart
[1:14:54] condemn us
[1:14:56] we can't have confidence in god
[1:14:59] what's the confidence the confidence is
[1:15:00] faith if our heart condemns what is that
[1:15:03] that's a clog
[1:15:04] if you've got a clog in your sink you
[1:15:05] call roto-rooter or whoever mr plumber
[1:15:08] or whatever they are you call a plumber
[1:15:11] you get out of a a device or something
[1:15:14] you try to unclog the drain
[1:15:16] because no water is going to go through
[1:15:18] that pipe as long as it's clogged
[1:15:21] and if there's something clogging the
[1:15:23] channels of your faith friend you've got
[1:15:25] to unclog it or your faith is never
[1:15:27] going to reach the place it needs to get
[1:15:29] what you're praying about amen or what
[1:15:32] you're needing from god
[1:15:34] so the faith may be absolutely there but
[1:15:37] the hindrances and the things of life
[1:15:39] clog it up so much it's not able to get
[1:15:41] through
[1:15:44] got to clean that channel yeah
[1:15:46] unclog the pipe
[1:15:49] get rid of all the hindrances that that
[1:15:51] keep our faith bound
[1:15:54] because then it comes to us and your
[1:15:56] heart condemns you and don't forget
[1:15:58] there's a devil out there that's going
[1:16:00] to try to ride you every moment of the
[1:16:02] of the day
[1:16:04] he's going gonna be on you every second
[1:16:06] of the way yeah trying to convince you
[1:16:08] what a horrible lowdown rotten person
[1:16:10] you are and the horrible rotten thing
[1:16:12] you did yesterday or the thing you said
[1:16:14] this morning or how bad a person you are
[1:16:17] right that's the devil yeah amen
[1:16:20] he's good at reminding us of every
[1:16:22] single one of our failures in this life
[1:16:26] amen
[1:16:27] but you know what i like to do i like to
[1:16:29] remind him the fact that he is
[1:16:31] a failure and a mistake amen well i
[1:16:34] don't want to say a mistake because god
[1:16:35] made it that's not one mistake but what
[1:16:38] he became
[1:16:39] he is himself a failure
[1:16:42] not just does he fail he is a failure
[1:16:45] that's all he is amen
[1:16:47] but he'll remind you all the time
[1:16:50] so you've got the best thing to do is
[1:16:51] keep all the clan the channels clear
[1:16:54] to keep everything uncluttered
[1:16:57] the faith that's there
[1:17:00] again how much faith does it take
[1:17:03] if it takes a grain to move a mountain
[1:17:04] how much it takes for a body change
[1:17:06] whatever it takes
[1:17:08] that faith needs to have the freedom to
[1:17:10] operate in your life
[1:17:12] even if it's a simple headache yes or
[1:17:15] toothache or whatever it is amen see
[1:17:20] we have ailments and illnesses
[1:17:24] friend look they used to bring people in
[1:17:26] cots
[1:17:28] and stretchers and wheelchairs to
[1:17:30] brother branham's meetings right
[1:17:33] when is the last time you saw somebody
[1:17:35] wheeled into a church service in a in a
[1:17:38] stretcher or a cot
[1:17:42] why not
[1:17:43] yeah
[1:17:44] is god not god today amen
[1:17:48] is he not the same today as he was then
[1:17:51] amen amen
[1:17:53] is he not able to heal do we not have
[1:17:56] the faith
[1:17:59] friend i'm here to tell you it's not the
[1:18:01] fact that this bride has less faith than
[1:18:03] brother branham but the channels get
[1:18:05] clogged that's right and people lose
[1:18:07] their confidence that's right and then
[1:18:10] you and then you see what you see right
[1:18:12] i like sister pat's testimony last week
[1:18:15] she's supposed to be walking she walking
[1:18:17] doesn't care just do it just walk
[1:18:21] take the next step take the next step
[1:18:23] hold that hurt take the next little that
[1:18:25] hurt take the next one defy that devil
[1:18:29] defile everything about your body that's
[1:18:31] screaming at you telling you you can't
[1:18:33] do this and yes by jesus christ and the
[1:18:35] word of god i can yes that's right by
[1:18:38] faith i am i will
[1:18:41] amen and unclogged that channel
[1:18:45] that's just something that he remember
[1:18:47] brother adam said healing is is a is a
[1:18:50] temporary resurrection
[1:18:52] amen he said divine healing is a
[1:18:54] temporary uh resurrection yes it's a
[1:18:58] it's a changing of your body
[1:19:01] it's a taking that body from a sick
[1:19:03] condition to a well-conditioned
[1:19:06] yeah which satan cannot do all right
[1:19:10] say satan cannot do that only god can
[1:19:13] create right so if god's creating and
[1:19:16] creating it out of you then what is the
[1:19:17] hindrance of our faith
[1:19:20] why was the faith able to operate the
[1:19:23] way it did with brother branham when
[1:19:25] people brought cops and stretchers and
[1:19:26] wheelchairs of people in
[1:19:29] hulk lame blind
[1:19:31] dead
[1:19:33] remember the quarter rich the other day
[1:19:34] that woman who came in with her dead
[1:19:36] baby
[1:19:37] she was sitting there all day waiting
[1:19:39] for those meetings to start just so she
[1:19:40] could get that
[1:19:42] her dead baby to life right to a place
[1:19:45] where there was life
[1:19:47] amen
[1:19:48] and then the word goes forth the word
[1:19:51] gets spoken
[1:19:52] they let people set their
[1:19:54] whole service and let the word minister
[1:19:56] to them let the words speak to them
[1:19:59] faith comes by hearing the word
[1:20:01] amen the bible says the word went forth
[1:20:04] and
[1:20:04] healed them
[1:20:07] that's just a simp that's just a simple
[1:20:09] spiritual application to what the the
[1:20:12] grand scheme of the whole thing is going
[1:20:14] to be with the
[1:20:15] with rapturing faith
[1:20:18] the grand episode of rapturing faith
[1:20:20] that's just a small part of it has god
[1:20:23] ever healed you
[1:20:25] of anything amen amen anything
[1:20:28] yes
[1:20:29] well if he's done it once casey do it
[1:20:31] again
[1:20:33] do you think god gets glory out of you
[1:20:35] being sick
[1:20:36] you think god gets glory out of you
[1:20:38] being an invalid
[1:20:40] or poor
[1:20:41] god gets no glory out of you being
[1:20:43] downtrodden and and
[1:20:45] and sick right
[1:20:48] he gets no glory from that
[1:20:50] not to mention the fact that you can't
[1:20:52] perform the purpose that god put in your
[1:20:54] life unless you're well
[1:20:58] amen amen break those chains yes amen
[1:21:02] loose that spirit amen let god have the
[1:21:05] full reign and unclog that pipe amen let
[1:21:08] that faith move yes let that faith be
[1:21:11] able to operate and have the freedom to
[1:21:13] do what it needs to do in our lives yes
[1:21:15] amen
[1:21:17] that's awesome you still brother you
[1:21:19] that sounds simple it is
[1:21:21] it's the devil that complicates the
[1:21:23] whole thing to make you think it is
[1:21:25] unattainable right all the rapture must
[1:21:27] be eons away no it is not
[1:21:30] not in my opinion right now nobody knows
[1:21:33] today or the hour and i don't either
[1:21:35] and i'm not going to tell you what day
[1:21:36] or time it is but friend i can tell you
[1:21:38] it is the season for
[1:21:40] it amen we're living in that time of the
[1:21:44] body change of the rapture
[1:21:46] you know all the a lot of going by the
[1:21:48] way of the grave yeah and when they go
[1:21:49] by the way of grave what happens to them
[1:21:51] they get a body change very much amen
[1:21:55] and that celestial body will come and
[1:21:57] pick up this terrestrial body in a in a
[1:21:59] glorified condition and we'll all go to
[1:22:01] meet him and so shall we ever be with
[1:22:04] the lord right amen
[1:22:07] my contention to you my exhortation to
[1:22:09] you again today friend is that faith is
[1:22:11] there
[1:22:13] that faith continues to build my my
[1:22:15] challenge to all of us including yours
[1:22:18] truly is continue to stay in that word
[1:22:21] amen
[1:22:22] continue to let that word speak to you
[1:22:25] continue to pray and let god reveal and
[1:22:27] speak back that word to you
[1:22:30] amen
[1:22:31] when that when that voice spoke to me
[1:22:33] and said go back and study that there's
[1:22:35] more to that it didn't just happen right
[1:22:37] there i had to go back in my study i had
[1:22:39] to talk to the lord i had to pray about
[1:22:41] it i had to look at it and see lord what
[1:22:43] is it in there
[1:22:45] it didn't just happen like that and then
[1:22:47] and then when it broke forth is praise
[1:22:49] the lord amen amen and then that spoke
[1:22:51] to me right
[1:22:53] that word spoke to me it said that's
[1:22:55] exactly right it's the word speaking
[1:22:57] back it's a conjunction of god speaking
[1:23:00] back to me the word speaking as a living
[1:23:02] oracle to me amen yeah amen
[1:23:05] those channels have got to be unclogged
[1:23:07] friend
[1:23:08] those channels have got to be uh um
[1:23:11] uh
[1:23:12] free had the freedom to operate look
[1:23:15] what brother branham said here and works
[1:23:16] his faith expressed
[1:23:19] appropriate message i guess under
[1:23:21] circumstances amen
[1:23:25] works his faith expressed so well
[1:23:26] brother united saying his faith they say
[1:23:28] faith well
[1:23:30] it's got it's got to be faith yes i'll
[1:23:32] agree with you
[1:23:34] but if it but if there's hindrances
[1:23:36] there it's not going to operate the way
[1:23:37] it's supposed to
[1:23:39] it's not gonna your faith
[1:23:43] let's just say
[1:23:45] that that right now everybody in here
[1:23:48] has rapturing faith
[1:23:50] it is in you now you have it right and
[1:23:52] you know brother ramsey said rapturing
[1:23:53] faith lies in the message
[1:23:55] amen that's well i like to try to listen
[1:23:57] to the messages as much as we can
[1:24:00] because it's in there amen
[1:24:03] praise the lord but
[1:24:05] let's just say everybody has rapturing
[1:24:07] faith right now this just just for for
[1:24:10] example just
[1:24:11] talking if if everybody in here has rap
[1:24:14] stream faith
[1:24:15] what will it take
[1:24:17] for that faith to come forth
[1:24:20] for something simple in your life like
[1:24:22] an ailment you have right now
[1:24:24] or something you're praying for for your
[1:24:26] family or or your loved one or or friend
[1:24:29] or another church member
[1:24:32] what would it take
[1:24:35] well let me just read this to you
[1:24:39] works his faith expressed
[1:24:42] he said we allow it sometimes we say
[1:24:44] he's talking about ministers
[1:24:46] he said well this guy just didn't have
[1:24:48] enough faith this guy didn't do this and
[1:24:50] this
[1:24:52] if they come up and pray for him and
[1:24:54] they don't get healed so well they just
[1:24:55] didn't have the faith
[1:24:57] well they just didn't believe they just
[1:24:58] didn't do this and this that's what
[1:25:00] brother brown's getting there
[1:25:02] he said there's a reason there for that
[1:25:04] listen real close now
[1:25:06] there's a reason there for that there's
[1:25:09] a reason sometimes it's unconfessed sin
[1:25:12] right now what is unconfessed sin
[1:25:16] that is a big nasty hairy clog in your
[1:25:19] bathroom sink
[1:25:22] amen
[1:25:23] it's clogging the channel right because
[1:25:25] your heart's condemning you because you
[1:25:27] know you're wrong
[1:25:30] when you should do what you know is
[1:25:31] right yes
[1:25:33] he says sometimes it's unconfessed sin
[1:25:35] it's not the faith
[1:25:37] it's not saying well he doesn't have
[1:25:39] faith no it wasn't the faith it was the
[1:25:41] unconfessed sin
[1:25:43] but the man didn't say he didn't have
[1:25:44] enough faith he just said he had them
[1:25:46] confess sin or sometime that would be
[1:25:48] what it is or something to a clog in the
[1:25:52] channel is what i mean right i believe
[1:25:54] that's what he meant
[1:25:56] unconfessed sin is gonna clog that
[1:25:58] channel right unconfessed sin is gonna
[1:26:01] keep from that faith allowing that faith
[1:26:03] to operate the way it's supposed to
[1:26:05] it'll do it every time unconfessed sin
[1:26:08] brother says you could put a gallon of
[1:26:10] oil on that person and scream till you
[1:26:12] got a horse but that devil has every
[1:26:15] right to stay right there right
[1:26:17] yes
[1:26:18] that devil will not move
[1:26:20] no sir he said you've got to confess
[1:26:23] that
[1:26:24] make that right now he's talking
[1:26:26] specifically about unconfessing i'm
[1:26:28] talking about things that clog the
[1:26:30] channels
[1:26:31] things that clog up that faith or clog
[1:26:34] up that connection that we should have
[1:26:36] with the lord
[1:26:37] that allows that faith to freely operate
[1:26:40] amen amen
[1:26:42] i'm going to i'm going to believe this
[1:26:44] i'm going to pray for this i'm going to
[1:26:45] speak this and and it's going to happen
[1:26:48] and there's just no doubt about it yeah
[1:26:50] there's no questioning it there's no
[1:26:52] back-up plan it's going to happen amen
[1:26:55] amen
[1:26:57] praise the lord yes amen it's going to
[1:26:59] operate with god's perfect will in our
[1:27:00] lives too as it should it has to yes but
[1:27:04] if our heart doesn't condemn us then
[1:27:06] have we confidence to god
[1:27:08] does not condemn us
[1:27:11] then we have confidence to god if the
[1:27:13] channels aren't clogged then we have the
[1:27:14] faith right then it's or or it has the
[1:27:17] ability to operate
[1:27:19] amen it has the ability to operate and
[1:27:22] that's what and that's what has to come
[1:27:25] in our lives whatever it is the channel
[1:27:28] has to be clear for that faith to
[1:27:30] continue to operate and it will
[1:27:33] amend this in this bride you say well
[1:27:36] where is faith it's there friend
[1:27:40] and again i'll contend with i'll contend
[1:27:42] this with anybody
[1:27:44] it has to be there
[1:27:46] because that's what the word says yeah
[1:27:50] faith comes by hearing right and hearing
[1:27:52] by
[1:27:54] and if that
[1:27:55] person is born again now
[1:27:58] it has to be a born-again christian i'm
[1:28:00] talking about the bride again not just
[1:28:02] somebody claims to be or whatever then
[1:28:04] now then that faith is going to be there
[1:28:07] amen
[1:28:08] it doesn't look like it to abraham and
[1:28:09] sarah but it was there yes it didn't
[1:28:12] look like that and how many places
[1:28:14] scripture you can look at how
[1:28:16] why how could this have happened
[1:28:19] i mean jesus
[1:28:21] the lunatic boy was falling in the water
[1:28:23] in the fire and his disciples came after
[1:28:25] god had just endured them with power and
[1:28:28] they come and they try to cure it and
[1:28:29] they couldn't do it yeah now we know
[1:28:31] brother brown tells us epileptic spirit
[1:28:34] is a very difficult spirit a very hard
[1:28:36] demon to pray off
[1:28:38] but they couldn't do it
[1:28:40] jesus called him perverse
[1:28:43] faithless and perverse
[1:28:46] imagine jesus coming to his own
[1:28:48] disciples he hand chose in front of the
[1:28:50] crowd of people that was standing there
[1:28:51] and calling his own chosen faithless and
[1:28:54] perverse
[1:28:57] how long did i have to be with you
[1:28:59] how long am i going to have to suffer
[1:29:00] you bring him to me
[1:29:02] amen
[1:29:03] jesus rebuked the devil he left the very
[1:29:05] hour yeah they came to him said jesus
[1:29:07] why couldn't we do that it's because of
[1:29:09] your lack of faith
[1:29:12] he said if you have faith the grain of a
[1:29:14] mustard seed you can move the mountains
[1:29:15] but it only comes by prayer and fasting
[1:29:18] yes right amen
[1:29:20] prayer and fat not praying fast
[1:29:22] prayer and fasting amen amen amen
[1:29:26] and then that because that helps bring
[1:29:29] faith in your life
[1:29:31] i i'm not going to ask for hands but
[1:29:35] how many of you have a regular prayer
[1:29:37] life don't raise your hand but how many
[1:29:39] of you have a regular prayer life
[1:29:42] if you have a regular prayer life when
[1:29:43] you come out from your prayer closet or
[1:29:45] whatever it is wherever it is
[1:29:47] whatever time it is
[1:29:48] your prayer time
[1:29:50] do you not do you not feel closer to the
[1:29:52] lord
[1:29:54] do you not feel better about everything
[1:29:57] everybody
[1:29:59] it's when all those spirits and the
[1:30:01] things of the world start pounding you
[1:30:03] and bombarding you that starts weighing
[1:30:05] all that stuff down
[1:30:07] but when you're in prayer
[1:30:09] and i encourage you to fast
[1:30:11] amen as you all know i fast every sunday
[1:30:13] morning
[1:30:14] i don't eat anything before church on
[1:30:16] sunday even we had church at 1 30.
[1:30:19] i didn't eat till 4 o'clock in the
[1:30:20] afternoon because that's just my time of
[1:30:22] the lord i got that because i used to i
[1:30:25] started fasting every wednesday in north
[1:30:27] carolina
[1:30:28] and i got to work i i just and fasting
[1:30:31] to me isn't just missing a meal
[1:30:34] some people say well uh fasting is
[1:30:36] starving yourself no it's not right no
[1:30:39] no fasting is taking the time that you
[1:30:41] would spend gorging yourself at a meal
[1:30:44] for the lord
[1:30:46] and taking that time for the lord
[1:30:48] and spending that time with him
[1:30:51] i i've had people on wednesdays at my
[1:30:53] job come ask me let's go to eat lunch no
[1:30:56] no i don't go to get my car i'd go in in
[1:30:58] a parking lot somewhere where nobody
[1:31:00] would sit there and pray just talk to
[1:31:02] the lord or whatever it was
[1:31:04] i i wasn't a monk and doing you know i
[1:31:07] just talked to the lord right amen
[1:31:09] yeah and it makes such a huge difference
[1:31:12] yes
[1:31:13] fasting and praying praying and fasting
[1:31:17] right and
[1:31:18] and when you do that
[1:31:20] again my question is when you do that
[1:31:23] don't you feel better
[1:31:25] don't you feel all stared out and you
[1:31:28] feel like all your sins are gone and
[1:31:31] you feel like god heard you and you feel
[1:31:33] like uh you feel like a renewed person
[1:31:37] amen well then what is it then if it's
[1:31:40] that for that time then then how about
[1:31:42] if it's just a continual process in our
[1:31:44] lives
[1:31:46] that we keep going
[1:31:47] that we do all the time every day you
[1:31:50] know paul said pray without ceasing
[1:31:51] right you know obviously we don't set in
[1:31:54] our classes 24 7 but it's just a simple
[1:31:58] purposeful continual meditation people
[1:32:01] like to do their yogas and stuff and
[1:32:03] their meditation and all that you know
[1:32:05] that's hinduism i'm sorry i just don't
[1:32:07] do that i do what the bible says yes and
[1:32:10] there is a godly meditation there's a
[1:32:13] scripturally right way to do it but it's
[1:32:16] between you and the lord jesus yes not
[1:32:18] some dead god or something amen he said
[1:32:21] it brings inner peace what brings inner
[1:32:23] peace is jesus christ in your life amen
[1:32:26] that brings inner peace and you know it
[1:32:28] and when you're there and you know it
[1:32:30] that brings faith
[1:32:32] it brings an unwavering faith yes
[1:32:35] unclogs the channels yeah amen unclogs
[1:32:38] the channels because you know when you
[1:32:40] talk to the lord and you ask god god
[1:32:41] forgive me you know he's done it
[1:32:44] you know that you know that god's
[1:32:45] forgive you of your sins the
[1:32:47] transgressions mistakes you make
[1:32:50] the challenge for us as humans is the
[1:32:52] next time we go in prayer with him
[1:32:55] make it less things he has to forgive
[1:32:57] you for
[1:33:00] amen
[1:33:01] and then the next time you go on prayer
[1:33:03] with them make them to be make their
[1:33:05] less things he has to forgive you for
[1:33:07] yeah and then less things he has to
[1:33:09] forgive you people say oh god will
[1:33:11] forgive me yeah he will but that's not
[1:33:13] the point that's not where we're headed
[1:33:14] right
[1:33:15] amen
[1:33:16] we're headed to a point that we couldn't
[1:33:18] do anything to be displeasing to him
[1:33:21] amen nothing that would displease the
[1:33:24] lord what does that do that brings faith
[1:33:27] yes
[1:33:28] that unclogs the channel

[1:34:04] time yeah i told you about our song
[1:34:06] leader in north carolina when we went
[1:34:08] when he's been 30 years now but when
[1:34:11] brother richard my old pastor put him up
[1:34:13] there to lead songs he'd come up with a
[1:34:15] book
[1:34:16] and and he would go
[1:34:18] 42.
[1:34:20] he'd stare at the wall and sing
[1:34:22] 94.
[1:34:24] he's here at the wall and singing
[1:34:26] 126. he'd stare at the wand sing and
[1:34:29] he'd take his book and he go sit down
[1:34:31] yeah as much you could get out of him
[1:34:34] really
[1:34:35] and now he's placed a guitar he's up
[1:34:37] there singing and he runs up and down
[1:34:39] and praise the lord and amen
[1:34:42] it's just god hit him it changes
[1:34:45] everything amen so i appreciate that but
[1:34:48] just just this morning in this service
[1:34:53] just the power of god moving through
[1:34:55] here friend there should there shouldn't
[1:34:57] be one single person
[1:35:00] leave from here sick today amen there
[1:35:03] should not be
[1:35:05] amen the power the presence of the holy
[1:35:08] spirit is here right now and there
[1:35:10] shouldn't be one single sickness leave
[1:35:12] here not one
[1:35:15] praise the lord i believe that
[1:35:18] channels amen become unclogged amen amen
[1:35:21] don't let the devil dig those things up
[1:35:23] that you put under the blood and try to
[1:35:24] convince you of them yes amen amen
[1:35:27] say that spirit it's gone it's done amen
[1:35:30] i'm a new creature in christ jesus
[1:35:32] amen that clog is unchanneled that's the
[1:35:35] kind of rapturing faith we're gonna need
[1:35:37] that's the kind of body changing faith i
[1:35:40] want to say something else too friend
[1:35:43] last week when i talked about
[1:35:45] um
[1:35:46] the message in the word i wasn't trying
[1:35:49] to belittle the gifts of the spirit now
[1:35:51] nobody said this to me but i kind of
[1:35:53] felt that when i was sitting there i
[1:35:54] didn't want you to feel like that i was
[1:35:56] trying to
[1:35:57] put down uh speaking in tongues or or
[1:36:00] the gifts of the spirit in any way
[1:36:03] the gifts of the spirit should be
[1:36:04] operating in every local assembly
[1:36:06] according to brother brown
[1:36:08] he said that's what keeps the church
[1:36:09] clean that's right i wasn't trying to
[1:36:11] belittle it but i want to put it in his
[1:36:13] proper place yes amen and you cannot
[1:36:16] major on minor and those gifts are a
[1:36:19] minor the major is the word christ
[1:36:21] yeah that's that's the point i wasn't
[1:36:23] trying to belittle it but put it in its
[1:36:25] place the word is what's the prominent
[1:36:28] uh part amen the word and the word
[1:36:31] speaking back to you
[1:36:33] amen let that word speak back to you
[1:36:36] let that faith grow yes faith grow sure
[1:36:39] i'm not saying that their faith
[1:36:40] shouldn't grow but the challenge too is
[1:36:43] continue to stay in christ amen read his
[1:36:46] word listen to that message
[1:36:49] amen
[1:36:50] i'd say come to church but you're here
[1:36:53] but that's part of it too yes amen and
[1:36:55] let that word speak to you
[1:36:57] praise the lord it doesn't just come
[1:36:58] from newton bennett
[1:37:00] amen it comes from
[1:37:02] god's got ministers all over the world
[1:37:05] not to mention the message yes the tapes
[1:37:08] which is christ anyway
[1:37:10] christ ministered to you
[1:37:14] the cohesiveness of it
[1:37:17] will bring that rapturing faith and that
[1:37:20] and that rapturing faith
[1:37:22] remember faith operates by
[1:37:25] love
[1:37:26] amen
[1:37:28] that faith operate by love
[1:37:31] praise the lord let's stand if we could
[1:37:34] i'm going to stop there
[1:37:40] praise the lord
[1:37:50] amen
[1:37:51] you love the lord jesus
[1:37:54] amen
[1:37:55] i'm so thankful that he is always
[1:37:58] ever present with us yes amen
[1:38:03] praise the lord 493 let's sing this
[1:38:06] chorus
[1:38:11] amen 493
[1:38:13] i want to live the way he wants me to
[1:38:15] live we're living the way he wants us to
[1:38:17] live friend then i believe that channels
[1:38:20] will be clear yeah right amen channels
[1:38:22] will be clear
[1:38:23] you know sometimes we get in such a
[1:38:25] desperation which brother man talked
[1:38:27] about desperation
[1:38:30] sometimes we'll get in such a
[1:38:31] desperation that all the other things
[1:38:33] are just washed away yeah there won't be
[1:38:36] it they'll
[1:38:37] that desperation will draw a tunnel
[1:38:39] vision in and all you can see is christ
[1:38:41] you can't see all the other stuff around
[1:38:43] and that's all the things that hinder
[1:38:45] all the other things around us all the
[1:38:47] hindering stuff so i put blinders on
[1:38:50] horses so they'll just keep staying on
[1:38:51] the right path they won't see all the
[1:38:53] kids playing over here and all the
[1:38:55] lights flashing over here
[1:38:56] they'll just keep the focus and
[1:38:58] desperation don't do that
[1:39:00] and that's what a lot of times you get
[1:39:01] you see supernatural things people get
[1:39:03] into a desperate condition and that
[1:39:05] tunnel vision comes and all you see is
[1:39:07] the healing
[1:39:09] it'll be a vision like brother random
[1:39:11] had with those people so many times
[1:39:13] where he says i see you running down the
[1:39:15] street and they're sitting there in a
[1:39:16] wheelchair
[1:39:18] crippled
[1:39:19] i see you brother running down the
[1:39:21] street god's showing him he's entering
[1:39:23] into that vision
[1:39:24] man gets up and runs down the aisle
[1:39:27] it's that same thing it's that vision
[1:39:29] you might not see that vision the way
[1:39:31] brother brown saw it as a literal uh
[1:39:34] focus in front of you but you see that
[1:39:36] vision as you step into it
[1:39:38] a well person
[1:39:40] or whatever it is
[1:39:42] you see that as it is
[1:39:44] and nothing else than then everything
[1:39:46] else leads away and faith meets that
[1:39:49] need and the healing comes right amen
[1:39:53] praise the lord
[1:39:55] [Music]
[1:40:07] until there's just no
[1:40:10] more to give i want
