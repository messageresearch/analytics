[28:36] the Lord
[28:38] amen I meant to mention to you I was
[28:41] able to go to Sister Green's funeral
[28:43] Tuesday
[28:45] um it wasn't my fault but I apologize
[28:47] for those who tried to stream I don't
[28:50] think this streaming worked out very
[28:51] well I got a lot of negative comments
[28:54] about it it wasn't my streaming it was
[28:57] the streaming of the place so it wasn't
[29:00] a whole lot I could do about it but I
[29:01] noticed
[29:03] um
[29:04] when I was sitting on the on the right
[29:06] hand side facing uh the casket the
[29:11] the lady that the place had the uh had
[29:15] it all set up right here and she went
[29:18] and she fumbled with it she moved it two
[29:20] or three times and she brought it around
[29:22] and she moved it over to the center and
[29:24] she fumbled with it a couple times and
[29:26] she moved it around the other side I
[29:27] thought wow this streaming's not going
[29:29] to be good at all I'm assuming because
[29:31] that had to have been what it was she
[29:33] had a tablet on a stand and uh I'm
[29:36] figuring somehow between all this it
[29:38] just wasn't working so I apologize for
[29:41] that but it was it was a very sweet
[29:43] funeral it actually turned out to be a
[29:46] very nice funeral uh I liked it very
[29:48] much it wasn't uh overly drawn out it
[29:53] wasn't uh
[29:55] nothing out of hand it was just a really
[29:58] wonderful things of course I mean what
[30:00] else could you say about sister green uh
[30:03] it's like I said last week you'd be
[30:04] challenged to find anybody that said
[30:06] anything bad about her and especially
[30:08] anything that she said about anybody but
[30:11] it was a very good it was a very good
[30:13] service most of the family that spoke I
[30:16] was a little surprised that uh some of
[30:19] the people that weren't there but
[30:22] sometimes insinuating circumstances you
[30:24] just never know but but it was a very
[30:27] good it was a very good funeral so I was
[30:30] glad I went I was able to go into the
[30:32] mausoleum I've tried
[30:34] I was as you all know at brother Green's
[30:37] funeral only the family and those that
[30:40] were invited were allowed to go in uh
[30:43] brother Branson tournament so I wasn't
[30:46] one of those invited So and I've tried
[30:49] to go by a couple of times
[30:51] nobody knows this but me and the Lord
[30:54] but as I would drive by I stopped just
[30:58] to see if I could get in to pay my
[30:59] respects to brother green and door was
[31:01] always locked so when when
[31:05] Tuesday when Karen said that anybody's
[31:08] welcome to go I went so that I could go
[31:12] and be there and
[31:13] be where brother green was laid to rest

[35:41] 21.
[35:43] and Adam also unto his wife did the Lord
[35:46] God make coats of skins and clothe them
[35:49] you could be seated
[35:51] amen I want to go over to Saint John
[35:54] chapter 6.
[35:59] and I want to begin on what what is
[36:01] probably going to be more or less a
[36:04] three-part uh section of the holy spirit
[36:08] that we've been speaking on here
[36:11] um the first part of it that I want to
[36:13] title this is a holy spirit part four
[36:15] and I'll title of this Christ the bread
[36:18] of life amen Christ the bread of life
[36:21] amen of course we know back when God was
[36:25] talking about her when God actually
[36:27] proved the action of taking the Lambs
[36:29] and slaying them and taking the skins
[36:32] and throwing them in was just a
[36:34] foreshadow of what we see that Jesus
[36:37] Christ fulfilled this is a part of that
[36:39] Saint John chapter 6
[36:42] we want to begin reading verse 28.
[36:47] Saint John chapter 6 verse 28.
[36:50] amen
[36:52] then said they unto him what shall we do
[36:55] now look at what this this is a group of
[36:57] people let me just background you've
[37:00] maybe not read this in a while but uh
[37:02] this is a group of people that's been
[37:03] following Jesus around it's a group of
[37:06] people that were there when he uh the
[37:09] Lowe's one of the times of the Loaves
[37:11] and Fishes uh the times of Miracles that
[37:14] Jesus performed and of course this is a
[37:17] time where Jesus left and got away from
[37:19] them because they said they wanted to
[37:21] make him king or he perceived they
[37:23] wanted to make him a king and uh then he
[37:26] met his disciples one of the times he
[37:29] was walking on the water and he came
[37:31] into the boat and he ended up on the
[37:33] other side and they came and said how
[37:35] did you know basically they're
[37:36] dumbfounded at how Jesus got there
[37:39] because they saw everybody that went on
[37:40] the boats and they saw the boats that
[37:42] win so when they got there they don't
[37:45] they didn't know how he got there and
[37:47] Jesus said you're following me not
[37:50] because of the levels of fishes but
[37:52] because your belly's got full he said
[37:54] but labor for that meat which endureth
[37:57] and continues and so this is the
[37:59] continuation so Jesus let's just start
[38:02] with the 26th verse then uh from that
[38:06] background Jesus answered uh them and
[38:09] said verily verily I say unto you
[38:12] ye seek me not because you saw the
[38:14] Miracles but because you did eat of the
[38:16] Loaves and were filled labor not for the
[38:19] meat which perishes but for that meat
[38:21] which endureth it unto everlasting life
[38:23] which the son of man shall give you for
[38:27] him that had uh him hath God the Father
[38:30] sealed
[38:31] and then they said unto him
[38:34] what shall we do amen now this sounds a
[38:37] lot like the Rich Young Ruler an
[38:39] understanding that the these were people
[38:42] living under the law and when you live
[38:45] under the law the whole point of living
[38:47] under the law is trying to live your
[38:50] life and do the works good enough to be
[38:54] able to be considered a child of God to
[38:57] be good enough to find favor in the eyes
[39:00] of God that's the whole thing that they
[39:02] were doing we talked about the
[39:04] sacrificing of the animals the Bulls
[39:06] goats lambs and and we talked about all
[39:08] those sacrifices of the covering but the
[39:11] whole thing of living under the law is
[39:13] trying and working and laboring to try
[39:17] to prove yourself worthy enough to be a
[39:21] child of God amen amen that's what it's
[39:23] all that's what living under the law is
[39:25] that's why you see a lot of people today
[39:28] who still
[39:30] defunctually they still live under the
[39:32] law even though Jesus Christ has came
[39:35] and shed his blood they still love under
[39:37] the law and the whole point is to try to
[39:39] work a work just just to try to present
[39:42] themselves and live their lives and work
[39:44] the work that they can work to be good
[39:47] enough to be called a child of God a lot
[39:50] of people still do that today they're
[39:52] not satisfied with simply the blood of
[39:55] Jesus Christ annihilating our sins and
[39:58] putting us in the in as the family of
[40:00] God right A lot of people want to still
[40:03] have something to do what can I work
[40:06] uh the Rich Young Ruler did that uh all
[40:10] of the law they did that and these and
[40:12] these have the same mentality this group
[40:15] that's following him they see these
[40:17] Miracles and they see all this going on
[40:19] and of course Jesus said labor not for
[40:22] the meat but I want you to see what
[40:25] labor Jesus is talking about what does
[40:29] he mean when he's talking about labor
[40:31] now look
[40:34] Jesus they said what uh what shall we do
[40:38] that we might work the works of God
[40:42] they're trying to prove themselves good
[40:45] enough to be a part of the family of God
[40:48] Jesus answered and said and we all know
[40:50] there's nothing any of us can do
[40:53] amen we can't there's none of us any of
[40:55] us can ever do anything good enough to
[40:57] be a child of God none of us amen the
[41:00] only way that you can be is you're a
[41:02] part of the family of God by a new birth
[41:04] and the Holy Spirit by the bloody shed
[41:06] in Calvary that's only he did it not us
[41:10] but Jesus answers that unto them this is
[41:14] the work now what is the work that God
[41:16] gives them to do they think about
[41:18] sweeping the floor cooking a meal
[41:21] feeding the hungry going to the orphans
[41:23] the widows doing all these works well
[41:26] they're probably thinking what work can
[41:28] I do
[41:29] he said this is the work of God that you
[41:32] believe
[41:34] amen that's the word he just took all
[41:37] the all of the things that they could
[41:40] try to attain to to say look what I did
[41:43] look what I accomplished look what who I
[41:47] am look what I have worked with my hands
[41:49] look what I have got Jesus took all that
[41:52] away from him and said the work that you
[41:54] can do is believe
[41:57] believe that's the work amen believe on
[42:00] him whom he has sent that's the work so
[42:04] what does it do again it takes all the
[42:07] bragging away it takes all the
[42:09] pretension away it takes all that you
[42:11] are good enough to make it out all that
[42:14] is gone all you have to do to work the
[42:16] work of God is to believe
[42:19] on him whom he sent amen
[42:22] believe him in the context of which this
[42:25] is written you receive Christ unto
[42:27] yourself and to receive him is to love
[42:29] him to love him is to obey him amen it's
[42:32] that simple but obedience now this is
[42:35] another thing I don't want to go off on
[42:36] a tangent here because I got something
[42:38] I'm working on but actually obedience is
[42:41] a work of the law
[42:43] you understand you know that yeah and
[42:45] when you when you obey the speed limit
[42:47] out here you're obeying the law it's a
[42:50] work of the law
[42:52] we don't actually uh this may sound
[42:55] tough but
[42:57] we don't actually
[43:01] live the way we live out of obedience
[43:04] we live the way we live because we love
[43:07] it
[43:08] it's not obedience it's a love it's a
[43:12] love affair that we have with God
[43:13] obedience is going back to the law
[43:16] obedience is something that you obey
[43:18] we're not obeying
[43:21] we end up living the way we do but we
[43:24] don't do it out of obedience we do it
[43:26] because we love it
[43:27] amen praise the Lord
[43:30] and love brings us into obedience amen
[43:35] not a law not a law
[43:37] now they said therefore unto him what
[43:41] signs show us thou then that we may see
[43:44] and believe thee now they're looking for
[43:46] a sign now Jesus already told them a
[43:49] wicked and adults in this generation
[43:51] seeketh after signs we know he's already
[43:54] told him that but yet they are looking
[43:57] for a sign from him
[43:58] first they want to do a work what can we
[44:01] do that we can be good enough to be in
[44:03] heaven now they're asking Jesus you want
[44:06] us to believe you so look what the
[44:09] context says
[44:11] what signs show us then
[44:13] that we may see and believe thee
[44:18] there's no faith to that or very little
[44:21] faith amen it still has it still takes
[44:24] Faith to believe what you see but it
[44:27] doesn't take it takes very little faith
[44:29] to believe what you can see or touch or
[44:32] hear if it takes very little faith but
[44:35] it takes all the faith to believe
[44:37] something you can't see or someone you
[44:39] can't touch or someone you can't hear
[44:42] audibly amen that's what faith is but
[44:45] what they're wanting is to get something
[44:47] they can see to believe well that is Con
[44:50] that is absolutely contrary to what
[44:52] Jesus just said
[44:54] Jesus said that the work of God is to
[44:56] believe on him whom he has sent
[44:59] not a sign
[45:01] not a work
[45:03] but believe
[45:04] have faith amen that's the foundation of
[45:08] our Christian Life is faith
[45:10] Faith but they want to see something
[45:12] what may we see
[45:14] and believe thee and and uh what does
[45:19] thou work again they're looking for
[45:22] these Works they're looking for signs
[45:24] they're looking for signals they're
[45:25] looking for something that's out that's
[45:28] contained in the five senses of our
[45:30] human realm or even the five senses are
[45:33] our spirit Realm they're looking for
[45:35] something tangible and God says and
[45:38] Jesus is telling them you just if you
[45:40] believe me you're just believing
[45:43] amen some call it Blind Faith and they
[45:46] can call it that that's fine I don't
[45:48] have a problem with that why amen but
[45:51] the truth is you believe Jesus Christ
[45:52] you believe God Almighty because you
[45:55] know him and the power of his
[45:56] resurrection and who he is to you not
[45:59] because you could see him touching feel
[46:01] and hear him audibly but you know he's
[46:03] there
[46:04] because of that sixth sense that's
[46:06] inside of you yes it's a sense that that
[46:10] that transcends the five senses the
[46:13] sense of faith that we believe and know
[46:14] that he's there it goes beyond see
[46:16] tasteful smell here it goes beyond
[46:19] imagination cause infection reason
[46:20] memory it goes into the realm of the
[46:23] soul that believes God regardless of
[46:26] whether you can see him or touch him or
[46:28] feeling but that's all that they're
[46:30] looking for we want to touch we want to
[46:31] feel we want to hear we want to see we
[46:34] want something tangible we want somehow
[46:37] that we can believe well if they haven't
[46:39] believed by now and remember this is the
[46:42] group that's been following Jesus this
[46:45] is the group that saw him take the few
[46:49] loaves of fishes and feed the multitudes
[46:52] this is the group that that they didn't
[46:55] see him but knows that Jesus got from
[46:59] one place to the other without getting
[47:01] on a boat
[47:03] he walked across the water yes he walked
[47:06] across the sea he found him in the boat
[47:08] he got in the boat immediately the Bible
[47:10] says immediately they were at the shore
[47:11] where they were going
[47:13] now this is the same group but they're
[47:15] asking now work a work
[47:17] well what have I not done or what what
[47:21] do I need to do to get you to understand
[47:23] but see they weren't Believers to begin
[47:25] with that's why the work he gave them
[47:28] the meat that he gave them was to
[47:31] believe
[47:32] believe on him whom he has sent
[47:36] they said now 31st verse Our Father did
[47:39] eat Manna in the desert as it is written
[47:42] he gave them bread from Heaven to eat
[47:45] amen our fathers now look at this
[47:49] then Jesus said unto them
[47:52] barely verily I say unto you Moses gave
[47:56] you not that bread from heaven but my
[48:00] father giveth you the true bread from
[48:03] Heaven what is that that's not just a
[48:06] little wafer that came down and that
[48:08] they got as they were going through the
[48:10] wilderness
[48:11] amen that wasn't just a little uh
[48:13] showbread or something that came onto
[48:15] the ground that they that they could go
[48:17] out and gather and keep this true bread
[48:19] is standing right in front of him
[48:21] amen because he was the bread of life
[48:23] amen but my father giveth you the true
[48:26] bread from heaven
[48:28] for the bread of God is that which
[48:30] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[48:33] unto the world
[48:35] which was signified in the bread that he
[48:38] gave them in the wilderness that's
[48:40] exactly what the bread of the Wilder
[48:42] understand God reigned that bread down
[48:44] from heaven and gave it that they could
[48:46] go gather it that they could sustain
[48:48] life
[48:49] it was what they had and God blessed
[48:52] with that in a miraculous way and that
[48:55] even got common to them
[48:57] that even got to the place that they
[48:59] didn't want it anymore
[49:01] they they started calling it this light
[49:04] bread they wanted a different diet they
[49:06] wanted something new something different
[49:08] oh my that sounds like a lot of people
[49:11] today not satisfied with the pure gospel
[49:14] with the word of God the message the
[49:17] truth has come to us an hour they want
[49:19] something different they want something
[49:21] new and there's always a little friend
[49:22] there's always going to be those
[49:24] teachers out there with itching ears
[49:25] it's going to try to bring something
[49:27] else that's new different Innovative uh
[49:31] never saw this scripture before never
[49:33] heard this quote before and always try
[49:35] to swing it around to bring something
[49:37] new and different friend but the truth
[49:39] is the work that you work is to believe
[49:42] on him
[49:43] to believe on him is to receive him and
[49:46] to live his life
[49:47] praise the Lord that's that's the best
[49:49] we can do
[49:50] [Music]
[49:52] for the prayer of God
[49:55] is he which come down from heaven giveth
[49:57] life in the world and they said and said
[49:58] they unto him Lord Evermore give us this
[50:02] bread
[50:03] and Jesus said unto them I am
[50:06] the bread of life
[50:08] you're looking at it I'm here what else
[50:12] can I do to convince you amen he that
[50:16] cometh to me shall never hunger he that
[50:18] believeth on me shall never thirst
[50:20] but I said unto you that ye all that ye
[50:23] also have seen me and believe not and
[50:27] that's exactly where they stood as
[50:29] unbelievers
[50:30] but Jesus being the bread of life was
[50:33] simply just a manifestation a completion
[50:37] a showing forth of what God continually
[50:41] through the scripture not excluding the
[50:43] showbread uh they showed to them and and
[50:47] manifested to them
[50:49] the foreshadow
[50:53] another foreshadow if you will a
[50:56] Pentecost is in the book of Exodus
[51:00] uh so I'm going to go to Exodus chapter
[51:03] 29.
[51:11] Exodus chapter 29.
[51:14] read the or read the beginning of the
[51:16] first verse
[51:18] but Exodus chapter 9. so Jesus being
[51:22] foreshadowed as the bread of life was
[51:24] nothing new we could see it in the
[51:26] scripture the foreshadowing of Pentecost
[51:28] was not new we saw it in scripture we
[51:31] see it again here we talked about uh of
[51:34] course God slang the Lambs we've talked
[51:36] about the Paschal Lamb uh now I want to
[51:39] talk about the hollowing of the ministry
[51:41] and then the Halloween of the ministry
[51:44] in Exodus chapter 29 this is where Jesus
[51:48] talks about again remember
[51:50] Jesus was the Fulfillment of every one
[51:54] of these scriptural promises yes Jesus
[51:58] was the Fulfillment of every
[52:00] qualification that the Bible gave about
[52:03] who was to come and to give life unto
[52:06] the world that's how Jesus was able to
[52:09] identify himself with with that or to
[52:13] that group he wasn't identified with
[52:15] them but identify himself to that who
[52:19] was because he was the Fulfillment of
[52:22] every single scripture that was wrote
[52:25] about him in the Old Testament the
[52:27] foreshadowing of Jesus Christ
[52:30] Exodus chapter 29. let's look at this
[52:34] first verse and this is the thing now
[52:37] look at God's uh talking to Moses Moses
[52:41] given to the children now this is the
[52:43] thing that thou shalt do unto them to
[52:47] howl them to minister unto me in the
[52:51] priest's office
[52:53] so this
[52:54] this process that God set forth was a
[52:59] qualification it was a uh indoctrination
[53:03] or or a Halloween to to bring a position
[53:07] that was hallowed before God and before
[53:11] the people that was acceptable by God
[53:15] now all these things God said in motion
[53:18] God said in place you can read all these
[53:21] things and think well why does this
[53:23] matter and why did he have to do this
[53:25] and why do they have to go there why did
[53:27] it have to be like this because God's
[53:30] the one that said it forth that way it
[53:32] was God's decision to say this is
[53:36] satisfactory for me to come into my
[53:39] presence again this is satisfactory for
[53:43] me for the ministry to minister to be to
[53:47] be hallowed if you will in the position
[53:50] of ministering instead of
[53:54] or in in the place of God
[53:58] that was the position that they were to
[54:00] take see look
[54:03] do what to to hollow them to minister
[54:07] unto me in the priest's office
[54:11] amen
[54:12] simply a foreshadow
[54:15] simply a uh an understanding of what God
[54:18] was doing with them to bring it forth
[54:21] so Jesus Christ became that in that
[54:25] position that fulfillment of that
[54:27] position look at this so let's continue
[54:29] to read now this is going to hollow them
[54:34] what does that just simply means it's
[54:36] going to make it acceptable before God
[54:40] for them to minister unto him in that
[54:44] office
[54:45] amen and Minister unto him by
[54:47] ministering unto his people
[54:49] look now
[54:50] take one young Bullock and two Rams
[54:54] without glitting so we talk about the we
[54:56] talked about the Lambs of the Paschal
[54:58] Lamb and being held up and without
[54:59] blemish and the Perfection of it but now
[55:02] let's get to the bread
[55:04] the howling of the ministry now remember
[55:07] we know Jesus Christ is the high priest
[55:09] right amen amen
[55:12] this is a howling of the priests in this
[55:15] office in this position
[55:17] I believe that's why brother Branham
[55:19] said that uh a minister should never get
[55:22] behind the pulpit without his first met
[55:24] the pillar of fire amen before he's been
[55:27] filled with the Holy Ghost is what he
[55:29] means the Holy Ghost preacher now look
[55:32] uh we got the Bullocks Rams he said now
[55:35] an unleavened bread unleavened bread of
[55:39] course we know the unleavened is the
[55:40] Purity the Holiness unleavened not
[55:43] leavened with anything else anything of
[55:46] the world
[55:48] unleavened bread and cakes unleavened
[55:52] tempered with oil and Wafers unleavened
[55:56] Anointed with oil of Wheat and flour
[55:59] shall thou make them and thou shalt put
[56:02] them into one basket amen one basket
[56:07] and bring them in the basket with the
[56:10] block and the two Rams and Aaron and his
[56:12] sons and Aaron and his sons Thou shalt
[56:15] bring into the door of the Tabernacle of
[56:17] the congregation and shall wash them
[56:20] with water amen wash them with water now
[56:23] let's look at this the as Jesus the
[56:26] bread of life again and the
[56:28] representation of Pentecost here in
[56:32] Exodus look at this for a moment we read
[56:34] about we read Acts chapter 2 last week
[56:37] uh we might actually get to Acts chapter
[56:40] 2 again but Acts chapter 2 uh we talked
[56:44] about this last week but now look at
[56:45] this the unleavened bread
[56:48] cakes that are unleavened and look at
[56:51] these cakes that are unleavened the cake
[56:54] not doesn't say here but the the
[56:57] Performing of this cake that was to be
[56:59] brought forth was to be pierced and and
[57:03] or perforated
[57:04] so this cake was supposed to be uh uh
[57:08] both supposed to be pierced perforated
[57:12] or have scars put in it it was supposed
[57:15] to be scarred and it was supposed to be
[57:17] pierced this cake now this cake is
[57:21] supposed to be uh uh uh represent a new
[57:27] birth
[57:28] amen the unleaveness of the bread the
[57:31] unmixing of the world piers
[57:34] brings new birth as Jesus Christ was
[57:37] pierced at Calvary amen now this
[57:40] unlevious Pierce this cake was to be
[57:43] unleavened and tempered with oil
[57:46] well The Temper well we know what the
[57:48] oil means correct the whole oil means
[57:50] the Holy Spirit it all represents the
[57:52] Holy Ghost this cakes were supposed to
[57:55] be tempered with oil and the tempering
[57:58] process is to take and knead it and
[58:01] mingle it and take the oil and the and
[58:04] the cake to where the two become one
[58:08] that's this process
[58:10] this process of this pierced cake is to
[58:13] take and make the oil and the and the
[58:15] and the cake one
[58:18] the flesh the cake one
[58:21] it was to be tempered together needed
[58:24] together so that you can no longer
[58:27] separate the the the dough the cake from
[58:30] the oil
[58:32] they become one together they come they
[58:34] become synonymous together one as in the
[58:38] Holy Spirit filling them in in uh in
[58:42] this cake which represents of course the
[58:45] new bird yes the indwelling presence of
[58:48] Jesus Christ is what represents the new
[58:51] birth
[58:52] and the new birth is that indwelling
[58:54] presence of Jesus Christ in you Amen in
[58:58] the form of the holy spirit that Holy
[59:01] Spirit coming and making you a new
[59:04] person by it tempering itself in you
[59:07] amen not just a part of your life but
[59:11] becoming your life he is our life not
[59:15] just a part of our lives I've had so
[59:18] many times that people come and say I
[59:20] want Jesus as a part of my life I said
[59:22] go back you're not ready yet amen until
[59:25] you're ready for Jesus Christ to become
[59:28] your life you are not ready yet amen
[59:31] amen I remember a story I think brother
[59:34] random was telling him was going down in
[59:36] a in a baptism line
[59:39] and some lady she cried out or called
[59:41] out to Brother Bear and said hey you're
[59:43] going down the dunkus and she said get
[59:45] out of this line you're not fit to be
[59:47] baptized
[59:49] amen until you're ready until you're
[59:52] sold out to you're dead to yourself
[59:54] and ready for Jesus Christ to take
[59:57] complete control of your life not just a
[1:00:00] part you're not ready that's what the
[1:00:03] tempering is
[1:00:04] that's what the mixing the mingling the
[1:00:07] the coming together as one means yes to
[1:00:11] the point again to the point that you
[1:00:14] could no longer separate the oil from
[1:00:17] the cake they became one
[1:00:19] praise the Lord
[1:00:21] amen now together that represents of
[1:00:24] course that new birth of the cape
[1:00:26] piercing the mingling of the oil that's
[1:00:28] the new birth that's the indwelling
[1:00:31] presence of God
[1:00:33] now and the way first now they got
[1:00:36] Wafers so we got the the cakes
[1:00:38] unleavened tempered with oil and Wafers
[1:00:40] unleavened Anointed with oil now he went
[1:00:44] over the anointing part of it we know
[1:00:46] the oil again we went over the anointing
[1:00:48] part we know what the anointing is
[1:00:50] if you go back and you look in the
[1:00:52] Hebrew it'll tell you exactly the
[1:00:55] definition of this word I chose not to
[1:00:57] pull it out because it's pretty easy to
[1:00:59] describe when we kind of went over that
[1:01:01] the other day uh but we know what that
[1:01:04] anointing is what is that anointing
[1:01:07] the anointing if you go back and you
[1:01:10] look actually in the Hebrew definition
[1:01:11] of this word it means to pour on or
[1:01:15] smear on
[1:01:16] amen that's what the anointing means is
[1:01:19] for that oil to be on
[1:01:22] the way for uh the the best I felt that
[1:01:27] I got was the wafer just means the flesh
[1:01:30] the Flesh of the human is the wafer it's
[1:01:33] the thin wafer small crusty just like
[1:01:36] our smoke just our crusty itself is a
[1:01:40] way for a small crusty uh outside flesh
[1:01:44] we're all kind of sticky and crusty
[1:01:46] aren't we uh that flesh and that
[1:01:49] anointing oil was to come and baptize or
[1:01:53] smear on or anoint
[1:01:56] amen now you see where brother Brown
[1:01:58] talked about the false anointed ones or
[1:02:01] anointed ones at the end time the
[1:02:04] anointing that comes on it the anointing
[1:02:08] that came on these Wafers was something
[1:02:10] that was smear uh merely smeared on it
[1:02:14] was baptized with it it was on the
[1:02:17] outside of the wafer there was nothing
[1:02:19] about this process that caused the oil
[1:02:22] the Holy Spirit to come into this wafer
[1:02:26] it was simply an anointing or a smearing
[1:02:30] on this wafer that's all it was now you
[1:02:33] see in grand scheme what God did here he
[1:02:37] did on the day of Pentecost and
[1:02:39] when the Holy Spirit came and it came
[1:02:41] down upon them and in them
[1:02:44] the exact same thing of the
[1:02:45] representation of Jesus Christ here as
[1:02:48] he housed them look
[1:02:51] you're thinking a a howling of a
[1:02:55] Ministry to the office of priests
[1:02:59] to minister to God in that priest office
[1:03:03] what has Wafers and cakes Got to Do with
[1:03:05] It
[1:03:07] yeah
[1:03:09] it's like we talked a few weeks ago what
[1:03:11] sense does that make
[1:03:13] there's still common sense to that what
[1:03:15] would what would a wafer cakes and what
[1:03:18] has that got to do with howling a
[1:03:20] minister to the priest's office but in
[1:03:22] God's eyes it was nothing but a
[1:03:25] representation of what he had in his
[1:03:27] mind was already doing bringing to pass
[1:03:30] Jesus Christ Pentecost our lives today
[1:03:34] on into
[1:03:36] even into the
[1:03:37] into this friend yes even into this
[1:03:40] message that we live and hold dear even
[1:03:42] and from the message even into this day
[1:03:44] and we live to a rapture
[1:03:47] amen God foretelling God foreshowing
[1:03:50] he's got cakes that are mingled or mixed
[1:03:53] mingled and he's got Wafers that that is
[1:03:56] Anointed with the oil it's simply
[1:03:58] anointed look here let's go to Hebrews
[1:04:02] Hebrews chapter uh four
[1:04:09] they were hallowed in the priest's
[1:04:11] office
[1:04:12] to minister to God and of course then
[1:04:15] at the end they stood there from the
[1:04:17] whole congregation
[1:04:19] and they were washed with water they
[1:04:22] stood there and the door of the
[1:04:24] congregation and they had this water
[1:04:26] poured over them now
[1:04:28] if that's where Catholics get their holy
[1:04:31] water from I have no idea uh
[1:04:34] I don't know any there's no scripture
[1:04:37] about holy water so the only thing I can
[1:04:40] think of they got it from maybe is this
[1:04:42] even though they take this and it's
[1:04:45] supposed to be holy to sprinkle on
[1:04:47] people I don't really actually know how
[1:04:49] that process goes so uh don't ask me but
[1:04:53] I know about the holy water anyway but
[1:04:55] they were they were to stand in the door
[1:04:57] and have water poured over them well
[1:05:00] that wasn't some holy water you're
[1:05:01] taking a Shaker and put on everybody
[1:05:03] that was simply the word of God
[1:05:06] amen the Waters of Separation The Water
[1:05:09] of Life amen the water that was poured
[1:05:12] over them was just it was just a
[1:05:14] representation of their Ministry of
[1:05:17] taking the word of God which of course
[1:05:19] they had and and of course is a
[1:05:22] foreshadowing of what we have today is
[1:05:25] simply nothing more than just standing
[1:05:27] under the spigot and letting you get
[1:05:28] good and soaked
[1:05:30] amen of the washing of the Water by the
[1:05:33] word
[1:05:34] we got washed in the Water by the word
[1:05:36] it's the same representation the
[1:05:38] ministry today amen you find out and you
[1:05:41] look around the world today you look
[1:05:43] around you look around the state even
[1:05:46] the city I don't put anybody else
[1:05:48] friends but it just becomes clear to me
[1:05:50] that
[1:05:51] um
[1:05:52] a lot of times people aren't as
[1:05:54] interested in hearing the preaching of
[1:05:56] the pure unadulterated word as they are
[1:05:58] a nice social group
[1:06:01] I'm not in this for social group and I'm
[1:06:04] in this to be popular I'm not in this to
[1:06:06] gain some great notoriety or some great
[1:06:08] Fortune I'm in this because of the
[1:06:11] calling of God in my life and the
[1:06:13] washing of the water of the word to
[1:06:15] preach the gospel I Got No Frills to
[1:06:18] give you right yeah I've got no great
[1:06:20] programs or nothing to send you to I'm
[1:06:23] glad my daughter started the Sunday
[1:06:24] school that was all her I didn't ask for
[1:06:26] it I didn't start it she didn't ask me
[1:06:28] she just felt to do it and bless her for
[1:06:30] doing it that's wonderful amen I'm glad
[1:06:32] she did it anything like that uh no Pro
[1:06:36] but that's I come because of the washing
[1:06:39] of the word amen hey man that's the
[1:06:42] responsibility God give me is the
[1:06:44] passion of this church is not to make
[1:06:46] sure that you play good volleyball but
[1:06:48] that you know the word of God and the
[1:06:50] word of God comes and the Holy Spirit is
[1:06:52] in you and you live this life out in
[1:06:54] this world so when it comes time you're
[1:06:57] ready to go home to be with him am I
[1:06:59] that's my only concern
[1:07:01] amen I don't care if you can hit a ball
[1:07:04] I don't care if you can put a ball I
[1:07:06] don't care if you can shoot a ball I
[1:07:08] don't care if you could hit a ball I all
[1:07:10] I care is if you're bored again
[1:07:13] amen do you have the Holy Spirit
[1:07:17] is God Jesus Christ Son of God living in
[1:07:21] you amen amen that's my main concern
[1:07:24] washing of the Water by the word
[1:07:26] praise the Lord washing of the Water by
[1:07:29] the word there's nothing wrong with the
[1:07:30] social programs nothing wrong with
[1:07:32] hitting a ball there's nothing wrong
[1:07:35] with any of that thing amen but that's
[1:07:37] not what God sent me to do
[1:07:39] amen that's not what that's not why God
[1:07:42] hollowed them in the priest's office
[1:07:44] God didn't hallowed them in the priest
[1:07:46] office and washed them with the water
[1:07:48] and they stepped out and said hey let's
[1:07:49] start a nice volleyball game now
[1:07:51] nothing wrong with the volleyball game
[1:07:53] friend not at all but but that's not the
[1:07:57] point here right amen the point is to
[1:08:00] make sure who you are
[1:08:02] You Know Who You Are amen because
[1:08:05] there's a very serious thing taking
[1:08:07] place of a separation of God's people
[1:08:10] from this world because he's about to
[1:08:12] take her home yes he's about to take his
[1:08:15] bride home amen amen and I and I plan to
[1:08:20] be a part of that and I want you all to
[1:08:22] be a part of that
[1:08:24] amen
[1:08:25] I want everybody to be a part of that
[1:08:27] you know not just you praise the Lord I
[1:08:30] want everybody to be a part of that now
[1:08:32] Hebrews explains very
[1:08:35] very well to us Hebrews chapter 4.
[1:08:38] verse 13.
[1:08:44] verse 13 neither is there any creature
[1:08:47] that is not manifest in his sight but
[1:08:49] all things are naked and open unto the
[1:08:51] eyes of him with whom we have to do
[1:08:55] seeing then that we have a great high
[1:08:57] priest praise the Lord
[1:08:59] amen foreshadowing now we have a great
[1:09:03] high priest that has passed into the
[1:09:05] heavens
[1:09:06] Jesus the son of God let us hold fast
[1:09:10] our profession
[1:09:12] for we have not a high priest which
[1:09:16] cannot be touched with a feeling of our
[1:09:18] infirmities there's the double negative
[1:09:20] uh it just simply means he is a high
[1:09:23] priest that can be touched by the
[1:09:25] feeling of our infirmities
[1:09:27] but was in all points tempted like as we
[1:09:30] are and we know there's no one like that
[1:09:32] that fulfills that but Jesus Christ
[1:09:35] nobody else fills that scripture but
[1:09:38] Jesus Christ above all temptation
[1:09:40] uh uh and all points tempted like as we
[1:09:43] are
[1:09:44] yet without sin Let Us therefore come
[1:09:48] boldly unto the throne of grace that we
[1:09:51] may obtain mercy and find Grace to help
[1:09:53] in the time of need now what was he what
[1:09:57] is he our high priest he is our great
[1:10:00] high priest that is simply the
[1:10:03] Perfection and fulfillment of what we
[1:10:07] just read in Exodus amen the high priest
[1:10:11] they were hallowed to be accepted
[1:10:14] accepted by God to minister to him in
[1:10:19] that office that was simply the
[1:10:21] exception God accepted that but Jesus
[1:10:24] Christ came and the Perfection of the
[1:10:27] Fulfillment of that now every Minister
[1:10:30] who Saints every man that tries to stand
[1:10:34] behind this pulpit
[1:10:36] must be born again of the Holy Spirit or
[1:10:39] they are not qualified to touch that
[1:10:42] gospel
[1:10:43] that was the requirement in the Old
[1:10:45] Testament it is requirement today yeah
[1:10:48] because Jesus Christ our high priest is
[1:10:52] here now and lives in US
[1:10:55] and the only way anybody could ever
[1:10:58] qualify in that position you have to be
[1:11:00] called of course but you must be born
[1:11:03] again amen amen if a man stands behind
[1:11:06] it is not born again
[1:11:09] well God have mercy I don't know what to
[1:11:11] say about that amen
[1:11:13] but that's a that that's a person that
[1:11:15] can be taken astray that's a person that
[1:11:18] can be moved inside anybody without the
[1:11:19] Holy Ghost can be taken astray anybody
[1:11:22] without the Holy Ghost could be moved
[1:11:24] decided deceived and and brought to ruin
[1:11:27] anybody without the Holy Spirit
[1:11:29] not the Holy Spirit on you
[1:11:34] amen not just anointed
[1:11:37] of some gift now there's plentiful of
[1:11:40] gifts Saints and we're going to talk
[1:11:41] about that next week I knew I wouldn't
[1:11:43] have time to do it today I'll probably
[1:11:46] dabble in in just a few moments if
[1:11:48] you're okay with that uh but
[1:11:51] but those but it's not that anointing
[1:11:54] that anoint to give see
[1:11:56] there can be there can be a gift there
[1:11:59] or a colleague there but no repentance
[1:12:02] uh there there could be a gift there uh
[1:12:05] the Bible even talks about uh Timothy
[1:12:09] and his Grandma Lois
[1:12:11] we know women are to be ministers
[1:12:15] to have a gift you see people today I
[1:12:18] I've seen now I I don't make it a habit
[1:12:21] but I have seen
[1:12:23] briefly uh a female Minister and mine
[1:12:28] she just
[1:12:30] an orchard just lay it right out and and
[1:12:34] just be as good a preacher as as anybody
[1:12:37] we're going to order towards anybody but
[1:12:41] she's forbidden by the gospel to do it
[1:12:43] yeah
[1:12:44] yeah so what does that make her where
[1:12:46] does that put her yeah
[1:12:48] yeah amen there may be something that
[1:12:51] was just that was just
[1:12:53] crawling on her
[1:12:55] to want to be a minister
[1:12:57] but it's against the word
[1:13:00] that anointing would come down and that
[1:13:03] anointing could come on anybody that's
[1:13:05] standing behind any Pulpit of any
[1:13:07] religion this morning
[1:13:09] the Buddhists the Hindus the the the the
[1:13:12] the the the the gospels the the the
[1:13:15] sataness that anointing could follow any
[1:13:18] of them at any time and speak and talk I
[1:13:22] mean
[1:13:23] look look at the the uh politicians
[1:13:27] today oh some of them up there you they
[1:13:29] just speak and talk and you see the
[1:13:32] televangelists you see people that
[1:13:34] Garner the control over people
[1:13:37] uh I don't know how much it is today I
[1:13:40] don't follow it like it used to but
[1:13:42] back in the day I mean there was the
[1:13:44] Kenneth Copeland's and and uh I probably
[1:13:47] shouldn't call names but several
[1:13:49] Ministries that just got the control
[1:13:51] over the people
[1:13:52] amen that's just an anointing friend
[1:13:55] amen because there there should be there
[1:13:58] should never be in the place where a
[1:14:03] minister a pastor has that kind of
[1:14:05] control over a person yes that's not
[1:14:08] that is not our position our place yeah
[1:14:10] yeah amen you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:14:13] live your life you are before God
[1:14:16] responsible for yourself and your own
[1:14:18] not me
[1:14:20] I'm responsible to this
[1:14:22] amen I'm responsible for this and of
[1:14:25] course my own but I'm responsible to
[1:14:27] this
[1:14:28] not not other lives but you see that you
[1:14:32] used to see it I
[1:14:34] Jim Baker he's passed I think
[1:14:38] um maybe not I think Tammy did anyway it
[1:14:41] had control such control over people
[1:14:43] yeah that I remember I lived in
[1:14:45] Charlotte when I was there and that's
[1:14:47] their Ministry was right there and uh I
[1:14:51] I remember one time where
[1:14:54] she
[1:14:55] I mean she was as caked up as any
[1:14:58] Jezebel you'd ever want to see friend on
[1:15:00] this on the platform
[1:15:02] calling out and said I can just see ten
[1:15:04] dollar bills raining down and and people
[1:15:07] hundreds of people on the balcony just
[1:15:09] started throwing money off the balcony
[1:15:13] such control over people yes that's that
[1:15:17] is that is not godly yeah
[1:15:20] yeah but it's an anointing that falls
[1:15:22] these people are these people are
[1:15:25] genuine in heart they truly have them
[1:15:28] feel that anointing falling and and
[1:15:32] Garner control over these people and and
[1:15:34] to act that way and to and to do those
[1:15:37] things and there's no tell us people may
[1:15:40] not have had another dollar in their
[1:15:41] pocket
[1:15:43] amen but that but just Garner that
[1:15:46] control take control over people and be
[1:15:49] influenced have that influence over
[1:15:51] people amen and and that it and it's
[1:15:55] just as prevalent today
[1:15:57] you see it today that was probably 40
[1:16:00] years ago but you can see that exact
[1:16:02] same spirit is still out there yes
[1:16:04] because it's that same anointing
[1:16:07] um
[1:16:08] my focus of course God gives us the word
[1:16:11] amen the word that God helps us with yes
[1:16:16] amen now let me let me draw this I don't
[1:16:18] like bringing this over but while we're
[1:16:20] doing our song service but
[1:16:22] um some may have may not may may not
[1:16:25] have seen as I've drawed this before but
[1:16:29] um
[1:16:30] we all know that we are
[1:16:33] we are a Triumph being
[1:16:36] I know you've all probably most of
[1:16:38] you've probably seen me draw before we
[1:16:40] are a body
[1:16:43] and spirit
[1:16:45] human spirit
[1:16:49] and so on
[1:16:52] amen
[1:16:55] where Body Spirit and soul
[1:16:57] so when we're talking about
[1:16:59] the the anointing we're simply talking
[1:17:04] about the spirit of God that falls on
[1:17:07] this outside part of the man let's let's
[1:17:09] look at let's just look at acts again
[1:17:12] you can turn there if you want I'm just
[1:17:13] going to read it acts 2 1. when the day
[1:17:16] of Pentecost was fully come we talked
[1:17:19] about that last week they were all with
[1:17:20] one Accord in one place
[1:17:23] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[1:17:25] as of a rushing wind rushing Mighty Wind
[1:17:29] filled all the house where they were
[1:17:30] sitting they appeared unto them cloven
[1:17:33] tongues as we said that cloven is broke
[1:17:35] out like as a fire and sat upon each of
[1:17:39] them each of them that were set in there
[1:17:41] the spirit of God that came this oil
[1:17:44] this spirit this fire came and lit upon
[1:17:49] each one of them well when you put
[1:17:52] something upon something it's simply on
[1:17:55] the outside or exterior of such thing
[1:17:57] amen just as it was on their bodies they
[1:18:01] felt the anointing of that Spirit on
[1:18:04] their bodies on their flesh the same
[1:18:07] thing that people feel today
[1:18:09] people around the world people of all uh
[1:18:12] uh kindred's tongue Nation people of
[1:18:14] every religion every Creed color every
[1:18:17] uh anyone is is acceptable to this
[1:18:21] anointing that falls because it's a
[1:18:24] blanket that was upon the Earth remember
[1:18:25] and in Acts
[1:18:28] um that's gonna read this later but
[1:18:31] um let's see if I can find it here
[1:18:34] if I wrote it down
[1:18:37] um
[1:18:38] Acts chapter
[1:18:39] 2 still verse 17. and as Peter was
[1:18:43] explaining this to the people
[1:18:45] this this spirit that came down and sat
[1:18:49] upon each of them and were filled
[1:18:53] Peter said this about it and it shall
[1:18:56] come to pass in the last days quoting
[1:18:59] Joel saith God I will pour out of my
[1:19:03] spirit that's the Holy Spirit the
[1:19:06] anointing the fire the oil I will pour
[1:19:10] out of my spirit upon
[1:19:14] All Flesh not just a believer
[1:19:19] not just a uh uh a message person
[1:19:24] but all flesh
[1:19:27] not soul
[1:19:29] but all flesh
[1:19:31] that Spirit fall on all places so when
[1:19:34] you hear about that spirit and I'm
[1:19:38] saying would be on anybody that without
[1:19:40] whatever religion or whatever it's all
[1:19:43] flesh the spirit would follow All Flesh
[1:19:46] amen
[1:19:48] and he has fallen on All Flesh thus we
[1:19:51] have the anointed ones at the end times
[1:19:54] the Lord willing we'll talk about next
[1:19:56] week
[1:19:57] it is lit upon All Flesh so when it says
[1:20:01] it came and sat upon each of them all it
[1:20:04] simply did was baptize them
[1:20:08] all it did was anoint them
[1:20:12] but the spirit then
[1:20:15] came into them
[1:20:18] and and they were all filled with the
[1:20:22] Holy Ghost and when they were all filled
[1:20:24] with the Holy Ghost amen when that
[1:20:27] Spirit came on them and in them they
[1:20:29] began to speak with other tones and the
[1:20:30] spirit gave the murderers right but now
[1:20:33] if Gibson callings over without
[1:20:34] repentance that simply means that that
[1:20:37] anointing on that flesh
[1:20:39] could anoint that guilt even though it
[1:20:42] may not even be scriptural
[1:20:45] amen even though it may not even be
[1:20:48] according to the word that's why brother
[1:20:50] random said when he had so many people
[1:20:52] that were copying his ministry and so
[1:20:55] many people that were making up uh the
[1:20:58] things that they were trying to do with
[1:21:00] him and and you'd see the people and
[1:21:02] I've seen them I I've seen even recently
[1:21:05] where people have prayer lines and and
[1:21:08] all of a sudden you see somebody that
[1:21:09] starts staggering around you know like
[1:21:11] brother better did on the video
[1:21:13] another oh my
[1:21:15] I just
[1:21:17] I just it just
[1:21:20] uh Lord help me
[1:21:22] I I don't want to be overly critical
[1:21:24] friend but it's that impersonation right
[1:21:27] that's what brother random fought he
[1:21:29] said how can you tell how do you know
[1:21:31] amen you hear something like that it's
[1:21:33] true or not he said because of the word
[1:21:37] amen do they preach the word are they on
[1:21:40] the word then you could know because
[1:21:43] it's not just on them it's in them
[1:21:45] a true Spirit the true spirit of God
[1:21:48] Amen that's falling on All Flesh today
[1:21:52] a lot of people
[1:21:53] extremely misunderstood of this this
[1:21:57] passage of scripture right of this
[1:22:00] understanding of the Holy Spirit
[1:22:02] they think the Holy Spirit when brother
[1:22:04] Madam says um
[1:22:07] when brother Brown says uh about the
[1:22:09] dove taking its flight if y'all listen
[1:22:12] to the message and the places where
[1:22:14] brother Adam said and that Dove would
[1:22:16] take its flight you do something wrong
[1:22:17] or whatever it is something displeasing
[1:22:19] and that dove will take it swipe and
[1:22:21] it'll sit on that limb
[1:22:23] I mean people actually preach or have
[1:22:26] the understanding that you have your
[1:22:28] salvation and then you lose it and then
[1:22:30] you have it and then you lose it you do
[1:22:32] something wrong you lose it well that's
[1:22:34] exactly what armenianism is yeah I
[1:22:36] believe it's armenianism
[1:22:38] Calvinism one of the two I get the two
[1:22:40] crossed up sometimes
[1:22:42] they think well you have salvation one
[1:22:44] second and then the next second it's
[1:22:46] gone hey you're born again one second
[1:22:48] you're in the economy of God the next
[1:22:50] second you're not
[1:22:51] you're you're born again a Son of God
[1:22:54] and at one minute and the next minute
[1:22:56] you're going 46 in the 45 the dove takes
[1:22:58] his flight and you die and you're going
[1:23:00] to hell
[1:23:01] it doesn't work like that right
[1:23:04] when brother bam talks about the dove
[1:23:06] taking its flight it's simply what we
[1:23:09] were talking about last week with the
[1:23:10] refilling of the Holy Spirit
[1:23:13] if you have a new birth and Christ is
[1:23:16] living in your soul
[1:23:18] the only thing that can regenerate
[1:23:20] itself is the anointing of the holy
[1:23:22] spirit that is upon you that is
[1:23:25] controlling your spirit and your body
[1:23:28] amen if the dove takes his flight that
[1:23:31] means that anointing that is with you
[1:23:33] takes its flame you don't lose your
[1:23:36] salvation God does an unsealed the soul
[1:23:39] and then leave
[1:23:41] and then come back and seal it back up
[1:23:43] again well that would be anti-scripture
[1:23:46] because the scripture says when he seals
[1:23:48] you you're sealed into your Eternal
[1:23:50] destination yes
[1:23:52] amen
[1:23:53] then how could that be
[1:23:55] see when he says the dove takes his
[1:23:57] flight Builders will make you think like
[1:23:59] well you know if if you don't work the
[1:24:02] work if you don't go exactly 45 or under
[1:24:05] you're doomed for hell
[1:24:08] oh that's just that's just fear that's
[1:24:11] just trying to live a law
[1:24:13] that's just trying to obey God in an
[1:24:17] Obedience of a law to try to be good
[1:24:20] enough we're not here to try to be good
[1:24:22] enough right we happen to accept and
[1:24:25] receive and believe the one that is good
[1:24:27] enough and he came just like John had
[1:24:30] the book and said it was nobody worthy
[1:24:32] but the lamb stepped forth
[1:24:35] amen amen amen the lamb stepped forth
[1:24:38] and he was able to take that forward and
[1:24:41] to loose those seals because he was
[1:24:43] Worthy the only one that was Worthy amen
[1:24:47] we're not here to try to be worthy we're
[1:24:49] here to fulfill the word of God and to
[1:24:52] live our lives as born-again Christians
[1:24:54] and to exhibit to let Jesus Christ live
[1:24:58] his life through US amen
[1:25:01] amen but the only way he can do it is to
[1:25:03] be born again yes in the soul a lot of
[1:25:06] people get a tingling on the flesh or
[1:25:08] they have a little gift or they speak in
[1:25:10] little tongues they have a little
[1:25:12] prophecy or they dance around a little
[1:25:14] bit or they jump up and down they Shout
[1:25:16] Scream and all the gifts and things
[1:25:18] that's wonderful I've seen anointings of
[1:25:20] that done around the world brother Brown
[1:25:22] said the heathens could outdo the
[1:25:24] Christian a thousand to one
[1:25:26] I probably misquoted that a little bit
[1:25:28] but the Heathen could do it over and
[1:25:30] over again and put a sword to themselves
[1:25:33] pour water through it and call on the
[1:25:35] devil
[1:25:36] see us see a pencil stand up on its own
[1:25:40] and write in an unknown tongue
[1:25:42] you tell me that's God that's the devil
[1:25:45] amen and worshiping the devil drink
[1:25:48] blood he said drink blood of a human
[1:25:49] skull call the devil
[1:25:51] amen turn around speak in tongues what
[1:25:54] are they working under that anointing
[1:25:57] amen that same anointing the same that
[1:26:00] was poured out on All Flesh that Peter
[1:26:02] said
[1:26:04] it it has
[1:26:05] and now you see the falseness of it but
[1:26:07] where there is the false there's
[1:26:13] because there's got to be a real for the
[1:26:15] false to come off
[1:26:17] amen somebody could come up to you and
[1:26:19] say I got a counterfeit seven dollar
[1:26:22] bill
[1:26:23] well you know first of all it's
[1:26:25] counterfeit because there's never been a
[1:26:26] real seven dollar bill
[1:26:28] yeah
[1:26:30] how could it be counterfeit because
[1:26:32] there's nothing to counterfeit off of
[1:26:34] only way you can make a seven dollar
[1:26:35] pill counterfeit is it's just not backed
[1:26:37] by the government that's the only reason
[1:26:39] you can say it's counterfeit because
[1:26:40] it's not a fake there's not a real seven
[1:26:42] dollar bill
[1:26:44] amen there's got to be a real before
[1:26:46] there can be a counterfeit there's got
[1:26:47] to be the truth before there's the false
[1:26:49] amen
[1:26:52] let's stand if we could I'm going to
[1:26:53] stop there
[1:26:58] because I want to finish this
[1:27:01] well it'll probably take a couple more
[1:27:03] services
[1:27:07] finish this because there's a lot that
[1:27:10] goes into the understanding of
[1:27:14] that false anointing at the end
[1:27:17] and Brendan's
[1:27:19] yeah brother Brown was here and he
[1:27:21] talked about all the impersonations but
[1:27:23] it's probably just as prevalent if not
[1:27:25] more so now than it was then especially
[1:27:28] after the prophet's gone off the scene
[1:27:30] and the way people are and trying to
[1:27:33] make a name for themselves and trying to
[1:27:35] be popular on TV or try to sell a bunch
[1:27:38] of books or try to uh have some kind of
[1:27:41] kingdom of themselves or some big huge
[1:27:43] church or uh there's all kinds of
[1:27:46] different reasons amen
[1:27:49] but the only reason that a true Holy
[1:27:51] Ghost Field Minister should have
[1:27:54] to preach the gospel
[1:27:56] amen
[1:27:58] the instant in season out of season amen

[1:32:26] some people
[1:32:28] don't get that

[1:32:34] the anointing will find out I think it

[1:32:40] Lord lays out
[1:32:42] he's out see brother Brown said that

[1:32:48] Christ to come and live in you yes amen
