Deuteronomy 11 26 behold I set before you this day a blessing and a curse a blessing if you obey the Commandments of the Lord your God which I command you this day and a curse if you will not obey the Commandments of the Lord your God but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day to go after other gods which ye have not known and it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whether thou go was to possess it that thou shalt put the blessing upon Mount Gerson and the curse upon Mount evil are they not on the other side Jordan by the way where the sun goes down in the land of the Canaanites which uh which dwell in the champagne over against gilgal beside the plains of Mora for ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you and ye shall possess it and dwell therein and ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day you could be seated if you'd like amen this is a a warning this is a uh an exhortation obviously that was given to the children of Israel that Moses escaped to the children of Israel they gave them a choice as every one of us are free moral agents every one of us have Choice everyone can go the way we want to go we can do the things we want to do we can live however we want to live we can make the choices we want to make but the but as Christians as the these children of God here uh the the word was set before them yes you have the choice but if you choose to obey God's word you will be blessed if you choose to go against God's word or not obey God's word then you will be cursed and that's pretty much the black and white of it uh as humans we always try to find gray areas we always try to find intermingled areas where we think well would God be okay with this and would this be something that I could get away with or is this something that uh that would be pleasing or displeasing to the Lord or something that we always try to find a gray area to work within but really when it comes right down to it the bottom line is if we obey God in God's word God blesses us if we come against God's word and we don't obey God's word we are living under curse and that's just the only two ways of it so as three moral agents we had that choice the whole world has that choice not just as Christians but everybody has Choice every day in whatever they decide to do in their free moral agencies Adam and Eve had choice they had to choose when when and the serpent came to Eve Eve had a choice what was she going to decide to do and she chose to disobey God's word and what did it do it brought curse Adam had that choice when it was presented to Adam Adam could have chose one way or the other whether he would accept or he would reject and he rejected and disobeyed God's word and what did it do it brought Curse God himself said if you are disobey this word then that that day that you do that that's the day you die amen well what is that uh that's nothing more than than living under hearse uh we oftentimes try to think uh if we enter into God's permissive will uh if I do this or or I disobey God here am I going to enter into God's permissive will and live in God's permissive will and I'll be okay in God's permissive will friend as you've heard me say over and over again living in God's permissive will in my opinion is failure am I we are not to live in God's permissive will we shouldn't go and God's permissible it's like well if I do this then God will forgive me obedience is what God looks for yes and obedience in Choice God's not looking for obedience in force he doesn't want to make us obey the word he wants us to do it by our free will he wants us to choose to obey his word because we want to because it's in our hearts to do it because it's the desire of our heart to do it not because he makes us do it but because we want to do it so the choice we have is based on not just our free will but the fact that God wants us to choose him over everything else God wants us to choose to obey the word he wants us to do that he doesn't want us to disobey the word and you see Disobedience at his was laid out here you see what he calls Disobedience a curse if you will not obey the Commandments of the Lord your God but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day to go after other gods so Disobedience was considered going after other gods right Disobedience to God's word is considered going now what would that other God be well it could be you you could be your own God right and you know that's like the popular thing in the in the world today it's a popular thing in this country and and people and people who profess to be Christians and even some ministers about her to come out say you you're you are your own God amen well if you are your own God then you created yourself you're the one that keeps your blood pumping and your heart going in and your mind operating well if that's the case then we would live forever because who is going to command as your own God your heart to stop beating or your mind to quit working or for you to get cancer or some kind of disease hey if you're your own God you say okay uh then I'm Healed amen no reason to go to the hospital I'm Healed well we can profess that but we profess that based on the fact that we know he's the one that heals us we profess our healing because our God heals us not that I am our own God but you become your own God if you decide to go your own way well I want to live by my own opinions well then you've become your own god well I want to live the way I want to go I want to do the things I want to do then you are your own God you have become your own God you've gone after other gods and that God is the one looking back at you in your mirror because you've decided to do it your way oh surely God will understand maybe he will he's an understanding God he's the god of mercy and Grace but I'm just telling you today and reading the Bible if we obey if we disobey God's word we're living under hers right amen if we don't follow what God's word commands for us to do then we're living under curse look what brother Braham said a couple of uh notes on on the on this choice and there's three more agency choosing of a bride 1965 brother Graham says now choosing abroad in many things of light we are given a choice the way of life itself is a choice amen we have a right to make our own way choose our own way that we want to live yes we do education is a choice we can choose whether we are going to be educated whether we're not going to be educated that's a choice we have the choice of right and wrong right or wrong is set before us the scripture God his word gives us shows right or wrong we have that choice everybody has that choice every man every woman boy girl has to choose whether they are going to live right or not live right it's a choice choice is a great thing your Eternal destination now here we go we're not talking about just living under blessings or cursings anymore your Eternal destination is a choice did you realize that you realize your Eternal destination is a choice amen it comes with a part of the blessings or a part of the cursing the blessings are you go to heaven to live with him eternally the cursings are you go to hell that's the that's the two choices your Eternal destination it's a choice and maybe tonight some of you will make that choice whether where you will spend eternity before the service is tonight if you turn God down many times there'll be one time you'll turn him down for the last time there is a line between mercy and judgment and it's a dangerous thing for a man or a woman boy or a girl to step across that line there for there is no return when you step across that deadline so tonight it must be the time that you make the decision the decision to choose life the decision to choose Christ amen obviously brother Branham in a more mixed congregation audience than we have here this morning but yet the but yet the the words still are true amen amen the words are still true we still have that choice yes amen many of us have made that choice long ago and our and our choice determination is that we want to be with him we want to go in a Rapture and spend eternity with him we've made that choice that's our determination amen [Music] now the breach message he says now of course when Adam fell to death he brought death upon all creation when he chose to disobey he brought death upon all creation remember that Chasm was thrown between him and God now he was given free moral agency and was given to them just as we have today to make a choice Adam and Eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong uh before them and that same tree that same tree says before each and every one of us today see God isn't doing it for Adam and Eve say well it's their fault not now it isn't but van says no not now it is your fault you can't place that on Adam now you've got to place it on yourself because right or wrong is set before you today amen set before us we're on the same basis Adam and Eve free moral agency but you see when we are redeemed we no more want our own choice praise God now we're getting somewhere when we are redeemed that we no more want our own choice we look at the word and we say Okay God I see in your word is so and so such and such then Lord according to your will according to your word what did we just see Have Thine Own Way Lord amen amen whatever it costs me wherever it takes me whatever it means in my life Lord I want your will yes amen I want your will whatever it does but we want his choice seed now Adam and Eve wanted their own choice they wanted to find out what it was to have wisdom so forth like that now one more leadership sometimes in life we have to confront the thing like this young man did because you are a moral being you are given uh a choice you are given the opportunity of choice you have Choice God made it so you can choose if uh if he'd put Adam and Eve on free moral agency so they could choose and then they made the wrong choice and um now he's he says see uh he can do no more to you than what he did to them he put them on the same thing so you can choose or reject because it's our choice our decision now Moses put before them of The Obedience of the word now that that's really the whole point I want to get to today is The Obedience of the word and obey the word what is it that comes and and our lives and our lives are lived when we obey God in his word now we know because we've all lived there we've all been there we know what it is when we obey God we obey his word we've seen it happen we've seen the results we know what it does when God uh when we obey God's word and that obedience brings us more into contact with the Lord Jesus and that's all that we're that that's our whole point of life is to grow closer to the Lord when we were born we were born in sin shaped iniquity to come the world speaking lives we couldn't be any further from God then that then was possible but as life goes on and as we choose and our choice is for him our whole point is to grow closer to him how do we grow closer to him how do we become more like him well he's the word so how do we become more like him we've got to become more like the word well how do we become more like the word by obeying the word by living the word yes we've been speaking about this over the past couple of services and the Lord put something on my heart that that I want to talk about going forward after today but it all hinges on this and Disobedience and and this obedience to the word becoming the word living the word letting that word permeate through you because you are the living embodiment of Jesus Christ on this Earth today and the only way you can be that the only way you can project that is by living and obeying the word amen it's the only way we can do it is by living and obeying that word now let's look at uh the 28th of the 28th chapter Deuteronomy still the 28th chapter amen Deuteronomy 28 if blessing and cursing was laid before them today or back then that same blessing and cursing is laid before us today yes hinges on The Obedience of God's word uh you can look at even uh let's just look even at brother Brown what happened to brother random when he disobeyed God's word yeah now this was an extreme situation because of an extreme individual a gift when brother random disobeyed God what did God do God took his wife and his little girl amen when brother random stood there and he tried to pray for his little girl a black sheep fell in front I'm not listening the Devil comes up and says Seether I told you he didn't care about you amen the result of Disobedience see I told you he didn't care about you he's not even listening to you he's not even listening to your prayer your little girl's as good as dead I'm paraphrasing of course amen she's not going to live God's not even listening to you well Sharon Rose he did and brother Branham came to the place to recognize what happened I think about the time that brother Branham uh they he had the managers and all you know I I think we all kind of hold brother random in a certain esteem but we got to understand brother Brown was a man yeah amen he was a man he was Flesh and Blood just like you and I he had decisions to make just like me and you right amen he lied to that rhs he had his daughter a lot of the IRS agent tell him I'm not here ran out the door see trying to find that gray area oh God will be okay with this I'll just run outside that way I'm really not here see we're all humans we're always trying to find that little way of trying to see his God good he'll be okay with this just tell me and he got his own daughter to lie for it and what happened he goes to pray for this little sick girl and God says take your hands off of her you're not fit to pray for her amen God help us amen what helped what happened when he went overseas I forgot where it was uh Africa Maybe and he had these he had these men that were uh his campaign managers and such they had all this stuff lined up and brother Brandon you got to go here this is where we got you set up this is where the forgive me but the people are the money is you got to go over here this is where we got it and God spoke to brother Brown and says you go over here this is where I want you but we've got it set up over here brother around God but they've got this over I don't care this is where I want you over here go over here amen what did Brother Brown do he disobeyed God he listened to man and he got an amoeba in his stomach that like to kill them amen but God was there with them of course God always does the repentance that brings us back it's never a what it's not to a place to where it it it's it's Unforgivable he just repented come back and make things right with the Lord and kept going on but brother Brown was in pain and sick for uh weeks I don't remember how long but a long time he was sick with that stomach that amoeba or whatever it was and made him so sick amen obedience what does it bring what does Disobedience bring God help us we know when we obey God's word that God's going to bless us we know that when we obey God's word he's going to multiply us and strengthen us and help us in every way we know he's going to always be there now Deuteronomy I had to turn to Deuteronomy 28 yeah 28 verse 1 and he shall come to pass if now there's the choice Amen brother random or brother Jesus Christ gave the rich on rule of the same choice Jesus Christ told the Rich Young Ruler if you will his decision is that all you've got give to the poor take up your cross and follow me that's all that's what he needed to get eternal life a little bit of money that the man had attained in life all he had to do was give it to his friends he said he loved them like himself anyway all he had to do is give it to him and he could follow Christ and had eternal life but he chose not to Jesus said if you will it was his decision in his decision was a bad one needless to say it brought curse we know where he ended up here is scripture and it shall come to pass if if Thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and to do some of his Commandments oh wait a minute that doesn't say psalm observe and do all his Commandments all his Commandments not just the ones you want to right not just the ones that work out best for you not just the ones that you think you can no all of them all of them all his Commandments which I command thee this day the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth praise God and he did it didn't he amen he did he made Israel that Beacon it was their choices that sunk them back down and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if Thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God okay now let's make this for us let's make it personal he's talking to the children of Israel here but let's make it personal and make this about you okay all these blessings shall come on Newton Bennett and overtake Newton Bennett if I shall hearken unto the voice of the Lord my God blessed shalt thou be in the city and blessed Thou shalt be in the field blessed I will be blessed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground and the fruit of thy cattle and increase of thy kind and flocks of thy sheep blessed shall be thy basket and thy store blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in and blessed thou be when thou goest out the Lord shall call thine enemies to rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face praise the Lord that means god fights my battles amen amen God's the one that takes care of it they shall come uh they shall come out against thee one way flee before the seven ways that just means you're in a hurry to get out of your presence amen that just means you're in a hurry to get out they're not lined up they're getting out as quick as they can and the Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses and in all amen all that thou setest thine hand unto and he will bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee amen your land is just your inheritance it doesn't mean a piece of dirt it means your inheritance it means your life it means that you not just your posterity but all that you put your hand to all that God as your blood of God all that God has blessed and given to you God will multiply and bless amen I mean what better thing could you ask for what other God out in here Muhammad and Buddha and all what other of those do this for their congregation for their followers for their believers amen I just say none of them oh there's plenty of people out in the world that are rich and have money and all these things but that's not the blessings that we're talking about amen sometimes it is finances sometimes it is Goods but the blessings of God goes so far beyond just the monetary things Amen in obeying God's word God brings obedience amen we in to our lives now let's go to the 15th verse but it shall come to pass if thou will not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe to do all his Commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day that all these curses all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee again is the difference between being obedient and the blessings of God and disobedient and the curses of God curse shall thou be in the city and curse shall thou be in the field curse shall be thy basket on thy story curse shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land and increase of thy kind and the flocks of thy sheep cursed shalt thou be when thou comeest in and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out the Lord shall send upon thee cursing vexation and rebuke in all that thou setest thine hand unto for to do until thou be destroyed and until thou perish quickly because of the wickedness of thy doings whereby thou has forsaken me the Lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee until he have consumed thee from off the land whether thou goest to possess it now those are some pretty severe curses Saints those are some pretty tough curses to to live under that that people live under those curses but look at the blessings that God gives let's go over to in Deuteronomy still the 29th chapter just some of the things that the Lord did for the children of Israel amen 29th chapter uh let's start with the first verse these are the words of the Covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab beside the Covenant which he made with them in horrib and Israel called unto all Israel and Moses called unto all Israel and said unto them ye have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto pharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his land why did he do that because of The Obedience of Moses now God heard the Cry of Israel and he promised to send a delivery said he would amen he prophesied it was in the scripture he said he would that the deliverer was coming but why did God do this because of The Obedience of one man because Moses decided that he would go down with a with a wife a baby and a stick in his hand to go take over the most powerful country in the world sometimes God asks us to do things and we say Lord I can't do it I'm incapable I'm not able to do this Lord I see in your word where it says that I'm supposed to do certain things but I can't do it go tell that to Moses oops amen go tell that to Moses one man with a stick in his hand to take over the most powerful country in the world could you imagine a person stepping off the boat in LA and coming in and people interviewing and looking and say well what are you doing here I'm going to take over this country oh you're just the nut hey put you in the funny farm and every time they touched you there's a curse something else happened amen finally get to the present the president said what are you doing here I'm here to take over oh that's he you're just crazy uh of course all that God did for Moses got him in the hollow Halls of pharaoh to begin with but you understand what I'm saying oh you'll you can never do this okay we'll find out that that day another curse oh that's just so and so that just happened in the next days another curse oh I'm not gonna obey that then fine finally he had to deliver God's people Moses did exactly what God said he would do because he obeyed God's word now I know Moses was hesitant at first and said oh I can't do this but God said I'll be with you I'll be with your mouth I'll take care of this I'll be with you I'll help you along the way and did he do it out of thin air God created fleezer bugs whatever the curse all the curses out of thin air blood into water add a thin air frogs everywhere out of thin air Locus everywhere he said God can't do this he is more than able amen and can do whatever it is that you have the name he said I can't do it yes you can he's got to believe you just gotta have faith and Obey and obedience and move on and move out on God's word Moses took over a whole country because he agreed to do that you see this because of this Moses called Israel back to the scripture now that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of pharaoh and uh Egypt unto Pharaoh unto all his servants and to all his land the great Temptations which thine eyes have seen the signs of those great Miracles yet the Lord hath not given you in heart to perceive ice to see and ears to hear unto this day I have led you these 40 years now they wouldn't go under the Candace The Showdown Acadia spartania they wouldn't go over and possess it Moses brought them to that place in obedience to God's word God blessed him in every way every time they turned around and when they come up to that place and they said over spies they said oh they're we're just we we can't do this we can't take it over and Joshua would come up and said we are more than Abel amen amen we are more than able but they listen to the others and it's oh we can't we can't go over there why because he looked at the circumstances amen don't let circumstances sway your your your decision processing let Faith do it let God's word do it let the obedience to God's word sway your decisions not just what you see or what the circumstances dictate I can't do this because XYZ but that's not what God's word says amen amen God's word says I will supply all your needs according to his riches and Glory now what are his riches try to count them you can't The Riches of God cannot even be measured friends well if he's going to bless you according to those riches then how could you ever be in want amen how could you ever be destitute with his righteous never forsaken his seat never beg any bread amen amen faith and obedience God takes care of it but for 40 years because they said oh we can't do it and looked at the circumstances oh they're they're bigger than us they're mightier than us well it's not about you it's about him amen your life your service your dedication your decision it's not about you it's about him amen that's where moral Newton needs to die so that more of Christ can live through me that's where more of us each one of you we need to die more so that more of Christ can live through US amen and when it looks to remember the other day we talked about the uh the vision of faith and looking through God's eyes not our eyes you look through God's eyes your decisions will be different your choices will change somewhat not drastically because we're you know faithful children of God but they but they will change see their eyes were trained on the Giants and not on God's promise God's promise says that you are going to you will go and you will possess that land and they did not here but they did they will be a disobedient but yet God still looked 40 years they roamed around 40 years in the wilderness uh fifth verse now I've LED you these uh uh have led you 40 years in the wilderness your clothes are not waxing old upon you and thy shoe is not waxing old upon my foot anybody never had anybody who ever had shoes 40 years old close 40 years old I haven't amen that means that I would be wearing a pair of shoes now that's older than my son 40 years and they're closed nor their shoes wore out That's What I Call blessing you say oh they got Bank loads of money no but God blesses them and the capacity to keep them going in their lives and to take care of their needs not always your wants but your needs amen and Moses is pointing this out you rejected God back there but for 40 years I've LED you we've wandered around this Wilderness and yet your clothes are still not old and your shoes and I'll fall off your feet praise the Lord amen amen you have not eaten bread neither have you drunk wine or strong drink that ye might know that I am the Lord your God and when you come unto this place I am the king of heshbun and of the king of basin came out against uh against us unto battle and we smoked them and we took their land and we gave it for an inheritance of the Reuben Isis of the Dead ice in the halftime of the mass praise the Lord you saw when the enemy came what I did for you God keep therefore keep therefore o saints of God keep therefore the words of this coming and do them that ye may prosper in all that you do prosper in all that you do amen amen you'll never be wanting amen never be wanting God will be there God will take care of him God will bless you Deuteronomy 30 11. look at this 30 11 for this commandment which I command thee that be this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off in other words what he's saying is what we're doing what we're saying what God's asking of you is not impossible what God's asking of you is not unreachable it's not unattainable this is this is doable it is attainable by you amen he says this day it is not hidden from me neither is it for all it is not in heaven that thou should say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it down unto us what that we may hear it and do it no it's right here nigh unto thee neither is it beyond the sea that thou should say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it no you is right here but the word the word and listen now this now this applies to every one of us the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it in thy mouth in thy heart that thou mayest do it what is it that God's looking for from his children obedience from our hearts amen from our hearts it's in your mind in your heart that you do it see I have set before thee this day life and good and death and Evil and that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to keep his Commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whether thou goest to possess it amen amen but if thine heart turn away so that thou will not hear but shall be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them again example yourself I denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely pursue and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whether thou passes over Jordan to go to possess it I call Heaven and Earth a record uh to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life choose life that both thou and thy seed may live that thou mayest love the Lord thy God and that thou mayest obey his voice and that thou thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord swear unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give them now remember a land land for us is the Holy Ghost our promised land is the Holy Ghost amen the promises in that spirit is what we know we just sang belongs to us the promises of God's word in the Holy Ghost belongs to us you go every one of us have read the Bible amen we know what the promise of gods has given us how many times have you heard of things in this situation where God intervenes to take care I remember one time um I heard a story uh uh not not a story but um I don't like saying story because it almost makes it sound fictional uh a real in fact it may have been Wilson him or you hate throwing his name out there because it might not have been but uh that they were going down uh maybe it wasn't him anyway this person was going as a minister going to preach the word and the Lord just sent them and when God sends you and he takes care of you yeah God's will won't Lead You whereas Grace can't keep you that's right and he's running out of gas he goes and pours water in the gas tank and prays over it says Lord amen I need to get to so-and-so a place he pours this water he goes goes to church preaches all everything that went with it drove back home not one single problem God took care of him because he was obedient to God's voice now he could have said oh God I can't go I don't have any gas I don't have any money I can't go do this it's impossible for me don't look at the circumstances God will take care of it God didn't fill his wallet with a bunch of money but he gave him the encouragement the unction just put some water I mean who would put water in the gas tank of their car unless he just wanted their car to fall apart and become a jalopy uh go to the dump amen now growing a car amen run the engine who would do that whatever inspiration obedience you just do according to what the Lord gives you and God blesses it am us amen obedience will take us so much further than we ever imagined that it would seems amen look at this in the church age book samuraiian Church age uh this is well I think it's out of the books quote one page 113. he said death death was not only the seed of the false Vine but even in the True Vine there was a creeping paralysis and an impotence because they had already drifted from the unadulterated truth of the first few years of Pentecost now that she's talking about smyrnia remember smyrnia was was the church age that was anointed for death uh smyrnia actually as the root words uh Murr in it which which means bitter for the bitterness of death uh this Murr is what they use one of the things they gave to Jesus the wise men uh one of the gifts given to Jesus was myrrh which was a signification of the anointing of his death amen so smyrnia the church was anointed for death Murr being bitter there was a paralysis and impotence that had drifted in that had caused that church to to drift away from the unadulterated truth after the first few years of Pentecost and no True Believer now this is the point I want to get to listen now and no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive then his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God Amen praise the Lord yes amen no True Believer is any stronger spiritually or healthy in alive spiritually then his knowledge of an adherence to obedience the pure word of God amen amen the pure word of God the adherence to the pure word of God amen nobody none of us are any stronger or any more prosperous or any more blessed than than our adherence to the word of God amen let's go to another scripture before I close here Malachi chapter 3 what other place it speaks about blessings and cursings amen I mean even when Jesus came Jesus made decisions Jesus made choices amen Jesus even I noticed afterwards last week and I must apologize I I shorted Jesus a couple of disciples last week and my apologies for that I think I said 10 a couple of times and we know it's 12. Amen I don't know I mean 12 is my favorite number so uh but he had 12 disciples God chose them amen God chose the twelve God even chose Judas the one that betrayed him right he's the one that chose him and picked him God made plenty of choices Jesus whether you will see her on Earth choices that he had to make amen was he going to obey God was he going to obey God's word was he going to go to Calvary in obedience or was he just gonna was he gonna call 12 Legions of angels to take him off that cross and all of us die and go to hell he made a choice his choice brought life his choice brought blessings his choice brought eternal life to those that would believe to receive and accept it amen what are our choices today amen before we go to Malachi let me read this now this is a lot of times people get misunderstood uh I'm gonna try to help clarify this a little bit but in greater than Solomon is here this is 1962. brother man talks about uh the correction uh that God uses that people get away from God to bring God back to where or to bring the people back to where there should be in the Lord now we all know God uses correction amen chastisement as we call it as a as the scripture says to bring uh things back to where they should be from the skewed Vision that they that it becomes in our lives sometimes we get off kilter we get off we get off balance with the word God wants to bring us back amen look now here's what it is when you're looking for instance you got great faith usually um he says them that Mrs comes in uh now say for instance we've got great faith and here stands a man on the platform all having a great time shouting and the glory to God around I said now maybe this man stole some money he lived evil maybe he run around with some woman immorally or done a murderer or something like that God uh God had put this sickness on him amen look down so you see that this man is living an immoral life and God puts a sickness on him why would God do that you know God uses sickness for whips to bring us to him amen to bring us teach us amen not forcing but teaching us I mean it's sort of like appearance discipline I mean ever got whipped when you were a child but uh it was a correction it was to bring us back into Focus that to understand this is wrong this is disobedient to Mom and Daddy or uh disobedient to the laws or whatever it is and a discipline is to bring you back to to to focus to understand our we are to obey the word the obey uh Mom and Daddy it doesn't force them uh Whip and never forced anybody uh I've heard testimony people say they got whipped all the time and went out and did the exact same thing over and over again amen but it's to help Direct so God's not forcing anybody but giving direction so you understand when you look at this I know I said earlier God wants it doesn't Force anybody he doesn't but he does give us Direction and correction to help us understand when we get off the path so this he says now this man is living immoral whoever he may be God put a sickness on this man you know God uses sickness for whips to bring us to him you believe that sure it is um God does that now if you notice this uh uh half notice this prophetic gifts uh you can get yourself in trouble certainly can now what if this man's done this evil and I'm standing here uh with bulldog Faith great big Bulldog faith and I grab a hold of him and say hallelujah Satan turn him loose the glory of God and I take that disease off him that God put on him for a purpose he said that I'm in trouble with God amen amen God put this on this person to correct them and to bring them back into focus and obedience and where they should be with God and then that man comes up and like I've said before uh not multiple times but I've said it before when when people come up for prayer I made sure to check my spirit because if God's allowing something to happen to one of us for some reason and maybe not just us but just anyone really and God's trying to bring that to a place to to bring that person where they should be with him and that and that prayer name and it's not just would just be me it could be any of us and you pray that disease off that person that God's using to bring it back then I'm held accountable to God I've had people come up before me before not here not in this church amen but I've had people come up before me before one in prayer because you know I used to evangelize a good bit when I was out and when I first started ministry and people would come up and ask for prayer and they would stand there and I feel unction to the Lord said don't pray for them don't pray this whatever it was don't pray this and so I pray I pray for the person but I just say Lord your will be done that's all I'd say I wouldn't ask God to heal them I wouldn't command Satan to leave them uh I wouldn't pronounce healing on that person if I felt God unctioning me for a reason now it's been very rare in I've lost track now in in 30 plus years in of minutes 35 years of ministering 34 35 years of ministering it's only happened a couple of times in the thousands of times I've ministers only happened a couple times but it happens and it's true and brother Branham brings it a point to understand if God did this for a reason this person is living let's just say this person is living under a curse because of their Disobedience and sickness has come on this person to correct them out of this curse and I get and I pray that uh that correction off of them that I'm in trouble with God amen you understand if that if that person is living under a curse by Disobedience this person he's talking about living in sin they're living under that curse and you come out see you you can't bless what God is cursed and you can't curse what God is blessed and if it's living under a curse I cannot pronounce blessings on it right you cannot that's just a fact that's just that's just God's word amen so God is the one that's in control of taking care of this not us we just want to be obedient to his word and whatever he calls for us to do amen whatever purpose whatever reason many times we don't understand many times it's beyond our comprehension but it's all for a reason it's all for a purpose amen and sometimes it's just a matter of getting off skewed just a little bit maybe we've listened to the loan the wrong person maybe we've obeyed a word from someone or someplace else that we shouldn't have maybe we've gone astray in some way and we've not been we've not been true with God's word and and it's not something that's catastrophic necessarily but but it can bring a person into living under under that curse because of the disobedience and God's going to do something to bring that person back where they should be amen amen let's look at this in Malachi chapter 3 there's one other place I'm going to finish with this there's only this one other place in the scripture and I'm going to close [Music] that God speaks about the blessings and curses the blessing curse Malachi 3 Malachi chapter 3 um let's see where did I want to start here amen let's just start with verse six Malachi chapter 3 verse 6. for I am for I am the Lord I change not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed now a lot of people would say oh well that's Old Testament the Bible says he doesn't change amen amen so that that's one of the whole points of this to understand I am the Lord I am the Lord I change not so it doesn't matter that Malachi is in the Old Testament it matters that it's God's word therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and I will return unto you saith the Lord of hosts but ye say wherein shall we return now look at his answer wherein the question then is hypothetical wherein shall we return so then he says well will a man rob God yet ye have robbed me but you say where and have we robbed thee he said in tithes and offering ye are cursed with a curse for ye have robbed me even this whole nation bringing all the ties into the storehouse that there may be me in my house and prove me now there we have saith the Lord of hosts if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out of blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it now here you've got cursing and blessing obedience brings blessings blessing so to the point that the only place in the scripture where God says try me prove me and see if I won't do what I said I would do and what did he say he would do he said he would open up the windows of heaven and pour out blessings that there shall not be room enough to receive amen now God's God's not trying to scare you amen he's just putting the word out I'm not trying to scare you that's just what the word says you either Believe it or you don't right yes or obey it or you don't that's the only two choices if you listen and obey there's blessings that you won't have room enough to receive amen you all know that amen praise the Lord we know that but what's the worst part about it if you've robbed God you are cursed not just cursed but cursed with a curse um God have mercy I a friend don't want to live under a curse and I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast her fruit before the time in the field saith the Lord of hosts and All Nations shall call you blessed amen amen praise the Lord All Nations shall call you blessed now he's talking about the nation of Israel I'm talking about us as individuals right amen no one will be able to deny that you're a child of God no one will be able to say that you are not the Blessed of God because all will know that you are blessed and ye shall be a delightsome land saith the Lord of hosts your words uh have been Stout against me saith the Lord amen so we'll finish there blessings cursings it's our choice we live under one or the other amen we live under one or the other we live under the blessing we live in another cursing amen if if living under the curse then then we we will reap the fruits of that of that curse amen this man in this story brother Branham gave he reaped the fruits of the curse he lived under he became a very sick man to the point that he went up there to be I don't think brother banham ever told what the disease was but he was sick to the point of disease to coming up to ask for to ask for prayer to ask to be healed I can't even imagine how many times brother Branham went through this amen where people would come up that were that were under a specific curse for a reason right amen God didn't bless that or did bless that person brother Branham would not bless that person you can't bless what's cursed right amen God knows yes he does and God's The Wanted control of it we just have to have a faith and obedience and our choice today what is our choice are we going to obey God's word are we going to reject God's word are we going to say What God Says are we going to say what I say or what somebody else has said that's contrary to God's word amen it's contrary to God's word Saints Let It Go amen amen I don't care who says it if it's con if brother Branham said something contrary to God's word I would have nothing to do with it amen anybody I don't care who they are they say something against this word Genesis 1 revelation 22 don't you have anything to do with it amen because that person is living under a curse and they're wanting you to come under that curse as well don't do it you live a blessed life yes amen and God blesses you amen how many testimonies have we had of that of God's blessings that God opens up the windows of Heaven times you never even imagine testimonies that we've had here of the things that God has done for us not just physical healings but sometimes simple things like a lost item or not being able to take the canopy off your car and God call me the winds just things that are blessings in our lives that are innumerable well you know the wind just stopped No it didn't amen other keys were always there no they weren't God's the one that takes care of that you could say oh brother Dennis find these pennies all over the place that's just coincidence I guarantee you one thing you'll never convince him of that amen the the penny fairy came in his house every night laid pennies out so brother Dennis could find that's God God's showing to him and letting him know that's living under the blessing see we know heard so much of it Saint amen that God has blessed us so much and so thankful to him for it amen amen no other way to live Saints no better way to live and to live for the Lord Jesus faith and obedience in his word praise the Lord let's stand if we could amen praise the Lord I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to live in obedience to his word I want to say yes amen I want to say yes Lord even when I see something that I don't understand even if I see something that I don't think I could do but remember scripture says look it's not way up there that you can't get it it's not way out there that you can't get it it's not it's right here not even in your mouth in your heart amen all right let's be obedient be obedient to that word will live blessed lives if we do it amen amen we'll be a blessed church we already are a blessed church but we'll be a multiplied blessed church we make those decisions that are that are obedience to God's word amen

thing the devil could bring to you amen that you don't have the Conquering power over by the blessings of the Lord amen you know I believe that when when when God looked at job and said he was perfect and upright and there was a hedge around him the devil says I can't get to him and there was heads why was it what Edge a hedge a hedge was around job not because he was a sinner hedge wasn't around job because he lived and did whatever he wanted it was a hedge around job because it was no corner of job's life that Satan could find to get into there was no part of job's life that Satan could infiltrate because Joe was a perfect and upright man before God amen the Hedge wasn't a literal hedge it was the fact that Satan had nothing to work with amen praise the Lord it's like the devil coming and telling that clock to come and murder us all you can't work with that clock to do that he could try to go get somebody outside to do that amen he had nothing to work with praise the Lord am
