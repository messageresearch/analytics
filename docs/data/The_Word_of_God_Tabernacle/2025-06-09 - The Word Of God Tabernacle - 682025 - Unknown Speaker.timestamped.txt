[23:36] saints, to be living in the day that we

[23:40] it's tough, especially to see all the
[23:42] sin think oh my. I I can't I can't even
[23:46] begin to
[23:48] describe. You think it's something out
[23:50] here and you think it's something in
[23:51] Tucson, man. When you go to those big
[23:53] cities, it's just it it was just it was
[23:57] so much. It's neat to see things you
[23:59] never seen before. But my my it just was
[24:01] so grieving. So many things just so
[24:04] demonic, so evil, so wicked just to see.
[24:08] You see a little taste of it, I guess,
[24:10] from time to time here. But just it's so
[24:13] bad. It's just gotten so wicked. And
[24:16] we're probably and the sad part of it is
[24:18] even with all of that, we are still
[24:20] probably the best country in the world
[24:23] for as far as that's concerned. Oh God
[24:25] help us. I feel like traveling home,
[24:27] saints. Amen. I feel like going home.

[24:38] Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. So thankful
[24:40] to be back with you. Amen. Appreciate
[24:42] your prayers. Thank you. I thank the
[24:44] Lord for blessing us, giving us a good
[24:46] trip, good time together. Uh it was a
[24:49] long trip, but everything just the Lord
[24:51] just kind of brought everything together
[24:53] and all the flights were good and on
[24:55] time and uh everything just kind of come
[24:57] as we got there and uh we check in and
[25:00] there stands somebody to help us with
[25:02] what we were wanting to do and stuff
[25:04] like that. It was just so nice. Uh so
[25:06] good to be away. So good to see things
[25:08] we've never seen before, been a part of
[25:09] and partake of and uh just appreciate
[25:13] the Lord's blessing. And uh we got a
[25:15] little bit of rest, but we also I
[25:16] tallied it up on my uh thing on my phone
[25:21] uh my uh help thing that comes on your
[25:24] phone. Uh I for I didn't count the
[25:26] steps, but we we walked about 50 miles
[25:29] while we were gone. Me and Sonia did.
[25:31] And you know, Sonia was had a little
[25:33] congestion and cough before we left. And
[25:36] um it didn't get a whole lot better
[25:38] while we were gone. It did a little bit,
[25:40] but she still was a trooper and just
[25:42] stayed right there. We uh we did a lot
[25:44] of walking, a lot of uh u investigating
[25:47] and looking and uh just enjoyed the
[25:50] time. So appreciate the Lord's goodness.
[25:52] And again, I appreciate one's indulgence
[25:54] for the time off of service. If I had a
[25:57] little help, maybe ministering wise, we
[25:59] wouldn't have had to done that. We have
[26:00] somebody else to step in. But anyway,
[26:02] the Lord always makes a way. So
[26:04] appreciate your patience with us and uh
[26:07] your prayers and the Lord's been good.
[26:09] So very thankful Lord's good to us
[26:12] today. Amen. I'm leaving out again
[26:14] today. Uh going to California to work.
[26:17] So appreciate your prayers for that as
[26:19] well. Uh Sister Norma said that she u uh
[26:23] I guess they had to get the battery on
[26:25] her car charged or something this
[26:26] morning. So, she thought she'd be a
[26:28] little bit late, which she is, but she
[26:30] did give a couple of prayer requests she
[26:32] wanted us to mention today. Uh, we want
[26:35] to remember her granddaughter, Amanda.
[26:38] Uh, I believe it was Amanda in prayer.
[26:40] Uh, she she's still having a lot of
[26:42] problems with her stomach even after the
[26:44] surgery. Uh, so please remember her in
[26:47] prayer if you will. Also, uh, as we have
[26:50] found out and as Sonia has told me and
[26:52] and all that has several of you may
[26:55] already know, but please remember Sister
[26:56] Dorothy in prayer uh, up in the White
[26:59] Mountains, uh, a precious older sister
[27:03] that's been very dear friends to Sister
[27:05] Norma and of course my wife and
[27:07] different ones. So, please remember her
[27:09] in prayer. She's very sick, sick, weak,
[27:12] uh, and really needs a touch from the
[27:14] Lord. We've prayed for her several times
[27:16] in the past. uh she's really needed a
[27:18] touch from the Lord and the Lord's
[27:20] brought her through and the Lord has
[27:22] helped her and brought her into this
[27:24] place. Uh but you know these bodies uh
[27:27] they were intentionally when God created
[27:30] us meant to last forever but after the
[27:32] fallen sin uh they are not intended to
[27:35] last forever. Uh so there does come a
[27:38] time the Lord carries we'll all go that
[27:40] way. Uh but we do want to remember our
[27:43] sister in prayer. Um that the Lord would
[27:45] just touch her and strengthen her and
[27:48] bring her back. We we don't know what
[27:49] the will of the Lord is, but we're
[27:51] believing that God's uh bringing health
[27:54] and strength back into our sister
[27:56] Dorothy. So please remember that in
[27:57] prayer if you would. Good to see brother
[27:59] and sister Pat. Amen. God bless you.
[28:01] Miss y'all so much when you're not here.
[28:03] Wish I could tell you how much I miss
[28:04] you, but I know you try. I do. Uh but we
[28:07] sure miss you so much. Good to have Anna
[28:09] and Steve back with us, too. God bless
[28:11] you as well and each of you. So thankful
[28:13] the Lord's blessed us. Amen. Anyone else
[28:15] have a request on your heart. That's all
[28:17] I have for prayer requests. So remember
[28:19] those that aren't here for Sister
[28:21] Karen's back in the mountains. Please
[28:23] remember Sister Lydia and Sister Sheilia
[28:25] uh in prayer.

[28:33] Sister She is right there waving her
[28:35] hand at me saying you're misspoken,

[29:18] needs the Lord in his life. He's got
[29:20] Danny in his life. So, he'll just take

[29:26] and his healer. But let's please
[29:29] continue to remember Danny's friend and
[29:31] neighbor.

[31:02] world with all the earthquakes, with all
[31:05] the volcanoes, with all that is
[31:07] happening is Lord showing that it's
[31:10] headed for that new heavens, that new
[31:12] earth, that's what it's groaning for,
[31:15] Father. Yes, God. Amen. And Lord, help
[31:17] us to recognize that if we're so caught
[31:20] up with the things of the world, Lord,
[31:24] trying to establish ourselves that
[31:26] you're coming as a way off, we're going
[31:29] to miss it. The prophet even said, "If
[31:32] you're not prayed up, you're not in the
[31:35] spirit, you're not reading the word,
[31:37] you're not hearing no tape, you're not
[31:39] coming to church, you're not paying your
[31:41] tithe, you're not loving one another. Oh
[31:45] father, we're going to be caught up with
[31:47] the mark of the beast and not even know
[31:50] it. Oh, it's a sobering hour. Father
[31:53] God, as the word says, when they say
[31:56] peace and safety, then sudden
[31:59] destruction cometh upon this world like
[32:03] a woman in travail, and there shall not
[32:06] be escape. Lord, speak to our hearts as
[32:10] our our pastor has spoken. the hour
[32:13] slave. I believe along with him and many
[32:16] others in this congregation today, your
[32:20] coming is very very close. Amen. Unless
[32:25] you speak to our hearts, we're going to
[32:27] miss it. Father, help us, Lord. We're
[32:29] going to play church. We're going to uh
[32:32] just take you for granted. The word has
[32:36] come. We have no
[32:38] excuse. We got to try harder. Help us.
[32:42] We got to persevere. Help us. We got to
[32:44] be more diligent than ever before,
[32:47] Father. And Lord, there are many are
[32:50] sick this morning. Yes, Lord. Oh, Sister
[32:53] Normous request. And Sister
[32:57] Dorothy, we claim victory. You claim
[32:59] their healing in the name of the Lord
[33:02] Jesus Christ. For thou art a high priest
[33:05] that can be touched by the feelings of
[33:08] our infirmities. Hallelujah. And with
[33:10] his stripes we are healed and we claim
[33:13] it. We believe it. Father, we are more
[33:16] than conquerors in the name of Jesus
[33:18] Christ. Hallelujah. Greater heed us in
[33:20] us than he us in the world. Thank you.
[33:23] If God be with us, who can be against
[33:25] us? Oh father, all the unspoken
[33:28] requests, you know the hearts of your
[33:30] children, may you grant to them an
[33:34] overflowing portion of their desires.
[33:37] Grant it Lord. Father grant it and bless
[33:40] the service this morning. May our hearts
[33:44] be hungering and thirsting for your
[33:46] righteousness knowing we shall be
[33:48] filled. Amen. And let the word just come
[33:52] and just make us more better Christians
[33:56] in the full stature of Jesus Christ.
[33:59] Hallelujah. In your name we pray. In the
[34:00] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[34:03] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You can be
[34:06] seated if you like.
[34:08] Amen. Praise the Lord. So thankful for
[34:10] the Lord's
[34:11] goodness blessing us today. Amen. Micah
[34:14] has a song he wants to sing for us
[34:16] today. So pray for him. Bless
[34:22] him. Amen. Lord bless him.
[34:28] Amen. Bless you. I sang the song several
[34:31] times. I thought it was in the program,
[34:34] but it's not. But most probably most All
[34:37] the words of a single
[34:41] [Music]

[35:31] [Music]
[35:33] call at the midnight
[35:38] cry. We'll be glowing homeless.
[35:43] Hallelujah.
[35:45] And when Jesus steps
[35:49] out on the clouds of all his
[35:55] children, the dead in Christ shall
[36:00] rise and meet him in the air.
[36:07] Those that
[36:12] remain will be quickly changed.
[36:19] Thank you, Jesus. At the midnight.
[36:22] Amen.
[36:24] We'll be going home.
[36:32] I look around
[36:34] me. We see prophecies
[36:41] fulfilling and the signs of the
[36:46] time appearing everywhere.
[36:52] I can almost see our
[36:57] father saying son to mid your
[37:04] children at the midnight
[37:08] cry. The bride of Christ will rise.
[37:11] Hallelujah. Amen.
[37:14] Yes. And when Jesus steps
[37:19] out on the clouds of all his
[37:25] children, the dead in Christ
[37:30] arise to meet him in the
[37:36] air. And those that
[37:41] remain will be quickly
[37:47] changed in the midnight
[37:52] cry. We'll be going home. Amen. Yes,
[37:56] Jesus. That last verse again.
[37:59] As we look around
[38:02] us, we see prophecies fulfilling.

[38:10] And there signs of the
[38:14] times. They're appearing
[38:17] [Music]
[38:19] everywhere. I can almost see the
[38:25] father saying, "Son, come get your
[38:27] children.
[38:30] [Music]
[38:32] At the
[38:35] midnight, the bride of Christ will rise.
[38:42] And when Jesus steps
[38:46] down on the clouds of all his
[38:52] children, the dead in Christ shall
[38:58] rise to meet in the
[39:03] air. And those that
[39:05] [Music]
[39:09] remain will be bleaching.
[39:15] Yes. Amen. At the midnight.
[39:19] Hallelujah. We'll be going
[39:24] home. That's when Jesus steps
[39:29] out on the clouds of all his children.
[39:36] telling Christ our
[39:41] lives in the
[39:45] air and those that
[39:48] [Music]
[39:50] remain will be quickly
[39:54] [Music]

[41:30] to do
[41:32] something and keep you around. Amen. He
[41:36] made Sarah young again. Yes. He wasn't
[41:38] done with her. Praise the Lord. That's
[41:41] right. Anybody whatever. Amen. You get
[41:44] ready to die then. Yep. You're going to
[41:46] go be with the Lord. Praise the Lord
[41:48] Jesus.
[41:50] Amen. That's so true. Amen. That's so
[41:53] true. I know how many times I've even
[41:56] said here, Amen. Lord's will be done,
[41:59] but as far as I'm concerned, when when
[42:01] my work's done, I just soon not hang
[42:03] around this nasty place. I just soon

[42:08] my family and all of you, and I love
[42:11] being here. I love uh having life. Amen.
[42:15] Uh but I'm only here for him. Yes. So
[42:18] when that purpose is fulfilled and done
[42:20] then what purpose do I have uh is
[42:24] because my whole my whole reason for
[42:26] living is him. Yes. My whole my whole
[42:28] point of being is him. So if there's no
[42:30] him then there's no me. There's no me

[42:36] me go. Praise the Lord. But if there's
[42:38] work to do, if there's something to be
[42:40] done, if there's a reason for my being
[42:42] here, Amen. then praise the Lord. Let's
[42:45] do everything we can. Amen. to fulfill
[42:47] what that purpose is the Lord put in our
[42:49] life to do. Amen. Because we're only
[42:51] here for him. Praise the Lord. That's

[42:57] that. Praise the Lord. Amen. Anyone
[43:02] else? Amen. Let's go ahead and stand to
[43:05] our feet then and we'll just turn to the
[43:08] scripture now uh in back into Romans
[43:11] chapter 8. This will be the last uh as
[43:13] far as I can tell now this will be the
[43:15] last part of the of this manifested sons
[43:18] of
[43:19] God. So this will be adoption part 16
[43:25] manifested sons of God part five and
[43:28] again the Lord willing this will be um
[43:30] far as I can see now this will be the
[43:32] last part of the manifested sons of God
[43:35] portion of adoption. Amen.
[43:39] Amen. So, Romans chapter
[43:41] 8. Amen. We'll just begin reading here.
[43:44] Read a few verses of scripture. We let
[43:46] you be seated. We'll start with the 19th
[43:48] verse. So, Romans 8
[43:52] 19. That's where we want to begin
[43:54] reading today. Before we do though,
[43:56] could we just bow our heads for another
[43:58] word of prayer? Precious Lord, we're
[44:00] again so very thankful, Father, of your
[44:03] blessings and your love to us. Thank you
[44:05] so much for this service, this time.
[44:07] Thank you for this place. Thank you for
[44:09] the realization, the revelation of your
[44:11] word, Lord, and the realization the hour
[44:13] and the day that we live. recognizing
[44:15] and seeing so many things that's
[44:17] happening Lord around us and the
[44:19] prophecy being fulfilling and Lord the
[44:22] the things that we understand that's
[44:24] happening by the word and God and and
[44:27] even beyond all that the Holy Spirit
[44:29] that's within each one of us that's
[44:31] crying out within us to recognize and
[44:34] see the day recognize and see the hour
[44:37] to recognize and see how close we are
[44:39] Lord oh God it's so time Lord to g our
[44:43] loins and strengthen ourselves and get
[44:46] ourselves prepared, ready, Lord. God, to
[44:49] meet you because that time is drawing
[44:51] near. Father, may you just help us with
[44:54] it, Lord. God, this service, may this
[44:56] service be just a little portion of
[44:58] that, Lord. May this service be a time,
[45:01] God, that you come and meet with us once
[45:03] again, Lord, and speak to our hearts
[45:05] from your word. May this service, may
[45:07] this time be that time, Lord, that's
[45:09] been set aside that God, you would come
[45:11] and minister and speak and reveal to us
[45:14] this word and show us where we fall
[45:16] short and bring us along, Lord, in your
[45:18] word and help us, God, as we walk out of
[45:21] this place to be closer to you and more
[45:23] like you than when we came in. God, we
[45:27] just pray that you would let this word
[45:29] minister to our hearts and needs. We
[45:31] know it will not return void, Lord, but
[45:34] we pray, God, that you'd let it
[45:35] accomplish that, that you'd send it
[45:37] forth for the purpose of us being here,
[45:39] this place, this time. We commit it to
[45:42] you now and ask your blessings upon it.
[45:44] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[45:46] pray. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[45:50] Pardon me. Romans
[45:51] 8 verse 19. For the earnest expectation
[45:55] of the creature waited for the
[45:58] manifestation of the sons of God. For
[46:01] the creature was made subject to vanity,
[46:04] not willingly, but by reason of him who
[46:06] had subjected the same in hope. Because
[46:09] the creature itself also shall be
[46:11] delivered. The creature itself shall be
[46:14] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[46:17] into the glorious liberty of the
[46:18] children of God. For we know that the
[46:21] whole creation groanth and travaleth in
[46:24] pain together until now. And not only
[46:28] they, but ourselves also, which have the
[46:31] first fruits of the spirit, even we
[46:32] ourselves grown within ourselves,
[46:35] waiting for the adoption, do it, that is
[46:38] to say, the redemption of our bodies.
[46:42] You could be seated if you'd like.
[46:45] Amen. Want to continue on a little bit
[46:47] in the creation part of this and
[46:49] recognizing here that the scripture says
[46:52] that the whole creation groaning,
[46:54] waiting, longing can get back to that
[46:57] place that it was at the first in the
[47:00] creation that God created it with Adam
[47:02] in the in the Garden of Eden. Amen. That
[47:05] all of creation wants to get back to
[47:07] that place. We ourselves longing to get
[47:11] back to that place. Amen. But the
[47:13] animals out here can't walk through that
[47:15] door and tell you how much that they're
[47:16] looking and longing for that time. Body
[47:19] life, you can't have a tomato plant come
[47:20] through that door and tell you how much.
[47:22] But we can look in the scripture and
[47:24] realize that that itself is getting to
[47:27] that place. Amen. Looking longing for
[47:30] that time that we all come back to that
[47:32] place of perfection that it was in the
[47:34] beginning. So let's go to St. John
[47:37] chapter 16.
[47:39] Amen. going to read a couple verses of
[47:41] scripture from
[47:42] here. St. John chapter
[47:48] 16. We'll also read beginning with the
[47:51] 19th verse in uh in St. John 16. St.
[47:55] John
[47:58] 16:19. Now Jesus knew that they were
[48:01] desirous to ask him and said unto them,
[48:04] "Do you inquire among yourselves of that
[48:06] I said, A little while and ye shall not
[48:09] see me? And again, a little while and ye
[48:12] shall see me. Verily, verily, I say unto
[48:15] you, that ye shall weep and
[48:18] lament, but the world shall rejoice."
[48:22] Now, what she talking about is going
[48:24] away. Amen. They're going to be
[48:26] sorrowful. They're going to be sad.
[48:29] They're going to weep and lament. But
[48:31] the world, the ones that crucified him,
[48:34] are going to rejoice. They think they
[48:36] finally got rid of it. Amen. And ye
[48:40] shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow
[48:43] shall be turned into joy. So what he's
[48:46] saying, I'll go and I'll come again.
[48:48] Amen. You'll be sorrowful when I go, but
[48:51] when I come again, you'll be happy.
[48:53] Amen. Amen. Because you'll see your
[48:55] sorrow shall be turned into joy. A lot
[48:58] of we see the things we see today. Uh
[49:01] honestly, a lot of the things that I see
[49:02] in the world today makes me sad. Amen.
[49:05] Honestly, I'm very sorrowful for a lot
[49:08] of the things, especially again going to
[49:10] some of these big cities and seeing some
[49:12] of that stuff. Uh really makes you
[49:14] sorrowful the way that humanity has
[49:16] gotten to. Yes. Where humanity has come
[49:19] to really ought to bring us to tears,
[49:21] saints, the way it is. and recognizing
[49:24] without God, without Jesus Christ, these
[49:26] people are going to hell, right? They're
[49:28] going to burn in hell. Amen. And and be
[49:32] in a tormented state and position. Yeah.
[49:35] And it makes me sad. Yeah. It's
[49:37] sorrowful. I get cynical about it
[49:39] sometimes. And my wife has to correct
[49:41] me, but I I try not to. I notice I list
[49:44] the tape sometime. Brother Brandham got
[49:45] the same way. But I try that's not an
[49:48] excuse. I try not to get that way. Uh
[49:50] because I don't want to be like that
[49:52] because my heart really cries out for
[49:54] those people. Yes. My heart really goes
[49:57] out to see the the degradation of the
[49:59] sin of the world. You know, uh it it's
[50:02] tough to recognize, but when you see in
[50:05] the scripture, the last s the last
[50:07] place, the last country city that took a
[50:10] wholesale acceptance of that kind of sin
[50:13] was Sodom and Gomorrah. And you know
[50:15] what God did to that place, right? So it
[50:18] makes you sad to see. Amen. Uh uh the
[50:22] way the world is going on. But look what
[50:23] he said now. 24th verse. But a woman a
[50:27] woman but but a woman when she is in
[50:31] travail have
[50:33] sorrow because her hour is come. And and
[50:36] I believe that's kind of a lot the way
[50:38] that we've got. I I I kind of identify
[50:40] myself that way. Uh I'm not sure about
[50:43] you. I've said this many times. I I
[50:45] didn't just come to this epiphany,
[50:47] friends. I've said this several times
[50:48] behind this pullpit that uh that when we
[50:52] recognize the joyousness and the
[50:54] happiness of being here at this time
[50:57] during this glorious occasion of the
[51:00] coming of the word and the coming of the
[51:01] Lord and the rapture is a wonderful time
[51:04] to be alive. Amen. But but didn't
[51:08] realize not realizing I guess also how
[51:12] horrible it was going to have to get and
[51:15] how bad the world was going to be during
[51:17] that period of time. And that part of it
[51:20] is is hard. It's sorrowful. It it it it
[51:25] pulls on you. It pulls on me so much. I
[51:28] think about how great a time that we
[51:30] live in. Yes. But think about what I
[51:33] see. It's just like Malachi when brother
[51:36] the prophecy of brother Brandham coming
[51:38] of the of the great and dreadful day.
[51:43] Amen. You recognize in Malachi he he
[51:46] described it perfectly with the two-fold
[51:49] understanding that it is a great day.
[51:52] Absolutely. It is a wonderful day. It is
[51:54] a precious day that we live in and
[51:57] looking and longing for the rapture.
[51:59] enjoying the message, the return of the
[52:01] word and the revelation of the word that
[52:03] we enjoy and the rapture that we're
[52:05] about to go in. But it's a dreadful day
[52:07] as well. It's a horrible, dreadful day
[52:10] when you look out and see the condition
[52:12] of the world and the condition of the
[52:13] people.
[52:15] Darkness and gross darkness. Horrible.
[52:18] And it grieavves. It should grieve. If
[52:21] you have a righteous, if you have the
[52:22] Holy Ghost, your righteous soul is
[52:24] grieved daily. Amen. It's grieved daily.
[52:28] And that's the sorrowful part. And when
[52:30] a woman comes to that place, and we're
[52:32] right to that edge, we're right to that
[52:34] point. As Jesus said, when she comes to
[52:38] that hour, because she's at that hour
[52:41] because her hour has come. We are at
[52:43] that hour, saints. We This is that hour.
[52:46] I believe this is the hour. This is the
[52:49] time of the coming of the Lord. I have
[52:51] no doubt about that. Amen. None
[52:54] whatsoever. And if it goes another 10
[52:57] years, it won't change that at all.
[53:00] Amen. You know, brother Random said that
[53:03] in in uh uh 70 60 70 years ago, he said
[53:07] the same thing. He said it could no he
[53:09] said it could go another hundred years
[53:11] and not change one thing. Amen. But I
[53:15] believe and I've said I said this a
[53:18] couple weeks ago. I personally believe
[53:21] that the Lord's going to come before
[53:23] this presence out of office.
[53:25] That's my feeling. Just take it with
[53:28] that. Uh that's my own personal opinion.
[53:31] Has nothing to do with scripture,
[53:33] anything brother Brandham said. That's
[53:35] just a personal feeling that I have.
[53:37] Amen. With what we've seen happen and
[53:40] the new pope and things that's going on.
[53:42] And uh that's just my personal opinion.
[53:45] Amen. Because you if you study the
[53:47] scripture and what brother Brandham said
[53:49] about it and how this time was going to
[53:50] be, I don't I don't see it being any any
[53:55] closer to that time than with this new
[53:57] pope and with this president. I just
[53:59] don't I don't see it. Right. If it is,
[54:01] it may be fine. That's up to the Lord.
[54:04] Amen. I definitely don't see another
[54:06] pope. Uh we discussed that the other
[54:09] day, but uh that's just my personal
[54:11] opinion. But personally, I we are
[54:13] regardless we are at that hour, right?
[54:16] We are at that hour there. I'm sure in
[54:18] this room there is no debate to that.
[54:21] You could probably go out on the street
[54:22] and survey people and I bet a lot of
[54:24] people that would talk to you would say
[54:26] the same thing. Amen. I I I don't know
[54:29] that. I've not done that. But I would
[54:31] say they probably would. Amen. Because
[54:33] to look at the things that's going on.
[54:36] So we're at that time. Jesus said the
[54:38] woman when she's in trevail has sorrow
[54:40] when she's in travail because her hour
[54:43] has come that hour's here. Amen. But as
[54:46] soon as she is delivered of the child,
[54:49] she rememberth no more the anguish for
[54:52] the joy that a man is born into the
[54:54] world. Praise God. Amen. So you see the
[54:59] things that's happening today, not just
[55:01] with us. Now, I've spent 10 minutes
[55:04] talking about us and talking about the
[55:06] bride and the way that people and
[55:08] humanity is going and what we see and
[55:11] how we see it going. But what about the
[55:14] nature creation? Because all of creation
[55:18] is doing what? Groaning. Amen.
[55:21] Travailing. What did brother Dennis say
[55:23] in his prayer?
[55:24] Even having no idea I was going to say
[55:27] this, what did he say in his prayer? You
[55:30] look around and see even science will
[55:33] tell you that things are happening now
[55:35] that they haven't seen in their time in
[55:37] their generation. The earth underneath
[55:40] people is moving frantically. Volcanoes
[55:43] in places and uh earthquakes in
[55:46] different places. I was we were just
[55:49] back east and found out of course I knew
[55:51] it but it became a topic of conversation
[55:54] back there that back even in Virginia in
[55:56] the hills in North Carolina and around
[55:59] got a rumbling earthquake in different
[56:02] places in diver places. I've never heard
[56:05] of that before that that in my lifetime
[56:08] and I'm almost 60 that I know of has
[56:11] ever happened. Right. We've had them
[56:13] right here in in in Arizona. How many
[56:15] earthquakes have you in Tucson maybe
[56:18] your whole life or most your how many
[56:19] earthquakes have you felt yet it's going
[56:22] on? You say, "Well, California is
[56:25] supposed to get a big one." Yes, they
[56:26] are. But there's earthquakes. It doesn't
[56:30] mention it. Micah has a I guess you
[56:33] still has the app. He had an app on his
[56:35] phone that detected the earthquakes
[56:36] around the world. There's earthquakes
[56:38] every single day in California, right?
[56:41] Multiples of them every day. They're
[56:43] twos and threes and most time people
[56:45] don't feel them. They might even feel
[56:47] them, but they're in California and if
[56:48] they've lived with it, they probably
[56:49] don't even know it's anything less than
[56:51] a six, right?
[56:54] Or
[56:55] care that anything less than a six
[56:57] magnitude, but it's it's shaking.
[57:00] Everything around is shaking. The earth
[57:02] is in birth pains. The earth, all of
[57:05] creation, this earth is middle is in the
[57:08] middle of birth pains because this earth
[57:09] is getting ready to purge itself. This
[57:12] earth is getting ready to purge itself
[57:14] to the point that all sin will be
[57:17] completely annihilated.
[57:19] Even even brother Brandham said into the
[57:22] atmospheres, right? Not just even here
[57:25] on this earth on this uh uh this ball of
[57:28] dirt we live on, but even into the
[57:31] atmospheres. All sin and all of that
[57:34] will be completely annihilated. This
[57:37] earth will change and belch and move and
[57:40] explode and it it'll change things. Of
[57:42] course, we'll be gone. Amen. The bride
[57:44] will be gone and she'll be in her home
[57:47] uh at the wedding supper, but it's going
[57:49] to belch and it's going to But we
[57:51] already see it
[57:52] happening. When the hour comes and you
[57:56] see what's taking place, what happens
[57:58] when a mo most of you in here know
[58:01] because you probably have been through
[58:02] it. But what happens when a woman gets
[58:05] to that place? Right. Amen. We We did
[58:08] it. We did it three times. I I I know
[58:11] what it's like. And my wife is very well
[58:14] knows what it's like. Your sisters have
[58:16] had children. You very well know what
[58:18] it's like when you come to that place.
[58:20] When you come to that time, Amen.
[58:22] There's a lot of stuff going on. There's
[58:25] a lot of movement. There's a lot of
[58:26] changing. Uh water begins to break and
[58:30] babies begin to start coming forth and
[58:32] they say, you know, you know, just hold
[58:34] it back. It doesn't work that way. Uh
[58:38] you can tell that baby to go back in all
[58:40] you want, but that doesn't work like
[58:42] that. Amen. When it comes time, it comes
[58:45] time. That baby is coming whether you
[58:47] wanted to or not. Right? And God has a
[58:51] decreed time of what? Of when this is
[58:54] going to be over. For when this br when
[58:56] the leather Christ will rise and when
[58:58] this bride will come together and we'll
[59:00] be together for a minimum of 40 days and
[59:03] we'll all go and meet the Lord in the
[59:04] air and the rapture and so shall we ever
[59:07] be with the Lord. We'll be at the
[59:08] wedding supper. The tribulation will
[59:10] will set in upon this planet and it'll
[59:13] bulch belch and it'll change and all the
[59:17] atmosphere everything will explode
[59:19] because it's in the all of creation all
[59:22] of creation is
[59:24] groaning
[59:26] travailing in pain waiting for this
[59:30] time. And we're at that time s Yes.
[59:32] Amen. We're at that time and all of this
[59:36] is going on one day. One day very soon
[59:38] is going to be turned to joy. I'm going
[59:41] to see my dad come up. He's either going
[59:42] to meet me here, which I see him so many
[59:45] times. Uh I expect to meet them here or
[59:48] my mom. Uh my sister, my son. Amen. My
[59:52] son will probably go to my wife though.
[59:55] You know how a boy is with his mother.
[59:56] So he'll probably go to her first. But
[59:59] my mom, my dad, I'm looking forward for
[1:00:01] my loved ones to come and appear. I went
[1:00:03] and saw while we were on the trip a few
[1:00:06] stones that memorialize their life and
[1:00:09] uh where their remains were laid. And we
[1:00:12] I took some pictures and I cleaned the
[1:00:14] stuff up. The church there doesn't do
[1:00:16] their footstones anymore, so they just
[1:00:18] grow over. I had to clean them all up
[1:00:19] and get all that stuff off of there and
[1:00:21] took some pictures and all. And that's
[1:00:23] just a memorial. But one day we'll see
[1:00:26] them again.
[1:00:28] Amen. And in my opinion, friend, my
[1:00:31] personal opinion, again, this is only my
[1:00:34] opinion, there'll be no more souls saved
[1:00:36] after that point. Yes. That's my
[1:00:38] opinion. Amen. Now, we know there's got
[1:00:41] to be a time. We know according to the
[1:00:42] scripture, according to the message,
[1:00:44] there's got to be a time when we're
[1:00:46] still here, but no one else can come in
[1:00:49] or out of the boat. Brother Ram typed
[1:00:50] that with knowing the ark, right? Amen.
[1:00:52] They come knocking on the said, "Let us
[1:00:54] in." No, God shut the door. I can't let
[1:00:56] you in. Right. Amen. And they still
[1:00:58] hadn't rained. It was seven more days
[1:01:00] before it rained. Yes. The judgment
[1:01:02] hadn't fallen on them yet. There was no
[1:01:05] rain yet, but there was nobody else
[1:01:08] could get in or out of that ark, right?
[1:01:10] It was over. Amen. At that point, even
[1:01:12] though judgment had not come yet, it was
[1:01:15] over. Praise the Lord. I believe when
[1:01:17] the dead in Christ rise and begin to
[1:01:20] appear, it'll be over. It be over. Amen.
[1:01:22] That's my opinion. Amen. I I hope surely
[1:01:25] maybe you can understand why or how I
[1:01:27] came to that opinion, but it's still
[1:01:30] just my opinion. Amen. But it will be
[1:01:32] that time. But we're at that point, s
[1:01:35] we're at that point. I'm look I'm
[1:01:36] looking at any moment, any time. Amen.
[1:01:39] For this to happen. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:41] Until it does, I keep planting my
[1:01:43] potatoes. Right. I keep serving. I keep
[1:01:46] working. I keep uh giving my life to the
[1:01:48] Lord. All that I can do for him, I do
[1:01:50] while I'm here. Amen. But the whole
[1:01:52] earth, look, the whole earth is
[1:01:54] travailing. The whole earth is in pains,
[1:01:57] groaning, waiting for that time in that
[1:02:00] time of birth pains. It's about to bring
[1:02:02] forth something, saints. Amen. And this
[1:02:04] place is going to go back to the way it
[1:02:06] was. It's going to go back to that
[1:02:08] perfection it was when God originally
[1:02:10] created it and put man here and put
[1:02:13] animals here and put botney life here.
[1:02:16] is going to be exactly the perfection
[1:02:18] that God and we're going to come back
[1:02:20] here and live on it eventually. Amen.
[1:02:23] Praise the Lord. That's why he's getting
[1:02:24] it all prepared because God didn't just
[1:02:27] God didn't just shed his blood for the
[1:02:29] life of that blood to come back in the
[1:02:30] Holy Spirit into you. But the chemistry
[1:02:32] of that blood dripped down upon the
[1:02:34] ground to redeem it back from when it
[1:02:36] was lost and back into God's possession
[1:02:39] again. Right. Amen. So, the chemistry of
[1:02:41] the blood did play a did play a part and
[1:02:43] it was to redeem this earth back from
[1:02:46] it's still in the hands of Satan.
[1:02:48] Satan's Eden, but it belongs to God.
[1:02:51] Amen. God redeemed it back. It belongs
[1:02:53] to him. And this is where we will live
[1:02:55] one day. Amen. We talked about that.
[1:02:58] Went through the future home. But let's
[1:03:00] read this here now in birth
[1:03:04] pains. Amen. 1965 January. Now she she
[1:03:09] who she she who the earth the earth she
[1:03:13] now she she knows that her time of
[1:03:16] deliverance is at hand.
[1:03:19] That's the reason she's so nervous,
[1:03:21] frustrated as she is is because that
[1:03:24] there is a hydrogen bomb. We'll say
[1:03:26] nuclear bomb now. Amen. here 60 years
[1:03:31] later. Uh there's a nuclear bomb and
[1:03:34] missiles of the air that could destroy
[1:03:37] the whole world. One nation is scared of
[1:03:40] the other. No matter how little it is,
[1:03:42] they got those missiles and they claim
[1:03:44] it with just one of these. They can just
[1:03:46] direct it by the stars and drop it
[1:03:48] anywhere in the world they want to. Now,
[1:03:50] we've seen that happen now. Yeah. They
[1:03:53] he talked about it here in the hydrogen
[1:03:56] bomb. But now what have they got to the
[1:03:59] point that they can pinpoint where a
[1:04:01] bomb is going to drop to the to the very
[1:04:04] to the very point that you could
[1:04:07] literally if a person stood still drop
[1:04:10] it on the apex of their skull if they
[1:04:12] wanted to. Amen. Look at look at Elon
[1:04:15] Musk and the SpaceX. I mean, we just
[1:04:20] don't He just doesn't shoot rockets up
[1:04:22] in the air now and just let them explode
[1:04:23] and fall in the ocean. He shoots them up
[1:04:26] in the air and he guides him to come and
[1:04:28] brings them right back to exactly a pos
[1:04:31] a specific position on the earth and an
[1:04:33] arm reaches out and grabs it and sets it
[1:04:35] right on the ground.
[1:04:37] Amen. Amen. Now, what was Brother Bam
[1:04:40] talking about 60 years ago? Amen. He
[1:04:43] talked about this pinpoint dropping.
[1:04:46] They got these missiles he says directed
[1:04:49] by the stars we know call we now call it
[1:04:51] GPS drop them anywhere in the world they
[1:04:54] want to you think about that and worried
[1:04:56] about worried about the littlest things
[1:04:58] like like North Korea and and Iran and
[1:05:01] and these types they don't worry me amen
[1:05:05] but I see where they're worry of the
[1:05:07] world or our politics our government I I
[1:05:10] see where they're a worry they fight and
[1:05:13] talk about all the time oh we want to
[1:05:14] make sure we don't get uh we don't let
[1:05:17] Iran get uh uh uh the enrichment what is
[1:05:22] it uh uranium they don't want to enrich
[1:05:26] your because they become a nuclear
[1:05:30] country that I I understand that friends
[1:05:33] but all this is already set in motion
[1:05:36] there's nothing you can do to stop it
[1:05:38] right amen prophecy a prophet talked
[1:05:41] about this 60 years ago and to me he's
[1:05:45] talking about what's going on there. But
[1:05:46] to me, this is much a prophecy as it is
[1:05:49] a quote, right? Because of what we know
[1:05:52] is going on right now today. What has
[1:05:54] happened in all of that GPS that we know
[1:05:58] of now that he there had was no idea of
[1:06:01] that here then. But the Lord was using a
[1:06:04] man to minister a Lord. The Lord was
[1:06:06] using a man to preach the word to bring
[1:06:08] forth things like this that now we can
[1:06:11] look at and say, "Well, of course."
[1:06:14] Amen. Makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?
[1:06:17] Russia, as I heard on the news the other
[1:06:20] day, she claims that she can destroy
[1:06:22] this nation. Now, you notice how brother
[1:06:24] Brandham always referred to Russia. But
[1:06:26] when brother Brandham was here, it was
[1:06:28] not Russia. It was the Soviet Union. It
[1:06:32] was the
[1:06:34] USSR. Russia was just a little town, a
[1:06:37] city in this big
[1:06:40] huge Russian government.
[1:06:44] the Soviet Union. That's what it was. It
[1:06:46] wasn't Russia. Russia be didn't become
[1:06:49] Russia till brother Brandham was already
[1:06:51] gone. But when you read it, all the
[1:06:54] quotes, he doesn't talk about the Soviet
[1:06:56] Union. He always calls Russia Russia.
[1:07:00] Amen. And Russia was just a city in the
[1:07:02] Soviet Union. Right. Amen. Again, to me,
[1:07:05] as much prophecy it is as it is a quote.
[1:07:08] Amen. Russia. Russia. As I heard on the
[1:07:11] news the other day, she claims that she
[1:07:13] can destroy this nation and keep the
[1:07:16] atoms or the things from breaking up her
[1:07:18] nation. We don't know what it'll do
[1:07:21] about that. Everyone is making these
[1:07:22] claims. It is so people's science has
[1:07:26] broke into God's great laboratory until
[1:07:29] they're going to destroy themselves.
[1:07:32] Right. That's exactly right, friend. And
[1:07:34] it's happening.
[1:07:36] We see it happening already now.
[1:07:39] destroying themselves. What just
[1:07:42] happened here a few years ago? We called
[1:07:44] it co. Amen. Where did it come from?
[1:07:47] Well, now they've come with all the lies
[1:07:49] and stuff, they finally come to the
[1:07:51] point that
[1:07:52] even the staunchest deniers are saying,
[1:07:56] "We believe it came from a lab in
[1:07:59] China." How many people did it say it
[1:08:02] killed? They claim it killed. I I don't
[1:08:04] necessarily believe those claims, but I
[1:08:06] don't believe hardly anything the
[1:08:07] government says anymore. Anyway, but um
[1:08:10] and I sure don't believe China or
[1:08:12] Russia. Those people are godless
[1:08:15] heathens that don't know anything about
[1:08:16] the truth or care that they're telling
[1:08:18] you the truth or keeping their word or
[1:08:19] anything else. People science broken
[1:08:22] into God's great laboratory and they're
[1:08:24] going to destroy themselves. God always
[1:08:28] lets wisdom destroy himself. God doesn't
[1:08:31] destroy anything. Man destroys himself
[1:08:33] by wisdom as he did in the beginning.
[1:08:36] Taking the Satan's wisdom instead of the
[1:08:38] word of God. Amen. Destroy themselves.
[1:08:41] What has it got now? Destroying
[1:08:43] themselves. People just as much now.
[1:08:45] Destroying themselves as they are
[1:08:48] helping themselves. Amen. They We got
[1:08:51] what they say better medicine than
[1:08:53] they've ever had. And that's true. I say
[1:08:56] ever have. Maybe there was a time in
[1:08:58] history, maybe the antivian world. But
[1:09:00] now in our our our our our
[1:09:03] uh current world, medicine's greater now
[1:09:07] than it's ever been.
[1:09:09] And thank God for it. I mean, Brother
[1:09:12] Dennis is talking about getting another
[1:09:13] knee replacement, and they're saying you
[1:09:16] can replace a man's knee without
[1:09:20] surgery.
[1:09:22] Yeah.
[1:09:24] take a whole knee out of your body, put
[1:09:27] a whole manufactured knee in, and send
[1:09:30] you home. Right?
[1:09:33] I mean, that just blows my mind. How How
[1:09:36] does that happen? How do you do that?
[1:09:38] Right? But it's greater now than it's
[1:09:40] ever been. And what kind of a place that
[1:09:42] we live in today now? Worse than it's
[1:09:45] ever been. We're more prosperous than
[1:09:47] we've ever been. And I I I never seen
[1:09:50] you I've never seen homelessness the way
[1:09:52] it is today. Yeah. Amen. And we're the
[1:09:55] greatest nation on earth, most
[1:09:57] prosperous nation in the history of the
[1:09:59] world. And we got more homelessness and
[1:10:02] poverty and degradation than we've ever
[1:10:04] had in my lifetime.
[1:10:08] So, is it good or is it bad?
[1:10:11] Amen. I'm trying to tell you, friend,
[1:10:12] the whole creation, it it's groaning,
[1:10:15] travailing. We think we got it made. We
[1:10:18] think it's good. Amen. That that we got
[1:10:21] computers that are so tiny we can carry
[1:10:24] them around with us. Is that a blessing
[1:10:26] or a curse? You know, when I got lost
[1:10:29] going to one street in Boston, it was a
[1:10:31] blessing cuz I got on my phone. We got
[1:10:34] to go this way. We got to go that way.
[1:10:36] Amen. I could You could do it with a
[1:10:38] math though, too. Just as good. But it
[1:10:40] makes you
[1:10:41] wonder. It's like brother Bam talked
[1:10:44] about television. He said it could have
[1:10:45] been a blessing. Amen. Made it a curse.
[1:10:47] Right. Amen.
[1:10:50] So what is all of this brought us to?
[1:10:53] Man is killing themselves. We are
[1:10:56] killing ourselves. Yes.
[1:10:59] Amen. Our our I I I I can't say that I
[1:11:04] know
[1:11:05] emphatically, but some precious friends
[1:11:08] of ours, the carpenters up in the
[1:11:10] mountain, who sister Dorothy is uh her
[1:11:13] mother. Uh Ron and um Carol Carol, thank
[1:11:17] you. Uh their daughter Heather passed
[1:11:21] away. She had a brain tumor.
[1:11:25] Golblasto. I come to find out later that
[1:11:28] she slept every night with this thing
[1:11:30] under her
[1:11:32] pillow. Every
[1:11:34] night. Now I I'm not a doctor. I'm not a
[1:11:37] scientist. I'm not here to prove
[1:11:39] anything or disprove anything. just
[1:11:42] seems a a little too coincidental to me
[1:11:46] with all the waves and stuff that come
[1:11:48] into these things and the energy it
[1:11:49] produces and all that it didn't have
[1:11:52] something to do with that. I don't know.
[1:11:54] Yeah.
[1:11:56] Are we making ourselves better? Are we
[1:11:59] making ourselves
[1:12:01] worse? The wisdom that we've come up
[1:12:04] with, I I I I fail to find any time or
[1:12:08] almost any time where it's helped us
[1:12:12] I've asked
[1:12:14] friends I I've asked friends for years
[1:12:18] now who talk about this day and and all
[1:12:22] the things that we have and all the
[1:12:24] conveniences and you you think oh it was
[1:12:27] it was a wonderful thing that man
[1:12:29] invented the car now we can go across
[1:12:31] and do this and that and the other and
[1:12:33] now and now they're saying that's one of
[1:12:35] the most horrible inventions because the
[1:12:37] O2 in the
[1:12:38] is destroyed the ozone layer and uh and
[1:12:42] global warming and climate change and
[1:12:44] whatever else.
[1:12:46] So, was it good or bad?
[1:12:52] It just to me it it's it's just human
[1:12:56] and it's wisdom bringing it bringing us
[1:13:00] to this ultimate place where as brother
[1:13:02] Brandham said our wisdom is killing us
[1:13:05] right and our human worldly man wisdom
[1:13:10] will destroy us. It'll destroy man one
[1:13:12] day. And I believe that. It will. We
[1:13:16] won't be we'll we'll go in a rapture,
[1:13:18] but this world is going to come into its
[1:13:21] tribulation place to where the beast
[1:13:23] takes over and it's nothing but chaos,
[1:13:27] right? Amen. Death and death, blood to
[1:13:30] the horse's bridal, friend. So, we're
[1:13:33] looking at the time, but now we're at
[1:13:35] but now we're at that place where the
[1:13:37] earth is churning. It's it's groaning.
[1:13:40] is travailing. Amen. It's it's it's it's
[1:13:43] burnt pains. Amen. It's about to bring
[1:13:46] forth what it used to be, the perfection
[1:13:49] that it used to be. I'm not saying it's
[1:13:51] going to be exactly the way God had
[1:13:53] originally created it. It might be, but
[1:13:56] I know it's going to go back to its
[1:13:58] perfect condition like it was then for
[1:14:01] the human, for the animal, for the
[1:14:03] botney life. Amen. For God's children,
[1:14:06] it's going to be perfect. Amen. No
[1:14:10] sin, no death, right? No lying, no no
[1:14:14] cheating, no it's going to be perfect.
[1:14:17] Amen. Praise God. I've heard people I've
[1:14:20] heard people say before or Reddit or
[1:14:22] something, "Oh, what? That sounds boring
[1:14:24] to me." I said, "Well, then go to the
[1:14:26] other place." Yeah,
[1:14:28] that's your other choice. That's right.
[1:14:30] Go to hell and see how much you enjoy it
[1:14:32] then.
[1:14:35] I mean, they just think hell's going to
[1:14:37] be full of a bunch of bars and stuff
[1:14:39] like that. That That's Well, I'm just
[1:14:42] going to live it up. You know, it does.
[1:14:43] That's not That's not the way it's going
[1:14:46] to be. That's right. Amen. Amen. Well,
[1:14:48] how do you convince somebody that's got
[1:14:49] it in their mind? Let's go over to First
[1:14:51] John
[1:14:55] now. It's time of deliverance, saints,
[1:14:57] is at hand. Amen. And the world knows
[1:15:00] it's time of deliverance is at hand. How
[1:15:02] does the world know? You think this
[1:15:05] earth doesn't have any
[1:15:06] intelligence? You think that the body
[1:15:09] life it doesn't have any intelligence?
[1:15:10] Animals may have limited intelligence.
[1:15:13] How does the world know? How would the
[1:15:15] world know that it's coming to that
[1:15:17] place that it's that it knows it
[1:15:19] deliverances. How would it know that?
[1:15:22] Because it was created by God. That's
[1:15:24] right. That's how it knows. Because the
[1:15:27] one that set it in space, the one that
[1:15:29] sent it out spinning in this orbit is
[1:15:31] the one who created it, is the one who
[1:15:33] put it in its place, is the one who
[1:15:35] governs it. Amen. And it knows by that
[1:15:39] because it's what God put in them to do.
[1:15:42] You say, how does a how does a a female
[1:15:44] dog know that it's in heat, that it that
[1:15:47] it hunts for a male dog or something to
[1:15:49] reproduce? How does it know that? It was
[1:15:52] created by God. God put it in them to
[1:15:55] know what to do, how to do. Amen. That's
[1:15:58] how it know because it was created by
[1:16:00] God the Almighty. First John chapter 3,
[1:16:04] I'm going to read a couple of
[1:16:07] verses. Behold, what manner of love
[1:16:10] because we're finishing up now the
[1:16:12] manifest manifested sons of God. All
[1:16:15] creation. Now, let's just finish this
[1:16:17] part of it up. Behold, what manner of
[1:16:19] love the Father has bestowed upon us,
[1:16:21] that we should be called the sons of
[1:16:25] God. Therefore, the world knoweth us
[1:16:27] not, because it knew him not. Now, not
[1:16:30] the world, not the world uh earth, but
[1:16:33] the world cosmos, the world order,
[1:16:36] right?
[1:16:38] It doesn't know
[1:16:39] him. The world itself knows of him more
[1:16:43] than the world cosmos does.
[1:16:46] Beloved, now now are we the sons of God,
[1:16:50] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:16:53] be, but we know that when he shall
[1:16:56] appear, we shall be like him, for we
[1:16:59] shall see him as he is. What is he? He's
[1:17:02] the word. We see him in this last day
[1:17:04] because he's appeared. He's appeared to
[1:17:07] us to show us he is the word. Christ is
[1:17:10] the word. Amen. Amen. And we know that
[1:17:12] we shall be like
[1:17:14] him, which makes us what?
[1:17:18] The word. Amen. Because we know him as
[1:17:20] he is, which is the word. The word.
[1:17:24] Amen. We know him as he is. So this is
[1:17:27] this scripture actually has a a two-fold
[1:17:30] meaning. Appear is the same as manifest.
[1:17:33] Of course, it does not yet appear what
[1:17:35] we shall be or manifest, but when he
[1:17:37] shall manifest. And we know he has
[1:17:40] manifest himself because he's opened
[1:17:42] himself before us. He took this book. He
[1:17:46] open took the seals. He opened the book
[1:17:49] and revealed it to us. Now we can see as
[1:17:52] the Holy Spirit shows us this open book
[1:17:55] and reveals to us what is in it. There's
[1:17:58] no hidden mystery. Amen. There is
[1:18:01] nothing left that God is withholding
[1:18:03] from his bride. Not that we that we
[1:18:05] would need. Obviously, there's things
[1:18:07] cuz he's an infinite almighty God.
[1:18:09] There's things that we'll be learning
[1:18:10] out through eternity that we don't know
[1:18:13] now. But as far as in this earth, what
[1:18:16] we need now, what we're looking for now,
[1:18:18] and what we need to get us beyond this
[1:18:20] mortal reach, we have, it's not a
[1:18:23] mystery. It's not something we grow to.
[1:18:27] We We know God has revealed it to us. We
[1:18:30] see him as he is. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[1:18:33] Lord. He's the revealed word. We shall
[1:18:36] be or manifest. Manifest what? Sons and
[1:18:40] daughters of God. Manifest to what he
[1:18:44] is, which is the word. Amen. Praise the
[1:18:47] Lord. Not a letter of a word as a lot of
[1:18:50] people would try to say that. No. Amen.
[1:18:54] This is just a book with words.
[1:18:57] Amen. Is inspired of God. God wrote it.
[1:19:01] Amen. But Christ is not a word that you
[1:19:05] literally have on a piece of paper. He's
[1:19:08] a spirit that brings the word to
[1:19:12] life. It's the same as what it used to
[1:19:14] be years ago. Even probably maybe as I
[1:19:18] was being born or before I was born. A
[1:19:20] man was a man was only as good as his
[1:19:23] word. Word. Amen. You didn't have
[1:19:27] contracts that thick to buy a car. You
[1:19:30] had a handshake. and a promise. Amen.
[1:19:33] Man is only as good as his word. Brother
[1:19:36] Brandham talked about having that debt
[1:19:38] that he had to pay off. And he went and
[1:19:40] told him said, "I'll pay you. I'll pay
[1:19:42] it off. Even if I can't give you a a
[1:19:45] quarter a week or a month, I'll tell
[1:19:47] you. If I can't pay you anything, I'll
[1:19:49] let you know." Amen. I've been there,
[1:19:52] done that. I know. He said, "By the
[1:19:55] grace of God, I paid every bit off." By
[1:19:57] the grace of God, I can say the same
[1:19:58] thing. Paid every bit off. Amen. Praise
[1:20:01] the Lord. Sometimes I didn't have any to
[1:20:03] give, but by God's grace, he a was able
[1:20:06] to pay it all off. It's like brother
[1:20:08] Brandham said, see, by by God's grace, I
[1:20:10] was able to pay it all off. Amen.
[1:20:13] Because God's the one that takes care of
[1:20:14] that. But we but we recognize as God is
[1:20:17] a spirit. Amen. Christ is a spirit. The
[1:20:21] word just comes revealed to us. Amen.
[1:20:25] This word is not just words on a page
[1:20:27] anymore. If this if this book look for
[1:20:31] each of us, if this book was to taken
[1:20:34] out of your hands and never be never for
[1:20:37] you to touch it again for the rest of
[1:20:39] your natural life, would that change
[1:20:41] anything?
[1:20:43] I mean, you would miss being able to
[1:20:44] have it and read it. Right. But if you
[1:20:48] become the word, you don't need this
[1:20:50] book. Right. Right. Amen. I mean, we do
[1:20:54] need it. Don't get me wrong. We do need
[1:20:56] it. I'm just saying if it was taken from
[1:20:59] you and you never could touch it again,
[1:21:02] it's just like the dark ages. Those
[1:21:05] people weren't allowed to touch the
[1:21:06] Bible. They weren't allowed to have it
[1:21:08] or read it. They were only supposed to
[1:21:10] listen to what the priest told them. If
[1:21:12] they could in any way or their children
[1:21:15] could in any way recite portions of the
[1:21:18] Bible, the biatitudes or whatever the
[1:21:20] Lord's prayer, they were killed, put to
[1:21:22] death, because they weren't allowed to
[1:21:24] do it. But that didn't change who they
[1:21:26] were. They were still bride, right?
[1:21:29] Amen. And they didn't have the the the
[1:21:32] the opportunity that we have to have
[1:21:35] actually read it and let that word come
[1:21:38] alive in
[1:21:40] us. It was just the Holy Spirit in them.
[1:21:44] Praise the Lord. So if there was a time
[1:21:46] where you could never have this book
[1:21:48] again, right? You're still the written
[1:21:50] epistles read of all men. Yes. You're
[1:21:53] still the living word because Christ is
[1:21:56] in you. Praise the Lord. That doesn't
[1:22:00] make him a book. That makes him a living
[1:22:02] spirit.
[1:22:04] That makes you the same thing. Because
[1:22:07] we've seen him as he is, right? And
[1:22:10] that's how that manifestation of the
[1:22:13] sons of God become. It's a then we know
[1:22:18] now that we are the sons of God. But
[1:22:20] look what's happening, friend.
[1:22:22] All this is evolving. All this is
[1:22:24] changing. We're at this time. Amen.
[1:22:28] We're at this time. Amen. We're This is
[1:22:30] being finished off. Amen. First
[1:22:33] Corinthians. Let me try to finish
[1:22:40] this. Amen. Christ is a spirit.
[1:22:44] Amen. We know he's the word. Absolutely.
[1:22:47] Because he's as good as his word. What
[1:22:49] he says is who he is. Like I said, it
[1:22:52] used to be that way with us, with
[1:22:53] humans. What we said is what we were. If
[1:22:57] I said something, I had to. I was going
[1:23:00] to do it to the best of my ability.
[1:23:01] Sometimes circumstances come up and
[1:23:04] change things like that, but that
[1:23:05] doesn't change who he is. Amen. Doesn't
[1:23:09] change who we are. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:12] First uh 1 Corinthians now chapter
[1:23:15] 11. Let's read the first first few
[1:23:17] verses here. I hope and pray that this
[1:23:20] book never gets taken away from us. So,
[1:23:24] amen. I would not want to have to do
[1:23:26] without it. But there may be a day we
[1:23:28] might have to. We don't know. Yes, might
[1:23:32] be. 1 Corinthians
[1:23:35] 11:17. Now, in this that I declare unto
[1:23:38] you, I praise you not that ye come
[1:23:42] together not for the better, but for the
[1:23:45] worse. Now, look, this is this is I
[1:23:48] didn't see this until just the other day
[1:23:52] when I was reading this. I praise you
[1:23:55] not that you come together not for the
[1:23:57] better, but for the
[1:23:59] worse. For first of all, when you come
[1:24:02] together in the church, I hear that
[1:24:04] there be divisions among you. And I
[1:24:07] partly believe it. Now look at his
[1:24:10] reasoning. Look what Paul's reasoning
[1:24:12] is. He says, "For there must be
[1:24:16] also heresies among
[1:24:19] you." Well, I always wonder what brother
[1:24:22] talked about three kind of believers.
[1:24:25] Well, it's right here. That's pretty
[1:24:27] much what Paul's talking about, right?
[1:24:29] He said, "I'll hardly believe it because
[1:24:31] there must be heresies among you. There
[1:24:34] must be heretics or
[1:24:36] unbelievers among you. There's got to be
[1:24:39] believers made believers unbelievers."
[1:24:42] Amen. Praise the Lord. I I I I challenge
[1:24:45] that now in this day with especially as
[1:24:48] smaller congregations as we have. Amen.
[1:24:51] But the word is still the word. Yeah.
[1:24:54] There must be heretics. There must be
[1:24:57] unbelief among you. Heresies among you
[1:25:00] that they which are approved may be made
[1:25:04] manifest among you. Now, what's that
[1:25:07] approved? Those that were approved. the
[1:25:09] ones that were
[1:25:10] approved. It it just it basically means
[1:25:14] it it shines light. It shines brighter
[1:25:16] in the light. Amen. Than the darkness.
[1:25:19] Yes. Unbelief is darkness. The word is
[1:25:23] light. Those that are approved shine
[1:25:26] brighter among the darkness. Look, it's
[1:25:29] what he's what he's saying. For those
[1:25:31] must must be heresies among you that
[1:25:33] they which are approved may be made
[1:25:36] manifest, may be made known among you.
[1:25:38] And what greater way is that to be
[1:25:40] revealed than what we see today going
[1:25:42] on. Friend, as as the world grows
[1:25:45] darker, the light that you shine becomes
[1:25:49] brighter. The shining light that you are
[1:25:51] is brighter because it's darker. Gross
[1:25:54] darkness the people. Amen. I could light
[1:25:57] a match in this room right now. You
[1:25:59] barely notice it. But if you if at night
[1:26:01] and the it's dark outside, you turn the
[1:26:03] lights off, you'd probably be able to
[1:26:06] see this whole room just from one match.
[1:26:08] Yeah. Amen. Because it's dark. That's
[1:26:11] why it's reprove. It's approved. See
[1:26:14] what it says? Approved. This word
[1:26:16] approved is
[1:26:18] accepted, pleasing, and acceptable to
[1:26:22] become acceptable. It goes on here in
[1:26:25] the Greek here about uh how they used to
[1:26:27] make coins and how they would forge
[1:26:30] these coins and then shave off the rough
[1:26:32] edges and cheaters got to where they rub
[1:26:35] off a lot of the edge because that meant
[1:26:39] that which made the the coin weight go
[1:26:41] below what it was to make it as valuable
[1:26:45] as it's supposed to be. Amen. But that's
[1:26:48] out before we got a dollar that meant
[1:26:50] absolutely nothing other than the fact
[1:26:52] that if I take it to the Circle K,
[1:26:54] they'll accept it for a candy bar. Uh it
[1:26:56] means nothing. That that money in my
[1:26:59] wallet means nothing. If if the world
[1:27:01] today decided and said, you know what,
[1:27:03] I'm not going to take your
[1:27:06] dollar. You have nothing. If you go to
[1:27:09] Circle K and they said, "No, we're only
[1:27:10] going to take Bitcoin. I don't have
[1:27:12] Bitcoin. I got a million dollars in
[1:27:13] cash. No, no good. Don't want that
[1:27:15] anymore. That's just an example. It
[1:27:18] means nothing. A dollar means nothing.
[1:27:20] But see, there used to be a raw
[1:27:21] material, gold, silver, whatever it was
[1:27:24] that they made coins out of. And the
[1:27:25] weight of the coin determined the amount
[1:27:27] of the coin. So when you shave the edge
[1:27:30] of the coin off, you shave part of the
[1:27:33] weight off of the coin. Well, the
[1:27:34] cheaters would keep shaving and shaving
[1:27:37] and shave off the corners to where it
[1:27:39] was less weight than what it was
[1:27:40] supposed to be. So they take a whole
[1:27:42] bunch of shavings from like 10 other
[1:27:43] coins and make a whole another coin.
[1:27:45] Yeah, those were cheaters. But then it
[1:27:49] said that there were people, men of
[1:27:50] integrity who would not accept
[1:27:53] counterfeit money. There were men of
[1:27:55] honor who were uh who who put only
[1:27:59] genuine full weighted money into
[1:28:02] circulation. These men were called damas
[1:28:05] or approved. They were approved. those
[1:28:08] that were honest, those that were
[1:28:10] reputable, those that would men in of
[1:28:13] integrity that would only allow the
[1:28:15] proper coin to go into circulation. If
[1:28:18] it got shaved down beyond what it should
[1:28:20] be for the weight of that coin, then it
[1:28:22] was considered counterfeit. It was no
[1:28:24] good, right? Amen. Had to be reforged
[1:28:26] and re uh reut into circulation. Amen.
[1:28:31] But approved. See, now if it's approved,
[1:28:35] if it's if it's someone that's been like
[1:28:37] like he said here, approved among or
[1:28:41] accepted, those those I would believe
[1:28:43] would be the
[1:28:44] believer. And the believer becomes more
[1:28:48] manifest because of the
[1:28:51] unbeliever, because of the heresy. And
[1:28:53] that's what Paul's saying. So those that
[1:28:56] are approved, those that are
[1:28:59] acceptable, their light shines greater
[1:29:01] the darker that the that the world gets,
[1:29:04] the darker things get, they become more
[1:29:06] manifest. So the manifestation of the
[1:29:09] sons of God becomes more bright, more
[1:29:12] more light, brighter in in a in a
[1:29:17] darkened world. Right? So as so as the
[1:29:20] world is dark and gross darkness the
[1:29:22] people in the evening time the light
[1:29:24] shines and the light is brighter than
[1:29:26] it's ever been but of of the approved of
[1:29:29] those that are acceptable by God. Those
[1:29:32] are the manifested sons of God. Those
[1:29:35] are the approved approved the ones that
[1:29:37] are those that are acceptable by God.
[1:29:40] Amen. That God approves of uh Ephesians
[1:29:45] 5:3. See, the darker it is, the brighter
[1:29:47] the light shines. Ephesians 5:3, "But
[1:29:50] fornication and all uncleanness or
[1:29:53] covetedness,
[1:29:55] uh, let it not be once named among you
[1:29:58] as becometh
[1:29:59] saints." Amen. Because why? The light
[1:30:03] shines in the
[1:30:05] darkness. The light shines shines the
[1:30:09] brightest in the darkness. the
[1:30:12] manifestation of the sons of God becomes
[1:30:15] more evident and becomes brighter, more
[1:30:18] apparent, more approved than than in any
[1:30:22] other age because there's never been a
[1:30:24] darker age as it been like this age. And
[1:30:27] the end of this age and the time that we
[1:30:29] live is the darkest time age period than
[1:30:33] we've
[1:30:34] had ever. I would say you say, "Well,
[1:30:37] the dark ages were bad." That was mostly
[1:30:40] physical. I'm talking spiritual. Yes.
[1:30:42] Amen. The spiritual was too because uh
[1:30:45] uh uh the the the Holy Spirit was bound
[1:30:48] at the door of creeds and dog was not
[1:30:50] allowed to move among the people. It was
[1:30:51] dark. We know the circles that brother
[1:30:53] Brandham drew that God drew. Amen. And
[1:30:56] the little bit of light that was in
[1:30:57] them. But
[1:30:58] remember there was a sliver of light
[1:31:01] during that time. Brother Brandham said
[1:31:04] that when it came across the sky, it was
[1:31:07] completely black.
[1:31:09] No light at all. But God allowed brother
[1:31:12] Random to put a sliver of light in this
[1:31:14] day because of the bride. Because of the
[1:31:16] approved. Amen. Amen. The manifested
[1:31:20] sons of God. Praise the Lord. I got one
[1:31:23] more scripture I want to read. Second
[1:31:25] Corinthians. Let's go back over to
[1:31:27] second
[1:31:28] Corinthians. Read
[1:31:31] here. 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:31:35] 4. Read these couple of verses of
[1:31:37] scripture. read. Got a quote here I want
[1:31:39] to read and we'll
[1:31:41] dismiss. Excuse me. 2 Corinthians
[1:31:46] 4:8. 2 Corinthians 4:8. Look at this.
[1:31:49] Beautiful. We are troubled on every side
[1:31:53] yet not
[1:31:54] distressed. We are perplexed but not in
[1:31:58] despair.
[1:32:01] Persecuted but not
[1:32:03] forsaken. Cast down but not destroyed.
[1:32:08] Always bearing, look at this beautiful
[1:32:10] now. Always bearing about in the body
[1:32:14] the dying of the Lord Jesus. Yes. That
[1:32:18] the life also of Jesus might be made
[1:32:21] manifest in our bodies.
[1:32:25] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. That's why
[1:32:27] I say I I have no life but but for him.
[1:32:31] Amen. Amen.
[1:32:33] I I people come on this earth to create
[1:32:37] great medicines and great inventions and
[1:32:40] sending man to the moon and whatever
[1:32:42] else, but I was put here for God. Yes. I
[1:32:45] I'm only here because of him. Period.
[1:32:48] That's that's it. And now Jesus for us
[1:32:53] that are here for him. Amen. who have
[1:32:56] died to ourselves as the scripture says
[1:32:59] are made manifest that the life of
[1:33:02] Christ is manifest in us now. Yes. For
[1:33:07] we which live are always delivered unto
[1:33:10] death for Jesus' sake, that the life
[1:33:13] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[1:33:17] our mortal flesh. Yes. We die to
[1:33:19] ourselves so that Christ can live. Amen.
[1:33:23] Amen. die to me so he lives in me.
[1:33:27] Praise the Lord. His life. It's his
[1:33:29] life, not
[1:33:31] mine. Nothing I could do, nothing I've
[1:33:33] ever done, nothing. There's no there's
[1:33:35] no possible way I could ever earn it in
[1:33:39] any way. It's only him.
[1:33:42] The seven church ages. Look at this.
[1:33:44] This is the book now. U this is the
[1:33:47] smian church age.
[1:33:50] Uh then now then here we are coming to a
[1:33:53] conclusion as the eternal logos God was
[1:33:56] manifested in the son and in g and and
[1:33:59] in Jesus to all the fullness of the
[1:34:01] godhead bodily and that eternal one was
[1:34:04] the father manifested in flesh and
[1:34:06] thereby gained the title of
[1:34:09] son trying to explain to understand the
[1:34:13] godhead it's not a trinity it's not
[1:34:16] three sang that song doesn't mean
[1:34:18] there's a god and a Father. Amen.
[1:34:22] There's God the Father, Jesus the Son.
[1:34:25] He's one. Amen. But there is in that one
[1:34:29] the sunship of God of of Jesus and the
[1:34:31] Father God in that one. We are the bride
[1:34:35] of Christ. We are the children of God.
[1:34:37] Amen. There's no there's no dilemma to
[1:34:39] that. People have to without revelation.
[1:34:43] You got to chop him up into two or three
[1:34:44] pieces to try to make the word work.
[1:34:46] Right? That's why the re the religious
[1:34:49] world is so confused. That's why you
[1:34:51] hear so many messages today about how
[1:34:54] powerful you are and how great things
[1:34:56] are going to be and how much if you come
[1:34:58] up and and you stand forward and I see
[1:35:01] brightness and I see greatness and and
[1:35:03] and uh the the strength of the power of
[1:35:06] the might of the goodness is going to
[1:35:10] bring forth the the the the beauty and
[1:35:14] it's it's all going to be blue skies and
[1:35:16] green grass and that's why it's what
[1:35:19] what did I just say
[1:35:23] I didn't say anything, right? I used a
[1:35:26] hundred words and said nothing. Right?
[1:35:28] And that's what you get today. Yes.
[1:35:30] People say all kinds of words and they
[1:35:32] say nothing. They give all kinds of
[1:35:34] platitudes and words that mean
[1:35:35] absolutely nothing. Amen.
[1:35:39] That's what you get today. But you only
[1:35:41] get it because if you don't if you don't
[1:35:43] try to manipulate the word, you can't
[1:35:46] make it work without a true revelation
[1:35:48] of the Holy Ghost. That's the only way
[1:35:50] it works. Amen. With the revelation of
[1:35:53] the Holy Spirit, God makes that work
[1:35:55] live in that word live in
[1:35:59] us. In Jesus dwelt all the fullness of
[1:36:02] the Godhead, body and that eternal one
[1:36:04] was the father manifested in flesh and
[1:36:06] thereby gained the title of son. Title
[1:36:09] of son. Even so we eternal in his
[1:36:13] thoughts in our turn became the many
[1:36:16] membered spoken word seed manifest in
[1:36:20] flesh manifest in flesh and those
[1:36:23] eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh
[1:36:27] are the sons of God. Just read that 1
[1:36:29] John 3. Now are we the sons of God by
[1:36:33] his love we can be called the sons of
[1:36:35] God. Now the manifestation in flesh are
[1:36:38] the sons of God. Even as we are so
[1:36:41] called. We did not become seed by the
[1:36:46] rebirth. We were seed and therefore were
[1:36:51] reborn. Amen. Praise
[1:36:53] God. You don't become an orange out of a
[1:36:57] lemon seed and then try to put a lemon
[1:37:00] in the
[1:37:02] orange. It doesn't work. It's a lemon
[1:37:05] because it was a lemon seed. Amen. We
[1:37:09] become reborn because of the seed that
[1:37:11] was in us. Yes. Praise the Lord. For
[1:37:15] only the
[1:37:16] elect can be reborn. Yes. Only the
[1:37:20] elect. That's it. What's that election?
[1:37:22] The
[1:37:23] predestination, predetermined fordation,
[1:37:27] the mind of God, the seed of God.
[1:37:29] However many ways you want to say it,
[1:37:32] it's all in God's mind before the
[1:37:34] foundation of the world. We just try to
[1:37:36] get a little glimpse, a little lighter
[1:37:38] glimpse of what he's done, what he's
[1:37:39] doing. I just I might not understand it
[1:37:42] all, but oh, I believe it all and I want
[1:37:45] to be a part of it all or whatever part
[1:37:48] I play in his economy, that's what I
[1:37:51] want to do. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's
[1:37:54] stand if we could.
[1:38:00] Amen.
[1:38:02] By the grace of God.
[1:38:05] Only by the grace of God.
[1:38:08] Thankful that his grace extended toward
[1:38:10] us that we could know what it is for him
[1:38:13] to manifest himself in our lives that we
[1:38:16] would be called the sons of God.
[1:38:19] Hallelujah. Does not yet appear. Well,
[1:38:22] yeah, now it does. Amen. Because he has
[1:38:25] appeared before us. He has manifested
[1:38:27] and revealed himself to us. Now we see
[1:38:30] him as he is. Praise the Lord. I'll see
[1:38:33] him too face to face in a corporal body.
[1:38:37] But now I see him face to face through
[1:38:39] his word. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:38:43] Let's sing this song. Maybe we'll sing a
[1:38:44] verse or two of
[1:38:46] it. Amen. When we all get to heaven.
[1:38:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:38:55] I don't even remember which number it is
[1:38:57] in the book here. Let's see if we can
[1:38:59] find it. 166. You got the book or your
[1:39:01] home or you want to follow along. 166 in
[1:39:04] the book. We'll have it on the screen
[1:39:05] here. Amen. When we all get to heaven.
[1:39:09] Oh, praise the Lord Jesus. You know, it
[1:39:11] says what a day of rejoicing that'll be.
[1:39:14] I I I agree with that 100%. But all why
[1:39:18] can't we rejoice now? Why can't this be
[1:39:21] a time of rejoicing what the Lord's
[1:39:23] shown us and give to us who we are?
[1:39:25] Amen. Let's sing it
[1:39:27] though. Sing the wondous love of Jesus.
[1:39:33] Sing his mercy and his grace in the
[1:39:39] mansions bright and blessed. He'll
[1:39:43] prepare for us a
[1:39:45] place when we
[1:39:48] all get to
[1:39:50] heaven. What a day of rejoicing that
[1:39:54] will
[1:39:55] be. When we
[1:39:57] all sing,
[1:40:00] Jesus will sing and shout the
[1:40:05] victory. And while we walk the hill from
[1:40:10] bath, clouds will
[1:40:13] over the
[1:40:15] sky. When happy days are over, all the
[1:40:22] shadows on a
[1:40:24] side when we
[1:40:26] all get to heaven.
[1:40:30] On a day of rejoicing that will
[1:40:33] be when we
[1:40:36] all see
[1:40:38] Jesus will sing and shout the
[1:40:43] victory. Onward to the Christ before us.
[1:40:49] Soon his beauty will be old. Soon the
[1:40:55] worldly gates will open. We shall tread
[1:41:00] the seats of gold and sing it now when
[1:41:03] we
[1:41:04] all get to
[1:41:06] heaven. Oh
[1:41:09] yeah. Hallelujah. We
[1:41:13] all see
[1:41:15] Jesus will sing and shout
[1:41:20] victory when we
[1:41:22] all get to
[1:41:25] him. What a day of mercy that will
[1:41:29] be when we
[1:41:32] all see
[1:41:34] Jesus will sing and shout
[1:41:39] victory. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. What a
[1:41:43] day of rejoicing, saints. Hallelujah.
[1:41:45] Amen. That will be. But oh, I think I
[1:41:48] think it's worth a little rejoicing now,
[1:41:49] too. Amen. Praise the Lord. I think it's
[1:41:52] worth a little bit of rejoicing now. We
[1:41:54] worship and praise the Lord. We sing
[1:41:56] songs of Zion and just glorify God. I
[1:41:59] think it's a great time of rejoicing
[1:42:01] right now. Yes. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:42:05] There's nothing going to be compared to
[1:42:07] when I come to that place.
[1:42:11] That's just hard to fathom, saints.
[1:42:14] Amen. Nothing compared to that. Oh, but
[1:42:17] what a day of rejoicing we have. Praise
[1:42:20] the Lord Jesus. Amen. Whole world is
[1:42:23] growing.
[1:42:24] Travailing the sons of God groaning
[1:42:27] travailing
[1:42:29] looking at this time the manifestation
[1:42:32] of the sons of God. Yes. Praise the Lord
[1:42:35] Jesus. Amen. God richly bless you. I
[1:42:39] pray something was said to bless and
[1:42:40] strengthen you in the Lord. Amen. And uh
[1:42:43] just trust the Lord continue to bless
[1:42:45] and be with us and be with you through
[1:42:47] the week. Watch over each one. Help us

[1:43:02] each of you. Amen. Just pray the Lord
[1:43:05] bless you all. Amen. We'll be dismissed
[1:43:07] today. Flight leaves right at three. I
[1:43:10] think it's like 2:56 or something, so
[1:43:12] didn't have to move service up today.
[1:43:14] But again, appreciate your prayers.
[1:43:16] Amen. And just trust the Lord bless you.
[1:43:19] Amen. Anyone have anything before we're
[1:43:22] dismissed today?

[1:43:29] encouragement. The Lord showed me last
[1:43:32] night to read several quotes.
[1:43:36] Amen.
[1:43:39] And all that's happening, you know, the
[1:43:42] natural elements and then you think it's
[1:43:47] God. Amen. It can be of one mind and one
[1:43:49] accord. Yes. If we'll just let him work
[1:43:52] through us. Wonderful. Amen. That's
[1:43:54] exactly right. Praise the Lord. So good.
