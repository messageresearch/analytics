could Amen brother Dennis would you pray Lord Lord Jesus I feel like David said one time I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord yes Lord Jesus we know that the Gentile dispensation is coming to a close and that much more father let us have the recognition how the devil's fighting us oh Jesus we know that enticing Spirits are challenging the word daily it's like the prophet said it's not the big things we do for God it's the little things we leave undone am it just takes one little thing in our lives that we fail or refuse to line up with your word and that'll keep keep us out of your kingdom father it's just that sobering and Lord let us search our hearts daily Lord to see that we're our our full identity is with your word yes Lord amen we can look back at your servant Abraham he sought for a city whose Builder and maker was God yes and Lord when he left the Promised Land no matter what he did you couldn't bless him until he got back to the land that you had given him and Lord you have given us a promised land for our day amen if we leave that Promised Land the word of God no matter how we think we're right with you we're doing good we're lining up with the your word it takes one thing that'll keep us away from you father Jesus yes Lord and Lord It's the little things the um inability and the refusal to pay our ties it's the refusal to knowing that we can be in the house of God J that we refuse to come to your house of worship Lord I heard your Prophet said if Christ is truly in your heart you can wait for those Church doors to open up amen if not then it's time to get to praying it's time to seeking God oh Lord the greater the sacrifice the greater the blessing yes Lord and another um Twist of unbelief the devil's thrown to the believer is fellowshipping with unbelievers your word says do not unequally yoke yourself yourselves with unbelievers and unbelievers will suck the very spirituality out of your life oh lord it's the devil just whistling in our ears these songs of unbelief and father speak to our hearts it's time that we line up it's time that we cry out that we want to go home soon oh Lord help us is to have the burden and the love even to pray for one another yes Lord God to pray that much more as we see that day approaching Lord there are needs amongst your Believers this morning that need to touch Sister sheilia Sister Lydia sister Karen our precious Lord uh Sisters of the faith may you come un seene and Grant them a healing touch yes for we know that you are truly a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your stripes we are healed and father we claim toal deliverance from our sickness yes God and Father my sister-in-law Celeste she's going through it father

Celeste needs deliver her father from this condition that she's dealing with and there was a time oh 10 years ago she called me herself and says Dennis I gave my heart to you to the Lord yes and

week I uh got my blood work done this past week uh dark called me uh had a had a voice conference with him Thursday I believe it was Thursday afternoon Thursday evening when it Thursday call me Friday Friday Thursday Friday I thought it was the same day did we goch Thurs you know why he was leaving for a fishing trip onid yeah we we had lunch Thursday yes so it was Thursday afternoon at 5 o'clock anyway had the he called me we got the uh he gave me the results uh everything was nice normal good um all the body parts all the organs everything uh was in good shape the only thing he had a question about was I was one tenth of a point high on the A1C normal 5.6 I was 5.7 so uh it gave me some advice to work on that which is easy enough but other than that uh liver kidneys uh prostate he said everything else come back cholesterol all normal good so praise the Lord for that so thank God for that but I still want to ask uh the pain I'm still having in my feet was the initiation of the whole thing I appreciate your prayers for my feet still uh I I kind of think more or less it was I I think it developed as a result of my knees and the way I started walking because of my knees uh so

all the glory all the praise we can give him amen is more than worthy praise the Lord Jesus amen amen glory to God God is good amen praise the Lord let's stand to our feet if we could amen we'll get it to the scripture amen start try to pick up where we left off last week amen praise the Lord Jesus we're going to go back to the scripture um 2 Corinthians chapter 10 amen second Corinthians chapter 10 read a verse of scripture here Lord willing not be too long there's one just one specific point of this that I wanted to make this morning um just a little too much to try to uh bring two different parts into it but uh uh but not u a very lengthy so but could have other plans we'll see what the Lord has in store amen praise the Lord 2 Corinthians chapter 10 we be we'll just read verse five this time we've read the other verses through but just ver five but before we do let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could precious Lord Jesus father again it is such a privilege to be in your house thank you so much for the grace and mercy that you give to us that you shine upon our pathway every day the unmar favor God that you give us Lord in our lives that we can trust and believe that we stand upon your word and believe God in your spirit and what you have for us do for us give to us every day Lord lead guide and direct us into all your word into all your truths to do that God that would be pleasing only to you Lord may you just bless this service Lord may you continue upon the remaining part of it to speak to us from your word Lord show us in here what you'd have us to see and know whatever it might be God to encourage us Lord to strengthen us Lord to correct us to Lord to bring us to a place of Greater understanding whatever it may be God lord we don't have anything new there's no new message there's as Solomon said there's new nothing new Under the Sun yes Lord we had no no new message Lord but just to bring about and reiterate those things God that we go through in life every day that exemplifies your word and Lord just to let it illuminate in our hearts in our lives God every day we re every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done accomplish in this service now Lord that that you set it forth for God in your mind before the foundation of this the world this this service took place accomplish now in us what you would have it to be done we'll thank you and praise you for all of it Lord and give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen 2 Corinthians chapter 10 1 verse verse 5 amen casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ amen you can be seated if you like Christ the word bringing everything into obedience to Christ the word now we know that uh as we go back and and bring back some parts that we had to mention before the last couple of times that we talked on this uh this will be the Gateway part three the mind uh I want to reiterate and go back to understanding that uh that in in the Garden of Eden brother brandom expressed to us that uh that the choice was made there uh of what part of the person what part of the human uh that the devil would choose Satan chose the mind uh I believe there's a very good reason why he chose the mind because he recognized him being God's right hand man at one time that U if he chose any other part that at some point he would have no gate to get into so you understand what I mean by that is that him knowing what God's plan was that he knew that we would be at this place to be born again yes if we and when we reach the place of of a new birth he knew that at that point he would be sealed out of any part that he could get to us he chose the mind because even though he would be sealed out of the Soul by the new birth of those that received the new birth in their soul he knew that that being uh that being shut out from that that he had still have access to you through your mind through your mental faculties so he chose the place that he knew that he could try to get to to bring defilement now he knows the greatest defilement of course would be the defiling of the Soul we're going to we're going to read a little bit about that in a minute but uh but he could not do that uh it when it came to the time that those that were to be born again by the spirit of God received the spirit of God to become like Jesus Christ and for Jesus to be sealed in the soul and for the devil to be sealed out right if the devil had chose that part and God sealed him out of that part he would have absolutely no access to you whatsoever now none period no way to get to you at all amen but God chose the heart God chose the soul God chose the place of Faith Now understand we talked about of course the body the seed taste F smell here we talk about we understand the spirit the imagination conscience infection reason memory and those five senses Outlets that enter into the spirit but we recognize that the soul is the place of faith brother bam calls it the sixth sins the six sin is the place of faith and that's the place that that that God chose understanding that the only way to be able to come to God the only way to believe God the only way to know that God exists is by faith amen amen we must have faith and that faith comes from the soul now if that soul is not born again if that soul is not sealed by the Holy Spirit then uh that faith is a perverted faith amen cuz that faith will only reach out to the things that it could then uh imagine or see or feel or something that that is attached to the body or spirit amen that Faith would be a perverted faith that reason that faith is a pure faith in the soul of of a person is by the spirit of God dwelling in there that's why God chose that because it's that place of Faith understanding you don't under you don't you don't know God with your mind you don't believe God with your mind you don't understand god with your mind it comes from the soul it comes from the heart it comes from that place of faith and believing that God is amen the new birth is the place that makes the soul off limits to the devil amen that place uh that new birth makes the soul off limits to the devil now let's go uh read a story here real quick and and just delve into the point that I wanted to get to this morning St Mark chapter 5 Mark chapter 5 I'm going to begin with the first verse three of the gospels record this story and from what I know of the scripture this is probably the one story uh outside maybe even the Rich Young Ruler that is very different book to book uh if you read this same story uh in each of the three books that it's recorded in it's uh without Revelation without understanding without faith faith is a revelation without faith to know where God is bringing us in the scripture people say oh well it just contradicts itself amen because as it talks about here a man actually in Matthew it says two men two people so without understanding without revelation of what the scripture and of course the point of views and the things that are brought by each by each man that wrote that gopel uh a person would say well why would I want to believe this it doesn't even agree with itself right amen but this is now there's other stories that's recorded in a gospel two or three gospels but this is one that I found that's probably the most different as it is written from different points of view that is that is different so uh keep that in mind as we read through this because it'll be a story that'll come back to your mind I though you've read it heard it preached on before but as it comes back your mind that that'll elicit that part of your brain chapter 5 Mark 5 I usually take this story out of Matthew Matthew's actually Matthews is kind of my favorite depiction of this story but uh for particular reasons I picked the one out of Mark this time and they came over look now fifth verse of St Mark uh uh fifth chapter first verse and they came over unto the other side of the sea into the country of the gines and when he had come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean Spirit a man now again if you go back into Matthew it says two here it says a man with an unclean Spirit but look what it continues to as the story continues to unfold a a a man with an unclean Spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not not with chains not with chains this man could not be bound with chains could not be fettered with chains because that he had been often bound with feeds and chains and the chains had been plucked aunder by him and the feeds broken in pieces neither could any man tame or that is to subdue him this man was that the spirit that was in this man gave him Supernatural strength to be able when a chain come on him or a Fed come on him or a dozen men try to come on him he would break them all and beat them all amen so he just dwelt in the tombs trying to find anything in anybody that he could deceive but this man was bound amen Bound by this Spirit not bound by the feds not bound by the chains but Bound by the spirit that demonic spirit that had gotten a hold of this man's mind had gotten a hold of this man's even into his Spirit had gotten a hold of this man to where this man didn't wasn't even himself now and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones now uh you see how that in itself is a very demonic trait amen The Cutting of oneself is a demonic trait amen let's let's we'll come back to this but let's go to one another scripture uh because this isn't the only place that is referred to that the cutting of oneself as a demonic act right as as a as an evil spirit that causes people to do that uh that causes people to defile their bodies uh by The Cutting of their skin and putting ink in there uh it's a demonic act I I see people that think I guess they think they're doing a great thing with crosses and pictures of Jesus and big black and all on their arms and all but that's a defilement of of the of the the temple that is supposed to house God himself it's a defilement of their bodies it's a cutting of their bodies you have to cut your skin it's not all the way down to where you bleed but is a cutting of the skin to inject ink into your body right but look that's not the only place that is referred to First Kings uh chapter 18 verse 25 this is Mount Carmel Showdown uh with Elijah uh First Kings 18 verse 25 and Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal of Baal the prophets of ba and we talked about Baal a couple months ago we know the evilness of that Spirit choose you one Bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are for ye are many and call on the name of your God's plural but put no fire under and they took the bulock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of Bale from morning even until noon saying oh Bale hear us but there was no voice nor any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made now again these are evil spirits these are evil people of false prophets uh being influenced by evil spirits right it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a God either he is uh talking or he is pursuing or he is in a journey or maybe he's asleep amen Elijah's making fun of them oh he's God he's a God but you know he could be asleep uh maybe he's gone on a trip and he can't hear you maybe he's on the phone maybe he's in conversation with somebody else maybe he's gone and take a siesta who knows maybe your God just ain't reachable right now did you imagine or pervent pervent he sleepeth and must be awake and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner now notice how this cutting is after their manner what is their manner evil devil satanic right cutting themselves after their manner with lives uh uh knives and latches till the blood gust out upon them that in itself helps you understand these were the worshippers of the false god baale they were evil demonic spirits and their custom was to cut theirselves now if you don't tell me that that is not evil trait in the scripture I don't know I don't know how else to Define it that's perfectly clear this is it it even States after their manner to do this helps you understand this is a demonic trait amen it's a demonic spirit that has people do that I've gone to grocery stores before and seen um nice nice uh one particular I can remember nice girl uh she's very polite and she reached out to grab my groceries and she was sliced all up her arms and I you know you know they're they're scarred they're they're healed but you see the scars lining all up straight up you know what they did you know what happened to that person that demonic Spirit got a hold of them that that demonic Spirit got a hold of their mind and persuaded them to do something that was wrong that was contrary to normal thinking much less the scripture normal thinking doesn't say hey let me take a knife and stab myself with it that's not normal thinking a demonic Spirit has to get a hold of a person and control their minds to the place that they are that that they are convinced to do this to to be able to do this I remember another sister one time um she had done the same thing on her body arms I forgot where all it was and she had all these horrible scars she came to the lord gave her heart to the Lord was born again and she came up to a prayer line I remember forgot where this was or how it unfolded but I just remember the story uh she came up for prayer one time and she asked that that they would pray that the Lord would remove all the evidence and scars that you remember was this okay Monica remembers in must have been North Carolina then or somebody we knew and she had these cars she asked the Lord to take these off of her cuz they were just a constant reminder of that old life and the Lord actually took all those words off her body amen that's the God we serve erased everything about all that that the devil had done to her praise God God is able to do it to the body he's able to do it to the mind he's able to do it to the spirit he obviously we know he does it to the soul when we come receive a new birth yes praise the Lord delivered her and brought her and restored her back to her normal place but we see this is a demonic trait a demonic spirit that causes people to do those things amen even sometimes maybe even being uh um uh uh they have a mind to do something good or have a mind to do something right like I said have Plastering a big tattoo of crosses or Jesus on there something thinking that want to do something good but this conscious like it's like it's like Saul uh trying to save the the violent Refuge animals that God said destroy right oh they're violent refus according to God but you know I'm going to save some of them to sacrifice to God no why would you do that God didn't ask you to sacrifice your body to slap a big picture of himself on you or crosses on you or scripture he didn't ask you to do that amen he didn't ask asked Saul to save these animals to sacrifice he said kill them they're vile and refused get rid of them his mind may have had a a good thought of something to do for God but that's the the thing that we do for God is to obey his word yes amen and his word says not to do this right they after the manner of themselves cut themselves this evil spirit that's on this man look again he cried with a loud voice and say where do we end up here there's u a day and night let's go back to the fifth verse and always night and day he was in the mountains in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones so we know that that's an evil spirit you can identify that right away right amen but when he saw Jesus a far off he ran and worshiped him or he ran and fell down before him but look what he did now I don't know how that got translated to worship but he ran and fell down before Jesus and he cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of the most high God I adure you I adure Thee by God this evil spirit is speaking unto God himself saying I adure You by God that thou torment me not now what what is it that this that this evil spirit saw that caused him to first run up to Jesus and second to beg Jesus and adure him by the Living God that he not torment him now what did he see in Jesus that would have caused him to do that amen it wasn't the way he was dressed right wasn't because he had his beard shaped just right it wasn't cause he had just gotten a nice haircut wasn't caus the clothes he was wearing wasn't cause the way he was walking wasn't the company he kept it was something that Spirit recognized in Jesus and what was it it was the spirit the spirit recognized the spirit the Demonic spirit in this man recognized the holy spirit in Jesus Christ and he ran up to him and said now now Matthew says why have you come to torment us before the time but here it says iure thee by God that thou torment me not for he had said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit but then Jesus asked him and he he asked him what is thy name and he answered saying my name is Legion for we are many amen now you're talking more than one we are many uh possessed of this demonic spirits that was on this person and he Bes saw him much that he would not send them away out of the country and can you Imagine The Devils that so many people fear the demonic spirits that so many people are afraid of we asking begging Jesus please don't torment us please don't send us out of the country now who's got control a lot of times I'm sorry Saints but sometimes a lot of times we act like he's in charge right the devil's not in charge I'm in charge amen you're in charge God is in charge of this situation and the God and me is in charge of this not the devil the devil's not in charge of whether you are well or sick the devil is not in charge of whether you're happy or sad the devil's not in charge of whether you have peace Joy or happiness the devil's not in charge of any of that he is a loser and he's lost every battle he's ever fought against God and he's still a loser because he comes to us oh please please those Devils beg please don't cast us out please don't torment us please don't send us out of the country because Jesus had already said come out of him so he knew he had no choice he was going to have to come out but look Saints the devil's not in charge you are amen stand up and claim take what belongs to you it's yours don't belong to him amen I don't care if it's on you I don't care if it's on your family your children your home I don't care where it is he has no Authority right Satan has where the where the power of God is Satan has no Authority right he has every Authority in the world to set on the in the white house he has every Authority in the world to be behind some pulpits across the country across the world but he has no Authority where the spirit of God Is Right none absolutely and that's you praise the Lord that is you has no authority over you remember that Satan has no authority over you he besought him much 10th verse again that he would not send them away out of the country Satan begging to Jesus amen now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of WI a swine feeding and all the Devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them because though the as we preached several times it's been a long time but those Spirits don't die right Spirits don't die amen they're always here amen when a person dies their Spirit doesn't die amen their Spirit goes somewhere amen when these evil spirits these evil spirits aren't just cast out of existence right they're just cast from one to the other remember when brother randam um uh had the prayer line and he then he was Discerning people in the congregation and there's a couple down here that uh that was uh making out and and very disrespectful and God call and brother ramam called him out said you don't need to stop doing that be respectful and so and they laughed scoffed at him or whatever he said okay I am not responsible for what happens here tonight right amen and and those evil spirits uh come out and he uh brother random would call that evil spirit out that one time that evil spirit came out and got them and they fell on the floor with Le uh uh epilepsy both of them cuz the spirit didn't die right the spirit didn't just go to hell that Spirit went into those people and they fell on the floor with epilepsy that Spirit just came out trying to find another place to go right amen that's all it did right and when it found a place it could enter it went into them and they fell out with with epilepsy I remember another story he's Tau brother R was preaching uh the the these two people across the the congregation here had had the same type devil on them and he said uh and and and and the Lord's taken over the the service and and and he said this uh brother Ram's calling out this one call out this one those he said those demons are crying out to each other for Mercy because they're getting ready to have to be to leave they they they could not stay in the places they were right and there those Spirits were crying out to each other like Spirits crying out to each other amen where are we going to go because those Spirits are going to go somewhere yeah these Spirits are looking and saw this herd of swine feeding on this mountains over here and forth with 13 first forth with Jesus gave them Le now in Matthew the only thing Jesus ever says according to the account that Matthew gave is one two-letter word go right that's all he said he didn't talk to him according to Matthew now there was no conversation there was no who you are there was none of this uh I cast you out or any he just said if you're going to cast us out cast us now hurt us why Jesus just said go amen praise the Lord that's the authority amen you know it's been often said boo devil Boo get smaller Boo get smaller amen be something as simple go yeah that's it amen that Jesus didn't cast them into the swine they cast themselves there if you're going to cast us out cast us into the swine okay go there they went amen and forth with Jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out praise the Lord and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep Place into the sea they were about 2,000 and were choked in the sea and they that fled uh they that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country and they went out to see what it was that was done and they came to and and they come to Jesus and see him that was possessed with the Devil the one that was possessed with the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind praise the Lord amen this was a man that broke chains feathers dozen men couldn't handle him and he's sitting there sitting clothed and in his right mind amen was that scripture and brother Dennis quotes that sometimes in his prayer God has not given us a spirit of fear right amen amen but of love and of a sound mind praise the Lord sitting cloth in his right mind and they were afraid they were afraid they were a now it doesn't they didn't go around him before so I'm guessing they were afraid before when he was when he was possessed of that demon but now he's a normal functioning human in his right mind and now they're afraid now they he finally got delivered he's finally healed he's finally a normal operating human in his right mind and now they're afraid oh human humans we're just we're something else aren't we yes amen we're just humans are so complex now they're afraid and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil and also concerning the swine and they began to pray him to depart out of their Coast he delivered them of the evil spirits Legion that was on this man that none of them could handle they were scared of him he dwelt around the and he's finally delivered and now they're scared and want to get rid of the guy that healed him uh humans are oh that that's just that's amazing uh I I just it's hard to Fathom that you would think that in a situation like that where the Deliverance took place the healing in this man and the evidence is right there that they would want him to stay around they wanted him to leave to depart out of their coast and when he was com into the ship he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him how be it Jesus suffer him not but saith unto him go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord has done for thee and had and ha had compassion on thee and he departed and began to publish and decopolis how great things Jesus had done for him and all men did Marvel praise the Lord the casting out of that evil spirit now those evil spirits this Legion had control over him this Legion had control over this man no way that a normal human I don't care how strong he is can break chains like that and feds and defeat a dozen men to where they could not handle him no normal man man can do that it has to be a possession of a demonic spirit that had full control over him but look what brother brandom said I want you to see this a lot of people a lot of people will write that off uh and think how could that person be a a seed how could that person be a child of God and be so possessed let me read demonic uh and demonology Physical Realm 1953 now for a few minutes we're going to talk about demonology you you hear so much about demons he goes on talking about tomorrow in the service and when he's going to try to finish now the first thing what a demon is you hear so many people talk about a demon well now a demon a devil all comes from one word and in the English it is called Tormentor if a person's being tormented it's a devil if it's spiritual if it's physical if it's Financial if it's mental it's a devil Tormentor is a devil a fellow that torments is a devil an evil one now the Bible today most people think old black book that Grandpa Grandma read something like that there's not much to it for the old folks go and so forth but that is wrong it is for everybody demons are t tormentors that torment us now look now there is demons that come into the soul of man obviously that is before the man the person is converted before a new birth right amen because after that part after that point Satan cannot enter into that Soul when God seals himself in as we've said many times he seals the devil out yes Amen brother Brandon makes that very clear to understand the devil is sealed out of the soul but before that time the devil can come into the soul of man he's talking about phraseology said it would be I'd say this though that uh the demon that comes into the soul is something that torments the soul even being born with a wrong with with the with a fallen nature amen doing things that are wrong but look that is something that torments the soul many times you can see a person maybe of insanity a person that's insane a person that's been taken over their mental capacities by an evil spirit just like Legion here now they may uh now they may be yet a converted person filled with the Holy Ghost and yet be totally insane they could be totally insane but still be a converted person totally insane and still be born again totally insane and still have the Holy Ghost still be a child of God and be totally insane M see a lot of people don't think in those in those uh in that way how could a person totally insane totally captivated take it over by these evil spirits but yet be a child of God but brother R said M makes it very clear a person a converted person filled with the Holy Ghost can be uh can still be totally insanee amen that brings to light to understand that God God's that that that mind that part of the place that Satan chose has nothing to do with the soul amen that even though they're possessed here that has nothing to do with the soul the soul if if if they've been born again filled the Holy Ghost that that soul is is is converted is fil it's it's uh filled with the Holy Spirit the devil sealed Out the Devil can still get to the mind he can still get to the body he can still get to the spirit but he cannot get to the soul so one has nothing to do with the other right in that in that regard yes even a person that Satan has been able to overtake in their mind through some weakness of theirs somehow I'm going to read this story in just a minute that it shows how weakness in a person can bring about that spirit in their mind and yet still be born again because the mind doesn't have anything to do with the soul they could be touched in the mind the Soul's still born of God Amen one doesn't have anything to do with the other you look out here sometimes you see people that may look totally insane they they may be born again we don't know right we don't know their history I don't know where they come from we don't know who they are amen they could absolutely be a child of God we don't know that amen that's why we're to that's why we're try to we are to try to do to be directed by God in what we do to anybody wherever we go whoever we see if God leads us to do something to help that person or whatever might be then we should do that amen I wouldn't do it unless the Lord directed me to do it necessarily but if the Lord directed absolutely 100% do it you never know maybe entertain the angels unawares you don't know but that person out here on the street and say look and say could absolutely be a child of God born again we don't know amen because one doesn't have anything to do with the other now look I'm going to read this very familiar story see how even just a simple weakness or something that had come on a person allowed the spirit entry a way to be able to get in to torment this person diseases and afflictions January 1950 now this I I got this Mr Brown to be a minister if I'm wrong then I'm I'm wrong but uh brother Brandon refers to this man as Mr Brown but Mr Brown that's a little lengthy story so and I won't be much longer when I get done with this because remember remember brother brandham predicted brother brandham said uh he said I predict that this world in so many years I forgot what it was will be totally insane this world will go totally insane and friend U one of the things that we did for Emma yesterday and building a bear was at the mall reminded me why I never go to the mall uh I I know I know Legion was around the tombs but I I I declare the demons I see hang around malls I don't know what it is I guess there's nothing wrong with it shopping or whatever but uh my goodness the stuff that's over there is pretty bad anyway uh but the whole world totally insane but look on this is 1950 now 1950 but Mr Brown said come down into the basement brother brandom of the auditorium he said I've got a case down here that you've never seen anything like it well I went down uh if you're listening now you're you're you're following along or you're streaming uh follow this story now if you've never heard it well I went down while I was resting I've seen some horrible sights but I've never seen anything quite like that I've went into institutions where young ladies used the bed pan smear on their face insane seen some horrible things but never nothing like this lying on the floor was a woman about 30 years old 35 strongl looking woman and her legs sticking straight up in the air like like this and her legs were bleeding there was a man standing on the step just a good old Arkansas brother with a pair of overalls on a blue shirt he said friends I'll say some of the best hearts beats under that that's right said I don't like any put on I like real oldfashioned men women that's right God saved twice born and he was standing there his old Fade Out face uh faded out looking clothes on walk down I said how do you do he said good evening are you brother brandom I said yes sir said I thought you I thought you was the PA system was uh taking it down in there the PA system was going down to where he was so he could hear they had a bunch of insane on one side but they uh but they couldn't keep this woman with no one had a bunch of insanities talking about on one side there he said but they could not keep this woman near anybody else taking about eight or 10 men just to bring her in they couldn't bring her in an ambulance they wouldn't put her in uh an ambulance they sent someone up there in a car and she kicked all the glasses out of the car and then man trying to hold her in that car and there she was laying on her back doctor had give her some shot uh had give her some shot her premature change of life look now her diminished capacity had brought this on her premature change of life had run her into this amen that's how serious that can be the change of life in a woman 3035 so premature as he said change of life so her dimin her diminished capacity in herself brought this on good woman godly woman children mother mother wife but this this diminished capacity brought this Spirit on Amen it allowed an Avenue for it to come in and there she was laying on her back I said well I'll walk out and see if I feel any vibrations he said brother brandom don't you go out there said she will kill you I said oh I think not just like that I walked out she was lying there looking at me kind of batting her eyes staring and I said good evening she never said a word took a hold of her hand I said good evening said she don't even know her own name brother brandom she hasn't known for two years I took a hold of her hand and just by God's blessings I happened to be on my guard she just gave me a jerk with both hands like that and she would have probably broke the bones of my body I threw my foot out and caught her right across the bosom uh she just pulled me way down I jerked away from her and then when I run from her listen to this now when I run from her to get on the steps I seen a sight that I'd never seen before that woman with her two limbs sticking up in the air like this come chasing me on her back like a snake you could hear her crawling like that on the floor crawling across the floor on her back with her legs sticking straight up in the air chasing brother randam as he went to the stairs on her back like a snake on the floor he said now that's the devil amen sounds a lot like Legion maybe not quite the detail a lot of the same type story this is a man this is a woman who knows what would cause it with that man we don't know brother bam identifies this with this woman we don't know what might to happen to that man just like we don't know so many times in life amen I had an uncle he was he was never right in his head and I asked my dad he he had a hard time with life he was he was subtle he wasn't a very we just had a rough time and I asked my dad one time he said was Uncle Clyde he said uh that my uncle had been in some of the worst battles of World War II you would and Battle of the Bulge he had been in two or three of like the worst battles that they that us fought and that I forgot all he on a Battle of the Bulge eima ones that were very very I mean men American soldiers died by the thousands in those bullets you hear screaming by your ear and it my my uncle was never the same after that and honestly friend how can you blame him yes amen how can you blame him but look this devil now this woman got in hear that premature changes said now that's the devil you can say of it what you desire but that woman was bound by the devil she came to me on her back like a serpent and she got up there and she hit against the side of the floor like that with the stairs banged up against the stairs she turned around put her big Strong Limbs up against and kicked it like that he said there was a bent sitting there and she hit it with she hit the bench with her head and the blood flew out of the side of her head and she knocked a a a big piece Off the Bench she grabbed it with her hand and threw it at her husband and struck the wall so hard that the plastering fell from the walls where she had hid it Maniac 20 times her strength probably there was that great she was a good-sized woman anyhow and she started making a real funny noise like like that I looked at her I thought why my I've never seen nothing God have mercy on a poor human being bound like that and a man Comm and the man commits to commenced to cry he walked over put his hand his arms around me said brother bam now you say there's no vibration said I don't know what I'm going to do he just broke down crying he said she's got five little children at home she's been a good woman she's uh hard over these old clots to help me raise cotton crops when she had taken six said I've done everything I could to help her I sold the farm in order to get here brother R I had one thing left a pair of mules I sold them just to get to the brother here 200 miles to bring her down and now she's kicking the glass out of the car that's why her limbs were bleeding she had been off her she had been she hasn't been off her back in two years and don't even she doesn't even know her own name I said well brother sure God can heal her yes and about that time she turned around she said William brandom you have nothing to do with me I brought her here he said why I said that's not her that's the devil speaking out of her that's right they recognize they know he said why brother brandom that's the first word she spoken in two years but that's not her I said the devil is just using her lips like that one case of Legion that we had just read she came crawling over that way said you ain't got nothing to do with me crawling like that brother he said do you believe that story The Angel he's talking to that man of the angs of the Lord coming a lot more to the story bottom line is brother R prays for the woman cast that Spirit out and he said brother brother vam what do I do with her now he said take her back to the end s of do you believe with all my heart he asked him two or three times do you believe man says with all my heart he said now what do I do he said take her back to the insane asylum and let her there and believe don't doubt but believe it has been it has been happening remember doesn't always God doesn't always work right that second we always expect a miracle we always expect instance aneous it's said it's done it's finished no healing is a process of time and and sometimes different uh things play into that and he ask the man do you believe yes take her back to insan Sol keep believeing he said he was over in Jonesboro Arkansas a while later he said and while he was there had Services some lady kept looking at him and and and and calling him out waving to him and all he talked to her he said she said you don't remember me do you or something like that he says uh who are you that was that woman she had her five children and her husband sitting right there in her right mind sitting there worshiping the Lord amen amen you look at the woman in the basement think there is no way that could be a that could be a Christian there's no way that could be a Godly woman but it absolutely was yes amen praise him when she came when that Spirit was cast out and she came came in her right mind there she was back with her family again in church being the person she was Holy Ghost filled Christian amen because it's of the mind that thing of the mind has nothing to do with the soul and a person that can be that can be uh have that control taken over them their mind in a in in a weakened condition and bring a person to be like that can bring a person to be like Legion can bring a person person to be like this woman amen but again the point they can be totally insane and still be a child of God still be born again and be totally insane because the mind that is corruptible amen has nothing to do with the soul praise the Lord amen let's stand if we could praise the lord it's God that controls that yes amen no way that devil was allowed in that woman's soul but he could get a hold of her mind amen he could get a hold of her mind there's no way amen that the devil finds that inroad that he can get to somehow some way to bring perversion but God always has a way God always has a release God always has an answer yes he does a truth amen praise the Lord Jesus amen let's sing this course uh
