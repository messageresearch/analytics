[24:48] mourning for my mother still kind of
[24:51] hard to I still have a hard time gladly
[24:54] grasping that that she's gone to the
[24:57] other side now but again it's all in
[25:01] God's plans and it's prayers and support
[25:05] of you precious Saints and different

[25:28] glad to be back home glad to be back in
[25:30] Tucson and glad

[25:34] we'll find a way to get together amen I
[25:37] miss you it's it's good to have a
[25:40] service here today we'll just take some
[25:42] time and just trust the Lord will feed
[25:44] us of his word but you know it's just
[25:46] not the same the Bible says to gather
[25:49] with those of like precious faith to
[25:51] gather together even if that much more
[25:54] as we see the Day approaching and boy
[25:55] don't we see that Day approaching it is
[25:58] at the door the things that we used to
[26:01] say are coming we can now say our here
[26:03] now there are others still coming
[26:05] there's other things to happen and we
[26:07] know that they're unfolding and
[26:09] unfolding probably quicker than we could
[26:12] have imagined a member we're a part of
[26:14] it and we know and looking to very soon
[26:17] for this brother the Lord Jesus to be
[26:19] taken home in a rapture and that's my
[26:22] Hall desire I have a scripture reading I
[26:24] want for you to read at your home I
[26:27] would say when you go home but most of
[26:29] you are at home we're not gonna I'm not
[26:31] going to read it right now the two
[26:33] people here grabbing their Bibles I'm
[26:36] not gonna read it now I want you to read
[26:37] it at home reading it when you get a
[26:38] chance Psalms 56 11 it's become quite a
[26:43] motto of mine lately as I've been under
[26:47] these circumstances and living through
[26:50] these additions and things that we've
[26:52] done while we were in North Carolina and
[26:54] then had fly back to Tucson and
[26:58] underneath the umbrella of the
[27:00] possibility of closing down Airlines and
[27:02] closing down state borders and all these
[27:05] other things and I just pray Lord get us
[27:07] home and so I'm thankful that he did
[27:10] praise the Lord I was asking some
[27:13] brothers last night or brother and
[27:14] sister last night and asked other people
[27:16] for so water shirt water message people
[27:18] going to do now that we can't go to
[27:20] restaurants and eat that seems to be
[27:24] most of the thing that we do we gather
[27:25] together we go to restaurants we spend
[27:28] time to break bread nothing wrong with
[27:31] that it's very scriptural we break bread
[27:33] and set together and have
[27:35] oh ship and I will admit it's been a
[27:37] couple two or three weeks and I miss it
[27:39] very dearly and miss you all very dearly
[27:41] so we just want to do what the lords put
[27:44] her on a heart to do what the pastor of
[27:46] the Holy Cross Church here that we rent
[27:49] from has done for us and Micah and all
[27:51] his efforts and the equipment and
[27:52] everything and exactly being here to
[27:54] lead a couple of song service I just
[27:56] didn't we could have done it without
[27:58] song service and just didn't feel I just
[28:02] didn't feel right I just I felt like we
[28:04] needed to have some kind of solemn
[28:07] service something to till that ground to
[28:08] get ready for the scene so I appreciate
[28:10] brothers that coming and singing to an
[28:12] empty congregation except for sister
[28:15] matisse who also sang for you and
[28:17] appreciate Micah playing for us today
[28:19] it's unusual times that we live in but
[28:23] we knew unusual times were coming
[28:26] friends we we knew by the scripture by
[28:29] what brother Branham taught us that
[28:31] unusual times were going to come we
[28:34] didn't know who of us would be alive to
[28:36] see these things unfolding but we happen
[28:39] to be a part of that generation that we
[28:41] see these things so the unfolding are
[28:43] beginning to unfold I guess more rapidly
[28:46] actually so we are a part of it and just
[28:50] put our shoulder to the wheel and do
[28:51] what we can for the Lord Jesus and
[28:53] hopefully for too long we just get past
[28:59] this point we can all come together and
[29:00] be together in fellowship again around
[29:02] God's Word you know brother Branham said
[29:05] many many years ago and I've said it
[29:07] several times I actually said it last
[29:09] Sunday when I was ministering for vaio
[29:10] the pastor brother Richard Boatwright in
[29:12] North Carolina said you know we might
[29:15] not have this opportunity and be able to
[29:17] meet like this together again and we
[29:20] sure come to fruition amen I don't
[29:24] believe that church doors are closed but
[29:25] it sure come to fruition that you know
[29:28] each day each week is unfolding things
[29:31] that you know I guess people a lot of
[29:33] people in the world in this country
[29:35] might never thought was going to happen
[29:37] the history over a few hundred
[29:41] is quite outstanding considering a
[29:45] hundred times more people that died from
[29:47] the flu in the United States every year
[29:48] but it's all for a reason it's all for a
[29:51] purpose and again I believe it's all in
[29:54] God's hands we're going to continue to
[29:56] press about it
[29:57] hey man I'm continued to do what the
[29:58] Lord to put on a heart now we left off
[30:02] last time but don't forget your
[30:05] scripture reading to Psalms 56 11 don't
[30:08] forget that I've got another one too but
[30:10] that I'm gonna want to give to you today
[30:11] but we had ended up last time on the
[30:15] mysteries of Christ in God or myth
[30:18] Christ the mystery God revealed and
[30:20] finally got that mystery and the
[30:22] singularity of that mystery that's
[30:23] hidden Jesus and the necessity of
[30:27] revelation to bring about the
[30:29] understanding of mystery in our in the
[30:32] scripture and in our lives but when I
[30:35] was praying on it and and I I sent you
[30:38] all the text and told you there was some
[30:40] things I was going to do today that the
[30:42] Lord stopped me from doing and I'll
[30:44] explain it all to you later when we can
[30:46] talk lip to ear but I just want you to
[30:49] know that there's some things that that
[30:52] I want to talk to you about that that
[30:54] kind of switched me and changed my gears
[30:56] if you will and I'm I had on my heart
[31:01] from the beginning of the year to enter
[31:02] into a series it's not going to be long
[31:04] Lord willing but enter into something of
[31:06] teaching to bring us into the Easter
[31:09] time so that's what I want to start on
[31:11] today is getting into this particular
[31:14] subject that will bring us into Easter
[31:18] time made by the grace of God we can
[31:20] meet together at Easter but if we can't
[31:22] then we'll be here doing the bidding of
[31:24] the Lord so that's what we want to do so
[31:26] we want to start on this today so I want
[31:28] to go into Romans chapter 8 and begin
[31:32] with verse 28 and that's where I want to
[31:35] start Marini today
[31:43] we'll get to the board here in a little
[31:46] bit it won't be anything that most of
[31:48] youth not only be haven't already seen
[31:49] but sometimes I like to bring up an
[31:51] illustration it makes a little plainer
[31:53] but we're going to go to Romans chapter
[31:55] 8 verse 28 I'm going to begin to talk
[31:57] about being justified or justification
[32:00] so as we find that in the scripture now
[32:03] let's just bow our heads if we could you
[32:04] at home
[32:05] forward prayer Lord Jesus father were so
[32:08] thankful today God that you give us
[32:10] again another beautiful day to come to
[32:12] worship you and expect you Lord once
[32:14] again to speak to our hearts and lives
[32:16] Lord may you take control over us Lord
[32:19] may you can take control over my lips of
[32:21] our spirit Lord anoint us wherever we
[32:23] are God we don't have to be in these
[32:25] four walls for you to comment for your
[32:27] anointing to be powerful and the
[32:30] supernatural to enter into our living
[32:32] rooms our homes wherever we are and Lord
[32:34] we believe in the name of Jesus Christ
[32:36] that you keep us healthy and strong and
[32:38] purposeful for your glory and honor God
[32:41] for Lord we know that what we do we do
[32:43] for you and lord I pray that God is you
[32:46] do for us we continue to press this
[32:48] battle and continue to stay on the
[32:50] frontlines of this war that we're at
[32:52] with the devil and all of the things
[32:54] that's happening in this world today god
[32:56] we know that there's chaos going on
[32:58] around going through the airport seeing
[33:01] people everywhere with gloves and masks
[33:03] and just reminded me of what a world of
[33:05] fear looks like when people don't have
[33:08] God I'm so thankful that we have you
[33:10] Lord Jesus you can be our mask you can
[33:13] be our gloves gifts Lord you had job
[33:16] hedged about Lord and he was perfectly
[33:18] impenetrable until you let it down
[33:21] when you let it down you let it down for
[33:24] a reason and Lord Joe come to find out
[33:26] that reason and it meant something to
[33:28] him and I believe it does to us today so
[33:30] keep us edged about Lord from all the
[33:33] things that's going on in this world and
[33:34] the diseases and afflictions Lord we
[33:37] will not be afraid we thank you God for
[33:40] your word and for the revelation of your
[33:42] word and for opening this to us once
[33:44] again we committed to you and ask your
[33:46] blessings upon
[33:48] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ move
[33:49] upon every request every need and the
[33:52] people they're listening in at home that
[33:53] we commit them to you in the name of the
[33:55] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen praise
[33:59] the Lord
[34:00] let's read Romans beginning Romans eight
[34:03] beginning with the 28th verse now and we
[34:07] know that all things work together for
[34:09] good to them that love God to them who
[34:12] are the called according to his purpose
[34:15] for whom he did foreknow he also did
[34:18] predestinate to be conformed to the
[34:21] image of his son that he might be the
[34:24] firstborn among many brethren moreover
[34:28] whom he did predestinate them he also
[34:31] called and whom he called them he also
[34:34] justified and then and whom he justified
[34:38] them he also glorified
[34:40] what shall we then say to these things
[34:43] if God be for us who can be against us
[34:46] he that spared not his own son but
[34:49] delivered him up for us all how shall we
[34:52] not with him also freely give us all
[34:55] things
[34:56] who shall blame who shall lay anything
[35:00] to the charge of God's elect it is God
[35:03] that justifies you can be seated if you
[35:06] like a man if you're standing at home
[35:09] those here in the congregation Amen and
[35:13] wherever it is in the comforts of your
[35:14] home now this scripture reading is very
[35:17] familiar scripture reading to all of us
[35:20] I've read it many many times I actually
[35:22] put the scripture reading in my book I
[35:24] think it's a very paramount scripture
[35:26] reading that we have to understand the
[35:28] things that God does for and in our
[35:30] lives and of course working all things
[35:33] together for our good but once you get
[35:35] past the part of understanding that God
[35:37] allows things to happen in our lives
[35:40] that will work together for our good if
[35:42] we love him doesn't work if we don't
[35:45] love him now if we have a passing fancy
[35:47] for the Lord we just have some sort of
[35:49] affinity for the Lord it doesn't work
[35:51] but if you love God the way he loves us
[35:54] in
[35:55] you know love then it will work so
[35:58] regardless of what comes regardless what
[36:00] comes may go God always works those
[36:04] things together for those that love him
[36:06] and I believe that we love the Lord we
[36:10] stand together love the Lord according
[36:12] and we do that because it's according to
[36:15] his purpose there's the rub that a lot
[36:17] of people have a lot of people want the
[36:19] things that happen in their lives and
[36:21] things that happen in the world they
[36:22] want it to be according to their purpose
[36:24] and not according to God's purpose they
[36:26] wanted to be fulfilling their desires
[36:29] who are fulfilling their purpose or
[36:30] fulfilling their will
[36:32] we're not here to fulfill our will we're
[36:34] here to fulfill the will of the Lord
[36:35] we're wilded we're here to do the
[36:37] beating in the will of the Lord not by
[36:39] our bidding
[36:39] not our own will but his purpose we are
[36:42] called to his purpose for whom he did
[36:46] foreknow when the foreknowledge of God
[36:48] he did all and also did predestinate so
[36:53] we see that predestination is by
[36:55] foreknowledge to be conformed we are to
[36:59] be conformed to the image of his son
[37:00] there's a way that confirmation that
[37:02] conforming takes place something has to
[37:06] happen in our lives that brings that
[37:08] conforming it doesn't just happen by the
[37:11] snap of a finger it doesn't just happen
[37:13] by God coming and beating you over the
[37:15] head with a baseball bat it comes with a
[37:17] willing subject who desires the things
[37:20] of God the willing heart God can move on
[37:23] a willing heart God can do something
[37:25] with and it has to be somebody that has
[37:28] a willing heart to do it we'll see in
[37:30] our picture drawing here in just a few
[37:33] minutes takes a willing heart for some
[37:35] for God to move on someone's life he did
[37:39] predestinate he called that he might be
[37:43] the first let's go back scuse me to be
[37:45] conformed to the image of his sons we're
[37:49] to be conformed to the image confirms
[37:57] all iock situation
[37:59] that many brethren it wasn't just Jesus
[38:01] once all that was in Jesus but all that
[38:03] was in Jesus is now poured in his bride
[38:06] poured in his people poured in his chose
[38:08] imported he's bought poured into his
[38:11] predestinated and those are the ones
[38:13] that come to the conforming of the image
[38:16] of Jesus Christ those are the ones that
[38:18] God has brought to the place the
[38:20] predestination to them he is called he
[38:24] is to whom he is called he is also
[38:26] justified and now that's the first step
[38:29] of this confirmation being justified is
[38:33] the first place of getting to so that
[38:36] this conforming can take place to them
[38:39] that are justified and whom he justified
[38:41] them he also glorified
[38:44] now what a major or look at that were
[38:48] justified now I know probably in message
[38:52] ranks people don't think very highly
[38:55] about listening to a message of
[38:56] justification oh that was that was
[38:58] Luther's message Luther came with a
[39:01] message of justification very true but
[39:03] that message of justification rolled
[39:05] over into the message of sanctification
[39:08] by Wesley and the justification
[39:10] sanctification rolled over into the new
[39:13] the the restoration of the gifts and the
[39:16] new birth bringing in the this last day
[39:20] of the time with this bride is going is
[39:23] conforming into his image to go into a
[39:26] rapture and the image of Jesus Christ
[39:28] who is the word is what this word what
[39:32] this people what this bride is becoming
[39:34] we're becoming the word becoming
[39:36] conformed into that image if you're
[39:39] conforming to the image of Jesus Christ
[39:41] you're conforming to the word because
[39:43] that's not that's what the word does
[39:45] justifying is the beginning of that of
[39:48] that conforming you have to be justified
[39:50] first now as we know brother man talked
[39:54] about justification to being justified
[39:56] that's the first work of grace that's
[39:59] the beginning of it see but that
[40:01] justification is very important to
[40:03] understand brother Branham brings it in
[40:05] reference to the church
[40:07] ages and the church being justified as a
[40:10] whole as a part of the at the bride of
[40:13] Jesus Christ down through the ages that
[40:16] justification was was the church being
[40:19] justified as that church was justified
[40:22] that church wedded to sanctification
[40:24] that church went into the Holy Ghost it
[40:27] took one step at a time but now for each
[40:30] individual we each individual have to
[40:34] cross the same path that that church
[40:36] does but first be justified and if
[40:40] you've been justified and you've been
[40:43] sanctified and you have the Holy Ghost
[40:45] and you've been born again and filled
[40:47] with the Spirit of God then that puts
[40:49] you in relationship or one with Jesus
[40:52] Christ now that doesn't when God
[40:56] justifies you you're justified we'll
[40:59] talk about that justification in a
[41:00] minute and excuse me I meant to I meant
[41:05] to start this as a recording here I
[41:07] still was planning on recording this as
[41:09] I normally do for anybody that would
[41:11] want to CDs or something like that but I
[41:14] wanted to do that but in justification
[41:17] to be justified there's there's people
[41:21] that reach the place of this
[41:23] justification now that's the beginning
[41:25] it's not the end but if you receive
[41:29] sanctification let's say you've been
[41:31] justified and you get sanctified but you
[41:34] don't throw justification out the door
[41:36] just because you've reached a place of
[41:38] sanctification doesn't do away with
[41:40] justification in your life just because
[41:44] you reach the place of being born again
[41:46] and filled with the Spirit of God you
[41:47] don't throw away justification you don't
[41:50] throw away sanctification those are all
[41:53] still apart you say oh that's that
[41:56] that's that that's old news we've we've
[41:58] been born to give it's you had to be
[42:00] justified before you can become Lord
[42:02] again and if you don't understand what
[42:05] justification means in your life and how
[42:07] poor it it is it was so important
[42:12] brother branham took a very prominent
[42:15] part of a service in 1919 sixty-five to
[42:20] explain it to us that they must have
[42:23] been pretty important
[42:24] he didn't leave it off he brought it on
[42:27] with us that we could understand where
[42:30] we're standing in Jesus Christ this
[42:32] helps us to understand just
[42:35] justification helps us understand who we
[42:38] are in Christ if we can't get to the
[42:43] place if we know who we are then were we
[42:45] going to be were just we're just
[42:47] following around in this world just
[42:49] slopping around in the world just going
[42:51] about our daily lives but friend I'm
[42:53] ready to go home I've got more on the
[42:57] other side now believe now the other
[42:58] side I got here as far as natural life
[43:02] birth I got a son I got a dad a mom and
[43:04] my brother and my sister and different
[43:06] ones they're all said they're waiting on
[43:08] me I told my mama said Wednesday night
[43:12] when I got to see her before she passed
[43:14] next morning I said now make sure y'all
[43:16] gonna have too big of a homecoming
[43:17] without me now I'm not too far away just
[43:20] hold on for me I'll be there won't be
[43:22] too long have a nice celebration enjoy
[43:25] one another but don't have too big a
[43:27] family review just yet I'm coming just
[43:30] be a little patient but it but to
[43:33] understand that we want to get to that
[43:36] place begins with this single step of
[43:39] justification to whom he called he
[43:42] justified
[43:44] let me just spot them he also glorified
[43:47] now can you be justified without being
[43:49] sanctified absolutely can you be
[43:52] justified and sanctified without having
[43:54] the Holy Ghost absolutely right I think
[43:55] that's one of the worst danger spots
[43:57] that there are yes brother branham tells
[43:59] us and that's where Judas was he was but
[44:02] he was between sanctification and and
[44:05] the Holy Ghost because he couldn't go to
[44:06] the upper room never enter the upper
[44:08] room killed himself
[44:09] but he was stuck in that position
[44:11] between sanctification and Holy Ghost
[44:13] you can absolutely be justified
[44:16] righteous sanctified cleaned up before
[44:19] before having the Holy Ghost but the
[44:22] justification the justification doesn't
[44:25] go away
[44:25] just because you've been born again
[44:27] mm-hmm amen
[44:29] justification is is it is just like
[44:32] sanctification is a perpetual working of
[44:36] our daily lives justification and
[44:39] sanctification continue to work in our
[44:42] lives
[44:43] every day now I took this subject
[44:46] because I want to talk about something
[44:49] the Lord willing in a probably next week
[44:51] that that that brother Ram said and that
[44:55] brother hadn't brought up that was
[44:56] that's kind of controversial and some
[45:00] people have misunderstood or not as good
[45:02] or even misinterpreted in my humble
[45:06] opinion what he meant by what he said
[45:08] that's a little teaser for you I'm not
[45:11] going to get in that today Lord willing
[45:12] next week I want to just laid the
[45:14] foundation of justification for right
[45:17] now those he called he justified
[45:19] let me justified you glorified and what
[45:23] shall we say then if God be for us who
[45:24] can be against us you go down who can
[45:26] lay anything to the charge listen them
[45:29] who can lay anything to the charge of
[45:33] God's elect it is God that justified if
[45:38] you were in God and God has justified
[45:41] you he has cleans your slate justified
[45:46] means let me just look it up here for
[45:48] you just a minute I got it pulled up
[45:49] justify in the Greek is to be freed amen
[45:55] to be liberated to be freed to have that
[45:58] that that burden of sin taken off of you
[46:02] because Jesus died to take that sin off
[46:06] of you to be free to be liberated to be
[46:09] righteous amen you understand you can't
[46:14] be righteous without being justified but
[46:16] being justified puts her
[46:18] of righteousness with God now there's
[46:21] more to it there's of course the growing
[46:22] from there but that's the place of
[46:24] righteousness that God wants us to be
[46:26] because justification is what takes that
[46:29] sin from you justification is what takes
[46:34] the sin off of you
[46:35] that's what relieves you of all of your
[46:37] wrongdoing and all of your past sin and
[46:39] all of the things that we make mistakes
[46:41] we make today the the mistakes we made
[46:45] today God cleanses through his blood by
[46:48] the process of justifying you and the
[46:51] only way we can be justified by faith
[46:53] you've got to believe it it's got to be
[46:56] by faith mine isn't that just becoming
[46:59] quite a separation point now between
[47:01] between having faith and not having
[47:04] faith now I believe in using wisdom by
[47:07] the grace of God we use wisdom in all
[47:08] this right that's why we just have what
[47:12] we got here now we use wisdom and
[47:14] everything that we do a lot of the
[47:16] wisdom that is given is practical use
[47:19] things like the pamphlet that Micah gave
[47:21] to us couple weeks ago is practical use
[47:24] things it's washing your hands and
[47:26] staying clean and staying sanitary and
[47:29] things like that
[47:29] no don't going over the top to do things
[47:33] even Micah was telling me who we were in
[47:35] North Carolina we stayed in a hotel and
[47:39] of course restaurants were closed so we
[47:41] had to go get food and bring it and eat
[47:43] in the lobby oh because we hate the
[47:46] lobby instead of going all the way
[47:47] upstairs we just go to the bathroom
[47:48] there in the lobby and mike was telling
[47:50] me one time then he went to go wash his
[47:52] hands and he was coming out or there was
[47:55] another guy coming out that somebody had
[47:59] been in the restroom there and had used
[48:01] facilities and did not wash his hands
[48:04] before he left the restroom when I mean
[48:07] outside of that being just horribly
[48:10] disgusting it gross why under the
[48:13] conditions that we're living now would
[48:15] you leave the restroom without washing
[48:17] your hands as people still do it but
[48:20] it's just common sense stuff washing
[48:23] your hands being sanitary dude doing
[48:25] things that
[48:26] that keep it clean I guess we're going
[48:29] to end up like the Chinese into this bow
[48:31] at each other we can't we're not
[48:33] supposed to shake hands anymore
[48:35] I don't know if I'll ever get to that
[48:37] place that's too much of a habit of mine
[48:39] to shake people's hands I think that's
[48:40] one of the friendliest gestures
[48:42] humanity's known is shaped in persons
[48:44] hands but the Chinese
[48:45] they always bow to each other Chinese
[48:47] and Japanese that's what they do so we
[48:49] have to keep that distance but the
[48:50] strange thing about it is that Chinese
[48:52] practice the bowing and that's where all
[48:54] the viruses come from explain that to me
[48:59] justification to be righteous to be
[49:03] righteous you have to know that you are
[49:05] the righteousness of Jesus Christ to
[49:09] render righteous or such as he ought to
[49:12] be and think about that we've made that
[49:15] statement here many times not reading
[49:17] the definition of justification but the
[49:20] state of someone and how they ought to
[49:25] me to be in here ought to be condition
[49:28] what does it mean to be in here ought to
[49:30] be condition it means that you're in the
[49:33] place spiritually or God saw you in his
[49:36] mind before the foundation of the world
[49:38] before sin ever entered in the camp
[49:40] before the fall of the Garden of Eden
[49:42] God had you in his mind and that perfect
[49:46] place that perfect position that God saw
[49:49] you is exactly where God is taking us
[49:51] back to because that's who we really are
[49:54] we're not this sinful shell of a human
[49:57] that God put us in these time bodies we
[49:59] are that righteous holy person the seen
[50:02] of God that he's put in us that he saw
[50:05] us before the foundation of the world
[50:07] justification brings us into that vision
[50:12] justification brings us into that place
[50:15] where we can truly see what God has done
[50:17] for us who we are in him for the
[50:22] righteousness of Jesus Christ it puts us
[50:25] in our ought to be condition now does
[50:27] that do away the stickiness of this
[50:29] flesh absolutely not no sir we still
[50:31] have the stickiness of the flesh
[50:33] still good are we gonna be dealing with
[50:34] that until the the to wit the redemption
[50:37] of these bodies right that's that's the
[50:40] only thing is gonna change it's still
[50:42] gonna be stinky yes amen
[50:45] but we're still that doesn't change the
[50:48] fact of what God has done the stickiness
[50:51] of your flesh does not nullify
[50:53] justification it doesn't do away with
[50:56] the fact that when God justified you he
[50:59] wipes your slate clean
[51:01] he made you what he saw you before the
[51:05] foundation of the world
[51:06] that's justification that's wiping it
[51:09] all clean now I'm gonna turn this around
[51:14] forgot my board so I'm sorry but
[51:17] fortunately I found one that they had
[51:19] here I found a board that they had here
[51:23] in the back I guess teach the kids that
[51:25] I couldn't have them you see that we
[51:27] have the body spirit and soul again that
[51:30] I draw this is one of my favorite
[51:32] teachings if you will that I that I like
[51:35] to get into because to me this explains
[51:37] a lot then this shows a lot too to us
[51:42] that it can be revealed to us
[51:44] where we are and the separation of
[51:47] Understanding between the soul and the
[51:49] spirit of the body it brings things in a
[51:52] greater light but now in the soul we can
[51:56] look and brother brown one time drew the
[52:03] human heart and when we're born we're
[52:07] born in this condition now I know that
[52:12] doesn't look like it but that's supposed
[52:13] to be a snake so you know me I'm not an
[52:16] artist but it helps us see that the
[52:21] condition that were born in and who we
[52:23] are today we were born with a snake
[52:27] nature now I want to go to another
[52:29] scripture before we get fully into that
[52:31] and fusions chapter 2
[52:40] just again lay that foundation of
[52:43] justification to lay that foundation of
[52:47] what God has done for us and where it
[52:50] has put us if you've been justified
[52:53] you've been justified by God it's God
[52:57] that justify us we just read that other
[53:00] people may desire to or want to dig up
[53:04] sins from the past things you may have
[53:05] done wrong but that's the devil God does
[53:09] God's not the shovel business God's not
[53:12] the digging business God's in the saving
[53:14] business God's in the healing business
[53:16] and that's what he does so if you want
[53:21] to lay charge do anything of God's elect
[53:24] then you've got to talk to my boss about
[53:26] that but let's go to Ephesians chapter 2
[53:31] verse 1 Ephesians 2:1 and you had the
[53:36] quickened that is made alive who were
[53:40] dead in trespasses and sins so you were
[53:43] dead in your trespasses and sins but now
[53:46] you've been made alive wherein in time
[53:49] past in your old life you walked
[53:53] according to the course of this world we
[53:56] all did it that's how we were born
[53:59] according to the Prince of the power of
[54:01] the air Satan the spirit that now
[54:04] worketh in the children of disobedience
[54:06] so there's those that are still of the
[54:08] disobedience those that are led by the
[54:11] devil to do the bidding of Satan among
[54:16] whom also we all had our conversation in
[54:20] time pass in the lust of our flesh
[54:23] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[54:25] of the mind which is the Spirit of the
[54:29] mind and we're by nature the children of
[54:32] Wrath so I want you to see that Spitzer
[54:35] brings in few this drawing now let's
[54:40] read the third verse again among them
[54:43] also we all had our Commerce
[54:44] the loss of our flesh the body the outer
[54:48] man fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[54:52] and of the mind the spirit brings in the
[54:58] the second person in our try unity of
[55:00] our our beans desires of the flesh and
[55:04] of the mind and we're by nature the
[55:08] children of Raptor where's your nature
[55:10] your nature's in your soul your nature
[55:14] is the sole objective the your soul is
[55:16] the nature of your spirit your spirit is
[55:19] the life of your body so by so by
[55:22] fulfilling the desires of the flesh the
[55:26] body and the mind the spirit and we're
[55:29] by nature in your soul the children of
[55:32] Wrath so your very desire in your soul
[55:35] the very desire of your heart but that
[55:37] state nature was to do wrong was to be
[55:41] children of disobedience to lie steal
[55:44] cheat whatever attributes you can put to
[55:47] what scene is which is just unbelief
[55:50] that snake nature is what we are all
[55:53] born with if you're one of us were born
[55:55] with that sake that snake nature our
[55:57] nature commanded us to live our nature
[56:00] commanded us to steal our nature
[56:02] commanded us to do things that were
[56:04] against God in his word you see a little
[56:07] kid
[56:08] many parents the experience is probably
[56:12] every parent has experienced this your
[56:13] child is old enough you may have done
[56:16] this with you a child not a celeb over
[56:18] break some on the floor mom and dad
[56:21] comes in and says Johnny who broke that
[56:24] lamp I don't know but what do you mean
[56:28] you don't know you're the only one here
[56:31] here our only child there's no other
[56:33] human in the building
[56:34] but broke it I don't know that's just
[56:39] just nature to do he's lying he knows
[56:42] he's lying but it because he's conscious
[56:45] of that because the spirit makes in
[56:47] conscience of the fact that he's not
[56:49] telling the truth - he's old enough but
[56:51] that conscious there is nothing in a
[56:54] place to understand
[56:55] ready for cousin of what he's doing and
[56:58] and just like but he's born that way we
[57:01] were all born that way we're all born to
[57:03] lie it came from my very desire from
[57:06] that very snake nature to lie to steal
[57:09] to cheat I mean you said well a squirrel
[57:14] came through the door and ran up on the
[57:15] table and knocked the lamp over ran back
[57:17] out the door nobody taught him to do
[57:20] that hopefully nobody told him to do
[57:23] that hard to tell nowadays the parents
[57:25] but hopefully nobody told him to do that
[57:28] it didn't why is this in his nature to
[57:30] live and just who he is to light happens
[57:33] for the fall in the beginning we're all
[57:35] born by nature the children of Wrath
[57:38] that's what our nature taught us to do
[57:40] and our nature which is our sole natures
[57:46] itself out to the Spirit which is our
[57:48] conscience imagination reason affection
[57:50] memory it affects that spirit which is
[57:53] the life of the body which comes into
[57:55] our see taste fuel smell in here the
[57:56] context of this world all of that just
[57:59] runs in continuity together now when you
[58:01] become a Christian does the same thing
[58:03] run some continuity with every bit of it
[58:05] when that nature has changed and God
[58:07] comes in your heart let's just draw
[58:09] another than you won't believe that now
[58:16] when when God comes in there then the
[58:19] same thing happens if God's nature's in
[58:21] there and that seed that is in there
[58:23] that little dots to see you God pure
[58:25] born to you predestinated foreknowledge
[58:27] we just read it here the foreknowledge
[58:29] predestination your predestinated you're
[58:32] gonna come to that place to understand
[58:33] that seat is in there it's going to come
[58:35] to light that's God well what it does is
[58:38] it burns out that old nature and God
[58:40] comes in there you have that place here
[58:43] though before it's still empty amen we
[58:46] not gonna really make your own that but
[58:49] understand that when God comes in and
[58:51] justifies you he takes that out of there
[58:55] there you are you're clean
[58:57] you're righteous justified and so you've
[59:00] never done it in the first place but
[59:03] you're not truly
[59:04] until he comes and identifies himself
[59:07] with you by putting himself in you
[59:10] that's women and now that's when God
[59:13] takes control over this being now we
[59:16] still have free will understand we still
[59:19] have free will but God takes over that
[59:21] free will and we had that free will
[59:24] though in our soul but then that that
[59:26] light that's in there overtakes her
[59:29] conscience imagination reason face cream
[59:31] which also takes control of the body see
[59:33] taste feel smell hear all those things
[59:35] take and it all becomes in subjection to
[59:38] God it all becomes the the the the image
[59:43] the projection the expression of God
[59:46] that's who we've become
[59:48] we are the expression of God that
[59:51] expression stays in as we are here shell
[59:55] stays the same but the expression that's
[59:58] in there that all changes then they read
[1:00:02] you something here a couple of quotes I
[1:00:06] got now this is a thinking man's filter
[1:00:10] in thinking man's filter he says when
[1:00:14] you come in this world you were born in
[1:00:17] sin you didn't even come with a fighting
[1:00:19] chance think about that we didn't even
[1:00:22] come into this world with a fighting
[1:00:24] chance you are born in sin shaped in
[1:00:27] iniquity and come into this world
[1:00:29] speaking lines within your own spirit
[1:00:32] think of that now as we just had this
[1:00:35] within your own spirit much less your
[1:00:37] body your own spirit was the desire of
[1:00:41] sin mine a lover of sin because you were
[1:00:46] born in sin you get to have a chance
[1:00:50] think about that from the very beginning
[1:00:52] and the fall the Garden of Eden everyone
[1:00:54] come after has been come with a fallen
[1:00:56] nature you didn't even have a chance but
[1:01:00] down inside of you somewhere that's that
[1:01:03] little seed now amen go back to first
[1:01:06] John chapter 3 you'll see that
[1:01:08] again we've read it many times you go
[1:01:10] back and find that seat down inside that
[1:01:13] cedar in there somewhere here you come
[1:01:16] see here you come not this guy
[1:01:20] not this body not this spirit but you
[1:01:22] you are that seat praise the Lord
[1:01:26] that's the real you brother Graham said
[1:01:28] here you come now we're down on the
[1:01:31] inside of the inside down inside of you
[1:01:34] somewhere here you come Amen praise the
[1:01:38] Lord I'm so glad this isn't me this is
[1:01:41] just a house to show that God has put me
[1:01:44] in but but I am who he has made me that
[1:01:48] seed which is part of him and actually
[1:01:50] the thought before the foundation world
[1:01:52] any of that's who we are
[1:01:53] they've been praise the Lord that
[1:01:56] process of justification has to come
[1:02:00] first to bring us into the reality of
[1:02:03] understanding that's who we are
[1:02:06] I was never this I was never this I was
[1:02:12] never a sinner I was never a roustabout
[1:02:15] and a liar and a thief and all this
[1:02:17] stuff
[1:02:18] I was never that understand I'm not
[1:02:23] being that that was never you to begin
[1:02:26] with you are in here
[1:02:29] yeah pretty good Bachman so thankful
[1:02:33] with God help us understand all those
[1:02:35] things that's what justification is
[1:02:36] remember when one random said if you
[1:02:39] never did it in the first place that's
[1:02:40] not a vigorous speech right that's a
[1:02:43] literal of happening from the scripture
[1:02:49] in your life you never did it in the
[1:02:51] first place what does that mean your
[1:02:53] slate is clean in the mind of God you
[1:02:56] never did it
[1:02:57] that was never you principle this was
[1:03:02] always you that see that German there
[1:03:05] was what he is what you are that's
[1:03:08] always been you that's the way God sees
[1:03:10] us praise the Lord I'm glad that's the
[1:03:13] way God sees us
[1:03:16] about what I see in the morning I like
[1:03:19] grooming myself and you have to partner
[1:03:21] a little shaggy this year I my barbers
[1:03:26] postponed our appointment so I'm
[1:03:28] supposed to give a haircut Friday but my
[1:03:30] barber postponed my appointment but
[1:03:32] anyway and we grew when we take care of
[1:03:34] ourselves but I'm concerned about the
[1:03:35] guy in the mirror I'm concerned about
[1:03:37] what I look like he got smeared right in
[1:03:39] God's eyes what does God see what is God
[1:03:43] looking at what is God interested in
[1:03:46] he's not interested in those little
[1:03:48] petty things what he's interested in is
[1:03:51] this in the middle that actually that
[1:03:54] see that thought that God was might want
[1:03:57] to get into that box event we're gonna
[1:03:59] do that in our next when we get back up
[1:04:00] to that to Christ and mystery God
[1:04:02] revealed again a man that lo box that
[1:04:05] thought that come out of God the
[1:04:07] condescending of God bringing himself
[1:04:09] into the understanding that us little he
[1:04:11] bring humans can understand but God in
[1:04:14] there that that that seed was God was
[1:04:17] there he says here again there you come
[1:04:20] he meant that's us there was something
[1:04:24] in there that begin to draw if you note
[1:04:27] it was something that told you there was
[1:04:29] a god somewhere and you read his word
[1:04:32] then you took the church and you took
[1:04:35] their ideas when he was told better do
[1:04:37] you never use the thinking man's filter
[1:04:39] but when we use the thinking man's
[1:04:41] filter all other filters had to pass
[1:04:44] away what is that that's God's Word the
[1:04:47] truth of God's Word God's thinking man's
[1:04:49] filter but minds shall not and when you
[1:04:53] take God's closer and drawed your life
[1:04:55] your desires if you draw your desires
[1:04:58] through God's filter now you've changed
[1:05:01] and that that seed of you became that
[1:05:03] see that you were there that was dormant
[1:05:05] at the time it came real and began to
[1:05:08] overtake and control your spirit of your
[1:05:10] body became you this is a still a shell
[1:05:14] but it's more of an evidence of who I
[1:05:16] really am my life now is in heaven
[1:05:19] who I always was not that guy back 4050
[1:05:23] years ago whenever not that guy this guy
[1:05:26] is becoming more in that image because
[1:05:28] God taking over see if you draw your
[1:05:31] desires through God's filter his word at
[1:05:34] thank you miss filtered there's nothing
[1:05:36] left with the Holy Ghost amen
[1:05:39] nothing left but the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:05:41] Ghost is what takes control over it
[1:05:43] the Holy Ghost is that this is what's so
[1:05:46] important about understanding that new
[1:05:49] birth the Holy Ghost that's why that's
[1:05:53] why Jesus told Nicodemus you must be
[1:05:56] born again
[1:05:57] that's why everything we talked about
[1:05:59] last time agree here and the revelation
[1:06:01] that God gives the mystery is to those
[1:06:04] that have the Spirit of God those that
[1:06:07] are born again not some anointing not
[1:06:09] some gift we're not talking about gifts
[1:06:12] we're not talking about prophecies and
[1:06:14] ministry we're talking about God and
[1:06:17] God's Spirit and His Holy Ghost living
[1:06:20] in you that's what we're talking about
[1:06:22] not some gift or some gifts and callings
[1:06:25] and without repentance Devils witches
[1:06:28] and warlocks have all kinds of gifts
[1:06:30] they talk about skiing things that's not
[1:06:32] what we're talking about we're talking
[1:06:34] about you've got that spirit of you
[1:06:38] that's where the breaking point is
[1:06:40] that's where the revelation comes
[1:06:42] revelation doesn't come unless you've
[1:06:44] been born again revelation doesn't come
[1:06:46] not the revelation from God if God
[1:06:49] doesn't look if God has not identified
[1:06:51] himself with you I'm kind of crossing
[1:06:53] over to the other subject for a minute
[1:06:56] but if God doesn't if he doesn't come
[1:06:58] and identify you by putting himself in
[1:07:02] you by buying that Holy Spirit common
[1:07:05] now taking it's full of ugly stealing
[1:07:07] himself in there if God doesn't do that
[1:07:10] God has not identified himself with you
[1:07:13] no matter how much you've identified
[1:07:15] yourself with him if he has now
[1:07:17] identified himself
[1:07:20] why would he ever give a revelation to
[1:07:22] you now there might be something that
[1:07:25] comes along then like like the devil did
[1:07:28] in the Garden of Eden the devil gave me
[1:07:30] the revelation he meant and in that
[1:07:33] revelation caused the whole world to
[1:07:35] fall into the chaotic state granted a
[1:07:37] common 9pt seems fault sorry yes that's
[1:07:42] where the fall began in the beginning
[1:07:43] Amen she was deceived into it and we'll
[1:07:47] get to that that's part of what I want
[1:07:48] to talk about and Lord willing we'll do
[1:07:50] next week but she was deceived into
[1:07:52] doing it there's a difference in being
[1:07:54] deceived into doing something and doing
[1:07:56] something willfully right he'd never did
[1:07:59] it willfully she was deceived into doing
[1:08:01] it but she did it by a revelation from
[1:08:04] the devil not from God but from the but
[1:08:07] from the devil that's where she got that
[1:08:09] revelation from and you see what
[1:08:11] happened so you said well yeah the
[1:08:13] revelation can cut that can come from
[1:08:14] the devil
[1:08:15] and that revelation can be 99% of the
[1:08:18] truth but a revelation that contains 99%
[1:08:22] of the truth is not a revelation from
[1:08:24] God God works in purity holiness
[1:08:27] righteousness one hundred percent not 99
[1:08:32] percent 100 percent why Christ speak
[1:08:38] what if we had alysha's drop down a
[1:08:41] little bit this is why cry speak in
[1:08:44] October 1959 he said now God is not
[1:08:47] going to hold a man this is where I'm
[1:08:49] going to get to we just left this off
[1:08:51] listen now God is not going to hold a
[1:08:54] man responsible because he's a sinner
[1:08:58] think of that could you imagine one of
[1:09:00] your local charismatic church or Baptist
[1:09:02] Church or you imagine saying that on TV
[1:09:04] enter some day star television network
[1:09:07] ed right now hey good job Sam you got a
[1:09:11] five-second delay and off the mouth I
[1:09:13] don't want to hear that because they
[1:09:15] don't believe that but look at the truth
[1:09:17] of it God is not going to hold a man
[1:09:20] responsible because he's a sinner
[1:09:22] why is he not gonna hold us be
[1:09:25] being a sinner because that's the way we
[1:09:28] were born we didn't have a choice in the
[1:09:31] matter which born in sin shape iniquity
[1:09:33] come world Sweden lies we didn't have a
[1:09:35] choice right we were all sinners that's
[1:09:37] how we come into the world so why would
[1:09:40] God hold us responsible something that
[1:09:42] we didn't have a choice over but the
[1:09:45] choice comes later
[1:09:46] because he was born a sinner but what
[1:09:50] God is going to hold a man responsible
[1:09:52] for is because that he remains a sinner
[1:09:56] there you go because God has made the
[1:09:59] way of escape and if someone a person
[1:10:02] desires to remain a sinner after God has
[1:10:05] made the way of escape dead God holds
[1:10:07] him responsible if he's come to the age
[1:10:10] of accountability and he knows right and
[1:10:12] wrong and what to do would not do when
[1:10:14] he's got to that what God holds that
[1:10:15] person responsible God will hold the man
[1:10:18] responsible if he remains a sinner he
[1:10:21] don't have to end because he doesn't
[1:10:23] have to remain a center for there is a
[1:10:25] provision made for his justification
[1:10:28] through Jesus Christ
[1:10:31] provision has made for what his
[1:10:35] justification his getting rid of this
[1:10:41] guy so that you have the clean harm Amen
[1:10:48] God will hold a man responsible for
[1:10:50] staying in this condition when Jesus
[1:10:55] Christ has made a way to burn out that
[1:10:59] old nature and for God to be able to
[1:11:02] come in now again we still have this
[1:11:04] sticky area here where you know the
[1:11:08] Bible Matthew tells us that if the
[1:11:10] spirit is gone out of a man and he
[1:11:11] Romans and drop places in that that
[1:11:14] place stays unfilled where God doesn't
[1:11:17] identify himself with that man then that
[1:11:19] old
[1:11:20] comes back in he said Seven Devils worse
[1:11:22] than him right no wonder Jesus said you
[1:11:25] get these proselytes you make them too
[1:11:27] full or Chavo hell Network start with
[1:11:29] why because you put them in this
[1:11:31] position now you got this all these
[1:11:33] Devils in here worse than the first one
[1:11:35] right so that tricky place is right
[1:11:41] there but it's got to come to that place
[1:11:43] first justification God has made a way
[1:11:47] of justification a provision has been
[1:11:50] made for his justification through Jesus
[1:11:53] Christ did the blood of Jesus Christ has
[1:11:55] made a way to cleanse this and to get
[1:11:58] rid of that to annihilate his past-due
[1:12:03] way with all those sins so that the man
[1:12:06] is a new creature in Christ Jesus now
[1:12:10] you know there's got to be the follow-up
[1:12:11] to that but that's what justification
[1:12:13] does now the perpetual work of
[1:12:15] justification brings you to
[1:12:17] understanding that your life stays that
[1:12:20] way
[1:12:21] because as we just read who can lay
[1:12:25] anything to the charge of God's elect
[1:12:29] why would he say that cause God's
[1:12:32] justified right jogs God's justified and
[1:12:35] we live in this state of new birth if
[1:12:38] God is justified then who can lay
[1:12:41] anything to the charge of that person
[1:12:43] said yeah but he did this and he did
[1:12:45] that now see that's another sticky thing
[1:12:47] that people had the justification
[1:12:49] I've heard people and I hate to say that
[1:12:52] I've heard people even in this message
[1:12:54] use that justification wrongly I heard
[1:12:59] one time of a man that was accused of
[1:13:01] something go in before a judge and said
[1:13:04] Judge I never did that and the judge is
[1:13:08] like excuse me I paraphrase don't
[1:13:10] remember a whole story but he's like
[1:13:12] well we had you on video we have
[1:13:14] eyewitnesses everybody here they're
[1:13:16] saying that you did it they saw you
[1:13:19] there's eyewitnesses that prove that you
[1:13:21] did that no judge that ever did it only
[1:13:23] God's eyes you never do if you've been
[1:13:26] charged us to fight and you're living in
[1:13:28] perpetual place of justification yeah
[1:13:31] true you never did it in God's eyes but
[1:13:34] here on the earth you actually did it
[1:13:36] right you understand as a human you did
[1:13:40] it you could have been a drug dealer and
[1:13:44] you could have been selling drugs to a
[1:13:46] man that killed that man and left his
[1:13:49] wife a widow and children without a
[1:13:52] father and you get born again you get
[1:13:56] filled the spirit God justifies you
[1:13:58] wipes that slate clean and God's eyes
[1:14:00] you never did that that never even
[1:14:02] happened not to God Gregor but did you
[1:14:05] go knock on that woman's door and you
[1:14:08] say man I'm here to tell you that I was
[1:14:10] the guy that got you your husband hooked
[1:14:12] up in drugs I was the man that sold into
[1:14:15] drugs I was the one that was responsible
[1:14:16] for him over D and you being a widow you
[1:14:21] know what you're gonna do you're gonna
[1:14:22] walk away from that door with a black
[1:14:24] eye
[1:14:24] and you should but none of you try to
[1:14:27] make it right that's good but if this
[1:14:30] woman comes to she and you try to tell
[1:14:32] her but but I didn't do it well yeah you
[1:14:37] did the result of her widowhood is there
[1:14:41] the result of her fatherless kids are
[1:14:43] there yeah you did it
[1:14:44] but the fact of understanding what God
[1:14:47] is doing circumvents everything else yes
[1:14:53] we own up to our past mistakes and
[1:14:57] understand that we did things wrong
[1:14:59] we understand that brings us into a
[1:15:01] place of perfection with the Lord
[1:15:04] because we don't ever want to be that
[1:15:06] way again or do those things again and
[1:15:08] we clean our life God cleans our lives
[1:15:10] up when we move forward from there
[1:15:11] absolutely but in the flesh it didn't
[1:15:15] happen but in God's eyes it never
[1:15:18] happened so what it says look when it
[1:15:20] says that that that who can lay anything
[1:15:25] to the charge of God's elect it's God
[1:15:27] that justify it then who can put anyone
[1:15:30] I guess in the place
[1:15:32] you did it and you may have to pay the
[1:15:34] consequences for it but in God's eyes
[1:15:36] God says you never did it because God's
[1:15:39] the one that justified the court system
[1:15:42] didn't just fight you the woman that
[1:15:43] sweater now did just for you
[1:15:45] God justified to you if God justified
[1:15:48] you fitting his eyes in his mind you
[1:15:51] never did it now I'd rather be guilty in
[1:15:54] a court of law
[1:15:55] than guilty in God's eyes God said she
[1:15:58] never did it is God who justifies you
[1:16:02] can even go back to like we've done a
[1:16:04] quoted this many times over the past I
[1:16:07] don't know year or so and and this
[1:16:10] scripture I've got to tell you this
[1:16:12] scripture continues to mull in my spirit
[1:16:15] over and over and over romans 4 I
[1:16:17] usually quoted I'm gonna read it today
[1:16:20] Romans 4 8 now David said this to David
[1:16:25] even in the state that he lived in
[1:16:26] before the giving of the Holy Spirit now
[1:16:29] we know he was a man after God's own
[1:16:30] heart and he was the pre figure of Jesus
[1:16:33] to come but David even before the Holy
[1:16:36] Ghost could make this statement but look
[1:16:39] at us today when the spirit is calm the
[1:16:42] blood has been shed Redemption is free
[1:16:48] Romans 4:8 blessed is the man to whom
[1:16:52] the Lord will not impute sin what is
[1:16:56] that word impute mean it needs to
[1:16:58] account to or hold accountable up hold
[1:17:01] accountable to so if there's if if the
[1:17:06] word says that there is a person even if
[1:17:11] there's just whatever in the history of
[1:17:13] humanity now believe there's a board
[1:17:15] because the description says there is
[1:17:17] but even if there's only one there is a
[1:17:19] person that the Lord does not impute are
[1:17:24] hold him accountable for his wrongdoing
[1:17:28] now if the perpetual nature of
[1:17:31] justification did not exist how could
[1:17:34] that word ever be true it's true because
[1:17:38] we are perpetually continually
[1:17:41] justified by God you know why cuz we're
[1:17:45] always continuously perpetually making
[1:17:48] mistakes yes and doing things we
[1:17:50] shouldn't we're always in the place of
[1:17:53] repentance the anointing of the day God
[1:17:57] I'm sorry forgive me Lord it's God that
[1:17:59] justifies who can lay anything to the
[1:18:02] charge of God's elect God's justified
[1:18:05] but as it is the man to whom the Lord
[1:18:07] will not impute you and God does not
[1:18:10] even impute that sin to you even if
[1:18:14] you've done it right it's not imputed to
[1:18:16] you one cuz you're righteous in God's
[1:18:18] eyes
[1:18:19] that perpetuated blood that Jesus shed
[1:18:22] at Calvary still sets there no matter
[1:18:24] how many message preachers try to tell
[1:18:26] you the blood is off the mercy seat let
[1:18:28] me tell you it's their sheep brother
[1:18:31] Bentham said the the prayers of the
[1:18:33] Saints could not even get through to God
[1:18:35] if the blood was off the mercy seat
[1:18:37] greater so you do with that hair you
[1:18:39] want but it is still there and that
[1:18:42] perpetuated blood is a proxy for me yes
[1:18:46] you know what that means it means it
[1:18:47] took my place it sets there and stays
[1:18:50] there in my stead taking my place now if
[1:18:56] it's taking my place what place do I
[1:18:58] take I take the place of Jesus I step
[1:19:02] into the robe of righteousness that
[1:19:04] Jesus through his justification has put
[1:19:07] upon us now we are as righteous as he is
[1:19:10] righteous you say oh that's too much
[1:19:12] brother you
[1:19:13] I'm afraid sometimes we just don't go
[1:19:15] far enough that's the truth of God's
[1:19:17] Bible that's where God wants us to be
[1:19:20] how are we ever going to get to the
[1:19:22] place that we know who we are without
[1:19:23] the understanding of what God has done
[1:19:25] for us and made us to be he wants us to
[1:19:28] be that way he wants us to understand
[1:19:32] that and for that chip knowledge
[1:19:34] purchased an understanding he wants set
[1:19:36] to be a revelation in our minds in our
[1:19:37] hearts if that becomes a revelation you
[1:19:40] know what's gonna happen the rapture is
[1:19:42] gonna take place because brother Graham
[1:19:45] said when this broad comes to know
[1:19:46] she is we're going home I don't know
[1:19:49] what better way to understand them
[1:19:50] that's who we are that's who God is
[1:19:52] madness in his might was his design
[1:19:54] that's what he called for us all along
[1:19:57] forget what you done in the past forget
[1:19:59] what you done yesterday forget what you
[1:20:01] did this morning blasting is the man to
[1:20:04] whom God will not what the Lord will not
[1:20:06] impute sin he does not even hold you a
[1:20:10] callable for it great he's the Lord now
[1:20:14] somebody makes it Michael just do
[1:20:15] whatever I want didn't know that just
[1:20:17] proves that you don't have any what you
[1:20:19] say you do Amen if you just want to go
[1:20:22] out and do whatever you want to and live
[1:20:24] however one life you want to well that
[1:20:26] just shows that you don't have what you
[1:20:28] say you have you have not been justified
[1:20:30] you are not living in a place of
[1:20:33] righteousness if you are righteous and
[1:20:37] you're gonna live a holy consecrated
[1:20:39] line you're not gonna do just whatever
[1:20:42] you want because that brings us in a
[1:20:44] place to say Lord not my will but your
[1:20:46] will be done
[1:20:48] oh it's so is so beautiful things seems
[1:20:55] like so many times they just wanted to
[1:21:00] skip right over justification and then
[1:21:03] not delve in it to see what it means to
[1:21:06] us greatest battle ever fought saying I
[1:21:13] appreciate that that song that come on
[1:21:16] Zack ago the Zacks part about all is
[1:21:18] well I love that song lyrics just
[1:21:24] beautiful
[1:21:25] and then greatest battle ever fought
[1:21:28] which is in that song if you remember
[1:21:31] then what does that do from the middle
[1:21:34] of the heart which is the soul from
[1:21:38] there from there goes for feeding every
[1:21:43] channel now when you were sitting that's
[1:21:47] what it did this you live that life
[1:21:49] because that's the feeding of that
[1:21:50] channel but when you become bored
[1:21:52] and God lives in you then that's what's
[1:21:55] feeding those channels then your
[1:21:57] conscious imagination reason affection
[1:21:59] memory feeds off of that channel feeds
[1:22:01] off of that spirit and when that gets in
[1:22:05] contact it's in line with that spirit
[1:22:08] then that's what affects the see taste
[1:22:09] smell smell here
[1:22:10] that's why would you see the things you
[1:22:13] should feel turn your head when you hear
[1:22:15] things you shouldn't you quit listening
[1:22:17] when going when gossip gets told to you
[1:22:20] you say no I'm fine yours aren't a
[1:22:22] garbage dump I'm not gonna listen to
[1:22:23] that then you you cut it off see you all
[1:22:26] these things are controlled because it's
[1:22:29] it's becoming to the image of Jesus
[1:22:32] Christ praise the Lord feeds every
[1:22:36] channel trouble of it is we're standing
[1:22:38] in here with a lot of doubt trying
[1:22:40] standing in here with a lot of doubt
[1:22:43] trying to accept what is out there
[1:22:46] that's least on my healing trying to
[1:22:50] reach healing so about the greatest
[1:22:51] battle in the mind here with a lot of
[1:22:54] doubt trying to reach out to that that's
[1:22:57] out there that's that's in a different
[1:23:00] dimension to try to bring that dimension
[1:23:02] into this so that that healing takes
[1:23:04] place in our bodies in our minds
[1:23:06] wherever that that miracle that
[1:23:08] supernatural happens see we can't doubt
[1:23:11] it it's got to be pure faith you've got
[1:23:14] to stop that and come down that channel
[1:23:16] with the true Word of God and then it
[1:23:19] goes out itself automatically
[1:23:22] praise the Lord I like that word and
[1:23:24] automatically if that life is in you it
[1:23:28] just happens it's automatic it's what's
[1:23:31] on the inside that's the thing that
[1:23:34] counts is on the inside see we always
[1:23:37] focus so much on the outside on the
[1:23:40] Purdy and on the eloquent and all the
[1:23:42] the great speakers and stuff we we
[1:23:44] always make sure on the outside no it's
[1:23:46] what's on the inside
[1:23:47] amen it's what's on the inside man a man
[1:23:51] could be his alchemist speakers there is
[1:23:53] he
[1:23:53] the noida speaker as he is but what is
[1:23:56] he saying right what are the words
[1:23:58] coming out of his mouth because that's
[1:24:00] what matters it's on the inside that
[1:24:02] matters see it's not one man not
[1:24:04] watching his the Bible says that from
[1:24:07] from from his heart the man speaketh
[1:24:10] well that's on the inside it's what's on
[1:24:12] the inside that that defy was a person
[1:24:16] he says that's what counts is on the
[1:24:18] inside say these approaches from the
[1:24:20] inside because he knows it is he now you
[1:24:23] say I don't steal I don't drink I don't
[1:24:25] do these things that has nothing to do
[1:24:28] with it see it's the inside no matter
[1:24:30] how good you are how tall you are how
[1:24:34] truthful you are those things are
[1:24:36] respected but jesus said except a man be
[1:24:39] born again there's got to be something
[1:24:42] happen inside if you don't it's an
[1:24:46] artificial put on that's downing your
[1:24:49] hardened that down in your heart gives
[1:24:52] the desire to do it eating out then the
[1:24:55] desire is still there
[1:24:56] the desire to do it is still there even
[1:25:00] though there has been a justification
[1:25:02] took place now I want to go and read a
[1:25:06] couple more scriptures because I believe
[1:25:09] we're going to close here I I doubt I'd
[1:25:12] lose track of time because I'm I'm used
[1:25:14] to looking up to the clock but those who
[1:25:16] start at 1:30 is just now on thirty I'm
[1:25:18] used to starting and knowing about what
[1:25:21] time so but what closer you're just very
[1:25:23] shortly but let's go to Galatians I want
[1:25:26] to read a couple of scriptures out of
[1:25:27] Galatians Galatians 2:16 and in
[1:25:32] Galatians 3:11 amen Galatians 2:16 now
[1:25:39] I'm doing all this lay this foundation
[1:25:42] to understand for the justification is
[1:25:48] the justification is not on the bottom
[1:25:51] the justification is not on the spirit
[1:25:56] if God took everything wrong let's just
[1:26:00] say if because again I want to get to
[1:26:04] something
[1:26:05] if God is if the justification has taken
[1:26:10] place in the body then every wrong that
[1:26:13] was done in your rock in your life
[1:26:14] should be made private but I don't know
[1:26:18] about you but I am that's got a lot of
[1:26:21] scars of things that's happened in my
[1:26:23] life in my body any of my spirit right
[1:26:26] memories come back with things that
[1:26:29] scarred me in my life yes from my spirit
[1:26:32] you think would have been justified well
[1:26:34] it's done and over with
[1:26:35] yes but in your body in your spirit
[1:26:38] that's not what the justification is
[1:26:39] it's right here in the heart the
[1:26:42] justification is not here it's just like
[1:26:45] people brother Richard boat right now
[1:26:48] form pastor preach last Sunday for him
[1:26:51] he got it backwards he was talking about
[1:26:52] the very subject or sort of to the point
[1:26:55] we were making and you know he said you
[1:26:57] got to remember sea wisdom place a part
[1:27:00] of an understanding how do we approach
[1:27:02] what's going on today and by having that
[1:27:05] wisdom it helps us realize
[1:27:07] yeah we've been sealed with the holy
[1:27:09] spirit of promise but where is that seal
[1:27:11] it's in the soul absolutely not the body
[1:27:15] not the spirit
[1:27:17] now we're hedged we can be heads just
[1:27:19] the Bible says as we prayed about and
[1:27:22] talking about being pitched but the seal
[1:27:24] did not seal your body that's why you
[1:27:25] get sick that's why we had the flu or
[1:27:29] have a head cold or get out oh geez er
[1:27:32] the things that affect our body cuz
[1:27:34] that's not where the justification is
[1:27:36] that's not where the seal gets that's
[1:27:38] not what broke that's exactly what
[1:27:40] brother Brandon was talking about here
[1:27:41] it's only inside that's what he told him
[1:27:45] that is what matters what's on the
[1:27:47] inside not the body not the spirit I
[1:27:49] want us to keep that in mind to
[1:27:52] understand with this justification even
[1:27:56] things you I've started my body that
[1:27:58] things were done wrong well the bad
[1:28:00] never happened and why do I still have
[1:28:01] the scar because your body's not
[1:28:03] justified right it's going to be chained
[1:28:07] by the grace of God according to Romans
[1:28:09] a when our bodies are changed to be like
[1:28:12] his own glorious body we go through
[1:28:14] moral the immortality from corruption to
[1:28:16] incorruption yes maybe won't have any
[1:28:19] scars to worry about even spear or body
[1:28:21] but now we look at the justification now
[1:28:26] keep that in mind
[1:28:28] hopefully I'll try to draw that out next
[1:28:31] week to make the point I want to be
[1:28:34] thing I want to say next week of a quote
[1:28:37] that brother Greta made to understand
[1:28:39] this is not where it is justifications
[1:28:41] inside amen listen galatians galatians
[1:28:47] chapter 2 verse 16 knowing that a man is
[1:28:50] not justified by the works of the law is
[1:28:54] not something you do it's not something
[1:28:57] that you can make up or there's
[1:28:58] something that you can that you can
[1:29:00] perform to to garner the graces of God
[1:29:04] or enter into heaven it's not based on
[1:29:06] your words it's not justified by the
[1:29:09] works of the law but by the faith of
[1:29:12] Jesus Christ even we have believed in
[1:29:15] Jesus Christ that we might be justified
[1:29:17] by the faith of Christ and not by the
[1:29:20] works of the law or the works of the law
[1:29:22] shall no flesh be justified ready that
[1:29:27] solidifies fred the fact that it's not
[1:29:30] here
[1:29:31] it's in here it's not the bodies not the
[1:29:35] spirit it's not something you can do or
[1:29:37] say or no place you can go where you
[1:29:38] work you can perform it's like the rich
[1:29:40] young ruler
[1:29:42] remember the rich young man he got got
[1:29:44] richer and richer after he turned down
[1:29:46] Jesus the law was his approach I mean
[1:29:50] we're talking about a man that fell down
[1:29:52] on his knees before Jesus we're talking
[1:29:55] about a man that the Bible says Jesus
[1:29:56] looked on and loved him but what was his
[1:30:01] approach his approach was what shall I
[1:30:06] do
[1:30:07] great then I might inherit eternal life
[1:30:11] there's nothing you can do
[1:30:14] there's no work you can perform the work
[1:30:18] has already been done
[1:30:19] Jesus Christ has already done the work
[1:30:21] he's already paid the price
[1:30:22] that's a finished work there's no work
[1:30:25] we can do all they do is accept what he
[1:30:28] has done for us praise the Lord
[1:30:30] there's no work to it there's no law to
[1:30:34] it there's no justification outside of
[1:30:37] faith that grace by faith that brings us
[1:30:41] into that fellowship
[1:30:42] now Galatians 3:11 but that no man is
[1:30:46] justified by the law in the sight of God
[1:30:49] it is evident for the judge shall live
[1:30:53] by faith that was Martin Luther's crime
[1:30:55] that was that was his whole message the
[1:30:58] just shall live by faith but what are we
[1:31:01] gonna do today friend amen are we gonna
[1:31:04] live by faith are we gonna live by sight
[1:31:06] are we gonna live by what God has done
[1:31:09] for us are we gonna live by what we can
[1:31:10] see taste go smelling here are we gonna
[1:31:13] live by what God has said who we are are
[1:31:15] we going to live by what we think we are
[1:31:17] about the devil tries to convince you
[1:31:18] you are I can tell you what God believes
[1:31:20] you are you are his you are him
[1:31:23] manifested in this earth living in these
[1:31:26] bodies but man said of this place where
[1:31:29] the fall off you see God standing in
[1:31:30] front of you I mean what more do we need
[1:31:34] to understand and no you say yeah I want
[1:31:38] you to make a mistake today you ever
[1:31:40] make a mistake again tomorrow but it's
[1:31:42] understanding that perpetual
[1:31:45] justification that keeps you clean even
[1:31:48] when you are born again is filled with
[1:31:50] the spirit God does not impute any of
[1:31:53] that to you hey man I'm a clothes here
[1:31:56] let's bury who is this no kidding and
[1:31:59] look clearly make it clear you will
[1:32:02] never be the word unless you was a
[1:32:06] thought at the beginning praise the Lord
[1:32:08] that thought that was in God in the
[1:32:12] beginning that low gosh that thought
[1:32:14] calm down into the predestined in the
[1:32:17] form of that scene right there
[1:32:19] amen that seat right there shows
[1:32:23] destination of God in each life whom he
[1:32:26] has chosen and he did it as we read by
[1:32:29] his foreknowledge his foreknowledge so
[1:32:32] who would receive him and who would not
[1:32:34] receive him now that brings them that
[1:32:36] that's the scripture I mean we can't you
[1:32:40] denied the scripture all you want but
[1:32:41] that's what it says you will never be
[1:32:43] the word what is that the Express image
[1:32:45] of Jesus praise the Lord man I wish
[1:32:50] y'all are all here you just be shouting
[1:32:51] you will never be the word unless you is
[1:32:55] a fault at the beginning that's that
[1:32:57] Express image that proves the
[1:33:00] predestination of God you can't be the
[1:33:04] word less you were a fault you had to be
[1:33:07] in the thinking of God first in order to
[1:33:10] stand temptation though we had to bypass
[1:33:13] that theophany oh we see that
[1:33:16] condescension now it just keeps coming
[1:33:18] to me friends we'll get back to it
[1:33:21] that condescension of God coming down
[1:33:24] that logos to come out we bypassed our
[1:33:27] theophanies you had to come here in the
[1:33:29] flesh to be tempted of sin and and all
[1:33:33] the father has given me will come to me
[1:33:35] and I have raised him up the last day
[1:33:37] Amen see you first let's keep going now
[1:33:39] before the foundation of the world his
[1:33:42] name your name was put on the Lamb's
[1:33:44] Book of Life then from that he became
[1:33:47] the word that theophany that could
[1:33:49] appear disappear then he became flesh we
[1:33:53] turn back again
[1:33:54] Ritt resurrected that same body in a
[1:33:57] glorified condition but you by pat but
[1:34:00] you by past in theophany and became
[1:34:02] flesh man to be tempted by sin in this
[1:34:06] earthly tabernacle is dissolved we have
[1:34:08] one already waiting we have not yet
[1:34:12] those bodies but look when this body
[1:34:14] receives the Spirit of God
[1:34:16] the immortal light inside of you it
[1:34:19] throws this body in subjection to God
[1:34:24] praise the Lord it throws this body in
[1:34:29] the subjection to God why
[1:34:33] the soul is the nature of the Spirit and
[1:34:36] the Spirit is the life of the body amen
[1:34:40] in that soul is the place of freewheel
[1:34:42] yes your decision point that's where
[1:34:44] people decide do I look to accept God or
[1:34:48] do I not well God's moving on me well
[1:34:51] that's wonderful are you going to accept
[1:34:53] that move or are you gonna reject it
[1:34:56] amen people around the world today
[1:35:00] making that decision when this body
[1:35:04] receives the Spirit of God the immortal
[1:35:06] life of God in you that throws this body
[1:35:08] subjection to it he that is born of God
[1:35:12] does not commit sin amen
[1:35:16] there's another one he that is born of
[1:35:18] God does not commence he and he cannot
[1:35:20] see it again first John three go back to
[1:35:22] find that scene there that's where
[1:35:23] brother Browns quoting from he that his
[1:35:26] board of God cannot see in Romans 8:1
[1:35:28] there is therefore no condemnation to
[1:35:30] them that are in Christ Jesus
[1:35:32] they walk not after the flesh but after
[1:35:34] the spirit there you are see that throws
[1:35:37] your body in subject you don't have you
[1:35:41] don't have to say oh I could just quit
[1:35:43] drinking or it might be just wit smoking
[1:35:45] her if I could just quit doing all this
[1:35:47] stuff he said just get into Christ and
[1:35:49] it's all gone man notice what he said he
[1:35:55] said you get into Christ amen praise Him
[1:36:01] we get into Christ not just Christ God
[1:36:07] the Holy Spirit in us we get in him then
[1:36:11] all that is gone been said well I gotta
[1:36:15] do this I gotta do that go God will do
[1:36:17] what he wants but he's gonna find a
[1:36:18] willing subject to do it through there's
[1:36:21] always there's always you looked in the
[1:36:23] Bible there's always willing subjects
[1:36:25] that God has used down through the years
[1:36:27] someone who is making the choice to do
[1:36:31] it and to be there it's their choice oh
[1:36:35] if I could just quit smoking just put
[1:36:37] drinking to just get into Christ and
[1:36:39] it's all gone see because your body is
[1:36:44] to the spirit your body is subject to
[1:36:46] the Spiritist no more subject to the
[1:36:48] things of the world they are dead the
[1:36:50] things of the world that come into this
[1:36:52] guy see taste smell smell in here and
[1:36:54] even and even will affect your spirit I
[1:36:58] don't know how many have experienced
[1:37:01] this but when I was in the world I like
[1:37:03] classic what we call classic rock man I
[1:37:05] was just walking rollin it was a kid
[1:37:07] now it's called classic rock I guess
[1:37:09] I've reached that age in classic rock
[1:37:11] anyway you go to the store restaurant of
[1:37:15] course you can't go the restaurants
[1:37:17] anymore hard to go the stores but you
[1:37:18] hear this is that they explain music
[1:37:21] music sometimes sometimes I hear the
[1:37:24] some use except song I haven't heard in
[1:37:26] probably 30 or 40 years and I can sing
[1:37:29] every word of that song one
[1:37:33] I know heard in 30 40 years how would I
[1:37:35] be able to more than 30 how I'd be able
[1:37:38] to still see him written every word of
[1:37:41] that song you so that's your memory you
[1:37:42] know that's right here that's in your
[1:37:44] spirit you remember that those things
[1:37:47] conjure back up because that's that that
[1:37:50] conscious brings into that memory to
[1:37:52] remember those things even back from
[1:37:54] them that's the power of music by the
[1:37:56] way too that brings that into into play
[1:37:59] defensive it's still that world still
[1:38:02] hasn't affected here to body and spirit
[1:38:05] it still it still works to affect both
[1:38:07] but your body is subject to the Spirit
[1:38:10] of God no it's no more subject to the
[1:38:14] things of the world they're dead they're
[1:38:15] dead your sins are buried in Baptism and
[1:38:19] you are a new creation in Christ praise
[1:38:23] the Lord
[1:38:24] now we just have to believe that we just
[1:38:27] have to act like that
[1:38:28] that's that's not just verbage that's
[1:38:30] just not words on the page that's
[1:38:32] something that we are supposed to live
[1:38:33] that's our life
[1:38:35] amen it's Christ in us the hope of glory
[1:38:37] the only way to get to that place it
[1:38:40] brings us to that places to be justified
[1:38:43] amen God takes and wipes all that away
[1:38:47] no more the bad nature amen
[1:38:51] but God coming and living in there is
[1:38:54] what changes the whole thing the
[1:38:55] justification Psalm with a body mount
[1:38:57] with the spirit yeah you still did those
[1:39:00] things back years ago you still did
[1:39:03] those things you still listen to that
[1:39:05] music and ran with those people you
[1:39:07] still did that and that that's there but
[1:39:11] in God's mind it's erased
