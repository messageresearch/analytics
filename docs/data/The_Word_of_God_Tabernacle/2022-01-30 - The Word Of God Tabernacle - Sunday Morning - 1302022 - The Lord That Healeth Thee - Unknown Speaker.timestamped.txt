[9:14] growing in christ you never stop growing

[9:28] gone so far we've grown so big we don't

[18:00] um
[18:02] i'm kind of a little upset but
[18:05] i just
[18:06] this uh medical world has just gotten
[18:09] getting the better of me i guess
[18:12] they covered tester and sent her home
[18:15] they couldn't do anything to her until
[18:16] they tested her and she's been
[18:19] shot up and
[18:20] got the shots and everything and i it
[18:22] just
[18:24] so much for emergency
[18:26] i mean where's the emergency you come
[18:27] into the emergency room because you're
[18:29] sick and they send you home waiting two
[18:30] days for a test result
[18:33] it's just
[18:34] i it's just sad
[18:36] it's so bad i tell you
[18:38] what it does to me saints is telling me
[18:42] that we need to be
[18:44] faithful in christ and
[18:47] the faith of god because there may be a
[18:49] day we won't get treated in hospitals
[18:52] and medicine and doctors
[18:55] we're going to rely on the great
[18:56] physician
[18:59] something came to me yesterday that
[19:02] just kind of
[19:03] you know with pursuing the hospital and
[19:05] brother charlie passing and the sickness
[19:07] and things that's going around this is
[19:09] just is this just
[19:11] sort of what the bride's going to be
[19:12] going through here right before she goes
[19:14] home
[19:15] i don't know is it that is this kind of
[19:19] what they always talk about i've always
[19:21] disagreed with a lot of ministers
[19:23] squeeze perspectives but um
[19:26] is this a part of what that is
[19:28] i don't know
[19:29] all the people going on that could just
[19:31] be a part of it it's getting us in that
[19:33] into that place
[19:35] uh
[19:36] it could very well be but sister pat's
[19:38] at home not feeling well uh
[19:41] i i don't want to jump into the
[19:43] preaching
[19:44] uh you know brother henry green always
[19:46] had a saying blessed is the man who can
[19:48] lead songs without preaching kind of
[19:50] hard to do when you're a preacher so
[19:52] forgive me but uh got a little wild when
[19:55] i found that that wouldn't they didn't
[19:56] even treat sister pat and i know they
[19:58] just tested her and sent her home but
[20:00] she has a fever so brother pat uh is
[20:03] gonna stay home with her today

[21:02] both of those churches those both of
[21:04] those chairs are detached from the road
[21:07] uh they've gone on to be with the lord
[21:09] this past
[21:10] six months year uh brother charlie this
[21:12] week so brother charlie would be sitting
[21:14] back there were sister's serenity is

[21:19] no you can stay you can stay right there
[21:22] brother charlie would be happy that

[21:48] family and sister teresa in prayer if we
[21:51] could
[21:51] uh with brother charlie going home to be
[21:53] with the lord micah gave me and this is

[21:58] make any excuses
[22:00] i can only tell you what i felt in my
[22:02] heart i told you for a couple of weeks
[22:04] what i felt on my heart
[22:06] about persist for sister priscilla and
[22:08] for charlie

[22:14] the spirit that's filling my heart is
[22:17] the rapture so close
[22:19] we're just looking into that other
[22:20] dimension
[22:23] brother charlie here with us and
[22:26] we don't know but i believe it's that
[22:28] close
[22:30] i believe it's that close so
[22:32] maybe we're just getting a little
[22:33] glimpse of the heavenly vision i mean
[22:35] that grand reunion where we're all going
[22:37] to be together again
[22:39] i can't help but feel
[22:42] a little discouraged though
[22:45] i
[22:46] i was genuinely
[22:48] very happy and thrilled and looking
[22:50] forward to having brother charlie
[22:52] in service with us
[22:53] more often
[22:54] uh so uh i'm gonna miss him greatly for
[22:58] the charlie was a sweet spirit

[23:03] rare
[23:04] sweet spirit i should say
[23:06] amen

[23:10] amends any anyone now have an unspoken
[23:12] request that's all the things that's of
[23:14] course again priscilla is still in the
[23:16] hospital i'll have brother angel give an
[23:18] update on sister priscilla in a few
[23:20] minutes i take go ahead and do it before
[23:22] we go to go to the lord in prayer
[23:25] there was a couple things he had in the
[23:27] air yesterday when i talked to you last
[23:29] and maybe there's update if you
[23:32] if you'd like to maybe give everybody
[23:34] bring everybody up to date about her
[23:36] situation
[23:37] okay um
[23:39] good morning good bless you all
[23:41] um
[23:43] she's doing she's doing well
[23:47] the
[23:48] i guess they rotated the nursing staff
[23:50] and one night or her because she has two
[23:52] drains on her now
[23:54] and um the new one they put on
[23:57] i guess they filled up and they kind of
[23:59] the new nurses forgot about it and it
[24:01] burst
[24:02] so that it was everywhere
[24:04] so they cleaned it up and they believed
[24:06] some of it might have actually got onto
[24:08] her wounds and might have re-injured
[24:11] causing her the pain and
[24:13] i guess the temperatures in the fever
[24:15] she was getting
[24:20] and she's just been really it's amazing
[24:23] she's been close to the lord even though
[24:25] this is going on she's thanking him
[24:27] for this because there's something here
[24:29] for all of us to learn from and see for
[24:31] my children as well
[24:33] and
[24:35] and it's just amazing because she's
[24:36] really recovering fast right now
[24:38] there were some prayers that went out
[24:41] a sister caught us and she didn't know
[24:42] my wife had a hole
[24:44] but the doctor said it's closed
[24:47] and um this is kind of
[24:50] amazing because it closed fast they do
[24:52] close but it takes time
[24:54] for the time she's been in there um
[24:57] it was it's just a miracle that we've
[24:59] i've been seeing her every day if she's
[25:01] actually
[25:02] able to walk she's still on the um
[25:07] diet but they want to move her on to
[25:09] um
[25:12] two
[25:27] then with no pain and nothing they'll
[25:30] send her home
[25:32] to to be with us and then they'll just
[25:33] reschedule if they have to take the
[25:35] dreams out now or later but she's
[25:37] getting straight every day it's amazing
[25:40] um the lord's been working on her so
[25:42] much that um she's been actually a
[25:44] testimony for the last four weeks for
[25:46] the nurses there because she's been
[25:48] playing the bible and
[25:50] sermons and all kinds of things every
[25:52] day every night and they've all been
[25:54] hearing it so it was amazing because
[25:56] they come in and ask what is that what
[25:58] are you listening to
[25:59] and it's just the lord's been doing a
[26:01] lot so i thank him i praise him for it
[26:04] praising that he's healing my wife
[26:06] because we all know the prophet said
[26:08] he'll use anything in
[26:17] so what is her pain level at now she's
[26:19] having better her pay level
[26:22] um should be amazing she's got a five
[26:25] and a four
[26:26] good and she's actually been pushing
[26:28] through it
[26:29] and they're taking off the meds that

[37:44] the frajos have a song
[37:47] one of them or all of them i'm not sure
[37:49] they're going to have a special to sing
[37:51] micah's got a couple of testimonies as
[37:53] they're getting ready to come
[37:55] that he wants to give i we usually write
[37:57] them down but these are a little leafy
[37:59] he said so he wanted to take a minute if
[38:01] he could
[38:02] give them to you poorly
[38:05] yeah sorry there's just a couple uh this
[38:08] is kind of an eventful um
[38:10] so uh
[38:12] on the way to so i've been working with
[38:14] brother tom this
[38:16] couple weeks for the gym show and on
[38:17] though i had to fill my car up with oil
[38:20] the other day and i didn't realize i
[38:21] accidentally left the cap off of the oil
[38:24] um
[38:25] and i realized it was kind of smoking
[38:28] when i stopped at the light but my gauge
[38:30] wasn't saying i was running hot or
[38:31] anything so just wait until i got to the
[38:33] um to the show and
[38:34] open the hood and realize that the cap
[38:36] has been left off um so oil had kind of
[38:39] spurt a little bit onto the engine it
[38:40] was smoking
[38:42] but the way they made the input there's
[38:45] like a flat metal piece over the hole so
[38:48] not as much oil could come out i guess
[38:50] so i just want to thank the lord that
[38:52] that everything was fine if you use a
[38:53] lot of oil or run dry and ruin the
[38:56] engine or anything i just want to keep
[38:58] them keeping us safe as well we work
[39:01] with hundreds of pounds of rock up to
[39:03] the biggest one he has seven tons
[39:05] so just for keeping it safe and things
[39:07] like that um and the other day i i've
[39:10] been really low on money since
[39:12] uh started and stuff like that um so i
[39:15] really needed something to drink so i
[39:16] went up to the standard like oh we're
[39:18] closed uh like okay uh and it was on
[39:20] walkways she was like wait i made this
[39:22] lemonade that no one came and got you
[39:23] want it so the lord gave me a lemonade
[39:25] the other day
[39:26] and
[39:28] and then the last three days that i've
[39:29] been working with him um i've needed
[39:31] enough to finish my car payment this
[39:34] month and i
[39:35] didn't have enough and so on the way
[39:38] home i was like well lord you know what
[39:39] i need you've always provided and just
[39:41] then brother tom called me like hey i
[39:43] realized that you might need money so
[39:45] stop by the house and i'll pay you for
[39:47] the last three days you've been working
[39:48] so it was definitely enough to finish
[39:50] off my car payment so it's one thing for
[39:52] always providing many different ways
[39:54] amen amen praise the lord god is good
[39:58] amen

[40:48] my mom so i just started praying for her
[40:51] and as i was praying i started hearing
[40:54] angels see but they weren't seeing any
[40:56] songs they were just vocalizing
[40:59] and it really touched my heart and it

[47:57] read one verse verse 26 but before we do
[48:00] let's just bow our heads for another
[48:01] word of prayer
[48:03] precious jesus father it's a privileged
[48:05] lord once again to pull back the pages
[48:08] of this sacred writ lord that you've
[48:10] given us god jesus christ in letter form
[48:13] that shows us and reveals to us lord
[48:15] what is in here that you have us to see
[48:17] and know
[48:18] god it's an honor father for you to give
[48:20] us it was a day there was a time where
[48:22] even your children did not have this
[48:25] bible that they could open and read but
[48:27] lord you blessed us today this last day
[48:29] what a privilege it is to live in this
[48:32] last day god knowing that the great
[48:34] things that you do for us in this great
[48:36] and dreadful day
[48:38] lord of the lord that you have for us to
[48:40] be able to open this book and to read
[48:42] these
[48:43] these pages these words lord that you've
[48:45] given to us inspired by the holy ghost
[48:47] lord that it would anchor into our souls
[48:50] and reveal itself to us father that our
[48:52] desire would become to it and to live it
[48:54] to the best of our ability that you give
[48:56] us in our human flesh
[48:58] forgive all of our sins and iniquities
[49:00] lord and lord take complete control over
[49:03] the remaining part of this service lord
[49:05] this important part god of the
[49:06] ministering of your word trusting that
[49:08] you would speak to us once again anoint
[49:10] not just speaker myself here but to hear
[49:13] each one of us here today that lord what
[49:15] you to have to say will not return void
[49:18] but accomplish in each one of us what
[49:20] you sent it forth for lord and we thank
[49:23] you give you the praise and glory for
[49:24] all that is done and uh and thank you
[49:28] lord for for always being with us never
[49:31] leaving or forsaking us and we commit
[49:33] the remaining part of this to you lord
[49:35] that it will be for your glory and honor
[49:36] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[49:38] pray amen
[49:41] exodus 15 26.
[49:44] let's read this one verse of scripture
[49:46] and let you be seated and said if thou
[49:48] wilt diligently hearken to the voice of
[49:50] the lord thy god
[49:52] and we'll do that which is right in his
[49:54] sight and will give ear to his
[49:57] commandments and keep all his statutes i
[50:00] will i will put none of these diseases
[50:03] upon thee which i have brought upon the
[50:06] egyptians for i am the lord that healeth
[50:10] thee yes amen you can be seated if you'd
[50:12] like
[50:14] i mean how many times each one of us
[50:16] have felt that healing power that god
[50:18] has healed us with and the scripture
[50:21] precedent that god tells us he is our
[50:24] healer he is still the great physician
[50:26] he's still the one that that heals all
[50:28] of our afflictions and diseases
[50:30] but
[50:32] there's the physical healing that we
[50:34] probably major on more than anything
[50:36] um
[50:37] and i've just titled this the lord that
[50:39] healeth thee and we major a lot of times
[50:41] on the physical healing i guess it comes
[50:43] from pentecost and the gifts of the
[50:45] spirit and and all the things that came
[50:47] from that and through all the faith
[50:49] healers and and brother branham and the
[50:52] different ones and it came to a place
[50:54] that so many times the the major uh
[50:57] focus was on physical healing but i
[51:00] really want to talk about it and really
[51:02] the more important part to me is the
[51:04] spiritual aspect of healing because you
[51:07] know there's a spiritual sickness that
[51:09] god can come and bring in and bring that
[51:11] bomb of gilead to bring healing to our
[51:14] spirits and to our souls to our inner
[51:16] being that that
[51:19] that it actually is the the engine room
[51:22] of the of the ship
[51:23] uh the ship that we look at it you can
[51:26] make it pretty and paint it up and make
[51:28] it look great and and it can be a great
[51:30] shape but unless unless what's taking
[51:32] place in the engine room is working the
[51:34] way it's supposed to and and is a viable
[51:37] engine and it has gas and it has oil in
[51:39] it it's running the way it's supposed to
[51:40] i don't care how pretty the outside is i
[51:43] don't care how good and how well healed
[51:45] the outside is if the inside is not uh
[51:48] the way it's supposed to be it's not
[51:50] going anywhere it's not gonna accomplish
[51:52] anything it's not gonna do anything so
[51:54] really what would be the more important
[51:57] healing would it be the physical healing
[51:59] which again we made your own so much for
[52:01] the spiritual healing
[52:03] amen you know a lot of times we've done
[52:05] here at this congregation this church
[52:07] especially for people that we may not
[52:10] know that well or people that have just
[52:12] asked us in passing to pray for them or
[52:13] have our church pray for them and we say
[52:16] more than anything or loved ones that
[52:18] that aren't serving the lord more than
[52:20] anything we ask god heal them
[52:22] spiritually first
[52:24] amen heal their spiritual being before
[52:27] you bring a physical healing because the
[52:29] spiritual healing is more important and
[52:32] if the spiritual healing is taken care
[52:33] of a lot of times the physical healing
[52:35] comes and just falls right in line but
[52:39] it's the spiritual healing that that
[52:41] means the most it's the spiritual
[52:43] healing that cuts us the deepest amen
[52:46] you know
[52:47] priscilla's been through operations my
[52:49] little joel's been through operation
[52:51] here recently and we uh many of us been
[52:53] in hospitals and things and you know
[52:55] we've been sick or we've had to have
[52:57] surgery or we've had to take medicine
[52:58] and those kind of things and and those
[53:01] things bring us up and and are intended
[53:03] to bring us back to the physical
[53:05] condition that we're supposed to be and
[53:07] that's important it's important to be in
[53:09] the in the best physical condition that
[53:12] the lord give us to be able to serve him
[53:14] with you can't serve god in the capacity
[53:17] that he wants us to so many times if
[53:19] your spiritual aspect or if your
[53:21] physical aspect is diminished if god
[53:23] says go do this and you're physically
[53:25] incapable of doing it then yeah it makes
[53:28] a big difference if you're physically
[53:29] well or not
[53:30] but the but it's more important that the
[53:33] spiritual healing takes place
[53:36] because the that uh
[53:38] because it helps bring the physical
[53:40] healing about
[53:42] if the spiritual healing takes place
[53:44] then a person can be able to have the
[53:46] faith to reach out and touch god for
[53:49] that physical healing many times again
[53:52] we find healing through doctors and
[53:54] medicine and different things sometimes
[53:56] god does miraculous things for us we've
[53:58] sat here and had how many times
[54:00] testimonies of miracles that god has
[54:03] done for us outside of medical
[54:05] intervention right that god has done for
[54:07] us and healed us blessed us provided for
[54:10] us and how many times god does that
[54:13] it's been outstanding but one but when
[54:16] god brings that spiritual healing friend
[54:18] then it solves all the problem it it
[54:21] dissolves all the doubt because then you
[54:23] know you're you're in the right place
[54:25] with the lord that's what matters the
[54:27] most the spiritual healing
[54:30] comes first and see god
[54:33] god loves his children beyond what any
[54:37] imagination or thought or understanding
[54:39] could could comprehend
[54:42] god loves us way more than we could ever
[54:45] even begin to explain
[54:46] and or or understand we just in our
[54:49] little finite p brains we'll just never
[54:51] be able to understand it all it just
[54:54] and so many things goes again and his
[54:56] love so many of the things of his love
[54:58] goes against what we have been taught as
[55:01] we grow up right you know the love that
[55:03] we are taught when we grow up is the uh
[55:06] if you're hurt got a booboo and you hold
[55:08] them and you cuddle them and everything
[55:09] you know uh but
[55:11] perfect love is just as corrective as it
[55:14] is as it is uh physical or or uh uh the
[55:19] uh the emotion the the corrective love
[55:22] is just as important
[55:24] and and god uses that love to us just as
[55:26] much as he does anything
[55:28] because
[55:29] that corrective love works more on our
[55:31] spirit than the other does amen it
[55:33] brings us in line with god with his word
[55:36] with the purpose that he has for each
[55:37] one of us in our lives now let's get to
[55:40] a couple of scriptures i want to read
[55:41] first of them that you can probably
[55:43] maybe even imagine is in job
[55:48] job chapter five
[55:51] now what better man probably in the
[55:53] bible that we could talk about
[55:55] that
[55:56] that desired more than anything that
[55:58] healing from god
[56:00] now at the end of all the things that
[56:02] satan had done to him
[56:04] at the end of all that he was attacked
[56:07] with those sore boils from the top of
[56:09] his head to the soles of his feet so
[56:11] certainly he did need physical healing
[56:13] as well
[56:14] but more than that he would have given
[56:17] all of that over if the spiritual
[56:20] healing of all that had taken place
[56:22] prior to that would have all come back
[56:26] he wouldn't give it all
[56:28] amen i believe
[56:30] job would
[56:31] the sore boils wasn't a problem for job
[56:34] that that was just flesh
[56:37] but the spiritual
[56:40] wounds that he had gotten how physical
[56:43] wounds can become deep
[56:45] but
[56:46] physical wounds can be a band-aid or or
[56:49] or uh some kind of uh stitches or or
[56:52] something like that but a spiritual
[56:55] wound you can't see it a spiritual wound
[56:58] you can't put a stitch on it you can't
[57:00] put a band-aid on it you can't well back
[57:02] in my day we put with cure chrome does
[57:04] anybody you know what that is
[57:07] older people probably know what your
[57:08] chrome is my body sometimes when i was a
[57:10] kid was red all over
[57:12] because i get scratches and beats and
[57:14] everything all over me and my mom would
[57:15] stick and she had taken look she
[57:17] slathered that stuff on there too i'd
[57:19] have a little scratch like this whole
[57:21] top my hands red
[57:23] me cure chroma it was all red a little
[57:25] dipstick and she had trouble all over me
[57:28] but you can't do that to a spiritual
[57:30] woman
[57:31] amen there's got to be a different type
[57:33] of healing that comes in a spiritual
[57:35] womb a spiritual wound can only be
[57:37] healed by god
[57:39] god's the only one that can bring
[57:40] spiritual healing you can go to doctors
[57:42] you go to medicine you go to all that
[57:44] and you can go to psychiatrists and
[57:46] things like that and you know i don't
[57:48] have anything against them but the best
[57:50] spiritual healing you can get comes from
[57:52] god
[57:53] he's the one that created to begin with
[57:55] and it's the spiritual atmosphere the
[57:57] spiritual aspect of it that he
[57:59] specializes in not that he's not
[58:02] especially every other part of it
[58:04] because he made all of us amen but the
[58:06] spiritual part again you can't put a
[58:08] band-aid on it man has created a
[58:10] band-aid to put on or or stitches or a
[58:13] doctor or a hospital but
[58:15] but
[58:16] man's treated all those things and
[58:18] that's good thank god for it god give
[58:20] man the intelligence to be able to do
[58:22] that that's good to have an operation to
[58:24] uh to
[58:26] uh like they did priscilla's stick a
[58:29] tube in you and drain something out of
[58:30] you it's not supposed to be in there
[58:31] things like that you know thank god god
[58:34] gives gives them the intelligence to do
[58:36] that but the spiritual healing is a
[58:37] whole different aspect
[58:39] amen how many times you hear on tape and
[58:42] people would come up to brother branham
[58:44] and and he would grab their hands in the
[58:47] early days and there's no vibration and
[58:50] there's nothing happening brother
[58:51] brown's like well there's nothing wrong
[58:52] with you but see there is something
[58:54] wrong with them
[58:56] it's like that girl that came up while
[58:58] she was a young lady at the time she saw
[59:00] brother brown and come up and said
[59:01] there's nothing wrong with you but there
[59:03] was but it wasn't physical it was
[59:06] spiritual
[59:07] so then there had to be a deeper dive
[59:09] into it more than just a a a grabbing of
[59:12] the hand or a vibration in the arm or
[59:14] hand or something there had to be
[59:16] something deeper to go in to find out
[59:18] what exactly was wrong with this person
[59:20] because it wasn't a physical problem but
[59:22] the spiritual problem that she was
[59:24] having was calling causing physical
[59:27] problems
[59:28] her spiritual problem was what was
[59:30] in her spirit was what was causing her
[59:32] the issues that was affecting her
[59:34] physical being
[59:36] and all the physical manifestations she
[59:38] was experiencing was because of what had
[59:40] happened in her
[59:42] spirit
[59:43] when she was a kid
[59:45] then brother then a vision breaks out
[59:48] and brother and god shows this prophet a
[59:51] girl running down in a vision says this
[59:53] little girl being chased by a big angry
[59:55] dog with a ponytail flying behind her on
[59:58] her back
[59:59] and god said and god spoke to brother
[1:00:01] ram said that's what your problem is
[1:00:04] from the time that that dog chased her
[1:00:07] this mean angry dog chased her
[1:00:10] when she was a little girl
[1:00:12] that spiritual bruise that spiritual cut
[1:00:16] that had been in her had stayed there
[1:00:18] her entire life so when she got older
[1:00:22] that was never taken care of and so when
[1:00:24] she got older
[1:00:26] it began to affect her physical being
[1:00:29] this woman didn't need a touch
[1:00:31] physically she needed to touch
[1:00:32] spiritually
[1:00:34] she needed a spiritual healing for that
[1:00:36] wound in her spirit to go away
[1:00:39] to be healed
[1:00:41] to be to be made better for the physical
[1:00:43] part to be made better and of course
[1:00:46] god did that god spoke to her or god
[1:00:49] spoke to brother branham and spoke to
[1:00:51] her now
[1:00:53] there's probably no
[1:00:54] greater person in the scripture i mean
[1:00:56] there's a lot of things that's happened
[1:00:57] to a lot of people in the scripture a
[1:00:59] lot of examples we have
[1:01:01] could bring up but probably the best one
[1:01:03] you can think of is job now i want you
[1:01:05] to see something here
[1:01:07] and i've said this before and i maintain
[1:01:09] this but
[1:01:12] job was hedged joe was a child of god
[1:01:15] you agree
[1:01:16] joe was a child of god
[1:01:18] so we've got to establish that first god
[1:01:20] job was a child of god are you a child
[1:01:22] of god so you got to establish that
[1:01:25] that's first thing if you're not a child
[1:01:27] of god that's it's different amen
[1:01:32] it pains me
[1:01:33] because i still
[1:01:36] in my humanity i still question
[1:01:39] sometimes i say god why
[1:01:42] i mean david called to god and said god
[1:01:44] why did the wicked prosper so right when
[1:01:47] this is going on and this is going on
[1:01:49] and and your children are being uh
[1:01:52] tortured and tormented and all the
[1:01:53] things that's going on god why does the
[1:01:55] wicked prosper yeah
[1:01:57] and sometimes in my spirit i get the
[1:01:59] same way i think god why why would you
[1:02:02] take such a precious soul like brother
[1:02:04] charlie and there's so much evil going
[1:02:06] on in this world
[1:02:08] but see charlie belonged to god
[1:02:12] charlie was in god's hands
[1:02:14] god's not responsible for all the others
[1:02:17] amen now if they touch one of his
[1:02:19] children then that's a different story
[1:02:21] but god's not responsible for any of the
[1:02:23] others he's responsible for his children
[1:02:26] amen god's responsible for his honor
[1:02:29] sometimes the
[1:02:31] family comes over tapped in zach come
[1:02:32] and bring the kids over and
[1:02:34] joel goes out and plays with the little
[1:02:36] boys
[1:02:37] well when they get out of line a little
[1:02:39] bit tabitha goes up to the door and say
[1:02:41] joel now this this and this
[1:02:45] that's her son
[1:02:46] she doesn't go to the door and say hey
[1:02:48] you little boy from across the street no
[1:02:51] that's not her son
[1:02:53] she's not responsible for him
[1:02:55] now if he starts beating up on joel or
[1:02:57] something like that although god helped
[1:02:59] the little boy if he tried if he tried
[1:03:01] to do something like that then that's a
[1:03:04] different story but if it just plain she
[1:03:07] goes she's responsible for hers
[1:03:10] god's responsible for his own god's
[1:03:12] responsible for his children amen and
[1:03:15] whether we understand it or not it's up
[1:03:17] to him god is responsible for job and
[1:03:20] god had job hedged
[1:03:22] god had jobs so heads that satan
[1:03:26] couldn't even touch you right you know
[1:03:28] brother brahm said you could be so lost
[1:03:30] and god satan can't even find you
[1:03:33] amen
[1:03:34] but god satan satan went to god and
[1:03:37] begged him to be able to take that he
[1:03:39] said i can't get to him because you've
[1:03:41] got him his i can't even touch him
[1:03:43] are you a child of god
[1:03:45] was he a child of god well why is it any
[1:03:47] different from us than it was for him
[1:03:49] right if you're a child of god you're
[1:03:51] heads too
[1:03:52] god's got you so hedged that satan can't
[1:03:54] even find you
[1:03:56] amen praise the lord now the only
[1:03:57] problem is that you step out from about
[1:04:00] outside that hedge now that's different
[1:04:02] brother man said if you step out from
[1:04:03] under the blood that's different but if
[1:04:05] you're in that but doesn't mean you're
[1:04:07] not a child of god
[1:04:08] but that just leaves you open to what
[1:04:10] the devil could do to you amen
[1:04:13] so there's there's
[1:04:15] all these things being said and i'm
[1:04:17] going to make a statement and i know
[1:04:19] people disagree with me and i hope you
[1:04:21] don't
[1:04:22] get mad at me
[1:04:24] but
[1:04:25] i have people would say well so-and-so
[1:04:28] would be here
[1:04:29] if they got the shot
[1:04:31] and if you get the coca-cola that's fine
[1:04:33] i
[1:04:34] again you do what you feel led to do
[1:04:37] people say that maybe about brother
[1:04:39] charlie oh he had been here so and so
[1:04:41] such that
[1:04:42] charlie satella was a child of god and i
[1:04:44] don't i'm not making this service about
[1:04:46] charlie so forgive me
[1:04:48] but it's the best example i know at this
[1:04:50] time right
[1:04:52] child of god he's in god's hands
[1:04:55] covet no covet heart attack no heart
[1:04:57] attack cancer no cancer uh diabetes no
[1:05:00] diabetes whatever it is
[1:05:03] he's in god's hands that's all that
[1:05:05] matters you heard the testimony chuck
[1:05:07] brother chuck told us
[1:05:08] god those angels come and pack brother
[1:05:11] charlie's so home
[1:05:13] right amen because he is a child of god
[1:05:16] god's responsible for him he said oh
[1:05:18] he'd be here saints when your time comes
[1:05:21] you're going to go that's right
[1:05:23] it doesn't matter if it's
[1:05:26] x y z it doesn't matter which vehicle
[1:05:29] god chooses to take you
[1:05:32] any one of us i could drop right here
[1:05:35] now for no good reason at all
[1:05:37] going to be with the lord
[1:05:39] i could any one of us could for no
[1:05:41] reason at all
[1:05:44] because it's god's calling us home and
[1:05:46] that's what and that's what matters so
[1:05:48] i'm sorry if you're a child of god
[1:05:51] people make it like that
[1:05:53] satan circumvents the will of god and
[1:05:56] takes you by so-and-so action oh he had
[1:05:59] a heart attack because no you are hedged
[1:06:02] saints if you're a child of god you're
[1:06:04] heads and satan can't touch you without
[1:06:06] god's permissions right right now
[1:06:09] satan cannot get to you he can't even
[1:06:12] find you without god's permission
[1:06:14] without god allowing it and saints if
[1:06:16] god allows it then there's a reason for
[1:06:18] it
[1:06:19] now that's where the that's where the
[1:06:21] whole
[1:06:22] misunderstanding thing comes from god i
[1:06:24] don't know god's ways
[1:06:26] i don't know god's purpose
[1:06:28] i don't know what's going to happen down
[1:06:30] the road i don't know what's going to
[1:06:31] happen in the next 10 minutes but he
[1:06:33] does and i trust him in that and
[1:06:36] wherever it leads me and whatever it
[1:06:38] costs me and whatever god's will is for
[1:06:40] me that's what i want
[1:06:42] god let it be it may be hard it may be a
[1:06:45] struggle it may be tough but god is in
[1:06:48] charge and if we believe him and trust
[1:06:50] him
[1:06:51] i quote the scripture it's quoted a lot
[1:06:55] amen but
[1:06:56] the scripture says that all things will
[1:06:59] work together for the good of them that
[1:07:01] love god
[1:07:03] now the thing with that scripture that a
[1:07:05] lot of people miss
[1:07:07] is that
[1:07:08] it's for those who love god
[1:07:11] now if you don't love god that scripture
[1:07:13] is not going to work for you
[1:07:16] amen
[1:07:17] and i just say that generally because i
[1:07:18] believe you all love the lord but that
[1:07:21] scripture doesn't work if you don't love
[1:07:22] god because he said they all work
[1:07:24] together for those that love
[1:07:26] him now that love is agape love
[1:07:29] so it's not just a oh god i love you and
[1:07:32] then go live and do whatever you want
[1:07:33] the rest of your life or deny the word
[1:07:36] deny the scripture it doesn't work that
[1:07:38] way if you love god you're going to obey
[1:07:40] god to obey god is to obey his word to
[1:07:42] obey his word is to live his word and if
[1:07:44] you're living his word it's going to
[1:07:46] come in your spirit to understand that
[1:07:48] all things no matter what comes is going
[1:07:50] to be for my good
[1:07:52] it's going to be for my benefit god's
[1:07:53] going to take care of it he's the lord
[1:07:55] that healeth thee
[1:07:58] not just your physical but you're
[1:08:00] spiritual
[1:08:01] he takes care of us he watches over us
[1:08:04] the bible says his angels are encamped
[1:08:06] around about those that love him and
[1:08:08] fear him amen
[1:08:10] if those angels are there friend you let
[1:08:13] that devil try to penetrate that those
[1:08:15] angels will come forth with those
[1:08:16] flaming swords and strike their heads
[1:08:18] off
[1:08:19] now that's metaphorically in our human
[1:08:22] vernacular because it doesn't exactly
[1:08:23] happen that way but those devils have to
[1:08:26] stay at bay yeah they cannot get to you
[1:08:30] i cannot
[1:08:32] i will not
[1:08:33] succumb to the thought process that i
[1:08:36] hear today that somehow satan is certain
[1:08:39] through coven satan is circumventing the
[1:08:41] will of god no not for his children he's
[1:08:44] not right absolutely not
[1:08:47] can't happen won't happen
[1:08:49] god's in charge not him now this is
[1:08:52] satan's eating he's in charge of the
[1:08:54] government and the banking in all this
[1:08:56] world but he's not in charge of god's
[1:08:57] children
[1:08:59] god's in charge of his own children
[1:09:01] we are amen
[1:09:04] he's in charge of us so job was hedged
[1:09:07] satan could not get to him
[1:09:10] and then when he allowed him
[1:09:13] to get to him he gave him limitations
[1:09:16] he said you can do whatever you want to
[1:09:18] job to jobs what to job's possessions
[1:09:21] but don't you touch job
[1:09:23] now did you notice
[1:09:25] god took
[1:09:28] a satan took his children took his
[1:09:30] servants took his animals took his
[1:09:33] buildings took basically everything but
[1:09:35] he didn't touch his wife
[1:09:37] right why did satan
[1:09:40] not touch job's wife
[1:09:42] because she was a part of him
[1:09:46] she was part of job
[1:09:48] and satan couldn't touch her anymore he
[1:09:50] could jobs
[1:09:51] that's why that's why satan couldn't
[1:09:54] touch the wife because she's a part of
[1:09:55] job and the command from god was you can
[1:09:57] do everything that job has but don't
[1:10:00] touch him
[1:10:01] she's a part of him so she stayed safe
[1:10:04] too
[1:10:05] satan took everything else
[1:10:08] and then god and then satan come back to
[1:10:09] god and said
[1:10:12] well walking to and fro
[1:10:14] he's have you considered my servant job
[1:10:16] yeah but i've done this and that so well
[1:10:18] you've turned to me against him for no
[1:10:20] reason
[1:10:21] for no reason i remember that for no
[1:10:23] reason
[1:10:25] a lot of people seem to well there's got
[1:10:26] to be a reason and there's obviously no
[1:10:29] matter what happens somebody gets sick
[1:10:30] well there's you know somebody dies off
[1:10:34] it's got to be because this that and the
[1:10:35] other
[1:10:37] there was no reason why god allowed to
[1:10:41] happen to job what happened to him
[1:10:43] none not according to the scripture
[1:10:45] none that god said none that god put his
[1:10:47] word on that god told job
[1:10:50] he called job a perfect and upright man
[1:10:53] right
[1:10:54] feared god and is stewed or turned aside
[1:10:57] from evil that was job
[1:11:00] god had no right there was no correction
[1:11:02] coming for job like his secret sinner
[1:11:04] friends would say there was none of that
[1:11:08] god just what he trusted job
[1:11:10] and he was using job to prove to the
[1:11:13] devil that there are people that will
[1:11:15] stand for god regardless of what happens
[1:11:18] regardless of what comes upon their
[1:11:21] lives and in their path
[1:11:23] nothing can change that
[1:11:25] praise the lord and thank god i
[1:11:29] job i love you buddy
[1:11:31] thank you for the testimony and what you
[1:11:33] suffered for us to have what we have
[1:11:34] today to know what we know right god did
[1:11:37] it for a purpose not that job had done
[1:11:39] anything wrong
[1:11:41] but then god said now you can touch job
[1:11:43] the second time
[1:11:45] see satan had that limitation you can do
[1:11:47] all this but don't touch job now you
[1:11:50] notice the first go around nothing
[1:11:51] happened to job nothing happened to his
[1:11:53] wife
[1:11:54] satan couldn't lay a finger on joe now
[1:11:56] the second go-round god said you can do
[1:11:59] whatever you want to job but don't take
[1:12:01] his life you can't take his life
[1:12:03] be amazing what you can live through
[1:12:05] though right
[1:12:06] you can do anything to him but don't
[1:12:08] take his life
[1:12:09] so now god strikes uh safe he strikes
[1:12:12] joel with sword balls from the top of
[1:12:14] his hands to the soul of his feet did
[1:12:15] you imagine joel sitting there on the
[1:12:17] flesh
[1:12:18] the heap of his own flesh saying god
[1:12:20] what is going on
[1:12:21] what have i done where did i go wrong
[1:12:24] but see that's just it that's a lot of
[1:12:26] the times that people had the same
[1:12:28] thought process god what did i do wrong
[1:12:30] what happened here nothing
[1:12:33] it may not have been anything now
[1:12:36] there's nothing wrong with the question
[1:12:37] because maybe there is a reason but it
[1:12:39] isn't always a reason but humanity
[1:12:43] people we always have to have a reason
[1:12:45] we got to be able to reason it out
[1:12:47] friend we got to be able to explain it
[1:12:49] will this happen because this no no it
[1:12:51] may not happen for anything other than
[1:12:53] the fact that it was god's choosing and
[1:12:56] he's sovereign and he can do what he
[1:12:57] wants
[1:12:59] it's his choice
[1:13:00] he can decide and determine to do
[1:13:02] whatever he wants to when he wants to
[1:13:03] how he wants to and does anybody here
[1:13:05] got a better idea than he does
[1:13:08] you got a better plan than god
[1:13:11] you got a better idea than god
[1:13:13] you got something better than what god
[1:13:15] can offer
[1:13:16] there isn't any
[1:13:18] so we just trust him
[1:13:20] amen we just trust and believe him now
[1:13:23] if job
[1:13:24] if satan now was allowed to touch job
[1:13:27] now that means that that that satan
[1:13:30] could do what he wanted you to job but
[1:13:32] take his life
[1:13:33] satan was not allowed to take his life
[1:13:35] and if you ever notice in the scripture
[1:13:37] all the way through the scripture god's
[1:13:39] children satan has never god has allowed
[1:13:42] satan to do things to god to his
[1:13:44] children god's allowed satan to do
[1:13:46] things but he's never allowed in the
[1:13:49] entire bible satan to take one of his
[1:13:52] children's life that is god's choice
[1:13:54] that's his decision and his timing
[1:13:57] never and if it's not a scriptural
[1:14:00] precedent saints it's not happening
[1:14:02] today
[1:14:03] absolutely
[1:14:05] now when satan touched job sore boils
[1:14:08] but now notice satan didn't only touch
[1:14:11] job but he touched job's
[1:14:12] wife now right because satan got on his
[1:14:16] wife with an evil spirit
[1:14:19] and
[1:14:19] and came up and basically cursed her
[1:14:21] husband job and said why don't you just
[1:14:23] curse god with god you're just a
[1:14:25] miserable man laying there on the heap
[1:14:27] of your own flesh just curse him and die
[1:14:30] well that wasn't her normal
[1:14:32] normally right but a spirit had gotten
[1:14:35] on her
[1:14:36] and the reason it is is because god
[1:14:38] allowed her to allow
[1:14:40] you touch job
[1:14:42] so he was allowed to touch him and his
[1:14:44] wife
[1:14:46] but now read this
[1:14:48] now his friends come
[1:14:50] and notice joe was in such grief that
[1:14:52] even when his friends were coming up to
[1:14:54] comfort him they were far off and joe
[1:14:58] was in such grief they could tell from
[1:15:01] oh
[1:15:02] i'm going to say a mile i don't know but
[1:15:04] they could tell from a distance that he
[1:15:06] was in despair
[1:15:07] the anguish that he was going through
[1:15:09] you read it but i want to get to this
[1:15:11] now elephants when they come and they're
[1:15:14] trying to comfort him
[1:15:16] eliphaz makes this statement now he's
[1:15:18] quoting scripture here
[1:15:20] in deuteronomy you know maybe if i have
[1:15:21] a minute we'll read that scripture
[1:15:24] because i i want us to see
[1:15:27] this there's a few scriptures in the
[1:15:28] bible that that refer to this but he's
[1:15:31] quoting scripture eliphaz is quoting
[1:15:33] scripture when he looks at this
[1:15:36] uh vote job 5
[1:15:43] 17
[1:15:44] behold
[1:15:45] happy is the man whom god corrected
[1:15:49] therefore despise not now the chastening
[1:15:53] of the almighty
[1:15:55] now that's one of job's comforters
[1:15:57] and every bit of it is wrong
[1:16:01] job wasn't being chastised
[1:16:04] job hadn't done anything wrong see the
[1:16:07] inference here is that job was the
[1:16:09] secret sinner
[1:16:10] that job was doing things he shouldn't
[1:16:12] have been doing and god's correcting him
[1:16:14] for that god is giving him a spiritual
[1:16:16] spanking now
[1:16:19] that's the inference that elephants is
[1:16:21] giving him happy is the man who god uh
[1:16:24] is correcting
[1:16:26] despised not thou to chase thee god
[1:16:29] wasn't chastening job
[1:16:31] it probably felt like it
[1:16:33] you look at it you say well that's not
[1:16:35] any different than this and they look
[1:16:37] the same to me
[1:16:39] but god wasn't chastening job
[1:16:41] god wasn't correcting job job in god's
[1:16:44] eyes was perfect and upright god was
[1:16:47] just using job to prove to the devil
[1:16:50] that god has children gonna live for and
[1:16:52] it's gonna serve him regardless
[1:16:54] amen he hasn't done anything wrong
[1:16:57] but you notice the inference see there's
[1:16:58] got to be that reason
[1:17:01] well job this all happened to you my
[1:17:03] friend but there's got to be a reason
[1:17:05] why it happened
[1:17:08] what did you do
[1:17:10] where have you been going lately
[1:17:12] how have you been acting
[1:17:14] what secret sins have you been committed
[1:17:16] this this job there's
[1:17:18] people get in their minds especially
[1:17:20] non-spiritual people that this is a
[1:17:23] result
[1:17:24] of something else and it wasn't
[1:17:28] it wasn't a result of something that job
[1:17:30] had done
[1:17:31] it wasn't the result of anything job had
[1:17:33] said or that the how job was living it
[1:17:36] wasn't a result of any of that
[1:17:39] understand
[1:17:40] i said these things happen now you say
[1:17:42] why then i don't understand
[1:17:44] then don't try to understand just leave
[1:17:47] it to god
[1:17:50] god i love you
[1:17:51] god i trust you
[1:17:53] and that's it right and that's where it
[1:17:55] is that's where it stays and for a child
[1:17:58] of god with the holy spirit that's all
[1:18:00] you need
[1:18:01] that's what you need
[1:18:03] because that's what gives comfort that's
[1:18:05] what gives direction and strength
[1:18:08] job hadn't done anything wrong
[1:18:11] but in man's mind he had to have or this
[1:18:14] wouldn't have happened right
[1:18:16] it's not always that way for him
[1:18:19] but people will always try to point it
[1:18:21] to something there's a reason see
[1:18:23] there was no reason but now look at this
[1:18:26] now he's right here this is the
[1:18:27] scripture he's pointing to
[1:18:30] not not that the scripture was written
[1:18:31] when he said this i don't mean that
[1:18:34] but he said 18th verse for he now this
[1:18:36] is still eliphaz
[1:18:38] for he god maketh sore
[1:18:41] and bindeth up
[1:18:43] he god woundeth
[1:18:46] and his hands make whole
[1:18:48] now that is true
[1:18:50] that is scripture look at uh
[1:18:53] we'll look at a couple of these
[1:18:54] scriptures real quick deuteronomy
[1:18:55] chapter 32. now you don't need to turn
[1:18:58] there if you don't want i'm just going
[1:18:59] to read it real quick deuteronomy 32 39
[1:19:02] says
[1:19:03] see now that i even i am he
[1:19:06] and there is no god with me
[1:19:09] i heal and i make a lie
[1:19:12] i wound and i heal
[1:19:15] that's god
[1:19:17] neither is there any that can deliver me
[1:19:20] out of my delivered out of my hand
[1:19:24] who is
[1:19:26] what is god telling us
[1:19:29] the the bottom line to this is god is
[1:19:31] telling us i am god
[1:19:34] i am in control
[1:19:35] i do this way i do this way i do it like
[1:19:38] this he said uh
[1:19:40] jacob i love and he saw hate for either
[1:19:42] boy was born
[1:19:45] who's going to say that's just or unjust
[1:19:47] looks unjust me
[1:19:49] as a human but it's not to god
[1:19:52] not scripturally especially when you
[1:19:54] break it down and understand why
[1:19:58] oh
[1:19:59] praise the lord look god's the one
[1:20:01] that's in charge god's the one that's in
[1:20:03] control he's the lord that healeth thee
[1:20:07] he is the lord that brings the bomb in
[1:20:09] gilead that takes him and dives down
[1:20:12] into the spirit where a doctor can't
[1:20:14] even reach not even a psychiatrist
[1:20:17] and he can die down in there and he can
[1:20:19] tweak and he can move and he can make
[1:20:21] and smooth that the way it's supposed to
[1:20:23] be in your life because look friend god
[1:20:26] loves you
[1:20:29] god wants you happy
[1:20:31] and joyful god wants you in the perfect
[1:20:34] condition that you should be in so he
[1:20:36] can use you
[1:20:38] so that he can live through you
[1:20:41] he doesn't want you despaired he doesn't
[1:20:43] want you down you know a lot of times
[1:20:45] people get depressed and despaired
[1:20:48] because their expectations are way up
[1:20:50] here when god's like don't
[1:20:52] what we're doing is here
[1:20:55] not up here
[1:20:56] and sometimes people get their
[1:20:58] expectations out of line
[1:21:00] with the spirit and the move of god's
[1:21:02] will
[1:21:04] if we can just get to the blasphemy i
[1:21:06] believe brother that paul talked about
[1:21:08] being content finding contentment
[1:21:10] amen
[1:21:12] finding contentment is great gain saints
[1:21:15] when you find contentment there's no
[1:21:17] there's no discouragement or depression
[1:21:19] in contentment
[1:21:21] there's only the the
[1:21:23] the understanding and the belief the
[1:21:25] feeling that you're in the the place
[1:21:27] that where god wants you to be
[1:21:31] now
[1:21:32] if you're not living a godly life if
[1:21:35] you're not born again if you're not one
[1:21:36] of his god's not in charge of that
[1:21:39] amen and and if you're not living right
[1:21:41] if you're not do it that's a whole
[1:21:43] nother story i'm talking about those
[1:21:45] that are born again filled with the
[1:21:46] spirit belong to god and are his charge
[1:21:49] that's what i'm talking about amen when
[1:21:51] that place gets there then saying you've
[1:21:53] got to have that revelation
[1:21:55] you've got to have that revelation don't
[1:21:57] ever let the devil think you're not a
[1:21:58] child of god don't ever let the devil
[1:22:01] try to deceive you into thinking that
[1:22:02] you're not one of god
[1:22:04] you belong to him saint i tell you i
[1:22:06] believe that with all of us sitting here
[1:22:09] you're one of gods if you're one of
[1:22:11] god's then we're just destined to be in
[1:22:14] that position where god wants us to be
[1:22:17] so much depression in the world today a
[1:22:20] lot of times comes because
[1:22:22] not you here but the social media yeah
[1:22:25] the expectations oh if i could just act
[1:22:28] a fool on the uh uh uh on a
[1:22:32] tick tock or something i could be a
[1:22:34] millionaire
[1:22:36] and people are doing it
[1:22:39] acting i'm sorry i shouldn't use that
[1:22:41] word but acting like idiots sometimes
[1:22:44] and risking their lives and all kinds of
[1:22:47] crazy stupid stuff
[1:22:49] eating laundry detergent
[1:22:52] drinking and these are just a few of the
[1:22:53] things i've heard and i have nothing to
[1:22:55] do i don't care anything about it but
[1:22:57] that's just a few of the things i've
[1:22:58] heard
[1:22:59] and want to get rich off of it there's a
[1:23:02] whole new phenomenon today people say
[1:23:04] what do you do for a living oh i'm a
[1:23:06] doctor i'm an accountant i'm a lawyer
[1:23:08] i'm a a cpa i'm an electrician i'm a
[1:23:11] plumber a
[1:23:12] a i'm a
[1:23:14] purchasing agent i'm an engineer
[1:23:16] whatever nowadays
[1:23:18] yes
[1:23:19] you know one out of a hundred people
[1:23:20] there what do you do oh i'm a i'm a a a
[1:23:24] social media uh a media person
[1:23:27] i i'm a star on social media or
[1:23:30] something it's become an actual vocation
[1:23:32] that people do
[1:23:34] and they show these people they got all
[1:23:36] these riches and the
[1:23:38] beautiful for naught they get a doctor
[1:23:40] to take care of that
[1:23:41] and
[1:23:42] and all these great grants you see
[1:23:44] that's what satan tries to offer all
[1:23:46] these beautiful great grandeur stuff
[1:23:48] when all these god is hell and death
[1:23:51] that's all he's really got to offer
[1:23:53] anybody is death and hell
[1:23:55] but in this satan's eating and all the
[1:23:57] great uh looking at all these great
[1:23:59] things that try to promise everybody
[1:24:01] this and that and people get these great
[1:24:03] aspirations and they think well if that
[1:24:05] aspiration is not met then they get into
[1:24:07] a place of depression
[1:24:09] or despair
[1:24:11] oh my
[1:24:12] just
[1:24:13] trust the lord and take what his perfect
[1:24:16] will is in your life and continue to
[1:24:18] march on
[1:24:19] believe god
[1:24:21] he's with me
[1:24:22] he's going to take care of me
[1:24:24] he's with me
[1:24:25] and this world is not my home in any way
[1:24:28] amen i have a greater
[1:24:31] a greater home waiting for me hosea 6 1
[1:24:34] come and let us return unto the lord for
[1:24:36] he hath torn
[1:24:38] the god has god has torn
[1:24:41] and he will heal us
[1:24:43] he has torn and he will heal us
[1:24:47] he has smitten and he will bind us up
[1:24:51] praise the lord
[1:24:53] he will bring us together he will tie us
[1:24:55] together now there's a couple of
[1:24:57] different meanings to this bind up i'll
[1:25:00] i'll say that in a few minutes so i've
[1:25:01] got another scripture i want to read but
[1:25:03] god breaks and then he mends
[1:25:06] remember the the
[1:25:08] the story of the shepherd
[1:25:10] uh when one of his sheep gets loose he
[1:25:12] goes out he'll leave the 90 and nine to
[1:25:14] go get that one and bring it back into
[1:25:16] the fold again because that one is just
[1:25:17] as important as the 99
[1:25:20] and if that sheep runs out again he'll
[1:25:21] go get that sheep and he'll break his
[1:25:23] leg so he can't do that again
[1:25:25] but then he'll put him around his arms
[1:25:27] over his shoulders and he'll mend that
[1:25:29] sheet back to health and he'll fix his
[1:25:31] leg and he'll make it all just
[1:25:33] go back perfect again and then the sheep
[1:25:36] gets all healed and mended and back in
[1:25:38] this place it's supposed to be and it
[1:25:39] keeps them from running again
[1:25:42] amen now that's chastisement
[1:25:44] amen that that's a point of chastisement
[1:25:47] at that point god correcting
[1:25:49] uh god causing them to keep from going
[1:25:52] off again going astray
[1:25:54] but god's the one that
[1:25:56] tares
[1:25:57] and he's the one that mends
[1:25:59] he's the one that heals
[1:26:01] so many times
[1:26:03] it affects us in different ways that we
[1:26:05] may not understand but it's still god in
[1:26:07] control
[1:26:09] it's still god in charge it's still god
[1:26:12] doing it the way he wants us to do it
[1:26:15] and we just want to succumb to his will
[1:26:18] lord
[1:26:19] think about this we sang that song
[1:26:22] earlier
[1:26:25] at the cross
[1:26:28] and in that song it talks about jesus
[1:26:30] and of course his suffering and what he
[1:26:32] did for us
[1:26:33] when he went to california
[1:26:35] but then my mind as i sing that song and
[1:26:37] i think about it goes back even before
[1:26:39] he was crucified before the cross
[1:26:42] before jesus died
[1:26:44] physically
[1:26:46] he walks into the garden of gethsemane
[1:26:49] he goes for the through the maui that
[1:26:51] valley where all the blood used from all
[1:26:53] the sacrifices would run
[1:26:55] and he goes and he has to walk through
[1:26:57] this valley to get to that garden
[1:26:59] and when he gets there of course you can
[1:27:01] just imagine the humanity of jesus was
[1:27:03] thinking about all this blood of what
[1:27:04] he's about to do
[1:27:06] what he's about to have to go through
[1:27:09] and jesus went to the garden of
[1:27:10] gethsemane
[1:27:12] god built in flesh knelt down and said
[1:27:14] if it would be thy will let this cup
[1:27:17] pass for me
[1:27:19] he asked that
[1:27:21] how many times have you asked that
[1:27:23] i know i have
[1:27:25] lord if it's at all possible please
[1:27:27] don't let this come god
[1:27:30] but then in the end he said lord not my
[1:27:32] will but thou be done
[1:27:34] right jesus was in such despair that his
[1:27:37] sweat became as drops of blood
[1:27:40] now i know some people say and and if
[1:27:42] you believe it that way that's okay but
[1:27:45] that he started sweating blood that's
[1:27:47] not what it says
[1:27:48] it's it says his sweat became as drops
[1:27:52] of blood in other words his blood
[1:27:54] drops off of you know when i got smacked
[1:27:56] in the face and i bent over blood was
[1:27:58] just dripping there was drops coming off
[1:28:01] of my face and i thought that's exactly
[1:28:03] what the sweat was like coming off of
[1:28:05] him as he was agonizing over about what
[1:28:08] he was about to go through
[1:28:09] about what was about to happen to him
[1:28:12] but him and his own flesh had to die to
[1:28:15] himself
[1:28:16] he had to succumb to what he wanted to
[1:28:19] happen
[1:28:20] to allow the will of god to prevail
[1:28:23] to allow god to move him and bring him
[1:28:26] to the place of that sacrificial lamb
[1:28:29] so that all of us could receive
[1:28:31] redemption
[1:28:32] so that all of us could receive the holy
[1:28:34] ghost
[1:28:35] one time it was just him
[1:28:37] all of it the fullness of the godhead
[1:28:39] body was in christ
[1:28:41] but he had to go and shed that blood the
[1:28:43] life
[1:28:44] he had to go shed that life that was in
[1:28:46] the blood it wasn't necessarily the
[1:28:48] chemistry of the blood although that
[1:28:49] redeemed the earth back this physical
[1:28:52] earth the blood of christ dropped on it
[1:28:54] to redeem it back but the light that was
[1:28:56] in the blood
[1:28:57] had to come forth and come on to every
[1:29:00] believer ever since that happened
[1:29:02] and that life that was in the blood now
[1:29:04] is what we
[1:29:06] holds and sustains us and keeps us where
[1:29:08] we're supposed to be filled with his
[1:29:10] spirit because once what was in him is
[1:29:13] now in us
[1:29:15] amen
[1:29:17] we get to the same place his flesh did
[1:29:19] sometimes
[1:29:20] amen
[1:29:21] jesus lived without sin didn't he the
[1:29:24] bible said he was without sin he did no
[1:29:27] wrong
[1:29:27] so even when he was in the garden of
[1:29:29] gethsemane and he was questioning
[1:29:32] and he was asking god
[1:29:36] let this cup pass for me that was not a
[1:29:39] sinful act
[1:29:40] you understand
[1:29:42] so asking the proverbial why is not a
[1:29:45] sin
[1:29:46] it's not a transgression against god
[1:29:49] it wasn't even an act of unbelief
[1:29:52] because jesus was sinless perfect and he
[1:29:57] did the same thing
[1:29:58] he asked the same question
[1:30:00] so you asking that same question does it
[1:30:03] make you a non-believer
[1:30:05] doesn't make you a sinner it doesn't
[1:30:07] take you down and god's wrong a notch
[1:30:09] which that's what some people would say
[1:30:11] god doesn't have notches
[1:30:13] but some people think that
[1:30:16] god doesn't bring you down or chastise
[1:30:19] you that's unbelief no that's not
[1:30:22] it's just your manatee
[1:30:24] your humanity is questioning god why
[1:30:27] lord why and
[1:30:28] i don't know about you but
[1:30:31] i've had several wives in my life
[1:30:35] most of them god's never answered
[1:30:37] that i could recall
[1:30:40] some of them you can look back and say
[1:30:42] well maybe why this has happened maybe
[1:30:44] this is why this happened
[1:30:46] i know my wife went through a lot until
[1:30:47] she was
[1:30:48] well until she met me then she really
[1:30:50] went through a lot
[1:30:52] but not until after she married me and
[1:30:54] this you really went through a lot but
[1:30:57] when she was younger up until six years
[1:30:59] old till the time she was adopted she
[1:31:01] went through a lot and then after she
[1:31:02] was adopted went through a lot and you
[1:31:04] think why
[1:31:06] but see even when she was in that place
[1:31:08] god was giving her visions god was
[1:31:10] showing her dreams
[1:31:12] she saw these she didn't even understand
[1:31:15] it of course she's a little girl can you
[1:31:16] imagine three four years old
[1:31:19] seeing something of these old people
[1:31:21] coming in and saying who are these old
[1:31:22] gray-haired people there's nothing here
[1:31:24] nuns but a bunch of little kids
[1:31:26] well the women that would that would
[1:31:27] turn out to be the people that adopted
[1:31:29] her
[1:31:30] she runs when they come in because she
[1:31:32] shot she goes runs under a table so that
[1:31:34] the girls
[1:31:35] that they wanted to adopt as a little
[1:31:37] baby doll for couldn't couldn't see her
[1:31:41] and she was considered unadoptable at
[1:31:43] the time
[1:31:44] so the the girl that come in they want
[1:31:46] to get her
[1:31:47] her as a baby doll for her come in and
[1:31:50] she was shot
[1:31:52] the girl was shot
[1:31:54] so when she saw sonya hiding at the
[1:31:56] table she thought she was shy too even
[1:31:58] though she's not
[1:32:00] my wife's quite an extrovert she's not
[1:32:03] shot but because she was hiding under
[1:32:05] the table the girl thought she was shy
[1:32:07] and she said i want her
[1:32:11] well most people come in want a little
[1:32:13] little baby
[1:32:17] she's two or three years old considered
[1:32:19] unadoptable at that point
[1:32:21] and she did something that was out of
[1:32:22] character but it was exactly what god
[1:32:24] had orchestrated to bring her to the
[1:32:26] place she needed to be
[1:32:29] you know understand all those things and
[1:32:31] then you think god why did it have to be
[1:32:34] this way and then in my early ministry i
[1:32:36] used to have her to come up because
[1:32:37] ministers would ask me you mind if your
[1:32:39] wife would give her testimony i said oh
[1:32:41] she loved to you know 15 20 minutes
[1:32:43] whatever it was she'd come up and so
[1:32:45] many people were blessed just by their
[1:32:47] testimony of what she had gone through
[1:32:50] and i say that because it reminds me
[1:32:52] back of job again
[1:32:54] and why and what everything job went
[1:32:56] through what a blessing has been to so
[1:32:58] many people ever since i know it has me
[1:33:02] job if you didn't go through this for
[1:33:03] anybody else but for me thank you buddy
[1:33:07] i'm glad she showed me something she
[1:33:09] went through a lot but it blessed a lot
[1:33:11] of people her testimony people would
[1:33:13] come up to arrive to church tears
[1:33:15] rolling and thank her for for her
[1:33:18] testimony it meant so much to him see
[1:33:20] you don't know why god does certain
[1:33:23] things and sometimes the proverbial wild
[1:33:25] never be answered maybe on the other
[1:33:27] side but it's like the song we're saying
[1:33:29] friend when you get on the other side
[1:33:30] you probably don't care anyway
[1:33:34] someone said when i get there i'm gonna
[1:33:35] go ask jesus why no no
[1:33:38] thank you god that i'm here no wise no
[1:33:40] worries i i'm not questioning god i'm
[1:33:42] just thankful to be here if i'm the foot
[1:33:45] if i'm the doormat at the front door
[1:33:47] that's as long as i'm here amen i'll be
[1:33:50] glad i made it all those wives will just
[1:33:52] disappear
[1:33:54] they'll just kind of go away it won't
[1:33:56] really matter but in our humanity and
[1:33:58] our flesh here so many times it's
[1:34:00] exactly what comes in our minds
[1:34:03] but he's the lord that heals
[1:34:06] he binds the wounds look at these psalms
[1:34:09] another man
[1:34:10] that knows a lot about wounds
[1:34:15] um if you've read my book you see what
[1:34:18] uh a little what david went through
[1:34:20] especially by the hand of saul
[1:34:24] but not only saw his own son absalom
[1:34:27] what david went through but look at this
[1:34:29] in the psalm 147
[1:34:32] um
[1:34:34] verse three
[1:34:36] let's just start reading verse one
[1:34:38] praise ye the lord for it is good to
[1:34:40] sing praises unto our god amen
[1:34:44] for it is pleasant and praise is comely
[1:34:48] the lord built up jerusalem he gathered
[1:34:51] together the outcasts of israel
[1:34:54] he healeth the broken in heart amen the
[1:34:57] heart the spirit the spiritual healing
[1:35:00] he healeth the broken in heart and
[1:35:03] bindeth up their wounds
[1:35:05] binded them now the body that we read a
[1:35:07] minute ago
[1:35:08] refers to because it has the dual
[1:35:11] purpose meaning here if you look it up
[1:35:13] you'll see the buying binder has a dual
[1:35:16] purpose meeting
[1:35:17] that binding is say well you take
[1:35:19] something and you bind it up is it's
[1:35:21] like when joel had his surgery when they
[1:35:23] got done with the surgery they bound his
[1:35:25] wound up
[1:35:27] but there's also another
[1:35:29] reference to this binding because when
[1:35:31] it comes to the heart
[1:35:33] you don't take the heart
[1:35:35] and wrap it with with gauze or with a an
[1:35:38] ace bandage or something
[1:35:41] not the heart
[1:35:42] so what do you do god binds up that
[1:35:45] wound of the heart how does he do that
[1:35:48] he restrains
[1:35:50] in other words he holds back
[1:35:52] he keeps back or he binds that wound
[1:35:56] so that it's not so hurtful in your
[1:35:58] heart see not so hurtful in your spirit
[1:36:02] that binding means like uh
[1:36:06] like
[1:36:07] well let's just go back to the dog again
[1:36:09] if there's a little kid in here
[1:36:10] and a mean dog that wanted to hurt you
[1:36:13] well if that dog could get at you he
[1:36:15] would
[1:36:16] but if you take that dog and you bind
[1:36:18] him up
[1:36:20] you understand you restrain him he can't
[1:36:23] get to you
[1:36:25] and that's another binding aspect that
[1:36:27] goes into the spiritual healing of the
[1:36:30] spiritual wounds he binds them
[1:36:33] so that it doesn't hurt
[1:36:35] as bad and that's when we when we go to
[1:36:38] the lord and we have trust in him he
[1:36:40] binds and holds back that wound the hurt
[1:36:43] of that wound so that it doesn't it
[1:36:45] doesn't affect you as bad
[1:36:48] it doesn't hurt as badly because we
[1:36:50] trust in god
[1:36:53] my mom passed away two years ago march
[1:36:56] this coming march
[1:36:59] my dad spent almost 30 years my sister
[1:37:01] 19
[1:37:02] 1993 my brother not long after that i
[1:37:06] mean i got my son in
[1:37:08] 1989 i've got so many of my family
[1:37:10] waiting on the other side for me
[1:37:13] but each time
[1:37:15] because of him
[1:37:18] and multiple things that's happened in
[1:37:20] our lives in our married lives with our
[1:37:22] children grandchildren i mean there's
[1:37:24] been so many things and i just say this
[1:37:26] because i identified with myself
[1:37:29] you identify with yourself amen we all
[1:37:32] have to identify with ourselves
[1:37:35] i identify that with myself i can give
[1:37:37] my example because i lived it
[1:37:40] but when it happened
[1:37:42] i
[1:37:43] it's hard yes
[1:37:46] and i have asked why many times
[1:37:50] but then when it boils down i'd say
[1:37:51] thank you lord jesus
[1:37:53] for whatever purpose whatever reason
[1:37:55] you've got this for god you're going to
[1:37:57] take care of it right here to take care
[1:37:59] of me
[1:38:00] you're going to take care and bind this
[1:38:02] from my spirit
[1:38:05] i miss my mom dearly i can't even begin
[1:38:08] to tell you how dearly
[1:38:10] how to post a picture of us when we were
[1:38:12] up back there all of us and went back
[1:38:15] and i just started bawling because i
[1:38:18] pissed her
[1:38:19] but i know she's in a better place yes
[1:38:22] and that's not hyperbole saints that's
[1:38:25] just the truth
[1:38:26] it's just fact
[1:38:28] that's not something just to help me get
[1:38:30] by from day to day right
[1:38:32] it's not just uh
[1:38:35] some phrases you stick in no it's
[1:38:38] reality
[1:38:39] then i know she's better off now
[1:38:42] even though i miss her
[1:38:44] but that that wound in my spirit gets
[1:38:47] bound
[1:38:50] and restrained
[1:38:52] because of the realization that i have
[1:38:55] that she's in the arms of the lord that
[1:38:58] i'm going to meet her be with her again
[1:39:02] sometimes i visualize
[1:39:05] my family because you know we're not far
[1:39:07] from that my opinion right i believe the
[1:39:09] rapture is so close friend our loved
[1:39:11] ones are going to start appearing
[1:39:13] and i start visualizing
[1:39:16] seeing my parents come
[1:39:19] but when i start visualizing it i don't
[1:39:21] see my mom as she passed
[1:39:23] i see her in the pictures i remember
[1:39:25] when she was 20 years old
[1:39:27] my dad when he was 20 years old
[1:39:31] my sister got pictures my son my brother
[1:39:35] i got pictures i visualized i can see
[1:39:37] them at that age
[1:39:39] now my son i have a hard time with
[1:39:41] because he was only a day and a half old
[1:39:44] that one's a little tougher
[1:39:46] kind of have an idea
[1:39:48] but
[1:39:49] that was a little tougher but in my
[1:39:51] mind's
[1:39:52] eye that wound gets bound it gets
[1:39:56] restrained
[1:39:57] because of the the fact that i know
[1:40:01] that we're going to be together again
[1:40:03] and it won't be that long
[1:40:05] it won't be that much longer amen
[1:40:08] i i i
[1:40:09] first of all
[1:40:11] i don't have that many more years left
[1:40:12] on this earth i'm on the waning side of
[1:40:15] this life
[1:40:17] not as waning as some of you but way
[1:40:19] more waning than many of you
[1:40:22] as i look at the young ones in the back
[1:40:27] but even at that
[1:40:30] even if by the way of the grave we're
[1:40:32] just
[1:40:33] we're getting older and i'll tell you
[1:40:36] this
[1:40:38] and i'll i'm gonna close but
[1:40:42] it hit me hard
[1:40:43] i say hard in a different way
[1:40:47] when i turn 56
[1:40:49] i don't know why or what came about in
[1:40:52] my life but all of a sudden i remembered
[1:40:55] brother branham was 56 when he passed
[1:40:56] away
[1:40:58] and that hit hard i started thinking my
[1:41:01] and then i started thinking the same
[1:41:02] thing he did
[1:41:04] if you're going to do anything you
[1:41:05] better get busy
[1:41:07] your days on this earth are numbered my
[1:41:09] friend
[1:41:11] but i believe the rapture's that close
[1:41:13] too
[1:41:14] amen
[1:41:15] i believe the rapture is that close too
[1:41:17] but it becomes a reality at that point
[1:41:20] and then you really start thinking god
[1:41:22] what what god is doing for us
[1:41:25] amen what god is doing for us
[1:41:28] let me read this the
[1:41:30] masterpiece give to us the desires of
[1:41:33] our heart for we truly have these
[1:41:35] desires to serve you
[1:41:37] and these weakening conditions and
[1:41:40] afflictions and things of the world that
[1:41:42] put us that are put upon us sometimes to
[1:41:44] perfect us we've been told that he said
[1:41:48] think it not strange that these trials
[1:41:50] come they're only working out
[1:41:52] for our good and to perfect us and to
[1:41:55] bring us into that place these great
[1:41:58] deserts of experiences where righteous
[1:42:01] men are molded into saints
[1:42:05] molded into saints molded into the
[1:42:07] character and the image that christ
[1:42:09] would have for us to be
[1:42:10] i think we're so close to that time
[1:42:12] though i gotta be honest and there may
[1:42:15] be another message in this i'm not sure
[1:42:17] but
[1:42:19] i think it's coming to the place that
[1:42:21] we're getting so close to
[1:42:23] to the coming of the lord that
[1:42:26] that what we're witnessing is is the
[1:42:29] final preparations that's going on
[1:42:32] the final preparations that are
[1:42:34] happening
[1:42:36] i had that in my mind the other day i
[1:42:38] told you before that all the people that
[1:42:40] are going
[1:42:41] people that we know friends family oh
[1:42:44] young
[1:42:46] some coveted some not
[1:42:48] different other things the lord's taking
[1:42:50] so many and again
[1:42:52] probably not even half of them with
[1:42:53] coleman so many other things reason that
[1:42:56] people are going passing on
[1:42:59] and so many i've never seen it to the
[1:43:01] place that it's been
[1:43:02] where so many have been going and i and
[1:43:04] yesterday and because i've said i don't
[1:43:07] know but yesterday it just came to me
[1:43:10] it made me think
[1:43:12] that
[1:43:13] this could very well
[1:43:14] be those final preparations the lord is
[1:43:16] making before he takes the alive and
[1:43:18] remain group before the dead raised and
[1:43:20] we go home
[1:43:23] it's winding itself up
[1:43:25] is that a par again i'll say this as i
[1:43:27] said earlier is that a part of that
[1:43:29] squeeze
[1:43:30] that brother bannon refers to
[1:43:32] now he talks about the squeeze coming
[1:43:34] from the ecumenical council but he also
[1:43:37] talked about the bride's not going to be
[1:43:38] going through a bunch of punishment but
[1:43:40] is that the preparation that's bringing
[1:43:42] us to that place
[1:43:45] are we so late
[1:43:47] that all these things happening and look
[1:43:51] god has blessed us so much in this
[1:43:53] church and god has been so good to us
[1:43:55] and i told you there's been so many
[1:43:56] miracles testimonies every one of us
[1:43:58] could stand right now and tell
[1:44:00] testimonies and miracles of things
[1:44:02] that's god's done for us in the past
[1:44:03] year or two right amen amen but look in
[1:44:06] the past and we came up and prayed about
[1:44:08] it but look in the past
[1:44:11] three months
[1:44:13] four months six months
[1:44:15] of the things there's not been any
[1:44:18] there's not been any of us unaffected by
[1:44:21] some adverse things taking the place in
[1:44:23] our lives and our families
[1:44:25] everybody everybody in here
[1:44:28] amen everybody all of us
[1:44:31] illnesses
[1:44:33] diseases hospitalizations operations
[1:44:37] passing on i won't say death because
[1:44:39] they're not dead
[1:44:41] brother angel brother charlie
[1:44:43] sicknesses people that have been
[1:44:46] not able to come
[1:44:49] it's affected all of us
[1:44:51] all of us in some way shape or form
[1:44:53] every one of us our families have been
[1:44:55] affected by it
[1:44:57] and look friend
[1:44:58] sometimes people look at that from the
[1:45:00] outside and say oh that's the cursings
[1:45:03] of god friend i look at it and say oh
[1:45:04] that's the blessings of god you say how
[1:45:07] could that be the blessings of god
[1:45:09] that's because god loves us and he's
[1:45:11] getting us in the position and shaping
[1:45:13] us and creating us into that image that
[1:45:15] he wants us to speak because we're about
[1:45:17] to go home
[1:45:19] that's my view of it that's the way i
[1:45:22] see it
[1:45:23] people say well
[1:45:24] that's a cursing of you you shouldn't go
[1:45:27] there
[1:45:28] you shouldn't even go to that church
[1:45:30] and there are people in this city that
[1:45:32] tell others that come here they
[1:45:34] shouldn't go here
[1:45:36] don't ever proselyte anybody's saints in
[1:45:40] the bible one person jesus talked about
[1:45:42] was a proselyte he said he's threefold
[1:45:44] more child the hell he was to start with
[1:45:48] that's nothing good spoken about it
[1:45:51] a proselytization
[1:45:53] in the bible that's of the devil
[1:45:56] but is the truth it's absolute truth
[1:46:00] and other people
[1:46:02] will look at it and think that's a curse
[1:46:05] no it's not
[1:46:06] it's not a curse
[1:46:08] i i think it's a blessing i think it's
[1:46:10] just god because he's mindful see
[1:46:13] because if you if you don't belong to
[1:46:14] god god just leaves you alone right
[1:46:18] i don't want to say he doesn't care but
[1:46:22] again who does who does tap to yell out
[1:46:24] in the backyard when when the kids are
[1:46:27] misbehaving
[1:46:29] it's joel not the other boys
[1:46:32] i i don't want to say god doesn't care
[1:46:34] about the rest of them but
[1:46:37] those aren't his children sir
[1:46:40] you are
[1:46:42] amen
[1:46:43] that's the way i see it
[1:46:45] amen
[1:46:46] god the lord that heals all of our
[1:46:49] diseases and i tell you
[1:46:52] as much as i was disturbed
[1:46:57] because i was looking so forward to
[1:46:59] having brother charlie nearing our
[1:47:00] church
[1:47:03] that
[1:47:05] chuck's testimony
[1:47:07] helped me a lot
[1:47:09] it did
[1:47:10] because i've been in tears this week
[1:47:11] over that and i appreciate that brother
[1:47:13] charlie that meant a lot to me not that
[1:47:14] i didn't
[1:47:16] believe that but when you hear a
[1:47:17] testimony like that
[1:47:19] and from his own son it just speaks
[1:47:21] volumes
[1:47:22] amen does to me did to me anyway witness
[1:47:25] to me
[1:47:26] what a blessing that is
[1:47:28] god's in charge of saints yes god's in
[1:47:31] charge of his children satan he's not in
[1:47:33] charge of his god's children satan's not
[1:47:35] out here taking god's children from this
[1:47:37] earth absolutely not
[1:47:39] not allowed to do it it's not scriptural
[1:47:41] amen
[1:47:42] can't do it now
[1:47:44] god's in charge of that praise the lord
[1:47:46] and how do we know
[1:47:49] any one of us could be the next one
[1:47:52] before the rapture i don't know
[1:47:54] i don't i'm trusting not
[1:47:56] i hope not
[1:47:58] that's my desire i hope not
[1:48:00] but then again when it come right down
[1:48:02] to it jesus finally had to say lord
[1:48:05] not my will but thou be done
[1:48:08] amen
[1:48:09] let's stand if we could
[1:48:18] is working a masterpiece in his bride
[1:48:20] yes
[1:48:23] she's to be the perfect image of him
[1:48:27] ready to take that rapture
[1:48:30] sometimes i feel like we maybe
[1:48:32] speak of that rapture a little
[1:48:35] differently than maybe we should
[1:48:39] kind of as an offshoot
[1:48:41] you know all the raptures here the
[1:48:43] rapture is coming the rapture's at hand
[1:48:45] but friend to me is
[1:48:47] so much more than that
[1:48:50] for a rapture to ever happen
[1:48:53] his bride internationally and some
[1:48:55] people say well they don't act like it
[1:48:57] well maybe they're not a part of it i
[1:49:00] don't put anybody in or take anybody out
[1:49:03] that's god's decision but i know
[1:49:06] god's people at god's time in god's way
[1:49:09] are going in a rapture
[1:49:11] regardless who is in it regardless not
[1:49:14] who in it who's not in it god it's going
