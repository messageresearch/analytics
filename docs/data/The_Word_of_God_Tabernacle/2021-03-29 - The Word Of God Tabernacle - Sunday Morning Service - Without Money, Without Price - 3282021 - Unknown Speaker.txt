you must be [Music] jesus is all that really matters [Applause] [Music] there is only one way to touch him you must be yes sir that's the truth isn't it it's faith that moves the hand of god you just believe that amen you know sometimes uh so many times people are waiting for god to move everybody keeps talking about god just waiting for god to move god would you move god would you do this you know sometimes god's waiting on us to move that's right god's waiting on us to make a step god's waiting on us to make a commitment god's waiting for us to take that step in that leap of faith if we can make that move then god says i'll meet you there so sometimes it didn't just wait and say god just move we'll move you know can't just sit down and say well god move god wants us to move god's sometimes waiting for us if we could just understand to get to that place of entering in i know it's been said so many times that he entering in and of worship of entering in and that praise of entering into that friend you see how god meets you there and because he inhabits the praises of his people so we just praise him worship him amen and just enter into that just make that move you say well i'm an introvert i don't i don't say much i don't i'm not very loud or boisterous god never asked me to be loud and boisterous he just asked you to worship him just praise him praise him in your own way but sometimes god's just waiting for that move from us to lift that hand or to give that gesture to sing that song or whatever it is and just wait and let god move and flow through you and flow through this uh there's this service this congregation here see sometimes it just takes just a little bit for god to enter in and god comes in and then when he comes in he meets you there then then you know what happened see see this is palm sunday as we worship and and thank god for palm sunday but palm sunday is that victorious return of the lord jesus people he came down through a a borrowed donkey he come down an alleyway and they worshiped him and they praised him and they uh threw palms and uh out in the out in the way and just worshiped him and said hosanna amen in the highest blessed be than him that comes in the name of the lord praise the lord jesus and and when they did that jesus come running riding down the way amen and they got to see it an appearance by the lord jesus amen god sweet to this place well lord but but jesus says well i want you to worship me i want you to praise me i want you to i want you to do something that that that that brings the inhabitation of of the spirit of god upon us and we do that and we see the moving of god he said well praise the lord see you get the touch of the lord right uh that that song that that zach sang is very dear to our hearts me and my wife because it wasn't long after our first son had passed away that we got in front of the whole church and and we sang blessed assurance i believe it was that the um it may have been micah's dedication we sang because after our first son had passed away and we got i believe it was a his dedication we sang blessed assurance and that blessed assurance was something that um that entered into our hearts when we were remembering back at uh you know because it hadn't even been a whole year that the the lord took um uh georgie our first son home to be with him and you know it was a very hard time very trying time but you know we just you just can't sit back on the seat of do nothing you can't you know sit in that little corner and have your pity party but you know because god knows best and we just continue to press the battle amen and in all things we gave him praise and all things we gave him glory and honor and know that he was going to take care of it all and he did amen may never understand why it happened but i know one thing my wife and myself and testified to probably tens of thousands of people about what the lord did and i know it's helped a lot of people because a lot of people come and say that and i don't know if that's why it happened that way we may never know but god just says just just take that step amen sometimes it's just taking that step you say well brother you just come so easy to you know it doesn't it never has uh i've told you before getting in front of a group of people was not something i did i was very very much an introvert uh i had my little circle of friends when i was in north carolina but then when i came to arizona i had no friends i had nothing i was just like a clam that was you just couldn't open with a stick of dynamite i was very much an introvert you can ask my wife she came up and spoke to me first time she ever said anything to me uh she said something about my voice and i just said thank you that's probably the most i'd spoke to anybody outside of my parents and i don't know how long and probably the last time i spoke to anybody for a long time after that uh when it didn't come it doesn't come easy but you know once you just make that move just give that effort and you just let the lord take over then then it's not you anymore then it's him amen and then he he inhabits the praises of his people praise the lord i feel his presence here today don't you i know he's here i feel his presence it's just so special saints we just enter into that and and just know that god is going to bless us how many times the people again they you know they have prayer requests and they have needs and they say god would you just would you just move on the need well sometimes i'm going to read something here in a little bit so i don't get ahead of myself but sometimes i just say you know what you do something you make the move i'll promise you i'll meet you there amen he talks about in his even in malachi 3 and tithing he says prove me yes amen see you've got to make the move prove me and see if i won't do what i tell it i told you i'll do you just prove me and see if it doesn't happen only place in the bible where god says prove me try me all he says just make that move and i promise you i'll meet you there praise the lord oh friend what a promise and has he ever gone back on that promise never not one time amen praise the lord i believe it's that time was just praise and worship the lord amen glorified it's palm sunday that's what they did the triumphant king rode through the city and they worshipped him and they praised him they gave him glory honor they threw the palms and all they did to praise the lord jesus amen so that's what we do we worship him he inhabits those praises too amen praise the lord let's stand if we could now we're going to turn our bibles to isaiah chapter 55. i had a little thing that i was going to message i thought i would bring today and as i studied on it stayed on it the the deeper it got the more involved it got and i said well this isn't going to be one service and next sunday lord willing i had something that laura put on my hearts kind of for a little bit of an easter message so i didn't want to cut it in half and have the easter message in the middle and then the lord put this on my heart and then i started thinking how well it would go with the palm sunday and then easter coming up so i just trusted me a blessing to you but before we read the word of god let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could lord jesus father we are indeed grateful father for all that you do for us for your blessings your love for watching over protecting us lord just the sheer knowledge lord and faith to believe that god you are always there that you never leave us or forsake us god we've tried you we've proved you we know you to be a man of your word we know you to do what you said you would do god and by faith we believe today that you are here because the promise of your word says that where two or three are gathered in your name you would be there lord in the midst and we're so thankful god for you being here lord for the promise of your word we know that by faith it moves the hand of god lord sometimes we expect things just to be paved so perfectly right and lord just say god we have faith and you know we believe but faith doesn't always make things easy it just makes them possible and we know that god if we believe that it would be possible it might not happen today it might not happen tomorrow it might not be on that beautiful smooth paved road god but lord we know that all things are possible because we believe we believe your word we thank you father today for this place we thank you for these people thank you for those who would be streaming today and pray that you would speak to us from your word once again we rebuke every demonic spirit of hell that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you would get the glory honor and praise for all this that had done here and lord as brother john has already said may what is said and done here today god be pleasing to you and help us to draw closer to you lord in this time that you've given us today father that's our whole motive that's our whole objective lord this is to draw closer to you to learn of you father to you for you to speak to us lord we all need that little boost of faith that little extra encouragement we all have things on our hearts and lives and needs and lord the prayer request is very very many of them lord god but lord we know that you have met them everyone we thank you god for all that you do and done and going to do we commit the remaining part of this service in your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ and to you be all glory honor and praise in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen isaiah 55 begin with verse 1 ho everyone that thirsteth come ye to the waters and ye that hath no money come ye buy and eat ye come buy wine and milk without money and without price wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfyeth not hearken diligently unto me and ee that which is good and let your soul delight in itself and fatness incline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the short mercies of david you could be seated if you'd like brother branham talked about uh and preached a message on without money without price that's kind of just want to make that title today without money without price a lot of times we talk about the financial part of the about money without price we talk about the monetary value of that and the dollars that we have in our pocket or don't have in our pocket or in our bank accounts or uh invested in something or in in in a home or a car or whatever it is you know there's so much more to it than just understanding or the feeling of of the of what we would call the almighty dollar of the money aspect of it yes it is true that is a huge part of it and and the financial part of it the the money part of it because it all belongs to god anyway it's all his he gives it to us or loans it to us or helps us that we would be good stewards of his money but right a lot of this has to do too with with uh the things that we do in our lives and the things that we do uh with our time now look at this because it it isaiah is talking about here now now come uh and that's always been the call that's always been the cry the cry that jesus gave come come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden then i will give you rest see because jesus was the rest so if jesus was the rest he was able to give rest but you had to first come unto him right and that's the thing that he's asking now to come unto him and he's saying here isaiah is saying come all ye now see again that goes back to something the lord had put on my heart i guess when we just started this service today come do something make a move see make a step a lift a hand lift a voice do something i see make a move towards the lord and that's what isaiah is saying come ye amen and come ye to that that is of the lord come ye to those things that are of god come ye to inherit eternal life because it is something that you cannot pay for it's something that is bought without money and without price it is something that is priceless you know saints it's a very good thing that it doesn't cost anything because we couldn't afford it right right amen if if eternal salvation cost anything we could not afford it what it cost is jesus christ his life and because it cost him his life he now can stand and say you come because i've already done it i've already paid the work i've already paid the price now you don't have to pay anything amen it's already been done you come and buy without money and without price but now look at the rest of this part is you see so many times people try to fill their lives with so many other things you know we all know about that little empty room brother graham talked about the door and the door and we know that by that empty room and that compartment that place is in that's in the human heart see and and of course there for those that are make believers unbelievers there's always those places especially make believers there's always those places that they they want to let god into their lives but only so much right they only want god to do so much or only have so much influence over their lives and the rest of it they want to do themselves the rest of it they want to have control over see but that's not the kind of person god is looking for he's looking for someone that when he goes into their home when he goes into the rooms of their heart it's fully open and exposed for any place that he wants to go and every one of us should be that way but there's a thirst that god's put in every human being in every soul there's free will uh which was actually initially what i was going to talk about today but we'll do that in a couple weeks there's that free will there's that place there's that thirsting for god every human inherently is born with the desire to worship that's why brother random talked about and you've known out through history that you go to heather countries in places where people didn't know about jesus or didn't know about the almighty god and they're worshiping plants and they're worshiping idols and they're worshiping the sun and they're worshiping the moon and celestial beings because they don't know but there's something in them to worship there's something in them to want to worship something to to bow down into praise and see everybody's got that everybody that that's out here in this world today they're out enjoying entertainment whatever venue that might be they're they're drinking or they're smoking or they're gambling or they're drugs or whatever it is the righteous living and uh whatever it is that they're trying to fill that thirst they're trying to fill that place yeah because that room is in is in every compartment see or or that compartment is in everyone's life that everybody tries to fill but you notice this second verse that he's talking about that isaiah says you can come and what he's offering what jesus is offering is without money and without price in fact your money is no good to him yeah amen it's no good to him god's not looking for that god is looking for you yes looking for your heart and if you give him your heart that means you give him control over every facet of your life every facet of your life now that belongs to him not just say oh god i want you in my life but just only so much you know i give you 90 i give you even 95 my that's a high number right i'll give you 95 percent lord but god wants a hundred hundred or none amen he wants vessels that he can work through he wants vessels that he can work he wants to be able to get in that compartment of that life now transcending or going beyond the the finances beyond the money beyond the things that you know that that uh that he's talking about here to come without money without price the second verse he said now wherefore do you spend uh do you spend money for that which is not bread why are you spitting for things that of really of no value are really not of things that are life-sustaining things that are needful that we need because there's things that we need of the lord amen and your labor for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and eat that which is good and let your soul delight in the fatness well what's he's talking about he's saying protect be partakers of the things in your life that are edifying not just talking about finances but talking about what do you do with your time right what do you do with your life we have an abundance of of wealth we have an abundance of time it's limited both of them are limited but we have plenty of time that god has given us 24 hours in a day amen 24 hours in a day what do we do with it do we spend it for things that aren't edifying do we spend it for things that that don't benefit do we do it for things that are not life-sustaining and life-giving now god's not saying that yeah to be a monk or you know to be on your knees 24 7 or something like that god wants us to enjoy our lives and be happy but understanding that there's a balance to being able to live our lives pleasing to the lord and being able to enjoy ourselves too amen because god wants us to be happy yes because here he says do we labor for those things which satisfy if not well if you're not satisfied the things that you're laboring it in your life you're going to be unhappy and god wants us happy because the happier we are the more prosperous we are the happier we are the harder we work the more we do the closer we draw to him the more we desire more of him see but if but if we're not happy then all the doldrums come that's why you see so many churches today because without the holy ghost what is the church people have rock concerts and they have clowns and they have juggling acts and they have dancers all over the place and waving flags and blowing whistles and they got to have everything under the sun but the gospel right yeah micah is talking yesterday uh about uh these churches that they're getting prepared for palm sunday and in the easter and they had these big rock concerts going on and they had these huge lighted stages and they have big huge screens all over the place and and all the lighting effects and everything and the rock and roll music going on which of course they don't call it rock and roll i do that's i call things the way i see them it's rock and roll music and all going on and they have all these performances and everything and one person said is you know is that really of christ and and another's like well we'll do anything to win a soul i said will you show me in this bible that that's how you win a soul yeah i'll be the first one there right right that's not how you win a soul to christ right amen you win the soul to christ by the gospel you you witness when uh when philip met the eunuch on the road he didn't try to entertain him he expounded to him the word of god and that day that man said there's water what does kennedy praise the lord let's go get baptized and all of a sudden philip's gone right he's there for that time baptized the unit the unit comes to christ and phil is gone and transported from one place to another right that's the gospel amen the gospel gospel's not in entertainment right people are just giving others to a church or to a religion or to an organization they're not getting the christ correct you get them to christ with the gospel not with entertainment so the point then it becomes what is it that we're doing what what are we doing with our time what are we doing with our money what are we doing that's edifying that that is uh that is praising the lord are we happy in those things amen now there's happiness that the world thinks they have and all these things that they do out there they think that makes them happy when their self their flesh maybe sure they might have moments of happiness happiness outside of god is non-profitable happiness must be in the lord our glory our happiness must be in the lord or it's not profitable that's right the flesh will die the flesh will corrode so if the happiness is nothing but superficial then it doesn't amount to anything it doesn't profit that's why isaiah is saying here what is it profit if you're doing this over here and you're doing that over there what is it profiting i i known and and i'm not being critical of anybody or any church but you know i've known people that you know they just they they want to support missionary work so bad they just send money overseas and and they go to help people at least they hope but i never would send anything that i didn't know was going to the use of the lord jesus and helping get souls to christ i wouldn't do it i had people say well you know you should support so-and-so i said i don't know so-and-so right that's right if it's a brother i trust and they say i've been there i've met him i know what he does and i know this goes to the lord i know whatever you sent him is going to go right straight to the gospel you got my support but just to send something and say well somebody sent you an email or somebody sent you a text or a facebook message or something to say well so and so i'm just that the other brother i don't know you i love you i'll pray for you as a as a brother if you are uh if nothing else a human being i'll pray for you right but unless i know who you are and what's going on i'm not gonna i'm not gonna place finances in there because what i i always intend to do is make sure that what it what it does is it goes to the edifying of of god's people that it goes to praise the lord and it edifies god's people so the point is what god has given us is without money and without price the other point is what we do with our lives with our time with our with our finances incline your ear and come unto me here and your soul shall live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david that plan that god had made for us that brings that unification that brings that joining together god and his people together to bring blessing and to bring help and to bring edification and again sometimes we can't just sit and say god move we need to do some moving ourselves and let god move as god moves on us because see there's a way in this world today there's that we know the bible says there's a way that seemeth right to a man but the end of that way is death and people would say oh i don't see anything wrong with this well but does the bible say there's something wrong with that well i don't know well maybe you should find out because that's the most important thing if god's not pleased with it if it's against god's word i don't care if you think it's right or not right amen shun the very appearance of evil is what the bible says even matisse talked about that scripture that says if the righteous scarcely be saved right word of the sin and the ungodly appear right amen my friend so where is it that that puts us at this time because see we don't belong to ourselves we have free will absolutely every one of us god desired and i don't want to get into that part of the message especially as short as our time is here but we all are born with free will and we all have the decision we all have choice we all have a way that we can decide that we want to live and the things that we want to do right we all have that and god wants it that way god doesn't want your forced worship he wants your free will worship all right he doesn't want your forced tithes he wants your free will offering right he doesn't want you to be forced to raise your hand and to praise god he doesn't want you to be forced to live for him or to do what's right he wants you to do it because you love him and because you want to do it that's right free will but now the truth is if we belong to him we belong to him holy truly because we've been bought with a prize we don't belong to ourselves we belong to him we're just the sheep in the shepherd's pasture let him lead and guide us the way he'd have us to go and i believe truly that those that are of god and those that have the holy ghost they desire to be led of god they want god to lead them they want god to take control over their lives and show them help me lord where where do i how do i do this and what is this and it it's it's becoming an all-consuming theme to me i'll just be perfectly honest it's become even if i'm not physically doing something about it it's on my mind all the time i dream about it hallelujah finding the next church that we're supposed to be in right it's becoming just all consuming to me i'll just be honest makes me understand why the churches have deacons and trustees and let them take care of that but that's okay i don't mind what god gives what god does what uh the purpose of god uh we're working on it and god's taking care of it right i think the lord's just telling me to be patient and i will be honest with you i think not that i would ever lie to you but the i don't know why we say that expression i'll be honest with you well does that mean you've been lying to me this whole time now you're going to be honest you know i hear people say that all the time i shouldn't say that but to give you my thought or what the lord spoke to me the other day i said lord why is this taking so long why why is this like this and i and i felt in my spirit that the lord said so that we we to make sure that we appreciate the place when god gives us what we're supposed to have and where we're supposed to have it when we're supposed to have it that we will truly appreciate the place that god give us not that we don't appreciate this because we do but friend the little taste of having our own place where we were before and knowing that we're going to be a place that god's going to provide that we're going to be there and settle and have our place and no other devils no other spirits no other people coming and doing whatever it's going to be ours friend and i thought lord then that's okay because i i want us to be appreciative of what you've provided for us and thankful for what you give us amen right give us this and i'm thankful for that but what he's going to do and i'm looking forward to that yes so the other thing is lord help my patients i'm just i'm trying my best to be patient with it but it is becoming all-consuming to me [Music] placing my time and efforts towards something to try to help god's people and to edify and to worship him and to glorify him and if we go home before we ever find a place even better amen amen it'll definitely be that tabernacle there on the other side that obviously could no dollar could buy right amen no amount of money could buy where we're going amen but look at this a couple of scriptures just to reiterate that uh first corinthians chapter six chapter six and chapter seven first corinthians chapter 6 and chapter 7 verse 19 chapter 6 verse 19 what know you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost think about that now we all know that you know we know how these things can slip too but recognizing your body's the temple of the holy ghost it's the place that houses almighty god the holy spirit which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own if we're christians if we're born again holy ghost filled christians we are not our own we still have our free will but our decisions and our pleasures are for the lord and him alone amen you are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorified god in your body and in your spirit which are gods so we know now in the believer because look at this look at this breakdown that paul gives to the corinthian church first of all he says know you not that you are the temple of the holy ghost that means god has taken resident in your soul then he goes beyond the soul and he says for you are bought with a price therefore glorify god now you're you're you're housing god in your soul the holy spirit in your soul now he says now therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit that takes care of the entire trial and being soul body spirit body spirit soul that takes care of every facet of your being you've been purchased and you belong to god now glorify god in your body and in your spirit in your seed taste phil smell here in your imagination constitution reason memory every bit of it right glorify him because you've been bought you belong to him we do that then god leads us guides us and shows us and helps us and he's always with us it's good to have that confidence and faith if anybody's ever witnessed any time that god's ever failed i'd like him to come forward because he doesn't but see that's what gives us that confidence that's what gives us the the daily i don't know i actually especially in today's world i don't know how people can do it i guess that's why they they cling so hard to their their political party or they cling so hard to their social groups or they they cling so hard to their sports or their money or their homes or their jobs they clean so hard people become workaholics because they don't have god right they become uh uh obsessed people over houses and lands and and how much more dollars they can make because they don't have god yeah if you have god then that's glorifying the lord god provides absolutely god provides never his seed been forsaken or begging bread right the righteous never forsaken the seed baking bread because god always takes care takes care of his own he blesses us but people that don't have that see the people don't have that then then their body spirits they're all working on everything else i i don't know how people can go through life like that because every morning i wake up i know god is with me i know that no matter what happens in that day god's gonna take care of me god's gonna take care of my family my church that's why i pray for you every day and lift you before the lord because i know god is there and i know god's going to take care of it could you imagine waking up in the morning and and not having that right i mean i i just can't it's been over 30 years i can't even begin to fathom what it's like to wake up in the morning and not have that in my heart in my spirit to know that jesus christ god almighty's with me and walking and is going to be with me that day regardless no matter what the sky might fall chicken little might get it right skyline fall but it don't matter because god's still going to take care of it yes amen god's still going to take care of me god's going to take care of my own amen so blessed just so blessed i don't know how people do it but they do it but see we are bought with the price you are not your own you're bought you become the tabernacle you become the inhabitants of jesus christ and now glorify god in your body and your spirit now seventh chapter 22nd verse for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lord's free man likewise also he that is called being free is christ's servant you understand so being the servant of god not belonging to yourself belonging to him makes you a free man makes you a free person you're not bound to anything in the world out here so many people who think they have liberty are bound to the things that they worship and bound to the things that motivate them like money and things like that they're bound to those things you're bound to jesus christ that makes you free amen yeah and when and whom jesus has set free is free indeed amen come unto me all you that labor and heavy laden i'll give you rest i'll give you less rest set you free from the burdens of the world ye are bought with a price amen be not ye the servants of men brethren let every man wherein he is called therein abide with god abide in that calling that god has called you because god you belong to him whatever his desire is for your life that's what you do wherever god desires you to go that's where you go john told you that story brother branham talked about that time he went to chicago i think matt and jose maybe it set up some services four five six services a row whatever it was i forgot and um like the second or third night uh brother branham's preaching is done has the altar call and and prayer line whatever it was there and and uh one lady gave her heart to the lord and brother brandon went to him afterwards said we can shut the meeting down now the one person god sent me for just came in the one person in the city of chicago i don't know how many people it was in chicago at that time but it had to be millions yeah i know there's multi millions today there had to be millions even back then one person in the city of chicago the one person god sent me here for just came in now obviously this could very well and probably were more people in chicago it just wasn't their time it just wasn't god it wasn't their way for god to bring them in at that time amen so i'm not saying there was only one person ever come out of chicago that's not what he's saying that's not what i'm saying but at that time for those meetings that one person god see him therefore came in he said we shut the meetings down now god brought the first knowledge that he wanted in here she they just came in you shut them down i i think they probably still had the meetings if i could remember right but the one person said there not that other people weren't helped or blessed or whatever but that's that's that's the way god works amen the great picture that god sees he sees it all from the beginning and that that picture has to play itself out sometimes a person you come to the lord jesus there might be one one singular purpose that god has i mean life-altering eternally effective point that god wants you to make in your life right and the rest of your life is you just live it the best you can live it for god be a good humble godly person christian raise your children if you have some or spouse or whatever it is but rest your life you just live for the lord yeah but that one thing maybe the reason that god brought you forth right amen right the eternal purposes of god can just cannot be measured with human understanding right they they can't be comprehended with human understanding it just you just it just doesn't to us it just doesn't make sense well brother brown there's so many more painters thousands of people coming every night they're receiving the gospel sorry but the one person god sent me here for amen it just can't be fathomed it can't be understood but there might be that one thing god put you here for you remember brother brown uh brother green tells us about how brother brown told him that god brought his dad from over here his mom from over here and he and and and he bred the two together to breed him right to bring perry green forth amen i i just really i i mean i don't know i look at my children i love my family so much i look at my children i think god sent me 2 000 miles from north carolina to come meet my wife yeah 40th year this year is our 40th year i met her september 40 years ago in high school at that time i told you i like your voice thank you that was it but that was the beginning it was just the beginning 40 years ago but who knows why god does what he does if he sends somebody from way over here and this enough from over here bring them together just to breed you what is the point that god's doing he's taking that picture that he saw and he's bringing it to pass every bit of it i just want to be a part of it i'm bought with a price i don't belong to myself help me lord just to do the part that you have me to do lord just take my step and move forward and and as you move in our lives lord just continue to move in our lives now let's look at this one scripture i want to get to i told you in acts chapter 3. before time gets away from me here now acts chapter three we'll just start with verse one i refer to this story i guess frequently i enjoy it i think it's uh i think it's a actual epitome of christian life and how we should be as christians today so many times we we think about these things and we think well that was brother branham or that was jesus or that was in the bible or this was that time or this was this time no doubt things do change with dispensations of time but the one thing that doesn't change the constant is jesus christ and the fact that he doesn't change and if he's in you then the things he does in you he did in the bible right the things he did in the bible he does in you that doesn't change regardless of time seasons people whoever they are they die raise up die raise up doesn't matter see coach god's still the same he'll just use you if you don't do it he raised somebody tomorrow that will do it just it just keeps going on that's that's how god does it so if there's if there's that point that god made for us to do to live our lives that that place where god wants us to be see it it is these biblical examples that god give us acts chapter 3 now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man laying from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple aston alms and peter fasting his eyes upon him with john said look on us oh boy you said that today people wouldn't people would crucify you look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them now he received all right then peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have i give thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk now peter declares to them i have no silver and gold right now i can't declare that too well i could declare i don't have any silver or gold i got this fake stuff that the government now says is good if you spend to a store or something right it's just it's not backed by anything it's just the trust of a failed government in our country but anyway um whoever's watching that um just just a piece of paper whatever it is today are some coins that uh really are almost pretty close to useless nowadays but anyway uh used to be silver and gold so i guess we could still say silver and gold have i not but the point that he's saying is not necessarily that he didn't have sustaining value of life what he's saying is what i have is something far greater than what your money can buy right i can give you an almond you can eat for a day but what god gives you is going to raise you up to change your life forever not just for a day not just for a season what i have i give to you peter couldn't give it if he didn't have it right you can't give it if you don't have it but if you have it friends you can give it we ask prayer for people we have prayer requests in our service every service basically every service we have prayer requests you have things in your heart you have things that in your sister's group that you chat back and forth or text back and forth and prayer requests and needs and things we have a a facebook group page for our church and things get posted on there and those needs come up and we have things that come in our lives and our friends and our family and those are things that we that we look to to say oh god move well peter didn't look to god and say god moved peter looked at the man and said i have it i'm going to give it to you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth you rise up and walk hallelujah now peter just didn't stand there and wait for him the guy didn't just stand there staring at peter peter reached out to the man and grabbed him by the hand and picked him up amen now today don't do that because he'll just crumble under his feet well then what are we doing right what is the whole point of this exercise just to make just to to put on a show you either believe it or you don't right you have faith you don't you either know you've got it or you know you don't yeah and if you got it you go and then he lifted him up his brother around he said get up off of that cot get up out of that wheelchair move do something so and so brother you go over here help this person out of that chair lift them up look at what the bible says seventh first and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones receive strength now the bible doesn't say anything about receiving strength while he was sitting there it said he received strength when peter grabbed him and pulled him up yeah amen amen when there was an action when there was a move when there was actually flesh put to words or words put to flesh he picked him up and that's when god said okay you really believe we moved on the scene the street came in the man's feet it came in his ankles came in his feet and then he walked into the temple with with peter and john and all the rest of them saw and said he's this the man who has been sitting out there crippled all this time how is it now that he is walking amen what a way to preach the gospel this man you see before you now whole is the man that was setting out baby gnomes the question then becomes what do people want without money without price people ask for healing all the time but why people say i want to be delivered why i i i need to be healed why why do you want to be delivered why do you want to be healed what are you going to do with your life once you can walk now peter didn't say that of course jesus did that to the pool of bethesda man he says you know why but peter didn't say that but the truth is why peter just said what i have i give to you and he grabbed him and pulled him up and as soon as he made that move and as soon as he pulled it that strength came in his legs his ankles feet but why why do people want this people say i want to be healed what are you going to do with yourself once you're healed yes what are you going to do with your life once strength has came back in your ankles if you can walk what are you going to do then yeah you spent your whole life just sitting there begging arms now what are you going to do why do you want to be delivered why do you want to touch from god exactly what are you going to do with the touch from god where are you going to go from here without money without price what is it that we do with ourselves what is it that we do with our time what is it that we do with our finances amen look what brother adam said here he said god said come by eternal life without money without price life to live forever and we turn our backs on it laugh in his face what are we going to do on that day what's it going to be if god gives us things to do gives us money and makes us the richest nation under the heavens then god is going to ask what did we do with it what did we do with it why do we spend our money for things that satisfy not not only to a nation but that'll be to individuals from pennies to millions of dollars will each one be given that's what he said well now he said but now what are we going to do with it god has made us the richest nation on the earth he said well what do we do with it yeah we just pledge another billions of dollars to send to a country that basically ends up in the hands of leaders which basically ends up in the hands of cartels and the people common person still suffering yeah what do we do with it oh we'll just throw up a little money we'll just throw them a little money over here and just throw a little money over there you know we can cheer the whole world's eels if we just give enough money to enough people oh friend if they are so deceived oh let's just take every gun away from everybody that'll solve all the murders you take guns away from innocent people the only ones that'll have them are the crooks that's right that's right people say oh that was only meant for the second amendment is only for a well-armed militia in case we got attacked no that's one reason the biggest reason for it was so this government that we live under doesn't become a tyranny to take over the people the founding fathers wanted a way for the for the common person to be able to defend themselves and to stand up for themselves and to take their rights and to speak their voice that's why anyway take it away but what did they do with it let's just throw money over here let's just throw money over there what's the point without jesus it's all going to hell anyway right that's right without jesus what is to pull you amen what is it going to amount to you can throw as much money to it as you possibly can and what is it going to amount to oh my god praise the lord from pennies to millions of dollars each one of us will give an account when men kill one another let me scroll move down a little bit now then you can see how essential that that new birth is you must be born again it's got to be come to me by without money without price you can't say i don't have the money because you don't need any money it's freely given we americans we're so prone to paying our own way for things and there's nothing wrong with that that's not his point so prone to paying for everything that's our slogan we paid for things because we got money flash our dollar bills and other countries and so forth this poor walk in you see tourists come in all the feathers and fine of course it's not like that anymore it's not like that anymore you know a dollar used to be that what used to be the currency that was that was uh that everybody in the world wanted probably still the most commonly spread currency in the world but it's not to the value that it used to be right for there for a long time the euro and even the canadian dollar was more than the american dollar you just keep rolling them out rolling them out and they're not worth anything anymore they're not so valuable amen that's right you you've i i've got cartons of water sitting in our kitchen but if i was in the middle of the mojave desert i only had one bottle that one bottle is pretty precious it's sitting in my kitchen now and it just sets there it's not so precious it's nice to have i'm glad when i need some water i can go and just get a bottle of water but if you got it in the middle of the desert it's pretty precious if you just keep getting it over and over and over again it doesn't mean anything to people we'll just give money we'll just pay for everything that's the solution people have so we just keep throwing more money at it it'll take care of the problem no it doesn't in fact a lot of times that just makes more problems amen just makes more problems i heard i read the other day i gotta close here but i read the other day that uh some man killed a whole family of people just to take their stimulus checks a measly fourteen hundred dollars per person he killed the whole family just to get their money just to get those few stimulus checks oh my that's crazy it seemed like the guy had a brainstem he just going to bank get a couple hundred a couple hundred thousand or million or something and he was killing a whole family yeah i i'm assuming this story is true kill the whole thing just to get the stimulus checked scary friend but it's but that's just the way it is what do people do with it what do we do i close here what do we do without money without christ i believe we're all christians born again we know we've come to christ we know what god's given us it's free will it's without money it's about christ god gave it we accept it we thank him for it yeah but the daily life that we live and the moves that we make towards the lord jesus those things that we do friend now what do they mean that we take those steps to the lord we come into service here every time we have service there's that time there's a reason now i know some of you came in a little later but that i'm not criticizing that i'm just saying that's why we usually have the doors open a half hour early i i told the man we rid of the place i said let's just have it 10 to 12. that way what we'll start church at 10 30 and and we can have that 30 minutes to come and enter in come and pray read our bibles create an atmosphere create a spirit do something make a move to god whatever it is michael start playing and then we start singing and all of a sudden you know the spirit of god falls you at church because god's there yeah amen brother uh brother johnny green always said we're here to have church he said many times brother green never understood that what do you mean john he's here to have church here no that's that's not the point it's the time of entering in brother green i'm saying why don't we here we're here we're here at church we're having church of course we're having church but johnny green said let's have church time to have church i'm here for church that's what it's about though i believe that's that's exactly his heart and what he means is we're entering in we come and we pray and we seek god and we let that spirit come and take hope and and even more so in this place that we don't know what goes on in this building the rest of the week and we come in and we create an atmosphere we let god move among us and speak to us amen sometimes god is just waiting for us to make that move amen waiting for us to enter in waiting for us to say something to lift a hand to pray or whatever let god then come and then and then god takes it over and it's no more brother zach or micah or any of us it's him it's him he orchestrates the way he wants to be amen and that's and i believe that's the way we all want it to be we all want it to be the way he wants it to be oh then you'll see miracles happen friend that's when you see things done right you see spirits broke and direction and leadership and and healing and help and you see those things happen god break forth the windows of heaven i'm going back to malachi 3 again he says i'll open up the windows of heaven and pour it a blessing that you can't even contain amen remember he said but prove me that's his word praise the lord i'm thankful that he is more than able i i sometimes i say things that i might not be able to completely do like i in my heart want to or or desire to do but god doesn't do that amen amen everything he says every bit of it has purpose meaning and and and brings it to pass amen because he's more than able amen he's more than able praise the lord let's stand if we could today we got the easter sunday coming up next sunday the lord terry's and we're still here we have at easter sunday and what the lord did for us is without money without price amen i believe we should worship him let's turn to psalm 552 let's sing this to him now thank you lord jesus blessed be his holy name hallelujah thank you jesus is [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] is oh glory glory to his name he lives forever hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] blessed [Music] glory to god thank you jesus hallelujah i praise you jesus amen thank you lord thank you lord oh praise the lord you love him saints oh praise god he's been so good to us amen loving with all my heart he's so good wonderful god master savior prince of peace lilia valley amen that and so much more thank you jesus pray something was said to bless and help you today amen the lord willing we'll be back next sunday easter sunday it'd be nice to be had our own place next sunday but uh the lord provides so we're thankful for that today's passover yes first day so thankful that the lord provides amen god's blessed us to see another one you never know maybe the last one i believe it's pretty soon i'd like to offer my home for um if you want to take communion next week i have empty rooms and um and i've got a bazillion chairs amen so um if the offer is there and then we could eat afterwards and do a buffet so it's you know you whatever you'd like to do amen yeah praise the lord thank you sister praise the lord jesus amen i talked about the john yarbrough he called the realtor the other place uh the pastor of the other place supposed to meet with the town of moran tomorrow morning at ten o'clock to see if they get the power turned on because they have to get authorization from the town for tdp to turn the power off the commercial building needs to get the power turned on they can test the air conditioner and do the things to do so it looks like it's going to be a a little while yet before things unfold for them to move out i'm still concentrating thinking about that specific place but all the while i am still looking i'm still praying i'm still searching seeing if there's something i'm missing or someplace the lord's got for us somewhere um and whatever the lord's will is that's that's what i want nice it'd be really nice if we could find a little building and that the owner wanted to carry or something would just buy it uh but we'll just uh we'll take what the lord gives us so as of right now that's where we stand with the other building it looks like it's going to be a few more weeks or so you never know i mean things can happen fast once uh once the others get involved but miranda can't even inspect it until the power's on so and he's got to go get them to approve to get the power turned on the power gets turned on and miranda has to come and inspect it and anyway uh that's a whole nother mega moral i was going to have a meeting actually tomorrow uh with miranda to test to check the place we're supposed to move into to make sure everything's going to be okay for us to move in there because i was hoping to get all these steps done and over with so when they move out we can go right in and not have to worry about anything else to get our certificate of occupancy or anything like that but i'm learning to be patient i hope i think i don't have a choice but to be patient but anyway so we'll just just keep praying for us and whatever the lord's will is that's what we want whatever he wants i thought lord i just i'll just claim this building for us but then the next day i'm like well lord i really just i want what you want for us so not what i think is best but anyway so appreciate your prayers thank you for coming today pray the lord richly bless you amen and appreciate the lord providing this for us so god bless you
