[32:21] your attention today.
[32:24] Amen. And brother Dennis writes out a
[32:26] request for him and his wife Leah. Says,
[32:29] "Please remember my wife Leah in prayer.
[32:31] She's recovering good uh after her
[32:33] surgery, but still has days where she
[32:35] feels pain and discomfort. Also for
[32:38] brother Dennis uh with foot, knee, and
[32:42] back problems, which uh makes things uh
[32:45] makes it hard to get around at times.
[32:48] Thank you. God bless you." Amen. I
[32:50] imagine it does.
[32:52] uh kind of the three components you
[32:54] really need to take a step.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Kind of hard without feet, knees, and
[32:59] back uh to be able to even walk. So
[33:02] thankful to have brother Dennis back
[33:04] with us. Brother Danny, of course, too.
[33:06] Amen. God richly bless you. So thankful
[33:08] that you're able to be with us back with
[33:10] us again today. Amen.
[33:13] Sister uh uh well, I don't remember. My
[33:17] wife told me last night, "Who told you
[33:20] about Sister Dorothy?" Was it Norma?
[33:22] Okay. It's usually Sister Norma. I
[33:24] almost says Sister Norma without
[33:26] verification. So, uh, but it was Sister
[33:29] Norma. Uh, let us know that Sister
[33:31] Dorothy is now on hospice care at home.
[33:34] Uh, her daughter Dee said she is not
[33:37] doing uh, very well at all. She's
[33:40] getting weaker and weaker. So, uh,
[33:42] Sister Dorothy may be going home to be
[33:45] with the Lord here pretty soon. So,
[33:47] Please remember her, the family in
[33:49] prayer if you would. Amen. We don't know
[33:51] what the Lord has in store. This is
[33:52] Sister Dorothy's last few days on this
[33:54] earth. And um she's run a good race.
[33:58] She's fought a good fight. She's kept
[34:00] the faith and Amen. And I believe Sister
[34:02] Dorothy's
[34:03] &gt;&gt; uh ready to go be with the Lord. Amen.
[34:06] So, but please remember her in prayer
[34:08] family if you would.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Uh also got a text from Brother Roger
[34:11] Collins this morning. uh he informed me
[34:14] that his mother died uh passed away this
[34:16] morning. So hate using the word die. A
[34:19] Christian doesn't die. I I just don't
[34:21] when talk about Christians, I don't use
[34:22] the word died.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Uh they passed away. They went from one
[34:26] dimension to another. That's all it is.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Uh and of course, sister uh brother
[34:30] Rogers mother was most definitely a
[34:34] godly sister, Christian in the Lord. Uh
[34:36] but she did pass away. I believe he told
[34:38] me this morning actually. So, please
[34:41] remember, of course, she lives in
[34:42] Georgia, so they're three hours ahead of
[34:44] us, but uh please remember brother
[34:46] Roger,
[34:47] uh his family in prayer, if you would uh
[34:50] the passing of the mother, uh I told
[34:52] brother Roger, of course, we would be
[34:54] praying for them and if there's anything
[34:56] at all that we can do for them, uh to
[34:59] please let us know. So, please remember
[35:00] that in prayer if you would. Uh also,
[35:03] got some finalization on Sister Lydia's
[35:06] memorial service. As I text you
[35:08] yesterday, Sister Religious memorial
[35:10] service will be Saturday morning, uh,
[35:12] the 6 August 16th at 11:00 a.m. Amen. at
[35:16] the Tucson Tabernacle. So hopefully
[35:19] everyone of you can go be there, be a
[35:21] part of that. Sister Lydia's memorial
[35:23] service uh is Saturday the 16th of
[35:28] August at 11:00 a.m. at Tucson Tower. Uh
[35:32] I am very appreciative to brother Dan uh
[35:36] and the brothers there to allow us to
[35:38] use the church tabernacle there.
[35:40] Although the VAS were very much part of
[35:42] the tabernacle for many many years. Uh I
[35:45] got a text from brother Robert Figureroa
[35:48] who remembers sister Lydia back before
[35:50] she was even married. Uh last name
[35:53] Loftton I think he told me. So back in
[35:55] the apostolic days I didn't even know
[35:56] that. I think that's what he told me
[35:59] anyway.
[36:00] Uh, oddly enough, Sister Lydia and and
[36:04] Brother Robert, their uh, children,
[36:08] Brother Robert's son Bobby and Sister
[36:10] Lydia's uh, daughter Jennifer graduated
[36:13] the first year of TLC uh, school that we
[36:17] had uh, at the at at Tucson Tabernacle.
[36:20] The first year of TLC school, they were
[36:22] the two graduates uh, Bobby Figareroa
[36:24] and Jennifer Via. So, uh, but, uh,
[36:27] please remember them in prayer if you
[36:29] would. Uh, the Lord will just bless the
[36:31] family, continue to comfort them and be
[36:33] with them and, uh, all that they're
[36:35] having to do now. So, just please
[36:37] remember them. Uh, I am, as I text
[36:40] yesterday, headed back to Houston. Um,
[36:43] so I appreciate your prayers for that.
[36:47] Not I I will not be, at least for the
[36:50] most part, I will not be working outside
[36:52] this week. So, it will be somewhat
[36:54] better. It's still going to be warm and
[36:56] humid. U but uh at least it won't be so
[36:59] much in the sun. Uh my manager told us
[37:03] yesterday what little we're going to try
[37:05] what little we kind of need to do still
[37:07] outside is going to be done in the
[37:09] morning hours. Uh but I'm not even doing
[37:12] that. I've got stuff I have to do inside
[37:14] the tunnel. So, I won't even be outside.
[37:16] But it'll be hot and humid. But again, I
[37:18] appreciate your prayers for traveling
[37:19] mercies and uh and um and the work week.
[37:23] So, I do appreciate that very much.
[37:25] Anyone else have a request on your part
[37:27] today?
[37:31] &gt;&gt; So, Micah's leaving Wednesday. I
[37:32] mentioned last Sunday. Uh Micah is going
[37:34] on a trip. So, please remember him in
[37:36] prayer. He's leaving Wednesday. He'll be
[37:38] back in two weeks.
[37:40] 21st. So, give or take two weeks. So, he
[37:42] will be gone two Sundays from us. Uh
[37:45] but, uh please remember him. Lord bless
[37:47] his trip and grant traveling mercy
[37:50] sister.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So please remember sister Judy
[37:58] Arnold. We mentioned that a couple
[38:00] Sundays ago. She's gonna have more
[38:02] surgery on her eye. Just remember
[38:05] else
[38:26] brother Dennis take his pray. Lord
[38:29] Jesus, it's an honor once again to be in
[38:32] your house. Yes.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Worship, your house of praise, a place
[38:37] where we can truly hear the reveal word
[38:40] of the hour. Yes.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; A message that you have sent
[38:45] &gt;&gt; to get a bride ready for a rapture.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I was thinking about it as I
[38:50] was driving to church. It's your grace
[38:54] &gt;&gt; that you have called us into your
[38:56] marvelous truth.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. your marvelous life.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes,
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Lord. It's nothing that we deserve or
[39:03] nothing we earn or it's not anything
[39:07] that that gave us the opportunity to
[39:10] receive the truth. It's all by your
[39:13] grace.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; It's all by your election.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; It's all by your love, Lord, that you
[39:21] let us recognize we were a part of you
[39:24] before the foundation.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. And Lord,
[39:28] &gt;&gt; thank you Jesus.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Handwriting is on the wall.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; The enemy knows this message, knows that
[39:35] we're better than any of us, but he
[39:37] cannot live it
[39:38] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; And it takes your Holy Spirit in us to
[39:42] get us to the place where we can live
[39:45] your word, Father. We can obey your
[39:48] word. It'd be automatic, but it comes to
[39:51] praying. We'll just meditate and pray
[39:54] one for another.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. love one another more so as
[39:59] we see that day approaching.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; You'll come to a place where we'll have
[40:04] a burden for the lost
[40:07] &gt;&gt; knowing that you're coming is knocking
[40:10] at the door. Father, we see so many
[40:13] people on the streets that look troubled
[40:18] and worrisome and and maybe having
[40:21] mental problems, but they're your
[40:23] children as well. Father, let us have a
[40:26] burden for the lost. Father,
[40:28] &gt;&gt; oh God. Yes, Jesus.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Let us have a burden. The Lord, this
[40:33] assembly meets one time a week.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[40:37] &gt;&gt; there's many churches in this message
[40:39] that meet three times a week. And Lord,
[40:42] we struggle to obey you in that sense.
[40:46] Lord, you're a rewarder of them that
[40:49] diligently seek you.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, we must put that effort
[40:55] Brother Brown, I just heard him say that
[40:57] we got to fight for every inch of ground
[40:59] that we gain.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Joshua had to fight for every inch of
[41:05] ground that you gave him. But he knew
[41:09] that you were in charge. You were in
[41:11] control and he possessed the gates of
[41:14] the enemy.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[41:16] &gt;&gt; we this morning must possess the gates
[41:19] of the enemy. Amen. recognize when the
[41:22] devil is playing games with us.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Giving us an excuse not to obey your
[41:27] word in any way.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, there are many that are
[41:32] sick.
[41:34] They need a touch from you, Father.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; For thou are a great physician,
[41:40] our high priest that can be touched by
[41:43] the feelings of our infirmities.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; And with this, we are healed. We claim
[41:48] our healing. Our sister Julie having a
[41:51] headache.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[41:52] &gt;&gt; she's here by faith. Father,
[41:55] &gt;&gt; may you reach out and deliver her right
[41:57] now from that headache condition.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; For the prophet said, we don't have to
[42:03] take anything the enemy wants to throw
[42:06] at us.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Greater he that's in us than he that's
[42:09] in.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Jesus.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; I have overcome for you. You said,
[42:14] "Father, and Father, we I claim my
[42:18] healing. Um, oh, Father, I know by faith
[42:22] I'm even here by your grace, Father.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus."
[42:26] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I just want to draw closer
[42:28] like everyone else that's here. I want
[42:30] to draw closer to you.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, God.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; And Father, may you just continue to
[42:36] give me strength to do what I'm called
[42:39] to do. We're here for one purpose. We're
[42:42] not here to do our jobs. We're not here
[42:46] to please our families. We're not here
[42:49] to please our friends. We're here to do
[42:52] your will to be of service for you.
[42:55] Thank you, Jesus.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; You have to be first. You have to be
[42:58] preeminent.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; And Father, my wife who's been um doing
[43:02] good, but she has days that that she has
[43:05] so much discomfort. May you touch her
[43:08] and deliver her from that condition,
[43:10] Father. And Lord, for our loved ones
[43:14] unsaved, not serving you. My wife, she
[43:19] says she's a believer, but Lord, she
[43:22] needs to walk in the light of the truth
[43:24] of your word for this hour. Open up her
[43:27] eyes.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Open up the eyes of our loved ones that
[43:30] are my servant. Amen.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we believe for their
[43:34] salvation. We believe for their
[43:35] deliverance, God. And Lord, all the um
[43:39] requests, I can't remember them all, but
[43:42] you heard them. That's the main thing.
[43:44] You know what each and everyone has need
[43:46] of Father,
[43:48] &gt;&gt; for brother Micah to be traveling for
[43:50] traveling mercy.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; And for everyone else that need to touch
[43:53] all the unspoken prayer requests, may
[43:56] you touch them all. May their cup runth
[43:58] over by the blessings of your Holy
[44:00] Spirit working in their lives. Bless
[44:03] bless our brother as he brings your
[44:05] word. Oh Lord, faith cometh by hearing
[44:09] and hearing of the word of God. We're
[44:11] here to draw closer. We're here to
[44:14] hunger and thirst for your righteousness
[44:17] and we shall be filled and Lord in your
[44:19] name we pray. Name the Lord Jesus
[44:22] Christ. Amen.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You can be
[44:26] seated if you'd like.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Micah has a song
[44:31] for us today.
[44:33] go ahead and sing for us
[44:41] song many times
[44:44] since I won't be out of town for
[44:47] memorial. So that's
[44:52] along
[44:54] [Music]
[45:00] kind of
[45:07] for a country
[45:11] [Music]
[45:13] to which I never
[45:20] been before.
[45:25] No sad goodbyes
[45:32] will there be spoken
[45:37] [Music]
[45:39] and time won't matter
[45:46] anymore.
[45:52] to the land.
[45:57] I'm longing for
[46:00] you.
[46:04] And someday
[46:09] on me I'll stand.
[46:14] [Music]
[46:16] There my hope
[46:21] shall be eternal
[46:28] in you the land
[46:34] you the land.
[46:40] Now I am looking
[46:42] [Music]
[46:45] across the river
[46:52] to where my faith
[46:57] will live inside.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's strips of you
[47:09] [Music]
[47:11] to labor
[47:15] and then I'm going to take
[47:21] my heavenly father.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. to build
[47:28] the land.
[47:33] I'm longing for you.
[47:40] And someday
[47:43] [Music]
[47:45] on thee I will stand.
[47:48] [Music]
[47:51] There my hope
[47:56] shall be
[47:58] eternal
[48:01] [Music]
[48:03] and you love
[48:08] you the land of mercy.
[48:13] [Music]
[48:14] Now we are looking
[48:18] [Music]
[48:20] across that great river
[48:26] to where our faithful
[48:33] inside.
[48:37] We have just a few
[48:43] more days we have to baby.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we're going to take
[48:54] our heavenly flight
[49:00] to build the land.
[49:06] I'm longing for
[49:09] you.
[49:12] And someday
[49:14] [Music]
[49:17] on thee I'll stand
[49:21] [Music]
[49:23] there. My hope
[49:28] shall be eternal
[49:34] in new
[49:37] [Music]
[49:50] I'm longing for you.
[49:56] And someday
[49:58] [Music]
[50:01] on me I'll stay
[50:04] [Music]
[50:07] there. My hope
[50:12] shall be eternal
[50:16] [Music]
[50:18] in you the land
[50:24] you
[50:26] [Music]
[50:30] there my hope
[50:35] shall be eternal. Eternal
[50:41] in beautiful
[50:46] sweet.
[50:48] [Music]
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[51:01] Praise the Lord. Amen. How many's
[51:04] longing for that place? Amen.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Longing for that
[51:09] land, that place of perfect rest. Amen.
[51:13] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[51:17] Anyone have a testimony real quick
[51:19] before we change? Yes,
[51:22] &gt;&gt; my refrigerator went out on Friday and
[51:26] just kind of knowing how hores are going
[51:29] everywhere
[51:33] and came to mind that a couple years ago
[51:36] I found a place called
[51:46] I got a wash.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Still running. So I called them and went
[51:52] down Friday
[51:56] and
[51:57] actually told my daughter
[52:00] I'll be back half an hour
[52:02] cutting it close
[52:06] &gt;&gt; and I bought a refurbish
[52:14] smaller
[52:17] on purpose.
[52:19] I think it has more dense than my bed on
[52:22] the outside inside.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; It's great.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; So, in less than 24 hours, God has
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[52:39] Wonderful. He knows how to do it. Knows
[52:43] where to send us and shows us. Sometimes
[52:46] you just just how things work out the
[52:50] way they do. But you just give all the
[52:52] glory to him. Amen.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just walk in his will
[52:55] and he'll lead you where he wants you to
[52:57] be.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He always takes care of us. Praise
[53:00] the Lord. Anybody else?
[53:03] Amen. If not, we'll just stand to our
[53:05] feet and then go to the scripture back
[53:08] over to Romans chapter 8.
[53:12] Read those few scriptures.
[53:15] Amen. To begin the service today. Romans
[53:17] chapter 8.
[53:21] Praise the Lord. 14-17.
[53:25] We'll begin our reading again. Romans 8
[53:28] 14-17.
[53:31] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Good to see
[53:34] each one. God bless you. Amen.
[53:37] Romans 8:14. Before we read, we just bow
[53:40] our heads for another word of prayer.
[53:42] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Lord, for all
[53:44] that you've done for us, given to us,
[53:46] God. So many testimonies and so many
[53:49] things that we could say, so many so
[53:52] much exaltation, so much praise we could
[53:55] give to you, Lord, for all that you do
[53:58] for us so many times, God.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; As I've said many times, probably many,
[54:02] many times that we don't even recognize
[54:04] it, Lord. But we know it's your hand,
[54:06] God. It's your hand that leads us,
[54:08] guides us. We're just following that
[54:10] truth, Lord. and you just show us that
[54:12] path every step of the way.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray that you take control of
[54:16] the remaining part of this service.
[54:17] Bless the reading of your word now, not
[54:19] return it void, but accomplish that in
[54:21] each one that you' sent it forth for.
[54:23] Bless us, God, and speak through these
[54:25] lips the word you'd have us to hear.
[54:27] Anoint every one of our ears as we
[54:29] receive this word today. May it become a
[54:31] part of us as we live it.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; And Lord, walk out of this place today
[54:34] if it be your will, God. And let this
[54:36] word continue to permeate from our very
[54:39] beings.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. We commit ourselves to you this
[54:41] service now in the name of the Lord
[54:43] Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Romans 8 verse1 14. For as many as are
[54:49] led by the spirit of God, they are the
[54:52] sons of God. For ye have not received
[54:54] the spirit of bondage again to fear, but
[54:57] ye have received the spirit of adoption.
[54:59] Whereby we cry, Abby, Father. The spirit
[55:02] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[55:04] that we are the children of God.
[55:06] children than heirs, heirs of God and
[55:09] joint hes with Christ. If so be that we
[55:11] suffer with him that we may be also
[55:14] glorified together. Amen. You can be
[55:17] seated if you'd like.
[55:19] Amen. And I did not anticipate this to
[55:21] be a very long service, but uh
[55:26] I ended last week u with uh sort of
[55:31] toward the end of this part of the
[55:32] position in Christ, but a little too
[55:35] much to continue on last week. Uh but um
[55:39] uh so we just roll it over into this
[55:41] week is so is uh so the Lord have his
[55:45] way but as I see it uh it shouldn't be a
[55:48] very long service today. I just want to
[55:50] pick up back where we left off last week
[55:52] though in Joshua. So let's go back to
[55:55] the book of Joshua. We were speaking of
[55:57] the parallels some of the parallels uh
[56:00] between Joshua and Ephesians and the
[56:03] positionally placing. Now, this is
[56:05] adoption part 23, position in Christ
[56:09] part seven. So, this positioning uh that
[56:12] we're going to finish up today. Uh this
[56:14] positioning is what Joshua did. That was
[56:17] his commission that God gave him of his
[56:19] commission uh for the children of
[56:21] Israel.
[56:23] We also find out in Ephesians where that
[56:26] book by the Holy Ghost positionally
[56:29] places the bride, Amen, in the body of
[56:32] Christ. We already know you're part of
[56:34] the body of Christ. Israel didn't have
[56:36] to be placed as Israel. They were
[56:37] already Israel. They were already God's
[56:39] chosen people. Uh we were already God's
[56:42] children. We were already a part of the
[56:44] body of Christ. We were already the
[56:46] bride of Jesus Christ. God didn't have
[56:47] to place us. It it's not a matter of
[56:50] being a part of God's body. It's what
[56:53] part of that body we play. The position
[56:56] that the Holy Spirit places us in. Amen.
[56:59] So that's the finalization of what we
[57:02] want to talk about here in the
[57:03] paralleling of Joshua and Ephesians. So
[57:06] let's go back to Joshua chapter 1. We'll
[57:09] just read a few verses here. And then
[57:12] there's another particular point as I
[57:13] was reading it this morning that the
[57:15] Lord pointed out to me that I want to
[57:17] make note of that has that goes along
[57:20] with something I had not seen before but
[57:22] kind of goes along with what we had
[57:23] spoke on two or three weeks ago. Amen.
[57:26] Now Joshua 1:1. Now after the death of
[57:29] Moses, the servant of the Lord, it came
[57:30] to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua
[57:33] the son of Nun. Moses ministered,
[57:35] saying, Moses, my servant, is dead. Now
[57:39] therefore, rise, go over this Jordan,
[57:41] thou and all this people unto the land
[57:44] which I give to them, even to the
[57:47] children of Israel, to that land that he
[57:49] was to divide out. Now, God gave the
[57:51] land, but it was Joshua's commission to
[57:54] divide out that land. Right.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; So, we come to a time where this great
[58:00] man, Moses, I mean, that's probably not
[58:02] a very good adjective to describe Moses.
[58:05] He was uh he was God's man that was uh
[58:09] one of the most transformable figures
[58:12] ever in history of humanity. Uh but
[58:15] Moses, this great man, reached a place
[58:17] where he come to his end. Amen. And
[58:21] Moses did the great job with what God
[58:23] gave him because Moses represented the
[58:25] law. We know Moses represented the law.
[58:28] Uh which in our case as far as we uh in
[58:33] Christianity is concerned would be
[58:34] considered uh the justification and
[58:37] sanctification part of that law to be
[58:40] justified and sanctified but not put
[58:43] into use yet. And remember we talked
[58:44] about of course that's where a lot of
[58:47] people end up is between justification
[58:50] and filled with the Holy Ghost. Same
[58:51] place that Judas Escariot found himself
[58:54] when we know in the scripture he was
[58:56] justified by what Jesus said in the word
[58:59] and Jesus then would with him standing
[59:01] there said sanctify them by thy word.
[59:03] Thy word is truth. So we know that he
[59:05] was justified and sanctified but he
[59:07] killed himself before he could go on to
[59:09] the upper room to receive the Holy
[59:11] Ghost. A lot of people end up in this
[59:12] place in this transition period. A lot
[59:16] of people in this message ended up in
[59:18] that transition period. Uh a lot of
[59:21] people with John the Baptist ended up in
[59:23] that transitional period where when John
[59:26] come up, John the Baptist said, "I must
[59:29] decrease that he increase." Amen. It's
[59:33] time for me to go away. See, it was
[59:36] Moses time to go away. Praise the Lord.
[59:39] and all that he did and the greatness of
[59:42] his uh uh uh placement on earth and all
[59:45] he did. It comes a time when it's his
[59:47] time to go away. It was John the Baptist
[59:50] time when when it come that time for
[59:52] John to go away. And John spoke of it
[59:54] specifically and said I must go away.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; John himself said that I I must decrease
[1:00:01] so that he who Jesus Christ that was
[1:00:04] standing there should increase. Amen. So
[1:00:07] my ministry is decreasing. Amen. Which
[1:00:10] was uh which was a representation again
[1:00:13] of the law. But then Jesus came forth
[1:00:16] and brought forth grace.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; The law Moses had to go away so grace
[1:00:21] could be brought the grace dispensation
[1:00:23] and uh grace placement into uh that land
[1:00:27] was to come forth with Joshua. Amen. We
[1:00:30] know the uh but but we also know that a
[1:00:33] lot of people continued to hold Moses up
[1:00:36] in that standard and did not recognize
[1:00:39] Joshua in the position that God exalted
[1:00:41] him to. Amen. It's few not as many of
[1:00:44] course like it was Moses. Moses had a
[1:00:46] greater battle with those people uh
[1:00:48] especially Dayan and Kora. But uh Joshua
[1:00:52] didn't have to deal with that as much
[1:00:54] but he still had those people that were
[1:00:56] the Moses followers. Amen. John the
[1:00:58] Baptist had the same thing when when
[1:01:02] Jesus when John was in was in prison and
[1:01:06] Jesus ministry had rose to its
[1:01:08] prominence to the place that it was at
[1:01:10] the time. John even sent as the Bible
[1:01:13] said some of his disciples.
[1:01:17] Amen. Even though John said I must
[1:01:19] decrease and he increase. Even though he
[1:01:22] was in jail and Jesus ministry was the
[1:01:24] the prominent thing that was going forth
[1:01:26] at that time. John the Baptist still had
[1:01:29] disciples,
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist still had people even
[1:01:34] though John himself said, "Follow ye
[1:01:37] him." Pointing to Jesus Christ, people
[1:01:40] still follow John.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes it's just human nature.
[1:01:45] Sometimes it's just a fulfillment of a
[1:01:47] position a person is supposed to play.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I more so feel that last
[1:01:54] part is more accurate than the first
[1:01:55] part. uh that we all have a part to
[1:01:58] play. We all have Hitler had a part to
[1:02:00] play. Brother Ram said that we all have
[1:02:02] a part to play and they had their part
[1:02:04] to play. So John the Baptist sent his
[1:02:06] disciples, the Bible said his disciples
[1:02:10] to go ask Jesus,
[1:02:12] the one they should be following, the
[1:02:15] one that John the Baptist said to
[1:02:17] follow. So if you believe John the
[1:02:19] Baptist, why are you still his disciple
[1:02:22] when he himself told you to follow him?
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he still had disciples,
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses still had disciples. John
[1:02:31] the Baptist still had disciples. Same
[1:02:33] thing happened today. Same. Amen.
[1:02:35] There's a lot of people that all this
[1:02:37] message about is brother Brandham.
[1:02:39] That's all this is about is brother
[1:02:41] Brandham. And they're brother Brandham
[1:02:43] disciples. Even though brother Brandham
[1:02:45] himself said follow him.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham did the same thing John
[1:02:51] the Baptist did and said follow ye him.
[1:02:54] I must decrease. That's his time to
[1:02:56] increase. It's my time to go away. And
[1:02:59] brother Random did go away. But brother
[1:03:01] Vanom still today has disciples.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; I'm a disciple of Jesus Christ myself
[1:03:09] because the the man that I believed in
[1:03:11] this message told me to. That was his
[1:03:15] advancement. That was his notice. That
[1:03:17] was his advice. Follow him. So we look
[1:03:20] to Christ now and recognize that this
[1:03:23] message isn't about brother Brandham.
[1:03:25] This message is about Jesus Christ.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; He just used that man to bring it to us.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I'm thankful for
[1:03:34] that. And God bless. I I can't wait to
[1:03:37] one day be able to meet Brother Brandham
[1:03:40] and shake his hand. Amen. and thank him
[1:03:43] for every fiber that I could muster my
[1:03:46] being to thank him for the sacrifice
[1:03:49] that he made to bring this message to us
[1:03:52] and obey the Lord and all that he did.
[1:03:54] But brother Bradom has gone away. Amen.
[1:03:58] John the Baptist was gone away. Moses
[1:04:00] was gone away. Now, as Moses went away,
[1:04:03] God began to speak to someone else,
[1:04:06] Joshua. As John the Baptist went away,
[1:04:09] it was Jesus time. When Jesus went away,
[1:04:12] of course, in the upper room, he
[1:04:14] anointed the disciples, filled them with
[1:04:15] the Holy Spirit, and away we go.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. But now we're at the end.
[1:04:21] We're we're not at a time. Look, saints,
[1:04:25] we're not at a time in history of a
[1:04:28] continuence,
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; We're at a time of an end.
[1:04:33] Th this whole thing is almost over.
[1:04:36] Amen. We're not looking for another
[1:04:38] prophet.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for a continuation.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; We're looking to get into the position
[1:04:43] and placement where this bride is ready
[1:04:45] to go home in a rapture.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; We're ready for an end, not a
[1:04:50] continuence. They had a continuence.
[1:04:54] Thus, God chose Joshua to continue on to
[1:04:58] lead them over Jordan and to take them
[1:05:00] up to Jericho and to take them into the
[1:05:03] promised land and divide that promised
[1:05:05] land up to the children of Israel that
[1:05:07] God had already given them.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. God had given them, promised it to
[1:05:13] them. What is the promise that we have
[1:05:15] today? What did God promise us? I may be
[1:05:19] getting ahead of myself a little bit,
[1:05:21] but what did God promise us?
[1:05:24] We'll read it. He promised us the Holy
[1:05:27] Ghost.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham went away. Why?
[1:05:31] He had to decrease so that Christ
[1:05:34] increase. Our eyes aren't on a man. Only
[1:05:37] that man, Jesus Christ. Our eyes on
[1:05:39] brother Brandham. But a lot of people
[1:05:40] still are. There's several people's
[1:05:43] that's that's all there. I told you
[1:05:45] before. I mean remember years ago when
[1:05:47] me and my wife started really serving
[1:05:49] the Lord and got filled with the Holy
[1:05:50] Ghost and there were people even around
[1:05:53] probably more so then I don't there
[1:05:55] probably are now I don't know as many of
[1:05:56] them maybe now but I mean one of her
[1:06:00] comments was oh if brother Brandham were
[1:06:02] only still here
[1:06:04] and I've and I've heard that as recently
[1:06:07] as a few years ago from people if
[1:06:09] brother Brandham were only still here he
[1:06:11] would be 120 Honey,
[1:06:18] if he were here, he might be able to
[1:06:20] breathe. Uh, but the point is,
[1:06:25] the God that was in, Brother Brandham is
[1:06:27] is here.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; The God that was with brother Brandham
[1:06:29] is here. The God that led Brother
[1:06:31] Brandham is here. The God that spoke
[1:06:32] through Brother Brandham is here. The
[1:06:33] God that healed those people that
[1:06:35] Brother Brandham prayed for is still
[1:06:36] here. He's still the same God now. We
[1:06:39] didn't worship and serve William
[1:06:41] Brandham. to worship and serve Jesus
[1:06:43] Christ.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's our savior.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; It's not brother Brandham. Jesus Christ
[1:06:48] is my savior. Jesus Christ is my God, my
[1:06:51] lord, my savior.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I will bow down one day next
[1:06:56] to William Brandom and worship our
[1:06:58] savior.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Because he's got the same
[1:07:01] savior I do.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; But he had to go away. Now, the promise
[1:07:05] that God had given the children of
[1:07:07] Israel was this land that was their
[1:07:10] inheritance. God had given them an
[1:07:12] inheritance. Keep a lot of these key
[1:07:14] words I'm talking about in mind as we go
[1:07:17] over into Ephesians in a minute. God
[1:07:19] gave this to them as an inheritance and
[1:07:22] said, "My servant Moses, Moses, my
[1:07:24] servant, is dead. Now therefore, rise go
[1:07:27] over this Jordan.
[1:07:29] Thou and all this people into the land
[1:07:31] which I do give them, even to the
[1:07:33] children of Israel.
[1:07:35] Every place that the soul of your feet
[1:07:37] shall tread upon, thou have I given unto
[1:07:40] you, as I said unto Moses, from the
[1:07:43] wilderness to this Lebanon, even unto
[1:07:45] the great river, the river Euphrates,
[1:07:47] all the land of the Hittites, and unto
[1:07:48] the great sea, towards the going down of
[1:07:50] the sun, shall be your coast. There
[1:07:53] shall not any man be able to stand
[1:07:55] before thee all the days of thy life. As
[1:07:57] I was with Moses, so will I be with
[1:07:59] thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake
[1:08:02] thee.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:08:05] Amen. Think about a beautiful promise.
[1:08:08] Look what he says now. Be strong and of
[1:08:13] a and of a good courage. For unto this
[1:08:16] people shalt thou divide for an
[1:08:18] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[1:08:20] their fathers to give them. Only be thou
[1:08:24] strong and very courageous that thou
[1:08:28] mayest observe to do according to all
[1:08:30] the law which Moses my servant commanded
[1:08:32] thee. Remember Moses representation of
[1:08:35] the law. Amen.
[1:08:37] Command thee, turn not from it to the
[1:08:39] right hand or to the left, that thou
[1:08:41] mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest.
[1:08:43] So even though Joshua brought in the
[1:08:45] placement, even though he was a
[1:08:47] representation of the Holy Ghost, even
[1:08:49] though he was to uh uh represented grace
[1:08:53] and their placement, he still was to
[1:08:55] follow the word.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. A lot of people want to take the
[1:08:59] grace that and separate the grace of God
[1:09:03] versus the judge of the New Testament
[1:09:05] versus the judgment God of the Old
[1:09:07] Testament. Same God.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; God did not change from the Old
[1:09:11] Testament to the New Testament. He's the
[1:09:13] same God.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just because grace was entered in
[1:09:17] to this uh in this place, this Joshua
[1:09:20] representing grace, the Holy Ghost, just
[1:09:22] because it was introduced didn't change
[1:09:24] the word and it didn't change God's
[1:09:28] desire for us to follow that word as he
[1:09:31] told as he told Joshua. Joshua is
[1:09:34] entering in to this new era. But God
[1:09:37] tells him, "Don't you dare turn the the
[1:09:39] word that I gave Moses, don't you dare
[1:09:42] turn to the right hand, to the left hand
[1:09:44] from it."
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That thou mayest prosper.
[1:09:48] Praise God. Whethersoever thou goest, a
[1:09:50] lot of people wonder why they don't
[1:09:52] prosper. This book of the law
[1:09:56] shall not depart out of thy mouth, but
[1:09:57] thou shalt meditate therein day and
[1:09:59] night, that thou mayest observe to do
[1:10:01] according to all that is written
[1:10:03] therein. For then uh for then thou shalt
[1:10:06] make thy way prosperous, and then thou
[1:10:08] shalt have good success. Have not I
[1:10:10] commanded thee what? Be strong and of a
[1:10:14] good courage. Be not afraid, neither be
[1:10:17] thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is
[1:10:19] with him whethersoever thou goest. Be
[1:10:21] strong
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; and of a good courage. What did we talk
[1:10:24] about the other day a couple weeks ago
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; that brother Ram talked about when he
[1:10:28] got that sword in his hand that the
[1:10:30] spirit come and spoke to him and said
[1:10:32] that's the sword of the king. But it
[1:10:33] takes the hand of strong faith, strong
[1:10:38] faith to drive it to the heart of the
[1:10:40] enemy.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is he telling Joshua? Be
[1:10:43] strong and of good courage. Three times.
[1:10:47] In how many? In four verses, five
[1:10:49] verses. Three times he tells him, be
[1:10:51] strong and of a good courage. Be
[1:10:53] faithful. Stay. Hold strong to that
[1:10:56] faith, to that conviction, to that
[1:10:58] truth, to that word that you know is
[1:11:00] right. Hold strong to it. Be strong in
[1:11:03] it. Take the faith. Take the faith with
[1:11:05] the sword of the word and drive it to
[1:11:07] the heart of the enemy.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; I am with you.
[1:11:11] Amen. I am with you. Go. He He told
[1:11:14] Joshua, he tells us today, I am with
[1:11:17] you.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; You take that sword, that word to the
[1:11:20] heart of the enemy with faith. Be strong
[1:11:23] of good courage. Because remember, this
[1:11:27] promised land was their inheritance. But
[1:11:30] they still had to fight for it. They
[1:11:32] still had to fight to hold it. They
[1:11:34] still had discouragement. There was
[1:11:36] still death there. They still had uh uh
[1:11:40] life that they had to live and and and
[1:11:43] all that they had the discouragements
[1:11:44] and things all that they had to go
[1:11:46] through. But look, it was a place of
[1:11:48] peace because God would give it to them.
[1:11:50] Amen. They used to have a uh back when I
[1:11:55] was a kid, they used to I don't know if
[1:11:57] they do it anymore, but they used to
[1:11:58] have what they called a mortgage
[1:11:59] burning. You guys ever heard of that or
[1:12:01] been to a mortgage burning? When a
[1:12:03] person or family or
[1:12:06] couple paid off their house, once the
[1:12:09] house got fully paid off, the bank would
[1:12:12] send them their mortgage in the mail.
[1:12:14] Amen. And they would take that mortgage
[1:12:16] to a fire pit and burn it to show as a
[1:12:20] signification, this is our house now.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; The bank has no lean on this.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it was a sign of comfort. It
[1:12:28] was a sign of It was It was like a sign
[1:12:30] of peace that had come over. Amen. I own
[1:12:33] this now. This belongs to me. Of course,
[1:12:35] now if the government wants to take it,
[1:12:36] they'll take it just like that and
[1:12:38] there's nothing you can do about it. But
[1:12:40] anyway, uh because that's this world.
[1:12:42] But it belonged to them. See, and that's
[1:12:45] just said that the the children of
[1:12:46] Israel had that same peace that they had
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; that it belonged to them. It was their
[1:12:51] placement. It was their inheritance.
[1:12:53] It's where they were supposed to be.
[1:12:56] What greater peace is there, saints,
[1:12:58] than being in a position and place where
[1:13:01] you know you belong?
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; I mean, there is none greater. I I've
[1:13:05] wrestled times with with things and
[1:13:09] places and and things I've done and
[1:13:12] where I knew I didn't belong and maybe
[1:13:15] and just, you know, to myself, I'm like,
[1:13:17] this is just temporary. It's a stop gap.
[1:13:20] This is not going to last long. Whatever
[1:13:22] that just to keep that. But there was no
[1:13:24] peace there. There was no comfort. It
[1:13:26] was just all it was a constant struggle.
[1:13:30] Amen. But there was peace in it. Amen.
[1:13:33] Even though you know that there's
[1:13:35] something that's that you go through in
[1:13:38] life, see as they did fighting and
[1:13:40] struggling and they had to live in it.
[1:13:42] That was their promised land.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we we don't couple our
[1:13:48] promised land with heaven. Our
[1:13:51] scriptural promised land is in heaven.
[1:13:54] Our scriptural canaan is the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Our promised land is in the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:01] And in the Holy Ghost, we have peace.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Because we know we belong. We know this
[1:14:07] is where we're supposed to be. We know
[1:14:09] that this is what God has called and
[1:14:11] mandated and predestined for us. So, we
[1:14:14] know that where we're supposed to be.
[1:14:16] So, there's peace. But look, saints,
[1:14:18] every morning you wake up, every night
[1:14:20] that you sleep, every day that you live,
[1:14:23] you're in a constant fight and battle
[1:14:24] with the enemy.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; To fight for every inch of ground. God
[1:14:29] told Joshua, "Wherever the souls of your
[1:14:31] feet are, but you got to fight every
[1:14:33] inch to get that soul on that ground."
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you got to have a strong hand
[1:14:40] of faith.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. to take this word to the heart of
[1:14:43] the enemy and realize and know that God
[1:14:46] said, "I will be with you. I will never
[1:14:49] leave you. I will never forsake you.
[1:14:51] Whereversoever thou goest, I am with
[1:14:54] you."
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God. What what greater confidence
[1:14:57] can we have than to stand in faith and
[1:15:00] realize that God is with us?
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; That's why we use the word. The word is
[1:15:06] God. And we take our strong hand of
[1:15:08] faith and take that work to the heart of
[1:15:09] the enemy. That puts us in our position.
[1:15:13] Let's go over to Ephesians now.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Is that puts us in our position, our
[1:15:18] place where we're supposed to be
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; where there's peace, where there's
[1:15:22] comfort. You know, we have struggles and
[1:15:24] battles and things that we fight all the
[1:15:26] time. The devil, every inch we fight
[1:15:28] for, but there's a peace in it.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; There's a comfort in it. There's a
[1:15:34] settlement to know that you're where you
[1:15:36] belong. You're where you're supposed to
[1:15:39] be.
[1:15:40] You're doing what you're supposed to do.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; You're you're you're what you are what
[1:15:45] God has called you to be. Oh, there's
[1:15:47] nothing greater in life. Amen. And
[1:15:50] again, I will say again, I think that's
[1:15:52] one of the greatest struggles humanity
[1:15:54] has today.
[1:15:56] Because they don't have that.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Most people, I dare to say, most people
[1:16:01] in this world today do not have that.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; They don't know where they belong. They
[1:16:06] don't know who they are. They don't know
[1:16:08] peace. They don't know comfort. Not not
[1:16:10] the comforts of having money and a nice
[1:16:13] bed to sleep in, but I mean the comfort
[1:16:15] of your spirit
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; to realize that you are where you're
[1:16:18] supposed to be.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; You are doing what you're supposed to
[1:16:22] do, what God what you were born and
[1:16:24] called to do.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's that rest. There's that
[1:16:29] peace, that comfort that's found only in
[1:16:32] our promised land. And our promised land
[1:16:36] is the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's read it.
[1:16:40] Ephesians 1,
[1:16:42] we'll start with verse one here.
[1:16:47] Ephesians 1:1,
[1:16:50] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[1:16:52] will of God to the saints which are at
[1:16:56] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[1:16:58] Jesus. So, you notice this isn't to just
[1:17:00] anybody.
[1:17:02] This isn't just to the world. This is
[1:17:04] this is on this is to the saints at
[1:17:06] Ephesus and the faithful. Hello.
[1:17:09] Anybody? Am I talking to anybody in
[1:17:11] here?
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; The faithful in Christ Jesus.
[1:17:16] Grace be to you
[1:17:18] and peace from God our Father and from
[1:17:20] the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the
[1:17:22] God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:25] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:17:27] blessings in heavenly places in Christ.
[1:17:32] Now, we'll talk about that heavenly
[1:17:33] places in a minute and recognizing what
[1:17:36] that heavenly places are. Heavenly
[1:17:40] places that bless us all spiritual
[1:17:43] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[1:17:48] according as he had chosen us in him
[1:17:52] before the foundation of the world.
[1:17:53] again, chosen, adopted, elected of the
[1:17:57] world, that we should be holy and
[1:17:59] without blame before him in love, having
[1:18:03] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:18:07] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:18:11] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:18:13] will.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. to the praise of the glory of his
[1:18:17] grace, wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:18:20] in the beloved,
[1:18:22] in whom we have, we have redemption
[1:18:28] through his blood, the forgiveness of
[1:18:29] sins, according to the riches of his
[1:18:32] grace,
[1:18:33] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[1:18:36] all wisdom and prudence. What? His
[1:18:38] riches of the riches of his grace.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. having made known unto us the
[1:18:44] mystery of his will. So the mystery of
[1:18:47] it has now been made known.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's not a mystery
[1:18:51] anymore. Not to those that have
[1:18:53] believed. You get again go back to the
[1:18:56] Paul's introduction. Amen. This isn't to
[1:18:59] just anybody. This is only to the
[1:19:01] faithful in Christ Jesus.
[1:19:04] made known unto us the mystery of his
[1:19:08] will according to his good pleasure
[1:19:10] which he had purposed in himself. No
[1:19:12] wonder brother Bam could say the bride
[1:19:14] was will have thus sayeth the Lord or
[1:19:16] keep still.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Because she's she knows the mystery of
[1:19:20] his will.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:25] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:19:28] of times he might gather together in one
[1:19:31] all things in Christ both which are in
[1:19:34] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:19:36] him in whom also we have obtained
[1:19:41] obtained an inheritance an inheritance.
[1:19:44] Praise the Lord. Amen. Sound a little
[1:19:47] familiar?
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; We have obtained an inheritance. Now
[1:19:50] that inheritance belongs to us.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. When you obtain something, that
[1:19:54] means you get it. It's yours. Belongs to
[1:19:57] you. an inheritance, being predestinated
[1:20:01] according to the purpose of him who
[1:20:03] workketh all things after the counsel of
[1:20:06] his own will, that we should be to the
[1:20:08] praise of his glory, who first trusted
[1:20:10] in Christ, in whom al uh in whom ye also
[1:20:14] trusted after that ye heard the word of
[1:20:16] truth, the gospel of your salvation, in
[1:20:19] whom also after that ye believed, ye
[1:20:23] were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[1:20:26] what?
[1:20:28] promise.
[1:20:30] What was our promise? The Holy Spirit.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's our promise.
[1:20:36] That's our promised land. That is our
[1:20:39] Canaan. Amen. Is the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; That is our position that we have in the
[1:20:45] body of Christ, which is the earnest of
[1:20:47] our inheritance until the redemption of
[1:20:50] the purchased possession unto the praise
[1:20:52] of his glory. Now, look here. Let me
[1:20:55] read this quote real quick.
[1:20:57] Adoption number one
[1:21:01] 5:1560 he says now the book of Ephesians
[1:21:06] now the whole book not just the first
[1:21:08] chapter of first 14 verses we just read
[1:21:10] you read the whole chapter the whole
[1:21:12] verse excuse me the whole book
[1:21:16] speaks on that uh of that adoption.
[1:21:19] Amen. Especially uh in parts of chapter
[1:21:23] 2 and three, you can read where it talks
[1:21:26] about uh who we are in him and our
[1:21:29] position and being placed in that body.
[1:21:32] But now the book of Ephesians, brother
[1:21:33] Brandham said, placed us positionally in
[1:21:37] Christ. The book of Ephesians
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; placed us positionally in Christ. What
[1:21:42] they was in the holy land. We are placed
[1:21:46] not in the holy land but in the Holy
[1:21:49] Ghost.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; That's our promise. That's our promised
[1:21:53] land.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Not heaven. Again, that's where we're
[1:21:56] going to. Amen. That is where we uh will
[1:22:01] ultimately end up as also a promise that
[1:22:04] God gave us. But in in retrospect or in
[1:22:08] in in prospect of what the Old Testament
[1:22:12] is to the New Testament or what the
[1:22:14] children of Israel were to us today is
[1:22:16] that promised land is their natural land
[1:22:19] is our spiritual land.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost and again the
[1:22:23] representation of of all that they
[1:22:26] garnered all that they had in that land
[1:22:28] we have in ours. Amen. When we get to
[1:22:30] heaven there won't be struggles
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; there won't be fights. There won't be uh
[1:22:36] uh uh having to
[1:22:39] fight for every inch of ground. There
[1:22:41] there won't be there won't be any more
[1:22:43] death. Uh there won't be any more
[1:22:45] sorrows, babies born, ambulance sirens
[1:22:49] or hospitals built or governments to go
[1:22:53] there. Nothing of the world. None of
[1:22:55] that will be there.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's a whole different
[1:22:58] another echelon of promised land to us.
[1:23:01] But our promised land now here is the
[1:23:03] Holy Ghost. We are not placed in the
[1:23:06] holy land but in the Holy Ghost. Let us
[1:23:09] read. He said he talked about the the
[1:23:11] perfect church. Now, amen. Now we read
[1:23:14] through
[1:23:17] where it spoke of this heavenly places
[1:23:20] and heavenly places if you look here uh
[1:23:23] in Ephesians specifically speaks of in
[1:23:27] uh the first chapter 3rd verse 1 chapter
[1:23:30] 20th verse which we didn't get down that
[1:23:32] far second chapter 6th verse 3rd chapter
[1:23:35] 10th verse it speaks on heavenly places
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; why because that's the book of Ephesians
[1:23:41] and the placement of the body of the
[1:23:44] people of us in heavenly places in
[1:23:47] Christ Jesus. This heavenly places is
[1:23:50] the places that we are that is our
[1:23:51] calling.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; It is it is where we are to dwell.
[1:23:55] Christ the mystery God revealed.
[1:23:59] He said all right that's uh that's the
[1:24:02] ones he's talking to. Uh that ain't
[1:24:04] address he talk about outside world. Uh
[1:24:07] this is to you the gre faithful in
[1:24:10] Christ Jesus. Grace be to you. Peace
[1:24:12] from God our father and from the Lord
[1:24:14] Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and
[1:24:16] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath
[1:24:18] blessed us with all spiritual blessings.
[1:24:20] Now brother Bram says whereabouts
[1:24:23] in heavenly places in Christ.
[1:24:28] Praise the Lord. Heavenly places. Oh, he
[1:24:30] says how I wish I had time. Here I've
[1:24:34] got it marked here in my Bible about
[1:24:36] heavenly places. What is heavenly
[1:24:38] places? Listen real close now. heavenly
[1:24:40] places. Of course, you you could imagine
[1:24:43] just the phrase or the couple of words
[1:24:46] heavenly places garers up all kinds of
[1:24:49] imaginative things that you think of of
[1:24:52] perfection and and goodness and uh no
[1:24:56] sickness and all the things that you
[1:24:58] think of when you think of heavenly
[1:25:00] places. Sounds like this uh beautiful
[1:25:03] celestial type uh place of perfect
[1:25:05] harmony and peace and amen. But look
[1:25:08] what he talks about heavenly places
[1:25:11] and and what a place that that is. Amen.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; To be in heavenly places of Christ.
[1:25:16] Heavenly places. All wish had time. Got
[1:25:18] it. It marked my Bible about heavenly
[1:25:20] places. What is heavenly places?
[1:25:23] Heavenly places just for a moment is the
[1:25:25] believer's position in Christ.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. The believer's position in Christ.
[1:25:32] Not your pos not being in Christ, but
[1:25:35] your position in Christ.
[1:25:38] The believer's position in Christ, where
[1:25:40] the believer stands in Christ is
[1:25:44] heavenly places. That's what he's
[1:25:47] telling us. Those heavenly places that
[1:25:49] he's talking about that we just read in
[1:25:51] the third verse. Amen. When it says,
[1:25:54] "Blessed be the God and father of our
[1:25:55] Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us
[1:25:57] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:26:00] places in Christ." 120. which he had
[1:26:03] wrought in Christ when he raised him
[1:26:06] from the dead and set him at his own
[1:26:08] right hand where in the heavenly places.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now there's uh uh
[1:26:17] different thoughts and ideas of heavenly
[1:26:20] places. But what brother Badam is
[1:26:21] talking about is our position.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our position in Christ. What
[1:26:26] Ephesians Paul is re referencing. Of
[1:26:29] course, we know that the Ephesians
[1:26:30] church was more spiritual church or more
[1:26:32] spiritually advanced church. So,
[1:26:34] brother, so Paul spoke to them in
[1:26:36] spiritual revelations and spiritual
[1:26:39] truths to in I guess you'd say, I kind
[1:26:42] of hate this phrase, but in the deepness
[1:26:44] of the word
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; um to to help them see more than what he
[1:26:48] could with the Corinthians.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; So, the placement that they have here
[1:26:52] and see what that placement is. Amen.
[1:26:55] Now look in
[1:26:57] uh the purpose.
[1:27:01] Look at our purpose. We have a purpose.
[1:27:05] Verse 9 and 11 gives us a purpose. Amen.
[1:27:09] Nine. Having made known unto us the
[1:27:11] mystery of his will according to his
[1:27:13] good pleasure. We had purposed in
[1:27:15] himself which he had purposed in
[1:27:17] himself. In whom 11th verse now also we
[1:27:20] have obtained an inheritance being
[1:27:22] predestinated
[1:27:24] according to the purpose of him. Praise
[1:27:27] the Lord. That's our purpose. We've been
[1:27:29] predestined. God has given us. God has
[1:27:33] revealed to us. Amen.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. predestinated
[1:27:37] because we're predestinated in him. As
[1:27:40] he as Paul speaks on predestination,
[1:27:43] which
[1:27:45] a lot of nominal churches I know of
[1:27:48] don't even really believe in
[1:27:49] predestination. Uh a lot of times uh I
[1:27:53] I've come to find out I'll say this real
[1:27:54] quick. I've come to find out that it
[1:27:56] seems like when people have a hard time
[1:27:59] living it or or uh uh explaining it,
[1:28:02] they just discard it
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; or don't believe it or or
[1:28:08] push it off somehow. Amen. And a lot of
[1:28:11] times that's the truth. If you can't
[1:28:13] produce it, if you can't live it, if you
[1:28:15] can't explain it, if a person can't
[1:28:17] legitimately explain predestination,
[1:28:20] which to me is very simple, but if they
[1:28:22] can't, they just say, well, you know, it
[1:28:24] doesn't exist or he meant something
[1:28:26] different or something like that. But
[1:28:27] predestination is an extremely important
[1:28:30] word in our understanding of the
[1:28:32] scripture and belief of God.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; If there's no predestination, then how
[1:28:37] do you have an infinite God?
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:28:40] You can't have a God that is all
[1:28:42] knowing, infinite without having a God
[1:28:45] of predestination,
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and people say, "Well, you
[1:28:50] know, you're like puppets on puppet
[1:28:52] strings." No, no, no. Predestination
[1:28:54] does not do away with with a free will.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Not at all. Amen. God just happened to
[1:29:01] predestined and know who you were and
[1:29:04] what you would do, where you would go,
[1:29:05] how you would act, what you would say
[1:29:08] because he's all knowing.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; He knows the end from the beginning.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; So he predestined verse four
[1:29:16] as we according as he had chosen us.
[1:29:20] Chosen. Now remember that's a part of
[1:29:21] our adoption. That's our election.
[1:29:23] Chosen us in him before the foundation
[1:29:26] of the world. What is that? That's
[1:29:28] predestination.
[1:29:30] before the foundation of the world is
[1:29:32] predestination.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You were predestined.
[1:29:36] Then he goes on the fifth verse and
[1:29:38] says, "Having predestinated us, having
[1:29:41] predestinated us to the adoption of
[1:29:44] children by Jesus Christ."
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; We've been predestined to fulfill the
[1:29:50] position that God has called us to. No
[1:29:53] wonder there's such peace in living in
[1:29:54] that position.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. No wonder there's such comfort and
[1:29:58] and and and and peace in knowing you are
[1:30:00] where you belong.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; And no wonder there's so much turmoil if
[1:30:04] you don't know.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; If you don't realize or if you're where
[1:30:08] you're not supposed to be.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; And if you're in Jesus Christ, friend,
[1:30:12] you know that there's there's there's
[1:30:14] not a question about it.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; You you know you don't you don't say,
[1:30:19] "Well, I wonder if could this be it.
[1:30:22] It's it's God speaking to you. It's
[1:30:25] God's Holy Spirit moving inside you to
[1:30:28] show you this is who you are. This is
[1:30:31] where you belong. This is what I
[1:30:33] predestined you to.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; you know that.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; And it comes up. Does this Does the
[1:30:39] devil bring discouragement? Of course he
[1:30:40] does.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Does he bring darkness and dreiness and
[1:30:43] discouragement? Of course he does.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; But you just stand up beside that. You
[1:30:47] take the word of God with a strong hand
[1:30:49] of faith. You just drive it through his
[1:30:50] heart.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Get behind me, Satan.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have no place here.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; You have no right. Amen.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's who we are.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Strong and of good courage.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Predestined. Verse 11. In whom also we
[1:31:08] have obtained an inheritance
[1:31:10] by predestination.
[1:31:13] I know that's not what the scripture
[1:31:14] says, but we have received an
[1:31:17] inheritance being predestinated.
[1:31:20] Amen. By predestination,
[1:31:23] we have an inheritance.
[1:31:25] God promised the inheritance of the land
[1:31:28] to the forefathers of Joshua who had
[1:31:30] even gone on before he was rose up. But
[1:31:33] I I believe I haven't done the
[1:31:35] genealogy, but I I would they the ones
[1:31:39] that he promised it to had been passed
[1:31:41] away before Joshua even came over and
[1:31:42] was and was bringing forth the
[1:31:44] fulfillment of that. Amen. He was a part
[1:31:48] of it.
[1:31:50] But it was the it was the inheritance
[1:31:52] that had been given by predestination.
[1:31:54] God had already called it. So I don't
[1:31:56] care how much they fight, battle, war,
[1:31:59] carry on over there. Who picks who?
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Great.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; This side or that side, doesn't matter.
[1:32:06] Israel belongs to God.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Israel's God's people. Yes.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; I don't care what anybody else says.
[1:32:12] That's their land. God gave it to them.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; It's promised to them. And it don't
[1:32:17] matter what president or what government
[1:32:18] or what prime minister or what uh
[1:32:21] country says what about it doesn't
[1:32:24] matter belongs to them.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Period. That's God.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; It's about to be fulfilled in its
[1:32:31] fullness here pretty soon in my opinion.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; But we are predestined. We received an
[1:32:36] inheritance by predestination.
[1:32:39] Predestined according to the purpose of
[1:32:42] him which we read a minute ago. a
[1:32:44] purpose having purpose. Amen.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; And we're placed we're placed by
[1:32:51] predestin we're placed through
[1:32:53] predestination, but we're placed there
[1:32:55] by his grace.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're placed there by his grace.
[1:33:00] Verse six, to the praise of the glory of
[1:33:04] his grace. Of his grace, wherein he hath
[1:33:07] made us accepted in the beloved. Made us
[1:33:09] accepted in the beloved. How? By the
[1:33:12] glory of his grace. Yes.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; By the glory of his grace, we have been
[1:33:16] made accepted in the beloved. Verse
[1:33:19] seven, in whom we have redemption.
[1:33:23] Praise the Lord. And that itself speaks
[1:33:25] of God's grace. Redemption to bring back
[1:33:29] by back through his blood, the
[1:33:32] forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:33:34] riches of his grace. And oh my, how his
[1:33:37] grace must be abundantly rich to have
[1:33:40] forgiven me of my sins.
[1:33:43] Amen.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; You You feel the way you feel about it.
[1:33:47] Amen. I feel the way I feel about it.
[1:33:49] And the way I feel about it is I can't
[1:33:51] imagine somebody having enough grace to
[1:33:54] forgive everything I've done. But his
[1:33:57] abundance of grace has done that.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Forgive of sin. Placing
[1:34:04] by predestination through adop through
[1:34:07] his grace or by his grace through
[1:34:10] predestination. He has placed us. Amen.
[1:34:13] Now we sit in heavenly places in Christ
[1:34:16] Jesus. What a wonderful place to be.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful place to sit in
[1:34:22] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Knowing
[1:34:25] the position that God has placed us in.
[1:34:28] Knowing the placement where God has put
[1:34:30] us. Amen. What a place. What a time. Let
[1:34:35] me read read this scripture which will
[1:34:38] bring us into uh Lord willing our next
[1:34:41] uh the next part of this
[1:34:44] 1 Corinthians chapter 7. I just want to
[1:34:47] read this to get us to that place. I'm
[1:34:51] uh I've delivered my heart this morning,
[1:34:52] but I want to I want to read this uh and
[1:34:55] Lord willing the next next week we'll uh
[1:34:58] um we'll continue on with this thought
[1:35:00] of it. 1 Corinthians chapter 7
[1:35:04] verse 17.
[1:35:06] 1 Corinthians 7:17. I encourage to if
[1:35:09] you haven't in a while, go back and read
[1:35:11] the entire book of Ephesians. Very
[1:35:13] short. It's only six chapters.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Uh just go back and they're fairly short
[1:35:17] chapters at that. But uh that shouldn't
[1:35:20] be an excuse. Uh but go back and read
[1:35:22] that. Amen. Read through it. uh and uh
[1:35:26] see it's beautiful what what Christ what
[1:35:30] God spoke through Paul to us today.
[1:35:33] Amen. As it was, you know, some some
[1:35:36] 2,000 years ago, but as fresh to us
[1:35:38] today.
[1:35:40] 1 Corinthians now uh verse uh chapter 7
[1:35:43] verse 17. But as God hath distributed to
[1:35:46] every man, as the Lord hath called
[1:35:48] everyone,
[1:35:50] so let him walk. As God has called
[1:35:53] everyone, so let him walk, live,
[1:35:57] so let him walk. So and so ordained I in
[1:36:01] all churches. Is any man called being
[1:36:03] circumcised? Let him not become
[1:36:06] uncircumcised. Is any man called in
[1:36:08] uncircumcision?
[1:36:09] Let him not be circumcised. In other
[1:36:12] words, whether circumcision or
[1:36:13] uncircumcision doesn't matter. Just do
[1:36:15] what God called you to do.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:36:20] Circumcision is nothing and
[1:36:22] uncircumcision is nothing. But the
[1:36:25] keeping of the commandment of God is
[1:36:27] something. I know I'm adding to that,
[1:36:29] but the keeping of God's command is
[1:36:31] something.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let every man abide in
[1:36:35] the same calling wherein he was called.
[1:36:38] Art thou called, being a servant? Care
[1:36:40] not for it. But if thou mayest be made
[1:36:42] free, use it rather. For he that is
[1:36:44] called in the Lord, being a servant, is
[1:36:47] the Lord's free man. Like likewise also
[1:36:50] he that is called being free is Christ's
[1:36:52] servant. Ye are bought with a price. Be
[1:36:55] not ye the servants of men. Brethren,
[1:36:56] let every man wherein he is called
[1:36:59] therein abide with God.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wherever he was called, wherever
[1:37:05] you are called, abide in that place.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we've said so many times. Amen.
[1:37:11] To abide to live in that place, to walk
[1:37:15] in that place.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. as God has commanded you. Doesn't
[1:37:18] matter what somebody else said,
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what somebody else has
[1:37:22] tried to encourage you or tried to give
[1:37:24] you instruction or even prophesied over
[1:37:26] you.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; You go by what the Lord has showed you.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not that a prophecy from a genuine
[1:37:32] prophecy from uh gift of the spirit is
[1:37:34] is is not legitimate. I believe that as
[1:37:38] much as anything, but if you're in
[1:37:41] contact with God, God will speak to you
[1:37:43] personally. God will show you
[1:37:45] personally,
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that. And even even
[1:37:49] I've told you the story uh of me and
[1:37:51] when I first started ministering uh as
[1:37:53] young a minister or young a Christian as
[1:37:56] I was at the time. I mean, we're talking
[1:37:58] a couple of months after having received
[1:38:00] the Holy Ghost even, uh there was
[1:38:03] prophecies over me to minister and all,
[1:38:06] but uh and my pastor and my dad were
[1:38:09] like, "What's going on? What are you
[1:38:11] doing?" as waiting on the Lord. Well,
[1:38:13] the Lord spoke. I said, "I know that." I
[1:38:15] said, "But even as young a Christian as
[1:38:18] I was, I' I've always felt like if God
[1:38:21] wanted you to do something, especially
[1:38:22] something as important as ministering
[1:38:25] the gospel, which to me is um well, I
[1:38:30] it's hard for me to put into words how I
[1:38:32] covet that importance of that uh and
[1:38:35] staying on the word, but um he's he's
[1:38:38] going to speak to me. Yes.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; He's he's going to reveal it to me. He's
[1:38:42] going to show me.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not that I discounted or did not
[1:38:47] appreciate the uh the confirmations of
[1:38:50] prophecy because I believe they were of
[1:38:52] the Lord. Amen. And here 30 almost 30
[1:38:56] Well, what is today? August the 3.
[1:38:59] Yesterday was my first sermon 34 years
[1:39:02] ago.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Uh August 2nd, 1988 was the first
[1:39:07] message I ever preached. August 2nd.
[1:39:09] This August 3rd. So this is 34 years. Am
[1:39:12] I for 32 years? Whatever it is, I can't
[1:39:15] add or subtract, but I can I can preach
[1:39:18] the gospel by the grace of God. Um but
[1:39:22] but I took it as I knew it was of the
[1:39:25] Lord obviously. Amen. And I thank God
[1:39:29] for that. But you do as God tells you to
[1:39:31] do.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. As God leads you, as God shows
[1:39:34] you, as God reveals to you, that's what
[1:39:37] you do.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's stand if we
[1:39:41] could.
[1:39:50] We are in a very unique time, saints, in
[1:39:53] world's history.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; A very unique time in that
[1:39:58] in that there has not been a time Since
[1:40:06] Adam was spoke into existence that we
[1:40:08] are now,
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; There was a time where God destroyed the
[1:40:12] world and eight souls came out of that.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; There was that time, but that was still
[1:40:17] a continuence.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, after the bride's gone, this
[1:40:21] world will continue to go on. After the
[1:40:24] bride goes in the rapture, this world
[1:40:26] will continue to go on.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; But it'll go on into apostasy. It'll go
[1:40:30] on to an Armageddon.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. It'll go on to a total annihilation
[1:40:34] where the world completely uh uh is not
[1:40:39] obliterated but is is conformed and
[1:40:41] changed.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. The atmosphere explode and all
[1:40:44] those where there'll be a new beginning,
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; a new start.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I believe saints,
[1:40:51] we're at that time. I believe we're at
[1:40:53] that crossroads at this time where that
[1:40:57] is on us right now.
[1:41:00] I don't believe it's going to be much
[1:41:01] longer before we see our loved ones.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't I believe it's right at
[1:41:07] hand. Those that are going on now are
[1:41:10] just on the other side just waiting.
[1:41:13] Praise the Lord. And I myself am very
[1:41:16] anxious to
[1:41:19] be re reunited with my family that's
[1:41:22] gone on, with my friends, with my church
[1:41:24] families that's gone on and people that

[1:41:28] been a lot of there have been a lot of
[1:41:31] brothers and sisters passed away in the
[1:41:33] 30 some odd years of my ministering. Um,

[1:41:42] now. Brother Rogers mom's passed and but
[1:41:46] we'll see them all again very soon.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Very, very soon. I'm looking
[1:41:51] forward to that time. We hold our family
[1:41:53] dear. Amen.
