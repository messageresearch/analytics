well as you can see uh there's only three four of us five of us I guess including me here today so we got quite a few prayer requests Amen to mention to you brother Danny had mentioned one earlier that we'll reiterate here in just a moment with brother Dennis uh but I did get a text from sister sharah this morning they're not feeling well not here today got a text from Tabitha yest yesterday Ruth's not still not feeling uh quite right she's not feeling well either uh Tabitha is not uh that is not feeling well today uh sister Norma had some company today I thought she might come in she said she might be able to come in a little bit late uh so sister Norma May yet still be here but she did ask us that we would pray she's still having problems with her lungs uh having a hard time doing things and without getting out of breath and all so uh please remember Sister Norman prayer with her lungs uh also continue remember Sister Karen uh the continuing battle she's having with her hip she did have a u another the doctor tell her again or have another uh x-ray sonogram whatever they do uh found out that her hip is rubbing bone on bone uh so uh it's extremely painful uh so please remember she's facing surgery with all the medical advances they have uh they can't just shoot some grease in there they have to go through a whole replacement it seems like with medical advancement and the knee problems and the hip problems and all that older people are having today or should I say we having problems today that um they could come up with something that they could put in there to uh build back a lubricant but uh as of right now there's still she's still facing surgery replacement surgery so please remember Sister Karen in prayer if you would uh also my little buddy Joel is not here today hopefully they're watching uh he's supposed to have a recital today again uh with his drums over the Guitar Center and although I haven't spoke to him since last week he's I'm sure he's probably pretty nervous again like he was last time time so please remember him if you would um with his anxiety his his nervousness he did so good last time he was so nervous but he did so great um I was so proud of him I don't believe he's going to do any I believe he's going to do just as good or better today unfortunately I have to fly out this afternoon after service today so I'll miss it but um hopefully and just pray for him that he'll be doing well sister sheilia was planning on being with us today but she text this morning and said she woke up with a call from runny nose people have been coming into their work uh sick uh getting tested for Co afterwards and things like that so please remember Sister sheilia this morning just didn't feel well to come sister matis got attacked this week as well uh she had gotten over it was feeling better uh in her text she said she kind of overtaxed her body and and it kind of came back so she's dealing with those symptoms again uh this morning so please remember her in prayer as well uh also brother Pat went through his surgery this week um his uh uh his heart surgery his uh pacemaker they got put in this week he felt a lot better I mean he said way times better I think he actually said four times uh know how you measure that but anyway it's his body it's his heart but he's feeling much much better doing much better uh so I didn't expect him to be here as kind of soon to be here after opening up your chest uh but they usually watch so God bless you brother Pat please remember him in prayer if you would uh also I had not heard from Sister Julie uh yesterday this morning please pray for her miss her obviously of course when she's not here uh very much so please remember her in prayer also brother Dany wrote a request uh for his friend Ron who lives in the apartments with him he went to the hospital where they removed a blockage from his bow duck when they released him he was told that to see an oncologist uh this coming Monday to find out if it was cancerous or not and so brother Danny's prayer our prayer for this man Ron is that the test will come back benign negative for cancer so let's remember that in prayer if you would um also uh brother Dennis wrote a request out here that he had mentioned um uh that he wanted us to know he said please continue to keep me up in prayers I have been blessed to be over with the shingles but now I'm dealing with um I have to look it up on my phone to get the the medical name of it uh some kind of Neurology neur neuropathy neuropathy uh let me just find that I think it's a little more involved because I have neuropathy in my hands yeah not it's not neurop it's it's neurolog something of post herpetic uh neuralgia yes that is a lasting pain in the areas of your skin where you had shingles uh this is the medical thing brother Dennis sent me he said around one in five people with shingles will get post post herpetic neuralgia uh people aged 50 over particularly at RIS many people with this make a full recovery within a year but symptoms occasionally last for several years or may be permanent uh and that being said I will read you what the rest of what brother Dennis wrote is dealing with that uh post herpetic neuralgia which is very hard to cope with I'm constantly dealing with sharp pains and aching discomfort and I was told it would take one and three month one to three months to get over this and with some uh and with some even over a year I am believing as we agree together that I'll be over this next week and be back in fellowship with all of you Believers God bless you brother Dennis amen so that is our prayer as well we're going to believe that as well and trust that that's the Lord going to touch has already touched continue to touch help brother Dennis amen and bless him with this situation and take the pain away from him uh I found out yesterday uh that it's I guess not necessarily an urgent prayer request but for some reason when I was in here studying I had an old friend of mine from work uh he didn't work where I did but he was a sales consultant that called on me uh he died he passed away seven years ago he just came on my heart so I decided to Google him and it was a whole article from mad that was on there uh and apparently May of 2016 he was riding his motorcycle a guy pulled out from a bar ran over a curb ran over the sidewalk right out in front of him uh motorcycle hit him uh laid on the street dying the man gets out of his car walks around goes back in the bar and my friend laid there on the on the concrete dying uh he did die as uh as a result of his wounds and he was a very good friend of mine um and I just pray that you his he actually that had actually been the day that his daughter had graduated from high school they were C celebrating their daughter's graduation from high school so it's quite a quite a blow I know it's been seven years ago seven and a half years uh but uh his wife's name's Lisa the daughter's named Reagan please pray for them uh it just it came kind of a blow to me uh just don't expect that he was a little older than I was but just don't expect those things to happen like that when you do and that way it just grips your heart so uh kind of kind of was a tough blow for me yesterday to hear about that so I hadn't spoke to him since we left Charlotte but he was still a good friend of mine and u i just pra that he was good to me he's in the arms of the Lord so amen so I appreciate that amen and all the requests I than that to everybody it's everything I had written down so anybody have an unspoken request anything else anything anybody like to mention yes missed this morning I had a little Ras under my KN so I thought oh I have shingles and the funny part then sent me a uh syat and she it starts for the upper torso it works itself down so I was relied you know just psychologically he's my win yeah I thought I'm going to get sure sure amen so I thank God that I'm here praise the Lord amen thankful for that brother Danny amen sorry it's maybe a little chilly I I talked to the maintenance guy yesterday he was supposed to turn the heat on yesterday I got here this morning it's not working so uh if you feel a little chilly apologize kind of rare for two some but it does happen in the winter time it it's pretty cool so amen so

amen and we'll uh turn in the scriptures here St Matthew chapter 11 amen we've been a few weeks of um since we've gone into uh this message God in Simplicity we've been on false teachers first couple of Parts we're on part three today um actually back before Thanksgiving we were going to do part part three of this uh false teachers uh back before Thanksgiving then we had Thanksgiving Thanksgiving message and then a couple of services off so uh the Lord willing would try to get back into this uh try to if we can maybe sort of pick up before we left off but we'll go back to Matthew chapter 11 verse 25 uh that we use of scripture to begin this uh subject this topic God in Simplicity amen before we read the word can we bow our heads for another word of prayer Lord Jesus father it is indeed a privilege to be here Lord thanking you so much for your grace your mercy your love your blessings all that you've give to us done for us given in every way God where would we be without you thank you Lord for this place for this people Lord for those who may be streaming Lord but we're most of all thankful for you father and your spirit being here doing exceeding and abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think depending on you completely fully for everything that happens of any good in this place today any any good that happens to any of us father Lord we're just depending on you to speak to us to speak through US Lord to help us in every way Lord we're a needy people today many out sick many out Lord with needs in their lives just trusting and continuing Lord to believe you for continuing prayer Lord and healing father and blessing in any in all of our Lives God we know that you are faithful we know that you're here you are true God we're trusting and believing you Lord to accomplish what you would have set forth in this service today today God for those that have come we're just trusting Lord that your word does not return void but accomplish what you have it set forth for today as we give you praise honor and glory for it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen Matthew 11:25 amen it says at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee old father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto bath praise the Lord you could be seated if you'd like those who may remember uh the last time that we were here and spoke through the second part amen of false teachers the way that the false teaching comes so many times uh uh becomes uh more complicated more difficult harder to understand uh for a common person for a regular person or lot a lot of times for almost anybody to be able to understand and uh we mentioned at that last time that we were going to get uh this time was going to become very personal it's going to become very close to us uh and and it's the topic that's hard to deal with sometimes and hard to bring up you don't really want to mention it or say anything about it but the fact of the matter is it is true it is true today just like it was true in the scripture just like it was true when brother Brandon was here just like it was true when Paul said what he said about Grievious wolves coming in sparing not the flock it's still true regardless and as hard as it is the scripture tells us this amen so let's go over to Second Peter amen uh we'll read beginning at the 2 chapter first verse second Peter 2:1 this is not to ward off anything about uh uh anyone in particular anything I I know I have mentioned before uh that uh Paul called Nam scripture uh in a couple of places brother brandom had got to the place that right before the Lord took him he was planning on calling some names out of people and um I I don't feel at Liberty to do that nor would I uh of course it would only be something that would be uh my observation any with anyway without a revelation from the Lord uh but the fact that it does happen is just the warning that the scripture gives us it's not something that I'm trying to promote as an overall scare you of other ministers or anything like that but it's just a warning it's a warning through the scripture it's a warning to understand that even in our own ranks today even in this message that the same thing persists and it's here uh and and and and the Lord allows it to be that way amen there's something that brings and causes a separation uh between and remember the whole bottom line of this isn't Church it isn't Fellowship it isn't having a place to go it isn't a pastor it isn't the people around you it isn't all these things that we do that are that are really mainly pump in circumstance that surround everything that we uh do as Christians the bottom line of being a Christian the bottom line of being a Bible believing God-fearing Holy Ghost filled Christian is the word that's the bottom line to all of this to everything that we do uh to all the services to uh the Sunday school and to the attendance and to the fellowship and all the things we enjoy together the meals we have together and the time we spend and the fellowship and the relying upon one another for prayer requests and things like that the bottom line of the whole thing of being a Christian is the word and that's the bottom line that's that's where it all settles to and ends up up is the word and that's the most important thing because Christ is the word amen Christ is the word without Christ the revelation of that word then what does any of it do for us it's a nice I guess maybe it be a nice life to live but what's the end result the end result for us is we want to be in a rapture we want to go to heaven we want to be with our lord Jesus our savior our loved ones that have gone on before that's what we want that's what our our whole point of being here is to is to uh have that goal and to have that aim to end up at that place that's the whole thing people choose different ways they choose different thoughts they different denominations different churches uh so many people uh there's only one way and that is Jesus Christ but there's thousands and thousands and thousands of ways that people have conjured within themselves to get to that one place amen it's amazing how that comes about but the fact is that the Lord the Lord Deliver Us that are his delivers us all amen delivers us all that belong to him uh but the most important thing here not to notice is the word and that's the one thing that that Paul called out if you notice you look at the names that Paul called in Scripture it was because of false Doctrine if you look at the warning that Jesus gave uh through the church ages it was because of what false Doctrine what was it when brother brandham was here it it it it's like when brother brandham talked about uh Martin Luther holding his head above all the fanaticism see but he had to stay it wasn't the fanaticism it was staying straight on that word that message that God gave him the just shall live by faith all this other stuff swirling around was just that same thing with brother brand people calling him God and baptizing his name and all this falseness all these things that are wrong and and people out there today saying how wrong this message is saying how wrong brother brandom was and all just swirling around the bottom line is to get the message out to get the word out to let this word this this truth come and permeate into a group of people's hearts and lives and change their lives so that those people are the people the people of God are the people that God sent him for to bring this word so that Christ could live in us so that that word would take pretence in our hearts no false Doctrine none of this other that's all out and all all the even the fellowship and stuff we have all that's great and fine but that's not what it's about it's about Christ in Christ the word amen and so when it comes to this this warning Peter gives here now Peter doesn't call names but he's very specific chapter 2 verse one but there were false prophets all also among the people where among the people what false prophets where among the people amen now that's obviously talking about the people that they had had fellowship with people they had we'll just say today church with people they rub elbows with people they listen to ministering from amen false prophets among those people again I'm not trying to scare you I'm just trying to help understand this is a part of life it's a part of of a warning of the scripture amen this is scripture that we are to be aware of Amen make sure that when we are on the word that that word is coming from the scripture amen which we know the message brother Brandon brought was from the word praise the Lord now false prophets also among the people said it was going to get personal Saints amen right among the people people even as there shall be false teachers among you amen now that's getting really personal Peter's telling us very personally here there's going to be there shall be false teachers among you Among Us that's what it is now look remember we've talked about this several times I've mentioned this the Bible says that it was be so close it would deceive the very elect if possible we know denomination is not close we know the Catholic church is not close we know these things out in the world and the government all this stuff all those things they're not close not close enough that would deceive the very elect yes charismatic Calvary churches all those those aren't close enough to that that would deceive you right you know better than that that's not anything that would deceive you but what would be so close that it would deceive the El if it were possible that would be just like it was at the beginning when Satan brought 99% truth to Eve that 99% truth would be the thing that would bring the deception for this last day through false teachers false teachers what does a teacher do he teaches or even she of course she wouldn't be deceptive enough to a Believer uh to uh uh to deceive you but it would be a a false teacher that would teach what false Doctrine yeah false Doctrine can be anything that is 99% truth or less because anything less than 100% is a false Doctrine it's something that's been added to something that's been changed something that's been interjected by a man's opinion thought idea whatever it is that brings in a do Dogma not a Doctrine not a scriptural Doctrine but a Dogma because a Dogma is something man-made a Doctrine is something god-given a Dogma is something that's man-made and a Dogma is not what we live by it's not what we go by we don't want any man's idea interjected into the scripture we want it to be the word and the word only praise the Lord so false teachers among you who privately or privy privately shall bring in damnable heresies again it you think 99% is really good 99% of almost anything else is wonderful I mean if you hit if you hit 99% of bowling pins you'd be on the PGA tour or the PBA tour you'd be a professional bowler if you hit uh a uh we'll just say any if you hit a if you get a a a base hit 99% of the time you come up to bat you're going to be the best baseball player ever 99 seems like a lot that's that's that seems like a great percentage but 99% you call it a dandel heresy yeah because 99% is exactly what it took to throw this whole world into the chaotic state that it's in today yeah 99% praise the Lord so yes it could be a deceiving her Y which is what that means amen it means to be deceptive it means to be destructive a heresy that's destructive a Dogma that's destructive that's brought in by false teachers that are among the people that are even among you praise the Lord even denying the Lord that bought them and bring upon themselves Swift destruction well of course they deny deny the Lord if they deny the word if they're bringing 99 or less per of the word of course they deny the Lord Jesus because they're denying the word If you deny any part of the word Genesis 1 to revelation 22 If you deny any part of that word you're denying Jesus Christ well of course you say well is that deny the Lord of course they do it they deny the word they deny the Lord and those that follow them and believe their pernicious ways believe their Dogma teaching it might sound good to the flesh Saints but it's not God's word actually most of the time if it's something that you hear that's pleasing to the flesh is probably not coming from the purity of God's word amen because most of the word isn't meant to be good to the flesh it's good for the soul not for the flesh amen God's word's good for the soul it's soul food not not natural food it's soul food it's food for the soul praise the Lord amen so of course they deny the word they deny Christ that's that simple but now the worst part about this is not only are there going to be false teachers or they are false teachers we nowh at the end so we're not looking something in the future way out it's here has to be we at the end the worst part is verse two and many many any shall follow their pernicious ways that's destructive pernicious is is uh is is uh uh the end of Destruction amen the the death is the end of that predition is what it comes from pernicious predition that end of Destruction many shall follow their pernicious Ways by reason of whom the way of Truth shall be evil spoken of Now isn't that just the truth that's happening today more and more all the time the way of Truth what's the way of truth that we have for this day the message the message that God brought through a prophet is the way that we have today that's being evil spoken of uh me and my wife had this discussion well we've had it several times but we had it just the other day of a of people that leave the message and most of these people when they leave the message they can't just go off and live their lives they they've got to slander and put down and ridicule and say horrible evil nasty demonic things about it and about brother bradam and about his family they say why if if you don't believe this then I'm sorry you don't but you know uh bye but they can't do that it has to be something that becomes an object of what they are speaking evil of of the truth this truth has become something that's a focal point of what their evil speaking is about and they've left the message they've denounced the truth they've denounced the prophet and yet now they've got to speak evil of it and many follow these ways amen now evil can be brought in different ways it can be brought as in people that have left and it can be people that remember we talked about last week uh or the last time we spoke on this uh second Thessalonians remember second Thessalonians there's a great falling away but recognize uh the understanding that I I could absolutely be wrong but the thought the process the possibility forgot to start my phone here the possibility that that falling away isn't people leaving church it isn't altogether necessarily people leaving the message but people leaving the fundamental foundation of the of the doctrine of the Church of the of this message that they're leaving they leave away from the word which is verse one they've left the word they've Fallen away from their first love as Jesus told them in in the first church age they've Fallen away from their first Love Gone Away from the word to hybrid something for whatever reason uh it it seems like it's got to become more complicated so more people believe it uh it's got to be more educated it's got to be more highly intellectual uh it's got to be something that that is harder for people to attain so they they assume that it's got to to be right because how could he preach like that if it wasn't true or remember the the the rain falls on the just and the unjust you say how can they preach like that by the same anointing that I'm preaching this morning by the same anointing that falls on uh the Wheats and the tears the same anointing that's Fallen across the city the same is Fallen Across the Nation on true Brothers on on on everybody on the true and the false of course they can do that amen but they bring about their own way their own ideas their own thoughts many are following those pricious ways those dangerous ways by the way which the truth is being evil spoken of amen and this message today is probably more so since it was introduced being evil spoken of than at any time that people are walking away from it leaving it having having nothing to do with it but speaking evil about it it's sad but many many are folling following that way that's why it's a very Stark warning to understand I friend I don't want to be one of those people I don't I don't want to be one that falls by the side to by 99% truth but be on the word settled in the word the truth the message that derived from this scripture amen people say there's contrary things well brother bandam contradicted himself here well I can show you a hundred places that people think the Bible contradicts itself amen so if you're going to say one contradicts the other without Revelation then you can certainly say this contradicts itself without Revelation it all contradictory but what does it do it separates divides the unbeliever from the make believer make Believer from the believer amen remember those three classes of people are were to go together up till the end they were a lot of in a lot of ways look a lot alike of course the believe the make believer and the believer amen unbeliever is just always an unbeliever but the make believer and the believer gone along together amen for all this time that there's something that brings the separation just like there's a there something that brings the separation between the foolish virgin and the wise virgin what is it it's the oil amen the Holy Spirit praise God that separates those two that brings truth in third verse now and and through covetousness that's evil Lust by the way through covetousness shall they with Fain words that's good molded words great speaker orator shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time linger not and their damnation Slumber Earth not so this and those people through covetousness through lustful thinking through lustful ideas through through through the flesh the desires of the flesh convince people through their lust make merchandise because that's that that's the heartest desire to want to do it because notice if a person that's a Believer what did Brother green always say the the bride cannot be deceived amen she can there can be some to go along for a while but God will bring to her attention and reveal to her a bride member someone that belongs to him bring to her into that place where she's supposed to be to recognize something's not right something's going on here that is not right and that person will pull away and leave away from anything that's that's 99% truth or less let's just put it that way amen but they make merchandise of the others because there's something in that person that wanted that anyway people go along for a while but deep down in there you can only hide it for so long deep down in there there's something that always wanted this and when it's brought out and brought forth how do you think all these Cults come to fruition you think we look at it and say how could someone have fallen for this man how could someone have gone down uh to a different country or drank this stuff or acted this way or how could someone become a part of that and you look at it and think uh that that that how could because they they pray upon the people who have that desire in their heart already they pray upon of course the lonely and the destitute and and the people that feel worthless or the people that feel like they're unloved they pray upon those people but there's something in there that that that that message reaches out to them whatever their message is that reaches out to something that's in their a desire of theirs that they want to do it becomes a merchandising it's kind of a strange word in the scripture but that's what it is they become a part of that because it's something that they've always wanted it's it's a part of what their life or what they've wanted to do amen look at brother bam says several places and and gives warning himself but let me read a couple of things to help us here God hiding and revealing himself in Simplicity he brings it very clear he said those men uh who had been taught a man could not be a teacher a priest until he was born in a certain lineage after Levi so forth and just think his great great great great great great great grandfather was a priest laying right in that word in that Temple day and night like the Catholic priest or Minister that's handed down Minister from generations to the certain churches so forth my great great grandfather was a miss a Methodist Bishop my grandfather was a bishop and so forth amen just like the same idea that people have about politics well my great granddaddy my granddaddy my they were all Democrats I'll be a Democrat they're all Republicans so I'll be a republican they were all Baptist so I'll be a Baptist they were all my whole family we were all Methodist so I'll be a Methodist too it follows that same line of thinking that he's talking about all that lives right in the word lives right in in the word but they had formed their own way of it which is exactly what Peter's warning was they had formed their own way of their own way not God's way their own way and their children had accepted it in such a way that the fathers had taught it until the fathers had taught it off the real way they made such an organization out of it till when the Spirit tried to present the truth they could not receive it and that's the same thing today that got of course brother Ram's talking about his time his age when he was here what he was dealing with through denominations and people coming and raising and being going to seminaries and Baptists and methodists and Catholics and and and all this that they had been part of and so it was a hard nut if you will to crack because brother random saw it how men had developed this denominations had developed this and they had made their own way of it laying in the scripture he says day and night day and night amen they had made their own way of it so when truth had got themselves so built up in this that even when truth actual scriptural truth Vindicated truth come and present itself they would not listen they could not receive it they did not he said they could not receive it and that's the same thing today the same thing going on today now what did Brother bam say what did Paul say after my departure Grievous wolves will come in not sparing the flock and that's exactly what happened when Paul left it's exactly what's happened after brother brandom left and now even more so now that you see the brothers that was with brother brandom going away amen like the brother Muse and the brother greens and these that are going away more and more you see it even that much more amen even after brother brandom had went away he says I don't mean to be rude but it's right it's the same thing today they make it so complicated some other way they teach it just like it been said but God don't have any grandchildren you know that God has sons and daughters and his sons and daughters listen to his word amen they believe his word praise the Lord the indictment strong message if you haven't listened to it indictment look at this now when it separates there is bound to be some basic reason that we're not together it's studying in studying it I realize in studying it it's not the colors of our skin because yellow black brown white all separate different organizations it's not the kind of food we eat we all eat the the same food we wear the same clothes and so forth but I see where basically it's at is man who has gotten off the beaten path of the teaching of the Gospel off the beaten path of the teaching of the Gospel amen not a man's idea not a denomination not a seminary but off the gospel man has gotten off the gospel now you've got people that are that are over their heads in politics and still call call themselves Reverend look a minister a reverend has no business being if he's a true minister in politics he doesn't no room on TV no room running for office you see them they run for office I know they probably get in their heart say they want to do something good they want to change things friends I I can get that but he has no business not a true a minister has no business being in that venue God God's gave him a venue if he's a true Minister and it's right behind a pull pit preaching this gospel amen that's where it belongs praise the Lord they've gotten off the beaten path of teaching the gospel each man there ought to be the same way to definitely show which is right and wrong and the only way you'll ever do it is not put any interpretation to the word just we just read it the way it is believe it the way it is and hold to that word the way it is amen how do they do they take many people believe those pernicious ways and take them off the beaten path look at this one beaten path that brother Bram firmly laid for us for this day that has gone off that path listen this God in hiding himself and in Simplicity again brother man says I'm make it's very short amen you probably know where I'm headed when I say this brother R said he God never ordained denominations he never ordained groups of men he ordained men to preach the gospel not Machinery not Mechanical Devices he pre he he ordained man to preach the gospel not saying that you can't that you don't listen to the tapes the message not saying that amen but it takes in this day just like it was then God's anointing on men of God that are called of God to preach this gospel still the same today amen he didn't ordain a Machinery he didn't ordain a mechanical device he ordained a man yeah he ordained men to preach the gospel and there are men that are ordained of God that are preaching this pure unadulterated word yet today all over the world therefore the bride for this last day to get that bride ready those sa this Rapture is about to take place and we're about to go home now what's happened on the other side of things that there are groups of people that are strictly declaring only push play only play a tape only listen to brother brandham when brother brandham himself if they listen to it while they push the button if they listen to what brother bandam said is absolutely contrary to what he said contrary to what brother Brandon preached was for him only to push a play button for us only to listen to brother brandham absolutely not brother brandham said he'll always have men to preach the gospel ordained of God Amen tell what to listen to when to listen to it how and and and go with that friend if that isn't as nickan as I've heard I don't know what is that's denomination as any denomination including the Catholic church that's as nickon as any any controlling body has over a group of people that you'll find in the scripture or anywhere in history it's happening right now that one group of it all I that's okay I I love them they're my brothers I love Brother Joseph absolutely spent time with him he's a good brother he stopped one time and had conversation with us was at brandom Tabernacle was very friendly love the man do anything to help him but he's wrong all this is wrong friend it's up to you and I God did not ordain a group of men he ordained men to preach the gospel right praise the Lord not to be in control over other people but to but to preach the gospel Galatians let's go to Galatians I'll finish this up here Galatians I got two more scriptures Galatians is next and then we'll go to Jude Galatians chapter 2 verse one Galatians 2:1 then 14 years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas and took Titus with me also and I went up by Revelation communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles but private ly to them which were of reputation lest by any means I should run or had run in vain but neither Titus who was with me being a Greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of false Brethren unawares listen now false Brethren false brethren we know this brother Brown preached false anointed amen at the end time Paul false Brethren unawares amen that means they're in the group and people don't realize it amen just like Peter said in the group unawares many people follow their ways when their false Brethren unawares brought in who came in privately to spy out our Li Li Y which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage again that's exactly the opposite of what a lot of them will tell you A lot of them will tell you you do not be in what they consider the bondage of this message friend it's not the bondage of the message it's the liberty of Christ to live according to his word see that was the problem that they have when they came to this United States and established this country they had to live based on the dict Ates of what the church and the government was telling them to do they could not live by their conscience and the dictates of this word they had to live by what they were told to do that's bondage they call it Freedom friend it's not Freedom it's bondage freedom is living how you want to live and how you want to live as a Believer is according to the word to be pleasing to the Lord Jesus that's freedom and they came in to spy out false Brethren unaware they're false but yet undetected trying to spy out people's Liberties and tell them this isn't like this this isn't like this you shouldn't have to do this you don't have to live like that you don't have to do this and what do they do they confuse people and cause people something probably again it was already in their heart oh I didn't really want to do that anyway well now you've got an excuse not a reason reasons or excuses are two different things you have an EXC excuse let's see how good your excuse goes before God Almighty but I but not a reason I have an excuse now because it was already something in there that when they came forth with this false word they made merchandise out of you oh my same thing happens today to people Saints they take the word and they twist it to make their own ideas about it or they just tell you well in fact a lot of people just take a whole half of this Bible wow let's just go over to Matthew one just ripped the other St the garbage friend if you cannot believe and place your entire Eternal salvation and eternal life on every word of this Bible throw it all away yeah amen I believe every bit of it even the part I don't understand amen and try our best to obey every bit of it what the word says is God's word to me but false Brethren come in unawares they say this and that and they they tickle someone who who kind of wanted to do that anyway and all they go that's the he makes merchandise out of them my mind brings them what does it do it brings them into bondage brings them into bondage especially if that person is a True Believer especially if that person's a true seed of God it'll really bring that person into bondage I mean you see a lot of times people go off in the world and go do whatever live their lives and and and nothing ever really happens to them I I'm sorry but I worry about those people yeah because if you're not serving the lord God's going to make your life miserable until you do amen if you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing or how you're supposed to be doing it God's going to get it from you somehow he's going to make it miserable somehow God's going to do it amen to try to bring us around to where we're supposed to be in him amen that's his whole point is to bring us to that place Jude let me read Jude and a couple uh quotes and I'll close I mean two of the largest facets in the message today are are uh intellectualism and legalism yeah legalism to bring people into bondage again because it's not legalism that we live and me it's Holiness that we live we live we don't live this way because we have to we live this way because we want to and living that way just because you do it as an intellectual exercise or something that's you've been educated into doesn't mean anything it's got to be from your heart something again going back to Thanksgiving something that we do from our heart because we want to do it amen not because we're forced to do it because we want to do it it's in our heart to do it we know what God's word says about about it so we want to live it to the best of our abilities intellectualism like I said is just trying to take and make this message up where people can't half the time can't understand it amen make it more intellectual than just the pure salvation of the Gospel Jude now verse three and 4 beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the and salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints now why should we have to contend for Faith why should we have to fight and battle earnestly earnestly fight and battle and contend for faith not just Faith but the faith that was once delivered to the Saints the faith that we know that we saw manifesting itself in brother Bam's Ministry and in those that believe throughout time up to this point they do the same thing the exhortation from Jude is to earnestly contend don't let that be stolen from you don't let that faith that that pure unadulterated Faith Of God be stolen from you taken from you uh manipulated away from you hold on to it contend anybody comes to take it away friend you pull out the sword of the spirit and you you go to work amen don't let it be taken from you if you have to uh make an enemy out of a friend don't make them an enemy but they may think you're an enemy then whatever you do you got to contend earnestly contend to hold on to keep that faith for fourth verse for there are C certain men crept in unawares wow it sounds a whole lot like what Peter said and what galatian what Paul said in Galatians amen men crept in unawares so they're in there but people don't know it God will reveal it to you if you belong to him he'll reveal it to you amen that's why Paul knew and called names that's why brother Bram knew and was going to call names amen God help us there in there they're in here unawares in this message among our ranks some have left some leave it and say the message is nothing and they call what we believe and hold true to be heresy amen that's exactly right the things that we hold dear the things that we believe in to that's a part of our Salvation they they call heresy they've come in unawares some are still here some have left who were before of old or ordained they were ordained to this condemnation they were ordained to do what they do you say how can those people exist God ordained them to do so remember again we go back to Thessalonians I wish I wish this hadn't been hadn't come so long after we read that part because it runs so well in continuity together with uh second Thessalonians if you want to go back read it again um 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 it's very very important to draw that back to this to understand this isn't just an isolated thing this isn't just something that I pulled one scripture to try to make a Doctrine friend this is a theme that went all through the Bible that went all through the New Testament at least went all through in brother Bam's Ministry remember the that the people calling brother randam God all the fanaticism that followed people had to have a brother vom God used a sign in the hand there people come along had to have a sign in their hand uh the discernment people had to try to discern uh prayer lines with people staggering around like brother bam did on the video like like they're falling in the same uh anointing or something like that my friend it's just it's just Carl impersonation yeah and it's the fanaticism still goes on today I've seen it happen even at the Tabernacle not brother green now amen did just false impersonation I'll just leave it at that but try to draw people away God and and does it but they come in unawares but they are ordained to that place they were ordained by God to that time what did God say in Thessalonians what what did Paul what did God have Paul say in Thessalonians that he would send them strong delusion and that they would believe a lie and be damned by it yeah my mind they ordained to this ordained just as ordained as a true Minister as I by God's grace I believe I am a a true minister of God ordained just as ordained just as I'm ordained to this post here today they are ordained to their post by God to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ taking the grace of God and making a disgrace out of it what was Paul's answer to the Roman Church for that they say well if Grace is abounding and if it abounds more if we sin why we just keep sinning Paul said God forbid it's not for that purpose amen it's not so you can just go do whatever you want and God's grace is going to be there right God's Grace will be there for those who believe and hold to it and Trust in it because we need God's grace even today more than ever yeah we need God's grace and God does forgive God does bring forgiveness into our absolutely but we don't go about living and doing however we want just believing that God's going to forgive us that's making the grace of God a disgrace that's taken the grace of God and make it into lasciviousness people ordained men ordained to that purpose unfortunately it's sad unfortunately but true amen I said I was going to read this couple of things here and we're going to close amen maybe I just go down just to this one here praise the Lord I'm looking for this other one I was trying to find amen here we go in the church age book this is out out of the church age book trying to remember uh can't remember exactly which one it was in here which section of the church a book but if you wanted to go find it it wouldn't be a problem to find if you do a search on it but brother Ram said this now now in every case you'll find he's come through read reading 1 Timothy 4 now uh that some in the latter times will depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and such doctrines of devils he said first Timothy which we didn't read that part uh trying to keep this a little shorter now now in every case though he says after reading that he says now in every case you will notice that a false prophet is one who is outside the word that's number one that's the number one most important thing a false someone who is false is outside the word a false prophet is outside the word just as we showed you that Antichrist means anti- word so these false prophets come perverting the word or again just 99% is a perversion of the word giving it a meaning that fits their own devilish ends he said have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear by fear intimidation by fear they bind people to themselves not Christ amen I I would challenge anybody to find one place where brother bam ever tried to bind people to himself yeah never ever but he always tried always worked always preached to bind the people to Jesus Christ amen always to Jesus Christ and with God's help and mercy that's all I'll ever do is try to bind people including myself to Jesus Jesus Christ but these false prophets these false teachers they lead each other lead others astray and bind them by fear intimidation scar Scare Tactics oh well you're going to go to hell if you don't come here so much there's a church in town that when people leave that church they take them out from under the blood and tell them they're lost even if they're just going to another message Church even if they just feel led to go under another Pastor even if the Lord's just taking them somewhere else they're they're lost if they don't go to that church lost they're not a part of God's economy what are they doing binding the people to themselves by fear scaring the people you will not make a Rapture if you go any place else well that's just a horrible heresy amen of itself that's not even 99% word that's not even 9% word they say that if the people don't do what they say or if they leave then destruction will follow they are false prophets for a true Prophet will always lead one to the word and bind the people to Jesus Christ and he won't tell the people to fear Him or what he says amen we have respect for God and for God's word absolutely but we don't even try to promote God in that light to say well now if you leave god well yeah you're doomed but not a church God can lead people where he wants to lead them God can reveal to anybody who he wants to reveal to we've read that all we know that all through the scripture All Through Time where did Brother brandham even came up in denomination was claimed to be a denomination and was originally ordained as a the Baptist Minister but that's not where God wanted him that's not where God had him to be and when he left and he went out and God showed him these are your people I'll take care of you and God blessed him God was with him God took care of him and whatever he did God was leading him but he lost a lot of people as a result he lost friends he lost brothers in Christ that that left him amen it's like that song we sang do thy friends despise and reject Thee Well if your friends despise you they're not friends especially if you espouse to them your feelings and what you believe and what you hold true in life what's important to you if they leave you over that they're not friends amen praise the Lord that's the way I look at it anyway how could a true friend leave you despise you uh they're not a friend amen but the the word will stand true and God will stand true with his word and with his people always amen always it's a beware through the scripture we know it's got to line up with the word Saints amen got to line up with the message which is derived from the word if it doesn't there's anything there just doesn't click and somethings off it's God leading uh you know my wife has a has a a client that's a lady friend I guess now that she works with takes care of and her son lives in San Diego and we saw him had lunch with him this past week and he was asking me about our church and I said that don't I we're just a Bible believing Bible believing group of Christians well what where do you derive from us derive from the from the Bible you know because a lot of people don't understand if you've got no denomination and no no uh uh thing that you your platform is is uh projected from then what do you preach a stuff preach by Revelation the Bible says you can't even know Jesus but by Revelation I said uh I and he asked me about uh the Bible and the interpretations of the Bible and all the different uh um uh variations of the Bible I gu there's thousands of them now I said well I don't promote any particular one I just promote let it be the revelation of God through that word to you not what not to understand it I've had people a lot of times having well I don't understand don't worry about understanding it right read it the best you know how you can study it through absolutely find other scripture to go with it but you don't need to understand it you need to let God reveal it to you yeah amen try to make that point to understand God will reveal it and that's what we hold to and believe God revealing to us amen is that the word is that the truth and God will show it amen even if it's something you may not have read in the message or in the Bible God will reveal it to you let you know show you whether this is whether this is real or not amen praise the Lord but we beware because it is it is here in our ranks amen God help us to know Lord what is your perfect will for me amen that's what we all want let's stand to our feet if we could we only want his word and the revelation of his word and that word to speak to our hearts when it speaks to our hearts we have the Holy Ghost it'll speak and tell us exactly what we need to know amen it'll speak and show us where we are in that word and what we need to do what the Lord will show us sometimes again it makes a very difficult Road sometimes with friends with family amen with people you may have gone to church with for years or something uh but God is always leading God is always showing us amen praise the Lord let's sing this course amen number 316 sang it many times before Sanctuary 3:16 Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary for you amen that's what our whole heart is praise the Lord amen let's sing it to him
